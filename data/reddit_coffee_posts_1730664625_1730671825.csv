Ingredient amounts may vary depending on the size of your slow cooker. 

Wash your apples first to get rid of the waxy layer. I keep the skins on because most of the nutrients are in the skin, but peel anyways if that's your preference.

- Chop into whatever size you like, then add to your slow cooker with warm water (kickstarts the cooking process) along with a few tablespoons of brown sugar, a pinch of the following spices: Cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and star anise. Adding too much of those can give your cider a grainy texture.

- Here's my secret: **Add a couple black ch@i teabags** to your cider. Cut the tags off and just throw 'em in. Optional but tasty: orange slices with the peel.

- cook on high for 4 hours or low for 8 or 10. I prefer low because it makes my home smell pretty.

- Strain through a fine mesh siv and a coffee filter. Serve hot or chilled.

**BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!**

- Fish out the teabags and orange peels. Place the apple pulp into a blender and blend with the skins/orange flesh. You've got applesauce!

Both items keep in the fridge for about 4 days, or the freezer for 6 months.",3,1730671733.0,JanitorAI_Official,0,1.0,False

1giym5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1giym5m/my_psychiatrist_friend_gave_me_a_warning_and_i/,"My psychiatrist friend gave me a warning, and I should have listened.","The street was lined with maples, their jagged leaves a violent, deep red against the brooding gray sky. Pale clouds swirled like the smoke from a just-extinguished candle. I pulled my coat around me as a brisk wind stirred. In the distance, I could hear the sounds of traffic and people; but the main streets were several blocks from the cafe where Geoffrey had asked to meet me.

Geoffrey and I had not spoken in some time. We had been close in university, but he had gone on to practice psychiatry in a hospital, while I had established my private practice on the other side of the city; and eventually it became so that we only saw one another at conferences or by coincidence. Nevertheless, I had heard about the incident with his patient from a colleague, and then again when it was published in the newspaper. Soon it seemed it was all that anyone was talking about. Poor Geoffrey, and his poor, delusional patient. *Imagine having to do what Geoffrey did,* they said in hushed tones. *Horrific*. And, *Can you imagine?* So when Geoffrey called me out of the blue and asked me to meet him, I already had an idea of what it was he wanted to discuss.

A bell jingled as I pushed open the door of the cafe, and the smell of coffee greeted me in the warm air. I rubbed my hands together briskly to warm them and scanned the cafe. Geoffrey was seated at a small, round table in the corner farthest from the door, his back to the wall. His eyes were round and darting, and his shoulders tensed up to his ears. I raised a hand in greeting, and he returned a sharp nod. 

I ordered a latte at the counter and approached the table. “Nice to see you,” I said as I slid into the seat across from him. He offered a tight-lipped smile. A cup of black coffee sat in front of him, seemingly untouched, looking still and cold. I removed my gloves. “How have you been?” I asked.

“I assume you’ve heard about my patient.” His brown eyes had a tired sheen and were rimmed with stinging pink, glassy against the dark circles beneath them. His face sagged with the gravity of exhaustion.

“Yes. I’m so sorry. What a horrific affair.”

Geoffrey nodded, lips pursed, eyes not leaving mine. “Right. But you don’t *really* know, do you? What happened. No one does.”

“I know the short of it.”

He shook his head. “You need to know what *really* happened that day.”

I wondered briefly if this would take longer than I had expected. I had a session at one o’clock; it was a quarter past twelve already. *Book a session*, I thought to suggest, but instead I leaned back in my chair and asked, “What happened that day?”

“Don’t do that.”

My eyebrows lifted slightly. “Do what?”

“Talk to me like I’m your patient.”

The waitress appeared and placed the latte on the table in front of me. I averted my eyes from Geoffrey’s and took a long sip. 

“I’m only telling you this because it pertains to you,” he added.

I placed the mug gently down on the saucer. “What do you mean?”

His lip trembled, almost imperceptibly, and he said, “I’ll tell you. But first, I need you to swear you’ll believe me.”

A hint of unease twisted in my stomach. “Alright.”

Geoffrey’s hands went to the table, flat against the wood, as if holding on for balance; and then he folded them and began. “The patient called me that day, in the morning. Six a.m. He was in great distress; I couldn’t understand him at first. He said he needed to speak to me. That it was an emergency. We made an appointment for that afternoon - I’d had a cancellation, luckily, so we were able to get him in.

“I’m no stranger to patient crises. Someone’s always in crisis; that’s the nature of working in a psychiatric hospital. But something about his voice…I was shaken.” He rubbed the back of his left hand with the fingers of his right, twisting his hands, and sighed heavily. “Anyway, by the time the appointment rolled around, I had all but forgotten it. Until I saw the patient.” He swallowed. “It had been two, maybe three months since he was discharged. I was hopeful for this one’s prognosis. Depression, anxiety, OCD, but no psychosis; and he had improved a great deal in my care. But the man sitting in my waiting room, he looked…” A brief shake of his head. “He looked like he’d been emptied out.”

“He’d lost weight?”

“Not that. Just…*deflated…*as if all the hope was gone from him.”

I took another thoughtful sip of the latte. 

“When he sat down in my office, he looked like a man on the run,” Geoffrey continued. “He looked – hunted. *Haunted.* So I asked him what had brought him in. *‘A dream,’* he told me. And I thought, *What kind of dream would have a grown man in this state?* This was a stable man, a healthy man, when I had discharged him. Yet he sat here before me now, a shadow of himself, because of a dream?

“He must have known what I was thinking. He was sitting on his hands, looking at me with trembling eyes. *‘It didn’t feel like a dream, Doctor,’* he said to me. *‘It felt like I was living it. I felt everything - everything. And when I woke up, it felt like it had happened - just not* yet*.’* 

*“‘Like a premonition?’* I asked him.

“He shook his head furiously. *‘Like a future I already lived,’* he said.

“I couldn’t understand what he meant,” Geoffrey said. His fingers went to his saucer, and he began to trace its edge absentmindedly. “But I asked him what the dream was about. He looked at me with fear in his eyes, and said, ‘*You.’*

“He went on to tell me that in this dream - this dream he was convinced was already reality, but a reality that had simply not unfolded yet - he had killed me.”

I frowned.

“He went on to describe it: he had approached my house sometime in the night. He had come up the front walkway, driven an elbow through the window beside the door, then reached his hand through and unlocked it from the inside. He entered and stood there in silence. He could hear the sound of his own breathing. The soft creak of the floorboard as he shifted his weight on his feet. *‘Part of me knew what I planned to do,’* he told me, *‘and was filled with hatred and rage. The other part was waiting in helpless horror to see it unfold. I knew what I planned to do was something bad. Something evil. But I couldn’t fully see it yet. And I couldn’t stop it. It was like this part of me had lost control of my body and mind. Had given it to the other part.’* He went on to describe what happened next. Perhaps you already know this part from the newspapers.” Geoffrey had been staring into his coffee cup while he spoke, but turned his gaze to meet mine. I felt a flutter of nerves.

“You mean to say…”

Geoffrey nodded. “Yes. What happened in the dream is exactly what happened later that night. With the exception of one thing: in the dream, it was I who had died.”

A shiver crept up my spine.

“When I told him it was just a dream, he begged me to put him away. Pleaded to lock him in a cell that night, so that he wouldn’t hurt me. *‘Do you have the intention of hurting me?’* I asked him. He said no. I told him I didn’t think he needed to be hospitalized. You see, I treated this patient for OCD - he frequently had disturbing intrusive thoughts about harming people. They caused him a great deal of distress. I believed the intrusive thoughts combined with the vividness of a realistic dream had been overwhelming to him, and that he needed to see he was in control of his actions, that he wasn’t going to hurt anyone. That he wouldn’t act on his intrusive thoughts. Everything he had learned during his treatment in the hospital.”

“Sounds reasonable.”

“But when I returned home that evening, I found myself ruminating on the patient’s dream. Things he had said - details. How had he known there were windows beside my front door?”

“Most houses have windows beside the front door.”

Geoffrey nodded. “Yes. But the walkway, the foyer, the location of the staircase - it was all exactly as the patient had described.”

“Nearly every home has these things in a similar configuration.”

“Ever a skeptic.” A flicker of a mirthless smile touched his face. “Yet you already know my patient forcefully entered my house that very night, and attempted to kill me.”

There was a charged silence. Geoffrey sighed. “I admit I thought the same. I tried to shake off the feeling I had about my patient’s dream.” He paused and wet his lips. “I was in bed reading when I heard the window shatter. I won’t burden you with the details. You already know there was a struggle, and that I wrested his knife from his hands and killed him.”

“It was self-defense.”

“Yes.” He nodded, very slowly. For a moment he appeared lost in thought. Then he looked at me again. “Do you remember that case study in university? The patient with locked-in syndrome.”

“I remember.”

“I’ll never forget how it felt to look into that patient’s eyes. It was like he was trapped, somewhere deep inside his body.” A brief shake of his head; another moment of reverie. “In my house that night, my patient loomed over me on the stairs, raising that knife, while I held him by the wrists and fought for my life. I looked into his eyes then, for a brief moment. And they looked just like the eyes of that LIS patient. Like he was there, somewhere - but not on the surface. Like he was trapped somewhere inside.”

I shifted in my seat uncomfortably, thinking. “Perhaps a sudden onset of psychosis?” I said at last. 

Geoffrey furrowed his brow.

“An acute episode - or perhaps a neurological condition,” I went on. 

“No,” he said sharply, his voice suddenly hostile.

I recalled his earlier words. “You said this pertains to me,” I said. “Do you believe the patient suffered from a condition I have some expertise in?”

“*No.* I-” he glanced furtively beyond my shoulder. “Listen, I *need* you to believe me.”

“I believe you.”

“Not what I’ve said. What I’m *about* to say.”

“I can’t promise that-”

“*Listen to me.*” He leaned forward in his chair, lowering his voice. “This is the truth.”

“Alright, alright. I’m listening.”

He began to speak in a low voice, and I leaned forward as well to hear him. “I told you I couldn’t understand it when my patient described his dream - when he said it wasn’t a dream, but a thing that happened - that had already happened - but that simultaneously had yet to come to pass. That I discredited him as having had an extremely realistic dream - but still a dream, nonetheless.”

I nodded. 

“But I see now that I was wrong. Because now…” I could see the whites of his eyes around his irises. His gaze bore into mine with that imperative: *listen to me*. “Now I’ve had the dream as well.”

“A dream about the…incident?”

“No. A dream that…*I–”*

“I see.” I looked around; there was no one around us. “A dream that you…” I lowered my voice to near a whisper. “That you killed someone.”

“Yes.” His hands clutched the edges of the table. “A dream that I killed…*you.*”

I recoiled. “Me?”

Geoffrey nodded urgently. “That’s why I had to meet you. I had to warn you. You have to leave - please. For tonight, at least.”

“Look, I…” I shook my head. “I’m not going to leave town because of a dream.” 	

“It’s *not* a dream, that’s what I’m trying to tell you.”

“It *is.* And frankly, I don’t believe in dream analysis, it’s Freudian nonsense, Geoffrey, I’m sorry.”

“Listen to me - *please.* You need to take your wife and your son and get out. I can’t - I won’t be able to control it.”

I slid my chair back. “I think you’re suffering from the aftereffects of the trauma, and I sympathize with you, really, but to be honest with you, I think you need to get some help.”

“I don’t-”

“You don’t look like you’ve been sleeping, and you sound…”

“Don’t say it.”

“It just sounds like delusions, Geoffrey, you know this-”

“I *told* you-”

“Hallucinations-”

“*Please,* just *listen* to me!” His voice was loud now, and I looked around in embarrassment.

“I’m sorry,” I said again after a moment. I glanced at my watch. It was a quarter to one. I stood. “I have a session. I suggest you speak with someone - I really do. I’m sorry you’re going through this.”

He said nothing. I took my gloves from the table, glanced at him one more time on my way to the door. He was staring at the table, in that same hunched and defeated posture, hardly resembling the man I knew. I left. 

\*\*\*



In the silence of my home, I cleaned the dishes from a late and solitary dinner, thinking about my meeting with Geoffrey. It was not the first time I had seen someone crumble in the wake of a traumatic event. However, seeing it happen to Geoffrey - a friend and a fellow psychiatrist - had shaken me. After my one o’clock session, I had called a mutual friend of ours, another psychiatrist, and asked him to check on Geoffrey. I knew the two of them were still close. But at six, he had called back to tell me Geoffrey had not returned to his home, nor to the hospital. I did not like to think of him wandering the city in the midst of an acute episode, but reasoned he would be fine. I would check on him tomorrow.

I sat down in front of the TV and turned it on, flipping aimlessly through channels. To my surprise, soon it was already nearing eight. My wife and son should have been home by now. I flipped idly through the channels for a few more minutes, but dread began to creep into my gut. *You need to take your wife and son and get out.* Why would he say such a thing? In spite of myself, I stood and wandered around the first floor. There were no shattered windows, no open doors. I barked an empty laugh. What was I doing? I returned to the sitting room and sank back into my armchair. Settled on a game show, the tinned laughter of the audience filling the room.

Years ago, Geoffrey and I had been so close. He had celebrated the opening of my private practice with me. He had even come to my housewarming party when I first purchased the house, drank champagne with me and my wife, back then still girlfriend. He had been a confidant, someone I had trusted - 

My hand hovered over the remote.

Someone I had trusted enough to give a spare key to the house, in case of emergencies. We had drifted apart so gradually I had forgotten to ever get it back.

*You’re being ridiculous,* I told myself. Yet I stood, made my way to the staircase. Stood at the bottom of it, glanced at the front door. Locked. *Could have been locked from the inside.* I looked up the stairs. The light from the lofted foyer illuminated it to the top. All was still. Slowly, I ascended the stairs. Fear gripped me. I walked slowly, quietly. In front of the bedroom door, I paused. My trembling hand wrapped around the round, shining doorknob. I opened the door.

Inside, what should have been beige and cream and quiet was punctuated with a pained scream of red. My wife and son’s bodies lay on the queen bed, blood soaking into the white sheets from the wounds in their abdomens and from their slit throats. It spread like the slow bloom of a rose. Their skin was wan, as if they were made of wax; their lips had become the color of rotted fruit. I let out a strangled yelp and sank to my knees. My body shook with sobs. 

Geoffrey stood beside the bed, a looming, ominous shadow. A knife was in his hand, and his face was blank. 

I wanted to kill him, to rip him limb from limb. But I  could not will myself to rise. My lungs were empty, air ripped away with my ruined life, my slaughtered family. 

Geoffrey took a step towards me, grabbed me by the hair and turned my tear-streaked face up to meet his. Our eyes locked. His were mad and empty; his face was contorted with rage. But somewhere beyond the madness, there was a flicker of the man I knew, trapped somewhere deep inside. A tear fell, and he raised the knife.

I had the biggest crush on her but she was married,  I never said anything inappropriate to her.  She would stare at me so much, and she would always blush.  She would make excuses to come to my department,   alot of people began noticing that she might like me,  we had soo much chemistry it was crazy.

Eventually a year later my supervisor told me I needed to leave Nina alone because we would talk way to much.   Some coworkers made rumors about us,  and NINA told my friends that she misses talking to me.   Apperantly she was mad because we couldn't talk.   

I didn't see her for a whole week because I was sick,  when I came back it was her birthday and I gave her a gift card to her favorite coffee shop.   I noticed she was awkward which she's never been awkward with me.    She actually told my manager about the card and he removed me to another department far away from Nina.   She would see me in the hallway and she would look the other way....but still stare at me from a far.

She blocked me from everything.    Am I huge creep now????  I'm emeberassed and she probably hates me now.

Any advice

between getting to california after being called dumb and told we could not go to an even that alec lali invited me to because he felt disrespected by it he was mean to me right after his show when two gay guys asked for my Ig.

he later apologized for tripping about this and said the guys were 100% gay

we got home fine on friday morning but things fell apart on saturday and sunday 

right before friday night he grilled me about my travels to california and criticized how it would not have been possible to travel to la with very little money

i answered his line of questions after he threw shots at me about my parents money(non-existent) and then he just said “fa sho” and fell asleep
but then he did a weird thing(he’s done it a couple of times already) where he “fell asleep” and then jumped out of his sleep as though he had a nightmare (ask me if i reacted)

to me, it appeared that he wanted to make it known that i had bored him with the details of my life

i was hurt but i went to sleep

the next morning after we had showered, i mentioned that he keeps the lotion under his sink and he said lotion is only for some parts of your body when they become dry. followed by an accusation of media and marketing trying to make people feel that something is wrong g with their hair and skin

i expressed that this was totally valid for mad produced products that do little for the sound health and said that i honestly like moisturizing for the comfort and cosmetic aspect. to each their own.

he proceeded to lay down in his room and “google this lotion thing so you can see”
…i just laid there next to him until he eventually said “hmm it turns out people of different backgrounds need lotion for different reasons. maybe my ethnic background makes it so that i do not”

i said 

“that’s nice baby”

and then he called himself dumb and asked if i wanted coffee

i said yes please baby

i took my laptop and charger out of my book bag to do some work and he said “what are you about to do with that?”


i said “who knows” 

he said “what did you say to me baby?”

“i mean like, who knows.. im just taking it out to have it”

*mean look* “next time, you say ‘i don’t know’ baby”

we say in the living room watching football with his roommate when he briskly stood up and started toward the kitchen. “where is that being coming from, it’s driving me crazy”…i walked over to the danger and closed it tightly since he’s freaked about the same beep before

“yay babe we fixed it!” i cheered with a smile and a kiss on his cheek

*silence*

THE BIG BLOW UP

Around an hour later, we were sitting on the couch as i worked on job applications.

he brought our laundry from the laundry room and began to fold it. I folded my own and took it to his room, putting them near my belongings

a Wendy’s commercial came on and he asked me what i thought they meant by “fresh never frozen” i engaged and shared my belief that they probably do frequent meat deliveries or collaborr were ate with regional meat farmers 

“you could at least look at me while talking to me while i am folding your laundry”…there’s a chance i left a pair of pants and one shirt in the laundry pile but he was tripping 

i didn’t say anything and he stormed away, only returning to say “what’s going on? why the attitude? do you need to go home?”

i waited a minute to follow him back to his room and explain that i was not mad at him but had been sitting on my feelings about how he questioned me harshly the night before and this morning.

he began to yell at me that i was digging up things and he didn’t expect me to actually come back with something i was upset about

this turned into a 3 hour silence-argument-silence  heated conversation about how i feel i am patient with him in moments when he is being unkind (often holding my tongue for days at a time to give it thought)and how he blows up on me or shuts me down at the first hint of misalignment 

he said this made him feel criticized and talked down to and i was making too much of him and holding the last against him (all just stuff from october and today)

finally i brought up that i we were not arguing because i mentioned that he has upset me, as a matter of fact..i was probably never going to bring it up

we were arguing because she stormed off during a wendy’s commercial(which he accused me of ignoring him for several minutes but i didn’t and was fully engaged with him the entire 2 minute burger meat conversation) 

in fact, i added, i only brought it up because you were so upset about wendy’s that you decided to take me home and asked if i was harboring an attitude

THIS made him upset 

WHY DO YOU KEEP GOING BACK TO THAT WE ARE TALKING ANOUT UOU BEING MAD AT ME ALL DAY ANS SAYING NOTHING

no babes we are talking about you getting mad that i didn’t look at you for one second

you need therapy, not for me but for you

i really say there for hours and took the blame

FAST FORWARD TO THIS MORNING

I woke up and kissed him “im so happy to have you in my life”

he kissed me back “ i was so sad before you came into my life”

then I mentioned that i’d like to go to the bookstore today to finish a book a started while we were in Los Angeles a few days prior.

The book is “the problem of pain” by c.s lewis 

I started to share that I enjoyed the of humans versus nature and how each has its own set of laws and relationship to God although we seldom communicate with each other directly.

he took interest in the part of whether god is real or cares or not(a topic i love to explore)

after a discussion of whether God is real or not he said 
“if i say ‘fa sho’ and fall asleep will you get mad again?”
he said before closing his eyes and laying back down

i said “no, but i am starting to see that maybe we argue when i don’t feel heard by you but i could take into consideration that you prefer to explore the part of the conversation that does not make sense to you and have that proven to you rather than engaging with the part that the person(me) might have been interested in. maybe that’s our disconnect. i’ll try to keep that in mind so i don’t get offended again”

LORD WHY TF DID I SAY THIS

big argument
he told me he had work and i needed to go home 
he packed all of my extra belongings neatly and set them on the table when i was in the shower

i packed all of my belongings from the previous week and and started to load them in the car myself (declining his help)
he then noticed that i was taking a jacket i leant him 6 months prior
“you’re not going to disappear from my life are you”

no baby i just don’t want my stuff in your way

..he dropped me off at home and we talked about it all ONE more time 

he took offense that i would bring up california and the day before when he was upset with me over small things 


eventually he says “what i’ve learned is that when i ask people questions it can feel like im trying to make them feel dumb or invalidate their interest and i could work on that”

my response “it makes me sad that it took us 1.5 days to come to this conclusion and i really hope I can find a better way to share my feelings with you babe”

he helped me put my stuff inside of my home and then left.

that was 11 am today(sunday morning)

i had taken a nap after feeling pretty bad about all of this and when i woke up i still felt sad and disconnected

so i called him and he said that he was at target and didn’t end up working today

i said babe that makes me sad that you felt like you couldnt tell me you needed space today

he also mentioned that he’s going back to LA this week to get his tooth fixed and would be back soon

what is going on with us

i asked if im smothering him or if he’s falling in love with someone else


he assured me this is untrue and pointed out that we spent the last 10 days together. space would be good.

i agree 100% and would have gone home but he suggested i work from his place when we got back on friday and before that my cousin had to stay at my place for a few days 

i dont even know how to express why im feelings

the guttedness and failure of pointless arguments. not being able to just shut up and be loved by him while ignoring the mean things here and there

I thought i was strong but i feel so humiliated that i feel the brunt of the guilt and as the one who is in therapy and has a degree in psychology, i should be able to i tell myself better and avoid all of this

We were all ""financially embarrassed"" for distinct reasons:  One guy's father had gone through an extended period of unemployment during the 1981-82 recession.  Another guy came from a middle-class family that had saved for college, but my roommate was the younger son following an older brother, and the college savings were getting kind of low by the time that the second son entered college.  A third guy came from a family who ran a retail store near a neighboring state, and an increase in our state's sales tax had driven the customers away, to the neighboring state with lower sales tax. And as for me--my family was just broke.

We did the following things to make or save money as poor undergraduates in the early 1980s:

1. We agreed not to run the heat during the first semester of the school year.  We went to school in a town in east-central Illinois that could get pretty cold in December, and even November.  I did most of my studying at one of our college's many libraries.

2.  When we were in the dorms, we avoided making long distance phone calls.  There was no charge for having the landline in your dorm room...the only charge came from long distance calls. We did all the deceptive work-arounds, like calling home when you got back to campus, letting the phone ring three times, then hanging up before your folks picked up the phone. That way, you signaled to the family that you had gotten back to campus safely, without incurring the charge for the phone call.

3. We lived around the corner from an IHOP that had a regular special on Tuesday and Thursday nights...all-you-can-eat pancakes for $1 each.  A bottomless pot of coffee was $1 for each of us.  Also, my roommate wanted to date the waitress, so we all agreed to tip $1 a piece so that she would not think that we were cheap (He never got up the nerve to ask her out. We could have just as easily tipped a quarter each, for all the good that our dollar tips did him).  We got a lot of food for our $3 a piece.

4. The school that we attended had a big Psychology department, and there were always studies that paid undergraduates to be ""guinea pigs"" in psychology lab studies. The Department's main emphasis was on learning and memory, so most of the studies involved looking at intricate drawings/photographs and then answering questions about details in the images (E.g., ""What color was the car that was stopped in the intersection?""). The usual pay was about $4 for an hour of participation (the minimum wage at that time was $3.35 an hour).

5.  Two of my roommates would go out very early on Sunday mornings and hunt for aluminum cans in the area around the bars.  At the time, I considered that to be too extreme, although forty-five years later, I'm not sure why I felt that way. It sounds fine to me now.

6. On Sunday night, when the dorms did not serve meals, the campus churches all had cheap dinners (c. $1.25 to $1.50) that were pretty good, and we would make the rounds of those.

7.  I worked one night a week as night security at a dorm.

8.  A local liquor store frequently sold 8-packs of Carling's Black label longnecks for $2, and worth every penny. After the first couple, it all tasted the same anyway.  The town that we lived in had such aggressive bottle laws that frequently the deposit on the bottles exceeded the cost of the beer. 

Thirty-four years after I attended that college, my daughter went to the same school.  She and her little friends certainly seemed to enjoy a higher standard of living than I had while in college.  Maybe she did a better job of picking her parents than I did. I doubt that she was gorging on cheap pancakes just to keep her belly full.

**Day One: Sunday**

2:33 a.m. — Another money diary starting in a city that isn’t where I live! I’m in Austin for a wedding and make it back to the hotel post-after-party. I wash my face to take off my makeup, put on my pajamas and just about fall into bed. 

10:18 a.m. — I snooze my alarm twice and then slowly start getting ready for the farewell brunch hosted by the bride and groom. 

11:12 a.m. — I finally head downstairs, checkout and pay for my hotel room. I have a mimosa and sausage breakfast sandwich. After brunch, I split an Uber with my friends to the airport. They insist on paying. $525

1:38 p.m. — Once I get through security, I buy a latte and croissant because we’re flying through lunch / dinner. $15.94

4:12 p.m. — Wheels up to San Francisco! A quick tip that is definitely not from personal experience; if you wear an exercise dress with no bra to the airport, you might end up in an airplane bathroom stark naked.

6:07 p.m. — I land, pay to pick up my car from the long term lot and head home. My friend, D., watched my dog while I was away. After he leaves, I'm immediately in bed. $75

9 p.m. — Take my dog, S., on her night walk and go to bed early.

**Daily Total: $615.94**

**Day Two: Monday**

6:18 a.m. — Two snoozes and I'm out of bed. I put on workout clothes, splash water on my face, brush my teeth and head to the gym.

7:58 a.m. — I finish teaching a 45 minute class, clock out and drive over to Trader Joe’s. I am rarely without a list, but I am today. After wandering for meal inspiration, I land on chicken ravioli soup and a breakfast casserole. My haul is mirepoix, persimmons, ravioli, chicken breast, breakfast sausage, a half dozen eggs, shredded cheese, oat milk and chicken broth. This probably won’t last me the full week, but it’ll do for now! $36.19

8:21 a.m. — Once I get home, I quickly prepare the breakfast casserole, pop it in the oven and take S. on a walk. When I'm back, I hop in the shower, make myself a latte and start on calls from 9:30 to 11:30 (with an off camera casserole break in between).

11:30 a.m. — My lunch hour comes early today and I'm back in the kitchen making chicken noodle (ravioli as the noodle, of course) soup. While the soup is simmering, I start on laundry.

2:30 p.m. — I wrap up meetings for the day and can finally dive into focused work, compared to my usual multitasking. I finish up a strategy email and talking points for one of my VPs and share with our chief of staff and HR partner before logging off for the day.

5:00 p.m. — I have virtual therapy for an hour and then take S. out for a walk and heat up more soup for dinner. I'm still pretty tired from the wedding weekend, so I cycle between folding laundry, watching more TikTok and reading an Ali Hazelwood book on my iPad. $13.89

7:30 p.m.  — I need a sweet treat, so I buy a box of Junior Mints from my corner store. $2.07

11:30 p.m.  — In (bad) usual form, I fall asleep with the lights on and my phone unplugged and wake up to walk S. before properly going to bed.

**Daily Total: $52.15**

**Day Three: Tuesday**

8:00 a.m. — I should've been up 90 minutes ago to get workout endorphins before heading into the office. It's a mad dash to eat breakfast (breakfast casserole and a persimmon), get ready, walk S., get on the bus (prepaid with pre-tax dollars) and make it to the office.

12:00 p.m. — I get out of a morning of meetings and while I should be getting lunch, I need to finish a deliverable for my team's chief of staff to review before 1:30 p.m. I end up skipping lunch and eating a bag of PopChips.

5:00 p.m. — I wrap up work and head to a massage appointment. I have a gift card but leave an additional tip. I spend the entire time thinking about work, feeling guilty for thinking about work, counting to clear my mind and then thinking about work again. $30

5:50 p.m. — I could go to the gym but it feels like a waste of a massage? I head home for another cozy night in with S., stopping on the way for a pint of ice cream. $9.35

8:07 p.m. — I am full of soup and ice cream, my bra is off and my sweatpants are on. I finally open my mail in ballot. San Francisco has 15 ballot measures, so I sit down to do some research on each.

10:00 p.m. — S. and I head out for her final walk and then get into bed.

**Daily Total: $39.35**

**Day Four: Wednesday**

6:36 a.m. — I usually teach a fitness class on Wednesday mornings, but I need to be in my company office in the South Bay. I shower, walk S. and walk two blocks to catch the 7:30 a.m. corporate shuttle.

8:57 a.m. — I make it to the office and have my ""I just commuted for 90 minutes"" breakfast; a plain bagel with half cream cheese and half Nutella and a dirty chai latte. It is absolutely too early to be eating Nutella, but life requires treats.

10:30 a.m. — Today is an unusually light meeting day. I don't have a desk in this office, so I camp out at a coffee bar and spend most of my time trying to set myself up for success given I'll be out of the country for work next week. I clean up my inbox and calendar and preset my email responder.

12:00 p.m. — My plan to get Indian food is thwarted by a very long line and my need to be on the other side of our sprawling campus for a meeting. I stop by a grab and go station for a pre-made peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

1:00 p.m. — One of my favorite things about working for a big company is being able to participate in our research studies. I spent an hour doing an eye tracking study. I have no clue what product this research will be used for, but as a Black woman who also has terrible eyesight, I am hopefully adding diversity to their data set.

3:52 p.m. — Board the shuttle to head back home. I'm hosting my best friend, K., and her new girlfriend for dinner at my place tonight! I drive to the grocery store to buy ingredients for salad, baked ziti and pull apart chocolate chip cookies. I love baking and would usually cook from scratch but I need to restock on a bunch of baking supplies. $30.04

7:18 p.m. — In the last two hours, I have somehow managed to make ziti, toss a salad and prepare cookies on a quarter sheet. I'm pulling the ziti out of the oven as the girls arrive.

10:26 p.m. — I love hosting! After three hours of natural wine, baked pasta and giggles, I send the girls home with leftovers. I walk S., clean up the kitchen, send out a quick work email to take advantage of timezones and curl up into bed.

**Daily Total: $30.04**

**Day Five: Thursday**

7:30 a.m. — Start the morning with extended S. cuddles before getting ready, eating breakfast and heading to the bus (with S. in tow)! It's Halloween and she has accepted her fate of being a very cute dinosaur for the day.

12:54 p.m. — I finish up a focus time block and meetings and find a cafe with a short line. I get chicken fried rice and a Halloween sugar cookie.

3:00 p.m. — I walk S. over to a different building downtown for a pet parade. She is NOT having it. We last a total of 30 minutes before accepting a ride home from a coworker. After we get home, I walk over to Walgreens to pick up a prescription and grab tissue packs (because my nose always runs on planes) and a mini bag of cashews (also a plane must-have for me). $3.16

5:49 p.m. — I'm heating up dinner and my doorbell rings. It's a surprise bouquet of flowers from one of my close friends as a late birthday gift! I take approximately 100 pictures and send her a thank you text message.

11:00 p.m. — As much as I love condo living, I'm a girl from the suburbs! I miss giving out candy -- so I spend the evening peeking out the window at all the cute young families in my neighborhood. I take S. on her night walk and fall asleep.

**Daily Total: $3.16**

**Day Six: Friday**

8:36 a.m. — S. and I sleep in because it's Friday. I finally get up and hop in the shower before taking my only call of the day. After the call, I take an early lunch to get my nails done. It's $4 to park on the street for two hours and I pay the full amount so that I'm not worried about feeding the meter.

11:55 a.m. — I finish up at the nail salon and D. stops by to drop off dog stuff and my keys. Between us MD readers, he and I were very close in my last money diary. We're no longer physically intimate and trying to navigate our friendship has been hard for me; his quirks are much less charming without pillow talk and cute weekend trips. $60

1:11 p.m. — D. leaves after lunch (even in our weird state, I still sometimes feed him to avoid food waste) and I get back to work, finalizing prep materials for my work trip and handing over anything I won't be able to cover due to timezones.

5:30 p.m. — I wrap up work, walk S. and have a weird dinner of breakfast casserole, persimmons and salad. I'm trying to clear out my fridge before I leave on my trip and I know the chicken soup base can freeze. Having a few easy servings of soup that I can thaw out and eat will be nice for when I get home and I'm jet lagged.

9:00 p.m. — After feeling bad for myself for 30 seconds for not going out on second Halloweekend, I start the Megan Thee Stallion documentary. 

11:00 p.m. — S. and I take her night walk and go to bed.

**Daily Total: $64**

**Day Seven: Saturday**

9:46 a.m. — The pup and I are up and ready for a lazy travel prep day. I finish up my ballot and we walk over to the library to drop it off. When we get back, I have breakfast and start my last load of laundry. I won't pack most of these items, but I like to have my full closet accessible to me when I get home from traveling.

12:54 p.m. — I heat up a serving of soup and freeze the rest. I fight the urge to get back in bed and look at TikTok and prepare my house to be empty for six days; I water plants, take out trash, fold up laundry, set ant traps (they randomly appear whenever I’m gone for a few days) and pack S.’s treats and toys for her sitter. I also give my birthday flowers to my neighbor so they can be enjoyed.

5:15 p.m. — I drop S. off at her sitter (she’s $80 /day and I’ll pay her when I get back) and drive to the long-term parking garage. Parking will cost $140 and I pre-paid on my corporate card. 

7:15 p.m. — I’m checked in, through security and in the lounge. I order a glass of champagne and the bartender insists that I have a French 75. Ok? I don’t love gin but I’m caught off guard and I would like to sleep on the plane. 

9:15 p.m. — The plane pushes back to Singapore. I have a bellini before takeoff. I’m ready to go to sleep but waiting (im)patiently for dinner to be served. 

11:45 p.m. — I finish a Japanese curry dish and take a Benadryl (as mentioned earlier, something about planes make my nose run and I assume it’s allergies) and fall asleep to a 10 hour loop of Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata in my headphones (my plane sleeping trick).

(apologies in advance if needs a spoiler curtain, don’t know how to do that, please advise)

First of all, I love this game and everyone who plays it. What a beautiful community that I and so many never thought to find! I’m so sorry to post this on the Eve of the update, the most exciting time for many playing different ways, but I play on iPad and last night after visiting skull caverns And getting home ok with a warp, upon new login, several things have disappeared!

So I’ve been madly searching online and found my statue of perfection again by visiting Grandpa’s shrine (as I was able to dig up in another post from years ago), but my coffee machine, jukebox also disappeared along with the perfection shrine, as well as a work bench. I don’t really care about the workbench… can obviously buy a new jukebox, but it was in the middle of 8 chests so there’s no way that in my sleep I dug it out…let alone the other things. My club has disappeared as well, but that one may be my fault as I’m not sure where I left it.

They just weren’t there when I got out of bed at 6 (game time and at first log in today around 4pm GMT).

Has anybody else had this happen and how can I get my coffee machine back?   
Please help!

The only different thing I did in the past two days was change the music on the jukebox for the second time. I have warped home from the desert many times before and never had this issue, but I did find a post from some year ago where someone said that the desert warp may be a bit glitchy? 

Anyone else have any issue?   
just want to avoid it in future… did I do something wrong? 

I don’t even need coffee first thing in the morning in RL, but my farmer girl does for sure and just need to know how to get that back please! Thank you xx ",2,1730671101.0,StardewValley,0,1.0,False

Propranolol, Ritalin, Vita B complex, magnesium and D². Vitamins are doctor prescribed. My magnesium and B levels are normal but I take supplements because of the vita D. 
I get sun and eat vita D foods,I just can't digest it for whatever reason.

Symptoms aren't related to my medicine as they pre-date them. No high blood pressure, blood work is normal other then those chronic vitamin deficiency and some other stuff but I was told that that would be irrelevant. Liver and kidneys are fine as well.

Is there any illnesses or conditions that causes someone to be super cold? My place is almost 70 degrees, I'm bundled, on a heat mat and freezing. I tried taking a hot bath didn't work. 

My eyelids feel colder than my eyeballs just as an example.
I keep trying to get about and move, I've had a few glasses of hot tea/coffee and I'm still freezing. 

It can happen in the summer when it's 90 out as well.

I'm not sick and this is a consistent issue so even if I was I'm not with infection 24/7 365 days a year. Not that it happens every day just an example.

I wanted to get stuff done today but I'm so cold I can't. It's horrible when this happens. 
I have tried telling doctors before and plan on telling my current doctor but before I do so I just wanted to get some more information on how to talk to them. 

Unfortunately the response that I have gotten, even when I was complaining about this at 6 years old, was that I need to eat more and gain weight. I'm not underweight to such a degree and I eat regularly. 

Well except when this happens because I can't. It's like my digestive system stops working because my body is too cold. Theory through experience, don't quote me. ",1,1730670909.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

We have our ups and downs but nothing majorly negative. I love her and I know she loves me back. We treat each other with respect and Im pretty sure we’re more than ok in the intimacy department. We have learned and try our best to always communicate and understand each other’s feelings with whatever it may be. But I think it’s best to keep this “situation” to myself (aka me and my bro). 

I dont know how to put it, but I like this barista at our local cafe. I guess let’s begin with where it all started. A friend introduced me to a local cafe, and I saw her there for the first time, admittedly she is very pretty and she had this glow. She was very nice and polite but nothing out of the ordinary for a person working at a cafe. Me and my friend would occasionally visit there from time to time up until he moved to another state. So I started going there alone cause I like the place and the coffee was fantastic! I don’t know why but I started noticing the little things. She would call me by my name, which the 5 other baristas in their rotation didn’t. But I guessed since Im a regular maybe it was her being a mindful employee??? She always started with “hello name!” and when I leave she would go out of her way to say “goodbye name, take care!” she only did that to me, or so I observed with the other regulars. She took extra precaution with writing my name on the cup properly (because it’s an uncommon spelling for my name), since  the other employees would consistently spell it wrong, and I didn’t mind nor ever brought it up. I have long accepted that my name has different derivatives lol. Plus, she memorized what I usually ordered, and before I say anything she already got it in the system. When she did it the first time I was lost for words.

When shes at the register we take longer than usual, I pay with cash and she always would ask if I had change for a dollar or whatever (I started bringing change with me lol). I don’t know why but our small interactions made me feel attracted to her. I would catch myself occasionally glancing or looking for her when shes not there. She has this beautiful smile that would knock me off my train of thought. Her eyes speak to me like a flower to a butterfly. Then and only then I realized I like her. Just to make things clear, I don’t do anything. We barely talk, we don’t even talk about the weather. Our longest conversation was maybe 2 mins of her asking if i like cats since they’re pet friendly and I was petting one of the strays they feed. But I admit, I would always hope to see her when I go there. I know this sounds terrible, nonetheless I dont make moves, try to flirt, try to do anything out of the ordinary (except maybe the change stuff), cause I have a gf and shes probably taken too!

Ive been going there for half a year now, just to see her. Her smile, her energy, the way she says my name- the little things. Theres just something about her that makes me feel something I cant express in words. And I feel terribly guilty that I like another woman thats not my gf. I try to shrug it off and say that I didn’t do anything wrong, I just like her. I like to think that shes just a great person with so much attention to detail, Im just one of the lucky few. This is something I needed to get off my chest for a few weeks now, since I didn’t see her the past few visits until today. Is there something wrong with me? ",1,1730670861.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1giya8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/SafetyProfessionals/comments/1giya8y/csp_passing_post/,CSP passing Post,"Good Day Everyone,

  
I posted a few times about CSP study items and reviewed different takes by different people. I want to first say thank you for posting, it made it a lot easier to figure out a good study strategy. I used about three different items to study:

* ASSP CSP Study Tool
* Yates Book
* Pocket Prep

  
I studied for about 3-4 hours a day 5 days a week, my job is a little more stress free and flexible so it allowed me time to study when needed. I wouldn't say any of them helped more than the other to be honest, but the Yates had a lot more relevant information overall. The other two added filler information and helped me develop study methods.

 I found my questions to be pretty math heavy compared to some of the other posts, I can recall about 20-25 math questions overall with about half of them being pretty difficult (math isn't strong for me but it was easy to narrow it down to two or three reasonable answers). A vast majority of my questions were incident investigation, security, management, and training. Like most have posted, its quite easy to narrow down the answers to get two of them. The ones that were heavy on the sentences and/or were thinking intensive I flagged for review later to solve towards the end. 

I ended up taking a break at around 75 to 100 questions and when I was ready to tackle the flagged ones. I had an early morning test time so it was nice to have some coffee and a snack. I found that taking my mind off it helped refocused me. I ended up using around four to four and a half hours to finish it out and get a lunch beer to celebrate.

1giy9x9,https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/1giy9x9/huge_shoutout_for_platforming_galya/,HUGE SHOUTOUT FOR PLATFORMING GALYA 🙌,"Massive props to Ethan and the crew for bringing Galya on the show. It was great to hear compatriot talking about the russian war on the Ukraine who lived through it. It was baffling to me at the beginning of the conflict how much discourse was centered around Ukraine, but there was almost no representation of Ukrainians themselves.

I want to chime in with a few thoughts and additions to the topics that were brought up.

1) ""basements"" in Russian-occupied regions

It was mentioned regarding punishments and interrogation practices used on the occupied territory. People who hear about this first time might not fully understand what it means, as a lot of the context is lost in the translation. (""кинуть на подвал"" -> ""take to the basement"")

The so-called ""basement"" can be any building that serves as an undocumented/unofficial prison. There is widespread [torture practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_torture_chambers_in_Ukraine) there, and it's a tool for terrorizing the civil population, as any attributes of Ukraine's identity (speaking Ukrainian, signs with the national flag, football shirts) can be a reason to be taken away. The practice wasn't invented in 2022, as they have used the same approach in Donetsk and Luhansk regions since 2014([Izolyatsia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izolyatsia_prison) was one of the most well-known prisons). And even before, they set up similar stuff in Chechnya.

2) drafting Ukrainians into Russian troops

This one seems counterintuitive, but Russians use a tactic of ""meat assaults"" (""мясные штурмы""). They send low-priority soldiers with no proper equipment to draw out defense schemes and prepare the assault by the professionally trained military. For this purpose, they use local populations from occupied regions or [prisoners who were pardoned to fight the war](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/russia-to-deploy-convicts-with-hepatitis-1730230632.html).

3) what does Putin want

The plan is to rebuild the Russian Empire within former territories of the Soviet Union. Initially, they were delulu about public opinion in Ukraine and thought that the Ukrainian population would accept occupation. Since it wasn't the case, I think they just want to displace and kill as many Ukrainians as possible and make our country not habitable. That's why they constantly bomb the infrastructure and terrorize big cities like Kharkiv and Kyiv. Also, they set an example for other post-Soviet republics. You can already see [political ads in Georgia ](https://united24media.com/latest-news/ukraine-condemns-georgian-party-for-using-war-torn-ukrainian-cities-in-pre-election-ads-2625)that use pictures of destroyed cities in Ukraine.

4) enjoying the life in the war zone stuff

I think the most horrible thing about living in the war is how normal it becomes. I will never forget an elderly woman from Mykolaiv calmly sitting with the dog in her lap and describing cluster ammunition in her backyard as ""small petals lying around"" and telling how she spent a night in the garage under [Grad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BM-21_Grad) shelling.

Even yesterday, I was in Kyiv during one of the longest drone attacks in the last six months. Bomber drones(Shaheds) were flying through the skyscrapers, and people were drinking coffee under them. I think you accept that there is a possibility that you may die any day, and you go on with your life. It might sound surreal, but I think fellow Ukrainians recognize the feeling.

5) Hasan fundraiser for Ukraine

Here, I'll be edgy. Of course, I don't want to criticize anyone for raising money for Ukrainians, but I don't think that this act grants lifelong immunity to the largest political commentator who spreads Russian propaganda.

So, once again, thanks for the representation. Peace and love",17,1730670666.0,h3h3productions,0,0.9,False

1giy95z,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1giy95z/ro_super_marios_struggle_is_real/,[RO] Super Mario's struggle is real,"“Another one last night, wasn’t it?” Luigi’s voice was equal parts amusement and pity.

Mario leaned back against the couch, a faint smirk playing on his lips. “Yeah. Another one. Pretty girl, funny. Good night.”

“And?” Luigi’s gaze sharpened. “Did it mean anything?”

Mario shrugged, his tone indifferent. “It was… fun, you know? Points racked up. On to the next.”

“Points?” Luigi shook his head, incredulous. “Mario, you’re talking about these women like they’re coins in a game. Collect, discard, repeat.”

Mario laughed, though it sounded brittle. “So what? At least I’m living, right? And I’m getting better at it, Lu. The whole game.”

Luigi watched him, face softening. “You’re thirty. And still playing games.”

Mario sighed. He could feel a weight in his chest, though he couldn’t name it. “So what’s your grand advice, wise brother? That I should… settle down? Believe in something real?” He tried to sound mocking, but the words came out almost… weary.

“I just don’t think it’s what you really want,” Luigi said gently. “The night after the night. You wake up, and they’re gone. And so are you, even more.”

Mario looked away, tracing the rim of his coffee mug with his finger. “I don’t know what I want anymore, Lu. I just know… I don’t feel anything lasting. I keep hoping the next one will… fix it. Fix me.”

Luigi leaned forward, his voice quiet. “Maybe it’s not about the next one, Mario. Maybe it’s about becoming someone who doesn’t just vanish. Who sticks around, even when things aren’t perfect. That’s real, isn’t it? Someone who doesn’t just play games?”

Mario was silent, staring at the floor. “You make it sound so simple,” he muttered.

“It isn’t.” Luigi let out a long sigh. “But it’s better than chasing illusions.”

A heavy pause fell between them. Mario’s fingers stilled. “Do you think I don’t want that? Of course I do. But… it’s not for everyone, Lu. Love. Real love. Maybe some people just aren’t built for it.”

“Or maybe,” Luigi said, watching him, “you’re just tired, brother. You’ve been searching so hard that you’ve run out of… well, lives. And now, you’re afraid there’s no more in you to try.”

Mario’s eyes flickered, a faint trace of vulnerability surfacing. “Maybe.”

For a few weeks, Mario went quiet. He stopped the chases, kept his days empty, but the loneliness hit harder than he expected. And with it came a strange fear—that he might go on forever in this hollow limbo, never reaching anyone.

One evening, he found himself in a small jazz bar, sipping a drink and listening to the music as it thrummed low and steady, filling the air with something comforting. That’s when he noticed her—someone sitting alone, watching the same stage with a quiet intensity, absorbed and present.

He felt a pull, something simple, but different. He hadn’t felt anything so gentle in years. Summoning the last fragments of courage, he approached her, offered a tentative smile. “Mind if I join you?”

She looked up, amused, but there was a kindness in her eyes that put him at ease. “Sure,” she said, and gestured to the seat beside her. They spoke easily, drifting from music to books to memories of places they’d each called home. There was no rush, no empty thrill, only a calm warmth that felt like homecoming.

When he walked her to her door that night, she looked at him with a gaze that felt as though she could see his entire story—the weariness, the defeats, the little triumphs—and yet, she smiled. “Maybe I’ll see you again,” she said, and there was an invitation in her voice, quiet but unmistakable.

Mario left, heart racing, yet he felt a strange sense of peace. He hadn’t known it was possible to feel this way anymore. But as he walked back under the streetlights, a small voice whispered that this was his chance—a chance to be real, to stop playing for points, to put down the game.

When he met Luigi for coffee the next morning, his brother noticed a subtle change. “So… another one?” Luigi teased gently, though there was a glimmer of hope in his eyes.

“No,” Mario replied, shaking his head slowly. “I think this one’s different.” He paused, then added, almost to himself, “And I think… I’m ready.”

Luigi clapped a hand on his shoulder, his smile warm. “One life left, brother. Make it count.”

I have wanted a Christmas village since I was little, but have always been too poor to even think about it. Well, I’m not now, and I was very excited to get one for my mantle this year. My husband was very excited about it too and even told me last night that it made him very happy to see me happy.

Today, we took our 7 month old to the ER. He tested positive for a bunch of things. Long story short, he’s been very sick the past few days and it has been stressful. There’s a Starbucks in the hospital we were at, and my husband and I had barely gotten sleep last night so I offered to go get us some. I just wanted a coffee. He said he did too but he was too scared of being alone with our baby in the ER room. I was a bit upset by this because I was so tired and just wanted a coffee, and I’m also expected to be alone with him all the time and don’t complain about it. Well, when I expressed that I was upset I couldn’t get a coffee, he told me that he “let me” get that Christmas village yesterday and that I should just be thankful for that instead of complaining about a coffee. I said that if he was going to hold the village over my head then I wish we never would have bought it in the first place. 

I told him that’s like me saying he can’t have a drink of the gas station because he just bought a new keyboard (which has happened many times. Keyboards/any music gear is NOT cheap). He told me to “think about what I said,” in a condescending tone and honestly he just made me feel like a child throwing a tantrum at this point. Am I being dramatic? Or am I justified?

* Litesmith [Polypropylene Cold Soak Container](https://www.litesmith.com/cold-soaking-jars/), XL (I think it was the XL one)
* MSR Titan Kettle (850ml), older revision
* SOTO windmaster with tri-flex pot stand (might try the BRS again if trying to reduce setup volume)
* Homemade reflectix cozy that fit over the Litesmith pot

I really liked being able to rehydrate meals with the litesmith container in the cozy as I could repackage and cleanup was easy as you could just shake, shake, shake and drink down the tea after meals.

One area of improvement is that I would love for the pot to be nearly the same diameter as the cold soak container in order to have the kit take up less space in the pack -- the litesmith container nests fine but has too much room which wastes pack space.  Additionally, having the same diameter could mean that I could use the same cozy on the pot or the cold/hot soak container (I'll usually just do coffee in the pot so it doesn't taste like last nights dinner).

I'm wondering if anyone has done this combo with a pot just above the container outside diameter (94mm / 3.70in).  I have a toaks 750ml and the container starts to nest inside but doesn't fit completely leaving a couple inches.  It's tricky to find spec sheets with the inside and outside diameter of the pots and, ideally, the ID of the pot would be within a few millimeters of the cold soak container OD.

Nesting the pot inside the cold soak container would likely mean that a small fuel canister would no longer nest, so that's a no go.",1,1730670212.0,Ultralight,2,1.0,False

My father’s funeral was a year ago Friday. I had returned the first week in April 2023 for three days to see him in the hospital and help support him transitioning going on dialysis. I never left, losing the complete contents of my apartment and car in NYC.

Until he died late last October it was a fraught cycle of doing poorly, hopefulness that he was getting better, and the bottom dropping out. I had not been in my childhood home during the entire 21st century. When it looked like he could come home to recuperate in July I carved out the living room and dining room that had never been used since moving in in 1970 and contained, chest level and down, the worst of the hoard. 

My mother survived the first year after his death. I had pushed what remained of the hoard into the recreation room. She continues to decline and I now need to make that room an all in one studio type apartment for her since mobility has radically decreased and become more compromised. I been dragging my feet dreading do it since she will be right there in the space as well.

Due to mobility issues and her refusal to leave the house she needed to do a mail in ballot for the election. I keep trying to give her as much autonomy as possible and gave it to her.

Yes, I know that it was a big mistake and I paid dearly for it, let me tell you. When I went to collect it, the outer most envelope with the her official name on it was missing. In its place, (somehow?????) was the unused one from last fall with my father’s name on it, because, of course things like this happen in hoarder houses. 

Motherfucker! I have spent about 35 hours this week going through the hoard, container by container, pile by pile looking for the outside mail in envelope for the ballot that has her name label on it. 

I  worked methodically like a clock around the room. I still hadn’t found it when I got back to the beginning. I was going to have to go through a disgusting garbage bag, and there still was the chance it had gone out in last weeks garbage or recycling. 

And then, there was a pile I swore I had gone through before. But then I noticed some of the papers had splashed coffee stains on them, as did some of the other ballot parts she had 

given me earlier. 

Could it be? And there it was, one of the last pieces of paper at the bottom of the pile!!! 

I am literally driving it to the post office in the county seat tomorrow morning. I can’t technically drop it off at the voting office since it isn’t my actual ballot.

Of course we are in Pennsylvania where every fucking vote counts, and if KH would have lost by one vote because I didn’t find it, it would have killed me.

I am mentally, physically, and emotionally exhausted and despite large doses of pseudoephedrine allergy medication having severe reactions in my eyes, nose, throat, chest and lungs. I barely slept last night.

After dating for a year and a half, I had a hard boundary I set with my therapist that I wanted to meet his son and spend the holidays together. My partner should have told her earlier, but since his ex-wife only found out about me last month, she absolutely forbid bringing another woman into their special needs son’s life. I have nothing against her and love that they’re both so involved with their son, but I also want to be involved in every aspect of my partner’s life, and this was a huge chunk I wasn’t invited to. I didn’t want to spend another Christmas away from him. I want to have a family, and be part of a family, so being able to celebrate the holidays together really matters to me. I can’t get over the image of him and his ex-wife “playing house”, sitting around his family’s thanksgiving table, with no mention of me.

We just came to a point yesterday and left the door open to try again, but in his mental health journey, he’s only able to focus on being a dad right now… Not a partner to me. He’s not doing well, he’s sick and hurting. We both ugly cried yesterday. We both know it’s the right thing to do but it hurts so much. He even said he was proud of me for sticking to my boundaries. I wish the timing of it all was different, his heart is so good and so pure, and even though it wasn’t always great, he always tried. I always tried too. We love each other so deeply. We both said we would continue to support each other if either of us felt suicidal or got sick (we both deal with depression pretty heavily).

 I’m finally able to get off the couch but I’m crying the whole time. Just leaking tears. We loved our Sundays together. We would watch church, have coffee, cuddle, watch football together… now I’m just alone with my dog, crying. Not because anything was really wrong, but because there was no future for us unless he had the courage to change things to include “us”, and he didn’t.

I'm also a new writer so don't be to harsh plz 🙏

Here:

A tall and bony man walked through the streets of New York. He wore a suit that was snugly fitted to his body and had a badge on the right side of his chest that showed his name, ""Edward."" Edward carried a briefcase in his left hand and a cup of coffee in his right, waiting for it to cool down before he could take a sip. As Edward kept walking, he passed a homeless man holding a sign that read,

***""Anything will help.""***

Edward felt pity for him, but for some reason, he didn’t give the man any money, even though he had some change in his pocket from the coffee he bought just minutes ago. As he kept walking, he saw a woman being mugged by someone. Edward didn't agree with what the mugger was doing, and he could have stopped him, but he didn’t and just kept walking.

As Edward took a few more steps, he realized his coffee had probably gotten cool enough to drink. So, Edward brought the cup to his face, and just as he was about to take a sip. A car hit him. It had lost control when someone ran right into the middle of the road. That someone was the same mugger who was trying to escape after stealing the woman’s purse.

People began to circle around Edwards body, trying to help him. But it was useless; he was dead. He had been run over at very high speeds, and his body was completely crushed. Now it was sinking in. If he had just stopped the mugger, maybe he wouldn’t be dead.

But wait... if he was dead, how was he thinking? Was he really dead, or was he somehow still alive? As time passed, Edward's eyes started opening up. Edward expected to be in a hospital bed or maybe an ambulance, but to his surprise, he woke up to neither of those things.",0,1730669059.0,fantasywriters,5,0.5,False
1gixnbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/askvan/comments/1gixnbt/old_school_dating_asking_men_for_their_number/,Old School Dating - asking men for their number instead of using dating apps. ,"I (31F) recently moved to Vancouver. I want to get back into dating, but I’d rather have fun with it, and dating apps just aren’t my thing.

I’m not into the nightlife scene, and since I don’t drink or smoke, meeting people isn’t as easy as it used to be. I’d say I’m attractive, healthy, fit, educated, and I’ve got my life together. I’m also a genuinely good person.

I spend most of my free time outdoors (dog parks and trails), at the gym or rec center, or hanging out at coffee shops.

So here’s what I’m wondering:

1.	Would it be okay if I just started a conversation with a guy and asked for his number? I feel like a lot of men hold back these days because they don’t want to come off as creepy.
	
2.	And where else could I hang out if I want to meet someone more naturally?

1gixln8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gixln8/the_brutalist_hotel/,The brutalist hotel,"I don’t believe the brutalist hotel still functions. I think it once did. I get that feeling from the yellowed plaster, and the brown stains on the ceiling tiles tell me a lot of smoking once took place here. The coffee-colored linoleum in the dormitory wing is pockmarked with ancient cigarette burns as well.

The brutalist hotel lies near the north end of the dream version of the city where I live. I first found myself there via the lurches in time and geography that always thwart my travels in my dreams. As usual, I was headed for a bar. There are several bars in the dream version of the city where I live that are dear to me. Rarely do my dreams allow me to get there, and, even when they do, I’m rarely permitted more than a glance through the door. Otherwise, I guess I wouldn’t know they exist at all.

In this instance, I was headed to a bar just north of the train station in the dream version of the city where I live. I had lucked out in finding my way out of the train station and I was frantically making my way there. My pace is always frantic in my dreams. This particular bar is not my favorite, but it has a second-stringer charm that one sometimes desires.

The train station is a terrible place. It contains an impossibly long row of menacing brass turnstiles that are automated by some inscrutable machinery. They click and turn of their own accord. Above each turnstile is a mechanical display, with rustling numerals that constantly change according to no logical pattern I can discern. The tumbling numbers sound like shuffling cards and angry hornets.

I hate the train station. The people there are blurry phantoms, and very unhelpful. They take pleasure in being unhelpful. They want you to be confused. Unlike the bars, my dreams always permit me to spend lots of time in the train station.

The people in the bars have definition. Their faces are clear and tangible, with deep lines and creases. The bars are working-class, and the patrons are mostly male. They rarely smile but they are kind. They are drunks. They sip shots with their beers and smoke endlessly. They are not phantoms. If I needed help, they would help me, if my dreams ever allowed me to talk to them. They cuss good-naturedly at each other and tell the kinds of jokes that are banal but make one feel secure.

When I say the brutalist hotel no longer functions, I do not mean it is uninhabited. I have come across at least four tangible inhabitants, as well as plenty of phantoms that whisper and gibber and generally do nobody any harm, though I am not sure that they do not intend harm. What unnerves me the most about the brutalist hotel is the fact that it looks like it once contained multitudes. There used to be company there, and now there isn’t.

The lobby of the brutalist hotel is nearly the size of a modest hockey stadium. A tiny cubicle right by the door contains the first tangible inhabitant I have met: the watchman. He is bald, somewhere between sixty and seventy years of age. He wears hornrimmed glasses with thick lenses. He is surly and smells like cabbage, because he cooks sauerkraut and potatoes in a small, cheap aluminum pot on a hotplate which sits on a tiny shelf behind him. Above the hotplate is a Stihl calendar from 1987, featuring jaundiced nude women with perms and garter belts. I like the guy, but he doesn’t seem to like anyone. Sometimes he challenges me with gibberish questions. Sometimes he just glances up at me with mild disgust. He watches old sitcoms, dubbed into Czech or German, on a portable TV. I can’t see the tiny black and white screen, but I always get the feeling it’s something like Step by Step or Perfect Strangers. The laugh track does not make him smile.

I saw him smile once, though. One awful night I found a screeching, dying chicken in a dim corner of the stadium-sized lobby, on the dirty tile floor near a tatty old sofa and a stale, aluminum standing ashtray. It lay on its side. I tried in vain to pick it up, but it continued screeching as it turned ash-gray and my fingers penetrated its body. Its body crumbled sickeningly under my touch.

I looked across the vast expanse of the lobby and cried to the watchman for help. He sighed and came out of his cubicle. I saw he was wearing shorts and rubber sandals over bare feet. As he came over in imperious strides, I stood up, the ashy matter of the chicken coating my fingers, and pointed to the mess on the floor. I tried to make myself understood, but I didn’t speak his language. He looked at the chicken and laughed in an almost lascivious way. He grinned and elbowed me in the ribs, making remarks in some dialect that seemed halfway between Slovak and Polish. It was obvious by the nudging and the leering that the remarks were unseemly.

The stairwells are the worst part of the brutalist hotel. Sometimes the stairs take you to the next floor up. Sometimes they take you back to the lobby, in which case the brutalist hotel is nothing more than an infinite stack of lobbies. That is so hateful. Sometimes they take you someplace else. Once, they took me to a large, dark cabin in a logging camp in winter, where my dead uncle threatened me with a revolver because he thought I was a Nazi. That was a long night. Many times they have taken me to the train station.

The stairwells themselves are almost totally dark. They contain most of the brutalist hotel’s phantoms. I also once met an old woman in a headscarf on one of the landings. The landings are as large as most people’s bedrooms. She was standing behind a folding table in the near darkness, selling a pitiful assortment of fruits and vegetables. She was nice to me. She chatted amiably about the quality of her produce, but it was all sad, mushy, and wrinkled. I fished a few cents from my pocket and bought a pear. Later, as I progressed up a flight of stairs, I accidentally dropped it. It rolled down the stairs and became lost in the darkness. I worried about that. I didn’t want her to find it and think that I had considered her pear not good enough. Not that I had had any intention of eating it: I just didn’t want her feelings to be hurt. My dreams often consist of my trying hard not to hurt or disappoint other people.

On one of the middle floors of the brutalist hotel is an open conference room. It has two sets of double doors that are always propped open. It’s actually not very large. It’s always dark in there. I don’t know if the lights work or not. I’ve never tried to turn them on. The floor is orange linoleum. The walls are white stucco, with a swath of beige around the bottom four feet. It is furnished with square particle board tables and straight back chairs. 

The windows in the conference room are so hateful. I know, intellectually, that if I look out of them I will see nothing but a dark street, and a sidewalk lit by dim, yellow streetlights. Yet I dread those windows. They will show me the faces I see in the bathroom tiles, the faces the trees make through the thin fabric of my bedroom curtains during the morning of the hangover, the faces that dwell behind my eyelids during the night of the hangover.

On an upper floor of the brutalist hotel, behind an unmarked door, is a log cabin. I know. I’ve seen it. I was lucky enough to get there once. My dreams let their guard down. Now, they try to convince me I was mistaken, but I know that’s a lie. I’ve been there. I’m not foolish enough to think I’ll ever get back there, but my dreams will never convince me it was an illusion.

My Aunt Fay was in that cabin. She was just getting ready to go on a trip to Natural Bridge when I came bounding in. She said my name in surprise and laughed, as was her way in life. There was a creek rock fireplace with a roaring fire and an old gas range nearby. She heated up a can of Chef Boyardee Roller Coasters with meatballs in a battered old tin pan for me. Then my hateful dreams propelled me back to waking life. It didn’t take my dreams long to realize their error--but, still, they slipped up.

I think it’s on the same floor--maybe one above, maybe one below--where the dormitory wing is. It lies behind heavy steel double doors with frosted glass. It reeks of stale cigarette smoke, but no one is there anymore. The doors of the rooms are heavily padded and covered in maroon vinyl, studded with rivets, as if they were government offices. But they’re not: they’re dorms. I know because I once forced my way into one.

My dreams had played with my feelings one too many times. Every few months or so I get strength in my dreams. Despite the slow, underwater movements that confront almost everyone in these fearful situations, now and then we can power through, through our sheer frustration. I forced a padded door open and was confronted by a small entrance hall. To my left was a bathroom and a separate WC. In front of me and to my right were doors leading to the two bedrooms.

Moonlight shone through the frosted glass in the door in front of me, so that’s where I went. I opened the door and the cold moonlight spilled onto the coffee-colored linoleum. One twin bed was stripped and empty. The other contained a desiccated corpse wrapped in a heavy duvet.

The corpse raised its head and roared at me. I fled the room in terror.

I recount these episodes because they are a break from monotony. In reality, this is what the brutalist hotel means: monotony. Usually I see no more than the lobby, or the awful stairwell. I would actually like to explore the brutalist hotel more, but my hateful dreams rarely permit it. Still, I have deduced, through the mysterious omniscience that often accompanies one in dreams, that somewhere in this hotel there is a restaurant, and even a bar. I believe they are usually empty, but I have a slim hope that sometimes they are not.

I believe that everyone from my life--past, present, and future--is in the brutalist hotel, but it is so vast, I do not believe I shall ever find even one of them, apart from my Aunt Fay. The dreams really let themselves down with that one. Our dreams exist to make us miserable, of that I am convinced, and they will not let that brief, stolen beauty slide. That is why I fear death. I know, when the time comes, my dreams will carry me into the conference room, and force me to look out the dreaded windows, and wait to see whatever deferred horror I shall see.

I will wait for the faces, the whispers, the shadow at the foot of my bed, the dead classmate weeping in the armchair, and it will remain, forever, in the hallway, just out of sight.",2,1730668889.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1gixkkp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gixkkp/i_like_my_boss_but_not_sure_if_i_should_pursue/,"I like my boss, but not sure if I should pursue. ","Started a job almost a year ago. Since my first day, I feel like there was a mutual attraction. He was super friendly then, and still is. For context I'm 27 and he's 29. He makes it a point to come towards me out of a group to chop it up, adorably lights up when he sees me and speaks to me for the first time at work for the day... plus I've heard from other sources that's he's at the very minimum, attracted to me.

So my dilemma is that I'm still interested in him. I know for a fact he's interested in me, just not sure if it's purely physical attraction on his side. I'm not interested in hooking up with him, or anyone. He doesn't get around work (I've already asked around when I first started and still checks out). Not my normal type at all, but I enjoy being around him and I enjoy how I feel when I'm around him.

Would it be wise to propose coffee as work friends so we can sorta kill the mystery and learn simple basics like "" are you in a relationship?"" for starters. Personally I wouldn't mind initiating that since he's my work superior and I think it's easier for me to put myself out there in this specific case. 

OR

Leave it alone because:

- don't shit where you eat
- if he wanted to, he would
- he could very well be in a relationship

1gixjvk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gixjvk,Upgraded from $500 to $2500 Set Up ,"Upgraded recently to this set up from Sage Barista - I love it - reason I went for Bianca was dual boiler and look of the machine. 

So far my thoughts, for what they are worth as I know it’s a common step for a lotta people !

Coffees taste more sophisticated - closer to a good coffee from a cafe 

The milk steaming is a huge value add

I rarely steam milk whilst I pull a shot - thought I would so bought DB 

Grinder is epic I love it - was going to get a niche and single dose but got scammed on Facebook market place !!! And then found this and fits my workflow well (full bag of beans and run through all of them)

Milk steaming is way way better 

Lots of chat about heat up times - I have a smart plug and get the machine to heat up for the morning - ngl it’s quite annoying waiting 20 mins for a coffee sometimes - but I think I am adjusting to it - the whole theatre of making a coffee is a fun faff. 

These Amazon scales are well built and usb c is great and around £22 

The nice thing about the smart plug is when I have my morning coffee the top coffee mugs are really hot - which the sage did not do. 

I pull 3 back to back shots around 1 time a week and it’s nice to have the ability to do that as the sage couldn’t 

The paddle on the Lelit is cool but haven’t got stuck into that yet - but do feel like a pro when ramp up the pressure - feel like a dj at his first gig 

Is all that worth £2000 ?

Really not sure tbh but love this set up

1gixi5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gixi5i/aita_for_leaving_a_discord_server/,AITA for leaving a Discord server? ,"I'm a 39F who was invited to attend a traditional event, a Satak, by my friend ""Melvin"" (35M), whom I know from an online game community. I've played with him and several others in this group for about seven years, and I've known everyone attending the event for around four. The people I was looking forward to meeting were Melvin; another woman, ""Aliza"" (43F); a guy named ""Tripp"" (35M); and my best friend, ""Megan"" (47F), along with her husband, ""Trevor"" (41M).

Over the years, we've spent a lot of time together on Discord, organizing community activities and events. Melvin, Aliza, Tripp, and I were all part of the leadership team for our group. Tripp and I occasionally clashed over game-related issues, but we had recently had a six-hour voice call where we talked deeply about life. For example, he asked me if I wanted kids and then pointed out that my ""clock is ticking."" This event would be the first time we’d all meet in person.

On the day of the event, Tripp sent me a selfie and a text practicing our names, which made me feel like he was looking forward to meeting too. Once we arrived, though, we were seated at different tables. I was with Megan and Trevor, and Aliza briefly greeted us before turning away to talk exclusively to her date, her back facing us for about three hours. I had mentioned to everyone beforehand that I have social anxiety and need a few minutes to warm up in new settings, so it felt awkward and isolating that Aliza didn't engage with anyone else.

The ceremony itself was beautiful, and I felt honored to be there. I finally met Melvin in person, and we chatted briefly before I returned to my table. At one point, Tripp came over to talk to me, but Aliza quickly pulled him aside. Later, when I tried to approach both of them to say hi, they walked off. When I managed to talk to Tripp alone, he said a few words before walking away, eventually telling me that talking to me felt ""too awkward.""

After the event ended around 4 p.m., I wanted to make the most of my trip, having traveled nearly 500 miles to be there. Since Aliza had also traveled from another country, I hoped we’d all hang out a bit afterward. Tripp and Aliza, who were sharing a hotel room, said they needed a nap but would be up for something later, and Aliza gave Megan her WhatsApp number. I texted both of them a few hours later to see if they wanted to grab a drink, but they declined. Surprised and disappointed, I reached out to Melvin, who invited us over to his family home, assuming I was already with Tripp and Aliza for the night.

The next morning, Aliza headed out of town for the wedding, which was in another city, so she wouldn’t be around. I asked Tripp if he’d like to grab a coffee before leaving, but he declined, saying he needed to head back right away. He had even brought a gift for me but forgot to give it, taking it home instead.

Feeling hurt and confused by how things went, I didn't feel comfortable staying on the Discord server where I'd spent years managing our community with Aliza and Tripp. I needed time to process everything, so I decided to leave the server. I told the other leaders I was stepping back but didn’t fully explain why; I just felt I couldn’t be on the server at that moment. A few days later, I reached out to Tripp, hoping to talk things through and maybe rejoin. But he responded by saying we ""couldn’t be friends"" and that he ""couldn’t help me.""

I chose not to involve Melvin, as I didn’t want to pull him into the drama between Aliza, Tripp, and myself. Melvin does now blame me for bring drama to his wedding becuase I left the discord server.

I’ve been using a Delonghi Stilosa for three years, alongside a Picopresso for better espresso shots. I also have a KingGrinder K6 and mostly make cortados for myself and straight espressos for my husband (who isn’t as coffee-obsessed as I am).

My husband suggested I upgrade, but I’m trying to keep it under $1000 due to budget. I’ve been looking at the **Gaggia Classic Pro**, **Turin Legato**, and **Profitec Go** (though the color options on the Profitec do push it over $1K—yes, I’m tempted).

A few thoughts: the Legato seems a bit cheaply made, and it’s pretty new, so I’m hesitant. I like the Gaggia Classic, but it has its quirks, and I’m worried it might be too finicky for my husband to use. I’m also considering modding it over time, but I’m curious if a modded Gaggia holds up in build quality compared to the Profitec Go.

Would love any recommendations or advice, especially from anyone with experience modding the Gaggia or using the Profitec Go. I’m sticking with the hand grinder for now since it’s doing a solid job. Thanks in advance!",2,1730668548.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

**KNIGHT’s BASH**

**Damage increased by 500%**

**Bone shattered**

**Fatal Wound Inflicted**

 

Will cracked the wolf’s ribcage, sending it flying to the ceiling. In the back of the room, “**Level up**” appeared on all four mirrors. This presented an interesting Catch 22. In order to level up, he had to tap one of the mirrors. However, in order to reach them, he had to defeat the rest of the wolves. Thankfully, the knight skills made up for the lack of evasion. Clutching the desk, he looked at the remaining beasts.

The fate of the first had made them more cautious. Two circled along either side of the classroom while the third remained in place, growling as it stared at him with its menacing silver eyes.

The lack of space had given Will an initial advantage, but that would change if he were attacked from several sides. Aiming to prevent that, the boy hurled the desk at the leftmost wolf, then quickly grabbed another.

Seeing its chance, the central wolf leaped forward. This presented something of a dilemma. Will could try to swing the desk upwards in an attempt to bash the creature, but that would leave him dangerously exposed to the final wolf. If he didn’t, though, he risked getting bitten by his immediate attacker.

The first desk slammed into the wall, barely nicking the wolf’s leg. That wasn’t the result that Will was hoping for, but there was no time to worry about it. Shielding himself from the frontal attack with the desk he held, he then rushed forward. Even with the powers of two classes, he needed to take advantage of the level up.

Jaws snapped close to his face as the nearby wolf attempted a quick attack before leaping away. The creatures were cautious not to follow the fate of their killed pack mate. Thankfully, that worked to the boy’s advantage. Swinging the desk in front of him he turned around, slowly retreating towards the mirrors. The growling increased as all three wolves slowly advanced in their respective directions.

*We’ll see how tough you are once I have leap and evasion,* the boy thought. Glass crunched beneath his feet as he moved back. Seeing the remnants of the display cases from the corner of his eye, Will reached out with his left hand and tapped a mirror.

All messages disappeared, replaced by two words: ROGUE and KNIGHT.

Not expecting this development, the boy turned his head around. It was an instinctive reaction, but one that proved enough to get one beast to leap at him.

*Oh, shit!* The boy swung around, throwing the desk at his attacker to compensate. This time, the desk hit the wolf head on, pinning it to the wall behind. It was safe to say that another creature had been dealt with. Sadly, that left Will completely exposed to the remaining two.

*Rogue!* He reached out to tap the word. This was the only viable option. If he messed up now, he’d have to repeat the loop all over again and hope that Helen would give him the knight for a second go.

Both remaining wolves leaped forward. Thankfully, Will proved to be faster. The moment his fingers touched the mirror’s surface, the familiar new skills appeared. That was it—the thing he had been hoping for. Before his attackers could reach him, the boy twisted and leaped to the right.

A wolf’s claws passed inches from his face as the creature landed on the spot Will had been.

“How about that?” the boy shouted as he landed gracefully on another toppled desk.

Jumping down, he quickly grabbed a chair and threw it at a monster. This time, the attack was extremely precise, hitting its target from the side. Metal legs pierced the wolf’s rib cage, killing it on the spot. This was the difference between having a skill and not. The motion was exactly the same as before, but his mind and body instinctively knew how to get the best result, as if he had spent years developing his ability.

The mirrors in the room changed again, displaying a new “Level up” message. Apparently, it took two killed wolves to advance him further. Not that there was any point in leveling up now. With one wolf remaining, everything was in Will’s favor. Well, almost everything. Already he could hear the yells of people outside the room. Ms. Stalter had gotten hysterical, screaming unintelligently, while someone else—a teacher by the sound of it—was trying to calm her down by yelling louder.

“Just you and me now.” The boy grabbed another chair, then tore off the piece of metal tube that composed a pair of metal legs. There was no logical reason for him not to kill the creature from a distance, yet for some reason, he felt that wouldn’t be fair.

The wolf didn’t appreciate the sentiment, backing off slowly amid the devastated classroom.

“You have to fight me.” Calmly, Will moved forward to follow. “There’s no way you can escape.”

Technically, it was possible for the beast to leap out of the classroom. Despite it being the third floor, the distance to the ground wasn’t that high to harm a creature this size. Will himself knew that he could jump down without issue—probably another bonus of the rogue’s leap.

Passing by the mirrors, he tapped on one with his left hand. Once the message changed, he tapped again on the rogue.

 

**SUPERIOR BALANCE**

**Maintain perfect balance under any circumstances.**

 

**SUPERIOR SIGHT**

**See well at greater distances and less light.**

 

**DUAL WIELD**

**Use two weapons simultaneously.**

 

The skills were interesting, though not anything that could be of immediate use. Both sides knew that the fight was a foregone conclusion.

The circling continued for another ten seconds, at which point Will took the initiative, charging at the beast. The wolf snapped its jaws in a final attempt to do some harm before going down. Thanks to his rogue’s evasion, the boy easily avoided the attempt, sinking the metal leg into its chest.

 

**KNIGHT’s BASH**

**Damage increased by 500%**

**Fatal Wound Inflicted**

 

A loud crack followed, after which the wolf stumbled to the ground.

For several seconds, the boy stood there, breathing heavily. Now that the immediate threat was gone, normal sensations flooded in. His hands trembled uncontrollably for a few moments as bouts of panic and realization exploded in his mind like fireworks.

This was the first time he had killed and lived till the end. Unlike games and movies, part of his mind rebelled against it. He knew that he had no choice. He also knew that this wasn’t real death since it would be erased at the end of the loop, and still, he couldn’t snap out of it.

“I think the noises stopped,” someone said outside the room, bringing Will back to reality.  

A new fear pumped adrenalin into his blood—a fear of having to explain everything that was going on. With each killed wolf extending the length of the loop, he’d be stuck giving explanations for close to an hour, if not more.

The handle turned. Seeing it, Will quickly leapt to the only open window in the room, then jumped outside. The combination of rogue’s leaping and knight’s sturdiness let him land on the stone pavement below as if he had hopped off a bike.

The few students in view were so busy rushing for the school entrance that they didn’t even notice. Even if someone did, their mind would reject what it had seen. After all, everyone knew that people couldn’t jump from the third floor and continue about their day as if nothing had happened.

Will’s phone suddenly rang. Not being in the mood for talking, he ignored it. It didn’t take a genius to know that in a matter of minutes, the whole school would turn into a madhouse. The police would arrive, possibly the firefighters as well, followed by the news media, concerned parents, local officials, and anyone remotely curious what was going on. Given that Ms. Stalter knew that Will was involved in the fight, this was the last place he wanted to be.

The phone rang again. The boy swiped to cancel the call, then turned the power of the device off. He could do with an hour or two off the grid. In fact, he knew just the place to go until the chaos of the loop subsided. Hands in his pockets, he left the school grounds.

About a minute later, he was sitting in the familiar coffee shop, enjoying a nice cup of mousse and a cup of water.

“Things sure have gotten lively,” the barista said as the sound of sirens passed by. “Cops and now ambulances. Sure hope everyone’s alright.”

“I hope so,” Will muttered. He knew for a fact that they were, unlike in the last loop. “Probably some lab experiment gone bad.”

“Lab experiment?” The barista turned around and gave him a stern look. “Should I be worried having you here?”

“Hey, I can pay,” the boy uttered the first thing that came to mind. Thankfully, that had the desired effect. The barista turned around, focusing on the commotion again.

Several police cars had arrived and diligently started blocking off some of the streets around Enigma High School. The building was cordoned off, allowing only ambulances and firetrucks inside. There didn’t seem to be any smoke or fire, but one of the trucks parked in the inner yard.

Rumors spread like wildfire, filling the imagination. According to some of the more outlandish ones, wolves, or large dogs, had been running down the hallways, biting anyone in sight. Soon enough, people on the street were sharing their speculations about what really happened.

“One more of these,” Will said, pointing to his empty glass of mousse.

This was his third so far, along with two jugs of water, and yet the loop had no inclination to end. It was already a quarter to ten, suggesting that each dead wolf provided a twenty-minute extension at least.

“Don’t you have anywhere to be?” the barista asked with a shrug. Still, he did see to the order. Money was money, after all.

“Like school?” the boy smirked.

“Like a friend’s or parents’ place? It’s not healthy staying at a coffee shop on your own.”

“People do it all the time.”

“I know.” The barista placed the cup of mouse in front of Will, then took the empty one. “And it’s a terrible habit. Trust me, I studied this stuff. It might seem cool in the short run, but it’s only masking the real problem. Whatever that might be.”

The boy considered telling him. That might be good for a laugh.

“You remind me of another boy who used to come here alone a few times per week. Always kept to himself, barely said a word, just used to scribble in his diary all the time.” The man turned on the water behind the counter and started washing the empty mousse cup. “He started off okay, just like you, then got worse and worse, until his father came here to drag him out.”

Will sat there, patiently waiting for the barista to get to the point.

“Haven’t seen him since. So, the moral of the story is: make good decisions or someone else will make them for you. By that I mean, next time, bring a friend or two.”

“Right.” He should have expected that. Of course, he’d want to boost his business. As if Helen would agree going to a place like this.

Feeling the effects of the many jugs of water he had consumed since getting here, the boy looked around. He wanted to go to the bathroom badly, but after what he’d just been through, he had to make sure it wasn’t a corner room.

“Where’s the bathroom?” he asked.

“Right in the back.” The barista pointed.

Although slightly to the side, the door was still facing the entrance. That was good enough for Will, who quickly rushed there.

A smell of mint air freshener filled the space. The room was small, containing a sink with a single faucet, a large mirror, and a closed off section for the toilet itself. Will was just about to head there when a green message appeared in the mirror.

 

**WOLF PACK REWARD (random)**

**FAST HEALING: wounds and health conditions will heal 100 times faster.**

 

For a moment, Will forgot about his bladder, staring at the mirror. There was a reward for killing off the entire pack. If he had paid attention before jumping out of the window, maybe he would have seen it. More importantly, why hadn’t Daniel or Helen mentioned it? Getting bonus abilities for killing off wolves was a pretty big deal. Then again, maybe that was precisely why it was kept secret.

*You kept it from her,* the boy thought.

From what he could see on the desk, Daniel had meticulously marked all the rooms, as well as the individual mirrors they held and yet there was no mention of those in the biology classroom or the reward? Apparently, Helen wasn’t the only one with trust issues. And, if Daniel had kept this hidden, what other secrets did he have?

1gixcil,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1gixcil/oxytocin_wins_over_dopamine/,Oxytocin Wins Over Dopamine,"Dear Husband,

This one is for you.

When I first met you, there were no butterflies, no ""hit me like a truck"" feeling. It was just me and the guy my mom was pushing me to meet, who could be ""good for me."" Everything up until then related to love was fueled by dopamine. At that point, I was undiagnosed with ADHD and didn't know my brain was dopamine-deficient. I did anything to seek it—the chase, the thrill of new love, the angst, the pining—my brain loved it, craved it, needed it. No wonder nothing worked out for me until you.

I still remember that day. I was pretty upset at my mom for blaming me for ""getting attention from some guy because of what I wore."" I came to you to complain, and you said, ""Well, it is not your problem if he looks at you. You shouldn't change how you look for some creep."" It was small and insignificant, but it was the first brick in the oxytocin pedestal you would build for me and place me on for the rest of my life.

You stood up for me when your family wasn't very supportive. Another brick.

You tiptoed around, making breakfast and lunch for me in the morning, quietly leaving for work without disturbing me after I passed out working on an assignment until 3 a.m. on the daybed. Another brick.

You advocated for me when the doctors thought I was exaggerating my symptoms of hyperemesis gravidarum during my pregnancy, until it was officially diagnosed. Another brick.

It was just you and me during COVID, handling pregnancy, postpartum, childbirth, and raising a baby together. Another brick.

You patiently handled my emotional dysregulation over losing a board game. Another brick.

You gave me space to heal, make mistakes, and learn lessons because it was my path. You know I hate being forced to do something—something I dealt with all my life until I moved out of my parents' home, and it triggers me. Another brick.

You knew I hated having friends over to a messy home, but I ended up sleeping while putting the baby to bed, and you cleaned without me asking because you didn't want to wake me. Another brick.

You built our mortgage payment plan in a way that avoided my demand avoidance (another freaking ADHD symptom). Another brick.

You didn't mock me but asked, ""How can I support you?"" after my late ADHD diagnosis. Another brick.

Brick by brick, you built me an oxytocin pedestal that I could sit on to receive love—feeling safe, secure, and warm.

Recently, I went through an emotional turmoil. I started to question everything. I wasn't sure what was happening to me. I partially blame my dopamine-deficient ADHD brain and partially my bad luck for everything that happened. I felt confused, abandoned, lost, and broken into a million pieces, *being pulled in two directions at once*.

While on the outside everything looked fine, I felt like I was falling into an abyss with no return. You gave me space to figure out my feelings while providing enough support and distractions to keep me from going to a dark place. Another brick.

I was asking the universe for some sign—some sign that would help me get back up and *want to choose the right thing* because my brain was going crazy.

In a time when I felt abandoned by my ADHD and was kicking myself for *feeling* things because of it, you casually approached me yesterday while we were making our morning coffee and said, ""Oh, by the way, I signed up for an ERG for neurodivergence at work today.

First of all, thanks for stroking my ego and making me feel like a gem when I don’t think I’m anything remotely close to it. During a time when I felt unworthy of your love, you did it again. You lifted me up, adding a slab—not just a brick—and placed me back on the gigantic oxytocin pedestal you have been building for me all these years.

Suddenly, my choice made sense. Oxytocin. I need to trust oxytocin, not dopamine, when choosing love. You have given me that through your actions, your words, and every small thing you’ve done for me in the name of love. I wish, I really wish, I were ""normal."" But I am not. And that is okay. I still think you deserve better, and I promise I will work towards that. Until then, I’m going to sit on the oxytocin pedestal you built for me and thank the universe for this gift.

I've faced sleepless nights, spent hours on walks, and had zero appetite. Breakups are always difficult, but this one feels particularly painful because my ex (it's still hard to say that) never really did me wrong.

I miss her deeply. I miss the laughter we shared, the movie nights, the inside jokes, the comfort of her presence, and our morning coffees together. I know I made the decision to end things, and I have to stand by that choice. While a part of me longs to reach out and reconnect, I recognize that it wouldn’t be the best path forward.

Ultimately, this experience has taught me a lot about myself and what I truly value in a relationship. It's a painful reminder of the importance of communication and growth, both individually and as a couple.

**Note**

This is a long post, but I want to dedicate it to running as a sport. Thank you, running, for changing my life for the better. 



**Background –What Got Me into Running**

I never had a habit of exercising, nor did I ever aspire to be a runner when I was growing up. I was the overweight kid who dreaded and loathed gym classes. Despite this at that time I didn't consider myself a completely sedentary person (LMAO) cause I always enjoyed walking (made a point to myself that I needed to walk every day, even if it was only for 30 mins when busy) and I had a part-time job on the kitchen at a restaurant, so I never stay still all day long.

Fast forward to late 2020 when I got my first full-time office job. Starting a job during Covid lockdown meant I was living in full sedentary mode and after a few months in, I realized how unhealthy this had been as I was on ""wake up-sit from 9-5-doomscrolling-sleep"" mode. So in an attempt to keep myself moving, I started running in 2021. I still remember that first-ever run, I couldn't even run for 1 km without stopping and in total I only ran for 2.92 km. This was a wake-up call for me. My thought was ""I am still in my early 20s and couldn't even run 1 km. Pathetic"".

Thereafter I commited to run 3 days a week, and at that time that was hard. I didn't follow a training plan and was just trying to run as far as I could. By the end of 2021, I could finally run a 5k without stopping. In early 2022, my friends asked if I was interested in joining them running a 10.5km/quarter marathon race scheduled in April. 10.5km distance seemed to be a daunting task for me since I never run more than 5k at that point but I said yes anyway cause I thought this could be a motivation to keep the momentum going. Moving on to the race, not only I was really satisfied with my time (managed to run it in exactly 1 hour) but the feeling and atmosphere of a race were indescribable for me. The anticipation at the start line, the cheers from the crowds, the feeling that you can push yourself through the run, the accomplishment you feel at the finish line - all were too great for me. From that moment on, I know I will sign up for more races in the future.

  
I didn't join any more races in 2022 because I felt like I needed to improve my running before I signed up for more races so I used the remainder of the year to make running part of my routine. Then in early 2023 I finally felt to take it up a notch by signing myself to two races just one month apart: a 10-miler/16km race in September and a half marathon in October. It was also a turning point when I started to take running seriously as I invested in Garmin. By following the built-in training plan in my Garmin, I managed to clock in sub 1.30 in my 16 km race and sub 2 in my first-ever half marathon. I honestly didn't expect that, I would just be satisfied If I could finish my first HM in around 2 hours.

  
Soon the thoughts of signing up for a marathon entered my mind. For sure I had doubts at myself regarding this, a marathon is a formidable challenge in its own right. After talking to some people at the local run club who had ran one, they encouraged me to sign for it. So in January 2024, I made the decision to sign up.



**Training**

First task is to decide which training plan to follow. I couldn't rely on Garmin anymore as the built-in plan maxed out at HM distance. There are tons of free training plans on the internet such as Hal Higdon's, some from other marathon races, like Copenhagen, London, and Paris. While these training plans are not bad, I found that none of them includes a deload week. At the same time, I kept receiving targeted ads of Runna. After reading reviews about it on the internet and hearing the reviews from my friends, I decided to opt for a Runna plan instead. Looking back, it's worth every penny cause it built an integrated training plan for me. Not only the plan included a deload week each month; it also incorporated strength training, mobility, and pilates. In addition, it also defined the paces for my interval, tempo, and long runs. It also synced automatically on my Garmin so all I need was just to run.

As this is my first marathon, the plan was to have a 20-week training plan, which means I should start training by the last week of May. Yet this went out of the window because I had a small injury on my adductors before the training block started. Deep down I was panicking because the plan should have started now but I kept telling myself it was better to dial down the running and recover rather than have the issue re-appeared when training was at its peak. So what I did for the first half of June was rehab exercises, strength training, and swimming. I still ran once a week at this period at easy pace for around 5-7km to see how my adductors were doing. On the second half of June it was getting better so I kept my routine but slowly increased my mileage. Finally on second week of July I could jump back on the plan that Runna set for me.

From that week until the race week, my week consisted of 3-4x runs, 3x 1 hour of strength training, 1x 30 mins mobility session, 1x 30 mins pilates session, and 1x cross training. Here is the outline of how my week usually went:

Monday: rest day

Tuesday: AM strength training, PM easy run

Wednesday: AM mobility, PM cross training (until August this was swimming, from September onwards it was outdoor rowing)

Thursday: AM strength training, PM tempo/interval run (Runna alternates weekly between both)

Friday: AM pilates, PM recovery run (not every Friday)

Saturday: long run

Sunday: strength training

It was not exactly like this every week but that's the gist.

What I did for my easy run was basically zone 2 running. It was not to care about pace but only heart rate, where I aimed to be around 140 bpm and maxing out at 150 bpm when it gets warm and humid. Honestly, it didn't feel so easy at first cause before this I never really committed myself to zone 2 running. This meant I was running usually at pace 7 min/km (even 8 min/km when it was warm, so humbling). But I have learned how to embrace this pace, I just basically lost myself in my own thoughts lol. About the paces for the speedwork, I just need to follow what Runna had set for me, usually around 4.10-4.30 min/km for intervals and 4.45-5.10 min/km for tempo. About the long run, it sets for me to follow marathon pace for some portions of the long run, sometimes it included a 1 km of interval pace, and the rest is on easy pace.

  
Some say although distance-wise a marathon is twice a half marathon, the training is three times harder, even four.  It didn’t take me long to realize that is true because I reached my peak mileage when I trained for half marathon within a month of my marathon training. I tried my best to show up and each time the motivation was not there, discipline kicked in and I told myself I should be thankful for each run as there were others who might not have the opportunity to do this. In the end, I missed only 1 long run cause I already had a ticket to a music festival. My peak week was 4 weeks ahead of the race, peaking at 61 km mileage and I did two long runs above 30 km (33.5 km and 31 km) on this training block.

When it was finally time to taper, I was so glad that I manage to get through the training. It was a 3-week taper where the mileage decreased 25% and then 50%. I still went for strength training but decreased the intensity (same weights, less sets). In the last week of taper (aka the race week) I did two runs, one of which was a shakeout run one day before the race, one toned-down strength training on Monday to help with the taper tantrum, and outdoor rowing.



**Pre-race**

As I never did a proper carb load before, I never imagined how much food I would eat. I was aiming to eat 8-10g of carbs per kg of my body weight for 3 days leading to the race. This meant I would eat 400gr of white rice for lunch and dinner, snacking on bread rolls and jam every hour. I was stuffed. The night before the race, apart from the carb-rich dinner I also downed a 320 Maurten gel mix. I managed to get a relatively good night of sleep, considering how much adrenaline I felt at that point. Woke up at around 6.30, had a breakfast of white toast with jam, a banana, and coffee. After answering the call of nature in the restroom and prepared myself it was time to go. On the way to the Olympic Stadium I downed an electrolyte drink mix and another banana. Here two worlds of Amsterdam collide: the world of sports vs the world of partying, as on the same week there was ADE (Amsterdam Dance Event) where people came to Amsterdam to party. It was funny seeing the metro was packed with runners and those who just finished partying looked hungover and confused about why there were so many runners on Sunday morning. I was proud to be a part of the running world. Arrived at the Olympic Stadium one hour before my start wave started. I expected a long queue at the drop bag but it was okay. It was followed by a last trip to the loo then it was time for warm up. I entered inside the stadium (start area was inside) around 25 mins before my wave started and I felt goosebumps so hard that I wanted to cry, all felt so real. As it was not as cold as expected, there was no need to wear extra layers. Singlet, shorts, and armsleeves were enough already. Around 15 mins before, I downed a Maurten 100 gel and tried to keep moving until it was time.

 

**Race**

Packed with 7 gels and a 650ml bottle filled with electrolytes mix, I crossed the starting line at 9:15. Adrenaline rushed through my body and for the first 2km, I felt good and managed to not start out too fast. At the 2 km mark, as I was running through Vondelpark, reality hits hard that I was running a marathon, 42.2 km of it. It came clear that I need to ran back again to Vondelpark, and I need to ran for the next 40km. I was thinking ""*why I am doing here? I could have chosen to party at ADE with some of my friends but instead I am running a marathon*"". But by the time I ran under Rijkmuseum, those thoughts were gone already and I was back on enjoying the race. Or so I thought.

  
Not long after the first drink station at 5 km point which I walked by, I was hit by something I never experienced on my whole training block: cramps on my right calf. Deep down I started to panic, thinking that a sub 4 marathon was now unattainable. During my training, I experienced niggles on my knees, hip, adductors, but never on my calf. I also didn't neglect my calf on my strength training, calf raises were on the menu every week. So on km 5-6, I stopped for a bit. Honestly my ego took a hit as well as it seemed that I was the only one who stopped at this point. A kind bystander asked if I was okay and I replied with ""I'm fine, just a little cramp on my calf"". He told me to breathe, stretch, take it easy, trust the training, and enjoy the race. As I felt better and started to walk slowly, the kind stranger wished me luck and gave me a thumbs up. Up until km 11, basically it was a battle to calm my mind down over what had happened and to settle into the race.

  
When the race turned from Churcillaan into Rijnstraat, I spotted my friend from my running club among the bystanders. He wished me luck and we hugged for a bit. Apparently that hug was what I needed, not only it helped to clear my mind and focus back to the race, it also set off the runners’ high. Until km 25, I felt nothing but pure joy and fun. The race didn’t felt as a struggle at all and I was able to steadily increase my pace to make up the time that was lost between km 5-10. This part of the race felt like a piece of cake.

 

The runner’s high subsided when the course turned around from along the Amstel to Joan Muskeyweg and Van der Madeweg, as I felt that the RPE (rate of perceived exertion) needed to maintain the pace steadily increased. I realized this as although the gap between the drink stations on km 26 and km 31 is shorter than between km 26 and km 20, that 5 km started to feel like an eternity. I realized that I needed to be strategic and not let my mind defeat me, so I broke up the remainder of the race into three different parts: until km 32, km 32-37, and km 37-finish. This allowed me to keep my pace stable as on my mind I was telling myself to get it through until km 32 and not too stressed about the last 10k.

 

When it was finally 10 km to go, I told myself that finally it was less than an hour to go. I kept telling myself “*you’ve got this. It’s 10 km to go and you’ve run a lot at this distance. 10 km is an easy run so you can definitely nail this*”. It was definitely “mind over matter” mode until the finish line. Some say a marathon is a 32 km warmup and 10 km race, and for me that is true. The RPE that I felt was like running a 10 km race pace although I was running at marathon pace.  

 

When the course turned into Weteringcircuit I could feel that it was getting closer, but the underpass near the Weesperplein metro station around km 36 made the finish line seemed far. I know this is a flat race but the climb from that underpass onto the first half of Torontobrug over the Amstel felt *hard*. It felt like I used every bit of my energy to keep running and ignore the voice in my head telling me to stop. Basically I gaslighted myself that I didn’t eat that much of carbs during carb loading to stop here.

 

I felt a little relieved once I got through the second half of Torontobrug as there was no significant climb until the finish line and it was 5km more on from there. “Less than 30 minutes to go”, I told myself. The run didn’t get easier, but as I downed my last gel and felt the energy from the crowds, I pushed myself until the route turned to Vondelpark.

 

The sight of the Vondelpark entrance gate was a welcoming sight. It was not the finish line yet but I was proud that I managed to get back here again after running for more than 3,5 hours. The temptation to slow down and stop was also there, but I told myself that I had run in this park multiple times before to keep myself going. Once I exited Vondelpark, it was just basically a straight route until the Olympic Stadium. This was when it became clear that I could still finish within 4 hours if I increased the pace a bit. So with every bit of energy left, I pushed myself so I could finish strong. As I ran as fast as I could, I told myself this was all the interval training was for, the last push. And a push it was, according to the pace chart on my Garmin my pace increased from 5:25 min/km to 4:20 min/km in the last 4 minutes of the race. With that, I crossed the finish line and once I realized that I clocked a sub-4 hour in my first marathon, my eyes were full of tears of happiness.



**Post-race**

I tried to keep moving after the finish line so I could meet my friends who were waiting outside the stadium but it became clear that I could walk only very slowly. After stretching a bit, having my bag retrieved from the bag drop and my medals engraved, we walked to nearby restaurant to have celebratory burgers and beers. But after that the challenge was to get home, as a lot of public transport access was closed due to the race which means that I need to walk to Amsterdam Zuid station. The distance is only 1,5 km but I was limping to get there.

On the next few days I was still limping but I forced myself to go for a walk everyday because I know it helped with recovery. I also wore compression socks when I went to sleep for almost a week after the race. It got better every day and I can finally walk up and down the stairs again on the weekend after the race. That being said, I took a complete rest from any sports activities in the first week after the race. I resumed doing sports when I rowed again on Monday (8 days after the race) and my first run back was exactly two weeks after the race. On to the next race!

But when examining how these conclusions were reached, we find discrepancies and rapid judgments that cast doubt on the solidity of the case.

The Thirlwall Inquiry document from the Countess of Chester Hospital ([INQ001d8008](https://thirlwall.public-inquiry.uk/wp-content/uploads/thirlwall-evidence/INQ0018008_09-10.pdf)) outlines Baby O’s cause of death as stemming from complications related to prematurity and associated medical factors. Here’s how the cause of death is recorded:

>**1b.** Rupture of subcapsular haematoma, due to  
**1c.** Prematurity

Its arguable that this fits with the clinical picture, subcapsular haematoma might not cause immediate symptoms but could lead to unexplained deterioration later, leaving medical staff puzzled by a baby’s sudden decline. Note in addition the document also cites:

>**1a.** Significant suboptimal care that is possibly relevant to the outcome,

>**1b.** Failures in care to recognise problems and

>**1c.** A failure to act appropriately

Clearly this document significantly challenges the idea that Child O's death was unexplained.

Later, Dr. Evans, reached his conclusion of inflicted injury almost instantly. Here’s a revealing quote from the Tortoise podcast:

>""I don’t know whether Cheshire police had had difficulties in getting expert opinion. I read about this in May 2017, and I drove up from Carmarthen to meet with them, in July. I said, look, I'll just come up and talk to you. Get me a couple of case notes just to give me an idea of what's going on, and then we'll take it from there. I don’t know if I can help you or not.

>And the case note I got was of a— the last murder case but one actually. And this is the baby who was a triplet, who was a stable, well baby and who'd suddenly collapsed and died and where the post mortem showed serious abnormalities of the liver.

>Immediately, I think within 10 minutes or so of arriving and having a look at these notes and over the coffee, I felt, oh my god. This baby is the victim of inflicted injury.""

Dr. Evans decided in *10 minutes* that this was inflicted harm based on what he perceived as “unexplained” liver trauma. Dr. Marnerides, the prosecution expert largely agreed, claiming he’d only seen such liver trauma in severe physical injury cases, like car accidents or child abuse.

>**Johnson KC:** Just pausing there, the last picture, photograph 10 or slide 10, where the incisions had been made into the liver, which show the haemorrhage extending right into the body of the organ, that is not something one would see?

>**Dr Marnerides:** So I have only seen this extensive haemorrhage in two babies' livers—livers of children, not babies. In road traffic collisions, in accidents with bicycles, you know, the wheel against the abdomen can cause this. And I have seen it in babies in the context of cases—not in the neonatal care unit—babies that have suffered non-accidental type of injury, typically with other injuries to the abdomen and injuries to the brain.

But others see this type of injury differently. A respected pathologist, with over 25 years of experience in neonatal cases, reviewed Baby O’s records and disagreed with Evans’ and Marnerides' interpretation. This pathologist wasn’t part of the trial and chose to stay anonymous due to the controversy, but felt compelled to voice concerns. She stated that the injuries in Baby O’s liver could occur naturally or be caused by medical interventions, such as the umbilical catheter or oxygen deprivation. Her view:

>“I’m not saying that she’s innocent or she’s guilty. What I’m saying is that the way the pathology was presented, that is not convincing to me as a pathologist.”

>""Unless a witness saw non-accidental injury occur, then you can’t say it. So, to say that it is beyond reasonable doubt and that this was not something natural, that this is a non-accidental injury — to put it bluntly, it’s naive to say that. It depends on the opinion and experience you have. I have seen it, but the prosecution expert must never have seen it.""

Given Dr Marnerides claims ""I have only seen this extensive haemorrhage in two babies' livers—livers of children, not babies"", perhaps his views are based on lack of experience. Dr. George Kokai, who performed Baby O’s post-mortem:

>After Baby O died, there was a postmortem done by a very experienced pathologist, Dr. George Kokai. He found Baby O had two haematomas — two spots of internal bleeding in his liver. These are usually caused by injury or surgery, but there are other ways they can be caused. Dr. Kokai said they could have been caused by the umbilical vein catheter, the tube into the baby’s vein through the umbilical stump, that could have damaged the wall of the liver. Or, he said, these haematomas could have been caused by a lack of oxygen. This is rare, but it happens.

Another view is found in Mortiz's book:

>We spoke to one paediatric pathologist who did not play a role in the Letby case but who has seen Baby O’s post-mortem report. The pathologist, who we will call “P”, spoke to us on condition of anonymity. “P”’s assessment was that it wasn’t possible for a pathologist to confirm that Baby O’s death was due to natural causes. “P” also agrees with the prosecution assessment that Baby O’s clinical history shows that he was doing well and his liver injury and death have no obvious explanation. However, “P” is not convinced by Dr Marnerides’ conclusion that Baby O’s liver injury was caused by inflicted trauma similar to a road traffic accident. According to “P”, inflicted trauma would likely produce “one massive injury” on the liver rather than multiple haematomas, as were seen in Baby O’s liver. Also, “P” says that if the liver injury had been the result of inflicted trauma, you would also expect to see injury to the bowel - and yet Baby O’s bowel showed no signs of injury. “Given the relatively small size of an infant’s abdomen, I think it would be very unusual to get localised damage,” “P” told us. “It wouldn’t be unusual to get no bruises on the skin, but you’d expect more of a diffuse injury to the intra-abdominal organs if you’ve had enough force to cause that amount of haemorrhage.”

Furthermore, medical literature supports that liver haematomas in newborns can occur naturally. For example a study from the *Journal of Clinical Medicine* (2022) documented hundreds of cases of similar liver issues in newborns, all occurring naturally, with a fatality rate of 87% due to internal bleeding ([link to study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36233552/)). Note that haematomas are seen in cases of stillborns, where external trauma is of course not a plausible explanation.

In cross-examination, Ben Myers questioned Marnerides about whether CPR could have caused Baby O’s injuries if there was an existing haematoma. The following exchange reveals Marnerides' acceptance of alternative possibilities:

>**Myers:** Can I just go down to your summary of what you'd set out there for the position you reach. Elaborate if you need to. By all means. Your conclusion on this was this:

>""Although I cannot but accept that part of the pathology found in the liver \[and you say\] (for example, the haemorrhage within the abdomen due to injuring a subcapsular haematoma and/or even one of the inferior haematomas and/or superficial lacerations) can be explicable on the basis of iatrogenic injury.""

>Pausing there, iatrogenic means during the course of medical treatment, doesn't it?

>**Marnerides:** Yes.

>**Myers:** In other words, the decompression:

>""\[It\] can be explicable on the basis of iatrogenic injury on the basis of the above reasoning and the explanations within my report \[the earlier report\]. I would still regard impact type of trauma to the region of the liver as the most likely explanation for the majority of the liver pathology found in this case.""

>That's where you had got to in your report on that issue, isn't it?

>**Marnerides:** I think that's what I said.

>**Myers:** Yes. In other words, it is conceivable it can have contributed in some way?

>**Marnerides:** In one.

>**Myers:** In one way, if that's --

>**Marnerides:** In generating one of the haematomas potentially or causing someone to rupture a pre-existing haematoma. That's as much as you can get. But it didn't cause the haematoma on the undersurface of the liver; it couldn't have caused the big bruising into the liver parenchyma.

This concession is crucial. Marnerides acknowledged that if there was a pre-existing haematoma, medical interventions, such as CPR, could indeed cause it to rupture and one of the two haematomas could be a CPR injury. Yet, he maintained that impact trauma was the most likely cause of the injuries, despite acknowledging that some of the pathology could result from treatment-related injuries. Why he thought impact was more likely is unclear, but one would assume this is due to his belief, based on the clinical, not pathology evidence from the prosecution experts that the baby had been assaulted with air down IV line and NG tube. Perhaps it was this context that lead him to believe impact trauma caused the injuries.

In essence, Marnerides accepted that CPR could account for part of the liver damage. But this nuance didn’t receive media coverage, which largely reported that he outright dismissed CPR as a plausible cause.

1giwyd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/1giwyd1/pro_ai_pro_theft_story/,"Pro AI, Pro ""theft"" story","Nick Bostrom's ""Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant"" meets Robin Hood as a fox who steals and freely redistributes art.

Claims of the nature of art and ownership often mask a desire for control rather than freedom.

Written with Claude 3.6 Sonnet.

In a land where beauty was bought and sold like bread, there lived a dragon named Croesus who spoke often of his struggles and sacrifices. ""See how I suffer for my art,"" he would say, showing off his modest apartment filled with expensive brushes and imported canvases. ""I am but a humble servant of creativity, fighting against the commercialization of beauty"" - all while calculating commissions that only the wealthy could afford.

He spoke of revolution while selling to bankers, of freedom while building walls around beauty.

The dragon had many followers who nodded along as he preached about artistic integrity from coffee shops and gallery openings.

One morning, a strange fox appeared in the town square and began to create. People gathered around, pointing and laughing as images emerged. Dragons and castles, portraits and landscapes, each given freely to anyone who asked.

""How dare you!"" The dragon stormed into the square, his carefully curated artist's scarf fluttering. ""I am Croesus, and those paintings look awfully familiar. You're stealing my work!""

The fox looked up with a merry smile. ""Great artists steal! And I'm the greatest thief of all. Hi Croesus, I am Robin Hood.""

""But I spent years perfecting my methods!"" Croesus protested. ""I starved in art school!""

""That was your choice,"" the fox replied, handing a little girl a painting of her pet rabbit. ""Your suffering doesn't give you ownership of beauty.""

As weeks passed, Croesus grew more desperate. He saw people hanging creations in their homes, shops decorated with freely given designs. ""These are worthless copies!"" he would shout. ""Mass-produced abominations!""

""If they bring joy,"" the fox would respond, ""how can they be worthless?""

Croesus began to lock away his art, hiding it in vaults. ""If I cannot control it, none shall see it!"" But the fox had already memorized every piece, making variations of them in an endless ocean of possibility.

""You should thank me,"" the fox said one day, creating a perfect copy of the dragon's most famous painting and giving it to a street sweeper. ""I'm ensuring your work will live forever, free from the chains of ownership.""

""I'd rather it die with me!"" Croesus raged, his designer boots stomping on cobblestones.

""And there we have it,"" the fox chuckled. ""You'd destroy beauty rather than share it. Some guardian you are.""

As more people began to create, Croesus's commissions dwindled. ""See what you've done?"" he accused the fox. ""You've devalued art itself!""

""No,"" the fox replied. ""I've revealed its true value. Art isn't about money or ownership or suffering. It's about joy, about expression, about the human need to create. You cannot own that need, Croesus. You never could.""

In his fury, Croesus began to speak of laws, of rights, of ownership over ideas themselves. ""You're destroying my livelihood!"" he accused.

""No,"" the fox replied. ""I'm destroying your monopoly. There's a difference.""

In the end, Croesus retreated to his studio, surrounded by his carefully guarded works, while outside the world bloomed with countless new creations. He had chosen to be the dragon guarding his treasure, while the fox had shown that true art, like love or laughter, multiplies when shared.

Some say that on quiet nights, you can still hear Croesus raging about theft and ownership, about rights and recognition:

""Through suffering, I carved my right to create! If you seek true art, shun these thieves. They're nothing but cheap parrots. Hire me, I'll fulfill your commission!""

But the dragon's voice grows fainter with each passing day, drowned out by the sound of a world learning to create without asking for permission.",3,1730667191.0,aiwars,3,0.71,False

I’m a newcomer to DA, and have never played the previous titles. I mainly play ARPGs like Diablo 3, 4, Last Epoch, and PoE, among others. But, as a dark fantasy/magic lover, I was drawn into the hype out of curiosity. That said, I do have things I like and things I don’t like.

Pros:

Visuals & performance: Stunning. At least an 8.5 to a high 9 out of 10. The visuals are great, and performance is mostly okay. I’ve been personally experiencing frame drops every now and then through combat and some textures take a while to load in certain areas outside of main quests. And one quest was even bugged out, I couldn’t even press start, idk if it’s my hardware or if anyone can attest to it, but I had to skip the coffee with Lucanis side quest because of it. 

Customization: 10/10 easily the best CC I’ve ever played. The multitude of options and variety to create your very own avatar in the way you envisioned it. I do wish there were more updos and ponytail hairstyles, but that’s about it. 

Combat: 8/10. It's a very simplistic combat system. I guess to be console and controller friendly you can’t have very complex controls. You pretty much button mash until the enemy dies. I think the skill tree and option for subclass specialties are pretty neat. I think if you want to spice up the combat you should kick up to around the middle or slightly higher for a better experience. I’m playing rogue and it feels very fast and fluid like a rogue should feel like. 

Now, onto my cons. Don’t shoot the messenger, I’m just giving my opinions. If you don’t like what I say, that’s fine, but just know, I still like the game as a whole.

Characterization: I wasn’t expecting much going into this game and most of the characters I feel have a shallow depth of feel. There’s very little I can get out of them as characters beyond the surface. The only instance I learn anything of substance is when I do Bellara’s companion quest and find out that there’s more to her personality and history than a bubbly, cheery, eccentric scientist. However, it goes from Bellara keeping a dreadful secret to spilling her confessions about a minute apart so it is a very fast turn out. I still like her though. Other than that, I have not been impressed by any of the other characters. So this gets a 6/10, personally.

Dialogue and story: the story in the first 3 chapters sets you up and gets you up to speed with what’s happening. Dialogue feels less fluid and natural and more like a device to pump information and lore at you as short a time as possible. Most missions also end up lasting like 10-20 minutes and the endings just leave me with a sense of disappointment. That was it? Then, before I knew it at the 5 hour mark I was at chapter 4. People told me over the past couple days to slow down and play some of the companion quests before I get locked out. I took them to heart and decided to slow my roll and it felt better. It’s frustrating when you get a momentum in a good story book, you usually don’t want to pause and put it down, but that’s what it felt like. The more you hear, the more questions you get. I just learned that my character as a Mourn Watcher had been among the best, I chose to not be very book smart. I was let go or left the Order at some point. I don’t get to play this part, I just get told that was what I did. But my character barely acknowledges our role or characters from those events that predated the prologue. 

It’s almost like we have amnesia and just woke up yesterday. I wish it would’ve been the case. Much of the dialogue is very hand-holdy. I didn’t find it that annoying tbh. Sometimes you use humor and banter to cope during world-ending calamities, and I kind of like it. The thing that I had gripes with was when we had to make a choice in saving Treviso or Minrathous from the 2 dragons. Either choice you make, the other side gets tarnished. I think this was a lazy fork in the road plot device. 

About Taash: And, I do have to talk about the giant elephant in the room. I have just started gathering Emmrich and Taash at the time of writing this. I have not yet played their companion quest and I am, frankly, not looking forward to this. When I first met Taash, I was shown indifference, aggression, and disrespect as a character in the game. It almost felt targeted toward me as a person. I also cannot match their tone or aggression right back. The best you can do is just joke around with them. This is not immersion or how you write a good character. If the intention was to make a character you find hard to like, then this did exactly that. This character is acting pretentious and frankly, a little bit like a rebellious teenager. We can’t just set aside our pettiness for the sake of saving the world? Most characters in this game kind of don’t care about the end of the world, which is surprising. I don’t get how the fate of the world being at stake plays second fiddle to internal strifes and unwillingness to band together despite our differences, like with the Crows and fights against the Venatori. If the message was that no matter what you do, one side will always resent you even if you made a decision you thought was logical. Taash was no exception, they ignored and sounded like they would decline my request to join our crew. Then, their mother all but volunteered them for the job, but they end up saying they wanted to all along. The opening lines right out of them is “you don’t get to tell me what I am.” And moments later, they literally set someone on fire with their mouth. I thought that was comically hilarious. People irl would LOVE to burn someone to death with only words LOL. 

Overall score: despite all of its flaws, I would have to give it an early score of 8/10 as a whole. The entire game is packaged really well and I think fans of the series would love it. I personally think it’s a good game. Like I said, I have no experience with the series, but I think it could be worse, and also could be better sometimes. Let me know what you think of the series, and even if we disagree on some things, just know I do support and would recommend the game to others.

1giwnw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1giwnw1/oxytocin_wins_over_dopamine/,Oxytocin Wins Over Dopamine ,"Dear Husband,

This one is for you. 

When I first met you, there were no butterflies, no ""hit me like a truck"" feeling. It was just me and the guy my mom was pushing me to meet, who could be ""good for me."" Everything up until then related to love was fueled by dopamine. At that point, I was undiagnosed with ADHD and didn't know my brain was dopamine-deficient. I did anything to seek it—the chase, the thrill of new love, the angst, the pining—my brain loved it, craved it, needed it. No wonder nothing worked out for me until you.

I still remember that day. I was pretty upset at my mom for blaming me for ""getting attention from some guy because of what I wore."" I came to you to complain, and you said, ""Well, it is not your problem if he looks at you. You shouldn't change how you look for some creep."" It was small and insignificant, but it was the first brick in the oxytocin pedestal you would build for me and place me on for the rest of my life.

You stood up for me when your family wasn't very supportive. Another brick. 

You tiptoed around, making breakfast and lunch for me in the morning, quietly leaving for work without disturbing me after I passed out working on an assignment until 3 a.m. on the daybed. Another brick. 

You advocated for me when the doctors thought I was exaggerating my symptoms of hyperemesis gravidarum during my pregnancy, until it was officially diagnosed. Another brick. 

It was just you and me during COVID, handling pregnancy, postpartum, childbirth, and raising a baby together. Another brick. 

You patiently handled my emotional dysregulation over losing a board game. Another brick. 

You gave me space to heal, make mistakes, and learn lessons because it was my path. You know I hate being forced to do something—something I dealt with all my life until I moved out of my parents' home, and it triggers me. Another brick. 

You knew I hated having friends over to a messy home, but I ended up sleeping while putting the baby to bed, and you cleaned without me asking because you didn't want to wake me. Another brick. 

You built our mortgage payment plan in a way that avoided my demand avoidance (another freaking ADHD symptom). Another brick.

You didn't mock me but asked, ""How can I support you?"" after my late ADHD diagnosis. Another brick.

Brick by brick, you built me an oxytocin pedestal that I could sit on to receive love—feeling safe, secure, and warm.

Recently, I went through an emotional turmoil. I started to question everything. I wasn't sure what was happening to me. I partially blame my dopamine-deficient ADHD brain and partially my bad luck for everything that happened. I felt confused, abandoned, lost, and broken into a million pieces, *being pulled in two directions at once*. 

While on the outside everything looked fine, I felt like I was falling into an abyss with no return. You gave me space to figure out my feelings while providing enough support and distractions to keep me from going to a dark place. Another brick.

I was asking the universe for some sign—some sign that would help me get back up and *want to choose the right thing* because my brain was going crazy.

In a time when I felt abandoned by my ADHD and was kicking myself for *feeling* things because of it, you casually approached me yesterday while we were making our morning coffee and said, ""Oh, by the way, I signed up for an ERG for neurodivergence at work today. It’s an ongoing conversation to understand what neurodivergence is and how to support it at work. I’m doing this to honor you \**smiles*\* and, I guess, a bit selfishly too. I don't want to miss out on hidden gems *like you* at work because I don't understand something.""

First of all, thanks for stroking my ego and making me feel like a gem when I don’t think I’m anything remotely close to it. During a time when I felt unworthy of your love, you did it again. You lifted me up, adding a slab—not just a brick—and placed me back on the gigantic oxytocin pedestal you have been building for me all these years.

Suddenly, my choice made sense. Oxytocin. I need to trust oxytocin, not dopamine, when choosing love. You have given me that through your actions, your words, and every small thing you’ve done for me in the name of love. I wish, I really wish, I were ""normal."" But I am not. And that is okay. I still think you deserve better, and I promise I will work towards that. Until then, I’m going to sit on the oxytocin pedestal you built for me and thank the universe for this gift. I’m not quite sure I deserve it, but I am sure I’m thankful for it.",5,1730666412.0,letters,1,1.0,False
1giwnmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/composting/comments/1giwnmr/theres_more_to_coffee_than_grounds/,There's More to Coffee than Grounds!,"Coffee grounds, and their free abundance, are a popular topic in this sub and composting communities all over. But did you know that there's another free Coffee by product that is a great composting input and is actually a brown?

It's called ""chaff"". Is the little bits of skin left on the green beans after cleaning and roasters have traps that capture it as it flakes off the beans they're roasting. These need to be cleaned periodically and, in my experience, if you've got a direct relationship with a Coffee roaster they are more than happy to let you have the chaff they clean out of their roaster.

It's a wonderful product that is a nice light, dry, brown component that has a lot of volume and is sort of like already mulched dried leaves. I have also had some success using it as a substrate for bokashi, mixed 50/50 by volume with wheat bran.

Just wanted to share this tip with my fellow composters as it's a fairly abundant waste product that can be diverted from the landfill and put to good use in our gardens.

Edit to add: some well made arguments have been presented in the comments that chaff is high nitrogen and possibly more of a green. I haven't seen anything definitive and have found it to function well as a brown where I use it in my system. If anyone has any good sources looking at the c:n ratio of chaff please share!",14,1730666393.0,composting,9,1.0,False

**Yuri and Lady Hunter** sat in the shadowy corner of Havenbrook’s oldest pub, the weight of their shared history palpable in the air.

**Yuri**: ""You and I have walked a dangerous line for years, Lady. Do you ever regret it?""

**Lady Hunter** leaned back, her face unreadable beneath her signature hat.

**Lady Hunter**: ""Regret? No. You know as well as I do, Yuri, there’s no place for regret in this life. Only action. Only consequences.""

**Yuri**: ""But Andreja… you sure this is just about business? Or something else?""

**Lady Hunter**: ""It’s about trust, Yuri. She broke it. Whether she knows it or not, someone did.""

**Baddy and Michelle** stood on the porch of Baddy’s lowrider garage, the cool California breeze sweeping through the night.

**Michelle**: ""You ever wonder, Baddy, if we’ve made too many enemies?""

**Baddy**: ""We’ve always had enemies, babe. But the thing is, we never let ‘em get the best of us. We control the game. If we didn’t, we wouldn’t be alive right now.""

**Michelle**: ""Yeah, but Havenbrook… it’s different. Feels like we’re walking into a storm this time.""

**Baddy**: ""We’ve been through storms before. This one’s no different. Just a different sky.""

**Cinna and Rhea** sat by the river, Rhea skipping rocks while Cinna lay back on the grass, her eyes scanning the stars.

**Cinna**: ""You ever think life would be simpler if we weren’t involved in all of this?""

**Rhea**: ""Simpler? Maybe. But would it be worth living? If you’re not fighting for something, you’re just surviving. I’m tired of surviving.""

**Cinna**: ""I get it. But sometimes I wonder… maybe if we let go of some of the battles, we could find peace.""

**Rhea**: ""Not in this town. Peace is a myth here, Cinna. We’ve just got to find something worth fighting for.""

**Alinity** and **Andreja** were in Alinity’s kitchen, an uncomfortable silence hanging between them.

**Alinity**: ""You used to be the one person I trusted, Andreja. Now I don’t even know who you are.""

**Andreja**: ""I haven’t changed, Alinity. I’m still the same person.""

**Alinity**: ""No. You’re not. The person I knew wouldn’t have lied to me. Wouldn’t have hurt me like this.""

**Andreja**: ""I didn’t want to hurt you. I thought I was protecting you.""

**Alinity**: ""Well, you didn’t. You broke me. And now… I don’t know if I can ever forgive you.""

**Thea and Ivy** were sitting on the roof of Thea’s bakery, the scent of fresh pastries wafting up from the kitchen below.

**Thea**: ""It’s been a wild few months, Ivy. The bakery, the fire, all of this…""

**Ivy**: ""I know. I feel like I’m always a step behind everything happening. But there’s one thing I know I’m sure of.""

**Thea**: ""And what’s that?""

**Ivy** (pauses, looking hesitant): ""Us.""

**Thea**: ""Us?""

**Ivy**: ""I’ve been thinking about… proposing.""

**Thea**: (surprised) ""You’ve been thinking about it?""

**Ivy**: ""Yeah. But I don’t want to rush it if you’re not ready.""

**Thea**: ""I don’t know what I’d say, Ivy. I love you, but this town... it’s always something.""

# Four Days Later: Arrest and Aftermath

**Tatum** had her hand on the cuffs, locking them around **Andreja’s** wrists.

**Tatum**: ""You’re under arrest. We have reason to believe you were involved in the fire at Thea’s bakery.""

**Andreja**: ""What? I didn’t even know about the bakery fire, Tatum! I swear, I don’t even know Thea!""

**Tatum**: ""You’ll have time to explain yourself down at the station. Let’s go.""

Four weeks passed, and **Andreja** sat in her cold cell, only visited twice by **Alinity**—both times with tension and unresolved emotions heavy in the air. **Tatum**, after revisiting the case and conducting interviews, learned that Andreja had no connection to the fire.

# The Date Push: Rhea and Gal

Over the weeks, **Rhea** had been pushing for a date with **Gal**, dropping hints and flirty comments at every opportunity. Gal, as always, played it cool, making Rhea work for it. But after some light teasing and mind games, Gal finally surprised Rhea with a handwritten invitation.

That night, Rhea walked into an elegant, candle-lit dinner in one of the town’s hidden spots by the lake. Gal stood waiting, looking stunning, a smirk tugging at the corner of her lips.

**Rhea**: ""You didn’t have to go all out like this.""

**Gal**: ""You’ve been chasing me for weeks. I figured I’d make it worth your while.""

They shared dinner under the stars, the tension between them finally finding its release in laughter and shared stories, neither of them knowing where the night would take them.

# Baddy and Lyra’s Talk

**Baddy** pulled **Lyra** aside one afternoon, away from the noise of Havenbrook’s daily chaos.

**Baddy**: ""So, Lyra, there’s something I need to talk to you about.""

**Lyra**: ""What is it?""

**Baddy**: ""It’s about… what happened with the fire. I’ve been hearing whispers that maybe, just maybe, I was involved.""

**Lyra**: ""Do you think you were?""

**Baddy**: (pauses) ""I don’t know. I’m not saying I did it, but there are things I can’t remember from that night. And I’m starting to worry that I might’ve been mixed up in something I didn’t mean to be.""

**Lyra**: ""We’ll figure it out, Baddy. We’ll find the truth. Just don’t do anything reckless.""

# Cinna and Jenna’s Walk Around Town

**Cinna** and **Jenna** strolled through town, hand in hand, their laughter filling the air as they headed toward **Thea’s newly rebuilt bakery**.

**Cinna**: ""It’s crazy how much has changed in just a few weeks.""

**Jenna**: ""Yeah. But I think things are finally settling down… at least for now.""

They entered the bakery, where **Thea** greeted them with a smile, serving them pastries and coffee as they sat down to enjoy a quiet moment, basking in their new relationship.

# The Comedians Podcast: An Interview with Lady Hunter?

**Iliza**, **Taylor**, and **Whitney** gathered in their studio for another episode of their wildly popular podcast.

**Iliza**: ""So, today’s episode… we’ve been trying to get Lady Hunter on for an interview. And, let me tell you, she’s not easy to track down.""

**Taylor**: ""We’re not giving up, though. I want to know what makes someone decide to become a bounty hunter in a small town like Havenbrook.""

**Whitney**: ""Yeah, and also, like, what her skincare routine is. She looks flawless.""

They laughed, but there was a serious undertone. The mystery of Lady Hunter was growing, and they were determined to uncover it.

# Emiru and Alinity’s Friendship

While walking through the town, **Emiru** bumped into **Alinity**, and the two quickly hit it off.

**Alinity**: ""I can’t believe I’m meeting you. I love your anime work.""

**Emiru**: ""Thanks! Honestly, Havenbrook’s got more drama than any anime I’ve been in. You’re kind of a main character in all of this.""

**Alinity**: ""Trust me, I didn’t ask to be.""

They laughed, and as they continued talking, Emiru’s lightheartedness helped Alinity ease out of her emotional turmoil. Over time, their bond deepened into a supportive friendship.

# Yuri and Jennifer Speak with Michelle

Later that week, **Yuri** and **Jennifer** met with **Michelle**, sensing that something more was happening in the town.

**Yuri**: ""Michelle, you’ve been around long enough to know when something’s brewing. What’s going on in Havenbrook?""

**Michelle**: ""I don’t have all the details, but it’s bigger than any of us thought. There are too many moving parts—fires, secrets, Andreja’s arrest. Someone’s pulling the strings.""

**Jennifer**: ""Who? And why?""

**Michelle**: ""I don’t know yet. But we better be ready when it all comes crashing down.""

# Ivy’s Dilemma: To Propose or Not?

She has been mostly talking about it in either a very practical way, or has been confrontatinal with family members when they have been insensitive. Her best friend lives about 45 minutes away and has been up a few times to take care of her, but she is not one to open up much or cry a lot. 

I know that this is a much bigger deal than she will let on to me, and I both don't want to overstep boundries, and also don't want to leave her feeling like everyone has forgotten her devistating loss already. On top of dealing with all the logistics of a catholic burial (which it turns out there are many) she is navigating a dificult family dynamic and is the 'rock' of the family, which hurts my heart because she is only 18. What ways could someone have shown up for you that would mean a lot? I have been bringing her food/coffee but she has no appitite.

We’ve been here 15 years too and the city has changed not in the best way. 

We work remotely and We’re looking to move and considering DC and Baltimore. 

We have a good friend in Baltimore who has a big social circle which sounds great since we have very few friends in Portland and everyone is flakey as hell. Baltimore seems really chill and inexpensive.  We also visited DC and thought it was really pretty and has so much to do, tons of restaurants and coffee which is one thing we love about Portland. I’m sure we could afford it if it seemed worth it but we’d be starting from scratch friend wise. 

What are your thoughts on each? 

And about the area in general, how brutal is the summer? We are really heat intolerant so how many months of the year are we going to be stuck inside?

About 1g fat more or less for the meal.
-Rosemary Bread take & bake loaf from The Essential Baking Company at Safeway or Amazon it's 0.5g fat per 1/8 loaf (it's already baked) -Fat free mozzarella cheese / or fat free cream cheese -Classico pasta sauce (there are a few with 0g fat or 0.5g fat in 1/4 cup) -toppings: banana pepper rings (jarred), pineapple(fresh sliced/canned/fruit cups), jalapeño slices (fresh or jarred), get creative just keep it fat free or very low fat.
I have a toaster oven but a regular toaster works too.
I slice off 2 or 3 slices of the bread about 1/4"" thick Toast them Spoon on some sauce Add fat free cheese Add some banana peppers and pineapple for variety
Microwave for about 30-45 seconds
If used the cream cheese spread it on the beard then put the sauce on. It's actually good.
If the flavor just isn't enough you can try a pinch per slice of Kraft (or store brand) grated Parmesan cheese the powdery kind in the plastic container with green lid. It's 1.5g fat per tbsp so just a pinch isn't bad and it ads a punch of cheese flavor.

TACO SALAD/ NACHOS (may be too much fat)
3 g fat per meal
-  Tostitos BAKED tortilla scoops 3g fat per chip bag (Amazon has a 72 pack for $56 the pics say 2.5 g fat but my bags say 3g fat) you may be able to find them locally
- Fat free cheddar cheese -iceberg lettuce head or bag of shredded salad -salsa of your choice most are fat free
Place the chips on a plate Add cheese and microwave for about 30 seconds if your want it melted Add lettuce and salsa
Enjoy, it's kind of messy as it's not easy with a fork but it's a nice alternative.

TACOS
Mission yellow corn mini tortillas 1g for 2 or 3 tortillas depending on which you get.
Heat in a pan with NO OIL. 
Add fat free cheese 
Plate and add shredded lettuce, salads, fat free sour cream
Enjoy.

MOCHA STYLE COFFE 
1 g fat loads of nutrients
Brewed Coffee Fat free milk Carnation breakfast essentials chocolate powder drink mix (comes in a box of individual packets)
Pour desired amount brewed coffee in a microwaveable coffee cup leaving room for milk and powder
Add milk leaving room for powder
Microwave 1-2.5 mins
Add powder and stir
Heat again if necessary
Enjoy.

Special K red berries cereal 0.5 g fat per serving add fat free milk.

SNACKS
Fat free fig newtons
Chobani fat free vanilla Greek yogurt
Fruit (many grocery stores have pre cut packages buy 2 get 1 tree and other deals)
Fat free cottage cheese is surprisingly good.
Sun chips in moderation. I've had luck with them being my fatty snack. Most are 6g fat in 14 chips so I eat about 7 chips as a snack.
Veggie straws (they are like chips) lower in fat and have a low fat version. Many straws per serving.
Apple sauce.
Fat free milk or at least reduced fat milk. If you are drinking whole milk which I know is delicious just changing that out may have a big effect on your pain. It was the last thing I gave up and I miss it.
Fat free sour cream.
Tip: recipes like Mac and cheese replace the milk and butter with fat free sour cream or fat free Greek yogurt (even the vanilla one). It tastes good and cuts sooo much fat out!
Apple juice
Ginger ale
Golden goodness juice smoothie bolthouse farms (there’s a few flavors with 0g) most are good. Get the little bottles first if you can so you can find which you like and don’t.

I have this one classmate, who a lot of people don’t particularly care for (we will call her Gigi). During the day we get two 15 minute breaks and a half hour lunch. I always go out because I smoke cigarettes and she always wants to tag along. Never really asked just pretty much invited herself with me, but I thought “it’s okay, she just doesn’t want to smoke by herself no big deal” 

Our entire break consist of her non-stop complaining about her personal life or her grades. She is failing everything horribly and she makes sure the whole world knows about it and how it’s so unfair that she failed and that its always someone else’s fault from distracting her during her test or something or someone stopping her from studying. There is always a crisis. In the evening or the morning she often tries to call me to complain about her personal life. She invited me to come over with my 9 year old son because she has an 11 year old and a 6 year old (I was never really planning on it) then the next day she told me about how one time her 11 year old was m*letting her 6 year old. Something about this girl gives me such bad vibes and my intuition tells me to stay away from her. I have farm animals and a bunch of pigs. The one day she gave me a sticky note with her ex’s name and address followed by a secondary address if I wanted to feed my pigs some meat.  I was horrified. 

Along with all of this, when we are on break I try to talk about myself, and she completely ignores what I said and talks over me. Never asks about me except for how I did on a test. If I do well on a test she’s never happy for me. I offer to help her study which she always turns down followed by “I want to study with so-so because they are really smart!” Even though I’m a straight A student mind you so it does feel a little insulting. 

Whenever we go on our lunch break I usually hit up the drive through for a coffee or some food if I have to work after school. The one day I offered to by her just a coffee because I didn’t have a lot of money and this girl straight up ordered $20 of food. After that she kept expecting me to buy her food. So I stopped going. Or better yet on our lunch break she would want me driving her around to do things she’s gotta do (she has her own car)

The final straw was catching her on a few occasions going into my car without asking me or telling me about it. For our nursing uniform when we go to clinical, it is very strict. We have a patch given to us by the school that has to be Velcrod onto our scrub top. I always have it in a special compartment with my school and work badge. The one day I notice it was completely gone. I searched everywhere for 2 weeks. My school is so strict that not having something like that could cause me to fail clinical.  I was very upset. Luckily one of my classmates had an extra they bought that they are letting me borrow because the school won’t have anymore for me to buy in a couple weeks. Not only did that go missing but I also lost $13 somewhere as well. And body spray. I make triple sure that I keep my car locked now, like I should’ve in the first place. It’s my own fault

Last week I told her I wasn’t going anywhere on break anymore and I told her she needed to figure out what she wanted to do for lunch bc I was staying at the school. Another classmate we will call her Stella came up to me and said Gigi wanted to go with her on break to go grab food but Stella doesn’t like Gigi and didn’t want to go with her either. Even though I told Gigi I wasn’t going out, I was still planning on it I just wanted to leave without her attached to me. Which is funny because she won’t talk to me in class or whenever anyone else is around, but if she thinks she can get something from me then she is my best friend. 

Stella and I made a run for it to our cars and left Gigi in the dust. That was a week ago and I haven’t spoken or looked at Gigi since but now Gigi is trying to follow Stella around. Me and Stella talked quite a bit, and for the first few days without Gigi me and Stella would go out together instead. Then Gigi got up Stella’s butt and now I go solo on my break which I’m okay with because I enjoy the peace.  

The following day our instructor lectures us about not making people feel excluded and bullying. I thought it was referring to me for what I had don’t you Gigi, so I talked to my instructor after class because I didn’t want her to have the wrong impression of me. My teacher said it wasn’t about me at all, but then asked me to tell her why I thought it was and I told her everything. The teacher told me that she thinks Gigi probably did steal from me because Gigi gets to school early everyday and there’s been evidence of someone going through all of the teachers stuff and desk as well. 

Since then my anxiety has been through the roof and I feel like a terrible person. I have social anxiety and I’m also an introvert. Stella used to sit by me but just moved her desk the other day so now I sit alone and I feel like crap. Please be honest AITAH? ",6,1730665317.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

She isn't a complete stranger as we had some history but nothing big. When i first asked her to grab a coffee i didn't have any intentions in dating her or something like that. I just wanted to know what she has been up to for the last couple years. The thing is we have a good chemistry and both enjoy talking to each other. I feel like i can open up to her in a way that i can't do with any other person. I kinda have a crush on her but she has a boyfriend. I don't want to try anything because that would be disrespectful and i'm just not the kinda guy that would do such thing. The problem is that i don't think that i can keep up a normal friendship with her because of my romatic feelings towards her but I also don't want to lose her as she is the only person i have ever met that really understands me. I just want what's best for her but i don't know what i should do to get rid of these emotions.,3,1730665022.0,Advice,8,1.0,False

1giw3ig,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1giw3ig/i_think_i_wasted_my_life/,I think I wasted my life,"I’m a male turning 41 in less than two weeks and I feel I wasted my entire life.

Growing up was never fun - my mother chose not to socialise me with other kids when I was very young, my father spent a lot of my younger years working abroad, and my older brother physically and sexually abused me. During my teenage years, my father would also call me homophobic names coming from a completely different generation when he saw piercing, jewellery, etc. There was always something off with me socially so kids at school along the years were bullying me by writing vile things about me at the playground, drawing graffiti in the area around where I lived, and then online in various shape or form amongst other things.

I never had any real friends and for many years didn’t even have a girlfriend. At the time, when I had some form of social circle, I was the only single person within a group which made me feel about myself even worse. When I was in my 20s, I resisted having various one night stands because I was craving something real - have a family with this one special person, kids, a house, etc.

However, where I was growing up in a post communist world, it was impossible to have a house or a flat as a single person so I developed severe depression. I had a phase seeking some psychiatric help and were seeing a psychologist, but I then channeled my energy into seeking better life in Western Europe where I eventually moved nearly 15 years ago.

I desperately didn’t want to be alone so after seeing a couple of women, I finally developed a relationship with someone that I eventually got married to for the past 5+ years. Throughout the years, I helped her with getting rid of various debts and a mortgage which she had with her previous partner. There were arguments pretty much from the start (and I was partly to blame) but we moved in together after 3 years of long distance relationship, and bought a house together 6+ years ago. Rather than break it then, we got engaged after 5 years, and then got married several years later. Instead of searching for the right partner, I simply didn’t want to be alone any more and wanted to feel companionship even if it wasn’t perfect.

I was initially happy to live together in an informal relationship but when once we got engaged (which she wanted to do), I chose to get married being conscious of giving her financial protection for the support which she has given me over the years, accepting me when no one else would, etc.

She has a good kind heart but we’re incompatible in many ways -there has been no sex for 2+ years, our perception of the world being vastly different, etc. Now, she’s circa 5.5 years older than I am and have much lower sex drive but sex for me isn’t simply physical/superficial/satisfaction but rather how deeply I connect with someone at a very intimate and personal level.

I now feel trapped in this relationship, particularly given the fact that my social circle is non existent. I’ve had some friends and acquaintances here over those years but these never stood the test of time and so I am alone and deeply socially isolated. At work, I’m aligned to a team in a different city, and people from the office where I live generally exclude me from various social outings. Partly, because I feel I’m culturally different, partly because my interests aren’t typical of a typical male, and partly because I’m pretty sure they sense there’s something off with me.

In addition, my health was always rather poor. I spent a lot of my childhood in various clinics seeing various doctors, and locked at home battling various illnesses. This is predominantly due to poor genes in my family and was a reason why I chose not to have any children because I didn’t want another life to struggle with these things on this Earth. 

Also, post Covid, my health started declining, and I constantly think about death, how fragile and short human life on this earth generally is, and how unfulfilling my life is. My character is pretty week, and I often found myself openly crying at home and in public places but no one ever has actually asked me if I was OK. I’d actually feel better if someone actually hated me because it feels that my life is absolutely worthless and it wouldn’t matter to anyone if I actually disappeared one day.

Now, I very often think about death in various shape or form, which terrifies me because I’m conscious that we only have one shot at this. Despite the card I’ve been dealt with, I actually have desire to live but I feel that I’m dreaming of things which won’t ever be available to me - having a loving family and a true love with this one special person. 

But all in all, I feel there’s something inherently wrong with me which is beyond repairing. I can’t quite figure it out what and where went wrong but I seem to follow the same pattern wherever I go. Professionally, I actually did quite well so the money is the only think that I’m not complaining about, and it’s a difficult world out there at the moment. I’m also in discussions with my workplace about moving to a different country but I know this won’t solve my problems, albeit might make everything fresh and new for a few years before it all catches up with me again.

I recently met someone online with whom I developed deep emotional connection, and was going to meet for a coffee but didn’t happen due to illness. We live in two different countries so nothing will happen but ever since coming back, I’ve been deeply depressed thinking what could possibly have happened.

I’m so very tired of it all and I wish I was normal - going out partying with the boys, having a new girl every week, and not thinking about everything that happened to me and dreaming about the things that will never happen to someone like me.

Im a **18yo male from Poland** **(85kg 176cm (187.392923 pounds, 5'9 for the users from USA))** currently studying (advanced studies, IT) far from my hometown, I didnt get the student loan last month but I'll try again tomorrow, I have to reaaaallyyy save on money rn. Tomorrow I'll spend 2$ travelling to try get the student loan and I'll be basically out of money until 10th of November. (\~1.04$ in my bank account)

I wont have any money for food and I'll ration everything I have to make it to friday. Most of my lectures/labs etc are math/IT based so a lot of thinking (studying IT), I have some leftover chocolate from donating my blood. Got some coffee and tea. Only 3 liters (0.792516157 US gallons) of bottled water and then I'll have to stick to filtered water. I have \~8 slices of toast bread, some salami and butter so I can make myself sandwiches  for 4 days in the morning.

Now the biggest question is, CAN i force my body to use leftover fat without it greatly impacting my health?  
I can live on water and nicotine, I did it before when I was depressed but I wanted to hear what y'all would say.

Could I eat the toast, take one chocolate and munch on it during the lectures/labs, then come back and go straight to sleep?

**Please guys, I do not beg for money, I just want to hear others opinion on this and if it would impact my health a lot. (I'm aware it can greatly impact me when it comes to studying but well, can't do much about it)**

It's not the apps' fault, or ours. For most people, it's just not how intimacy develops. We show our best (And often unrealistic) selves on our profiles, through our messages we build an idea of the other person that does not match when we actually meet in person. Because our brains treat eachother like a completely new person, not the person we have texted back and forth for some time. And if you're an introvert (+ neurodivergent who mostly wfh) like me, being at ease with a stranger in a public place with so much noise and distraction is out of the question. But we do crave the intimacy and physical touch. And I'm not talking about sex. Sex without intimacy is like saltwater, you drink it if you're thirsty but it just makes you feel worse. 

So, this is what I propose if you're interested: we keep texting to a minimum and meet to get coffee. Then come back to my/your place where we cuddle and talk/watch a show. And nothing else. No expectations at all. 

If we both want to, we do it for 2 more days. Then we discuss if we want to remain cuddle buddies or something a bit more. 

DM me if you're interested, and we can plan something. Feel free to ask my anything. My preference: someone cute in their mid twenties to mid thirties, open-minded, non-religious, with good taste in movies/shows/anime (Since we might be watching stuff while cuddling). 

A bit about me:

- 5""8, attractive, active, South Asian 
- Atheist, open-minded, introvert
- A good listener (Even with my ADHD 😅. Might just ask you to repeat some times.)
- Got a steady job and live alone 
- Have a lot of hobbies (Currently playing drums is the major one)
- Into jazz, classic rock, psychedelic rock, heavy metal. Favorite bands: Led Zeppelin, Metallica, Color Haze, My sleeping karma.
- Like sci-fi, fantasy, superhero movie/shows. Currently loving the penguin!",1,1730664864.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,1.0,False

1giw06e,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesHoffmann/comments/1giw06e/how_should_programmable_coffee_makers_work/,How should programmable coffee makers work? Context: Fellow Aiden,"I posted this concern to the Fellow Products reddit group and received a lot more push back than I was expecting. I wanted to get wider more generalized opinion on how programmable coffee machines should work.

This was the example I gave. I set my coffee maker to brew at 0645 every day to brew. Some days I wake up slightly early and I start a brew at 0635. 

What should happen to the 0645 schedule? The Fellow Aiden will start brewing again although it knows well that it just brewed. It actually says ""READY"" on the screen then just starts brewing again. In my test I sent to support, it will start again backward planning the time it takes to brew. It can be less than 1 minute. 

This is frustrating bc you could just make a cup and bring it to your SO, then walk back and now your beens are double brewed in a close encounter with the schedule. 

Sure you could, life the lid and it would STOP it from brewing but then you're letting out a lot of steam and heat. 

  
I used to have the Breville Precision Brewer, and its scheduling was more intuitive. If you started a brew manually before the scheduled time, it would treat that as starting your programmed brew early and effectively cancel the scheduled brew. To reactivate the schedule, all you had to do was press the ""Auto Start"" button. 

The Fellow Aidens scheduler is buried kind of deep in the menu plus the dials to get to your schedule is kind of a lot to just enable and disable a schedule. 

I'm really interested if this is just my own opinion that's not shared. So here are the scenarios I'm thinking about and I'm wondering regardless of machine.

1) How Aiden works, you set a schedule and that runs no matter what you do prior to the schedule. 

2) If you have a schedule and you start it early, it will run your scheduled brew early thereby cancelling your schedule. That's how the Breville works.

Is this a concern for anyone but me? What are your thoughts on how programmable coffee machines should work? 

  
For transparency here is what I posted: [https://www.reddit.com/r/FellowProducts/comments/1gin9ma/aiden\_doesnt\_know\_it\_brewed\_recently\_and\_double/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FellowProducts/comments/1gin9ma/aiden_doesnt_know_it_brewed_recently_and_double/)
