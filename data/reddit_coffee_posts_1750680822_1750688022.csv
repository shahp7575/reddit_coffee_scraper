1lihm31,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lihm31/all_the_other_homeless_people_disappeared_when/,"All the other homeless people disappeared when they bought a strange man's ""Ticket to Salvation""... except me.","Two weeks ago, I lost everything I've ever had. I find getting into specifics unnecessary, but I stumbled into a position I'd always found inconceivable. One I regarded as many others do - with an attitude of ""*That could never happen to me*"". Well, through a calamity of terribly bad luck and equally bad decisions, it did. 





Whilst frantically looking for a place to live, a new job and receipt of the disputed paycheck that served as the final blow to the unravelling of my old life, I found myself sleeping under a constantly traffic-infested bridge alongside a dozen or so other homeless people. Even in this position, I thought myself different to those I shared a living space with. Not better. Just *different*. I would get back on my feet. This was only temporary for me. I couldn't stomach comparing myself to Ed, who had woken up to this view of unsightly concrete every morning for 16 years. Or to Lisa, who had done the same for 30, with her weathered face testifying to this depressing truth. Nor to any of the others who I never had the chance to speak with but could tell they had trod this path for far too long. 



It became my mantra, repeated as I migrated from coffee shop to coffee shop whilst hunting down a new job and as I struggled to fall asleep with my mind regret-tinged and senses attacked from every direction in their struggle to adapt to this new environment. 



""*I will get back on my feet*"".



And, just as things were slowly beginning to come together, the man showed up. The ever-present noise of the traffic above and the hubbub of conversation around late-November campfires kept us from hearing the thud of his weighty cane against the concrete until he was within speaking distance. He wore an amalgamated uniform of a tattered, filthy suit jacket and tie with a bottom half of pristine, creaseless dress pants and freshly polished shoes. He enticed all who resided under that bridge with a single sentence, spoken in a voice tinged with a giddy anticipation: 



""*Tickets to Salvation, available to all for the small price of your worldly possessions*!"" 



Heads perked up and eyes shot glances at others as his words settled in. People were quietly excited, but confusion reigned king. ""*What is a Ticket to Salvation?*"" an elderly man who remains a stranger to me asked. The man simply repeated his announcement. He did so in response to every question we had as if he were a broken record of unclear promise. 



And soon after, the first desperate soul took him up on his offer. It was Ed. He was one of the few under that bridge I had spoken to at length, in no small part because the early days of his now accepted reality were eerily similar to mine - and as such he saw a version of himself long departed within me. He'd always told me that this wasn't the bottom. That it could get worse. That I should never fall into the tempting trap of acceptance, no matter how long I tried and failed to recapture what I had lost. I only wish I could have given him some wisdom, or failing that merely some comfort, back. 



The man plundered over to Ed before he had even finished his indication of willingness: ""I'll take one off your hands"", and soon cast his eyes upon Ed's threadbare, stained mattress and the scattered collection of his belongings lying on it. The man handed Ed a scrap of paper and promptly struggled to drag the mattress alongside him. I asked Ed to take a look at his ticket, but his demeanour changed and he refused. The man, meanwhile, enticed the remaining residents with a walk of assurance and that same vow of salvation. 



And every single one of them exchanged their assortments of belongings for a ticket. I tried to, willing to try anything by this point, when he said something... different for the first and last time. 



""*I apologise, Sir, but you aren't ready yet.*""



And with that, before I could form the words to retort, he and all those except me under that bridge went the way of the wind before my horrified gaze. Their final expressions were at first of slight happiness before distorting into a silent scream as they vanished into somewhere that remains unknown. The places they stood, *lived*, suddenly vacant where they had seconds prior been inhabited. I never saw any of them again. 



I went to the police, the media, and anybody who might've listened. But my tales were simply those of a man with nothing left to lose. I didn't have any evidence they ever existed. I didn't know any of those people beyond their first names. I didn't even know where most of them came from. 



But I do know one thing.

At first we were okay, I really thought we were meant to be because we both have the same taste and vibes. His my first and everything, we were legal on both sides and even travel with fam sometimes. 

I spent my 6yrs with him, I don't even have friends anymore. Siya na naging bff ko, barkada ko, and even parang dad ko (broken fam). Binibigay niya lahat sakin ng gusto ko, princess treatment not until nakahanap siya ng barkada. 

This is where our rs became twisted. Bumili siya ng luho niya because 'naimpluwensyahan' daw siya ng barkada niya, and at first, pinagbawalan ko siya dahil magiging financial problem namin yun but nagpumilit siya and boom, now problem na namin yun. 

Palagi na siya nasama sa barkada niya, tambay sa coffee shops, computer games, talking about other girls, and even drinking. Sinabihan ko na siya about dyan but wala pa ding improvement. Kahit na yung time na edate sana namin pinunta niya sa barkada niya. Kahit na yung echat niya sana ako pinanglaro niya nalang ng comp games.

Now, napapagod nako but I really think its unfair if I dump him after all that I've done for him, doing his thesis, projs, cooking for him, and even giving him myself. Parang naging nanay na ako.

CROSSOVER SCREENPLAY

(Spiders II: Breeding Ground / The Ring)



Written by:

Valentin Shatilin



TO: Stephen David Brooks, Trevor Short, Avi Lerner, Danny Lerner, Boaz Davidson (Nu Image Films, USA);

Nu Boyana Films (Sofia, Bulgaria);

DreamWorks LLC. (USA).



LOGLINE: A journalist investigating a death from a ""cursed videotape""

discovers the victims are infected with spider eggs. Her search leads

to the sunken ship of a mad scientist, whose experiments merged with

the ghost of a murderous girl, creating a new kind of biological nightmare.



CHARACTERS:



RACHEL KELLER (40) - Journalist, curse survivor.

ALEX (30) - Survivor of the ""Black Tide"", knows the truth about Grbak.

JASON (32) - Alex's friend, skeptic, physically strong.

DR. GRBAK / SPIDER INCUBATOR - Mad scientist, now a vessel for the parasite.

SAMARA MORGAN - Ghost vector of the ""Arachnoid"".

CURSE VICTIMS - Mutated humans with spider-like traits.



SCENE 1: PROLOGUE - OCEAN. NIGHT. 2001



Deep darkness. A raging STORM. Water crashes through gashes in the hull

of the CARGO SHIP ""BLACK TIDE"". Inside - CHAOS: METAL SCREECHING, SCREAMS,

WATER flooding the corridors.



Inside a LABORATORY on the lower deck - DR. GRBAK (60+, William Fichtner).

He isn't trying to escape. Before him - a rack of TRANSPARENT CONTAINERS.

Inside - dark, PULSING masses.



Grbak grabs a SYRINGE filled with murky fluid (""Arachnoid""). He turns

towards a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA on the wall, his eyes are coldly fanatical.



GRBAK

(hysterical, yet controlled, into the camera)

Do you see?! Death is but an incubator!

I shall become immortal! The colony is eternal!

Watch! WATCH!



He plunges the syringe into his own neck. Instant CONVULSIONS. His eyes

roll back. A CABINET of containers topples onto him. GLASS shatters.

Dark droplets mix with the water.



The surveillance camera captures his contorted face (Fichtner's). Then - DARKNESS.

STATIC SNOW. The ship sinks with a GROANING CREAK.



SCENE 2: MORGUE. SEATTLE. DAY. PRESENT DAY



Cold neon light. RACHEL KELLER stands over the autopsied body of

a TEENAGER (16). A Pathologist (O.S.) dictates notes.



PATHOLOGIST (V.O.)

...multiple internal hemorrhages.

Foreign bodies in the lungs... Appear to be... eggs.

Chitinous shells. Size... unbelievable.



CLOSE UP - TEEN'S LUNGS. Inside - dozens of GRAY-BLACK,

PULSATING EGGS the size of pigeon eggs. They THROB.



Rachel pales. Her gaze falls on a TABLE. There - a VIDEOCASSETTE

in an evidence bag. The label shows a faded logo: ""BLACK TIDE"".



RACHEL

(whispering, recognizing)

Seven days...



Beside the cassette - an old PORTABLE TV. Screen - static.

Rachel moves closer. In the static, for a moment, the

OUTLINE OF A WELL appears... and MULTIPLE SCURRYING SHADOWS, like spiders.



Rachel jerks her hand back. She KNOWS.



SCENE 3: ABANDONED WAREHOUSE. EVENING



Rachel finds ALEX and JASON. They live in fear. Seeing

photos of the cassette and eggs, Alex breaks down.



ALEX

Grbak! It's his work! He raved about ""perfection""...

about a new race! Blending spider DNA with human embryos...

creating perfect hosts!



JASON

Crazy old bastard! He drowned us all!



ALEX

(to Rachel, quiet, horrified)

His first test subject... was a girl. An orphan.

Strong... unusual. Her name was... Samara.

He implanted her with a carrier embryo before birth.

Said her psychic energy... was the perfect catalyst.



Rachel grasps the full horror: Samara's curse became the vector

for Grbak's biological nightmare.



SCENE 4: ABANDONED PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL. NIGHT



The group navigates dark CORRIDORS. Walls coated with THICK

WEBS. The air is thick, sickly-sweet.



They find Grbak's HIDDEN ARCHIVE. Film reels, diaries, test tubes.

Rachel examines FILM FOOTAGE on an old projector:



YOUNG GRBAK (Fichtner digitally aged/different actor) in a lab coat beside a GIRL (4-5 years) - SAMARA (resembling Jennifer Carpenter).

She stares emptily at the camera. Grbak injects her. The film has JUMPY FRAMES, DISTORTIONS. Shadows on the wall form

HUGE, DISTORTED SPIDER LEGS.



RACHEL

(reading Grbak's diary)

""...Embryo successfully grafted. Subject S.M.'s psi-potential

enhances Arachnoid replication a thousandfold.

Host death does not halt the process.

The parasite uses psi-energy as fuel.

Subject S.M. has become... the perfect vector.

The colony is immortal...""



Sudden SCRAPING from VENTILATION. Something tumbles out.

A CURSE VICTIM (man 30+). Body CONTORTED. Two BLACK, CHITINOUS SPIKES

protrude from his back. Eyes - solid BLACK COMPOUND LENSES. He HISSES and lunges.



FIGHT. Jason fends him off with a crowbar. Chitinous spikes SNAP

with a sickening CRUNCH. Alex fires a shotgun. BLAM. The creature

falls. SMALL SPIDERS crawl from the wounds.



SCENE 5: UNDERGROUND TUNNELS / SEWERS. NIGHT



Escape. A maze of wet tunnels. Sound of CLICKING CLAWS,

SKITTERING of many legs. Shadows move on the walls. Behind them -

MORE MUTANTS.



JASON

(gasping)

Gotta get to the water! The ship! It's the only way!



They burst out onto an old PIER. Dark bay water beyond.

Behind them - SCRAPING, HISSING. Mutants close in. Jason spots a BOAT.



JASON

(pushing Rachel and Alex)

Go! I'll hold them! Find him! Burn the nest!



He turns, gripping the crowbar, and charges the emerging creatures.

SCREAMS, THUDDING BLOWS, HORRIBLE SOUNDS of rending flesh.



Rachel and Alex, horrified, start the boat motor and speed away.

Last thing they see - Jason surrounded by shadows, the glint

of chitinous claws in moonlight.



SCENE 6: DEEP SUBMERGENCE VEHICLE ""NEREID"". DAY



Rachel and Alex in a cramped DSV. Descent towards ""Black Tide"".

Deeper, darker. Pressure CREAKS. Spotlights pick out DEBRIS.



ALEX

(watching sonar)

There it is... On its side. Cargo hold three...

That was his main lab.



They dock at a breach. Enter. The ship -

a SUNKEN TOMB. Water, silt, silence. Everything coated in silt and...

DENSE, GRAY WEBBING. It SHIMMERS in the lights.



SCENE 7: CARGO HOLD #3 / GRBAK'S LABORATORY



Spotlights reveal a HUGE PULSING COCOON

of webbing. Inside - the form of GRBAK (Fichtner). He's fused to the wall.

Body bloated, skin translucent, beneath - DARK MASSES

and THOUSANDS of GLOWING SPECKS (eggs). Face grotesque.

EYES OPEN - solid BLACK SPHERES.



Rachel finds a LOG BOOK. Beside it - an AMPOULE of bright-RED fluid

(""Protocol Omega"").



Suddenly, GRBAK'S EYES swivel towards them. The mouth opens unnaturally wide - a LOW, VIBRATING HOWL (Fichtner's voice distorted).



From SHADOWS, under DEBRIS, from VENTS crawl GIANT SPIDERS (dog-sized). MANY. On their backs - PALE,

DISTORTED HUMAN FACES. HISSING, CHELICERAE CLICKING.



FRENZIED ATTACK. Rachel and Alex fight back with FIRE EXTINGUISHERS

(wall of flame), crowbar. Alex yells:



ALEX

Flood it! Emergency flooding system! Lever there!



Points to a SEALED PANEL. Rachel fights her way to it.

Alex grabs the ampoule.



ALEX (to Rachel)

Flood it! ALL OF IT! I'll handle Grbak!



He charges the COCOON, smashing the ampoule on the crowbar. Red fluid

coats his hand and weapon. Rachel pulls the LEVER. ROAR of water blasting

through valves. Water rises fast.



Alex plunges the fluid-coated crowbar into the cocoon, into Grbak's body.

AN UNHOLY SCREAM (Grbak's voice + hissing). Grbak's body

SWELLS, BURSTS. Fountains of black slime and eggs. Giant spiders writhe, pop.



On a WATERLOGGED MONITOR - SAMARA (Carpenter's distorted image). Her image GLITCHES.

From eyes, mouth, shadow - STATIC, DIGITAL SPIDERS. The face fragments.



SAMARA (V.O.)

(echo, static, whisper)

You... freed... us...



The image dissolves into FLICKERING SPIDERS, dies in STATIC.

The monitor EXPLODES in sparks.



Water surges. Alex, smiling faintly, looks at Rachel.



ALEX

Swim! Now!



Rachel dives into freezing water, swims towards the DSV hatch.

Alex is swallowed by the darkness of the collapsing ship.



SCENE 8: EPILOGUE - RACHEL'S APARTMENT. NIGHT



Rachel home. In darkness. Drinking coffee. A PHOTO OF HER SON on the table.

Silence.



Suddenly - SCRAPING (chitin on metal). From the POWERED-OFF TV.



Rachel slowly turns. Black screen. Flares with WHITE NOISE, STATIC.



The static SHIFTS. Pixels form a COMPLEX, PERFECT WEB - a DIGITAL SPIDERWEB. It grows, fills the screen. Flickers.



CLOSE UP - Rachel's face. The web reflects in her eyes.

Deep, icy exhaustion. Understanding. The battle won. The war?



TV SCREEN - a pulsing WEB. In time with the TICKING CLOCK.



SLOW FADE TO BLACK.



THE END.



FINAL TITLES:

Soundtrack: CHITIN SCRAPING + DISTORTED VHS REWIND +

TICKING CLOCK + DISTANT INDISTINCT WHISPERS.

I committed to making a hundred of them, because I believe the repetition will help me learn and practice. I'm a pretty quick learner, so I headed to YouTube, and figured I'd pick it up right away.  🤣😂🤣 This thing about killed me. This took me over 8 solid hours to complete, and that was after a WEEK of trying to start and failing. I was holding on to that hook and yarn for dear life. My first two attempts were so tight I broke the yarn. My next two were better, but tight enough they curled like a piece of fried perch. Then I couldn't count/keep track of stitches to save my life (ADD). I used Sugar and Cream, which kept splitting on me like crazy, until after a week, I finally kind of got the hang of it. This is riddled with errors (but it's finished!  And not curling!) And I can see my tension is still all over the place. But I'm getting there. I was humbled by a dishcloth.

1lihes6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lihes6/i_cannot_pin_point_the_problem_but_it_bothers_me/,I cannot pin point the problem but it bothers me.,"I (28F) honestly don’t know what to do in my current situation, and I wanted to ask for your advice.

My husband (28M) co-owns a café with two other partners. All three of them are married. Around four months ago, while I was still working (just two weeks before I left my job), my husband and I were talking on the phone, and he suggested that I become the manager of the café after quitting my job. At that time, I didn’t get along well at all with the current manager of the café, and I said that I could take over after he left—but only if I could do it alone. I also made it very clear that I didn’t want any of the other partners’ wives involved in the management because having multiple authorities would only cause problems. My husband agreed.

After I quit my job, we were waiting for the previous manager to leave so that I could step in. Then I suddenly found out that one of the partners’ wives was going to take over too. Apparently, the plan was for the three of us—me, Sarah(28F, and Elia(29F)—to manage the café together. Sarah and Elia both got married to their husbands last summer, and Elia moved to our city after getting married. She’s a lawyer, currently waiting to open her own law firm, so she doesn’t really want to be involved with the café. Sarah, on the other hand, was a housewife because she didn’t like her own profession. So basically, it was going to be just Sarah and me running the café.

Before I officially joined, the three of us had a conversation where I clearly said I didn’t want to learn how to make coffee from the previous manager. Of course, I expected him to handle the management handover and I wanted to be present during that process—but I jus didn’t want to receive barista training from him. Since Sarah was friends with him, I asked her is she could teach me how to make coffee. She said that wouldn’t be a problem.

Right before the old manager left, Sarah shared a latte art she made on Instagram, and I complimented her, telling her I was excited for her to teach me. (I didnt even know that she started to learn but i guess that doesn't matter) She thanked me. But as it turns out, during that time, Sarah was actually receiving full manager training directly from the old manager. My husband never told me this either—I only found out by chance one day while sitting at the café. Again, I just said I didn’t want to learn how to MAKE COFFEE from him. Of course I wanted to be around during the handover process. 

Anyway, Sarah ended up becoming the café manager. At the time, I learned that I was pregnant and unfortunately had to terminate the pregnancy after just 1 week. It was an extremely difficult period for me. I’m just now beginning to feel like I’m pulling myself back together. At that time Elia asked me when i will start at the cafe and i said i am not sure right now. And told her about the pregnancy in private because i didnt want anyone to know about this except the close ones. 

For the past three weeks, I’ve been making desserts once a week to be sold at the café. I even paid for all the ingredients myself. But I never received a single thank-you—not from any of the three partners, nor from Sarah. It’s like it was just expected of me. The truth is, since Sarah took over, the café has been doing very well (which isn’t too surprising, given how awful the previous manager was). I’ve genuinely complimented Sarah for it as well.

Last week, I caught Sarah alone at the café and asked her, “If I started working at the café, would it disrupt the new system you’ve set up? I wouldn’t want that at all, because the café is doing great.” She suddenly got very serious and said, “To be honest, there’s no room for two managers. I even get bored during the day sometimes. Of course, I can’t tell you not to come, but if you come, I’ll leave.” I responded, “That’s totally fine. This café is one of our husbands’ sources of income after all—whatever’s best for the business.” But honestly, the way she said it really upset me. And I can’t help but notice her passive-aggressive behavior toward me.

Now here’s the current issue. The weather is about 40 degrees here—it’s insanely hot. My husband doesn’t like air conditioning, so we don’t have one at home, and I’m really struggling. Making the desserts takes about two hours (excluding chilling time), and one full hour of that is spent constantly stirring over the stove. It’s not something I want to do in this heat.

About five days ago, while we were chatting, we discussed the café’s upcoming second anniversary. They asked me to make 3–4 times more dessert than usual. I said that I wouldn’t be able to make that much on my own, that it would be really hard in this heat, and that I didn’t have space in my fridge to store them. Elia offered to help, and I said okay. But we never discussed it again after that.

Today is the café’s second anniversary. Yesterday, Elia, our husbands, and I took a day trip to the sea, which is about 3 hours away. By the time we got home, it was super late, and we were all exhausted. I completely forgot about the desserts. I even woke up sick this morning, and they were still totally off my mind. About half an hour ago, Sarah messaged our group chat (which includes Elia and me) and asked when I’d be bringing the desserts. I replied, “Sarah, I’m really sorry, I completely forgot about the desserts. I’m also not feeling well today.” Her response was, “I didn’t prepare any other desserts because I thought you were making them. (She just need to take out the dessert from the cafes fridge) Wish you had told me earlier. Anyway, there’s nothing to do about it now. Get well soon.”

By the way, when the old manager was around, all of us—wives included—used to pay for anything we bought from the café, unless you were one of the owners. But after he left, that changed. I mentioned this to my husband recently, and he said, “You’ve been making desserts for the café, of course you shouldn’t be paying.” But Elia doesn’t pay either. Neither does partners' siblings. 

Anyway, my thoughts are all over the place, so I’m writing this to get some perspective. What do you think I should do now? I can’t even put my finger on the exact problem, but whatever this is, it’s really increasing my anxiety and i am annoyed af. ",2,1750687383.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Tip - Don't see baby's sleep as broken. They are doing exactly what they should be doing - wanting to be near you and waking frequently. Instead of anxiously wondering when your baby will sleep like those influencer babies who sleep through the night with a calm (as if, helloooo witching hour) 1000 step routine, accept that your baby is wired to sleep differently and make things easier for yourself.

The natural variations in slate make each coaster unique. Some prefer the rustic look of unsealed or lightly sealed slate, while others opt for the sleek appearance of a heavily sealed and polished surface.

**Size and Shape**

Slate coasters typically come in a range of sizes and shapes to accommodate different types of glasses and mugs. Standard sizes range from 4 inches to 4.5 inches in diameter for round coasters and similar dimensions for square or rectangular coasters. Some manufacturers also offer larger, oversized coasters for wider mugs or decorative purposes. The shape can greatly influence the style and utility, with round coasters offering a classic look, square coasters providing a modern edge, and novelty shapes adding a playful touch.

The ideal size shoudl be large enough to fully contain condensation from most beverage containers without being cumbersome. Thickness is also a factor, with thicker coasters providing better insulation and a more considerable feel.

**Protective Base**

A key feature to look for is a protective base, typically made of cork or felt. This base prevents scratching of furniture surfaces and provides a non-slip grip, ensuring the coasters stay in place.The quality of the adhesive used to attach the base is also important, as a poorly attached base can detach over time with repeated use and cleaning. some coasters feature a full cork backing, while others utilize small cork pads at the corners.

The material chosen for the protective backing should be non-abrasive and durable. The cork backing is absorbent and grips well, while small rubber feet are often less absorbent but equally grippy.

**Personalization Options**

Many manufacturers offer personalization options, such as engraving initials, names, logos, or custom designs onto the slate surface. This adds a unique touch to the coasters,making them ideal for gifts or special occasions. Laser engraving is a common method, providing a precise and durable finish.The depth and clarity of the engraving can vary depending on the quality of the laser and the type of slate used.

The ability to add custom designs allows for creating wholly unique products. High-quality engraving resists fading and is easy to clean.

However, avoid placing extremely hot items directly on the coasters for prolonged periods, as this could possibly damage the sealant over time.A well-sealed slate coaster provides reliable protection from hot beverages.

Slate's natural properties make sure protection even without full sealing. The slow transfer of heat prevents immediate damage to furniture.

Why tariffs? Because these tariffs are damaging small businesses in particular, disrupting supply chains and business planning, and they threaten much more harm in the form of higher prices and inflation. The release of tariff news is enabling outrageous stock market manipulation. There is no coherent plan in evidence, other than chaotic disruption. Everyone will be affected if the pointless Tariff Wars continue.

They have also been promoted on the false premise that the tariffed country pays the tariffs. Nope, economists agree that tariffs are a tax that is ultimately paid by the citizens of the country imposing the tariff. The administration is promoting big tax cuts, while at the same time imposing tariffs as a ""stealth tax.""

Not something overly complicated — just a peaceful little place tucked away somewhere green, where women who love women could live, grow, and support each other without constantly being questioned or erased. A quiet kind of freedom.

I imagine waking up to the smell of coffee and fresh air, hearing someone tending to the garden or making breakfast down the path. Days would be filled with small, meaningful things — planting herbs, fixing things together, sharing books, cooking for each other. The kind of life where you know your neighbors not just by name, but by heart.

We’d have space for joy — movie nights under the stars, dance parties in the kitchen, late-night talks by the fire. Space for grief, too. For the heaviness that comes with living in a world that doesn’t always understand us. But we’d hold each other through it. No one would have to go through anything alone.

And when the outside world feels chaotic — politically, environmentally, socially — there’d be comfort in knowing we’ve built something resilient together. A community that shows up. That protects. That listens. A net that catches you when life gets heavy.

I think about how powerful it would be to sit across from women of different backgrounds and generations, just talking about life, about love, about what it means to be who we are — without the constant pressure to explain or shrink.

It’s just a passing thought most days. A quiet little dream. But there’s something really beautiful in imagining a life built on shared care, truth, and connection. Maybe one day.",2,1750687180.0,lesbiangang,0,1.0,False

Sometimes veterans also ask this question, but I believe not so often. 

So the thing is that you have done your chatting, you sent some pictures, you did a lot of ping pong in the chat, in the group chat. Now we will meet up first time for a coffee. Cool. 

But now what? How does this even work? Like, how do you *actually* initiate the play when it is kind of obvious what is going to happen? 

I know this feeling, it can be very weird because someone needs to be the brave and do the first step.

Well, there are different ways how to initiate it. 

**1) Start with sitting correctly** 

What do I mean by that? It is about the seating on the table, on the sofa, the bench, wherever you are with the other couple. Meaning: First you (I just assume you are the man), then the other wife, then YOUR wife and then the other man. 

This gives a nice opportunity to share touches, get closer to each other, the women are also next to each other (many assume and want MFFM anyway). You can touch the shoulders, lay your hand on the lap of the other one, etc. You get the point. 

Once you have reached this, you can continue kissing the hand, maybe do some hair stroking, stroking the thighs. Anything that gets you closer physically. 

**2) Games/Icebreaker Games**

Games are fun. But play the right games. Don't start playing Monopoly. You will not have fun tonight! Play some spicy games like a card game, a dare game where you pick a card (like Activity) and you need to do something. There are several offers online or to buy. 

You should start with icebreaker actions like ""Touch all body parts of the other wife, above the clothes"", or ""Remove everything but your panties"". This becomes very quickly very sexy and once you are topless or even did some intimate touching, maybe even oral? - you will go very quickly to the bedroom and continue there. 

**3) The Hot Tub** 

Many people like the Hot Tub thing because it forces you to either have a bikini and swimshorts on (which already makes the vibe a bit more sexy) or you decide to go full naked into the hot tub (which I recommend). Under water you can share touches, feel the skin etc. Great way to start and continue. That's actually a no-brainer and is very easy to execute. 

**4) Just take the leap of faith**

There is honestly not much magic to it. Someone needs to break the ice. You can just say ""*Wanna join me and \[the name of the other wife\] in the bedroom, we are off to have some fun*"". And you will grab the hand of the other wife, stand up and go to the bedroom. Then start kissing (if allowed), undress slowly, you can even tell the others to wait and watch what you are doing and then, once you are done with your introduction show, let them join and also get undressed.

Thank you Charlotte for this lovely safe space! You are the best!!! I want to apologise for my English it's not my first language. So AITA, for commenting on my sister's cat? I'm 35 years old, and my sister is 38. I love her so much, and admire her, I look up to her, but that is a normal thing. So in 2020 me and my partner bought a house, we were so happy, in love, but in April we separated ( there was another girl). Two months before that my sister bought a house also, they lived in another city, so finally they came back. I was over the Moon, we'll be together again, we will visit often I'll see my niece and nephew. But when we separated with my partner I was devastated and didn't told her, because I thought it wasn't important - she was moving, renovating the new house, finding kindergartens for the kids, she had enough on her plate, so didn't wanted to bother her. At the and of June we when on a little hike with tha kids, we talked and I told her that he broke off with me, and there was another girl. In August my partner and I talked a lot and got back together! I was so happy, and scared, but that is normal. We continue to work on the house and planned to live in it from September. And we moved. At the end of the month, my aunt, who loves animals, rescues a lot of cats, had a cat with babies, she gave the babies away, and gave on to my sister. The kids was so happy they had a kitten, my aunt was happy, that she find a forever home feeld with love... On day she called me ( I'm a cat person, I love cats), and told me that the kitten lives in my sisters bathroom, and the kids go play with it and it stays there. I was in shock, why ( I know the responsibility of a baby cat, I know the challenges but still) this is not a good place, the kitty can't socialise well, he is so alone and scared... I cried while we talked, so did my aunt. In a few days she called and continued to talk abou the kitten, I had a conversation with my mom. I noticed that when a I share something that we've did on the hous, with my sister she didn't reply, or it was a short answer, but I knew she had a lot on her plate so didn't bother her a lot... On day, mid November, I'm at a friend's house, and we are talking and my phone rings, but it was on Messenger, nobody calls me on Messenger, but I see it was my sister, I haven't heard from her in a while, so rushed to pick up. 
Me - Hi, What's up?
She - Nothing much, drinking my coffee, chilling, you?
Me - I'm at a friends house, can't talk, but still what's up?
She - Oh, okay... I wanted to know what is your problem, why I have to hear from STRANGERS what are you talking about me?! If you have problem you can call me, not talking about it with STRANGERS?!
Me - .... What?
She - Yeah, what's your problem with my cat?
Me - What? What's my problem with yoyr cat, well it us not good to raise your 
She - You can't tell me what to do, how to looke after my cat, nobody's asking you, you are not in my house, you are not part of my family, so don't talk it with STRANGERS!.... Why are so quiet? Tell me what is yor problem?!!?!
Me - I've tried to explain my self 
She - Nobody is asking you! 
And then I stopped talking, didn't know what to say, she wasn't listening, and I couldn't talke much, because I was at a friend's house, they don't need to hear, how my big sister is calling me, to yelled at me... And that was the last time we've spoke. We saw each other on my grandmothers funeral, we cried, hugged but that was all. I wrote her for the holidays ( birthdays, Christmas, New Year's, for the kids birthdays), but she didn't see it... We saw at my grandfather's funeral, we cried and hugged, and last month my grandma passed and we saw each other, but this time I didn't talked to her, didnt looked at her, as if she didn't exist.

Then later on he denies getting angry.,"So my boyfriend and I are together for about 1,5year. I don't  really know if this was always there and I'm just now recognizing it or if it's only the last few months.. But it's really bothering me lately and I'm completely starting to don't myself sometimes.

Everytime I try to talk about something to him that bothers me, he gets angry at me very quickly. If it's something I'm sharing my insecurities about, or if it's something simple around my house I would like him to be more considerate about. It doesn't really matter.. Even if I completely tiptoe  around it and be very careful with my words, it seems like he feels attacked and react very annoyed or even angry and no further conversation is possible. He raises his voice at me in his reaction and his face is angry. Its all there.

Before I tried to continue a conversation like that, because I wanted to be heard. Nowadays I just shut up the moment he gets angry and try to leave it there. But a few times now, after becoming quiet and let it rest for some times, I got back to him and told him I really don't like the feeling of not being able to share something with him without him getting mad at me. I even asked why he got angry at me.. And everytime he replies with: ""I wasn't angry"". It completely shuts down the conversation.. Because if he denies he was angry, how can I tell him he was? And if I say it does seem like he is angry at me a lot, he says I see it wrong because he wasn't  angry and I just always think that out of nothing. 

So I'm confused now.. He raises his voice at me, his face is angry and he says things like I'm seeing a problem that isn't there and stuff like that. He physically turns away from me or decides to walk out the room looking very irritated. Everything looks angry, but he says afterwards that he was not. 

Could it be that he really isn't angry but just communicates in a way I don't recognize or wrongly interpreted as him being angry? Or is he just avoiding all conversation about it? 

This also blocks me from having conversations with him about things that are bothering me. Sometimes small things like minor irritations about him in my house, like: him leaving coffee cups in the machine leaking all over, leaving the toilet seat up in the night, not putting his laundry in the right place on time to be washed but then needing his things washed last minute anyway (we have our own houses but because of renovations at his house he basically lives with me de last past months). But also about bigger things like trust issues after he lied to me about several things.. It's like I can't talk about that anymore, I just have to accept they happened and of things he does make me insecure about it again I should not talk about that. He expects me to trust him, regardless of the things he lied to me about. It doesn't feel fair..

And while I'm writing this all down for the first time I start to feel a little bit dumb because I can see how this must sound to outsiders reading it..  I don't want to sound naive.. 

I just want to hear from others who might recognize any of this and know what it might be and how to deal with it. Apparently I always make him feel attacked when I bring something up. But him denying his anger after he was angry at me in my eyes is very confusing. I want to get out of this circle without fighting. How do I do that? I do want to be able to express my feelings to him without being afraid of him getting angry. 


I'm sorry if some sentences look weird. English is not my native language and expressing myself in English about this is harder than I thought.

Tl;dr My(f32) boyfriend(m34) gets angry at me when I share something that bothers me. Then later on he denies getting angry.

Hi all.
So basically, we began dating 5 months ago. It has been quite an intense relationship from the very beginning, we fell in love very quickly and we seemed like the perfect match in every sense of the word. 
To give a bit of context, we're both lesbians, she has been in another long-term monogamous relationship (2,5 yrs) and me as well (3,5 yrs), but mine was almost entirely an online relationship even though we saw each other 2-3 times a year. So basically this is my first completely in-person relationship.

Two months ago, her mental health began to decline due to an anorexic relapse and other reasons. I have not been feeling in my peak either, I've had issues with some close friends as of lately, I've had a lot of work-related stress lately, and obviously seeing her bordering on a depressive episode has made me feel so helpless. None of us are going through a good time now.
Two weeks ago, we had a big fight because she didn't feel desired enough as we were not having as much sex as we usually do, this is mostly my fault, because when I'm going through a tough time my libido tends to go down a lot. Even though I've explained this to her before, she didn't seem convinced and I still think she relates it to me not being as attracted to her as in earlier stages of our relationship, which is not true at all. Last week we had another big fight. She told me that she felt like I was not as present and committed to the relationship as when we started dating, she felt like I had been lovebombing her at the start. What sparked the fight was me telling her that I would be travelling for 3 non-consecutive weekends throughout June and July (one was this weekend to visit my family, the other two are: a spontaneous weekend trip that my best friend invited me to because she won two plane tickets, and an invitation to go spend two days at another friend's house, I was notified of both on the same day of the fight). She told me that she felt like she was at the bottom of my list of priorities and that it was very wrong of me to leave her alone for three entire weekends knowing her mental state. To clarify, I do think I should've been more thoughtful about this before accepting those trips, I think she has the right to be mad at me about that and about ""feeling abandoned"" in that sense. I even offered to cancel one of the trips, but she didn't want me to. 
What I do not get, though, is she telling me that I have not been spending as much time with her recently. I sleep at her house more times than I do at mine. I find slots whenever I can to meet her for coffee or a walk or to have some drinks. I invite her to all my friend hangouts (although she insists that I don't do that and that she feels like I'm purposely excluding her from my friendgroup, somehow). She says that the time we spend together during work days is not worth the same as the time we spend together on weekends because ""I seem stressed and not as present as on weekends"", which really hurts because I go out of my way every single work day to ensure that we spend as much quality time together as possible, sometimes commuting for an extra hour just to go meet her for coffee. For context, she is unemployed at this moment, so I am typically the one who sets the dates because I have way less flexibility because, you know, work.
The thing is, most weekends we spend together as well... We've had a few group events lately so it is true that we have not had as much time to ourselves during the last few weekends (we kind of share the same friend network, there's a lot of overlap in terms of places and events that we go to, that's queer life in a city I guess). But that is still time spent together to me because after the event is done we go home together, sleep together, and spend the next morning together.
Anyway, after the fight I promised her that I would do better from now on and that I would be more mindful of her mental state when planning events and trips that don't involve her. I apologized to her profusely in every way I know, I stayed at her house to sleep even though I wasn't planning to, and the next day I invited her to have dinner out and some drinks.
As I said, I've been out of the city for the weekend visiting some relatives, I am travelling back as I write this. I received a bunch of lengthy texts from her last night telling me that she was feeling abandoned again because I hadn't been texting her back as much and that this was the perfect opportunity to show her that I cared and thought about her even when away, but that I had failed miserably. At the time of receiving these texts, I had texted her less than 8h ago. I had been texting her all through the morning and lunch and sending her pictures of things that reminded me of her. But during the afternoon I was low on battery and hanging out with some friends so I (understandably, I believe) was not texting back as often. She told me that ""your true colours are showing"" in regards to the way I act in relationships, that she feels abandoned and that she's just a commodity to me.

I don't know what to do. I genuinely don't know where I've gone this wrong. I love this woman with all my heart but all of the efforts I make for her and this relationship seem to go unnoticed or underappreciated. I do think we can fix this but righ now it feels like it's useless to confront her because it always seems like she's not going to believe whatever I tell her. 
I don't know how to confront her without her feeling like I'm gaslighting her. I think she's being unfair to me and not understanding at all. My feelings for her have not changed, but now I feel like I'm walking on eggshells and that next time I do something she considers a mistake, it's over.

Any advice on how to proceed?

We were doing a tour of the Caucasus. I’ve studied this region extensively in college, speak advanced Russian, and have visited nearby countries like Russia, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan. I know a bit of Georgian and always try to be polite, avoiding starting in Russian due to the obvious geopolitical sensitivities—but since Russian is still a lingua franca here, I’d end up using it when needed.

That said, I found a lot of people to be extremely rude in everyday settings—restaurants, coffee shops, hotels, even just walking down the street. I got stared at constantly, and not in the usual curious way I’m used to when traveling as a Black person, especially in the former USSR. These stares felt more hostile, like we were unwelcome. It was especially noticeable in Tbilisi and a bit in Batumi, although there were so many Russian tourists there that it felt like I was in Russia and a bit more familiar. Even got a great haircut by an Ossetian guy from Moscow. 

A lot of the men—many with buzzcuts and hard stares—just gave off this aggressive, skinhead-ish vibe. Got a lot of nasty looks from elders. And occasionally I’d try to break the bad vibes by saying gamarjoba to the onlookers. This helped about half of the time, but I’m not sure if I just surprised the hell out of them and that forced them to reciprocate or if they just decided to be polite back as I was trying to meet them in their comfort zone by speaking their language. I almost canceled this trip after reading about racism in Georgia online, but decided to give it a chance. Now I’m wondering if the standoffish behavior was because I’m Black, because we’re foreigners and probably look even stranger together, or just a reflection of the general mood in a country going through hard times.

People were a bit more relaxed in Kazbegi, and I did run into some really cool people here and there. But those experiences could probably be counted on one hand. The food and nature were amazing—honestly, the country has so much potential—but the social vibe really left a bad taste in my mouth. I was honestly really looking forward to leaving and so was my gf which is a shame. She tends to be the more positive one.

Anyone else have similar experiences? Especially Black or visibly foreign travelers?

1lih0cj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lih0cj,Have you read Valeria Luiselli’s Tell Me How It Ends: An Essay in 40 Questions (2017)?,"Have you read this book? 

Although it’s technically an essay, it reads like a short experimental novel, and although one might wish all the narrative threads in this book were fiction, sadly that is not the case, as this book is filled with true stories of undocumented migrant children seeking refuge in the United States.

Here’s a quick synopsis from the publisher, Coffee House Press: 
“Structured around the forty questions Luiselli translates and asks undocumented Latin American children facing deportation, Tell Me How It Ends humanizes these young migrants and highlights the contradiction between the idea of America as a fiction for immigrants and the reality of racism and fear—both here and back home.”

(FYI: In the past, Luiselli served as a legal translator for undocumented migrant children at the Mexico-US Border).

Aside from this book, Luiselli has published a number of other works, including the novels The Story of My Teeth (2013) and Lost Children Archive (2019), the latter of which deals with the same subject matter (just in case the title didn’t make that clear).

I’ve been curious to read Lost Children Archive but have not yet bought a copy of the novel. Has anyone here read it or perhaps some of Luiselli’s other works? If so, would you recommend them?

Tell Me How It Ends was first published in 2017, however, I believe it is even more relevant today. Personally, I feel Luiselli’s essay should be required reading for everyone in the US right now, considering all that is currently taking place here on our soil! ",2,1750686386.0,latamlit,0,1.0,False

[PART 1],"I don’t know if I should go through with it, quitting my job that is. It’s a sweet gig. I get eight hours of silence per day, valued at roughly 14 bucks an hour. I sit on my ass all day, sometimes typing a few things into the computer if a client can’t find a book. If my instructions are unclear to the customer, it’s the only time I have to leave the desk ;

Just to disappear into the maze of bookshelves.

I honestly couldn’t believe it at first either. Why would a library pay someone so much ? I’m not particularly interested in books. And they weren’t really looking for a graduate either. So I guess it’s a win-win for all parties involved.

I clock in at 9 AM on the dot, and I have to clock at 5 PM on the dot too. It’s in my contract. Which isn’t out of the ordinary. But my employer insists on it. “It’s part of the rules,” he says. Once I clock out, I’m free to stay in the library and dick around or eat snacks before going home. The owner, my employer, doesn’t mind me staying, as long as I don’t get too loud.

Today, I heard a weird noise when I clocked in. I looked around, looking for its source… But there was nothing. Weird. It’s an old building, so surely, nothing out of the ordinary.

I made myself some coffee before sitting my pretty ass down behind my desk, trying to put on my best customer smile. I think my boss wants me to stop calling them customers. And I guess he’s right, we don’t sell anything, except maybe a subscription. But nobody asked about it yet. I’ll probably call them “regulars” going forward. I often see the same people after all.

I checked in some books throughout the morning. Not noticing it was the same blonde lady coming back each time, well that is until her fourth visit at least.

“That’s a lot of books, uh?” I said.

I tried to start up a conversation, which seemed to startle her a bit. She lifted her gaze to meet mine, which is the moment I took in the full features of her face. A somewhat healthy pale face, her hair in a cool braid, barely visible crow’s feet, naturally pink lips, and a cute mole under her left eye. Then she spoke in a broken voice, like she just recovered from a cold.

“Oh… So… You do speak.”

I was dumbfounded by her answer! And it must have shown, because as I tried to find my footing in this conversation thing I was apparently so inept at, her voice broke my train of thought.

“I mean, I tried to talk to you a few times in the last few weeks, yet you never answered,” she continued. “I thought maybe you couldn’t speak and stopped trying.""

For all my faults, I had found someone who was probably just as bad as me at that whole socializing thing. But with a new angle of attack, I spoke up.

“I’m sorry ma’am. I must not have paid attention.”

“It’s alright, it seems to happen a lot with me, don’t worry,” she answered, with a hint of sadness in her voice.

But now that I think about it, I don’t remember that lady at all. I’m not bad at remembering faces, I should have remembered her. She’s pretty in spite of her age. And I’m a sucker for a pretty face. I took the time to get a good long look at her before answering. Which might not have helped the already awkward situation.

But I was sure of it now, I did not know that woman.

“Welp! If I can do anything else for you, please do give me a ring…” I caught myself. “I mean — there’s a bell. On the… On the desk.”

I pointed at the bell, blood creeping up my cheeks. I could feel myself blushing. Like the idiot I am. I quickly sat back down, taking her books for the fourth time, and logged them in — noting the return date, the titles.  
I noticed they were all borrowed in 1986. Oddly, no late fee.

I looked up at the woman, and she was already gone.

Odd. But no late fee implied I would keep my job even if she mysteriously disappeared in the library. Which she did.  
And my body was calling for food, so I did not give it much more thought. Surely she was just shy, and her task done, she went home.

Lunch time in the library was always a treat. The owner always brings a plate for me. And it’s really chef-level. I saw him reading culinary books when I stayed past my shift one time. So I guess he’s the one cooking? Today’s meal was marinated beef, with a julienne of carrots. And a delicious fudge cake as a dessert. Truly one of the highlights of my long day in the library.

During lunch break, the owner approached me.

“Miss Fay, you clocked in late today. Don’t clock out late.”

“Did I?” I wondered aloud.

I tried to find… Something in his eyes — annoyance, anger, a joke — anything. But it was only the cold realization that I did. He nodded. But didn’t really answer my question otherwise. After a few more moments of silence, he spoke.

“I hope you had a nice meal.”

He smiled, but didn’t really. His lips didn’t even rise. I’m still unsure what he meant. But it felt like suddenly I had been served my last meal.  
After this short interaction, he left, going to his office. Something he doesn’t often do when the library is open.  
I struggled to finish my delicious meal then went to clean the plate and tupperware for the fudge cake. At least, I wouldn’t leave dirty dishes behind if something happened to me.

Turns out, something would happen. Juste not to me. 6 books fell from their bookshelves, not all at once. For those who don’t know. That is not supposed to happen, either none of them fall or they all fall together. I made my way to them, and picked them up, one by one. I took some notes on my phone about which book fell down, in order :

\- 5 ways to sunday.

\- Prince's travel guide.

\- Me, myself and I, a self help book.

\- Roll tide : a southern encyclopedia.

\- Useful tips for cooking.

\- No way out.

After noting the titles, I wrote up a quick note to the owner. To have him take a look at those books and the shelves on which they were resting.

Then I watched and waited as the clock passed 4:59, and clocked out on the dot. Going home to my beautiful cat.

1ligwbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ligwbd/advice_on_how_to_deal_with_my_bfs_female_family/,Advice on how to deal with my bf’s female family,"Me (23f) and my bf (25m) have been dating for over a year now. We kept our relationship pretty private in the beginning because we both liked being in our own bubble. He did warn me that his family was very judgmental (aunts, uncles, cousins). I met a lot of his family on a trip to Colorado. I met his grandparents, sister (30f) , sisters fiancé (33m), the sisters best friend (25f), and his female cousin (30f). 

My flight landed a day after, so my bf came to pick me up at the airport with his cousin. I met her, we finished our greetings, she asked if I wanted to get coffee and I responded with “I’m good, I don’t drink coffee” she gave me a side eye type of face and my bf told me I had just offended her by responding that way because the cousin wanted coffee. Which I was like that’s fine, we can go get coffee but how is me saying I don’t want any bad. Anyways after that was probably the worst vacation of my life.

I still have yet to figure out what I did to the cousin and the best friend so intensely that they disliked me right away. The whole trip was filled with them ignoring me when I would start convos with them, making comments about my makeup/clothes, in one instance the cousin asked me if I had to stretch out my skirt to fit into it, and just more underhanded comments. What I had noticed as well was the sister, the sisters best friend, and the cousin would all talk shit to and abt each other. Whenever the cousin wasn’t around. The sister and the friend would talk shit about her. The sister, was clearly the leader but she would make fun of her best friends eating habits by commenting on how much she was eating, “you’re eating THAT much” “you’re hungry again? Didn’t you just eat” “oh you got a lot of bread.. I got a salad”. So I took that as their environment is very catty.
I’ve only seen the cousin and sister a handful of times, the sister is nicer to me than the cousin but not anything where I feel welcomed, just civil. The cousin on the other hand, she never greets me, she’ll walk past me and greet/hug everyone but me.

I swear to you I’m very mellow and calm. I know my manners and I’ve never had anyone’s family dislike me. Idk if it has to do anything with looks. I think we’re all conventionally pretty, I am younger and I am skinnier than all of them but keep in mind, the sister is very similar to my body type, the best friend is skinny but she’s tall, the cousin is probably the heaviest out of all of us but it’s nothing where I would call her big or fat. So we’re all similar in my eyes. Idk how to get on good terms with them ? Idk what I could’ve done wrong. So does anyone have advice on how to deal with this type of scenario ?

1ligrph,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_HotChiliColdChilly/comments/1ligrph/the_hole_in_bloody_bison_arizona/,"The Hole in Bloody Bison, Arizona.","In southern Arizona, almost to the Mexican border, lies an almost abandoned mining town. If you were to sneeze while driving by you’d more than likely miss it. For good reason, no one ever moves to Bloody Bison, Arizona. The single stoplight, and McDonald’s that smells of fermented urine, offers very little reason to stay. The people of this town are just as dry and prickly as the desert itself. The people of Bloody Bison are used to loss. If you are to die there it will either be because you accelerated the process of your own death or you “disappeared.” The pastor’s son, Doug Geigle, hung himself after his untreated religious psychosis led him to believe that his death would resurrect Jesus Christ. The elderly school marm, Janet Pear, died in her classroom after breaking her hip the day of summer break and starved to death in her locked classroom. The real unlucky victims, however, are those that vanish into thin air. The most famous of which was Braun Booths. 

Braun was one of those men that earned his name. His body was sculpted by years of hard labor. Having the same physique of a gym sock stuffed with walnuts, Braun could make a diamond cry. He stood at six feet and five inches and nearly weighed 300 pounds, all of it being muscle. It wasn’t his frame that made him the stuff of legends though. He was all action. Every story that was relayed from resident to resident seemed more and more fantastical than the last, but with Braun you were inclined to believe them all. Before her death, Janet recalled how he hoisted her Volkswagen bug onto his shoulder and replaced her flat tire with his free hand. Rick Pratchet loved to tell everyone that Braun had once lept from one side of the flooded two lane road to the other side. Braun then did it again with the Pratchet’s dog that had wandered to the other side before the heavy rainfall. 

That’s what made his disappearance so odd. He was larger than life. His home still had his truck keys on the kitchen table, his work gloves right next to them. A pot of coffee was boiling on the stove, completely evaporated by the time anyone noticed he was gone. And his trusty dog Fudge was starving, waiting for his master to fill his bowl. Fudge, a chocolate lab, led those who found him through the barren land, following Braun’s scent the whole way. The local police started the search, and those who had horses finished it. The brutal trails prevented most humans from trekking up the way Fudge led them. But Braun was the heart of Bloody Bison. He was a good man who loved his community. A community that loved him right back. That’s why when the only evidence they found of him was an empty carton of his favorite cigarettes, those who could leave Bloody Bison, did. And those who couldn’t died in the same town they were born. 

August 12th was a hot day. You couldn’t cook an egg on the sidewalk, partially because Bloody Bison never put the funding into them, but also because the egg would fry before hitting the earth. Braun’s cattle were a hard-headed bunch, but he cared for them all the same. That’s why he never complained that they destroyed his fence posting more than the wildlife or the harsh environment. He also didn’t complain because repairing his fence came as easy as breathing does to most. The cattle never came when he rang the bell that morning. This was odd for a number of reasons. Ellis, Braun’s largest bull, was always in the pen before Braun could even toss the hay in there. Ellis was not there. The other reason why this was odd was that none of the cattle could be seen for miles. Braun cussed under his breath, as if he were afraid to anger his lord, and saddled his steed. Sprocket was a strong horse. Any horse would have to be to let Braun ride him. 

Braun quickly found his first cow, or rather what was left of it. He had seen animal attacks before, but this wasn’t a regular attack. There wasn’t bloodshed. There weren't any bite marks. There wasn’t a sign of struggle. Instead, the broken mangled corpse of Missy was covered in a thick, viscous substance. As Braun took a closer look he could see that it was actively breaking down the hair, skin, and fat of the beast. A single tear rolled down his weathered, sun-blistered cheek, but he knew he had to act quickly if he were to save the rest of his herd. He hopped onto Sprocket’s back and the two blazed across the horizon. Never had he seen something so sinister. It was as if the cow had been deconstructed in front of him. Late into the night, Braun nearly had every steer rounded up and returned. Ellis was yet to be found however. Against his better judgment, he saddled back up and rode into the unforgiving desert. The night time was a scary time to be alone in the southwest. You have chupacabras from Mexico, skinwalkers from Utah, and worse of all men from Arizona. Braun didn’t fear any of them. Chupacabras and skinwalkers were stuff of legends, and any man from Arizona that could kill Braun hadn’t been born yet. 

The wind whipped dust and sand in the air, lowering visibility. The worst part was that it made smoking Braun’s last cigarette impossible. Despite the wind howling in his ears, he could still hear Ellis’s call. And as long as he could hear him, Braun wasn’t going to stop searching. Further into the mountains he rode. The mountains that would consume him entirely. 

Ellis had wandered into a strange cave earlier in the day, for he had smelled what he assumed to be oats. As he stumbled into the inky darkness, the shade cooling the sweat of his back, Ellis started to feel an involuntary pull. The beast beat his hoofs into the earth, but the pull did not relent. The pull broke his ankles. His mooing turned into a scream. Despite the unlikely odds of survival Ellis fought anyways. This meant very little to the cave. The second the bull entered the gaping maw its fate had been sealed, for it wasn’t a cave it had entered. The foul creature that laid beneath the earth could not be described by man, but by a human name instead. Whether you’d call it a devil, or monster, it was synonymous. God could not create such a corrupt soul, and Satan would not allow it passage through hell. The putrid flesh of the creature could manipulate smell, and the undulating throat could produce all sorts of mimics and cries. What made it really dangerous was the fact that it didn’t need to feed. What it had done to the first cow was out of sport. Fun, almost. As if it was proving to itself and the rest of the herd that it could do it. 

Braun approached the cave with reckless abandon. Ellis was his prized bull, making him a wealthy man amongst the breeders in the southwest of America. Armed with a nine pound hammer, and his reliable six shooter, Braun dismounted Sprocket to enter the pitch black abandoned mine. He had always heard stories of this particular mine. Back in 1919 a team of seven miners were tasked with the job of mapping the mine. None returned. Not even their equipment was retrieved. Braun chalked it up to a story to scare children from taking any thoughtless risks. Now he wasn’t so sure. No one is an atheist when the ship starts to sink. He lit his lamp, and his last cigarette and took his final living steps. He could hear desperate calls, affirming his suspicions that Ellis had stumbled in and got stuck. The lamp light glistened off of the sides of the tunnel into the mountain, slick and warm to the touch. Braun would pause to listen at forks in the cave to determine which path to take. Unfortunately for him, all paths led to hell. The weak calling from Ellis was still deep in the shaft, but Braun was determined. He put out his cigarette and flicked it to the ground. The further down he traveled the more he felt this journey was for naught. The calling of the cow grew stronger though. And almost more lively. Braun started to pick up the speed, hopeful his bull would be right around the corner. 

In the belly of the beast, Braun found his prized bull. Just not how he wanted. Tendrils were pulling the beast apart, snaking through tears in the skin and emerging from the mouth, just to enter back in through the eyes. The natural gas produced by the gut of this horrid monster illuminated the space. Sensing the man in the room, it decided to toy with him. It puppeted the carcass. Mooing first, then screaming deeply and gutterly. The scream of a child, then a man, then finally a baby. The lamp fell to his side as Braun fell to his knees. The hot acidic vomit expelled from his throat and nose. That’s when the enzymes rose. The thick viscous liquid reached his ankles first. It dissolved his boots, socks, skin, muscle, and bone. As he tried to stand, he found that he had nothing to stand on but the stumps of where his feet used to be. He tried to lean against what he thought was a wall, but even the wall was burning his flesh. Braun released a scream loud enough to shake the earth. He pleaded with God, then pleaded for his mother. The monster's cruelty reached its climax when it used the skin of Ellis to mimic what sounded like one thousand horrible laughs. The brain being the last part of him to be digested, Brauns brain rushed with dopamine. His final thought being a dirty joke he once overheard at the local bar. 

Bloody Bison, Arizona is a nearly abandoned mining town. Those who can leave, do. Those who can’t, die there. And just beneath Bloody Bison lies not just evil, but possibly the very devil himself. And on a quiet night like tonight, where the only sound is your own heartbeat, if you listen closely you can hear the devil feasting once more.

**You don’t need to be rich to start investing. But you do need to stop scrolling past your future.**

If you’re reading this with $0 in your investment account and $27 in your checking, you’re not behind-you’re right on time.

Because here's the truth no finance bro on TikTok wants to admit: most of us didn't grow up learning how to invest. We learned how to memorize algebra formulas, not how to build wealth. And in a world where everything from groceries to rent costs more in 2025, just “saving” isn’t enough anymore.

You're here because you're done watching your money disappear into overpriced iced coffees, random Shein carts, or just...vibes. You want your money to actually *do* something.

This isn’t going to be some generic “just buy stocks!” guide. We’re breaking down what actually works when you have limited money, zero experience, and more questions than answers.

Let’s start at square one-the stuff no one explains before you click “Buy.”



# What You Need Before You Invest Your First Dollar

**What account do you need to buy stocks? (Brokerage vs. Robo-advisor)**

Here’s what no one tells you: you can’t just Google a stock, hit “purchase,” and boom-you’re a Wall Street player. You need an investment account. The two main types for beginners are:

* **Brokerage accounts**: Think of these like DIY toolkits. Platforms like Fidelity, Vanguard, or Robinhood let you pick and buy stocks, ETFs, and more. You’re in full control.  
* **Robo-advisors**: These are auto-pilot investing apps (like Betterment or Wealthfront). You answer a few questions, and the app invests for you based on your risk level.  

**Which one’s better for beginners?** If you want to learn and play around with small amounts, go with a low-fee brokerage. If you want zero stress and set-it-and-forget-it vibes, robo-advisors are your move.

# How much money is enough to start investing in 2025?

You can start with $1. Seriously.

Thanks to fractional shares (available on apps like Fidelity, Schwab, and Cash App), you don’t need $300 to buy Tesla or Apple stock. You can own 0.0034 shares of it-and still earn returns proportionally.

But let’s get real: to actually feel momentum, try aiming for $25–$50 a month to start. That’s less than one overpriced night out. Build the habit first. The big numbers come later.

“Plenty of folks in r/personalfinance and r/investing have started with $10/week auto-investing plans. It’s a low-stress way to build the habit without feeling overwhelmed.”

# Should beginners invest during a recession or inflation cycle?

Short answer: Yes, but smartly.

Recessions and inflation sound terrifying. But for long-term investors? They’re actually discounts.

Historically, the best investors buy *during* market dips-not after the hype fades. Think of it like buying winter jackets in March when they’re 70% off. Stocks work the same way.

But here’s the key: don’t try to time the bottom. That’s where beginners blow up. Just stay consistent (we’ll show you how with dollar-cost averaging in the next section).

📘 **Insight Bomb**: In *The Psychology of Money* by Morgan Housel (Chapter 4: ""Confounding Compounding""), he explains how time-not timing-is what makes investors rich. Start small, but start now.  


# The Easiest Stock Market Strategy for Total Beginners

If your brain shuts down the second you hear “portfolio diversification” or “P/E ratios,” breathe. You don’t need to decode Wall Street jargon to build wealth in the stock market.

You just need one simple investing strategy that:

* Works in 2025’s economy (yes, even with inflation still lurking)  
* Doesn’t demand hours of research  
* Won’t blow up your savings overnight  

Let’s start with the MVP of beginner investing.

# What is index fund investing? (And why it's safer)

Imagine investing in *every* big-name company in the U.S.-all at once. That’s basically what you do when you buy an **index fund**.

Instead of betting on one stock like Apple or Meta, an index fund spreads your money across hundreds of companies. Think of it as a group project where everyone actually does their part.

The most popular option? **The S&P 500 index fund.** It tracks the top 500 U.S. companies-so you're investing in Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and 496 more in a single shot.

Why it’s clutch for beginners:

* Less risk (because your money’s not tied to just one company)  
* Lower fees  
* It beats most professional investors over time (no cap)  

If you're looking for passive growth and not drama, index funds are your go-to. And yes, they’re available on apps like Fidelity, Vanguard, Charles Schwab-even Robinhood now offers them.

“If you want a dead-simple long-term plan, check out the kind of ‘set-it-and-forget-it’ portfolios shared in r/Bogleheads. A lot of people there stick with index funds, automate their contributions, and just let time do the work.”

# Dollar-cost averaging vs. lump-sum: what works better for noobs?

Let’s say you’ve got $1,000 ready to invest. Should you dump it all in today-or break it into smaller, regular chunks?

For beginners, **dollar-cost averaging (DCA)** wins. You invest the same amount-say $50-every week or month, no matter what the market is doing.

Why it’s smart:

* It smooths out the rollercoaster of the stock market  
* You buy more when prices are low, less when they’re high  
* You don’t have to guess the perfect time to invest (because nobody can)  

Lump-sum investing can work, but it’s way riskier if your timing is off-which most beginners struggle with. Unless you’re immune to regret, go with DCA. It's boring. It's beautiful. And it works.

**Mobile-friendly reminder**: Set up auto-transfers from your checking to your brokerage app. If it’s automatic, it becomes your financial muscle memory.

# Avoid these 3 rookie mistakes that burn new investors

**1. Chasing hype stocks from social media** If it’s trending on TikTok or Reddit’s front page, it’s probably too late to profit. By the time you're buying, the early crowd is already cashing out.

**2. Going “all in” on one company** Yes, Nvidia is cool. No, putting 100% of your money into it is not a flex-it’s a gamble. Diversify, even if you're only investing $10.

**3. Freaking out and pulling out during market drops** The market *will* dip. Your job is to not panic-sell. Dips are discounts. Zoom out, not freak out.

📘 **From the book vault**: In *A Random Walk Down Wall Street* by Burton Malkiel (Chapter 9: “The Investor and Their Advisors”), the author shows that trying to time the market or beat it with flashy picks almost always underperforms boring, consistent investing. The takeaway? Boring gets rich. Fast rarely lasts.

# Which Stocks (or ETFs) Are Actually Safe to Start With?

If you’ve ever stared at the endless list of stock tickers like they were cheat codes in a video game, same.

But here's your move: don’t start by picking random companies or throwing money at trending stocks. Start with what's *proven*. Think low-risk, low-maintenance, long-term safe bets. That’s your launchpad.

Let’s cut through the noise.

# 3 ETFs that beat most beginner portfolios

Most beginner investors either try to handpick stocks (too risky) or just sit frozen (too common). But ETFs-**exchange-traded funds**\-solve both problems.

Here are three ETFs that have built wealth for millions and are still strong plays in 2025:

**1. VTI (Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF)** Covers the *entire* U.S. stock market-small, mid, and large caps. One of the best all-in-one bets for long-term growth.

**2. SCHD (Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF)** Focuses on strong, stable companies that consistently pay dividends. It’s like passive income in your portfolio.

**3. QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)** Tracks the Nasdaq-100, meaning you get exposure to tech giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia-without betting on just one.

Each of these ETFs has a different flavor-growth, income, or diversification-but all three give you exposure to dozens (or hundreds) of companies in one shot. Set, forget, build wealth.

# Dividend stocks vs. growth stocks: which are better in 2025?

You’ve probably heard these buzzwords flying around: **dividend** vs. **growth**.

Here’s the breakdown:

* **Dividend stocks** pay you a portion of the company’s profits-usually quarterly. They're slower-moving but steady. Think: Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson.  
* **Growth stocks** reinvest earnings to expand faster. They don’t pay you now, but can grow big over time. Think: Tesla, Shopify, Nvidia.  

Which is better? Depends on your vibe:

* If you want slow, reliable money trickling in = go dividend.  
* If you want to bet on big future wins and can stomach swings = go growth.  

Hot tip: You don’t have to pick one. A mix of both gives you stability *and* upside.

In 2025, with interest rates still unpredictable and inflation simmering, dividend stocks are having a moment again. But don’t sleep on long-term growth potential.

# What to avoid as a beginner: hype-chasing, overconfidence, and single-stock risks

**If you're investing because a random guy on Twitter (or Threads, now) said “this stock is the next Amazon,” pause.**

**Here's the hard truth**: Hype stocks often burn first-time investors. You chase the pump. You hold too long. You lose money.

**Avoid:**

* Stocks mentioned in viral TikToks without any actual data  
* “To the moon” Reddit threads in low-mod subs like r/pennystocks  
* Companies you can’t explain in one sentence  

Real investing should be *boring*. That’s how wealth is built. FOMO is not a strategy.

📘 **Game-changing insight**: In *Unshakeable* by Tony Robbins (Chapter 5: ""Silence the Enemy Within""), Robbins says the biggest threat to your investments isn't market crashes-it’s your own panic and hype-chasing. Long-term calm wins over short-term chaos.",1,1750685415.0,TheFinanceTrending,0,1.0,False

After 3.5 months of pumping, with a supplemental trial of alimentum rtf and also a trial of nutramigen, both of which failed (maybe due to soy oils?) I am ready to re-enter formula hell and trial pepticate. We have been on bm only for the past 6 weeks and LO is thriving, but I am not. This diet is for the birds. I am constantly over analyzing every symptom and assuming a slip or a new allergy. I don't go out to eat anymore and don't get to go to coffee shops bc I fear cross contamination. Anyway, even though I am heartbroken over this decision, i'm just hoping to hear those of you that have had success with pepticate. We've made it pretty close to baseline on bm with fluctuating mucus poos-- but colic is gone, gas is passing easily, skin is clear. Reflux hasn't been great since his 2 mo vaccines but im kindof anticipating it to get worse on pepticate. He's on famotidine which i'm not sure has ever helped. He's had only 1 oz of pepticate two times so far, mixed in to his bm bottles. Both times he spit up when his reflux is typically silent. ",1,1750685184.0,MSPI,0,1.0,False

1ligiga,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1ligiga/pricing_changes_and_letting_go_of_customers/,Pricing Changes and letting go of customers. Thoughts and Musings,"I wanted to provide the group with some thoughts and things to consider when you need to determine whether to raise prices or not. This is some anecdotal thoughts and musings of a software supporting the Outdoor Hospitality Industry

I purchased a business from a previous owner who was charging his customers about $15 a month for monthly, quarterly, and annual subscriptions to a reservation software. In some cases he gave customers 10% discount on annual subscriptions and 5% for 6 month subscriptions. 

If you do the math that's $162 base subscription, 10% discount which comes out to $146. Now, take that number at times it by 300 customers which is $43,800. However, if you factor in other discounts and some customers being open for only 6 months, he was making far less. 

This platform enabled his customers to make hundreds of thousands, and in some cases millions of dollars, so paying a software at that rate was a steal. 

I knew right away that this wasn't scalable, and supporting 300 customers with <$40k a year wasn't going to cut it. Additionally, they were on legacy code software, so that too had to change

So, I knew right way that I had to have the code rewritten with modern features, and adjust the pricing, but before I did, I wrote down these thoughts:

* How many customers will leave once I introduce new pricing
* Who are my ICPs
* The customers that leave, were they my ICP, or were they just using the software for the price
* When I introduce the new system, how should I handle support? Do I allow phone calls or just emails with a knowledge base?
* What can my ICP afford

I'm not going to answer each one for you, but the biggest one is identifying my Ideal Customer Profile. I learned that there were quite a few paying customers that weren't my ICP from a size and annual revenue perspective. These customers were more likely to baulk at price, have entitlement, and require the most support. 

For example, I had one customer that was a small cabin. He was with the software for 6 years and had a connection with the previous owner. However, they weren't my ICP and I informed them that I wasn't going to build products/ features for their type of business. They felt entitled and felt that I should accommodate their request considering their old relationship with the previous owner. 

Hold that customer in your mind for a moment. 

After I built the new platform with updated features, it was time to unveil the pricing change. Not to give away too much, but the pricing increased 2100%. Now before you spit your coffee, the price increase is per usage and can be pushed to the end customer/ traveller. So, in our new pricing model we charge customers for every new reservation made, but in the travel industry the guest/ traveler pays the booking fee- not the owner. 

When it comes to support, we decided to create an extensive knowledge base and support via email to reduce the amount of phone calls. Having a person answer phone calls 24/7 was going going to be a direct cost, that we weren't going to absorb. 

After the announcement, we were flooded with questions and hate emails. However, most of the hate emails were from...you guessed it ""non-ICP"" customers. 

How much did I lose? I think we lost about 20% of our customers, but about 95% were not my ICP. These customers cared more about price than value. Remember, our platform enabled them to make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for 5 plus years. The new platform was going to make them 25% more in revenue with zero cost to them. 

You remember that customer with the cabin? They sent over 30 support emails asking for new features that fit their specific need, complained about the UI, and didn't appreciate that we did not provide phone support. They did not want to use the Knowledge base and wanted a dedicated phone agent. 

Well, I told them that this software may no longer be for them, and they are no longer a customer because I didn't cave into their aggressive emails or requests. I stood my ground. 

  
Conclusion and key learnings:

1. It's important to identify your Ideal customer profile and know how to serve them. I knew what my ICP could afford and their pain points. I doubled down on serving them and reduce the support for non-ICPs. 
2. Don't be afraid to trim the fat. It's not personal, it's business. 
3. Don't chase customers that don't fit your marketing and pricing strategy
4. Don't be afraid to raise rates. If your customers see value, then raising rates shouldn't be a problem. 
5. Always factor in operational costs when looking at support. Phone support is good, but training your customers on videos, articles, and self help is better. Do not exercise a customers ""lazy muscle"". Make them be part of solution, not the problem
6. Don't be afraid to tell a customer costs. A customer asked why we didn't offer phone support, and I broke down the cost and who would pay for that cost. Needless to say, they never asked about phone support again and they use our knowledge base extensively. ",1,1750685089.0,SaaS,1,1.0,False
1ligier,https://i.redd.it/f9yz9q0lho8f1.jpeg,"Raising Canes is opening in Wethersfield tomorrow, and it’s going to be a traffic nightmare. Who thought this spot was a good idea?","As you can see, turning left out of the new Raising Canes will require driving through at least 4 lanes of traffic from both directions, and there’s no traffic light at that spot. The vast majority of people will likely need to turn left, because that’s where the on-ramps to both 91N and S are. The only people who’d turn right are likely Wethersfield residents, anyone else would need to turn left to get home. 

This looks like a bad spot for any business, nevermind one that’s going to bring an insane amount of traffic. There’s a traffic light just passed Rasing Canes, which probably makes things worse, because regular traffic will be backup up from that light and blocking Raising Canes. 

Police are apparently going to be directing traffic for the next few weeks, but I still anticipate this being a nightmare. Avoid this area for the foreseeable future.

1lighwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/mounjarouk/comments/1lighwu/honestly_im_struggling/,Honestly? I’m struggling,"Last week I only ate 7300 of my 9800 calories and I lost 2.9kg. Okay, I had a really bad tummy for a couple of days and couldn’t eat much but realistically I’m struggling to eat one meal a day.

I’ve been eating variations on a stir fry pretty much constantly over the past 7 weeks. I’ve switched from chicken to beef as it’s higher in protein, and my meal is about 9 portions of fruit and veg. I missed my protein target by almost 300g last week. I’ve looked into protein drinks and snacks but they’re full of sugar, loaded with calories and/or taste like crap. The only one I like is Muller Myprotein mousse. It’s 20g of protein and I have one pretty much every day. 

Since I’ve been taking Mounjaro, I haven’t been eating carbs. This is not a conscious decision, I just don’t want bread, rice, pasta or white potatoes. I have been eating sweet potatoes, to the point that I’m kind of over them right now. Yesterday, my son made me put noodles in my dinner because I was so under my calories for the day. Then I couldn’t finish it. I ended up picking the meat out just so I wouldn’t waste protein. 

One thing that I can change is the number of calories I allow myself per day. 9800 is my seven day allowance, which is 1400 a day. But I was getting hungrier on the weekends (Monday is jab day) so I changed it to ~1200 Monday-Friday and ~1800 on Saturday and Sunday. I’m thinking I should  go back to having an equal amount of calories every day and increase to 1500 (10500 a week). 

My main concerns are that I’m not getting enough protein, I’m not drinking enough water (recently it makes me feel uncomfortably full), and that I’m losing weight too quickly. Because I am prescribed Mounjaro for diabetes, I’m not sure if I get a choice whether or not to move up to 7.5mg next week. I feel like if I was paying for this myself, I’d want to stay on 5mg for a bit longer. I am exhausted. I don’t know if it’s because I’m not eating enough or if it’s the Mounjaro in general, but I’m so tired. 

If anyone has any suggestions or advice for me, I really need some help. Links to meal ideas or any other nutrition resources would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading. 

(For reference, my average meals go like this:

Breakfast: coffee with collagen, and either a small KitKat or a Muller mousse or Weetabix/Bio&Me granola if I’m actually hungry

Lunch: Very rare I’m hungry so most days, nothing, sometimes a couple of Babybel and two hard boiled eggs. 

Dinner: Chicken or beef stir fry with mixed vegetables, mostly green veg, with a homemade sauce and a baked sweet potato, followed by half a pack of strawberries and half a pack of blackberries with a plain Greek yogurt) ",3,1750685051.0,mounjarouk,1,1.0,False

1ligdjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1ligdjt/how_to_actually_read_study/,How to ACTUALLY read / study??,"Hello!

I am seeking advice on how to actually read / study in an effective / meaningful way.

For context, I was diagnosed pretty recently (in my 30s) and am on 70mg elvanse + 2mg guanfacine. I’m still new to all this and trying to find out tips that actually work. 

I am starting a Masters degree this year, and it is a HUGE financial / time / life investment - I had to sell my flat to pay for it and I’m moving countries - so I really want to get as much as possible out of it. 

I got through my previous degrees by doing nothing all year, then cramming for the last month, pulling constant all nighters and living on energy drinks and coffee. I barely remember anything I studied and those opportunities feel totally wasted.

This degree requires a lot of steady work all the way through, including loads of pre-reading every week for every seminar. It’s a very intense course and heavy on reading / essay writing. I really want to be able to engage with the material, rather than just BSing my way through and getting the piece of paper at the end.

Does anyone have any tips on how to actually read a lot of material and take it in, in a reasonably efficient way? The only way I know how is to take extensive notes on what I’m reading, but I won’t have time to do that for this high volume of stuff. Even on the 70mg elvanse I feel like it takes me forever to actually take in a paragraph of text. My reading speed / comprehension is good, I just can’t focus at all. 

I have realised that I take in audio info much more easily, so I’m trying to listen to podcasts around the topics I’ll be studying, but that doesn’t solve the problem of having to read large volumes of papers / academic books.

1ligcm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/etiquette/comments/1ligcm3/vacation_home_etiquette/,Vacation Home Etiquette,"I (55M) have a best friend Dave(55M), who I am not sure I would consider him a best friend anymore. He lives about 4 hours from me, but have been friends since we were 18 and we talk daily and visit each other several times through the year.  I am a first generation American (parents are from Italy and Greece). In our culture, I was raised that you treat your house guests with a place of honor. The guest always gets the better accommodations than the host, you serve them good meals, you basically make them feel like a loved member of the family when they visit. But being that I am one generation down from my parents and raised in the states, my friends and I tend to be a bit more casual with each other. However, everyone knows that when they come to my home, they get a bit more of a special treatment than they get from their ""American"" friends. 

Long story short, we have a family vacation home down in Naples, Fl in a luxury resort. Rather posh and beautiful, with lots of amenities. So periodically, I will invite friends to come down for a week or so. One of the customary things we do when we arrive is we go to the market to do a big food shopping trip for the week. I usually end up paying for all the groceries, but sometimes a friend will also contribute if they want something specific. Like I said, we are casual about things, so thats fine (But I think my parents would gasp knowing a guest paid for anything.) 

However, when Dave comes to visit, he literally does nothing and I am waiting on him hand and foot. He will come to the market and pick an overabundance of things we should buy without thinking that we are only there for a week and this is too much food. Also that I am paying for this. I always shop so that no perishables are left behind when we leave.  Then the entire time we are there, I am cooking all the meals...breakfast, lunch, and dinner. He may make himself a cup of coffee, but doesn't even make me a cup when he is doing it. Does not help clean, does not help do any meal prep, and leaves stuff around the house. Every other friend that comes helps me cook or says lets rotate the cooking, so that I am not cooking every meal nonstop all week. When I am doing my own laundry, Dave always has something for me to throw in for him, but does not initiate or do the same for me. When we go out to eat, the check is always split. Never offers to buy me a meal to say thank you for hosting him. The mans hand is never in his pocket. 

He has been to our vacation home with me more than my own brothers have. His last trip with me there was two years ago because after the last trip, I was done. He got mad because he arrived before me and a third friend did...our flights were three hours delayed. I called him and told him the code to the house and how to let himself in and help himself to anything that might be there for food. So he went to the market and bought a couple things to make that one meal. When we got there, food was waiting, but he had already eaten. But then complained that he had to wait around for us and he cooked ALL THIS food. Like we made the plane late. The whole week we were there, I did about 50% of the cooking with the other half of the time our third friend and I switched off with each other. Dave contributed nothing financially, nor cooked ever again. 

Is it wrong for me to expect Dave to help when he is there? I know I am the host and they are guests, but if he were to go to a hotel with the same amenities and space and treatment (not to mention access to our car we keep there), he would be spending thousands for the week.  I am providing him with a home, meals, laundry, and he is just hanging out and wondering when our next visit will be. I have not had him there since the last trip, which was probably the 20th time he was there. 

  
As a side bar, when I visit him, I sleep on a pull out downstairs in the living room and there are times when he literally thrown the sheets down the stairs to me to make my own bed when we are going to sleep. I keep my things in a corner next to the couch, because Dave is always on edge when someone is in his home and things are even remotely in his way. I also always clean, never make any requests, pay for a round of drinks when we are out or at least buy him lunch. He will reheat a carton of soup and call it dinner.

Marketed as a Japanese-inspired drink that boosts energy, digestion, and skin health, it’s got people wondering—**does it actually work, or is it just clever marketing in a pretty bottle?**

This review breaks it all down: ingredients, claimed benefits, real user feedback, side effects, pricing, and whether it’s worth your money.

[**>Order Nagano Tonic from its Official Website Today**](https://www.wiredaily.com/lp/nagano-tonic-site/)

# What Is Nagano Tonic?

Nagano Tonic is a modern wellness drink inspired by the traditional health practices of Nagano, Japan—an area known for its remarkably high life expectancy and emphasis on natural, nutrient-rich diets. Drawing from centuries of Japanese health wisdom, this tonic blends time-tested ingredients like matcha, yuzu, and fermented botanicals into a sleek, ready-to-drink formula. Its goal? To help your body and mind perform better every day, naturally.

At its core, Nagano Tonic is designed as a **functional beverage**—not just something that tastes good, but something that actively supports your body. It targets key areas like digestion, energy levels, immune function, and mental clarity. The formula is packed with antioxidants, adaptogens, and probiotics that work together to reduce inflammation, support the gut microbiome, and deliver a clean energy lift without the jitters or crashes of caffeine.

What sets Nagano Tonic apart from typical supplements or energy drinks is its commitment to **clean, plant-based ingredients**. There are no artificial sweeteners, preservatives, or synthetic fillers. It’s meant to be a daily ritual—a small, consistent choice that contributes to long-term wellness.

[**>Order Nagano Tonic Before the Stock Runs Out**](https://www.wiredaily.com/lp/nagano-tonic-site/)



The product appeals to a wide range of people: wellness enthusiasts, biohackers, busy professionals, and even those just starting their health journey. Whether you’re managing stress, trying to improve focus, or simply looking for a way to feel better without relying on pills, Nagano Tonic is positioned as a simple, natural solution.

In a market flooded with gimmicky health drinks, Nagano Tonic stands out for its **roots in real cultural tradition**, its modern delivery, and its emphasis on whole-body vitality. It’s not a cure-all, but it’s a smart, functional addition to anyone looking to support their wellness from the inside out.



# What’s Inside: Key Ingredients

Nagano Tonic sets itself apart with a thoughtful blend of plant-based, bioactive ingredients grounded in Japanese wellness traditions. Each component is selected not just for its cultural relevance, but for its proven functional benefits. Here’s what goes into the bottle—and why it matters:

# Matcha Green Tea

Matcha is the cornerstone of many Japanese health regimens. It's rich in **catechins**, especially EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate), known for fighting inflammation and oxidative stress. Unlike coffee, matcha offers a **calm, sustained energy boost** thanks to its combination of natural caffeine and **L-theanine**, an amino acid that promotes relaxation without drowsiness.

# Yuzu

This aromatic citrus fruit contains high levels of **vitamin C** and **flavonoids**, supporting immune health and reducing inflammation. Yuzu also adds a refreshing, lightly tart flavor that makes the tonic enjoyable to drink—no artificial flavoring needed.

# Japanese Knotweed

Often overlooked in the West, Japanese Knotweed is a powerful source of **resveratrol**, the same compound found in red wine. It’s been linked to **cardiovascular protection**, anti-aging effects, and skin support—making it a multi-benefit addition.

# Probiotic Blend

A diverse mix of **beneficial bacteria strains** helps support a balanced gut microbiome. Probiotics play a key role in digestion, mood regulation, and immune response—especially when taken daily.

# Fermented Rice Extract

This ingredient taps into the Japanese tradition of using fermented foods like miso and sake. Fermented rice enhances **nutrient bioavailability**, helping your body absorb vitamins and minerals more efficiently.

Together, these ingredients create a synergy that’s both **science-backed and deeply rooted in culture**—a rare combo in today’s wellness market.



# What Are the Claimed Benefits?

Nagano Tonic positions itself as a **daily health enhancer**, offering a combination of physical, mental, and aesthetic benefits. Unlike single-function supplements, this tonic is formulated to address multiple wellness goals at once. Here’s a closer look at what it claims to deliver:

# Sustained Energy Without the Crash

Thanks to matcha green tea and L-theanine, Nagano Tonic offers a smooth, jitter-free energy lift. Unlike coffee, which can spike and crash your energy, this combo is designed for **mental clarity and sustained focus** throughout the day.

# Improved Digestion and Reduced Bloating

The probiotic blend and fermented rice extract support a balanced gut microbiome. Regular use may help reduce bloating, regulate digestion, and even support better nutrient absorption, especially if your current diet is low in fermented foods.

# Glowing Skin from Within

With antioxidants like resveratrol from Japanese Knotweed and vitamin C from yuzu, the tonic supports **skin health at the cellular level**. Users report brighter complexions, less inflammation, and improved skin texture over time.

# Sharper Focus and Mood Support

Adaptogenic properties and gut-brain support from probiotics may help regulate mood, reduce brain fog, and promote a more focused, calm state of mind—making it ideal for high-stress or high-performance lifestyles.

Together, these benefits make Nagano Tonic a **wellness multitool**—hydration, nutrition, and functional support in one clean, daily dose.



# What Do Users Say?

Nagano Tonic has stirred up buzz across wellness spaces—from TikTok reviews to Reddit forums and health blogs. While individual results vary, the general tone is **cautiously optimistic**, with many users reporting noticeable benefits, especially with consistent use.

# 👍 Pros (What People Love)

A common theme among positive reviews is the **energy boost**. Users describe feeling more awake and mentally sharp, but without the jittery edge that comes with coffee or sugary drinks. One Reddit user wrote, *“It’s like my brain wakes up without my heart racing—subtle but powerful.”*

Another widely praised effect is **improved digestion**. People who struggle with bloating or irregularity have noted smoother digestion within a week of starting the tonic. This is likely due to the probiotic content and fermented ingredients.

Many also enjoy the **taste**—described as a light, refreshing citrus flavor with hints of green tea. Unlike overly sweet or synthetic-tasting health drinks, Nagano Tonic is praised for being clean and drinkable.

# 👎 Cons (What’s Not Working for Everyone)

The biggest downside for many is the **price point**. At roughly $40–$50 a bottle, some users feel it’s not sustainable as a long-term daily supplement unless they notice dramatic results.

A few users reported **minimal or no effects**, especially within the first few days. This may point to individual variability or unrealistic expectations of instant results.

Lastly, some experienced **mild detox symptoms** like headaches, fatigue, or irritability—most of which faded after a few days of use.

# The Takeaway

Most agree: **Nagano Tonic works best when it becomes part of your routine**. Like any wellness product, consistency is key. For those who commit, the benefits appear to compound over time.

# How to Use Nagano Tonic

Using Nagano Tonic is simple, but like most functional health products, **consistency and timing matter**. Most users report the best results when taking it **once daily**, either in the morning to start the day or about 20–30 minutes before a meal to support digestion.

The product is available in two formats: a **ready-to-drink bottle** and a **concentrated dropper version** you can mix with water, tea, or juice. Both deliver the same core benefits—choose what fits your routine best.

# Tips for Best Results:

* **Shake well** before drinking to evenly distribute the active ingredients.  
* **Drink plenty of water** throughout the day to help your body process and eliminate toxins, especially during the first week of use.  
* **Pair it with a balanced diet**, rich in whole foods, to maximize nutrient absorption and gut health synergy.  
* Consider journaling your energy, digestion, and mood for the first 2 weeks to track subtle changes.  

Making it a habit is key. Nagano Tonic isn’t meant for one-off boosts—it’s built for long-term support.



# Side Effects or Safety Concerns

Nagano Tonic is generally safe for most people. However:

* Some users report mild detox reactions (headaches, fatigue) in the first few days  
* People sensitive to caffeine (from matcha) should watch their dosage  
* Pregnant or breastfeeding individuals should consult a doctor  

There are no known serious side effects, but as always, check with your healthcare provider before starting any new supplement.





# Price and Where to Buy

Nagano Tonic isn’t cheap. Here’s what you can expect:

* **Single bottle:** Around $49  
* **Monthly subscription:** \~$40/month with discounts  
* **Available at:** \[Official Nagano Tonic website\], select health stores, and occasionally Amazon  

Look for first-time buyer codes or email signup discounts. Some sites offer a 14-day trial or satisfaction guarantee.





# Final Verdict: Is It Worth It?

**Nagano Tonic delivers**—but it’s not a miracle. It shines if you’re looking for a natural energy boost, better digestion, or support for skin and mood. The ingredients are legit, and many users feel a real difference within 1–2 weeks.

If you're budget-conscious or expecting instant results, it might fall short. But if you’re into daily wellness rituals and enjoy premium products, it’s a solid addition.





# FAQs

**Does Nagano Tonic really work?** Yes, for many people. It supports digestion, energy, and focus—but results vary.

**How long before I see results?** Some notice benefits within a few days, but most see changes after 1–2 weeks of consistent use.

**Can I drink it every day?** Yes, it’s designed as a daily supplement.

1ligc63,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1ligc63/vsgbariatric_folks/,VSG/Bariatric Folks,"Hi everyone! Diagnosed with PCOS in 2003 - I'm a 2016 VSG patient who was 360 pounds (5'10"") at my heaviest - went down to 240 the first year and then did two years of keto and a 2x a day exercise regimen to get to 195 in 2019. I had skin removal surgery in 2021. At that point I maintained 195-205 for a while, and then lifestyle changes (divorce, remarriage, and a baby) resulted in getting back to 270 in 2024/2025. I started Zep six weeks ago after sobbing that I just didn't want to do 'it all' again. I loved how I looked and felt at 195 pounds, but when I say that my life revolved around a keto diet and exercise routine, I'm not kidding. I did nothing but workout and meal prep, and yes, it worked; but it obviously wasn't sustainable. 

With Zep I'm loving the lack of food noise, the energy, the clear headedness; I want to exercise, I'm craving healthier foods, and overall feel incredible. I am wondering though, for the people who have been on zep, does this subside with time? I felt great the first year after my VSG too, in control and healthy....for people who have been on this med for an extended period, what has your experience been? 

Right now I am controlling portions and focusing on protein, but I'm not going crazy counting macros and logging all my calories. It's been really, REALLY nice to not be exclusively focused on my food and exercise routine and still be losing 3+ pounds a week. I'm also allowing myself to have things that I never would have allowed previously (like a pump of vanilla in a coffee or last night was a couple bites of birthday cake at a celebration) it feels like moderation for the first time in my adult life, and I guess I'm hoping to hear that this isn't just because it's 'new'. 

 I'm down 18 pounds since 5/16 and was just increased to 5mg as the food noise the two days before my next shot was getting loud.

I'm looking for an upgrade: 1) something new, that perhaps produces an even better cup 2) I hate how the mammoth beans I get from some of my local roaster just bounce around in this thing increasing grind time, 3) just a bit done with the hand grinding, considering electric for speed and ease

I've done some reading and see the K-Ultra, Fellow Ode Gen 2 still come up as favorites. I also looked at pathways that offer versatility for pour over now and an espresso setup later (DF64, NZ, Timemore 078, DF83). Burt tbh I hate how unnecessarily expensive things are in this hobby and can't bring myself to spend >$400.

On the way back from our family holiday we were listening to podcasts with Reddit stories and because the holiday was again a whole event, I thought it could be interesting to share this situation here and see what you guys have to say. 

My brother inlaw (38) is a complicated man... to describe him I would say: he acts like an annoyed spoiled teenager stuck in a grown man's body. 
I don't know even where to start, it has been 6 years I am in this family and every holiday, Christmas, birthdays, Easter and summer holidays we spend together are somehow ""ruined"" with his drama. 
It was never that big of a deal, everyone just let him be and throw his tantrums. But since he had a kid (3 years old now) it bothers me more and more. 
My biggest problem is that NOBODY says or do anything about. They all think he is unaware of how much he upset everyone with his actions and therefore he's somehow allowed to be like this. 

He slams doors, screams at people, not at me, but usually at his parents and his son quite a lot. He mocks people, toll his eyes about a lot of stuffs. One of his hobbies are music and he acts like nobody can say anything about music, because he is the only one allowed to because he knows what he's talking about. 

Let me give a situation:

we are on a table having breakfast on our first day of holiday, he finally wakes up (already in a bad mood) moaning about ""is there any coffee here?? Where is coffee??"". If someone moved a chair out of the table and there's no place to sit he starts speaking loud again ""can't I sit down here anywhere""?? If there's no coffee he will either go back to his room (slamming the door) or he won't make coffee for himself. 
His wife often asks ""is there any coffee left for my husband?"" 

Whenever he finally sits on the table if he son is running, he will suddenly screams ""SIT DOWN NOW, LUCAS!!' or something like ""BE CAREFUL AND SIT DOWN!""  Then 2 minutes later will talk to him in a lovely tone of voice. 
He seems to enjoy the attention of screaming, because his son is never really in danger when he starts screaming this things. We all have been with him playing and running around on the kitchen for at least 3 hours before BIL came to the kitchen. 

Other small story but that repeats every Christmas: he always screams at his mom about anything! It's like she's not allowed to ask him anything... 
A simple question like ""are you still gonna eat this?"" And he will roll his eyes and say ""LINDA, CAN'T I JUST EAT?"" Or he's telling a story and she throws a question in between ""you're talking about my mom?"" He starts ""SHOULD I HAVE CALLED HER GRANDMOTHER FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND?"" 
Or he loves also saying ""CAN I FOR ONCE SPEAK UNTIL THE END???"" 

He enters a room slamming doors, he leaves a room slamming doors. He's always on his phone, he's often sleeping.
He almost never bring his son to bed, and he never stands up at 7h when he son wakes up. His wife is always the one that does. 

Now so you all can understand, this is not my opinion only. We all gather around to talk about him when he leaves. Everyone is relieved. Including his parents (they don't say that, but they comment about being stressful when he's there), but no one wants to talk to him. Because he will be defensive and more aggressive. He will be dismissive and it will only make it all worse. Everyone is afraid of him somehow.

He treats me ""well"" except a couple of unfunny racist comments about my accent or the way I speak. 
He treats his brother (my husband) well, but he is never really interested. He never ask us/him anything about his life. He never really show interest in having a relationship.

After this last holiday I am fed up. I am tired of this behavior, I am tired of everyone being upset when he decides to comes to activities because he will be grumpy complaining about everything and or distant like a dark teenager. I am tired of nobody saying a thing. 
This time I did make him aware a couple of times of his behavior, whenever he spoke with his mom bad I said ""she just asked you a question"" and he rolled his eyes like ""whatever"". Once he was trying to shish us when we were talking and I stopped talking and said ""are you shushing me?"" He said ""no!"" 
I also comment about him being loud, but he just dismisses it. 

I don't know what I can do. I just know that I don't think I can continue long holidays if he comes along. 
Me and my husband are trying to have a baby, and I keep imagine being pregnant or with a newborn around him and I know i would flip. 

Does anyone has any advice to what can i do? 

Also, be free to ask more questions I just mentioned here a couple of situations. But there's a lot more.

1lig4vn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1lig4vn/my_marketing_system_for_finding_a_bride/,My Marketing System for Finding a Bride!,"Alright, so I kept sharing this that I had a full blown marketing system to find a partner for myself when I was looking for a partner back in 2020 - 2021. And I did.

What’s impressive about it is that it worked beautifully. And so I wanted to write it down so that I document it and learn marketing lessons from it that i can implement at other places.

Now, the idea here was not to lose the humanity of the process, but rather to make the process of finding a partner somewhat predictable.

Before I implemented this, I was really struggling to meet the right kind of girls, since most of the meetings were happening through parents (arranged marriage situation) and I was okay with the process of it but the women that I was meeting were far away from my mental wavelength. So I the meetings and conversations were very difficult and cumbersome and ofcourse I had to say No to them.

Now, this is not to say that there was anything wrong with them. Somehow people really take these No’s personally when it’s not that way, it’s just not the right fit for a person. And not just people, but entire families! So I had to be careful when I would say no, by finding some random reasons and without bringing my family into the picture, especially if some relative had connected the girl to us.

For almost 6-8 months I was just seeing the process of Arrange marriage unfold.

After 8 months, I realised that everyone involved was completely clueless. My parents were clueless about how to bring the topic up, talk about the thing, what all to ask, what not to ask etc. Other people were clueless as to how to help or share about it. All anyone could ask for was a “Biodata” which is literally a list of all the family members and their businesses/occupations (conventionally). It tells you literally nothing about the person except for their height, age, complexion and educational background. It’s worse than a resume. And a job you can still change, a marriage, ideally you won’t.

It was weird to see all of this. We were inviting guests at home who were coming to “see me” (yes the movie script has shifted, now the girl’s family comes to the guy’s house to see their home, what he does, where he lives etc. Movies are still showing the old reality). And once they were there, we would talk about everything except for what they were at our house for. We would speak about weather, real estate, state of education etc, but not about the girl and the boy. That would only come about at the end, last 15 mins when they knew that it’s time to leave. And then suddenly the discussion become, what do I do, what plans for future, where would I/we stay, etc. The real talk in a way.

I would literally laugh inside my head. After a point I had those answers memorised! Haha

Anyways, I’m sharing all this so that you understand the state of affairs before. And I haven’t even shared about the Online Shaadi platforms. They have their own ways of working and the profiles are actually not made/handled by the girl or boy, rather by the parents or brother/sisters. Super weird when you’re used to dating apps.

Now, one day I sat down and took things in my hands. I said that the way things are going and the kind of girls I’m meeting at the moment, I would never find the right partner. And I knew that it’s a “Market of ONE” that means, it doesn’t matter how many women I meet or talk to, all I need is just one right person, THE right person.

I realised that I majorly had 5 channels which I could leverage to find potential partners - Family (Arranged Marriage), Friends (All previous relationships happened through friends), Online Platforms ([Shaadi.com](http://Shaadi.com), Jeevansaathi etc), Communities and Social Media, and finally Events and Miscellaneous.

Now the important thing to note here is that I had to put mself out there intentionally so that I could attract the right kind and right amount of people.

Once, I identified the channels, next step was to activate them with the right messaging. Now, this is where it becomes crucial and it’s all self work.

Before I created the messaging, I had to sit down and imagine the ideal person that I wanted, what kind of person is she, how would she talk, what would she talk about, where did she study from, what kind of person would she be. This sounds voodoo and weird, but it’s true. The moment you have a clear idea of the ideal person that you want in your life, the entire process actually becomes extremely easy. Simply because you now can create a well defined way of screening the people that you’re talking with and have a clear Yes/No answer without guilt or confusion. You’ll also be very clear about the places/communities/avenues of where you’d potentially find your person, so your efforts are focused.

Second thing that is needed before the messaging, is your boundaries/rules. Things that you decide for yourself and for others to interact with you. Again, this is a mix of personal preferences and also things that screen out the people who are not a good fit.

Putting both of these down is HARD WORK. Really difficult to do but extremely valuable.

I created this for myself. And one of the promiment things for me here was that I wanted a person who makes her decision by herself and that meant that she would not allow parents/siblings to make life decisions for her, which meant that she would be the person handling her own profiles on these Shaadi apps.

Now, earlier, there was no messaging by us/me. We were just like the rest of the profiles and biodatas because we adhered to the rules of the platforms or what was conventionally happening. But once I got clear on the ICP (Ideal Client Persona) and my Boundaries/Rules, I could put those forward.

Namely, what I shared with my family was that I don’t want to talk to the family members first, I will only take a conversation forward if I speak/meet with the girl first. It was difficult to do, but my parents really pushed it forward in the family and the kind of conversations I was having was dramatically different. Similarly, on the platforms, I mentioned it in my bio that I am not interested in texting for days, rather would like to get on a call and speak in detail. And clearly stated that I uold not be speaking with the family before speaking with the girl.

Now, this took some time to settle and bring in the results, but earlier when I was getting 40 matches maybe 1-2 were relevant for me, and now once I shifted the messaging, I was getting maybe 10 matches but 8 of them were relevant and willing to get on a call.

It was a dramatic difference, really.

But it doesn’t end there. Remember, “Market of ONE”? Now, in order to Zero-in I had to take them through a funnel. My funnel was this: 5 Channels → Call (where I would qualify them with my questions) → Coffee (vibe check) → On going conversation.

Seems simple, and it is, but the real skill is in the intentions of each step + the skill of manuevering the conversation.

So, once we break it into a funnel, it becomes a numbers game.

No. Of profile matches (20) → No. Of Calls (15) → No. Of Coffee (5) → ongoing conversation (2) (Monthly). That’s it.

For my qualification, I created a list of about 25 questions that I would ask in my first call with any person. Those answers would tell me if I should explore this further or not.

At the coffee, it was about physical attraction and vibe check. Does it feel natural or forced? Are we able to hold the conversation or not?

And then, from there on, it flows into conversations about life and friends etc. Hopefully getting to a place of making a life changing decision.

Ofcourse, knowing if she is the right person for you or not, in itself is a big question and I had my thinking behind it as well, but that’s for some other day!",4,1750684076.0,Arrangedmarriage,2,0.83,False

He’s an amazing guy when he’s sober-ish. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him truly sober, except the one day after a big fight caused by…well, I’ll let you guess. Even then he had to have a drink or three because he was shaking and sweating it out. 

Usually he’s amazing. Brings me a hot coffee every morning before he leaves for work. Helps me clean and take care of things. Makes me laugh and lets me complain endlessly about work and life in general. Am amazing hard-working man.

When we’re drunk we’re not good together. I’m a bipolar people-pleaser with a history of trauma and when I’m trashed I get honest. And sometimes mean. I’ve been having arguments with drunks for almost two decades and I’m tired of it. They go nowhere. There’s no logic. Nothing gets resolved. Just treading water with a shell of a person you care about. It brings back traumas from childhood and occasionally gets so frustrating and hopeless that I hurt myself. 

I’m so tired. I have a fatty liver. I’m overweight and get out of breath going up a flight of stairs. I don’t enjoy anything anymore and I’m so sick of fighting. I don’t care how annoyed I get with drunk people anymore, I’m not going to get pressured into having a shot or binging 5 drinks in an hour so I’m less annoyed.

The Friday before this past Friday I was at a sapphic night at the club and passed by this gorgeous woman who smiled back at me as I walked by her and I turned around and just knew I had to say hi and get her number. But by the time I did have the actual courage and beat my anxiety I turn around and she disappeared entirely. Kept dancing but was sad I’d never see her again.

The next evening I go to a pride event nearby to have fun and clear my mind and a few hours in, I run into her and pass by her again and we smile at each other again. I’m in total disbelief. We were both headed in the same direction towards the stairs to sit and take a breather, and so I sit down and she sits down behind me for some reason. And I bite the bullet and turn around seated and say hi and introduce myself and that I think I know her from last night in the club. And we smile and talk and I get her number and some other folks would butt in and try to get her insta but she would turn them down. And then we would walk around and explore a bit then watch the performances until she was tired and then right as she left she texted me first and said she wanted to hear me yap more about my favorite movies. 

Then after a few messages I asked if she wanted to either go see a horror movie or rock climb and she said she loved to go rock climbing. So we did a few days later and had dinner where we talked a lot more and she opened up about being neurodivergent and was such a great listener and focused on me the whole time. And then said she liked hanging and was gonna be at the same club again a few days later if we wanted to see each other again. That was last Saturday night. Note we don’t seem to text 24/7, just mostly evenings/nights after we both work 

So I went and she met up with me and chatted and at first there were some awkward silences but I tried to ask her questions back and she to me to get to know each other and joke here and there while we watched the event on the dance floor. We took turns buying each other shots and drinks. She mentioned she loved vampires and wanted to go see Sinners, then I ask if she wanted to go see it in theaters sometime together and she happily agreed. Then we walked across the street to get burgers where we talked more deeply and personally about our lives and family and other stuff about us being queer and values etc. Then we walked back to the club as it got dark and had more shots and danced. Sometimes she’d dance with the other gay guys who’d approach us, sometimes with other sapphics who’d approach us, but mostly me, although I was way too much of a scared coward to ask to hold her hands and waist while dancing…

It was at this point when she went to the bathroom for a break and came back and told me she met a cute girl in the bathroom who invited us to dance with her friends and may have been given the number of and I shrug and say why not. So we go over and dance with them then the bathroom girl whispers something in her ear and kisses her hand and leaves with her friends.. and then her and I keep dancing together and she stuck with me. I ask her if she can tell if people are into her, she says “No, my autism makes it hard for me to tell if someone’s flirting and I need directness!” and I nod and we keep dancing. 

Then I tap out and she offers her arm and I cuddle into it as she walks me to the bathroom to take care of me and make sure I was ok. Then she told me she’s also tapping out but that she had a good time. I asked her again as we walked out if she was still down for the movie and she smiled and said yeah. Then we left for the night and text each other after we got home safe.

The next afternoon I text her how she’s feeling and she says great and that she’s getting coffee with a friend and asked me how I felt back. Then I reply and then silence for like 8 hours. Then while I was watching a YouTube video I thought of her and sent her another message about it and she replied immediately to it and to my other messages and said she was sorry she’s a horrible texter. And I said it’s fine no worries and how was her day? Then silence again. She likely fell asleep early due to work in the morning today but still. Feels like I’m pulling teeth now. We didn’t used to talk 24/7 but more so for a couple hours per evening. But now idk if she likes me that way enough…. But I really like her and our date-hangs or whatever this is and i think I wanna make it more clear if or when we see a movie together. 

TL;DR: met a neurodivergent lesbian at pride who I’m really into and we’ve gone on a date or two but after clubbing together is less responsive but we agreed to see a movie soon. Should I keep pursuing or give up? ",3,1750682747.0,actuallesbians,10,0.81,False

So I gave up dairy sort of half heartedly for about a month to see if it helps with my baby’s reflux, fussiness,etc. He gains weight well, has no skin conditions and doesn’t have bloody stools. Sometimes he will have mucous-y poops but that’s about it. Hence my less than perfect elimination diet - he would seem fine and then less fine almost randomly so my husband and I chalked it up to just an under developed digestive tract. I still was “mostly” dairy free for a little over a month.

Yesterday I ate an unusually large amt of dairy - pizza at lunch, sour cream in tacos at dinner and ice cream (I know, at this point I thought it really wasn’t the culprit). I BF him normally all afternoon and evening. Last night he slept through the night (8pm to 5am, with one non-feed fussing wake up at 12:30). Zero spit up. FIRST sleep through the night!! Fingers crossed.

This morning I had a coffee around 6 which is earlier than usual and I was so happy and stunned about the night going so well. I fed him again around 7:30 and he spit up like projectile multiple times everywhere. Large amounts. Like 5x the normal amount.

So the million dollar Q … if dairy is the culprit, shouldn’t he have been fussy yesterday? Or not necessarily? Did my caffeine impact him more because I normally drink it while BF, not before.

1lifikc,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TopNeedleworker6106/comments/1lifikc/the_flat_note/,The Flat Note,"Have you ever laid awake in bed, held captive by your own racing thoughts? You turn over and over, each position seemingly comfortable at first. It feels fine for a precious minute, until something nagging in your mind tells you that you cannot stay put—just a pinprick in your thoughts. The rational side tries to push it out, telling you that you’ll go to sleep eventually if you just keep still and close your eyes. But, eventually, your other voice wins, because if you don’t move right at that moment, you might just go insane. Try as you might, you need to adjust. And then you do, and the cycle repeats. Each time, for hours at a time, again and again, you simply must adjust.

I was an amateur composer. It was always my dream to be a musician. I was a freelancer,  and I had finally found a good gig, composing music for a short horror film. The filmmakers had previous success with another film, and now they were creating a new film that was already receiving some positive attention amongst horror fans. 

I had managed to fit a grand piano into my mid-sized apartment, and it was my prized possession. I always fleshed out my ideas on that thing. It felt a lot more freeing than playing on my smaller keyboard on my desk.

While working on the soundtrack, I was composing something that sounded like a funeral march one day on my piano. It was in the key of F# minor, with booming low chords and a higher melody. All was going as normal, until I hit the D6 key. It sounded incredibly out of tune and jarring. “Strange,” I  thought, as it had sounded fine only a moment earlier. Not wanting to go through the trouble of tuning, I moved over to my work desk and pulled out my keyboard. As I was moving through the progression again, I hit that same D6 and it sounded just as out of tune. I had no idea why it would sound like that on an electric keyboard. 

At this point, I figured my ears were playing tricks on me. I grabbed a tuner and played the same note. On the tuner, it was perfectly in tune. It still sounded awful and jarring to me. Perplexed, I decided to take a break for the day. 

This singular event was not a huge setback. Uncomfortable with the realization that I had maybe become tone deaf to a singular note, I elected to avoid it altogether. I moved the key up a whole step, and that was that. My writing continued as normal the next day.  

The next night was a different story altogether. I began to develop insomnia—my mind wouldn’t stop racing. Tossing and turning, I couldn’t switch my brain off to fall asleep. I don’t remember what was going through my mind, I just remembered not being able to make my thoughts stop. When I finally did get to sleep, I had a strange dream. I was in my apartment—at least, in my head, it was supposed to be my apartment. It was nothing like my apartment. Visually, it was what looked like an endless parking garage.

 The lights were bright with a yellow tinge, the hardwood floor and drywall had been replaced with concrete, and there was a wall with openings that peered out into a starless night. My piano sat in the corner, and as I stepped closer I saw that all the keys were a yellowed white or a faded black. All save for one—the D6 key. Instead of white, the key appeared to be void of reality. I can’t describe it now that I can’t see it, but in the moment that’s how I understood it. An absence of matter. Instinctually, I went to press the key. As soon as I reached out and played, my ears began to ring as the note, indescribably horrible and grating, echoed out in the parking lot. It sounded impossibly loud, and I found myself unable to pull my arm back. The note repeated as my ears begged for silence, over and over again in short intervals. 

Just as I thought I couldn’t take any more, I awoke, standing upright, the note still playing over and over, but quieter. It was almost completely dark. Just as I wondered why the note was still playing, I realized my finger was still pressing and depressing a piano key.  I looked down and, as my eyes adjusted to the faint light, I realized I was standing between my seat and my piano, my finger still pressed down on the single white key. 


This has become a common occurrence. I am sleeping at best three hours a night, at worst maybe an hour.

…

I’ve taken to sleeping during the day. The nightmares don’t happen when I sleep with the sun out. Though I’m still finding it hard to sleep, I’ve found a short-term solution to this problem: two generously-poured glasses of whiskey and black-out curtains in my room. 

My schedule has changed over to strictly working at night. I don’t even touch the grand piano anymore, and have draped a large sheet over it. It makes me sad, but I don’t want to ever think about those dreams anymore. 

Recently, I also started covering all my mirrors. The reason for this started the other night, after taking a bathroom break. While washing my hands, I looked up and didn’t recognize myself. All my features were slightly off, and I felt like I was staring at a 3D sculpture of myself made by some alien who didn’t quite understand human anatomy. My eyes were too far apart, my nose looked like it ended too far above my mouth, and my face wore a dumb, inhuman expression. It looked like an otherworldly stranger trying to impersonate me. Looking at it was horrible, but I couldn’t look away. The same ringing started in my ears, and that same note started playing again, impossibly loud. This went on for I don’t know how long, until I blinked and found I was standing in front of my piano again, sheet pushed up just enough to reach the keys, playing that same note over and over. I quickly stopped, slammed the key lid, and flung the sheet back over. 

That night, not much else was accomplished other than killing a bottle of Jim Beam and smoking a whole pack of cigarettes. 


I needed help. That much was clear. I went to see a therapist the next day. I arrived at his office in the late afternoon. I started speaking to him, unraveling the problems of the past week.  I don’t remember much from this interaction. I sat through his dull words and nodded my head at pauses. He prescribed me medication and sent me on my way. 

I went to sleep after taking my medication and had my final dream for a good long time. This one was different. I was standing in a plain of vibrant red dirt and rock, with a purple sky that looked like the violet hues of a sunset stretched throughout the whole atmosphere. Clusters of stars lit up the expanse. I marveled at the sight with a sense of wonder and comfort. 

In front of me, a single drop of blood formed in the air, mere feet from my face. The drop grew into an amorphous mass, large as a baseball. Like a clump of tree roots, veins started growing around the blood in a span of seconds, engulfing it into a much larger sphere. A perfectly round sheet of white spread out, covering the web of veins, and in the center formed an emerald iris and deep black pupil. The huge eyeball darted around the horizon before landing on me as the pupil dilated into the size of a dinner plate, with only a thin circle of iris outlining the abyssal black. I stared back at the eye, a sense of dread pitted into my stomach. I felt like I was experiencing death—like I knew I was doomed but there was comfort in knowing. It would all be over soon. 

Black tendrils sprouted from behind the giant eye, whipping this way and that. One emerged from the center of the mass of appendages, and more rooty veins dug through the air like an earthworm through dirt. A skeleton grew through the center of the veiny masses, forming a wrist and fingers. Muscle and tendon pulsed into existence, and finally, flesh. The hand reached out, offering a handshake. In the stupor only to be expected while dreaming, I offered my hand. The disembodied hand obliged and grabbed it. The grip was stone cold, but as I took it, the rest of my body grew hot. I heard a buzzing in my ears as my cheeks felt red. Then all went black. 

I woke up with a fever. It took a few days to get over some mildly flu-like symptoms, but eventually I was back to a somewhat healthy self. I kept taking my medication, and for the first time in a week, I can say I feel well rested again. 

…

It’s been a few weeks since things went back to normal. I still keep the grand piano covered—I don’t want to think about the night terrors and sleepwalking that plagued me. I’ll leave it behind as a strange occurrence that I won’t revisit. 

I feel a lot better. My work for the horror flick is coming to an end, and I started having a personal life again. I started going out more, and started seeing a girl who worked at the coffee place where I live. Her name is Anna and she is prettier than ever. She’ll listen to me talk for hours about music and I’ll listen to her talk for hours about how she was going to medical school and all sorts of stuff that went way over my head. I’m sure she might’ve felt the same when I was talking. 

In a life where everything blends together and it’s hard to remember one day from another, I’m glad I still remember conversations from our first date, even if it was a month ago. She was easy to talk to and we got along well. 

I went home that night feeling better than I had in a year. I led a lonely and secluded life but I felt like I had connected with her well. 


We were seeing each other fairly regularly for a week or two. The other night, we put a movie on at my apartment. We were about half way through when she tugged on my shirt and, when I turned, she gently grabbed my face and brought me in a for a kiss. A second before I closed my eyes and leaned in, I paused and my heart felt like it fell off a skyscraper. Anna sat there, frozen and staring at me. Her face did not look like hers. It looked like a poor mimicry. Every feature was off. Her eyes were too far apart, her skin looked like it was made of wax, her hair looked like it was matted down and glued to her scalp, and her expression blank and unknowing. There was nothing behind her eyes. I opened my mouth to scream, but no sound came out. In turn, Anna’s fake face opened its mouth, and instead of a voice, the untuned, and distorted piano note sounded loud and horrible. My ears started ringing unbearably as it came again and again.

“What’s wrong?”

Anna’s voice snapped me back to reality. A single tear had fallen down my cheek. I was breathing sharp and heavy. I tried to bring down my hyperventilation, but I was stuck in a panic attack. Anna looked at me, face restored to normal, with a terror that made me wish I could stop and act like everything was fine. I tried and failed as I stumbled back off the couch and into a self-soothing fetal position, unable to speak and trying to calm my breathing.

A comforting hand rested on my back as she knelt beside me, whispering reassurances to me. Eventually I pieced myself together.

“I’m sorry,” I stammered, as I slowly lifted myself to my feet.

“Do you need me to take you to the hospital?” Anna asked worriedly. “I think you just had a panic attack… does that happen often for you?”

“I don’t think I’ve gotten it like that,” I replied, embarrassed at the scene I had made. “I thought it was over… I’m really sorry. You can leave if you’d like.”

“It’s fine… I was just scared for you,” she said softly. “We can at least finish the movie, if you think you’re alright. I can still drive you to the hospital.”

I looked down at the ground, heart still pounding loudly in my ears. 

“I’ll be alright. Thank you for your concern.”

We finished the movie in silence, and she sweetly kissed me on the cheek as she left for the night. I was afraid I had scared her off.

Luckily my fears were unfounded. We’ve had a few more dates leading up to today. I haven’t had this happen again. Hopefully it stays that way.

…

It’s been a month since I last wrote. I hadn’t had any events up until yesterday. Anna had intermittently started staying over at my apartment on the weekends, and I was thinking my life was getting better again.

Last night, she was lying in my arms and we were both fast asleep. I woke up, but my body was still asleep. I couldn’t move a muscle save for my eyes. I was facing her and her back was turned to me. I have had sleep paralysis before, but not in a while. I was laying there for what seemed like minutes, trying to stay calm and force myself awake. It felt like an eternity had passed when Anna started to stir. I thought she would awaken and shake me from my paralysis. Then her whole face turned around. Not like a normal human. Her whole neck bent around, stretching and craning an uncanny amount, as the same face from a month ago that was not hers faced me. I could not scream, just stare in horror. The face elongated into a snout, animal teeth protruding from her mouth. There were fangs like a wolf on either side of large teeth like a horse and tusks like a boar lining the inexplicably large mouth. Her eyes were on either side of her head by now, and her face contorted into a beastly cry, but no sound was heard. I couldn’t hear a thing. I couldn’t move an inch. Only look on in horror. I tried to move any muscle I could. The decrepit face moved within an inch of mine, and I felt hot breath against my face and flecks of spittle hit my cheeks. I thought with all my might and got my pinky to twitch. The face got closer. Then my ring twitched. The mouth stretched wide. Then my middle. All I could see was black as it stretched over my head. Then my pointer.

DING

The piano note played, more awful and grating than ever before. I was no longer in my bed, but standing once again where my piano was, in front of the bench. I still could not move. My pointer finger moved with a mind of its own.

DING

Still standing in front of the piano, unable to move, I yearned to be able to cover my ears, to wince, to mitigate the horrible noise in any way I could. Instead I had to endure the full brunt. 

DING

Like a sheet of wrapping paper, reality tore open in front of me. I felt my whole body dropped as I fell into a pitch blackness, a landscape below me only illuminated by tiny orange lights. Quickly the light grew bigger and bigger, until I made it out to be a great roaring fire, stretching out into a vast hellscape. I found I could move my body again, which did not at all decrease the sense of hopelessness as I was plunging down to the ground, any movement ineffective in the dead air. Then, all at once, I stopped. My ankle was caught, and my body violently ripped toward the earth as my leg stayed put, and my spine felt like it had been ripped apart. I do not know how I stayed in one piece.

A grey tentacle had caught my leg. Other tentacles twirled and twisted around me as I hung, suspended at least fifteen feet in the air. Fire roared around me. 

From the depths, eight glowing yellow eyes opened, and a face of unfathomable proportions emerged. Its mouth was a black hole lined with uncountable teeth, and its head was a large round dome. Tentacles stretched around it, connected to its body from beneath. It sat in a pit of darkness surrounded by a landscape of flame.

“You do not know a thing, do you, child?” came a deep, all encompassing voice, biting and probing beneath my skull. 

“I know I must be insane,” I said aloud, my voice falling flat amidst the roaring fires and the palpable air between me and the beast.

“Perhaps, child. Perhaps all this is real. Does it matter? Either way, your torment shall not end.”

“Why does it have to be like this? Why are you doing this?”

“Me? Do this?” Laughter filled the fiery void like a booming symphony of dread. “I am merely just another player, child. Do not blame me for what is happening. I observe, I play, I move on. Greater forces than you or me are at play here.”

“What is at play?” I aimlessly muttered.

“I know no more than you, little one. Do not put the blame on me, I am merely an agent in my own world, as you are in yours. Perhaps you’re out of your mind, perhaps you’re just tragically gifted. Who’s to say?”

I went to answer, but I was awake in my bed. Anna was nowhere in sight. 

…

I tried to contact Anna, but her number was no longer saved on my phone. I tried to enter the number from memory, but it was not in use. 

The next day, I went to the coffee shop she worked at during her shift. I breathed a sigh of relief, seeing her behind the counter.

“Anna!” I cried, tears coming to my eyes. “Where did you go last…?”

Anna looked at me like I was a serial killer. She looked behind her, like I was talking to someone else.

“Are you talking to me?” she asked. “I’m not Anna…”

My face went blank with confusion. 

“You’re…my…girlfriend…” I muttered.

“I don’t know you,” she said, warily.

I dropped to the ground and started to weep. Needless to say, her manager appeared and I was escorted out of the shop. 

…

I’m not sure what is real anymore. 

I had decided to take my life. I had a .38 Special I kept in my drawer for home defense. Last night I put it to my head, and like a cruel joke…

Dairy/ soy / caffeine, etc. help me troubleshoot!!","So I gave up dairy sort of half heartedly for about a month to see if it helps with my baby’s reflux, fussiness,etc. He gains weight well, has no skin conditions and doesn’t have bloody stools. Sometimes he will have mucous-y poops but that’s about it. Hence my less than perfect elimination diet - he would seem fine and then less fine almost randomly so my husband and I chalked it up to just an under developed digestive tract. I still was “mostly” dairy free for a little over a month. 

Yesterday I ate an unusually large amt of dairy - pizza at lunch, sour cream in tacos at dinner and ice cream (I know, at this point I thought it really wasn’t the culprit). I BF him normally all afternoon and evening. Last night he slept through the night (8pm to 5am, with one non-feed fussing wake up at 12:30). Zero spit up. FIRST sleep through the night!! Fingers crossed. 

This morning I had a coffee around 6 which is earlier than usual and I was so happy and stunned about the night going so well. I fed him again around 7:30 and he spit up like projectile multiple times everywhere. Large amounts. Like 5x the normal amount. 

So the million dollar Q … if dairy is the culprit, shouldn’t he have been fussy yesterday? Or not necessarily? Did my caffeine impact him more because I normally drink it while BF, not before. I would love to know once and for all what is causing this fountain of spit up so I can commit fully. ",0,1750682302.0,breastfeeding,4,0.5,False

	•	Matched with her on a dating app — she was pretty, artistic, lived in Brooklyn, played guitar, had a sweet, low-key profile (“let’s be sweet to each other”).
	•	We hit it off via text quickly — lots of heart emojis, sweet messages, said she “couldn’t wait to meet me.”
	•	Planned a stoop date (her idea to move it earlier than planned) — she had her daughter with her, so we hung outside with popcorn and soda.
	•	She invited me in after her daughter went to bed. We talked, hit it off, made out, and had sex that same night. It all escalated quickly.
	•	Daily texting began right away — very enthusiastic, early morning messages, lots of “I’m thinking about you,” hearts, “when can I see you,” etc.
	•	Every time we met = sex — but no PDA or affection outside the bedroom. Affection felt controlled. She mostly received during sex.
	•	She cooked for me and scheduled everything — very organized. Strong rules in her house. Very “together” outwardly (hosting, sewing, parenting, etc.).
	•	Criticism started creeping in — my posture, how I feed my kid, eye contact, being quiet at Thanksgiving, etc.
	•	Made a light joke about one of her friends being attractive → she emotionally pulled away for 3 days. No emojis, cold texting. Eventually warmed back up.
	•	Told her I was nervous about my upcoming job and wanted a calm weekend → she got upset I hadn’t shared this sooner. Accused me of withholding.
	•	Got jealous when I had coffee with a female friend → came over to confront me and initiated a “ceremonial” deletion of our dating apps to make things exclusive.
	•	Said I made her feel seen, calm, and heard — then admitted she “almost didn’t know what to do with that.” Said she was used to drama.
	•	Paid for Broadway shows for us — seemed generous, but still controlled the emotional tone of the relationship.
	•	After sex one night, she cried and said she “couldn’t say what was on her mind.”
	•	In the days after, I felt a shift — texting tone changed. I asked her if something was off. She confirmed something was wrong and said we’d talk in person.
	•	She broke up with me saying, “I keep waiting for something to shift in my heart after we have sex, and it doesn’t.”
	•	One month later, during political tensions (Trump and trans issues), she texted to ask how I was doing (I have an LGBTQ daughter) and invited me for coffee.
	•	During coffee, she was friendly but distant — wouldn’t make eye contact much, just wanted an update.
	•	I told her I went to the opera recently — she asked who with. I said it was a date. She told me she hadn’t dated since the breakup. Seemed bothered but didn’t say anything directly.
	•	We got a bite to eat after coffee, and she gave me a quick hug and then bailed — never texted again.",1,1750681945.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Hey there,
I'm just a 23-year-old Punjabi guy with a lean build, curly hair, a beard, and brown eyes—people say I look Arab (not sure, you decide 🧿).

Engineering grad, applying for Masters in Germany 🇩🇪. Life's chaotic, but I still believe in soft love, slow hugs, and holding hands when words fall short.

🌿 So, who am I?
• Friendly neighborhood handyman 🛠️ – I fix stuff around the house and maybe your mood too (bonus: I'll never mess up IKEA instructions).
• Emotionally available homebody – I love talking. Deep convos, cute rants, or even just listening to you overthink your outfit while I make us tea/coffee ☕


• Loyal & communicative – No ghosting. I’ll text back mid-cooking if I care. (And I will care.)

🛍️ What I’m into:
• Working out & yoga – fit heart, fit soul because who doesn't love a hot body and hmm 👀

• Cooking – I love cooking and I'll send u pics of things I make , not sure if they will be good but u decide.

• Psychology, history, mythology – Let’s binge documentaries and fall asleep mid-theory

• Sarcasm + soft heart – I’ll tease you and also remind you how precious you are in the same breath

• DIY guy – If your lamp breaks, I’ll fix it. If your day breaks, I’ll fix that too

💌 What I'm hoping for:
• Someone clingy in the sweetest way, a little bossy and dominant because dominant womens are my weakness and I love a little possessiveness, obsession ,knows what she wants, and isn’t afraid to take charge when I zone out while admiring your eyes 👀

• A mix of silly and mature. You overthink things? Me too. Let’s overthink together.

• Someone who values communication, cuddles, and random compliments about your elbows just because they’re cute.

If even one tiny thing above matches your vibe… message me. (Please don't be shy and message me even if we don't get there and lovers we can be good friends and who knows we might develop things also because I'm writing this with hope 😭)

If you ever dreamed of someone texting you just to ask, “Why are clouds so dramatic?”—I’m your guy ☁️💬

If you love old-school love, believe that connection is about presence, effort, and choosing someone daily—I’m here for it too.

I’m not here to waste time or play games. I’m not here to be creepy or pushy. I’m here to find real connection and someone whose hands I can hold while we talk about your mascara, heels, or how the dress u wanted was sold out. 👑🫶🏽",1,1750681597.0,friendship,1,1.0,False

Kendu is a memecoin backed by a plethora of IRL initiatives including plushies, vapes, vending machines, coffee, energy drinks, murals, Pickleball Competitions and much more....We are currently sitting around 20 million market cap, with around 18.5k holders and we have stood incredibly strong as the rest of the market falls due to the current wars. But anyways, I am not too interested in the wars, I am far more focused on Kendu. Kendu is only the 2nd coin to ever reach 50k Certik votes for the free audit, the only other coin to achieve this incredible feat was Pepe, yes.....Pepe. The coin that reached 10 billion outside of a bull run, this is bullish af and it shows the true strength of Kendu. We have an incredible social media output, rivalling the most active coins, check X or any memecoin subreddit and you will see Kendu everywhere. 

**The next part of the post is for a bit of fun, there are far more factors than this. For example community sentiment, tg activity and many more**

So what makes the Kendu community so active?

The answer is **copious amounts of** ...... **caffeine**

Kendu has energy drinks and coffee, which keeps the Kendu army grinding on even the slowest of days, I myself don't drink coffee, but I drink Kendu Energy.

""How the fuck else would you do this job?""

""Kendu Energy and Kendu Coffee my friend""

**That was stolen from the Wolf of Wall Street, don't sue me lol**

But anyways, here is a run down of the different products:

**Kendu Coffee**

Kendu Coffee is sourced through direct trade, this means there is no middle man, to ensure only the best price for the product, the coffee is available in both caffeinated and decaf forms and it is sourced from Brazil. The coffee is available in many different forms: Filter, Espresso, Whole Bean and French Press. For any Cafes or offices you can bulk order the coffee, which is great. For any UK events, there is a portable Kendu Coffee bar, which brings the coffee to you! So any UK based people should be aware of this.

In the future providing that the plants produce beans to a high standard, Kendu Coffee plants will be available.

For More Information Please Visit: [https://kenducoffee.com/](https://kenducoffee.com/)

**Kendu Energy**

Kendu Energy is an energy drink, available in both sugar free and full sugar variants, with a recent redesign, it is looking great. I have tried the full sugar version and would highly recommend it, it tastes more similar to Redbull than Monster and I am buying more shortly! They come in packs of 6, 12 and 20 and they are available worldwide, with a very strong presence in Europe and America. I am also pretty sure there is a new flavour coming out soon, as it has been teased but I don't know what it will be!

**Final Thoughts**

Get yourself on the caffeine grind and join the Kendu army, we are outworking all other projects rn and we all know what happens to the most hardworking communities, they moon..... Shib, Doge and Pepe all had die hard communities, there was nothing special about them, they just worked incredibly hard. This is NFA but Kendu has absolutely 0 risk at these levels and a hell of a lot of potential upside

1lif8em,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lif8em/my_best_friend_isnt_my_best_friend_anymore_part/,My Best Friend Isn't My Best Friend Anymore [Part One],"My best friend Charlie has ceased to be my best friend. 

We’re both fifteen. And no, we didn’t fall out like teenagers do. There was no big argument over a girl. 

But Charlie is no longer my best friend. 

Let me give you a bit of background. I have known Charlie since we were both five. Charlie came from what can be stereotypically described as “the wrong side of the tracks”. His mother drank, his father was a ghost, and his uncle raised him. But he was a very decent lad, and he didn’t let the tragedy affect his life. 

When Charlie turned eleven, his uncle got a job in Germany and left Charlie alone, and I guess what you could call ‘orphaned’. 

Charlie was my best friend, and we spent every second together in and out of school. 

We played football, we chased girls (even though we were arguably too young to know about girls), and we played ‘knock down ginger’ on the neighbouring houses (ding dong ditch to you Americans). 

With the prospect of Charlie being moved away to an orphanage in London and miles away from me, I *begged* my parents to foster Charlie. I am an only child, and having Charlie in the house would be my dream. My parents did the right thing, and we took Charlie in. I guess at that point, Charlie stopped being my best friend and started being my brother. 

This summer, Charlie went to Germany for the whole summer holiday. I was so happy for him. He was trying to learn the language and experience his first trip out of England. He got to spend time with an uncle whom I know cared for and missed him. And he got to experience a bit of adventure. 

But when Charlie returned, he had changed - a **LOT.** 

*And I don’t think my best friend Charlie is my best friend anymore.* 

I decided to write a journal observing Charlie’s behaviour. Because writing this down is the only way for me to understand who or what Charlie is. 

The following has taken place over the last six days. 

So, let’s start from the beginning: 

**Day One** 

When Charlie returned, there was a big smile on his face as he walked down the aisles of Gatwick Airport. Everybody got a hug. It was a warm hug, the type of hug that only Charlie can give. 

“How have you been?” He asked us. 

That was when I noticed the slightest ever deviation of his accent. The old Charlie would go “how are ya”. But this “how have you been” - it was formal. And if I were to overanalyse it, I would say that he hit the consonants harder than a South-East Englander would. 

I asked him if he picked up any German out there. He laughed and said no. Then threw his bag at me to carry it. This was out of character for Charlie, too. 

It was subtle. 

But the Charlie I knew was meek and mild. He wouldn’t even make a cup of tea for himself, in the house he had lived in for many years, without asking my parents for permission first. To throw his hand luggage at me was a cockiness and arrogance that Charlie did not have. 

I just put it down to European rudeness. 

I could list an accumulation of all the poor manners that Charlie had in the airport, but you see where I am going. Something was **OFF.** 

We caught up in the living room, my parents were there too, and Charlie told us all about Hamburg, Berlin, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt (I mean, he got around Germany). 

“And how was your uncle?” I asked. 

“Fine. Just fine.” He said, then proceeded to explain the River Rhine in the smallest detail. 

“Did your uncle take you to all these places in Germany?” I asked. 

“No, he worked.” 

My parents looked at me dubiously. They wouldn’t have authorised a trip to Germany where Charlie would be wandering the cities alone, had they known. 

“Your uncle works a lot!” I said. 

“Too much, and no money to show for it.” 

Every time Charlie spoke, I just noticed that a little of his accent was off-key. 

“Why do you now sound German?” I asked. 

“I don’t.” 

“Your accent is weird.” 

He looked at me, raised an eyebrow and said: 

“That’s not a German accent.” 

**Day Two** 

Three am that night. 

Pitch black. 

I hear ruffling in Charlie’s bedroom. I got up to see if he was ok and opened his door. 

He has got one leg in and one leg out of the window. 

“What are you doing?” I yell. 

“Shhhhh.” He screeches back. 

“Are you fleeing?” I asked. 

“No, look, I’ll level with you. I am seeing Toni,” he said. 

“Toni Maynard?” I asked. 

Toni was the angel of the town. Everybody fancied her. Especially Charlie. No way would she have been interested back at him back then. I could not believe it, and I felt a strong emotional reaction.

Severe jealousy. 

“No way,” I said. 

“I swear.” 

“No.” 

“I promise you. But cover for me. I am going to see her now. She just WhatsApp’d me.” 

“Charlie…” 

“Please, Raymond.” 

This was my best friend and brother sneaking off to score with the hottest chick in town. How could I say no? 

“Just go…” I said. 

I went to bed raging. Toni? Charlie? Life isn’t fair. 

I mean, credit where credit was due when I walked to school that morning, Charlie was a few feet ahead of me, holding hands with Toni. 

It was that afternoon in school that I caught up again with Charlie. 

I looked closely at his skin. It was peeling off, like severe acne that wasn’t there before. His skin was pale, and his cheekbones were sticking out prominently. He looked like the malnourished little boy that my parents took in all those years ago. 

“You look tired, Charlie. You don’t look well,” I said. 

“I’m all good. Just jet lag.” 

“Jet lag?” 

“Yeah.” 

“It is a one-hour flight.” 

“Two, I think.” 

“So, jet lag then?” 

Walking home, we got the usual hazing from Rory Keene. Rory was throwing trash that he was picking out of the dustbin and aiming at both of us as we crossed his path. I felt an apple core, a tin can and a banana peel bounce off my shoulders. 

The key to dealing with Rory is - head down and don’t acknowledge. 

He was as hard as nails, an amateur boxer, and the terror of Ridgeway Comprehensive School. 

“I wish someone would do something about him,” I said. I was red with anger. Rory had been the bane of our lives since year 7. 

“Well, I'll go and speak to him.” 

Charlie turned to walk towards Rory, and I grabbed his arm. 

“Are you mad?” 

Charlie could be many things, but a fighter was *not* one of them. 

**Day Three** 

That morning, my parents were both at work. I got up at about five am needing a piss. 

When I got down to the toilet downstairs by the kitchen, I saw Charlie’s head in the fridge. He was stuffing raw chicken fillets into his throat. 

Now, this would have been the perfect time to call him out - scream at him WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? But I didn’t, do you want to know why? 

Charlie was an orphan from a family of poverty, and I didn’t want to embarrass him. God knows how he survived his awful childhood before my parents fostered him. I turned away and pretended that I didn’t see it. 

When I went down to have my breakfast and coffee, I saw that he had poured milk all over the floor and gnawed on a wedge of butter. I was livid, but again, I kind of decided not to embarrass him, and I cleaned it up myself. 

Another thing was, and I first noticed it when he was seated next to me in science, he had these weird hairs - they were like hard bristly hairs growing out of his neck and back. 

We’re both adolescents and you can chalk it up to that, but these were disgusting little pockets of hair. He needed to have a go with the tweezers. 

Toni approached us at our desks and spoke to Charlie. They both had this weird robotic tone when they spoke to one another, like they were being watched and had to play at being normal. It’s hard to explain, but it was a *forced* formality.

“Hello, Charlie,” Toni said.

“Hello Toni,” Charlie said. 

“Are we still meeting for lunch at one fifteen?”

“Yes.” 

“Ok, thank you and goodbye,” Toni said.

“Jesus Christ, a lot of passion between you two, I see,” I said.

Charlie shot me a look of rage. One thing about boys, showing your mate up in front of girls was tantamount to teenage treason. 

“Sorry,” I said.

Toni awkwardly shuffled away. 

We walked down the hall to our next lesson. And was suddenly stopped by Rory. 

*Shit*. 

“Excuse me,” Charlie said amiably. 

“There’s a ten-pound tax to walk through this hallway,” Rory said.

“Can we owe you, Rory? We don’t have any money.” I said.

“Afraid not,” Rory said.

“I need to get to my next lesson, if you wouldn’t mind,” Charlie said dryly. 

“Nope,” Rory said.

He put his hand on Charlie’s chest to halt Charlie. 

I closed my eyes. Poor Charlie was going to get a right hook. We’ve all eaten one from Rory over the years. 

I heard a crunch four times. 

*Broken jaw. Poor Charlie.* 

I looked up. 

Rory’s arm had been yanked from its socket and was flopping about the hallway. 

Charlie nearly tore it off.

Rory screamed from the bottom of his stomach.

Mr McCarthy the head came straight out of his office and ran down the corridor with a face of sheer rage. He grabbed me and Charlie by the collar and threw us down the hall and into his office while the school nurse sprinted towards Rory.

*Karma, if you ask me.* 

I was sitting in the lobby of the head’s office. 

I could see through the glass a silhouette of Charlie and Mr McCarthy talking. It wasn’t anywhere nearly as volatile as I thought that it would be.

Twenty minutes later, Mr McCarthy opened his door and ushered Charlie through it.

“You and Charlie can go.” Mr McCarthy said, closing his door on us.

“What the hell did you say to him?” I asked.

“I appealed to his sense of justice,” Charlie said. 

Rory was rushed to A and E straight after, and the consensus amongst the playground was that he would never be able to throw a proper punch ever again. 

Charlie had never stood up to a bully before, but now this new Charlie was breaking arms with one little pull. 

And who even was Charlie? 

Mr McCarthy never called my parents. They never found out about the incident. That was it. It was officially written off. Mr McCarthy - the hard arse of school had seemingly forgotten when one student broke another student's arm. 

That evening, gathered around the television, we watched The Simpsons. Now this may seem like a weird and pathetic observation to you readers but Charlie always laughed at The Simpsons. And I mean LAUGHED, from the living room to the bedroom his laugh would echo out.

But as he sat in front of the tv, in between my parents, he was stoic and still. Just watching and observing the television. His eyes were wide and bright and he didn’t move a single facial muscle. 

Then he turned to me and said:

“Raymond, if you don’t mind, I’d like to speak with your parents alone.” 

I nodded and walked upstairs and into my room. I tried to eavesdrop with the door open but all I could hear was a muffled utterance between adult voices and child voices. 

I went to bed. And my final thoughts of that day were pretty concrete - *my best friend isn’t my best friend, not anymore.*

Me-time is great and all, but to commit my time for someone else gives that sense of fulfillment I'm looking for in life. To be vulnerable with someone is a feeling worth searching for.

Hey there,
I'm just a 23-year-old Punjabi guy with a lean build, curly hair, a beard, and brown eyes—people say I look Arab (not sure, you decide 🧿).

Engineering grad, applying for Masters in Germany 🇩🇪. Life's chaotic, but I still believe in soft love, slow hugs, and holding hands when words fall short.

🌿 So, who am I?
• Friendly neighborhood handyman 🛠️ – I fix stuff around the house and maybe your mood too (bonus: I'll never mess up IKEA instructions).
• Emotionally available homebody – I love talking. Deep convos, cute rants, or even just listening to you overthink your outfit while I make us tea/coffee ☕


• Loyal & communicative – No ghosting. I’ll text back mid-cooking if I care. (And I will care.)

🛍️ What I’m into:
• Working out & yoga – fit heart, fit soul because who doesn't love a hot body and hmm 👀

• Cooking – I love cooking and I'll send u pics of things I make , not sure if they will be good but u decide.

• Psychology, history, mythology – Let’s binge documentaries and fall asleep mid-theory

• Sarcasm + soft heart – I’ll tease you and also remind you how precious you are in the same breath

• DIY guy – If your lamp breaks, I’ll fix it. If your day breaks, I’ll fix that too

💌 What I'm hoping for:
• Someone clingy in the sweetest way, a little bossy and dominant because dominant womens are my weakness and I love a little possessiveness, obsession ,knows what she wants, and isn’t afraid to take charge when I zone out while admiring your eyes 👀

• A mix of silly and mature. You overthink things? Me too. Let’s overthink together.

• Someone who values communication, cuddles, and random compliments about your elbows just because they’re cute.

If even one tiny thing above matches your vibe… message me. (Please don't be shy and message me even if we don't get there and lovers we can be good friends and who knows we might develop things also because I'm writing this with hope 😭)

If you ever dreamed of someone texting you just to ask, “Why are clouds so dramatic?”—I’m your guy ☁️💬

If you love old-school love, believe that connection is about presence, effort, and choosing someone daily—I’m here for it too.

I’m not here to waste time or play games. I’m not here to be creepy or pushy. I’m here to find real connection and someone whose hands I can hold while we talk about your mascara, heels, or how the dress u wanted was sold out. 👑🫶🏽",1,1750681424.0,MeetPeople,0,1.0,False

However, Saiki does not open them for 2 reasons:

1- The future will not be fulfilled if Saiki does not open the cookie.

2- Practically they are all bad futures.

Therefore, Saiki already has more than 1230 jars in a pocket dimension.

1lif12f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lif12f,Old Rag Mountain Loop,"I've been wanting to do Old Rag for the longest, but every time I had the opportunity to do it I would put it off because I was so anxious and worried about it. I am NOT an athletic person. I hate working out in general lol, but I enjoy hiking. Here are some answers to questions I had and comments or whatever that I can confirm after doing it and some things Ive learned after doing the hike:

1. Yes it's hard! But it is doable. We started at 12pm 🥲, sun beaming, crazy amount of gnats, extremely hot and humid. I don't remember exactly, but the temp was high 80s- low 90s. Had 3L of water + an extra bottle of water and that was plenty enough for me. Took us 6hrs to complete. Perhaps don't be like us and maybe start wayyy earlier than noon 😬

2. I'm 5'3"", upper body strength is a joke to be honest as in I can't even do a single pushup or any kind of pull-up lol. I was worried I wouldn't be able to pull myself up, but I found it's more leg work (personally) and as a short person you kind of have to get creative on how you're going to push yourself up. I had someone with me and I didn't have to ask for help. What gave me the most worry while rock scrambling were sweaty hands and sweaty legs. 

3. I wish I had ate better before starting (I was an idiot don't be like me). I had half a banana, coffee with a shot of espresso (if you don't normally drink espresso don't even try it before a hard hike because I felt nauseous and bloated after) and half a wrap from a gas station that tasted like sand. 

4. We went clock-wise. The rock scrambling started at I think 3 miles. That was the longest 3 miles of my life haha, but it was fun and worth it. At 4 or around 4 miles you're finally at the summit then it is all a downhill hike for I think 5 miles. ",54,1750680899.0,Outdoors,1,1.0,False

1lif0nm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1lif0nm/can_i_trial_different_medication_after_2_years/,"Can I trial different medication after 2 years, while on shared care?","Ive been diagnosed privately 2 years ago through Adhd360.

At the time, there was a massive shortage of meds, especially Elvanse/ Vyvanse.. 

I trialed Concerta XL, went up to 72mg per day divided in 2 doses, and it worked well. Due to shortages, I was prescribed generic methylphenidate 60mg total/ 3 times a day.. 

I have been on the dose (60mg per day) for over a year now. I have just got a green light from my GP clinic 3 months ago, and now get to order the meds through them ( £10 per month rather than £60)

I need to renew my private subscription with ADHD360 next month, yet I have not had a single review all year.. 

Truth be told, I wanted to ask for a higher dose (80mg) because my medication does not last whole day, and I drink 3/4 coffees a day to stay engaged at work as well. 

On top of this, I have gained about 15kg over last year (obese now) , and I continue to struggle with impulsive over-eating, even when on medication. 

The meds do work, as i do feel more focused/ engaged etc, but don't work well enough, hence why I want a higher dose.. 

On really challenging days, where I really need to get a lot done, I have taken 80mg, sometimes taking 20mg, and another 20mg 1-2 hours later, and sure it helped, but often times on days off, I take my standard dose of 20 mg in the morning, and fall asleep 30 mins later....

I never tried anything else except methylphenidate. It does help me in my day to day, but I wonder if a different stimulant would work more effectively? 

I know weight loss is not a huge concern when it comes to effectivness of medication, but its a constant struggle, and I wish my appetite/ impulsive over-eating was suppressed, to help me along. 

My concern is also cost, as Vyvanse is around £200 per month, so my question is also, that if I was to switch to a different drug, can it be sent straight to shared care, so I pay the reduced cost from NHS, or would I have to pay privately for the duration of finding out the right dosage again?

Ive been pondering about this for a long time, amd would appreciate any and all advice.
