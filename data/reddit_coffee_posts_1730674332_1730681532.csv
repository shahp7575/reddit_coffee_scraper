Every morning, as the aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled my kitchen, the thought of tackling another long day tugged at me. I‚Äôd tried countless supplements that promised energy boosts and weight management, only to be let down by ineffective or overly stimulating results. Then, I stumbled upon something that seemed intriguing yet simple: a tasteless powder designed to seamlessly blend into my morning ritual. This was the game changer I didn‚Äôt know I needed.

Adding this product was as simple as tearing open a packet and stirring it into my coffee. No adjustments to the flavor, no overpowering bitterness ‚Äî just the same comforting cup I knew, with an invisible yet powerful boost. Within days, subtle changes emerged. Mornings felt lighter; that sluggish feeling was replaced by a steady stream of alertness and vitality. My metabolism seemed to catch up with my lifestyle, a noticeable shift from previous attempts where results were sluggish, at best.

The secret, I learned, was in the synergistic blend of ingredients crafted to amplify metabolic function naturally. Green tea extract, known for its antioxidants and metabolism-enhancing catechins, played a lead role. L-carnitine and chromium worked behind the scenes to regulate energy and keep blood sugar levels in check. It wasn‚Äôt just about burning calories; it was about maintaining a balance that kept my body in sync with my goals.

By the end of the first month, the results spoke louder than any claim could. Clothes fit better, workouts felt more rewarding, and a mental clarity I hadn‚Äôt experienced in years settled in. Cravings that once derailed my progress were subdued. This wasn‚Äôt some magic pill that replaced hard work ‚Äî it complemented my existing habits, making them more effective.

What stood out was the product‚Äôs commitment to quality: free from fillers, artificial additives, and harmful chemicals. Knowing it was manufactured in a facility that met high safety standards reassured me I was on the right path. The journey wasn‚Äôt without its skeptics. ‚ÄúIs it really helping, or is this a placebo?‚Äù someone asked me. The difference, though, was tangible enough that no explanation was needed. The morning routine that once felt like a kickstart became an all-day source of sustained energy.

My experience isn‚Äôt unique; it echoes the stories of many who‚Äôve made similar changes. The lesson? Simple additions can catalyze major transformations. When I reflect on this journey, it‚Äôs clear that sometimes, the most subtle interventions hold the most profound impact.

Reflecting on my journey with this transformative addition to my mornings, it's important to paint an honest picture by diving into its pros and cons. After all, real success stories aren‚Äôt just about what went right; they‚Äôre about understanding the full experience.

**Pros:**

1. **Seamless Integration into Daily Routine**: One of the biggest advantages was how effortlessly it fit into my life. Unlike many weight management supplements that require significant lifestyle shifts, this product only needed to be mixed with my morning coffee. There were no extra steps, no new flavors to get used to ‚Äî just simplicity.
2. **Natural Ingredients**: The formula boasts a strong profile of scientifically backed components. Green tea extract, chlorogenic acid from green coffee beans, and L-carnitine are known for boosting metabolism and energy levels in a natural way. This gave me peace of mind, knowing I wasn't relying on synthetic chemicals.
3. **Enhanced Energy and Mental Clarity**: The impact on my daily energy was undeniable. Instead of the jittery highs and lows typical of caffeine overloads, I experienced consistent energy. This steadiness extended to mental sharpness, which helped me stay productive and focused throughout the day.
4. **No Artificial Additives**: The supplement prides itself on being non-GMO, vegetarian, and free from artificial fillers and colors. This aligned well with my preference for clean, health-focused products.
5. **Appetite Control**: Over time, I noticed a reduction in cravings. The product seemed to curb my usual mid-morning snack urges, making it easier to stick to balanced meals and avoid unnecessary snacking.

**Cons:**

1. **Price Point**: While the results spoke for themselves, the cost could be seen as a hurdle. High-quality supplements often come with a premium, and this one is no exception. Budget-conscious users might find it challenging to sustain long-term use without considering the expense.
2. **Consistency Required for Results**: Unlike quick fixes, this product requires consistent use for full benefits. Some people might find it difficult to maintain daily usage, especially if they're not habitual coffee drinkers.
3. **Not a Standalone Solution**: It‚Äôs important to highlight that while it boosts metabolism and energy, it isn‚Äôt a miracle solution. Results were best when paired with mindful eating and regular physical activity. It supports healthy habits rather than replaces them.
4. **Potential Sensitivity to Ingredients**: Although it contains natural substances, those sensitive to caffeine or other stimulants should proceed with caution. While it didn‚Äôt cause jitters for me, people with low tolerance could experience different effects.
5. **Availability Restrictions**: Depending on location, there might be limited access or higher shipping costs. While the supplement is widely available online, certain regions may face longer delivery times or higher fees.

Reflecting on both sides, the pros outweighed the cons for me personally, especially considering how it transformed my mornings into productive, energetic starts. The journey wasn't about finding a magic pill, but rather a supportive boost that worked harmoniously with my existing lifestyle.

1gj25es,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1gj25es/nakukuha_na_naman_niya_ako/,Nakukuha na naman niya ako,"Di ko na alam how many times I‚Äôve posted about this friend/roommate of mine who I am trying to win over and be my boy toy (choz).But seryoso, I want to take care of him talaga and spend the rest of life with him na because he is just so warm and he makes me a better person despite my kagagahan noon (and slight ngayon haha).

The problem is, he is always resisting to the point na my subtle moves are always rejected. I thought it‚Äôs because we were friends for a long time so grabe yung risk just in case it won‚Äôt work well until the end and we were both vocal noon na ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt kiss friends‚Äù but wala eh, ang ante ninyo, nahulog. Pero last month nga, I accidentally learned na he‚Äôs holding back because he is kinda anxious if he would even level to my previous ‚Äúflings‚Äù bec wala pa siyang experience in that department. I‚Äôve been too transparent since we are really close, like I can say we‚Äôre the closest pair in our circle, figuratively and literally haha. Lahat ng kalokohan ko, alam niya, even the names lol. Dalawa lang naman but he knows gano ko iniyakan yung dalawang yun bec as someone na hopeless romantic and lumaki sa pocketbooks and wattpad, I thought ‚Äúsiya na ang THE one‚Äù.

He worded it to his workmates like ,‚Äùmeron akong friend na may friend who is always teasing him and hinting na she likes him but ung friend ko is aware sa past ng girl and nagdadoubt sya if he can look past that because medyo naiinsecure sya na baka di nya mapantayan ung previous guys.‚Äù It just accidentally popped up on his laptop‚Äôs screen and one workmate replied na ‚Äúfor the streets‚Äù daw ung girl and dont push it na or dont give in. May isa rin na nagsabing take care of his mental health and di raw worth it ang babaeng ganun.

Ofcourse, I got hurt. I didnt expect na ganun kalaking factor pala for him ang past ng isang tao. Especially someone he can consider as a friend. From then on, I lie lowed sa pang aasar sa kaniya. Kahit magkasama kami sa iisang room, medyo binawasan ko na ang pakikipag-interact and kunwari na lang busy ako sa work and naka-earphones ako. Maaga na rin akong nagdidinner. I dont like to confront him because, ewan, I‚Äôm scared na may lumabas sa bibig ko which will really hurt our friendship. After two weeks, medyo kinaya ko nang hindi siya involved sa daily routine ko. Ganun rin naman ang mangyayari sa future. Eventually, we will move out from this small space and part ways kaya ngayon pa lang, dapat masanay na akong wala siya.

Alexa, play ‚ÄúHere You Come Again‚Äù by Dolly Parton

So Friday, he chatted me nga if gusto ko bang magpasabay sa byahe pabalik ng Manila. I thought, okay, kesa mastress ako sa pagpila. He booked for both of us and the convo ended there. Kahapon, nagkita kami sa bus station and nagulat ako when he pulled out his panyo and wiped my sweat sa mukha ko. Take note, this is a guy who is very maarte sa gamit and ayaw na natatouch ng pawising braso hahahah. Sabi niya hulas na raw make up ko. Inirapan ko lang sya but nagtabi kami sa bleachers while waiting for the bus. Nung nasa bus na, he adjusted the aircon and asked me kung okay na ba and if hindi ba malamig. I pulled out my jacket and wore it.

While nasa byahe, napapaidlip idlip ako. There was a moment na papikit na ako but I remembered di ko pala nachat nanay ko na nasa bus na ako. Pagdilat ako, he was really staring at my face. I shrugged it off. Maya-maya, di ata siya nakatiis and told me na lagpas lipstick ko. Si other self, may naisip na kagagahan. I asked him to wipe it and pouted at him. Tapos si koya, talagang pinunasan nya with his finger. Ayon, parang may nafeel lang akong sparks pero di ko na lang inentertain. Nagthank you lang ako and tumawa. Idk pero napatingin ako sa kamay niya and eventually, to his lap. Pagkatingin ko, he has this boner hahahahha. Maya-maya, pasimple niyang hinarang yung sling bag nya. Inayos ko na lang ulit ung upo ko because antok na antok na talaga ako. I can feel his arms pressing against mine but natatamaan rin yung bandang dibdib ko and I wanted to see at what extent nya mapapansin na dibdib ko na pala nababangga ng braso nya ang kaso, nakatulog ako.

I woke up with my head on his shoulders. When I looked up, he‚Äôs staring outside the window. Nakapasak yung airpods niya sa tainga, at wala siyang kamalay-malay na may isang pusong natutunaw para sa kaniya. The view outside and the sun reflecting on his face is so cinematic that I could just admit, I still like this guy. Napansin nyang gising na ako and lumingon lang sya nung uminom ako. I kept on playing with my phone and medyo humarap ako sa direksyon nya. My knees kinda hit the chair in front of me (az a 5‚Äô3‚Äù gurlie na naka-wedge) and he might have noticed it kasi maya-maya, he carried my leg on top of his. Mas comfortable naman so nagstay lang ako sa ganun.  Inalis ko lang nung napansin kong namumula na yung hita nya hahaha.

Nung nakababa na, he carried my travelling bag hanggang makarating sa apartment. May dala siyang ulam and insisted na sumabay akong magdinner. Nung aabutin ko na yung plato ko mula sa hanging cabinet, he stood up and reached it himself. He also asked if gusto ko bang manood ng movie while eating. Si other self, nakasense ng sexual tension but I dont want to make a move na talaga eversince I saw his convo with his workmates. Nung nagi-skincare na ako, I could see him looking at me. Nung nakahiga na ako sa bed ko and naka-lights off na, he‚Äôs on his phone but lumabas siya and nakatulugan ko na. 

I woke up nang madaling araw because of my alarm (set it last long holiday bec my mom has to take meds) and he‚Äôs facing towards my direction. Tulog na tulog siya. Nung nasa family house ko ako, I could barey sleep. Pero pag kasama ko siya, parang lagi akong inaantok. Looking at him made me think about the future na naman na di ko siya kasama. Napaisip ako, kaya ko ba? Is it for the better? Tama nga naman. He has a choice rin naman sa makakarelasyon niya. Plus, di naman sure if we will last kahit ipilit ko pa ngayon. Maybe he‚Äôs better off with someone who is pure and loving and walang emotional baggage.

Pagkagising ko, nakapasok na sya but he brewed a coffee for me. I don‚Äôt drink black coffee but when I saw him too excited to try his newly bought coffee machine and coffee beans, I just let him do it. He also chatted na may magandang museum malapit sa amin. We‚Äôre not saying na ‚Äútara!‚Äù. Ganun lang gagawin namin, send a clip or post about something na galaan and we just know na it‚Äôs an invitation to go with each other.

In a snap, it‚Äôs like we‚Äôre back to being tight friends again. Nabalewala yung pagiging non chalant ko ng ilang weeks haha. Ayan na naman si siya na ang daming ginagawa for me pero for him, baka ginagawa niya lang yung because we‚Äôre friends. And as much as I want to avoid being delulu, pakiramdam ko nakukuha na naman niya ako, and I fucking hate it. ",1,1730681390.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

1gj25ad,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gj25ad/how_do_i_29m_get_past_my_girlfriend_26f_having_so/,How do I (29M) get past my girlfriend (26F) having so many close guy friends?,"Me (29M) and my girlfriend (26F) began dating six months ago. She is an extremely social person, which is a quality I really love about her, because I know that no matter who I bring her around or where, she makes it a good time. She also has an amazing friend group that I've been welcomed into, and I really appreciate that she has built such good friendships around the world.

  
However, one thing that has been a recent insecurity of mine and has surfaced into arguments occasionally, is the large amount of guy friends she has. I know that a lot of this has to do with my own insecurities, but I'm having such a hard time just getting over it. She has about 8 really close guy friends, and probably about 12-20 acquaintance guy friends around the world that she still regularly keeps in touch with. I'd say about 90% of them seem extremely kind hearted, genuine, and even on occasion we will just talk and catch up 1:1.

I don't think it's that she has guy friends that she catches up with that bother me, it's that she will regularly go do 1:1 things with her local guy friends and has tossed out the idea of going and visiting her friends internationally, most of which are men. For example, she has one guy friend who she will occasionally go to the gym with and catch up with, she has another guy friend she runs with occasionally, another she will go get coffee with and catch up with. Sometimes she has a friends movie night and it will be a mix of her girl and guy friends, but my problem is that I know some of these guys have liked her at one time or another. Also, she talks about going on international trips with her sister, and how she loves staying in hostels because then she get's to meet and explore with all sorts of cool people she meets in the hostels. Which, for her, typically means a group of guys and girls she will meet at hostel's and then they will all go explore the area, do activities, and go to bars/clubs and dance and stuff.

She is very transparent about her messages between her guy friends, is not like weirdly secretive or concealing about anything, and is very good with some boundaries like not talking about sexual stuff or about issues in our relationship, etc., which I appreciate tremendously.

I think the problem I'm having is that in all of my previous longterm relationships, and out of all the women in my life that I've known thus far, they will have guy friends, but it's not as personal as this. It's more like, a friend from high school that comes around for group events, or our mutual guy friends that hung out with us together, whereas this is more her building independent relationships with these men. Given, she's never weird about bringing me around them, and vice versa, and often, I have really good friendships with these guys as well and they definitely do add a fun aspect to life.

I'm truly not worried about her sleeping with anyone else, or even so much as kissing someone else. But, I think for me, it's like, why make it such a point to create these friendships? Like, we can travel the world together, we have an enormous friend group globally, and we are in a good spot. Why do we need to continue pulling more strange men into her life? To me, it just leaves the door open for things to cross a line and for things like emotional cheating to occur. To me, and I know this is a generalization, 99.9% of men are opportunists and my girlfriend is stunning with an amazing personality, they'd be crazy NOT to initially see this girl and be like, ""I could see myself with her"", whether that is dating, or hooking up, or whatever. And though, I know this isn't her intention, it sometimes just feels like I have all these men just looming and waiting for the opportunity when things are bad or I disappear to try to take it a step further. Her reasoning is that, those things are two-ways, and if she isn't looking for, or interested in anything like that with them, then why does it matter? Also, how can we know what each and every guy's intentions are when she meets them, and why is she responsible for deciphering that? But that's why I say, why bother to curate these 1:1 relationships with them and even pursue it in the first place? Like, in no way shape or form do I seek out women to have close emotional friendships with, because... why? She regularly says things like, ""I would love for you to have a woman that was interested in X hobbie that I may not be interested in to do with you."" and to me, that is just something I wouldn't do, because... why?

I'm struggling because I've never had to face this before. In all my last relationships, this wasn't even a thing. They had a majority of girlfriends with the occasional guy friend, as mentioned above. Additionally, with some of these guys, like her college friends from when she was single, some of them have done like streaking as a cross country team multiple times, or have gone skinny dipping in large groups together, etc. and it just feels so awkward when I'm hanging out with a group of her friends knowing like 3 of the guys there have seen my girlfriend completely naked on multiple occasions. Given, once again, most of these guys are in relationships of their own, but it's still weird. One of them she had a crush on years ago and they shared a kiss, nothing more, and they're both in relationships now, but still, it's just really uncomfortable.

I also want to add that she has never been withholding about like holding my hand, or kissing me, or posting pictures of us together, and making it known that we are together. She talks about me all the time, she loves me a ton and I love her a ton. I truly don't have any worries about her doing anything sketchy, it's mostly just them and what their intentions are. Especially random dudes at hostels we don't know anything about and are just trusting that she won't make a mistake that puts her in danger.

We have set some very clear boundaries that we both agreed to, like:  
  
\- Keeping it strictly platonic and not discussing things that could leave doors open for emotional cheating, like relationship issues, insecurities, talking about like sexual things or her body, etc.

\- Being transparent and keeping me updated so I'm not just caught off guard about what's going on.

\- Setting clear boundaries if someone does try to cross a line, like ending one of those friendships if that person doesn't respect the boundaries above or is shady/weird.

\- Unless it's a really really close friend that has history there, not doing 1:1 things with guys that feel like dates.

\- etc.

But despite everything above, there is still just this fear looming in the back of my head and this insecurity I can't seem to get rid of, and it's eating me alive and going to cause resentment that shouldn't be in our relationship.

She has also made it clear that to her, gender doesn't define friendships, and that just suddenly not being friends with men is not something she is willing to give up for any relationship, which, I do respect, and I definitely don't want her to give up something she deeply values, especially when she is good with boundaries and the things listed above.

Any advice is appreciated. 

  
**TL;DR:** OP (29M) loves his girlfriend (26F) for her social nature and strong global friendships, but struggles with insecurity over the many close male friends she has and her independent 1:1 interactions with them. Despite trust in her faithfulness and her adherence to clear boundaries they‚Äôve set, OP finds it difficult to shake the fear of potential emotional cheating and feels uncomfortable with certain aspects of her past and friendships. He respects her view that gender shouldn‚Äôt limit friendships, but is unsure how to handle his own insecurities without creating resentment in the relationship.

I‚Äôm now gearing up for a production with this studio and have splurged a little more to be able to do more classes, also the role I have been given is higher intensity than I have been working at the past couple years.

So here‚Äôs the actual issue - I work 9-5 and on nights I dance I have up to an hour once I get home to get changed, eat and do my hair etc. I'm working this term on bringing my stamina (both muscle and aerobic) back up in preparation for the production and have noticed my energy levels aren't sufficient which is probably because I don't eat enough (or correctly) in preparation for classes. I‚Äôll even occasionally experience exercise induced nausea and would love to avoid that, I expect more electrolytes and better stamina should help?

I've never had a great relationship with food and now that I have moved out from living with my parents, I have started eating worse because I don't have the capacity to really cook or meal prep during the week. My current schedule is:

Mid-morning - coffee and maybe a snack of cookies or nuts (if I feel like splurging)

Lunch - either leftovers/weekend big batch meal prep (I try to make these balanced) or packet noodles like mi goreng/2 minute noodles etc (and extras/sides if I have energy to prep/remember ‚Äì kimchi is my current obsession but occasionally I‚Äôll bring random vegetables or some leftover meat)

Afternoon (if I get snacky) - cookies/nuts/chocolate etc.

Once at home I eat a wide variety including oven fries/fish, toast and peanut butter, cereal or just a can of energy drink and run if I‚Äôm running late. Sometimes if I cbf, I‚Äôll get fast food on the way.

¬†What I‚Äôm looking for are either some recipe ideas that are good for pre-class and easy to put together/quick to eat or advice on how to manage my food throughout the day (on a budget) for better energy in the evening.

Specks of rain covered the area as it continued to pour for days with no end. Waking up in their run-down house made of tarpaulins and scraps of wood and metal, Biboy grabbed a mug and opened one of the instant coffee packets he bought from the sari-sari store in front of their house.

Many children were still playing outside, even in the rain. Some swam in the puddles that had formed in small crevices around their area, while others played basketball on their makeshift court with only one hoop. The rain didn‚Äôt mean anything to this community‚Äîit was just a normal day.

As an Eraserheads song played on the radio, Biboy took a slow sip from his mug and looked outside. His neighbor, Arlene, was waving and smiling at him as she sipped her own coffee.

The rain gradually grew stronger, but they were used to it; they knew it would pass. Without a worry in the world, Biboy continued sipping his coffee.

Suddenly, a loud crash shattered the peaceful scene. The children playing, the boys shooting hoops, Biboy, and his neighbors‚Äîall turned to look at the mountain of trash near their homes. It was collapsing!

Everything happened in an instant. Some tried to run, only to be engulfed by the literal mountain of garbage, while others simply accepted their fate and prayed. Screams drowned out the sound of the rubble, and then‚Äîsilence.

I have been a digital artists for year that, the past year, decided to learn pixel art and to learn how to make a game. I have done tons of hours of research through out best genres to start with, best practices, marketing tips, fundraiser ideas and so on.

I went with a cozy cafe sim idea as I'm a fan of cute cozy games such as animal crossing, stardew valley, a short hike and similar so as a cozy community member, I thought something that I'm most familiar with would be the best to start.

I started posting very rough ideas of the game around a year ago since I learned that starting to market the game would be the best as early as possible and any visual image/draft/sketch can be turned into marketing material. I created the most popular social medias, memorable name (Coffee Beans Dev) and started interacting with a bunch of people around.

A bit after, I made a Steam page for the game which gained 1.000 wishlists within a day, over 10k within a month and is currently sitting at 28.000+ wishlists. Again, I wanted to start collecting wishlists ASAP so my initial page was a complete draft, with little images, text and no trailer. The current Steam page still needs some improvements but is currently [in this state.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2922570/Tailside/)

The game is called **Tailside: Cozy Cafe Sim** and has just recently launched a fundraiser page (I was so busy I forgot to post the launch post of it here, so hopefully it's fine if I still do it now!)

The community that has been built around Tailside made sure of a great head start with the fundraiser, quickly reaching a few stretch goals and other achiemevents. I would love for anyone who might be interested to check it out as well or if you want to just check it for reference on how I set it up myself:

I haven't been able lately to compile and share too much of numbers and summary on what is working and what is not for me during all these preparations, launching etc. but I hope to do it as soon as I get more free time!

Thank you so much for checking out, and **I hope I can give a bit of motivation to others who might be creating their first game like me!** And a big thank you to all the developers that have been sharing their experiences in gaming communities, without them I definitely wouldn't have made it this far. üß°",1,1730681208.0,gamedev,1,1.0,False

‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶



Over twenty years have passed since I, Samara Holt, have had the displeasure of working the missing child cases of Occoquan, Virginia. All these years later, that town and its mysteries still haunt me. I should‚Äôve known that whatever Sweet Tooth was, finding those children‚Äôs remains wouldn‚Äôt have stopped whatever horror it planned on bringing to our world. I shouldn‚Äôt have even posted my recollection on Reddit. Rotting memories like that should‚Äôve stayed buried in the filthy soil they came from. The lovely eight-year-old girl who lived next to me, Samantha Brown, went missing the day I posted my traumas on Reddit. Sweet Tooth‚Ä¶ *It‚Äôs not* done.¬†



That being said, the more people know about it, the more eyes there are to help stop it. Merely a day passed after my post on Reddit, and I got a horrifying story from one Tina Sterling, a 911 phone operator. After having talked for a few hours to verify her story, she gave me the go-ahead to tell it here. What you are about to read is her true account, and one of the most disturbing real-life cases I‚Äôve ever heard.



‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì



Alright, essentially what I‚Äôll do is recount the phone call. My superiors said I‚Äôm not allowed to share the whole phone call with you, I can only tell you my experience with it. But I‚Äôm allowed to share a snippet of the ending for you to post. The public attention could lead to more eyes being on this case.



It was starting to get late. The sky had just begun to darken, as if the blue faded into the blackness of the void of space. The wind whistled through the barren and dying trees as their shadows grasped aimlessly across the ground. It was a slow day; I don‚Äôt think my phone had actually gotten any calls. The silence permeated the air in that office, interrupted by some of the other girls occasionally making small talk with each other.



As I got up to get a cup of steaming coffee, I *finally* got a call.¬†



**Me:** ‚Äú911, what is the address of your emergency?‚Äù



My heart sank when I heard the voice of a little boy answer the phone. He sounded no older than twelve and was in such clear distress it made me immediately want to cry.



**???:** ‚Äú... Uh‚Ä¶ uhm‚Ä¶ \[Redacted\].‚Äù



**Me:** ‚ÄúAlright, may I get your phone number and name?‚Äù



**Hugo:** ‚Äú\[Redacted\] and my name is Hugo.‚Äù



**Me:** ‚ÄúAlright, Hugo. Tell me exactly what your emergency is.‚Äù



I could sense the trepidation in his answer; my stomach dropped waiting for him to speak. He paused for a solid five seconds while I heard him rustle around his house.



**Hugo:** ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a‚Ä¶ man‚Ä¶ outside‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm home alone.‚Äù



**Me:** ‚ÄúAlright, stay on the phone with me, honey. Dispatch is on their way. They should arrive in no more than ten minutes. Do you know if the man is armed?‚Äù



**Hugo:** ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt see. \[Hugo gasps into the phone\] He‚Äôs‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs knocking on the door right now.‚Äù



**Me:** ‚ÄúWhatever you do, don‚Äôt answer it, sweetie. Find a place to hide where he can‚Äôt see you. Lock yourself where he can‚Äôt get to you.‚Äù



At this point, I can hear him rustling around his house even more. His breaths had gotten heavier and I could practically hear his heartbeat through the phone.



**Hugo:** ‚ÄúI locked myself in my room. I‚Äôm under the bed right now.‚Äù



**Me:** ‚ÄúHugo, stay on the phone with me. Dispatch should be there in about eight minutes.‚Äù



The wind outside the office started to blow almost as if in a rage. The shadows of the tree branches whipped across the yard as the moon lurched up into the night sky. However, the part that stuck out most about the scenery was the now dense fog that invaded every inch of the outside world.¬†



Dispatch was now only seven minutes away as I tried to comfort Hugo. He laid there breathing heavily under his bed. I couldn‚Äôt imagine the stress he was dealing with; to have a potential home invasion while home alone at twelve-years-old is a gut wrenching situation. But while waiting for him, one of the girls in the office, Savannah, got up. She meandered towards the front door and whisked it open. I was confused and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. As she walked back to her desk, she announced ‚ÄúI thought I heard somebody knocking at the door.‚Äù



**Me:** ‚ÄúDispatch is five minutes away now, honey. Can you still hear him knocking at your front door?‚Äù



**Hugo:** ‚ÄúNo. I don‚Äôt know if‚Ä¶‚Äù



**Me:** ‚ÄúHugo?‚Äù



**Hugo:** ‚ÄúI don-...‚Äù



**Me:** ‚ÄúHugo, what‚Äôs happening?‚Äù



Silence emanated from the phone call. I waited for all of five seconds before Hugo‚Äôs shrill cries pierced through the static emptiness of the phone. The little boy was now in hysterics as he cried out, screaming for his mom.



**Me:** ‚ÄúHugo! Hugo, what‚Äôs wrong!‚Äù



He managed to utter through the wails involuntarily escaping his mouth like a banshee cry.



**Hugo:** ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs breaking the door down!‚Äù¬†



The pit in my stomach turned into a gaping hole of dread. Was I about to hear a child get abducted? Was I about to hear a child‚Ä¶ get murdered? It was then that something made me leap out of my skin‚Ä¶ the wind had blown the front door wide open. Savannah went to shut it, and as soon as she stood up one of the light bulbs blew out, shattering the glass.¬†



Dispatch *needed* to get there. The thought of hearing the last cries of a frightened child truly chilled me. Hugo went quiet for a few seconds, his occasional whimpering cracking through the static silence. I tried comforting him through the phone but he never seemed to take notice; I didn‚Äôt blame him. My blood might as well have drained out of my body and onto the floor when I heard him whine into the phone like a dying mouse, the crashing and creaking of broken wood taunting in the background. Dispatch was only four minutes away.



**Me:** ‚ÄúHugo‚Ä¶ stay on the phone, okay sweetie?‚Äù



**Hugo:** ‚Äú\[Hugo crying\] Okay.‚Äù



In moments like this, the English language lacks the proper words to truly describe such feelings. It was almost like a conjuring of rotten fear and resurrection of the most empty dread this world has ever known. I could practically smell the feeling, a gust of the stench of Hell itself slithering through the air. I could hear the man calling Hugo‚Äôs name; his voice reeked of malice. The intruder‚Äôs footsteps creaked throughout Hugo‚Äôs house, almost as if tip toeing.¬†



Hugo‚Äôs whispers crackled through the phone.



**Hugo:** ‚Äú... help‚Ä¶ me. He‚Äôs‚Ä¶ inside.‚Äù



**Me:** ‚ÄúDispatch is three minutes away, sweetie. Your door is locked, right?‚Äù



**Hugo:** ‚Äú... yes‚Ä¶ ma‚Äôam.‚Äù



The sound of his crying shattered my soul. Was I seriously about to listen to a child get abducted? Or worse? I patiently waited on that phone call with Hugo, hoping to *God* that the officers would get there and save him before that monster could take him. That‚Äôs when something caught my eye. Out in the pitch black of the foggy, murky night‚Ä¶ I swore I saw children. It‚Äôs almost impossible to describe the sight; tens of children, maybe even a hundred, hovering through the trees in the night around the building.



‚ÄúWhat the actual fuck?‚Äù one of the other operators, Markie, muttered under her breath. The faint giggling in the night enveloped the office. Nearly imperceptible gowns, pants, and legs skipped through the tree line as the giggles turned into chanting. Officer Michaels leaped out of his chair and ran outside to confront whatever was out there. I looked back at my computer and my heart skipped a beat. Dispatch was arriving at the house.



Hugo managed to stay on the phone through all of this. The confusion and sense of wrongness was overwhelming to the point where I felt like I was gonna have a heart attack.



**Me:** ‚ÄúHugo, are you still there, sweetie?‚Äù



**Hugo:** ‚Äú... ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶‚Äù



**Me:** ‚ÄúHugo? Dispatch should be there now. The officers are pulling into the driveway.‚Äù



**Hugo:** ‚Äú... *It*‚Äôs right outside my door.‚Äù



My eyes almost slid out of their sockets. The fear enveloped my very being as the chanting from outside erupted into wicked cackling like a coven of witches gathered in the night. Officer Michaels fell through the front door of the office and scurried on the ground away from the door. His pale skin, shivering frame, and sweat told me everything. Whatever he saw out there I didn‚Äôt need to experience for myself.



**Hugo:** ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not playing with you, Sweet Tooth! I‚Äôm not playing with you!‚Äù



**Me:** ‚ÄúHugo, what‚Äôs happening? The officers should be in your house by now!‚Äù



**Hugo:** ‚Äú*It* wants me to play with *It*.‚Äù



**Me:** ‚Äú... It?‚Äù



As the cacophony of cackling withered down, I finally heard it. *Knock‚Ä¶ knock‚Ä¶ knock‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúCome play with me, Hugo.‚Äù*



Its voice didn‚Äôt even sound human. There was something rustic, or otherworldly about its voice. Savannah then took Officer Michaels to the back of the office to give him a cup of water. I made the mistake of looking outside as she did. Lurking out in the void beyond the window, right in front of the woods, stood a girl. Brown hair veiled her face, her stained dress fluttered in the wind, and *something* was holding her hand.



Just beyond her in the dark, lurking in the woods, hundreds of flickering lights. It took a minute before I realized what I was seeing‚Ä¶ the reflective eyes of hundreds of smiling little faces peering through the trees. I glimpsed back over to my computer and that sense of complete and crippling wrongness made itself more present. Answering the report from the cops‚Ä¶ there was *no* child at the house, only an elderly couple. Hugo was still on the other call.



**Me:** ‚ÄúHugo, sweetie? Are you there?‚Äù



Seconds of silence passed like a damning eternity. I could feel in my bones the dread that followed the idea of him being taken by whoever broke into his house.



**Hugo:** ‚Äú... *It*‚Äôs in my room.‚Äù



Tears flooded from my eyes like a broken dam. Whatever was happening didn‚Äôt feel real, it all felt like some seriously fucked up fever dream. The home invasion of a child, the wrong address, and the horrors laying just beyond the office windows‚Ä¶ it all felt so utterly unreal. Through the phone I started to hear something I couldn‚Äôt quite make out at first. It was almost like the sound of twigs snapping and the running of a body of water, but strangely, it almost felt like those sounds were a conversation. A second must‚Äôve passed until the most horrid sound shattered through the phone. The term ‚Äòscreaming‚Äô doesn‚Äôt do the sound justice at all. It was like the unleashing of the most tortured, visceral, painful, inhuman screech I‚Äôve ever heard.



As soon as the shrieking began, the lights in the office went haywire. They flickered and shattered like an unspeakable rage and hunger coursed through them. Through the visceral nightmare of what was unfolding, I could hear the screeching pleading for help. And as quickly as it started, it ceased as if it never existed in the first place. Markie was audibly crying at her desk. When I looked up at her, panic tore throughout my entire body. Peering in through the office window was the girl‚Ä¶ and the unspeakable darkness latching onto her hand. The phone became active with noise again. Moans and howls leaked through the phone like hundreds of souls shambling in pain. Then‚Ä¶ silence. I went to call out for Hugo again, but his interruption disturbed me to my very core.



**Hugo:** *‚ÄúYou all are going to die.‚Äù*



The phone call ended on Hugo‚Äôs end, and I dropped the hunk of plastic from my ear as I backed away from my desk. The sense of pure and unadulterated *evil* I felt staring at me from the darkness of the window has never and will never be matched again in my life. It was as if Hell itself was beckoning me to join it. Savannah came sprinting from the back with a look of pure terror enforced on her face. The unmistakable sound of a .45 going off left the entire office with a void of emptiness. Michaels shot himself in the head.



Savannah began to shriek; Markie and I tried our best to console her but to no avail. The chanting and cackling stirred up again in the darkness of the forest as the wind carried around the unmistakable howls of the damned. The translucent entities flew through the trees in an otherworldly dance. It wasn‚Äôt long before we found ourselves in complete darkness, making our way to the front door as the lights drained of life.¬†



The office stood still as the wailing and cackling enveloped the night. But the unmistakable sound of snapping twigs and running water filled my ears. They say that people have a fight or flight response, but that‚Äôs not true‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a third reaction to fear: to freeze. Looking down that impossibly dark hallway and at the room where Michaels just killed himself, there stood a figure. Darker than the darkest black, its unmistakable silhouette stood there with its head cocked to the side, too tall for the room. Its body shivered as it made what I can only describe as a breathing noise; the sound of rusted metal grinding against rusted metal.



Markie, Savannah, and I stood as some of the officers and other girls came to look for Michaels, all stopping in their tracks when they caught a glimpse of *It*. The cackling slithered through the air finding its way into every crevice of the building. *It* stood there, ‚Äòbreathing‚Äô, for all of five seconds. The lights in the hallway flickered on for a second and then back off. Yet within that miniscule timeframe, *It* bounded down that hallway in less than a second. *Its* massive frame bent down in the darkness of the doorframe mere inches away from us. I‚Äôve never ran so fast in my life. I booked it out of that office because my life depended on it, not paying attention to anything out in the wilderness as I made haste to my car and left that hellhole.



That‚Äôs not the end though. A day after our experience, Markie went missing. No one knows where she is. A week later, Savannah and her husband cannibalized their five-month-old child. They climbed to the roof of a building and stood there chanting, ‚ÄúWe did it for you! We did it all for you!‚Äù before jumping to their deaths; they‚Äôre corpses smiled while splattered across the concrete.



Roughly a week after that is when you posted your experiences on Reddit. I almost felt vindicated reading it, it meant I wasn‚Äôt insane. Your story urged me to look something up. The address Hugo gave me on the phone was the exact same address that Hugo Barnes went missing from in 1997.¬†



But Samara, I can‚Äôt help but feel that I‚Äôm next on *Its* list. Those runes you mentioned‚Ä¶ they‚Äôve been appearing near my house. I swear that I‚Äôm hearing the voices of children beckoning from the woods. I‚Äôm seeing *It* in my dreams‚Ä¶ Sweet Tooth. Help me.



‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì



The fear I felt reading Tina‚Äôs account and being able to verify it almost rivaled when I saw Sweet Tooth for myself. Since she asked me to, I‚Äôll be posting a link to the last snippet of her phone call‚Ä¶ but I warn the listeners, it‚Äôs one of the most unsettling things I‚Äôve had the misfortune of hearing. [A YouTube link to the phone call snippet.](https://youtu.be/qlyQGSqEo4c?si=rspQnOxPcF1te1KN)



I fear that Sweet Tooth isn‚Äôt done with me either. It can‚Äôt be a mistake that Samantha Brown goes missing right next door; last seen wandering off into the woods. It can‚Äôt be a mistake that Tina Sterling finds my post so soon after her experience. It can‚Äôt be a mistake hearing the beckoning voices of children in the shadowed corners of my house. It can‚Äôt be a mistake that Markie, Savannah, Officer Michaels, recent missing children, and Tina Sterling‚Äôs households all form a perfect circle around the remnants of the Crane Mansion, their cellar.



As I type this, my dog continues to stare out the ajar door‚Ä¶ alerted, standing guard to *something* making its presence known in the vantablack of the hallway beyond my room.



I‚Äôll post if anything comes up. For now, I‚Äôll rot away in fear in this unwelcoming gathering of pure and unmistakable evil that was once my house. See you all soon. Be safe.

1gj1xic,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZodiacKiller/comments/1gj1xic/did_charles_manson_drink_zodiacs_milkshake/,Did Charles Manson drink Zodiac‚Äôs milkshake?,"I think we can all agree that Zodiac craved publicity and south the limelight (even if he didn‚Äôt want to be caught and pay the price for his crimes). i find it hard to believe he didn‚Äôt have a deep sense of frustration for having his handiwork overshadowed by the killings related to Charles Manson.

Here‚Äôs a timeline:

Zodiac was born July 4, 1969, when he murdered Darlene Ferrin and attempted to murder Michael Mageau in Vallejo, afterward making the call to police to report it. He also on the call took credit for the Benicia double murder the previous year, but up to that point it was just an unsolved with no hint that someone would later claim responsibility in a very public way.

Even so, this hardly created a ripple outside of the local area until July 31, when he sent his three-part cipher to publications in San Francisco and the Vallejo Times-Herald. Now he was big news.

(It hardly matters for the purposes of publicity and garnering attention/creating fear if you or I believe he did the earlier CJB murder in Riverside or any other killings. Or even if you think Blue Rock Springs was perpetrated by someone else ‚Äî by claiming it along with the Vallejo murder, he got the spotlight he wanted.)

Zodiac was christened on Aug. 4 when he wrote the SF Examiner and first used that name for himself.

At this point, Zodiac has the attention he craves and was surely the talk of the town. Mysterious multiple murderer with a ‚Äòsuper villain‚Äô name at large.

Then, days later, on the night of Aug. 8/wee hours of Aug. 9, actress Sharon Tate and four others are slayed in Los Angeles. Not only was Tate a celebrity, her husband was famous director Roman Polanski and two other victims ‚Äî coffee heiress Abigail Folger and hair stylist Jay Sebring ‚Äî were noteworthy to the public as well. This became national news overnight. (The murders of the LaBiancas the next night didn‚Äôt get as much publicity ‚Äî nor did the previous killing of Gary Hinman ‚Äî until they were tied in with the Manson ‚Äòfamily‚Äô afterward.)

At this point, Zodiac is forgotten, especially outside the San Francisco area. His body count has been topped in one bloody night and the Tate murders bring in the whole Hollywood/Hollyweird element. 

Zodiac claims more victims in September at Lake Berryessa and October with the Stine killing, and ups the ante as far as shock value ‚Äî the crazy/creepy costume at the lake and the bloody shirt that he sent pieces of to the media from the cabbie killing. Maybe he figured he needed to make a bold move to remind the world he was major news ‚Ä¶ things had quieted down in LA after the Tate killings and he could seize the limelight once more.

Well, for a minute. On Dec. 1, law enforcement announced that the Tate AND LaBianca murders had been solved. Manson wasn‚Äôt yet mentioned, but his name was leaked to the press as the guru/leader who sent out his hippie-like (at least in appearance, to the public) young minions out ot do his bidding and his killing. By Dec. 9 he had been formally indicted and was a celebrity killer, with the press following his every move and utterance from that point on as the pretrial and trail played out.

Meanwhile Zodiac is fading into obscurity with a few more letters and less and less attention on him, even with his threats against school children and using bombs. After a while, it all begins to ring hollow and the Bay Area moves on. The Manson trial is a circus providing news and surprises every day with the defendants acting up, playing out until January 1971.

I just have to think that Zodiac had to begin to feel impotent that he couldn‚Äôt hold the world‚Äôs ‚Äî or even San Francisco‚Äôs ‚Äî attention in a big way and that all of his crimes were so soon overshadowed by bigger (or more media-covered) doings in LA.",1,1730680725.0,ZodiacKiller,0,1.0,False

1gj1r3c,https://i.redd.it/texq3r8t4syd1.jpeg,An ode to my favorite brewer. ,"I wrote a little article about the Gabi Master A and why I think more people should be using it. 

The Gabi Master A isn‚Äôt the type of brewer that shows up with bells, whistles, and a pretentious attitude. Instead, it‚Äôs a humble collection of individual drippers that stack up to give you an almost boring but wildly-delicious experience. I stumbled upon The Gabi through Justin at Genre. I looked it up, didn't quite get the hype‚Äîbut then I used the damn thing. The Gabi wasn‚Äôt just another brewer. See, she had a purpose: to take out the guesswork, and to let the coffee show up exactly how it is‚Äîfor better or for worse.

While modern brewers add levers, switches, and dials to control flow from below, the Gabi lets gravity handle things from above. You just set it up, yeet in your water, and watch it work. Gabi‚Äôs design is about precision without hassle. The water drips evenly across the coffee bed with such smooth, steady control that it almost feels automated. Every single drop is counted for, and in perfect rhythm, like it‚Äôs been rehearsing this dance for years.

The Gabi Dripper‚Äôs true charm? It‚Äôs more versatile than you think. It doesn‚Äôt demand center stage. You can pair its top half with other brewers to create a different experience based on the coffee you‚Äôre brewing. Co-ferments really shine when paired with a classic V60, that extra bypass does the Lord‚Äôs work here.

At the end of the day, what it comes down to is trust. In an industry obsessed with the next big thing, the Gabi has been holding its own since 2016, proving itself a reliable choice for coffee enthusiasts who want clarity and consistency. That‚Äôs why we trust Gabi as our go-to for every coffee review here. For as tasty of a cup as it can deliver, what it really does best is let each coffee tell you about itself without hiding behind the variance of hand brewing. Both Genre and H&S rely on the Gabi to test every coffee‚Äôs roast profile before it reaches the mouths of the public. If they trust it, we‚Äôre in good company.

1gj1oaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/MeMyselfWeOurself/comments/1gj1oaj/sunday_reflections_moments_of_connection_amidst/,Sunday Reflections: Moments of Connection Amidst Chaos,"After a satisfying morning of decluttering, I started my day with a warm cup of coffee at Starbucks, as mentioned in my previous post. It was the perfect place to settle in and spend some time reading, video editing, and writing this very blog (**details on that will be shared in another post‚Äîstay tuned**!).

From Starbucks, I headed to Costco to return an air fryer. Costco is my go-to place‚Äîtheir customer service is second to none. While there, I picked up a shredder and, feeling hungry, treated myself to a slice of their delicious cheese pizza.

Costco was buzzing with life; it seemed like everyone was shopping as if it were the last day it would be open. I watched families and individuals alike moving through the aisles, each lost in their own worlds. Fathers and daughters, complete families, and solo shoppers‚Äîeveryone was there with their own purpose, adding to the vibrant atmosphere.

Amidst this hustle, I stood in line and noticed an elderly lady, probably in her 70s, walking quickly with a few items in her hands, trying to get in line. I offered her my place, and her face lit up with gratitude. She mentioned she had forgotten a couple of items and hurried off to retrieve them. We exchanged a few kind words, and it was a heartwarming moment.

As the cashier, visibly tired but still attentive and kind, processed my turn, there was a little twist: the elderly lady had mistakenly paid for my bill. The cashier quickly realized the error, and we waited for the lady to return from the restroom. While we waited, I sat down to enjoy my pizza. The kindness didn't stop there‚Äîa gentleman nearby offered me a drink, an unexpected gesture that added to the warmth of the day.

When the elderly lady returned, she was apologetic and embarrassed for the mix-up. I reassured her that it was completely fine. We shared a few more kind words, and she left with a satisfied smile.

This whole experience was a beautiful reminder that even in a busy, chaotic world, small acts of kindness make a big difference. Caring for others not only lifts them up but leaves us with a feeling of genuine connection and warmth.

I have been a digital artists for year that, the past year, decided to learn pixel art and to learn how to make a game. I have done tons of hours of research through out best genres to start with, best practices, marketing tips, fundraiser ideas and so on.

I went with a cozy cafe sim idea as I'm a fan of cute cozy games such as animal crossing, stardew valley, a short hike and similar so as a cozy community member, I thought something that I'm most familiar with would be the best to start.

I started posting very rough ideas of the game around a year ago since I learned that starting to market the game would be the best as early as possible and any visual image/draft/sketch can be turned into marketing material. I created the most popular social medias, memorable name (Coffee Beans Dev) and started interacting with a bunch of people around.

A bit after, I made a Steam page for the game which gained 1.000 wishlists within a day, over 10k within a month and is currently sitting at 28.000+ wishlists. Again, I wanted to start collecting wishlists ASAP so my initial page was a complete draft, with little images, text and no trailer. The current Steam page still needs some improvements but is currently [in this state.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2922570/Tailside/)

The game is called **Tailside: Cozy Cafe Sim** and has just recently launched a fundraiser page (I was so busy I forgot to post the launch post of it here, so hopefully it's fine if I still do it now!)

The community that has been built around Tailside made sure of a great head start with the fundraiser, quickly reaching a few stretch goals and other achiemevents. And since I'm trying my best to reach more of the goals to be able to add all the other fun ideas I got in mind, I would love for anyone who might be interested to check it out as well (or check it for reference on how I set it up):

I haven't been able lately to compile and share too much of numbers and summary on what is working and what is not for me during all these preparations, launching etc. but I hope to do it as soon as I get more free time!

Thank you so much for checking out, and **I hope I can give a bit of motivation to others who might be creating their first game like me!** And a big thank you to all the developers that have been sharing their experiences in gaming communities, without them I definitely wouldn't have made it this far. üß°",3,1730679793.0,pcgaming,0,0.64,False

- huge emotional swings a day or two before it begins, where I want to punch and cry at the same time
- heavy bleeding with clots. I use tampons and pads for the first few days, together
- migraines
- severe cramping and nausea, to where I can't get out of bed
- exhaustion 
- diarrhea
- gums swell in my mouth
- acne on my forehead (I never had acne, even as a teen) as the kicker

I'm getting a mirena iud put back in (I've used them for years prior kids) in two weeks. I'm hoping that helps with the amount of bleeding. I can't take birth control pills due to breast cancer history in my family.

I've had ultrasounds to rule out endometriosis (apparently I don't have it).

My gyno suggested perhaps it's perimenopause as I'm 41. I'm working on getting my weight down (20lbs overweight where I'd like to be - 180lbs for 5'10). Working on strength training/an an ex-varsity athlete so I love exercise. I try to eat iron rich foods. I don't drink or smoke. I try exercising and getting my heart rate up 4x a week. My vice is coffee, which I often don't drink during my periods because I feel like a sack of poop.

Beyond taking Tylenol and Advil together, what else can I do? Being laid up in bed for 2-3 days is so hard for parenting and working. I'm at a loss and tired of dreading my period. I'd like to be somewhat functional again :(.",1,1730679668.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

On occasion I completely quit coffee and any anxiety or paranoia I might have goes down which is great, i mean theres not a ton of benefits to me confsuming coffee aside from some mild increase in focus. The anxiety and paranoia is a downside which i really am aiming to reduce(currently by drinking more coffee than ever giving me negative effects). 

  
Anyone else however, quit coffee and notice more synchronicities on the occasion that they do? The last few times I quit I'd notice more thing matching up and lining up just right, things seemed to coincide, the universe went back into having periods of times with various themes that would flow in and out. Then I'd drink coffee and everything stopped while, slowly, the anxiety and all the nasty downsides of this double edged sword crept back in. Feelings that I was being watched or others had nefarious purpouses or that I needed to escape some specific thing I wasn't usually wary of crept back in after a few days of coffee. Understandable feeling connected and noticing the minute connections between specks and spots around me isn't as worriesome as the feeling that I need to persue some grand escapade or that ordinarilly innocent well meaning familly members have something against me and know what I'm doing secretely.

  
I just seem to notice things more without coffee, yet being slightly more disorganized and bumfuddled and chaotic and messed around and my adhd, which I do have diagnosed, seems to take the reigns slightly and productivity decreases. Currently attempting, perhaps in err, to drink a copious amount of coffee in order to somehow increase productivity at the expense of my mental health and anxiety and fears.

This particular excerpt, titled:

‚ÄúMichael, Why Art Thou Gay?‚Äù

Meant, of course, to introduce some levity, but there‚Äôs also a more formal title: 

‚ÄúAn Explanation to a Friend Beginning on the Reason Why I Figured the Angel Michael was Queer‚Äù

‚ÄúBeginning on,‚Äù I‚Äôve said in particular, because my explanation took form another way‚Äîand maybe appropriately, because is it right to out an angel? The Angel‚Äîa god‚Äîeven?

And I have long abandoned my wrestlings ‚Ä¶ 

I much rather prosper than prevail. 

Again, if I should add this for the more serious and ruminating crowd: though honest, I‚Äôm only introducing levity here, and with icebreaking wit üòÇ 

Frozen solid? Okay. Well, anyway, here we go:¬†

The conversation:

My friend: ‚ÄúNo worries, it made me chuckle,‚Äù she replied to something not-so-relevant to everything that follows this‚Äîmaybe (and her own discourse explores that maybe) ‚Ä¶¬†

Myself: ‚ÄúThere was an innocence to it (an inappropriate joke I made, still irrelevant üòÇ), actually: wait till I tell the story how, if in any precise way I'm able to substantiate it to par, my impression of the Angel was that He was gay.‚Äù

And so it went ‚Ä¶ 

¬ª
Well I probably won‚Äôt share that with like, everyone üòÇ unless you, mutual reader, come across this note‚Äîand for you I will explain. Here we go. Know that it was an argument posed to myself in defense of a universal love; a divine love met with a divine ethic that is at once two things: 1.) good, and impartial to that effect, being therefore supreme in its metaphysical ‚Äòposition‚Äô (holy and sacred regard), its metaphysical descent (to all humanity), and metaphysical ascent (among all divine beings), altogether these in its being relayed; and I want to make a point of this first statement, because we may imagine that an ethic like this sounds like certainty about something like sexual orientation, and to the Christian‚Äôs defense, I do mean certainty, and not condemnation, but certainly ‚Äòcertainty,‚Äô about what characteristic describes a Heavenly Father and His male Logos (see her note); I would also posit, in my assumption of the faith I once held, that any certain kind of orientation of an individual describes a primary orientation of the soul; but also, as far as the ethic goes, again, 2.) unbinding on that universal love, because of love‚Äôs perfection as a nature‚Äînot even a concept, nor even an ever-present and unyielding reality, but a rare, fluid, resilient, dynamic, and even yielding, nature. I would even question myself for trying another word on for fit for the category of what love should be. But this love that I figured had to be, had to be so perfectly boundless that in its translation into a discipline, it was completely and utterly lawless: ‚ÄúBe fruitful and multiply, fill the Earth and subdue it.‚Äù Just engage in sex, basically. This command of course was in pursuit of an end of earthly population, but as I tried to articulate in the earlier part of this message, its claim to divine order is not only with the supreme ethic, which as an ethic always serves to RIGHTLY (capitalized because this is literally ethics‚Äô main priority) accomplish something set in mind by the particular nature of whatever ethic it is; to bring about some kind of chosen end, but in the love itself also, because of a love-provided plasticity and strength and agreeability that the divine needs for its being, identity, and satiation.

As for the plasticity and ‚Äòdynamicy' of love that prevails over an ethic:

‚ÄúFor John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon. The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, 'Look, a glutton and a winebibber, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' But wisdom is justified by all her children."" Luke 7:33-35 NKJV

And then, the necessity for things of love to be tried against actual, unethical lawlessness‚Äîto be refined‚Äîand to claim back their justification, which justification can maybe only be communicated by grace: unchecked, un-appended, salvific grace, in which He needed to be learned, and in the presence of a great demon: 

‚ÄúThen Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.‚Äù Matthew‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠4‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠1‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NKJV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨

And as for the Ruach, the Holy Spirit, who I believed was most closely oriented towards or most upholding of this universal and collectively actualized love‚Äîparticularly in a sanctifying and 'exactifying' sense‚ÄîI believed that righteousness and personal holiness required breaking points at the extremes of grace; of liberality:

""Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: ""Today, if you will hear His voice, Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, In the day of trial in the wilderness, Therefore I was angry with that generation, And said, 'They always go astray in their heart, And they have not known My ways. So I swore in My wrath, ‚ÄòThey shall not enter My rest."" Hebrews 3:7-8, 10-11 NKJV

I believed that this spirit was a Woman, a ""Ruach;‚Äù and that She was a great and holy demon; a God deemed to be mostly unknown, because of what both of those, especially the last, meant for a divine order of human understanding; one posited and ordained by the family of Yahweh that the Angel shared in (""for My Name is in Him"") but also somehow pridefully remained sure of Himself in His role, which was no slight to God being a fair-natured god existing in fairness or fair circumstance (I believed that things around God were good, and not just that He was good in a Heaven or unseen world of extreme strife üòÇüòÇ‚Äîlike having ALL beings originate by your craftsmanship or something and ALL subservient). I believed that, in fact, this God was someone of whom something somewhat like this was spoken to another: ‚ÄúAnd the Lord said to her: ‚ÄúTwo nations are in your womb, Two peoples shall be separated from your body; One people shall be stronger than the other, And the older shall serve the younger,‚Äù Genesis‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠25‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠23‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NKJV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨. And that that great mystery of persons and origins explained how the Angel and Yahweh could in biblical text share of the same name, as of a divine namesake, as of a family of great beings, as of powerful and yet individually purposed and regarded individuals. 

‚ÄúBehold, I send an Angel before you to keep you in the way and to bring you into the place which I have prepared. Beware of Him and obey His voice; do not provoke Him, for He will not pardon your transgressions; for My name is in Him.‚Äù Exodus‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠23‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠20‚Ä¨-‚Ä≠21‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NKJV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨

The latter verse is as if God was to say, ‚ÄúMy name in your tongue, ‚ÄòI will be to you,‚Äô as it is set forth before Me, ‚ÄòYahweh,‚Äô is a promise within Him.‚Äù This tells of either an appetite satiated or an innate possession estranged, like that of a birthright unfulfilled. And yet, the Angel defers, even as one who serves His younger brother‚Äîboth of these interpretations are concepts biblically familiar, and together so. 

But to not detract from my main point‚Äîthe Ruach Hakodesh, a holy Demon; and this attested to by our traditional observation of the being‚Äôs characteristic to activate humanity‚Äôs senses in a kind of sacred sensuality in our experience, inquiry and pursuit of existential and divine discovery. 

So you could say I was a very liberal Christian? üòÇ but I feel like I was faithful to what things could really be, and I was most definitely inspired; inspired by what I read and what was around me. I would always knowingly screenshot secularly inspired things I saw on the internet that I felt like spoke to this liberal divine that had its pervasive and respective and nuanced effects on humanity. 

Also, a disclaimer for the context of my first thought: I‚Äôm cis straight üòÇ so I have no particular preference of interpretation besides consistency across reading, and truly, any available information (say the Tao Te Ching) as well as correspondence to an apparent or possibly metaphysical reality. 

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ In response to my friend‚Äôs reply that followed my ‚Äúwait till I tell you‚Äù text and preluded this discourse of mine, taking place during its writing: ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

And/But to your reply to me: Yes! I actually considered the same; that some of that imagery and expression of a consummative archetype‚Äîwhile it is indeed unclear if Christ is that quintessential reality of marriage (a truly sterile view in my opinion, either that or a dissolution of His unique and distinct person) or if, as the Church (of men and women, without partiality), we are simply to understand our relationship to Christ in the picture and even context of marriage, as a great allegory of real metaphysical, essential, or spiritual substance‚Äîagain, I considered that the theological imagery was a testament to a true divine ontological reality; true copies of the truer; a reality of at least 3 beings: the Father, the Angel (who is His older brother) and the Holy Ghost‚Äîwhich I‚Äôll briefly explain, too: 

I also imagined that Jesus, in assuming and actualizing into His role as a member and comprehensive representative of the family of the LORD‚Äîwhich I thought to be a real family of comparable beings of old, however deep and broad and communicable it was, but mostly, as far as we are concerned, a ‚Äògenetic‚Äô or generative line culminating in 2 LORDs, and with even more concern to us, a line producing the viable One‚Äôs dual-natured Heir; a Son who embraced both images of orientational love‚Äîand orientational, yes, but truly just ‚Äòuniversal love‚Äô in its honest and shameless expression‚Äîin His divine ministry. 

A universal love. 

And I I thought this to be a testament, even, and as I said I would explain, to a divine tension with another god whose own family or heritage embraced more liberal essences of things; another god who, in Christ‚Äôs realization of not only His own divinity but assumption of all that can be said to be divine according to the divine tension of ‚Äòbig-G Godhood,‚Äô required Him, this Son of Yahweh, to learn Her ways and Her ministry for the sake of all of Her children, as She did those who came before Him. 

‚ÄúFor John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‚ÄòHe has a demon.‚Äô The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‚ÄòLook, a glutton and a winebibber, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!‚Äô But wisdom is justified by all her children.‚Äù Luke‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠7‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠33‚Ä¨-‚Ä≠35‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NKJV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨

Though I am of no particular faith nowadays, besides my own that is in and within our apparent reality, and no longer believe in a god-reality generally, I still find a lot of passion in this interpretation of mine‚Äîwhich is mine only inasmuch as that word can regard the fact that I don‚Äôt feel it fitting to take ownership over anything I‚Äôve realized about ‚Äòthe God‚Äô over the years‚Äîand also within the intellectual honesty and self-authenticity I embraced to suppose everything I‚Äôve believed. Also, especially, and on account of that, I‚Äôm somewhat charmed by the fact that maybe no one else has come to the same conclusions.

- huge emotional swings a day or two before it begins, where I want to punch and cry at the same time
- heavy bleeding with clots. I use tampons and pads for the first few days, together
- migraines
- severe cramping and nausea 
- diarrhea 
- gums swell in my mouth
- acne on my forehead (I never had acne, even as a teen)

I'm getting a mirena iud put back in (I've used them for years prior kids) in two weeks. I'm hoping that helps with the amount of bleeding. I can't take birth control pills due to breast cancer history in my family.

I've had ultrasounds to rule out endometriosis (apparently I don't have it). 

My gyno suggested perhaps it's perimenopause as I'm 41. I'm working on getting my weight down (20lbs overweight). Working on strength training. I try to eat iron rich foods. I don't drink or smoke. I try exercising and getting my heart rate up 4x a week. My vice is coffee, which I often don't drink during my periods because I feel like a sack of poop.

From your experience, what else did you do? Being laid up in bed for 2-3 days is so hard for parenting and working. I'm at a loss and tired of dreading my period. I'd like to be somewhat functional again :(.

My kid is 9, and like all 9 year olds he has a lot of energy which he usually tempers in public because he also has extreme social anxiety to the point where we have him in therapy for it. He's generally a well behaved little dude - he says please and thank you, apologizes unprompted when he makes mistakes, takes his hat off at the dinner table before being asked, corrects people politely when they use offensive language, does what hes asked with little complaint. Heart of a lion, demeanour of a lamb. I can count on one hand the amount of times I've had to discipline him in the last few years because he's just not a problematic kid.    

So my dad and I took him to mcdonalds for a quick lunch and since he has never once changed his order we told him to go grab a seat on the long benches by the window. I went to grab napkins and ketchup while my dad ordered and when I sat down, my son immediately said ""mom can we please go eat in the car I don't want to be here anymore"". Took a minute of prompting before he admitted that he'd been sort of rocking in his seat bc he was nervous sitting alone (its something the therapist has recommended we do as it's a smal discomfortl and helps him get more comfortable being independent - the sitting alone not the rocking) and I guess the bumping annoyed the elderly couple at the next table so the man turned to him and yelled at him to ""cut it the fuck out"" and the woman then hissed ""seriously stop it"". I asked ""did he yell or did he just say it kind of loudly?"" And he said no, he definitely yelled and then slapped his hand on the table. Yall, he wasn't even at the table for more than two minutes tops.   

I told him we wouldn't be leaving but that I doubted they'd say anything else since I was there so he was safe. When my dad sat down between him and the couple he eased up enough to eat in complete silence and the couple looked mildly uncomfortable because it was obvious my son had said something, but I could tell he was still shaken. I chose not to confront the couple because I didn't want to stoop to their level but then. BUT THEN. They finished their coffees which let's be honest we all know they'd been camping with since 10am and the man walked up behind me, jabbed me in the shoulder and said ""sorry but he was bumping the bench and it was really annoying"" and I was so stunned the only thing I could think to say was ""okay well maybe don't yell at my kid"". What I wanted to say was ""yell at my kid again and it'll be the last words you utter"". My dad said ""was that guy serious?"" And I told him what had happened and I had to stop him from getting up and throwing hands with Methuselah because jail doesn't have  a seniors menu.       

Yes, I get that it was probably annoying, but there were other options. A) say to him politely ""hey could you please stop it's disruptive"" which he absolutely would have done and he even would have apologized because that's who he is as a person or b) wait til I sat down A MINUTE LATER and said ""Hi excuse me could you please ask your son to stop that?"" Which it wouldn't have even come to because he was simply antsy waiting for us to sit down while he was alone and vulnerable in an open concept area full of people.    

Anyway, fuck you mcdonalds Karens I hope you felt super powerful and smug yelling at someone a tenth of your age and half your size with an order of magnitude more social grace.",19,1730678816.0,FuckYouKaren,10,0.71,False

This particular excerpt, titled:

‚ÄúMichael, Why Art Thou Gay?‚Äù

Meant, of course, to introduce some levity, but there‚Äôs also a more formal title: 

‚ÄúAn Explanation to a Friend Beginning on the Reason Why I Figured the Angel Michael was Queer‚Äù

‚ÄúBeginning on,‚Äù I‚Äôve said in particular, because my explanation took form another way‚Äîand maybe appropriately, because is it right to out an angel? The Angel‚Äîa god‚Äîeven? As a choice amongst other creative choices, that is at the very least questionable of me, to me ‚Ä¶ and even if this character wouldn‚Äôt mind it of me, it‚Äôs maybe then inappropriate for my hospitality to the unacquainted reader, a stranger, thereby entering His realm of influence again‚Äîthis time giving me strife with gods (His acquaintance) and men (mine). And I have long abandoned my wrestlings ‚Ä¶ 

I much rather prosper than prevail. 

Again, if I should add this for the more serious and ruminating crowd: though honest, I‚Äôm only introducing levity here, and with icebreaking wit üòÇ 

Frozen solid? Okay. Well, anyway, here we go:¬†

The conversation:

My friend: ‚ÄúNo worries, it made me chuckle,‚Äù she replied to something not-so-relevant to everything that follows this‚Äîmaybe (and her own discourse explores that maybe) ‚Ä¶¬†

Myself: ‚ÄúThere was an innocence to it (an inappropriate joke I made, still irrelevant üòÇ), actually: wait till I tell the story how, if in any precise way I'm able to substantiate it to par, my impression of the Angel was that He was gay.‚Äù

And so it went ‚Ä¶ 

¬ª
Well I probably won‚Äôt share that with like, everyone üòÇ unless you, mutual reader, come across this note‚Äîand for you I will explain. Here we go. Know that it was an argument posed to myself in defense of a universal love; a divine love met with a divine ethic that is at once two things: 1.) good, and impartial to that effect, being therefore supreme in its metaphysical ‚Äòposition‚Äô (holy and sacred regard), its metaphysical descent (to all humanity), and metaphysical ascent (among all divine beings), altogether these in its being relayed; and I want to make a point of this first statement, because we may imagine that an ethic like this sounds like certainty about something like sexual orientation, and to the Christian‚Äôs defense, I do mean certainty, and not condemnation, but certainly ‚Äòcertainty,‚Äô about what characteristic describes a Heavenly Father and His male Logos (see her note); I would also posit, in my assumption of the faith I once held, that any certain kind of orientation of an individual describes a primary orientation of the soul; but also, as far as the ethic goes, again, 2.) unbinding on that universal love, because of love‚Äôs perfection as a nature‚Äînot even a concept, nor even an ever-present and unyielding reality, but a rare, fluid, resilient, dynamic, and even yielding, nature. I would even question myself for trying another word on for fit for the category of what love should be. But this love that I figured had to be, had to be so perfectly boundless that in its translation into a discipline, it was completely and utterly lawless: ‚ÄúBe fruitful and multiply, fill the Earth and subdue it.‚Äù Just engage in sex, basically. This command of course was in pursuit of an end of earthly population, but as I tried to articulate in the earlier part of this message, its claim to divine order is not only with the supreme ethic, which as an ethic always serves to RIGHTLY (capitalized because this is literally ethics‚Äô main priority) accomplish something set in mind by the particular nature of whatever ethic it is; to bring about some kind of chosen end, but in the love itself also, because of a love-provided plasticity and strength and agreeability that the divine needs for its being, identity, and satiation.

As for the plasticity and ‚Äòdynamicy' of love that prevails over an ethic:

‚ÄúFor John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon. The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, 'Look, a glutton and a winebibber, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' But wisdom is justified by all her children."" Luke 7:33-35 NKJV

And then, the necessity for things of love to be tried against actual, unethical lawlessness‚Äîto be refined‚Äîand to claim back their justification, which justification can maybe only be communicated by grace: unchecked, un-appended, salvific grace, in which He needed to be learned, and in the presence of a great demon: 

‚ÄúThen Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.‚Äù Matthew‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠4‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠1‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NKJV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨

And as for the Ruach, the Holy Spirit, who I believed was most closely oriented towards or most upholding of this universal and collectively actualized love‚Äîparticularly in a sanctifying and 'exactifying' sense‚ÄîI believed that righteousness and personal holiness required breaking points at the extremes of grace; of liberality:

""Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: ""Today, if you will hear His voice, Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, In the day of trial in the wilderness, Therefore I was angry with that generation, And said, 'They always go astray in their heart, And they have not known My ways. So I swore in My wrath, ‚ÄòThey shall not enter My rest."" Hebrews 3:7-8, 10-11 NKJV

I believed that this spirit was a Woman, a ""Ruach;‚Äù and that She was a great and holy demon; a God deemed to be mostly unknown, because of what both of those, especially the last, meant for a divine order of human understanding; one posited and ordained by the family of Yahweh that the Angel shared in (""for My Name is in Him"") but also somehow pridefully remained sure of Himself in His role, which was no slight to God being a fair-natured god existing in fairness or fair circumstance (I believed that things around God were good, and not just that He was good in a Heaven or unseen world of extreme strife üòÇüòÇ‚Äîlike having ALL beings originate by your craftsmanship or something and ALL subservient). I believed that, in fact, this God was someone of whom something somewhat like this was spoken to another: ‚ÄúAnd the Lord said to her: ‚ÄúTwo nations are in your womb, Two peoples shall be separated from your body; One people shall be stronger than the other, And the older shall serve the younger,‚Äù Genesis‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠25‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠23‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NKJV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨. And that that great mystery of persons and origins explained how the Angel and Yahweh could in biblical text share of the same name, as of a divine namesake, as of a family of great beings, as of powerful and yet individually purposed and regarded individuals. 

‚ÄúBehold, I send an Angel before you to keep you in the way and to bring you into the place which I have prepared. Beware of Him and obey His voice; do not provoke Him, for He will not pardon your transgressions; for My name is in Him.‚Äù Exodus‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠23‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠20‚Ä¨-‚Ä≠21‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NKJV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨

The latter verse is as if God was to say, ‚ÄúMy name in your tongue, ‚ÄòI will be to you,‚Äô as it is set forth before Me, ‚ÄòYahweh,‚Äô is a promise within Him.‚Äù This tells of either an appetite satiated or an innate possession estranged, like that of a birthright unfulfilled. And yet, the Angel defers, even as one who serves His younger brother‚Äîboth of these interpretations are concepts biblically familiar, and together so. 

But to not detract from my main point‚Äîthe Ruach Hakodesh, a holy Demon; and this attested to by our traditional observation of the being‚Äôs characteristic to activate humanity‚Äôs senses in a kind of sacred sensuality in our experience, inquiry and pursuit of existential and divine discovery. 

So you could say I was a very liberal Christian? üòÇ but I feel like I was faithful to what things could really be, and I was most definitely inspired; inspired by what I read and what was around me. I would always knowingly screenshot secularly inspired things I saw on the internet that I felt like spoke to this liberal divine that had its pervasive and respective and nuanced effects on humanity. 

Also, a disclaimer for the context of my first thought: I‚Äôm cis straight üòÇ so I have no particular preference of interpretation besides consistency across reading, and truly, any available information (say the Tao Te Ching) as well as correspondence to an apparent or possibly metaphysical reality.

First the annoying stuff. Most of it mild.

I pre-ordered the brewer on the Fellow website on August 6th, I believe that was within a couple of days of ordering opening up. I was disappointed when I saw a bunch of people picked up a brewer at Best Buy and other stores weeks before mine even shipped. It seems they would take care of preorders first, but I guess not.

Pairing the brewer with the app was a pain. Even though I could see it had successfully connected to my network the app still didn't see the device, it took several brewer reboots and about 20 minutes to get it to work. Not the end of the world, but this stuff should be easy.

Besides the difficulty pairing, the app isn't ready for prime time. You'd think you'd be able to do something in the app, but you can't \*do\* anything. At the least I'd like to see, create, and change schedules, along with starting a brew immediately. None of that is available. They make it clear they'll be adding features, but this stuff is necessary on day one for a minimum viable product when your product is an Internet connected coffee brewer.

The control wheel is hard to use. Moving one click frequently doesn't do anything, when it should move up or down in the menu. Moving more than one click frequently skips over menu items. It's way too finicky; hopefully they'll add some features (such as custom brews) to the app soon, I won't be using them until they do because of this problem.

All that being said. It makes a very nice cup of coffee. There's certainly room for improvement, and hopefully much of that improvement can be made in software, but I'm glad I bought it. I won't be preordering from them again, I'll just buy the thing at Best Buy. I was also slightly insulted by the requirement to agree to SMS messages for a 10% discount after registering the product. Hell no! But I'll get over all of my complaints, it's good at the important stuff, making coffee.",2,1730678717.0,FellowProducts,0,0.75,False

Her explosive outburst and hasty departure catch him off guard, a rare occurrence. He stands frozen for a moment, the weight of his words still lingering in the air between them.

For weeks, months even, he's noticed her deteriorating condition - the bruises, her erratic behavior, the changes in her appearance. At first, he brushed it off as stress, exhaustion from the demanding workload. *All this time, I've been pushing her, driving her harder, demanding more, all while telling myself it was for the sake of the work, for the mission. But deep down, I knew.*  As her condition worsened, so did his growing concern... and something else. Something he's been battling to suppress. The realization hit him like a punch to the gut. *I've always known. I just didn't want to agnowledge it.*

He curses under his breath, the weight of what just happened crashing down on him. *I knew this was coming. I could see it in her eyes every day, that haunted look, the shadows that seemed to grow darker with each passing week. But I never thought... I didn't realize how bad it had gotten.*

Now, seeing her like this, her thin frame shaking with barely contained emotion, he feels a surge of‚Ä¶ *protectiveness? Anger? Jealousy, even?* He pushes aside the unfamiliar sensations, focusing instead on the matter at hand.

His gaze falling on the scattered petals littering the floor close to the trashcan under her desk, a few bloody droplets smeared across the tile. He knows the myth, the devastating effects. *There's no mistaking it now. Hanahaki. The rarest, most painful form of the disease. And I know, without a doubt, that I am the cause.* The words echo in his mind, pieces finally falling into place.

He moves with calculated precision, his heels clicking purposefully as he exits the office. There's no chance in hell he'll let her drive off in her state. *Not after everything - the insults, the coffee cups, the fucking flowers on her desk.* He's pushed her too far, and now he needs to make it right.

Reaching the parking lot, he spots her car idling, the driver's side door still open. Without hesitation, he strides over and yanks the door further open, leaning in to grab the keys from the ignition.

I'm totally confused. How to proceed/handle?","This is niche, I apologize. We're in our late 30's/early 40s, both women. I have a late diagnosis. 

It's been a couple years since we've seen each other (moves for work) but we try to keep up. She's neurotypical, but her husband and son are ND. I visited for the weekend. I hold her in high esteem, she's been through a lot.

Throughout the visit, I kept trying to get her to talk/open up and she'd turn the conversation back to me. That's fine, I just don't want to ""talk at"" anyone. Every time I asked for her input or insight into an ongoing situation she didn't say much. I enjoyed the weekend, I thought it went well. As we parted over coffee, I wanted to pay her a compliment to ensure it ended on a really good note.

Years ago she'd written a book (self-published), non-fiction. I was supportive. When my month came up for the book club I hosted, I bought everyone copies of it and we all did it one month. Everyone felt like it was just.. basic. At best. Some members went as far as to say it was bad and like it was written towards a low reading level audience. I didn't entirely disagree. It was to the point that many of us were left wondering why she felt the need to write it, as many other books had been written on the subject. Our main criticism was it lacked depth and critical thinking. We struggled with generating conversation about it... and to make it worse, that was the point of the book. To generate conversation about the subject.

She's sensitive and very proud of the accomplishment. I knew the feedback would gut her back then, so I was polite. 

The writing topic of her book had come up over the weekend and I'd asked some questions on if her views had changed or if she had to write it again if she'd do anything different. Her response was adamant: No! I said oh okay, it'd just seemed like your views on the topic had matured and become nuanced, that she seemed more confident and passionate on the subject matter. She kind of laughed and said she'd become more radicalized and bold in sharing but that's it. We hugged, she said she loved me and we said our goodbyes. I thought it ended on a great note.

About two hours later she sent me a voice memo that said she was so upset she had to step out of church service to get this off her chest. She was deeply offended that I'd asked those questions. Because I'd asked them, to her it was indicative that I didn't 'see' or 'know her'. She was deeply hurt and wounded because she'd spent so much time trying to 'see' me and felt I hadn't reciprocated. That she'd held a lot of 'silent space' for me this weekend as a way of her 'seeing me', but I hadn't held that 'same space' for her. She asked me to think and meditate on this topic \*for several weeks\* and then we should catch up on my 'revelations' from doing that.

I'm fucking baffled. I started to write a text that I don't know how to read silence, a lot of times people are tired when they're quiet. It can mean anything. And that I just need direct communication, I didn't know that's what she was trying to do with us? And I also have no idea what she's talking about. 

Also, I... Idk. I'm at a loss. I was not really invested in any of my questions.",1,1730678399.0,AutismInWomen,1,1.0,False

# A Fool‚Äôs Errand



*September 29th, 2023:* 

*Hopital du Valais | Sion, Zwizerland*



It wasn‚Äôt a good idea to begin with‚Ä¶.

My mountaineering experience is above average for the common person, but my formal training in moving through complex and challenging terrain was extremely limited. I had spent time in a mountaineering unit in the Vermont National Guard, and in the Mountain Cold Weather Company at Norwich University, but this was years ago and my skills had become brittle. In the past few years, my mountaineering activities have consisted of overnight trips to Tuckerman‚Äôs Ravine to climb established bootpack on consolidated snow. In the weeks leading up to my accident, my preparation was limited to a few outings with friends to belay them and practice some leading on mild granite routes and some scrambling up some of the NH Terrifying 25 trails. Maxing out at 5.9. Hardly adequate to consider summiting the Matterhorn with a guide, let alone soloing it.

I had met a couple of climbers on facebook groups and planned to meet up with one of them in Zermatt to acclimatize and train together for this objective. The day before our planned rendezvous, my partner from Poland injured his knee and cancelled his flight to Switzerland.

I was left in a difficult position of trying to find a partner last minute. I spoke with some locals about finding partners and their answers confirmed my fallback plan to find someone at the Hornli Hut to climb with. This was not inconsistent with other outings I have had on Mount Washington. It is often difficult to plan multiday outings with folks and so, without fail, I have found some amazing people on trail to explore the mountains with.

I arrived at the Hornlihutte around 5:30pm after a day of ‚Äúacclimatizing‚Äù with my mom and brothers up on the Klein Matterhorn. We took the lift up to Schwartzee together and hikes part of the way to Hornli together until they had to turn back for the last chair. We said our goodbyes-yes, goodbyes because it was possible that I would not return- and I continued on up the foot of the Hornli ridge with the extra water they packed for me.

Trepidation followed me up the route, past the rock battered metal staircases and through switchbacks of the increasingly snowy ridgeline. This feeling was not unfamiliar to me, though its potency was stronger than I had felt in the past. The Hornli is no joke. The likelihood and severity of the dangers make it a highly risky endeavor despite it not being the most technical route compared to say, the north face. It is only rated a 5.4 on the American Scale. All of that said, I have been climbing things since I was a kid and my confidence in difficult terrain comes more naturally to me than to others. Perhaps this increased my risk. Confidence sans experience kills more people than fear does. It emboldens the climber to enter situations without a backup plan. Going up is one thing. Coming down is another. I had planned to abseil down much of the mountain.

The Hornlihutte seemed completely deserted when I arrived. Not a soul or a fresh boot print could be found and it was eerily quiet. ‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs not good.‚Äù I expected to hear the din of Esperanto coming from climbers eager for their alpine start in just a few hours. ‚ÄúDozens of people climb it every day‚Äù I was told by a paragliding guide earlier that day. ‚ÄúYou should have no problem finding a partner at the hut.‚Äù

I walked around the hut several times trying to find the Winter Room which happens to be up a ladder on the South side of the building facing the Matterhorn. Invariably, there is always ambiguity when new terrain without an experienced companion. After about 20 minutes and trying the same locked doors multiple times, I looked up and saw the metal balcony and glass door to the winter room. After struggling to climb through the fire-escape-style ladder, I accessed my home for the night to the pleasant surprise of nice bunks, electricity and heat. Amidst all of the niceties, my heart sank. I was still alone. I settled in and kept a positive mindset. At least I could choose whichever bunk I wanted‚Ä¶

I laid out my sleeping bag to let it loft and prepared my kit to recon the lower section of the mountain while I still had daylight. I knew this would be one of the most difficult sections and so I wanted to get eyes on before navigating it in the dark in about 9 hours.

With a lighter pack and my harness on, I left the warmth of the refuge and started down the ladder toward the base of the Hornligrat. Guarded by a statue of what I presumed to Mary and Jesus the first steps of the route any void any question that this will be easy. Rebar steps drilled into vertical gneiss are proceeded by sketchy fixed ropes which separating the wheat from the chaff.

The bootpacked ice of this section made it tempting to don crampons, though it quickly mellowed out after a few hurtles. Rounding the corner the full mountain came into view, along with the fabled maze of the lower section. Loose gravel and inconspicuous cairns tepidly marked the way into an ever winding labyrinth of loose stone. Looming above were jagged overhangs tempting to let go at any second whilst the greater might of the mountain cast is shadow across the glacial valley 2,000 feet below. I was totally alone.

The sun was setting. Alpenglow ignited the glaciated peaks of the Breithorn and Monte Rosa to the east. It was a serene moment. I could have kept it all to myself but instead I decided to use the surprisingly good cell service to facetime my dad and girlfriend.

As orange gave way to indigo, it was time to turn back. I got eyes on the lower section of the route and wanted to get some time on my rope for the descent.

Feeling good about starting my actual climb in just a few hours, I confidently made my way back toward the start of the route. In a narrow ice-filled gulley I found a newer bolt placement in the rock. I added my crampons to the mix so I could more safely set up an abseil with my 50m 8mm Mammut Dry rope, belay device and hollow block prussik. I tied in my stopper knots and readied to cast the rope down the chute. ‚ÄúRope!‚Äù I called jokingly as I tossed the two strands out and down. I couldn‚Äôt quite see the rope touch the ground at the bottom but I was confident I had enough length to make it in one pitch (which was the only option). After a few shakes, the rest of the rope flaked through the imperfect rock. I tied in, checked my carabiners and tested my prusik. All good.

My novice shown through in my shoddy abseil. I hadn‚Äôt secured myself before casting the rope down, my prussik had too many wraps, and my rope was tangled halfway down which I had to reconcile while hanging off the edge with my steel crampons against the bare rock of the small overhang. My descent was anything but smooth, minding the prussik and feeding the rope, I inched down in a jerky, unrefined manner.

Back at the refuge, I remained the only guest. ‚ÄúWell, this just might not happen‚Äù I admitted discouragingly. I ate my cold dinner of trail mix and hydrated for tomorrow. I facetimed a couple of other friends to get their opinions about what I already knew was the right answer. My friend Will and my girlfriend Emily both have the pedigree and the sensibility to point out a bad idea when they see it.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go alone,‚Äù

‚Äúthe mountain will always be there.‚Äù

One of the most important signs of maturity in the mountains is knowing when to call it. I knew this well, but putting it into practice requires great discipline.

The full moon fully illuminated the east face of the mountain. It was a brilliant sight. ‚ÄúWow, really good ‚Äúlume‚Äù tonight‚Äù I commented, adding to my false sense of confidence about route finding in the dark.

I set my alarm for 3:15am, plugged my phone and Garmin Inreach Mini into my Nitecore NB1000 power bank and went to sleep, waking every couple of hours with excitement and apprehension. When my cell phone signaled official start of my day, I woke up feeling alert but did not rush to put my gear on. Nobody had arrived at the shelter that night. I was still alone which I had resolved to be a no go for this mountain. I spent some time on MountainProject and SummitPost reading trip reports and stories of people soloing the Matterhorn. I wanted any reason to think that it was still possible even though I new it was not. I wasn‚Äôt THAT stupid.

At 4:17am I was standing on the balcony looking up at a beautiful lenticular cloud over the summit backlit by the full moon. ‚ÄúToday is not the day‚Äù I said aloud. Just then, I saw two headlamps starting up the route‚Ä¶..

In a completely reactive and impulsive shift, I raced inside, packed my gear and threw on my harness as fast as I could. One more check: puffy, BD leather gloves, Glove liners, OR Firebrand gloves, Rab Vapour Rise Gloves, Headlamp, backup headlamp, Garmin Inreach, 2.5l of water, rope, 4 locking carabiners, prussik, belay device, 2 slings, cordalette, eye protection, 1,200 calories, electrolytes, crampons, Camp Corsa Ice Axe, Proton FL, Alpha FL, Mammut alpha fleece, boots, GOOD TO GO.

I turned off the lights and charged out and down the ladder of the refuge and hastily hit the route. I moved swiftly over the terrain I had covered less than 12 hours before. I hit the end of my previous recon and started following a broken but fresh bootpack through the maze. I knew this winding section would have its surprises and question marks. But between boot marks in patches of snow, cairns and a few blazes, I tore through what many call the crux of the Hornligrat. There would be harder climbing farther up, but I found myself standing upon the true ridgeline feeling very proud. The two headlamps I pursued had not gained any distance over me and I called out with a clich√© ‚Äúyewww!‚Äù which was reciprocated with a classic European ‚Äúhallo!‚Äù There were three of us on the mountain.

I closed the gap and caught up with the two climbers after about 40 minutes of some of the most fun climbing/scrambling I had ever done. I navigated the freaking lower Matterhorn at night by myself, which was both concerning and emboldening. We exchanged the typical hi‚Äôs and hello‚Äôs and ‚Äúwhere are you from‚Äôs‚Äù and they suggested I go around them. ‚ÄúI was hoping we could climb together‚Äù I proposed; this was the only way I would advance any further up the mountain. ‚ÄúOkay‚Äù replied Slawek, the only English speaker of this Polish Climbing Duo. The response was a bit hesitant at first, then enthusiastic as he realized it might be good to have one more person on the team. I caught up with them so they knew I wouldn‚Äôt slow them down. They had started from Zermatt at 10:00 the night before. Eastern Europeans sure have an affinity for pain and suffering‚Ä¶

When I reached them, they had arrived at a bit of a crux where we couldn‚Äôt exactly get over a modest overhang of jagged rock. Where a guide would have been invaluable, the Polacks decided to rappel down onto the east face and skirt around this section. My new companions sure seemed competent and experienced, they swiftly placed a rappel on some old existing rope anchors. As they descended the reduced contrast of their headlamps against the navy blue sky made for an epic sight.

The horizon was just starting to show faint signs of an orange hue as night gave way to morning. It was both a relief and a concern to me. Routefinding would be much easier but I knew as soon as the east face was exposed to the suns heat, the threat of rockfall would make our climb increasingly perilous.

We were now on the lower mosely slab, inching our way up toward the Solvay hut which was now in view. Our first refuge since we began nearly three hours earlier. We were moving slowly. Kamil, the other Polish climber was clearly running on reserves already as he had lugged a 65m rope up from the valley floor in his 50L Gregory Alpinisto. The rappel and several pauses cost us precious time as 2 hours is the standard to reach the Solvay.

I was leading the route for a good half hour while my companions followed behind. We had some good conversation to supplement the of handrailing a ridgeline. They asked me what I thought about US politics, and the state of the world. I replied that things could be better and they could be worse. We live in crazy times but so did our fathers and our grandfathers. ‚ÄúThat is why I come to the mountains, none of that shit matters up here‚Äù I said. To that, we were all in agreement.

We were probably ten minutes from Solvay. Our time had just eclipsed 3 hours, which by my calculations, we still had 9 hours of climbing to do. The sun had fully illuminated the east face and we paused on the top of the ridge to shed a layer. It was probably 45 degrees F and getting warmer. Mountain forecast predicted a freezing line above 11,000ft. I would have preferred it ten or fifteen degrees colder to keep the rocks firm. Wind was minimal, 5-10mph from the north.

We were all ready for a snack. Moving as swiftly as we could, we skirted over to the east face again for a clearer line to the high alpine hut. I was feeling good. Kicking my steps into the hardened snow I squared my body to the face and secured myself with both hands to a dresser-sized chunk of rock.

Earlier that morning I had read a trip report of a soloist who climbed the Matterhorn and met a team of Spanish climbers at the top. On their descent, one of the Spaniards slipped and fell off the east face tumbling all to the valley floor 7,000ft below. The author noted the unfathomable speed at which the climber fell, how he must have instantly died upon his first impact with the massive wall of rock and ice.

I pulled myself upward and felt the large rock move and fall apart, crumbling like a Nature Valley bar in my hands as gravity took hold of both of us.

‚ÄúShit, SHIT ITS HAPPENING‚Äù I thought as I tried to jump off to the side. To no avail, I was now tomahawking down a 5,000ft cheese grater. For a split second I was facing down slope. I could see all the way to the bottom and I knew that if I did not stop NOW, I was not going to stop. By an act of god, I reached out and took hold of my mothers hand that was outstretched. She was going to kill me if I died up here. I held on for dear life as the falling rock pounded my body, beckoning me to take the ride of my life.

As quickly as it began, it stopped. The rocks continued falling all the way down to the valley below. I lay there propped against the side of the mountain with my right leg while I could feel that my left leg swung limply. I looked down between my feet into infinity. I called out to my companions ‚Äúmy leg is broken!‚Äù I looked down and tried to sit up blood spurted from my arm ‚Äúoh god, im going to bleed out and fall again‚Äù I tried my best to bend my elbow and try to stop wherever the bleeding was coming from. It seemed to work. My adrenaline was in overdrive and I reached for my Garmin and without hesitation flipped the cover to the SOS button and held it. The Garmin sprang to life, executing the most important task for which it was built, for which those 3.4oz are worth their weight in gold.

With the medevac now in motion, ‚ÄúMy leg and my arm are broken!‚Äù I called repeatedly to my partners who were out of ¬†my line of sight. My voice suppressed by shock and adrenaline. Slawek arrived alarmed but maintained his composure. Despite the language barrier, he assessed my alertness and began treating the open wound on my arm. He cut open the sleeve of my precious Mammut Aenergy Air Light ML (my favorite fleece layer) and found a gash just above my elbow. It appeared to be a compound fracture with how much blood was gushing from it. ‚ÄúYour arm is broken‚Äù he said as he went into triage mode.

He helped remove my pack and asked where my medical kit was. ‚ÄúTie me in, tie me in‚Äù I kept saying. I could feel myself weakening as my adrenaline levels began to head back toward to baseline. ‚ÄúWe have to call for rescue‚Äù said Slawek. ‚ÄúI already did‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúYou did??‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, with my Garmin on my pack.‚Äù Slawek seemed both impressed and relieved that I had already called it in before he got down to me. ‚ÄúGood, rescue on the way.‚Äù

My red, .6L Sea to Summit medical kit had some but not all of what I needed. After dressing the wound on my arm, He wrapped me in my emergency blanket. He had to use his own gauze wrap to secure it to my arm. I also took two of the pain pills I had gotten in Nepal. No idea what they were or if they even worked. I think they were ibuprofen.

My phone started ringing. I ignored the first call. My Garmin made another noise. Then another vibration in my pocket. I struggled to unzip my right pant pocket and get my phone out both due to my contorted position against the steep rock and my harness over my pocket. I pulled my phone out and answered the southern woman on the other end. ‚ÄúThis is Garmin Emergency Services, Where are you and what is your emergency?‚Äù she asked in a seemingly nonchalant way. ‚ÄúWhy was she not more concerned?‚Äù I asked myself, ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt she know I am hanging off the side of a cliff with a broken leg about to fall to my death? This lady in Alabama has definitely never seen a mountain.‚Äù It‚Äôs strange where your mind goes when it is flooded with chemicals. Slawek kept repeating our elevation from his watch to the woman on the phone. They had my coordinates from the Garmin‚Äôs GPS feature and she indicated that rescue would be on their way. Now, the waiting game.

Tie me in I said again to Slawek. He took my rope from the top of my pack and passed it up to Kamil who set an anchor while tying an 8 on a bight into my belay loop. For once, I felt like I might actually survive this ordeal. The warm morning sun shown upon us and things felt peaceful. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm alive.‚Äù

My phone rang.

‚ÄúDad Facetime‚Äù

I answered, his screen was dark; it was 3am in Alton, NH.

‚ÄúWhat happened boy?‚Äù he asked in his typical ‚Äúwhy did you wake me up, but what‚Äôs wrong‚Äù type of way.

I didn‚Äôt remember calling him.

‚ÄúYour Garmin Emergency signal notified me.‚Äù

In a labored but concise way I told him ‚ÄúI fell and broke my leg, emergency services are on their way. This is bad, but I am alive.‚Äù

‚ÄúOhhhhh boy.‚Äù He was audibly concerned but knew time was precious. ‚ÄúCall me when you can‚Äù he said.

We hung up and I snapped back to the reality that I was hanging off side of one of the most extreme mountains in Europe.

‚ÄúYes, you are the most lucky. You should have fallen all the way. You are strong, helicopter will come soon.‚Äù Said Slawek, who, at this point was flabberghasted that he was still speaking with me. By all accounts I should have fallen all the way to the glacier below, torn to pieces by the unforgiving steep rock walls like the Spaniard I had read about earlier that morning. I was not going out that way.

At this point I began to take an inventory. My left femur, snapped in two. My left arm, most likely a compound fracture. My left rib, probably cracked. My right leg, banged up, but okay. My right arm, okay. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt good‚Äù I thought. ‚ÄúBut I am alive.‚Äù

I felt tired. I wanted to go to sleep, but I know I needed to stay awake and alert. 10 minutes had passed. No helicopter. ‚ÄúYou are very lucky, helicopter coming. Slawek repeated. He asked me to take his number down to inform him when I made it to the hospital. I don‚Äôt know if this was just classic Eastern European form to ignore the pain or if he was really trying to keep me alert. I was banged up. I put all of my attention into recording his number in my phone both to stay alert and to test my resolve after the most traumatic fall of my life. My hands shook a bit but I was surprised I entered his number into my iphone notes on the first try. I was also surprised my new iphone was still in tact. Glad I got that screen protector on my way to the airport a week earlier.

The ambient sounds of the wind and the Zermatt Valley gave way to the classic sound of a helicopter rotors in the distance. It grew increasingly louder until the Air-Zermatt rescue team crested the Hornli ridge and erupted in crescendo as it stopped and hovered off the east face in front of us. They found us.

The helicopter pulled back, dipping sharply down and away and disappeared. ‚ÄúWhere are they going?‚Äù I thought as I felt myself sink deeper toward what would become shock. They were dropping a litter team at the Hornli Hut. About 8 minutes later, the helicopter returned, this time in full force, arcing and straffing the east face. I could see a rescue team member hanging off the side of the chopper ready to drop.

I felt a disorienting blast of rotor wash as the chopper hovered directly over us, I had to close my eyes. It inched closer toward the sun-warmed gneiss wall 10-15m upslope form us and lowered the rescue operator down. Feet touched down, cable disconnected and the helicopter once again pulled away to allow the man to do his thing.

‚ÄúBroken leg, arm and rib‚Äù Slawek called out in his thick Polish accent. ‚ÄúWe can help you.‚Äù

I was neither alert enough nor could I hear what the german-speaking operator was saying. He seemed to ignore Slawek and simply spoke into his headset while he began securing me and evaluating the damage.

He began talking to me, at this point things were getting fuzzy. For some reason all I could think about what how fucking high speed this guy was. Like, textbook sweep you off your feet, pararescue shit. His helmet/headset/goggles-on-helmet combination and Mission Impossible shades immediately said this guy was in charge. His full Mammut guide gear and Norwand boots completed the look. I was gonna be okay.

He reached into his chest rig and pulled out a syringe with a cone on it. ‚ÄúIs that Morphine‚Äù I asked? ‚ÄúNo, this is fentanyl.‚Äù he replied in a thick accent. My eyes widened ‚Äúwas I in that bad of shape?‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good shit, Dylan‚Äù Slawek remarked. I laughed to myself a bit. This situation seemed so absurd.

‚ÄúWe are going to give you this in your nose, both sides. 2-3 minutes and you will feel nothing. Then the helicopter will come with the cable, I will cut your rope and we go.‚Äù

I was hesitant about taking the drugs. I have been sober since July 8^(th), 2022 and knew this was the opposite of that. Did I need it? Yes, my femur is broken. ‚ÄúThis doesn‚Äôt count!‚Äù I said to myself as I took the nasal injection. My nose dripped at the unfamiliar but potent mix of compounds entering my nervous system. I knew that hanging from my harness with my bones tearing into my quad was not going to be pleasant.

The helicopter made another round and slowly approached with a brightly colored cable. Slawek readied my pack and gave it to the operator who attached it to his harness. He reached for the industrial steel clip and tied the two of us in, the edges of my vision were growing dark.

I looked over at Kamil and Slawek in a last effort to say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù gave them the classic metal \\m/ horns and stuck my tongue out to let them know I would be okay. Lift off.

I expected nothing but pain. But the precision of my rescuer proved spot on. I didn‚Äôt feel my leg too bad, but my harness was pinching my junk in the most uncomfortable way. I reached up and grabbed the carabiners above my head to try to relieve some of the pressure on my nuts. A blast of frigid wind overtook my senses as we cleared the Hornli ridge, exposed to the northerly winds at 13,000ft. I couldn‚Äôt breathe. It was like being on top of a car speeding down the freeway in the middle of winter. I was going to die of hypothermia before anything else. I was only wearing my Mammut alpha fleece and my softshell sidezips were open. Was this real?

I forced myself to look up and take in the moment. I was dangling below a helicopter with this sexy as fuck rescue dude with nothing but Swiss Alps 5,000ft below me. I gave one last look at the Matterhorn glowing in the golden morning sunlight. The moment didn‚Äôt last long. I succumbed to the frigid wind and tucked my head away again. Everything about this moment was far more violent than the serene Paragliding I had done with my brothers 22hours ago.

We breached a thermocline and the wind dissipated, I looked up as we were nearing the Hornli Hut where I saw two more rescue team with a litter ready to receive me. I gathered all of my strength in preparation for our landing. The dexterity and precision of the Air-Zermatt Pilots was a thing of beauty. They could have steeped a bag of earl grey in a porcelain teacup. That‚Äôs how good they were. The best in the world.

The landing was soft and smooth and I was able to stick the landing on my right foot. My rescuer detached our cables and signaled all clear. The helicopter pulled away again relieving us of the down blast from the rotors.

Another team member came over and they began helping me over to the litter. I knew what was coming. Changing my orientation to gravity was going to be painful. Fentanyl or not. We tried once and I recoiled in pain. We readjusted and I nodded to the guys that I was ready. They lowered me down and I screamed with everything I had in me. The jagged bone of my upper femur piercing into the mangled tissue of my inner quadricep.

I lay still and limp. Darkness took me. I looked over to see one of the men injecting something into my arm. BLAST OFF.

My soul left my body and went into the ether. On another fractal plane of serenity and turmoil, I was adrift. Physical matter did not exist only the death and rebirth of whisps and phantoms that walked me through my life as I began an inventory of my life‚Äôs decisions. Where was I. Was this the end? I tried to rationalize. Tried to connect what I was familiar with to what I saw in front of me. Nothing. I had transcended the metaphysical into the purely ethereal. Beyond the spiritual. I had arrived at the source. Nothing else existed. Time vanished. One.

Indescribable entities, forces from another realm coaxed me along. Explaining to me the very fabric of existence. Truths that defy laws of the most complex science and mathematics. It was not even describable by the definitions of who, what, when, where , why or how. I was being absorbed into what simply IS.

Perhaps I was witnessing what happens at a quantum level. Outside of the confines of time. Only everything felt huge, yet nothing at all. It neither was nor wasn‚Äôt. This was another realm entirely. Accessible only through death and complete departure of what we know on our finite plane of existence. I was at the source.

People talk about this sort of thing happening during a DMT trip or a k hole. People also hint to it when approaching death. To get here requires a dramatic and painful break from our reality.

I was under attack. An assault against which I was unable to defend. I couldn‚Äôt move, couldn‚Äôt cry for help. I could not see. I had not the desire or awareness to. I was punching through to the next level of consciousness. I had died and was being reborn from the shards of my past self. The physical sensations my body was feeling were not translating from my nervous system to my soul. I was still adrift but aware of the membrane, the veil between my body and soul rejoining as a human.

Thoughts were becoming more and more congruent. I knew something had happened. ¬†

I had an oxygen mask over my face. A paramedic hovered over me working on me, though I didn‚Äôt know what exactly. The bumpy helicopter ride shook me as I broke through to the next level of consciousness. I was aware but still unable to respond to external stimuli. I completely submitted to whatever was going to happen. It was out of my hands. In and out I drifted. I opened my eyes and looked around, then faded back out in exhaustion.

People gathered around me, dashing about while voices shouted orders and others responded in french. A new environment engulfed me, different than earlier but not unfamiliar. I had been here before. When I was 7, I fell off a chairlift skiing with my dad. The feeling racing through corridors on a hospital bed with harsh lights was something my body knew.

‚ÄúBonjour!‚Äù I called out to everyone. ‚ÄúI am tripping balls!, high as fuck!‚Äù I heard some of the medical staff laugh. I mumbled some things in broken French. No idea if I said anything coherent. But I was comforted knowing I would be able to communicate with people.

Like a blackout, the memory of events at the hospital is blurry. I spent time on one room, they cut my Mammut softshell pants and top layers off me. IV lines extended out from both arms and hands. Electrodes dotted my chest and head. Medical equipment beeped and personnel raced around.

A blonde nurse caught my eye. I was looking at a tattoo of a flower on her arm as she worked on me. ‚ÄúJ‚Äôaime la fleur‚Äù I said. I probably sounded like a drunken scoundrel at the bar.

‚ÄúWhere are my things‚Äù I thought? ‚ÄúI need to call my family.‚Äù

A nurse brought me a phone that I didn‚Äôt recognize. A hospital landline. On the other end was my mom and brother Cam. I was quite inebriated still and don‚Äôt remember the specifics of our call, but I reassured them that despite my injuries, I was going to be okay and that I would call them when I could.

I somehow received a call from my girlfriend Emily as well. We spoke and I told her ‚Äúyou were right. I messed up.‚Äù In my own character, I cracked a few jokes about not being able to ski or bang for a while to try to cheer her up. But the situation was definitely serious.

I waited for what felt like hours and hours to be admitted for surgery. They were going to put a rod in my leg to fuse my femur back together. They said it could be in 20 minutes or it could take hours for the surgeon and anesthesiologists to be available. I didn‚Äôt go in until after 8:00 that night. Nearly 12 hours since my accident.

They had me pretty doped up and time passed quickly. Spending an entire day with a broken leg is not my idea of a good time. Several times I looked down to see my leg completely turned to the side. The side of my foot laying flat against the bed. I tried myself to prop it up (NOT recommended). My muscles were sore and I lay there helplessly.

I got my phone and pack back-somehow- and made a quick Instagram/Facebook story letting my people know that I had an accident and broke my femur, that my ski season was over but that I was grateful to be alive. Re-watching it, I was definitely high as shit when I recorded it, but it made sense. An outpouring of support and friends asking how I was flooded in. This really got me through that first and second day.

All I felt was gratitude. Gratitude that I had the opportunity to climb with such awesome dudes, gratitude that I had that experience, gratitude that I was alive, gratitude for my friends and family.

It has been a week since I arrived at the hospital. I am able to walk up and down stairs with crutches. I am able to got to the bathroom and shower by myself. It could be a lot worse. My leg is broken but my brain still works good and my heart is full.

My roommate in the hospital for the first few days, Alexandre, a French Paraglider my age helped me through the next phase. We talked about our accidents in each others languages. I practiced French, he practiced English. We exchanged chocolates. And had coffee together. We watched the sun hit the mountains across the valley in the mornings and watched the skies at sunset. I had a lot to be grateful for.

The road to recovery will be a long one. 4-6 months before I will regain full function. PT 3-4 times per week. No driving for 3 months. No work for at least 6 weeks. I will have plenty of time to evaluate and explore other areas of my life that I had not made time for while I was out chasing mountains every day. I was crushing it on the Matterhorn, but my inexperience and the natural dangers of the mountain had other plans for me. I have a brand new ski quiver that will collect dust this winter, but perhaps in the late season I may be able to try some Nordic skiing. I am not sure what the future holds, but I know that I have a second chance at life and I will not waste it. Neither should you.

‚ÄúThis body holding me reminds me of my own mortality

Embrace this moment, remember

We are eternal, all this pain is an illusion.‚Äù

See end of text for specs :)

I got the apple watch Series 10 as soon as it came out, after never having owned any kind of apple watch before. 

I have ADHD and I've always had a huge amount of trouble managing my life and taking care of myself. I would always survive the day haphazardly, but I couldn't really keep track of anything‚Äì‚Äì it was impossible to keep track of time, make sure I'm well rested, remember to take my meds, avoid becoming dehydrated, and have any consistent awareness of whether I'm properly active or way too sedentary. Now that I have this thing on my wrist all the time, I can absolutely do all of that without crap-shooting or guessing or forgetting, and it's just an incredible relief.

Before the watch, I scraped by pretty well using iCal religiously (which I still do) and using timers constantly (like, almost every single moment of the day) to remember what I'm even supposed to be doing and how much time I have left before I need to switch tasks (or, like, to avoid being late to an appointment, etc.). But it was always really frustrating to have to make sure my stupid iPhone was in my pocket every single moment of the day‚Äì‚Äì whenever I needed to start a timer, check my existing timers, check my calendar, set/check an alarm, add something to my to-do list, or cross something off of it, I had to go find my phone, pick it up, unlock it, find the app I was looking for, add my thing, and then have the willpower to put it back in my pocket instead of doomscrolling or lollygagging on it. Now, I just talk to my wrist for one second (I turned off the ""Listen for Siri/Hey Siri"" feature and instead just hold down the crown to talk to Siri) and it's done. I can manage my calendar, the weather, my activity/steps, the time, my current timers, my hydration, my alarms (including tomorrow's wake-up alarm), last night's sleep, my texts, my calls, my emails (can't write emails on the watch lol but I can see the preview of every email and get each new notification), my meds, my countdowns, my battery, the notifications I set to pop up on the watch, and more, in one second, without any chance of falling down an ADHD rabbit hole like I would on my phone. It's just awesome.

Here are some apps I highly recommend specifically for apple watch use:

* [AntBrowser](https://antbrowser.app/) \- a straight-up browser because apple doesn't give you a browser for some reason; this one's great, it's a one-time purchase (like $5 or something) that goes directly to the actual single person who created it literally because they just wanted it to exist. plus the app appears towards the top of your app menu because it starts with ""A"" lol
* [Countdown](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/countdown/id1403367428) \- lets you set lots of countdowns with correlating emojis & set complications on the watch face AND on the stack for whichever events you want. well-designed and cute. also has cute widgets on the iPhone
* [WaterLlama](https://waterllama.com/) \- for staying hydrated. functions beautifully on apple watch; pre-set your usual beverages and quantities on the iPhone app & then easily log them on the watch whenever you finish a drink. this helps me so much cuz it's not JUST about water; I log whenever I drink anything‚Äì‚Äì coffee, tea, etc.‚Äì‚Äì and it automatically takes into account how hydrating that particular beverage actually is, like how coffee/tea are slightly less hydrating than the equivalent amount of water. for another example, I'm sober, but if I hypothetically logged that I drank a glass of wine, it'd automatically take into account that wine is DEhydrating, and it'd tell me how much more I need to drink to reach my hydration goal for the day. kinda hard to explain but it's so awesome. also has iPhone widgets
* [Pedometer++](https://pedometer.app/) \- lets you view your steps progress as a complication or shortcut on the stack. also has iPhone widgets
* Spotify (duhr) - you can download playlists/albums/etc. from your watch directly ,or you can literally direct Spotify to download playlists/albums/etc. *to your watch* FROM your iPhone spotify app (I think in the ""..."" menu it pops up as ""Download to apple watch""). of course you can stream Spotify without doing this but it saves data if you go on a walk and listen to music every day without your iPhone.
* [EcoBee](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ecobee/id916985674) \- if you have an EcoBee heater/AC/etc. device, it lets you see the current status of your selected device as a complication and manage it from the watch. also has iPhone widgets
* [Citymapper](https://citymapper.com/?lang=en) \- for getting around without a car! also has iphone widgets
* [AnyList](https://www.anylist.com/) ‚Äì amazing all-around app for lists, especially for totally integrated grocery list and meal planning and recipes, I use it every single day; it also works very well with Alexa, just say ""Alexa, ask Anylist to add \_\_\_\_\_ to \[name of list\]"" - siri will also cooperate but I think you have to say ""Siri, in the AnyList app, add \_\_\_\_ to \[name of list\]"" lol. also has iphone widgets

# MY APPLE WATCH SPECS:

* Model: Series 10, 42mm, jet black aluminium with cellular data
   * I highly recommend getting cellular data; it lets me roam freely/safely in the world without my iphone. worth the extra cost and the extra cellular data charge which is about $10 a month. Also, jet black looks beautiful (I literally can't tell where the screen begins and the aluminium ends). and 42mm is perfect for my dainty wrist lol
* [LK Screen protector](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DHSPYTYC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) 
   * to prevent scratches; the watch didn't get scratched before I added the protector‚Äì‚Äì in fact it seems very scratch-resistant‚Äì‚Äì but the protector gives me peace of mind and I literally can't even tell it's on there, it's totally invisible and flat and smooth. this photo of my watch makes it seem like it looks pixelated thru the screen protector, but that only manifests through the camera lens lol, it does not look pixelated at all in real life
* [Lake Green Sport Loop](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MXL23AM/A/42mm-lake-green-sport-loop?fnode=e3414653593d32c41638b6f10f6a6ce504732e3d6ca65b5d4affd423ccf2116313b8a6bc02e4c6395bea01efc22b06d9a1b14570f59c31c8d4a77e445101251b7f308f29c66b1185e44745fd4680bf5104dcd8f6e2555f5475380f5b1e9b383b) \- very comfortable for daily wear, day and night
* Watch face: INFOGRAPH (my favorite watch face cuz it lets you do the most complications!!)
   * My complications (clockwise starting at top left): 
      1. **iCal** \- I can click it to open the app and see/edit my whole calendar
      2. [**TimeGlance** \- HIGHLY recommend this app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/timeglance-complication/id1531068181) \- it adds a complication that is just the current digital time; you can do 24H, add AM/PM, etc. & you can customize the color of the time itself & the optional progress bar underneath
      3. **Weather / Temperature** \- daily low/high + current temp, plus I can click 
      4. **Next Alarm** \- I can click it to open the app and adjust my morning alarm
      5. **Timer** \- when I set a timer, or multiple timers, it shows the minutes+seconds countdown to the most-nearly-done timer. Plus, if you set it using siri and tell it what to call the timer, the timer app will show you what each timer's for. I use this a million times a day to steep my tea lol
      6. **Activity** \- including numeral details, above the rings
      7. **Watch battery**
      8. [WaterLlama](https://waterllama.com/) \- to stay hydrated (see my rant above for further explanation lol)

In 2019 when I was working at the office, this girl at work would wait at the hallway for me to leave and walk passed her and would make it clearly obvious she wanted to talk to me and she was interested.

It was almost everyday she would wait for me in the hallway.

I kept thinking ‚ÄúI work with her I shouldn‚Äôt speak to her because it could be problematic‚Äù.
I was so stupid. She‚Äôs beautiful, and has a good sense of humor (from what I noticed in the hallway).


Now, we are having a company wide meeting this week and it‚Äôs mandatory to go‚Ä¶ I am hoping and praying that I see her again.

It‚Äôs on Thursday and I hope she didn‚Äôt get laid off from the company and still works here‚Ä¶ if she does I‚Äôm going to approach her and talk to her. I just wish I did it earlier!!!!!!!!

This all hangs in that she shows up to this meeting.

Any advice on what to say? Should I ignore that I blew her off? 

Should I just say ‚Äúhey I thought you were cute could I get your number?‚Äù

I‚Äôm developing a platform that lets your customers create a personalized coffee subscription directly with your shop, and it‚Äôs totally free for you. We make a small cut from each subscription fee ‚Äî so you keep more of your revenue.

Here‚Äôs the Idea:

	1.	Customizable Based on Habits: Customers enter how many drinks they typically enjoy per week and the type of drinks they prefer (e.g., basic drip, lattes, or specialty brews). The platform then shows them the cost with vs. without a subscription, making it easy to see the savings.
	2.	Tailored Pricing & Perks: You set the subscription tiers that match your menu and customer habits. For example, someone could get unlimited drip coffee, discounted specialty drinks, or exclusive perks like free refills or priority seating.
	3.	Add-On Premium Benefits: On top of drink savings, customers can unlock additional benefits. This could include discounts on pastries, early access to new items, or even an occasional free drink ‚Äî giving them even more reasons to come back regularly.

Why Customers Love It:
They get real savings on their regular orders, plus extra perks. By subscribing, they feel connected to your shop and get value from their subscription in a way that aligns with their coffee habits.

What‚Äôs In It for You?
This is a no-cost solution that brings you loyal, recurring customers without requiring you to build anything yourself. The tool makes subscriptions simple and valuable, creating consistent revenue while helping retain your regulars and attract new ones.

Would you consider a platform like this? Does it sound like a valuable addition to your coffee shop? Any feedback would be amazing!

1gj0ysc,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoverPetSitting/comments/1gj0ysc/sitter_lost_my_cat/,Sitter lost my cat,"Apologies, this is long because there is a lot of  details.. 
I hired a house sitter from Rover to look after my 3 pets (2 cats and a dog) over my wedding weekend because all my close family and friends that I would usually ask to sit would be at the wedding. Our rehearsal dinner was on halloween and our wedding the next day on November 1st.
He had a reasonable rate, and good reviews so we scheduled a meeting and greet. He was kind, respectful, asked lots of questions, and the animals seemed to take to him quickly.
We went over the routine with the animals, showed him where the litter boxes were and how to scoop them, where he could sleep, and let him know we would be leaving at 10 on Thursday morning for our wedding rehearsal and thats when he should be there. we even let him know he was welcome to the snacks in the cupboard and left a $30 cash tip for Uber since he didn't have a car. 
We also told him that we sometimes let the cats out, but only under supervision so they don't climb the fence. 1 cat knows how, the other has not figured it out and prefers to be at ground level. I did mention that it would probably be better to keep them inside, but if they get out its easy to grab them and bring them back in since they mainly like to roll around and eat grass. I thought the visit went well.

When the day came, 10 o'clock came and went and we ended up leaving at 10:30. I let him know where our key was, and he claimed he thought we meant 10 pm. He came over later and began sending me nice updates throughout the day. I let him know that since it was halloween, he is welcome to hand out the candy we left at the door otherwise he could just leave it outside.

One of the updates was with pictures of the cats laying outside in the sun. I reminded him to keep a very close eye on them because one especially likes to climb the fence. I later reminded him we never let them out at night. I was slightly bothered by this. But I was busy with other things and I figured I made it clear they need supervision so I trusted he would be ok.

We did all our rehearsal stuff and had a great time.  We were getting ready for bed since our wedding was the next day, when I saw he had texted another update. This is where he said one of our cats had gone missing. I immediately called and he explained that while he was busy with trick or treaters, he thought it'd be ok to let the cats out in the back. He had left the back door open, while attending to the front door.

So now its halloween, my wedding is in less than 24 hours, my all black cat is missing, its almost midnight, and I'm an hour away.

As you can imagine, this is not the news I wanted the night before my wedding. I told him all the tricks to attracting cats and waited for what I hoped would be a good update. He assured me he would look everywhere and would even stay up all night if he had to. He seemed very apologetic and I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. After an hour and no good news, I decided I needed to go home and help look. So me, my fiance, and our best man and maid of honor got in the car and drove the hour back home at arrived at about 12 am. I called in the house a few times, got no answer, and started looking around for my missing cat. 

I discovered our sitter asleep on the guest room bed. He had just woken up and seemed VERY out of it. So much for ""staying up all night to look"". I told him I dont really trust him to keep looking after my other pets and I have made other arrangements. I told him respectfully to please leave. At this point it I had already had a meltdown, called rover customer service, and animal control.
My group then looked around the neighborhood calling for my cat for over 2 hours before we made a quick poster, put a few up in the immediate area. We didn't get back to the wedding venue until 4 am where we then had about 3 hours of sleep before needing to be up to start getting ready for the wedding.

While we were at my house, I noticed several strange things.
1. He had left out leftovers from the fridge on the counter and had spilled some on the counter, and they had been partially eaten. The containers were warm, so they had been sitting there a while. I had offered the snacks in the cupboard, but didnt say anything about the fridge since he had told me he'd probably get food out
2. There was wet food spread on top of the dry food in the dry food dish, rather than the designated wet food dish we showed him.  
3. There was milk left in the wet food dish, which was also warm and had been sitting there a while. 4. This explains the cat vomit i found in the basement with a paper towel stuck to it. Instead of cleaning it up, he put a paper towel on it and left it to dry.
5. There were empty chip bags all over the coffee table in the basement.
6. The basement smelled strongly of Marijuana. 
7. All 3 exterior doors had been left unlocked when we arrived home.
8. Both back gates to the yard had been left open. I suspect if they were shut, my cat would have stayed inside of the yard, because the one who knows how to climb the fence was safe inside.

I also spoke to my neighbor and she said she saw a black cat in her driveway at about 7pm, which is several hours before when the sitter told me my cat went missing, and even longer before he informed me. So I know he lied to me about the timing.

All this to say, I do not appreciate the disrespect he has shown my house and the lack of care to my pets he was entrusted to keep safe. I won't be using Rover again.",33,1730677920.0,RoverPetSitting,34,0.92,False

There's a Starbucks right near our house, it's like a 4-6 minute walk depending on traffic. We live outside a small city; not a well-off area, but not particularly bad either.

The past couple days I've been walking there in the morning when they first open (7AM) to get a coffee; I've been telling my mom I'll be doing this the night before since she isn't up that early. Usually in the morning I drink a coffee then immediately take a short nap, because I've found that's the best way to wake myself up.

Yesterday morning, my mom woke up while I was taking said nap, and immediately ran into my bedroom to check if I got home and ask if I was okay. She's now insisting that I need to text her whenever I walk to Starbucks; when I get there, when I leave to go home, and when I get home; so she knows that I got there and back safely and didn't get hit by a car or something. I told her that I felt like that was excessive, and that I felt like it was pointless to text her at all; it takes me 15 minutes to get there and back, and I'm 2 rooms away from her once I get home. She disagreed and told me I couldn't keep walking there unless I did.

For context, I do have ADD, and when I was younger I had a hard time paying attention when crossing the street. I haven't had that problem in years at this point, though, and I literally spend part of my day working in a parking lot now where I've never had an issue.

Thanksgiving holiday is probably the most extreme example. Typically I'll weigh myself the day before to get a baseline and I'll show like 191 lbs (for example) on the scale, then the day after Thanksgiving I'll weigh myself again and notice I'm ""suddenly"" 197-198 lbs üòÇ

So besides the obvious one of coffee/caffeine, what are some other supplements for clearing out this nuisance water weight?

So the beginning of September my ex and I ‚Äúmutually‚Äù ended things. She is severe DA, and I use to be secure, but throughout the relationship I became anxious. We loved eachother very much so the breakup was very abrupt. She said she felt like she couldn‚Äôt give me what I deserved or needed, when in reality it was everything I wanted. After splitting up she sent me a big text highlighting how sorry she was and the reason for his DA styles stems from her childhood. Fast forward, we meet a couple of times to actually talk. The 2 times we did meet in person, we talked for hours and hours and the relationship and came back to the same conclusion that we have things we need to heal if we wanted to get back together in the future. Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, I see her at the bar and we start to talk a little and get a little flirty. Before she leaves the bar we just give eachother a nice hug. She then pulls back and proceeds to grab my face and kiss me. It threw me in for a spin because I don‚Äôt know what it meant. She had voiced multiple times in our conversations that she still didn‚Äôt know if she made the right decision and is unsure at times. Now last weekend, it‚Äôs just eating at me and I have to know if the kiss meant anything more.

So the title says it. There was once this video I‚Äôm not sure where I saw it but I‚Äôm looking to see who can help get all.

I was watching this video where a guy was out at a coffee shop I believe with his friends riding their motorcycles enjoying the day. Then he gets a text or call from his wife saying she was going into labor. So he turns on his go pro and records his ride from the coffee shop all the way to the hospital. He‚Äôs lane splitting, going over the peed limit, etc. 

It felt invigorating watching, seeing a man make the ride on his sport bike to see his new born. The video was just absolutely amazing to me and made me feel a type of way.

If anyone could help me at all find this video I would appreciate it. I hope it‚Äôs still out there.",1,1730677021.0,tipofmytongue,2,1.0,False

Since I started my new job 1.5 years ago, I started dealing with some bad constipation issues which came and went randomly. Around May this year, it was the worst it had ever been. Although, it has never been due to hard stools in rectum, it has always felt like it has been something higher in the digestive tract somewhere, as the bowel movement coming out has always looked thin and lubricated. This is what I dealt with back in May:

* Extremely gassy farting non stop, very smelly
* A palms worth of poo coming out, usually darker brown in colour (but not black like dried blood)
* Never any bloody
* Endless wiping after every bowel movement, due to how soft the poo is
* The poo is thin-ish, but lubricated breaking apart from each other
* I thought it was due to gluten - cut it out and nothing happened
* Had every sort of bloody laxative there is, Movicol every day as doctor said and it literally just turned my poo in black, tar like sludge. And never felt full released, always felt full like nothing was coming out.
* Dealt with this for about 6 weeks until I eventually did a Colonoscopy which cleared me out - doctor found nothing

Then, I went to Bali with my wife and child (I live in cold Melbourne Australia). Within a day of being in bali, I was doing the most phenomenal bowel movements of my life - literally 30cm logs, barely any wiping needed, not farting, feeling absolutely fantastic. Few things out of this and my bali trip:

* Was drinking bottled water, no tap water
* Eating EVERYTHING no restrictions
* Was stress-less, having a great time
* warm weather
* walking a lot everyday and swimming
* Eggs, coffee and fruit every morning within 30mins of waking up (buffet food)

Came back to melbourne, and this continued on. All my depression from dealing with constipation was gone. I had a slight issue in with some difficult bowel movements a couple weeks later but this passed within a few days. I continued to eat eggs every morning with a coffee (where as before I would usually fast till 12pm), and was eating fruit for morning tea.   
  
For many months, I was good until 2 weeks ago where my issues have now come back (around the same time I got very ill with a flu), but not as bad as it was in May for those 6 weeks. I'm still trying to eat eggs most mornings, I have a coffee all mornings (which would usually trigger me to go and do a fantastic bowel movement), but I have cut out the fruit eating, which I am trying to bring back into my diet. Today I went after a bit of an urge to go (havnt had a strong urge for over 2 weeks), and again I had like 5 thin ribbon poo's, (lubricated not dry and hard or hurting my rectum), and thats it. I feel so full and bloated, there is so much more backed up in me.

I dont know if its to do with any of the following, which I have tried to nail it down to:

* Stress (new work stress)
* Barely any walking since I started at my new workplace (I drive in now rather than the train)
* Not eating fruits?
* Tap water?
* Red meat? (I need to try and cut out red meat perhaps for a whole week? I eat it maybe 3 times a week)
* Not enough walking? I gym with weights 4 times a week
* Weather related?
* Illness related? Could it be that I am getting these constipation or gut issues after an illness? This also goes in line with what I had in May, I was ill with a very bad flu around that time before that bad constipation period.
* Is it something to do with kick starting my metabolism?

  
I've been drinking prune juice every day for the last 2 weeks, I've tried Kefir all of last week, 4litres of water a day.

I thought it may have been IBS, but being in Bali throws that out of the window as I was eating every single type of food under the sun and had no issues.

I wasn't a coffee drinker before this at all and all I would normally drink was tea.

here they have an espresso machine and I started drinking 1 shot of espresso during day shifts and 3~4 per night shifts to keep myself up and going,  I have done 2 night and 2 day shifts so far and they werent back to back.

during the night shifts specifically I get these mild headaches that just escalate over time and calms back down to mild right after I drink  a shot of espresso(according to the machine each shot is 45mg) , I dont have this problem at home or during day shifts, should I stop drinking coffee altogether, reduce the amount I take or is this normal?

1gj0jug,https://www.reddit.com/r/algoween/comments/1gj0jug/a_timeless_gift/,A Timeless Gift ,"Long ago my Aunt Carol told me a story of how an unsuspecting helpful piece of technology changed her life for no good. For her birthday one year her husband and my Uncle Bill gifted her the new apple watch to help her keep track of exercise, her health, and daily tasks. Carol was a bit unsure at first and suspicious of the idea of strapping a miniature device to her body 24/7 and how that might be too much tech for her. Nevertheless she found the watch reminding her to meet her daily goals such as going to the gym at exactly 8 AM or displaying her directions to her favorite coffee shop she visited each morning. As the watch became attuned to her daily routines she too became attuned to checking her watch to see what she needed to do or where she needed to be next. 

One morning she woke up to complete silence, instead of her typical 6AM wake up alarm buzzing on her wrist. The watch was missing and she panicked. Hurriedly she searched throughout her room, under every piece of furniture and behind every item. The watch was absolutely nowhere to be seen. Defeated, she knew she needed to carry on with her day and move on to keep with the schedule of her daily routine. However, as she wracked her brain for where she needed to be next, she couldn't quite grasp the thought, it slipped her mind lost into the abyss. Carol realized she had not the slightest idea of what she needed to do she looked down to her wrist hoping for a message to remind her but the watch was gone and so was her consciousness it seemed. 

Carol rushed out the house hoping to clear her head. She spotted her neighbor Vanessa, ""Good morning Carol! I usually never see you out at this time of day, I'm glad you're doing better! It's all about baby steps."" Carol was puzzled as she didn't understand what she meant and struggled to find the words reply back. Vanessa returned with a warm smile and got into her car to pull out of her driveway. Carol even more confused and panicked than before, turned around to go back inside. She opened her door to see her living room almost unrecognizable, covered in what looked like month old wilted flower arrangements and unopened cards reading, ""My Greatest Condolences."" Flipping one of the cards open to read, ""I'm sorry for your loss, Bill was an amazing man.""

Essentially, I‚Äôm an aromatic bisexual chic looking for connection, friendship and companionship in forms outside of ‚Äútypical‚Äù romantic relationships. 

Something on the lines of a queer platonic relationship or deeper friendship(s) or a non romantic life partner. This type of companionship could look like a lot of different things, could be two people or more. I‚Äôm fairly open, the key point being that it‚Äôs not primarily romantic. 

I simply don‚Äôt have authentic desire for romantic intimacy. I like the idea of it; it‚Äôs cute to read about or see on TV, and I understand it on an intellectual level but I don‚Äôt feel romantic love or romantic attraction. And any attempts I‚Äôve made feel disingenuous and fake. 

However I do desire companionship, and interpersonal relationships. I‚Äôd love to have  a person (or people) to share life with, to  spend time with, to travel with and to have deep conversations with.  

I‚Äôm very drawn to sharing experiences and intellectual connections, and I do experience platonic and familial love. As I am bisexual, I also enjoy physical relationships as well, though this isn‚Äôt a requirement.

Probably also important to note that I do want a kid in the near-ish future. I‚Äôm exploring single motherhood options, but am also open to the possibility of finding someone to share all/part of that experience with. 

At this point I‚Äôm not really focused on location or age (just be over 21). Aesthetic attraction is kinda important, and of course physical attraction if it‚Äôs that type of relationship. No smokers, no hard drugs, no heavy drinkers. Kid friendly, dog friendly. Personality, shared interests and values are important. Also probably important to mention I live in a rural town in Colorado with  no immediate plans to change that. 

More about me- Gemini, INTJ, ADHD, very pragmatic, free spirited and independent. I value knowledge, curiosity and honesty. Travel is my biggest passion with 42 countries visited so far. I‚Äôm nerdy in a pop culture sort of way (MCU, HP, Star Wars) and I adore going to Disney theme parks. I‚Äôm into witchy things like tarot and crystals. I like to write, read and craft. I don‚Äôt go out much, and I pretty much loathe parties or small talk. I deal with some social anxiety, though weirdly being anonymous in a crowd doesn‚Äôt bother me. I like bookstores and coffee shops, the occasional museum or night out dancing. I rarely drink, dont smoke or do any type of drugs. Technically Christian but not practicing, more spiritual perhaps. Politically I‚Äôm somewhere between moderate and liberal but pretty much dislike anything political. I‚Äôm white, reddish hair, blue eyes, short and slim/average built. 

So, there‚Äôs the gambit. I know there‚Äôs other out there like me. Just finding something so likeminded can be tricky! But here‚Äôs to ",3,1730676110.0,R4R30Plus,1,0.72,False

I‚Äôm not asking for advice on how to write a novel, but I was curious about people‚Äôs opinions on what approach they used starting out. I sat in front of my computer last week and just started typing with really no idea what I was going to write about. The ‚Äòprologue‚Äô started with ‚ÄúIt was a day like any other: early to bed and early to rise, two pieces of toast and a black coffee that was bitter but essential. The same way a shot of strong whiskey can cause revulsion and incoming relief. The only difference today was the heightened anticipation Celia felt, the nervousness that affected her usual morning routine. The growing fear combined with a remote sense of hope that she was going to murder her husband‚Äù.

So basically I wrote this not setting out to write a suspense or horror novel, but I wanted to add a twist or ‚Äògotcha‚Äô moment within the first few lines and this is what I ended up with. From that, the outline of the first 2-3 chapters seemed to quickly formulate in my mind about the plot ie lonely girl in remote town meets and marries a serial killer or something similar. 

I can already see I‚Äôm using too many words to explain some detail which would be removed or revised in later drafts, but on the whole I‚Äôm enjoying the free writing or ‚Äòpantsing‚Äô, it feels very creative to just let it flow into the page so to speak. Putting ideas down, linking them together in a cohesive fashion at a later point, I suppose in a way I am outlining a couple of steps ahead the plot of the story but I have no roadmap to follow and feel at this point in time I would like to carry on in this fashion until I hit a roadblock in the story.

I was wondering: how do other writers feel about this approach? Do some writers still employ this approach?

Why do I want to be liked by others? Because my goal is to have positive social interactions. And if you want to interact with people, you have to be somewhat likable. You wouldn‚Äôt want to be that person everyone finds unpleasant or wants to avoid.

But at the same time, we can‚Äôt please everyone, right? It‚Äôs natural‚Äîeveryone has their own tastes and opinions, and it‚Äôs impossible to be universally liked.

Just as there are incredibly talented people, there are also those who are extremely unskilled.

In the same way, there are people who are extremely pleasant, and there can be people who are incredibly off-putting.

Now, the core issue with manipulation, at least from what I understand, is the lack of honesty.

If my personality, opinions, and natural mannerisms are off-putting to others, how could I ever be honest with people if my goal is to have nice social interactions with others?

I don‚Äôt want to focus too much on myself, but I‚Äôm pretty sure that the ‚Äúreal me‚Äù has a set of characteristics that are (pretty predictably) incompatible with most people. (And don‚Äôt tell me, ‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôll appeal to some people and not to others,‚Äù because in my experience, that‚Äôs not true.)

To take an extreme example, a sadist who wants to make people suffer wouldn‚Äôt be compatible with most humans‚Äîmaybe only with a few masochists, right? You get the idea. If that sadist wanted to socialize, they would have to pretend to care about people.

By making myself more likable, pretending to be a little naive, sweet, caring, and concerned about others, I easily get positive reactions, but it goes further than that‚ÄîI get favors for free and even instill in people a sense of protectiveness (from the internet, ""must protect"") precisely because I seem like a fragile, defenseless creature thrown into a harsh world. (Then there‚Äôs the fact that I don‚Äôt naturally curse, drink alcohol, smoke, drink coffee, eat fried foods, watch porn, or overeat, which only enhances my saint-like image. But honestly, these are just habits I picked up; I don‚Äôt impose anything on myself, nor do I think I'm better than others.)

Over the years, I‚Äôve refined my approach a bit because, for example, when I was younger (okay, I‚Äôm 25 now), I overdid the compliments and agreed with everything.

After realizing that this made people uncomfortable, I now occasionally remind myself: ""Oh no, there‚Äôs a disagreement, better take a stance so others think you have a personality and you‚Äôll be more likable.""

The ‚Äúproblem,‚Äù as you can see, is that even after moving away from being the ‚Äúoverly nice guy,‚Äù it‚Äôs still something artificial that aims to achieve my goal. I just can‚Äôt interact with people any other way.

I've been hanging around indie perfumes for a bit, but haven't had the opportunity to branch out much and would love some recommendations on specific perfumes or perfumers to try out! I love incense-y/smokey and botanical scents, and am looking for something a little spicier as we go into the colder months. More specifically, I'm looking for something spicy, but not very sweet, with a rich, dark base. Something really gingery and warming that reminds you of a cold winter night.

My favorite perfumes are:

* Blood Kiss (BPAL): incense, clove, cherry, vetiver, poppy, wine, honey, vanilla, musk. Notably does not show up as more than a smidge sweet or gourmand on me.
* Forest Reverie (BPAL): ""sunlit ancient forest"", wild rose, grape vine, lily, opium smoke. Strong botanical/woody incense with a touch of musk.
* Forsaken (Conjured Rose): clove, sandalwood, amber, patchouli, vanilla, wood burning smoke, peppercorn. Gorgeous deep smoky scent that smells like a nostalgic campfire.
* Book of Shadows (Conjured Rose): tobacco, musk, myrrh, black tea, frankincense, sandalwood, patchouli, vanilla, amber. A little too light and sweet because I dislike tobacco, but still very pleasant overall.
* Lust (Lush) (solid version): jasmine, ylang ylang, rose, sandalwood. Very bitter and sexy.
* Gorgeous Gardenia (Gucci): gardenia, jasmine, mandarin, red berry, patchouli. Very airy and more refined, for special occasions only.

Disliked perfumes:

* Black Opium (YSL): black coffee, white flowers, vanilla. Tried this in a store once and it made me gag. It smelled like a sweet ashtray.
* A smattering of choices from Death and Floral: all smelled too ozonic and mildewy and made me nauseous. I tried them years ago and don't remember the specific scents though.
* Amber oil (Nemat): amber accord. Was given this a while back, and it's excessively sweet and rich. Gives me a headache.

**TL;DR:**

Looking for: A spicy, dark scent that reminds you of a cold winter night. No/little sweetness. Warming and heavy.

Likes: frankincense, myrhh, wood smoke, benzoin, vanilla, clove/spices, vetiver, patchouli, blackcurrant, labdanum, jasmine, gardenia, pine

Don't love love love but don't mind in moderation: cherry, dark fruits, sandalwood, rose, lavender, amber

Dislikes: predominantly sweet scents, gourmands, cedar, lighter fruits (like strawberries), milky notes, overwhelming florals, cashmere, leather, tobacco. More artificial notes give me a headache.

Unfortunately, I am on a budget and would prefer recommendations under $30-ish USD, but I'm always curious about whatever might be recommended!

Often regarded merely as a tool for transactions, money wields a far-reaching influence that extends beyond facilitating trade. It subtly shapes our identities, influences our choices, and shifts our perspectives. As humans, we possess an innate desire to establish our sense of self, often manifested through our material possessions‚Äîbe it the car we drive, the home we inhabit, or the clothes we wear. These external elements significantly contribute to the formation of our identities and how we present ourselves to others. At the heart of this dynamic lies money.

# 1. Money Determines Lifestyle Choices

From your choice of morning coffee to the neighborhood you live in, financial resources significantly shape your lifestyle and well-being. The decisions we make‚Äîlike whether to grab a gourmet coffee from a local caf√© or live in a lively community‚Äîare often influenced by our finances. Our buying power affects the opportunities we have, such as access to quality education and healthcare, and it also influences how we spend our time, whether that means dining out, traveling, or investing in hobbies and experiences that enhance our lives.

# 2. Money Affects Relationships

https://preview.redd.it/0279p7leqryd1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe2961c99832f8d9bb6133fb5e28ef22eddcbd19

The relationship between money and our [**interactions**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/aim-for-success-by-mastering-these-key-interpersonal-skills/) with others is intricate, shaping social dynamics, power structures, and personal relationships in numerous ways. However, healthy connections in both our personal and professional lives are not necessarily enhanced by financial resources. In fact, money can often introduce tension and strain into relationships. The foundation of building and sustaining relationships relies far more on elements such as honesty, communication, and respect. While money may offer temporary security or luxury, it cannot replace the significance of meaningful connections with others.

# 3. Money Influences Career Decisions

The pursuit of higher salaries and better financial security often guides career choices. While passion and job satisfaction are important, financial considerations can steer individuals away from fulfilling careers into more lucrative, albeit less satisfying, fields. Balancing passion with financial goals is key. The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that individuals who pursued careers aligning with their interests, while maintaining financial stability, reported higher levels of job satisfaction.

# 4. Money Shapes Social Status

https://preview.redd.it/ag9whr7hqryd1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=c709d8211ad3e207b68ba24be30f75f140bb9aec

In many societies, wealth is equated with status and power. Money can open doors to exclusive circles, influence social standing, and impact how others perceive you. While financial success can enhance self-esteem, it's crucial to remember that self-worth should not be solely tied to net worth. Practicing gratitude and focusing on personal achievements can help maintain a balanced perspective.

# 5. Money Drives Personal Development

Money is commonly viewed as a means to facilitate [personal growth](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/how-to-carve-a-pathway-for-personal-growth/) and development. It offers resources for self-care, travel, and learning experiences that expand our perspectives and enhance our skill sets. However, it‚Äôs crucial to recognize that money alone cannot ensure fulfillment or happiness. True personal development demands a genuine commitment to seize and learn from the opportunities available, regardless of financial resources.

# 6. Money Can Buy Happiness

https://preview.redd.it/5l7xf65jqryd1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d9781530edbf4e3712532657a33ba93f75fcf31

While the saying ""money can't buy happiness"" holds some truth, studies have shown that there is a correlation between income and overall life satisfaction. Having enough money to cover basic needs, save for the future, and have some discretionary income can lead to higher levels of well-being. However, once these needs are met, the relationship between money and happiness starts to diminish.

# 7. Money Impacts Mental Health

Financial stability plays a crucial role in mental well-being. Financial worries can trigger anxiety, depression, and a range of [**mental health**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/understanding-mental-health-importance-effects-and-warning-signs/) challenges, especially for those experiencing financial hardship or living in poverty. Furthermore, without sufficient resources, accessing professional mental health support can be financially unfeasible, compounding the struggles faced by individuals in such situations.

# 8. Money Doesn't Equate Success

https://preview.redd.it/1sr94vklqryd1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b755025b186439900c73035508bbd360cf3b838

Success manifests in various forms. While society often prioritizes financial achievements, fostering the notion that wealth is the ultimate measure of success, true accomplishment extends far beyond monetary gains. Authentic success encompasses a range of life aspects, including relationships, personal development, and the pursuit of purpose and fulfillment. Although money can offer comfort and security, it does not ensure a balanced, harmonious, and meaningful existence.

# 9. Money Guides Educational Opportunities

Money plays a significant role in determining the educational opportunities available to individuals. In many cases, the quality of education and the resources available are directly linked to financial means. This is particularly true in higher education, where tuition costs, living expenses, and other fees can be a barrier for those from lower-income backgrounds.

# 10. Money Defines Social Labelling

https://preview.redd.it/bzavsl1oqryd1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3e40ad641a39fcccc8bcbda38ee84ae55939b88

Society often puts labels on individuals based on their financial status. People from low-income backgrounds may be stereotyped as lazy or uneducated, while those with wealth are seen as successful and deserving of respect. These [labels](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/the-perils-of-labeling-people-rethinking-stereotypes/) can have a significant impact on an individual's self-esteem and opportunities in life. It is important to recognize these societal biases and strive towards breaking the cycle of judgement based on financial standing. Everyone deserves equal respect and opportunities, regardless of their economic background.

# Final Thought

Money isn‚Äôt everything, and it shouldn‚Äôt dictate a person‚Äôs worth or abilities. Instead of allowing financial success to drive us, let‚Äôs focus on what truly matters in life‚Äîmeaningful relationships, personal growth, and our unique contributions to society.

Ophthalmology has been the poster boy field for what I wanted to do first getting into medicine. Nearly every single experience during my undergrad has been somewhat centered around that field. I've always found the eyes to be much more interesting compared to the rest of the body and it seemed to include great benefits like work-life balance. And for years I'd always dreamed of getting a tech job within that field. It seemed like the ultimate way to boost my hours and show med schools my commitment to an idea.

Fast forward 8 weeks after initially starting my ophthalmic tech job from the summer and dear lord is my stress levels off the roof. So much so that my face is starting to break out into acne and I've had to go back onto the salycylic acid and creams. 

Where do I even begin? First of all some of these doctors are getting assigned WAYYY too many patients. I'm not sure who exactly is in charge of the booking preferences, but some doctors will have 3 patients scheduled for the same exact times, multiple times throughout the day. Inevitably this leads to the exam lanes getting backed up, people stuck waiting in the lobby getting miffed, and we all leave later in the day.

Other times the patient's I get are really complicated (which is no fault of their own!!!), but none of the typical equipment is ADA accessible. Then there is pressure on me as the tech to 'try and get this info', like my brother in christ as if it's truly feasible? The patient has dementia, I really don't think they can tell me what they see on the TV screen.

And tell me why in this hospital everyone has so many of their own 'preferences'? I've had to go back to using anki flashcards to memorize all these details in order not to attract the ire or lecturing from any of the doctors. Whether its 'this doctor prefers the setup this way', or 'the tech is responsible for writing down the logs for this one doctor', and even 'this one doctor expects the tech to do this very rare test while all other docs do it themselves'.

At the end of the day I'm staying at home like it's college all over again - reviewing the day, making anki cards out of notes, trying to watch equipment tutorial guides online.

I'm not sure what else to even say. I'm not looking for stress help tips - I already understand a good diet and gym can make leaps, and I did get myself some material comforts recently. I guess I just wanted to vent all this out there to other students who might share a similar perspective. 

I know i need this job to put more clinical hours on my resume, but really this gap year I feel like I should have just tried working in a local coffee shop. At least that way my failures and forgetfulness of training would just impact coffee, and not screwup a patients day as well.",6,1730675427.0,premed,4,1.0,False

From your choice of morning coffee to the neighborhood you live in, financial resources significantly shape your lifestyle and well-being. The decisions we make‚Äîlike whether to grab a gourmet coffee from a local caf√© or live in a lively community‚Äîare often influenced by our finances. Our buying power affects the opportunities we have, such as access to quality education and healthcare, and it also influences how we spend our time, whether that means dining out, traveling, or investing in hobbies and experiences that enhance our lives.

# 2. Money Affects Relationships

https://preview.redd.it/16thi2chpryd1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcadc7250fd8babb1c3f6a539f102aa0ca44e631

The relationship between money and our [**interactions**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/aim-for-success-by-mastering-these-key-interpersonal-skills/) with others is intricate, shaping social dynamics, power structures, and personal relationships in numerous ways. However, healthy connections in both our personal and professional lives are not necessarily enhanced by financial resources. In fact, money can often introduce tension and strain into relationships. The foundation of building and sustaining relationships relies far more on elements such as honesty, communication, and respect. While money may offer temporary security or luxury, it cannot replace the significance of meaningful connections with others.

# 3. Money Influences Career Decisions

The pursuit of higher salaries and better financial security often guides career choices. While passion and job satisfaction are important, financial considerations can steer individuals away from fulfilling careers into more lucrative, albeit less satisfying, fields. Balancing passion with financial goals is key. The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that individuals who pursued careers aligning with their interests, while maintaining financial stability, reported higher levels of job satisfaction.

# 4. Money Shapes Social Status

https://preview.redd.it/614qnntipryd1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ab56348945d8b9b59eae79810aad40802479596

In many societies, wealth is equated with status and power. Money can open doors to exclusive circles, influence social standing, and impact how others perceive you. While financial success can enhance self-esteem, it's crucial to remember that self-worth should not be solely tied to net worth. Practicing gratitude and focusing on personal achievements can help maintain a balanced perspective.

# 5. Money Drives Personal Development

Money is commonly viewed as a means to facilitate [personal growth](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/how-to-carve-a-pathway-for-personal-growth/) and development. It offers resources for self-care, travel, and learning experiences that expand our perspectives and enhance our skill sets. However, it‚Äôs crucial to recognize that money alone cannot ensure fulfillment or happiness. True personal development demands a genuine commitment to seize and learn from the opportunities available, regardless of financial resources.

# 6. Money Can Buy Happiness

https://preview.redd.it/942dz94qpryd1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=959e8e018230b8c4f2a959c1d69a002994736a21

While the saying ""money can't buy happiness"" holds some truth, studies have shown that there is a correlation between income and overall life satisfaction. Having enough money to cover basic needs, save for the future, and have some discretionary income can lead to higher levels of well-being. However, once these needs are met, the relationship between money and happiness starts to diminish.

# 7. Money Impacts Mental Health

Financial stability plays a crucial role in mental well-being. Financial worries can trigger anxiety, depression, and a range of [**mental health**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/understanding-mental-health-importance-effects-and-warning-signs/) challenges, especially for those experiencing financial hardship or living in poverty. Furthermore, without sufficient resources, accessing professional mental health support can be financially unfeasible, compounding the struggles faced by individuals in such situations.

# 8. Money Doesn't Equate Success

https://preview.redd.it/t5h9mytnpryd1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=beeabf06e639a3f72b4ef2014c679378c06be177

Success manifests in various forms. While society often prioritizes financial achievements, fostering the notion that wealth is the ultimate measure of success, true accomplishment extends far beyond monetary gains. Authentic success encompasses a range of life aspects, including relationships, personal development, and the pursuit of purpose and fulfillment. Although money can offer comfort and security, it does not ensure a balanced, harmonious, and meaningful existence.

# 9. Money Guides Educational Opportunities

Money plays a significant role in determining the educational opportunities available to individuals. In many cases, the quality of education and the resources available are directly linked to financial means. This is particularly true in higher education, where tuition costs, living expenses, and other fees can be a barrier for those from lower-income backgrounds.

# 10. Money Defines Social Labelling

https://preview.redd.it/bmn6leespryd1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac35561182504aae279e568c9dd5ded30db28595

Society often puts labels on individuals based on their financial status. People from low-income backgrounds may be stereotyped as lazy or uneducated, while those with wealth are seen as successful and deserving of respect. These [labels](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/the-perils-of-labeling-people-rethinking-stereotypes/) can have a significant impact on an individual's self-esteem and opportunities in life. It is important to recognize these societal biases and strive towards breaking the cycle of judgement based on financial standing. Everyone deserves equal respect and opportunities, regardless of their economic background.

# Final Thought

Money isn‚Äôt everything, and it shouldn‚Äôt dictate a person‚Äôs worth or abilities. Instead of allowing financial success to drive us, let‚Äôs focus on what truly matters in life‚Äîmeaningful relationships, personal growth, and our unique contributions to society.

1gizy8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadLetterBox/comments/1gizy8b/drive_thru_shenanigans/,Drive Thru Shenanigans,"I slept through the whole ride up to Ventana Beach, but I wouldn‚Äôt say I got any rest. It was one of those busy nights that faded into morning without giving me so much as thirty minutes at home before another call came in. Gus was in my neighborhood finishing up another call when he got this one, and was told by Carol to scoop me up on the way north. The sun had just come up, and in Florida during August, that means it was already warming up. It was going to be a hot day, which was bad news, because this was a decomp and it was an hour away, meaning we would have to deal with the stench in the van for an hour on the way back.¬†

The house was way out west of US1 in an area that wasn‚Äôt quite rural, there were no farms around, but it wasn‚Äôt exactly a suburb, either. Scattered along dirt roads, there were what we called Florida ‚Äúcracker houses‚Äù, the kind of old houses that sit a couple feet off the ground over a crawlspace to make room for flood water, and they have retractable metal awnings over the windows that double as the cheapest hurricane shutters you can imagine. These houses are always infested with¬†roaches, and there‚Äôs not a damn thing you can do to stop it. ¬†

Gus pulls up on the property and backs¬†the van close to the front steps.¬†

‚ÄúWe should‚Äôve stopped for coffee,‚Äù I said.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôll stop at Dunkin‚Äô on the way back,‚Äù he said.¬†

It was hot and I was already sweating in the shirt and tie that I had to wear at all times, and now I had to put this Tyvek suit on over everything, along with a respirator, which was only going to make things worse. ¬†

*I don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs gonna stink more after this, me or the cadaver.*¬†

I could already smell it as we walked up the steps to the ancient screen door that didn‚Äôt shut properly, because they never do on these houses. We go inside and are immediately swarmed by huge black flies, the kind that always come in the company of maggots. I almost vomited into my respirator, but choked it back as best as I could. This was far from my first decomp, but it was one of the worst I‚Äôd seen. ¬†

The victim was a Vietnamese male in his fifties who had a ton of health issues on top of his cancer. He had no wife, no children, and apparently no other family or friends, since it was a neighbor who noticed the raccoon family going in and out of the many ripped screen windows. The neighbor came to check and see if everything was okay and, well, everything was very much not okay. I have no idea if was the raccoons, but something had been chewing on the poor guy to the point that his head was nearly detached from his body.¬†

Due to his health issues and the fact that his water had been turned off long before he died, the man had buckets and pots everywhere for releasing whatever solids and liquids decided to come out of his various orifices. So, on top of the smell of a body that‚Äôs been decomposing in the Florida summer for what looked to have been around two weeks, there was also the smell of two-week-old shit and piss and vomit in about a dozen buckets and pots throughout the house. And he was crawling with maggots.¬†

When we went outside to get the gurney and body bag, the locals news crew had shown up, and they were currently interviewing a police spokesperson. This brought onlookers, and soon enough, a crowd had formed at the edge of the property. I prayed for a strong breeze to carry the smell over the crowd and send them back to where they came from, with a memory they wouldn‚Äôt soon forget. ¬†

Back inside, dodging flies and maggots and buckets of shit, we lowered the gurney next to the body and set an open body bag on top. It should‚Äôve been easy enough, since the guy was fairly small, but nothing ever goes exactly according to plan in this business. With Gus at his feet and me at his head, we did a three count and lifted him. As I lifted him by his wrists, I noticed that his head stayed on the floor.¬†

*Well, that fuckin‚Äô sucks.*¬†

We put the body in the bag, place his head in with him, and zip him up as quickly as possible. Loading him up went smoothly, and before we knew it, we were back on the road. ¬†

We kept our Tyvek suits on to try to keep some of the smell permeating our clothes, and because it was so strong, decided to keep the respirators on for the drive. It seems counterintuitive, but rolling down the windows to get fresh air is a very bad idea. These vans don‚Äôt have back windows to create circulation, and because of the cage behind the front seats, rolling down the front windows just creates a vacuum effect where the wind pulls the air from the back of the van to the front. As much as we were sweating in those Tyvek suits over our clothes, and as uncomfortable as the respirators became, it was infinitely better than what would happen if we rolled down the windows..¬†

We finally make it back to town and Gus says ‚Äúfuck this, I need coffee too.‚Äù¬†

There was a Dunkin‚Äô about five minutes from the Medical Examiner‚Äôs Office, and we both agreed that waiting was out of the question. We placed our order for two large iced coffees at the speaker, then inched our way up in the busy line. When it was our turn at the window, we pulled up and Gus slid his card in the card reader under the window to pay for the drinks, then we waited a minute or so for an employee to come open the window and hand them to us. ¬†

‚ÄúBRUH WHAT THE FUCK?!?‚Äù¬†

The poor kid barely got the window open when the odor from the van got sucked inside the building. He immediately put his arm over his nose and mouth and turned away, and we could see customers and employees inside making sour faces and covering their noses. Gus looked at me from the driver‚Äôs seat and started laughing maniacally under his respirator like Darth Vader if he was played by Willem Dafoe. As bad as I felt for everyone in that building, I couldn‚Äôt help but join him.¬†

‚ÄúHey, can I get my coffee?‚Äù Gus asked the empty window.¬†

A moment later, a woman¬†shows up with two large iced coffees, holding her breath.¬†

‚ÄúGo, go, just go!‚Äù She says as she hands us our drinks.¬†

Speeding away and only a few minutes from our destination, we finally risk taking off the respirators to drink our iced coffee. ¬†

‚ÄúThat was pretty fucked up,‚Äù I said.¬†

‚ÄúYeah, I know. Pretty damn funny though, huh?‚Äù¬†

I couldn‚Äôt disagree, just nodded and grinned as I drank my iced coffee.¬†

*Goddam, this is delicious. Maybe today won‚Äôt be so bad.*¬†

Since this community has such a wealth of experience with specialty coffee, I‚Äôd love any advice you have on making this project something coffee lovers would appreciate. Specifically, are there any coffees or roasters you‚Äôd recommend featuring? Also, what are your thoughts on focusing on smaller micro-roasters versus bigger names like Onyx, Proud Mary, or Sweet Bloom? And how do you feel about highlighting international roasters, like Nomad, Tim Wendelboe or The Barn?

Thank you so much! I‚Äôm excited to learn from all your insights and hopefully make Nectarous something that truly resonates.
