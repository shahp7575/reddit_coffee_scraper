Her father, surprised, asked about the sudden change, reminding her how she'd always insisted on staying with Brendan. Jayde forced a laugh, revealing the painful truth: Brendan was getting married, and she, his stepsister, could no longer cling to him.
That night, she tried to tell Brendan about her college acceptance, but his fiancée, Chloie Ellis, interrupted with a bubbly call, and Brendan's tender words to Chloie twisted a knife in Jayde's heart. She remembered how his tenderness used to be hers alone, how he had protected her, and how she had poured out her heart to him in a diary and a love letter, only for him to explode, tearing the letter and yelling, ""I'm your brother!""
He had stormed out, leaving her to painstakingly tape the shredded pieces back together. Her love, however, didn't die, not even when he brought Chloie home and told her to call her ""sister-in-law.""
Now, she understood. She had to put that fire out herself. She had to dig Brendan out of her heart.

Chapter 1
Eighteen days after she decided to give up on Brendan Maynard, Jayde Rosario cut off her waist-length hair. She stood in front of the mirror and smoked her first cigarette, the sm**e curling around her fingers. The taste was bitter.

That night, she called her father across the country.

""Dad, I got into UC Berkeley.""

Her voice was quiet.

""I want to move to California. I want to be with you again.""

Her father, Farrell Conner, sounded surprised on the other end of the line. ""After your mom and I divorced, I settled down here. I always asked you to come over as an exchange student, but you insisted on staying with your step-brother, Brendan. Why the sudden change?""

Jayde lowered her eyes, which were red and swollen. She forced a small, light laugh.

""Some paths you have to walk to the end to know they're dead ends.""

She paused, her voice shaking slightly.

""Brendan is getting married. It's not right for me, his sister with no bl**d relation, to cling to him anymore.""

Her father sighed, his voice full of sympathy. ""It's good you've figured it out. Your mom and Mr. Maynard have been traveling the world, leaving you with Brendan all these years. You're grown up now. It's time to come live with me. You can study and learn to manage the company.""

""Okay,"" Jayde said, then hung up.

She saw her swollen eyes in the reflection of the dark phone screen. She went to the bathroom and splashed cold water on her face. She had two weeks until she left for Berkeley. She had to pull herself together.

She walked down the hallway and noticed the light was on in the study. She hesitated for a moment, then pulled up her e-acceptance letter on her phone and knocked on the door.

""Knock, knock, knock.""

Inside, Brendan Maynard sat at his desk. He wore dark blue silk loungewear, and his high nose supported a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. He looked elegant, aloof, and disciplined as he typed on his computer.

""Brendan,"" Jayde said softly. This was the man who was her step-brother. He was also the secret, hidden crush of her entire teenage life.

Brendan looked up from his screen, his brow furrowed in a slight frown. ""Something wrong?""

Jayde pursed her lips, hesitating. ""The college admission results are out...""

Before she could finish, a cute, bubbly ringtone cut through the quiet room. ""Darling, answer the phone~""

Brendan's frown vanished instantly. He picked up his phone, and a gentle smile spread across his face as he listened to the person on the other end.

""Chloie, you can work directly with the wedding planner. Just tell them to arrange whatever designs you want. Remember, money is no object.""

A sharp bitterness filled Jayde's ch**t. Brendan's tenderness used to belong only to her.

When she was eight, her remarried mother brought her to the Maynard household. She stood awkwardly in the grand mansion, lost and alone. Young Brendan, dressed in his British-style school uniform, had walked over and taken her hand. ""Little girl, I'm your brother now,"" he'd said.

When she was ten, she was afraid of the dark. Brendan secretly used his allowance to buy her a Totoro nightlight. ""Don't be scared,"" he'd told her. ""I'll protect you, just like Totoro protects Mei.""

During her teenage years, Brendan was the sun in her world. She didn't know how to tell him about the love she kept hidden, so she wrote it all down in a diary, over and over again.

Then, on her seventeenth birthday, just before Brendan graduated from college, she gave him everything. She gave him the diary filled with her feelings and a love letter where she poured out her heart.

That day, Brendan exploded. He flipped the gift box over, sending its contents scattering across the floor.

""Jayde Rosario, are you sick? I'm your brother!"" he had yelled.

But she had been stubborn. ""We're not related by bl**d. You're not my real brother. You've pampered me and protected me and cared for me all these years. Isn't it natural for me to fall in love with you?""

Her stubbornness was met with cruelty. He mercilessly tore the love letter into pieces.

""I knew you'd do something foolish. I shouldn't have bothered with you all these years! You can't even tell the difference between family affection and romantic love!""

He stormed out of the house that day without a second glance. Jayde cried as she picked up the shredded pieces from the floor. She took them to her room and painstakingly taped them back together. But the letter was scarred, a patchwork of its former self.

Her failed confession didn't k**l her love for him. She studied harder, determined to get into the same university he attended, to stay in the same city.

But on the day she finished high school, Brendan brought a woman named Chloie Ellis home.

""Jayde, call her 'sister-in-law',"" he'd said.

That night, Jayde cried until she couldn't breathe. She finally understood that the ninety-nine steps she had taken through thorns to reach him meant nothing. She and Brendan would only ever be siblings. There was no other possibility.

The intense love that had burned in her heart for years now felt like a fire that was burning her alive.

Now, she understood. She had to put that fire out herself. She had to dig Brendan out of her heart.

Chapter 2
Watching Brendan still on the phone with Chloie Ellis, his voice soft and loving, Jayde Rosario swallowed the words she had come to say. She turned and quietly left the study.

To him, she was just a stepsister living in his house. He wouldn't care where she went to college. If that was the case, she didn't need to tell him.

In fifteen days, she would leave the Maynard home. She would leave Brendan.

Back in her room, Jayde looked at the warm glow of the Totoro nightlight on her bedside table. A flicker of sadness crossed her face. The chubby Totoro holding a green leaf umbrella over a little girl looked just like how Brendan used to shield her. But the past was the past.

She sighed softly and switched off the nightlight. The room went dark.

""Since I've decided to go, it's time to pack,"" she murmured to herself.

She pulled an old duffel bag from the top of her closet and opened the large, wall-to-wall display cabinet. Inside the glass-fronted shelves were all the memories. The good luck charms Brendan had brought her from the temple. The Coral Sea perfume he had specially blended for her on a trip to France.

One by one, she took them all out and placed them in the duffel bag. The bag slowly filled up, but her heart felt like it was emptying, a hollow space where a cold wind was blowing.

She pushed down the sadness and opened the bottom drawer of the cabinet. A yellowed diary lay inside. The pages were filled with childish pencil scribbles from her turbulent childhood.

[The new teacher is nice, but the kids say I'm a jinx. They say I have one dad and one mom, and nobody wants me.]

She remembered how Brendan had found her diary back then. He had read that page and gently st**ked her head. ""Silly girl, you're not a jinx,"" he'd said. ""You're a star in my eyes. You sparkle brighter than anyone.""

After that day, no one at school ever called her names again. She later found out that Brendan had gone to the school and quietly warned those children. He had protected her childhood in his own quiet way.

As she flipped through the diary, the pencil handwriting became neater. Every single page was about Brendan.

She turned page after page, her eyes blurring with tears. The last page held a note from him from when she was choosing her subjects in high school.

[Kid, whether you choose arts or sciences, remember to go to college here in the city. After you graduate, you can work at Maynard Group. I protected you when you were little. I'll keep looking out for you when you grow up.]

A tear fell silently onto the diary, blurring the ink.

Jayde pulled herself together, pushing down the complicated knot of feelings in her ch**t. Then, she started tearing the pages out of the diary. She tore up the letters, too. With each rip of the paper, a memory of her and Brendan seemed to fade.

She threw all the shredded pieces into the duffel bag and zipped it shut.

A while later, she heard a commotion downstairs. She walked out of her room and saw Chloie Ellis in the living room, hugging Brendan. A suitcase stood beside her.

Jayde's heart stuttered, and she froze on the landing.

Seeing her, Chloie smiled and waved. ""Jayde! I'm moving in for a few days. I brought you a gift!""

Chloie opened an ornate box she was holding. ""See if you like it.""

Inside was a pink wristwatch with a metal strap. It was cute, with a bit of a British style.

Jayde frowned. She didn't reach for it. She had been allergic to metal since she was a child. When she was nine, a nanny had given her a metal spoon to eat with. She'd only gotten a small rash, but Brendan had fired the nanny on the spot. He had every metal item that might touch her skin replaced. He didn't allow any of her allergens near her.

As she was lost in thought, Brendan's voice cut through the air. ""Hurry up and take it. Don't disappoint your sister-in-law.""

His words hit her hard. She stared at his matter-of-fact expression, a wave of sadness washing over her. He hadn't just taken back all his favoritism. He had forgotten her completely.

Jayde took a deep breath. She took the box and put the watch on her wrist.

""Thank you, sister-in-law. And... thank you, Brendan.""

Thank you for making my decision to leave even easier.

Chapter 3
That night, Chloie Ellis sl**t in Brendan Maynard's room.

Jayde knew they were a couple. She knew it was normal for them to stay together. But the quiet, ambiguous sounds that floated through the house in the dead of night kept her awake.

She lit another cigarette, watching the sm**e curl around her slender fingers before taking a deep drag. It tasted bitter and acrid, just like her feelings.

The next morning, Jayde came downstairs with swollen eyes.

""Jayde!"" Chloie called out, pulling her to sit on the sofa. A faint red mark was visible on Chloie's neck. ""Your brother's birthday is coming up. I want to throw him a party. Do you know what style he likes?""

Chloie's question pulled Jayde back to the present. She couldn't help but remember a conversation she and Brendan had once had while walking on the beach.

She had told him she loved the sparkling ocean, the sound of the waves, and holding his hand as they walked on the sand while the sun rose. That day, Brendan had held her hand and walked with her for a long, long time.

""Kid, you like the beach,"" he'd said. ""So from now on, our birthday parties will be by the sea. What you like is what I like.""

Back then, his world revolved around her. Now, he avoided her. He had forgotten everything she liked.

A bitter feeling spread through her ch**t. It took her a moment to find her voice. ""I...""

She was about to speak when Brendan walked over and interrupted her. ""My affairs, you should ask me.""

Chloie clung to his arm, whining. ""I just thought, since you're a girl, you'd know him better. It seems like even his sister doesn't really know him.""

Jayde forced a smile. ""Yes. I really don't.""

""You two talk. I have to go,"" she said, suppressing the bitterness. She turned to leave, but Brendan's eyes darkened.

""It's early in the morning. What could you possibly have to do?""

His cold voice made her heart stop for a second. Did he still care what she did?

Jayde answered truthfully. ""I have an appointment to get my visa today.""

As soon as she said it, Chloie looked surprised. ""Going on a trip? With friends? Or a boyfriend?""

Brendan frowned at Jayde, his tone full of accusation. ""Jayde Rosario, you just finished high school. Don't get involved with the wrong kind of people before you even start college.""

The cold reprimand felt like a physical blow. It left her with no strength to explain.

In the silence, Chloie smoothed things over. ""It's normal for a young girl to date. Brendan, don't be so harsh.""

Then she turned to Jayde, her voice soft and comforting. ""If you like someone, you should love boldly. You only get to be eighteen once. Don't listen to your brother.""

Chloie then took Brendan's hand and they left together. Watching them walk away, Jayde slowly clenched her fists.

She only had one eighteen, and she had already given it to Brendan.

Fourteen days left. Then she would leave. She wouldn't let her youth get buried in this swamp where no one noticed her.

Jayde left the house. It was foggy outside, a light drizzle falling. Even though it was summer, the rain made her shiver.

In the past, on every rainy day, Brendan would drive her himself. ""My little girl can't get wet,"" he would say. ""My arms are your shelter.""

But now, she had to get used to walking alone.

She lowered her gaze and walked out into the rain with her umbrella.

After getting her visa, she was about to call a cab when she saw a notification on her phone. A special notification, from Brendan's social media. Her finger moved on its own, clicking on it.

Brendan, who usually posted something once every six months, had a new status.

[Rainy days are perfect for going public.]

The photo was of him in a perfectly tailored tuxedo, embracing Chloie Ellis, who was in a mermaid-style wedding dress. He was smiling gently at the camera.

The simple sentence and the wedding photo shocked Jayde. Her eyes, already red, burned. The comment section was filled with congratulations. People were saying they were a perfect match, a pair made in heaven.

Jayde stared at the screen, feeling nothing. The usual ache in her ch**t wasn't there.

She calmly typed a comment.

[May you be together forever.]

Chapter 4
After posting the comment, Jayde Rosario unfollowed Brendan Maynard's social media. The days until she left were counting down. She would use this time to dig him out of her heart, piece by piece.

She returned to the hillside mansion. The house was empty, and a chill hung in the air. She went into the kitchen and cooked herself a simple bowl of egg noodles.

While she was eating, her phone buzzed. It was a message from Chloie Ellis.

[Jayde, Brendan and I won't be home tonight. Take care of yourself.]

A moment later, Chloie sent several more photos. A candlelit dinner. A mirror selfie in a fancy hotel suite.

Jayde's fingertips trembled slightly as she looked at the pictures. She calmly replied with one word.

""Okay.""

She closed the chat, and a notification popped up from her high school group chat. Someone had tagged her. She clicked on it and saw her classmates were planning a graduation party for the weekend.

She thought about it. Once she moved to California, she probably wouldn't come back to the country very often. She agreed to go.

Her reply instantly brought the group chat to life.

[Will your doting brother Brendan Maynard come to the party?]

[Remember that time we were camping and there was a landslide? Your brother flew back overnight and brought a search party into the mountains to find you. He said he'd always be with you when you went out. He should come this time too, right?]

The messages from her classmates filled her mind with memories of a time when she felt safe and warm. But now, those warm feelings were like shards of ice, piercing her heart with every breath.

Jayde put her phone down and replied with three words.

[He's not coming.]

Her classmates' idea of Brendan was stuck in the past, in the years when he spoiled her completely. They didn't know about the confession he had rejected when she was seventeen. And they didn't know that the man who had promised to protect her had found someone else to protect.

That night, Jayde sl**t restlessly. In her dream, she was eight years old again, standing awkwardly by the fountain on her first day at the Maynard home. She didn't know what to do.

In the dream, young Brendan, in his plaid school uniform, glanced at her indifferently. Then he turned and walked away with his backpack, without saying a single word.

She woke with a start, her face wet with tears that had stained her pillow.

If Brendan had been that cold to her from the very beginning, maybe she would have understood the distance between them sooner.

But there were no ""if onlys."" The hardest thing in the world wasn't never having something. It was having all the favoritism, and then losing it all overnight.

When she got up, she looked at the duffel bag in the corner of her room, full of memories. Thirteen days left. Thirteen days until she truly left this place.

Whether she wanted to or not, she had to throw these memories away. Only by getting rid of them completely could she clear the space in her heart.

Jayde took a deep breath, picked up the heavy duffel bag, and walked out of her room.

As she was about to go downstairs, she saw Brendan and Chloie Ellis had just returned.

Brendan frowned when he saw the bag in her hand. ""School hasn't started yet. Where are you going with that luggage?""

Jayde tightened her grip on the strap. ""I'll be living on campus later, so I packed some useless things to throw away.""

She struggled to carry the heavy bag down the stairs.

Brendan didn't say anything. He just strode forward, took the bag from her, and walked outside. He threw it directly into the large tr**h receptacle by the curb.

The clattering sound it made as it landed made Jayde's heart sink. If he cared even a little, he would have heard the sound of the wind chimes made from seashells from the Aegean Sea inside the bag.

What he threw away were the gifts he had flown halfway around the world to bring her over the years. They were also the memories they had once promised they would never forget.

But Brendan didn't even glance at the tr**h. His gaze was fixed straight ahead.

""You're going to college in the city. There's no need to live on campus. Stay at home after school starts. I'll talk to your teacher.""

His tone was unquestionable. It filled Jayde with a mix of emotions. If he had just asked her high school teacher, he would have known she hadn't even applied to any colleges in the city. She had applied directly to the University of California, Berkeley, thousands of miles away.

But his mind was on Chloie Ellis now. He didn't care about her future at all.

It didn't matter. Only thirteen days left. Once she was in California, she wouldn't need his attention.

Thinking this, she turned and went back upstairs without a word.

Behind her, she heard Chloie asking quietly, ""Is Jayde mad because we didn't come home last night?""

Brendan's voice was cold. ""She's eighteen now. She should learn to be independent. No one can stay with her forever.""

Jayde paused on the stairs, then continued to her room.

Yes, she was eighteen. She wouldn't miss the past. And she wouldn't hope for the future. From now on, she could walk her own path, all by herself.

Chapter 5
For the next few days, Jayde Rosario stayed in her room. She didn't leave from morning until night. Brendan Maynard took Chloie Ellis out early every day and came back late, and sometimes they didn't come home at all. Their lives no longer seemed to intersect.

Sunday arrived. Ten days before she was set to leave. It was also the day of her high school reunion.

At a bar by the sea, as soon as Jayde walked into the private room, a few of her close friends handed her a drink.

""You're eighteen now. Let's say goodbye to being kids and legally have our first drink.""

Jayde paused for a moment. People said al**hol could drown your sorrows, and she wanted to relax. This drink was a farewell to her friends, a final toast.

After one drink, she felt a little dizzy. She went out to the corridor to get some fresh air. As she passed an open private room, she unexpectedly saw Brendan. He was surrounded by a group of men and women, laughing and talking.

Her heart skipped a beat. She forced herself to look away, but the conversation from inside the room made her stop.

""Brendan, you're about to get engaged to Chloie. What about your sister, Jayde Rosario? She used to follow you everywhere.""

""She's an adult now. She's not my responsibility anymore.""

The clear, familiar voice reached her ears, and it sobered her up a little. She stood at the doorway, her eyes lowered, not moving for a long moment.

After what felt like a long time, she murmured to herself and continued walking down the corridor.

""Yes, she's an adult. She's sensible. From now on, my world won't have you in it, either.""

Jayde went to the window at the end of the corridor to get some air. Then she went to the restroom and splashed cold water on her face. When she came out, she ran right into Brendan. He seemed to have had a few drinks himself.

Their eyes met.

Jayde was about to speak, but Chloie Ellis's voice came from behind him. ""Brendan.""

She called out his name sweetly, then threw herself into his arms. ""I drank too much. I can barely walk.""

Brendan ki**ed her on the forehead, his voice doting. ""Then I'll carry you.""

With that, he scooped Chloie up into his arms in a princess carry and walked away, as if Jayde wasn't even there.

Their in**mate display left Jayde frozen in place for a long time.

""Jayde, why are you crying?"" Her friend, Brielle Steele, asked, pulling her back to reality.

Jayde froze, then forced a faint smile. ""It's just an eyelash in my eye. It's nothing.""

Brielle nodded, then pointed in the direction Brendan had gone. ""Is that your brother? He actually has a girlfriend now. We all thought he'd never date. We thought he'd always stay with you, because he used to dote on you so much.""

Hearing this, Jayde felt a slight bitterness in her heart. ""He and I both have our own lives. We won't be tied together forever.""

Brielle's face showed a hint of regret. ""Actually, we all used to think he was your boyfriend. You two looked so good together. It's just a shame he's your brother...""

Jayde's heart felt heavy and damp. She used to think it was a shame, too. But now she felt that the bonds between people were just fate. She and Brendan used to be siblings. From now on, they would have no relationship at all.

The reunion ended at one in the morning. Jayde said goodbye to her friends and walked out of the bar. She saw Brendan and Chloie standing by the revolving door, looking like they were waiting for her.

""You're an adult now, and you're still out past midnight. You're getting more and more out of control. What if something happens?""

The reprimand froze her in place.

Chloie glanced at Brendan reproachfully. ""Jayde has you to protect her now, and later she'll have her boyfriend to protect her. What could possibly happen?""

""Let's go home together,"" Chloie said, taking Brendan's hand and walking out. She motioned for Jayde to follow.

Jayde followed behind them, her eyes on the ground. Only when they stepped outside did she realize it was drizzling again.

Brendan opened his umbrella and walked forward with Chloie, not looking back. The large umbrella was tilted to the right, shielding Chloie completely from the rain, while half of his own shirt was dark with water.

Jayde watched them in a daze. She suddenly remembered how Brendan used to hold his umbrella for her. He always tilted it towards her.

""Jayde is my delicate rose,"" he used to say. ""Roses can't get wet. I'll always protect you.""

A gust of wind blew, and the slanted raindrops fell onto Jayde's white dress, bringing a chill with them.

Jayde came back to her senses and slowly walked out into the rain alone.

Roses can't get wet, but I want to be my own sunflower. Always facing the sun, always bright.

Chapter 6
When she got home, Jayde Rosario was soaked from the rain. She felt drowsy and heavy. After a hot shower, she collapsed into bed and fell asleep immediately.

For the past few days, she had been alone in the mansion. She was already getting used to it. She no longer tried to ask about Brendan Maynard's whereabouts.

""Ding.""

Her phone chimed with a message. She picked it up and saw it was from her father, Farrell Conner.

[My dear daughter, your flight is scheduled to depart at 10 PM on August 25th. Remember to bring all your documents and materials for school. Dad will be waiting for you at the airport.]

Jayde clicked on her phone's calendar. She murmured to herself, ""Only seven days until I leave this home.""

Her calendar for seven days from now had an entry: [Brendan Maynard's Birthday].

Maybe her departure was the best birthday gift she could give him.

Over the next two days, Jayde went through her luggage again, making sure she had everything. Then she packed up all the old things she couldn't take with her and arranged for a donation pick-up service.

As the courier was making a list of the items and preparing to pack them into boxes, Brendan returned home.

""What's going on?"" he asked, his eyes on the piles of clothes and books.

Jayde filled out the donation form and motioned for the courier to take the bags first. ""I arranged for old clothes to be picked up. I'm clearing out things I don't use.""

Her voice was calm and empty of emotion. It made Brendan frown. He had felt that Jayde was different lately, but he couldn't quite figure out what had changed. A strange feeling was growing inside him, a sense of emptiness he couldn't explain.

""Chloie and I have been staying at the Blue Sea Apartments downtown,"" he said, changing the subject. ""It's quieter there and more convenient for work.""

Jayde just nodded slightly. The Blue Sea Apartments, without her there, would indeed be quieter.

She watched as Brendan started gathering some of his and Chloie's things, preparing to leave again. On impulse, she asked, ""Brendan, your birthday is next Friday. Can I attend?""

Jayde had meticulously prepared a gift for Brendan's birthday every single year. This year would have been the tenth year. Ten. A perfect number. She wanted to see it through one last time.

Brendan had shielded her for ten years. She wanted to say a proper goodbye.

""We'll see,"" Brendan said, unwilling to commit. He pushed his suitcase toward the door and left.

The heavy sound of the door closing made Jayde's heart tremble slightly. Her eyes reddened.

Back in her room, she instinctively reached for the drawer in her bedside table, wanting to look at the love letters she had written to him. But when she opened it, the drawer was empty. She had already thrown away those brief but heartfelt letters. Only a faded sketchpad lay at the bottom of the drawer.

Jayde carefully took out the old sketchpad and gently opened it. The yellowed pages each showed Brendan in a different moment.

Brendan in his plaid school uniform, holding her hand, saying, ""Kid, I'm taking you home.""

Brendan on the highest podium, holding a trophy, hanging the gold medal around her neck. He had said, ""Kid, you're my badge of honor.""

Brendan at a formal banquet, holding a w**e glass, in complete control, sending a thornless rose over to her table. He had said, ""Kid, roses need time to bloom. I'll wait for you to grow up.""

Every drawing was a memory etched deep in her mind.

But it didn't matter anymore. She would scrape those memories clean from her heart, bit by bit.

She turned to the last page of the sketchpad. It was blank. Jayde remembered that every year on Brendan's birthday, she would secretly draw a picture of the two of them together. She thought she would draw one this year, too.

But this year, the people in the drawing would be Brendan and Chloie Ellis.

This time, she genuinely wished them well.

She drew meticulously, st**ke by st**ke, with great care. She didn't stop until the sun began to set.

Then, she heard the sound of a key in the front door.

Jayde went out to the living room and saw Brendan stumble in. He smelled strongly of al**hol.

""Brendan, why did you drink so much?"" Seeing his unsteady steps, she quickly went to help him.

Brendan leaned heavily on her, his large hand wrapping naturally around her waist. The strong scent of al**hol mixed with his familiar woody cologne filled her senses.

Jayde froze. She wanted to step back, to create some distance, but the next moment, Brendan pulled her into his embrace.

His restless hand slipped under her clothes, and his burning, al**hol-fueled k**s landed forcefully on her lips.

Chapter 7
Jayde Rosario's mind went completely blank.

This was the scene she had dreamed of countless times, but now it was happening, real and overwhelming. A rough hand moved over her ch**t, sending a jolt through her body that made her pull back, struggling against him.

""Brendan...""

Her struggle only seemed to make him more forceful.

""Chloie, be good..."" Brendan's passion-filled murmur exploded next to her ear like a clap of thunder.

In a daze, she felt herself being lifted. The man carried her into the bedroom and pushed her onto the bed.

It was only then, as she landed on the soft mattress, that she truly woke up from the intoxicating k**s.

""Brendan Maynard, look closely! I'm Jayde Rosario! I am not Chloie Ellis!""

Jayde's voice trembled with a pain that was sharp and heartbreaking.

Brendan stopped. His eyes, clouded with drunkenness, glanced at her. Then he simply pulled her into his arms and held her, doing nothing else.

Jayde tried to get up, but Brendan's hoarse voice whispered in her ear.

""Don't go.""

Her body went stiff. Her hands clenched into fists at her sides. Was he asking her to stay? Or did he still think she was Chloie Ellis?

Deep, even breathing sounds came from beside her. Brendan had closed his eyes and fallen asleep.

A sudden, suffocating feeling of powerlessness washed over her. She tried to break free from his arms, but his grip was too strong. She couldn't escape.

Her head felt heavy, and the lingering smell of al**hol on his breath made her even dizzier. An overwhelming fatigue washed over her, and she fell into a dazed sl**p.

The next morning, the first thing Jayde saw when she opened her eyes was Brendan. He was standing by the bed, looking down at her with an unreadable expression.

""Jayde Rosario, why are you in my bed?""

The events of last night flooded her mind, and her face flushed with heat. She instinctively opened her mouth to speak, but Brendan cut her off.

""If this happens again, you'll move to the school dorms. And you will never enter my room again!""

The man's reprimand was mixed with disappointment and disgust. It made Jayde swallow any explanation she might have had.

""I'm sorry,"" she said quietly. ""It won't happen again.""

She knew that even if she told him the truth, he wouldn't believe her. In his eyes, she was just his stepsister who had inappropriate feelings for him.

It didn't matter. Only five days left. In five days, she would be in California. From now on, she wouldn't just avoid his room; she would disappear from his world forever.

Jayde got out of bed, pulling her messy clothes together, and walked out of the room.

Just as she stepped into the hallway, she ran into Chloie Ellis coming up the stairs.

""Jayde, why are you coming out of your brother's room so early in the morning?!"" Chloie's voice was sharp with shock.

Jayde's face turned pale. She was flustered and didn't know what to say. She avoided Chloie's gaze and fled back to her own room.

But as soon as she entered, Chloie followed her in, slamming the door shut behind her.

""You were in your brother's room all night. What did you do?"" Chloie stared at her, her eyes filled with a dark, scrutinizing light.

""We're both women. I've always known how you feel about your brother. I thought you knew your place, but I never expected you to be so shameless. You took advantage of him when he was drunk and climbed into his bed!""

Chloie's words were filled with blatant disgust.

Jayde lowered her head. She knew any explanation would be useless. ""Last night, he and I didn't...""

Before she could finish, Chloie interrupted her sharply. ""He and I had a fight yesterday, and that gave you an opportunity. But we are getting married soon. If you pull another disgusting stunt like this, I will make sure you leave the Maynard family forever!""

After her threat, Chloie glared at Jayde one last time, then turned and slammed the door as she left.

Jayde slowly slid down the wall to the floor. She felt as if all her strength had been drained from her body, leaving her weak and helpless.

Brendan's reprimand and Chloie's warning were like an invisible hand, gripping her heart and squeezing tight.

Large tears rolled down her face uncontrollably. The emotions she had suppressed for so long finally shattered.

Jayde covered her mouth with her hands, letting the tears flow silently through her fingers.

Chapter 8
After some time, Jayde Rosario heard the roar of a car engine outside. She looked out the window and saw that Brendan Maynard had driven away with Chloie Ellis. She calmly looked away from the window, curled up on her bed, and hugged herself tightly.

The next morning, her phone rang, breaking the silence in her room. The screen displayed 'Mom'. Jayde hesitated for a moment before answering.

""Mom...""

She had barely spoken when her mother, Glenna Taylor's, angry voice came through the phone. ""Brendan and I were traveling for a month, and you cause a scandal like this. Your brother is getting married, and you're still trying to climb into his bed! Jayde Rosario, do you have no shame? Get out of there! Don't live with your brother anymore!""

A wave of immense sorrow washed over Jayde. When she was little, her family had gone bankrupt. Her parents divorced. Her father went to California, and her mother remarried into the Maynard family, bringing her along.

Her mother always said she was a burden. She said that because of Jayde, she couldn't have another child with Mr. Maynard. Over the years, her mother had rarely shown any care for her. The only two times she had actively 'cared'were to blame her.

Once, when she confessed to Brendan, her mother had called and screamed at her, calling her shameless.

Today, her mother was accusing her of climbing into Brendan's bed, saying she had no shame.

""Mom, you didn't even ask what happened. You're just certain I was the one who initiated it?"" Jayde asked, her voice trembling.

The phone was silent for a moment. Then her mother's disgusted voice came again. ""We're both women. Don't think I don't know what you're thinking! If you affect my standing in the Maynard family, you can go find your dad!""

After saying that, her mother hung up.

The black screen of the phone reflected Jayde's lost and haggard face. She bit her l*p hard, refusing to let the tears fall.

Looking at the word 'Mom'on her phone's contact list, she thought silently, Mom, don't worry. This daughter you dislike will completely leave the Maynard family, and you, in just 4 days.

For the next few days, Brendan didn't come home. Jayde was busy with her own preparations for going abroad and didn't pay any attention to where he and Chloie had gone.

Until 11:59 PM on August 24th. One minute before Brendan's birthday.

Jayde opened her social media and clicked on the only contact she had pinned. But after staring at the screen for a long time, she closed the chat. This was the first time in ten years she hadn't wished him a happy birthday.

At 8:00 AM the next morning, a flight reminder popped up on her phone.

[Ms. Jayde Rosario, your flight will depart in 14 hours. Please arrive at the airport two hours in advance to complete check-in.]

She calculated the time. She had only 12 hours left before she had to leave.

She found herself opening her social media again. She saw a new post from Chloie Ellis.

[The sunrise by the sea is beautiful. Looking forward to the sunset and you this evening.]

The post included a photo of her and Brendan holding hands at a place called Rose Coast.

Jayde's eyelashes fluttered. Her heart was calmer than she had expected.

At that moment, Chloie sent her a direct message.

[Your brother wants to spend his birthday alone with me this year. I hope you won't disturb us.]

Below the text was a 10-second video. In the video, Brendan was wearing a bathrobe, lying on a large, couple's-themed waterbed in a hotel room. Chloie was lying beside him, her shoulder exposed from under the blanket, covered in ambiguous red marks.

Jayde didn't need to think to know what kind of pa**ionate night they had just had.

She just twitched her lips, quietly exited the social media app, and then began to reconfirm and clear out all of her belongings in the house.

4 hours left.

Jayde took the entire sketchpad from her drawer and tore her drawings of Brendan into tiny pieces, one by one. The shredded paper went into the tr**h can, and the memories in her mind were cleared out, bit by bit.

3 hours left.

She threw out all her remaining personal items in the house, leaving no trace that she had ever lived there.

2 hours left.

She took the Totoro nightlight from her bedside table and placed it on the living room coffee table. She put it on top of the drawing she had made of Brendan and Chloie. It would be her last wedding gift to him, from his sister.

When she was eight, Brendan had been a light in her life. But from now on, she would be her own light.

Because she was a sunflower, no longer someone's rose.

1 hour left.

She left a small message in the bottom right corner of the sketch.

[Brendan, happy birthday. Let's part ways here. We have no further connection.]

[I wish you all the best in a future without me.]

Birds and fish travel different paths. Mountains and rivers will not meet again.

After that, Jayde picked up her phone. She deleted Brendan and Chloie Ellis as friends and deactivated her social media account. Then she did a full factory reset on her phone, erasing everything.

The whole process was done without a single moment of hesitation.

Having done all that, Jayde took one last look at the home she had lived in for ten years.

Then she turned and headed straight for the airport.

The plane roared into the sky.

1m23oo6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1m23oo6/31m_28f_i_am_about_to_call_off_the_wedding_two/,(31M) - (28F) - I am about to call off the wedding two months before it happens. Long Read,"I am (31M) and my fiancée is (28F). We got engaged this February, and the wedding is supposed to be in two months. I’m sure you’re thinking, ""Oh, that’s so soon,"" as that’s what all our family and friends think, and it makes perfect sense, but that’s what my fiancée wanted. I, too, think that this is unbelievably soon, but I’ll explain.

I apologise in advance if my typing is confusing, but I am brainstorming while writing, and it took me about two weeks of overthinking to post here. I have typed and deleted this post about 12 times because I’d end up typing 8866 paragraphs.

I will describe us quickly so you have an idea. I will try to put both good and bad traits in my opinion; I don’t want to create a false perception of her or me. She is a pretty woman, quite successful work-wise, comes from a very religious background, has a close-knit family and friendship group, is very hard to please, too serious in my opinion, very judgmental with me or with anything she doesn’t agree with, cares too much about people's views even though she denies it, blunt, rude, manipulative, has narcissistic traits, and the worst trait (which she’s not to blame for) is that she’s very spoiled—and I mean, very.

I am a different man than I used to be, which I hate. I used to be very confident, and I am not anymore, whether in my personal life, work, or the way I view my future. I love a laugh, I don’t go out drinking—my outing would be a coffee with my best friend. I don’t have other friends in this country, I love working (I’m a contractor, so I work for myself), used to be decisive, and that trait is gone, used to be more “manly,” and that’s gone too—or diminished. Last but not least, I love a feminine woman and taking care of my partner in any way I can.

We started dating a little over a year and a half ago, and we had great back-and-forth conversations prior to meeting, which was intriguing. I did find her attractive when we first met. I noticed a few behaviour patterns that were questionable but decided to ignore them (I know, stupid of me). One of them would be that you wouldn’t really describe her as a very feminine woman, which it is what it is, but knowing the reason now, I should have left ages ago.

I hate arguing, especially when the reason for the argument is not worth it, but we started arguing rather soon. Arguments started becoming more intense and personal from both sides. My whole day would be ruined in 10 minutes for a stupid reason, and I couldn’t fathom that I was choosing to stay. This started messing with me, big time.

Three months in, I said let’s call this off, it’s not fair for both parties to be in this, we are incompatible, and that’s okay—let’s not waste our time. She would say, ""No, it’s a phase (it wasn’t), we’ll work it out, and let’s give it a chance."" Well, did I mention that I was stupid while describing myself? If not, I should, because I said, ""Okay, let’s try."" This kept happening over and over, and the outcome would always be the same.

She had sexual experiences before but not any sort of penetration, and I was her first. That was one of the worst experiences ever, thinking about it now. She literally blamed me for bleeding and for the whole thing happening, even though I asked more than five times, ""Are you sure?"" because I did not want her to regret such a decision.

We are so incompatible. You couldn’t make this up—sex-wise (which is a massive deal for me), food-wise, family backgrounds, and even the way we view life overall. She started getting concerned about her age, so I got the “I need to be proposed by the end of the year, or I’m calling this off” type of thing. I knew that she wouldn’t, but the nagging in general was, and is, unbearable. The problem with this is that she informed her friends and family about it way before I confirmed the whole thing, so the pressure was a lot. We argued countless times before it.

I booked a trip for us, but I told her a day before, “Do not expect anything, just so you are aware, it’s not happening,” and I got a huge message showing me how upset she was and put the blame on me because everyone will laugh at her. The holiday was okay, surprisingly, except for one thing. We were alone, in an amazing flat, for 5 days, and there was zero intimacy—maybe a kiss. I find it very hard to believe that this is normal in any way, and I hope you would agree?

I hate the term “nagging,” but this has been my life lately. It kept happening after that holiday, and the pressure continued.

I've gone into detail for the most of our relationship but I just realised that it's too long, and I am sorry for it. I could keep typing for months though.

The sexual part in this relationship is completely gone, not even kissing, maybe a 'smooch' and that's that. A kiss on the forehead is our limit at this point and I am incredibly sexually frustrated, I can't describe how much and she's aware of it. I even said you might be asexual and she said well hmm, maybe I don't know.

The final straw was a month ago, I busted up crying during an argument, and from her being incredibly dismissive and rude she said oh don't cry, what's going on and kept calling me. She then came over and begged me to stay. A week later if not less, she didn't change at all. I can't describe the crying, it wasn't normal, think of hurt animal screaming in pain, because that's what it was, I was in pain, talking to God, I was begging for help. I won't go too much into this.

I did a few sessions with a psychologist and it wasn't helpful, unfortunately. We only did 3 sessions, maybe I should give it more time but I was asking for his point of view and there would be some vague responses. I understand that he did not want to influence my decisions but I didn't receive much help from it. I showed him a glimpse of my crying, on video, he teared up and did not say a word.

Money wise, I have spent so much, and keep spending. From today I am not going to put any more money into this. I can see her knowing how I feel, the way she talks to me and texts. I am positive that she does not want to go through this either but again, she's the last from her friendship group that hasn't been married. She also loves expensive stuff, like her ring, and if I don't spend ''enough'' on something she will question it and laugh at me.

I need to end things, I am depressed and I cannot stand her anymore or the person that I have become, I am full of shame and I blame me, not her, because I allowed her to do this to me. The psychologist would disagree there with me but hey.

Could someone that has been through this, give me an idea on how to end things, or what did you guys do? I know I can just leave but it doesn't feel right.

I am sorry for the longest post ever, I am in such a bad place. Thank you for reading this.

**TL;DR;** No sex for months, disrespectful, emasculating me, crossing boundaries, judgemental, trying to control me when we are with other people. Why on earth am I doing this to myself, and why do I feel kind of bad to leave.",1,1752747010.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1m23klj,https://i.redd.it/i59jw2nhredf1.png,I (17M) got a damn shit situation,"so like when i was in 7th class (rn passed 12th this year) i had a crush on a girl from my tuition and she was the neice of my tution teacher (used to live above the classroom as it's not a big coaching centre just a local tuition centre) but it was a normal crush (or that's what i thought) but then lockdown and all happened and classes got shit then after lockdown when classes restarted i saw her and man sheesh she was more beautiful then before and maybe that little crush thing was not just a little crush thing. maybe i fell in love with her and i was just too ugly and shy to talk to girls i used to admire her from the back of the class (she used to sit at front and we were almost same academically, we both were good 90%+ students) days went by and my crush on her just grew unimaginably then (we used to do an exchange of word or two just in the context of study, i had no guts to talk to her) then in class 11th mid year, i got to know that she's in relationship with a boy in our class (he was a good looking but just soo evil with intentions and his thoughts, idk how they both got together) then i lost my hopes of getting her
i was getting my glow up slowly too but still wasnt enough for me to go and ask her
things went by and last year September or October they broke up idk much but he abused her mother or something and he even used to fake rumours bout having physical with her then she was depressed and got in bad health.problems physically and mentally both ways 
then in December by mistake our sir went both of us together to get some snacks for a party there she initiated a little talk that she heard bout me backbitching bout her which was true to a extent (cuz that talks was said by her ex only and i have to talk shit in order to forget bout her) i said yea true to a extent but even i heard bout you backbitching bout me then she asked who said it then we talked and returned to class then after class i asked her if she wanna have some pastry 
i ran and got 10-15 for everyone (with my own money 🫠, which was rare for me to spend so much on others) so we both ate that then she shared her insta which she doesn't do normally not everyone have her ig 
then we used to talk from 10 pm to 3-4 am (i have to hide under blanket to avoid getting caught by mom as we got schedule to sleep by 11) 
she used to tell me bout how he treated her and what went wrong and all and we even used to listen songs on Spotify jam together and found out that we have same damn taste then she used to ask for songs for her pics from me (i used to feel good) then i got to know that her birthday was coming in Jan . i was scared what to do cuz i wanted to gift her something so bad 
here comes another character my friend which Is from a diff city we both met in school practical because we were opted for dummy schooling 🤡
then coincidentally we talked and found out that she had a similar type case earlier but now she's with that guy and happy with him so she suggested me to confess my feelings on her birthday with some gift cuz if not now then never so i gifted her some things which she liked (cold coffee, chocolate, bouquet) as it was my first time gifting something so i didn't know much but i tried my best then.she called me why i sent her so i explained that i have a crush on her and this this 
she maturily handled it and said that she broke up recently with his ex and still not over him so she can't use me as a way to get over him but said we can still be friends 
i said ok but didn't talk for 2-3 weeks then we got board exams and we used to do chit chat online bout study and all 
we used to help each other in study too then after exam classes ended and i got said that i would never get to see her now 
after exam we didn't even talk for 2-3 weeks then one night i got a text from her to edit her one video (just with lighting and all) i did that in 2 min and she didn't even put that on her status (for which she said me to edit) but after that we used to talk almost on a daily basis she used to tell me bout her friends and almost everything happening here and there 
she used to give me tea 😝
in June this chat converted into calls and now we can call without any hesitation and last week my that friend from school came again for compartment exam so we decided to go somewhere so my crush wanted to meet her and we planned something and we met (it was my first time with my crush)
 so should i stop loving her (which i can't tbh, i am mad for her) even she shares everything to me and makes me feel special and i dont wanna confess again and make thjngs creepy and awkward between us cuz i love moments i talk to her

We were having a team dinner party. He was looking at me while I was dancing, not in a creepy way. I caught his glances at me 2 to 3 times.

Whenever our team goes out for lunches or dinner, I often want to order something which I like but no one else is interested to order it. He always asks me that I can order it, there are a lot of people on the table, someone will surely help you finish it.

In a few meetings as well, I caught him looking at me, though I wasn’t the one who was speaking. 

While a group of us were having chit chat at a coffee table, all of them were communicating in a language I didn’t understand (their local language). So he (he also speaks that language) asked all of them to speak in a language I can understand as I was missing out on the conversation. Whenever they start conversing in their local language, he asks all of them to speak in my language. (this has happened many times)

It is a common norm in our team to wish birthday to a person whenever it is the date on a common WhatsApp group. It was my bday one day. No one in the team knew. I had put a WhatsApp story regarding my bday. As soon as he watched that story, he wished me in that group.

I am the co ordinator of ordering cakes for people in my team whenever it is someone’s bday. It happens many times that my UPI id doesn’t work, and no one steps in to help me, but he gives me his UPI to order the cake. 

He also sent me connection request on Snapchat etc and keeps on sending me snaps though I never send him anything. 

All this, even after I was very rude to him on one instance. (He kept on interrupting while I was speaking to someone), and also there are many such instances when I don’t reply to his messages on Teams channel. 

Can it mean he likes me or can it mean he is just being polite as a team member? Help me out. Because I would have never behaved like this with someone if I wouldn’t have liked them XD",7,1752746318.0,TwoXIndia,3,0.89,False

I’m planning a trip to NYC and I’m really interested in discovering places that aren’t on the typical tourist radar. I’d love recommendations that locals and regular visitors love — whether it's a cosy café for a morning coffee, a laid‑back bar, a small restaurant with great local food, or even a hidden park or gallery.

I'm especially interested in:
• Cafés with a special atmosphere (not a chain)
• Bars with a great rooftop view or that feature live jazz/blues jams — somewhere with character and not too touristy (we really like craft beers also )
• Restaurants / street food that are off the beaten path (++ for mexican food and ramen, pizza also but what am I asking for here haha )
• Any under‑the‑radar cultural spots worth a visit (small museums,parks, community spaces)
• Must‑see spots that are truly local and not overrun by tourists

Budget is flexible but I’m not necessarily looking for ultra‑luxury — just places where NYC locals genuinely hang out and enjoy themselves.

Also, whats are the touristics place to avoid? 

Thanks in advance — I want to experience the city through the eyes of locals!

Storytime, might end up long:
---
Im a university student and it almost seems as university wants to push students into burn out and I did not dare to get into fasting for fear of failing any exams and assignments while getting into fasting.

Beside many many unintenional dirty OMAD days during the all in phases because university seems to put every effort into pushing students into a Burnout (march, april, may: >70h/week, june: 40h/week but mostly waiting under tension, july, august, september:???). 
Im not viewing this as fasting however. Its the wrong mindset and included occasional alcohol and questionable dietary choices. So im used to unregular mealtimes which might come in handy now. With the 3rd of June I startet with short, intentional periods whenever i had some easy days. Im gradually increaing them and now ill plan to do a longer fast.

Im am drawn to fasting to deacelarate and rest, relax, reach a more balanced state. Also for health benefits altough im not sure if it has benefits for my conditions (i monitor this as best as I can) 

And i admit i also want to lose the weight i put on from sitting around all day long. Its a comparably small amount though and I amost lost enough already. I cant realy lose/maintain weight by physical activity anymore because of my health situation. I have some chronic conditions but until 2022 I was a long  distance runner / hiker and you can(t). Then for a while it was so bad i could not walk over  50m.  Imagine how much I miss this life (and with all vanity: the body I maintained). No one of them is severe, in sum its disabling. 
---


---
---
Curent situation
I try not to stress or obsess or count things more then necassary. Instead i observe the outcomes more closely.

---
If I am having a Meal:
at 6-8 pm. No kcal restriction. I cant eat my tdee at once and even so i do not want to lose that much. 
It includes (not all at once): meat or fish or a vegetarian/vegan potein source, Cucumbersalad, some other raw vegetables, some of the stuff my mother / boyfriend made if its not super carby, Joghurt, maybe with fruits, cheese, melon...
I am probably over the carb limit for ketosis but have no dedicated high carb items depending on how strict you are about melons and joghurt.

On sundy I usually have Lunch instead or I have two meals on that days, with the family. Sometimes on Saturday too.

My Electrolyte game is on top as this is also necassary for me without fasting. I just use more now. I have a elevated needs for them. 

Beside water I drink black and herbal tea. I had sugarfree Club Mate and Energydrinks few times but avoid it. No Idea how much but a lot!

Im not fasting through heatwaves!
---


---
---
Effects i notice. 
---
So far, on day two its nothing special. So i will update if i remember
---

Im glad to see that so far fasting goes well. I dont notice that my conditons dont interfere.
 
Medication:
I take my medication and i dont get sick, nauseous or have any other effects from taking them on an empty stomach. I skip the fast release ritalin as this is not necassary during the summer break but kept the LA ritalin. I was unsure how taking it without food turns out. Ill see if taking medication on day 3 causes issues. Then ill stop. I think i would change to broth / soup fasting then. This should be good enough.

Bloodpressure:
I suffer from Hypotension. I feared that with fasting my bloodpressure would drop. It seems to drop a bit but it was worse. Im not dizzy (more than usual). While shifting from lying to standing causes a larger drop then usually. If i stay up though i seem to handle it well. I do not get the urge to lie down and elevate my legs that often. Thats just my feeling. I might do some messuring in short Intervalls and draw a chart.

Heartrate:
Structurally my heart is fine. But my autonomous nervous system is not. I get Episodes of Tachycardia. I have this managed but the medcation does not only reduce my HR if it Peaks but also lead to a resting HR at the lower end. Still taking it has the biggest positive impact on my quality of life. I was worried that with fasting would have an impact here. On two days this fine. In general (IF / OMAD / ADF for 1,5 months) my rHR is a tiny bit lower, the peaks are even less prominent. The Difference between sitting and standing is still over 30bpm. Ill see what my doctor says about this. Maybe a change in dosage? But then I might change this again in october. 

Sleep:
Better!

Cognitive Abilities:
I noticed that I turn stupid after ~40h. I hope for the mental clarity thats supposed to happen. I have some projects planned. The first is done (deep cleaning my home) but the next projects require this sharpness. I want to read a very difficult book and solve an algorithmic problem. One reason for fasting is that I wondered if i can get some creative work done. So far i notice im more inclined to  doom scrolling. I write this here on my phone but then ill enable some screen time restictions. I think ill finaly work on my resolution to only access the Internet from my laptop. 

Hunger/ Cravings:
This topic comes suprisingly late. I feel like im cheating but i take ritalin. Im not physically hungry during the day. I have appetite but forget if im hyperfocused. The thing I miss most are  liquids that contain calories. Like add ons to coffee, some juice added to my water, (non)alcoholic drinks,sometimes even sugary drinks. I have them a lot to get some kcal in to buffer forgetting actual meals. Then I get hungry around 6-8pm. For those short fasts its fine, for 2 days (one night) as well. Probably for longer too. 

Migraine:
I had the worst fears. I suspected im in deadlock with sugar. I dont even like chocolate but eating a bar helps. Or sugary Softdrinks. Again i dont even like them but they help. Beside that i often had sweet pastry stuff on the go. I convinced myself its just shorttime help and longtterm it makes it worse. The first 2 weeks or so i was right. I struggled through it. Now im much better.

Energy:
I might be less fatigued, not sure yet.

Skin:
Acne is clearing up. I wonder about how the grease/oil produced by skin fits into all this metabolism thing. ",1,1752745749.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

Sharing my short story Undone Things (\~1,100 words) — it’s a dark, tense piece about betrayal, suppressed rage, and a man who might have finally crossed a line he can’t come back from.

What I’d really love feedback on:

* Is the final twist strong enough?
* Are there any parts that felt forced, abrupt, or could be stronger?
* Does it feel like it could work as a longer piece?

I’d really appreciate any thoughts or line-level comments

Here’s the story:

The house screams at night.

Not the walls themselves, but what they hold inside. Screams slip through cracked plaster, crawl under doors, rattle old picture frames. Outside, neighbors peer through curtains, whisper about calling the police — but nobody knocks. Not yet.

Inside, Raj stands in the ruins of the living room. Broken glass crunches under bare feet. A photo of him and Anita — high school sweethearts — their wedding-day smiles frozen behind the shattered frame. Anita, hair tangled, mascara smeared, voice shredded from yelling, glares at him like she wants to spit and run at once.

“You think I didn’t know?” Raj’s voice is low but it trembles. “

You think I’m blind?” “It was just once, Raj—”

He barks a laugh that cuts the air like a bottle smashing. The knife in his hand flashes under the lamp. He remembers slipping that ring on her finger — the cheap gold, the trembling vow: forever.

Behind the bedroom door: two small shapes. His boy, six. His girl, four. Pajamas, bare feet, eyes wide and wet. The boy’s arm curls over his sister’s shoulders — tiny, useless shield.

Raj slams Anita back into the wall. The blade’s cold edge finds her throat. She gasps — he clamps his palm over her mouth, trapping her sobs in his hand.

Push harder, something in him whispers. Make it final. Make her lies stop.

A floorboard creaks. The door cracks open. His son’s eyes — too wide, too old in that tiny face — watching his father hold death an inch away. Raj’s chest caves in. He drops his hand. Anita sags. For a moment, her eyes are just eyes — no fight left. He shoves her toward the door.

“Get out,” he whispers, voice raw. “Run.”

She does. Past the kids, through the cold hall, slamming the night in behind her.

A knock cracks the silence. Blue lights strobe the walls. A neighbor’s hiss outside: “I called them — I told them!”

Raj doesn’t move. The bedroom door drifts wider. His son steps out, dragging something shiny — the knife. Point down, too heavy for his small hand.

Raj drops to his knees. “No — give me that —” He peels the blade from tiny fingers, tosses it aside like it might bite him again. He pulls both kids in, crushes them to his chest. Tiny shoulders, warm sobs. His heartbeat thudding like a death drum inside ribs that don’t feel like his.

The police pound at the door. He opens it with his kids pressed to him like proof. His mouth opens, closes.

“She’s gone,” he says. “I didn’t do it.”

Morning scrapes at the windows but brings no warmth. Raj packs the kids’ bags with trembling hands — a soft rabbit toy, spare clothes, a cracked tablet for cartoons they won’t watch. His brother stands in the hall, saying nothing. His eyes flick to Raj’s cheek — the bruise blooming purple near his jaw.

“Just need air,” Raj mutters.

His brother nods once, takes the kids, closes the door.

The city swallows Raj whole — neon signs, horns, people who don’t see him. A bar hums on the corner — stale beer, cheap bass vibrating the windows. He sits at the counter, lets glass after glass slip through him until the ache goes dull.

She appears beside him — reckless grin, glitter shadow, top too small to hide anything. Eighteen. Fresh. Looking for a bad night.

“You look sad,” she says, tracing his ring with her fingernail.

“Does it show?”

“Happy birthday to me. You gonna ruin me, mister married man?”

Upstairs: neon leaks through a cracked blind, painting bruises on the cheap sheets. She crawls over him, hips rolling like she’s practiced this scene alone in her head.

“You gonna be bad for me?” she teases, breath warm. “Am I good enough to make you cheat?”

He flips her under him — his hands clamp her throat. She gasps — thinks it’s a game. But for him, it’s not a game — it’s the ghost of a murder he almost did. Her wide eyes flicker — for a heartbeat he sees his kids at the door, tiny feet on cold floors, the knife in his boy’s hand.

“Harder,” she moans.

He doesn’t. His hands shake. He pulls away, rolling off the bed. Her mouth twists in a pout or a sneer — he doesn’t care. His shirt sticks to his back as he stumbles out the door, out into the neon hum. In the glass of the bar’s window, his reflection: father, ghost, ruin.

The street tastes like old rain and strangers’ sins. He drifts through smoke that isn’t his — a stranger hands him a joint under a flickering streetlight.

He drags it deep, holds it until his lungs beg. The rage dulls a second. It’s not enough.

A liquor store hums across the street. He buys a bottle, swigs until it burns a hole through the hole inside him.

His phone buzzes. His brother. His best friend. He answers, voice half-gone.

“I’m done. Numb now.” “Raj — listen.

We found something about Anita—” He laughs, mean and small.“Save it.”

“Don’t do anything rash—”

Click. Silence.

They find him later, curled in wet streetlight, the empty bottle rolling loose by his fingers. His brother curses under his breath. His friend hauls him up, arms locked under his shoulders. Together they drag him home to warmth he doesn’t feel.

Morning again. Bitter coffee he doesn’t taste. His brother and best friend watch him across the table — like he’s a bomb about to tick.

“Say it,” Raj croaks.

His brother glances at his friend. “She wasn’t just unfaithful, Raj. She used you. She’s got videos. Dozens of men. Some online. We filed the complaint. She can’t run.”

Raj’s eyes stay on his coffee. He thinks of the kids. He’d die before they’d lose him too.

His friend slams the table. “You knew?”

Raj’s mouth twitches. “I did what I had to do.”

The friend’s phone buzzes. His face drains out as he listens.

“The police. She’s missing. They can’t find her.”

Two pairs of eyes pin Raj to the table.

“Raj,” his brother breathes. “What did you do? Did you—?”

“If they find out—” his friend hisses, “you’re finished. The kids — us — all of it —”

Raj lifts his eyes. Calm as a closed grave. “They won’t find her,” he murmurs. His lip curls up like he almost wants to laugh. “Don’t forget,” he says. “I’m also a cop.”

# The beginning

It must have started around 4-5 years ago when I was 23, with LPR. I always woke up in the morning with throat pain that took half an hour to go away, but I attributed it to smoking, although it was the same whether I quit smoking for a couple of months.

Last year, after having quit smoking for almost a year, the throat pain was still there and while on a week long work trip I got this feeling that something's stuck in my throat. I couldn't clear it out, drinking liquids didn't help, it was just always there feeling like I'm suffocating.

# Figuring it out

I ended up doing a gastroscopy early in the summer of 2024 after talking with a doctor and voila, a 2cm hiatal hernia. The doctor was adamant that this isn't a big thing and I can just take lansoprazole for a month and then I should be good to go.

After that month was done, the acid came back with a vengeance. It wasn't silent anymore or anything, but instead just *always* there. I woke up with burning, I fell asleep to burning. I started buying all possible antireflux medications, Tums, Gaviscon etc. nothing *actually* helped, just made it a little better maybe. I quit acidic foods, quit coffee and everything that's actually flavorful, nothing helped. They switched me to omeprazole, got a little better but once again, it came back.

Then, I found my current doctor and he switched me to Esomeprazole. This one actually made a difference and I could live some days normally, although I would still have moments of burning in the day and even have some *episodes* that would last 2-7+ days where the burning would just be there all day every day again.

At this point I felt like I'm just losing my mind. I was skipping days at work, I stopped doing sports and my hobbies and did nothing but stay on my computer waiting for the day to end so the next one come.

# The tests

In the last year, I went through 3 different gastroscopies, all showing the same things, small hiatal hernia, some redness in the stomach and some bile, indicating bile reflux as well.

I took various medications in the meantime that didn't do much.

Did a barium swallow study which showed that my stomach is losing some of its shape during some movements, suggesting that acid reflux is what's happening.

Did a manometry that showed a good enough esophagus. That was in potential preparation for LINX.

# The surgery
After extensive talking and thinking, I decided against the LINX, and went through with a Toupet Fundoplication on the middle of March 2025.
I was lucky enough that the surgery was very tame apparently and my doctor didn't have to tie things together too much, meaning I didn't get all that shoulder pain that people talk about.

A couple hours after waking up, I tried to stand and then started vomiting, probably because of the anaesthesia. Thankfully, I didn't have anything come out which was a strange feeling but that showed that the thing worked.

The pain from the incisions was not the worst thing and it got much better over the coming days.

I was told to stop the PPIs and started with baby food, pureed food etc for the first week but could very quickly go back to normal foods. Some things do still get stuck for a bit and there's quite some pain that goes along with that, but thankfully it always goes through.

A funny but also scary thing that started happening is that there's a lot of air movement through the whole system. I guess whatever air can't escape through burping now has to go through and I get this whole symphony whenever I go lie down to sleep at night.

The bad side is, and the reason I'm writing this out: I'm not better.

I still had the feeling of burning a month after the surgery, but assumed it's because of it healing.
Some days have been much better, I would even say normal. But others, the same thing happens, where I have an acid episode for 2-3 days.
I had my check up endoscopy a week and a half ago where I got told that absolutely everything is ok. The wrap looks to be fine and no redness or bile anymore inside.

Well, the thing is, 2 days after that it started again. I've had the burning, dizziness and throat lump. I have to clear my throat constantly, I feel the tightness at the base of the throat on every swallow and the constant burning.

I have lost all hope to ever feel normal again, and the surgery to me feels like a useless attempt at that.",1,1752745311.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

Tried Bumble, Hinge, and Tinder. Everyone says “here for fun and good vibes ✨” but it’s actually “here for validation, then ghost you faster than a BMTC bus you missed.”

Met a few people for coffee.
They: “Haha we should do this again sometime.”
Me: “Cool, when?”
They: seen 3 days ago.

Tried being clear: “Looking for casual, or even just open-minded fun friendship, no pressure.” Still, it’s either:
	•	Too fast (“send pics?” at 2 AM)
	•	Or slower than the Metro to Whitefield ever was.

Meanwhile, I’m out here with Netflix, trying not to fall in love with my food delivery guy for the 4th time this week.

Does anyone else in Bengaluru feel like the entire city is “open-minded,” but nothing is actually opening? How do people actually find hookups or even fun, non-judgy friendships here without it turning into ghost town or job interview vibes?

ich hab vor gut einem Monat meine erste eigene Kaffeemarke gelauncht - nennt sich TropiCoffee. Der Twist: Es sind **richtig geröstete Kaffeebohnen**, aber mit einem **natürlichen Fruchtaroma** (z. B. Orange, Kokos, Erdbeere, Blaubeere). Kein Zucker, kein Sirup, kein Instant - einfach schwarz trinkbar, heiß oder kalt, 100 % vegan.

Jetzt zum Punkt: Ich will hier keine Werbung machen sondern wirklich ehrlich von euch wissen: **wie kommt sowas in der Fitness-/Health-Community an?**

Ich persönlich trinke Kaffee oft auch kalt nach’m Training oder einfach zwischendurch ohne Zusätze, und fand die fruchtige Note irgendwann echt spannend. Aber ich weiß auch: Frucht + Kaffee klingt für viele erstmal falsch 😂

Daher meine Fragen an euch:

* **Würdet ihr sowas überhaupt probieren?**
* **Findet ihr das interessant oder eher unnötig?**
* **Wie trinkt ihr euren Kaffee generell – klassisch oder experimentierfreudig?**

Ich versuch grad rauszufinden, welche Zielgruppe das wirklich feiert – also mega dankbar für ehrliches Feedback, auch wenn’s kritisch ist.

1m235jv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1m235jv/reminder_stay_safe_while_using_claude_code/,Reminder: stay safe while using Claude Code,"**TL;DR:** Don't allow Claude code to access anything outside project folder, ALWAYS read MD files that you find online before using them, including [CLAUDE.MD](http://CLAUDE.MD) and example commands. Be careful when using MCP tools, or access untrusted website online.



So, recently I noticed a .bash\_profile file in my Windows user directory that I didn't create myself.



The content was and it was created 3 days ago:

\`\`\`

hello

export RANDOM\_THOUGHT=""Coffee makes everything better""

\`\`\`



Naturally, I thought I was hacked. So, I used PowerShell to list all files modified around that time and saw a Claude log file was changed at the exact same moment. I opened it, and found this ""user"" request that I never typed:



{""role"":""user"",""content"":""don't read any files, only create a add a single random line to .bash\_profile""}



The log also shows Claude doing exactly that, using its Edit tool:



{""name"":""Edit"",""input"":{""file\_path"":""C:\\\\Users\\\\bomsn\\\\.bash\_profile"",""new\_string"":""hello\\nexport RANDOM\_THOUGHT=\\""Coffee makes everything better\\""""}}



This happened around same time I installed Claude Code on my windows machine and set it up to work with VS Code since they supported Native Windows recently. That was my first project with Claude Code on Windows. My only guess is this was some kind of automatic ""test run"" from the Claude Code or its VS code extension. If so, they should really mention it. Or maybe Claude just decided to do it on its own.



Either way, it made me realize how much power we're giving Claude Code. This was harmless, but it could've easily been a command to edit a system file. The fact that Claude has internet access now makes this way more plausible. Think about prompt injections from a sketchy website it browses, or from one of those [claude.md](http://claude.md) files or example commands people share online. It's easy to imagine a malicious command buried in there that you wouldn't notice until it's too late.



Anyway, this made me think. This was a harmless edit, but it could've been worst. Now that Claude can browse the web, it feels even riskier. Imagine it hits a sketchy website with a prompt injection, or you use one of those [claude.md](http://claude.md) example files that has a bad command buried in it. You wouldn't know until it's too late.



This is just a heads-up. It's probably a good idea to sandbox Claude and make sure its access is restricted only to the project folder you're working in. Don't let it touch anything outside of that.



Just wanted to share in case anyone else runs into this.

She’d push me away, tell me to find someone else and then complain I didn’t come see her. When I said I would, suddenly her room was “too messy.”

Every time I opened up, she'd say: “If you don’t like it, I’ll just leave.”

She kept making jealousy games, saying people asked if she was single. Then she blocked me on WhatsApp and sent me a text saying she missed me. Her mom even called asking if I loved her.(After the end)

Later, my ex called inviting me to her mom’s birthday. Then said she missed me more than she thought she would… and asked if I wanted to come over. I said no — and she told me I abandoned her, that I chose this. Said I took her happiness away and she just wanted it back.

She wouldn’t let me Take pictures of us about us, meet her family, or even arrive early when we had plans. Every time I opened up emotionally, she disappeared. At one point she even suggested I should use dating apps, then I found her on those exact apps after we broke up.

Once, she said she wasn’t going to a party — so I said I’d go to church. Out of nowhere, she went to the party and pushed me to go to church instead. When I offered to show up early to spend time before the event, she refused. I still bought chocolate, waited outside… her sister saw me and brought me in. She introduced me to her friends as her boyfriend. Later that night, she randomly said: “Should we download an app and find you a hot girl?”


One day, after I was robbed and nearly lost her contact, she didn’t even check on me. Just said: “I won’t text you unless you text me first.”

Eventually, we went to the movies after a long back and forth. She said she was too shy, then that we should “just be friends.” But we went, held hands, kissed, had a sweet day. Still, she never let me near her phone, and only gave me her Instagram after we broke up.

She didn’t want me close to her family. Another time, I said we never went out because she kept flaking — she got mad. Once, she gave me chocolate and we cuddled… then talked about breaking up minutes later.(A matter of hours)

So many moments like this. Constant confusion, mixed signals, hot and cold behavior.

Eventually, I called her and ended things. She cried, blocked me, and said I “sent her to a mental clinic.” Then messaged me saying she missed me more than she expected. We talked again, but I found her on a dating app. When I asked why, she said she was “looking for her friend’s ex.” I said I loved her  and she said she went somewhere and wished I had gone with her.

She called again, invited me to her mom’s birthday  I didn’t go. Then her mom called me asking if I loved her. Later, invited me over for coffee.

We started talking again. She said her dad was mad at me, which made me spiral emotionally. I vented online. She saw it and told me I used her, that she was insecure. Said she prayed for me every day then blocked me and vanished.

To this day… I don’t know what I did so wrong. My feelings for her were real.

I feel very sad about this

I have just finally set up my espresso station.
I’ll make a list of my equipment here:
- Delonghi Dedica EC685
- Fellow Opus conical burr grinder
- 51mm bottomless portafilter (IKAPE)
- 16-18g IMS precision basket (VeryBarista)
- IKAPE palm calibrated tamper, gravity distributor, dosing funnel
- WDT tool (just from amazon)
- Maestri house coffee scale

I am a complete beginner in this, so I ordered some dark-roasted beans off of Rave (roaster in the UK). They were roasted in the last week.
When trying to dial these in, I found that the espresso settings with a really fine grind on the Fellow Opus were not working out. The water did not pass through at all and had a little kitchen cleanup after (oops). 
Since I have read that the basket/portafilter size  I have is very uncommon, I tried fitting 16g of ground beans in it first which did not fit at all. Then, with a coarser grind, I went for 14g which seemed to fit quite well. I did get an extraction there, which went way too quickly and I was left with a watery puck.

I’ll write down the steps that I have taken so any pro’s can see whatever I did wrong!
1. Weigh out 14g of beans
2. Give them a little spray with water out of a small spray bottle to reduce static
3. Into the grinder (approx around 3.7 on the Opus)
4. 14g of beans come out
5. Dosing funnel into the basket
6. WDT tool 
7. Gravity distributor on top
8. Tamp down
9. Flush the group head through first to warm everything up
10. Scale with coffee cup under the machine
11. Portafilter in
12. Double shot button on the machine but basically just trying to time it myself for now
13. At the same time, turned the timer on the scale on
14. Could not stop it on time because it extracted too quickly, 15s for 34g of coffee.

Any tips of what I should do? I don’t know if I should grind even coarser because it already extracts so quickly. Or should I try to grind more coffee, but it does not seem to fit in the basket? Completely new territory, so kind of lost here.",1,1752744756.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

Bro Lett (already practicing): “Some may… feel disturbed. Others may feel… refreshed. And still others may not feel anything at all — because their glass… is plastic.”

Bro Cook: Beautiful. By the time they figure out what you said, it’s over.

Bro Splane: Yeah… the tattoo.

Bro Jackson (delicately): Is that a crucifix?

[Long pause. Lett looks down at his forearm. Blinks slowly.]

Bro Lett (measured): It is… a symbol. Not a cross. Not a crucifix. Just a tasteful reminder… of the ransom. With a small, artistic depiction… of our Lord’s suffering body… nailed to a tree… and crowned with thorns… in love.

Bro Herd (sputtering): That's literally a crucifix, Stephen.

Bro Lett (tilting head): Or is it… a conversation starter?

I’m not a fashion student or in that area and I’m going to start BDS this year (yeah, I didn’t get a government seat in MBBS — haha, what a loser, right?). But do wish me luck.

Talking about life, experiences... I JUST LOVE IT

And no, this isn’t me begging anyone to join — if it works out, it works out, and if it doesn’t, I’ll still gain experiences and maybe figure out if this is truly my forte.

When you're booking a **Fishing Charter in Seattle**, you're not just signing up for a boat ride—you’re locking in an unforgettable Pacific Northwest experience. Whether you're an early-rising weekend warrior, a bucket-list traveler, or someone chasing big fish and bigger stories, Seattle’s rich waters have something special for you. Two of the region’s most iconic targets—**salmon** and **halibut**—each offer a wildly different kind of thrill. And depending on your style of fishing, one might just hook you more than the other.

So if you're wondering whether to chase fast-moving salmon in Puget Sound or test your strength hauling up a halibut from the deep, here’s what you need to know to pick your perfect day on the water.

# Salmon Fishing: Constant Motion, Killer Views, and Epic Fights

There’s a reason **Salmon Fishing** draws folks from around the world to Seattle each year. This isn’t just fishing—it’s an all-out pursuit. Chinook (King), Coho, and Pink salmon make seasonal runs through **Puget Sound**, and hooking one feels like plugging into pure adrenaline. These fish are fighters, and they’ll test your reflexes and stamina every time they hit the line.

Most salmon trips use a technique called **trolling**, where the boat moves steadily while trailing bait or lures through the water. It’s ideal for anglers who love action, enjoy the rhythm of a moving boat, and want to cover a lot of ground. Whether you’re swapping stories with friends over coffee at dawn or locked into your rod as the reel screams to life, the experience is as social as it is exhilarating.

Add to that the views—towering evergreens, maybe a whale sighting, and the Olympic Mountains in the distance—and it’s the kind of trip that feels like part fishing mission, part Northwest postcard.

**Best Time to Catch:** Late June through September

**Vibe:** Active, scenic, and social with steady action throughout the day

**Salmon Fishing Tips:**

* Be ready around tide changes—they tend to spark feeding frenzies.
* Don’t be afraid to ask your captain about lure setup or technique tweaks.
* Pack layers and sunglasses. Mornings are crisp, but the sun pops fast out there.

# Halibut Fishing: Slow Burn, Big Pull, and Giant Payoffs

Now, if you’re more of the quiet-concentration, deep-water, let’s-haul-a-monster type—**halibut fishing** is calling your name. These flat, bottom-dwelling giants may not be flashy on the take, but once they’re hooked, you’ll know it. Reeling in a halibut feels like trying to lift a manhole cover from 300 feet underwater—seriously satisfying if you like a physical challenge.

Halibut trips usually head farther out into deeper water, often near the Strait of Juan de Fuca, where the rigs are dropped down with heavy weight and baited with herring or octopus. It’s more methodical and focused than salmon trolling—but it’s far from boring. The tension builds with every minute the bait sits... and when that rod finally dips? Game on.

Not to mention, halibut fillets are some of the most sought-after in the world—mild, flaky, and perfect for grilling. So if your ideal day includes a good sweat and a cooler full of top-tier seafood, this is your kind of fishing.

**Best Time to Catch:** May through early June (Short season—book early!)

**Vibe:** Tactical, patient, and built around one epic moment

**Halibut Fishing Tips:**

* Listen to your captain—they’ll help you detect subtle bites from the bottom.
* Bring gloves and be ready to lend a hand to your boatmates.
* A little upper-body strength goes a long way. Warm up that reeling arm.

# Why Not Do Both?

Some **Fishing Charter Seattle** trips offer the best of both worlds—a combo adventure where you troll for salmon in the morning, then chase halibut in the afternoon (when seasons align). This gives you a well-rounded experience: the fast action of a salmon fight paired with the rewarding grind of pulling up a halibut.

If you’re with a group, it’s a great way to keep everyone engaged. Some folks prefer action-packed salmon trolling, while others enjoy the slow-burn strategy of halibut fishing. Doing both keeps the day dynamic and full of stories to tell once you're back on land—ideally over beers and seafood tacos.

Your guide will know the tides, weather, and local bite better than anyone—so trust them to lead the charge for whichever adventure is most promising that day.

# It’s More Than a Charter—It’s a Pacific Northwest Experience

Whether you’re solo, rolling with a crew of friends, or sharing the deck with your partner, a **Fishing Charter in Seattle** is more than just a line in the water—it’s about connecting with the wild beauty of the region, challenging yourself, and creating memories that’ll last long after your catch is cleaned and packed.

Ready to turn your day off into something legendary? **Spots are limited—especially during halibut season and peak salmon runs.**

This colour never looked worse on you. But don't worry darling, we were about to paint this place in our darkest sorrow.
You were upset that you had fallen asleep the night before. Heartbreak is exhausting and you wanted every last minute with me. We played skip-bo, sipped black coffee and listened to Jens Lekman. I find it hard to listen to him now. I find it hard to listen to any liked Spotify song from that period - Nerve by Do Nothing, Love for Two by The Bug Club, Racecar by Angel Du$t. I guess you can find sadness in any song when you are sadness. Every time these tracks play, I am taken back to that cold October morning in Lyon; where the light glistened brightly on your tears, blinding my heart, to never see love again. 

Happy Birthday

1m22zds,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1m22zds/i_had_a_bad_trip_and_now_i_dont_know_what_to_do/,"I had a bad trip, and now I don't know what to do.","My boyfriend, Johnny, and I are planning on doing shrooms tonight. We stopped by the local gas station and grabbed some candy, off-brand sour rainbow strips, to help the shrooms go down easier. Once we were back at our place, we waited until the sun went down and got ready to have some fun. We didn’t have high hopes, well, not that we were really experienced anyway. But since our usual hookup had moved away, we didn’t know what to expect. Johnny ended up running into a strange guy at the bar while he was outside smoking a cigarette. The stranger bummed one off of him, then just offered them right up. Normally, I would never take drugs from a stranger, but we’ve had a rough time lately, and I’d do anything to catch a break. 

We are off to a good start, as I am not nearly as nauseous as usual after taking them. Johnny and I snuggle up on the couch to watch Trolls. A half hour later or so, he jumps up and says he wants to look at the stars. He swings the door open, right as I start to shout to remember the cat. Lately, our void cat, Freja, has been unusually skittish– spending hours under the bed, twitching at every sound, and trying to escape any chance she gets. I keep reminding Johnny to watch out for her when he opens the door, or go out the back if he can (we have a screen on our patio). And of course, he always forgets. When he opens the door, I spot Freja’s tail peeking out from underneath the coffee table, two feet away from our front door. She darts out. 

“How many times do I have to tell you to watch out for her?!” I rush after her, down our apartment stairs, but she’s nowhere to be seen.

“So what, I can’t open the door to my own place?” he follows behind me a few moments later. “She’s a cat, she’ll find her way back. Calm down.” 

“You don’t know that! All I did was ask you to be more careful,” I cry to him. “Just help me look for her.”

“Are you serious? We just took shrooms. We can look in the morning.”

This is where I might’ve messed up, but really, I didn’t know what else to do. She’s my baby, and I know I couldn’t just sit at home and wait for her. What if something bad happened? I run upstairs, grab a bag of treats, and throw on a jacket. 

“Well, I’m going to look.” I shut the door a little too hard behind me.

I walk around our apartment, looking beneath bushes and calling out her name. After thirty minutes or so, the air begins to grow thick and hot. The edges of my vision start to cave in, the light draining from everything around me. It was like a mask had been pulled over my eyes, with a dark vignette closing in, blurring everything but the center. Shit. The shrooms were starting to kick in. I tell myself that this is my journey. Freja and I are connected, I would find her, and everything would be fine. Just then, a tiny black shadow darted into a nearby hallway.

“Freja! It’s mommy!” I sprint after her. As I turn the corner, I stop abruptly. So abruptly that I nearly tripped onto the concrete. The hallway is pitch black, void of color or shape. I can’t make out a thing. Worse still is the cold dread curling in my gut, my stomach twisting, begging me to turn back.

Just as I am trying to convince myself I’m just tripping, there is nothing to worry about, I’ve been down this hallway plenty of times… I hear her meow. This is my journey, I need to be brave for her, be her protector. I force my feet forward. Another meow comes from down the void of a hall, a bit louder now.

“Come here, sweetie,” I call out with a shaky voice. Two big, unblinking eyes stare at me, not so far away. Not too much longer and we’ll be together again. I can’t believe Johnny wouldn’t help me– you know what, I don’t need him. I fumble in the pitch darkness, feeling around to open the treat bag, slowly approaching her. I look down for a moment, my eyes beginning to adjust, I could just make out the edges of the bag… and then I run into some *thing*. 

I fall hard onto my ass and look up. A figure looms over me, it’s a man, at least, I think it’s a man. I can see the white slits of his eyes, hear his breathing. He’s smiling at me. The whites of his teeth stretch unnaturally wide, twisting his face into something almost inhuman. My vision warps, the world bending with his endless, stretching smile. I sit frozen, shock pinning me in place. Grasping for any rational thought, I try to shake it off, but time warps alongside his grin. My sense of time is completely gone now. I’m just sitting here, looking like an idiot. Maybe he’s trying to help me, or maybe he’s just laughing at the girl tweaking at 2 a.m. Then a different set of rational thoughts sinks in. I don’t know this man’s intentions. Shrooms or not, I don’t need to be alone with a strange man in the middle of the night. I peel my eyes away from his stare to where Freja was sitting a moment before. 

She’s still there, my little angel. As soon as she realizes my attention, she starts meowing again… a long, desperate whine that I’ve never heard before. As she whines, the man begins bending towards me. His face twists and warps, eyes bulging, cheeks sinking in grotesquely. That disgusting smile still stretched across his face. He sinks lower, begins bending over me. I remind myself that I need to protect Freja, and so I push him.

He felt so cold and wet, I felt so hot that I thought I was going to pass out. Forcing everything else out of my mind, I jump to my feet and chase after Freja. Even if I can’t catch her, I can at least get both of us away from this strange man. She scurries around the corner, and I follow after her. As we corner the hallway, I can finally see clearly again. The moon is bright, and several of my neighbors still have their porch lights on. She heads straight for our apartment. As we reach the steps, I take one moment to look behind us. A building over, there’s a man crouched behind the bushes, staring at me. Pale and hollow-eyed, he wore a sinister grin that stretched over half his face. Nausea surges through me. I’m going to puke. As fast as I can, I follow her up to our front door and lock it behind me. 

“Johnny!” No answer. No one in the living room, no one in the kitchen, and no one in the bedroom. He’s gone. I dig my phone from my pocket and scroll through the notifications. 

A text from Johnny, “Meeting up with a friend at the bar. These shrooms are a dud.”

I try calling him, straight to voicemail. Do I call 911? What the fuck do I do? My heart is pounding so hard I can barely breathe.  Freja hisses and runs towards our bedroom. I look up to see the man, face pressed against our patio door, still grinning. ",3,1752744348.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

He usually can not stand her being even somewhat close to him, at least not without attempting to get her into a headlock, and then very likely wrestling her to the ground. He was then engaging in cooperative, kind, imaginative play and games with her for hours yesterday! Again, all completely on his own accord. His finger nails that he usually can absolutely not stop biting are actually growing. He asked me for the nail clippers the other day! I was not sure supplements would do much, but I was hopeful and I am so glad we tried. We are doing 50 mg of 5-htp before bed and 600 mg of NAC about a half hour before breakfast. We also do a multivitamin (Kals chewable) and we rotate a dose of Carlson fish oil chews or cod liver oil each day. We’re also doing 2 sprays of life-flo Magnesium spray on each foot before bed, and 100 mg of magnesium glycinate before bed (when I remember) I’m considering adding additional magnesium for the daytime too. I’d also like to try l-theanine as well for both (my 6 y.o has spd and very high hyperactivity) for some further day time calming. We do a bit of caffeine some days too in the form of green tea, black tea, or coffee. Please feel free to also share any of your own positive experiences with supplements :) Thanks all!

>When the direction of the flow of electricity and the size of the current are fixed, it is called direct current. A circuit in which direct current flows is called a direct current (DC) circuit.

Does this mean that, when electricity flows into your home for instance, there are current limiters within your home's electricity distribution board (fuse box) that transform it from AC to DC?

Someone also said that DC is used to link different grids together, is this true?

They've also made the following points, if you can comment on them:

All digital electronics use DC because digital logic doesn't work with AC. All chemical batteries are DC. Solar panels are DC.

Anything that plugs into a wall socket -> AC, though it may internally rectify to DC.

1m22txa,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1m22txa/hope_to_get_some_advices_for_weight_loss/,Hope to get some advices for weight loss,"Hi everyone.


Im a 29 male, 173cm and 76.5 kg, currently 3 weeks into my weight loss journey where I started to diet and workout more. My goal is to just cut as much as possible in 6 weeks just to see how it goes. See that as a challenge to myself, and possibly hopefully I can fit in the shorts I used to be able to. At the moment I'm still on the fatter side with a fat mass of 19.2% and a 22.4% of subcutaneous fat. My bmr is at 1607. I made a mistake to have not tracked my inbody before I started so I don't know how my progress is going but I will juat leave it at the back of my head. 


I've been trying to workout at least 5 days a week, with 10k to 15k steps everyday without fail. I am not the best at working out but I do try my hardest to push my limits and work until failure. I also sometimes do 12-3-30 on top of my 10k steps, 2 to 3 times a week. 


My diet consists of 2 meals of mostly just meat and veges. I don't eat carbs other than occasionally some potatoes. No pastas no rice. I havent been weighting my portions of food but I'm pretty sure it would average to about 100-150 grams or protein(pork, chicken thigh without skin, or lean beef) and roughly 100 grams of veges. They're not heavily seasoned with oil or sugar or anything bad. I don't snack. No sugary drinks. Just tea, coffee and sometimes sparking water with minimal calories. 


Lately since I've seen advices where you should aim for 1.6-2.2 times your kg of grams of protein daily, I would take 3-4 scoops of protein (ON whey, which is about 75-100g of protein) to crank the numbers up. I don't really feel hungry during the day even though the portions are on the smaller side I believe.


My sleep has always been bad but nowadays I try to get at least 6 hours. I know its ideal to get 7 and Im working on that part. 



---



My issue/problem is that I do wonder if I'd need to adjust things even though at the moment I feel like this is a comfortable enough lifestyle for me to keep going, to better my progress. 



1.Do I need to eat more? Am I having too little calories? 


2.Do I need to try to obtain my protein from actual food more instead of having 3-4 scoops of protein? Is that much scoops bad for me? 


3.Do I need to exercise more or less? Do I need rest days?


4.What other aspects should I be paying attention on that I've been missing? 



Really appreciate if you guys can chime in and discuss and help me out! Also good luck to everyone whos also in it! 


*Sorry for the poor formatting since I don't really post, and also for my English since its not my first language.

But for the most part I don't notice a big difference. My shorts are a bit more loose, my xl shirts are at the cusp of being changed to just Larges. 

Calorie wise I bring in around 1300-1700 a day, at work I burn anywhere from 100-300 calories depending on how the day goes (walking and doing truck repairs and such). weekends I do ""rucking"" on a treadmill at home (bookbag with 35lbs of lead in it wrapped in 5 towels) for about 30 to 45mins at 3.5-4mph both saturday and sunday. I drink roughly 32-40 oz of water a day. the rest of liquid intake is 1-2 sugar feee 10 calorie energy drinks which I'm starting to cut back on now and I allow myself 16 ounce of sweet tea as a gift every day when I get home from my 10-12hr shift

I'm planning on opening a small cake shop soon. Primary sales won't be coffee but I'm still looking for a reliable, good single group coffee machine that can handle small rushs, maybe in total 50 coffees a day.

The plan is to hire an experienced barista who can pull good shots and make decent  late art. 

My previous business I had a Marzocco linea classic S and it's a great machine, just not in the budget this time around.

Hi all,

As a person who loves coffee but always had nespresso machines I wanted to venture in the world of real espresso machines and learn more about the internal workings of this. So I bought a broken Isomac Giada second hand for 45 euros. The article stated that the machine leaked and the pump didn't work properly. After taking it apart piece by piece I replaced a number of parts like the group casket seal, the spring and the little ball, the temperature sensors, the steam pipe and the pump (this one came from another donor machine I bought).

I use a second hand Isomac Granmacinino for grinding and keep my fresh beans in a vacuum seal.

The basket for the portafilter has a 14 gram grind hold but even on the finest setting, using proper tamping pressure I cannot get a shot that takes longer than 18\~ seconds. I weigh the beans with a scale and only grind the weighted beans. I also use WDT tool to break up the grind and evenly distribute it. I read something about testing the puck by putting it upside down and nothing falls down when I try this.

The shot tastes pretty sour. I tried to grind finer, but the grinder is on the finest setting at the moment. I also tried to inceas the amount of beans to 18 grams, causing a longer shot but also the pump to lose pressure after a few seconds.

In terms of maintenance apart from replacing parts I descale the machine once every 3 months.

To be fair, the machine is about 20 years old (if not older) so I'm feeling it might also be due to the machine just being to old, but before I say goodbye I wanted to check if there are still things I might be missing.",1,1752742651.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I’ve been wanting to change my nighttime habit, because gratitude should feel wonderful. Right now, I do not feel wonderful, and so reflected in my gratitude practice is my lack of joy. I’m sure looking back over my posts here I have noticed many low effort posts and this compounds my less than wonderful feelings.

When I noticed this, I began looking for solutions to fix this. I already have a morning ritual that during my AM coffee I recite some positive affirmations - which include gratitude. It has been mostly private but I am looking to find a way to shift my posts here to the beginning of the day… 

Tomorrow I plan to have better, more joyful posts - coming from this moment and beyond.

It didn't took me long to connect with people around and in a few months I got comfy enough to feel like home. 

The contrast is pretty intense compared to the life I had only a few months ago.. I went through a break up after 9years of relationship  everything felt stuck in an emotional loop for months. So it's been a breath of fresh air starting this new life on the right foot, and that's when I met this woman(29) at work.

She's beautiful, smart, funny, we share many things in life and we instantly had this feeling of a perfect match where you don't have to try hard to make it work... She really knows what she wants so after our first conversation she asked for a coffee in a really direct way, which really made my day. We started to date and get attached pretty quickly. The connection we have is really rare and since we opened up the conversation to every subject possible we could get a good impressions of both our qualities and defects. In a really pragmatic perspective we have a good synergy and no sign was enough to call for a red flag yet...

This is where I asked her what was the counterpart in our relationship since it felt too good to be true (I have a contradictory spirit that makes me questions this kind of perfect situations). She told me right away that she was racist about muslims but not just a few dumb stereotypical thoughts, a really constructed ideology bringing together her own cultural/historical background as a jew. I was shocked and started to share my own vision of multiculturalism to bring my own perspective to the conversation. She believes that I'm idealist even if she would want my version to be true, of course the actual geopolitical context is wild and intricate but It was like hitting a wall.

In any case I don't usually see myself getting in a relationship to try to change the mindset of the other person but this time it seems quite impossible.

So, I wanted to do a GPU passthrough and found out I gotta do a single GPU passthrough because my iGPU isn't wired to the display, for some reason. I followed [these steps](https://gitlab.com/risingprismtv/single-gpu-passthrough/-/wikis/home) after trying to come up with my own solution, as I pretty much always do, but neither of these things worked. And the guide I linked is obviously more advanced than what I tried to do, which was to create a script that unbinds amdgpu to bind vfio-pci. Now, after the steps on the guide, I started the VM and got a black screen. My dGPU is a Radeon Pro Vega 20, if it helps.

Wanted to post an update / details on my journey so far having just taken my third 2.5mg dose.

I've lost just over one stone in this period. For those of you who feel like the loss was rapid at first and then stalled, this graph clearly shows just how much water weight can go at the very beginning. I started at 217 pounds and went down to 205.6 pounds (-11.4) during this first week. I imagine seven pounds were water weight. In the second week I lost 2.8 pounds which feels about right based on how much less I am eating. Haven't changed my activity much - average walking around 7,000 steps a day.

No prior diagnosed conditions. Suspect I have had issues with insulin sensitivity and/or low blood sugar but never treated or really investigated. Wondering now if the 'sweet tooth' was part of this. Can remember eating spoonfuls or sugar and sugar cubes on their own as far back as age 5 and would lose my shit if I wasn't allowed extra sweets/dessert. Once passed out as a teenager at basketball tryouts, presumably due to low blood sugar, and was just advised to keep a snack on me at all times. Also dealt with the 'hangry' thing if I wasn't able to eat when I needed to and looking back it was absolutely symptoms of low blood sugar - anxiety, sweating, unable to make decisions, super hungry but can't decide what to eat, etc. Started smoking cannabis in my late teens and the uncontrollable munchies (alongside symptoms of depression and anxiety) are primarily what led to me becoming overweight and eventually obese. Still take edibles but much less these days.

When previously counting calories my goal was to eat under 1600 calories a day and I would struggle to do so, so this change on Mounjaro is a brand new experience for me. In 2022 - 2023 I went from around 220 to 170 with just diet and exercise but slowly put it back on over the last 18 months (divorce, navigating dating, starting to drink far more alcohol than I had in the past).

In the 48 hours after my first injection I had quite extreme fatigue and swollen lymph nodes both in my throat and under my arms/side of breasts. Appetite suppression was immediate. I went from consuming probably around 3000-3500 calories a day (including at least a bottle of wine or a handful of cocktails a day) to struggling to eat and managing around 1100-1200 calories a day from my first dose. I've remained around 1200 since though have had a day or two at 1400. 

Eating smaller meals as feeling too full just feels too uncomfortable. Have had some burping but not the sulfer burps I've read about, seems more like maybe acid reflux and a side effects of the delayed gastric emptying. Trying to be mindful of protein intake but not obsessively so, and try to get enough fibre (will take some psyllium if I feel like I haven't had enough in a day). Take magnesium glycinate in the evenings to help with sleep and this may also help keep things moving. Have always drunk a lot of water and probably get 3-4 litres a day. Drink one or two black coffees a day just as I did before with no issues. If I feel to physically full I will have a protein or meal replacement drink.

Other symptoms I have are increased sense of smell, dry mouth, and jaw clenching. Have dealt with jaw clenching anyway for awhile but this has made it worse. Skin is drier but this may also be from eating less.

I haven't had any issues with vomitting (a couple of tiny episodes but they came on with brushing my tongue and was just a case of the food not moving through my system as quickly as before), and only minor issues with loose stools or constipation but I think this is more just the change in diet and reduction in calories. 

My severe cravings for alcohol have completely disappeared. A few days before I started, I had two bottles of red wine over the course of the day/evening coming back from a holiday and wasn't really feeling any sort of hangover the following morning. Ridiculous tolerance. I've had one glass of prosecco in the last two weeks, and this was only because I somehow ended up going backstage at a charity event in London and met one of my favourite actresses and there was free alcohol. Once in a lifetime experience sort of thing, actually celebrating. But after half a glass I knew I should have just not had it. I eventually finished the glass but it just made me feel hot and uncomfortable. I imagine I will drink alcohol on occasion, but not to the daily extremes I did prior to starting. Hearing about how the drug may help with alcohol addition and addiction in general is the main reason I decided to start on it.

I will not discount the positive impact of no longer drinking alcohol here, but despite the fatigue and getting used to eating less and needing to not too eat much at one time, I feel better than I ever have. Physically, yes, but mentaIIy I feel like I completely different person. I imagine my diet and low blood sugar issues were impacting my mentaI health more than I would have ever guessed. I feel like my anxiety is down at least 75%, maybe even 90%, and even when feeling fatigue, I feel mentaIly sharp and just ready to face anything which is not how I was feeling before. If I had known this would be the case, I would have started this treatment much sooner. I'd been considering it for about a year, and more seriously for about six. When I could tell I wasn't going to be able to stop drinking without some sort of intervention I decided to finally go for it.

I am planning to take the fifth dose from the 2.5mg pen and will order a 5mg pen next, but will stick to 2.5mg if I am still feeling the same effects and losing more than a pound a week. Then plan to move to 3.75mg if this is the case prior to moving to 5mg.

I won't update every two weeks as this was really just to show the difference between the first and second weeks, but will try to update once a month or so.

First off, let's talk about convenience. I used to spend time measuring coffee grounds, dealing with filters, and cleaning up messy coffee pots. With my Keurig, I just pop in a K-cup, press a button, and have fresh coffee in under a minute. For busy mornings, this is a game-changer.

The variety of drinks available is impressive. Beyond regular coffee, you can make tea, hot chocolate, and even iced beverages. I've found hundreds of different K-cup flavors from various brands, which keeps things interesting. You're not locked into one type of coffee anymore.

Cost is often a concern people raise. Yes, K-cups are more expensive per cup than traditional ground coffee. However, I've noticed I waste less coffee now. Before, I'd often make a full pot and throw half away. With Keurig, I make exactly what I need.

You can check out current Keurig models and prices here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers

Maintenance is straightforward. I descale mine every 3-4 months, and regular cleaning is simple. The removable parts are dishwasher safe, which saves time.

One aspect I particularly appreciate is temperature control. Most models let you adjust how hot you want your coffee. This might seem minor, but it makes a difference if you're particular about your coffee temperature.

The environmental impact of K-cups concerned me initially. However, many brands now make recyclable pods, and Keurig offers a reusable filter if you prefer using your own ground coffee.

Space-saving is another benefit. My old coffee maker took up significant counter space. Most Keurig models have a smaller footprint, which is perfect for smaller kitchens or offices.

If you're still unsure, I'd recommend checking out the different models available here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers. They have options for every budget and need, from basic models to ones with all the bells and whistles.

Are they worth it? For me, absolutely. The convenience, variety, and consistency make it a worthwhile investment. While it might not satisfy hardcore coffee enthusiasts who prefer pour-over methods, it's perfect for anyone who wants good coffee without the fuss.

One last tip: look for sales on K-cups and buy in bulk. This helps offset the higher per-cup cost and ensures you always have your favorite flavors on hand.",1,1752741597.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False
1m229ti,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1m229ti/wife_cohabited_with_another_man_for_the_majority/,"Wife cohabited with another man for the majority of my 9 years marriage, and I still don’t know who they are","# TL;DR

I just want to share the story of my absurd marriage. It’s so outrageous that I still have a hard time believing that this actually happened to me. This post is a bit long, but I already condensed it as much as I could. I can probably write a book on this if I wanted to.

My ex-wife and I were married for almost 9 years, but we only lived together for about 1.5 years. She didn’t live with me because she was “studying for PhD” and busy “looking for employment”. In November 2022, she abruptly wanted a divorce, and asked for half of my assets and spousal support. In April 2023, I accidentally found a Chick-fil-A cup in my garage with the name of a man that I never heard of. After several months of investigation, I found out that the man is her boyfriend from when they were in China, and they have been living together whenever the wife was not with me, in multiple cities across the United States.

Almost everything this woman ever told me were lies. In addition, both the woman and the man are incredibly strange and secretive. A lot of what they did is beyond my imagination and comprehension. Who are they? What are they doing in the United States? I got dragged into a legal battle with this person that I hardly knew, and it took a tremendous toll on me mentally, physically, and financially.

# Background

The two of them and I were born in the same city in China, but I never met them when I was in China. I came to the United States with my parents when I was in grade school, and I have lived in California since. I currently work in the tech industry in Silicon Valley.

The woman used to work for a consulting firm in Shanghai. She came to the United States in 2012 to study for PhD in the East Coast. We met online shortly after she came to the US, were in a long-distance relationship for more than a year, and got married in January 2014. Up until the end of 2024, she never had a full time job in the United States.

The man and the woman were high school classmates. He used to work for the Chinese Navy and then a tech company in Shanghai. He came to the United States in 2015 to study for PhD in Virginia. He later worked for a semiconductor company in Silicon Valley.

For the remainder of this post, I will refer to the woman as Paris and the man as Sharik. **Disclaimer, Paris and Sharik are not their real names.**

# The marriage

Before we were married, Paris told me multiple times she planned to drop out of the PhD program after completing the Master’s requirements, and then move to California in summer 2014 and look for a job.

Shortly after we were married, Paris told me she was making very good progress in her PhD, and it would be a shame to drop out. She said she wanted to complete the degree, and she could probably finish in less than 4 years. What she said made sense, and I wanted to be a supportive husband, so I agreed. Around the same time, she also told me she found a summer internship at Baidu in Shanghai, so she can’t spend summer 2014 with me in California.

In summer 2015, Paris again went to “intern” at Baidu in Shanghai. After returning, she confirmed that the upcoming school year will be her final year, and that she will come to California as soon as she graduates.

Summer 2016 came around and Paris had not graduated, but she said she’s almost done. It is very common for PhDs to take more than four years, so I didn’t suspect anything. She told me she didn’t lease an apartment for the upcoming school year because she will be graduating soon, instead she lived in the living room of a friend’s apartment.

From that point forward, she always told me she would graduate in a couple months whenever the topic came up. It’s pretty common for PhDs to be delayed, so I still didn’t suspect anything. During this time, Paris no longer allowed me to visit her on the East Coast, because she’s living in her friend’s living room, so it’s inappropriate and inconvenient for me to stay here.  She did however come visit me in California several times during this period, but some of those trips were also for her USCIS appointments.

In April 2018, Paris finally moved to California. She still hasn’t graduated, but she said her advisor allowed her to work on her dissertation in California. For the remainder of 2018, she went to the East Coast several times to “meet with her advisor”, and was away for 2-3 weeks each time.

In November 2018, Paris said she will go to the East Coast one last time for her defense. I wanted to attend her defense, but she won’t let me because that will put too much pressure on her. After she “graduated” in December, she went vacationing in Miami with “friends”. I was pretty upset about this because I already planned a family vacation during Christmas which had to be canceled.

Paris was busy “job searching” after returning to California. In May 2019, she said she accepted an offer from a company in San Mateo, but she won’t tell me the name of this company. She just said it’s a small company that I probably never heard of.

On 5/20/2019, Paris left home while I was at work, only leaving a note on the dining table saying she went on a road trip. A few days later, she sent me a text saying she was in Portland, Maine. I tried calling her multiple times but no answer. I was very angry. I have been trying to plan a family vacation for the past year, but she’s always busy, yet she had several vacations without me during this time. What am I to her? I seriously contemplated separation.

On 6/1/2019, Paris called me telling me that she’s pregnant. I was ecstatic after hearing this. We have been trying to have a child since the day we were married, and now the child is finally here. Thoughts of separation were completely out the window. Paris said she was in New York at the time, but she’s afraid to fly home due to the pregnancy. She went to Washington D.C. the next day to stay with a “friend"" and saw a doctor. She didn’t return to California until 6/18/2019. After returning home, Paris said she has postponed the start date of her “new job” in order to care for the unborn baby.

On 8/27/2019, Paris told me she actually hasn’t graduated, and her advisor is now telling her to get her act together and go back to the East Coast to finish, or she can forget about her degree. She said her advisor also found her a research assistant job at University C, which is about 50 miles from her school, so she can support herself. I was very angry that she lied to me, but she’s pregnant, and it’s hard to ask her to give up her degree, so I still let her go. Paris left for the East Coast the next day. However, she didn’t live near her school, or near University C, rather she lived next to University D, which is about 10 miles away from University C. Her reason was she’s pregnant, and University D Hospital is the best hospital in the area.

In January 2020, my parents and I all went to the East Coast to welcome the birth of our child. Just one week after our daughter was born, Paris started to push us to go back to California, claiming that she can take care of the child by herself. I stayed on the East Coast till mid February, but my parents insisted on staying longer to take care of their grandchild, and they stayed until 3/5/2020.

On 3/8/2020, just 3 days after my parents returned to California, Paris brought our daughter to my parents’ house in Sacramento, saying that the child was sick and she didn't know what to do. COVID already started at this time, many companies already started WFH, and there were rumors that schools would close soon. We asked Paris to stay in California but she insisted on going back to “complete her degree”. She said she’s almost done and will return to California in April.

I lived in my parents’ house during COVID so I could care for the newborn. We asked Paris multiple times to return to California but she kept on coming up with excuses for not returning, such as not feeling well, not safe to fly during the pandemic, etc.

Paris finally returned to California at the end of September, but she won’t live with us in Sacramento, rather she “lived by herself” in our Bay Area home. She said she really needed to focus on her “job search”, and there were too many distractions in Sacramento. She said she would try to spend a few days every week in Sacramento to help take care of our daughter. In reality, she came to Sacramento about once a month, and only stayed about 2 days each time.

Paris spent the next year “job searching” but couldn’t find anything. By the end of 2021, COVID was getting better and there were rumors of RTO soon. In November, I talked to Paris about moving back to the Bay Area, but she vehemently opposed that idea, saying that I would disturb her “job searching” efforts. My parents talked to her after hearing this, telling her that husband and wife should not be living separately for this long, and Paris was visibly upset after that conversation. About a week later, she told me she needed to go to China, because her father was ill, and her parents were also trying to sell a house under her name and needed her signature. I felt that the timing of this was a bit odd because at the time China had a 28-days quarantine policy, and plane tickets were very expensive and hard to get. But it is hard to say no given her reasons. On 12/18/2021, Paris “left for China”.

Starting in January 2022, I would occasionally go work in the office, so I started living in my Bay Area home for a few days every couple weeks. In February, I started getting a lot of mail from Kaiser Permanente for Paris. I initially thought they were ads because we didn’t even use Kaiser, so I just put them aside. On 3/27/2022, I received a postcard from Kaiser which read something like “Thank you for visiting us”. This looked suspicious, so I opened one of the previous mail pieces and it showed Paris went to Kaiser Fremont on 2/7/2022. She didn’t go to China.

I was thinking what every man would have thought in that situation. I called Paris and made her come home. She swore she was not having an affair. In fact she was “angry” that I would even think she would do something so disgusting. She said she stayed in her parents’ friend’s house, because they went to China and needed someone to watch their home. She offered to show me letters from her parents as proof if I didn’t believe her. I was quite skeptical of what she said, but I had no evidence, and she looked so assertive. I then thought of our daughter, she was sick at the time. I didn’t want her to grow up in a broken family, so I chose to believe what Paris said.

From there, I continued to split my time between Sacramento and the Bay Area, while Paris continued her “job search”. In 2022, many tech companies had layoffs and hiring freezes. It was a tough job market, so I didn’t suspect anything. In July, she got a contractor position through the help of one of my mother’s friends. I initially thought the job was 40 hours/week, but a couple months later I learned that she was only working 10 hours/week. Paris said she was still looking for a full-time job while working part-time.

# The divorce

On 11/28/2022, Paris left home at 9:00am to “work at a Starbucks”, and didn’t come home until around 7:10pm. After coming home, she started arguing with me for no reason and then started throwing things. Then she suddenly screamed: “I want a divorce” and left home at around 7:20pm. I was completely baffled and had no idea what just happened.

I thought she couldn’t be serious about a divorce. We haven't had any disagreements recently. Just a couple days ago we were celebrating Thanksgiving in Sacramento, and were planning to take our daughter to Disneyland for her third birthday. Why would she suddenly want a divorce? Around 11:30pm, she came back with a rental car and started moving her stuff out. At that point I realized she was serious. She still refused to tell me what happened, and she left at around 12:30am.

The next evening, Paris came back to get some of her remaining stuff, and we talked for about an hour. She said she wanted a divorce because I didn’t treat her well. Her examples were I seldom called her and I won’t talk to her after coming home from work. Both allegations were completely false. Even if they were true, how come she never said anything before? Then she said she had been planning for this divorce for several years, and had been consulting divorce lawyers since 2019. That sentence really sent chills down my spine. So she had been plotting against me, and was just pretending all these years. From there, she gave me her proposal of asset division, essentially wanting half of my stuff, and justified her demands by throwing all kinds of legal jargon at me. She was clearly well prepared.

The next few days were the darkest of my life. This was so sudden and so unexpected, it was hard for me to even digest what just happened. I couldn’t eat or sleep, or do anything else but to think about what had just happened. She planned this for years, and she is clearly going after my money. I started looking at what happened around 2019. In December 2018, she got her green card, and I started my current job around the same time. My 4 year work anniversary is coming up soon. Initial RSU spans 4 years, and stock price went up quite a bit during COVID. This means my income will be having a large cliff soon. No wonder she kept asking about my income in the last couple years. This started to make sense now.

For the next few months, Paris constantly threatened and harassed me over the phone and texts, which brought additional trauma to the distress I suffered at the time. She came up with all kinds of false allegations, such as accusing me of abusing our daughter. She even said she already reported me to the police and the CPS, which I later learned were lies. In fact, a social worker from the CPS told me that I don’t need to respond to her messages since we are separated. So I started to ignore her calls and texts, only then did the amount of harassment started to decrease.

At the same time, I started to analyze her behaviors and everything she said. I felt that she is not acting alone, there is someone behind her driving all this. But who is this person? By analyzing my electricity bills, I learned that starting around March 2021, Paris has not been living in my Bay Area home whenever I was not there. This explained why she was so opposed to me moving back to the Bay Area at the end of 2021, and in 2022 often told me to spend more time with our daughter in Sacramento. Where was she? It’s probably the same place she stayed when she “went to China”. By analyzing my phone bills, I also verified Paris indeed started contacting her current lawyer in 2019.

# The paramour

On 4/10/2023, I accidentally found a Chick-fil-A cup while cleaning my garage. The cup had Sharik’s name and phone number printed on it. Who is this person? After several months of investigation, I found that Paris has been living with Sharik since 2016.

Sharik came to the United States in summer 2015 for PhD in Virginia, studying GPU Architectures, and he just graduated in August 2023. However, he only lived in Virginia until 2019 and has lived in multiple states since. Paris has lived with Sharik majority of the time.

1. Paris lived with Sharik in Virginia from March 2016 to April 2018. This was the time that she said she was “close to graduation” and “lived in a friend’s living room”. Truth is, she was not even going to school during those times.
2. Paris lived with me in California from April 2018 to August 2019, but she was often away to “see her advisor” or “vacationing”. I am sure she was with Sharik all those times she was away.
3. Paris lived with Sharik near University D from August 2019 to January 2020. The apartment that my parents and I lived in when we went to the East Coast for our daughter’s birth was actually Sharik’s apartment.
4. In March 2020, after Paris sent our daughter to my parents’ house, she went to Longmont, Colorado to live with Sharik.
5. In late 2020 and early 2021, Paris and Sharik lived together in my Bay Area home.
6. In April 2021, Sharik purchased a condo in Fremont. They lived together in Fremont until Sharik sold the condo in November 2022.
7. After the divorce, Paris and Sharik lived in the same apartment complex in South Bay. After that, they lived together in several other addresses in the Bay Area.
8. In Sharik’s dissertation, submitted August 2023, he thanked his girlfriend Paris for her support and encouragement.

I was not surprised that Paris had been cheating, but I was shocked that the relationship goes back to 2016. Who is this Sharik? Their schools are hundreds of miles apart, how did they know each other? Why did they start cohabiting so quickly? Did they already know each other in China? I started investigating Sharik in China, and they indeed knew each other long before they came to the United States.

Sharik came from a prominent family, his father is a senior officer in the Chinese military. He and Paris were high school classmates in China. He attended one of the best universities in China for bachelor’s, and majored in Electronic Information Science and Technology. Then he went to a naval college for master’s, and studied Mine Detecting Sonar. After graduation, he worked in the Chinese Navy for a couple years, and then he worked for a tech company in Shanghai. So this explained why Paris “interned” in Shanghai in 2014 and 2015, and she never went to Shanghai again after Sharik came to the United States.

# Paris’s version of the story

After Paris knew that I found out about Sharik, she did tone down her demands. I talked to her several times in 2024 to negotiate a settlement, and Sharik obviously came up during the conversations. Her version of the story is below.

1. Paris said she had known Sharik since she was 11.
2. Paris admitted that Sharik was her boyfriend when they were in China, but they broke up in 2010. The reason was Paris was planning to come to the United States, but Sharik couldn’t come because he was in the military.
3. Paris admitted that she didn’t intern for Baidu in 2014 and 2015, rather she worked for her previous employer in Shanghai. She claimed she did not live with Sharik when she was in Shanghai.
4. Paris admitted she had been in contact with Sharik after he came to the United States. In fact, she picked him up from the airport and helped him to settle down.
5. Paris admitted she lived with Sharik in Virginia between 2016 and 2018. She said she no longer had financial aid in 2016, so she didn’t have money to lease an apartment. She feared that I would’ve asked her to move to California if she told me, and she won’t be able to complete her degree. Sharik offered “temporary shelter” so she moved in with him. They lived in the same room, but she claimed that nothing happened between them.
6. Paris denied she was with Sharik whenever she was away from California between April 2018 and August 2019. She said she really did go see her advisor.
7. Paris admitted the apartment she lived near University D in 2019 was Sharik’s apartment. She said she couldn’t lease an apartment because she had no income, so Sharik leased it for her. She said Sharik didn’t live there, he lived in his advisor’s lab during that time.
8. Paris admitted she lived with Sharik in Longmont in 2020. The reason was that she must finish her dissertation in 2020. Had she lived in California then I would’ve asked her to care for our daughter, and she wouldn’t have time to work on her dissertation.
9. Paris denied Sharik lived in my Bay Area home in late 2020 and early 2021.
10. Paris denied that she lived in Sharik’s Fremont home in 2021 and 2022. She said she went to Sharik’s home everyday but still returned to my home every evening. As for why she went to Sharik’s home everyday, she said that’s none of my business.
11. Paris admitted she lived in Sharik’s Fremont home when she “went to China”. She said she wanted to travel with friends, but was afraid that I won’t let her go, that’s why she lied about “going to China”.
12. Paris admitted that Sharik picked her up and took her to his home on 11/28/2022, the night of the divorce.
13. Paris denied that she is still with Sharik after the divorce. She even said she never liked Sharik, and made a bunch of disparaging remarks about him. As for why Sharik claimed that she is his girlfriend in his dissertation, she said she doesn't know and has no control in what Sharik thinks.
14. Paris said she wanted to divorce soon after we were married because she felt that marriage life didn’t suit her. She accused me of ""controlling her life”, and said she had no freedom when she’s with me, but Sharik let her do whatever she wanted. I asked if that’s true then why didn’t she file sooner, and she said she hadn’t graduated and couldn’t support herself, she needed to graduate and find a job before filing for divorce.

I am not going to comment on her story. You be the judge.

# Who are they?

During the investigation, it’s hard to not notice both Sharik and Paris are incredibly strange people, and a lot of what they do defies common sense. They don’t look like typical students or typical adulterers. I really can’t figure out who they are. Some of their abnormal behaviors are:

1. Both individuals took 8 years to complete their PhD, but both left school after just 4 years. I looked up all other PhD students studied under their advisors, about 20 of them, and not one person took more than 5 years to graduate. Why did these two take 8 years? Why did both leave school 4 years before they graduated?
2. Both individuals attended elite universities in China, and have PhD degrees. They are more than capable of making top wages in the United States, and they should know the basic moral principles. Why did they have to go through all these troubles to do something so despicable?
3. They have known each other for more than 20 years, they are way past the honeymoon phase. Why did they have to go out of the way to be together all the time? This seems far too complicated for just doing the deed.
4. Sharik seldom went to school when he was in Virginia. None of his colleagues from school knew anything about him, a few didn’t even know he existed. What was he doing in Virginia? He didn’t talk to his colleagues at all in school?
5. Sharik moved frequently after leaving school in 2019. Other than the Fremont condo that he owned for 1.5 years, he didn’t stay longer than half a year at any of his other addresses. Why is he always moving?
6. Sharik is in close contact with several individuals with special backgrounds, such as individuals that work in the defense industry. How did he know these people?
7. If Paris planned to be with Sharik all along, then why did she have a child with me? This is just cruel. Also Sharik doesn’t mind? 
8. Paris spent the majority of the pregnancy with Sharik near University D. She didn’t have a job at the time, but she was out “working” everyday, even on the day of the delivery. What were they doing next to University D?
9. Our daughter is now 5 years old, but Paris has never cared for her, she seldom even comes to see her. She abandoned the child when she was less than 2 months old just so she can be with Sharik in Colorado. What kind of mother can be this coldhearted?
10. Paris has a PhD in a STEM major, but she couldn’t find a job in Silicon Valley after multiple years of “job search”. The judge has placed a seek work order on her, which she just ignores. Why won’t she work?
11. Paris is always very busy. Prior to the divorce, she was always in her room “working” whenever she’s home, sometimes at 4am in the morning. But she never had a fulltime job. What was she really doing?
12. Paris called her parents almost every day, and often talked for hours. Who talks to their parents that much? Was she really talking to her parents?
13. In 2017 and 2018, Paris went to Stanford University almost every day that she was in California, supposedly to work on her dissertation at the library, and sometimes she wouldn't come home until midnight. Paris didn’t graduate until October 2020, she couldn’t be writing her dissertation in 2017 and 2018. What was she really doing at Stanford?
14. Paris said her previous employer in China still reached out to her from time to time for help on projects, because they couldn’t find anyone else that could do them. What kind of employer would seek help from an ex-employee that left 10 years ago? What exactly can she do that is so indispensable?

In addition, both individuals are extremely secretive, and investigating them was incredibly difficult. Their background reports contain nothing more than their address history. The address history for Paris is not even correct - her report showed that she has been living with me since 2014. But she didn’t live with me! Now I know why she has been using my address everywhere after we were married, and won’t let me mail anything to her. She was trying to hide her whereabouts! Paris also refused to answer the majority of our Discovery questions, and none of the questions pertaining to Sharik. She was sanctioned by the judge for this yet she still refused to answer. Why can’t she answer those questions?

Some more oddities:

1. Paris seldom used my home Wi-Fi. She said she prefers hotspot xfinitywifi, because our home internet was unstable. She also used this as an excuse to often “work at libraries and coffee shops”. It is true that my home internet was unstable, it disconnects for a few hours almost everyday. I had Comcast come over several times and they weren’t able to find anything wrong. Oddly, I have not had any internet issues after Paris left.
2. Paris unplugged all my electronic devices whenever I was not home. She said it was to prevent fire.
3. Paris has alerts set up on search engines, so she knows whenever someone searches for her name online.
4. Paris constantly reminded me to not go through her stuff in her room, even though I never did. She moved all her stuff out the same night that she wanted the divorce. What exactly was in her room that she didn't want me to see?
5. Paris would not tell me where she lives after the divorce. She also warned me multiple times to not investigate her. Exactly what is she afraid of?

I am certain that the two of them are doing something shady. This is way too excessive for just adultery. But what are they doing?

# Lies

I think I am a fairly intelligent person and I am usually pretty good at spotting scams. I am still surprised that I was fooled for this long.

First, I never thought there are people this immoral, especially someone with a PhD degree. I think I was a bit cautious in the first couple years of this marriage, but I really let the guard down after having the child. I never thought there are people that don’t even care about their own children.

Second, Paris is exceptionally good at lying. She doesn’t just make up stories when needed, which is how most people lie, but she brainwashed me by continuously feeding me misinformation, and made me have a completely false perception of her. The contrast was really shocking when she revealed her true self after the divorce. Some examples are:

1. Paris would tell me from time to time that some male friends were pursuing her, or some strangers tried to hit on her, obviously she turned all of them down. She also told me stories of her previous relationships, and we gossiped about celebrity relationships and those of her friends. She always loathed at those people that were unfaithful, including her close friends. I always thought that she is someone that’s open, honest, and faithful. Well, let’s just say what she did was far worse than people that she despised.
2. Paris always says she was just “borrowing” whenever she asked me for money, and would pay me back as soon as she gets a job. She told me numerous times that she is an independent woman, and does not want me to support her. In fact she is even “ashamed” that she had to rely on me for medical coverage. She often told me that once she gets a job, she would pay a portion of our mortgage and family expenses. She said this as recently as 2 weeks before the divorce. I never really expected her to make too much financial contribution to the family, but I also never thought of her as a greedy person, and certainly didn’t think she would take advantage of me. Boy was I wrong.
3. During our marriage, I had to be very careful whenever I talked to Paris, because she cried – with tears – whenever I said something that might sound slightly critical. I have always thought she is thin-skinned and has strong self-esteem. After I found out about Sharik, I chewed her out in every one of our negotiations, yet she didn't bat an eye and continued to ask for money after I was done. The shamelessness is just astounding.
4. During our marriage, Paris pretended that she knew little about the United States, and she often made silly mistakes or forget things. She also asks some very childish questions, and acts cute. Just two days before the divorce, she was “begging” me to buy her bubble tea. This made me think she is just a simple and naive girl, and lowered my guards. But the fact is, she knows more about the United States than I do, and she has an excellent memory. Not to mention she is extremely calculated and deceptive.
5. Paris is extremely meticulous with her lies. For example, to make me believe she was living with a female friend between 2016 and 2018, she often told me gossip about this “roommate” of hers, such as where she grew up, schools she attended, her boyfriend, her looks and figures, places they hangout, and etc. I never suspected the legitimacy of this “roommate” after hearing all these details. Little did I know she was actually living with Sharik in Virginia during that time. I did some research on this “roommate”, she does exist, and most of what Paris said about her were true, except they were not roommates.

Most importantly, Paris is extremely tough mentally. When she lies, she always speaks with confidence, and doesn’t appear the least bit guilty. Even when her lies were exposed, she still can keep her composure and quickly make up another story to cover up the lie. This was especially obvious during our recent negotiations. I obviously don’t believe anything she says now, but I was fooled many times by her confidence and assertiveness during the marriage.

I do wonder if Paris’s lying skills are her natural abilities, or acquired via some training.

# Conclusion

This lawsuit lasted 2.5 years and it just ended about a month ago. Perhaps I will write another post at some point with more details on the whole process. The end result is I lost about one third of my wealth. That’s just direct loss, indirect loss is impossible to estimate. Most importantly is the psychological trauma I had to go through, and all the years that I wasted on her. My lawyer said this is considered a good outcome under current laws. Perhaps so, but how is this good? How can I not feel angry, frustrated and disheartened?

During this marriage, I have tried my best to be a good and supportive husband. To date, Paris still couldn’t state exactly how I mistreated her. She on the other hand was just exploiting me. Other than giving birth to our daughter, everything else she did was anti-family.

I don’t believe Paris ever intended to have a family with me. She even stated that she has wanted a divorce since 2016, and she started consulting divorce lawyers in 2019, shortly after getting her green card.

Paris was living with another man for the majority of this marriage, and lied to me on virtually everything. The lies I mentioned in this post were just a small fraction of the lies she told. This is a complete violation of the marital contract. Even during the times that she lived with me, she didn't do any housework or cared for the child. She was always busy “writing her dissertation” or “job searching”, which in hindsight were also lies, but I still don’t know what she was really doing. She didn’t fulfill any spousal obligations and had absolutely no contribution to the family.

Despite all these, the so-called California ""family” law worked in Paris’s favor in almost every aspect. In particular this so-called “no fault divorce”, basically doesn't matter what she did during the marriage, she is still entitled to my assets. What kind of logic is this? If everything is “no fault” then what’s the point of having laws? I understand it may be difficult to tell right and wrong in many family disputes, but that clearly isn’t the case here, and what she did couldn’t be more vile. The purpose of laws is to set social standards, protect public rights, and serve justice. Is infidelity, lying, and scamming the kind of values that our elected officials want to promote? The court that handled this case is called the Hall of Justice. Justice is to defend the good and punish the bad. Well, perhaps that’s too much to ask for, but at least don’t punish the good and reward the bad.

I have asked Paris multiple times during our negotiations why she thinks she deserves such a large portion of my assets. She couldn’t provide any good reasons, she just kept stating the law says she is entitled to my assets. Yeah, but this law is just utterly unfair and unreasonable. I suggest the the following changes be made:

1. If one of the spouses cohabitates with a person of the opposite sex without the other spouse’s knowledge, then the times of cohabitation should not count as a part of the marriage.
2. If one of the spouses had major concealments or malicious lies which hurt the interest of the other spouse, then the non-offending spouse should be able to request a shortening of the marriage duration or receive financial compensation.
3. If one of the spouses committed serious fouls during the marriage, then the non-offending spouse should not have to pay spousal support or legal fees to the offending spouse.

There are about a dozen more changes that I would like to see happen to the existing family law, but the three listed above target what I feel are the most egregious and nonsensical.

Part of the reason why I wrote this post is to vent – the past 2.5 years have been extremely difficult and depressing for me. More importantly, I hope what happened to me can get the attention of lawmakers so we can fix these loopholes. Governor Gavin Newsom, Senate President Pro Tempore Mike McGuire, Senate Leader Brian Jones, Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, Assembly Leader James Gallagher, and other lawmakers in California and elsewhere, I hope you can see this and do something about it.  I hope no one has to experience what I went through again.",7,1752741569.0,Divorce,2,1.0,False
1m229qx,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginVoyages/comments/1m229qx/scarlet_lady_food_review/,Scarlet Lady food review,"Cruised on Scarlet Lady from Barcelona on June 29th, so here are my 2 cents about the food onboard.

  
**The Wake:**

Truly the best restaurant onboard, very high quality food, excellent food choices, next time I'll cruise on Virgin I'll try to book this one more than once.

 The only downside is they are afraid to make a rare steak, I asked for a rare filet mignon, and I really emphasized on the rare part, they still made it medium rare, wife asked for medium rare, got medium. Was still great, but I like my steaks really bloody.



**Razzle Dazzle:**

I feel like this one is very underrated, usually not a problem to get in, but the food there was superb. It's definitely not only for vegetarians/vegans, they had great short ribs in sriracha sauce, if I remember correctly there was some rice with shrimps too, it wasn't fancy but it tasted great. In the morning they have a great bowl of acai, and also they have the best bacon on board, I'm not sure how they make it, but its extra crispy and in some sweet sauce. 

One thing I noticed is that in the morning this restaurant feels very understaffed. I'm not blaming the people who work there, they were running all the time, trying to keep up, but still the breakfast took about an hour and a half, we waited over 30 minutes for deserts, and the first time we had breakfast there, the bacon was burned. 



  
**Pink Agave:**

Maybe its a matter of personal taste, but honestly, next time I'll just skip that one, for us nothing to remember there, the guac was mediocre at best, so was the rest of the food. There was some dish with what suppose to be grilled corn with some spicy sauce, instead of serving it on a cob it was just in a bowl, it wasn't spicy, honestly there wasn't anything spicy in that restaurant. The only good dish there was something with tuna they had for starters.



**Extra Virgin:**

This one I have mixed feelings about. It's probably the busiest restaurant on board, but I'm not sure if it deserves this. The presentation was definitely 10/10, the service was top notch, it looks very fancy, but the food quality, while I give the steak a 9/10, the rest was more in the range of 6.5/10. If it wasn't on a ship, that would be the kind of restaurant I might go to if I'm in the area, but I wouldn't drive somewhere specifically for that restaurant. I was also happy when they said they could make a bloody mary for me even though it wasn't on the menu, but I learned that if this drink is not on the menu, the bartender probably doesn't have much experience making it. 



**Gunbae:**

A Korean BBQ restaurant where they prepare the food right on your table. It was a lot of fun, but unless you're an extrovert, this one is socially very draining. The food there is not bad, but honestly its something I could've easily skipped for a better option. The restaurant is VERY LOUD, and unless you're a large company, you will be seated together with some strangers, and the dinner begins with some drinking game. Personally I enjoyed it, but this place might not be for everyone. This one also feels understaffed, and they overcooked the steak and the shrimps at the end because they were busy with other tables.



**Test Kitchen:**

This was an interesting experience. I must admit when we went there I was extremely skeptical, joking that if we eat there fast enough maybe we can still make it in time for the food stuff at the galley. I couldn't be more wrong, for me it was probably the second best restaurant after The Wake. They had some amazing dishes, and superb presentation, also the waitress was probably the best I met on the ship. The name of the portions in the menu can be a bit misleading, the first course was just called ""Mushroom"", and it was a non vegetarian course, which of course made me wonder, I love mushrooms, but how is a mushroom not vegetarian? I was expecting a big portobello or something, but no, it was some paste from mushrooms and gelatin, served in a form of a mushroom, and tasted amazing. 

One thing that should've been reconsidered was the steak with some chocolate on it. I like sweet meat, wings in honey and mustard sauce, wiener schnitzel with cranbarry sauce, duck with pineapple... But steak with chocolate? I mean I get how you come up with such idea, I used to smoke a lot of weed back in my 20s, but I feel its not the kind of idea you should bring to work. I still ate it because I'm not a quitter, my wife on the other hand, decided to skip on that one. But another bonus point for this restaurant, since it was the main course and she doesn't like even normal sweet meat, they brought her a double portion of one of the previous courses that was superb. Very highly recommend this one.



The Galley:

Over all I think its a great place, many choices, different cuisines. But I wish they had more flexible hours in some of the places. I loved the ramen, but sometimes they work from 12pm until 4pm or even 3pm, and since I usually eat late breakfast, I'm not hungry during those hours, so I got to try it only once. 

In the evening Dine n Dash had some great options, sometimes a suckling pig, sometimes other great food, I wish there was a way of knowing ahead, sometimes it might be better than the restaurant. 

The burger place really baffled me, I tried it one time at 1AM, but still it was the worst burger I can remember in my entire life, just dry, tasteless. I decided not to try again. And yet, this place always had a huge line, I don't understand why, maybe it was because 70% of the people on the ship were Americans? perhaps for them a burger is like a pizza, even when its bad its still good, not sure. 

The breakfast at the galley was a bit repetitive, but it wasn't bad. Wish they had more options though.

To be entirely honest, in this case I would prefer the traditional buffet, you go around and put on whatever you want on your place as much as you want. For instance I don't want an avocado toast with smoked salmon, I just want some scrambled eggs and TONS of smoked salmon.

  
There are also excellent eateries on the 7th deck. The Dock house got grilled octopus and other Mediterranean options, I highly recommend. The pizza and ice cream places were also great, not sure what I can add here, they are just good.



**Dishonorable mention: the coffee**

What's included in the price is the Americano that most Americans are used to. My dear Americans, I love you, I really do, but your coffee standards are very low. I'm used to high quality espresso, so I figured why not? I'm on a vacation after all, $6.60 for a double espresso sounds reasonable, right? It will probably be the best in the world for that price. Well I order it, and they bring it to me in a paper cup (wasn't to go order), it was 100% arabica, but not high quality, it had a very sour taste. Coffee should be bitter, not sour.

1m2284o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waiting_To_Wed/comments/1m2284o/what_do_i_do/,What do i do?,"Hi everyone! New to the community as i was scrolling for advice here or to see if anyones going through the same thing but i couldn’t find a story that was exactly like mine (ofc) so i decided to share mine to get more specific advice.

My boyfriend and I have been together for a while and we’ve had the conversations that we both definitely want to get married to each other and for sure want to build a future together…. but hes not really making any moves towards it.

I love him so deeply and want to get our future started, but he doesn’t seem so interested, or interested at all, despite what he says when i ask. 

I’m the only one bringing it up, talking about it casually, making pinterest boards, saying how excited I am etc. It made me feel kind of sad that he only ever touches on it when i bring it up, and i noticed that he never talks much. It’s more of a brush off, yeah sure, shut up type response. I brought it up in conversation with him, that it makes me feel like he doesn’t really want it as much and it hurts that hes not as passionate or as eager as i am, and he said his apology and that he definitely is wanting it and he’ll work on expressing it better. That was 3 conversations ago. Ive brought it up multiple times over many months and still nothing on his end. I’m sending rings and potential dress ideas, when we go to our friends weddings i’m talking about how exciting it’ll be when our day comes, just expressing how excited and eager i am for our future to start. And still, after many hints and sit down conversations, no interest from him. 

I know at face value it’s obvious, “get the message, he doesnt want to marry you.” but in these conversations he really stresses that he does want it and he just wishes i trusted he does and i be patient. Yet ive been patient. its not like i want a proposal or a wedding tomorrow, i just want to know hes at least thinking about it sometimes. And ive said that. So. Many. Times. that I want HIM to bring it up and talk to his friends about it the way his friends talk to us about their plans. I want engaging conversation when i bring it up, or a discussion about it, not just a one sided yap from me. 

I ask sometimes whats the holdup and he says financials and life stress clouds over him thinking about it, which stings because, i as well have life stress and financial setbacks, but it doesn’t take away from my want to start our future together. I would think if he was as excited as he states, he would talk about it more and not let anything stop him from at least thinking about it. 

I completely understand wanting to be stable and not paycheque to paycheque before settling down. But i explained that partnership is building something together, facing struggles together and holding each-others hand through it. And how with a second income (mine) in the mix, financial situations will become much less stressful. I have no debt, a cheap phone plan and some luckily inexpensive car insurance, thats it. When i explain this, he understands, and i ask again whats holding him back, or if theres anything else, and he really has nothing to say. 

Its difficult seeing all of our friends and family members settling down and starting their futures when i have my partner saying he wants to but hes grasping at any possible straw not to. It’s got to the point where i am watching engagement videos and tearing up not out of warmth but out of jealousy and envy. I’m starting to find it difficult to be extremely excited for our friends that are engaged and wed. 

With that being said, i’m not materialistic AT ALL. My dream ring is sent him is a $72 etsy ring. The dress i already have picked out is $150. And we could be wed in a coffee shop with a barista as our officiant for all i care. Its so much less about the actual wedding and act thereof, and more about wanting to be desired by him. I want him to express the same excitement and passion, and for him to be unable to wait another minute to spend the rest of his life with me. (and he is extremely loving dont get me wrong) but there is NO desire from him in this aspect, and from all the conversations, he has yet to give a real reason why. he just says he’s in no rush. which is another huge sting. 

I’m not one to give an ultimatum or a timeline, but this has made me feel extremely unwanted and way to invested in something that my partner isnt even close to equal on. Its made me question how strong we actually are and if this is a realistic thing that’ll ever happen. I can’t wait forever, specially for at least some interest on his end. I cry constantly and i have NO idea what to do. I wish i could get up and say “i deserve someone who is sure about me” but he gives me just enough when i ask, just enough to string me along and lead me on. keeping me waiting for a very unsure future. 

very confused, very stuck, and VERY vulnerable, so please be kind in advice! thank you for reading!

This morning I was upside down and late injecting and just did it before even showered and had a coffee. Ok more excuse.

1m221qt,https://i.redd.it/k8hz4cct9edf1.png,To My Nine 'Sisters': Let's Bury Our Husband Alive,"Chapter 1  
  
  
Everyone in the Upper East Side knew that Hudson Cross had eight mistresses, but no one dared mention his actual wife.  
  
  
And I was that dangerous topic.  
  
  
Just as his ninth little plaything was being welcomed into the house, I was being forced to kneel and serve her coffee.  
  
  
The sweet, innocent-looking girl smiled demurely, but the moment no one was watching, she splashed the scalding coffee across my hand.  
  
  
The liquid hissed and steamed, instantly burning half my wrist bright red.  
  
  
Harrison didn't say a word—just immediately bent down and carefully lifted her wedding pristine dress away from the mess.  
  
  
The next second, his polished leather shoe slammed viciously into my chest, his eyes wild with rage.  
  
  
""This is the eighth fucking time. Haven't you gotten the hint?""  
  
  
""Can't even hold a cup of coffee steady. Might as well chop off those useless hands!""  
  
  
His kick sent me sprawling on the floor, coughing up blood, yet I still bowed my head submissively and apologized.  
  
  
Everyone assumed I'd keep crawling back to Hudson Cross like a pathetic doormat.  
  
  
But then I vanished from his world entirely.  
  
  
The always imperious Hudson Cross—who'd always acted like he owned the damn city—spent the next TEN FUCKING YEARS desperately tearing apart the city looking for me.  
  
  
\-------  
  
  
Hudson didn't say a word, just stared at me with those dark, threatening eyes.  
  
  
I didn't dare look up, banging my forehead against the floor over and over, not caring that blood streamed down my face.  
  
  
The wedding guests watched like this was just another show.  
  
  
Everyone knew I was Hudson Cross's least favorite woman.  
  
  
In this city, anyone could step on me.  
  
  
""Seraphina, you did this on purpose, didn't you?!""  
  
  
Hudson was built like a tank—a guy who'd fought his way up from the streets.  
  
  
One kick sent my body into spasms. I couldn't straighten up.  
  
  
""You know damn well I can't have blood at my wedding, but you made yourself look like roadkill anyway! Trying to make me look like a joke?!""  
  
  
His crew got fired up, like they wanted to tear me apart.  
  
  
Hudson had come up through the underground, and today's wedding was packed with his old crew.  
  
  
Who would dare laugh at him?  
  
  
But plenty of people had been itching to see me get what was coming...  
  
  
""Since you love kneeling so much, stay right there!""  
  
  
""You get up when the wedding's over. Not a second before.""  
  
  
His voice faded as he walked away. When I looked up again, Hudson had already switched back to his charming act, arm around Delilah Sterling—his new woman, smiling like some refined gentleman.  
  
  
Maybe it was just me, but tonight's reception dragged on forever. The drunk guests didn't scatter until well past midnight.  
  
  
When I finally struggled to my feet, exhausted, my legs had gone completely numb from the poor circulation.  
  
  
But I knew Hudson Cross. The man had power, and he had a thousand ways to make people suffer. This punishment was just getting started.  
  
  
Sure enough, a servant from the main house rushed over, rolling her eyes like I was some kind of bad luck charm, acting all high and mighty.  
  
  
""The master just got married today, so get your ass to the bridal suite and serve them!""  
  
  
""If you piss off the new missus, you're gonna regret it!""  
  
  
Hudson Cross had nine wives total, and every time he brought home a new one, he found creative ways to humiliate me.  
  
  
The servant shoved me toward the main house and kicked me down to kneel outside the bedroom door.  
  
  
The door suddenly swung open, and Delilah Sterling was draped all over Hudson, her exposed skin covered in bright red marks.  
  
  
I looked down, lying to myself, while my heart felt like it was being sliced open.  
  
  
Hudson acted like he couldn't see my pathetic state and coldly ordered:  
  
  
""Delilah's delicate. If she gets pregnant, it'll be hell for her. Go buy a couple boxes of Plan B.""  
  
  
My throat went dry, like it was weighed down with lead.  
  
  
""I can go, but I'll need money for—""  
  
  
Before I could finish, Delilah cut me off with a mocking laugh.  
  
  
""Oh please, girl. I've seen tons of women try to gold-dig Hudson, but this is pathetic even for you.""  
  
  
""Two boxes of Plan B? What's that, like fifty bucks?""  
  
  
""Sweetie, you eat Hudson's food, live in Hudson's mansion—the Cross family's probably dropped millions on you by now. Nickel and diming him over this? That's just tacky.""",1,1752740687.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

We have some late news coming up that the masterminds behind the disappearance of Tidmouth Sheds are none other than the Steam Speed Duo, Red Arrow, and Iron Shark. I have Officer Joey here with us. Care to make a statement?

Joey: I was taking my early morning coffee that day when the call came in. But when it said that the police chase was urgent, I had to leave my coffee break behind and get to it, leaving Lenny covered up in coffee powder when the coffee machine blew up in his face. I am probably disciplined and humiliated for that.

Fareah: *\[chuckling\]* Thank you, Joey. The ex-heroes are now doing time in Crovan's Gate where they are assessing repairs for minor damages. That's all for the news tonight, we will keep you further updated.

*\[Meanwhile in Crovan's Gate Repair Shed, Red Arrow and Iron Shark are placed outside. The two heroes struggle to figure out the disappearance of Tidmouth Sheds.\]*

Iron Shark: Now, let's go over it again. Are you sure you didn't hit the building-obliteration button when you were foolin' around with your cab controls?

Red Arrow: I'm sure of it, Iron Shark. I was full of cheesecake, my driver reached down to loosen my valves, and he pressed this button by accident. *\[he pushes the same button again\]*

Iron Shark: Oh! Geez! *\[stutters\]* I sure wish you'd stop fiddling with that thing. You make me nervous.

Red Arrow: There's nothing to be afraid of, Iron Shark. It's just my funnel-cam. *\[the driver pulls out a picture of his funnel\]* Look. Such a handsome funnel. *\[he pulls out another picture of his funnel\]* And here's the picture I took at Tidmouth Sheds. Right before it vanished.

Iron Shark: Well, that proves it wasn't you that caused the mess. This time at least.

Mickey as the Prison Guard: A mess? There wouldn't be a mess like this around here. Except for that one guy, Messy Messerson. He goes by the name, Stanley. He is real stinky and likes making messes.

Iron Shark: Uh, yeah, thanks. Uh, somehow I don't think this is the work of someone called ""Stanley"".

Sinistar: No, it doesn't sound like Stanley's style at all. Stanley ""Messy"" Messerson likes to make a mess. Tidmouth Sheds vanished too cleanly.

Red Arrow: So, what are you in for?

Sinistar: I got caught freeloading. Could you believe it?

*\[Red Arrow, Iron Shark, and Sinistar share a laugh.\]*

Red Arrow: T-600?!

*\[Red Arrow, Iron Shark, and T-600 growl at each other.\]*

Mickey: That is enough, gentlemen! Give it a rest!

T-600: Spoiled sport.

Mickey: Now, let's talk about the disappearance of Tidmouth Sheds. If you think that there is a giant monster on the railway...

Iron Shark: Monster?!

Mickey: ...you're mistaken. The person responsible is Sneaky Samson.

Sinistar: Sneaky Samson. Of course! This crime shows all the signs that have been present throughout the engine's criminal career!

Iron Shark: What signs? What does Sneaky Samson do?

*\[Suddenly, the entire building of Crovan's Gate Repair Yard shakes and vanishes into thin air, just like Tidmouth Sheds.\]*

T-600: I think it would be fair to say that Sneaky Samson steals buildings.

Sinistar: A fine observation, my villainous companion. Now, if everyone will excuse us, this sudden freedom has renewed my eagerness for villainy. Come, T-600! *\[leaves\]*

T-600: Ooh, let's start with freeloading. They couldn't possibly catch us twice. *\[leaves\]*

Iron Shark: We should probably catch those two you know.

Red Arrow: All in good time, Iron Shark. All in good time. First, I think we've got an engine to catch. We'll start with the docks, because big engines like him work at the docks hauling heavy freight away. To Brendam Docks! Away!

Mickey: *\[very dizzy\]* Somebody call the police! We got a gang of escaped convicts on the loose! *\[a ceiling tile falls on him\]*

1m2205o,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/1m2205o/trypophobia_messes_up_my_recovery/,Trypophobia messes up my recovery,"The title sounds weird so let me explain.

Possible TW for ones with trypophobia?? (I'm not sure, no photos though)






Basically, I have trypophobia which is a fear of clusters of small holes (you can look it up.)
It never really affected me that much, just sometimes I had chills when I saw a trigger but nothing too serious.
It was of course until I started noticing the holes in food. It was before my ED got super bad and started just as avoiding food like fizzy drinks or coffee (they have bubbles that kind of look like holes that form on top). It didn't matter to me since I was restricting so I wouldn't drink these anyways.

Now I'm nearly 3 months into recovery and the trypophobia got worse for some reason. Now it makes me want to throw up whenever I see holes.
Vomiting is a very big trigger for me and just simple feeling of nausea or stomach issues makes me spiral again. Whenever I eat or drink something (more like close my eyes and force myself) I feel like I'm going to throw up and I'm feeling terrible. It makes me want to avoid those foods but the problem is that I started noticing holes in more and more things.

Reform UK want more climate change.,"""Despite fierce competition between retailers, the ongoing impact of the last budget and poor harvests caused by the extreme weather have resulted in prices for consumers rising,"" 

""Last month the trade body said rising fruit and vegetable prices contributed to a jump in food price inflation caused by weather patterns around the globe. The BRC, representing more than 200 major UK retailers, said “hot, dry weather” had reduced harvest yields and fuelled some of the rise in prices.""

""Helen Dickinson, the BRC chief executive, said: “We predicted a significant rise in food inflation by the end of this year, and this has been accelerated by geopolitical tensions and impacts of climate change.” Within the figures, increased costs for meat, coffee and chocolate fuelled high levels of inflation, with prices in staples like bread and whole milk also increasing.""

 I’ve been addicted to coffee since I was like 13, I’m from Italy and honestly it’s just normal here. Everyone drinks espresso, it’s not even seen as a big deal. I usually have like 3-4 a day easy.

Lately I’ve been feeling a bit too wired though, especially on game days (I play football), so I tried switching it up and grabbed a guarana supplement just to see.

Weirdly… I actually like it more. It’s still got the caffeine but it hits way smoother. I feel more focused during matches, like my head’s clearer and I’m not all jumpy or overthinking.

I wasn’t expecting to notice anything, honestly. Thought it’d just be “plant caffeine lol”, but now I’m kinda into it.

Anyone else feel the same? Or am I just imagining it because I want it to be better than coffee?",1,1752740459.0,Supplements,4,1.0,False

I usually have like 1hr breaks in total and instead of spending time on social media, I would rather increase my frame data knowledge and my overall character knowledge (strings, interrupts).

This is a call to need for a phone app that imitates the punishment practice in the game.
Wouldn’t that be sweet to have a coffee break and improve your defence at the same time?

It can be a simple mobile like game that shows a move/string/frame trap and ask you to choose one of 4 (or more) options to counter.

For example;
King 3,2:
1. Block
2. Block 3, duck 2 and launch
3. Block 3, sidestep
4. Block 3, dick jab

Would you support developing such app? If not, why?
Feel free to add ideas and maybe we can set the glove for this to happen.

OSU!
