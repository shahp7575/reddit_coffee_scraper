For a bit of context I 33M recently got broken up by my ex 30F.

This was a second breakup, initially together 9months, broke up due to communication issues and clashing. Went NC for 2 months and got back together. 

We have been in therapy, improved in communication but still ran into similar patterns, resulting in a second breakup after another 8 months.

To expand on context, we were in the middle of a partnership Visa, which she paid in full. A few months ago, in the middle of a discussion I got asked if I would maintain this visa for her if we were to breakup, my answer was No at the time.

In the reality of the situation I've considered keeping it for her, as there's a chance that she would get kicked from the country. She is unaware that I've considered this, and she has proceeded to cancel it regardless. This Visa has put a lot of pressure in the relationship.

The first time around, I could see a possible reconciliation, this time I don't. She has deemed the relationship toxic and us incompatible and although I don't agree, as I see a big urgency for our issues to be ""resolved"" quickly, this is not the case, even when the willingness is there.

Now, the problem with this is that we both live in a small island, and are bound to see each other regularly, either driving past each other, at coffee places or events.
The first time we broke up, I would remove myself from the situation. This time I really don't see the point.

There's been an instance where we were in different events at the same bay, and I could see her keeping an eye on me from the distance, and eventually reposioned herself to not face my way. Smart. I would do the same. Today I saw her at a cafe, and it's the first time she sees my daughter 7F, whom just found out about the breakup yesterday and its really sad.
My daughter went to hug her, and after told me that she said she would always be there for her, and that she wasn't going to leave the island. This makes me very happy as the visa stuff has really been doing a number in my head and I felt bad for her legal situation, so obviously she has found a way to extend her stay.

I'm not sure how to navigate having to see each other regularly, from a standpoint of no reconciliation,  at least not on a near future as I think it takes more than 2 months to actually put in the work and achieve real changes and I feel she needs some self introspection too.
It has only being a week and a half, I'm not acting crazy like the first time, I'm maintaining a healthy life, working on projects, doing therapy, journaling, being social and doing everything ""right"" from a very logical point of view, BUT it sure hurts seeing her, I love her and I can tell that she is struggling to see me aswell. 

Any advice from similar situations, where it is inevitable to move from hope or anger, and where you are ""doomed"" to keep seeing each other very often, would be much appreciated.",1,1731124869.0,AskWomenOver30,3,1.0,False

I walked to my first location, the Abandoned Mine in Coastal Highway; I mapped; I kept it moving.

Well, as dusk fell on day 44, I arrived at my final location: Lake Overlook in Mystery Lake. I lit a campfire, spread my bedroll, gazed out across the lake where it all started, and mapped my last. As the sun slowly disappeared behind the mountains, I reflected on the journey and the most important thing I'd learned: sometimes the simplest things are the most satisfying.

I wasn't sure what tomorrow would bring; but one thing was for sure: as long as i had one cup of coffee left, I'd be all right.

What should I do?,"I am an undergraduate student at Unimelb and one of my neighbors (in my apt building) is a unimelb research fellow and professor (approx. 45+ y/o). For two years, he has continuously approached me, touched me casually, and has even messaged me on social media. He is aware that I am a unimelb student, and that I have a boyfriend who he has seen me with numerous times. I ignore him, avoid him, and blocked him on social media, but he frequents communal areas in our building. He gets angry at me and tells me off when I am with my boyfriend in his vicinity, but is 'nice' when I'm alone (my boyfriend and I are LDR). When my boyfriend and I were walking in the street at night, we saw him tailing us and glaring at us. When he walked past us, he maintained eye contact with us the entire time and stared menacingly. Furthermore, when he was in my home country, he messaged me on Facebook and asked me to show him around the area. I said I was out of the country with my boyfriend and family and blocked him.

Most recently, after I ignored him in a communal area and was actively doing something else, he approached me physically (inches away from my face) and I recoiled and tried to ignore him. He then asked me if I'd like to **go for coffee the next day** (note. I have avoided and ignored him for ages at this point, when I am forced to respond, I respond coldly, there is no indication I am interested). When I said 'no, I'm busy' he looked a bit defeated and said 'yeah... right' and left. 

What should I do? Seeing as he is not my professor, I'm pretty sure its not illegal or bonded by unimelb policies. However, I'm wondering if anyone else has been in a similar situation and can offer some insights. ",18,1731124045.0,unimelb,4,1.0,False

Here's my story so you can protect yourself in the future. ,"I've dedicated almost 3 years to this company. I have seen a very dark side that I believe many have seen. I was a coffee master and a barista trainer in the works to be a shift supervisor. I was very close to my first store i worked at and stay close to some employees to this day. I have felt that since day one that store managers and shift manager do not get enough correction for the way they treat and talk about their employees or baristas. I wanted to say this for all future baristas and all people who are looking to promote. Not all store managers are bad and not all of them are good but if you ever hear them saying anything bad about other employees report it. All of it. I dedicated My days as being as supportive and helpful as possible to my fellow shift managers and baristas. If we were short staffed I would help and come in. If there were discrepancies in the way the store manager would copy and paste the schedule I would cover the missing body. I had found out that i was under the impression that i was to be promoted and later found out I was being led on by my previous store manager. A store manager that would publicly tell me they hold grudges against employees who make complaints against them. And I had to watch it happen to my friends and myself after they left. Regardless of anything If it was a stressful day I would pay for breakfast or lunch. I cared about everyone in my store and everyone who would step into my store. My career ended with me being endlessly disappointed in my superiors. I transferred to help a short staffed store. I had complained multiple times about feeling unsafe and unwelcome in my new store because of a shift manager. To add i have reported this manager before multiple times for theft and for making comments about store managers and new baristas and not following food safety code. I had done my due diligence and reported it to my store manager and district manager. I had then found out I had false reportings against myself from the person I had complained about. On top of that I had negative comments being made about me from store managers about me. Making the uncomfortable situation worse. I myself have ptsd and the situation was too uncomfortable for me to handle. I made the situation clear weeks before I finally quit that I didn't want to be in my store anymore. I am a very strong worker and can handle a floor on my own if need be. The last straw came when a customer who had spend their time drinking in and outside our store made a life ending threat when exiting our building. When I asked my shift manager to bring it up to upper management so we could lock the doors incase they try to return I was met with nothing but ,""they left our building it's not our problem anymore"". I told my store manager I no longer wanted to work with those managers anymore and made final complaints backing up my statements only to find out the manager I was complaining about was behind me the whole time and my store manager did not make me aware at all. Unfortunately it was the last straw for me and I gave my notice 3 days later. Please stand up for yourself if you are dealing with anything similar and please report things when you hear it. Especially your store managers. Find an outside store manager that can help you as well. I have appreciated and will always appreciate those who have helped me in my journey while I was there endlessly but at some point my mental health became my priority. And as always take care of your mental health during the chaotic holiday season. ",4,1731123806.0,starbucks,0,1.0,False

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is probably The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I watched all the SAW movies last month to kick off spooky season, and right now I'm making my way through the Friday the 13th movies.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' a Japanese and a Spanish course on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills üòÖ But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats ü§§

As an Introspective Explorer, I was curious if these small changes could alter my day in meaningful ways. It turns out the world seems less fragmented when I'm not fixated on the constant flow of notifications and updates.

  
In the past week, I've started replacing my morning scroll with some simple stretches and a cup of coffee in silence. At first, it was hard to resist the urge to check social media, but each day got a little easier. Without this habit, I feel more present and grounded. It's like my mind has more room to breathe and process without the clutter of endless content.

  
Have any of you tried similar approaches to disconnect from the internet? What other methods have worked to cultivate a sense of presence and improve mental clarity? I'm interested in hearing more about this from the community!",1,1731122809.0,nosurf,1,1.0,False

When I compared it to my grinder, I realized that there was almost no consistency in the particle size. I could grind down or re-up in size and it would still result in a lot of random sizes. Started looking around, and people kept mentioning the Ode. Told myself I'd have to either break my current grinder or see a really good sale to justify it. Well, I've had a really good sale a few weeks ago and it arrived in the mail. Used it for the first time today and I could not believe how much of a difference it made.

Only Eisha, Alice are women.

Chahat, Sara, Shrutika, Kashish and even Shilpa (when Avinash used to insult her) are not women. They can be slut shamed, character assassinated continuously, subjected to misogyny  by Vivian and Avinash Mishra in the name of ""game"" and if they all stand up, they are playing Woman card. Even the men who stand up for them are mocked.

Chahat has received more blame and bashing for standing up against her character assassination than Avinash has received for character assassinating her. He has done it not once but multiple times with even Vivian joining in. What the hell!

Shrutika has received bashing for speaking up against Misogynist Vivian rather than other way round.

Sara has received bashing for talking abt baby sitting etc but Avinash's nasty remark against her has been deleted from the episode.  Avinash stealing coffee from Shrutika and stealing sugar free Stevia which is used by Sara from common ration was also wiped out from the episode. Am sure, she brought it up in WKV but it was deleted from it too. The episode is edited in such a way to cut off the responses of her or Arfeen. Avinash kept on taunting her with ""Pata nahi kahan se aate hai yeh log"" to which Sara said ""maa ki khokh se aayi hoon. tu apne maa ki khokh se nahi aaya hai kya"" i dont think she said anything wrong. Also, she never played woman card and made it clear too to Ekta.

i agree that she shud control someone of her jibes for her own sake but i can understand all her pent up anger as she has received the maximum taunts and bias from BB for no rhyme or reason since first week. Ekta wanted to spin her anger into some outburst bcoz of nomination. Which was a lie as she was angry abt the Bias way before it.  Also, this was not the first she was nominated. She was even put in Jail unfairly n nominated by twisting her husband's words and had full control of Ration. Still, she never did any drama to provide content to stay. She did the most Fair distribution of ration. If anything, it is Avinash who creates maximum content whenever he gets nominated. 

On Top of it, Alice who played the worst woman card by plotting and making a fake allegation against Rajat is spared by the Bigg Boss makers.

Seriously, the persons running this Show are misogynistic and unethical persons. They think that by repeating a lie that Chahat was playing woman card, Shrutika made a big issue of Hygiene, they think it will be accepted as the Truth.

Eisha is even shown exclusive clip of Rajat which is unfair and shows how Biased the show is. Bcoz the others dont get to hear all the slut shaming, character assassination, plotting that Chugli gang keep doing.

If we are so triggered as viewers, imagine how triggered the contestants facing the Bias must be feeling.

No wonder, Bagga wants to leave the show.

Karanveer Mehra has been name called, age shamed, body shamed, there has been nonstop personal attacks on him, they mock n give him nicknames, they stopped his growing bond with Chum. Now, he has lost interest to even participate in the fights. Bcoz he understood how rigged the show is.

Rajat for all his flaws atleast doesnt take BS from the makers and does his own thing.

Sara is fierce and fearless. She is the only one speaking out against the Bias and Partiality of the show.

Chum and others know that the show is favoring Laadla but they are not speaking up strongly as they are all Actors and dont want to break any bridges with the makers, Not everyone can be Gauhar.

I‚Äôm a 26 year old on a bit of a self-discovery journey, and I‚Äôm looking to connect with someone who can be both a grounding force and a bit of a spark in my life. I‚Äôm interested in meeting someone with an open heart, a good sense of humor, and a passion for exploring the world (and themselves) in meaningful ways.

A Bit About Me:
I‚Äôd describe myself as someone who values deep connections. I love learning about everything from history to philosophy, always with the hope of better understanding myself and the world around me. I have a playful side and love to laugh, but I‚Äôm also drawn to intense conversations about life, purpose, and everything in between. At my core, I‚Äôm a mix of down-to-earth reliability and open-minded curiosity. Oh, and I‚Äôm vegan, a skincare enthusiast, and a big fan of discovering new ways to grow.

What I‚Äôm Looking For:
Someone Loyal and Grounded: I‚Äôm looking for a partner who‚Äôs steady, supportive, and truly values loyalty. You know what you want out of life and relationships, and you‚Äôre ready to show up for someone in a way that feels steady and true.

Intellectual and Emotionally Expressive: I‚Äôm drawn to people who are thoughtful, reflective, and unafraid to share their feelings. Romance is important to me, so it‚Äôd be great if you‚Äôre the type who appreciates the small gestures and meaningful moments that make a connection feel truly special.

Playful and Funny: Life can get heavy sometimes, so I‚Äôd love to meet someone who can bring out my playful side! If you have a knack for making people laugh or can bring a light-hearted perspective, that‚Äôs a huge plus.

Driven and Passionate: Whether it‚Äôs a career, a hobby, or a personal goal, I admire people who are deeply committed to something. I‚Äôm inspired by people who follow their passions and are always looking to grow.

Strong, Yet Gentle: Ideally, you‚Äôre someone with a mix of strength and vulnerability. I‚Äôm looking for a partner who is emotionally present, isn‚Äôt afraid to be real, and brings a natural balance of courage and care to the relationship.

Adventurous and Open-Minded: I‚Äôm always up for new experiences, whether it‚Äôs trying a different activity, exploring a new place, or simply discovering new perspectives. I‚Äôd love to meet someone who shares this excitement for life and isn‚Äôt afraid to step outside of their comfort zone.

What You‚Äôll Get from Me:
I‚Äôm a committed, supportive partner who believes in building something real and meaningful. I care deeply about my loved ones and love creating shared moments of laughter, adventure, and deep connection. I‚Äôll be your cheerleader when you‚Äôre chasing your dreams and your calm when life gets a little chaotic.

If any of this resonates, I‚Äôd love to hear from you! Tell me a bit about yourself, and maybe we can grab a coffee (or virtual coffee!) sometime soon. Looking forward to meeting someone who feels like both a best friend and a partner (I knowww, how cliche, but it is for a reason, right?)

I spent a week in New Orleans and had the most magical time! I was originally there for a four-day conference but extended my stay to a week just because.

**Day 1 (Saturday):** Checked into Auberge Hostel, decompressed a bit, and then met some amazing fellow travelers for a pregame before heading to Mother-In-Law Lounge, led by our hostel hostess. We had an incredible night dancing and listening to jazz. FYI, they have a $20 cover and only accept cash, but there‚Äôs an ATM on-site if needed. Afterward, we headed to Bourbon Street‚Äîimagine the whole street on acid! I‚Äôve never partied so hard. Shoutout to the hosts at Auberge Hostel and my fellow travelers who brought serious energy and footwork. Great time! Headed back around 3 a.m.

**Day 2:** Thanks to this community, I had a few tours lined up. At 10 a.m., I almost missed my Voodoo Experience tour with High Priest Robi, but I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt. It was indeed an experience! We met at Louis Armstrong Park, and Robi gave us an in-depth history of New Orleans and voodoo, which, as he explained, is nothing like the media portrays‚Äîit‚Äôs spiritual and grounding. This tour, by Tours by Foot, is a must!

Then, I had another tour booked with Two Chicks Walking Tour, starting at PJ‚Äôs Coffee on Magazine Street. I initially went to the PJ‚Äôs on Bourbon Street by mistake, but Bonnie from Two Chicks Walking was accommodating and rescheduled me. I then wandered over to the WWII Museum, which was an experience in itself, showing how war has shaped art over the years. Afterward, I returned to the hostel, ordered some pretty good Chinese food, then hit Frenchmen Street with friends. Frenchmen is more laid-back than Bourbon, and most bars have live bands‚Äîyou can go in and out, tipping the band if you‚Äôd like. 

**Monday:** Checked out of the hostel and into a hotel on Canal Street. Breakfast at Ruby Slipper was slow service-wise, but the food was worth it! I booked a Whitney Plantation tour with Cajun Encounters. They provide transportation, and the self-guided tour (with audio tapes and museum info) was deeply moving. Later, I joined a ghost and vampire walking tour with French Quarter Phantoms, and it was such a spooky good time! I finished the night at Mahogany Jazz Club, which I ended up visiting three times‚Äîit‚Äôs that good. Amazing staff, top-notch bands, absolutely incredible drinks.

**Tuesday:** Brunch at Zesty Creole was okay (I‚Äôm vegetarian, so my options were limited). I grabbed coffee and beignets at Cafe Du Monde; a local Lyft driver also recommended 4141 for beignets as a local favorite. For dinner, I went to Paladar 511‚Äîhands down the best Italian food I‚Äôve had. Don't miss it if you're in NOLA. Later, I went to Spotted Cat Music Club on Frenchmen Street to see Nola Sweetie Pies (every Tuesday); they enchanted the whole place. Such a vibe!

**Wednesday:** Rescheduled architecture tour with Two Chicks Walking was in the Garden District. Bonnie, the guide, was so knowledgeable. The Garden District is a beautiful, fairly new neighborhood with some fancy houses. For dinner, I tried a vegan restaurant, but they had an electricity issue, so I went to Pomelo, a Thai place in the Garden District. I could eat there every day‚Äîit was that good. Finished the night at Mahogany Jazz Club (again).

**Thursday:** Tried a fancy place for brunch and dinner, both disappointing, so I went to Mahogany Jazz Club yet again.

**Friday:** Brunch at Atchafalaya, recommended by a local, did not disappoint. As a solo traveler with a small appetite, I found it challenging to finish entire meals, but this place had the right portions. Their house-made cornbread with butter is to die for (and complimentary). Also, try their tres leches! I spent the day wandering around the Garden District before heading to the airport.

**PS:** Things I missed, as suggested by locals: Storyville Museum. For drinks, try Peacock Room or Pigeon & Whale. For food, Turkey and the Wolf, and Hungry Eyes. The *Ladies of the Night* tour by Two Chicks Walking sounded interesting, but they didn‚Äôt have availability.

**Note:** I didn‚Äôt mention every place I dined because, as a vegetarian, my experience was limited and I didn‚Äôt want to unfairly impact any businesses. Keep an open mind and try everything!

Thanks to the beautiful Reddit community and amazing locals. Special shoutout to Big Mike, a Lyft driver and former limo driver who‚Äôs a local treasure ,and to the staff at Mahogany Jazz Hall. Also, I visited Preservation Hall, which was a great (but slightly pricey) experience. Worth it!

1gn0o3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gn0o3t/am_i_being_manipulated/,Am I being manipulated?,"Ok, so I'm not really sure if I am overreaching or overthinking this situation but thought it might be a good idea for some unbiased perspectives to help me sort my head out.

I (46F) have been seeing 'Carly' (46F) for approx. 6 weeks. She is only the second woman I have been involved with as I am a late bloomer bi. My first queer relationship ended a year ago after 7 months due to the other person being very toxic and narcissistic.

Me and Carly had been taking things relatively slowly, which is what we both wanted. Her own last serious relationship ended a little less than a year ago, to which she still has some issues, but everyone has baggage. I've not been worried. But three weeks into our 'relationship', I lost my job. It was very sudden, totally unexpected. Carly offered to lend me an old laptop of hers as I didn't have one, so that I could update my CV, get job applications out etc, which I thought was a lovely supportive gesture. But then the next day, a new laptop arrived at my house. Of course I was like 'this is too much, that's far too generous' but she insisted that I keep it as I need it. It's not a very expensive one, in laptop terms, but it was still over AU$300 and that's a lot of money to splash on someone you've only been seeing for a few weeks. I initially worried that this could have been the start of a lovebombing (I experienced that with my ex) but she hasn't mentioned about it since. The only time it gets talked about is if I bring it up. And it has worked, as I have a new job lined up to start next week. Also she had previously discussed whether I would want to try and make a trip to the UK next year. I'm originally from there and she has never been. I was keen for us to look at how to save etc.

So, that aside, everything was going well. She would come to mine for a night at the weekend. She lives on the other side of the city from me so due to that, she doesn't come by in the week because of having to be up early the next morning. I offered to go to hers sometimes but she always insisted on coming to mine. I've been ok with that. We talked and/or texted every day. We get on extraordinarily well. We have great conversational flows, we find a lot of the same things funny, we have a lot of similar views and interests. However, this last week, her messages seemed like she was pulling away a bit. So on Wednesday, I asked her if there was something wrong as she seemed different. Basically she said that she just wants to be friends, not due to anything with me, but due to a couple of trigger issues she had in relation to her ex. And that (for some reason) she thought that I cared for her but only as a friend, which is very not true. But she was insistent on wanting to still have me in her life, she genuinely wants to be friends. I initially said that I understood but I have found it harder to deal with than expected. The day after it all went down, we had a phone call because she was having some issues at home and we were talking for nearly 4 hours. She also offered to lend me some money (I hadn't asked) because she knows I'm worried about this month's rent due to not knowing when I'll get my first full pay at my new job. She knows that I'll be in a position to pay it back closer to Christmas due to my having a medical rebate coming in then. I said I would think about it. She wanted to meet me for a coffee today as well, which I initially agreed to, but due to my feeling very flat about all this, I asked her if we could postpone until Sunday instead. She questioned as to why, asking if I couldn't handle being friends, and I confessed that I'm struggling with all of this a bit as I seem to be getting very mixed signals from her. She immediately pulled away saying that she 'doesn't want to damage me in any way' and that she 'missed me but doesn't know how to turn it off'. That she won't get in touch unless I ask her to, but that the offer to borrow the money was still there. And that she doesn't want me to hate her or think badly of her. To which I responded that I neither hate her or think badly of her.

It's not like I'm in love with her. I was being very cautious with my feelings, as in to not get carried away with myself, due to my history with not one but three narcissists in my relationship history. But I do care for her very much and don't see her merely as a friend. But it wasn't just about sex either as, for various legit reasons, we haven't been able to get up to much of that. I genuinely enjoyed spending my time with her. Maybe it's just my ego taking a bit of a battering, maybe it's just confusion. 

But I suppose my question at the end of all this is: is she trying to manipulate my feelings, to create that push/pull scenario, to try and get me to 'prove' myself and my feelings to her? Or is it just about trying to get some semblance of control on her side? Obviously if she were to lend me the money she offered, that creates a further temporary bond, to try and enforce me staying in her life, regardless of the dynamic between us. Is she a budding narcissist? Or am I just overthinking?

I logged in to my computer and started up the software I've been working with the past week. I checked my email and I waited instructions from my boss who was in her office.

Ok, so I have an OCD roommate who is super passive-aggressive, ignores me, is fake kind, on/off, hot/cold, hostile, called me a bitch the other day, always has RBF with me, gives me one-word responses, never wants to talk to me, provides attitude, etc. 

Hence, the reason I‚Äôm looking into switching rooms is because it‚Äôs super uncomfortable for me to have to deal with such insecure and immature behavior. I‚Äôm not lying; I think she‚Äôs going into my room and snooping around because I know when someone has touched my stuff or how I‚Äôve left things. 

She‚Äôs kind and respectful to the other two, except me. I have no idea why unless I create random conspiracy theories in my head‚Ä¶

With everything going on with that girl acting weird, rude, and disrespectful, it doesn‚Äôt help the fact that I have high-functioning autism (I‚Äôm politely straightforward), but if someone doesn‚Äôt address issues or communicate, then I need to use my intuition/gut feeling. It‚Äôs quite a messy situation since I‚Äôm the only roommate dealing with this other individual's less-than-ideal behaviors. Maybe she could say the same about me; who knows?¬†In addition to HFA, I‚Äôm also ADHD, and by now, we all know ADHD contradicts OCD.

Aside from this, she‚Äôs gotten upset over the fact I didn‚Äôt have a soap dish for my bar soap, rearranges things if she doesn‚Äôt like where I put them once I was finished cleaning, got upset when I didn‚Äôt lock her car door, knocked on my door to let me know the trash was full and she needed me to take it out right away, got upset over a Sprite spill on the wood floors, told me after she was done showing the rest of the roommates how to make coffee with her coffee machine that if I wanted a cup, I could do it myself, admits to ignoring me, constantly re-cleans things if she doesn‚Äôt like things done the way she wants or she‚Äôs continually rearranging, etc. 

I‚Äôm hoping I never have to speak to the other individual and move away due to this uncomfortable and unfortunate experience since it‚Äôs possibly seemingly going to worsen it as if it weren‚Äôt already pretty bad.¬†I mean, after all, I‚Äôm the only one being targeted/bullied and having to deal with this. I‚Äôm hoping to avoid confrontation since I don‚Äôt want there to be gossip amongst the rest of the roommates or picking sides and someone playing the victim when they shouldn‚Äôt be.¬†",1,1731121441.0,roommateproblems,0,1.0,False

1gn07m5,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/1gn07m5/interviewer_added_me_on_linkedin_before_interview/,Interviewer added me on LinkedIn before interview,"So I recently applied to a junior software engineering role through my university's careers website and I've been given an ""initial chat"" on Thursday to ""tell you more about the role and the team and getting to know a bit more about you and your interests"", which I'm essentially treating as a first stage interview so I'm not going to waltz in super casually and act as if I'm meeting a friend for coffee.

The email I got through was very enthusiastic and mentioned how he really enjoyed looking through my portfolio website, it's a relatively small company so it's not so surprising he actually looked through my application instead of it getting lost in ATS but I took that as a good sign anyway.

What really surprised me though is the person interviewing me immediately added me on LinkedIn after this email, before we've even had a face to face interaction - I've not had this happen before and I've been looking for a job in my field for a year and a half now out of university so I'm quite unsure if I'm just being really wishful that this is a good sign or if it genuinely is at this point.

Is this something that normally happens? Should I message him on LinkedIn before the interview to thank him for connecting and try to get some questions in? I don't want to get my hopes up but I would really appreciate it if someone could tell me if this is a good sign or if they're just being polite.",3,1731120209.0,interviews,2,0.81,False

","Hey, it's me, Radhika (21F) I'm been inactive from reddit and offline pretty much from everywhere online because I was not in right place and going through many things at the same time.

A little about me: I‚Äôm college student pursuing computer science and I‚Äôm always up for trying something new and exploring‚Äîbecause life is too short, right?

For those wondering where I‚Äôve been and why I‚Äôve been in and out of Reddit, well, here‚Äôs what‚Äôs been going on:

1. The saddest thing ü•∫: My dad lost his battle to cancer in July 2024. We‚Äôre still in grief. It just kind of stays with you, doesn‚Äôt it? Fuck cancer.
2. I‚Äôve made it to my second year of college after taking a two-month break. But the past few months have been tough‚ÄîI keep wondering if I can continue, being apart from my mom. Lately, I‚Äôve even thought about dropping out.
3. It‚Äôs been a hard road, but I guess we all go through these struggles, and eventually, things will fall into place. This too shall pass, right?
4. Honestly, I believe everything happens for a reason. Losing Dad has been devastating, especially because he was my best friend. But I‚Äôm at peace knowing that he‚Äôs finally free from the physical and emotional toll cancer took on him (Though he never made us feel that he's going through this nor did we made him look like he has this disease). I‚Äôm grateful for the four years we had with him, filled with beautiful moments that I‚Äôll always cherish.

So, that‚Äôs where I am right now. Life‚Äôs been tough, but we keep moving. Thanks for reading, and thanks for always being a kind community! Reddit is the only place where people (most all the friends I've made) send me regular DMs to check on me. 

As always - Keep smiling and stay healthy ‚ù§Ô∏è

When this all started she was just another girl at work however she showed genuine interest towards me and I started having a crush on her. 

I 28M, she 26F. She's been shy and nervous around me in general but approached me and had a good chat when no one was in the office while we worked late. 

Cut to recent - Since, she's shy I texted her on slack asking if she'd like to go for coffee and she said sure, came up to my desk and we went out, since it was late the nearby shops were closed and we had to have a coffee in the office cafeteria. I wanted to ask her out on a date but couldn't since there were people around. While she was leaving I asked her if she'd go for lunch over the weekend. She said she had plans but we can sort something out. 

Next week, again she was acting nervous around me so I gave her some space and didn't initiate. 

Last week, I asked her if she'd like to go outside for a coffee since this is the final week so I thought I maybe give it a final go. She said she can't today but can do tomorrow. We agreed on a time and the next day she said she's busy and apologised. I left it at that and said no issues. She texts me back right away saying how about we try again on her last day. I said sure and left it at that. 

Now to the last day, I didn't ask her cause I thought if she really wanted to she'll ask. However, since it was her last day I didn't want to seem rude so I casually walked her to say all the best for future. She said she didn't realize time just went by and said it was great to know me and hope our paths cross again.

Now wth just happened, if she didn't want to go at all why did she kept on rescheduling or is it the nerves.

I'm fine with rejection however her behaviour doesn't add up. There are ways to soft reject but this doesn't make sense.

The first 9 days or so were very rough‚Ä¶ physical withdrawal followed by a stupor that made it really hard to function at work and home. I‚Äôm coming out of it now and feeling pretty good and getting better! I had already cut back to 1 cup a day prior to getting pregnant so the withdrawal was probably mild in comparison to many but still absolutely sucked! 

American Academy of Pediatrics has given safe guidelines for caffeine in moderation for many many years and I have lightly but consistently used caffeine in all 3 of my previous pregnancies. Learning now what I didn‚Äôt know then, I‚Äôll always wonder if that‚Äôs why I had restless babies. 

Fetuses and even newborns can literally not metabolize caffeine. The half life for a small dose of caffeine in an (already born!) newborn is like up to 200 hours‚Ä¶ so imagine, if you‚Äôre a new mom drinking a cup of coffee every day and your either pregnant or nursing, your baby is going to be CONSTANTLY CAFFEINATED. Does this feel right? Not for me.  

There are new studies out there finding more and more adverse correlation between fetal growth, childhood development and maternal caffeine use. Do your research‚Ä¶ now we can all blame our coffee drinking mothers for our problems! (as if we didn‚Äôt already) üòã

To add context why I‚Äôm doing this I am a college student going for computer programming.

So they constantly throw double the work/coding projects at me. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I LOVE programming and can‚Äôt see myself doing anything else for the next 30-40 years of my life. 

I started to double up on the dosage of bupropion just to see what it could do if it was going to be more beneficial or not do anything at all. It was working like magic. My productivity was going up and I didn‚Äôt feel stressed about not meeting deadlines because I had laser focus and my mood was 10x more pleasurable than an orgasm and I‚Äôve even turned down adult magic making in the bedroom with attractive ladies because my brain has rewired and becomes addicted to completing tasks and accomplishments.
