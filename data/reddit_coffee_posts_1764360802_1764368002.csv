The man in front of me accidentally spilled his drink and apologized to me. After exchanging a few polite phrases, we decided to sit down at a table. It turned out that he was a former employee of this coffee shop, so I asked him why he no longer worked there.

You would always wake up in a day or two, what the hell went wrong this time??

Oh my! Hello again stranger\~ 

…

No no no! Don’t move! \*mumbles\* Jesus, to think you’d have learnt after the last three crashes…

…

\*Trying to sound not guilty of attempted murder.\*

Y-yeah, it’s me…again. You should like, give me your number, honestly. We’re always bumping into each other, heh.



Wait- sorry, no. I didn’t mean it like that. It’s just that we keep seeing each other, and not in a good way, so I thought that I might as well get your contact info, you know?



But of course, not right now…not when you’re bedridden like this.



Oh, and don’t worry, I’ll be taking care of the damages like all the other times.

…

No seriously, you really don’t have to worry about that! I’ve…got a good insurance plan, I’ll be fine, really.

…

So, um, anyone I should ring up and inform about this? It;s the least I can do.

…

You don’t have anyone? N-no partner or…spouse?

\[Trying to suppress excitement knowing they’re bitchless.\]

\*Whispers\*

Not for long now\~

…

No? Uh, any friends?

…

\[Starts off with a defence, but admits the reality.\]

W-well, I too watch anime in bed all day in my free time- y-yeah, okay, I…don’t have friends worth calling either. Heh.



Maybe we could be such friends for each other. We’ve clearly been through this rodeo too many times for it to not be fate, right?



Yeah…yeah. So, got any parents or relatives I can ki- call? \*clears throat, ‘cus that’s so not sus\* Call.

…

Ah, that must be rough at times like these. It’s best to not call right now then. It must be what, midnight for them right now all the way over there?



Mhm, I think you should rest up. Also, DO NOT hesitate to let me know if you need anything at all, okay?

…

Uh, yeah? I was planning to stick around. Especially since you don’t have anyone else to stay by your side.

…

Of course, I have no life- uh, life…changing. No life changing stuff to take care of. I’ll stay at your beck n’ call until you get better enough to drive yourself back home out of here.

…

\[Awkward silence settles ‘cuz ain’t no one conking out with a weirdo in the room.\]

Is something the matter? Are you feeling uncomfortable? Dizzy? Does it hurt somewhere?

\[Rushes to the listener.\]

You didn’t rip your stitches, did you?



Huh? I- uh, guess…yeah, it’d feel a little awkward with me standing in the corner like that…

…

If that’s not an issue, then wh-

…

\[Freak the fuck out, your ass is call out by them.\]

P-pictures?! I didn’t take any! Wh-why would I take pictures? Heh, that would be so invasive and unnecessary. 

…

\*Sighs, cuts losses to fess up.\*

Okay, fine, I guess there’s no point in hiding things anymore…

\[Walks up to the door and clicks it shut, it Shawshank in here.\]



Oh, nothing really. Just for privacy reasons, you see?



\[Cue villainous delulu monologue\~\]

Now, my lovely little bait, first time’s a charm, really. The second, might be…coincidence, sheer dumb luck, and third is just straight up destiny, but a fourth? \*snicker\* A fourth time is either sordid fate, or just too good to be true.

…

What I’m trying to say is that us meeting this way the fourth time at that, is a little bit of both. 



Definitely sordid fate…but one which I had to spend many many sleepless nights working towards.



These seemingly coincidental ‘bump-ins’, if you will, were never a coincidence to begin with, my darling little adventurer.



Though, I’ll give it to you, you didn’t stop driving after two near-death experiences on the road.



You really do love to coat yourself up in chum and swim in an ocean full of lethal sharks, don’t you? Such a trooper.



But don’t worry, I plan to take very good care of all of that. And you, of course. You’re of utmost priority to me.

…

\*A sinister smile like when decimating a five year old at Fortnite.\*

Whatever else could I mean by that, my dear? I would take such good care of you, that you wouldn’t ever feel the need to step out of our place at all. 

\*Mumbles like the snake in Jungle book.\*

Not that you could, even if you wanted to, that is…

…

Yes, ‘our’ place\~ You did hear it correctly. Good to know your hearing and cognition are both intact.



From now on, you’ll stay at our place. With me to take care of you twenty four seven\~



And don’t worry, I’m a graphic designer, so all my work is remote. I barely ever need to step out, and it’s mostly to stalk, uh- well…yeah, to stalk you.



You won’t need to worry about a single thing. I’ll take care of all the bills and chores.

\[Please take me away, mister :( \]

…

Yes! I do have savings to fall back on, and the place is mine! And you too shall be mine now\~

…

Are you kidding me?? Of course this isn’t a prank! I am absolutely and utterly obsessed with you. I know everything about you, even the fact that eating gingerbread cookies makes your tummy gurgle, but you still do it regardless.

…

Remember that adorable little girl selling girl scout cookies a few weeks ago? You bought six boxes off of her. Sadly, I didn’t even get to taste a single crumb.



I was kinda hoping to know what they tasted like at the very least…but you just looked so cute munching on them while you complained about the twists and turns of Love Island in bed.

…

Oh come on, don’t be so surprised, of course I know. I have cameras all over your house. But don’t worry, as enticing as it is, I’ve never peaked while you’re in the shower. 



I do have principles, you know? I’m not a degenerate.



And anyways, when we begin living together, you’ll open up to me eventually…in more ways than one.

…

Well, do you remember that corporate mixer you attended three months ago? You wore that beautiful blue outfit which makes your skin glow and your eyes look bright?



I noticed you there…all alone in a corner, eating the appetizers so adorably. I wanted to sucker punch the dude who tried to bother you when he was drunk. 



But given my experiences in the past, I can be a bit…much, to say the least. So I held onto your business card. 



After that, I found you at your office, followed you home, and began laying all the groundwork to know everything about you.

…

\[Maniacal logic, like the Joker with Batman.\]

I tried, okay? I tried! But nothing I planned worked!

You just...kept slipping through my fingers like some godforsaken soap bar in a prison shower!



Everything I set up always turned out to be a  near-miss somehow. All the tiny “coincidences” which were supposed to bring you closer to me like a Hallmark style meet-cute failed terribly.



\[Cue frustrated vent like that one Starbucks employee on Tik tok.\]

A pigeon shat on me, the power gave out, a kid knocked the coffee I got for you all over my clothes, and the worst part was when your neighbour’s chihuahua ate the cupcakes I baked you and then threw up all over my shoes!



Something or the other always had to get in my way! And if not all of this miscellaneous bullcrap, you’d just wake up and decide to be a responsible adult!



I mean, who the hell even checks when an elevator was last repaired in their building?? 



I had solid plans for us to get trapped in there, and I’d offer you my coat, some candy maybe, slide in my number real quick, but no! You had to go ahead and remind the housing board to get it serviced, which made them shut it down for a whole week!



So when nothing worked, I got frustrated of tailing you and watching you through the hidden cameras, and out of frustration, I didn’t even realise what I was doing before I did it to get your attention.



\[Maniacal, of course, but sad.\]

When I saw you in the hospital, lying unconcious…because of me, I couldn’t bear the pain of being the reason behind it.



But then, a miracle happened. You opened those beautiful eyes of yours and finally looked at me for the first time. It was so intoxicating, I can’t think of anything which would make me as happy as that.



Then you went on to talk to me, to assure me that it’s alright, that everything’s gonna be fine…all I could focus on was your angelic voice, and your kind smile. 



I felt so happy and so incredibly jealous at the thought that you must’ve let others see you that way. I decided that very moment that if this is what it takes for me to be close to you, to make you completely mine, then so be it.



\[Maniacal smile, yes, I don’t have an expanded vocabulary. Deal with it :/ \] 

Do you know how much work I put in to make sure that everything went well? All the sleepless nights I spent, the anxiety made me pick at my own skin so much!



Just so that you, my love, could be safe…with all your organs completely intact, and inside your body where they belong.

…

Aw, don’t be mad, you bounced back so beautifully the first two times…like one of those trauma-resistant anime protagonists. 



It’s inspiring, really. Makes me feel like I picked the right person to obsess over.



And I’ve made sure this time’s no different. Actually, it’s gonna be slightly different. Especially now that the jig is up.

\[A drawer opening.\]

…

Relax, won’t you? It’s just a tiny dose. You won’t feel a thing, I’ve practiced on myself and the doctor multiple times…\*snickers\*



\[The listener struggles, ‘cuz they aren’t very plus ultra.\]



Sh-sh shhhh…



\[Turns into father time, your voice begins to reverberate as everything fades .\]

Relax, darling…just breathe and think happy thoughts…like us being together forever…



I’ll never ever leave your side…can’t let my favourite person get hurt ever again.



\[Leans closer and whispers, no reverb.\]

Oh darling…you’re not unlucky, I’m just that determined.

\*Chuckles\*



\*Optional li’l lip-five if you is willing\~\*

\[Yes yes, I meant a kiss, sue me, I’m juvenile.\]

I was kinda hoping to know what they tasted like at the very least…but you just looked so cute munching on them while you complained about the twists and turns of Love Island in bed.

…

Oh come on, don’t be so surprised, of course I know. I have cameras all over your house. But don’t worry, as enticing as it is, I’ve never peaked while you’re in the shower. 



I do have principles, you know? I’m not a degenerate.



And anyways, when we begin living together, you’ll open up to me eventually…in more ways than one.

…

Well, do you remember that corporate mixer you attended three months ago? You wore that beautiful blue outfit which makes your skin glow and your eyes look bright?



I noticed you there…all alone in a corner, eating the appetizers so adorably. I wanted to sucker punch the dude who tried to bother you when he was drunk. 



But given my experiences in the past, I can be a bit…much, to say the least. So I held onto your business card. 



After that, I found you at your office, followed you home, and began laying all the groundwork to know everything about you.

…

\[Maniacal logic, like the Joker with Batman.\]

I tried, okay? I tried! But nothing I planned worked!

You just...kept slipping through my fingers like some godforsaken soap bar in a prison shower!



Everything I set up always turned out to be a  near-miss somehow. All the tiny “coincidences” which were supposed to bring you closer to me like a Hallmark style meet-cute failed terribly.



\[Cue frustrated vent like that one Starbucks employee on Tik tok.\]

A pigeon shat on me, the power gave out, a kid knocked the coffee I got for you all over my clothes, and the worst part was when your neighbour’s chihuahua ate the cupcakes I baked you and then threw up all over my shoes!



Something or the other always had to get in my way! And if not all of this miscellaneous bullcrap, you’d just wake up and decide to be a responsible adult!



I mean, who the hell even checks when an elevator was last repaired in their building?? 



I had solid plans for us to get trapped in there, and I’d offer you my coat, some candy maybe, slide in my number real quick, but no! You had to go ahead and remind the housing board to get it serviced, which made them shut it down for a whole week!



So when nothing worked, I got frustrated of tailing you and watching you through the hidden cameras, and out of frustration, I didn’t even realise what I was doing before I did it to get your attention.



\[Maniacal, of course, but sad.\]

When I saw you in the hospital, lying unconcious…because of me, I couldn’t bear the pain of being the reason behind it.



But then, a miracle happened. You opened those beautiful eyes of yours and finally looked at me for the first time. It was so intoxicating, I can’t think of anything which would make me as happy as that.



Then you went on to talk to me, to assure me that it’s alright, that everything’s gonna be fine…all I could focus on was your angelic voice, and your kind smile. 



I felt so happy and so incredibly jealous at the thought that you must’ve let others see you that way. I decided that very moment that if this is what it takes for me to be close to you, to make you completely mine, then so be it.



\[Maniacal smile, yes, I don’t have an expanded vocabulary. Deal with it :/ \] 

Do you know how much work I put in to make sure that everything went well? All the sleepless nights I spent, the anxiety made me pick at my own skin so much!



Just so that you, my love, could be safe…with all your organs completely intact, and inside your body where they belong.

…

Aw, don’t be mad, you bounced back so beautifully the first two times…like one of those trauma-resistant anime protagonists. 



It’s inspiring, really. Makes me feel like I picked the right person to obsess over.



And I’ve made sure this time’s no different. Actually, it’s gonna be slightly different. Especially now that the jig is up.

\[A drawer opening.\]

…

Relax, won’t you? It’s just a tiny dose. You won’t feel a thing, I’ve practiced on myself and the doctor multiple times…\*snickers\*



\[The listener struggles, ‘cuz they aren’t very plus ultra.\]



Sh-sh shhhh…



\[Turns into father time, your voice begins to reverberate as everything fades .\]

Relax, darling…just breathe and think happy thoughts…like us being together forever…



I’ll never ever leave your side…can’t let my favourite person get hurt ever again.



\[Leans closer and whispers, no reverb.\]

Oh darling…you’re not unlucky, I’m just that determined.

\*Chuckles\*



\*Optional li’l lip-five if you is willing\~\*

\[Yes yes, I meant a kiss, sue me, I’m juvenile.\]

**FILLERS FOR UPPER EYELID EXPOSURE (UEE)**

* Fillers typically last 6 months in injection site, then migrate to another face part, fully absorbed by body in 3-4 years
* Duration depends on injection location: upper nose lasts up to 12 months
* Upper eyelid fillers last 2 years average
* Cost: $400/euros per injection = $200/year to maintain UEE fix
* **Fat grafting alternative:** requires minimum 22% bodyfat (doctors won't do it lower), not suitable for all orbital shapes depending on upper orbital structure, once grafted fat survives you can lose weight again without it shrinking
* **Supraorbital implants:** lifetime permanent (unless infection), extremely long recovery (invasive surgery), \~$30k cost (Dr. Eppley)
* Can combine: infraorbital rim + lateral rim + supraorbital rim implants

**WHITE SCLERA (EYE WHITES)**

* Sclera = outermost eye layer, white soft tissue, surrounds and protects eye, maintains eye shape
* White sclera = sign of good health, good lifestyle, good genetics
* Discolored sclera = poor health, bad diet, people think you're high/tired/sick, ruins first impressions (dating, interviews, family)
* Bottom right eyes (white sclera) look most attractive even with all other factors same
* **Causes of discoloration:**
   1. **Lack of sleep:** decreases oxygen available for eyes, blood vessels dilate, appear red/bloodshot
   2. **Smoking/drug use:** marijuana/vaping dilutes blood vessels or makes super dry, develops red tint

**STEP 1: LATERAL CHEEK AUGMENTATION - FOUNDATION**

* Proper malar support required before fixing eye area or it's futile
* Strong LATERAL projection props up sagging droopy skin appearance
* **Underdeveloped lateral projection signs:** tired face despite well-rested, ""chubby"" face despite lean, very prominent nasolabial folds/eyebags at young age
* **Test:** pull midface skin SIDEWAYS (NOT upwards) - if eye area improves significantly = lacking lateral projection. Don't pull up (mimics facelift, not lateral projection)
* **Fix:** laterally augment cheeks with implants (fillers temporary, implants for longevity)
* **Want LATERAL projection** \- most implants placed in front (anterior projection) or below malar (submalar) giving ""apple bottom"" cheek appearance
* **Use MALAR implants** (placed on malar region), NOT submalar/""subhuman"" implants
* Most patients are old women so default designs bad for young men
* Need lateral placement, not too low - custom implants NOT always necessary, just proper placement

**STEP 2&3: INFRAORBITAL IMPLANTS + LOWER BLEPHAROPLASTY (COMBINED)**

* **Infraorbital implants:** go directly underneath eye area, remedy depressed under-eye region, provide direct support, make eye less buggy
* **Lower blepharoplasty:** removes excess skin underneath eye for tighter appearance
* Combined because infraorbital implant alone usually not enough to fix under-eye area
* Most infraorbital results paired with some blepharoplasty/canthoplasty
* Off-the-shelf designs exist: ""Flowers implant""
* Hard to find infraorbital results without some under-eye skin tightening

**STEP 4: FIXING UNDER-EYE DISCOLORATION**

* Hyperpigmentation below eye causes very dark under-eye area
* Usually genetic, more prominent in non-white populations

**Method A: KOJIC ACID SOAP**

* Acidic soap good at evening out skin tone
* Treats dark dead-looking skin patches
* **WARNING: HEAVILY DRIES SKIN - MUST MOISTURIZE**
* **DOES NOT LIGHTEN SKIN - ONLY EVENS TONE**
* Snake oil salesmen claim it whitens skin (IT CANNOT)
* ""Proof"" is cave photos vs washed-out frauded photos
* Will NOT lighten skin at all
* Only evens out skin tone

**Method B: UNDER-EYE LASER TREATMENT**

* Lasers away hyperpigmentation areas
* Decent results available
* Final touch to eye area with kojic acid

**EYE ASCENSIONS:**

* Require multiple surgeries: implants, fat transfers, canthoplasty combined
* Not one cure like recessed chin (chin implant/bimax)
* Most failos don't require multi-step process like eye area does

**INFRAGLABELLAR NOTCH (NOSE BRIDGE AREA)**

* Infraglabellar notch = indentation between glabella (area between eyebrows)
* **Deep infraglabellar notch + brow ridges = top male model tier**
* **Weak brow bone + no nose bridge = subhuman**
* Gandy: hook nose BUT deep infraglabellar notch (extreme example of deep notch)
* This is striking feature (stunning, beautiful AND rare)
* Too much glabella forward growth misaligned with chin = weird profile (Archie example: top tier glabella + deep notch but doesn't align with chin)
* **Big nose only looks good with large projection chin** \- why plastic surgeons comment on rhino + chin implant together
* **Examples:** Big nose without chin projection = bad, big nose with chin projection = good
* Chin projection works even with small noses
* Gandy's oversized nose looks normal because: glabella projection + deep infraglabellar notch + chin projection
* **Before nosejob:** make sure nose is problem, not glabella/chin/infraglabellar notch - otherwise disappointing results
* Deep infraglabellar notch related to legit PSL1+

**AEGYO SAL (UNDER-EYE FAT LINE)**

* Makes eyes look bigger and cuter
* **Often confused with eye bags - THEY'RE DIFFERENT:**
   * Eye bags = bad (puffy, saggy below eyes)
   * Aegyo sal = good (line/slight puff directly under lash line)
* **Examples:** Chico without aegyo sal looks worse, Gandy has them (looks different without), Jordan Barrett has them
* Common among male models (thread common in super models)
* Very popular surgery in Korea
* For Asians: gives striking look, separates from ""all Asians look the same""
* **Makes you look younger** \- sign of youth (couldn't find oldcels with aegyo sal)
* **Signifies good fat storage under eyes** \- when you cut won't get holocaust-tier eye bags
* For Caucasians: gives better under-eye support
* **Necessary with:** hooded, vertically narrow, horizontally long eyes with straight/positive tilted eyebrows - without it looks psycho/aspie

**WHY WE LOST AEGYO SAL:**

* Modern western shitty lifestyle = shitty facial muscle utilization (especially eyes)
* Hours in front of computers = lose muscle tone in orbicularis oculi
* Get droopy workcel look: eye bags, dark circles, tear troughs, sigmoid lower eyelid
* **Brainwashed retards:** get blepharoplasty scam, fucks up orbital fat permanently, condemned to never have healthy ocular look
* **Smart ones:** retrain neural systems → muscle retonification
* **Can't have aegyo sal AND eye bags/dark circles simultaneously**
* Poor OO tone → facial fat/blood/lymphatic water follow gravity, accumulate under tear trough ligament
* Strong OO = draining pump, activates drainage systems, avoids pseudo-hematoma collection

**CAN ORBITAL RIM IMPLANT GET AEGYO SAL?**

* **NO** \- orbital rim is bone, aegyo sal is muscle, won't do shit

**HOW TO GET AEGYO SAL:**

**1. Facial Exercise:**

* Train orbicularis oculi muscle to improve
* Videos exist for believers of facial exercise

**2. Makeup:**

* Many videos about aegyo sal with makeup
* Do own research

**3. Serum:**

* Aegyo sal serum moisturizes/hydrates under-eye skin, keeps younger
* Apply small amount daily
* Relatively time-taking process, puffy effect takes time

**4. Tape:**

* Transparent beauty gadget
* Makes eyes pop with dramatic effect
* Safest method
* If women can use makeup why not use tape to improve eye area

**DEEP-SET EYES (EYE PROMINENCE)**

**IMPORTANCE:**

* Eye prominence crucial for face perception
* Deep-set eyes = male dimorphic trait
* **Hypothesis:** adaptation for combat, hunting, male intrasexual selection - designed to protect eyes from hits
* **Science:** High estrogen → women gain \~35lbs fat (breasts, hips, thighs, lips shape change). Men gain 1.5x muscle/bone mass via androgens → longer/broader lower jaw, brow ridge growth → sunken narrow eyes
* **Masculine facial structure designed for fighting:** heavy brow ridges protect eyes from blows, robust mandibles lessen catastrophic jaw fracture risk
* **More masculine faces** = eyes become vertically narrower and more sunken

**DETERMINATION:**

* Eye prominence determined by orbital rim projection relative to cornea
* **Average measurements:**
   * Soft tissue over supraorbital rim: 10mm anterior to cornea
   * Soft tissue over infraorbital rim: 3mm behind cornea anterior surface
   * Supraorbital rim projects 13mm beyond infraorbital rim
* Greater orbital rim projection beyond cornea = ""deep set""
* Less orbital rim projection = ""prominent""
* **Relationship of globe to orbital rims = primary determinant of upper face appearance**

**MEASUREMENT: HERTEL EXOPHTHALMOMETER**

* Device measures globe position relative to lateral orbital rim
* Measures from lateral orbital rim to corneal apex
* **Normal range:** 14-21mm in adults

**CLASSIFICATION:**

* **Deep-set:** <14mm
* **Normal:** 15-17mm
* **Moderately prominent:** 18-20mm
* **Very prominent:** \>20mm

**ORBITAL VECTOR:**

* Linear relationship: most anterior globe projection vs most anterior lower eyelid/malar eminence projection

**Types:**

* **Positive vector:** anterior globe lies posterior to lower eyelid margin, which lies posterior to anterior malar eminence (usually = deep-set eyes)
* **Neutral vector:** anterior globe, lower eyelid margin, anterior malar eminence all in same vertical plane
* **Negative vector:** anterior globe lies anterior to lower eyelid margin, which lies anterior to malar eminence (usually = prominent eyes)

**Important:** Malar eminence = most prominent point of zygomatic/malar bone, ALWAYS located anterior to infraorbital rim - take into account when augmenting infraorbital rims with implants

**ACHIEVING DEEP-SET EYES - TWO APPROACHES:**

**1. REDUCE GLOBE PROMINENCE:**  
**Orbital Decompression Surgery:**

* Removes or thins various safe orbital walls (and orbital fat)
* Expands eye socket, allows eyeball to settle back
* **Best/safest first:** lateral orbital wall (remove or thin)
* **Followed by:** medial wall
* **Last:** orbital floor
* More reduction + added risk as more walls decompressed
* **Incisions hidden:**
   * Lateral upper eyelid crease (lateral orbital decompression)
   * Caruncle/transcaruncular (medial wall decompression)
   * Lower eyelid conjunctiva (orbital floor decompression)

**2. INCREASE ORBITAL RIM PROJECTION:**  
**Orbital Implants:**

* Custom periorbital implants: superior brow bone implants + infraorbital rim implants that meet over lateral orbital rims

**Osteotomies:**

* **LeFort 3:** advances infraorbital + lateral orbital rims
* **Modified LeFort 3:** advances infraorbital + lateral orbital rims
* **Quadrangular LeFort 2:** advances infraorbital rims

**EYE BAG TREATMENT PRODUCTS & ROUTINE:**

**Products:**

* Volufiline
* Ice cubes
* The Ordinary caffeinated eye serum
* First Aid Beauty Retinol Eye Cream with Squalane + Ceramides

**Morning Steps:**

1. Ice cubes: rub circular motion on under-eye skin
2. Apply The Ordinary caffeinated eye serum to under-eye (don't apply too much)
3. Let dry, proceed with other skincare

**Night Steps:**

1. After cleansing, dry under-eye area
2. Mix small amount volufiline + retinol eye cream together

**Brush and Groom:**

* Use spoolie brush comb brows upward and outward

**Apply Brow Gel:**

* Set brows in place, add texture with clear/tinted gel

**Trim Long Hairs:**

* Carefully trim overly long hairs maintain neat appearance

**Eyebrow Tinting:**

* Professional tinting enhances color and definition

**DEBLOATING (FOR FACIAL/EYE AREA):**

**DIURETICS - BEST DEBLOATING METHOD:**

* Diuretic = substance/medication promoting diuresis (increased urine production)
* Helps body remove excess water and salt (sodium) through urination

**Natural Diuretics:**

* Water (yes, drinking MORE water reduces water retention)
* Caffeine (coffee, tea, some sodas)
* Dandelion
* Green tea
* Parsley
* Hibiscus
* Hawthorn
* Juniper
* Ginger
* Asparagus

**Medicinal Diuretics (prescription only):**

* Thiazide diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide)
* Loop diuretics (furosemide)
* Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone)

**POTASSIUM/SODIUM BALANCE:**

* **4:1 ratio (4g potassium : 1g sodium)** reduces facial bloating and water retention

**How it works:**

1. **Balance of electrolytes:** Potassium and sodium both electrolytes, crucial for fluid balance, higher potassium:sodium ratio balances fluid retention
2. **Sodium reduction:** Excessive sodium → water retention (including face). Reducing sodium relative to potassium decreases overall water retention
3. **Potassium's role:** Counteracts sodium effects, flushes excess sodium through urine, reduces bloating
4. **Cellular fluid balance:** Potassium = intracellular (inside cells), sodium = extracellular. Increasing potassium draws excess fluid from extracellular space into cells, reduces visible bloating
5. **Kidney function:** Ratio optimizes kidney function regulating fluid balance (kidneys crucial for electrolyte balance)
6. **Hormonal effects:** Ratio influences hormones regulating fluid balance (aldosterone)
7. **Anti-inflammatory properties:** Studies show diet higher in potassium has anti-inflammatory effects, indirectly affects facial bloating

**OTHER DEBLOATING METHODS:**

**Dandelion Tea:**

* Natural diuretic
* Reduces water retention throughout body (including face)
* Drink 1-2 cups daily
* Consult healthcare provider first (especially allergies/medication)

**Facial Misting with Rosewater:**

* Anti-inflammatory properties
* Reduces puffiness as facial mist
* Keep spray bottle in refrigerator for cooling effect

**Lymphatic Drainage Massage:**

* Gentle massage technique
* Stimulates lymphatic system reduce facial fluid retention
* Done with clean hands or jade roller

**Facial Steaming with Herbs:**

* Add herbs (rosemary/lavender) to facial steam
* Reduces inflammation, promotes detoxification
* 5-10 minutes, 1-2 times weekly

**Facial Cryotherapy:**

* Extremely cold temperatures on face
* Reduces inflammation, tightens skin
* Done professionally or home (ice packs wrapped in soft cloth)

**Root causes to address:**

* Excessive sodium intake
* Dehydration
* Allergies
* Lack of sleep
* Hormonal changes

**ORBICULARIS OCULI MUSCLE - MOST IMPORTANT DISCOVERY:**

**THE PROOF:**

* Botox injection atrophied orbicularis oculi muscle (muscle giving aegyo sal when squinching)
* **Eye changed MASSIVELY**
* **Facial muscles have LARGE impact on eye shape** (from facial palsy association with sclera show)
* **MUSCLES MAY BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN ORBITAL COMPACTNESS/FORWARD GROWTH FOR EYE VERTICALITY**

**RESULTS FROM PARALYZED MUSCLE:**

* **PFH (palpebral fissure height) increased 30%** after orbicularis oculi paralyzed
* **Lower lid lost angularity and straightness** after atrophy
* **Upper eyelid came down** (not as much as lower but still) → **gives hunter/almond shaped eyes**
* ""Literally fucking insane""

**HOW TO BUILD THIS MUSCLE:**

* Hypertrophy muscle via **squinching**
* **Protocol:** Squinch relatively hard for **30 minutes 2x daily**
* After muscle built: lower frequency to maintain muscle mass
* **Result:** Free lower lid retraction (equivalent to Taban surgery) just by squinching
* **Note:** Will NOT help negative vector though

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**

* Can have forward growth orbitals/positive vector BUT still no straight lower lid if muscle weak
* Modern lifestyle: rotting in basement, never seeing sunlight more than 30min/week = weak orbicularis oculi
* This explains why lower lid wasn't straight despite having forward growth orbitals/positive vector",1,1764367436.0,LooksmaxingAdvice,2,1.0,False

My very best friend (35F) from the summer going into college (around 15+ years ago) was my ride or die. We would go to concerts together, pick classes together, tell each other everything, traveled abroad together, etc. She was in my wedding and did a lot for my wedding too (a lot was DIY). We picked out really thoughtful presents for each other since we know each other like the back of our hands.

My last job was part time since I’m having health issues and can’t work FT anymore. She was working this job with me and even though it was grueling work, it was better because she was in it with me. We would go out to eat together sometimes after our shifts. We both quit together when it got too much and the pay wasn’t that great to begin with. During this time, my spouse got a new job and a big pay increase. They told me that I didn’t need to force myself to work a job while going through my health issues and we were ok with money for me to do so. (This was about almost 3 years ago, for reference)

This is when my friend changed.

She offered to help me clean my house while I was on bedrest from surgery. We did pay her and when we got food delivered for dinner, we would order her something too. It was fine at first until she snapped and said I needed to be helping and that I could fold clothes in bed. I got really upset with her. I was on literal bedrest and we were paying her to help with these tasks. We decided to not continue that since I realized I was “mixing business & pleasure.”

I went out to dinner with her when I was feeling better and she asked what I was doing for my birthday. I told her about the restaurant that took months to get in and my spouse surprised me with it since I was depressed about my health. She opened her phone and made a reservation at the bar with the restaurant in a couple days. She said “well, I got in, I’ll let you know how it is.”

She ended up going with different friends and posted all about it. When she was telling me about it, she said she treated herself and ordered a lot of things. I felt kind of awkward because the last couple of times we went out, she said she couldn’t pay. I covered for her. She didn’t even offer to pay me back but that was kind of our friendship - I’ll get this coffee, you get the next one kinda thing.

So I got upset that she magically had money for the other outings she had? I gave her the benefit of the doubt - I wasn’t there so idk what happened. But I was hurt, it felt like she was rubbing it in my face that she got to go first but maybe she was jealous I was going? But she did ask…

So fast forward a couple months and we are at a Christmas tea that I booked and confirmed with her. We were going to do the gift exchange too. She texts me and tells me she’s running late. She shows up nearly an hour late and leaving me hanging because I can’t start the tea without her. When it comes to payment, she said she left her wallet at home. She smiled and said “I think it should be you guys gift to me for Christmas.” (Even though I bought her a present). I put my foot down and said no. She tells the waitress when I’m in the bathroom that I’m paying. I say no. She puts her hands up and says “well I don’t even have my wallet,” like it was planned. I was really upset and just paid.

I told her I needed to be alone and I drove to a coffee place 20ish minutes away. She followed me. I ordered a drink and I said she could stay but she’s paying her way (she said she went home to get her wallet since the coffee shop was near her house). I had a gift card that I’ve been wanting to use so I got a snack as well to finish the gift card. I shared the snack since it was a bigger thing than I thought. I go to the bathroom and come back. I noticed my phone wasn’t on the table and asked if she saw it. It was in my purse because she put it there. I thought nothing of it until I went to go pay with my gift card. She said she paid the bill with it - for her items too. At this point, I feel like I’m being used. I tell her she needs to handle tip then. She wouldn’t.

I throw her gift at her and say I’m going home (about a 40 min drive). She said, “wait, your gift is in the car.” She gives me my gift, which she had taken half of “to try.” Mine was a really thought out gift like usual. I tried to not be upset. Like she could have told me no gift or smaller gifts if she couldn’t afford one. But then she said she spent over $200 at the restaurant with the other friends. I told her I was upset about the day and left.

Note - during this time before the day of the tea - 

1.	⁠I also learned that she still texts my mom stuff about me even though I’ve went no contact with my mom and blocked my mom from all social media. I’m not sure WHAT she texts her. But it makes me uncomfortable and she tried to talk me into reconciling with my mom. My mom’s business was our first job together so it’s not really weird that she has her number.

2.	⁠I used to send her voice memos when I was too tired to text. It would be deep stuff like what I talked about in therapy, doctors appts, etc. I learned she was playing them to her mom (who is a nurse) and they would sit there and try to diagnose/help me. I know it was probably in best intentions, but it still irked me that my private stuff was being aired without my permission (I learned about this because she told me) 

So, I did stop talking to her & hanging out with her after this incident. She reached out once and said “it there’s anything I did to make you upset, that wasn’t my intention” - I left her on read because I told her VERY CLEARLY in person.

We haven’t talked or seen each other almost 3 years. I still miss her. Things remind me of her but she has other friends. I think maybe I wasn’t her best friend? Or if I was too much?

This year -

She posted on Facebook she got my dream job (she knows this) and didn’t even give me a heads up. I even wrote a reference letter for her years ago that she used to get it. I was crushed. I didn’t even want to say congrats but I did.

My grandpa passed away a couple months ago. She texted me. I got excited that I could have her back in my life. Turns out, my mom wasn’t going to the funeral and she asked her what kind of things they did. After I told her, she just abruptly stopped texting me again.

That was in July.

It’s in a weird spot and I feel like i let go of a good friend. But maybe she wasn’t.

Am I the AH for letting go of this friendship? Or was she the AH during it?

I decided to switch things up and use chenille yarn instead of regular yarn, which made my pup MUCH bigger than the original pattern size 😅 But I’m actually loving the chunky, oversized look! He’s super soft and squishy, and the texture is amazing.

He’s got all the pockets and cup holders working perfectly - I can fit my remote, phone, and my coffee mug right on his back. It’s functional AND adorable!

My very best friend (35F) from the summer going into college (around 15+ years ago) was my ride or die. We would go to concerts together, pick classes together, tell each other everything, traveled abroad together, etc. She was in my wedding and did a lot for my wedding too (a lot was DIY). We picked out really thoughtful presents for each other since we know each other like the back of our hands.

My last job was part time since I’m having health issues and can’t work FT anymore. She was working this job with me and even though it was grueling work, it was better because she was in it with me. We would go out to eat together sometimes after our shifts. We both quit together when it got too much and the pay wasn’t that great to begin with. During this time, my spouse got a new job and a big pay increase. They told me that I didn’t need to force myself to work a job while going through my health issues and we were ok with money for me to do so. (This was about almost 3 years ago, for reference)

1p97cs5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1p97cs5/coworker_crush/,Coworker Crush,"So... a lady and I started talking at work (we work at the same place but in different departments) back in April. She initiated the conversation due to my tattoos and that's how we ended up figuring out that we like the same music. We work in different departments and would usually run into each other and just chat. I wasn't really actively pursuing anything at the time, but I eventually thought ""Why not hang out with her and see how things go?""

Finally in September I invited her to a show and she gave me her number to send her the flyer. That was that. Then she started texting me with just small talk stuff (which I honestly wasn't expecting). You know, ""how was your weekend"" ""send me some bands"" kind of texts. When we do text, they're not small texts either. We tend to both go all out. 

She ended up not being able to go to the show but pitched the idea of us hanging out and grabbing coffee and food. We ended up doing that and just chatting. It was a good time. I didn't try and be even remotely flirty but she did drop a ""that's really cute"" to a few things I mentioned about myself. 

We made plans last week but they ended up getting canceled. Not a big deal. We made plans to reschedule. She did however call me and we ended up on the phone for over an hour just nonstop talking about music and other random things. 

Since then, I pitched rescheduling the next week but the weather was bad so it didn't happen. I haven't tried to make plans again due to not wanting to bother her every week. I've also been hoping she would hit me up for weekend plans, but I've heard nothing. 

Since talking to her more and getting to know her, I've found myself really liking her.

I guess the biggest issue in my head is that I can't tell if she's even remotely interested in me as more than that. I know the obvious thing to do is let her know how I feel and it either works out or we keep it friendly and I get over it. 

I've had a few friends at work say ""Dude, she's clearly into you"" but of course friends are going to say that. 

She's also not a big texter from what I can tell. We'll have few days where we go back and fourth, but for the most part, it's her initiating a text, me getting back a little later, and not hearing back for 1-3 days. I'm patient though. She does her thing and I do mine. She randomly apologized for that when we talked on the phone and I was understanding. We're both working adults. Not everyone is on their phone all the time. Some people don't like to text.

She is also INCREDIBLY shy and introverted at work... AND she didn't use her phone at all when we hung out. So idk if that might play a roll in the whole texting thing. Apparently when we hung out in October, that was the first time she's actually done something with someone since moving out here in March. 

She definitely likes her alone time... but she's also told me that she really wants to get out more. Especially concerts. 

Just wanted to give some insight on this entire thing. My plan is to just tell her how I feel about her next time we hang out. I just don't know when that's going to be. Yeah, rejection will suck if it happens, but I feel like I would rather just know for sure instead of being stuck here wondering. 

Anyway, just thought I'd post here to possibly get some advice and what not. I've been out of the dating game for 4 years and this all feels new to me again. ",1,1764367045.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Hey everyone! I got tired of scrolling through the endless grid of offers on capitaloneoffers.com and clicking ""View More Offers"" a million times. So I made a bookmarklet that:

1. **Automatically loads ALL offers** (no more clicking ""View More"")
2. **Shows them in a clean, sortable table**
3. **Lets you search by merchant name**
4. **Sort by Fixed Miles or X Miles** (find those 20X offers fast!)

# What it looks like

The bookmarklet shows a modal with all your offers in a table format:

1. **Merchant** \- Logo + domain name
2. **Miles** \- Fixed miles (green badge) or X multiplier (blue badge)
3. **Channel** \- Online/In-Store
4. **Open** \- Click to activate the offer

# How to Install

# Step 1: Create the Bookmark

1. Right-click your bookmarks bar
2. Click ""Add page..."" on Chrome or ""Add this page to Favorites..."" -> More on Edge
3. Name it something like **""C1 Offers Viewer""**
4. In the URL field, paste this entire code:

There are a few issues I see right away though. So anyone that has had it awhile I’d like your input please.

1.) one bag of sand is recommended but seems way too little so I used about 1.7 bags, hope that’s ok, it’s still doing it’s first spiral so I’ll see. 

2.) getting the sand even seems impossible. I figured if I just got it somewhat spread out that the ball and spiral would even it out but I’m already seeing thin spots in the spiral. Does this eventually fix itself or do I need to go back in and even it out more?

3.) lastly, the two issues with the app that I see is: first, every time you open the app you have to hit “connect”, seems silly to me why it wouldn’t auto connect. Have they said they were gonna fix this? And most importantly… every time I try to speed the ball speed up it says it can’t speed it up and resets to the middle. Every time. Is anyone else having this issue? Is there a fix? So far that’s the most annoying part is it’s going slow and knowing it can go faster but I can’t make it happen is frustrating. It’s mostly for the initial spiral. After that and the sand is even I guess I wouldn’t care about the speed too much.

Anyways, thanks for any info in advance!",1,1764366964.0,groundedlabs,0,1.0,False

i used to have really bad sleep apnea but the bi-pap helped me a lot, but when my shoulder feels like the strongest burning i've had, and my hand freezes up scooping ice for a drink, or holding a pitcher for a hot drink as a manager i just don't know what to do.

i feel defeated in a way, that my partner has to help me out and do things that i was able to do just months ago, standing hurts, laying down hurts, cooking and standing up hurts, getting in and out of my car hurts.

i went from lifting pounds and pounds of thing on my own and professionally dancing in my younger ages en pointe to just.. crying because i can't hold my phone for too long some days.

on top of that, my SM told me ""we're all in pain."" when i was sitting down while putting code on product with my bicep giving out on me. i loved this job, but new higher management, and a manager crunching under pressure saying that to me just made me cry the second he walked out of the back room.

i took a LOA due to it honestly, i feel so defeated and crushed after being so self sufficient usually, and on my hardest day of pain hearing that? i'm on meds, it's only been two months, but, that really knocked me down a peg when i was just starting to accept that i might need more help than im used to and accepting it where i should.",1,1764366750.0,Hashimotos,0,1.0,False

I moved to London at the beginning of this year and have been enjoying my days a lot (apart from the days in winter when it was dark by 3 pm...). I'm from Canada and decided to move here to fight my inner demons (Read: I wanted a change of pace and experience European culture).

I want to meet a girl to go to museums with, to visit Christmas markets with, to have coffee and talk deep topics on the balcony at 10 pm with, to go on weekend trips to Italy and see Roman statues and have authentic pizza with, but most of all, someone who simply enjoys my company as much I enjoy theirs.

About myself, I'm 26, Asian, 6 feet, and ever since I moved here, I've been doing a hella more cooking so I'm sure I can whip up a feast for you when you visit! I play games a lot on my PC, and my most played recently is Dead by Daylight, it's the only game where you can see characters from Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Halloween, and Alien all work together to repair some scuffed generators.

I've been playing Silksong and suffering from the bosses like everyone else, but I think it proves that I'm into masochism :) I've been takin German classes for the past weeks and I'd say that sie sind sehr interessant.

I’ve been reading the Bible for a good time and slowly came to realise things that the bible says that no other denomination believes, these things that the Bible specifically teaches. Also they don’t fully match any existing denomination. I’m wondering if anyone else out there believes something similar so we can talk or start a small group.

Here are my main beliefs. 

(Quickly I’m thinking of calling it Seven Day Millennial (SDM) as I believe in the Sabbath (seventh day) and the millennial (on Earth). (Can change if needed but stick with it for now)

✓ Bible alone — no extra books, prophets, or authorities(no LDS scriptures, no Ellen White, no added revelations)
✓ Full-immersion baptism

All shown in Revelation 20

✓ Humans are body + spirit + soul (1 Thessalonians 5:23)
✓ Soul sleep until Christ returns — the dead are unconscious (Ecclesiastes 9:5)
✓ Christ reigns on Earth for 1,000 years (millennium)✓ Lake of fire = final destruction, not eternal torment (Revelation 20:10; Revelation 20:14–15) 
✓ New Jerusalem comes down to Earth after judgment
✓ Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father alone (John 15:26)
✓ Jesus is the only mediator between God and humanity✓ The Trinity is real, but not the Filioque (John 15:26)✓ Satan is a literal spiritual being, not a red horned devil, not symbolic (Job 1:6–7; 2 Corinthians 11:14) 
✓ Seventh-day Sabbath (Saturday) is still God’s command (Exodus 20)
✓ The mark of the beast includes rejecting God's guidance and abandoning the Sabbath✓ The Ten Commandments are important, and should be followed as written — especially 2nd and 4th (all are important though)
✓ Use, 1 Corinthians 6:12 to teach that you should try to stay away from things that could control your body. Things like Coffee, Alcohol, Tobacco, other. It’s not dogma, but more like a strict ‘you probably should of you can’.

These are my core doctrinal beliefs, not the full list — just the main ones that shape my faith and don’t match any major denomination. If any of you have the same or very nearly the same I would like to find any of you out there.

My issue is the house that wants me to bring in all my own food almost never has fridge space available for my food, like I’d be doing good to get a quart of milk in their fridge. And they typically see if I’m available 2+ weeks in advance, so it’s not like a last-minute emergency trip, they had time to use up food / make space for me to put my food.

What’s the best way to discuss the issue. Ask them if they could have space in the fridge for me to put some food? Ask if they have a problem if I move things around to make space? Just move things as needed?",1,1764366481.0,petsitting,1,1.0,False

2. Dishwasher £600. I lived alone and thought it didnt make sense to get a dishwasher. I needed one. I got a sexy dishwasher. That 3 day old cereal bowl what would normally need a scrub scrub? Spotless after the dishwasher. 

3. Steam mop £110. No detergent necessary. Just water. Put it on. Mop. The end. No filling a bucket. Putting it in. Bucket water is now contaminated and tile streaks. 

4. A pull out coffee table £70 but with wheels. I saw these on tiktok where the top part comes out. We bought it and then my husband added wheels to the bottom. GAME CHANGER. Can roll the table anywhere. 

5. Dyson Air wrap. Once I learnt how to use a round brush to style a blowout this air wrap is just heaven. Unfortunately its not dual voltage but I can give myself a blowout in 30 minutes. I bought a diffuser head attachment. Lovely. Spectacular. But I would probably buy it used.

We're in our mid to late twenties.

We met on a lesbian dating app, she likes me first and then we match. She initates the flirting, asks me questions and calls me cute.

She went dry once (hadn't responded in a few days) and I double texted. She gave me her number saying she responds quicker and encouraging me to double text because she gets caught up. I text it, we chat, send reaction memes, and I ask her out

The date went great. Lots of chemistry, extended the date, went out for italian food, brought me a book, i initated holding hands, flirted, SHE broke the touch barrier, and she asks to kiss me, strokes my hair

She mentions at the end of the date for a second one, then she tells me again over text that she'd love to take me out again and how endearing I was. 

It went dry for several days, she says she sick and asks me if I'm okay with postponing. Which i believe, cause my city had a ton of cases

Ive double texted one other time or two, she's replied but this time it's been almost two weeks and no answer. 

One thing I will say that keeps me from assuming the worst and moving on, is that she's a professor teaching about 4 to 5 classes, and I as a (she's not my professor)student, know that this is the busiest time of year for college. Projects due, papers and exams. When she replied saying she was sick she told me she had about 300 papers she had to get into.

When she does get back to me, she asks how my week has been and things. On one hand, everyone has their phone, but on another she seems extremely busy, 10 hour shifts, grading then office hours, this was just one date she has no obligation to me

But, she did make time for me for our date, was very engaged and in my interests and set the whole thing up, and I don't want to triple text her especially on Thanksgiving and the break

I'm working 36 hours a week and in 5 classes, and I feel like dying, so I can truly imagine her end. She works 10 hours a day, along with office hours

TLDR: We met on a dating app, she initates the flirting, and has gone dry. She slipped her number to me, saying she encourages me to double text and she gets caught up. we move off the app, some convo then I ask her out. Our coffee date is filled with chemistry, laughs, nerdy convos, she breaks the touch barrier, suggests italian food which she offered to buy,  we move to a bookstore, she buys me a book, we hold hands, we flirt, and at the end of the date she initates a kiss and plays with my hair. She suggests a 2nd date in person and again over text. 

She's a professor, teaching 4 or 5 classes, and she has been open about how her job is extremely busy. Its been 15 days since I heard back from her, texted last Saturday, and there hasn't been a response. I'm assuming she'll get back to me, but I don't want to triple text, but at the same time I'm willing to do that i just don't want to come off as clingy or obsessive. My gut doesn't tell me she's playing games with me",2,1764366306.0,actuallesbians,3,1.0,False

Google defines me as the instrument used for writing/drawing with ink; boring people with the personality of a beige wall call me a ‘pen’.   
  
Today, i’m going to tell you about the story of my life. it all started when i was deep asleep at the stationery shop ( yes, the one next to nescafe) when this girl came in and asked for a pen. The shopkeeper woke me up from my slumber and slammed both my twin and me on the counter. ikr, bloody idiot. That girl gave me a look and said, “not pretty enough.” i was like, “ girl, you ain’t even pretty enough. did you even see me carefully? My body leaner than you, taller than you and glowing shinier than your future can ever get. you just insecure.” Are all the people in this uni dumb, or just the ones that i’ve met till now?  
Anyway, a few secs later, a boy comes in, plain white shirt with sleeves rolled up, light blue jeans, hair perfectly tousled and coiffed, looking hotter than a goddamn volcano. he, in the most nonchalant manner, picks up my twin, pays its price and leaves. this girl is awestruck. i’m sure, sis just experienced love at first sight. but, look how quickly the tables turned, she now finds me prettier than a fuckin’ parker. ofc, she bought me and shoved me in her pocket. half of me was still peeking out of the pocket - talk about girls’ jeans’ pockets, Duh!. i got no issues tho, i get to look at the campus, which btw is gorgeous!   
  
we then go to a class. this silly girl forgets that i’m still in her pocket and lays her ass down. i poke her in the tummy. obv, how can somebody forget me. you forget about me, i take revenge! honestly, the prof was really boring. he was just yapping about idk what was that, posets, maybe? so, i looked around to see - a boy spinning my ex faster than ultra-dense remnants of supernova explosions. get her boy, she cheated on me with a golden trimax. she deserves it. i tried looking for that mf trimax. found it, bro was in a fuckin’ pen fight, praying for his life, right at the table cliff. and yipeee, it fell down. i was finally enjoying this class but the lecture ended and little miss dropped me in her bag. it was all dark in there, it was scary, yk?   
  
at night, she got me out. she stared at me for 2 mins straight; baby girl, i know, i’m pretty, but get a grip. she finally says something, “oh, he looked so divine today. can’t believe i have the same pen as him!” Ahhh…now i get it. she’s thinking about the boy. she removes my cap and finally doodles something with me. its X ♡ Y. Ohh…so, these are their names. That night, she writes a love letter addressed to him with me. Oh, what a bliss to write beautiful confessions of love with my blue blood!   
  
everytime, she catches a glimpse of him, she comes back and writes it down with me. she’s kept me for this sole reason. we’re today writing our 15th love-letter to him that would never get to see light of the day. if only she put this level of dedication into her studies, her academics would’ve finally made their much anticipated comeback!   
Anyways, Until next time,folks. see ya!

Broke up 1 month ago and she turned atraight avoidant. She left me. Says she are not compatible and she has to do what's best for her. 2 weeks before that i caught her ex at her house during a surprise visit. She swears he was just bringing her coffee. She had been voicing her ""concerns"" about me which were valid. I could have done better at times but I am still a solid partner. So says they had been trying to repair their friendship, while we were having relationship issues. She is the type thay is friends with ""all her exs"". She painted it normal and I voiced my concerns throughout the relationship.

I was spiraling but she said it would be hard but we would work it out. She would do whatever it takes. She would not reach out at all but view my SM stories. She would give me no emotion at all. Gave me a hug after I picked up my stuff. Messaged me on the drive back how she didn't mean to be short and it was very nice to see me. 

She commented a few days later on a story referring to my dog by his pet name we, and only we, would call him. I had to unfollpw her on all socials after that. That was sunday.

I texted her I missed her and happy Thanksgiving on wednesday. No reply and now she views my messages and just not respond at anything. This is no contact now and it is devastating. A woman who said she loved me and wanted to have my children. I dont even get the dignity or respect of her being direct. It is the absolute worst feeling. Today is day one for the fifth time or something. It just doesnt get easier. 

She mended her image with my forgiveness and willingness to work through it all to future fake me, abandon me, say we are not compatible when we absolutely were, emotional whiplash me, manipulate me with momentary reassurance to save herself. Now I am left alone to fix this all by myself. I have so many amazing friends and family. It doesnt help with the pain she has caused. She took a peice of me im not sure i can get back.

1p96xx3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p96xx3,Feeling stumped on furniture.,"I would love to hear some thoughts on how to furnish this living room. Some notes for your thought process:

-In an ideal world, seating would include at least one glider rocking chair (it doesn’t have to also be a recliner, but I’m looking for black “leather” seating and most of the ones I’m seeing in black also recline, so that would need more space), and either a small L shaped sofa or sofa with chaise.

-The right side of this room is oddly shaped, you can see in the second picture that the kitchen island juts out further than the beginning wall of the living space. My thought is to have some combination of cat tree/shelves and a bookcase(s) in that “dead” space. 

-To leave a walk way around the island, the “living room” space basically starts on the left side of the cat tree, where there is a tape mark on the base board. If thinking of the living room space as going from the mark on the baseboards to the rug laying behind the couch, the space is 140” x 140”, or about 11.5’ x 11.5’, but need to account for the sliding glass door opening on the right side behind the curtain. 

-The TV will not be mounted because I plan to do some trim work on the wall and that would force the tv to be too high and too far to the left (last pic is a partial blocking out of the trim). 

-Plan to replace the couch, not married to the coffee table or cat tree (just the cats).

1p96xoy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p96xoy,Feeling stumped on furniture.,"I would love to hear some thoughts on how to furnish this living room. Some notes for your thought process:

-In an ideal world, seating would include at least one glider rocking chair (it doesn’t have to also be a recliner, but I’m looking for black “leather” seating and most of the ones I’m seeing in black also recline, so that would need more space), and either a small L shaped sofa or sofa with chaise.

-The right side of this room is oddly shaped, you can see in the second picture that the kitchen island juts out further than the beginning wall of the living space. My thought is to have some combination of cat tree/shelves and a bookcase(s) in that “dead” space. 

-To leave a walk way around the island, the “living room” space basically starts on the left side of the cat tree, where there is a tape mark on the base board. If thinking of the living room space as going from the mark on the baseboards to the rug laying behind the couch, the space is 140” x 140”, or about 11.5’ x 11.5’, but need to account for the sliding glass door opening on the right side behind the curtain. 

-The TV will not be mounted because I plan to do some trim work on the wall and that would force the tv to be too high and too far to the left (last pic is a partial blocking out of the trim). 

-Plan to replace the couch, not married to the coffee table or cat tree (just the cats).

1p96vi0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesOfDustAndCode/comments/1p96vi0/slipstream_dreams/,Slipstream Dreams,"Elly was late for work. Again.

It wasn’t entirely her fault, though she knew her manager would insist otherwise. It took time to find a slip dress at this ridiculous hour. Dawn was barely smudging the horizon, and most of the corner shops didn’t even bother stocking real clothing anymore. Synthetic overlays? Sure. Projected wardrobes? Everywhere. Actual fabric? That took searching.

But she found one. A shimmering black slip that clung to her like a second skin — so light she genuinely couldn’t feel it. Not even the whisper of a seam. Perfect for the role, though. Customers paid extra for authenticity, and if they were buying the “Vintage Noir Lounge Hostess” package, they wanted the real, physical thing. No holoprojection could replace the way fabric moved on its own.

Of course, she couldn’t do her own makeup. Not for a gig like this. So she’d dragged her friend Mira out of bed, begging for a steady hand and a wake-up stim. Mira sighed dramatically the whole time but still transformed Elly’s face into soft-edged celestial perfection: smoky eyes, glassy lips, the faintest highlight catching the bones beneath.

“You’re impossible,” Mira had muttered, but she’d still pressed a pair of shimmering high heels into Elly’s hands — shoes that looked designed to break ankles and hearts at the same time.

Now Elly slid her feet into them, let out a breath, and watched Mira give her an approving thumbs-up.

That was her cue.

She stepped into the Holoden.

Most cafés — or “Holdens,” as the slang had evolved — were just five-and-dime places. Cheap escapism. People rushed in for a fast hit of fantasy, a quick emotional reset, sometimes a pretend hug or a cozy conversation with a simulated friend. Then they rushed back out again. Disposable dreams in disposable spaces.

But not hers.

Elly worked as a live actor inside these Holodens — the expensive kind. The rare kind. The ones that attracted people willing to pay real money for real things in a fake world.

Roles could be brutal: long hours, emotional labor, improvisation so tight you had to stitch it to your ribs. Someone once told her actors were the therapists of the future. She wasn’t sure she agreed with that — but she did understand why people kept coming back.

They didn’t want perfection.

They wanted someone who *could actually feel.*

And Elly had grown up inside one of these places. Born, raised, educated, and socialized in a simulation. Technically, she’d lived in a “Kinesthetic Reality Immersion Environment,” though everyone just called it “the Pod Village.” It was a corporate experiment that was eventually shut down — too expensive, too ethically questionable, too many messy questions about what counted as real childhood development.

She’d been released into the world at thirteen with a handful of other Pod kids. Most of them struggled. A few fell through the cracks completely.

Elly… adapted.

The irony of working in the same kind of space that created her never crossed her mind. Not really. She told herself she was good at her job because she understood the architecture of simulated worlds. But the truth was simpler:

She felt more at home inside them than outside.

Her upbringing gave her an edge — a real-life sense of presence that audiences could detect instantly. And in a field where nearly ten percent of the planet’s population were actors of some sort, that edge mattered. Everyone wanted to be a performer now. Even people who had never set foot on a stage. They lived-to-stream, lived-to-curate, lived-to-project themselves into a million digital mirrors.

Her metro village was almost entirely actors and coffee shops. A perfect storm of caffeine, competition, and artistic ambition. Some people found it exhausting.

Elly found it comforting.

But she did struggle — always had — with the divide between what was real and what wasn’t. Not existentially. Emotionally.

It wasn’t that she couldn’t tell the difference.

It was that her heart didn’t care.



The Holoden’s stage-floor rippled beneath her as she emerged. Her environment loaded around her with a shiver of green-gold light, resolving into the hazy neon interior of *The Velvet Ember Lounge*. The set was thick with retro-futurist atmosphere: velvet booths, soft holographic smoke curling toward a non-existent ceiling, a polished bar that shimmered with shifting art deco patterns.

Tonight’s role: hostess.

Charm, comfort, charisma — in that order.

She slipped behind the bar to prep a few props, letting her hands glide over real bottles and fake glassware. Customers liked the tactile element, even if the drinks themselves were just coded experiences injected through the Holoden’s emotional feedback layer.

Her first guest materialized with a soft chiming cue: a man in a well-tailored suit, eyes haunted, shoulders tense.

She smiled softly. “Long night, sweetheart?”

He blinked, startled. “You’re… real.”

“That’s the idea.”

People always said that. As if the whole damn point wasn’t to talk to someone who could actually listen.

She guided him to a booth, settled opposite him, and let him talk. That was part of the craft — letting silence become an invitation. He loosened, slowly, and shared bits of his life: a broken engagement, a fading sense of purpose, the crushing loneliness that came from living in a city where everyone was performing.

Elly gave him warmth. Eye contact. A gentle shoulder-touch when he truly needed it. No holoactor could replicate the subtle tension of living muscles or the micro-stutters of real breath.

By the time he evaporated from the booth — session expired — he looked lighter.

People always did.

She leaned back, letting the simulation’s ambient jazz wash over her, savoring a moment’s quiet. She wasn’t tired yet, but she felt that familiar hollow behind her ribs — the place where she wished someone would ask *her* how *she* was doing.

She pushed it aside.

Another guest materialized.

Then another.

Hours blurred into soft conversations, improvised giggles, faux-flirtation, and the strange intimacy of strangers confiding in her because she was safe and temporary.

Mid-shift, her environment glitched — a flicker in the bar’s lighting that only someone raised in a Pod Village would notice. A hairline crack in the illusion.

Most actors wouldn’t have caught it.

Most customers wouldn’t have cared.

But to Elly? It stung. A reminder that she was, in some ways, still living in the same kind of artificial cradle that raised her.

She steadied herself, reset her smile, and kept moving.

Late in the night — maybe near closing — she found the bar empty except for a single new arrival. A woman with quiet eyes, sitting alone.

No projected fantasies, no exaggerated persona.

She looked… real. Uncomfortably real.

Elly approached. “Rough night?”

The woman shrugged. “Not really. Just wanted to see you.”

“Me?”

“I’ve been coming here a long time,” the woman said. “Not always on your shifts. But… you get people. You really do.”

A warmth spread across Elly’s chest — rare, fragile. “Thank you. That means a lot.”

The woman nodded. “Has anyone ever asked what *you* need?”

The question hit harder than it should have.

Elly opened her mouth — no words at first. Then: “I don’t know.”

“Maybe think about it,” the woman said gently. “You deserve something real, too.”

Then she vanished. Session ended.

Elly sat frozen for a long moment.

For the first time in years, the Holoden felt too small.

Too weightless.

Too… not enough.

But the music kept playing softly, the simulation breathing around her like a familiar dream. She looked at her hands — steady, controlled, practiced — and wondered what they would reach for if she ever stepped truly outside.

Maybe tomorrow she’d find out.

Maybe.

For now? She slipped back behind the bar, took a long theatrical breath, and prepared for the final session of the night.

A real person in a fake world.

They, along with their guide, Katyosha, are trying to find a way to the downtown portion of the region

————————-

1864 AD
Kleinsville Anomalous Area 
1 year after the destruction of Scylios
Colonel Lawrence Balthazar

	I take a long, greedy drag of my cigarette, held between my fingers. I  had just situated myself in an elegant bar. Well, it was elegant for a Hunter bar. I had been waiting for my confidants who were out in the bazaar of a little town called Hunter’s Respite gathering supplies. A jaunty tune was playing on a box that I had personally never seen before. A genre of music I was not entirely accustomed to… No. The bar itself was rather empty, which was fairly typical for midday… No bar flies when the only time you could work in this dreaded cesspit was during the daylight. The bartender was a curious fellow. His entire form was wrapped in coats, and fur. I couldn’t tell who exactly this fellow was, but the gas mask he insistently wore took the place of his features. A real stand up gentleman, if I were to say so myself. He ever so clichely wiped the table down with a wet rag, and he spoke to me in a very thick accent.
“Hey, my friend! I couldn’t help but notice you don’t have a drink in your hand! Heheh… Come on, how about Ol’ Dyatlov giving you a splash, huh? You just came into town, after all! The boat ride gives anyone a thirst!” 
I smirk ever so slightly, yes the gentlemen was quite right. I was very exhausted from my journey to this place. It was funny, it was only about a 30km trot to this settlement, and yet it felt like it had taken us an eternity… Still, though, I was in need of my sober mind, so I politely declined. 
“No, my dear friend, as much as I’d love to indulge, I mustn't.” 
The man only chuckles, and without consent, he places two small shot glasses down, and an unmarked bottle. He uncorked the horrifying bottle, and poured from it a liquid of clear color. I couldn’t contain myself, I was in such a lively mood after all. I chuckle as I shake my hands, insisting he stops!
“No, no, my friend! I really can't!""
“Ohhh, come on! On the house! Do you know how many have made it to this place? 32, and that’s including your crew! You oughta celebrate, hunter! You made it! Enjoy it while it lasts, ‘cause it doesn't get any easier from here on out!”
“Ah… Well, if it’s on the house…” 
I roll my eyes, a stupid grin still plastered on my face. Yes, I was feeling quite jubilated, our merry band of misfits had just crossed a monumental checkpoint. I grab the shotglass between my fingers, and give the barman a cheer. He pulls his gasmask back, just enough to reveal the fuzzy face of a Tabaxi, and downs the liquid. I follow suit, and to my utter horror, I feel a thousand burning suns all simultaneously punching me right in the face as I slam the shotglass down on the ground. I cough erratically, my fist covering the spittle as my cheek turns a deep cherry red.
“Ahahaha! First time tasting Dyatlov’s brew, hits harder then your first sweetheart eh? Congratulations on losing your virginity a second time my friend!” 
He leans over the counter and pats me hard on the shoulder, before pulling his mask down. Already, the toxic tincture I had ingested had me reeling through the 9 hells. He continued.
“I didn’t get your name, by the by!” 
How the hell was he able to down that elixir with zero reaction? I shake my face and introduce myself to him, even if the man I was talking to was now blurring.
“Gahhh..” I painfully exert, my breath strong enough to catch on fire “Lawrence…. Colonel Lawrence Balthazar of the Grand Army of Scylios. I am here with my comrades Newman, Rutger, and General Khor….” 
Dyatlov grunted, trailing off into an uncomfortable whine as he heard the words “Scylios”. He rapped his fingers. His expression was unreadable, perhaps it was on purpose, but he spoke.
“Shit… the General Khor? Savior of Scylios? What the hell is a man like that doing here?” 
I didn’t say anything, my own expression began to sour at the mention. Scylios was a sore subject. There were not a lot of survivors of the Scylios disaster. I myself was with Colonel Rutger, and General Khor, escorting our King back to our city when we heard the explosion. It was still a very raw memory, but none were more perturbed than General Khor. The man who broke the bonds of slavery, and rose up against his oppressors. Valiantly defending Scylios against waves of warforged and the best Handelshaffen had to offer, and in a single pen stroke, everything he fought for, everything he sacrificed for, was erased from existence faster than a blink of an eye.  I decided to answer Dyatlov’s question with another question.
“Tell me, when you lose everything and you don’t even know why, what other choice do you have but to look for answers in the unexplainable?” 
Dyatlov stared into my eyes for a few moments, and shrugged
“I guess that’s fair… Sheesh. Free drinks for all of you, tonight.” 
I once again smiled, and declined the offer. The door to the small bar swung open, heavy footsteps following the incursion. In walked a half elf, with a tan coat, and a large backpack. His hair was thinning, and a perpetual stubble seemed stuck to his face. All over his were relics— spawn of the Collapse, tethered to him like idols, or icons. A bushy moss ball, a crystal star, and even a worn plush of a little baby chick. I smiled upon seeing my friend, and he in turn smiled back! 
“Katyosha!” 
I say gleefully, raising my empty shot glass, his eyes fixed upon it.
“Oh jeeze… Hey, Dyatlov, you already making him slug your garbage?” 
He says as he extends his hand, shaking Dyatlov’s
“Heyyy, look who the Kat dragged in eh? It’s so good to see you again my friend! Whaaaat… you too busy to come in and drop in on your old pal? Bah!” 
Dyatlov nearly pulled Kat over the bar to embrace him in a brotherly hug. Kat chuckles and pats him on the back, before prying himself away.
	“I know— Dyatlov, I know! Halcyon just keeps me so damn busy, but these guys paid me decent money to take them here, and map out some territory to the southeast!” 
Kat sat down next to me, his chair creaking. A stroke of luck, Katyosha was, he was the most knowledgeable of the collapse, and we both wanted to go to downtown Kleinsville. Our cooperation has made the task almost trivial, well, at least relatively. He tapped his fingers on the bar table, and soon enough, Kat was given a shot glass full of the deceptive biohazard, downing it with a deep groan, a curled fist, and a physical reaction bordering on a complete seizure. Dyatlov and I laughed at the display, an uneasy smile growing on Kat’s face. 
“Ahah.. Alright, alright… Balthazar, buddy, just wanted to tell you that we’re staying the night here. Your boys should be coming back soon, I think they’re just negotiating for some ammunition from the gun gal…” 
He rocked the shot glass against the table, fidgeting. Kat was a curious sort. He had lived in Halcyon all his life, and in that time he had become something of an everyman. If you had a problem? You go to Kat, because he knows how to fix it. If you want someone to scout a dangerous anomaly field? You go send Kat, because he knows how to navigate it. If you want fresh food? You better see Kat, because he’s the only person who can hunt game in the collapse. He was affectionately known as “The First Hunter”, for he was the first one to lead Xivian expeditions into Kleinsville, and he was the first to discover relics and bring them forward. He was the first to live the every growing lifestyle of plunging headfirst into danger and pulling out a rucksack full of ill gotten goods by your teeth as you crawl and weave through anomaly fields like a man who has nothing left to lose, though if you asked him why he did all of this, he’d tell you he did it for his family, who elected not to stay with him in Kleinsville, despite the go back orders. 
After a while of talking, and some mugs of ale freely given to us, the door creaked once again. The others in our group had turned up. Newman, Rutger, and Khor meander their way through. Newman dressed very traditionally, even though the Grand Army of Scylios was far from grand nowadays, he still wore his platemail armor with pride. Rutger wore something more practical, but still wore the blue colors of Scylios. Khore, the tallest of all of us half-orcs, wore his general's uniform, excluding his cap. Apparently, Khor and Katyosha had something of a shared history… During the Great War where Xivia liberated Kleinsville and helped the orcs take Scylios, a much younger first corporal Alenko led a battalion in a counter offensive after the great siege of Scylios. Two great men, once sharing a battlefield, were now in the armpit of a lowly tavern at the proverbial end of the world, both with no homes, or anywhere to go back to, sharing a new cause, rebuilding their lives. Khor spoke, breaking the idle chatter and greetings.
“Men.” 
His tone was deep, commanding, and powerful. His voice had an effect on people, anyone who was fortunate enough to be guided by him had the pleasure of following his orders. There was a certain legendary conviction in each and every syllable he spoke, and he never talked down to you either. With Khor, you were a part of his team, and he knew it. When he spoke, you knew he spoke from the heart, and with you in mind. 
“Tomorrow we embark towards the epicenter of Kleinsville. Tomorrow we will search for the power within the city to bring stability to our homes. We have lost so much already, and the road will only get tougher from here on out, but I have faith in each and every one of you. If you have any doubts of our success, or feel as if the risk is not worth the reward, then I urge you to turn back, for your efforts will be better suited to helping our brothers and sisters in New Scyo, but if you are strong of heart, if you believe in this cause, and you have fire in your soul, then you will stick with me, and together, we will kick open the gates of the hells itself to wrestle salvation from the jaws of evil!”
He slams his mug firmly down on the table, eliciting a unanimous response from Newman, Rutger, and I. We raise our mugs and scream…
“Yes, General Khor!”
And he raises his mug in turn.
“Fantastic!” 
And we all take a hearty drink. Colonel Rutger wipes a fine film of foam off his upper lip, and asks a poignant question, in that same airy almost arrogant tone for someone of his young age
“So, my general… What’s the plan?” 
Khor, with his wizened manner, bowed his head towards Kat, who, for the moment, had let us revel in the camaraderie unabated. Kat tilted his head up, and laid out the plans for getting downtown.
“Well… I have a friend out in these parts. He’s… special, but he’s got an absolute knack for the Collapse. Kid’s name is Foxglove—”
Newman cleared his throat, interrupting Kat.
“Excuse me, Katyosha…” He spoke softly, politely “I don’t mean to pry, but why do hunters give themselves such… nicknames? I mean, you call yourself Kat, we met Gizmo and Bubba, and now we’re going to meet someone named after a flower?” 
Kat looked a bit confused, and sort of shrugged.
“Iunno… Maybe we just like the anonymity, maybe it just sounds cool… Anywhoseit… Foxglove’s been scouting the southeast for a good long while now. Last I heard from him, he had found something interesting in a place called Golden Wyvern cave— something really spooky. So, we’re going to meet him there and get the scoop.” 
Khor simply nodded in agreement, adhering to Kat’s logic as gospel. Truth was, the southwest led to simply nothing, however, the only known way to get to the downtown was an absolute no go, not only was it dreadfully far away, on the northern edge of the 2nd perimeter we were in, the Entertainment District was supposedly haunted, and those who tread on such hallowed grounds were doomed to stay with the ghosts forever trapped in the past, so it was safer to chase rumors in that regard. 
“Well, I for one look forward to meeting this fellow, Kat. If he is even one fifth of the explorer as you are, my friend, then he will be nothing but a boon in our conquest!” 
Kat smiled, and nodded, also taking a sip from his mug.
“Oh he’s great, but he’s a little… awkward. He wasn’t a people person before the Collapse, and he’s only ever gotten more squirrely…” 
Khor once again spoke, cutting through the faint stupor we were all drinking ourselves into.
“Let us finish our drinks, and rest my men. Rutger has procured us a place to rest, correct?”
Khor glances at Rutger, with that same steely gaze
“Yeaah… Little house in the town square. No squatters, and there are enough beds for all five of us.”
“Thank you, my son.” 
We finish our drinks, now properly hazed by Dyatlov’s natural remedies, and we exit to the town square. Hunter’s Respite was an interesting little town. Before the collapse it was a trapping and trading town. Even now, old huts for trading pelts, furs and meats still stood, being repurposed for trading and the like. It was difficult for the hunters this close to Kleinsville, mostly due to the scarcity of the population, but what they lacked in outward demand, they more than made up for it in absolute necessity. Believe it or not, people still needed to eat this deep in the collapse, and they would charge you for it. 15 gold for a loaf of bread, 20 for a stick of sausage. Calories were a currency here, and you had to carefully choose how you spent them, because if you burn more calories than you earn gold, you would starve to death, and god forbid any of these slimy traders give you an ounce of clean water or breadcrumbs… because then you’d be in their debt forever. 
	The town square wasn’t all that large, and soon enough we found ourselves in that neat abandoned little house. It seemed like a lodge, or hotel of sorts, made completely with logs. There were deer antlers hanging over a fireplace, which we elected to light and warm up, bundled together. The five of us put our hands close to the orangey brilliance. I was curious, so I spoke up.
	“So… What was this place, Kat? Some sort of hotel?” 
	I turned to the man, who was lazily sipping at the contents of his flask, screwing it back with a delighted sigh. He smiled that same dopey smile that accentuated his dimples, and regaled.
	“This place? Oh it was a little lodge run by this really wound up dragonborn. He was all smiles and continental breakfasts to the people that paid him, but he was easily the richest man in town, and he turned his nose up at EVERYONE. Little Snotbag would lose all his money drinking and gambling in the entertainment district, and come back to act like he was some sort of great host. Don’t get me wrong, the dude knew how to make a cozy little lodge, but man he had an ego the size of Mt. Gullhoyden.” 
	Colonel Rutger scoffed, a wry smile creeping towards his lips.
	“I would have punched his freaking lights out, I hate assholes like that.” 
	We all collectively chuckled at the mental image, and we continued to warm up and wait for the sun to dip low. We slept comfortably in the beds that were gently used, and drifted off. When my eyes opened, I stretched. Time seemed to move languidly as I peered outside the window, an eternal oppressive orange glow bleeding onto the town. My ears prickle as a shrill whine penetrated my head. My head began to ache with a familiar sound, what was that…? A baby? It whined just like one… that falsetto scream, demanding, wanting. Anxiety had begun to overwhelm me, the whining sounded as if it was coming from the first floor. I opened the door and tried to yell for my friends, yelling at them to come out, but there was no response. I was completely alone, it seemed. My boots creaked against the wooden floorboards and I opened the doors to their room. Their stuff was arranged, as if they were here, but the beds lacked warm bodies… Maybe I was last to wake? The screaming was unbearable now, I tried to cover my ears, but it seemed as if the screaming was reverberating inside my skull. I groan and run down the stairs, back to that small little lobby where we rested our calloused hands against the fire, the screeching and whining and crying getting LOUDER and LOUDER! Madness! ABSOLUTE MADNESS! I start to hyperventilate, and tears too well in my eyes, obfuscating my vision as I finally find the source. In the middle of the lounge, I see a crib… The horrific cradle from which this deafening sound tortured me so, as I continued to walk down the stairs, I see wires… metal wires… colored wires… wires that hummed… wires that whirred… all descending from the ceiling and into that cradle. Fear had gripped me… pure unadulterated fear, and pain, and yet my feet were moving forward. One foot in front of the over, another step down. The closer I got, the louder the screeching became, until the thing in that cradle stopped taking breaks, it simply held one shrieking note, no breaths taken. Finally I peer over the crib, and I see an unmoving lump hidden under bedsheets. All the wires were connected, running under the sheet. My hands shake as I grip the sheets, and rip them back. I can’t in good conscience describe what I saw. It sickened me to my core. I had never seen anything so profane, so abhorrent. The shrieks had turned into a distant dull metronome of sharp pain as I recoiled at the sight. I double over, and fall to my hands and knees, expelling the contents of my stomach onto the floor below. I see boots in front of me, another living breathing person in this hell?! I see a gloved hand extend, pale and fleshy, and I grab ahold of it. I see the face of Kat, who also had tears in his eyes, though there was no terror painted on his face, just… melancholy. 
	Once he brought me to my feet, he slowly walked over to the crib, his footsteps silent, as he reached into the crib, and gently started to coo at it, like a father would a child. He shushed it, he whispered… and his eyes wandered back to me. His eyes were deathly sunken, as if he was sleep deprived, but the screaming slowly stopped, the pain was wavering… I collapse once more, reveling in the sheer relief, and I close my eyes.
	When I opened them, I was back in my bed. I coughed as I choked on my own spit, leaning over and grabbing my head. My ears rang, and I could still hear the screaming in my mind's eye, but the pain was completely absent, only the memory of the pain, and that too was slowly fading from my mind. I shake my head, and prepare myself. The sun had now, as it should, gently rose beyond the horizon, bathing the town in a delightful golden hue. I was still clutching my chest, breathing heavily… What was that? That was no dream, that was a vision, and I was sure of it. I had to find Kat. I threw on my uniform, and adorned my metal helmet upon my hat as I ripped open the door to locate the man. I was the first to rise it seems, but not the first to wake. Katyosha, in his room, was tying those boots I had in my dream. He looked at me, and smiled.
	“Hey, Balthazar!” He could see the look on my face “You doing alright…?”  
	He knew. My hands balled up into fists… I wanted answers. He defensively put his hands up.
	“Woah… So it really was you in that vision? Calm down… I… I’ll try to explain it the best I can…” 
	I step forward and I press my finger against his chest, hard
	“What was that I saw? Why were YOU there? What… What was that awful noise…” 
	His face sort of screws up, as he takes a wide step back, leaning against the window pane in his room.
	“The Collapse… It’s… it does things to your mind, if you stay in it for too long. If you’re attuned enough, or cursed, you’ll hear it. It cries, like that. It cries a lot. Sometimes it cries harder than other times… But…” 
	He scratches his face, and that same melancholy look washes over him, something I haven’t seen outside of that moment. 
	“Whatever is in Kleinsville, whatever is in downtown. I don’t think it’s doing all of this on purpose. I think someone is hurting it…”
	“That implies that you think Kleinsville is… alive…” 
	I skeptically point out the fact that he was humanizing this place, giving it a personality, a face… What I saw, it was no human I’ve ever seen.
	“Don’t you see, Balthazar? Kleinsville is alive. It can see inside of us all, it can strip our layers, and it does. It learns from us, and it’s… it’s crying, Balthazar. It’s crying…” 
	My chin quivers, what was Kat saying? It barely made sense. He knew what was in the center of Kleinsville? He knew what we were after? I voice my concerns.
	“You… know what it is, and… you haven’t told us?”
	Kat shakes his head, and waves his arms defensively.
	“No, No, NO, man! I don’t know what it is, I’ve only seen it in my visions, and in my dreams… I… I didn’t even know we could share these visions up until now— That’s what we’re here to do, right? To figure out what this is?”
	He stepped forward, and he began to animate his body, his arms raising in the air, accentuating his words.
	“Maybe Kleinsville holds the key to rebuilding Scylios? Maybe Kleinsville can cure the accursed that wither in refugee camps… Maybe it’s nothing, and all of this is pointless… Maybe it’s EVERYTHING and our universe is contained inside of it? Infinite power? Wealth? Damnation? Death? Who knows!?”
	He threw his body this way, and that way, waxing philosophies I could barely understand. My head was starting to hurt again… but he put his hands against my head, holding it tightly as he leaned in. I could see every inch of his face, not a single follicle on his scraggly beard went unnoticed. I could feel the warmth radiating from his skin, and I could smell his sweet breath invading my nose. He leaves me with an ominous warning for things to come
	“But by the stars that shine our way. We have to find out, for the sake of my children, for the sake of Scylios… for the sake of everyone…”
He finally lets go, and I feel uneasy. I feel as if I had just performed a very intimate and taboo act with the man. My chin quivered and my legs trembled like that of a scared child, I nodded. He was right. Even though I’d rather smother whatever was in that crib, and silence it forever, he was right. We were all lost, and damned men, everyone in this building was chasing after a faint hope, but when all you have when you’re writhing in a lake of fire in the pits of hell, and all you have is but a faint spider web string up to heaven, what else are you supposed to do but grasp at it? Even though you know you it wont hold your weight, even though there are thousands of damned souls behind you stretching and clawing at their chance to climb, even though you know you’re just going to plummet straight back into an eternity of torment, what other option do you have… but to climb? 
“If it truly is… power, if it truly is something that can help our people, you know we will prioritize it over you, right Katyosha?” 
Kat looked uneasy, but he nodded
“I understand that, I just… I just want the best for everyone.” 
I put a hand on his shoulder, trying to bring back that camaraderie that I felt yesterday, and I gently shook him.
“I believe you, Kat. Let’s just… take this one step at a time. We don’t know what it is, so… let’s just keep going as we were.”
His warm dimpled smile returned, and he nodded.
“I… I’d like that a lot…” 
He held out his hand, and I grabbed it, in a moment of solidarity. The rest of our squad was slowly waking up. Rations were being nibbled upon, and coffee brewed over the grills of the fire. The day was young, the sun was driving the night time prowlers away. We readied our guns, and maintained our blades against whetstone, sharpening them to a razor sharp edge that could slash the molecules in the air. Once preparations were complete, the large gang of despots and hopefuls set out from the lodge, and we began our journey to the southeast. Katyosha led the group, naturally, while Khor followed behind. Colonel Rutger and I stayed in the middle, and Newman was covering our rear. Our footsteps were painfully slow, and we all watched our steps. Just because the sun was out, didn’t mean that creatures still didn’t stalk in the treeline. All that could be heard was the crunching of leaves and sticks underneath our boots, and the wind running through the trees. Everyone kept an eye out, everyone watched where their foot went, and where it was going to end up. Kat himself held something in his hands, a handful of bolts with white cloth tied around it. Occasionally he would stop us, and toss a bolt, and watch it intensely. He watched to see if the bolt had flown straight and true. If the bolt deviated even the slightest, if the cloth didn’t fall straight down, if the bolt rusted in mid air or started to disintegrate, he would turn, and toss another. Kleinsville was all types of unforgiving, but anomalies were by far the most dangerous killers… barely visible pockets of air that could fry you, liquify your insides, cause instant heart attacks… nothing fun.
Hunter’s Respite slowly faded in the distance as we continued. Toss, wait, step forward, rinse and repeat until all of our knees locked up from having to control every single muscle in our body. It was as if we were in a deadly dance, a rapport, a devilish tango where the prize was eternal wealth, and the punishment was death. Kat held his hand up, his chest rising and falling faster. I could hear Newman in the back sheepishly ask.
“What… What is it, Kat?”
Kat shot back, his tone was short and serious
“Shut up…” 
There was silence, and then he craned his neck around, looking in every direction. He stretched his neck, and pulled his cotton shirt.
“Does anyone else feel warm?”
Now that Kat mentioned it, there was a thin film of sweat forming on my forehead. It wasn’t cold out, but it wasn’t exactly blazing hot either, and yet… I was feeling warm. Colonel Rutger put his arms around his shoulders, and shivered.
“No… I’m actually pretty cold right now. It’s weird…” 
Kat turned backwards, and pushed past Khor and I with abandon. He was concerned, concerned about what? He ripped his glove off and pressed his pale hand against Colonel Rutger’s forehead. Rutger tried to pull away, not expecting the seemingly random gesture, but Kat reached behind Rutger’s head, and grabbed him by the back of the neck, forcing him to stay put with a chilling expletive.
“FUCKING stay still, STAY STILL kid!”
His hand pressed hard against Rutger’s forehead, and then he turned it, feeling it with the back of his hand, and finally he pulled away. Rutger didn’t even look mad, he just looked vaguely confused.
	“Wha… What are you doing old man!?” 
“You’re burning up… you have a fever… I have one too!” 
We all began to simultaneously wipe our brows, feel our own forehead, we were all burning up, as if we were diseased, but… it was the strangest thing. I felt no fatigue from the flu, nor did my throat hurt. I didn’t cough, nor did I sniffle… and yet my body felt like a furnace, and more worryingly, that furnace heat was slowly giving way to a frightening chill, my teeth beginning to chatter against my own volition. Newman, who looked less green than usual, groaned wearily. 
“What the hell is happening to us..?” 
Newman voiced his concerns. Khor, who also was perspiring at an alarming rate, ordered us.
“We need to move. Now.” 
Kat was the first to adhere to this order, he was speedwalking now, when that wasn’t working, he began to break into a full on sprint, bobbing and weaving. Damned if we do, damned if we don’t… Either we rush headfirst into something far more quick and painful, or we stay here and cook from the inside out! Our legs moved at frantic speeds, all trying not to lose sight of one another. Every once in a while, we shouted out for one another, just to make sure we didn’t break the invisible chain. I hear a loud thump behind me, louder than a trip… I turn to see Rutger on the dirt, teeth chattering, entire body practically convulsing. Newman halted in his tracks, he too was suffering from the horrific shaking. Khor and Kat weren’t far behind, we all had to stop for Rutger. A pit opened up in my stomach, after everything we’ve been through, my friend was going to die of a fever!? I do what I can, and shuffle over. Newman and tried our best to pick Rutger up, who was mumbling half conscious dribble about leaving him behind. Kat, who was a new shade of red I had never seen on a paleskin, uncorked his water skin, and began to pour copious amounts of cool water on top of Rutger’s head, trying to bring the fever down. We were all delirious, trying to wake Rutger up, trying to listen to our own bodies to see if we were still in that anomaly… Khor cut through the panic, and pushed us all aside. He grabbed Rutger, and hoisted him over his shoulder.
“Pick yourselves up, and GO!” 
He demanded, and just like that, the panic melted away from our body. Our loyal general had given us an order, and we must follow and complete it. Kat, who kept up pace with all of us, spoke through laborious breaths.
 “Foxglove…” he wheezed “His camp… is nearby…” 
Kat pointed towards a clearing in the tree line, where we could see white smoke rising up in the distance, not even a mile away. 
“Dig in, and FOCUS, Men! Not too much longer!” 
Khor once again steeled every single one of us who were conscious enough to hear it, the world had turned into such a blur, my entire body ached, demanding that I lay down, and slip into a murky haze, but Khor’s words were my life preservers keeping me afloat when the collapse was trying to drag me deep within its bowels. I huff and puff, legs pushing against twigs and mud, just barely able to dodge spatial anomalies, and finally after so much effort, we were at the camp. I tripped over myself as I landed on the ground, my body rolling on the cool cool ground. My cheek nestled nicely in the cool dirt, I could faintly hear my name being shouted, but by whom? I didn’t know. I had no more fight left in me, just the seductive pull of the fever dragging me down. The last thing I saw was a campfire, burning with yellow flames, and a tent. An elf much like Kat opened the flap, and just like that, my vision had faded. 
Despite the fever, my mind was dark. I had no dreams, simply just a void that held nothing other than the comfort of not being in my own body as it cooked itself. Unfortunately, my brief respite was interrupted. I groaned as my entire body ached from exertion. I felt something cold and metal touch my teeth as I tried to open my eyes. A face I had never seen before was pouring water in my mouth. I drink it greedily, grabbing the container that gave me the water of life. I felt the cool breeze against my bare chest, fresh scars still visible with our skirmishes with both bandits and the collapse… Someone had stripped me straight down to my underwear. My dreamy glassy eyes scan the camp, Rutger and Newman were in similar positions, perched up against trees just as I was, clothes neatly folded on the ground. There was a smell of something cooking, something savory… meat… I looked into the eyes of my caretaker and spoke dryly.
“Foxglove..?” 
The man nodded, his eyes were hidden with glassy goggles, and he wore a getup similar to Kat’s. He spoke, his voice was deep and gravely. 
“Yeah. Take it slow. We got your fever down. You’re all going to be fine.” 
Rutger, who was finally waking up, asked the salient question.
“W-What in the hells happened to us..?” 
Foxglove turned to Rutger to administer a dose of cooling water, explaining.
“I’ve been calling them hotspots. Completely invisible to the naked eye…” 
He spoke very professionally, and confidently, much like Kat did, though he lacked his jovialness. His face was deadpan, featureless, he was… rather unremarkable in that regard
“I don’t have to tell you what they do, but it’s the first time I’ve seen them this far south… It wasn’t there when I first came through, so they must move.” 
I move my hands to rub my face, very slowly. The grogginess was leaving me now, as was the fatigue. I looked over to what was cooking. It was a huge pot over the fire. Kat was dunking a metal spoon in it and tasting the contents. Foxglove must have seen me eying it, because he spoke of it. 
“You guys just lost a lot of energy in that field… Almost burned your damned selves out. You need to rest, and you need to eat. Pork and beans.” 
Heavy footsteps shook the ground behind Foxglove, and I could see the silhouette of my beloved General. Foxglove nodded, and took his leave. Khor kneeled down. He too was stripped of most of his armor, only wearing a cotton shirt and underpants. He pulled me into a deep hug, his arms wrapping around me tightly, like a father would hug a child. He patted me on the back, and he spoke, his voice dripping with concern.
“My son, are you okay?” 
He asked, pulling back and placing his strong calloused hands on my shoulder, squeezing, almost massaging my shoulders.
“Sir… I am a soldier of the greatest General known to man. It will take more than a fever to take me down.”
I say with a wry smile, laughing and coughing as I return his physical touch, my hand grazing his forearm. His grizzled serious expression breaks, and he erupts in a hearty laughter, not only laughing at my defiance, but overjoyed that I was feeling well enough to joke around. He pulls me into another tight hug, and turns, his heels grinding into the dirt.
“Once you feel nice and cool, get dressed, get your gear, and eat up, alright? We’re close to the cave… and we’re burning daylight.” 
I give a salute as he grabs my clothes, and hands it to me. I slide back into my uniform, and do a once over of my gear. My trusty shotgun, my back of medical supplies, food, and water… everything I needed. I hear similar laughs of camaraderie (I stopped here)

I have a modest budget for one of these machines - around £400, but I have seen the Delonghi Eletta Cappuccino is down to £398. I like the choice of drinks and the additional settings it has, such as the choice of milk froth. But I am a bit concerned it's an older model. Any advice on how this compares to newer devices, whether it still stands up in 2025, and any other devices you would consider?

1p96ptp,https://www.reddit.com/r/stuffyouneeddaily/comments/1p96ptp/how_to_clean_upright_vacuum_filters_properly/,How to clean upright vacuum filters properly?,"Look, I'll be honest with you – I ignored cleaning my upright vacuum filter for way too long. My vacuum started smelling weird, wasn't picking up dirt like it used to, and I kept thinking I needed to buy a new one. Turns out, I just needed to spend 10 minutes cleaning the filter. So let me save you from making the same mistake.

**Why This Actually Matters**

Your upright vacuum filter is basically the lungs of your machine. When it gets clogged with dust, pet hair, and all that gross stuff, your vacuum can't breathe properly. This means weaker suction, overheating, and you're basically just pushing dirt around instead of picking it up.

**The Simple Cleaning Process**

First things first – unplug your vacuum. I know it sounds obvious, but safety first.

Most upright vacuums have filters you can remove pretty easily. Check your manual if you're not sure where yours is located. Usually, there's a release button or you just pop off a cover.

Once you've got the filter out, take it outside or over a trash can and give it a good tap to knock loose the big chunks of debris. You'd be surprised how much stuff falls out.

For foam and felt filters, you can wash them with warm water. No soap needed – just rinse until the water runs clear. For HEPA filters, check if yours is washable first. Some are, some aren't. If you can't wash it, just tap it out really well or use compressed air.

Here's the important part everyone messes up: **let it dry completely**. I'm talking 24 hours minimum. Putting a damp filter back in your vacuum is asking for mold and that musty smell nobody wants.

**How Often Should You Do This?**

I clean mine every month now, but if you have pets or vacuum a lot, do it every two weeks. If your vacuum starts losing suction or smells funky, that's your filter crying for help.

Some filters need replacing eventually no matter how well you clean them. If yours is falling apart or still looks nasty after cleaning, it's time for a new one. If you're also dealing with an older vacuum that's seen better days, you might want to check out some newer options at [upright vacuum cleaners on Amazon](https://goodhomedeals.com/upright-vacuum) – they've got pretty good deals and the newer models have way better filtration systems.

**Quick Tips That Actually Help**

Empty your dust cup or bag regularly. The fuller it gets, the harder your filter has to work.

Don't vacuum up wet stuff with a regular vacuum. That's a one-way ticket to filter destruction.

Keep a spare filter on hand if you can. That way when you wash one, you can pop the backup in and keep vacuuming.

**Bottom Line**

Cleaning your vacuum filter isn't exciting, but it takes less time than brewing coffee and makes a huge difference. Your vacuum will work better, last longer, and your house will actually get clean instead of just redistributing dust.

I went from thinking I needed to drop $200 on a new vacuum to realizing mine worked perfectly fine – it just needed some basic maintenance. If your vacuum is truly on its last legs though, there are some solid replacement options you can browse through [here](https://goodhomedeals.com/upright-vacuum).

Trust me, your future self will thank you for taking care of this simple maintenance task. Plus, you'll save money not having to replace your vacuum every couple years.",1,1764365450.0,stuffyouneeddaily,0,1.0,False

I had just graduated university with a bachelor’s degree in botany, was living on a permaculture farm, and had a research lab job of working in wine vineyards in the morning, and in the laboratory in the hot afternoons. It was six weeks of feeling as if I had secured my perfect “last summer,” the last summer before the season’s freedom no longer applied to the adult.

I had a half day at work on July 10th, 2013 and was riding my bicycle to the lab after stopping to buy a light lunch and some coffee which I picnicked with in a park along the way. That is the last memory of my physical self that July, but I would learn about a month later that I had ridden up to the highway intersection and entered without seeing a car making a yellow light. The left side of my body can feel the impact of the Honda civic traveling 45 mph, but fortunately I have no memory of the collision or my body cart wheeling over his vehicle.

*Now lets imagine we are at the camp fire, the sound of wood spitting sparks, hot beverages steaming in our hands and onto our cold cheeks; blankets and sleeping bags wrapped around us, the insecurity of being somewhere new, inescapably vast, and dark; dark as any night we’ve known.*

What I recall after my picnic in the park was being in a forest with a group of strangers. I knew by the looks on their faces that they were anxious and uncertain about where they were headed. Although they carried little, it was clear to me that they were looking for where to rest, where to call home. It wasn’t long before the sound came. A sound that only a predator could make, and a sound that told all of us it was coming this way. I saw terror in the eyes of those around me and did not think before I began to run.

I ran and I yelled out to the creature to follow, likely profanities between shaken breaths. Bushes cut into my body as I ran and fallen trees in the sparse canopy forest caused my stride to be broken. I could hear the sound of its footsteps gaining, pounding in rhythm with the beat of my heart. Then I saw it, a white barked tree standing like a pillar of hope, with a protruding branch that looked strong enough to hold me. I had no time to decide, I was already leaping for it before my momentum was broken. I was out onto the branch before I looked down into the thickets.

There, emerging easily from the brush, was a large grey bear staring up at me, likely seeing the fear in my eyes that I saw in the people I had left. Then it began to walk towards the tree, and then up, climbing without pause, moving out onto the branch. The limb quickly became too narrow to hold me as I backed onto it. Then the tree was toppling under our weight, falling towards the branch the bear and I clung onto. As the tree fell, a circular hole, like a well, opened in the ground beneath us, large enough for the branch and us to enter. The bear landed on top of me, my back already pressed in the cold wet soil. There was no hesitation in the bear as it quickly began to tear into me and to devour my organs. There is a hot flash of memory, of the pain, of deep tissue being cut, of bones snapping, of organs going “pop.”

Soon my consciousness had left my body, drifting below the scene, beneath the bottom of the well. The bear continued to eat, my body eaten, all shrinking in perspective into a tiny dot of light above what remained of me. Then it was no longer, and the observer that was left had nothing left to observe, no light, no temperature, no sound or smell or touch. There weren’t memories to recall or futures to anticipate. There was no-thing if there was anything. This void was experienced for an unknown amount of time, it could have been a moment that stretched a millennium. And then after that indefinite moment, there was something again.

That something came in the form of a pinprick of light, a stimulus, and soon the observer was moving fast towards it. The pinprick expanded into a room, and suddenly that is where the observer found itself; in the south of a large circular stone room, with three visible doors, one to the North, East and West. It wasn’t long before people began to enter the East and West doors. Some were people I knew, like those who visited me in the hospital, others were from across the country who were sending their thoughts via prayers, and some were simply strangers. Some told me stories, others attempted to make me laugh, some came with lessons, but the last two were different from the rest.

One, the image of desire, came through the East door, the other the image of dis-ease, of old age, came through the West door. I now refer to them respectively as Sita and Kali. They each extended a hand as they approached the observer and with surprise, I once again had hands and arms to reach back up to them with. In standing up, there was once again a body to inhabit. In the center of the room the three of us made a concoction, an elixir perhaps. It contained several ingredients I can recall, but the most memorable was the last, my own urine. At first I refused to contribute, but soon my newly found bladder was tickled by forces unknown. Then a cup was poured from a strange glass decanter and we were exiting the North door with it in hand.

Kali Yantra - Oil on Canvas

Down we went, following a spiral staircase that revealed the room sat within a larger tower, eventually exiting into a pitted meadow. There in the center was a large fire, and a dancer making their way around it in a rhythmic pattern. Around this scene were many shrouded figures whose faces changed and shifted with the flickering light, as if there were many more souls sharing these hundred some figures. Then Kali and Sita sat me down to join them, covering my own head with a shroud and handing me the cup. Again, I at first refused to drink, but the look on Kali’s face reminded me of the bear’s, and I quickly began to gulp the oily fluid.

I gagged, and coughed, and felt the fluid expanding in my esophagus, holding it rigidly open. When I reached up instinctively to clear my throat, I felt a tube where my neck should have been, and realized the sound of the crackling fire had been replaced with a repeating hum and the increasing rhythm of a distant beep. I opened my eyes, and I was in the hospital. I had just emerged from a seventeen day coma.

*Then in the silent pause that always follows my telling of this story, I’d look across the fire at you, wild eyed, a large grin filling my flashlight lit smile, and say, “that’s how I came back to life.”*

In future posts, I will explain how I began to understand these experiences as something of an initiation, and what occurred afterwards during one last touch of death in the hospital. I will also write in future posts how I practically overcame the trauma my body and mind experienced, “practically” here meaning, accomplished by practice. This firsthand experience with Death was not my first supernatural, nor would it be my last. It did begin to provide an affirmation to a suspicion about the way the world works; that the internal experience is just as valid as the external. What those around saw as a body lying in coma, was in fact a full reality being experienced. I heard the prayers of others with organs undefined by science, I met with beings I can never point to, but who’s memory is still vivid, and I passed beyond a door, a door that now sits ajar.

*Before I’m done with this post though, I do feel the need to wrap up a few details that occurred while I took my dirt nap.*

Later, I would be told that I had lost my left kidney, my spleen, parts of my left lung; that there were more surgeries to come to repair the shattered lower left leg, and that it wasn’t certain I’d recover from the paralysis on my left side, a result of a stroke. A stroke caused by a punctured lung, a stroke that stole many of my childhood memories, and a stroke that marked the third time my heart had stopped in the first days after my injuries. I would eventually be tickled out of my paralysis by my mother who spent countless hours massaging oil into my scars, or maybe it was my father, who was seemingly by my bedside day and night for months. I would eventually overcome a deep depression, and would eventually be taught how to read, write, speak, and do math again. Not to mention other basics like dressing myself, brushing my teeth, and walking. I would be in the hospital a total of seven weeks, with several more months in wheelchair, walker, crutches, and cane. A period in the hospital that would end just after my 22nd birthday, and end just as school was getting back into session. I still allow myself to grieve for the 21 year old self who never saw their “perfect last summer,” who lost their youth to a broken body, who didn’t get the “see you later” with the college tribe as we went our separate ways, and who never made it to grad school.

1p96oj8,https://i.redd.it/zd6ded3jd24g1.jpeg,First look at my Killzone Gallowdark storage solution,"This is the wall box for Gallowdark. It hold all the pieces except the 30 column caps, they will go in their own box. 

Like Tomb World, you print the Wall Box twice. Unlike Tomb World, I wasn't able to keep the walls in order. This has to do with the doors and rubble at the foot of some walls that make for a thicker area that needs to be cut into the box. Optimal use of space required me to swap some walls around. All walls still fit in one of two orientations, just like in Tomb World, and you can also leave columns together when storing.

  
Three of the dedicated column spaces have cut-outs on the side that you randomly decorate, to allow for storing colums with decorations that stick out more than the other storage allows for. I have added some 3D printed details to my own columns and one hatch has a handle that does not fit in a regular cut-out triangle. This solves that.

  
As Gallowdark was 4 boxes, this won't be completed soon. As always, things will be ready when they are ready (although I may release this one before I have done all 4 boxes, and keep updating it while I work on those extra sprues, just so people with JUST into the dark don't have to wait)

Not bad, not good, just... *meh*. Like you're running on autopilot and the spark is gone. I've been there, and it's exhausting.

I started a personal mission to fight this by 'optimizing' my life. Sounds intense, right? But I'm not talking about a total, stressful overhaul. I'm talking about finding the tiny 1% improvements that stack up into something massive. It's about making small, intentional choices that bring back the color.

Here are a few things that have made a huge difference for me:

**⚡ Let's start with ENERGY:**

*   **Win the first 10 minutes.** Before touching my phone, I drink a full glass of water and do 10 simple stretches by an open window. It sounds ridiculously small, but it completely changes my baseline for the day.
*   **The 'Walk & Talk'.** If I have a call that doesn't require staring at a screen, I take it while walking. Even a 15-minute loop around the block is an easy way to get steps, sunlight, and fresh air without 'making time for a workout'.

**💖 Hacking more JOY:**

*   **'Three Good Things' list.** At the end of the day, I write down three specific good things that happened, no matter how small. ""Enjoyed the taste of my coffee this morning."" ""A stranger held the door for me."" It literally retrains your brain to look for the positive.
*   **Soundtrack your tasks.** I made a high-energy 'Power Hour' playlist for cleaning/deep work and a super-chill 'Wind Down' playlist for the evening. Switching my audio environment is the fastest way to switch my mental state.
*   Sometimes the 'meh' is deeper, and that's totally normal. Managing your emotional state is a skill, and it's okay to need a framework. If you're looking for a structured way to work through things, I've found a lot of value in [this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme).

**🚀 Tiny tweaks for SUCCESS (whatever that means to you):**

*   **The 'Next Day' Rule.** Before I shut down my computer, I write down the ONE most important task for tomorrow and lay out anything I need for it. It kills that morning ""what do I even do now?"" paralysis.
*   **The 2-Minute Rule.** If a task takes less than two minutes, I do it immediately. Answering that email, putting a dish away, tidying one surface. It prevents the build-up of tiny tasks that drain your mental energy.

It's all about small, intentional shifts. Not a revolution, but a daily evolution.

What's one tiny 'optimization' you've made that had a surprisingly big impact on your day? Curious to hear what works for you all.",1,1764365088.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Obviously the goal is to have fun, but that goes without saying.

A bit of a background:

I played micro-stakes for about 6 months and went neutral in like 2016, did a bit of reading, was on one of those 2+2 or whatever forums a bit, had a pokertracker, some basic 'Hey, I might wanna be a poker pro' during/after highschool before realizing I don't enjoy the lifestyle *that* much to gi

Here's some things:

* Ultra fishy table, at least always was years past. Maybe some for-fun 'noob recs' at best, but no one who's actually a serious poker player, maybe someone who has dabbled a little online but not making it at a recreational level.
* People bet based on feeling, instinct, past playstyle etc, not much Poker knowledge going on. You can have blinds be 5/10, and someone donking a 120 on flop, or a limp city happening where most limp into then someone raises... and then all the limps call.

I almost feel like this is a 'know your target audience'. Playing good poker, not that I even can do that, but playing fundamental poker probably seems inefficient here, so what would you guys do?

Right now, here's my strategy/'things I think make sense here' to do: 

* Be a bit of an old-man coffee.
* Since it's one evening + limp city and stakes will get raised fast like every 5-6 rounds most likely, I believe I should get in early on as many pots as I can without committing too heavily, to see if I can get ahead with a good flop before the stakes are raised.
* Top Pair is unstoppable against fishes... right? The only thing is the bet amounts are so random at times it real

I (29f) met this girl (32)three months ago. 

Neither of us are in a position to sustain something serious, as I am working on my masters, work part time, and taking care of my grandfather, and so my remaining free time is distributed to enjoying my down time, working out, cleaning, ect. 

She lives over an hour away, is also going through personal things,as well, and has limited emotional bandwidth for romance. 

I am totally okay with these settings, because it allows more breathing room for the connection to build naturally as two people simply getting to actually know/ understand each other, as friends, before shifting gears. (Plus it sort of gives off a slow burn vibe which is *chefs kiss* ) 

We communicate frequently, but not in a clingly way, every other day or so, send reels, ocasional light flirting. 
We spoke on the phone a couple of times- both times the conversation was great, 2-3 hours of just pure vibes. We met up once as well- ( planned another time but I had to rain check) grabbed coffee, walked around, grabbed more food, then decided to go back to her house for a few hours (kept things pg) so she put her address in my directions in case we got split up during the ride back. 

(Admittedly I did save it to her contact card, then deleted it bc I thought it was weird slash creepy, but now I have it memorized, womp)

Grab a coffee or maybe get comfy with a pillow somewhere.

I've been watching the news and hearing a lot of things I know to be true shockingly being talked about openly by some higher ups in a documentary so I figured what the hell?

You can call me Rhea. Not my real name obviously, but it will do. 

A little about me... I spent about eight years in the military to pay for college and then another decade plus in a part of the US intelligence component that does not officially exist. On paper I worked for a boring sounding office in a department most people have never heard of. In reality it was a compartment inside a compartment where the odd stuff of a certain nature got routed.

My actual specialty is electro-optics. Lasers, sensors, EO imaging systems, the math and hardware behind how we detect things at a distance and, in some cases, put energy on them. That is what I trained in, what I did most of my serious work on once I was off the deployment treadmill. So when I say I know something about directed energy weapons and weird sensor returns, that's not ""I heard this from a friend of a friend"". That was my day job. Most of my career was boring in the way dangerous jobs are boring. Long days in windowless rooms. Iraq and Afghanistan in the early years, doing the usual mix of SIGINT and HUMINT support. Phone records, pattern-of-life workups, building target packets on people who’d never know my name but might notice a drone overhead later. After I got out of uniform I slid over to contractor work, then got pulled into the permanent government side.

For a long time my world was very normal: counterterrorism, sanctions evasion, shady cargo going through weird ports, stuff like that. After that, foreign missile tests and what you have probably seen described publicly as space domain awareness. Basically, watching dots move around the sky and trying to decide whose dots they were and what they were doing.

The weird part started when I was detailed to a small interagency working group looking at what was called ""anomalous aerospace and undersea systems"". Translation: things detected and showing up on sensors that did not match any known platform, did not behave like clutter, and did not go away when you changed radar modes or swapped optical systems. I was there because I understood both sides of the equation: the physics of the sensors and the intelligence context. You get taught very quickly to treat anything unexplained as a glitch, a calibration issue, operator error, software artifacts, anything that keeps your world tidy. You get used to hearing “weird glitch” as a catch-all. Except after a while you notice some of those “glitches” kept showing up, across different systems, different countries, decades apart. Same behaviors. Same basic locations. Same signature that never quite fits. At some point you either admit there is a real pattern or you drive yourself crazy trying not to see it. If you are useful and you start asking the wrong questions for long enough, someone eventually pulls you aside, takes you to a SCIF, takes your phone, has you sign your life away again, and shows you the next layer of the onion. 

This onion goes so deep I doubt that even after years of briefings I've been exposed to anything below a few layers. Even still most of this is purposely kept off NIPR and JWICS and is done in person.

That is where I learned about most of what you're interested in here and what seems to be bubbling to the surface in the news lately. That when I learned about what we call The Council. Yes aliens, and I suspect you're not likely to see a lot of what I know mentioned even by some who know it who have begun speaking out for reasons I'll get into later. 

I've never met them face to face. Everything I know about them is from briefings, documents, and one secure video session that I honestly wish I had skipped. But it lines up with too many independent data points to just shrug off as somebody’s pet theory.

The basic story is this. Earth was noticed roughly 2 billion years ago, long before anything walked around on land. Not because we’re special, but because we tripped a sensor. Or rather life tripped their sensors. You see, The Council is not a single species. It is a collective of several advanced interstellar maybe even interdimensional civilizations that run long term surveys of stars and planets the way we run spy satellites. Huge distributed arrays of instruments, working together, watching thousands of star systems at once, for millions of years at a time. Their gear probably makes the James Webb telescope look like a kid's backyard telescope.

About 2 billion years ago those instruments picked up biosignatures here, chemical fingerprints in the atmosphere that meant something was alive here. Atmospheric composition like free oxygen and methane, spectral fingerprints, chemical disequilibria that scream “there’s metabolism happening down there!"" you know, the basics. At that point Earth went into a database as “interesting, revisit later”.

Standard procedure for them when a world looks promising is pretty boring from their point of view. They send automated probes. Not big crewed ships like you see in sci-fi movies, just small, tough, very smart machines. Those probes come in, mostly target the oceans, and set up self replicating facilities on the seafloor. Those facilities use local materials to build more facilities, more probes, craft that can operate underwater, in the air, in near space, and eventually avatars that can interact with whatever life evolves. These biological or rather, biomechanical avatars are what some people who claim to have been abducted have likely experienced.  Though they do have what we would call ASI, these beings are not gods, they are technology and they aren't perfect, they make mistakes, glitch out, etc. 

The reason they base all of that underwater for a simple reason. The bottom of an ocean does not care about ice ages, political empires, climate swings or wars. Temperatures and pressures change slowly over what long periods of time. Its a fairly stable environment and for much of human history has been mostly inacessible. Speaking of time, we Earth humans tend to think in terms of nothing longer than the current human lifespan. And when pondering non-human intelligence we like to think in terms of deep space, distance and light years but we seldom consider the lifespan and concept of time for a post-biological species could be quite different than outs. Only our most astute thinkers in the realms of geology, palentology and cosmology think in terms of millions or billions of years. Geologic epochs, cosmological history. That is childsplay for The Council which has a different concept of time, more concerned with deep time, millions of years at a stretch. As such their infrastructure is designed for that. 

So yes, a lot of the TMOs (transmedium objects) and impossible accelerations you have heard about are just their hardware doing its job. Maintenance, observation, sampling. Nothing heroic. The warp bubble/Alcubierre effect was probably mastered by them before our solar system even existed. It's old tech for them. Kinda like the wheel is for us. Also, no, we are not the center of anyone’s universe. There are about a billion planets in our galaxy that are more or less like Earth. Some just have microbes. Some have more complex life. A smaller subset of those have or once had civilizations. We are just one more entry, a fairly recent one in cosmological terms, in a very large survey.

Once early humans started doing interesting things, we moved from “planet with life” to “planet with potential”. They have watched this same story unfold in slightly different ways around a thousand times from what I understand. Chemistry leads to biology, biology creates technology. Tool use, language, agriculture, cities, industry, energy, space travel. Somewhere in there you always hit the same fork. Either the species figures out how not to blow itself to pieces with the energy densities it increasingly has access to such as nuclear fission, nuclear fusion, anti-matter and more exotic matter/energy, or it wipes itself out.

Our situation worried them. We are a little paradox: extremely good at cooperation and also extremely good at organized violence. Our aggression stood out. Cooperation plus violence isn’t unique, but we’re very, very good at both. And once you get to things like nuclear power, that combo tends to end very badly. They'd seen plenty of variations of that play out over at least a few billion years.

About 10,000 years ago our trajectory towards that became clear and there was a major argument inside the Council about what, if anything, to do with us. One side said the odds favored self destruction once we discovered and weaponized atomic level technologies. The other side argued we were worth saving or at least worth understanding better. The compromise was an experiment. One which has ramifications as to why all of this has been hidden for so long.

Roughly 65,000 humans were removed from Earth and relocated to what is basically a preserve on a planet around the star you know as 82 Eridani. Internally we called those people Erids. That star is in our catalogs if you feel like looking it up, but the details of the target planet are not public for obvious reasons.

The Erids were started in a kind of controlled paradise. Their world has large dispenser systems that can produce whatever basic material needs they have. Food, clothing, tools, building materials, entire strucures for habitation. Think Star Trek replicators scaled up and wired into the environment. In that setup nobody starves, nobody is homeless in the way we understand it, nobody spends their life chasing money just to meet needs. This was just the Erids natural reality.

The point from The Council's view was to remove material scarcity from the equation and see what humans do and achieve when they are not spending most of their energy bashing each other over the head over resources. Meanwhile, the rest of us stayed here on the control planet, dealing with scarcity, ownership, money, hoarding, and the rise of socio-political systems based on scarcity: all of the things that define Earth civilization.

The result, according to what we were briefed, is that the Erids are now around 5,000 years ahead of us technologically, averaged out. Same species, same basic biology, same starting point, completely different trajectory because of conditions. Nature vs nurture on a cosmic scale. For most of their history they Erids thought they were native to that world. They only found out the truth roughly a century ago in our time. They learned that they were uplifted, that their ancestors were taken from Earth, that they have cousins here.

Once they knew that, some of them started coming back to visit the original branch. This is where their history intersects the some of the UFO stories you know. The “aliens” that look almost exactly human are just that. Human. They are not hybrids, not clones, not secretly angels or demons. They are Erids, born around another star, showing up here after being given a 10,000 year head start. They have in some cases met with leaders of certain countries and at least two U.N. Secretary Generals (both deceased).

Now we get to why this has been buried for 80 some years.

You have to think like a senior US official in the 1940s and 1950s. World War II has just ended, the Cold War is starting, everything is viewed through capitalism versus communism. Then someone puts a briefing in front of you that says, in essence, there is a group of humans living on another world who have no money, no private ownership in the way we structure it, automatic systems that meet their basic needs, and in that environment they advanced thousands of years faster than we have. The men who built what we now call the legacy program in the US that sounded less like “interesting anthropological data” and more like “a walking, talking advertisement for space communism.” It looked like proof that communism works better than the system they were trying to defend. That and the ramifications of what could happen if THAT ever got out terrified them more than the existence of aliens did, though to be fair they plenty had their worldview rocked by the latter too.

So the core of the cover up has never just been “aliens” or even their technologies. It has been the systemic implications. The idea that scarcity and ownership are not hard coded into reality, that they are one possible way to run a society, and maybe not the optimal one. That was seen as an existential political threat in the 1940s and 1950s and some of the people who grew up in that mindset are still steering parts of the program today. 

Now add in the famous crash-retrieval incidents. Roswell '47, Kecksburg '65, a handful of other retrievals around the U.S. and around the world. What we were told is that most of those were not accidents. They were tests and gifts. The Council, with Erid input, allowed certain craft and systems to fall into human hands in a controlled way. Enough intact technology that a very motivated and capable society could learn from it, not enough that it would instantly rewrite everything.

 In fact the Kecksburg landing, it wasn't called a crash internally, was a direct result of a meeting and gift agreement made at Holloman AFB the year prior. The idea was to see who did what with it. Who could figure it out, who kept it secret, who tried to share, who tried to weaponize it, who panicked. Based on those results, the plan was to pick one primary human partner to act as the main interface for full Council contact and to begin a managed process of reunifying Earth humans with the Erids and introducing us to the wider community.

You can argue whether that is a good way to do it. I am just telling you that is the framework I saw laid out.

In the 1980s-90s during a brief period when the Cold War ended there was a push to finally disclose much of this. This was initially proposed at meeting between then U.S. President Ronald Reagan and then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at a summit in Reykjavik, Iceland in 1986. Also discussed was getting rid of nuclear weapons as had been urged by The Council. In the end it was decided to wait. There were two more U.S. pushes for disclosure between then and the 2017 New York Times article. One during the Clinton administration and another during the transition between the Obama and first Trump presidency.

Now for the part that put a clock on all of this stuff you've been hearing about 2027 etc....

About three years ago, a species that is hostile to the Council found out about the Earth project. They are not part of the collective. They resent the way the Council handles in younger civilizations as they themselves felt victimized by the Council. They also resent the credit the Council gets for “successful” cases. I have heard them described as the jealous neighbors who would rather break your toys than watch you win. 

Yes, we sometimes joke about this stuff because again, it's the only way to stay sane with this everyday knowledge and integrate it into your civilian life of thanksgiving dinner, xmas shopping, taking the kids to soccer practice etc.  Just as an aside, ever consider how two of the biggest holidays of they year involve gluttony (Thanksgiving) and overconsumption (Black Friday)? When you have the knowledge many have within the program stuff that is taken for granted seems really weird and a symptom of the now, forced scarcity of our current system.

Anyway back to the aliens... The hostile group I mentioned decided to spoil the experiment.

This species is ahead of us technologically but far behind the Council. Though they also inhabit a relatively nearby star cosmologically speaking, their travel is slower, less elegant and has to take place in stages, think of it as space ""island hopping"" which is why the lead time is so long. You probably want to know what they look like. Physically, based on the descriptions we saw, they are about five feet tall, segmented bodies, multiple limbs, basically ant like in overall form. Nothing subtle or humanoid about them.

They launched an expedition toward Earth with the stated goal of making a mess. Cause chaos here, damage the experiment, and embarrass the Council by showing they cannot protect their own projects due to internal disagreements. Basically exploiting internal fissures, turning small cracks of understanding in The Council into canyons, thus destroying it. That's their hope at least. The transit time means for us they are expected to arrive in roughly two years from now, the 2027 holiday present NO ONE asked for.

That news triggered a major debate within the Council. One group said, the rules say non interference, we watch and record what happens, even if it is ugly, as we had done in the past. The other group said, we effectively created this situation by tagging and monitoring this world, we have a moral obligation not to just watch a civilization we have been studying get smashed by somebody else’s grudge. If the Council showed up in force it would not be much of a fight. Their technology relative to the ant species is like a modern carrier group versus skilled archers on sailboats. The whole thing would be over quickly and it would also completely blow the point of letting a young species find its own way. It would also be a tremendous blow to the human ego which The Council is well aware of.

So they arrived at a compromise. No direct Council fleets defending Earth. No obvious intervention. Instead, they would quietly arm us.

What they chose to give us are things they roughly call scalar phase weapons. Our vocabulary is not great here. They are not just high power lasers. They interact with fields we do not fully understand or really have names for yet, shift phases, dump huge amounts of energy from the vacuum into very specific volumes of spacetime without a conventional bright beam or explosion. Compared to our current directed energy weapons, they are an enormous leap. As someone who spent years working with lasers and optics systems, I can tell you they sit so far off our current tech tree that if you saw the damage assessments from a pulse without context you would think they were misprints. But compared to Council weapons, they are nerf guns, training wheels per-se.

Anyway, that decision set off another big argument, both among them and among us. The obvious concern was simple. Once the external threat is gone, what stops us from turning these things on each other the same way we took nuclear power and turned it into thousands of warheads aimed at our own cities?

On the US side there were people saying exactly that. And some members of The Council argued that if we on Earth roll out scalar systems across arsenals, the first real test after the bugs are gone will likely be some crisis where two human governments start lighting each other up with technology they we do not fully understand.

The counter argument, which won, was that species level survival has to come first. If humanity gets wiped out by someone else’s petty feud, then the entire debate is academic. Also, if humans fight this off themselves instead of watching the Council show up and save the day, they will meet the wider community as people who actually did something, not as rescued primitives. Human ego intact. And kill switch if you will, has been built into the tech to disable it after the conflict which The Council sees us winning. If we then decide to use these weapons against each other they'll simply be disabled until we humans have learned enough to disable the kill-switch which could be thousands of years from now for all I know.

So against a lot of internal resistance, the Council has been quietly providing scalar phase systems to several blocs, not just the US. The list I saw included the United States, China, the European Union through specific channels, Russia, and Brazil. Those systems are being integrated into space platforms, aircraft, and undersea assets. Testing is happening in remote places and high altitudes, often disguised as other things. Most of the people physically working on it think it is an advanced homegrown black program. Only a very small circle in each capital sees the full context. I got to see pieces of that picture shortly before I was pushed into “retirement”, which is a polite way of saying I stopped being convenient. That is as specific as I am willing to get.

There is one more reason I am writing this now, after pondering it for a long time, and it is more personal than the two year clock.

A friend of mine, someone I worked closely with inside the program, another EO specialist, had been talking quietly years ago about going to Congress. Not with everything, they were not suicidal. Just enough to force a real closed door hearing in the Senate, get the true nature of certain SAPs acknowledged on paper, make it harder to bury the whole subject under jokes and career threats.

Over as year ago I got word that they died. The official explanation has been vague and unsatisfying. “Medical complications” on a trip to a black site in the Indian Ocean. Those medical complications do not match what I know about their health, then it became ""an accident at home” with no details anyone will put in writing. People who would normally be candid went very quiet very fast. Maybe it was just bad luck. People do die suddenly. But given the threats which are known about within certain IC sectors when one is associated with this subject, I don't know for sure. What I do know is that the last long conversation I had with them was about whether it was worth trying to talk to certain congressional staffers for a certain Senator.

After hearing recent news confirming publicly much of what I know to be true privately I stopped telling myself I would wait and see how things played out. Life is short.

So here we are. Some stranger on the internet telling you an unbelievable story you are free not to believe.

With roughly two years on the clock and the current rate of leaks and “whistleblowers” and half disclosures, it is very unlikely they keep all of this under wraps until the first time something openly not from here appears in our sky or our orbit. At some point before that happens, at least one major government, maybe more, is going to go public in a controlled way. My guess would be China or the US, but it could be one of the others on that scalar weapon list. You will likely get a very carefully worded announcement about unidentified aerial phenomena, about contact with “non human intelligences”, about new defensive technologies and unprecedented international cooperation. It will be designed to manage panic and control the story.

What you probably will not hear in the first round of briefings is the part about the Erids, the economic implications of their society's existence, the billion other habitable planets, the undersea infrastructure that has been here longer than we have had bones. You will not see anyone step up to a podium and say “oh by the way, there is a branch of humanity that grew up without the idea of money and scarcity ten thousand years ago and advanced five millennia past us”.

That is why I am dumping this here, where people can ignore it, laugh at it, or save it and see how it ages.

Like I said, do not have to believe me. I'm not here to sell a book, go on podcasts, be on Tv or do UFO lectures/ Treat this as fiction if that makes you more comfortable. What I am really trying to do is get you to think past the kiddie pool questions. “Are UFOs real” ""Are the NHI good or evil?"" is not the interesting part. The far more interesting questions are what happens to this planet once everyone knows we are being watched, that we have cousins around another star, that some of the basic assumptions we built our societies around were just one option, not a fundamental law of nature.

If in a year or two you start hearing officials talk about “our cousins among the stars” or “civilizations far older than ours” and “new non kinetic systems” and “shared planetary defense”, remember this post and see how well it fits. Look, the bugs are coming either way. The Council is not going to save us directly. They already handed out the tools and they are watching to see what we do with them.

The part that is still up to us is what kind of world we build if we get through it. Will we all go back to work and beat each other over the head with really advanced sticks or do we achieve a more enlightened potential?

That is all I have.

Hi, this is my first post on Reddit. I finally made an account after reading and listening stories FOREVER.

This is a long one so please bear with me. Also, english is not my first language.

So, I (23 F) am in a relationship with a man, nicknamed Snow (23). We met through a mutual friend that we are going to call F (23 F). I knew her for a year by then and he knew her since their last years of high school.

I took her with me to a ski trip bc it was my first time going to the mountains. I was going with my brother and she told me her best friends were working at this ski station and they could make it easier and cheaper for us.

Note that I’m veryyy shy and introverted. I am extremely silent with people that I don’t know, more like it’s really hard for me to just open up to people right off the bat. Even though my close friend is their best friend. That's why I was relieved to have her with me. And I loved her, she was one of my besties.

So we went to the ski trip and immediately when I saw one of her friend, I liked him. couldn’t keep my eyes off of him. And I thought it was the same for him as I was always catching him staring too or he would catch me staring.

honestly, as a black african women, I was on my guard bc we just never know.

I heard the first day that he had a girlfriend so I retreated, try not to look too much at him and make it awkward. I aspire to be THE girl’s girl so I immediately stopped myself from looking « flirty » or exhibiting any sign of interest.

Important: HE initiated closeness with me. We stayed 3 days. First evening , we went to the ice skating rink. There, i was struggling. I was a little tipsy and it was also my first time ice skating. I couldn’t even stand. So I was alone on the ice trying to make it work for myself when out of nowhere he came and offered me his hand to help me and make two/ three rounds on the ice. I thought it was very nice as I felt left out by the group. My brother is a fast learner and pretty sociable so after 5 min he got the hang of it and was talking with everybody. And F was seeing her best friends after idk how long so I let her have her moment of joy with them.

Just for y'all understanding, when I feel like I can be a burden for others, I tend to isolate and try to be the smallest possible.

Anyway, the rest of the sky trip was pretty nice, we had some word from then and there but nothing flirty at all. I just think we felt the attraction but neither axted on it for obvious reasons.

Fast forward to 2-3 months later, F casually tells me that he broke up with his girlfriend. I did not have a big reaction tbh. In my head,it was just a little crush and that's it.

One night, I invited F to the housewarming party of one of my other friend ( with the approval of the host obviously). And by the end of the party, we were drunk. But not drunk drunk, more like tipsy drunk. We were going home and at the bus station, I told her that I had a crush on him when we went to the ski trip.

She was FLOORED and told me that she did not see a thing on my side but as she knows him better, she could tell that he was looking at me with some kind of interest. Admitting that little crush made me feel good and I felt validated because she saw it too. She talked about it all the time after that. She wanted us to be together so her two friend groups could reunite. She was so cute. I was just thinking that it won't happen but I let her have her delusion.

And what a surprise it was when I received a message from him on my birthday. Especially because, we did not communicate whatsoever after the ski trip. I thanked him and he said that if I organized a party, I should invite him and I said there is no party but I would have sure invited him. From there, we started talking everyday.

So the flirting phase started. In the beginning it was nice and innocent and by a certain time we started giving each other clues on our true feelings.

It was so weird for me because my love history is poor and traumatising. I had a thing with a guy when I was in highschool but I do not consider that as a relationship. First of all, I was a minor when he was not and he asked me for inappropriate photos at the time. When we were finally together it was exclusively through messages because I was still a minor when he was done with university and started working. My parents were strict and I was a teen with not a big social circle (quasi-exclusively female) that my parents knew so I could not find an excuse to go see him. I ended up breaking up with him as I felt weird being with a person I am not seeing and I did not feel anything for him except friendship. Other than that I never had my first kiss. At least not with my consent. And I was touched by boys when I did not consent. Anyway, my previous experiences were not it at all and I kind of hated men too (bc also my realtionship with my father but that's another story)...

Back to the story.

So, we were talking everyday, he said I should come to his city and I said I would love to but I just started an internship so I could not ask for days off for now. But F organized a party at her place, we lived in the same city. And he was invited. So we figured we would see each other there.

During the texting phase, he didn't tell me that he was still living with his ex in the same apartment, and one day she called me on FaceTime using his phone, and I didn't really understand why he didn't say anything when I answered. That evening, he told me it was his friend who wanted to see who he was talking to, but F told me a little while later that he was actually still living with his ex and that she had texted him to tell me because it wasn't right. I asked Snow about it and he said that he would understand if I was mad and apologized. I said I'm not mad (I was not attached to that point), I was just thinking that was weird...

The day of the party where we would finally see each other again, I was a little stressed, I was scared that the connection we had had died since the ski trip. But, after getting ready for the night I was just like ""let's go, what could go wrong"". At the party he was shy at the beginning but by the end we were glued to each other. We went to my appartment and got a little closer.

He stayed with me all week-end and before going back to his place, he asked me ""sooo... Do you want to be my girlfriend?"" and I said yes.

That's how it started between us. On a side, I was floating and on the other, I was freaking out. We alternated visits every 2-3 weeks, sometimes he would come to see me in my city and other times I would go to see him.

Once, she came to spend a long weekend with me, but I found him pensive and quiet. I asked him several times what was wrong, and each time he looked me in the eyes and said nothing was wrong. On the day before the day he was leaving, I was at work when F texted me to say she had something to tell me but didn't know if she should because he didn't want her to tell me. I asked her to tell me anyway, and I found out that he had seen his ex the previous weekend when he had gone to his parents' house. He had called her to come and do her hair because she was his hairdresser. They kissed, and he pushed her away. Without hesitation, when I got home, I asked him what was going on, and he told me the same story, except that he added that he had kissed her back before pushing her away...

I was extremely confused by this story. And when I'm hurt/annoyed or something's wrong, I do something stupid, which is to retreat into silence. That's what I did that night. I was very quiet. As a novice in romantic relationships, I asked all my friends what I should do, and they told me to forgive him and move on. I think I wanted to do that too, so that's what I did.

At the end of my internship, we were 2 months into the relationship and I was going back to my university city to finish my studies and I was texting him that I was struggling finding a cheap moving company and he said he would do it. And by the same time, he would stay there with me.

At that time, he was now living with his parents bc the lease on the apartment he shared with his ex had ended, and they went their separate ways.

I agreed because at that time, we were talking a lot about staying together longer than just the weekends we spent together from time to time. We were craving each other.

So that's what we did and in the beginnign it was so great. We were living on love alone.

After some times, I started noticing some behavior that I thought were suspicious but I convinced myself to brush them off. F also moved with her then boyfriend at the time in the appartment just under mine.

Snow had attentions for F that he did not even think about for me. And when I say attentions I mean that, he would go buy some pastries for us and would buy something for her and come home like ""I bought this for F, I'm going doing to give it to her"" but when it comes to me, he would even forget that I am vegetarian and bring two sandwiches that contains meat. I would say it's okay and that I love that he thought of me, knowing that most of the time I was the one asking him to grab somthing to eat for us. He would eat the two sandwiches as I really despise meat hence why I'm vegetarian.

I feel like I had to ask for anything nice he would do for me like driving me to uni or coming to pick me up but each time he would ask her if she needed a ride.

I figured it's because he knows her better and he's just getting to know me.

One weekend, we went with some of F's friends to another city to spend the weekend, and it was perfect. He was super affectionate with me, so adorable. Except for the fact that he literally said that F's jeans made her butt look good in front of me, and the scene in bed. Basically, we were in F's bed since she was the only one who had a bed with her boyfriend, and the rest of us slept on inflatable beds that weren't very comfortable, which is why we got into her bed while she was smoking outside. She came back and slipped between us. They started talking about stories from their past, and I felt a little out of place in the conversation, so I went to sleep on the air mattress. That was without counting on Snow, who just stayed with her in bed, cuddled up together, talking and looking at old photos under the covers. It was at that moment that I started feeling jealousy.

I wanted the attention that he was offering her without her asking. I don't know how to put it. With her, he saw her as someone to protect, to pamper, almost like a fragile little princess who needed help with everything. With me, it was the opposite: he assumed that I could take care of myself. Not because he understood me, but because he didn't even take the time to wonder if I too needed attention, support, or just someone to take care of me. I just wanted him to care for me more than he cared for his friend.

He told me during our talking stage that his love language was gift giving just like me. I had already gifted him multiple times by then and I was confused as to why he was saying next time it’s my turn with no actions made in that way. I am a big gift giver and I do not expect to receive anything in return. A year on my birthday I chose to gift some of my closest friend instead of buy myself something as the reaction when I offer gift to people is so much more satisfying. That’s why I found it weird that he wasn’t showing me that he liked me with his love language.

I started getting angry at him for no reason and distancing myself from her. I told myself it would pass after a while, but in the end it only got worse. I was horrible to him, giving him the silent treatment without him knowing why, and then coming back once I had calmed down and telling him it was nothing and that when I'm not feeling well, I isolate myself. And I talked to her less and less.

On the one hand, I didn't want to make them feel bad, but on the other, I couldn't be in “F my bestie, I love you so much” mode when I didn't mean it at all. And I did not understood at first that it was jealousy, I was trying to convince myself that it was nothing and that they were normal friends. I had nothing to worry about.

Except that saying nothing didn't help the situation. Meanwhile, I could see them getting closer and closer. When he dropped me off at school, I would say, “Kiss,” and kiss him before getting out of the car. She enjoyed doing the same thing. Once she came to our appartement saying her underwear were all dirty, and he immediately jumped in asking if she wasn't wearing any underwear, and she asked him if he wanted to see, and they laughed as he pretended to go towards her. Another time, they went to the gym together because I didn't feel like going, and he just asked her (without telling me). I only found out the next day when he asked her, as we were all going shopping together, “Weren't you wearing a bra yesterday? Because your breasts were moving around a lot during the exercises,” and she admitted that she wasn't. (We both have the same bra size, and it can't be comfortable exercising without a good supportive bra). Also, usually when we walked together, he walks in front of me, but when we were with her, his pace seemed to match ours and he walked at our speed. Another time, with another friend of mine, I was walking behind him and her, and he was holding her hip, knowing that he has trouble holding my hand when we walk or holding me in any way.

I was going crazy thinking about it and tried as best I could to let it go, convinced that I was overreacting.

At one point, I thought he loved her, so I tried to investigate. One evening when we were drunk, we played a game of Truth or Dare, and there was a question that made him reveal to me that once they were sleeping with their other best friend in the same bed with her in the middle, and he (Snow) had an erotic dream and woke up on top of her. Needless to say, that didn't help me put things into perspective.

Everyone had noticed the change in my behavior towards her in particular, and they asked me what was wrong. I talked about it with two of my other best friends, whom we'll call Nini, a close friend of F and I and Lola, who is my best friend and childhood friend. They agreed that the situation was delicate and advised me to talk about it, but every time I suggested talking to F, I chickened out.

The situation came to an end during a party where the three of us were supposed to go out with Nini. We met at my apartment to have a few drinks before leaving, and when it was time to go, I went to the bathroom to get changed. F asked Snow to accompany her to her place to get changed. Knowing that F, Nini, and I were like three peas in a pod, if she wanted to ask her, she would have done so without any problem... So I came out of the bathroom and saw that they had both gone downstairs, and Nini and I exchanged a knowing look, since I had already told her about it.

It was a weird evening and I couldn't enjoy myself, so I decided to go home and Snow came with me. Once we got home, he pushed me until I told him what was wrong. His first reaction was to be happy that I was jealous.

The next day, I went out for a walk to gather my thoughts. I sat down in a park and received a message from F saying that she didn't understand my behavior and that if I didn't tell her what was going on, our relationship would end there. So I sent her a message saying that I felt disrespected by the fact that they (she and Snow) felt it was okay to continue being so close when him and I started to be in a relationship. I mean, they had literally pinched each other's buttocks the day before as a joke because she had spanked him, saying he had glutes. Anyway, I wrote and rewrote my message and had it approved by Lola, because I didn't want to be accusatory but wanted to make it clear that it was me who felt that way.

F's reaction was immediate and violent. She told me she didn't understand why I was making such a big deal out of it because they were like that when we went to the ski trip and I knew they were close, so she didn't see why I was surprised. She thought it was okay with me. She said that her boyfriend didn't see any problem with it and that if I was insecure about my relationship, I shouldn't project that onto others. (Note: her boyfriend did have a problem with it just never spoke about it until she told him what I texted her. Today, they eurent together anymore for other reasons). She added that if she wanted to be close to her best friend, she would do so. I found her very hurtful and harsh. She was clearly attacking me, even though I had made a point of not attacking her in my message. So I told her that I understood. It's how I feel that caused all this, so I suggested removing myself from the equation because I didn't want to be the girl who asks her boyfriend to be less close to her best friend because she's jealous.

She sent me a message saying she didn't want it to end like this. That she wants us both in her life. And that she never thought a man would separate us.

I told her that I felt hurt by both him and her and that I didn't feel valued, which is why I preferred to cut my losses now.

When I got home, Snow was at her place. He stayed there for almost an hour, and when he finally came home, I had a talk with him. He told me he didn't want us to break up and asked me why I felt that way. We talked a lot, and I was pleasantly surprised that he wasn't immediately defensive and that he tried to understand me. In the end, I was in tears because the confrontation had finally taken place, and I always cry when I have to confront someone.

He let me cry and went downstairs to comfort her because she was also crying when he left her with her boyfriend. He stayed there for quite a while. I was able to call Lola and she reassured me and told me that she had never really felt F since I had been friend with her. She told me that she didn't like that I had apologized so much by text because I always do that and that I wasn't wrong, they should have set some boundaries when he and I got together.

After all this, I stayed with Snow. I already loved him too much, and I'm convinced I should never have been jealous. However, with F, something had broken and couldn't be fixed.

Especially when I found out that she tried to turn another friend of mine against me. Luckily, my friend immediately contacted me, saying that F was painting a picture of me that she didn't recognize and wanted to hear my side of the story.

In short, regardless of this story, you should know that for four months, I was the one who took care of the finances for myself and Snow, because he couldn't find a job. I had to give up all my pleasures (shopping, coffee, and going out) because groceries cost three times as much as I spent on my own, and I hardly eat anything on a daily basis. But apart from the stress that this sometimes caused and the fact that we couldn't go out as much as we wanted to, I was so happy with him that I was in “it doesn't matter” mode. Also, he found a job towards the end of the last few months and quit after a week because the person he was supposed to replace hadn't left the company yet and he had nothing to do all day. But he refused to take a part-time job as a waiter or salesperson because he said he hadn't worked so hard to get his degree just to find work as a salesperson or waiter, and honestly, I understand him.

My friends totally disagreed with this lifestyle, saying that it wasn't fair and that he should contribute; but you have to take into account that it wasn't his fault that he couldn't find a job, and it must have been very embarrassing for him to be supported financially, given that he prides himself on being a traditional guy and refused to let me pay for anything at the beginning of the relationship.

Anyway, school ended and I went back to my intership. He said he really did not like the city where I was doing my internship but I asked him to come with me as we did not want to be separate for too long. Still craving each other a lot. But I gave him the choice, I did not want to force it on him. He thought about it for a long time and after contemplating going back to his parents, he finally decided to come with me. So I found a shared appartement for us. Far enough from the city as he really did not want to be in the center or near, we had our own bedroom, a little kitchnette and our own bathroom too. But the rent was way higher than what I was paying back in the city of my uni. But as he was still looking for a job and there were way more opportunies in that city, I thought he would help me in one month or two, no big deal.

The moving was a sport, we put everything in his little car and made 2 trips. Our plan A fell through the day before the move. It was stressful for the both of us and he kept saying that I was giving him a hard time and make me feel bad about the situation. I told him it wasn't his fault and that I was going through the same thing and that it was difficult for both of us. It really threw me off as I easily feel guilty for everything.

When we arrived at the place, it was filthy and we called the leasing company that sent us someone to clean before we could stay in. After that I cleaned again bc I am a bit of a clean freak. To put our things away, I had to ask to help me unpack the boxes. He told me that he didn't want to do anything that I wouldn't approve of, since I'm a neat freak, and he didn't know what to do.

I was really exhausted at that point. I had started my internship the day after we moved in, and as soon as I got home, I started unpacking boxes again because I couldn't stand sleeping in a messy space for too long. I would have lost my mind. He didn't have a job yet, but he didn't take any initiative to tidy up a little while I was at work during the day.

Also, now that I think about it, I think I was trying to make up for what had happened with his best friend a few months earlier. I was trying to be better for him. I cooked him dinner almost every night, in addition to cleaning the house and doing the laundry.

At the end of the first month he found a job and it seemed to suit him well enough. But since we moved in, he constantly complained about the city. I tried everything I could to improve our living space, to make him happy by cooking things he likes, finding fun activities for the two of us to do to cheer him up and make his experience in this city a good one. My internship only lasted six months, and after that, we could go wherever we wanted.

He was able to help me pay the groceries at the end of that month. But as he had some things to pay that had up these last months when he had no revenue, he had to fill those gaps.

I felt very ill at one point because of a change in birth control pills, and I had to take a day off because I was bedridden with a horrible migraine that had made me vomit on the bus on my way home the day before. That day, he laughed and said, “Stop faking it,” even though I could barely move without feeling pain. He said he was joking. He does the same with racist and sexist comments that he makes ""jokingly"". As a feminist, I do not tolerate that kind of humor it always end into an argument between us.

For Valentine's Day, I booked an Airbnb for us. With a jacuzzi, rose petals, sauna, and all. I was stressed and tired from work and trying to be the best girlfriend possible, and he was too, because of the city and his new job where he had to fit in and everything. So that evening brought us closer together and managed to put things back in order between us.

But apparently, it wasn't enough. A few days later, he told me he was leaving. To the city where he used to live with his ex. A friend of his was looking for a roommate and was struggling financially, so he's going there to help him out, and also because he prefers that city.

I was very hurt and cried a lot, but I didn't try to stop him. I had done everything I could to make him feel comfortable, so I didn't know what else to do. If that wasn't enough, then I couldn't stand in the way of his departure.

A few days later, while we were at a restaurant on Saturday, he told me he was moving on Monday because he had a job interview. I thought I would have more time with him before he left, so I was very sad.

The next day, we planned our last outing, which F tried to tag along on. I refused, saying that it was a moment I wanted to spend with him alone and that if he wanted, he could spend the day with her and the evening with me. Since she is his friend and he was also leaving far away from her, knowing that they had only seen each other two or three times in two months.

He said that it's okay, he wants to spend the day with me anyway so he saw her the morning before going.

After his moving I was extremely sad and disoriented but little by little I was finding my ryhtm. Our roomates were so nice, they took me aside in the living room asking if everything was okay. I reassured them that we did not break up and that he did not like the city so he moved. (PS: He did not like that I said that to them as the reason why he went... idk why).

  
At first, it was kind of hard for me to live alone again and get used to who I was before he was constantly with me. But I eventually managed. In the meantime though, he felt like we were drifting apart and asked me why I was acting colder with him over text. I told him I just had a busy schedule because I started going to the gym after work as the apartment we chose was far from the city center where I was working transportation took me 4h per day. At the end of the day I was exhausted from all the trips, work and the gym workout but it distracted me from how badly it hurt that I couldn’t convince him to stay.

I didn’t know why, but I felt like it was my fault, like maybe he left partly to get away from me. Because after everything that happened with his best friend a few months before, I kept thinking he never really forgave me and that I had to make up for it. And the fact that I couldn’t made me feel like I was just a bad person.

He admitted it wasn’t right to leave so abruptly, especially knowing he had already planned it from the first month we moved in together. Actually from the first weeks, because things were tense between us and we were both stressed. Personally, I didn’t hold it against him, I just wanted to get back to who I used to be before him. But that rhythm of life drained me more than anything.

We were still seeing each other every two or three  weeks. We tried to make it work so one of us would go visit the other. But with the new rent that he was supposed to help me pay (and that was much more expensive than the previous one), it became financially complicated for me.

Fast forward a few months. My internship ended, so I went to join him in the city he lived in. We got an apartment and moved in together. Moving again was a whole disaster, because the guy I booked to help turned out to be an ex-convict, something I didn’t know, who had stolen a truck and was offering moving services illegally. So the truck broke down halfway, and once again, Snow had to come pick me up with his car and we had to do two trips with everything. Nothing went as planned, but in the end I made it there even though it cost me a ridiculous amount of money.

Two or three months before I arrived, I had actually suggested we live in separate apartments, because I had finally found my rhythm alone, or at least I was trying to find it. And I knew that when he was around, I gave everything to him. Cooking, cleaning, taking care of everything… and I completely forget about myself. I wanted to focus on me and on the studies I was moving there for. Most importantly, I wanted to remind myself that I wasn’t moving just for him.

And also as I said, I tend to i inflict silent treatment when I do not feel good and I did that a lot with him. I do not like to do that. I wanted to avoid it at all cost. But it would be difficult if we live together and I have to see him everyday. I am working on that behavior of mine even though confrontation always make me tear up.

But he refused that we live separately. He said it would be easier if we lived together and that he preferred living with me anyway. He insisted so much that I thought it meant he really wanted to be with me, so I agreed.

But unfortunately, nothing changed. He took me for granted when it came to cooking, cleaning, chores, everything. And in the first two months I hadn’t started school yet, so I was home most of the time but still fully paying my share. I even paid the first two months of rent myself.

I was also the one who found the apartment in his city, even though he could’ve done it way more easily than me, someone who had never lived there and was still finishing an internship. On top of that, his schedule was insane, but I was still the one handling everything.

The first two months, I tried to adjust even though it was hard. I had already visited the city before, during a vacation, but I remembered absolutely nothing and I never liked it. Still, I never complained. Whenever he asked, I just said I preferred my old city for now, since I hadn’t been there long. He acted so offended, as if nothing could ever be better than his city.

Eventually classes started and my schedule got crazy again. Just like before: work, school, then home, where I still had to do everything. One day, I just stopped. I stopped doing anything for him. That’s just what happens when someone keeps giving and the effort isn’t mutual, it becomes obvious.

We talked about it again because I withdrew and stayed quiet, and he realized I was burnt out and couldn’t keep doing everything like before.

Recently, he asked if we could host his friend for the weekend. His friend lived two hours away, so we agreed and they spent the weekend together. I was there, trying to enjoy things while still doing what I needed to do because weekends are my only rest time.

Then during the week, he told me his friend was coming again the next weekend. But this time he didn’t ask me he just decided. Meanwhile I had a ton of work, the apartment is tiny, and having three people here is complicated. He just put me in front of a decision that was already made, and I felt like I couldn’t say yes or no. So his friend came again.

After he left, I told my boyfriend that this couldn’t happen again, we live together, and he can’t make decisions alone. That’s when he told me I “showed my ass” to his friend. I didn’t even understand at first because I didn’t remember doing anything like that. Apparently, when I was showing an outfit to both of them, I turned around and his friend stared at my butt and later made a comment about it, saying I had shown it to him and it made him uncomfortable.

I was half-asleep when he told me that, so I just told him he was being annoying and went to sleep. But the next day, I was furious. I didn’t understand why his friend stared at me like that in the first place especially since he’s one of his closest friends and why my boyfriend confronted me instead of questioning his friend’s behavior.

He did that when I was alone in the city of my internship. Anytime I would talk to him about an interaction with a male friend of mine he would get mad. My coworker asked me something weird today « He wants you it’s obvious ». I helped a friend (that work at the gym) make his report after my workout at the gym that’s why I am going home a little later « why are you talking to a man, you said you don’t like men so why are you being nice to him. » He was behind the counter. We didn’t even touch!

So yeah… that’s where things are now.

I feel like the more it goes, the more I feel like he hates me. Last time he said that I was breathing too loud in bed. While I sleep every night through his snoring. When I make any noise he wakes me up or shout my name waking me up scared.

So, what I want to know is I am overreacting to everything? am I toxic to him? Am I a bad girlfriend ? It’s my first real relationship and I want to be the best I can be. please help.

1p95xwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1p95xwe/m30_friend_f31_keeps_dropping_hints_she_wants_to/,"M30, friend F31 keeps dropping hints she wants to be more, but declining offers for hangouts/dates","Hi,

So this post is a continuation on an earlier post, but the topic and situation has changed a bit. Feel free to check it out (unsure if I can link it on here.)

So this friend of mine (F31) whom I see seldomly, mostly at events or parties, keeps on flirting and dropping hints that she is interested, but every time I suggest some other plans with her, she turns it down. The weird part is, she actually has s valid reason every time, and when she declines, its always along the lines of "" I would love to join you, but I don't have money/got other plans already in place, but we will definitely find the time for it someday. I'll be seeing you in the next event anyways""

This has happened three times now, and I am getting quite mixed feelings of it. And it feels weird that she does not want to see me for over a month in person.

Knowing her situation, I don't think she is lying with the excuses, but it feels odd that the only optional thing she suggests is the next event we both have tickets for, and she actually asked me to join her there. 

We do text and play online once, maybe twice a week, and both live quite busy lives, and have some distance between us so things like grabbing a quick coffee etc are not really options. There is not much flirty going on in the texting, or talking during gaming, but it feels like neither are big texters, and gaming with her and oftentimes with her friends really is not a space to even do that.

Now, what I am confused about if she only sees me as a friend, but she has demonstrated, and told me how she treats men she is not interested in, and none of them apply to me. For example getting absolutely livid for another male friend (who has known her for a lot longer, and knows her a lot better than me) for hugging her, but has no issue with touching me, and does not shy away if I touch her. Also she keeps on including me in her future plans, that are months or years away. And she has numerous times made a point out of being single, specifically to me.

Now, I am having some doubts on how to proceed. On one hand, there is a slight chance she missed the fact that I asked her out, I didn't specifically confess, but I have made it clear I am interested, at least in my mind. But she had made a point of men being too pushy, clingy or direct being something she hates, and prefers a ""natural friend to dating"" situation, which makes me think its possible she is interested, but wants to go really slow and get to know me better via group situations. 

So option one is to wait it out, and see what happens.

Option two is that she is pushing for me to confess, and confidently just ask her out.

Option three is that she sees me as just a friend.

I am worried her interest will drop with the time between seeing her like once a month - 2 months in person, and I am torn with just directly clarifying my interest towards her, and asking if its mutual.

LAP offers coffee at a price-quality ratio that’s equal to (and often better*)* than a lot of the so-called artisanal cafés. Apparently that’s a **crime** now for the ones demolishing the concept?

People go where it suits them that’s called... **DEMAND**. Every business has its audience. If yours is leaving because your 5.20€ cappuccino comes from an unserviced machine from 2010 - that’s not LAP’s fault. And I decided to go to LAP because of that. Because I was sick and tired for my local cafe to charge €5 for a flat white, I get it there for €3.

Media pushing this *“Kaffeevollautomaten chain”* fairytale is hilarious, considering the Everysys machines LAP uses cost minimum 40-50K each (I researched it lol). That’s more than many indie cafés have invested in their entire setup for years. But sure, keep romanticizing the myth....

What’s exactly wrong with an idea that actually lowers prices in a market full of overpriced cafés? I’m saying this as someone who knows multiple brunch-place owners: they make **thousands** selling overpriced plates while underpaying staff. Nobody talks about that. WHY?But three guys start a startup that gives people affordable coffee... and suddenly that’s “a threat to culture”? 

Give me a f\* break.

Berlin wants to “save money,” as long as it’s symbolic. Lower rent? Yes please (while you all still rent from mega-corporations). “Support small businesses!” (but you gladly pay 30€ for private fitness classes on the app). No outrage. Clubs? ""Yeah, let's support the culture branch!"" (charge 30€ entry and 12€ for a drink... also no outrage)-

But LAP? Oh no, that’s where the **moral panic starts.** A clever start-up coffe chain offer something people actually like and you frame them as community i.e. society villains?! Learn basic economics before you complain. This isn’t communism.

So yeah, regarding this last ""dispute"" in their stores where they sued people for demolishing flyers inside. I sincerely hope LAP wins the case, expands even more, and destroys this hypocritical, romanticized narrative about “small cafés” that are just as overpriced as everything else in this city.

If that pisses you off: maybe the problem isn’t LAP. Maybe it’s you. 

P.S. no connection to LAP, their founders or the concept, just an average Berliner sick & tired of overpriced lies goin on for years. Cheers to the LAP team for solving this and hold tight. Truth hurts.",0,1764363374.0,berlin,113,0.46,False

Hey Yoinkers! 👋

It's been a wild ride building this thing, and I wanted to give you all a proper update on where we are, where we're going, and how you might be able to help soon.

---

## 🚀 The Dream (Quick Refresher)

For anyone new here: **Yoink Adventures** is a collection tracker for real-life experiences.

Whether you're trying to visit all 63 National Parks, catch a game at every MLB stadium, find every Zoltar machine in America, or just track your favorite taco trucks — Yoink helps you **Discover** where they are, **Log** your visits with photos, and **Share** your progress.

Think Pokémon GO meets a travel journal — but for *anything* you love to collect.

---

## 📍 Where We Are Now

We've been heads-down building the foundation, and I'm excited to say **we're about 60% of the way to our Phase 1 release**.

### ✅ What's Already Working:

- **Authentication** — Sign up with email or Google, password reset, the works
- **Category browsing** — See all the collection types, follow the ones you care about
- **Category filtering** — Click ""Pizza"" and see all the pizza spots people have yoinked
- **Your personal progress** — ""You've visited 5 of 47 locations"" 
- **Admin tools** — Full backend for managing categories, locations, users, and yoinks (gotta keep things tidy!)

### 🔜 What's Coming Next:

- **User profiles** — See anyone's collection and what they've been yoinking
- **Location pages** — All the details about a spot, plus everyone's yoinks there
- **Single yoink view** — Full photos, story, and details for each yoink
- **Map view** — Toggle between grid and map to see where everything is
- **Create a yoink** — The big one! Photo upload, location search, the whole flow
- **Share links** — Generate URLs to share your collections

---

## 🗺️ The Vision

Phase 1 is just the beginning. Here's the bigger picture:

**Phase 1 (Current):** Core app — Discover, Log, Share works for any collection

**Phase 2:** Social features — Follow other collectors, see popular collections nearby, get tips

**Phase 3:** Planning tools — Route planning, bucket lists, family collaboration

**Phase 4:** Community lists — User-created official lists, voting, templates

The goal is to become THE app for anyone who collects experiences. National parks completionists. Stadium chasers. Lighthouse hunters. Taco truck enthusiasts. Cemetery photographers. Vintage arcade seekers. 

*Everyone collects something* — most people just don't realize it yet.

---

## ♿ Building It Right: Accessibility First

This is something I'm really proud of.

We're building Yoink to **WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standards from Day 1**. That means:

- Full keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support throughout  
- Proper focus management
- High contrast, large touch targets

**Why?** Because everyone deserves to yoink.

I have a friend who's blind and an absolute wizard on his iPhone with VoiceOver. He's going to be testing throughout development. If he can't use a feature, it's not done.

Retrofitting accessibility later is a nightmare. Building it in from the start? That's just good engineering. And it makes the app better for *everyone* — not just users with disabilities.

---

## 🤖 The ""Vibe Coding"" Experiment

I've been building this with AI assistants (Claude, specifically), and it's been a fascinating process.

We plan together, discuss changes before making them, build incrementally, and keep detailed documentation. It's like pair programming with a very patient partner who never gets tired and always remembers the architecture docs.

Is it faster than coding solo? Sometimes. Is it different? Absolutely. The back-and-forth forces me to think through decisions more carefully, and the documentation game is *strong*.

I might write more about this process later if people are interested.

---

## 🎯 Initial Test Markets

When we're ready for beta, I'm thinking about focusing on a few specific collection types to start:

- **National Parks** — Defined list, passionate community, clear progress tracking
- **MLB Stadiums** — Same energy, perfect for the completionist crowd
- **Coffee shops / Local food** — Infinite collection, great for casual users
- **Roadside attractions** — The quirky stuff (giant dinosaurs, Zoltar machines, neon signs)

These give us a good mix of completionists vs. casual collectors, defined vs. infinite collections, and travel-focused vs. local discovery.

**What collections would YOU want to track?** Drop them in the comments — I'm genuinely curious what niches we should prioritize.

---

## 🙋 Want to Beta Test?

We're not quite ready yet, but we're getting close.

If you want to be among the first to try Yoink Adventures when we hit Phase 1, drop a comment or DM me. I'll start building a list and reach out when we're ready for testers.

**What I'll need from beta testers:**
- Willingness to actually use it (create yoinks, browse, share)
- Honest feedback on what works and what's confusing
- Bug reports when things break (they will)
- Patience while we fix things

**Bonus points if you:**
- Have a specific collection you're already tracking (even informally)
- Use accessibility tools (screen readers, keyboard navigation)
- Are willing to share screenshots/feedback publicly

---

## 📅 Timeline?

Honestly? I'm not putting hard dates on it. This is a passion project, and I'd rather ship something solid than rush something broken.

But if I had to guess: **Phase 1 beta in the next few months**. I'll keep posting updates here as we hit milestones.

---

## 💬 Questions? Ideas? Just Want to Chat?

This community is small but mighty. I read every comment and genuinely want to hear what you think.

- What collections are you excited to track?
- What features matter most to you?
- Any concerns about the direction?

Let's build this together. 🎉

— Dru

Not sure how this works and it’s the first time I’m posting on here. 
But if there’s any millionaires or billionaires out there reading this that would like to help a girl out that would be great and very very appreciated!! Especially during this festive period…….

I’m a 35 year old with 2 kids living in the north east of England. I’m a business owner and a nurse. How is it then that I’m just about making ends meet! 
I have a retail business where I employ 3 staff. I have no issues with that as that money is helping someone else put food on their table and that money gets circulated back into the economy. 

I do my bit in the business and do shifts as well as looking after my kids, and doing my nurse shifts. I’ve had the business for the past 8 years, and have been a nurse for nearly 15 years. 

I’ve noticed over the past 5 years that customers are spending less and less, but my taxes are going higher and higher. How am I meant to survive with less footfall, as the government are squeezing every average earner to the bone, but also mange to pay loads of tax and manage to feed my family and keep a roof over our heads. January, February and March are our quietest months, I also have £2500 tax bill going out in January which is just for my business. My busting tax is separate. How are we expected to keep afloat, let alone safe. 

At this time I’m genuinely thinking about selling up, because what else can I do. I already work two jobs, I have one Starbucks/Costco every couple of months. I refuse to buy Chinese or Indian takeaways as they are too expensive and I allow the kids to have a McDonald’s or pizza once a week. Chinese is my daughter’s favourite so as a substitute I try to make it at home for her. 

Me and my kids don’t wear branded items. All our clothes, shoes, uniforms and work clothes come from Primark, Asda and Shein. Or I buy second things from eBay or Facebook market place. 

I only have an Amazon prime subscription and no other subscriptions. We don’t have Netflix, NOW, Disney etc. I don’t get my nails done, or any other beauty treatments. I do get my hair done once a year. I know getting my hair done isn’t essential but I work so hard and is it wrong to treat myself once a year?!

Apart from the odd Starbucks once every couple of months and a maccys once a week there is genuinely no where else I can make savings from. 
I have £9000 on my business credit card to pay off, £2000 on my personal one. I owe £4000 to one wholesaler, and £2000 to another. 

I’ve looked into many other ways and means of making money but I just don’t seem to understand how in this day and age you can work over 50 hours a week and still be on you arse! My business opens 7 days a week and is open for over 10 hours a day. I work 12 hours shifts as a nurse and in the mids of all of that where am I supposed to find more time to fit in another job! 

I’m sick of being told by the government that if we cut out coffee and subscriptions we will all be fine and have enough money to buy a house and live a great life, but that just is not the case! 

The MPs are mostly millionaires and are very out of touch with reality. Most don’t even know how much a pint of milk or a loaf of bread costs these days! 
I don’t want to get too political but I really have no faith in our government, nor any other party that takes over. 

If you read till the end, thank you so much for listening to me. 
I know I’m luckier than a lot of others in the UK, but my argument is we shouldn’t have to work to exhaustion and be putting in so many hours a week and getting the bare minimum in return for our efforts. 

And if you would like to send some money my way then that would be appreciated!

Part One: [Decentralized or Destitute](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1p85ooe/part_one_of_can_i_pay_with_this_a_stablecoin/)  
*Money, monkeys and mild terror*

**Part Two: First Contact with Reality** <-- you are here  
*KYC on a hostel bunk bed*



I arrive in Buenos Aires and immediately discover that Twitter has lied to me. Various digital nomads had insisted that there was no need for cash in Buenos Aires anymore. Don't bother bringing dollars or euros.

It is true that Argentina is currently in a period of relative exchange stability after years of crippling inflation (for ex, 211% in 2023). Using a foreign credit or debit card then meant you'd get the terrible *Official Rate*. In reality, everyone used the black market *Blue Rate* which at times could give you almost double as many pesos for your dollars. But now that the two rates have converged, the  Twitterati explained, it is safe to use your cards again.

I believed them. Now I have regrets.

The taxi app crashes; the driver is happy to take me anyway for the original amount or even a discount, but he will only accept pesos in cash. My hostel wants a cash deposit for the towel. The first coffee shop I walk into has a big sign: We do not take cards. The man at the subway won't let me top up my newly acquired SUBTE card unless I handed over cash pesos. Not to mention restaurants offering discounts ranging from 10% to an eyewatering 25%  just for paying with actual paper money. And let's not talk about the obvious scowls if I even *think* about tipping my server using my card.

I need to find out how to get cash, fast.

The hostel owner gives the same lecture to every new arrival. Yes, you can get pesos on the black market. However, here are the neighbourhoods that you must not enter if you value your life. Keep your money in your pocket whenever you are outside. Don't take selfies unless you want to lose your phone.

He shrugs confusedly when I ask if I can trade stablecoins for pesos. I need dollars, he tells me.

Once he's convinced that I'm taking him seriously, he gives me directions to a man in a jewelry shop whom he trusts, who will buy my Euros. Don't trade with anyone outside on the street, he tells me. It's dangerous. I can pay the towel deposit later, don't worry. Just be safe! Don't trade on the street.

The streets in question, Calles Lavalle and Florida, are full of men and women calling cambio, cambio, cambio de dolares! every few meters. Mindful of the hostel advice, I ignore them and walk to the jewelry store. A man outside asks if I want to trade and waves me into the tiny shop with an old man sitting with a large cash register. Watches of various values are laid out on the counter.

When I ask if they take stablecoins, he actually laughs. I try again: What about debit cards? Only if I wanted to buy a watch.

I trade 50 euro for many tens of thousands of pesos. I feel conspicuous carrying this much cash, unsafe. I try not to look vulnerable.

I'm crossing a road when a guy walking towards me passes too closely, brushing my shoulder. There was plenty of room and no reason for it. I turn to see who bumped into me and discover he's turned too, standing a few meters behind me, staring at me. As our eyes lock, he turns again and walks away.

That evening, another resident tells me that he didn't bother with the owner's instructions. It was easy to get pesos, he says. ""I just walked up to some guy on the street and handed him $500.""

Peer to peer, yes. But I think I'm not that brave.

I unpack my three T-shirts and two Android phones and a tablet and a keyboard for the tablet and another travel keyboard, a cute little pink thing that folds up, which I keep in the back pocket of my hoodie, so it is easy access to pull out and use with my phone in coffee shops.

The next assignment: wrestle with a pile of Argentine Web3 apps promoted by Devconnect to showcase Argentine innovation.

They aren't wrong. Argentina is certainly punching above its weight when it comes to Web3 development. There's an almost romantic backstory there, going back to innovation hubs like *Casa Voltaire* (2014-2016) which led to actual, very-real projects such as Decentraland and OpenZeppelin. Today, Argentina ranks second in Latin America for Web3 developers, despite having only a fraction of the population of Brazil or Mexico. Grassroots communities such as Ethereum Argentina and Crecimiento are dedicated to transforming the country into LATAM's crypto capital.

But when I download the apps, I discover that they are not for meant for me.

Lemon Cash and Belo require a national identity number from a South American country. Ripio lists six countries, including Mexico and - unexpectedly - USA residents and non-residents. As a non-resident of the USA, I start filling in their form, which happily accepts my Euro-credentials and then asks me to upload a copy of my W8BEN, which is essentially the IRS asking you to declare that you are *not* an American, so they can find some other way to punish you. I back out quietly and delete the app.

The tablet's keyboard fails on the first day, the bluetooth connection hiccupping and disconnecting. The smaller pink keyboard will work for both phone and tablet, however, and I feel smug that I have built-in redundancy. I get back to work with barely a hitch.

I see someone talking about payment solutions on the DevConnect Telegram channel. A new batch of Web3 apps with an elegant premise: use a stablecoin wallet to pay merchants who use the QR-code system in Argentina. Grocery stores, pharmacies and little kiosks that sell novelty mate mugs all accept QR payments, in a system regulated by the Central Bank of Argentina under the *Tranferencias 3.0* initiative. It's not quite escaping traditional finance, but the initiative requires that all payment service providers and banks use the same standardized QR code generator. The Web3 apps plug into the QR scaffolding that already exists, allowing me to hold stablecoins (USDC or USDT, depending on the app) and spend in pesos.

KYC is required to comply with local regulations. I quickly try Peanut and Yodl, which both offer QR payments for Argentina and Brazil, Yodl also works in Vietnam and the Philippines.  To my surprise, the Know Your Customer (KYC) isn't completely soul-crushing. I enter my address, upload my passport screenshot and minutes later I can move money into my wallet using one of a number of Ethereum Layer 2s designed to make transactions faster and cheaper. Both use Arbitrum, which is a relief. Peanut wants USDC, Yodl wants USDT .

This isn't to say that I was happy with KYC as a part of my solution. This is the requirement to collect personal identifying data to ensure that you, as a provider, can prove that you  ""know your customer"".  KYC regulations require that financial applications collect information about their users in order to reduce money laundering and financial fraud, despite billions poured into compliance yearly with little noticeable impact, if any.

An additional catch is that many applications use KYC as an excuse to collect additional data or to filter out customers that they don't like. KYC info is often used as an anti-sybil measure. Ether.fi rejected me because I live in a country that they don't want to deal with. And I'm still feeling salty about going through KYC with Monerium when it was in beta, who then informed me that I couldn't have an account because I wasn't notable enough. I am apparently too boring for the future of finance.

But also... this KYC is easy for me because I'm exactly who financial systems want to offer accounts to. I have a passport from a country that matters, my name linked to an address that exists on official forms, documentation proving I am who I claim to be. I thought that part of the point of alternative finance was to help those people that banks won't or can't serve.

Meanwhile, I'm sitting cross-legged on a hostel bunk, surrounded by charging cables, relying on the hostel's Wi-Fi signal remaining strong enough to upload another photograph of my passport. The future of finance still seems to require centralized government approval.

Another issue: So far, everything I've looked at makes me transfer my money from my wallet to theirs. I instinctively want to say that they are custodial. But no: the apps *all* say that they are self-custodial, which is confusing the hell out of me. I can't link my own wallet. I have to send funds from *my* wallet to a wallet in their app. How is that self-custody?

Peanut uses passkeys, saved with Apple or Google, rather than trusting me to store my own details. There is no way to gain control of the wallet they create on my behalf. Their docs insist that it is self-custodial because they don't actually hold the funds and can't spend them on my behalf. I can kinda see the argument, if what they mean is that thewallet is *not custodial*. But I don't think ""we can't spend your money for you"" is what *self-custody* means.

Yodl seems better in this regard: they generate an embedded wallet using Privy and apparently it is possible to gain control of the wallet by bypassing Yodl and using Privy options to export your keys. I have no idea how to do this and I had to wade through their terms and conditions to even find that information.

Neither app has any option for exporting the wallet or any option at all, other than to submit a transaction to withdraw the funds to another wallet. There are no details on recovery. As of right now, if they disappear overnight, so does my money.

On the other hand, I understand that they want to make their apps straight-forward. I appreciate that these middlemen are the only reason that I can buy empanadas without explaining smart contracts to a bakery.  They are connecting Web3 to meatspace by plugging into an existing QR system, which is truly useful. I distinctly feel that they don't  *want* to be gatekeepers, they want to be guides.

But it doesn't feel right. I'm learning that sometimes words in DeFi don't mean what I think they mean.

I consider renaming my challenge. *Decentralized-ish with bonus Customer Support or Destitute except for a wallet full of cash and three cards* .

I'm looking for a mature woman, who has a zest for life is probably the best way i can say it, im not going to pigeonhole looks or attractiveness, as im more attracted to the personality and confidence.

I'm definitely looking for someone to enhance my life, my marriage is good, but it's definitely lacking in areas.  
The thing is though, we seem to have fallen into taking each other for granted, feeling too comfortable, lack of effort has now pushed way to feeling a little invisible, plus we have older kids who will probably fly the nest within a few years, and so im unsure how we'll navigate just being a couple.

It's more about finding a place where we can just be ourselves, without fear of being judged, revealing little bits of our quirky personality one step at a time, savouring each moment the more we become invested in each other and how we live our lives.

It's more about stealing moments together when time allows, almost feels like the world has stopped for the both of us.

You're just as open and honest as i am, a woman who isn't afraid to just be herself, a confident, quirky, and sometimes feisty, you're emotionally intelligent, down to earth, but also a free spirit.  
When i visualise who you are, im thinking the mum next door and maybe underneath your wife and mother responsibilities, lies a woman itching to be noticed again. 

As for me, i see myself as a gentleman, im polite and courteous, i say strange words like ""please"" and ""thank you"".

The update aims to move Maps beyond static directions into a tool that can answer natural-language questions, summarize areas, and suggest routes based on more contextual cues about what users are trying to do.

Early previews show **Gemini** being used to generate area overviews, such as explaining what a neighborhood is known for, highlighting common types of businesses, or flagging popular local spots. Instead of manually scanning dozens of pins and reviews, users can ask broader questions like *“What’s a quieter area with coffee shops and parks nearby?”* and receive synthesized suggestions that draw on Maps data, reviews, and other signals.

On the navigation side, **AI assistance** is being tested to refine route options by factoring in more than just distance and traffic. Over time, **Google** says **Gemini** could weigh patterns like typical congestion, road closures, and even user preferences for certain road types or stop locations. The company is also exploring how to keep explanations more *transparent*, so people understand why a particular route or recommendation was surfaced.

**Privacy advocates** are watching closely, since smarter personalization usually requires more data. **Google** maintains that many of **Gemini’s** functions can run *on-device* or in privacy-preserving ways, but critics want clearer disclosures about what information is stored, how long it’s kept, and how tightly it is linked to advertising profiles. Maps has long straddled the line between convenience and *surveillance concerns*, and **AI-driven** features only sharpen that tension.

For everyday users, the appeal is straightforward: less time hunting through lists and more time getting tailored answers to practical questions about where to go and how to get there. The real test will be whether **Gemini’s** suggestions feel genuinely useful and trustworthy, or whether people see them as yet another algorithm making *opaque decisions* in the background.

At Thanksgiving yesterday, I found myself going through the family album. In it, were quite a few pictures from that day. Going down memory lane again, so I penned this last night. 

November 2008

For Ashley and little A

We had been dating for about a month at this point and as each day passed, we grew. We already knew. She still had one foot in her apartment, but her toothbrush was already in my bathroom and her dog tags were on my nightstand when she wasn’t wearing them.

When my Mom said, “Bring that girl to Thanksgiving,” Ashley just grinned and answered to me, “Yes ma’am,” like she’d been waiting her whole life for the invitation.

She decided on a little black dress that somehow looked both Sunday-church and Friday-night-dangerous, black boots and hair that was perfectly done as she fretted for what seemed like hours. She must have asked if I thought they’d like her a million times. 

We arrived at Mom’s around noon. Ashley was carrying a bottle of Crown Royal for my Dad and a coconut cake she’d baked at 3 a.m. I’m not sure she slept more than few hours that night. It was important to her.

My Mom opened the door, took one look, gave her a hug that must of lasted a full thirty seconds. Inside, the house smelled like like Mom had been cooking all night. The fireplace was roaring, football pre-game was on mute, and every relative in a fifty-mile radius was already arguing over whose turn it was to carve.

Ashley never flinched.

Dad shook her hand, saw the Crown, and said, “Son, you finally did something right.” To which, I got the famous Ashley smirk. 

My niece, who was four years old and shy with everyone, took one look at the dog tags peeking out of Ashley’s dress and whispered, “Are you a superhero?” Ashley crouched down, let the kid hold the tags, and answered, “Only when your uncle needs saving.”

Dinner was chaos and perfection. Ashley sat right beside me, thigh pressed to mine under the table, and stealing bites off my plate every time Mom looked away. My brother asked about stories from Iraq and my niece tried to climb in her lap, all to which she was happy to oblige. 

However, when my Dad asked if she could shoot, she just smiled and said, “Better than your son, sir.” The table erupted. She had won them over. 

After dessert, when the kids were half-asleep on the couch and the fire was popping low, mom pulled Ashley into the kitchen to “help with coffee.” I followed a minute later and caught the tail end.

My Mom had both of Ashley’s hands in hers and was saying, softly, “Welcome to the family. Table’s always got room for one more.”

Later, on the back porch with the fire crackling through the open door and a light fog rolling in off of the field, she stood behind me with her arms around my waist and chin on my shoulder and whispered into the dark: “I think they like me.”

Thanksgiving 2008: the day Ashley walked into my parents’ house outside Savannah with a coconut cake and a nervous smile, and walked out with a family who’d already decided she was never leaving.

That’s how she arrives in my memory.  
It might’ve been a Mongoose. It might’ve been red.  
Time keeps those details the way a perverted old archivist keeps everything—bad lighting, wrong labels.  
I probably traded them in at university for set theory and sorting algorithms.  
  
But I know she wore a lacrosse pinny.  
Summer 2011 uniform.  
  
It’s 2 a.m.  
Small town asleep.  
We’re on the football-field grass under a July moon.  
We used to meet there, quietly.  
She was a year older.  
She was the girl between the girls.  
And I was less than that to her.  
  
We joked, flirted, poked at each other.  
At some outdoor concert we breathed Burnett’s vodka into each other’s faces.  
I said something stupid.  
She slapped me.  
Later we made up and kissed.  
Then didn’t talk for a while.  
That was the rhythm: brief chaos, then nothing.  
  
She was cool as hell.  
We were both killing time.  
  
She went to college.  
By October of my senior year I was already dating someone else.  
After that, Ellie and I didn’t talk.  
Not out of drama—just nothing to say.  
  
On breaks I’d get coffee with the kids I did keep up with.  
Resume exchanges, “we’re getting older” conversations.  
But not Ellie.  
Not because of anything.  
Just how life sorts itself.  
  
I heard she moved to Chicago.  
Whenever someone from the Erie Canal towns makes it out, I root for them quietly.  
Like I hope someone roots for me in Boston.  
  
Today an old friend texted.  
Ellie died.  
  
I’ve spent the morning trying to charge time with the crime,  
when it was fate—slipping around, throwing sucker punches, then disappearing.  
  
It stole the chance for one stupid, pleasant conversation at Topps Friendly Markets—  
maybe in the produce aisle, both of us hunting for sprouted bread,  
two former small-town kids comparing big-city habits.  
Five minutes of “good to see you.”  
A real hug.  
  
And it stole a mother from a two-year-old.  
  
I called in sick.  
I took a drive.

So I built an app where you just talk to it.,"Used to spend 4+ hours every weekend manually entering transactions into expensive expense trackers. Four hours. Every weekend. Just typing numbers.

At some point I realized – time is our most valuable resource, and I was wasting mine on data entry. So I built Floosy.

The idea is simple: just talk to it naturally.

Say something like: ""Had breakfast with Tommy, spent 65 and my share was 25, then had coffee with Aaron for 43 and we split evenly, then took a taxi home for 18""

And it logs:

* Breakfast with tommy (Category: Restaurant)
   * Your share: $25
   * Tommy: $40
* Coffee with Aaron (Category: Snacks & Drinks) 
   * Your share: $21.50
   * Aaron: $21.50
* Taxi (Category: Transportation) $18

One sentence. Three transactions. Automatic splitting. Done.

Or try: ""Yesterday's grocery run was 120, dinner with Sarah cost 85 and she owes 50, grabbed gas for 45 on the way back""

It understands dates, who owes whom, categories – all from natural speech.

**What makes it different:**

* Voice commands – speak naturally, log multiple transactions at once
* AI chat interface – or type if you prefer
* Bill splitting built in – handles ""my share was"", ""split evenly""
* 44+ currencies – built for MENA region but works globally
* No bank connections – privacy first, you control your data
* Bilingual – works in English and Arabic seamlessly

**The honest bit:**

I'm a solo indie dev. This isn't backed by some VC fund – its just me building something I genuinely needed. Theres still a lot I want to add, and I'm actively improving it based on feedback.

**Early adopter offer:**

First 100 users can grab 3 months of Pro free with code ALPHA. I just want real users and honest feedback at this stage.

Honestly the stuff it can do is getting me more excited every day, but there’s always this mix of creative tasks and really boring backend work sitting on my plate.

Last Monday I sat down with my weekly plan like a responsible adult, fully ready to finally tackle all the boring-but-important backend things I’ve been avoiding.

You know… the “yeah I’ll fix that tomorrow” items that have been tomorrow for 3 weeks.

About 2 hours into boring optimization, my brain just went:  
**“What if I try video-to-video real quick?”**

Just one tiny test. Just five minutes tops. Then I’d go right back to the responsible stuff (lol).

Fast-forward a few hours later and:

* the backend tasks are untouched
* my coffee died a slow death
* I forgot to eat
* 27 IDE tabs
* and somehow the new feature is not only working… it’s genuinely insane

And at that point I was like:

* stop now and be responsible, or
* keep going and fully embrace the chaos

So obviously I shipped it.

Users were playing with it almost immediately, so eventually it was worth it.

I don’t share much about myself, but we became best friends.


Over time I got used to her messages. I rarely start the conversation, but most days started and ended with her texts. I think I got attached to her.


The problem started recently when she began talking about going on dates. That made me feel sad, like I would miss her constant talking. I wasn’t sure if I was sad or scared. I freaked out, wondering if I had feelings for her. I always thought friends were just friends. After thinking about it for days, I realized it wasn’t love — it was just attachment and fear of losing her company.


Then I got busy and we didn’t talk for about a week. When we finally talked again, I noticed her replies had become slow. I felt some distance. Later at the office, she told me things were getting serious with someone. The next day she said she had already said yes to him a few days earlier. I felt like she hesitated when telling me, but maybe I’m overthinking it.


We still talk and tease each other like always, but sometimes I feel some tension. I miss her company. How do people deal with this when their best friend gets busy after starting a relationship?

I’ve only googled about it, a lot, but I didn’t find anyone who has been through this. Any advice would be appreciated.

Last week, as I went down the stairs to catch my usual subway home from work, I took the wrong one. Well, I thought I was just distracted, but now I know it was, in a way, on purpose. 

In the first couple of minutes, I felt stupid. Some twenty-minute delay to rest after a long day at work. But it didn’t take long for me to feel like I was going somewhere familiar. I started to remember the view out the window like an old picture you don’t remember taking. And when I arrived at a certain station, I knew to get out and which set of stairs to take.

Outside was the usual street, indistinguishable from any of the thousand others downtown. But I recognized some of the stores. I started on a path I didn’t know where it was gonna take me. Street signs, trash cans. I remembered that place. Even though I didn’t remember how, I knew where to go.

Approaching a small square, I saw a beautiful oak tree swaying in the light breeze. A white, wooden bench under its shadow painted a bucolic frame, defiant of the surrounding concrete. But something else caught my attention: An ice cream parlor. I remember that, clearly, if not disconnected in time.

Bells clanged as I opened the door, drowning me in a lost memory. I remembered the checkerboard-tiled floor, the colors of the yellowed sign behind the counter, the rusty fan squeaking every other turn. I must’ve stood there for a while, because I came to my senses when the attendant yelled, “Can I help you?”

I was too dazed to respond as I normally would, but I managed to “autopilot” myself closer to him. My eyes went straight to a certain flavor on the faded sign. He was going through his usual presentation of sizes and prices when I interrupted: “Chocolate Chip. Large!” He was taken aback a bit, but nodded and continued the process. 

There was a large sink behind him that I then. A faucet, dripping. I didn’t know then why that bothered me so much, but every drop seemed to sound so loud falling into metal. It brought me out of that dream state. I felt like I should jump over the counter and turn it tight. This was never a pet peeve of mine. Which bothered me more than the sink itself.  Thankfully, he handed me my order, and I went to sit far away from that.

I looked at that bowl, thinking about how long it had been since I had a treat like that. A little bite of that creamy texture, the crunchy chocolate chip bursting with flavor, and I remembered. I remembered what I remembered. 

Going there with my dad, ordering the same flavor every time. I remember him joking about that, saying I should try something else. I remember sitting there staring at my hero. Never thinking about that time of day, never minding the price of the ice cream.

Man, I enjoyed eating that! 

I was almost licking the bowl. I didn’t want to leave, but I could always go back some other day. Bring my own kid.

I wanted to squeeze more out of this little vacation. My face hurt from smiling. I sat under that oak. Watched the day hurry away for a bit. Another rare, pleasant breeze, and I was in heaven. I closed my eyes and heard the leaves clapping gently above me, then I looked up at them.

That… hit me like a sucker punch to the gut. I felt nauseous, weak. That image made me sink into the bench, to whole city spinning around me. That tree, spinning. 

I got up straight away and went home. I had to lie about being late. I wasn’t excited about my memories anymore. I told the wife that I had to finish some things at work, she didn’t question it. They had dinner already, I wasn’t hungry. One long shower and I was in bed, not sleeping, of course. 

The whole night I kept thinking about that damn tree. The leaves falling, spiraling towards the ground. Why did it hurt me? I couldn’t place it, like a… like an invisible itch! A rock I could not get out of my shoe.

The next day was spent watching the hands on the office clock run extra slow, as if mocking me. Work seemed meaningless, and coffee didn’t help, but I suffered through it and could run back to that cursed wooden bench. I ran down the subway's stairs, into that fateful train.

The details that had allured me before, were a blur now. The stores, street signs, trash cans. Fuck the chocolate chip ice cream! I went straight to that bench under the oak, sat and looked up. As much as it was bothering me all day, looking at it was unbearable. I looked around, considered leaving. But I had to figure it out. It was killing me.

So I studied it. Every scrap and speck. Every branch that led into a small branch and then a smaller one after that. Even now, if I could draw, I could show you the smallest details. Every scratch classified by how deep it was, by how old it looked. The faintest change in color, the position of the moss in relation to the sun that set in the background, as I watched the leaves falling onto me. The city sounds muffled. I must have looked insane to anyone passing by. But I figured it out! Only, I still can’t sleep.

I went home defeated and with a stiff neck. Had to come up with a much better lie to explain being late, almost four hours this time. She again didn’t care. A longer shower then the bed. Branches projected into the ceiling. I could hear the sway of the oak in the breeze, could feel the leaves touching my face as they fell, spinning like my thoughts, never-ending.

All because, maybe, they haven’t fixed the squeaking fan in twenty years. I find it pretty hard to believe that they never changed the flavors, never updated the prices, never fixed that damn dripping faucet. But there is no way that tree has remained the same all these years.

The same branches, same holes, and scratches. Same as when I was a kid?

I don’t know if this is a type of psychosis, some mental illness manifested late in life. Google, Reddit, Quora, nobody has ever talked about it. If there is a term that I can read about, look for an answer, please tell me. If you repost this anywhere, send me a dm, so I can read the comments.

My deadbeat dad never bought me ice cream.

1p957js,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianBoysOnTinder/comments/1p957js/why_are_so_many_men_so_comfortable_cheating/,Why are so many men so comfortable cheating??,"So I matched with this guy on Hinge a while ago and honestly, I wasn’t even using Hinge properly at that point. My profile was basically a résumé with a face. I literally had “open to referrals” in there. 💀

So when this guy matched with me and we started talking, I thought it was just friendly conversation or maybe networking. 

His profile said he wanted someone to grab coffee or beer with nothing romantic, nothing wild. No red flags.

We talked for a few days and everything seemed normal. Then out of curiosity I asked him if he had a girlfriend.

He goes: “Oh yeah, I’m married. My wife lives in the USA. And I'm here for my visa renewal.""

And I’m like… okay? Cool? Not my business. At least now the 'just happy hours' thing makes sense.

But then the vibe started shifting, when one day he randomly tells me this trip to India is like his “extended bachelor party.” 

He wants to experience things he “can’t because he’s married.” That sentence alone gave me the ick, but I still tried to pretend he was joking.

Fast forward a few days, I casually tell him I’m going to sleep and my laptop’s next to me because I was watching something.

And suddenly Mr. “Just here for coffee” texts:
“If I were there, I’d move your laptop and sleep next to you.”

That message literally made my soul leave my body.

Like sir… YOU. ARE. MARRIED.
And I haven’t flirted with you once??

It was such a weird moment because it reminded me how casually some men treat cheating, like it’s a side quest they’re entitled to.

And honestly? After seeing the latest cheating rumors and realities, my brain went right back to this dude.

Some men aren’t unhappy. They’re just opportunity hunters.

Anyway, needed that off my chest.

And the funniest part?
After all this, he actually asked me:

""Come on, seriously… why do girls expect to find something real on Hinge or dating apps?”

Sir… maybe because we’re not the ones cheating on our spouse for “extended happy hours.”

1p9566n,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1p9566n/my_parents_continue_to_invite_my_ex_husband_and/,My parents continue to invite my ex husband and kids over for holidays/dinners but never me,"Anyone else have to deal with this shit?!

TLDR: My mom and stepdad are bypassing any interaction with me to spend more time with my kids by inviting them and my stb ex husband over for events. 

So, my mother and I have had some fallouts in recent years of the typical, daughter growing up and realizing there is a lot of pain from her childhood, trying to understand, never being understood, and being scapegoated because I can't seem to tend to a relationship with my mother who never wishes to repair variety. 

She calls me once and then says things like, ""you never want to hear from me so I don't call."" She tRiE$ so hArD! But you know we can count the number of times she has reached out in the last two years on maybe two hands. 

Last year, she has dropped by unannounced to our house with gifts for the kids when the kids were home alone for an hour, asking our kids to be let in (thankfully, they did not), not contacting us, the parents once, and then taking the gifts with them and going home. 

Every few months she'll show up, texting a request to go out for coffee or to come over to my house with no idea of what she actually wants to say or do during it. I politely decline because I'm tired of feeling like a hostage for her comfort, especially when she doesn't make any attempt to do anything but get me yapping for the sake of her comfort. 

She thinks I'm holding the kids ransom from her (her words), rather than asking for repair without me being being the one who comes up with the entire game plan for her to just ignore any ways. I don't know what it feels like to have a mother who actually wants to be the parent in the relationship. 

My stepdad is just her enabler. The last message I received from him was him demanding that I thank my mother for her lame ass card for my birthday from her two days after a very difficult birthday. I told him I didn't realize that my birthday was all about my mom. He said it isn't, but it'd be nice if I could thank her.  

They have no idea why I'm actually getting divorced. In fact, even though they have never been close to my ex or even liked him much, my mother went out to coffee with my ex back in March. During that time all I got was a ""I heard about you and (ex) getting divorced and I'm so sorry"" text. 

So I shouldn't be surprised that my kids are coming home and telling me that they get to go to my parents tomorrow for Thanksgiving. I called it yesterday in conversation with someone close to me. They also did this right after the birthday card debacle. It's a total mix of ""of course they did"" and ""what the actual fuck is this.""

If you told me that your parents are inviting your ex and kids over without ever once inviting you over to their house (this is true, all the offers to connect have been somewhere in public or to just come over and trap me in my own house) I'd be so pissed for you. 

But ultimately, I just want to be able to accept it and get past it. At least now my mother can feel like she gets access to my kids without me having to put up with her bullshit. And I have to imagine how painfully awkward it must be for my ex and parents to interact when they have never actually liked each other, both confiding in me that they felt the other party was weird and hard to talk to. My ex has all of his family supporting him while he fucking cut and ran and feels as though he owes me absolutely nothing, not even relieving me of the burden of packing up his shit and storing the boxes in the garage. And now he's schmoozing with my family. Just honestly, what the fuck. 

If you have any mocktails, that would be great!

(Note: any simple WDT tool is fine.)



# Tier 2 — Strongly Recommended

**4. IMS precision basket** (more consistent flow + better tasting shots)  
18g IMS Precision NANOTECH  
[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BR5RY6XN?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BR5RY6XN?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share)

**5. Puck screen** (keeps group head clean + encourages even water dispersion)  
Yaomiao 53.3mm Puck Screen (2 pack)  
[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZYYS2BB?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZYYS2BB?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share)

# Tier 3 — Helpful but Optional

**7. Bottomless portafilter**  
Great learning tool for diagnosing channeling.  
[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJMVBTRN?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJMVBTRN?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share)

**8. Knock box**  
Convenient for cleanup, protects your portafilter.  
Breville Knock Box Mini  
[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CTW7F2L7?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CTW7F2L7?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share)



# Tier 4 — Optional / Situational

**9. Distributor / leveling tool**  
CREMA 54mm Hand Distributor  
[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0895GP4QF?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0895GP4QF?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share)

*BUT*:  
– Community feedback says spinning distributors can create uneven density (compressed top, loose bottom).  
– Better method: use your WDT to rake + level the bed, then tamp.

1p9503l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dell/comments/1p9503l/need_help_deciding_on_dell_laptop_config/,Need help deciding on Dell laptop & config,"Despite my love for my circa 2011 Windows 7 system, I am being forced to move on since the entire world pretty much has moved on w/o me - I can't even pay my credit card bill online now with my current system...lol

So, I have decided to buy a Dell laptop during the Black Friday sale, and, having spent my morning coffee time lurking on the Dell site, I have a couple of questions that I hope I can get answered here before moving forward.

My budget is a thousand bucks, which looks like I am left with only their Plus line to choose from. That is fine. The 2 choices I am on the fence about, and the reason I came here, is RAM and screen size.

I am leaning towards 32 GB of RAM. My old Win 7 system has 16, and it leaves me with about 11 GB free after booting. I have no experience with Win 11, but I fully expect it to take up a lot more space than my beloved Win 7. Since the price diff between 16 and 32 on the Dell laptops I priced today is only $150, 32 GB seems like a no brainer. Except for one thing....

And that is screen size. The Dell plus line offers 14, 15, and 16"" screen sizes. From looking at other brands and reading reviews over the past several months, it appears to me that 15.6"" has pretty much become the standard, or at least the most common, screen size for laptops. My old eyes would much prefer 17"", especially after being used to a 27"" LCD screen for so long. But taking size and weight into consideration, I am gonna pass on the 17"" screen. What strikes me as strange about Dell in this area is that it appears that the actual screen size of their Plus 15 line is 15.6"". Well that's great....except none of their Plus 15 line is available with 32 GB of RAM !! The Plus 14 \*and\* the Plus 16 lines both have 32 GB as an option. Can someone explain this to me ?

So, atm I am leaning toward the Plus 16 - going from 14"" screen to 16"" screen appears to only be $50 extra - with 32 GB RAM. Dell's Black Friday deal for that system is $849.99 (reg price $1299.99). I have not found better for these specs.

Somebody stop me if I am totally wrong about this....please !!",1,1764361138.0,Dell,1,1.0,False

It’s a fully economy-driven RP environment, built around effort, reputation, and cause-and-effect storytelling. Every paycheck, every arrest, every deal, every business, every rivalry—everything carries weight. Characters aren’t temporary; they develop through earned experience, consequences, and the connections they forge. The result is a city that feels alive, reactive, and grounded in realism. It’s not a theme park server—it’s a place where the world moves because the players do.

A major part of capturing that movement comes from the two in-city newspapers, each preserving a different slice of life.

 **Feely Good News** brings a warm, personal lens to everyday moments, choosing to highlight the people who make the city worth living in. Their editor writes like someone sitting across from you in a coffee shop, eager to share a strange encounter or a heartfelt conversation they stumbled into. You’ll find playful articles like the drugged-out motorcycle ride with a man claiming to be Jesus alongside deeper pieces covering the founders of major organizations. The tone is casual, humorous, and deeply human—reminding everyone that behind the crime, chaos, and grind, this city is full of small stories that deserve to be remembered. Feely Good News frames the city as a place full of life, warmth, and strange beauty.

https://preview.redd.it/sqohvnze024g1.png?width=794&format=png&auto=webp&s=588a69556c651d78e0e494e6704aefb4de5b0b5b

But what truly sets Feely Good News apart is the intention behind the writing. The editor has made it clear that their mission is to chronicle the stories that might otherwise slip through the cracks—the quiet victories, the people who don’t usually make front-page headlines, the fleeting interactions that help define the city’s tone. Feely doesn’t just report on events; he collects snapshots of life. He preserves the parts of the city that rarely get documented anywhere else. And in a city where memory matters, that preservation is powerful.

**The Cardboard Times**, however, offers a sharper, more journalistic voice—so here’s their section written in the exact spirit of editor David O’Malley:

https://preview.redd.it/six96qfc024g1.png?width=419&format=png&auto=webp&s=2197746dc3f9b37dffc399b30290860724b28cbb

""Hello everyone, Dave from The Cardboard Times here.

When I first started reporting in San Andreas, the goal was simple:

Tell the story of the city exactly how it feels to live in it — chaotic, funny, dangerous, heartbreaking, and unforgettable all at once.

Some days we’re covering bank robberies, jailbreaks, and shootouts.

Other days we’re interviewing local business owners, community leaders, or the guy passed out behind Yellow Jack for the third time this week.

We report the moment-to-moment heartbeat of the city because San Andreas never stops moving, and neither do the stories. A chase, a robbery, a riot, a miracle rescue — these things aren’t just one-off RP moments. They’re living history, shaping the world our characters live in.

At The Cardboard Times, we document all of it so nothing gets lost.

When characters leave, retire, die, or disappear — the stories remain.

That’s the magic of in-city journalism: we preserve the world we’re all building together.

Our style is more journalistic — structured, detailed, and aimed at giving citizens a clear picture of what’s happening around them. I think that pairs beautifully with Feely Good News’ more personal, narrative storytelling. Together, we capture two sides of the same city:

the reporting of events as they happen

and the stories of the people who live them

If you’re reading this and want to be part of a server where your actions matter, where your character’s story gets remembered, and where the city feels alive — come visit us in San Andreas. Your story might be the next one we tell.""

ARTICLE FROM THE CARDBOARD TIMES - 

https://preview.redd.it/okc7uvss124g1.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6c42a3af0f3aa117577174cbd28cc442fbee1a3

Former LSPD Lieutenant Engages in Sniper Rampage Downtown

A shocking incident unfolded near Legion Square when former LSPD Lieutenant Freddy Martinez opened fire from the rooftop of a downtown building, targeting civilians and law enforcement officers.

Martinez, who retired from the Los Santos Police Department on October 10th after two years of service, was found wearing an LSPD uniform during the attack. Before the incident, Martinez posted several alarming messages on social media, declaring he was “coked up and ready to end it” with the hashtag #SNIPEYSNIPEY.

Authorities say the situation began as a routine “person hurt” call before Martinez unexpectedly began firing at anyone in sight. When The Cardboard Times helicopter arrived to cover the developing scene, Martinez allegedly shot the pilot, causing the aircraft to lose control and crash.

LSPD, BCSO, and SAFR quickly mobilized to contain the threat. Multiple officers and civilians were injured in the chaos, but officials confirmed that all are expected to recover thanks to the rapid response of emergency personnel.

A member of the LSPD SWAT team located Martinez on a nearby rooftop and engaged him, striking him and ending the standoff. Martinez was transported to the hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.

Investigators reported finding a significant quantity of cocaine in his possession, though the motive remains unclear. According to LSPD command staff, there had been no prior disciplinary issues or indications of instability during his tenure.

In a statement, the LSPD praised the coordination between all responding agencies, including San Andreas Fire Rescue and the Blaine County Sheriff’s Office, for their professionalism and teamwork under extreme circumstances.

This event serves as a somber reminder that even those once sworn to protect can fall into darkness, and how vital cooperation across departments is in keeping San Andreas safe.

Despite their radically different tones, Feely Good News and The Cardboard Times form a kind of unofficial partnership—two halves of the same editorial heartbeat. Freely tells stories from the sidewalk level, capturing conversations, curiosities, and the small moments that define life in the city. The Cardboard Times documents the broader movements, the consequences, the history in motion. One leans into emotion, the other into accuracy, but both capture truth. Together they create a dual record that no single publication could handle alone. Citizens turn to Freely when they want to feel connected, and to The Cardboard Times when they want to understand the world around them. Different voices, different methods, same commitment: preserving the real news from within the city, as it happens and as it matters.

https://preview.redd.it/f0w95bdc224g1.png?width=1675&format=png&auto=webp&s=a317df3ca6c1169a3ea4d5199bc9b051046c0555

And while the reporting is serious, the city’s community is anything but cold. It’s one of the most welcoming spaces you’ll find, open to roleplayers of every experience level—from brand-new players just learning the ropes to seasoned veterans with years of character backstories behind them. New arrivals are met with guidance rather than gatekeeping, and long-time residents are encouraged to carve out their own legacies without stepping on others. The community thrives on collaboration, creativity, and shared storytelling, offering a safe space for people to experiment, grow, and become part of something bigger than just another RP session. Whether you’re developing your first character or your fiftieth, the city has room for you—and a future that you can help shape.
