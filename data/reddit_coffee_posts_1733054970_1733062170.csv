It consists of three parts: the plunger, the tube chamber, and the sieve cap. It is made of high-quality plastic and food-grade rubber. 

To use it, just place a filter paper on the sieve cap, twist the cap onto the tube, and then place it on a mug. Next, pour ground coffee into the tube followed by some hot water. Stir a bit and wait for a minute. Finally, place the plunger in the tube and press down steadily and you will have a cup of delicious coffee. 

To clean it, just twist off the cap, and pop the dry coffee grounds “cake” along with the filter paper into the trash. Rinse all parts, and it’s done. Despite its simplicity, it makes exceptionally good coffee. I highly recommend it.",1,1733061819.0,WriteStreakEN,1,1.0,False

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

The second time I was written up because I wasn't working as fast as the manager wanted me to. She likes to see times of 2.5 minutes, and my times were at 2 minutes and 40 seconds. She said she was writing me up due to poor performance. She said that after 5 days I should be able to open shop and run it by myself, I didn't chat people up at the window enough, and I made drinks with not enough sense of urgency. She said she wanted me to feel stressed in the environment.  I would have liked the job just fine had the manager not been a tyrant. Was this a one off experience?

1h43nwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArmyOCS/comments/1h43nwu/my_ocs_experience_by_the_week/,MY OCS EXPERIENCE BY THE WEEK!,"OCS By The Week

Hey all, I’m going to do a week by week breakdown of everything you do while at OCS, from signing in all the way down to graduation. I’m not one to take up your time too much, but I will be as detailed as I can be so you have an idea of what you are getting into. 

First off, I wanted to say congrats on starting your journey to become an 2LT. Whether you are In-Service, Prior Service, or an O9S like me, I’m rooting for you even though I don’t know you. 

Disclaimer: Everyone’s experience will vary based off of Cadre. The in-service candidates hated how unorganized the whole experience was. I really loved it, it was unorganized, but it wasn’t anything I really didn’t experience at basic. The one thing I did experience that I hated there was the real favoritism that cadre has amongst candidates. We had one guy fall out of the 6 mile because he put 90 pounds in his ruck rather than 35 and he got a spot report and continued on. We had another just not do the ruck and continue with us. Then we had one guy who couldn’t climb a rope and got recycled on Bolton, while he failed out by failing 3 additional obstacles, they all included a rope, which is just odd to me.

I was with 2nd Platoon 007-24 Charlie Co. ICE IN MY HOIST!

Week 1 of OCS
Prior to week one you are going to have to sign in at some point during the weekend. If you are coming from BCT on GOV, you just go and listen so that’s easy. I did POV and I will make it clear…once you sign in, you are not allowed to leave. If your orders say to arrive the next day, don’t panic if you don’t want to. I didn’t, even though they said I was supposed to sign in the day after graduation from BCT. I wanted to enjoy time with my family so I chose to sign in on Sunday at 0900. I could’ve done it later, no matter what the cadre tells your fellow BCT graduates, you don’t have to be there technically until 11:59P the Sunday before class starts. Don’t wait that long, but definitely wait until Sunday. Nothing happens if you’re late so don’t worry. My Cadre also told me that they changed the OCS SOP to display that on orders going forward, but it’s not in the SOP as of now. Nothing is going to happen if you go Sunday, Saturday, or Friday, the bottom line is just to go.

Okay so now onward to week 1. 

We started our experience here by doing an ACFT to “class up” from Gold Phase to Black Phase. The packing list instructs you to buy 2 gold O.C.S. plates…DON’T. Gold Phase is where you just have to pass an ACFT and a long 1:20 workout on day 4 to class up. You’ll wear the gold plates from day 1 until the morning of day 4 when you go to Black Phase with the ascots. After we completed the ACFT we were marched to the DFAC and explained the rules they have which are VERY chill compared to BCT. The only difference is, is that before you eat every day you have to do 30 pushups and 30 air squats or another exercise of the Student 1SG’s choosing. They also explain that you run everywhere inside the OCS Footprint while you are attending OCS, and to be honest, you actually do run everywhere. Be ready to run, some people barely passed the ACFT, which I thought was wild. We did end up losing 1 person because they failed it though.  After that we didn’t really do much, but were forced to stay up until 10:00P, so onwards to day 2. Wake up is at 3:30 so be sure to shave the night before to get some sleep. We ran to the TAPC gym which is basically just a college gym without the indoor track. It’s nice, but they make us run there at a super fast 10mph pace and it’s about a 3/4 mile from the footprint. Then after that we went to chow and they showed us our classroom. Pretty basic classes after that, SHARP and things of that nature. Then lunch, then more classes, then dinner and back to the barracks. After that you are released to your rooms after they collect your phones. They will keep them through all of black phase until Week 5, so be prepared and aware for your 2-sign in verification emails and websites etc. Again, you aren’t allowed to sleep until 2200, but what me and my roomies did was let 2 sleep while the other stayed up. It’s a great way to be sure you’re only restless 1-2 days a week lol. Day 3 is an early wake up, same as before for the most part so nothing to write about here. ONE THING TO NOTE THOUGH ON HOW TO SET UP YOUR ROOM. IF YOU DON’T ASK ABOUT HOW SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE, THEY WON’T HOLD IT AGAINST YOU, SO TELL YOUR FELLOW OC’S TO STFU AND NOT ASK ABOUT HOW TO SET UP THE ROOM. Day 4 is when you do basically an easier version of NIC at night, except at 330 in the morning. You go until sunrise to be honest. You don’t really get breaks, but by the time you are finished at 5 the sun is up. It’s just tire flips, rope climbs, and jumping over 4 ft. walls (if my 5’3 135lb ass can do it, so can you!). The hardest part is the 100 yard low crawl you end it with. Low crawling sucks, but again, there’s an end so just keep going. After it’s over they finally phase you up and you dawn your black ascots. They go hard for about a day, then you realize how much they suck. Day 5 is when they issue you your laptop and other miscellaneous things like the history textbooks and what not. Day 6 is very chill and the same for day 7 so there isn’t really much to say other than you sweat a lot and are given a lot of free time, use it to workout, run, or go to church!

Week 2 & 3
During these weeks it’s all history and it’s true what they say, it’s like getting water through a fire hose with the amount of info they give you in a short timespan. It’s 8 days usually covering 1 lesson per day and each lesson is about 200+ slides. The classes fell during a holiday so we didn’t have class for 1 day. During week 3, the day before the test we did our 6 mile ruck. If you are short like me, it’s kind of fast paced. Just don’t fall out and you won’t have to do it again. The route is all pavement so Oakley’s are probably ideal in terms of boots, but I had Garmonts and don’t plan on changing them. We didn’t do our next ruck until week 9 so you’ll be solid and you’ll have done plenty of rucking by then so don’t fret too much. YOU DON’T GET BREAKS LIKE IN BASIC THOUGH, TACTICALLY ACQUIRE SOME MRE SNACKS IF YOU CAN THE DAY BEFORE. 
Now the dreaded history test. The thing that fails everyone. IT IS NOT HARD. Study the study guide, don’t bother with the “assigned readings” let the sweats do those and talk about them and listen and you’ll be fine. Work with your battle buddies or battle boos and you’ll pass. We supposedly had the lowest fail rate in 10 years and only 21 of 160 had to retake it and they all passed the retest so you’ll be fine. Don’t use the study guides on quizlets, send me a message if you have questions. After you finish the test you go back into classes over land nav to try and prep you for it in week 4 and I’ll go into huge detail to try and help y’all as best as I can and share my experience. I’m not looking forward to it, but here we are…(wrote this sentence while I was there lol)

Week 4
I will start by saying that you either really love land nav or you’re a 4 and done like me. I hated every single moment of land nav during the night. The day isn’t bad, but the night is a whole different beast. During the classroom portion in week 3 they teach you how to shoot a back azimuth and stuff like that. It’s definitely going to help you if you are dead reckoning. Don’t dead reckon unless you are really good at it. We had some guys try it and during the day they usually managed to kind of be close to the point, but during the night, you’ll get lost. Just don’t do it O9S. You’re going to walk a lot. You’re going to be annoyed with each other, and you’re going to be trauma bonding. It’s just how it is. I’ll break it down in terms of experience for you now. 
Day 1. We eat breakfast at the DFAC and then after that get our rucks ready for the busses. It’s about a 35 minute drive to the drop off point and after that you ruck about a half-mile down hill. You’re going to come back up that same hill so rest while you can. After that you are at red-diamond land nav. You’ll be introduced to 2 sides of the map, the “Shield” and the “Pizza”. If you’re lucky all your spots are in the shield, mine weren’t. It’s about 1100 when you are set up and you get MRE’s for lunch. After that you do “Instructor-Led” Land nav. They broke us up into multiple groups, told us to count our steps, and sent us on our way to 3 points. The cadre said they will go to points in order and tell you the order. You can choose to stay with them, but they take forever so I chose to leave with my battle buddy. After you reach point one, you wait for cadre before heading to point 2, then point 3, then head back and eat dinner. It’s usually “Hot A’s” aka “UPU’s” aka “Hot Ass”. It’s honestly not bad and I genuinely enjoyed what they served each day. 
After that they divided us into 2 groups since there wasn’t enough trackers. I was in group 2 which meant I did everything on day 3. We were sent to bed and you basically relax all day for day 2 outside of a buddy team day land nav that was about 3 hours. They do a class on how to take apart and put together the M4, 249, and 240B. You will be tested on and guarding these weapons at night so practice taking them apart and doing function checks when you can. It’s not hard, it’s just another “I need to practice these to succeed” test. On day 2 Group 1 went out to do the night portion land nav while we in group 2 slept. They left at 9P and had until 1A to return. I’d say about 70% passed of the 80 that went out. Then day 3 comes and we started at 7A until 11A, these points aren’t necessarily hard to find, but it’s definitely hard to get all 7 if you aren’t running depending on your lane. I had my 4 at the 1:30 mark and just decided to walk back and was back within 2.5 hours. To give a little more insider on the time it takes to find these points, my roommate passed the pre-test with 4 points in 3.5 hours, and attempted the “regular test” and he got 6 on his new lane while running the whole time in 3 hours. It truly is lane dependent. We had some people come back in 2 hours with all 7. Others, it took almost all 4 hours. There were also some candidates who complained that their lanes had poles without numbers but cadre didn’t believe them. Honestly, I believe that some of the numbers were gone. When do you think is the last time they went out to check all these points? 
Now it’s night land nav for me. I started strong! I had 2 points in like 10 minutes…because they were the same points from earlier lol. I reached point 3 at like the 30 minute mark and felt like I was going for 7. Then I went to the railroad tracks to go along them…I walked, and walked, and walked down my lane to get to the tracks but they never came. I started to panic as 30 minutes passed by and I still hadn’t found them. The tracks were supposed to be about 2 clicks away from my original position so I thought it would take approximately 20 minutes to get there. I decided to back track since I was at the end of hour one and didn’t want to waste time finding point 4 and then head back. I start running because I got in my own head and fell in a muddy area and got super wet. Luckily for my safety 3 Candidates that I had no idea were there rushed to me to ask if I was alright. I told them I was and they were all about to go their own way and then I asked the question that you should definitely NOT ask people you trust at OCS, “What’s your lane?” It turned out we were all on the same lane and we looked at each other with the “who’s going to ask it?” Face. I definitely DID NOT end up asking and we DEFINITELY DID NOT trade points. Eventually, I had my 5 and decided to just head back. I got my points submitted. I made it and so can you! All I will say is “YOU WILL NOT PASS OCS ALONE”. They preach that there. I don’t want to bore you with day 4 and 5 because it was basically us doing nothing but recovering and the people that failed the first night and day retesting. You literally sit around and just eat the MRE’s and Hot A’s when told. We went back on the afternoon of day 5 and it was the nicest shower ever. I knew that, that was the longest I would be in a field setting because of the schedule we had. We ate dinner at the DFAC and they let us chill on the weekend. I went for a run on the weekend and that was about it.

Week 5
It starts off like every week. A company run, however, I noticed after the first 3/4 of a mile we were actually really hauling ass and I thought that most wouldn’t keep up with the speed we were running at. I looked behind me and about half the class fell out and I was technically the last one still in formation. I didn’t like that if I’m being honest, but overheard the cadre say that they had to cut our 3 mile run in half because of some mishap in the accountability. For reference we ran a mile and a half in 9 minutes. 
We then started “kind of” covering OPORD’s. The reason I say kind of is because we had a cadre member present it to us, and tbh either English wasn’t that Sgt.’s first language or he didn’t know how to read. Honestly it was sad seeing him read and present to us in front of higher ranked cadre. He went through 56 slides just saying “okay next slide” without explaining really much. They give you a basic overview then go over the agenda for the weekend. They are going to give you the mission you’ll have to create an OPORD on Saturday and you have until Monday to turn it in. Be as thorough as possible and you’ll be fine. You can use them as notes while you do your presentation in front of the cadre, just don’t sound like a robot. 
We did the branching fair on Tuesday and it’s okay. Since I’m in the Reserves I was already slotted, but the rep for the 88’s didn’t show so I didn’t talk to anyone for 3 hours but my battle buddies. You basically just study for the Phase Up inspection and try and break down weapons to the best of your abilities as quick as you can. Smooth is fast and fast is smooth. PRO TIP: Buy bed stays and save yourself a headache of doing your bed every morning! They won’t check your lockers/closet so long as they are locked. Be sure to have everything locked or you and your roommates are going to have to open everything up. 
During this week, they attempted to revoke our rights to our phones, but the reason was because someone was caught with their phone. Bottom line, if you keep your phone don’t get caught. DON’T BE A BLUE FALCON EITHER! If you see a candidate getting a coffee at church, don’t write their name down to turn in. We had people go up to the snitches and notify them real quick that the staircase is a little slippery. 
We had our 4 mile run this week. By this point you should’ve at least trained once a week by running a 5k to kind of get in the right cardio condition. Personal Tip: I bought Adidas Prime X 2.0’s and believe me they work. I know I could have done it without them as I was doing a 15 minute 2 mile in regular, but I finished my 4 mile in 30 minutes with ease in those because they are so soft and relaxing. My 2 mile in them is 14:18. When I pushed myself later on during the cycle I ran a 28:50 4 mile.

Week 6
During week 6 we presented an OPORD. This was the only class I had to retake. It was mainly because I busted time. Don’t worry too much as you’re going to pass as long as you read off the paper. They don’t care if you sound like a robot, unlike how they preach not too. Cover all your bases by covering the 17-page OPORD and you’ll be fine. I don’t know if it’s true but I heard in the PNN (Private News Network) that Bravo Company had a 5 page OPORD. One thing you start to realize here by week 6 is that 95% of what you hear on the PNN is absolutely false and to figure stuff out for yourself. You are in a room with 1 cadre member and have 30 minutes to present your OPORD. I understand what people mean when they say that it is very cadre dependent as to what grade you get. I went over and instantly was told I failed, my buddy who had the same OPORD as me was with a different cadre member and he scored 100 and he busted time too! There isn’t really anything else but WTBD (Weapons Training) which you will wait in lines for a long time just for a 3-7 minute test, you do that 7 times then you’re done. I promise, if you never messed with a 240B or 249, you will have plenty of time to practice. It took me about 3 times of toying with it to figure it out. You’ll also learn how to put a radio together, but that is the easiest test besides the M4.
I almost forgot, you also do your Battle Analysis during this week. It’s not hard and they make the first paragraph for you already. I wouldn’t study it much, but I would read the document, come up with the test “ahead of time” because you can use your computer the night before, save it to the clipboard and it’s ready to turn in from the moment the test begins. I’m not going to say I did this, because I didn’t. They won’t tell you your grade, but I can tell you this is the most amount of failures. We had 30% of our class fail it, and one failed it a second time and was recycled to Delta supposedly. After that the weekend approached and they gave us a 3 day on-base pass.

Week 7 & 8
AHHHHH STX, THE DREADED STX WEEKS. Honestly, I HATE the outdoors, but it wasn’t that bad outside of the sleeping at night. Depending on your week of going, you are either sleeping one week all day and working the next or vice versa. There are 7 lanes in total, and all seven aren’t hard except Yuma. They are all named after cities in Arizona I think. I had Flagstaff, and luckily for me it was where we slept most nights, so I knew the lane pretty well before starting it. It’s only about a max of 250m to the objective, I had to wait all the way until week 2 of STX before I could go, so I literally did nothing the first week but sleep. When it was time for my squad to go, we had to complete all 13 lanes (so we ran through some lanes twice) in 3 days and let me tell you it’s brutal. We did 1 the first day and then 7 the next and 5 on the last. You are going to be tired, possibly bloodied, and mildly dehydrated, but you will get through it. BIGGEST PIECE OF ADVICE IS TO BUY A POLAROID AT THE PX, TAKE IT WITH YOU AND TAKE SOME PICTURES WHILE YOU’RE WAITING. I am so glad I had mine with me. 
The cadre doesn’t want to be there just like you don’t though, so the sooner you all are done, the sooner you go home. We got home 3 days early and they gave us another on-base pass that we used to reset, recover, and prep for our 9 mile ruck the next week. (I’ll go into a lot of details on my horrible experience later). During your on-base pass, go to the movies, gym, and main PX, but be aware. IDK how but no matter what, if I went to the main PX, I was easily spending a $100. On one particular trip they had a brand new gaming laptop at a $1500 discount over retail. I bought it and I am so happy with my purchase, but this is giving you an example of what to expect when you go. Their discounts are never usually that good, and they literally sold out day one, but I wanted a gaming laptop so dammit I spent $1000 and got one for “work purposes”…Okay, I had Xbox Game Pass and wasn’t going to let that opportunity go to waste. For what it’s worth, I sold the other laptop I had and ended up only spending like $300 on the laptop. We decompressed, went out, and had a good time. Remember, life moves pretty fast, enjoy yourself when you can.

Week 9
This is a week where I had the most fun, but also was the most ugly. I’ll start with the 9 mile ruck. I started strong and went the first 4.5 miles with absolute ease. The pace was good, and I was able to keep up without a problem, then we turned around. I noticed at this time that I wasn’t sweating at all but felt hot (sign 1). I saw an ice immersion, dunked my hands and felt okay again and kept treading along. We then reached a hill at the 6 mile mark (cardiac hill) and I don’t know what it was about that hill, but it completely destroyed me. I was no longer able to keep up with anyone and was almost all the way at the back. I noticed a lot of short people in the back with me as well. My roommate saw I was struggling and decided to stay with me offering water every quarter mile which I would politely decline because I was huffing and puffing. I noticed at the 7.5 mile mark that I couldn’t stand up straight (sign 2). I didn’t care though, I was going to keep pushing until I finished. We get to like the 8.9 mile mark and I noticed I was walking sideways and couldn’t walk straight and I looked at my skin and I was pale (sign 3). I realized I was right there and could literally see the finish line so I pushed all the way through until I couldn’t push anymore. I was having a heat stroke, but I didn’t want to stop. A cadre member yelled at me to stop and I did and didn’t realize what was going on. I passed the finish line and was being dragged by my friends to the stretching point. I passed the rucking finish line right when I was about to become a heat cat! The cadre put 2 ice sheets over my head and said it would be cold. I was so exhausted and breathing so heavily that I didn’t even notice the ice sheets, I just felt wet on my head and it felt good.
They put my hands in an ice tank and told me not to fall or I’d pass out and I listened. My PLT’s head cadre member told me I had to take a test and if I failed I’d be recycled. It was a 3 question test, “What’s your name?” “Where are you?” And “How old are you”. I answered them correctly and they allowed me to stay and was allowed to fall back into formation. Looking back at it, it was technically the hardest test of OCS, but at the time I thought it was the easiest. The cadre told me that I was on the brink of falling, but that I passed and just had to go to my room to recuperate for an hour. My roommate was forced to watch me shower to ensure I didn’t fall, but we just had the restroom door open and I said my name every 30 seconds while I was in there. 
After that, we gladly rested for a bit, then caught up with the rest of the company. I was walking with a limp, but it was more cause of a blister than anything. My feet were surprisingly fine outside of that. I was super scared for the 12 mile coming up the next week, but a little company run the following Monday canceled any fear I had. We turned in our weapons on Wednesday and our NVG’s the same day and got ready for our branching ceremony on Thursday. Thursday arrives and we spent 6 dumb hours practicing the ceremony every minute of that, outside of lunch. I’d say 98% of people got their Top 9 choices, 2 people got below that and 85% I believe got one of their top 5 picks. After the ceremony we got to finally dawn our regular clothes to get ready for the branching social at the IBAR (Infantry Bar). It was a fun experience, however we ran out of food quick and I chose to get a drink over food first and only had the option of chips or air on the food menu. We felt pretty good and it got a little rowdy, but nothing too crazy. 
The next day is a phase up test and you should pass it as long as you use the study guide they give you. They will then give you a pass on the weekend and you’ll be able to relax and get ready for the final week of hard work. On to Week 10!

Week 10-12
It starts out with easy classroom work, nothing too hard, but you have to score an 80 on the leadership exam. I promise you’ll pass, it’s a super easy test and you get the picture of your diploma to kind of motivate you through the rest of the week. I literally hung my “copy of a diploma” on my locker to motivate me for the ruck! I remember in the back of my mind I was worried, but knew that’s all that stood between me and going home! On Monday we did a company run and it was super easy. Around this time you all pretty much know you’re done and hustle through it all. We have some people who would struggle but still made it. 
Day of the Ruck: okay so now it’s about 2:30A, we wake up and get ready to start. We stretch, are given 2 hoist packets, and then get ready in a ruck formation. We start and it’s totally fine. I am thinking “12 miles til I see my family” and notice about mile 2.5 my feet start to blister. I’m like…fuhhhhhh. I’m going to hustle through it and like my sticker patch says “It is what it is”. I keep going, it’s not a normal ruck it feels like because I’m passing people, people are passing me, I’m passing people, people are passing me. it felt weird and off-timed. We get to the turn around point and I start getting passed up…a lot. I was fine, but my feet were starting to hurt a little. I think people knew the turn around point and literally just waited for us to come back to fall back in because I went from like top 10 people in the ruck to like almost dead last. I knew I was slow, but I never felt this slow. We get to about mile 10 and I felt the blister pop and OMG DID IT FREAKING HURT. I was almost to a point where I was wincing in pain. I somehow knew I had to finish it now or I would get recycled. It’s not a matter of who is better, it was more of a matter of who wants it more. I knew nothing was going to stop me from going home so I made it…barely but I made it. I stretched with my platoon and felt a sense of relief so big that I teared up a little bit at the end. Then we went to go shower…I had to walk up the stairs on my tip-toes so I knew something was wrong but didn’t care, I just wanted to recover a little bit. I took off my boots and felt a big deal of pain when I tried to take off my socks. The pain was so much to bare, I bit down on my pillow as I peeled it off, I flipped my socks inside out as it really hurt and saw a bandaid. I thought to myself, “Weird? I don’t remember putting bandaids on this morning” as I always on the prior rucks…it was my skin, I peeled off my literal skin on my feet with the ruck. I don’t know if it was more shock or what, but I was somehow able to shower real quick and put on my PT’s. I called my PLT Ldr and told him how I couldn’t really walk and he called a cadre member and the cadre member just said “GNARLY DOG” and called up a vehicle to take me to the hospital. I literally had to be carried downstairs but was able to walk on my tip-toes on flat surfaces so I went with my roommate to the hospital and they gave me some bandages and crutches. I was on crutches for about a week before I was able to walk/run again. I got absolutely annihilated on that ruck, but if I could do it, so can you!

We went on our 4-mile, then went on a ride-along at a civil war prison camp site. It was fun, but just another thing to get through. The day before graduation we had to practice for about 5 hours then were released to our families for an off-base pass. It was super chill and nice to know, I’m headed home!

After that it was pretty easy. I didn’t come in last in my class, I beat about 40 people, but I can also say I never really tried too hard either. If you’re active, go balls to the wall on the physical aspect, if you’re reserve, just get it done. If you’re NG, don’t worry you’ll get what you want. If you got this far, I’m sure you’ll be fine on your journey to becoming an O! If you have any questions feel free to message me, if you have any worries let me know, just know that there is an end to it all, and you’ll be fine.

I showed her pictures to my family with the intention to get their approval to pursue her. I did this after I had to break up with my ex when my family asked me to leave her or leave the house. The reason - she wasn't pretty conventionally, and too modern for my family. This should tell you how conservative my family is.

Now, they've found her to be super pretty, which is a nice seal of approval. The issue is, even though I've talked to R a lot, I haven't explicitly said I like her and want to know more about her with the intention to hopefully marrying her one day. 

We are planning to meet sometime, and I'll have to travel 100km to see her. I want to know if I should seek permission from my family or not meet her at all? I'm worried that they'll think poorly of her if she were to meet me, you know, like how can she meet a strange man.

Third option is lying about it - I tell them that I'm going to meet other friends, and go meet her instead. I'm not okay with doing this. I don't ever lie, and I am a terrible liar.

So, should I 
1. Tell her I'm interested in her?
2. That I've shared her pictures with my family?
3. Meet her or not?

I’m not perfect at it, but I’ve seen the difference. Every time I eat sugary foods, it’s like a fire lights up in my lower back, right where my disc trouble is. It’s a painful reminder that my body needs me to do better.

An anti-inflammatory diet is the key, guys. It’s not just something to read about—it’s something to start practicing today. Slowly but surely, I’ve been replacing coffee with green tea or ginger tea. The warmth calms me, and I know it’s helping my system heal instead of making things worse.

Sugar had to go. It’s tough, I know, but every time I cut it out, I feel the relief. Greens and vegetables are my new staples—spinach, broccoli, and all those vibrant foods. They fuel my body in ways pizza never could. Speaking of pizza, I’ve had to say goodbye to processed foods like that. It’s hard at first, but the trade-off is worth it when your body feels lighter, calmer, and stronger.

Staying hydrated has been a game-changer too. I carry a water bottle everywhere now. It’s a small habit, but it makes a huge difference in how my body feels. And let’s talk about fat—it’s not the enemy. Healthy fats like avocado and olive oil have been my go-to for reducing inflammation naturally.

This isn’t just about diet; it’s about helping your body help you. When I stay consistent, I notice my pain subsides, my energy improves, and even my weight starts to drop. Less weight means less pressure on my discs, which is exactly what I need.

I’m not perfect at this—I slip up, but I get back on track because I’ve seen what happens when I don’t. Start small, start where you can, but start. Calm your system after every workout, feed your muscles with the right foods, and give your body a chance to heal. You’ll feel the difference I promise.🙌

I'm looking for someone to play coop games with (we were here, it takes two, ...) or any other kind of multiplayer games. I find that it's a great way to break the ice and get to know each other slowly while playing together. For now I'm mostly looking for friendship but I'm not opposed for it to develop into something more if the feelings are there (and if we're able to work together in a coop game, there's a good chance we might make a relationship work, no ?).  It would be best if you live in Europe in order to avoid struggling with time zones. I'm open to meet and  have a drink/meal together if we live close to each other. I'm also looking to travel to another country sometimes next year so if you live in an interesting place to visit that might be a good occasion to meet in the future. 

Here's some info about me :

I'm 29, I live in France near Paris. I work as a software developer. Appearance side, I have brown eyes and hair. 

I like videos games, mostly RPG and indie games but also coop games and multiplayer ones (what a surprise, right ?). I like reading and tabletop RPG.

I'm practicing martial arts, a bit of bouldering and running with my colleagues (I'm participating to some running events throughout the year to motivate myself to continue). 

I tend to be more of a homebody as I like to stay at home chilling especially during winter where I can be comfy watching TV with a plaid and some coffee. But I also like from time to time to move outside to see a friend or all other kind of occasion. 

I really like animals, even though I don't have any at the moment so feel free to send me a pic of your pet if you have any.

I’m an over thinker and I get overwhelmed with uncertainty. For this past year starting last January I started a new job and slowly grew a crush on my one coworker male (32) (I do realize the age gap but I’ve always been attracted to older guys and I honestly thought he was 25 at first) as we’ve gotten to know each other and become really good friends I’ve watched him grow from being incredibly shy, almost never talking and seeming cold and awkward to mostly around me being very talkative, silly, and even coping a lot of the things I do like little dances and such (we work in the cold so I try to move around for warmth) and things I say. we every once and awhile go to Tim’s for coffee at first we would take turns on who pays but now he refuses to let me pay, he doesn’t get upset when I make him stay longer then he was supposed to when he drops me off after work and even says it’s “ok” “I don’t mind” and smiles. Last time I asked if we could take a picture together and he said yes after I promised I wouldn’t share the picture with anyone because he hates getting his picture taken, we even got one another gifts on our birthdays which surprised me as he said “ I only care about my families birthdays I don’t care about mine or anyone else’s.” He sometimes tells me when he goes to the bathroom and if he peed or something upset his stomach as he’s lactose intolerant but loves dairy lol, and oddly sometimes breathing very heavily around me and gets nervous and awkward only in the car when driving me home, but I thinks that’s because he’s incredibly shy (I’d like to understand why he does that if it’s not just because of shyness) Are these all good signs he likes me or does he just see me as a really good friend? I know I seem really dumb for asking because I should know but I don’t take hints well and I don’t trust very easily, I think it’s easier to grow an opinion if other tell me what they would do if they where shy and liked a girl and such, so please let me know even though I seem silly ",2,1733060523.0,AskMenAdvice,4,1.0,False

# TLDR; I do a brainless manual-transaction stupid strategy that earns $100+ every day for months now.



Context (copied and revised from my last post):.



* For the last several months I’ve been implementing a strategy and I’ve finally got it down well. I look for pretty low to mid volume stocks at various price ranges ($4 to $70). It involves a TON of manual trades (1000+ a day) and it’s a lot of work, often in small batches. **Sounds easy but the devil is in the details--the specific stocks, the brokerage, the timing, the amounts, all the keys to success that I'm most definitely not sharing took months to figure out.**  



* I can enact buy/sell transactions between the bid and the ask. These transactions are basically a market maker inside the existing market maker current bids and asks. I think some market makers' orders get stale or outdated or something. Buy at a variable place, between bid and ask, and sell for a TINY bit higher, repeat. I don’t know exactly how it works, or why it works, but it does. I only do a certain amount per day, and call it a day after that.  



* In short, it's a manual-transaction heavy strategy on mid to low-volume stocks that is basically acting as a market maker within the current market maker parameters. This strategy is not sustainable or scalable and I fully expect my brokerage to shut me down at some point.



# Questions / Comments:



# tHeRe's nO WaY yOu'Re gEtTinG 40%+ iN a mOnTh!  

the strategy is really on a per-hour basis. **It's not scalable**. I would be making the same on a $5K account or a $5 million account. (Anybody wanna lend me a $5 million account?) Also, I got banned from another brokerage doing a similar but more aggressive strategy, RIP, so who knows, I might get banned any day.



# How long does it take?  

1-2 hours per day.  



# How many trades do you do?  

1,000-1,500.  



# Indicators, strategies, timeframes, etc.?  

They just don't apply  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  just my trusty trading ladder. And, of course, a daily scan to look at bid, ask, volume. It's very.... unsophisticated lol.  



# ""You're collecting pennies in front of a steamroller""  

nope. Worst case scenario happened in October and a trade turned against me, lost $100 in minutes. Recovered it the rest of the day. That was like a 1/1000 case.  



# How do you like your coffee?

two stevias and oatmilk :) thank you.



# Can you tell us your ticker symbols?

I could tell you, but... the very essence of humanity may collapse upon itself. It's dramatic stuff. Everybody knows AAPL, TSLA, those are the top .01%. There are thousands of other unknown bottom 30-40% of companies that don't get much love. I give them a bit of attention <3. Aren't I the nicest?  



# What brokerage?

Schwab and thinkorswim. $0 commission, \~$0.50 in FINRA fees per day. They're payment for order flow (PFOF) so they do be making money from my excessive trades lol. 



# Why not automate?

It's like, well, I could design a robot to make oatmeal for me every day, but I'll just skip all that work and instead do it myself. I don't mind doing 'water torture', as another commenter graciously said, for 1-2 hours a day for $100+. Put on a podcast and do some other stock stuff on the side too. Not bad. 



# What are your taxes going to look like?

A CVS receipt. This'll be the first year in which I anticipate we'll owe a few thousand from the capital gains around 25%, but we're prepared.  



# If you make x amount of money per day, could it be more?

yes, actually, I could make more. I don't want burnout. The brokerage software gets SLOW AF after an hour or so. Also, I don't want to draw any more attention to my account (... I say while making a post about it).



# Proof?

I'm happy to share any sauce as needed.



# BONUS: what's your quest, bro?

... as if anybody cares. Well, thanks for asking, self. I was inspired by u/cuinlumby. We both clearly had a... obsession, for market making. We both also started from RuneScape and would buy and sell on a marketplace called the Grand Exchange. I liked the ones where you made a small amount of coins on a large trade. 10 coins isn't much for one transaction, but it's a lot if you do 10,000. Economies of scale, like McDonald's making $.30 off every burger, but they make so much in total.  

u/cuinlumby did a revolutionary post a few years ago. It literally kept me up at night. He made consistent money on Robinhood options, basically market making, thousands of dollars per month, easy, but also manual. His graph was smoother than my brain. Unfortunately, Robinhood said it was a big ""no-no"" because he exceeded the 390 options orders per day rule. RIP. I really wanna hear from you if you're still out there and what you're doing because you're a mad lad!  

Inspired, and realizing that it can be done, my hunt began 6 months ago. Just looking for anything resembling market making in stocks that would make a penny, literally even a penny, but I could do it consistently. Imagine the excitement when I found out, wow, actually, some stocks let me do it! If I can make one penny, then I can make *Dr. Evil voice* ""**one million dollars""**. Adjusted, tailored, failed, adapted, overcame, and finally we're here. *Now I sing DJ Khaled's ""All I do is win win win no matter what"" while my butler prepares my shower that spits out dollar bills so I can shower in money.*  

Thanks for listening to my TED talk, most of this written at 3am when I couldn't sleep. Best of luck to all!

The walk back home was somber. He had hoped to make peace with his departure, to say goodbye to his home and leave without regret. But the sweet he had hoped for only turned bitter. He took off his jacket and immediately went upstairs to bury his feelings by turning on the Switch to play Mario Party solo against bots as he usually did any time he needed a break from the outside world. With his dad gone, he had no one to really play with, and with time, playing this party game alone became his own little oasis. The rest of the afternoon passed like water through a sieve. He won some games, lost some to the legendary Hard DK. The domestic doldrum. The thickness of the bog. Mind-numbing. Comfortable.

This droning banality got broken up by an intrusion in the Duchamp's peaceful household. A knock on the door. The housemother went to open.

*""Pardon my intrusion.""* Satoshi's voice, in perfect French. Not a twinge of accent. Léandre got up, running to the top of the stairs in order to surreptitiously spy on the first floor's happenings from the top of the staircase. Small talk, at first. Hope you found your way here easy. Don't worry it went fine, yadda yadda. From up there, he couldn't really see anything, he could only hear. Satoshi being polite, his mom being a good host, nothing really that juicy.

He crept downstairs, just enough to have a line of sight to the living room table where Satoshi was seated, alone, the big box resting near the door. Why on Earth did he bring that thing with him ? It's so extremely suspicious on its own ! Not to mention he himself looked like a vagrant with his oversized pants and hooligan jacket... His mother had gone to make some coffee for their guest. Very amenable lady. Satoshi glanced up at Léandre. His heart skipped a bit but the man didn't make more of a case of his presence. Don't know why he would, on second thought. He was just nervous... His mom returned, bearing two cups of coffee.

*""- I must apologize again, Mrs. Duchamp, for how little in advance we were able to contact you. Our internet was down for a few weeks. Bad winds. It's unstable up there. We emailed you as soon as we could.*  
*- It's alright. It's also my fault. Your mail was there, I just happened to miss it. You were, however, strangely short on words. I'm not entirely sure what you want with my son.*  
*- Did Léandre not tell you ?* Answered Satoshi in a dead voice, doing a very poor job at selling his fake surprise.  
*- Tell me what ?*  
*- He passed a test at school a couple of months ago. He should have learned his admittance at our establishment only a little later. That is no excuse on our part, of course.""*

Mrs. Duchamp sighed and called for her offspring to come join them. Léandre waited a little bit to feign that he had been in his room the whole time and came down the stairs.

*""- What's up ?""*

Doing his best to sell whatever bit Satoshi was going for, he stared at him as he went to sit by his mother's side, signaling that he had never seen this man in his life, pinky swear !

*""- Why didn't you tell me about this test you passed ?*  
*- What test ?* He answered while giving a side-eye to his would-be teacher, resenting that he should be actively implicated in the deception without even the kindness of a briefing.  
*- The aptitude test.* Said Satoshi. *It was sent to some select school across the country. You should have underwent it about two and a half months ago.*  
*- Oh ! Right... That test. Sorry, mom. I just, uh... completely forgot.""*

She sighed. It wasn't the first time something like that had happened. Airheaded as he always had been, he often forgot to tell her about important matters, especially related to school. His teacher asking to see her, school needing some paper or another, field trips asking for parental supervision. Always on a deadline, of course. She had never really gotten used to it, routinely bemoaning her son's lack of focus, but it would have been improper to go into that now in front of a stranger.

As if to bail him out, Satoshi produced from a very professional, pristine looking leather briefcase he had bought a couple hours prior a very simple folder. It looked like the ones Léandre had himself used to carry around random bits of paper for school. It was blue, with no discerning characteristics whatsoever. He looked at the man, frankly appalled. He could have tried to make it look a little fancier, at least ! His disbelief only grew when she opened it, revealing... Perfectly blank sheets of paper, straight off the store.

His heart sank, his eyes grew wide. He looked at his mom, worried she was going to lose her temper and throw the man out of her house. She would have been justified. But while her brow \*did\* furrow, she only took the first page out, set it to the side and started... reading the rest ? Her eyes were going over the white pages as if they had been covered in writing. Léandre looked up at the man, looking at him. He winked, his face otherwise perfectly still. Was that supposed to be reassuring ? And seriously, would it have killed him to get him up to speed before putting out this charade ? Wait... Was the man making this up as he went ? Did he cast a spell on his mom ? This whole thing was getting freakier by the minute.

Time stood still for a good long while, Mrs. Duchamp painstakingly going over every line of invisible text, only stopping to take a sip of coffee or ask Satoshi clarifying questions that he answered without missing a bit. Mind you, Léandre still had absolutely zero clue as to what the man's gambit was. How would an email and an empty folder persuade her very Jewish mom from letting go of her only son ? As she was asking questions after questions, he managed to piece something together.

Apparently, Satoshi was posing as the representative for some sort of posh school in Andorra, a city state between France and Spain mostly known for being the place to go to buy cheap cigarettes by the box. He should have put it in Monaco. That, at least, had fancy mystique.

After reading the entire file twice over and bombarding the man with even more questions, she put the empty papers back in the default folder and took her son aside in the kitchen. She stayed silent for a instant, occupying her hands by fiddling with the coffee machine. She looked uneasy.

*""- Do you want to go there ?*  
*- Hum... yes ?""* He said flatly, taken aback by the directness of the question. He wasn't even sure there was a ""there"" to speak of.  
*""- I'd never thought you would ever want to go to a foreign private school.*  
*- Foreign, foreign... They speak French there and it's just on the other side of the border, y'know.*  
*- Yes, I do, we went there with your cousin once.""* She answered, her tone a little harsh at the implication *she* could have forgotten it. She sighed and got put her hand on his shoulder with a tender, worried little smile. *""It's just... This is highly irregular. I miss a mail a week ago, which never happens, and now this Asian... muscle-man dressed like the the ace of spades comes to convince me to give my son away... And you... You don't look very happy about any of this either...*  
*- Mom...*  
*- I know it's been hard, recently. I know you haven't been feeling well, I know about your night-time escapades, and it's... fine, really, that's what you need to do, and I know you got something against Daniel -*  
*- I don't really hate him ! He's just... a little extreme, is all.* Daniel, Léandre's stepdad, was more religious than either of them, to a worrying degree for a teenager overprotective of his mother.  
*- Don't worry, it's not tomorrow a man will put me in a wig !* She said with a sly chuckle, caressing his cheek. He smiled back.  
*- Yeah, I know...*  
*- Look, I just don't want for this to be an escape. It's a big decision, Andorra is like... 600 km away ! If things are that bad here, you can talk to me, we can seek council, I won't ask you to go to the rabbi again, I promise, but this is all -*  
*- Mom. I want this. This is what I need to do.""* Léandre's tone surprised even himself. He was firm. Resolute. That rarely happened when he was arguing with her. She had always been the one in the 'right', whether she actually were or not. A strong woman. A rock and a tidal wave all at once. The kind of mother a son can hardly go against. Overbearing, yes, but always well meaning. In a different scenario, he could have seen her being right here once again. That this wasn't the right path. Let's be honest, this was all a little crazy. But not now. For once, he knew more than her The mangled skull. Satoshi's warning. *""If I don't go, I won't ever amount to anything.""* He himself wasn't entirely sure what he meant by this. He wasn't lying. It was a truth that came from a place so deep within himself it was out of reach even for him.  
*""- Hey, don't say that... You're a bright kid, you got your life ahead of you. Hell, you haven't even graduated or gotten a girlfriend, yet !*  
*- Moooom...* The boy whined. She threw her hands up.  
*- Or a boyfriend ! I won't judge.*  
*- Mom !*  
*- Alright, alright...""*

She sighed and started slowly pacing around the kitchen, her hands on her lower back. She was thinking. Unsure where to put himself, Léandre sought refuge in the fridge and a bottle of soda. Satoshi hadn't said a thing this entire time. It was slightly surprising to him that he would allow them this time together. From their limited interaction, he had seemed a fairly forceful man, and he could absolutely picture him trying to strike will the iron's hot, as it were... After a quarter bottle downed, Mrs. Duchamp spoke.

*""- Alright. You can go.*  
*- Thanks, mom.""* He smiled. It wasn't until this moment, until he received his mother's blessing, allowing for the possibility of his departure to become real, that he realized that yes, this is indeed what he wanted. To get out of here, go travel to wherever, around the world maybe, find himself, have some romantic, poetic journey of self-discovery or something. It sent his heart aflutter. And then the second shoe dropped.  
*""- However, I have my conditions.*  
*- OhGod.*  
*- I want you back home for Hanukah, for the new year and for your birthday. I want you to keep in touch. You don't wait for me to call you, you call me, okay ?*  
*- UhYeahSure.*  
*- And even if you don't read it, you take a Torah with you. You never know when you might want to seek guidance.*  
*- OkayMomIpromise.*  
*- Good.* She mellowed down a little. *I hope you'll find what you're looking for out here. Personally, I don't think a change of scenery is going to make you feel better about life in general but -*  
*- I love you, mom.""* It wasn't said to shut her up. It wasn't intently manipulative. It's just what he felt in the moment. It was a big change. She would have had every right to buck, grab Satoshi by his oversized pants and undone collar and toss his out of her home along with the garbage. But she didn't. She was making an effort, going against her overprotective instinct. Bucking the trend. Maybe she didn't even realize that. Maybe he was the only one who could. But he did. And those were the only words he could find to express his appreciation.  
*""- I love you too.""* She closed the distance and embraced him. He embraced her in turn. The last bit of tenderness a mother and her son would share for months. They used to be so close. Getting that closeness back, if only for a moment, was a balm for the both of them. He let her go before she did.

They stepped out of the kitchen. Satoshi was still there, at the table, immobile. He looked like a wax statue until he turned his head to look at them. He didn't say a word. He probably didn't need to. Maybe he heard it all.

She sat back down. Léandre skedaddled, going back upstairs to finish packing his bags. He could figure what the end of this conversation was gonna be like. His mom repeating the same demands he made him, his future teacher agreeing with a robotic tone, them hammering down the specific... Tonight, he was gone. That was the only thing that mattered to him.

*""- I want him back for his birthday.*  
*- Which calendar ?*  
*- Lunar is fine.""*

His hiking backpack was at his dad's, so he had to make do with his schoolbag. He unceremoniously shook it empty over his bed, scattering around trinkets of a future past life. Warm clothes, light clothes, toothbrush, phone charger. He slanged the bag on his back, passed in front of the upstairs games room. Stopped. Pondered a moment. And with a snicker, decided to take the Switch with him. Suck it, Daniel... They were the only ones in this household to use the damn thing anyway. As he was pushing the cables in, trying to zip his bulging back shut, Satoshi called from downstairs. \*""The train is leaving soon, do please hurry.""\* He hurried up. As he ran downstairs, the two adults in the room were arguing over the urgency of the men's departure. Satoshi won that argument. Léandre felt a little sad for his mom. She just wanted him home a bit more. He would have argued for her, but he couldn't wait anymore. The new dawn was pulling at him, drawing him like a magnet towards tomorrow.

The sun was starting to set, Autumn's schedule as implacable to daylight as it had ever been, when Mrs. Duchamp opened the door, letting cold air in her domicile. She shivered. Satoshi and her shook hands. He thanked her. He stepped outside. She kissed her son. Her son kissed her. He thanked her. He stepped outside. She looked at him, shoulders low, a tired look on her face, forcing a smile.

*""- Mazel Tov, mon fils.*

Satoshi bowed, Léandre waved, Myriam waved back, and they walked away. Léandre could feel his home becoming smaller and smaller behind him. Soon, home would be only a memory. Despite the promises made by both he and the stone man that now served as his mentor, the future was uncertain. When would he be back ? How much would he have changed, then ? If yesterday night was any standard, would he even be whole ? Would the next time she saw him be in a box ? The thought of her sorrow alone tore a hole in his heart. He spun around, walking backwards towards his future, looking back towards his past. A minute ago, it was still his present. She was still in the doorframe, watching them disappear, pulling the collar of her sweater up to cover her neck. Poor woman, he thought, as the door closed on his domestic life. Forever.

Also, if I show up too late in the morning I get burnt coffee. Both of these problems can be solved by lowering the heat at which the burners are maintained, And also lowering the temperature of the water as it brews.

1h43eyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1h43eyo/my_22m_familys_status_makes_me_feel_like_a_burden/,My (22M) family’s status makes me feel like a burden on my girlfriend,"I want to start by saying that I love my girlfriend and that the way I’ve been feeling has not been brought on by her. In fact, whenever I have major moments of insecurity around this, she’s always there to support me. She’s great, but at the same time I feel like her being great makes the problem worse because it makes me feel even worse about it. For reference, we’ve been together for 6 years, and this problematic thinking started more recently, as after 5ish years we started talking more about the future.

Anyways, my family is pretty low-income. My mother is a stay-at-home mom and my dad works. He used to work a better job, started gambling and drinking, lost everything and now works long hours but makes a pretty low wage. I don’t resent him anymore for how stuff turned out, but my family situation is pretty rough to say the least. He’s pretty much been exiled to the basement by my mom. 

Without getting into too much detail, financially, my family pretty much lives paycheck to paycheck. My sister often needs to pitch in to help meet rent. I’m a student (was able to be achieved without debt through my dad putting in some extra hours which I’m extremely thankful for and scholarships + lower tuition in Canada) and my mom insists that I shouldn’t try to pitch in until I get a full-time job. Relationship wise, my mom is close with my sister, my dad is seen as “the problem” by my mom and sister (which is stupid to me), and I’m sort of just silent about it because I don’t want to be shunned like my dad.

We have no car, my parents don’t really have savings, we rent our house and we have many problems from mold in the bathroom (which causes a lot of stress to me as I have a lot of health anxiety) to a lack of an oven. On top of this, my family is terrible with money. My mom insists on buying and only drinking bottled water and constantly orders food rather than cooking (3/4 meals recently have been ordered, I can’t think of the last time there was a day where no money was wasted on Doordash). We have a perfectly fine coffee-maker yet she’ll still get coffee delivered almost every day. These choices are as damaging to our health as they are to our finances, yet whenever I try to bring it up, my mom and sister tell me I’m being ridiculous and I need to stop worrying so much.

So in all, bad financially,my family members are rather distant and resentful towards each other, and the decision-making (in both health and wealth) in my family is terrible and makes this whole thing worse. 

On the other hand, my girlfriend’s family is pretty well off. They own their house, her mom’s also a stay-at-home mom but her dad makes well above a living wage. They have savings, they spend their money well and they’re all close to each other (for the most part). Whenever I visit, it feels like a qualitatively different experience of what a “family” is. 

Why is this a problem? Smaller reason, her mom finds my neighbourhood unsafe (it’s not but she has that notion). Whenever her parents hear anything about my living situation she gets rather judgemental (rightfully so I guess) and I always feel like they take it to be a reflection of me. Earlier on in the relationship, her mother didn’t really approve of me and my family situation was part of the reason. The larger reason is my own perception though. Whenever she comes over and gets either an ordered-out or half-assed meal or she has to use our moldy bathroom, I just feel bad. On top of this, I know that if we get married, she’ll be so financially prepared, so it will likely be a situation where her side of the family contributes so much and my side can’t. I also always worry that I’ll end up like my parents because it’s how I grew up. 

Anyways this was just a rant. Thank you for reading. Before anyone asks why I don’t just cook, I have a many times, but I’m constantly met with criticism about taking too long which makes it a terrible experience and my mom refuses to help me learn so I’m trying but it’s hard. I probably won’t be the person who cooks most days until I move out (which will probably be a while looking at Canadian living costs and the amount of school required for what I want to do).",1,1733060148.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Knei team is online. We are coming back to introduce [Knei update 1.6](https://app.knei.space/connections): One line for your talk notes! 

Remember the ""multi-talk notes"" feature we released some time ago? Maybe yes, maybe not, but anyway. The feature used a large language model (ChatGPT-like) to identify the people and events in the text.

In this update, we made a simple interface for it: one-line input at the main page.

[Knei 1.6: One-line input for talk episodes](https://preview.redd.it/vyykpchco84e1.png?width=1069&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d1e7a0778c060504b98995cbd2181a9a5bd8d84)

Now, you can tell what encounters with people you had and get the note drafts to save casually.

For example, a story like: 

﻿*""I've met with my friend Utara, we had a coffee and discussed the latest news.""*

becomes the note draft, such as

[Note draft from processed story](https://preview.redd.it/bagn5zvjo84e1.png?width=817&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4cc10461b827451379261ceac2b622ed9c63ae1)

That way, the input field becomes the first stop to make a note. You just tell there how your day/week went, and Knei serves the organized notes related to different people for you to save.

H24, 
Y’a trois mois  rencontré une fille plutôt cool de 24 ans aussi à travers des amis commun lors d’une soirée .

On a pas mal discuté ce soir et elle a pris mon numéro .
Elle m’a proposé de se voir pour un brunch le dimanche de ma même semaine (c’était un vendredi)
J’ai accepté avec plaisir .

Elle m’a inviter le week-end suivant pour un déjeuner.
J’ai voyager à l’étranger pour deux semaine après , et je l’ai invité à mon tour à un déjeuner . 
Ensuite on se voyait régulièrement une semaine sur deux . 

Hier elle s’est invité chez moi pour déguster mon hand-drip coffee fait à la Japonaise (je lui avait envoyé plusieurs photos de mes créations , et elle m’a demandé pourquoi je l’ aid jamais inviter , alors elle m’a demander si elle pouvait passer chez moi)

Bref.  A un moment elle m’a demander quel était mon type de fille ….
J’ai répondu que c’est comme les glaces:
J’aime bien vanille , caramel , fraise , etc j’aime tous les parfums , ce qui compte c’est la qualité de la glace , donc j’ai pas de réel préférence …

Et la elle me demande ce que je pense d’elle et comment je vois notre relation…
Et la je réalise qu’il y a qq chose .
Je dit que je passe seulement du temps avec les gens que j’apprécie et je lui demande ce qu’elle pense de moi …
Et elle me dit qu’elle a des sentiments pour moi et me demande si c’est réciproque…
Et la je suis pris par surprise…
J’avais pas du tout pensé qu’elle voudrait être plus qu’amis .
J’ai jamais eu de copine et je n’ai jamais vu de fille s’intéresser à moi (même si j’ai plusieurs amies féminines)

Je lui ai dis que j’étais surpris , mais aussi très flatter qu’une fille comme elle puisse s’intéresser à moi , mais que j’avais pas réfléchis à ça et que j’avais besoin d’y réfléchir avant de me décider.

Mais , mm. Messsge n’est pas passer .
Elle m’a dit que si j’étais pas intéressé , que je pouvais le dire , 
Et elle a plus ou mins sous-entendu que je ne devrais pas en profiter pour juste coucher Vance elle (je sais plus trop comment elle a exactement dit ça )
Je lui est assurer que j’avais aucune intention sexuelle, et pour essayer de la rassurer je lui ai dis qu’on étais pas obligé de coucher ensemble même si on développe une relation 

Je lui ai demander si je pouvais y réfléchir pendant 2/3 jours ,

Mais elle m’a coupé et m’a dit que si je ne savais pas sur le coup, ça ne servait à rien ….

Etc etc….
Ça a un peu coupé le momentum qu’on avait et elle est partis après 15 minutes .

Bref.  On est dimanche et je ne sais pas quoi faire .

J’ai jamais eu de copine c et j’ai vraiment été pris par surprise.  
J’ai vraiment besoin d’un moment de réflexion .
C’est une fille bien , mais j’ai trouvé qu’elle a un peu exagérer .

Les filles attendent-elle que le mec se décide sur le coup ?

As today is the 1st Sunday of Advent making it the start of the Christmas Season.

What fitting way of starting the Christmas Season is by showcasing the very unique ""Paskong Pilipino"" or Filipino Christmas.

As we all now, or it is a common fact we Filipinos love to celebrate. Every month their are Festivals happening all over the country. It is not surprising that Philippines as a Nation with a majority of Christian population celebrate Christmas with our own flavor. It is common fact that we have the longest ""Christmas Season"" or ""Kapaskuhan"" in the world.

I am being ahead of my self. So let's go on with this weeks lesson:

# ANG PASKONG PILIPINO

——————————————————————————————————————

# General Info:

In the Philippines, Christmas (Filipino: **Pasko**;  is a major annual celebration, as in most countries of the Christian world. It is celebrated as a public holiday in the country on December 25, concurrent with other countries.

As one of the two predominantly Catholic countries in Asia (the other one being East Timor), the Philippines celebrates the world's longest Christmas season (Filipino: *Kapaskuhan*) spanning what it refers to as the ""ber months"". With Christmas music played as early as August, the holiday season gradually begins by September, reaches its peak in December during Christmastide, and concludes within the week after New Year's Day; however, festivities may last until the third Sunday of January, the feast day of the Santo Niño. Liturgically, the Christmas season is observed by the Catholic Church from the first day of Advent (the fourth Sunday before Christmas) to Three Kings' Day, which falls on the Sunday between January 2 and 8.

# Filipino Etymology:

In Filipino and most Philippine languages, the word Paskó commonly refers to Christmas. It comes from the Spanish phrase pascua de navidad (lit. 'Easter of the Nativity'); the latter part, de navidad, fell out of use, leaving the word pascua to be assimilated into the local languages over the years.

# History:

The celebrations of Christmas in the Philippines have deep influences of Catholicism, tracing their roots back to Spanish colonial rule from 1521 to 1898. Currently, the Philippines holds the longest running festivity of the Christmas season in the world, which begins on September 1.

# Common and General Traditions observed:

This is a list of common traditions practiced and observed in during the Christmas Season.

# Simbang Gabi  / Misa de Gallo:

***Simbang Gabi*** (English ""**Night Mass**""; Spanish: *Misa de Gallo*, ""Rooster's Mass"")  is a novena of dawn Masses from **December 16 to 24** (Christmas Eve). Attending the Masses is meant to show devotion to God and heightened anticipation for Christ's birth, and folk belief holds that God grants the special wish of a devotee who hears all nine Masses.

After hearing Mass, Catholic families buy traditional Filipino holiday fare for breakfast outside the church and eat it either within the church precincts or at home. Vendors offer many native delicacies, including *bibingka* (rice flour and egg-based cake, cooked using coal burners above and under); *putò bumbóng* (a purple, sticky rice delicacy steamed in bamboo tubes, buttered then sprinkled with brown sugar and shredded dried coconut meat). Drinks include coffee, *salabát* (ginger tea) and *tsokolate* (thick, Spanish-style hot chocolate). Some Aglipayan churches invite the congregation to partake of the ""*paínit*"" (literally, ""heater""), a post-Mass snack of mostly rice pastries served with coffee or cocoa at the house of the Mass sponsor. The *bibingka* and *putò bumbóng* are also served to those attending the anticipated evening Masses together with dinner.

# Noche Buena / Christmas Eve:

For Catholic Filipinos, Christmas Eve (""Filipino: *Bisperas ng Pasko*""; Spanish: *Víspera de Navidad*) on December 24 is celebrated with the Midnight Mass, and the traditional *Noche Buena* (Filipino Spanish ""Good Night"") feast. Family members dine together at around midnight. Some families would also open presents at this time.

The Christmas dinner eaten around midnight on Christmas Eve is known as ***Noche Buena*** (not to be confused with the New Year's Eve dinner known as *Medianoche*). Common traditional dishes served for the meal include: lechón, various types of pancit (noodles), Filipino spaghetti, *hamonado*, *jamón*, *queso de bola*, *morcón*, *embutido*, chicken galantina, *almondigas* (meatballs), *paelya* (*arroz valenciana*, *bringhe*, etc.), *lumpia*, *menudo*, *mechado*, *caldereta*, *callos*, chicken pastel, *relyenong bangús* (stuffed milkfish), *lengua estofado*, *adobo*, and various types of barbecue (*inihaw*). Almost all of these dishes are eaten with white rice. Desserts and side dishes include *úbe halayá*, turon, leche flan, macaroni salad, *membrilyo*, fruit salad, buko salad, *crema de fruta*, *ensaymada*, champorado, mango float, fruitcake, *castañas* (roasted chestnuts), and various other *kakanin* (rice cakes) like *puto bumbong*, *bibingka*, *suman*, *biko*, and *sapin-sapin*. Popular beverages are *tsokolate* as well as coffee, soda, wine, beer, alcoholic drinks, and fruit juices.

# Parol Decorations:

A parol (, also written as paról or parul, from Spanish *farol*, meaning lantern) is a Filipino ornamental lantern displayed during the Christmas season. Parols are traditionally constructed using bamboo and Japanese paper, and are illuminated with candles, oil lamps, or carbide lamps. Modern parols can be made using other materials such as plastic, metal, and capiz shells and are usually illuminated with electric lighting. Its most-common form is a five-pointed star, although it can come in various shapes and sizes. Large disc-shaped electronic versions of parols produced in Pampanga are known as ""parul sampernandu"",

The parol is a traditional part of the Panunulúyan pageant in the nine-day Christmas Novena procession during the Spanish colonial period of the Philippines. It was initially rectangular or oblong in shape and was made with white paper, but eventually came to be made in various shapes and colors. It became standardized to a five-pointed star (symbolizing the Star of Bethlehem) during the American colonial period. It remains an iconic symbol of Filipino Christmas.

As stated Above, **Pampanga** (My Home Province) makes the most common type of Parol. Pampanga also helms itself as the Christmas Capitol of the Philippines. We Annually celebrate the **Ligligang Parul** or Giant Lantern Festival.

# Panunuluyan:

In different provinces and schools, the journey of Joseph and the pregnant Virgin Mary in search of lodging is re-enacted. The pageant, traditionally called the ""Panunulúyan"", ""Pananawágan"", or ""Pananapátan"", is modeled after the Spanish Las Posadas.

The *Panunulúyan* is performed after dark, with the actors portraying Joseph and the Virgin Mary going to pre-designated houses. They perform a chant meant to rouse the ""owners of the house"" (also actors) to request for lodging. The owners then cruelly turn them away, sometimes also in song, saying that their house is already filled with other guests. Finally, Joseph and Mary make their way to the parish church where a replica of the stable is set up. The birth of Jesus is celebrated at midnight with the *Misa de Gallo*.

# Pamamasko / Carol singing:

From the word Pasko, Pamamasko is the act of caroling while namamasko is the caroler. Children ranging from elementary age to High school age tend to round the streets and go house to house to sing Christmas songs.

# Christmas Day proper:

In the day of the Actual Christmas, Filipino children often litter the streets in their best casual attire getting ready to ask of Aguinaldo.

Preferably in the morning, Filipinos typically visit their extended family, especially to pay their respects to senior relatives. This custom of giving respect is enacted through the ""*Págmamáno*"". A supplicant takes the back of an elder's hand and presses it against the forehead while giving the greeting, ***Máno, pô*** **(lit. ""\[Thy\] hand, please"")**. The elder often responds by reciting a blessing or simply acknowledging the gesture, and in return gives ""***Aguinaldo***"" or money in the form of crisp banknotes, often placed in a sealed envelope such as an ***ang pao***. Godparents, in particular, are socially obligated to give presents or ***aguinaldo*** to their godchildren, to whom they often give larger amounts compared to other younger relatives.

A festive lunch may follow the ""***Págmamáno***"". The menu is heavily dependent upon the finances of the family, with richer families preparing grand feasts while poorer families choose to cook simple yet special dishes. Some families choose to open presents on this day after the lunch.

When nighttime falls, members of the family usually return home or linger to drink, play parlor games, and chat. Some may opt to have another feast for dinner, while a minority spend the entire day at home to rest after the previous days' festivities.

Would anyone here like to partner with me in which I provide the story and the other person in the partnership would make the video? PS: sorry for my bad english.

The story below.

Title: The Garden of Inert Desires

Author: Simulacrum (pseudonym)

It's been a year since I witnessed the horror and, since then, fortunately I've continued to see everyday things, without supernatural events generating a madness that I never want to experience again. Last year, I moved to Kingston Upon Thames, one of the districts of Greater London, to live in the house that belonged to Charlotte Wilkins, an elderly sick woman. She was apparently very nice and loved to talk. She rejected the formality when I initially called her “Mrs. Wilkins”, and asked me to just call her Charlotte. On my first day living in the house, Charlotte and I talked for about 15 minutes. She told me that she had come to terms with her imminent death and that she would like to live out the short time she had left in her best friend's house.

Charlotte didn't have any children, so it wasn't a difficult decision to sell the house that had just been renovated, and as I was looking for a place to live, I didn't hesitate when I saw the “for sale” sign on the property and immediately acted to buy it. As she has no descendants and doesn't have close contact with her family, Charlotte wanted to leave some of her personal belongings with me, and told me she would be very grateful if I would take them. Considering that Charlotte was in very poor health and was getting closer and closer to death, I had a certain compassion and didn't refuse her request. So I got some paintings and other objects that were on the front of the house. Charlotte told me that she liked to travel and that Scotland was her favorite destination.

— It was in Scotland that I found a relatively rare and very special book — she said —, but I don't remember where I put it. If you find it, you don't have to come to me to give it to me, you know I won't live long, so keep it.

I just nodded. Outside, a woman was waiting in a car: she was, according to Charlotte, her best friend. The elderly woman thanked me for agreeing to take her personal belongings, got into the car where her friend was waiting in the driver's seat, and the two drove off. During our conversation, Charlotte sometimes let slip, in a subtle way, that she didn't like her family, so I got the impression that she had sold the house not because she wanted to live out her last days with her friend, but because she would

rather the house remained with a stranger than belong to relatives when the time came for her to pass away. I suspected that this was the main reason why the house was sold to me for so much less than it was actually worth. She was in a hurry to sell the house before death came for her and allowed relatives to enjoy her estate. I remember it was Saturday when I woke up in my new home, had coffee and then took the opportunity to do some cleaning and found a pair of pink shoes under the bed. I looked closely at the two objects, which, being so simple and delicate, led me to the conclusion that they weren't exactly ordinary shoes: they were ballerina shoes. I deduced that the shoes might be Charlotte's, and that they were part of the objects she had given me, but as I had no interest in them, I put them away in a corner of one of the cupboards in the house. As for the house, it's a simple but beautiful place: it has a hedge, a gable roof that makes up the attic and rustic walls with a slightly yellowish white color reminiscent of a sunny day.

I was also enchanted by the garden on the front. It wasn't a large garden, but there was plenty of space for me to spend time. The flowers in the garden varied in color, fragrance, size, texture and shape. The garden also had an elongated oak bench. What I'm about to say may seem exaggerated, but such was my fascination with the garden that I acquired a kind of addiction to it: the flowers and the birds that landed there intoxicated me. Some of the works of art scattered around the garden expressed a touching beauty, others caused discomfort: there were several small gray statues 40 centimeters high. The statues depicted everything from a mother holding a baby to a woman dressed as a ballerina, and behind this woman was another statue: that of a hideous figure that looked more like a cosmic entity.

The neighbors greeted me, welcomed me and didn't mind the hideous statues in the garden, which seemed invisible to them. During the first six days in the house, I spent time in the garden, on the oak bench, drinking tea, reading a book, or just observing everything in it, but on the seventh day things happened that I'll never forget. On the same Saturday that I found the ballerina shoes, exactly a week after moving into the property, Charlotte came to visit me almost in the evening. She had said that she was feeling her life slipping away sooner than she had imagined, and that she would like to contemplate the garden she loved so much alone for the last time. I was moved by her request and left her there, alone, just as she wanted. About five minutes passed and she went back into the house. To give her a little comfort, I told her that I would

take good care of the garden. She smiled, thanked me and drove off with her friend who, once again, hadn't got out of the car. A few minutes later, I was alone in the garden.

What was supposed to be a moment of ecstasy became a mishmash of bad and sad feelings strangely followed by uplifting ones. My body and mind felt as light as a feather, and slowly my body began to move away from the grass. I realized that I was levitating, and looking down, I saw that my feet were about 30 centimetres above the grass. The flora and birds that landed there began to liquefy and blend together like a watercolor of various colors, and I was confused by this madness because I had a mixed feeling of agony and delight. In the middle of this mix, a child appeared in the watercolor garden, running and smiling with radiant happiness. To my surprise, that child was me... I mean, in that beautifully hideous garden I saw myself as a child, showing a naive, childlike happiness. All this psychedelic madness was frightening and beautiful.

Gradually, the situation normalized, the watercolor crumbled, and what had previously liquefied became solid again, and as if coming out of a trance, I felt more awake and the garden became what it was again. When the terrifying psychedelia ended, I realized that I was exactly in the center of the garden, and my body was facing the house. Little by little, the house was surrounded by a dense white mist, but a little yellowish, like the color of the walls. A sweet, feminine voice from inside the house told me not to be afraid. Whoever was inside, observing the fairytale madness I was going through, concluded the obvious: I was afraid. And although I still couldn't see clearly because of the fog, I saw that there was a woman at the living room window, whose door led out onto the garden. It was still a sunny afternoon, but twilight was gradually approaching, and a black cloud appeared near the roof of the house. The mysterious cloud soon dissipated, revealing what looked like a piece of outer space in a large dark circle that I later guessed was a portal. A strong wind hit the living room door, blowing it open.

I thought the situation couldn't get any weirder, as I thought the madness of the place had reached its peak, but I was wrong. The sneakers I'd kept in a cupboard came

moving out, side by side. Soon the shoes arrived in the garden and positioned themselves so that only their tips touched the ground, they moved harmoniously in all directions, and I understood that these simple objects were performing a dance. The impression I got was that an invisible body was dancing ballet and that only the sneakers could be seen moving in that dance, again causing me a mixed feeling, this time of unease and admiration. Yes, I was admiring that moment, even though the darkness of fear arose in my core, because that's what the unknown causes: a disquieting fear, because I didn't know who was wearing the sneakers.

I had my back to the fence and tried to turn around to run and escape, but some invisible force made my body immobile - I could only speak and move my eyes. A crystal-clear horror flashed before my eyes as the sneakers stopped performing dance moves and started taking steps, walking normally, and they came towards me. The sneakers came closer and touched my bare feet. I felt like I was being hugged and heard the sweet, feminine voice again:

— It's me, Albert, it's me... You knew me, but my voice was different, it was weaker, because I didn't have the strength to go on living.

Astonished, I said:

— I don't know who you are. In fact, there's no way of knowing who you are because I can't see you, you're invisible to me. And how do you know my name?

— I'm Charlotte, Albert.

— Charlotte? The woman who sold me the house? - I asked suspiciously. - Well, your voice is different from Charlotte's, your voice is youthful and with a certain vigor, and not a senile and debilitated voice like hers.

The woman moved away at a distance of about two meters from me and suddenly became visible, and I could finally see her: she was a young woman who appeared to be about 25 years old, with black hair, blue eyes and a slender body. She was wearing a set of items that are part of a ballerina's wardrobe: a hairnet, tights, a skirt with a waistband, stockings and, of course, her sneakers. She said:

— When I was young, I had the desire to be a ballerina. In fact, I almost succeeded in fulfilling my wish, but life takes different turns from what people plan.

— I'm sorry, Charlotte, but why are you telling me this?

— For a long time, I've been spreading my anger in this garden, brooding over having my wish destroyed when I gave up ballet because of an accident, anger also caused by other unfulfilled wishes. This is the garden of inert desires, you see.

At that moment, I assumed that there might be an explanation for the child self appearing in the garden. I had several wishes as a child, but of those wishes, there was a special one, which unfortunately I couldn't fulfill.

— That smiling child you saw running around this garden was your wish — Charlotte explained. — As a child, you wanted to have a happy childhood, to be a happy child, but that wasn't possible because of your narcissistic mother.

She was right. I didn't know how Charlotte found out that I had a difficult childhood and, in truth, it didn't matter how this grim fragment of my life had come to her attention. I could understand, however, that the garden seemed to concentrate some of my unfulfilled desires, because while Charlotte... I mean, while the young version of Charlotte was talking, images of my desires that, for various reasons, never came to fruition were appearing all around me, like projects that I had envisioned and never got off the ground.

— A strong unfulfilled desire doesn't die, it becomes a dying psychic energy full of anger and anguish — explained Charlotte. — I'm dying, Albert, you know... You saw me weak when you bought the house. I, young Charlotte, am the version who had wishes for the future, but when you bought the house, you met the Charlotte who abandoned her own wishes and dumped them in this garden.

\- I'm really sorry, Charlotte, I hope you find peace when...

\- When I die? — she interrupted me.

— When I leave — I replied.

For a moment, there was silence between us. We looked at each other like two miserable people who shared the same misfortune: our destinies built on the frustration of desires that didn't develop, that only inhabited the mind.

— Why do some statues depict such beautiful things and others cause disquiet and chills? - I asked.

— These little statues, Albert, are my most intense desires, which, as you already know, have not come true. Wishes that cause restlessness and chills are also part of peaceful people, but there's a difference between just wishing for something bad and putting it into practice. In this garden, unfulfilled wishes become figurines that will soon adorn the house of the Goddess. I don't know if you've noticed, but since you moved here, a statuette of a smiling little boy has appeared in that corner — she said, pointing his finger to where the statuette he described was. — Remember when I told you that this is the garden of inert desires?

— Of course, now it makes sense, inert desires like statues.

— Exactly.

— Looking at the statues, I assume that you have a mind that's split into two sides: a beautiful side, and a dark side, very dark.

— That statuette of a mother holding a baby... - she sighed, looking sad. - I would have liked to have had children, but I'm sterile.

— Again, I'm sorry — I sympathized. — But among all the gloomy statues, I'd like you to explain that one... That monstrous figure behind the ballerina.

Charlotte looked at the abomination, smiled mischievously, and gave me an answer that would reverberate for the rest of my existence, for I would never forget that statuette and the dark meaning that Charlotte was about to reveal to me.

— She is the Goddess. She is Anguish. She is the Mother of Desires, those desires that cannot fight back. The inert desires like statuettes are still furious because they haven't accessed reality, and the Goddess is the one who brings the wind of encouragement, that same wind you feel when you levitate, and she also brings that wind to the desires that, by inertia, can be nothing more than desires unfulfilled by their wishers.

— And what will happen now? — I asked, apprehensive and afraid of what she would say.

— I'm going to die soon, Albert, and in order to leave in peace, I need the Goddess to do something for me. My pleas have already been made, the words have already been spoken.

The door to the room opened, and out of the room came an old and man with a furrowed brow whom I had never seen before. He came into the garden, confused and wondering how he had ended up there. He was startled to see the black portal and tried to run away from the house, but the same invisible force that had left me immobile also acted on him. Unable to move, he shouted for help, hoping that the neighbors would hear him, but no one did: everything that was happening around the house and garden was imperceptible from the outside. I could hear the noise of cars and people walking and talking near the house, but they went about their business as usual. In a flash, the man's voice disappeared, he was struck by a sudden dumbness. I asked Charlotte who he was. The young woman, with a wicked smile on her lips once again, told me that the man had prevented her from fulfilling a great desire. With an expression of distress in his eyes, the old man listened to Charlotte like someone carrying the guilt of a reckless past.

— See that gentleman over there, Albert? A drunk who ran me over, driving completely drunk, crushing my left leg and preventing me from becoming a dancer, rendering inert such a deep desire that I possessed. As you always saw me in a long dress, you didn't see my prosthesis and you didn't realize that I have an amputated leg. But the Goddess will help me leave in peace. She is ready to grace us with her presence.

The hideous figure that Charlotte called the Goddess came flying out of the portal and landed in the garden. It was a creature about three and a half meters tall, with large butterfly wings, but armored, and these wings were black with metallic blue edges. Its body was elongated and, in a way, looked like a slug - more precisely, it was a pink, gelatinous mass that was quite flexible, wet and disgusting looking. Its huge mouth stretched vertically from just below its eyes to the beginning of its posterior extension, which appeared like a tail. On either side of the mouth were two long appendages, which looked more like thin pink tentacles that moved in a snakelike fashion - the tips of the appendages were rounded and flattened. Its sharp teeth lined up horizontally, and its equally pink tongue oozed a thick, yellowish goo. At the top, there were two short curved filaments above its two slightly protruding globular eyes. The eyes were filled with red and in each of them there was a large black dot in the center

that moved according to the direction in which the creature looked. At the bottom of the monster was a tail with five segments. From the fifth segment, the tail tapered until it split into two filaments, and at the tip of each filament was a black claw slightly less curved than a hawk's claws.

The old man who had run over Charlotte was attacked by the two claws, which pierced both sides of his chest, in the rib area. The two filaments lifted the old man by means of the claws embedded in his ribs and carried him into the mouth of the Goddess. He was chewed up and I realized that his broken body had simply disappeared from the creature's mouth, leaving only traces of the man's blood in it. At that moment, I didn't know what to do when I saw that scene which, I'll tell you in the strongest terms, was the most terrifying thing I'd ever seen. Charlotte spoke again and I tried to ignore her, but I couldn't.

— I could have called the Goddess first, Albert, but I waited for you to buy the house and unconsciously pour your desires into the garden so that I could understand the Goddess' beautiful justice. I touched the statuette of the happy little boy, and I saw how your mother made you suffer. Wait for the right moment, and when you've spent enough time in the garden, say the right words. You'll finally be able to give your mother the end she deserves, she has to be torn apart. Just look behind one of the pictures I gave you. Eight months ago, I bought the house, but the disease came on aggressively, and I had to rush to sell the house, wait for you to settle in and then give you true justice. Between eight and nine months of attending the garden, that's enough for the Goddess to attend to you, and then you'll finally be able to invoke her. You only have a few figurines, you need more, and your wishes must be sincere.

I was getting weak and tired. Once again, my body became light, but the wind carried me towards the Goddess, and she, leaning down her gelatinous body, stared at me with her fearful eyes. Leaning closer and closer, the Goddess approached me, and I, levitating but still motionless, shifted my gaze to her open mouth and caught a glimpse of what seemed to be a portal inside that mouth. Through the portal I saw a mountainous region where there was a place with a large number of bones made up of shattered bones and also a broken body that was so unrecognizable that I could only conjecture that it was the old man who had been chewed up. At that point, there was nothing I could do but wait to see what the creature would do to me. To my relief, it suddenly moved away. The figurines began to rise from the grass and move through the air towards the circular, starry portal, where they entered to be taken to the abode of the butterfly-winged demon.

— The powerful Goddess is finally getting her due. The statuettes will adorn her ineffable home — explained Charlotte, with an expression of admiration for the monstrosity.

I was surprised by something rather symbolic and dark going into the circular portal through which the Goddess had emerged: the statuette of Charlotte, once represented as a young ballerina, now in its elderly version, completely naked, with a monstrous mouth on its belly and large butterfly wings on its back, which led me to assume that the statuettes of old Charlotte and the Goddess had merged. When all the figurines were no longer in the garden, the Goddess flew out and entered the circular, starry portal. The portal closed in a few seconds. Young Charlotte waved her right hand in a gesture of farewell and disappeared into the mist. “Now I can die in peace,” said a voice in my head. It was Charlotte's tired and senile voice. The wind that had been lifting me ceased and I fell to the grass. Dazed and tired, I focused my gaze for a few seconds on the reddish orange sky of the coming twilight. My body felt heavy, so I went straight to the living room and collapsed on the sofa, where I immediately closed my eyes to go to sleep. I woke up around 7:15 the next morning.

I know that if other people had experienced that horror, they would have left the house out of trauma and fear, but I decided to stay out of stubbornness, despite the fear of staying. Later that morning, I thought about removing all the objects Charlotte had given me from the house, and I began by taking a picture of a painting depicting three women, all wearing white dresses, standing in a vast area of vegetation where there was a mansion in the background. Above their heads was a blackened circle filled with stars. Behind the painting, I found a hole in the wall, where there was a book, most likely kept, or rather hidden, by Charlotte. It was a black-covered book with the title “Cosmic Magic”, and I noticed that there was a chapter in it called “The Invocation of the Mother of Desires”.

Out of curiosity, I read the chapter in the book with guidelines for invoking the Goddess, stating that she is asked to chew up and destroy those who have prevented the fulfillment of other people's wishes. The book explained that it is very different to fulfill one's desires in the right and just way and to fulfill them by deliberately harming

people. Those who intentionally or recklessly ruin wishes that can be fulfilled in the most peaceful way possible are targets for the Goddess — although each wish has a context for the Goddess to evaluate. Also according to the book, in 1591, three young witches from North Berwick, a town in Scotland, possessed manuscripts that not only revealed the existence of entities unknown to most of those involved in magic, but also instructions on how to invoke them. The manuscripts belonged to an Irish magician who lived in the far north of Ireland.

The three women sowed the desire to live peacefully, did not want to cause harm to others and did not want to be harassed; however, a group of ten men, who were not exactly sent by King James VI of Scotland; but, influenced by the monarch's attitude of having promoted fierce hunts for various witches, tried to capture them to be executed by them. These men slyly discovered that the witches resorted to harmless spells in order to have a successful crop and a bountiful harvest at any time of the year in the region where they lived. Even though these spells did no harm, the men considered them threats.

Confronting the men, the witches, using aggressive spells, managed to kill two of them. They didn't want to hurt or kill any more of the men, and warned them to leave, but they continued to attack them. Realizing that they needed much more than aggressive spells to defeat that hostile group, the women had no choice and, at the same time, with their voices in unison, they began to pronounce words from a strange language of alien origin spoken by a society of Celtic mystics whose members began meeting together from 1600 BC. The witches spoke the words of invocation like music: first in two-by-four time, then they spoke more quickly, in four-by-four time, with all the words being pronounced with their voices reaching a single musical note: B flat. Then the Mother of Desires emerged from the circular portal and chewed up all the men who had assaulted those women.

The book mentioned that the broken bodies of those men were taken to a place in Europe through a portal that appeared inside the creature's own mouth while it was chewing on them. This probably explains why the old man who ran over Charlotte wasn't exactly swallowed by the Goddess: considering the bones and the shattered body that I saw through the portal inside the creature's mouth when it had approached me, I assumed that the chewed-up old man was thrown into a kind of macabre open-air dump where the monster's victims are kept - the book didn't mention very specifically where this place is, it just pointed out that the chewed-up bodies were left in a mountainous region of Ireland because they didn't serve as food for the Goddess, as she didn't need to eat to survive. During that reading, I concluded that, logically, the painting Charlotte had left in the house was based on the three witches.

For the invocation of the Goddess to be successful, the book that had belonged to Charlotte recommended saying the words exactly as the witches did. The words, spoken in two different measures and on a single note, must be pronounced in an overgrown area, and this same place must be where the person who needs the Goddess has lived for at least eight to nine months, imbuing the place with memories and desires — just as Charlotte spent a lot of time in the garden, and just as the witches lived in the countryside. When I reached the lines in the book where the words to invoke the Goddess were, I immediately closed it and, a few hours later, burned it.

As I watched the book being consumed by the fire, I began to think back to when Charlotte had visited me on that dark Saturday, telling me that, to say goodbye to the garden she loved so much, she would like to see it for the last time - again, her friend was waiting for her in the car. I also remembered that, while she was alone in the garden, I was in the living room and could hear her uttering incomprehensible words. Nine months after the supernatural events, a woman, who appeared to be around 30 years old, came to my house and called me. I looked out of the window and recognized her: it was the woman who always stayed in the car, waiting for Charlotte when I talked to the elderly woman. It was early evening and this woman was wearing a black overcoat and had a string around her neck with a pendant, which I assumed was silver, in the shape of a pentagram. I opened the door to the living room and went towards her to ask why she was visiting, but when I got to the center of the garden, the woman, who was standing next to the hedge of my house, was in a hurry and said to me:

— You haven't invoked the Goddess to give your mother a proper end. You're weak, you're a disappointment.

And as soon as she had insulted me, she got into her car, drove off and I never saw her again.",2,1733059243.0,analog_horror,0,1.0,False

I started going over to Mr. Smith's house when mom’s drinking got worse again. He wasn’t like the other neighbors, who were always asking about my dad or trying to call child services. Mr. Smith just invited me in whenever I needed, and left me alone to read. 

I had never seen so many books in one place before. They spilled out of his bookshelves, covered the coffee table, and even piled up on the floor. There were books about politics, and ancient history, and math, and so many about science. When my eyes got tired Mr. Smith would make us both cups of tea, and we'd sit at his kitchen table and talk about what I was reading. I was learning more than I ever had at school, and I was full of questions. Mr. Smith would answer them all – except when I asked him what his job was. “I’m working on a project,” he said, and refused to tell me anything more.

We’d been friends for about a year when mom went off with her latest boyfriend and didn't come home. We sat up late together, Mr. Smith quizzing me about everything I'd learned -- the Roman Empire, Newton's laws, the Anunnaki, optics, calculus, the Freemasons, quantum mechanics -- everything. Finally, he nodded gravely, and told me I was ready. I followed him down to his basement, where he showed me his life's work.

To be honest, I probably wasn't ready after all. Mr. Smith's math went way over my head. I knew the symbols from the quantum mechanics books, but I didn't understand how they fit into the economics equations, or the architectural diagrams. But Mr. Smith did his best to explain. He showed me how good and evil were something that people were, but also something that passed between them, the same way that light and darkness were waves and particles. What he had figured out was that history could be explained by the interference patterns between the waves. “People are stuck in a classical world,” he told me. “But we need to make our minds quantum!”

I fell asleep down there, still trying to absorb the math, so complicated that it had leapt off the old-fashioned chalkboards to cover every available inch of the walls.

I woke up refreshed and excited, with a realization of my own. ""This doesn't just explain the past!"" I shouted, running up the basement stairs. ""You can use it to predict the future!""

Mr. Smith was already sitting at the kitchen table, two steaming mugs of tea waiting for us, a proud gleam in his eye like I had passed another test.

We started small. Mr. Smith had me shoplifting candy (Three Musketeers bars were his favorite) and memorizing license plates. I stopped reading books about physics, and started reading about criminology and forensics. Mr. Smith challenged me to steal a set of weights -- and then made me start working out with them. I filled my school backpack with heavy books, and ran the mile loop to the park and back again and again until I almost puked.

While I trained, Mr. Smith worked in his basement. He started going through piles of local newspapers, carefully snipping out names for analysis, arranging and rearranging them on corkboards alongside his equations. Now that he had me to help him, he said, it was time for the next phase of his plan.

""Hurry up, old man"" I teased him. It started to feel like he wasn't just my teacher anymore; we were partners. He was the brains, and I was the muscle. I liked being the muscle – and I liked how strong I was getting. Mr. Smith started telling me a little more about himself too. How his daughter was lost in the Classical World, the same way my mom was. It was personal for him too.

And then it was time. My first assignment was a local real estate agent -- a nexus of bad frequencies, Mr. Smith had figured out. Removing her would disrupt the dark vibrations in our area. And even better, we'd be able to measure the effect directly. It was scientific.

I had trained and prepared, but as Mr. Smith pointed out, I had been raised thinking Classically, not quantum – and that programming ran deep. When it was done I washed the blood off my hands until they chafed, and coughed as I breathed in a mouthful of smoke from my burning clothes. It will get easier, Mr. Smith assured me over tea, and I knew he was right about that too.

Mr. Smith sent me to the vigil, to collect data. People lit candles and held hands. A girl I remembered from when I still went to school even hugged me. People were sad on the surface, but I could tell that the local resonance was already better. Our science passed the experimental test. Mr. Smith’s plan was working.

We disrupted a dozen more nodes over the next year. One of my mom’s exes taught me to drive when I was thirteen so I could take him to the liquor store; now I was able to go on missions as far as Maine and South Carolina. We were on a clock, Mr. Smith reminded me. I was careful, and I had his math backing me up, but bad luck still happened, and if I got caught after I turned eighteen it would be more dangerous for me.

It was on my birthday that the cop cars showed up. I was out of the house, Mr. Smith had sent me to the store to buy myself a cake. We had planned for this, and I knew I should run, head to the rally point in the woods, but -- if they were really onto us, if the Freemasons and the Classical World were fighting back, shouldn't there have been more than two cop cars?

""His daughter called a wellness check,"" one of the cops explained, when I introduced myself as a neighbor, after the ambulance drove away. ""Apparently the poor guy’s been off his meds for a while. You should've seen his basement, total crazy town.""

I prepared a new fake ID to visit him in the hospital, and I brought along a zip gun that could get through security. I just needed him to tell me what our next move was.

He looked so old in the dayroom, older than he ever had in his own house.

""I'm sorry,"" he patted my hand. ""It's the medicine they're giving me -- I'm confused right now.""

""I can get you out of here,"" I offered quietly. I had already cased the building, and I knew I could take down the one guard quietly. Mr. Smith shook his head sadly. ""Or is there a nodal point here we need to evaluate?” I asked. “Is this part of the plan?""

""Plan,"" his voice trailed off. There were tears in his eyes now.

""Yes, the plan. How do we solve this?"" I asked more urgently. ""What's the plan?"" I had to know. ""Mr. Smith, tell me the solution. What do we do now?”",9,1733058675.0,WritingPrompts,1,1.0,False

I want to fix my situation but am I deluding myself? ,"I got a job as a visiting professor at a middle ranked US university in 2022. It was a dream come true in many ways. I have a PhD that I never used and I got laid off in the GFC while working at an investment bank. I was unemployed for 2 years and my wife supported me during the course of my unemployment.

It was a semi arranged marriage, arranged but had a lot of the traits of dating as we knew each other from before the formal marriage proposals came in. 

Anyway during my 2 years of unemployment I started trading the US markets with my knowledge of the financial markets and of quantitative finance. I made a lot of money, got hired by some trading desks in Chicago and Manhattan, and also independently published some research on derivative product pricing behavior in the real world that caught the attention of a few professors. 

I got hired (part time) by the university to teach some classes and collaborate with the said professors. 

As a real world trader I was viewed as a real wolf of wall street in my classes since many academics don't even trade despite using arcane math (that I still struggle with) to come up with models that attempt to discover or exploit pricing inefficiencies. 

In any case there was a female student that came to most of my office hours and had a high degree of intellectual curiosity towards trading. Our interactions in the classroom and in my office were 100% appropriate and professional. She graduated the same semester in which she took the class I taught. A few weeks later she emailed me asking if I would be willing to meet her for coffee and help refine her thinking about trading and be a mentor to her. 

I agreed. We met several times during the course of which I gave her my personal number. We started texting and over the course of a few weeks our texts went from the level of formality expected of mentors/mentees to friends. She also started flirting lightly and I didn't shut it down immediately. Over time out flirting became full on sexting that left nothing to the imagination. 

She asked to meet me for lunch and she wanted to share her trading strategies and pnl. I agreed. During the course of the interaction I asked if she would like to head over to my place to watch the movie Margin Call (we had talked about this movie and she had not seen it). She agreed. At my place we watched the movie and after the movie was over I initiated sex. We had sex and she stayed overnight. 

Since then we have been regularly having sex. I've tried to shut it down but she reels me in time and again. I need to end this on/off affair and repair my mind and marriage. Am I fooling myself, and what can I do to fix my life? She does not seem to take no for an answer but she isn't a psycho or anything. I just want this to blow over and for me to move on to my marriage.

I also got a mixed berry tea and whattayaknow, it had hibiscus. I drink my tea with milk and when I add it to the teas that have hibiscus it color the tea a light lavender color and I really don’t like it.

My power system is based on the idea of that most things have a spirit. And each character can use the power of a spirit. The rules are the following:
-Is not their power, is the power of a spirit, so if they use it too much there's consequence. Like if for example, if a character can manipulate shadows use the ability too much they might be ended becoming a shadow.
-So in exchange of letting the characters use the ability, they ask the characters to do mundane things. Like drinking coffee or drinking a banana (yeah, so weird things). If they don't do them they can't use the powers.
-And they can't use the powers if no one is around. Because the spirits are a little divas, and they like showing off. They can't show off if the characters are alone or if someone is a little skeptical about their ability.
The thing is that I don't want them to have the classical control over normal things. Like yeah we all have seen a character that can control over fire. But how many of you have seen a character that can control flour? 
The thing is that I cannot think of the limit of what can be a spirit or not. Like I'm okay to based a character in the idea of using flour. But would make sense to have a character that controls cars? Or if a character controls metal, it means they control all metals, or just a specific type of metal? 
So yeah that mostly the problems I have, I thought about making the spirits something that people would be willing to sacrifice for. Like why would someone will sacrifice something for wifi? But I don't know, it doesn't ring the bell.
Any suggestions?

My wife is starting a coffee shop in the new year and she is busy getting stuff together, she has bought a secondhand Royal Syncho 2 espresso machine which appears to be in great condition, this is where I come in I have been tasked with the plumbing and electrical connection. I have the necessary knowledge and qualifications to perform this, but have never done an espresso machine, so do you have any tips or suggestions regarding electrical switch location (thinking making it easier to turn off for cleaning or alike) or a particular type or location of water isolation valve that could make life easier? Finally the instructions say to put the drain pipe into bucket or other similar container below the counter, is there any reason this shouldn’t go into a mains waste pipe (similar setup to a washing machine waste)?
Thanks for any help or advice in advance.",2,1733058070.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1h42oov,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1h42oov/how_do_you_go_about_rebuilding_routines_after/,How do you go about rebuilding routines after life changes?,"I recently had a lot of major life changes (moved countries and started an early-morning part-time full-remote position with minimal daily interaction), and have realized I need routines to function. My functioning is not great recently. I'm exhausted just with only my essential commitments.

Very little from from my tried-and-true routines is replicable here. Over the last few months, I feel like I've tried so many different things, but almost nothing seems like it's sticking.

After realizing I need to work on my routines, however, I have reattempted my historically most helpful routine: morning exercise. It seems promising so far. I've learned, (1) its really important, so I really need to push myself to go (2) I can't do it at home (3) start small/easy (4) I need to timeblock a lot of extra time or I panic (5) has to be before work (6) I can't wake up too early

I had tried implementing an exercise routine countless times already, each time learning one of those lessons. Just goes to show you can't simply make a ""logical"" routine -- you have to make something very personalized to your needs.

Does anyone have any tips/tricks to finding routines that work well for you?

\----------------------------------------------------------------------

Also, in case this is useful for anyone, my thoughts on routines:

My ADHD craves novelty, and I hate doing the same things over-and-over. That said, I admit that during the happiest periods of my life, I had very good routines. Something like: wake up, gym, prep kale smoothie for lunch, go to work, eat lunch at same time, go to library to study, take a walk, etc. I am so much more happy and productive when I have a good routine.

Why? I think it's two things:

1. **Anxiety:** I'm a very anxious person, and routines are inherently low-anxiety. A lot of my anxiety comes from crazy things like ""What do I do if my usual mat at the gym has been taken?"" or ""What if the lady at the coffee shop asks me a question I wasn't expecting?"" -- and the more times I've done things, the more of all the possible scenarios I've encountered. So I don't stress.
2. **Emotional Regulation** I have a terrible time with emotional regulation, and routines help with that. I do knowledge work for a living, so I need to be able to focus to get my job done. The best routines are able to help me regulate my emotions and focus. For example, finding a work spot that my brain can recognize as a place to focus, that has just the right amount of silence/lighting/warmth and making sure I have snacks/water/fidgets etc with me. And then it helps me predict how long I can focus before I need to get up and do something active again.",2,1733057745.0,autism,1,1.0,False

My lifes been upside down and my kids were suffering because of it. Im bipolar1 with ptsd and anxiety+panic disorder and I'm having seizures.  I've never lived with my mom but I was desperately seeking something cause im barely hanging on. 
I've  contributed every penny I get to the house hold. About 2000 a month.  I run any and every errand that is needed. I cook 2 meals a day. I clean up or at the very least straighten the house up every day. 
 I also care for my 2 yr old niece and my 24 year old nephew with a brain injury in my mother's home because she was doing it before i moved in. I am not allowed any sort of self care. My mother is critical of every thing i do and makes me feel extremely uncomfortable constantly. I have 1 pair of pants I can wear out in public and 1 pair of sleep pants. I ""sleep"" either on the floor or couch every night. If I get in the bath tub to try to relax after I get my kids down i can usually get away with 30 minutes but it's like she sets a timer. She doesn't care that sleep is as essential if not more essential than my lithium.  I'm off of all of my other meds. I'm expected to have all of my kids in bed and quiet and no tv by 7 pm unless my brothers son is visiting. then its whatever 
time he decides he wants to go to bed. Hes 10.  My mother's income is only about 1100 a month and she was struggling too so I thought this would be a possible solution.  I've attempted suicide twice in the last five years and both times was on life support and hospitalized.  I really do want to live. Right now its just for my kids but I wasn't always this way. I'd like to believe I can get back to a good place. 
 This isn't it though. I'm trapped and I just want to blow my freaking brains out. 
 I'm trying to convince myself this is temporary. My nephew is here and was wondering around until 10 pm or so. No big deal. I was laying on the couch.  3am my mother decides to make coffee and start her day. I already have a really hard time sleeping. Besides my mental health I'm obese, have chronic pain and haven't had a bed since may.

[Not sure if TW is required, but in case: one month post op medical emergency, discussion of vitals, medical procedures, ill-trained EMTs, blood, ICU, hospital stay]

**Edited to add: Whipple Procedure was due to husband's NET in the Ampulla of Vater, along with pancreatic, liver & gallbladder problems

Thank you in advance for reading and for any info or insight you or someone you may know has had in their Post Whipple experience. I apologize for the length, but wanted to be accurate.

My husband underwent the whipple procedure at the end of October. Thankfully no detrimental complications during surgery or in the CCU. I tried to put the home together and all the things for recovery on his come home. And from discharge there was combined effort to find and implement a routine for nutrition, safe movement, pain management, medication management. 

Go to post-op discharge appointments, follow ups, etc; we really try to stick to plan his amazing surgeon created the way for. Gets post op labs & CT scans all doing and showing on the right path. 

Cue, this past Monday & his birthday, to boot 😭.
He woke feeling kind of bleh but was okay. He took our son to school, ran some easy errands (trying to get out of the house sense of normalcy since Dr approve to drive. Came home and had easy turkey, white bread sandwich with his water and other allowed fluids. 

Around and after this point, he's feeling a packed fullness, in his midsection like indigestion so he just tries to stretch out in recliner. He appears to me still poorly, so getting in from work, & our son, i ask whats his appetite? Ill go to lengths to get him fed. Weather outside is turning colder, and with his body mass loss staying warm is difficult. He is a fan of hot baths (but i warned and pleaded him to use heating bags or hot water bottle instead. Being in the water, the warmth will drop blood pressure.) He insisted and tried some sipping broth then went in. 

He drains tub and begins to feel nauseated which is new since postop. Asks our son (11, this has been a difficult process seeing his dad, his hero, his coach turn weakly, but he, our son, is marvelous and we've been sure to throughly talk out these big scary feels), to get me; gets me & requests a Zofran for nausea, which to me is now sending up 🚩🚩🚩 that we may need to call the surgeon or go to the er. 

Husband is sat in bathtub, just general shower/tub combo water is drained, his face more grimaced we talk about how he's feeling, how I can best support him. Talk about we have to go super slow, and move together so we both don't get hurt.  Lift with legs and slow go up. Only his speech slurs and his eyes roll back all light gone.

He goes limp, bringing me with him, I thought I'd get a black eye from where I bumped shower, but I wanted to keep him from hurting his own head on the fall. I kept talking to him but he wasn't there it took several seconds of holding his head up to get him to come to. He is disoriented and unaware of what is happening. I call for our son & ask him to call the emergency line to get an ambulance. He is so focused and does so well turning on outside house lights on, opening garage, and getting our hellhound Rabun safely in a closed room. 

We stay on the phone with emergency line until EMS arrives; he is still disoriented and comes in and out of consciousness. The team of ~7 EMTs coming into this scene should have been could have been so much better. But in the moment I was met with grown men approaching this situation as if this was an eyeroll are you kidding me dude fell in bath tub, like why are we here? Type interaction and we were explicit with the emergency line that he is literally one month post Whipple procedure. Rather than providing immediate well checks of the patient, my husband, it was like a slow interrogation; there was no urgency for something that is clearly wrong or seeking to help the person in need, rather they were concerned with getting insurance information to ensure they can get paid. 

And then the question from the smarmy person taking charge: well do you think you need to go to the hospital? What hospital did you do your procedure? What hospital do you want to go to? All these questions seem so out of place; still no urgency in anyone's work or pace.

Now I am a lively person in good situations, I can raise my voice or what have you, but emergencies like this I have a whole life's history of knowing it's best to stay as calm as possible and especially since he is post major procedure, I am encouraged out of the bathroom to get his ID and insurance. Sometimes in a panic though, my hands may shake and my voice might crack, but in no way ranting and hysterical, I am trying to focus on the one person speaking to me with all the other commotion ongoing, and making sure to enunciate things to be clear.  

The background commotion ends up getting my husband into a transfer chair. There are no supports around his neck, he is barely coherent as he wheels by, clearly losing consciousness again eyes and mouth roll open and back and as I stare in horror shock confusion, an EMT puts a hand on my shoulder and says ""ma'am you just need to calm down. We are here now, we have your husband and going to get him to the hospital. We got him stable he is okay so you can calm down.""

My son even saw this and was taken back by the gross, mock infantilizing tone imparted upon me by the emt. I didn't notice this until he and I were on the way to the hospital, and our son brought it up. 

According to my husband, inside the ambulance wasn't any better. Through this whole whipple procedural, my husband has always been complimented for easily accessible veins for labs; they seem to be readily available; but, in this instance, somehow, the tech had issues inserting basic IV for fluids and had to, in husband's words ""dig and poke"" around before finding the suspected correct vein. Husband indicated to me that he knew he went in and out of consciousness, and his arm was super sore, and that the ""team"" he was in the ambulance with seemed to take a long time in figuring out how and when to leave to go to the hospital as opposed to getting his vitals stable. 

And I'm trying to give benefit of the doubt here, but, we don't live in a super rural nor a too densely populated area; we are between ~5 and ~7 miles to the closest ERs. The closer one being the big umbrella where husband had his whipple (had the whipple at the flagship city location as that is where his surgeon is out of, and we live about 30 miles north with a growing hospital hub of the company). 

So, with husband in the ambulance, my son and I cleared the house of straggling EMTs, left the lights on the house for them. We got our hellhound situated. Ah, bless her, she is the best. She had been very attentive to Dad all day and so we let her see what is going on and explain it to her. She really is incredible and seemed less anxious as we prepared to leave for a little while. 

Our son, I can't stress enough how proud of him I am for putting his best actions forward in this situation. I have been sure to keep him informed of this, as well as tempering that with the emotional & traumatic side of it. He is very plan-goal-action oriented and so we did just that to get ourselves ready to leave the house to meet Dad at the ER.

Cut to two hours later at ER (~10pm monday) and the ER wants to get a CT w&w/o contrast to see what's up. His BP is still scary low, he's weak and pallid appearance, but alert and coherent. Once the contrast is given to him, he said he immediately turned severe nauseated, but was able to get the scans completed before wretching anything that would produce which he said looked like mostly coffee grounds (we had been informed previously that this visual indicator is blood) and filled 3/4 of the bag with that and continued to spit up after. He explained that the wretching and expulsion had provided him some relief to the painful fullness he'd had since lunch. 

Luckily(?l) this triggered ER staff to be much more urgent than EMTs, they were able to get his surgeon on the phone because originally planned to get him stable then transport to main facility. But at the wretching this was halted and was too serious to do. 

So they pivoted, and got an IR team mobilized for him, and got him ready for a procedure to view the arteries and internals -- he & i both panicked, thinking this mean they were going to have to open him up again-- thank heavens it's done through artery at right groin area, like where hip and pelvis meet. 

They get him through that procedure and have to do a blood transfusion as well. The procedure found a robust pseudoaneurysm and pooling (somewhere on the pancreatic wall, i think, i am going from memory here) and had to apply 16-17 coils to the location. This helps stabilize him, but still his number are low. 

He's kept in ICU for the 1-2 nights; he has had a couple of bloody BMs and his levels are still low. As he stabilized more between the BMs, they have tried helping him get to walking with PT he's been on clear fluid diet and on to soft food diet. As of yesterday and today, no more blood in BMs, and appetite is slowly coming to and hopefully he will be discharged today. 

But I am so scared because his number are still low-- i understand they take time to increase and build naturally; I've already been trying to put together easy meal preps in his portion sizes that the nutritionists have advised. As much as I can, everything is by the ""book"" or guidance and sheets that his surgeons office and current medical professionals have provided. Along with all of that is the diabetes management that we need to recalculate and adjust for. 

I'm just posting this to see if anyone else has encountered similar issues weeks after the whipple operation? We made a very good time routine to follow all of his meds and dietary practices in recovery. Lots of rest, hydration, learning his new normal, lots of little walks as indicated, no lifting or significant bending. 

We-- he has-- tried to do everything as his surgeon and wellness team has indicated. So, were just trying to figure out things we might need to look out for when he comes home today and before we get him to see his surgeon i expect this week with follow up labs, etc.

Agh. I hate feeling so helpless. He had been doing so well to keep positive and really get well after the procedure, and this is such a setback, but i know he can, and we can get through it. We just need to get at it a day at a time. And we can start back at it again. 

If you have read this far, thank you so much. I am really glad I found this community and look forward to its insight and any I or we can provide as well. ",1,1733056849.0,neuroendocrinetumors,4,1.0,False

Let me tell you, I used to dread bath time. No, not because I'm afraid of water - I just couldn't find a comfortable position in that hard, cold tub! That is, until I discovered the wonderful world of ergonomic baths. I'm here to share my personal journey, from aches to ahhs, as I transformed my bathroom into a spa-like sanctuary. So, grab your favorite robe and let's dive in, shall we?
  
  
## The Wake-Up Call

The first time I noticed my old bathtub was more of a torture chamber than a relaxation spot, I was in for quite the rude awakening. I’d just come home from a long day at work, my back screaming louder than a toddler denied dessert. I thought, ""Ah, a nice soak will fix this!"" So, I filled the tub, tossed in some bubbles, and plopped myself down, ready to drift away into blissful oblivion. Instead, I felt like a pretzel twisted in ways I didn’t know were possible. 

My back ached, my knees protested, and I swear I could hear my hips groaning. I tried every position—sitting up straight, slumping down, even trying to balance on the edge like a circus performer. Nothing worked. The tub was so narrow that I felt like I was in a sardine can, and the hard porcelain felt like a rock concert for my spine. I’d step out feeling more tense than when I’d stepped in. 

Desperate for relief, I bought all sorts of bath pillows and mats, hoping to create a spa-like experience. Spoiler alert: they didn’t help. I was stuck in a cycle of discomfort, and my daily life began to reflect that. I was cranky, tired, and just plain fed up. Little did I know, my quest for comfort was about to take a turn for the better.

## Researching My Way to Bliss

Finding the right ergonomic bath felt like a treasure hunt, and believe me, I was armed with a map and a hefty dose of determination. I dove into the vast ocean of the internet, swimming through countless websites, reviews, and forums. First, I focused on comfort features. I mean, who wants to feel like a pretzel after a nice soak? I looked for things like contoured shapes, lumbar support, and non-slip surfaces. It seemed like every site had a different take, which was both exciting and overwhelming.

Read more: <https://tedsadvice.com/ergonomic-bath> 

I stumbled upon some great blogs where people shared their own bath experiences—some were poetic, while others had me laughing so hard I nearly spilled my coffee. I also asked friends and family for their recommendations. My cousin swore by a specific design, claiming it was like a hug from a cloud. I couldn’t resist that image! 

As I gathered all this info, I created a list. I compared features like size, materials, and even color options. Did I want a sleek modern look or something more rustic? The more I read, the clearer my preferences became. Eventually, I narrowed it down to a couple of options that felt just right, and I could almost hear the water calling my name.

## The Big Reveal

The moment I laid eyes on my new ergonomic bathtub, my heart did a little happy dance. Seriously, it was like seeing a long-lost friend after years apart. The sleek curves and inviting design practically whispered, ""Come on in, the water's fine!"" I couldn't help but grin from ear to ear. But let’s be real, there was a sprinkle of nerves too. Would it fit? Would the installation be a disaster? My mind raced through the potential for a plumbing catastrophe that could rival a scene from a slapstick comedy.

As I approached, I noticed the unique features that set it apart from your average tub. The built-in lumbar support looked like it could cradle my back like a supportive hug after a long day. The armrests were perfectly positioned, and I could already imagine myself lounging like royalty, sipping on herbal tea—or maybe just water, because, you know, hydration is key!

I took a deep breath, feeling a mix of excitement and apprehension. What if the installation team arrived and tripped over their own feet? I chuckled at the thought. But then I reminded myself that this was my moment. The promise of comfort and relaxation was finally within reach. I was ready to dive into this new chapter of bath time bliss!

## Installation: A Test of Patience and Pliers

Installing my new ergonomic bath was like preparing for a marathon—exciting, exhausting, and filled with unexpected twists. I remember the day it arrived. Picture this: a massive box, like a treasure chest, sitting on my porch, daring me to open it. After a quick victory dance (yes, I did a little jig), I grabbed my trusty toolbox, ready to conquer this beast.

First off, let me tell you, the instructions were written in a language that could only be deciphered by a team of NASA engineers. I squinted at the diagrams, which looked more like abstract art than assembly instructions. Did I mention that I’m not exactly a handyman? My last attempt at assembling furniture ended with a lopsided bookshelf and a very confused cat.

As I started to fit the pieces together, I realized I needed a second pair of hands. Enter my neighbor, who came over with a cup of coffee and a big grin. “What could possibly go wrong?” he joked. Famous last words! Just as we were tightening a bolt, the wrench slipped, and I ended up with a lovely bruise on my shin—thanks, Murphy's Law!

After a few more mishaps, including a minor flood (don’t ask), we finally got it in place. Seeing that beautiful, ergonomic bath gleaming in my bathroom was worth every moment of chaos. I stood there, hands on my hips, feeling like a proud parent. Ahh, the sweet smell of victory!

## The Ahh Moment

The first time I slipped into my new ergonomic bath, it felt like being cradled by a gentle hug from a fluffy cloud. Seriously, I thought I’d entered a spa in a five-star hotel, minus the fancy cucumber water and the judgmental looks from the staff. The water enveloped me in a way I’d never experienced before, supporting my body in all the right places. 

I sank back, and it was like my muscles let out a collective sigh of relief. The design of the bath cradled my back perfectly, and I could feel the tension melting away, bit by bit. I didn’t realize how much my old tub had been a villain in my life until I felt the bliss of this new experience. I could finally stretch my legs without feeling like I was wrestling an alligator. 

One unexpected perk? I found myself drifting into a meditative state. The soothing water combined with the ergonomic contours made it easy to just… be. I even caught myself humming a little tune, which I’m pretty sure was a mix between a pop song and a cat’s purr. So, who knew a bath could turn into a mini-concert? I emerged feeling renewed, like I’d just returned from a mini-vacation. Ahh, indeed!

## The Long-Term Impact

I never realized how much a bath could change my life until I made the leap into the world of ergonomic design. Seriously, it’s like stepping into a cloud of comfort! The first time I sank into my new bath, I felt like I was being cradled by a gentle hug. It’s amazing how something so simple can have such a profound impact on my daily routine. 

Since I started using my ergonomic bath, I’ve noticed some real health benefits. My back used to ache after a long day, but now, after a soak, I feel like a brand-new person. The design supports my body in all the right places, which means I can relax without straining. I’ve even started to sleep better. Who knew a little warmth and support could work wonders for my mental well-being? 

My friends and family have joined the ergonomic revolution too. My sister, who always complained about her stiff neck, tried it out during a visit and now she’s convinced. She says it’s like a mini-vacation every time she bathes! We joke that we should start a support group for ergonomic bath enthusiasts.

In short, my life has transformed from “Ugh, I’m so sore!” to “Ahh, this is the life!” Who knew bath time could be such a game-changer?

## Conclusions
  
  
So there you have it, folks - my ergonomic bath journey! I can honestly say, it's been life-changing. No more aches, no more dreading bath time. Instead, it's my little slice of heaven at the end of a long day. If you're struggling with discomfort in the tub, I highly recommend giving an ergonomic bath a try. Trust me, your body (and your soul) will thank you. Until next time, keep it comfortable out there!",1,1733056233.0,EverythingErgonomic,0,1.0,False
1h429pt,https://i.redd.it/5ljhrwyxd84e1.jpeg,"Had a great first date but woke up to the dreaded rejection text, so what now?","Hey everyone! Last night I (21M) went out with a girl (20F) who I had been friends with for a few months. When I first met her in the beginning of this year, I thought she was kinda cute but I was in a relationship at the time. When that one finally ended, I'd still her a few times a week, as I originally had, in a lounge designated to people in our major. It's a spot where people in our major do HW and stuff. We mostly did our own work but made conversation and found out we have a lot in common morally, politically, value-wise, and found out she lived on my street lol, plus found out she was Catholic!)

Again, I didn’t think too much of it at the time and assumed we were just friends and being polite. Over time I realized that I liked her and I started to see that those friendly signs were actually signs of interest. She’d smile at me and laugh at all my jokes. Eventually, I decided why not and asked her out to Mass and dinner afterwards and she said yes! In that week leading up to the date we still chatted as normal.

Come date time I picked her up at her house. Her parents were interested in seeing who I was so I introduced myself and shook hands and all of that. We go to Mass and it was great! We sat very close to each other and our arms were touching the whole mass. There were times where she’d lean in to look at the missal or tap my shoulder to say something. I went for a hug for the sign of peace and she hugged me so tight lol. Dinner went well afterwards! After that, she asked if I wanted to go back to her house and have coffee and dessert with her parents and some family friends and I agreed! They all liked me and I think they even thought or assumed I was her bf lol.

When it was time to leave, I went for the hug and she latched on tight and told her I’d see her around campus. I texted her when I got home telling her I had a great time and went to bed. I woke up to the dreaded rejection text this morning (I’ll attach it in this post).

I was honestly really hurt by it (as all rejection stings). I know she’s busy since she’s applying for med school soon but we had talked about that (and she said that I’ve been so patient with her and thinks it would work out). It leads me to believe that she didn’t feel a spark or something. I was a little confused because we had known each other for several months and clearly she thought there was enough spark to agree to go out. I'm confused on how to proceed. I want to add I truly do like her as a friend and severing all connection would be awkward bc I see her around campus (and we both agreed to take a specific class together next semester). At the same time, I’m scared that holding on would result in false hope that she’ll change her mind. I had to resist the urge to try and “fight” it out and ask her to reconsider and all of that 😭 I’ve only been in this position once before and I severed the connection bc I found out the girl made fun of me to her friends for asking her out.

What do y’all think? Should I try to have a conversation about what she wants going forward / boundaries? Ladies are especially encouraged to comment :)",6,1733056227.0,CatholicDating,14,0.88,False

That said I have taught myself to be a at home chef so I can keep the foods that trigger out of my dite.  Always scouting the interwebs for onion free recipes is a chore and have found out that Gemini will do it for me.

I kid you not it has changed my whole take on cooking and it is so easy now I feel like I was in the stoneage for all these years.

If you want to try it download google Gemini off play store/apple store and hit the live mode button.  You can ask it for recipes for whatever your wanting.  But the holy crap moment really came when I figured out you can just tell it what ingredients you have in the house and it will create a recipe for you.

I’ve read recently [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/s/6Wr3Oex8XZ) and so I started to wonder to do the same on my DF64v.
This morning I worked on it and it was a success! It has been quite easy, just disassembled the grinder from the bottom and then I wired the declumper to the ground line. All the work took somewhere around 1h, going slowly trying to not fuck up and understanding how to do it at its best.
I really don’t get why this wasn’t done by default or why fancy ionizers are needed at all.

In the first comment you can see some pics, I post here the video of the final result.
I tested on some coffee and the result is impressing! I did also a retention test: 20.1g in, 20.05g out (the scale was oscillating between .0 and .1) grinding at 1200 rpm. I’m really impressed!

I was never bothered by doing RDT, but lately I found the process a bit tedious so I’m lunching myself on a small project for adding the grind-by-weight (GBW) functionality to the grinder. For obvious reasons, with the crazy amount of static that was there before integrating the GBW would not be possible.

It is not good for man to be alone. 

That’s quite a statement. Taken in context, it’s jarring. God creates the universe and each day ends with “and God saw that it was good.” At the end, when all was created God rested and declared the whole thing very good. Then we are told that it — creation — man’s state — is NOT good, we should not be alone. We need companionship, connection, man is incomplete without a wife. 

Perhaps Adam didn’t know he had a need. Perhaps God brought the animals, male and female by, under the guise of finding a helpmeet (a completer) so Adam would realize he had a need. I can’t imagine God creating Adam and placing him in Eden and having him whining and crying. Adam was content in paradise until God showed him his need. 

The next step is crucial. 

As I type this, I have a need for another cup of coffee. And I’ll get my fat ass up from my chair and pour another cup. I can, as a man with a free will, manipulate my environment for all sorts of good things — and more than a few less than good things, and even an evil thing or two. It’s a bit chilly in the house this morning so I’m gonna bump the thermostat up a bit and turn the heat on. Or put my slippers on. We humans can — in some cases — manipulate and control our destinies. At our own peril. And in most cases we are called to work on and for all sorts of things. Our free will is a blessing and a curse. But that’s a whole nother topic for another day. 

I firmly believe that God has a helpmeet, a completer, a wife specifically for you and you alone and if you are out there manipulating the situation, you’re gonna end up with a baboon or a chimpanzee. 

God showed Adam his need and didn’t tell him to run around the garden, climb some trees, shake some bushes, and take out an ad on plentyofchicks dot com. 

Adam went to sleep. 

And God took from his side, and created the perfect bride for him. Eve completed him. 

What is the lesson? 

Go to sleep. You have a need. You wouldn’t be reading this if you weren’t keenly aware of that need. You’ve tried meeting that need in some pretty sick ways (me too). 

Let God put you and that perfect bride for you together. Don’t manipulate the situation. She will show up when you’re ready. If she isn’t there, that only tells me you’re not ready. And neither is she. Give it time. God gives us promises and we must wait for Him to fulfill them. Our manipulations cause trouble. ",1,1733055203.0,NoFapChristians,0,1.0,False

She lives with her parents and is difficult to date. However when we started dating we made it work, it worked for about 6 months then things started to change. One of the reasons it’s been working is because we see each other every day at work. However at work it’s formal, it’s not really dating. After work we used to always take walks and chat and perhaps do something quick like take a coffee. Now that’s not working because she has to get her kid from kindergarten. I totally understand that. But she is also very busy at the weekends and we have maybe 1-2 real one on one dates a month. It used to be better, we used to date more. Now this has been like this since August. I have had talks with her and she is saying she understands and seems understanding and somethings we’ve talked about have gotten better. But we still are barely dating.
