AITA?,"*Important notes for context: We're swingers, and we've recently shifted from allowing open/solo play back to only playing together. I don't necessarily want swinger advice, because it's not related, but that context is helpful.* 

Husband (M39) had a solo someone he was talking to who's not a colleague but is someone in his industry who he interacts with regularly. After our decision to shift back to only lifestyle stuff together, he informed her that their communication will go back to professional only. Cool, no big deal. 

After some more discussions between him and I (F38) about wanting more open communication, which I thought went well, I feel like maybe I need to be more clear or maybe I'm overreacting to this situation ... 

Husband was telling me about his day, where he had gone and what he did, usual day to day type stuff. He left out that he picked up coffee for the previously mentioned girl and dropped it by her office and chatted with her for a bit as his route that day passed her office. I knew that he had done that, but he left it out of his day until I specifically asked him about it. He said that it was nothing so he didn't feel it was a relevant detail to bring up. He got upset and felt that I don't trust him, he didn't hide it on purpose, just that it wasn't worth mentioning.

While I do trust him and realize that he still has to interact with her for work reasons, which is fine, to me, it's not ""nothing"" that he didn't bring it up. I would 10000000% much rather him tell me about it and \*then\* it feels like not a big deal. Those kinds of little details matter so much more than he even understands. I'm not asking for every single detail of his day, but this kind of stuff is important to me. I feel bad that I hurt his feelings and that he felt like I don't trust him, but ... I am struggling to figure out how to get him to communicate on the same level that I'm asking for, and clearly struggling to get him to understand \*why\* those kinds of details are important to me.

It has its fans and its critics, so let’s explore both side

**Coffee as a Friend:**

1. **Brain Booster:** Coffee might help keep your mind sharp and reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, thanks to caffeine.
2. **Antioxidant Power:** It’s packed with antioxidants, which help fight inflammation and protect your cells.
3. **Heart Helper:** Some studies suggest that drinking coffee in moderation can lower your risk of heart disease.

**Coffee as a Foe:**

1. **Caffeine Sensitivity:** As we age, caffeine might affect us more, leading to jitters or messing with our sleep.
2. **Bone Health Concerns:** Drinking a lot of coffee can affect calcium absorption, which is important for our bones.
3. **Digestive Discomfort:** Coffee can increase stomach acid, which might not be great if you have a sensitive stomach.

When it comes to coffee, like with many foods and drinks, you can find both pros and cons. The key is moderation—enjoy your coffee without overdoing it. This way, you make the most of its positive properties while reducing the risks of any negative effects.

1g6lr6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1g6lr6r/excess_electrolytes_can_be_worse_than_no/,Excess electrolytes can be worse than no electrolytes ,"It is an undeniable fact that excess electrolyte consumption has the potential for mild to severe health risks just like electrolyte depletion (i.e. hypernatremia). Nausea, weakness, cramping, headaches, are all common symptoms to hyper- and hypo- conditions. Heart palpitations (which I see mentioned periodically) are a sign of hypernatremia that is potentially life threatening. If you have any signs of hyper- electrolyte levels, stop taking electrolytes immediately!

The body needs to maintain specific, balanced levels of electrolytes. When fasting while overweight and glycogen loaded the body is losing a lot of water which can stress organs trying to handle an additional influx of minerals. Additionally, all the water weight and adipose tissue being released has trace minerals your body can use! Even tap water has trace minerals!

I'm glad those fasting 2+ days are beyond the stigmas of extended fasting; however, believing you ""need""/""must"" load up on electrolytes while fasting can put you in harms way if you overdo it.

Everyone needs to listen to their body. Don't start day 0 loading up on electrolytes - your body has plenty the first 24 hours. Incorporate electrolytes slowly if you want to take electrolytes. You only really must supplement electrolytes if you are doing a pure water fast without zero calorie drinks with trace minerals (coffee, tea, zero calorie energy drinks, etc.) for 6+ days. Ramp up slowly to find the level that makes you feel the best.",2,1729267490.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

1g6lqcy,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1g6lqcy/about_putting_them_down_from_the_pedestal/,About putting them down from the pedestal…,"People don’t realize that when you fall in love with a persone you also fall in love with their flaws. Everyone has flaws. So if you get out of the relationship and you try to convince yourself to see only those flaws would be lying to yourself. First of all because you are rationalizing emotions and second of all because you are trying to convert those emotions into something else. Hate maybe? Yes, this won’t work. The best advice is to Let every emotion good or bad flow into you. Don’t try to contrast it by trying to change how you feel about them. Don’t try to convince yourself that they are bad because you were in love with them nonetheless and your body knows it. Denying it is blocking the flow of energy and it will always backfire. Always. Find things to do. Invest in yourself. Practice meditations. And please go out and talk to new people. I repeat, go and talk to new people. Check your diet. Work out. Sweat. Gaze at the sun. Plant your bare feet on the soil. Stop over consuming stimulants and give your nervous system a break i.e. coffee, alcohol, porn. Sleep. Sleep is the thing that is doing the healing. And stay away from social media and I would say from your phone as much as you can.

And about putting people you love in pedestals. People get this all wrong. Putting someone you love in a pedestal is normal. It comes with the love package. You cannot avoid it. Every time love is involved you see the other person different from the other. It also happens with parents and their kids. What people don’t get about this is that you putting them in the pedestal has nothing to do with them or their qualities but it has all to do with the time as resources you invested. YOUR BODY VALUES THAT. Emotions are costly. Physically speaking. And so everytime you have them your body is investing a hell a lot of energy and it’s resources for this person. And that is why they will always have such a great value even with their flaws. You can’t tell your body that they have no value because they did this or that. Because that is not how your body is stabilizing their value but by the time and resources invested.

So obviously trying to put them down from the pedestal by finding all their flaws doesn’t work. Because you are missing the point. It has nothing to do with the flaws. And this will only end up by making you frustrated because your body will keep reminding you that they were the right person for you based on how much it invested and not their qualities.

So how do you get out? Invest in yourself. In every aspect of your being. Your body will eventually start seeing value in that and remove the value it has placed on them because now it feels better even without them. 
Or you can write down a list of their flaws and keep reading it daily and see where that goes. 

Don’t try to trick you body people. Understand it’s mechanism and work with that. And when I say body I obviously also mean your mind because to me they are the same entity. ",1,1729267433.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

I was right. 

I went to go call my brother and ask to go for coffee to talk as I still have little information on what or why this happened. 

He didn’t respond. Not my calls nor my texts. I didn’t smother him I called maybe twice and sent one final message after everything had settled. 

Still nothing. 

I wonder what I had done and the guilt I feel as if maybe I missed something. 

It hasn’t gotten any easier. A year later and I still lay awake wondering why.

In the last 2 years, we've been some sort of LDR (I stay in QC, he stays in Las Piñas) because of his work so we only see each other on weekends. Both very busy, he's working for a logistics company, I'm a developer.

Lately, I'm noticing little things that gives an impression that he's not exerting enough effort in our relationship. Things like planning where we can go (we used to explore around a lot), buying gifts for special occasions, and even meeting up with me.

I usually just go to his condo and we hangout there: play his games, ""chill"", and then go out to eat. I'm not opposed to the chill dates -- especially in this economy where everything is expensive. But I also think that I deserve something more than that every weekend.

In terms of the gifts: my love language is acts of service + receiving gifts. We've gotten in the habit of asking each othee what we want for special occasions so we are sure that what we'll get is what the other one actually wants.

If you consider yourself to be weird, different or even completely normal, I don’t want you to change for me. I want you to embrace what makes you happy and just be yourself and I will embrace the beautiful person you are too.

As for my interests, I like all kinds of sports. Football mostly, but I enjoy them all and understand they’re not for everyone. I like getting outdoors on hikes and walks when I can but I also feel in a happy place in front of the TV watching a series, crime documentary or a movie. Rom-com, action, mystery or even the occasional horror! I have an Xbox too, so if you do like video games then that’s something we can have some fun with because I can be quite an active gamer and I do have the Xbox Game Pass. I also like writing from time to time, using experiences as my template for romance or smut or just whatever feels right in the moment.

There is a lot more to me than I feel I should share in an opening post, but if you are interested in getting to know me or feel like I could be a positive match for you or just what you need, then please don’t hesitate to message me and then we could maybe take it to discord or something.

Sometimes I feel really overwhelmed with back-to-back meetings and the overload of information. I feel like I spend so much time in meetings I get nothing else done. I'm trying to implement more strategies to help with this, but it's tough.

1. Prioritize Meetings: Trying to encourage sending an email rather than having a meeting when possible. This isn't usually in my control, but occasionally it works. Also not attending every meeting I'm invited to if it's not essential.
2. Set Clear Agendas: For my own meetings, I try to establish a clear agenda to keep discussions focused, and I send it out ahead of time on my team's Slack.
3. Actionable Notes: I'm trying to improve my note-taking during meetings since I have a hard time listening and writing. I'm using Bash AI now to automatically summarize discussions and key points so I don't have to worry about that.
4. Regular Review: Dedicating 10 min at the end of each day to review tasks and prepare for upcoming meetings.
5. Use Asana Consistently: Trying to be more mindful about consistently updating and communicating on Asana.
6. Take Breaks: 5-10 minutes between meetings to stretch my legs or get a cup of coffee help a lot with the stress and mental clarity.

We embrace the dark hours. Kung ikaw ay nagwo-work sa isang US-based company, familiar na sayo ang pagtatrabaho ng *graveyard shift*. Habang ang buong Pilipinas ay tahimik na natutulog, tayo ay gising at alert, busy answering emails, attending Zoom meetings, or managing projects. The struggle to stay awake through the night and maintain focus is real. The late hours, fueled by coffee and sheer determination, are our natural habitat.

However, this comes with a unique set of challenges. Adjusting to this reversed schedule means sacrificing normal daytime activities—like going out with friends or running errands. Madalas tayong magising sa hapon, pagod at groggy, missing out on sunlight and the usual hustle of the daytime world. The societal pressure to be active during the day sometimes makes it difficult to explain bakit gising tayo buong gabi. The isolation can be tough, too, especially when family or friends don’t understand the night shift life.

**The** ***Aswang*** **Life: Sacrifice and Reward**

As *Aswangs* of the modern world, we sacrifice regular sleep schedules and miss family events to meet the demands of the job. But in return, we gain flexibility and opportunities that daytime workers might not have. Working for US-based companies often means earning more, given the higher rates and exchange rate benefits, especially if you're a freelancer. Plus, the hours can sometimes mean having more control over your schedule. Meron tayong mga oras kung saan we’re free to manage our time, even if it means a work-life balance that's unconventional.

It's also about hustling in an environment where time zones clash. US clients and employers are a world away, yet the work must go on seamlessly as if we're right there beside them. Whether you’re a digital marketer, virtual assistant, web developer, or customer service agent, the night is where you excel.

**Balancing the Day and Night Worlds**

Adjusting to this *Aswang* lifestyle isn’t easy, pero tayo ay survivors. Kailangan mo ng discipline at time management skills para di ka mawalan ng direksyon. Health, for one, is something we often neglect. It’s easy to fall into unhealthy patterns—like consuming too much caffeine or sleeping irregularly. *Pero tandaan*, we must prioritize our health. We may be *Aswangs* by necessity, but that doesn’t mean we should let our health slip away into the shadows.

If you're like me, nahanap mo na rin ang techniques to thrive in this night-driven lifestyle. Block out daylight with blackout curtains, drink plenty of water, and stick to a steady sleep schedule—kahit na sa umaga ka pa natutulog. Huwag rin kalimutan to maintain social connections. Isolation can creep in, lalo na kung everyone you know operates on a normal daytime schedule.

**The Flip Side: Perks of the Night Shift**

Despite the challenges, may mga perks din ang pagiging *Aswang*. Less traffic, fewer distractions, and a peaceful environment are just some of the benefits. For freelancers, the quiet hours offer a perfect setting for focused, uninterrupted work. Add to that the appeal of higher earnings, and this nocturnal lifestyle starts making a lot more sense.

There’s also something uniquely fulfilling about this setup. We’re part of a global economy, working with people halfway around the world, connecting across time zones and cultures. Yung feeling na kahit nandito ka sa Pilipinas, you’re helping a business grow in the US or managing projects from across the Pacific? It’s empowering. The *Aswang* life comes with a certain pride—knowing that while others sleep, we’re getting things done.

**The Future of** ***Aswang*** **Workers**

In a world where remote work is becoming more common, mas lalong dumadami ang mga *Aswang*. With the rise of global freelancing platforms and companies embracing distributed teams, it’s likely that more Filipinos will find themselves working through the night, juggling US business hours and local daytime realities. As we adapt to this lifestyle, so too does the world adapt to our skills and contributions.

*Tayo ay mga Aswang*, yes. But we are more than just creatures of the night. We’re professionals who embrace the challenges of this lifestyle, finding ways to balance both the rewards and sacrifices. So the next time someone asks why you’re awake at 3 a.m., tell them—because this is when I thrive.

For now, here’s to another night of hustle and productivity. After all, the dark is where we shine the brightest.",4,1729266678.0,AlipinNgDolyares,0,1.0,False

1g6lddo,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1g6lddo/not_sure_whether_to_continue_going_on_dates_or_to/,Not sure whether to continue going on dates or to move forward,"To provide some context: this girl and I have been on a few dates already. We met on Bumble 3 weeks ago and the convos and text messages were very vibrant and full for the first few weeks. 

The last date I went on, I continued to ask more about her including family, work, and then I tried to ask for info about past relationships to see if she would mention anything. Her response was very 'concerning' as she mentioned that her friends called her a ""playgirl"" when it comes to past relationships and I tried to get her to elaborate but she didn't really want to pursue that topic further so I stopped. Afterwards we just did some arcade games for a few hours and called a night. 

So here are my concerns: 

1) The energy I'm putting is not really being reciprocated. It could be that she's still shy and I just have the break the mold somehow. It could be that's just her personality, but from our few dates and interactions, a majority of the time, I've been initiating conversations and texts and setting up dates. She hasn't really asked me anything about my personal life or anything; the way I would mention it was to chime in or add to convo. E.g. ""How close are you with your family?"" *Her response* ""Oh that's great, I'm pretty close with..."" And that's, if not at least, 90% of the conversation. I try to be a enthusiastic and energetic with my interactions as well but again, no response or reciprocating of that energy. 

2) When she mentioned her friends called her a ""playgirl"" and wouldn't elaborate on it. I felt low-key concerned as I really didn't know what she meant by that. Did she use to dump guys left and right? Was she a very playful person? I don't know. Her intentions weren't very clear and it certainly raised a red flag for me. I want to make sure I'm not sinking my time and money into something that will not be a possibility. I'm 27 nearing 28 and I'm at a point in life where I really don't want to mess around and waste time. 


Overall she is a good person. I find her cute, I find her line of work interesting, I'm interested in pursuing a relationship if there's something there, but lately out text messages are kinda running dry and I haven't really seen anything to be like, ""Hey I want to be exclusive with this person and devote a majority of my time and energy to her"". I do want to figure out what her dating goals are and what her intention is over a quick cup of coffee or something. 

What does everyone think? Thanks in advance for the advice! Apologies on any poor formatting. ",1,1729266562.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False
1g6ld1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheTempleOfEs/comments/1g6ld1p/dogra_magra_series_insert_subtitle/,DOGRA MAGRA SERIES: [insert subtitle],"Hello, it has been a while.

To be honest, I didn't know I would be posting this week. With everything going on in my life, I thought I would have to out it off until November. However, October 18 is a special day for me. 

Today is the birthday of one of my favorite writers, Heinrich von Kleist; a writer of utter genius, and a huge influence on Franz Kafka. I can confidently say that if I never read Kleist, I don't think I would ever be motivated to write at all, for Kleist was the primary book I read during the pandemic years and reading him made me think that maybe I can write as well.

Today would also mark the day Moby Dick appeared in shelves for the first time. I have been rereading this masterpiece again as I felt that I sort of rushed through Moby Dick, which is an achievement in itself, but now I am taking my time now, and I feel Melville's words embracing me that I didn't feel the first time. There is something almost mystical in the prose. I once said before that I think The Great Gatsby is the ideal prose in English for me. But, now that Moby Dick is enrapturing  me, I am finding myself finding Moby Dick a perfect English text. It is everything and nothing. Whales and philosphy. 

College is tiring me. Thesis is slowly burning up, and I am supposed to do a solo documentary and a group seminar on the communities of dire straits. And add to that that I joined our college paper publishing some literary pieces of mine under a pseudonym, and I am quite exhausted that even coffee isn't gonna cut it hahaha. Well, the documentary and seminar is until November, and so the weight will be gone in a few weeks, but the thesis will be overbearing. Writing literary pieces is less a chore, so I don't see a problem with it. I would show you some of those published, but it is written in my native language, which I am quite horrid at, so I will spare everyone the painful reading.

Finally, I've been buying fewer books these days as our thesis is going to require money. I decided that that book I'm going to buy will not be fictional, but another sort of philosophy similar to the Nietzsche gift I had. I was wrapping my head around what book to buy, and I was dead set at first on Meditations, but then I saw Machiavelli's The Prince, and I bought it out of impulse. Why? At that moment, I thought of a story to write, which will require me to read this controversial treatise then apply it to a societal situation, friend making for instance. If I am to be honest, I kind of enjoyed the book. The way he describes historical events then says what went wrong or right is so fascinating that I could have sworn that I was reading a historical novel. 

I haven't written that short story yet, as I am still finishing up my 11th tale (I have been counting the stories I've written since my birthday). I feel like my writing has improved a lot ever since reading a lot starting this year.

Okay, enough of that. Time for what you came here for.

As I said, I have way too many things to do. That is inexcusable, of course, but I will still try my best to translate as much as I can so that I can satisfy the customer. Maybe it's not much, but I hope you shall accept the snail oace I have been in.

As for a time for the next update, I really am doubting that I can deliver anything by November, so perhaps it shall be another Christmas gift. I really am sorry. If I can tear myself in half to do two things at once, I will certainly do. 

That's really all. I hope you will enjoy, and be patient with me.

Thank you.

so i’ve been close friends with this girl. let’s call her “flowers”. flowers and i are a couple years apart and i feel like she’s a pathological liar. even though we talk like all the time, the girl can’t take accountability when she knows she’s wrong. in august, she asked me to go to a metro boomin concert with her and i bought my outfit and everything just for her to flake out on me and make me look dumb. 

i started to get red flags with her after that. she would constantly get in problems with people and insert me in it so i can automatically defend her even though i don’t know the full story. i started going back to school in august and decided that i needed a break from her. everytime she wanted to do a meet-up my guts would tell me she would flake out again so i would always decline it. 

this past week, her situationship from 2022 passed away. she’s been really depressed and having bad thoughts. even though it was midterms for me i would push back doing my assignments to calm her down. but the thoughts and words that came out of her mouth were really worrying me. yesterday, we planed to go to a coffee shop and just hang out. she sends me an address to pick up at which was 20 mins away from where i was and it ended up being a empty construction site.

when i went to the area it was just land and signs saying coming soon. i spam called her and texted her and got no response. i drove around the whole area for 10 mins to find her but there was literally nothing there and i had a feeling that i should really go back home. as i’m on my way home, she spams me asking me where i am. i decided to ignore them since i was driving but the messages were super weird because she usually doesn’t text me like that. 

i get home and decided to call her. mind you she is grown, but in the call she decided to act like a whole dumbass. she didn’t know what she did wrong after giving me an address to a construction site and how she didn’t give me the exact address because she had people that were looking for her. which I FOUND crazy because we trusted each other and not giving me the exact address pissed me off even more. and i was already made for her making me drive and waste gas just for her to waste my time..

she didn’t apologize and she wanted to change topics, and now she’s in my imsgs acting like nothing happened and wants us to hang out again today. i did try to get an opinion from my cousins since we all knew each other and are in a friend-group and they told me that she was trying to set me up. i really don’t know what to do..

I'll preface with saying the houses I've lived in the last 5 years are 100+ year old MINING houses. Lots of sad shit happened in our town, each one of these houses has felt like home. Quiet, warm, peaceful, even in the dead of winter. 

My parent's house? Built in the 70's, normal, suburb house. We're the second owners. Nothing sad happened there or traumatic, old family passed natural and their sons kinda used the house as a party house. We renovated it when I was teen, I don't live there anymore and I'm fucking glad.

I have no idea what's up with that house that each person in our family has had an experience- even my skeptic mother. So I'll just go down the list and give a timeline for activity kicked up and quieted down.

1. First couple months (about 6 months) living in our house we'd all consistently hear our names in another's voice basically in a ""calling you over"" tone. Each time we got to the person who called our name, they'd literally just be vibing in their room and go ""nope, didn't call you..."" que awkward stare and shuffling away. Happened multiple times to everybody, I'm honestly convinced it happened to our dog too she'd just walk in randomly and look at you like you called her name. She was old too, but she was also a dog and just loved love.

2. I think this next one was within the first years of living there? I can't remember exactly when, just that I was in high school I think. Entire family went to bed, which means we're all in our rooms and awake still but settling in for sleep. I thought I heard someone or something walk down the small hallway we had between all our rooms- but brushed it off because terrified. Until my dad comes in (he was almost asleep apparently) and asks me if I ran down the hallway and why I did? I had not. He then asked my sister, whose room was right next to mine, and obviously her answer was the same. I hadn't heard her get out of bed or see her walk down the hallway. Once again, awkward pause...""well...good night guys"" kid you not. I should mention he did say it wasn't the dog because she was on the floor in their room when it happened.

3. House got really quiet, I always (and still do) got tense in there though. This next one is probably just a horrible sleep paralysis nightmare, but I couldn't sleep or go into our living at night alone for several days. I basically had a very VERY vivid dream that me and my sister were in our living room and being chased/harassed by what I'll call ""a demon"", that's kinda what I remember. I remember that in the dream me and her were on our couch and had watched some sort of shadowy figure crawl up the curtains, on top of the rods, then disappear behind them or vanished. In my dream I told my sister to get our parents and that I'd watch it. Then I remember being chased around the coffee table knocked to the ground by whatever it was and trying to scream. I was also trying to scream in real life apparently, which is why I think it was a case of bad nightmare and sleep paralysis. I remember waking up TRYING TO SCREAM, I felt like I couldn't and I was in total flight or fight mode. Took me a minute and then my teenage ass went to tell my mom (my dad was out of town) and slept with her. I couldn't sleep the rest of the night and the next two nights I really couldn't sleep- I was too fucking scared.

4. That was the last of it for a LONG TIME. Which was a relief. Until recently. In the last couple years my sister has told me whatever is in the house has kicked up activity again. Mostly by opening and closing cupboards at night when she solidly knew everybody was asleep. Then during a time I was visiting it happened to me. I was laying in bed with my mom (because my old room is now an office), staring at my phone. She's asleep and snoring and our ""new"" family dog was also sleeping with us on the bed. Then I heard several cabinets in the kitchen open and close. I kinda just stopped for a second, there was no other noise it could've been because I've heard that sound for years. I texted my sister to see if she was awake because we both stay up on our phones at night (like everybody else). She said yes, and I asked if she heard that. She said yes, then asked if it was mom. I said no and asked if dad had gotten up even though I hadn't heard him leave his room/office (there's a couch in the there). She obviously said no. I obviously freaked out a little and told her good night she said the same to me. Next day we talked about it more of course and were just scared. 

At this point we're kinda used to it after a majority of the scary things happening earlier on. But it was just a reminder (and still is) that there's something in that 70's house that shouldn't be there and that my historical homes lack. I don't know. That house has made me a believer, and my entire family, even my mom gets uncomfortable occasionally.

Anyway yeah that's it. Nothing ground breaking, but just reasons I hate going home anymore and walking in that house at night to this day.",2,1729266418.0,Ghoststories,0,1.0,False

# Training

You can do hard things.  This is what I’ve been telling myself since January 2024, when I joined the Ronald McDonald House Charities team to raise money and run the Chicago marathon.  I’d never run a marathon.  In fact, before October of 2022 I had not really exercised in nearly 30 years.  I was a busy engineer, husband, and father, going through life like we all do.  But one small opportunity changed the direction of my life in a subtle way, and now the changes are anything but subtle.

I had a business trip planned for November 2022 to India.  I have a great team of engineers there, and post-pandemic I was finally able to go and meet them in person.  I had a week of meetings planned, and one of my employees, Saurav, asked if I would be interested in doing a Himalayan Trek after we concluded all the work.  Of course I did, what an opportunity!  I knew I was in no shape to survive or enjoy hiking up 12,000+ feet of elevation or traveling 10-15 miles a day up a mountain for a week.  I prepared by going to the gym and doing lots of stair master.  At the time, I thought it was tough, but I did it, and I had an amazing time on the trip, celebrating my 49th birthday in Sankari with my trek-mates.

When I got back, I continued at the gym.  I couldn’t really run more than a mile or so on the treadmill, but I persisted.  A good friend was going through a divorce, so I invited him to come to the gym with me as an opportunity to be there for him when he needed some support.  That summer turned into “Hard 75” which is a crazy internet challenge that involves exercising twice a day, every day for 75 days, amongst other things.  One of the exercises was required to be outside, so I started running in the mornings on July 4, 2023.

Over the next six months, I grew to really enjoy running. I told my wife I was going to be “fit by fifty” as my 50th was next.  I ran some 5ks, and then planned a half-marathon in January 2024.  By the end of 2023, I had run 626 miles.

I finished my January half-marathon (the “Chilly Willy”) in 2 hours, 10 minutes.  I had hoped to finish under two hours, but it was quite cold and I started too fast.  I set a new goal.  I would run a marathon.  THE marathon.  Was I crazy?  Yes.  The half was so hard, how could I run a marathon for the first time at 50 years old?

As anyone who knows me knows, I am detail oriented and I prepare for anything I do.  I began to read books on marathon training plans, on exercise nutrition, on physiology and injuries in older runners, and on the mental toughness needed to get through the race.  I went to a cardiologist and got my heart stress tested.  I went to a physical therapist and learned how to combat the “IT band” pain I’d been dealing with.  I settled on a plan, the “Hal Higdon Intermediate 1” marathon plan, primarily because the starting mileage looked like something I could do, but didn’t sound easy.  Week 1 would start June 10th and would require me to run 24 miles, including a “long run” of 8 miles.  My longest runs would be 20 miles during two 43-mile weeks, totaling 588 miles of training in the block.

The weeks went by, and I followed the plan.  I quickly learned that a marathon runner needs discipline.  Discipline carries us through when motivation inevitably fails.  There were many days I didn’t want to get up and run before work, but I had laid out my clothes the night before, and set my alarm, and by the time I realized I didn’t want to run I was already outside running up the hill.  Some days I was sore, so I’d do the check — could I run without so much pain that it affected my stride?  The answer was always yes.  Summer in Georgia is famously hot and humid, so I did most of those runs at 7, 6 or even 5 am to beat the heat and humidity.  Discipline was my friend.

By week 13, I had a 20-mile long run on a Sunday capping off a 43-mile week.  At this point a half marathon on a Sunday was a “de-load” easy day.  Perspective is everything.  Three more hard weeks, then I could taper and be fresh for the race. Of course, nothing in life is guaranteed.  I had a 1.1cm kidney stone that I had to have removed. The process proved painful and took me out of commission for over a week. When it was all done, I'd missed my second 20-mile long run, and it worried me.  I'd done the first one though pretty well, and practiced fueling all along, so I finished out the training plan and the taper.

# Pre-race

My wife was able to travel with me to Chicago.  We arrived Thursday and settled into our hotel across from Grant Park.  We went to the expo, and I checked in with the charity and bought some swag.  The next morning, we went to the Field museum and explored the city.  We went to the Eleven diner (highly recommended!) and had a ridiculously good french toast.  I knew I wanted to stay off my feet Saturday, so Friday was for exploring.  Saturday morning we did the Believe In the Run shakeout, then we stopped for breakfast (Yolk!), and then I spent the day laying in the bed watching TV and eating carbs.  That night we went to the RMHC dinner, and back to the room to sleep.

# Race

I woke about 5am.  My body was cooperative on the bathroom front, so I didn't have to worry about #2 during the race.  I left the room about 5:30 am, bundled up with 12 (yes twelve!) Gu Liquid energy gels tucked into the waistband of my T8 ultra sherpa shorts.  I spent a lot of time this summer trying to find the right solution to carrying so many gels, and these were the perfect answer for me.   I walked to Gate A, went through security, and then to the charity tent.  I had most of a bagel, a cup of coffee, and a Sprite while I waited for my corral to be called.  They took some pictures and stuff, but I sat outside the tent trying to keep my nerves calm. I used the porta-potty in the charity area once to pee, but the lines were long so I didn't get to go a second time.

When it was time,I walked to corral J.  I knew I was slower than most of the corral, so I went to the back.  Eventually, it was time to go, so I threw my hoodie on the fence and we started off.

I want to mention fueling.  Everyone knows it's one of the things new marathoners get wrong.  I trained my gut a lot all summer, so I knew I could take in a lot of fuel.  I'm a big guy with an iron stomach, but I brought gels and Tailwind with me all summer on long runs.  I took a gel every 2 miles.  It's a lot, but I knew I could handle it, and the liquid gels I use are much easier to get down than the regular Gus.  I also took Gatorade at every stop, and water at most of them.  At some stops I just washed my hands with the water to rinse the salt off of me.

The first 10 miles were the easiest, most-fun run I've ever done.  It was beautiful, and the crowd was amazing.  I put my name on my shirt, and people cheered for me by name throughout the race.   I saw my wife at mile 1, and again at mile 12. It was a great boost to see her, and she made me signs.

At mile 14.5 I stopped at a porta-potty and peed.  My legs were shaking trying to stand still after running 14+ miles nonstop.  It shows up on my strava as a slower mile.  It was worth it though, and I felt better after.

When I passed mile 20, I knew I was in uncharted territory for my old body.  At mile 22 I started feeling the beginnings of cramps in my quads.  I shortened my already short stride, but I kept running.

I ran, and I ran.  There was one point where  the wind blasted me from behind and I felt like Chicago was giving me a push to keep going.  Then I was on Michigan Ave with 2 miles to go, and I got the same wind in my face; Chicago wanted to know if I was tough.  I kept running.  When I got to the one hill, Mt. Roosevelt, I ran up.  I walked the last quarter to the top, then ran to the finish.  I finished at 4:59:57 -- three seconds before the 5-hour mark.

# Post-race

I was sore, and tired, and honestly more proud of this than anything I've done in the last 10 years.  All that work, all those sacrifices felt worth it in that moment. I can.  I will.  I do.  What's next?  I'm going to find out, but I can do hard things.",3,1729266323.0,firstmarathon,2,1.0,False

What Are Nootropics?

Nootropics come in three main types: prescription drugs, synthetic compounds, and natural supplements. Prescription nootropics, like Adderall and Ritalin, are usually stimulants that require a doctor's approval. Synthetic nootropics, such as racetams, are lab-made compounds. Natural nootropics include herbs, vitamins, and other dietary supplements.

While some people swear by nootropics, it's important to note that their effects can vary, and more research is needed to fully understand their long-term safety and effectiveness. [Legal alternatives for performance enhancement](https://musclegrowthxpert.blog/product-category/muscle-growth-products/legal-muscle-growth-products/) are available for those looking to boost their cognitive and athletic abilities safely.

# Nootropics for Brain Power

Many people use nootropics to improve their mental performance. Some popular natural nootropics for cognitive enhancement include caffeine, L-theanine, and herbs like Bacopa monnieri and Rhodiola rosea. These substances may help with memory, focus, and mental clarity. However, it's crucial to remember that the effects can differ from person to person.

For those looking for legal alternatives to boost cognitive function, [natural testosterone boosters](https://musclegrowthxpert.blog/product-category/testosterone/) may offer some benefits. Testosterone plays a role in cognitive function, and maintaining healthy levels could potentially support mental performance.

# Nootropics for Athletic Performance

Athletes often look for ways to gain an edge, and some turn to nootropics to enhance their performance. Certain nootropics may help with energy, endurance, and mental stamina during workouts. Creatine, for example, is a popular supplement that can boost both physical and cognitive performance.

For those seeking legal alternatives to performance-enhancing substances, [bulking products](https://musclegrowthxpert.blog/product-category/bulking-products/) can help support muscle growth and recovery. These products are designed to work with your body's natural processes to improve athletic performance safely.

# Popular Natural Nootropics

Many natural substances are believed to have nootropic properties. Caffeine, found in coffee and tea, is perhaps the most widely used nootropic. When combined with L-theanine, an amino acid found in tea, it may provide a balanced boost to alertness and focus. Creatine, often used by athletes, has also shown potential cognitive benefits.

Other popular natural nootropics include herbs like Rhodiola rosea and Bacopa monnieri. These plants have been used in traditional medicine for centuries and are now being studied for their potential cognitive-enhancing effects. Ginkgo biloba, known for its potential to improve blood flow to the brain, is another commonly used natural nootropic.

For those interested in natural performance enhancers, [HGH alternatives](https://musclegrowthxpert.blog/product/hgh-alternative/) may offer benefits for both cognitive and physical performance. These products aim to support the body's natural growth hormone production, which plays a role in various bodily functions, including brain health.

# Legal Alternatives to Performance Enhancers

While some performance-enhancing substances may be illegal or unsafe, there are legal alternatives available. These products aim to support your body's natural processes to improve both cognitive and athletic performance.

# Testosterone Boosters

Testosterone plays a crucial role in both physical and mental performance. [Natural testosterone boosters](https://musclegrowthxpert.blog/product-category/testosterone/) can help support healthy testosterone levels, potentially improving energy, focus, and muscle growth. These supplements often contain ingredients like D-Aspartic Acid, Zinc, and Vitamin D, which are believed to support natural testosterone production.

# HGH Alternatives

Human Growth Hormone (HGH) is important for various bodily functions, including cognitive performance. [Legal HGH alternatives](https://musclegrowthxpert.blog/product/hgh-alternative/) aim to support your body's natural HGH production, potentially offering benefits for both mind and body. These supplements often contain amino acids and other nutrients that may stimulate the pituitary gland to produce more HGH naturally.

# SARMs Alternatives

Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs) have gained attention for their potential to enhance athletic performance. However, many are not approved for human use. [Legal SARMs alternatives](https://musclegrowthxpert.blog/product-category/sarms-alternatives/) offer a safer option for those looking to support muscle growth and performance. These products typically use natural ingredients that may help boost testosterone or promote muscle protein synthesis.

# Safety and Effectiveness of Nootropics

The effects of nootropics can vary widely between individuals. What works for one person may not work for another, and some people may experience side effects. It's important to start with low doses and pay attention to how your body responds. Some users report improved focus and mental clarity, while others may experience headaches or digestive issues.

When using any supplement, including nootropics, proper dosage is crucial. Some substances may require cycling to maintain effectiveness and reduce the risk of side effects. Always follow the recommended dosage instructions and consider talking to a doctor before starting any new supplement regimen.

|Supplement Type|Safety|Effectiveness|Legal Status|Third-Party Testing|Lifestyle Integration|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Natural SARMs Alternatives|High|Moderate|Legal|Recommended|Important|
|Nootropics|Varies|Individual|Mostly Legal|Highly Recommended|Critical|
|Legal Cutting Stacks|Moderate to High|Moderate|Legal|Recommended|Important|
|Dietary Supplements|Generally Safe|Varies|Legal, Less Regulated|Recommended|Beneficial|

# Legal and Regulatory Status of Nootropics

In the United States, dietary supplements, including many nootropics, are regulated differently than prescription drugs. The FDA doesn't approve these products before they hit the market, but they can take action if a product is found to be unsafe or makes false claims. This means that the quality and safety of nootropic supplements can vary widely.

When choosing nootropics or any performance-enhancing supplements, look for products that have been third-party tested for quality and purity. This can help ensure you're getting a safe and effective product. [Legal cutting stacks](https://musclegrowthxpert.blog/product-category/cutting-products/legal-cutting-stacks/) offer a way to enhance performance while staying within regulatory guidelines.

# Combining Nootropics with Lifestyle Factors

While nootropics may offer potential benefits, they work best when combined with a healthy lifestyle. Good sleep, proper nutrition, and regular exercise are all crucial for optimal cognitive and physical performance. Stress management techniques like meditation can also play a role in maintaining mental clarity and focus.

A balanced diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and complex carbohydrates can support brain health and enhance the effects of nootropics. Regular cardiovascular exercise has been shown to improve cognitive function and may work well with certain nootropics.

For those looking to enhance their physical performance alongside cognitive function, [cutting stacks for men and women](https://musclegrowthxpert.blog/product/legal-cutting-stack-for-men-women/) can be a useful addition to a healthy lifestyle and exercise routine.

# Making Informed Decisions

When considering nootropics or any performance-enhancing supplements, it's important to make informed decisions. Talk to a doctor, especially if you have any health conditions or are taking medications. Choose quality supplements from reputable sources, and be realistic about your expectations.

Remember that while nootropics and performance enhancers may offer benefits, they're not magic pills. They work best as part of a comprehensive approach to health and wellness, including proper nutrition, regular exercise, and good sleep habits. It's also important to be aware of potential interactions between different supplements and medications.

For those looking to enhance their performance safely and legally, [legal bulking stacks](https://musclegrowthxpert.blog/product-category/bulking-products/legal-bulking-stack/) can be a valuable tool when used as part of a balanced fitness regimen.

# Conclusion

Nootropics offer potential benefits for both cognitive and athletic enhancement, but it's important to approach them with caution and realistic expectations. While some people may experience significant improvements in focus, memory, or physical performance, others may see little to no effect.

When considering nootropics or any performance-enhancing supplements, prioritize safety and legality. Look for well-researched, natural alternatives and always consult with healthcare professionals before starting any new supplement regimen. Remember that a healthy lifestyle, including proper nutrition, regular exercise, and good sleep habits, forms the foundation for optimal cognitive and physical performance.

By making informed decisions and taking a holistic approach to health and wellness, you can work towards enhancing your cognitive and athletic performance in a safe and sustainable way. Stay informed about the latest research on nootropics and be prepared to adjust your approach as new information becomes available.",1,1729265764.0,fitnessadvancedtraini,0,1.0,False

I haven't been able to cry since my cat of sixteen years passed away about three years ago. When it happened, I had short fits of crying for days.

I haven't cried since.

My friend's cat died a couple of days ago. We live together, and I did what I could to handle his body while my friend was driving home.

I tried my best to get his cold body into a more ""comfortable"" position before the rigor mortis got too bad.

I left him on a soft blanket while I went to the store. I picked out two of the softest towels I could find in a rich royal blue color. I lined the inside of the box that was to be his coffin with one, and wrapped him up in the other. 

I cleaned off the coffee table, lit some candles, and placed the box ontop. Holding a private wake while waiting for my friend to return home.

I heard her car, and held the door open for her. I didn't say anything until she asked me where he was.

I pointed with my head to the box.

As I stood by the door and watched her face grow sadder and more distressed in the milliseconds that past in the time it took her to open the box and see him. I felt tears prickle at my eyes.

The shear amount of empathy I felt. The amount I'm still feeling for her mixed along side my own grief. 

And not a single tear.

When I was a kid I could cry over anything.

I spent a lot of time in middle school trying to hold back my tears.

In high school I was having mental break downs every other month or so.

When I moved out, and I had a bad or just long day at work, I would take a long hot shower and cry. I don't know if that was healthy, but it was a release.

I want that release again.

The entire time my friend was crying, sometimes to the point of throwing up, I was sitting on the couch, waiting.

We drove to her grandparents' house where she has an apple tree planted. her boyfriend and I spent the better part of an hour digging hole to put the little guy in.

I kept thinking about going to the ASPCA with my friend about five years ago. Looking at all the cats they had.

I fell in love with two cats. A grouchy but fluffy gray tabby, and a little black kitten with a funny name.

We took each of them out, and played with them. I tried not to weigh in on my friend's choice at all. This was a milestone achievement in our adult lives. 18, freshly moved out, about to finally give into that impulse of getting an animal because we could.

My friend picked the little black kitten with the funny name.

I kept thinking about all the times he would climb on top of the fridge, or the weird space that exists between the ceiling and the cabinets. How he ate an entire sandwich baggie of weed. The pictures in my phone where my friend and I put him in a harness and leash to see snow for the first time in his life. The time i wasn't wearing pants and he jumped on me with his claws out and I screamed so loud the neighbors called the police.

I kept digging. We had a hole about four feet deep and wide.

The friend group along with some my friend's family had all come to our impromptu funeral for a cat, because how else are a bunch of childless 20-somethings going to spend a Monday afternoon?

Those of us who had stories with the cat shared them. My friend started crying again as she lowered his box-coffin into the ground. We all threw our handfuls of dirt into the grave, and I still couldn't cry.

I didn't shed a single tear as I shoveled the red earth onto the box. when we put rocks about six inches from the top to keep out wild animals. Not even a prickle as I patted down the returned topsoil.

I feel awful.

I come home and there's one less cat to greet me. There's no black blob in the corner of my eye asking for a piece of my dinner or breakfast. There's an empty space on the couch. 

I'll never see his handsome little face again, or feel his deep rumbling purrs when I'd scratch under his chin.

He's gone.

He's gone and I can't cry. 

I just stay awake, thinking about how awful I feel.

I see his medication on top of the microwave because we haven't thrown it away yet. I think about how much he hated taking it, but relished in the Delectable's sitting next to it.

I cannot cry, and I hate it. I have all these feelings in my stomach and chest and I want to cry. I want to cry so bad, just to get a little bit of this grief out of my system, but I can't.",1,1729265587.0,offmychest,0,0.99,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

Also, today is my birthday 🥳

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, and Lorcana. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is probably The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I watched all the SAW movies last month to kick off spooky season, and right now I'm making my way through the Friday the 13th movies.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' a Japanese and a Spanish course on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

1g6kvfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_gayaanger/comments/1g6kvfv/erasmus_adventure_learning_about_ecology/,🌍 Erasmus Adventure: Learning About Ecology & Sustainability! 🌱,"I just got back from an incredible Erasmus project where I had the chance to learn all about ecology and sustainability. It was such a transformative experience, and I couldn’t wait to share everything I learned with my friends back home! 

The project opened my eyes to the global environmental crisis we’re facing today. We studied some of the biggest ecological disasters in history, like oil spills, deforestation, and plastic pollution in the oceans. Hearing about how these events have affected wildlife, ecosystems, and human health around the world really drove home the urgency of taking action.

We also learned about the current ecological situations in different countries. Some nations are leading the way with innovative solutions, like green energy and waste reduction programs, while others are still struggling with environmental challenges. It was inspiring to see how much can be done when people come together to protect the planet, but it’s clear that there’s still so much work to do.

One of the most valuable takeaways for me was realizing how small changes in our daily lives can make a big difference. Here are some simple actions me and my friends decided to take:

Reduce single-use plastics: Try reusable bags, bottles, and containers instead of plastic ones.

Compost: Turn food waste into something useful, like we did with old tea leaves for the flower bombs!

Choose natural products: From cleaning supplies to skincare, there are eco-friendly alternatives that are better for the planet and our health.

Save energy: Turn off lights and appliances when not in use, and consider energy-efficient options.

Eat less meat: Even reducing meat consumption a few days a week can have a positive environmental impact.

On top of these practical tips, I taught my friends some fun, sustainable DIYs:                                                   

🌸 Flower Bombs: We made these seed balls with old tea leaves as compost, clay, and wildflower seeds. It’s a fun and easy way to help local pollinators and brighten up green spaces! 🌼

🌿 Clay Face Masks: Natural and super gentle on the skin. I showed how to mix clay, water, and essential oils for a refreshing self-care treat. No chemicals, just pure natural goodness! 💆‍♀️

☕ Coffee Scrub: Don’t throw away your coffee grounds! I showed how to turn them into an exfoliating scrub—great for your skin and for reducing waste! ♻️

Being part of this project made me realize that every little effort counts. We all have the power to make positive changes for the environment. 🌎✨

1g6kv6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_OutrageousSpread8706/comments/1g6kv6d/update_my_wife_is_back_home/,UPDATE - My wife is back home ,"
Yep. Feel free to flame me in the comments or in the DMs but I think at the end I did good decision. I have many reasons why I decided to let her come back home.

LONG UPDATE

Kids are without any doubt the biggest reason. 98%. They went to see psychologist again in monday. Again, one by one. The lady told me my younger son is dealing with all of this tougher and tougher. He told her that he is having tough time to concentrate in the school and that my older son is making huge pressure on him whenever they are alone. He also told her that he thinks I am angry at him because of everything he said last week to her how he misses my wife. Then she told me my older son is very stubborn and refuses to talk about things she wants to know. He told her he thinks he didn't do anything wrong by ""protecting"" me. He also said again that my wife is bad person and doesn't want her near me or him. I just don't know what to do about this. If I attack him then he will become angry at me and he will feel alone. If I speak nicely with him and explain him this is just between me and her like I did a lot of times then he still has opinion like this. At the end she told me next time she would like to see my wife and me with my younger son in the session. 

We came home, I talked again with both of them. I could feel tension between them. They are 7 and almost 9. They should worry about toys, sports, school...not about who should they support between me and my wife...I called my wife and told her she needs to come with me and younger son. She agreed immediately. She was in sunday on their football practice again. They saw her and didn't say anything so she stayed till the end. We went again in wednesday to see psychologist. She was waiting for us. Psychologist told me she wants to speak first with my wife and younger son. So me and older son were in the waiting room. After about 30 minutes, psychologist invited me inside. I saw my wife and son crying and she was hugging him. I didn't say anything, I was just standing and looking at them. Then my wife told me in my own language  ""I am so sorry, please forgive me."" I responded with very short, but very harsh sentence in my own language again. She understands very good my language but younger son doesn't at all. I honestly wanted to throw her from the building when I saw that. I can't believe what she did to my life. 

We talked a little bit where my son said he wants her to come back and that he wants everything to be the same like it used to be. He misses her a lot. He loves me a lot but her also and he misses her. Ok. Psychologist told him to leave the room and be with my older son while she speaks with us alone. She told us we need to make some plan. Either she comes back and we try to be best parents as we can or he needs to start spending time with her. But he refuses to go where she lives right now. My wife was just watching at me with the tears on her face probably waiting for me to be some guy from those Spanish telenovelas who will hug and kiss her, forgive her everything and spend the rest of her life with her...

Anyway, we left and then for the first time in my entire life I saw my sons fighting. Not physically exactly but there was some pushing. I stopped them and my older son started to yell how my younger son is a crybaby and that he doesn't love me. Younger son was crying again and my wife hugged him and told to my older something like ""Hey D, please stop, I am so sorry for everything..."" He didn't stop. He started again to yell at her that he will not listen to her...so I took him for the hand and we went to speak in the hallway. For the first time since all of this I was very angry at him and I wasn't the most calmed person in that moment. He said he wants to go home. I told him he needs to go on his session and then on football practice. He eventually went to speak with psychologist. I, younger son and wife were waiting for him. Son was sitting between us 2. Wife and son were speaking with each other. I was just looking at one point on the floor. 60 minutes of her watching me and saying how sorry she is and that everything will be ok in my own language so my younger son can't understand... Psychologist said to me my older son refuses to talk and even told her he doesn't like her. I apologized and my son just told me to drive him home. He refused to go on football practice. I apologized to him for my earlier behaviour but he said he doesn't care and refused to speak with me. I tried to persuade him to go on practice but no chance. He is so stubborn. My wife drove my younger son to practice and was with him and drove him back. I went home with my older son. Told Melody she can go home. My son immediately went in his room and told me to leave him alone. I know I should be much more nicer to him before but I am really tired with all of this. My wife brought our younger son back, she spent some time with our daughter and I asked her to leave me alone and she left. 

I was thinking whole day yesterday what to do. Craziest thing is that the only person I talked to that told me to not bring her back was her father. He told me she deserves everything bad and all the consequences. My family, her mother and brother, majority of the friends told me they will support whatever decision I make. Rest of the friends told me to bring her back home because she knows she fucked up and is very remorseful and kids want that. My daughter will be 4 very soon. She doesn't understand anything. But she loves my wife and is crazy about her. Younger son the same and then I have older son who is doing all of these shenanigans. Wife didn't call me but again she sent texts how sorry she is and that she is the only one responsible for behaviour for all of our kids. No shit Sherlock...At the end of the day I decided to bring her back. I called my friend and his wife to be with my kids while I go talk to her. I didn't call my wife because I didn't want her to be prepared for anything I will say. I came in 8:30PM to her friend's place. Friend was shocked to see me and told me my wife is in her room. I opened the door and a lot of tissues were there, she looks again like shit. Whatever. All 3 of us sat down in the living room. 

I told her she can come back. She was shocked at first. Then when she realized I am serious she started to smile and went to hug me but I pushed her away so she hugged her friend. Not gonna lie, I haven't seen her happier in my life. I told her everything what is on my soul and in my mind. I told her I don't care about ""her changes"" that she promised. I don't care if she goes to IC, if she is staying in the house whole day, even if she works, she can open social media profiles again I don't care...(Btw, she answered 5 questions on polygraph after the interview. She answered all 5 answers correctly per polygraph. I saw the results. Apparently she is more attracted to me than to AP and sex with me is much better, she never cheated on me before AP, she loves me, she wasn't bored or unhappy during the marriage and never had any emotional feeling for AP and she cut the contact with him because she wanted that. So you would say I should be happy because of this? I am actually more disgusted by her because obviously she had everything and still did what she did.) I told her I want 5 things from her. 

1. To not cry in front of kids.

2. To not bother our older son. When he is ready they will talk.

3. To not bother me. 

4. Respect Melody. I decided I will keep her. She is great around kids. Kids love her. My wife should start working soon so Melody can be more with kids and also she can drive them to school and from the school and that will help me a lot because I am at the end with my energy. And she cooks great. 

5. To not bring any guy near our house.

Obviously she accepted with the huge smile all 1st 4 rules. Then at the 5th she said she doesn't want anyone and will never ever look on any guy except me. I expected her to answer something like this so I said something like ""Never mind. I didn't bring my girlfriend when you were not there and this rule is valid for me also."" Smile on her face disappeared but 101% she knows I said that just to hurt her because she knows me better than anyone. Too bad I didn't know her that well...I told her divorce papers are 99% ready and if she doesn't follow one of these rules she will be served immediately and kicked out again from the house. She agreed on everything. Told her to come back tomorrow(today) in the morning when I am at work and sons are in school.

When I came back home her friend texted me. She is a great person and she helped me a lot during this process. She helped my wife and was the only person to be there for her 24/7 but was also very strict with her and supported me. Anyway, she says she is glad I gave my wife chance to come back and that my wife is very happy and so thrilled and will behave better than ever. 

I talked with Melody later. I told her I want her to be honest with me and tell me if my wife ever becomes rude to her. I want her to tell me that and I want her to update me with everything that is happening. She said she will. Today I was at work and my wife came back with her friend. Melody told me my wife apologized to her for that scene before 2 weeks and she wanted to thank her for everything she did around our kids and that our daughter loves her. Melody helped her with her belongings and them 2 together had a coffee and talked where my wife cried in front of her because how much she hurt me...and my wife was with our daughter playing all the time until me and boys came home.

And then the toughest part was to pick my sons from the school. I left the job earlier just because of this. My younger finished with the school earlier so I explained him everything and he was so happy. He was always the happiest and loudest kid ever full of life and during all of this he became very quiet. Now he has that innocent genuine smile on his face again. I told my older later the same thing and he didn't say anything. He was just looking through the window of the car. When we came home my younger son went to hug my wife and they were kissing each other but my older just walked in his room like no one is around him. I followed him and talked with him at least 20 minutes. He was without any emotion. So cold. He requested to leave him alone because he will take a nap. 

Melody was doing some chores, my wife was cooking and my younger son and daughter were around her. I had flashbacks then. This is how it was before all of all this...ok, Melody wasn't around but my wife would cook dinner everyday and kids were around playing, jumping...etc. Then I remembered what she did and I felt disgusted again. I went to sleep also. 

Then dinner happened. Melody left and there we are! 5 of us! Good old times, huh? Without any doubt the most awkward 30 minutes in my entire life. My wife is feeding my daughter(btw my daughter was the only one talking during those 30 minutes), younger son is eating and watching tv, wife is watching me every second like she is some kind of spy and my older son didn't say a word and was looking at me all the time with the look ""Dad, I love you but you are pu*sy."" Maybe I am. Probably I am. I think I did good decision but also one part of me thinks I did horrific decision. I guess time will tell. My older son went after the dinner in the room and I followed him again. We played videogames a little bit and then before I left I told him I will be always there for him and he can tell me anything what bothers him. He looked better after that. I was a little bit in the living room, kids were already in their beds and then for the first time my wife approached me. She told me she is blessed with another chance and will respect everything what I told her and that she will still do all of the things she promised in ""her changes"" because that is really what she wants and the least she can do for me after everything. I didn't say a word, I was just looking at her. She went to sleep in the guest room and now I am writing this. 

I don't know. I hope I did the good thing. Younger son and daughter are very happy and their smiles are the most important to me. Older son will hopefully be better. And about me...well, I really don't care. To be honest it helps me a lot that she is here. I have more free time. I had very tough time to do all of the things. My work + driving them to/from the school, driving them to practices, psychologist, friends, be with them at home, helping them with homeworks, be dad and mom in the same time...And honestly even if this situation ruins possibility for me to find some other woman in the near future I am okay with that. I don't care. I don't know how much we will be in this situation but as long as my kids are great I am fine even if that means I will never be truly happy again and never have any other partner. My kids are most important for me and I would give my life for them let alone my sexual/emotional life. I could never imagine allowing her to come back but honestly when you live this shit moments daily with your kids then it is very tough...if we are from the same country and living there then I would divorce her already. In this situation I truly believe this is correct decision for now, at least for my kids.

Thank you all.

1g6ktzi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g6ktzi,Titan Sheer - so effortlessly elegant 💜,"Hey fragrance lovers,

I just wanted to gush a little about Titan Sheer—a hidden gem from the Indian fragrance world that I’ve recently fallen in love with. If you’re someone who enjoys subtle yet memorable scents that add a touch of class to your day, this one might be for you.

Sheer greets you with a refreshing burst of zesty citrus and crisp green notes—like the feeling of a cool morning breeze. It then settles into a delicate floral heart, where white lilies and jasmine come together to add a soft, feminine charm without being overpowering. What makes it stand out, though, is the sheer sophistication of its musk and sandalwood base. It’s warm, smooth, and lingers beautifully on the skin throughout the day.

To me, Sheer is like slipping into your favorite flowy dress on a bright, sunlit day. It’s light and playful but still leaves an impression—a scent you wear for yourself more than for others. Think of it as the perfect fragrance for brunch dates, coffee runs, or just days when you want to feel quietly confident.

And the best part? It’s affordable I actually got it from Tata Palette app with a 20% credit card discount on my whole cart so it was this and a mac lipstick all for 3900 so.. I feel .. Titan has really nailed the balance between quality and price, so you get a fragrance that smells luxe without breaking the bank.

If you’re into light, feminine fragrances that still have character, give Titan Sheer a shot. I’d love to hear what you guys think if you’ve tried it! 💫",6,1729265450.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,1,0.88,False

So we looked and looked until a puppy was found,

She was the runt of the litter, so tiny, so sweet,

With cute little earsies, and wrinkles and feet,

Her brothers and sisters wouldn’t let her get fed,

Human mom gave milk with a sponge instead

We were quickly taken with the little dog tot,

We were quickly in love not a little, a lot,

Now this is the part when things start to get messy,

We decided to name our new pupper Jessie

Her adventures started almost on day one,

And we cried to ourselves “what have we done?”

Her first trick was helped be being so small,

And helped again because our yard had no wall,

It was fenced and contained as all yards should be,

BUT Jessie kept on escaping because she was so wee,

The gap in the fence boards was really quite small,

But that didn’t stop Jessie from escaping next door,

There was a French bulldog she just HAD to meet,

Jessie went over to visit at least 10 times a week.

One day messy Jessie found chewing gum – yum!

But it wasn’t normal, just minty and fun,

See it had caffeine like ten cups of coffee,

So for an hour or two Jessie went “Whee! Whee! Whee!”

Another effect, as adults can tell you,

Is the irresistible urge it gives you to poo,

It was not big and really not funny,

As Jessie’s legs were not the only things runny.

And the woofing! The barking! All of the noise!

At strangers, at shadows, at all of her toys,

Her breeding was that she could hunt underground,

And go “woof woof woof woof” when a badger was found.

But she’s never buried in a tunnel down under

So even though little she is louder than thunder

And Jessie is greedy as greedy can be

Less of a dog more like a little piggy

Food is her everything, there is never enough,

She thinks portion control is us being tough,

So she’ll sneak a treat where ever she can,

The table, the trash, straight out of your hand,

And her favorite snack we can’t keep under locks,

Is feasting out of her brothers cat box,

What’s even worse than even this is,

She’ll then jump on your lap and try to give kisses.

Messica Jessica -why do we keep you around?

Despite all the above you’re our favorite hound,

As gross, loud, and naughty as this pupper can be,

Other times her behavior makes us all go tee-hee,

And acting like she can understand every word,

(but won’t if it’s a message she doesn’t want heard)

She has a gold medal in being a snuggler,

A lover, a hugger and sugar sweet nuzzler.

On one hand the worst, one hand the best,

That leaves all feeling a little obsessed

Though our lives have never been any more messy

We can’t imagine being without our little Jessie

----

> *""I can do hard things."" —Ms. Rachel* 

Around 1pm on December 2, the messages started to roll in:

>""Yeah brother!!!! Hardrock!!!!""

>""Waitlist for Hardrock! Yeah brother!! Hope you get in!!""

>""7!!!!""

I had been selected seventh in the Men's Never waitlist for the Hardrock 100 Endurance Run. THE Hardrock. The big granddaddy of US mountain runs. My singular running goal for almost a decade. I had heard about Hardrock back when I started running in 2012, worked my way up to finishing a qualifying race in 2016, and started applying for the lottery immediately. I had been ""lucky"" to get selected so quickly.

Seventh was an exciting but awkward spot on the waitlist. Low enough that I wasn't guaranteed to get into the run, but high enough that I would have to train. Hard.

Like the name suggests, Hardrock is one of the most difficult 100 milers in the world. Starting in the old mining town of Silverton, the course makes a single massive loop through the heart of Colorado's rugged San Juan Mountains, crossing multiple 13,000 foot passes and summitting a 14er. The average elevation is over 11,000 feet. The run is an homage to the hard rock miners who built many of the trails and jeep roads to extract precious metals from these brutal, gorgeous mountains.

##**Training**

(This section is unlikely to be interesting to most people. You should probably skip it. The actual race report is down below.)

My training volume has been hit and miss over the years, but I was determined not to show up to Silverton unprepared. The only minor, teensy complication was that, for the first time in my life I would be balancing 100 miler training with fatherhood. Yes, it turns out that my first official race after the birth of my daughter Emily would also be the most personally meaningful race I had ever run. No pressure!

Okay, there was a secondary complication if I'm being honest: How do you train for a race that you might not actually run? The answer to that ended up being straightforward. I would simply gaslight myself into believing that it was a 100 percent guarantee. And if I ended up not running it, I could deal with the emotional fallout later. What could go wrong?

As for the actual nuts and bolts of training, I no longer had the time for 8-10 hour meandering long runs every Saturday. I needed to be strategic. The first order of business was to lose some of my ""dad bod"" weight, which meant cutting out my morning bagel and evening beer(s) during the week. I dropped from 175ish pounds to about 160 before race day.

I also adopted the unholy trinity of aging ultrarunners: stretching, strength training, and cross training. I despise every one of those things, but I could feel the benefits almost immediately in my runs, so I stuck with it. My hip bursitis, IT band pain, sciatica, and various other old-person ailments gradually improved even as I ramped up my mileage. I suppose I should have started doing all of this stuff years ago.

Instead of making the long drive to the Catskills, Adirondacks, or Whites to find sustained climbs on the weekends, I spent my lunch breaks on an incline treadmill set to 20%, knocking out 3,000-5,000 foot workouts while watching Hardrock videos on YouTube. Saturday's long runs generally started around 4 or 5am so I could be back at home for Emily's breakfast. Occasionally I would run a second time during her morning nap or in the evening when she went to bed. I did manage to sneak away for my annual Everesting attempt in March and a Cactus to Clouds run in May, which both gave me confidence in my training.

My peak weeks were a respectable 60mi/20k', 61mi/20k', 46mi/20k'. By the time we got to Colorado, I had logged 350,000 feet of cumulative elevation gain in the past six months.

Now I just had to get into the dang thing.

##**The moment of truth... or is it?**

We landed in Denver still not knowing whether I was going to run Hardrock or not. I had gradually moved up to first on the waitlist, but time was running out. Flights, hotels, and a sprinter van had all been booked months in advance, and my crew/pacer dream team had made plans to travel out too. We collectively held our breaths waiting for some movement on the list.

In the meantime, Alex, Em, and I had some vacationing to do. My top priority was to get Emily to the summit of a 14er. I was halfway up Quandary Peak with a sleeping baby on my back when Alex stopped to answer a work email. I figured I'd take my phone off airplane mode to check my emails too, only to see a voicemail from an unknown number.

>Voicemail: Hi Ryan. Dale Garland, Hardrock Endurance Run. When you get this message, if you would, please give me a call. Thanks!  
>Alex: Call him back! Call him back right now!!""

I dialed back.

>Me: Hi Dale, this is Ryan Thorpe returning your call.  
>Dale: Hey, Ryan. Where are you right now?  
>Me: I'm on the side of Quandary Peak.  
>Dale: That seems like driving distance to Silverton.  
>Me: That was the idea.  
>Dale: Well, I have a bib with your name on it if you're interested.  
>Me: I would be happy to take that off your hands.

With my limited reception, I formally accepted my invitation on Ultrasignup and paid the registration fee right then and there. Then Emily summited her first 14er. Also, we saw mountain goats. It was an exciting day all around.

I posted the good news to social media, and almost immediately got a flurry of congratulatory messages and a few asking if I had taken Zach Miller's spot. Unbeknownst to me, he had just announced that he'd had an emergency appendectomy and didn't know if he could recover in time to run.

This ended up causing a bit of drama for me (yes, I'm going to make Zach's appendectomy about me for a moment; bear with me), because a few days later he announced that his doctor had cleared him to run. If I had Zach's spot, was there a possibility that Dale would now rescind my entry? The Hardrock Instagram page had posted a picture of me and then immediately deleted it. Plus, the lottery webpage still showed me on the waitlist. Was this all a big mistake? I was mostly sure that the organizers would honor my entry, but I couldn't shake the nagging feeling that I was going to go home empty handed. Between these thoughts and the lingering headache that I always get for the first few days at altitude, I became a sullen, miserable prick in the week leading up to Hardrock. Sorry Alex and Em!

Finally, the day of the runner check in came, and I got my number. My mindset immediately flipped from the anxiety of ""Oh shit, I'm not running Hardrock"" to the anxiety of ""Oh shitfuckshit, I'm running Hardrock!"" I calmed my nerves by buying every piece of Hardrock swag available at their expo. I also made it my mission to introduce Emily to all of the most badass women we could find: Courtney Dauwalter, Anna Frost, Maggie Guterl, Stephanie Case, and Tara Warren. Pro tip: If you're too nervous to talk to famous people, just tell them your adorable baby girl wants to meet them.

##**Cruising with Legends (miles 0-11)**

By the time I made it to the starting corral, I was positively vibrating with excitement. This was it: my dream race. Not only that, but I had my wife Alex, my daughter Emily, and some of my best friends (Jess, Boy Alex, and Virginia) there to crew and pace. The dream team for my dream race!

Despite all the adrenaline, I started at my usual conservative pace. So conservative, in fact, that before we had even left the town of Silverton I was the very last runner. Given the amount of older Hardrock veterans at the start, I was a little surprised not to see anyone else walking, but I wasn't overly concerned. Back in 2019 I started the Ouray 100 in last place and worked my way up to 19th by the finish. Let's see how many people I could pass today!

It didn't take long before I caught up to a small pack of runners. I immediately recognized one of them as YouTuber and prolific race director Jamil Coury, who once ran a 29 hour Hardrock in his younger days but had shown up undertrained this year. A few minutes later, 17-time Hardrock finisher Chris Twiggs came charging out of the bushes, explaining simply, ""I had to take a massive shit."" I had found the right crowd to run with. I also spent a few minutes running with American Ultrarunning Hall of Famer Pam Reed, who would tell me jokingly afterwards that I wasn't breathing nearly hard enough for a New Jersey runner. Nice to have some validation from a legend!

The pack slowly spread out and Chris and I ended up running as a duo. I took the opportunity to ask his advice about pacing, nutrition, which sections to carry extra water, etc. Normally this is the kind of stuff I would figure out weeks before a race, but I'd had sort of a mental block about studying the Hardrock course ahead of time. I think this was my small way of protecting myself against the potential disappointment of not getting in. Chris was a wealth of knowledge and was thrilled to have someone to share it all with. We reached the first aid station together quite a bit behind the splits I had given my crew, but I was feeling great and soaking in the experience.

At the pre-run briefing, Dale had described Hardrock as a ""culinary tour of the San Juans,"" explaining that each aid station prides itself on cooking gourmet food. I am typically pretty good at eating during races (and outside of races), and in that moment I decided that I was going to get my money's worth at every opportunity. In my three minute stop at KT, I consumed a full Denny's breakfast worth of bacon and pancakes.

##**Views for Days... Literally (miles 11-28)**

The next section was the crown jewel of Hardrock: Grant Swamp Pass. Despite the name, this might be the most beautiful place in the world. A remote mountain pass with Island Lake on one side and a sweeping view of the San Joaquin ridge on the other. The top of the pass is guarded on both sides by unrelentingly steep scree.

The climb up took a bit of effort, but I was too distracted by the scenery to care. I passed the Joel Zucker memorial at the top and placed a rock on it. It's impossible to convey the severity of the terrain on the descent from the pass, [so instead I'll just link an old video of world class mountain runners struggling to stay upright on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4qsrSsPRns).

I managed to mostly stay upright through this section through an extensive application of upper body movement. That is to say, I flailed my arms wildly as my feet turned over at a thousand steps per minute. I reached the bottom with some scraped palms, both shoes full of debris, and a big stupid grin on my face. I sat down to empty my shoes and recognized Jenny Capel from the briefing. She had applied for ten years before getting in and had been recognized by the race director for her tenacity.

""Was that descent worth the wait?"" I inquired.  
""Fuck no."" was the response.

She would go on to finish, hopefully enjoying the remaining sections a bit more than that one.

I cruised into Chapman aid station in 115th place, having passed thirty people in the first 18 miles. I had told my crew not to make the rugged drive to this aid station, but I was instead greeted by my NY/NJ running friends Elaine, Tiffany, Devang, and Nobu, who had come out to crew for two more of my NY/NJ friends Stephen and Jun. They helped refill my bottles and got me back on the trail after just four minutes. Another lightning quick stop! Stephen and Jun were just ahead, and I hoped I could catch them and spend some time together.

The climb up Oscar's Pass is kind of an early crux of the race. Fully exposed to the afternoon sun and rising almost 3,000 feet in 2.4 miles, it can be a demoralizing climb. On the bright side, like the rest of the course it's breathtakingly beautiful. I passed the time by talking to a Utah-based runner named David Fuller, who would pass me on all the climbs, and whom I would pass back on every descent for the next 30+ hours. Just before the top of the pass, I caught Jun and we chatted for a few minutes. He was moving well but the altitude seemed to be taking its toll on him. He would end up having stomach issues but pushing through for his first Hardrock finish in 46 hours.

The descent into Telluride began as a talus slope but gradually transformed into flowy singletrack. I soaked in the extra oxygen as I dropped below 10,000' for the first time in many hours. I was still riding the high of running THE HARDROCK, I could hear the music thumping, and I was about to see my wife and daughter for the first time since the start. I could barely contain my emotions as I ran into the aid station, now in 89th place.

In my memory, Telluride was a long stop because I scarfed down a burrito, two slices of brisket, and a bunch of watermelon, I changed my socks, and my crew refilled my bottles while I told them about seeing Jun. In reality, all of this happened in just seven minutes. A far cry from Ludovic Pommeret's insane one minute turnaround but still respectable for a mid-pack runner.

I planted a big sweaty kiss on Alex and Emily and I was on my way again.

##**A Quick Stop at Kroger's for Snacks and Tequila (miles 28-44)**

The Kroger's Canteen aid station is the stuff of legends. Perched precariously at the top of the 13,000' Virginius Pass within a gap in the rocks that's barely bigger than a dining room table, Kroger's is staffed by the hardiest volunteers you'll ever meet. Alex and I had tried to hike to it a few weeks before the 2017 Hardrock but got turned around by deep snow. I was looking forward to finally reaching this mythical place.

All I had to do was climb 4,400 feet to get there.

The initial climb out of Telluride was uninspiring, rising steeply up dusty dirt roads as the afternoon sun bore down on us. Vandals had removed a few course markings, and I briefly followed another runner off course before checking my map and correcting our mistake. I heard rumbling in the distance and wondered if we would get a thunderstorm.

Hardrock is held in July as a compromise between allowing the snow to melt off the trails and avoiding the peak of the summer monsoon season. At the Ouray 100 in 2019, a bad thunderstorm had derailed my race. I had not carried enough spare clothing then, and perhaps as an overreaction to that trauma, I was now carrying enough gear to waterproof myself from head to toe. I was thankful for this decision as I imagined myself getting pummeled by a hail storm at 13,000'. Luckily, this was all a moot point as the storm passed harmlessly in the distance, dissipating the afternoon heat nicely in the process.

I finally caught up to my friend Stephen England later in the climb. A type-1 diabetic, he has finished some of the hardest races in the world, making it clear that his disease doesn't limit him whatsoever. His blood sugar was a bit low and he sipped on a Dole fruit cup as he hiked up the steep slope.

I called out ""Hey, it's Stephen America,"" which is our little inside joke that only I find funny.

Once again it was great to run into an east coast friend in the middle of the Colorado wilderness. Unfortunately our pace didn't quite match up and I had a date to attend up at 13,000' so I wished him well and continued on my way. He would end up finishing in 41 hours after a spectacular rally (aka project Saturday).

As the trail snaked its way around Mendota Peak on an ancient mining trail, I scanned the craggy ridge above me looking for a gap where it would be possible to wedge an aid station. I couldn't imagine where you could fit anything useful in this jumble of rocks, but suddenly I heard cheering. Directly above me was Kroger's Canteen.

""You're almost there!"" someone called out.

I held up a finger and responded ""Be with you in a moment,"" before snapping a picture of them.

Then I made the final scramble up to the aid station. It was getting chilly out, so I requested the hottest, saltiest food they could procure. Within seconds I received a handful of wonderfully crispy pan fried pierogis. It's also tradition to have a bit of tequila at Kroger's, so I asked for half a shot. I didn't see the drink being poured, but I heard a *glug glug glug* followed by a volunteer saying ""Whoa, that's a big half shot!""

Welp. Tradition is tradition, and maybe a little ethanol would give me the courage I needed for the vertical mile of descent into Ouray. Down the hatch!

I thanked the volunteers profusely and set to work on the first pitch of the descent. Like Grant Swamp Pass, this section was utter silliness: nearly vertical scree and snow at 13,000'. This kind of terrain has no business being part of a 100 miler, and that's exactly what makes the Hardrock course so special. I attempted a standing glissade down the wall of snow and immediately slipped onto my butt, sliding down the remaining section while burping up smoky mezcal.

I sat for a moment to empty snow and rocks from my shoes before realizing that I had nearly another mile of this kind of terrain ahead of me. I alternated between red-lining down impossibly steep, concrete-hard rock slides, resting on any stable rock, and then plunging downhill again. The terrain was like something straight out of Frozen Snot, but at altitude and with 32 miles on my legs. Insanity. Pure, wonderful, insanity!

After the initial chaos, the course turned onto Camp Bird Road, which is a nicely groomed dirt road. This is the most runnable section of the Hardrock course, but I resisted pushing the pace to make sure I didn't blow my quads too early. A string of 11-12 minute miles had me in the town of Ouray in 75th place with 15 hours elapsed.

##**The Long Dark Night (miles 44-58)**

I shuffled into Ouray just as the last bit of sunlight faded over the horizon. I was confident that I had paced myself well in the early miles and I was excited to have friends to run with for the remainder of the race. 

Fellow east coaster John Kemp was volunteering at Ouray and shuttled food from the aid station grill to my mouth like a mama bird. The culinary tour of the San Juans raged on as I devoured more brisket, a cheeseburger, an ice pop, and a Coke. Somehow I also managed to change my socks again, and I still made it out in eight minutes, now with my trusty training partner Jess keeping me company.

One vital omission from my feeding frenzy in Ouray was a coffee or an energy drink. I hadn't anticipated feeling sleepy at just 8pm, but a week of living in a Sprinter van with an 11 month old had left me severely sleep deprived going into the race. Jess - like all good pacers - is a prolific talker, and we often chat for the entirety of our training runs. But within a couple miles I found myself unable to muster the energy to respond to her. Despite her efforts (and despite being on the most dangerous section of the course), I was fading.

I grunted occasional responses as Jess did her best to keep my mind going with hypothetical questions like, ""If you could watch a concert by any three bands from history, who would you pick and what order would they perform?""

At the remote Engineer aid station, I asked for a coffee and a cup of ramen. I gulped them down like I was doing shots at a college bar and then realized that I was getting very cold very quickly. I put on every layer I had with me and called out ""See you later, Jess!"" I heard a squawk from her as she realized I was already leaving when she had only just gotten her own cup of Ramen. Luckily it only took a moment for her to catch up to me, and we were back to doing our 30min/mi march up to Engineer Pass.

The pass was marked by a blinking red light which was visible for an annoyingly long time. Climbing in the pitch black it was impossible to discern any progress toward that little blinky bastard. After an eternity, we finally made it to the top. I vaguely recall telling the light to go fuck itself, but that might have only happened in my mind.

The descent from the pass was on a relatively easy road but I couldn't find the will to run. We walked into the Animas Forks aid and I plopped down into a chair and announced to my crew that I would be taking a five minute nap. They bundled me in as many layers as they could find and set a timer. Despite my struggles, I had still moved up a few spots and now sat exactly in the middle of the pack at 70th place.

Usually I wake up from these cat naps feeling rejuvenated, but I couldn't get my mind to turn off and instead I just listened to the commotion in the aid station. Nevertheless, when the timer went off, I put my shoes back on and headed back onto the trail with Boy Alex.

##**The Lowest Point at the Highest Point (miles 58-93)**

>*""It’s gon’ be some work, you should pack a lunch for it"" —Prof*

Because of a road closure, my pacers would not be able to switch at Sherman like we had originally planned. This meant that Boy Alex would be pacing me from Animas Forks all the way to Cunningham Gulch, a 35 mile section with about 10,000 feet of climbing. Essentially he was doing a third of Hardrock while having to take care of a cranky baby. But Alex and I have shared a ton of miles on the trails together over the years, and living in the Wasatch he knows how to take care of himself and others in the mountains.

At 14,058', Handies Peak is the high point of the course. It is considered one of the easiest 14ers in Colorado, but the old saying holds true: there are no easy 14ers. That was particularly true after 22 hours of running at altitude. The sleep monster and the altitude monster teamed up on me big time here. When all was said and done, it took me three hours to cover the five miles to the summit. Thankfully, we were greeted by a beautiful sunrise. [And even better, someone from Mountain Outpost was there to film it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v77j9mAuHpE), so I have been able to appreciate the beauty of this section in retrospect.

The descent was milder than some of the previous ones, but I was wobbly on my feet from the sleep deprivation. I kept tripping and slipping on the loose rocks, until finally in a fit of despair I threw myself to the ground and rage napped. Alex was a few minutes behind me, having stopped for a bathroom break. I thankfully heard him coming and gave a little wave to make sure he didn't pass by my corpse.

After another five minute snooze, we continued our trek to the Burrows backcountry aid for a quick stop, and then a short jog into the larger Sherman aid station. Once again, despite ten minutes of napping and probably an hour of time lost to inefficient shambling, I had moved up to 53rd place. That fact really underscores how difficult the night can be in a mountain race.

Usually I come into each aid station with a plan, but I was so deliriously tired that I spent minutes just wandering around searching for something that would get me going again. I have a distant, cloudy memory of eating a breakfast burrito. That was probably tasty, I guess. I think I also chugged coffee. As a new father, I easily go through half a pot of coffee on a normal day, and that caffeine tolerance means I need to consume a positively stupid amount to stay alert during races. I distinctly remember that Elaine, Tiffany, and Devang all made the white-knuckle drive over Cinnamon Pass to see everyone at Sherman, and it was great to have some friends for support at a moment when my brain felt like a bowl of pudding.

Anyway, someone or something must have convinced me to get back onto the trail, and I found myself wandering up the gentle climb to Cataract Lake. I recall Alex saying how beautiful and unexpected the lush forest was here, but I didn't have enough mental bandwidth to give a shit. Above tree line the scenery got even better, and somewhere in here Alex wandered off trail and [captured this video of me](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9zzdqFv052/).

This is another one of those moments that I'm grateful to have a recording to look back on, because at the time I wasn't able to appreciate how stunning the landscape was.

My mind started to come back online here, but the terrain made it difficult to get into a rhythm. The trail was narrow, rutted, and constantly crisscrossed Pole Creek. Rather than attempt to run, I just tried to maintain a fast power hike, which seemed to work well. However, it was becoming clear on the climbs that my lungs were shredded from thirty hours of running at altitude. Each deep breath resulted in a small coughing fit, and I was unable to generate any power despite my legs still feeling strong. I drowned out the noise of my own wheezing by blasting my rap playlist straight from my phone speakers. My apologies to any marmots who don't like Run the Jewels.

The last climb up and over Green Mountain was hilariously steep over cross country terrain. We were coming to the end of Alex's gargantuan pacing section. With a final 1,600' descent in just over a mile, we arrived at Cunningham Gulch, mile 93. I gave Alex a big hug, kissed my Alex and Emily, grabbed some snacks from the aid station, and headed out with Jess for the final nine miles.

##**The Home Stretch (miles 93-102)**

I had originally told the crew that 36 hours might be possible if I had a perfect race. I arrived at this estimate based on my 35:27 finish at TWOT, which is supposedly similar in difficulty to Hardrock. With 36:22 elapsed and time being linear, this goal appeared to be unlikely. I had also mentioned that anything under 40 hours would be pretty satisfying, but that the bottom line was to carry Emily through the finisher chute and kiss the rock. This mental image had been propelling me since the start of the race.

But still, the allure of 40 hours was strong. That gave us 3:38 to go the last nine miles: two miles straight up Little Giant Pass and seven miles downhill to the finish. On paper that sounds reasonable, but my lungs were staging a full scale rebellion. I was breathing so frantically on the climb that Jess turned around multiple times to ask if I was ok.

""Yeah, that's just what my lungs do now,"" I responded.

I had made the wise decision before the race not to have my watch display mile splits. If it had, I would have seen a split of 65 minutes for the first mile of the climb. Granted, that mile had 1,200 feet of ascent, but I believe it to be my slowest ever in a race. Mile two was a significant improvement at just 59 minutes. Dang. Speedy.

We reached the top just in time for sunset. Jess asked if I wanted to stop for a picture and I flipped her the double bird and sprinted away. Or according to her recollection, I sort of grunted with ennui and kept walking. It's unknowable which one of us is remembering this correctly.

That left us with 1:35ish for the last seven miles. Not terrible. We just had to average 13-14 minutes per mile on some relatively mild downhill trails, if I was remembering this section correctly. I've certainly run faster than that on the final descent of other races.

What I hadn't remembered from hiking this section many years ago, was that the first mile was more loose scree.

""Wow this section is pretty tough, Je-oof!"" I said as my feet slid out from under me.

I heard a yelp from behind me and saw Jess also sitting on the trail in a dust cloud. Folks, only the best pacers will time their falls to coincide with yours. It's called teamwork.

That first mile ended up being 19 minutes, which really ate into our cushion. As the terrain got better, Jess ran ahead and started pushing the pace, finding the best line through the rutted Jeep roads. I willed my quads to absorb each downhill step, audibly panting with each breath.

""Stay with me, Ryan. We can do 40 hours,"" she would call back every few minutes.  
""I'm fuckin' trying, brah."" is what I would have said if my lungs were still capable of speaking.

We picked up the pace: 14 minute mile, 13:12, 13:17. This was gonna be close. We hit a rolling section next to the Animas River and I forced myself to run every step through every creek crossing and every diabolical little uphill.

""Shitgoddamnitwhatthefuck?!"" Jess yelled as we reached yet another short steep climb and were forced to walk.

With a mile to go, Jess turned to me and said, ""We have seven minutes to do this. Do you want to go for it?""

And while yeah, it would have been cool to say that I closed out Hardrock with a 6:59 mile and finished under 40 hours, what I wanted more than that was to calmly pick up Emily and walk her through the finisher chute of the first ultramarathon that she ever saw Daddy run.

Also, I desperately had to poop and didn't like the idea of finishing with shit-filled shorts.

After I made a quick stop in the woods, we walked the final mile to the center of Silverton, making sure to break into a jog once we were within sight of the finish line crowd.

Then I gently picked up a very sleepy Emily who was wearing a very fuzzy bear suit.

And we kissed the rock.

Final time 40:14:42, 52nd place.

##**Closing Thoughts**

Finishing at 10pm and being dead tired for most of the race meant that I got a surprisingly good night of sleep. Alex nudged me awake around 6am to remind me that the Hardrock depletion mile was starting soon. I really wanted to get the full Hardrock experience so I trudged over to the Silverton track and did my best impression of a real runner. My legs felt surprisingly good, and I was on pace for a 6:40 mile through the first lap until my lungs reminded me that we were still at altitude. Whatever, it was fun.

The awards ceremony was held on the other end of town under gorgeous blue skies. They served an amazing breakfast and I got to spend some time sharing battle stories with Stephen, Jun, and our pacers. Then my crew spent the rest of the day soaking our feet in Animas River and sipping on local beer. It was a perfect way to end the weekend.

When I think back on this race months after the fact, the feeling that comes to mind is an overwhelming sense of gratitude. I can't adequately express how thankful I am for the opportunity to run this race and for the time and effort that my family and friends put into making it happen. Thank you to Alex and Emily for kisses, cheers, moral support, and allowing me to spend way too many hours on the weekends doing hill repeats at the Water Gap. Thanks to Jess and (Boy) Alex for pacing me through some of the toughest terrain I've ever seen and to Virginia for being on Emily duty so my Alex could focus on me at aid stations. And another huge thanks to Dale Garland and the Hardrock community for putting on such a world class event. This was a truly special experience. Congratulations to Stephen, Jun, and all the other new Hardrockers.

Oh and kudos to Emily's new BFF Courtney Dauwalter for breaking her own course record!

With the benefit of some time to reflect, I have accepted that I can have my dream race without running my dream time.

I still want to go back and break 40 hours though.",5,1729265329.0,Ultramarathon,0,0.86,False

She was reserved, but not shy and clearly interested in moving forward.

Over the next few days we made arrangements to meet at a local hotel for the next step. I have always paid my SBs a fixed monthly allowance that doesn't depend on how often we have sex.  So I had planned to suggest that when we meet at the hotel. A few days before the meeting, she surprised me by calling to discuss a few things.  First, condoms would be required.  Second, it would cost $$$. Normally, I arrange to have myself and any new SB tested so that condoms aren't needed, and she seemed open to that.  In this case, I'll need more information about her boyfriend before I'm sure whether condoms are needed. I hate wearing them, so I hope we can get past that. I'm less sure what to think about the ppm part of the deal. Does anyone have any advice on that?  It feels very different from an allowance-based situation and I'm not sure if I like it.

Mostly developed with ChatGPT o1-preview in not time!,"I developed a prototype of a game that uses a LLAMA locally or Gemini 1.5Flah API, in Unity. It’s essentially a ChatBot that impersonates certain characters. The player has to convince them to do something, which varies depending on the chosen chapter. For example, the player has to manage to steal the password from a bank employee, convincing a powerful AI not to destroy humanity, or talking to a spy and managing to unmask them.  
The prototype is in an early stage. I'm looking for feedback on whether the game is enjoyable or not. Let me know!

I created most of the code using ChatGPT. Using Unity, there’s the interaction between C# and the editor where ChatGPT is less useful. But for certain things, it allowed me to greatly reduce development time.

Beyond the future developments of the game, it was a fun project to create and a great exercise.

The use of an LLM allows for handling any input given by the player. The situations that can arise are the most varied and interesting. If you manage to get the password from Christopher Lowes, let me know how you did it!  
I'm still working on the System Prompt. It works fairly well, but I'm not fully satisfied.

On Itch you can download a version with local LLAMA:

[https://fantasticostudio.itch.io/mind-bender-simulator](https://fantasticostudio.itch.io/mind-bender-simulator)

I also added support for Gemini 1.5Flash via API. It is much smarter and faster. But there's the issue of API costs. I found it rather complicated to calculate the actual cost of a gaming session, especially considering caching.

Unfortunately, OpenAI’s APIs are even more expensive.

Are there accurate methods for calculating the costs of a ChatBot considering tokens per message, number of messages, memory length, system prompt length, caching, etc.?

LLAMA 3.2 3B works quite well in English, but in other languages the results are terrible. Whereas Gemini 1.5Flash has provided excellent responses even in Italian. For now, I tried to convince LLAMA 3.2 3B to respond only in English, but when writing in other languages, it sometimes messes things up a bit!

Ever since I can remember I have always had what I described as “drops in sugar” after breakfast, but this only happened if I had  cereals (usually Kellogg’s special k)  with caffellatte (coffee (espresso) and milk), which I have mostly everyday. If I don’t eat breakfast I am fine, I can go for hours without eating anything and nothing happens. If I have caffellatte with cereals then after one hour(ish) I start shaking, sweating, my heartbeat spikes and I feel like fainting. 
 
If I don’t eat much for breakfast, for example  caffellate with two plain biscuits or rusks(which is what I do to avoid the sugar drops) I am completely fine. If I eat more than just a caffellatte with bread derived products (let’s say I eat pancakes or waffles or whatever) I am also fine. But when I have a “medium” breakfast like that, the sugar drop always happens. 

I have had this my whole life, so I thought I was just very sensitive to coffee and that the cereals just weren’t enough for breakfast. I never fainted, but I did feel the incredible urgency to eat something every time and I always did. Should I look into it? I feel like my case is very specific and I am wondering if it’s just sensitiveness to cereals + caffellatte. But this thing always happened and I always wondered why.

This design style eliminates unnecessary walls and barriers, allowing natural light to flow freely throughout the space. By combining the living room, kitchen, and dining area, you create a warm and inviting atmosphere that is perfect for gathering with family and friends.

### Multi-functional Furniture

In a small mountain house, furniture that serves more than one purpose can save tons of space. Here are some options to consider:

- **Foldable tables:** A table that can be extended or collapsed will maximize dining space without taking over the room.

### Smart Storage Solutions

Another crucial aspect of small mountain house designs is smart storage. With limited square footage, it’s essential to think creatively about where you keep your belongings. Here are some ideas:

- **Built-in shelves:** Install shelves in nooks and crannies to maximize vertical space.
- **Under-bed storage:** Use storage bins or drawers under the bed for items you don’t need every day.
- **Wall-mounted cabinets:** Utilize wall space for cabinets that keep essentials easily accessible but out of sight.

### Utilizing Vertical Space

When designing a small mountain house, going vertical is a game-changer. For example:

- **Hanging plants:** Add greenery without taking up surface space by hanging plants from the ceiling.
- **Tall bookcases:** Reach for the ceiling with bookcases that draw the eye upward, creating an illusion of height.

### Natural Elements

Small mountain houses often benefit from designs that harmonize with their surroundings. natural materials like wood and stone can enhance the aesthetics while making the house feel more connected to nature. Large windows can also be included to frame breathtaking mountain views, inviting the beauty of the outdoors into your living space.

You can create a cozy spot for morning coffee or evening relaxation. Additionally, well-placed seating or fire pits can encourage outdoor gatherings, making the most of your natural surroundings.

Best tips combined from various posts from this subreddit and life, this is long, have a seat 🤣:

If a man doesn’t ask you out in advance with a day, time, and place - that’s not a date, that’s a summons. Even a jury summons comes with a day, time, and place.
You have a life and plans of your own, he needs to ask in advance so he knows you will be free if he actually wants to see you. 

A coffee or drink date isn’t a date. There is no excuse of “I like that I can walk out easy”, you can walk out of any date. 
The point is, he can come up with a plan beyond coffee and drinks, nobody is forcing him to default to dinner date. Even a museum is a great date. 

The apps exist to make money off of you as the dangled carrot to men. They want to keep you as a product, not get you a boyfriend. Similar to ladies drink free night. You’re the product. At least drink free night you get free drinks, if drinking is your thing. Apps don’t give you anything free; except often they give you a free headache. 

He is capable of planning; he can manage at work just fine. He can manage plans to watch his NFL team with friends. He can manage to make plans to play golf. Trust me, he can plan a date. 

A vagina doesn’t have dick memory. If a man thinks a vagina is loose if she slept with 100 different men, but tight if she fucked one man 100 times - The math doesn’t math, that’s still fucking 100 times. That’s still a dick in vagina 100 times. They just want to sex shame women. Don’t tolerate their sex shaming of ANY woman. 

They want to sex shame women and yet want sex with us. So they want sex with a person that doesn’t like sex? Weird. 

You need life goals in common with the man so if you want kids and he doesn’t, that should come out extremely early on because that is a huge deal to agree on. 
It does not matter if you hit it off great, it can’t go anywhere as you want vastly different things. 
Do not go into it thinking you want him to change his mind on wanting kids, you do not want a man who isn’t 100000 in on kids. 
If he is a maybe on kids, he needs to grow some on his own. He should know for sure and date women who want the same things. 

Don’t be a man’s tour guide from an app. You do not work for free. He can hire a tour guide. 

A man is not your boyfriend until he is **consistently** nice to you and makes it clear that he is your boyfriend and monogamous, don’t let them omit this. You should not even want him as a boyfriend until you see him be **consistently** nice to you. 

A man isn’t a project, accept him how he is. Or move on. You also would not want a man dating you to change you eventually. He doesn’t give you enough time? Assess this over a month or two then walk away. It’s the free market and you are free to find a man who wants to spend time with you. 

No dating app is better than any other dating app (hinge vs tinder etc) in my experience and most women that I know or read about experience, too. 
Could the apps have been a great way to meet another person you know is single? 
Yes. 
Are they? Your mileage may vary, but doesn’t seem to be the case for many. 
Fwiw Match group has a chokehold on some of them (tinder, match, hinge, that I know of) and caters exponentially to their shareholders for profit. 

Wanting a man who is nice to you, consistent with you, you have connection, and good conversation
 with is absolutely not unreasonable. Do not let *anyone* tell you these basic standards are too high. 
Nobody expects a perfect person, vet men accordingly with your peace of utmost importance in mind. 

Men should be competing with your peace and quality of life. If they compromise your peace or subtract from your quality of life, what is the point? Walk away. 

For any men lurkers to this, most women do not hate men, stop regurgitating that nonsense. Wanting a man who is nice to us and having standards doesn’t mean we hate men…

Women not finding men’s dating app profiles of up the nose shots or mirror selfies with an extremely dirty mirror attractive doesn’t mean we hate men. 
Wanting a man who makes plans with us in advance, as we have a life of our own, doesn’t mean we hate men. This isn’t complex stuff here. 

Tldr: your standards are good, a man isn’t your boyfriend until he makes plans with you in advance **consistently** and is nice to you. Protect your peace. ",6,1729263414.0,WomenDatingOverForty,2,1.0,False
1g6k15c,https://www.reddit.com/r/SchoolBusDrivers/comments/1g6k15c/tips_for_fatigue/,Tips for fatigue,"What is one to do?  

Up at 445AM, on the road by 600AM, done at 9AM.  Whatever until 230PM, done at 530PM.  No problem on daily’s 
EXCEPT: Not enough hours to earn a solid living so gotta have another job which can keep me up til 10PM at times.  Always need but can’t always get nap between day shift.

Then there are trips.  Wheels up at 6AM to drive maybe until 10 or 11AM.  Then stuck at some event with concession stand food and weak coffee sometimes 10-11 at night, then 2-3 hours back.

No way to get restorative sleep on bus in between runs, esp if kids using as locker room.  Schools might offer some chairs in a library specifically designed to prevent people from getting comfortable.  

And even if I can catch an hour or two of sleep, my body is so trained to sleep from 9/10PM-430AM that no amount of caffeine keeps me feeling super alert on the late night runs back.

I really don’t know how to combat the fatigue from just being up and about for so long, even if I’m just waiting around, and the feeling I get driving home late with a busload of kids while pounding caffeine drinks is unsettling at absolute best.

I want to feel alert and steady and rested all the time driving, but I don’t even know if that’s biologically possible without seeking out a real place to sleep, and I am really concerned about the amount of caffeine I’m consuming every day; I know that it is making my sleep less restorative and contributing to fatigue….

Every book and rule and document says don’t drive when fatigued, but I don’t think that there is a driver in my company that isn’t forced to by the schedules and lack of accommodations — I can’t really tell though, because everyone sort of avoids the topic and just talks about how little sleep they get and how tired they are.

What are your strategies?  Pack lunches, bring lots of caffeine.  Learn to sleep in backbreaking positions?  And advice is appreciated.",1,1729263414.0,SchoolBusDrivers,4,1.0,False

u/iambaby1989 Thanks again for the cute card and the letter inside!  I'm so curious about your card stash because you always send some cuties.

u/draftyelectrolyte that colon is crazy!! I can't even begin to imagine what carrying that around in your body would feel like, geez!!

u/lacroixqat art and cards do help us travel!! France is one of my travel dreams so the postcard you sent is perfect!

u/colorfulpeanutpatrol thank you for the Montana postcard (never been there but I want to see the mountains there in the winter, the photos I've seen are stunning).  I'm not sure where you are but were you affected by Helene?  I hope you have power by now; I'll be thinking of you!

u/pinkjiggle53 thank you for the postcard!!! I've never heard of Fernbank in Atlanta and will have to add it to my list of travels! Your glass fish drawing is precious.

u/nyancatNOVA thank you for the Alabama postcard!  One summer my partner and I were kinda like live-in nannies in a little town just outside of Cullman, Alabama.  It was gorgeous! Never did I see a covered bridge though. I don't have any Lou Paper postcards, besides the Halloween one so I will always accept a Virginia one!!  Thank you for offering.

u/melhen16 once again, your stamp game is awesome!!!!! thank you for the postcard, I'm a big fan of cherry blossoms.  The Memphis Botanical Garden hosts a cherry blossom festival each spring and it is so beautiful to walk through the gardens and see all the blooms.  If you catch it near the end, it looks like snow falling.  My alma mater, Western Kentucky University, has a ""mini-mall"" of cherry trees and walking through that area of campus in the spring was always a highlight.

u/_grotesque_ thank you for the lovely mushroom postcard, I'm going to use it as fun art! When it finally got to me though, the wax embellishments were missing :(   Black tea with lemon and mint is a low-key drink that I don't think a lot of people drink but I love it!  Your apple pie sounds amazing and like a perfect slice of autumn. I think my perfect autumn day would be freshly baked bread or rolls in the morning with hot coffee, some sort of mid-day outing like apple picking or a trip to the pumpkin patch, a quick look around a vintage shop, and then ending the day with a good, warm soup/stew and an autumn puzzle with soft music in the background.

u/CosmicallyConstant thank you so much for the Halloween card!! I've happily displayed it in my card collection. I also love the stamp you used! Have I sent you a Halloween card?  If not, I would be glad to.

u/orangewolpertinger I love the little witchy card!!  The hand with the leaves/vine wrapped around it drew me in when I saw it. The little inky cap mushroom sticker inside is also precious.

u/orangewolpertinger ALSO, thank you for the Halloween card!!!  That little ghost kitty is the darn cutest and your envelope decor was amazing not to mention the infamous Red Dragon D&D stamp (iconic) and that glittery wax seal!

u/thecaledonianrose thank you for the Halloween card!! I'm a huge fan of the stamp you used as well as the little mummy guy with the ice cream cart on the back. So cute!

u/littlepurples626 thank you for the Halloween card!!!  It was use cute and colorful and your little ghostie stickers are adorable.

u/happyjoy23 thank you for the Halloween card!!  I always love a ghost kitty.  I wish I could get my cat to keep a little ghost costume on for a photo but atlas, she is evil and will not.

u/spaaaaaacey thank you for the Halloween card!!!  I love the vintage vibes and yeah....you gotta at least attempt to watch the Disney Sleepy Hollow. It's just a classic. I like your choice in stamps as well; at a glance it looks like the Headless Horseman! Also, the stickers you used are AMAZING!  Do you know where you got them?

u/epatterson831 maybe you aren't a weirdo and don't know this, OR maybe you do but when I saw your username (Patterson) I thought it was so neat that you chose a pretty awesome bigfoot wax seal, considering the iconic Patterson-Gimlin bigfood film. This post may give away a lot of my fringe interests.  Anyways, thank you for the Halloween card and I 100% saved that little wax seal.

u/ka-venc thank you for the card, I loved it so much and added it to my growing collection!!  I love the little 1-cent bobcat stamp you used as well.

u/lordofzesloths thank you so much for the Halloween card and the cutest stickers!!!  Your little address label is probably the cutest Halloween one I've seen yet.

u/RitaAlbertson Thank you for the card!!  I loved the pumpkin candle sticker/paper on the front and the Día de los Muertos stamp you used!!! I lived in Mexico for a couple years and the holiday there is INCREDIBLE. There was a huge public ofrenda set up in the plaza and it was breathtaking seeing the decor and all the time and care given to placing each specific thing. Seeing the families come together and honor their loved ones and ancestors was so touching.  I learned how to make my own ofrenda and also had a beautiful one set up for the holiday, so even though it's not my heritage it still means a lot to me.

u/OMGIzzysHere thank you for the Halloween postcard!!! I put it on my doorway as soon as I got it!

u/Aviana9 I have never received mail from Bulgaria so when I saw the stamp I was so EXCITED!! And its a Halloween card so I can't wait for people to ask where it came from.  Thank you so much!!

u/booty200 thank you for the Halloween postcard!! It was the perfect addition to my decorations!  I think my fun plans also involve candy that may or may not make it into children's buckets and bags this year, along with this year's viewing of ""Over the Garden Wall,"" and one of my favorite activities: carving pumpkins!  I always carve a face and I like to leave a candle lit in it all night long on Halloween.

I guess that I'll start with I kind of messed up and this will be a longer post so tl;Dr at the end 

I didn't know screenshotting someone's Snapchat profile thing sends them a notification about it and I don't even know what to say about that which is what brought me here. 

My gf of about 6 months has been 110% all in and she has been the absolute most perfect girl for me I've ever met. 

All was great until mid August. She spent maybe 2-3k for my birthday. a romantic weekend getaway, gifts, a massive photo collage of pictures of us for my wall etc. 

The getaway went great even though I told her I really couldn't afford the time to leave at this point. 

I was basically at the tail end of a multi year project that was finally culminating in about 30 days from then and I needed to be available and present just in case. 

The getaway she got was an off the grid kind of deal. I made plans on how to deal with things if anything came up and we had a blast. 

I told her I'm going to be extremely stressed and preoccupied for those next 30 days because if the project didn't go through I would be in a rough situation. 

I finally got an exact date for the projects end which was ~30 days away. 

She ended up getting a date a week later for a medical procedure which she was supposed to get done on the exact same day. 

I asked her to reschedule etc because there was no way I could make it and to be rather honest, the thing I was working on was going to be a huge deal. 

I don't mean huge deal like a 20k bonus or whatever. If ended up going through and if I don't ever want to work again I don't need to.  

Life changing situation that would allow me to be there to watch future children grow, always be present for my partner, pursue any hobby we want, vacation when and where we want, paid off house, good reoccurring monthly income and a nice big chunk for investment accounts etc. 

She understood and it was a 4 hour procedure that she didn't need to be put under for (not that lack of anesthesia makes it any less scary for her. Not trying to minimize at all but less risky than riding sport bikes which we both do) 

I did my thing while she was having her stuff done. 

I messaged her throughout with pep talks, I love you's, things to get her mind off the surgery and so on. 

For months I told her if this deal went through I would celebrate with a big mac and a strawberry milkshake. 

When it went through I messaged her a picture of the big mac and strawberry milkshake. 

After that she had to stay in the hospital in the U.S while I was in Canada for a few days. 

I had multiple lawyer meetings over the next few days to finish everything up and was only able to come to the hospital the last night she was there. 

After that everything seemed fine. She came back, all was good for a week or so and then she started acting different. 

I talked to her and she said she was fine and we continued on. 

A week later she was acting more distant. I talked to her again and she said it's because she stopped her depression medication a few weeks before. 

I told her I'm here for her, what can I do etc. 

Now she works in the u.s as an ER nurse and leaves for 4 days of the week and stays at her uncle's house about 2 hours away.

Normally we message and stuff the entire time. This time I barely hear from her and she's even more distant. 

Any reply is 8+ hours later, very ""low effort"" 1 sentence type of things, no ""love"" or sense that she misses me etc. 

I talk to her again when she comes back and basically say there are a lot of red flags that make it seem like here attention is being drawn elsewhere. 

She tells me it's due to depression and I tell her not to worry, i'm here for her, she's got this and I got her if she needs help. 

Immediately after that conversation she told me she is going to meet up with her ex boyfriend from about 7 years ago who she talks to on text and stuff quite often.  They remained friends after a 6 months relationship years ago and I never really cared. 

This is the first time they were going to meet up since we met but whatever, it's uncomfortable but if that's what she needs to help her through a hard time alright. I get that there are somethings she can't talk to me about or something so go for it.

She told me she would message me regularly during the time they were hanging out and I said don't worry, I trust you. 

They met up, went out for coffee, she messaged me a handful of times. I just gave basic replies like ""have fun & drive safe"". Then they went to his place for like 2 hours and then she was supposed to come home at 9-10.

Didn't get a message for some time then around 11 I get a message saying ""coming back now"" which I didn't say anything back to.

After that I replied to her saying coming back from where. . . . Since it's been an hour.

Her phone was off. 

She called me about 15 minutes after midnight from her house. 

She told me her phone died and she had to go home because she peed her pants . . . 

Sounded sketchy AF and I was like what! You are hours late, phone was off while you were at your ex's house and you didn't come to my place and are now at home because you peed your pants !?!

Again, she's 26 and she hasn't peed her pants since I've known her. 

I then told her I'm not comfortable with her hanging out with her ex to which I got a response of ""what, I can't have friends?"" And I was like ""whaaatttttt!?!"" lol. I'm not a controlling guy and normally girls get mad because I don't care enough about other guys. 

I told her this doesn't make me feel secure at all, makes me feel bad and if she cared she wouldn't want to hurt me. 

I don't know but she didn't want to stop talking to him and we ended up talking the next morning. 

She explained her side and how he supports her or whatever and I said that's what I'm supposed to be here for and I feel like she should want to support me if some ex is making me feel bad. 

I just said whatever I apologize for getting mad and we didn't really solve that whole thing. 

Then she left for work again, barely talking to me again. 

The weird part is that it seems to me that someone is drawing her attention but I don't think it's her ex which sounds a bit crazy given the situation. 

Her ex lives in the city I'm in and her work is like 2 hours away. 

When she comes back, she's 100% again but when she's gone I'm barely getting the time of day. The past 4 days I got 1 phone call and maybe 7 or 8 messages compared to a call a day and probably the equivalent to the dead sea scrolls of texts normally😅

My messages have been like ""I'm proud of you for going to work when I know you're feeling so bad. Your doing great, the storm will pass"" and that kind of stuff. When she was back I gave her some cool framed photo I took on a DSLR camera of a city skyline over water with multiple lightning strikes coming down striking some buildings with some motivational poem/message I wrote her in the back. Many hours later I would get an ""aw thanks"" message.

None of the usual sexiness, no loviness, no punctuality and just all around drastically different from normal. 

She has a phone, she has a smart watch that tells her when she gets a message, she has been on tiktok reposting stuff and still not messaged me back for hours after that. 

At this point even though I really like her I'm prepared to end things but am just waiting until after this non refundable vacation is over with in like 10 days. 

In my head I'm just transitioned her over to a random girl basically. 

The situation sucks and to me it seems like she may not be cheating but she's definitely preoccupied with a coworker or someone in the city she works in which will eventually go down that path.

At the same time, I don't understand depression  as well as I would like to and she has made an attempt on her life years ago so I'm trying to be supportive, there for her and not add to her stress. 

Buttttt, I also am super suspicious because there are dozens of red flags so I decided to go on Snapchat which I haven't really done since being with her since it's mostly just girls on mine and I only go on if she's sending me a sexy pic or something which hasn't happened in 6 weeks or whatever. 

I went to her profile, looked at her snap score thing to see where that's at and screenshotted it to see if she's messaging people on there while ignoring me. 

And the screenshot of her profile apparently sends her a notification. 🤦🏻‍♂️

She's coming home for the next 3 days right now and I'm going to see her in the evening and I don't know what to say about the screenshot asides from bringing all this up so yeah, what do you guys think? 

The story has a bit more to it but it's already so long so feel free to ask any questions

1g6jyzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1g6jyzp/boomer_sucks_at_walking_and_makes_it_everyone/,Boomer sucks at walking and makes it everyone else's problem,"I see this sub a lot and just remembered that I have a pretty funny boomer story that happened roughly six years ago.  Unfortunately, I didn't have a brilliant one-liner, no one shamed the guy, and the dude didn't have any sobering moments of realization - so perhaps I'm in the minority on this sub.

Anywho - I was at a Starbucks in an expensive part of San Diego with a friend just killing time.  We were waiting for his dad/boss to finish a meeting, so we each got something and just hung around while the meeting was going on, and without warning, this angry grandpa storms in, dog in tow.  He skips the line and addresses the first barista he sees.

""Where the fuck is your manager?!"" He shouted.

The poor girl up front had that deer in the headlights look, and stammers the beginnings of a response that I don't remember, and then the old guy cuts in, ""I cut my cornea on that sign three times already and I just did again!  Your sign isn't up to code!  I walk by this spot all the time and you're looking for a lawsuit!""

(Note: This dialog is a vague recollection.  He definitely mentioned his cornea and a lawsuit, though.)

He goes off on the barista for a minute, and then the manager comes out and tries to apply logic to the lead poisoning.  It's ineffective.  The boomer pulls the manager to the door and starts pointing at a vinyl sign that's hanging from the awning of the store.  And honestly, who knows; maybe it wasn't up to code - but I personally feel like if something is at eye level and you're walking at it and refuse to move, that's kinda on you.  It's definitely on you if you're so dogshit at walking that you've done it four times.  Is loss of object permanence a side-effect of lead poisoning?

I'm getting off track.  They're standing in the threshold of the Starbucks with the fat old guy doing his best impression of Vernon Dursley with his remarkably chill dog just vibing, and in the middle of this, some well-to-do guy on his phone tries to walk between them.  The boomer took exception to this and yelled at the customer, ""What do you think you're doing motherfucker?!"" into his confused face.

Cognitive dissonance is an artform for the average boomer, though, and the guy eventually power-walked away claiming that he was definitely going to sue.  The barista was crying it off in the back, I think, and the manager apologized to those of us in the store for the interruption.  Nothing else really happened.  There were pockets of conversation of people relentlessly shitting on the boomer - me and my buddy included - but there was no clapping, no cool guy action hero line, and no catharsis.  As all boomers will eventually do, the angry old man left our lives and we mostly forgot about him.

I only remembered this because of a google review that I left after the incident all those years ago.  Apparently I was eating a brownie.  Here's a screenshot from the review - I'd link it but idk if that breaks the rules, so I'll avoid it out of caution.

I hear borderline sob stories at recruiting events from people who were “born in Ghana”, but when you actually dig in it turns out they moved to Boston as an infant and their parents are successful lawyers. One girl whines all the time and literally pulls aside recruiters and talks about how hard her upbringing in Nigeria was, when her dad is literally the head of a major accounting firm there lmao. 

All of the racial minorities at my school grew up incredibly privileged. The women at my school all whine about how hard they have it despite wearing Gucci everyday, growing up in Manhattan, driving Mercedes around, and getting loads of priority access to every firm. 

The LGBTQ+ folks are the exact same way. I quite like my classmates. I think they’re intelligent, accomplished, and fun to be around. This isn’t a diss on them at all - it’s a diss on how backward the diversity bullshit is. 

I come from a legitimate poor family in the American South. My grandparents emigrated from rural Denmark with literally nothing. My grandpa died a mine worker in West Virginia before my family moved to Alabama. My parents are small dairy farmers. My dad got an Associate’s degree in agriculture at a community college in Alabama lol. I literally picked cotton and milked cows growing up. Studied and worked my ass off to go to school and get a job that wasn’t backbreaking labor. And yet I am excluded from events and opportunities everyday because I am a straight, white male. Whether it be in recruiting, in class, or in casual conversation, there is always a light feeling of slight aggression toward me as someone who is typically seen as privileged, when reality could not be farther from the truth. 

Just yesterday I found that in my very, very niche desired vertical at a boutique bank I am the only one not to receive a coffee chat from my tiny group here at school. Literally the only one. Despite having much more relevant and technical work experience than my classmates in this area, and following all the rules and guidelines exactly. Every other student who got it is a woman or minority. I decided to go to the associate’s LinkedIn and she has all sorts of “defeat the patriarchy” nonsense on there.

Anyway, if you go to a top school prepare to be bombarded with diversity slop while the so-called victims are actually wealthy elites who receive special treatment. ",198,1729263197.0,MBA,84,0.88,False

She musst have seen I was confused so she pointed of her clothes then me and again made thumbs up. 
I smiled at her, made the gesture of thank you, walked in and got some coffee.

**Context:**

Alright, degenerates, we’ve got a prime setup here on COFROB (Robusta Coffee). Take a look at this channel we’ve been riding. We had a pullback, but check this out: we’re still within the upward channel that has held since early 2023. This dip below support is nothing but a healthy correction before the next leg up.

With Vietnam’s supply dwindling due to severe drought, the **supply shortage** is real. Brazil’s crop might've softened the blow but it was still also lower than expected, all in all the market is short 9 million bags of coffee it was expecting this year according to comunicaffe international. **Demand is gonna kick hard**, and you know what happens when the market wakes up to a looming shortage.

Technical traders love channels, and this one looks juicy for a bounce. We’ve kissed the lower trend line, and the last time this happened, we saw a **20% spike**. Pair that with an upcoming global shortage, and we could easily rip past $5,000 in no time.

**My Call**:  
I’m loading up here at $4,862 and betting on a move back to the upper end of the channel. This could push $5,800+ if the supply crisis gets worse. **Over 1 billion people**

**Edit:**

Coffee prices dipping below the lower channel support right when we’ve got Vietnam drying out like a raisin and Brazil barely holding things together. This is like catching BTC below $10k before the rip, except we’re talking about your morning cup of coffee going premium AF. ☕📈

Original author Ventero.

It's a shame that such a tool doesn't have a port for Linux. The code is open, and **Pete Batard** said in our correspondence when I asked him to do so that he didn't have the time to do so, but that he would welcome it if someone would take it.

So I want to get people to participate in the creation of Rufus for Linux. Personally, I'm not a programmer and I'm not able to compile code, but I offer my financial support. Or another manageable one for me - I can go to developers for coffee, beer and pizza, for example. :D

If there is no one here who would take up the compilation voluntarily and in a community way, my idea is that more people would get together and pay someone. Or maybe together with a financial contribution they convinced developers of e.g. linux distributions that they would take it up and make an official package.

Maybe I imagine it as \*, but I think that a lot of SW was created in this way, not only for Linux.

Can I find support or at least a statement from someone experienced on how to proceed with my initiative?

1g6jtyb,https://www.reddit.com/r/hfs/comments/1g6jtyb/aliens_anonymous_just_when_you_thought_it_couldnt/,Aliens Anonymous: “Just When You Thought It Couldn’t Get Worse”,"The basement of the Galactic Rehab Center was damp, dark, and full of aliens who had experienced the same unifying trauma: humans. They sat in a circle, perched on cheap, creaking chairs that barely supported the variety of limbs, tails, and appendages.

Grulth, a slimy, many-eyed creature, squelched into the center of the group. “Alright, everyone, let’s try to keep this session focused. Remember, we’re here to share and heal. Tonight, we have a special guest speaker—a Grey—but until they arrive, let's begin with our usual check-ins. Who’d like to start?”

Zor’Nek, a tall, blue-scaled Sarthrexian, flicked his gills in irritation. “I’ll go first,” he hissed. “I had the worst encounter with humans this past cycle. I was studying their ‘airports.’ Absolute chaos. No one knew where to go. They cram themselves into long lines, yell at each other, and all for what? To get on a tiny, metal tube that barely functions. They call it *flying*.”

The aliens around him grumbled sympathetically. Grulth nodded solemnly. “Humans are... inefficient.”

The door to the basement creaked open, and a human stumbled in. He was tall and scruffy, wearing a hoodie and jeans. His name tag, which looked hastily slapped on, read *Mark.* He glanced around, his eyes widening when he saw the assortment of alien lifeforms staring back at him.

“Uh... is this AA?” Mark asked, clearly confused.

Zor’Nek glared. “Yes. Aliens Anonymous. You’re not supposed to be here.”

Mark blinked, looking around again, and then his face lit up with sudden understanding. “Oh, crap, this is *Aliens* Anonymous, not Alcoholics Anonymous. That explains the... uh... tentacles.”

Grulth sighed, his tentacles drooping. “Yes, human. You’ve made a mistake. Perhaps you should leave.”

Mark scratched his head but didn’t move. “Actually, you know what? Since I’m already here… I feel like I can contribute. I mean, I’m human. I *know* how much humans suck.”

Zor’Nek hissed. “You think you can out-complain us? *You’re* one of them.”

Mark took a deep breath. “Try me.”

There was a pause. Grulth, against his better judgment, waved one tentacle. “Fine. Let’s see what you’ve got.”

Zor’Nek, still glaring at Mark, started. “As I was saying, these airports—humans have no concept of order. They lose their minds at the slightest delay. I saw one nearly rip out his hair because he had to wait an extra hour to board their primitive craft.”

Mark chuckled darkly. “Yeah, airports suck. But have you ever been on a flight where you sit next to a baby that screams for eight hours straight while the person behind you kicks your seat? I once flew across the Atlantic with a screaming baby on my left, a guy snoring so loudly on my right, and the smell of microwaved fish wafting through the cabin. It was like being trapped in hell at 30,000 feet.”

The room fell silent for a moment.

Kroxx, the scaly, fork-tongued Torvian, spoke up next. “I visited a human city last year. It was... filth. Trash everywhere. They build these huge ‘landfills’ where they just dump their waste. They pollute their own planet like they want to drown in their own garbage.”

Mark nodded. “Oh, the trash situation is awful. But here’s a fun fact: humans will throw perfectly good food in the trash because the expiration date says it’s no good—even if it’s fine. My roommate once threw out an entire pizza because it was ‘two days past the date.’ Meanwhile, I’m eating canned beans for dinner because my landlord raised the rent *again.*”

Kroxx blinked. “They... *throw away food*?”

Mark took a sip of his coffee, clearly warming up to this. “All the time, buddy.”

Zor’Nek grumbled, clearly unhappy that the human was somehow matching his misery. “Well, last cycle, I was nearly run over by a human vehicle. I was cloaked, invisible to their technology, but still! They just swerve around each other with no care for anything outside their little world.”

Mark scoffed. “Oh, I’ve been hit by a car. Twice. Once by a guy who was texting while driving. Didn’t even stop. I rolled onto the sidewalk like a ragdoll and he just kept going. People *walk* like that too. Head down, staring at their phone, walking straight into you like you don’t exist.”

Zor’Nek blinked. “You’ve been *hit* by your own vehicles?”

Mark shrugged. “It’s pretty common. Also, don’t get me started on *parking tickets.*”

Grulth, watching this unfold, rubbed his many eyes with his tentacles. “I... I’m not sure where this is going anymore.”

Thraxor, the hulking Zolthrian with three heads, chimed in, his deep voice rumbling through the room. “My people once tried to conquer Earth, and we were repelled by these... ‘tanks.’ Huge machines with guns. One of my warriors was crushed beneath one. The humans called it a ‘victory.’”

Mark smirked. “Tanks? You’re lucky. We’ve got people with military-grade weapons *just because they can.* I had a neighbor once who owned three assault rifles, and his hobby was blowing up old cars in his backyard. He’s got a gun collection bigger than my kitchen.”

Thraxor’s three heads turned to look at each other in disbelief. “You let civilians own weapons of war?”

Mark laughed bitterly. “Let them? We encourage it.”

The room was silent, the aliens growing more and more baffled by each of Mark’s revelations. This was supposed to be their time to vent about the horrors of human interaction, but somehow, this human was... outdoing them.

Kroxx tried again, desperate to reclaim the tone of the meeting. “I... was abducted by your government. They probed me. Experimented on me.”

Mark let out a hollow chuckle. “Buddy, welcome to the club. You think they treat aliens bad? Try going to a hospital in the U.S. with no health insurance. I once had to choose between paying rent and getting an antibiotic for a sinus infection. Cost me $500 just to see a doctor for five minutes.”

Grulth blinked, his tentacles twitching in stunned confusion. “They charge you to... *heal*?”

Mark nodded, leaning back in his chair. “Oh yeah. Health is a privilege in my world.”

Kroxx’s tail flicked nervously. “I... I don’t understand. Humans... humans do this to *themselves*?”

Mark sighed. “Oh, trust me, we don’t need to screw up other planets. We’re too busy screwing up our own lives. I once worked 60 hours a week and still couldn’t afford a vacation. Meanwhile, my boss takes three trips to Hawaii every year and complains about jet lag. Life’s a nightmare, guys.”

Zor’Nek slumped in his chair, utterly defeated. “I thought... I thought we had it bad. But this...”

Mark shrugged. “Welcome to the human experience. We hate each other just as much as you hate us, maybe even more.”

Grulth rubbed his many eyes again, utterly deflated. “I think... I think we need to end this session early.”

Mark stood up, stretching his arms. “Yeah, probably a good idea. I’ve gotta go find the actual AA meeting anyway. Thanks for letting me crash, though. It’s been therapeutic.”

The aliens stared at him as he shuffled toward the door. Just before leaving, Mark turned back with a wave. “Good luck with the human thing, guys. Trust me, you’ll need it.”

The door closed behind him, leaving the aliens in stunned silence.

Finally, Zor’Nek muttered, “I... feel worse.”

Kroxx hissed in agreement. “The human just... out-humanned us.”

Grulth sighed deeply. “Next week, no humans. Ever.”

The group murmured in agreement, thoroughly defeated by the very creature they had come here to escape. Somehow, the human had managed to ruin even their support group, simply by existing.

And out in the hallway, Mark was probably complaining about it to someone else, completely unaware of the havoc he had just wrought.

First off, this thing looks good—stainless steel, compact, fits even the most cluttered kitchen. But it’s not all looks; it’s packing some serious features. You got a **programmable timer**, so set it up the night before and wake up to that fresh coffee smell. It’s like a mini miracle, honestly. The **built-in water filter**? Removes impurities from tap water, making sure your brew isn’t ruined by funky water.

It brews up to 12 cups, or just a few if you’re flying solo. I like that kind of flexibility—no wasted coffee, no brewing more than I need. The **anti-drip** feature is also great: grab your cup mid-brew, no spills. Real lifesaver if you can’t wait.

Now, for the cons: the **glass carafe** sits on a hot plate, so your coffee can get a little stale if left too long. And filling up the water tank? Bit awkward since it isn’t removable, and the opening is kinda small. Oh, and it makes a bit of noise when it’s done brewing—not deal-breaking, but it’s worth knowing.

Let's break down some key insights that can guide your decision:

Burr vs Blade: The consensus among coffee aficionados is that burr grinders are superior to blade grinders. Burr grinders provide a consistent grind size, which is crucial for a great cup of coffee.

Grind Settings: Look for a grinder with multiple grind settings. This versatility allows you to experiment with different brewing methods, from espresso to French press.

Durability and Build Quality: Stainless steel or ceramic burrs are preferred for their longevity and ability to maintain a consistent grind over time.

Brand Reliability: Brands like Baratza, Breville, and Capresso often receive high marks for their performance and customer satisfaction.

Budget Considerations: While it’s tempting to go for the cheapest option, remember that investing in a quality grinder can enhance your coffee experience significantly.

User Reviews and Feedback: Diving into user reviews can offer real-world insights into the grinder's performance over time.

Now, about the water reservoir—it’s removable. That might sound like a tiny thing, but if you’ve ever tried awkwardly filling a machine without spilling everywhere, you’ll appreciate this. Plus, it brews 12 cups, so you’re covered whether it’s just you or you’ve got a crowd.

The only bummer? It’s kinda noisy. Not ""wake-the-neighbors"" loud, but you’ll definitely hear it gurgling away. And, while it does brew hot coffee, it’s almost *too* hot right out of the gate. I found myself waiting for it to cool down so I didn’t scorch my taste buds.

Overall, if you’re looking for a solid, programmable coffee maker that doesn’t break the bank, the Ninja CE251 is a good bet. It’s not fancy, but it gets the job done—and honestly, that’s all I need when I’m half-asleep and desperate for caffeine.",1,1729262529.0,TheCoffeeMachine,0,1.0,False

I first experimented with various clarified tiki drinks to get the hang of the process (Beachbum Berry Zombie, Three Dots and a Dash, Jungle Bird) before trying to recreate their clarified zombie (Crystal Skull).

While mine is definitely different than theirs, I'm still really happy with how this turned out.  The 5-spice syrup comes through nicely and complements the slightly cooler weather we have in Houston this week.

The first picture is my own creation and the second is the Crystal Skull from Skull and Crown.

My spec:

2 oz: Hamilton Zombie Blend Rum  
0.5 oz: Hamilton 151  
0.75 oz: lime juice  
1 oz: passions fruit, pineapple, guava syrup  
1 oz: 5-spice syrup

Pay sucks, but it's better than unemployment.

When I started out, I was in a cubicle like most places. We had one super knowledgeable engineer with a bit of a temper, one lazy bastard engineer, one who works from home, and myself. There was also a project manager but I never worked with him, and he seemed like a bit of a dick so I just avoided him. About 2.5 months in the PM becomes the manager, gets into an argument with the knowledgeable engineer about a parking dispute which he decided to escalate and fired the guy. Well that's a good start for week 1 of his job.

Guy starts making threats to write me up because I'm checking my phone which I suppose I can look less often, and just use it for music. Comes over after that while I'm still a bit peeved for getting completely told off in public and wants to troubleshoot his time tracking software that he can't get to work for the last 3 months. We get 1 thing to show up and he slaps my shoulder like we are old buddies and I'm trying not to interpret it as assault. 

Later, he starts getting on my case again, and so I need to tell him I have diagnosed ADHD and I used to work from home so I'm trying to change coping mechanisms. Since then every time we have talked he has brought up my ""condition"" and I am starting to feel like I'm being harassed.

Renovations started in the company, and now i got moved to an office with the manager and 2 other engineers temporarily. We are going to be here for the next 6 months, so it is technically temporary.

We are all facing the walls, he set his desk up to be staring at my back all day. He Sends out an email requiring all engineers to sign and date that we can have a maximum of 20 minutes of break per day with a 30 minute unpaid lunch and anything beyond that is a write up, or implementation of a punch card system. 

I then got talked to again for taking too many breaks (this is after the email) because I was spending too much time getting coffee and shitting and that needed to stop. So like idk I'm probably going to have to get diapers or something. Either way this is getting wild and I don't like it. As a person who technically has a disability (ADHD) in the least compromising work environment I have ever been in, I don't know what next steps are. Other than reaching out to recruiters because this is mad.

Got a new boss who is a twat, and he spends his days staring at my back because I dont subscribe to his charm",2,1729262257.0,hatemyjob,0,1.0,False

We met at a casual daytime coffee date, then had dinner the next day + met for drinks with his friends. I stayed that night with him and we made out/cuddled, he had tried to put a move on me but I said I’d want to wait and he agreed saying he liked me and didn’t want to hook up yet. I had a morning responsibility and he got up very early to drop me off the next day. We saw each other two days later and he came over to watch a movie because he wanted to see me before he left for a business trip. We had a good time, but we got hot and heavy with a make out, leading to him getting me off but I still said no not yet when he tried to initiate sex. It seemed to be okay afterwards but I knew he was disappointed because I didn’t do it back. We texted a bit the day after when he left for his trip but after a day he stopped responding for a few days. I knew he was going to be gone until the weekend, but he did not text me back until he got back in town. He would only interact with me by liking my stories/sending a reel. Now that he’s back in town we chatted and got together to get dinner+a movie, the theater being 35 min from my place but close to his. He asked if I was sleeping over after but I had an early meeting the next day so I said I couldn’t, and when I dropped him off he asked if I would come up. I said no I can’t I still have a long drive and I wouldn’t get home till midnight. He pecked me after I said that and then abruptly got out the car… I was a little confused. On my drive he had sent me a funny text but I didn’t see it, and fifteen minutes later asked ‘did I do something wrong?’. I didn’t see either text until I finally got home and was so confused. I thought our date had gone well and we were talking about future plans and being affectionate holding hands and such. When I responded I said I just got home and that I’m sorry I made him feel that way, I had an early meeting so I had to get back. I tried to be sweet and add that I’d promise to stay with him next time. All he said was ‘gotcha, well goodnight’. Not sure if he was actually upset. I text the next day and he took the 8 hours to respond and then he said he was getting crushed with work. I said he could call if he wanted to talk about it and he said thanks but he had to prep for work travel the next day. I told him okay let’s get together when your back, and he hearted the  message. Now it has been radio silent for three days. 

Is this a case of miscommunication, or is he slow fading me because he’s upset I wouldn’t hook up with him yet? I feel he’s breadcrumbing me as he continues to like my instagram stories but not send a text. :/ I really like him and would like to clear the air. Should I follow up or wait and see if no text shows his lack of interest.

Everyday there seems to be some fire to put out, be it the power grid going down or not enough resources for computers to make more radio control units. 

  
You may start to think ""you must like your job"", but that is not the case, it sucks.

I go to work one day a week at a job I enjoy for time out of the house while my bf stays home with the baby. My bf works hard at a sales jobs to earn our family’s money, he commutes one hour to the city two days a week and has some long days and late nights. He also is good about taking over with the baby when he gets home from work and on weekends, cooking dinners here and there (it’s hard when he sometimes doesn’t get home til 6 or 7), closing down the kitchen at night or bathing and getting the baby ready for bed. He doesn’t do much cleaning, though he does do some laundry and dishes, and I don’t ask for anything else. He really gets little to no time to himself, and neither do I. It’s just what it is having a small baby, but he’s not one of these dads going on weekend hunting trips, gaming for hours, or going out drinking with his buddies while I’m at home alone with our child. He’s typically just as dedicated to our family as I am.

However, since I EBF I do all the night wakings with the baby. Bf has been getting full nights of sleep since day 1, except when I’ve woken him up to change a diaper or put baby back to sleep on occasion. He’s never complained about that. I’ve been dealing with PP insomnia so daytime naps are not an option for me (trust me, I’ve tried). The exhaustion catches up with me periodically and I have a hard time with emotional regulation. I feel so bad when I loose my cool around our sweet, perfect baby. So on weekends or when my bf is having a slow WFH day I will ask him to take the baby and let me sleep in for a couple hrs. 

Here is what makes me upset. When I get up with the baby in the morning, I change the his clothes, feed him, unload the dishwasher and start a load of laundry, make coffee and breakfast, and entertain him. My day starts, as exhausted as I am, I just do it. When my bf takes the baby to let me sleep, as far as I can tell, he pretty much sleeps on the couch and sticks the baby in his play gym. For 2hrs. Baby usually gets so bored he goes back to sleep. One time he was crying and it woke me up from the next room. I came out and bf was just sleeping, did not hear baby crying right next to him. When I wake up, the baby is usually still in his sleep sack unless I take it off before he takes him, and one time he didn’t even change his *overnight diaper* because it was “just pee.” I had to tell him that it still needs to be changed when he wakes up in the morning… 

Am I overreacting? I understand he’s not a morning person, and he’s a very competent parent literally any other time of the day, but all I’m asking is to catch up on some rest a few days a week after 5mo of broken sleep every single night. What I don’t get is that he can wake up early and be “on” for work at the drop of a hat, so why can’t he do that for our baby? Am I asking too much for him to get up and engage with our baby for a couple hrs instead of going back to sleep? If baby is fed and dry (most of the time), is it wrong to leave him laying there with nothing to do for 2hrs? If I’m not overreacting, how to I broach this subject without accusing him of being a bad father?",1,1729262069.0,beyondthebump,0,1.0,False

That’s why I decided to try the **Express Water Ultimate Protection Whole House Water Filter System**, and here’s the deal: it’s solid, but not without some quirks.

# The Setup

First off, this thing is bigger than you might think—don’t be fooled by online pics. But bigger also means business. The system is built to handle 100,000 gallons before needing a filter change, which means less hassle and more clean water. Setup is surprisingly DIY-friendly too. I’m not exactly a pro at plumbing, but with the easy instructions, I had it up and running over a weekend.

# Water Quality? Night and Day

Here’s where the magic happens: the **3-stage filtration**. It handles everything—chlorine, lead, iron, copper, rust, even weird odors. Honestly, it felt like I swapped out my tap water for bottled water. Cooking and drinking became way more enjoyable, and the gross chlorine taste that used to ruin my coffee? Gone. It’s also NSF certified, so you know it’s legit.

# The Best Parts

1. **Tastes great** – Water went from pool party to mountain spring. Even my picky family noticed.
2. **Long filter life** – You’re looking at 6-12 months before needing to swap filters. Set it and forget it.
3. **Easy install** – Seriously, I got it hooked up in about an hour, and I’m no handyman.

# What’s Not So Great?

* **Pricey upfront** – Expect to drop $500-800, which stings a little, but long term it balances out.
* **Takes up space** – If you’re short on basement or garage real estate, finding a spot might be tricky.

# Final Verdict

If you’re tired of drinking tap water that smells like a pool, this system is a game-changer. It’s not the cheapest, but the quality and ease make it worth the investment. You’ll notice the difference immediately, and hey, fewer bottled water runs to the store is always a win.

**TL;DR:** Clean, tasty water, easy install, but it’ll take up space and cost you upfront. Worth it for anyone who wants better water at home.

I’d like to share my journey with GERD over the past few years, as well as where I’m at today.


 About two and a half years ago, I started experiencing severe issues with my esophagus, particularly with the esophageal sphincter. At first, I didn’t know what was happening, but my symptoms kept getting worse. I constantly felt a lump in my throat, like something was stuck there, and I wasn’t digesting my food properly.

For years, I dealt with this discomfort and pain in my chest. Finally, after multiple visits to the emergency room, I was able to get an endoscopy. The results showed I had uncontrolled GERD. The next few months were a struggle as I tried to figure out how to manage this condition. During this time, I lost a lot of weight, developed anxiety, and honestly, I just wasn’t myself. Every meal seemed to trigger more pain and swelling in my throat, and trips to the emergency room didn’t provide any relief because there were no visible issues at that time.

I was initially very reluctant to start medication, particularly PPIs (proton pump inhibitors), because of the negative feedback I’d heard. But after exhausting almost every other option, I decided to give PPIs a try. I also tried taking famotidine alongside the PPIs, but this combination made things worse, so I stopped the famotidine and stuck to taking the PPI once a day with breakfast.

As I kept researching ways to manage GERD, someone from my church recommended aloe vera, saying it had been very helpful for them. I decided to look into it more, and even used ChatGPT to find reliable research on the combination of PPIs and aloe vera for acid reflux. I found that there was strong evidence suggesting that this combination could be effective.

As a man of faith, my faith has also been a cornerstone of my healing process. So, the three things that have really helped me on this journey are my faith, aloe vera, and taking my PPI daily. On top of that, I started using an elevated pillow to keep my head raised while sleeping, which made a huge difference.

One aspect of my life that GERD impacted greatly was my singing. I’ve been a singer for most of my life, but GERD would cause my throat to swell up quickly whenever I sang, and I didn’t know why. Eventually, I was referred to a specialist who found a nodule on my vocal cords. Fortunately, after a year of using the combination of PPIs, aloe vera, and the elevated pillow, the nodule shrank significantly, to the point where surgery was no longer necessary.

Today, I feel much more stable. While I still have to be careful with my diet, I no longer feel that constant lump in my throat, and the pain in my chest has improved. I do still experience some dull pain on the left side of my abdomen, but this has been getting better as I’ve increased my daily protein intake to around 100 grams. I wasn’t getting enough protein before, and I believe that may have contributed to some of my issues.

I’ve learned to avoid triggers like coffee, alcohol, and eating late at night. I also focus on eating smaller meals throughout the day. For example, I’ll have breakfast in the morning, followed by a snack of pumpkin seeds, cashews, and raisins a couple of hours later.

This journey has been challenging, but I feel like I’m in a much better place now. I hope my experience can encourage others who are dealing with GERD to keep searching for solutions, because it is possible to find relief.

It’s not a bittersweet thing that they have to forget each other forever and live separate lives. It’s a bittersweet thing that they have forgotten their previous lives and how deeply they were attached to one another, but they will end up together again regardless.

In the coffee date where their tables are next to each other. Mark looks and waves at the waiter.

Cut to Nicole turning her head and looking at Mark.

Cut to Mark’s POV, the focus is on Nicole, then shifts towards the waiter. This can be interpreted, on a more surface level, as the devs fucking with us, playing with the idea that Mark recognized Nicole and vice versa and wants to say hi but it turns out they don’t. In fact, this means an even better outcome: they inadvertently made eye contact with one another, because of the focus shift. Mark waves and calls for waiter, Nicole notices someone waiving in her peripheral vision and looks at Mark. Cut to Mark’s POV, it is focused on Nicole first before shifting to the waiter. They have made eye contact, just long enough to notice one another.

They continue with their dates again.

Cut to outside window view. We see Nicole kinda blurred out, and Mark talking with his date.

The moment the butterflies arrive, the scene shifts to a different angle where both Nicole’s and Mark’s date is obscured, Mark’s date by the window thing and Nicole by Mark’s cup.

Cut to angle almost identical to original outside window view, but now both dates are obscured, and Mark and Nicole look almost as if they’re talking to each other.

Camera moves up to see the name of the coffee shop they’re in, the name can be translated as Destiny/Fate.

It’s pretty clear cut in my opinion guys.

Now, this part is reaching a little bit. But this also makes sense on a thematic level. I see a lot of people are disappointed that their planned dates aren’t with each other. To me this makes perfect sense. Although their initial encounter with one another are cosmically planned, it is incidental and accidental from their POVs.

Mark bumped at Nicole accidentally after fucking up with the assignment the first time they met. In fact they were both at the same time trying to complete their art assignments.

If they were to meet each other in the happy timeline, it’s not gonna be planned ahead either. It’s gonna be incidental. It’s gonna be when they both are on their first dates with someone else and they both struck out.",5,1729261845.0,UntilThenGame,5,0.86,False

I’m a bit of a coffee fiend, and after trying a bunch of machines, this one has me waking up a little less grumpy.

First off, it looks good—stainless steel, no cheap plastic vibes. It’s programmable too, so you can set it up the night before and wake up to fresh coffee. Honestly, it feels like having a barista on standby. Plus, the **KEYWORD** has a brew strength control, which is perfect when you need that extra kick, or if you’re in the mood for a lighter cup.

Now, one of the standout features of this KEYWORD is the adjustable temp control—finally, a coffee maker that doesn’t serve boiling or barely-warm coffee. You get to pick your perfect temp. And with the gold-tone reusable filter, no more wasting money on paper filters, plus it’s better for the planet. Win-win.

A couple of downsides, though: the glass carafe sits on a hot plate, which means it doesn’t stay hot forever. Also, I had some minor leaks once or twice—nothing crazy, but worth mentioning. Lastly, the cleaning alert can be a little too keen—sometimes it asks for cleaning a bit too early. But honestly, I’d rather that than it never reminding me at all.

# Introduction: The AI Revolution in Sales Funnel Creation

Let's face it - creating high-converting sales funnels is a pain in the neck. You spend hours designing pages, writing copy, and tweaking elements, only to end up with mediocre results. But what if I told you there's a new sheriff in town that's about to change the game?

Enter FunnelXAi, the AI-powered sales funnel creator that's turning heads and dropping jaws in the digital marketing world. This bad boy is set to launch on October 30, 2024, and it's packing more punch than a kangaroo on steroids.

I've had the privilege of taking FunnelXAi for a test drive, and let me tell you, it's like nothing I've ever seen before. It's not just another funnel builder - it's your personal AI assistant that can whip up stunning sales pages, persuasive copy, and optimized funnels faster than you can say ""take my money.""

But don't just take my word for it. Let's dive deep into what makes FunnelXAi the talk of the town and why it might just be the secret weapon you need to skyrocket your online business.

# Features: The AI-Powered Arsenal at Your Fingertips

Remember the days when you'd spend hours staring at a blank screen, trying to come up with a decent sales page design? FunnelXAi laughs in the face of designer's block. With its AI-powered sales page builder, you can create jaw-dropping pages in minutes, not hours.

The AI doesn't just slap together some random elements. It analyzes your product, target audience, and industry trends to create pages that are not just pretty, but purposeful. And the best part? You can create up to 50 sales pages with the commercial rights version. That's enough firepower to launch a small army of products!

From attention-grabbing headers to trust-building badges, these graphics are optimized for conversions. It's like having a graphic design genie at your beck and call, minus the weird blue skin and the limited wishes.

# User-Friendly Editors: Tweak to Your Heart's Content

While the AI does most of the heavy lifting, FunnelXAi knows you might want to add your personal touch. That's why it comes with user-friendly editors for sales pages, thank you pages, and even squeeze pages.

These editors are so intuitive, you'll feel like a design pro even if you can't tell Arial from Times New Roman. It's like playing with Legos, but instead of a plastic spaceship, you're building a money-making machine.

# Benefits: Why FunnelXAi is Your New Best Friend

# My FunnelXAi Beta Test: From Skeptic to Believer

When I first heard about FunnelXAi, I'll admit I was skeptical. Another AI tool promising the moon? But as a beta tester, I had the chance to put it through its paces, and boy, was I in for a surprise.

I decided to create a funnel for a new e-book I was launching. Normally, this process would take me at least a week, between designing the pages, writing the copy, and setting up the funnel logic.

With FunnelXAi, I had a complete funnel up and running in under two hours. TWO HOURS! The AI-generated design looked sleek and professional, and the copy... well, let's just say it was better than what I would have written after my third cup of coffee.

But the real test came when I launched the funnel. In the first 24 hours, my conversion rate was 23% higher than my previous best-performing funnel. By the end of the week, I had sold 152 copies of my e-book, smashing my previous launch record.

The best part? I spent more time promoting the launch than I did creating the funnel. FunnelXAi didn't just save me time; it made me money.

About me: As a person I am someone who has a mission oriented mindset, where once I set my mind onto something I try my very best to archive it even through the odds of succeeding are slim to none because my motto in life is "" it is better to try and fail than to never try and have regrets"".

My personality: a positive outlook on life, outgoing, friendly and believes in learning from my mistakes and is always striving to change, adapt and become someone better.  
  
At my core - I  am someone focuses on Physical health and wellness, perseverance and dedication, goal oriented and mission focused. If I set my mind towards a goal, I try archive it even when all the odds are against me.  

For instance, when I was fourteen years old I wanted to become a pilot even though I was terrible at mathematics and physics. Despite this I ended up studying for over 500 hours. Where I would wake up in the morning at 6 o'clock on Monday and go to sleep on Wednesday, at 12 o'clock midnight and in order to stay awake I woud drink two liters of plain Coffee just to stay awake so I could stay awake and study. During the Afternoon, I would suffer from stomach pain as a result of this. In the end I ended up failing the exams due to the extreme mental and physical pressure I had been putting on my body and affter the failure when I visited a psychiatrists and a doctor I was told that had l continued for another three months all of my organs would have shut down, In laymens terms I would have collapsed, dead at 17. Despite the major setback, I picked myself up and tried to succeed at something different.


The other small things I wanted to archieve was to buy an iPhone, FX Nikon camera and lenses, travel abroad to other countries. All of which I accomplished by 2019 at the age of 24. The only dream I have not fully accomplished is getting married.

My ideal dream wife is someone who is has a body type that is slim to average (as I have the same type) and white (my skin is Tan) and someone from another country as I believe that two different people growing up in different cultures and countries from different backgrounds can help build a more interesting relationship, which is something I know for a fact as I dated someone from the other side of the world. 

How I nearly accomplished this dream. I met a women online on a marriage website who was from South America and met my requirements almost perfectly expect for the age factor which I got to know much much later after I fell in love withh her. 

People say I am crazy and I probably was, and I am sure I would have said the same before but as the saying goes ""love is blind"". I see it as an extreme test I went through where I found out far I was willing to tolerate and be how loyal and faithful I am to someone regardless of how that person's appearance changes when I truly love someone despite that fact that my mind froze for a few minutes when I first saw her as I was not expecting to see someone who looked like 50 compared to the photos she she had sent me where she looked like a 25 year old. It also revealed a lot of other aspects about me where I was patient when getting scolded for something small as arriving 10 minutes early (yes, early). In fact, I never argued back or scolded her as I never wanted to hurt her feelings in any way. This is of course is unhealthy and have come to realize that a relationship where both partners are equal is the way to go. Letting one partner take over completely and have the upper hand can create a lot of pressure and stress"".   
  
This previous relationship also showed me that one day when I marry someone, I will never leave even if that person ends up in a wheelchair, has paralysis on her face or anything, I will love her unconditionally no matter what. To be honest, this is a surprise to myself, as I always had doubts as to whether I am truly someone can be loyal and committed and this previous relationship proved that all my doubts were wrong.

The whole trouble with me is that I am a person who is too versatile, adaptable and can change based on the circumstances in life or to the person I am with which tends to make a women feel that I not being completly honest with myself.

Family: No siblings, just my parents.  
  
My hobbies and Interest are wide and diverse. I just grab whatever opportunity comes my way and try my best to make the best out of it. A few examples are climbing a an active volcano to the summit and singing a song at the summit ""your my little earthquake, oh let the earth shake"". Heading out into the Ocean on a Jet Ski.  
  
Work: Marketing, where I am featured in some advertisements and can share a YouTube link where you can see me on video and how I speak as well as in Logistics in an Engineering firm at the moment. I once did own a company once, yet, had to shut it down due to COVID-19 followed by a national economic crisis.  
  
Smoking: Never have and never will. 
  
Education: Two Diplomas in IT and Business, a Bachelors Degree in Business  
  
House: I have my own  
  
My values and beliefs: I strongly believes in the marriage values of ""no cheating"", ""being loyal"",  ""till death do us apart to love each other through sickness and health"" and always being completely honest.  

Financial Management: I write down all my expenses in a Spreadsheet and budget accordingly. This method helps me know exactly what I spent on and on what. As such it does not matter to me in a marriage if both husband and wife share bank accounts or keep the finances separate. .   
  
Preferred relationship style: Equal as I was in one ridiculous relationship with someone 10 years older than me who was very strict, controlling and short tempered and I know what it feels like be under constant pressure and feel like I am constantly walking on egg shells. I have written more about this relationship I was in to highlight some positive aspects about me which I honestly did not know about myself.  

Christianity: I would prefer to marry a Christian women, however finding someone is quite difficult and challenging. Somehow, every women who has taken on interest in me has been a non christian.

If you have read this far and would like to get to know me better, then send me a message and we can chat. Although, personally, I love voice calls as it helps create a deep connection in terms of emotion and just makes it easy to get the message across without misunderstanding.

Up until a few months ago, I took about 7 years off from drinking caffeine.  It certainly lowered my anxiety levels, but it did seem to creep up my depression symptoms.  I've always dealt with both my entire life.  

My sensitivity to caffeine is good and bad.  The good is that I only need like 1 cup of coffee to get amped up and quitting seems to be easier due to a low tolerance.  The bad is it seems to linger in my system much later in the day.  I started drinking caffeine again a couple months ago, this was about a month after I cut out alcohol.  Long story short, it seems to have slowly wreaked havoc on my sleep.  When I take a day or two off now, I zonk out hard and don't seem to have the same tossing/turning insomnia in the early AM hours.

This all surprises me considering I never drink caffeine after 11AM (a lot of studies indicate caffeine before noon shouldn't effect your sleep).  I still enjoy coffee, but I guess I'll need to cut back my frequency of use again.

20 units WHEN!?

I'm wondering if you could help me better understand if I should back off with a co-worker that I really like and want to be friends with. He is a 2w3 sp/so and I am a 9w1 sx/sp. 

I posted about him [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnneagramType2/s/VcuRGgIsvV), for important context on our current standing.

He recently came back from long term sick leave as he was on the verge of burnout and having a difficult situation at work. 
The day before coming back to work, he answered my text from two months earlier,  apologized for not answering sooner as he didn't have the mental space, said he knew what kind of difference he made for me in the past year (something I mentioned in my text) but it was nice of me to say it, and ""let's go for that walk and coffee in the coming period"".
We briefly talked the next day at the office but I couldn't even ask how he was doing, he was very quick in saying that he was happy the situation was resolved, happy to be back and he'd be working on reduced hours and he couldn't say much else about what he agreed with HR.

The next day was my birthday, which he forgot and was weird, since he has all other team members bdays in his calendar. He did send me his wishes the following day, and asked me how I celebrated. The days after that he went to sit in the farthest spot in the office from where I was sitting, and never initiated conversation.

Fast forward to three weeks later and we still haven't talked. I didn't want to be too smothering and he's working reduced hours, but I did mention twice if he wanted to chat. Yesterday I offered to bring coffee from the kitchen to my colleagues, him included, and he stood and came with me. We did some small talk since we hadn't spoken in a while, and when we were coming back upstairs I said ""You're still up for that walk & coffee?"" He immediately said yes, that he had a thirty minutes call but then he'd be free for the next two hours, and then he'd have to leave. But then he only texted 20 minutes before he had to leave saying if we could do another day. I don't know, we keep postponing and it's starting to feel like he's doing me a favor while all I wanted was to know how he's doing. 

I thought a bit about the past months and realized that ever since he's not my manager anymore, every time we've gone for walks and lunch break I was always the one who initiated it (I reread our thread on Teams to make sure I wasn't imagining things) and always the one checking in on him when things started going bad. 

Is it possible that he's clearly shown some signs that he definitely doesn't want to be friends and I completely missed them, and he doesn't know how to politely decline my requests? Should I stop?
I don't like feeling like I'm a teenager with a crush trying to interpret the other person's every move, but I am genuinely confused now if he enjoys my presence or not. As a sx/sp 9 I tend to daydream about people I like and merge with them and I am now wondering if I completely misunderstood the situation and I'm making a fool of myself.

1g6j2m1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/1g6j2m1/defi_done_the_kendu_way/,DeFi done the Kendu way,"**About me**

I'm nothing special. Trading crypto for two years now. Started out carefully with just top 15 assets with the idea of building some gains higher than my bankaccount would provide for me. A year ago I started dabbling into low marketcap memecoins. Made some mistakes to learn, made some good trades. Basically managed to double my initial investment. Nothing special in meme land, but I'm a smart guy and I learn fast.

**About you**

Several reasons why you could be here reading. I'm going to assume you've heard about Kendu because it's pretty much impossible to not have.

1. You're a confident holder and you are here to read and share alpha. Welcome, I hope I don't dissappoint!
2. You're a holder and you are in doubt. You want to know more and have questions. Welcome! I hope my post will support you in some way. Please feel free to ask, me or anyone else in the KenduArmy will happily answer your questions. But even better: join the TG or one of the many X developer spaces with Miazaki and ask him your questions.
3. You're not into Kendu but sincerely want to know more because it's sparking an interest. Please read on. I hope I can help you make a decision on joining or not.
4. You'don't like Kendu and are just here to spread FUD. I'm not writing this for you. I know Reddit well enough to know that some just don't want information but just want to hate. You probably didn't even read a word of this post. Goodbye, have a nice life!

**Hype vs managing expectations**

People that know me from the TG know that I'm a realistic guy. I prefer real alpha over rumours. My believe is that it's better to surprise people with news that's actually better than the rumours, in stead of creating hype that in the end turns out to be a disappointment. But that makes bullposting about a memecoin hard. Many things happen behind the scenes and there will always be speculation. I try to manage expectations, but also realise many things start their own life. There is lots of alpha in Kendu and much is speculation. I'm trying to stick to the facts as much as possible.

**About Kendu**

Kendu had an all time high of 280MC and is about 7 months old. It's now sitting between 40 and 50 MC. That seems far off the ATH and consolidation is really taking longer than most expected. When I joined Kendu right before ATH Miazaki was talking about 1B MC in July and 10B MC before the end of the year. It's clear the first didn't happen and the second will need some sort of miracle. However, I've been realistic since the start and that helps with not losing faith. I've been buying Kendu all the way down to the lowest point of 35MC a few weeks back and am still buying. Why? Because I have rock solid faith that Kendu willl make me lifechanging money. We will go to 10B and far beyond.

**From the outside looking in**

Over 90% of crypto traders are chartgazers. And that's fine. In most cases a chart will tell you everything you need to know about an asset, if you look at the right things. Even though I don't believe in TA for small MC coins, it is clear to see when a coin is over or when it is on the rise. Looking at Kendu all time high and the current price action I can understand people feeling negative when they are unknowing of what's actually going on. Especially with all the pump&dump shit going around. I will explain below why with Kendu things are really different.

**Alpha**

* Marketcap: Kendu has been sitting at a 40-55 million marketcap for some time now. Thats roughly a 75% decline from all time high. However, that all time high was incredibly premature and mostly caused by catalysts. The number of holders at that time really didn't fall in line with the huge rally. It is much better in line now and basically you should look at Kendu as a new asset in DeFi. And looking at it in that way, we are outperforming almost every coin of the same age in numbers of holders, social media output and marketcap. The ones that reached higher in MC are funded by the market (Binance, are you reading?), not holders. Kendu is performing amazing. Just forget about that 280mc surge, begin your journey here.
* Shiba connection: One of the catalysts that caused our ATH is the connection we had with Shiba. That connection has mostly faded because a large part of the Shiba team sold their souls to the Cabal. It is what it is. However, our dev Miazaki is friends with Shytoshi and is often quoting Ryoshi and using Ryoshi PfP in his X messages. It makes many in the TG wonder if Miazaki is actually Ryoshi or in closer contact to him than anyone suspects. Especially because Miazaki once said he could pump Kendu to 1B with just two clicks on X.... But, this is typically what I was referring to earlier. Managing expectations vs creating hype. We don't know the truth (yet) but it doesn't matter. In Kendu everyone working for the brand is equally important.
* IRL assets (Decentralised Brand): we're in the DeFi space. But Kendu is more than that. We are not just looking at recycling DeFi money. We are not looking at bringing normies into DeFi. We are bringing the Kendu brand, in a decentralised way, to the people. The Kendu energydrinks are on sale online and finding there way to stores and universities (USA and Australia, for noe). Kendu Coffee will soon be released and brought under the attention of several coffeeshops and moviestudios in Hollywood. A community member is working on Kendu jewelry and someone will soon release a line of Kendu food supplements. There is Kendu Nights club events in India. All this to make Kendu a household name. Everyone in the community can release what they want under the Kendu name and is immediately sure he has thousands of potential customers and a huge KenduArmy working for promotion.
* Community: And that's the real strenght of Kendu. It's a marketing machine. It's a family. It's a cult. We're here for the long run and we are not going away until Kendu is a top 5 crypto with a 100B marketcap. There is no competition. I've been in many coins Telegram groups and all these CTO's, community driven cults and 'next whatevers' are literally in a different game. Name one and it's not even close community wise. They are botted, driven by payd KOL or influencers that dump as soon as it reaches a few million or become CTO after being rugged by the dev. Kendu is the only one thats worth looking at. The community is strong, real and unhinged to a level never seen before in crypto.
* Coinbase connection: Another hype thing, but one that cannot be denied. When advertising there new wallet, Coinbase used several names of huge cryptocurrencies. But up front and center was the name of Kendu. At that time a sub 100m memecoin, joined by all the great MC coins. Now, it could be just an intern with a Kendu bag seeing opportunity. But do you really believe that? Some think the Coinbase contract is already signed and just waiting for the right moment. I don't know if that's true. But there is definitely a link between Coinbase and Miazaki. Coinbase is probably the CEX with the best reputation out there, it doesn't have the foul stench Binance is acquiring at the moment. Real knows real.

**So.....**

I hope I gave you some insights into why I'm bullish on Kendu, despite (or thanks to) the current priceaction. And there is a lot more I'm forgetting to mention or leaving out because the article is getting to long. In short: Kendu is not your typical memecoin, it's a decentralised brand with more potential than anyone can see from the outside. That's why I want to invite everyone to visit our Telegram and to listen to our dev spaces. You really need to experience it to understand.

Kind regards and see you soon!
