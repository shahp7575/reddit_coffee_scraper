he is so clingy but ONLY with me. he will scream and cry ‚Äúmama‚Äù until i pick him up if he sees or hears me. if hes in his walker, hes tugging at my leg or bashing into my ankles to get my attention. cant even drink my coffee in the morning because he demands to be held and then dives for my coffee mug. i dont want to just let him cry (more than a couple minutes to see if he adjusts). 

please give any advice. i dont want to teach him that he will never need to sit in discomfort or that i will always give in (from a behavioral conditioning standpoint). if im being unrealistic also please be honest. but any suggestions/advice/etc is so appreciated.

1h5o4ts,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1h5o4ts/some_brevillespecific_tips_for_your_new_machine/,Some Breville-specific tips for your new machine [Breville Barista Express & Pro],"Beyond the general espresso advice in the beginner's' guide to dialing in, here are a few Breville-specific shortcuts to get you pulling great shots much quicker:

1. Adjust your burr calibration. For the Barista Express & Pro, the upper burr comes from Breville set far too coarse for most craft coffee. If your shots are running fast, start here. Remove the hopper, and you'll see the upper burr carrier. Its wire handle is also the calibration setting. Changing this from 6 to 2 is going to get you to a much better place.¬†[Here's how](https://youtu.be/GkKhhX1JPzE?si=2jrC_wkhaBEpCFMy&t=45). For the Touch & Oracle, you'll want to use 4-6 depending on the style of coffee.
2. Use a scale. That's not Breville-specific, but it is the only way you'll be consistent in your espresso workflow.
3. Dose 16g into the double basket. You may be able to fit 18g of lighter-roasted coffee or struggle to get 15g of darker roasted coffee in the basket, but we've found 16g to be the ideal dose for at least the coffees we roast. Larger doses tend to not have enough headspace above the puck, leading to inconsistent and uneven extraction.
4. Ditch the razor and pick up a WDT tool. You just want to break up any clumps in the coffee grounds and evenly distribute them in the portafilter basket before tamping. You don't have to spend money for this - you can get the job done with a safety pin. If you buy a tool, it's just the one you like the look & ergonomics of the best.
5. Time your shots. From when you press the button to start a shot until it's done pulling, you should be in the 20-35 second range. Each grind wheel adjustment on the Barista Express generally correlates to a 3 second change, and each step on the Pro is about half that.
6. Try a yield (liquid out) that's 2.5x the dose of the coffee. For a 16g dose in the portafilter, that means 40g in your cup. More classic chocolatey espresso will do better at a 2:1 ratio, and some of the more wild coffees may be better at 3:1.
7. If your espresso is too sour, grind finer (smaller number). If it's bitter and drying, grind coarser (bigger number). If you're nearing the grind wheel limits, go back to step 1 and adjust the burr calibration. There's a dashboard on¬†[this page](https://perccoffee.com/pages/breville)¬†that maps where each grind setting correlates on different burr calibrations.",1,1733234720.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it‚Äôs time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero‚Äôs journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can‚Äôt even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don‚Äôt wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

Social media has destroyed humanity. I let it ruin me and now I'm taking my life back. 
The irony in me using a social media platform to address my social media outlook  is another topic. For now I'm comforted in knowing no one else knows who I am here. That and I'm too old to brows the rest of this reddit platform and learn what it's about. I'll just stick to my profile. My daily entry exercise.

After months of coding, debugging, and countless cups of coffee, it's finally ready to launch this week!

Usually when developing REST APIs, I often switch between IntelliJ IDEA and Postman. But I thought, wouldn't it be more convenient to develop and test REST APIs all in one place? Which led me to creating this plugin. I hope this plugin will be better than the built-in HTTP Client, and compatible with the IntelliJ IDEA community edition.

**Here's what it can do:**

1. **API client**: Detect endpoints in Spring projects from Java/Kotlin code, generate requests, and send them with just one click.
2. **Generate OAS definition**: Generate OpenAPI spec based on Spring annotations and **Javadoc**/KDoc comments, without any Swagger annotations. It also works smoothly with existing Swagger annotations if you're working for your company's project.
3. **Export API documentation**: Export API docs in formats including OpenAPI (Swagger), HTML, Markdown, Postman, and more.
4. Additional features include automatic request parameter filling, tree structure display, and response parsing‚Äîall within your IDE.

The plugin is designed to work out-of-the-box with zero configuration. Furthermore, it also has highly flexible customization options for advanced users. If you're tired of copying URLs and parameters back and forth, or dealing with bulky annotations, this plugin could be just what you need.

**The best part?**

I want to make this tool **FREE** to help as many developers as possible!

**Why did I post this?**

I'm moving closer to the official release and that's why I am eager to get feedback from devs like you. For example, would anyone need support for other web frameworks like **Quarkus** and **Helidon**?

I haven‚Äôt told any of them how I really feel and its better that way. 

For context: I‚Äôm a musician who makes half a living off of playing gigs on violin, viola, or both. I also have AuDHD that went undiagnosed for most of my life and as a result I have a lot of mental health issues and bad habits i‚Äôm trying to unlearn while still passing off as a functional human. I started doing gig work fairly recently after nearly a decade of nothing because of a really bad mental health break I had around 2014. 

This past April I got my first ever ‚Äúbig-time‚Äù gig, without giving away specifics, it was basically a weeklong workshop culminating in a recorded performance in the North SF Bay. I‚Äôm more familiar with the scene around SF but the majority of the musicians on this gig were from LA so I was pumped knowing that I would be playing with pros.

Part of this gig‚Äôs deal was that I would be staying in an AirBNB a short drive away from the venue with two of the other musicians in the group (referred from here on in as R and M). I let them know I had AuDHD, so if I get overexcited or anything like that please don‚Äôt be afraid to tell me at the first possible instant so we don‚Äôt have any friction. I remember this spawning a conversation about all of our neurodivergencies, so I assumed (foolishly) that I was in good company. I then tried to take every opportunity I could to get to know people and perhaps find leads on more work or just vibe in addition to my basic gig responsibilities.

Everything goes fine for the first 2-3 days, I feel a good rapport with my housemates, we‚Äôre hanging out smoking weed in the backyard after rehearsals talking about music, life is good. Day 3 or 4 comes around and I notice a shift in the energy. People are still talking with each other the same, but I notice people only talk to me when they have to, otherwise they‚Äôll ignore me. People are also suddenly getting very snappy at me about the smallest things, to the point where I started to close up again. 

Here‚Äôs where I may have made it worse, on one of the days there was a dinner party with lots of wine being passed around. I don‚Äôt usually drink wine but that night I was practically drinking from the bottle. 

At some point I drunkenly made a joke about R not liking me, which I either didn‚Äôt realize or didn‚Äôt think much about until the next morning. I woke up, showered, got coffee, had a smoke in the backyard, and when I came in, R had already left, and when I got in the car with M, they confronted me. First it was about the joke, saying that it was manipulative and unprofessional. Then M proceeds to finally tell me why everybody‚Äôs so cold, and it turns out I had been unwittingly annoying the crap out of R and they didn‚Äôt want to be the one to confront me. M continued on, basically dressing me down for this as well as smoking weed (which they‚Äôve all done as well) and then had the nerve to finish it with ‚Äúi‚Äôm not trying to lecture you or tell you you‚Äôre a bad person its just tough love‚Äù.

Mind you, I don‚Äôt know any of these damn people, let alone love them, and there was definitely no love in whatever the hell that lecture was. I had to spend the remainder of the week sitting in between these two in rehearsals as they texted each other about me (they weren‚Äôt very subtle about hiding their screens) and I finished the gig not wanting do music ever again. I followed some of the artists on social media over the course of the week, but every time I see them these days I want to rip my eyes out because of this experience. 

I‚Äôve been wrestling with this for the past 7 months and at least once a month I have a major breakdown where I want to quit music and leave the scene altogether, but I can‚Äôt because I have no other marketable skills. I‚Äôm in therapy, but talking can only do so much, especially when doing a job I once actually loved is turning into another CPTSD trigger.

We're back! Fingers crossed today's post actually makes it through whatever PsyOp reared its head again yesterday. We've got a lot to talk about, so let's get right to it!

Key questions for today:

1. What happened yesterday?
2. What does this second day of shorting mean for the integrity of our bull trend?
3. Where do we go from here?

Let's go!

**Price Movement Recap**

So what happened yesterday? Well, this:

[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/Mojomaster5\/comments\/1h4w62b\/repost\_rebound\_off\_504hr\_sma\_incoming\_gme\_122\/](https://preview.redd.it/1e2ix2879m4e1.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=36d26e96494b049cdad6d9be20dffdce3109f233)

We can see this directly reflected in yesterday's price action:

[$GME Trading Day 12\/2 1min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/ugulqrmx8m4e1.png?width=1493&format=png&auto=webp&s=c07f5455c1cbcf600f3d5f11eb2b9c03ecccb0d4)

The day began by respecting our intraday gamma hedging structure as described yesterday, opening above our 50 4hr-SMA (at around $28.50 for the day) and trading up toward our Call Wall at $30 in a tight range. However, on a third test of our 50-4hr SMA, an institution or institutions decided to drop hundreds of thousands of shares of targeted short volume right when the test was materializing. Finding some gamma hedge support at $28, the fall hit a speed bump and began to recover mildly before short volume pick back up again (hundreds of thousands of shares, buttressed by bearish options trades) dropping the price down to our next Call Gamma support at $27 - in fact below it to what looks to have been a technical support at the 100-4hr Simple Moving Average:

[10\/18-12\/3 4-hr Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/d57808zcam4e1.png?width=1070&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e3bd8a4de0ec093fc973de4ff7e92f0aabedb3d)

Indeed, if the available shares to borrow data published by IBKR are any indication of how many short shares needed to be settled after yesterday's trades, then we can deduce that possibly as many as 1.4mil shares were borrowed to be dumped on the tape throughout the day:

https://preview.redd.it/coxyadzbbm4e1.png?width=435&format=png&auto=webp&s=19fdf2e6bd870c04590d816f8c90e8b72220e20c

Now you might think '1.4mil shares? How does that matter? We traded 10x that number yesterday.' Indeed, we did, but keep in mind that the introduction of concentrated short volume at key points in the trading landscape will cause substantial delta depreciation across near-the-money Call OI positions and overcome the peak of downside support from MM gamma hedging. The result is that those 1.4mil shares will be accompanied by millions of shares of sales as MMs shed hedges for their short call positions as the price moves down, which drives the price down, which causes more share hedge sales, etc. As user mrskint commented yesterday in a way something like a measured reverse gamma ramp (but not exactly), stopping only at key levels of gamma hedging resistance (where as gamma squeezes tend to stop in areas of Neutral gamma hedging). 

I assumed yesterday this type of activity was less likely than the reversal scenario I outlined yesterday specifically because on most days institutional activity tends to work with, rather than against, the organic flows of trader sentiment in the options market. In fact, I would say that is how trading days play out 95% of the time (if we take as a sample, for example, the last 110 trading days where we've seen bear trends, bull trends, and range-bound trading at various points) and even more rarely on back-to-back occasions. Nevertheless, low-probability events like this that unexpectedly shatter a substantial amount of our trading infrastructure do in fact occur.

The result of this occurrence is that at large the GME market now finds itself searching for points of stability across the trading landscape to determine to what degree our previous architecture will be salvaged and to what extent it will be transformed into a new paradigm.

**Technicals**

[10\/18-12\/3 4hr Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/1tabbh2ffm4e1.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1602b2f6f4dced6c27297c4b5f5f0ec7f9cb6ab)

I want to come to our technical analysis first today before we come to our options data since our nearer-term trading structures have been so challenged by exceptionally large institutional interventions over the past two days. The primary question facing our movement now is this dilemma as I've outlined it above.

Up until yesterday, you can see clearly above how our 50-4hr SMA has served as a scrupulously respected technical support for our upward trading channel since we launched off of it from the Cat-Day CATalyst. As I've written about over the past essentially month now, this level has lined up quite closely with RSI Neutral (=50) which we have used as an intratrend-relative 'oversold' signal. These twin signals have coincided with the precise beginning of upside reversals in the price four times within this paradigm retracing to the downside only after an RSI overbought signal (RSI > 70), as I have sketched.

Let me be clear: this specific paradigm with its 50-4hr SMA guiderail and its attendant RSI signals is now dead. It has lost its validity as a technical predictor according to the parameters that it previously imposed. This does not mean that these levels are no longer meaningful, but they now transform insofar as they may offer new guidance moving forward.

The key to seeking an answer on this question today will be answered, so far as I can tell presently, by our behavior with respect to the 100-4hr SMA.

The 100-4hr SMA? Why?

I hear you. I do not normally turn on the 100SMA on my charts since it has not very frequently acted as a meaningful technical signal in trades I've executed over the past several years. I noticed, however, that RK had it on during his chart posts on X during the 2020 uptrend (along with the 50SMA). Here:

[RK's Daily Chart from 27 Nov 2020](https://preview.redd.it/dyxfgfxmjm4e1.png?width=1487&format=png&auto=webp&s=8dfd27a1f55836e1194137917634b56f29d406b4)

RK's 2020 Daily Chart here was the first to tip me off to the uptrend pattern I saw emerging on our 4hr chart over the past month. As you can see, this three-SMA complex (here a 20-day, 50-day, and 100-day SMA) was largely meaningless on our daily timeframe (what proved to be our most salient medium-term frame in the 2020 run-up period) up until our upward trend emerged. After three periods testing the 20-day SMA (stacked atop the 50-day and 100-day SMAs in order) and 4 RSI overbought signals, GME was heavily shorted down from $16 all the way to $10.50 in a single week at the end of October. It then consolidated for two weeks atop the 50-day SMA throughout early November before heading back to $16 by the end of the month ahead of earnings.

Seeing the relationship of these three SMAs, I decided to turn on the 100 SMA yesterday during trading and saw that it formed this similar 1-2-3 fanned-out sequential stacking pattern in our uptrend. It was also just about $0.10 below our low yesterday where our price reversed (as I have sketched on our chart above). 

Given this behavior, it seems like our search for stability concerns a dilemma with respect to this moving average, namely, does it matter as a technical support? If the market response to this is 'yes' then we might look to consolidate atop this level during the course of this trading week in a similar fashion to RK's daily chart from 2020. Under these conditions, the 50-4hr SMA would transform into a resistance level in the short-term while it rests at $28.50, aligning with the historical resistance properties of that price level during our trading in the week leading up to 11/15 OPEX. $28.50 would make a good candidate for an overhead again until the 100-4hr SMA set up to cross above the 50-hr SMA. 

Now, this technical level \*looks\* like it has already served as a candidate for support and consolidation based on our behavior yesterday. What strikes me as the only factor that might thwart this is a decision by those same shorting institutions to dump more short volume on the stock. In this event, our next technical support to our downside would be the 200-4hr SMA sitting now just above $24. 

Is this move likely to develop? 

Going off of what information tools are at my disposal, I would evaluate the likelihood of this move emerging as low (not impossible, but low). With our current price at $27, only 1.1mil shares available to borrow, and a substantial amount of MM gamma hedging support at $25 (beyond that price levels historic support properties), institutions would likely need some kind of outsized bearish news event to generate enough negative sentiment-induced sell pressure to push the price that far down in a single day. Nevertheless, this is still the question as it stands on our technical landscape and as much insight as I can provide from this angle.

Now let's take a look at our options data and see if we can garner some additional insight from other sources. 

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

Our OI data currently appears to offer support to our stabilization at $27 in the immediate term. 

[12\/6 OI Changes 12\/2-12\/3](https://preview.redd.it/gzcvd3jbrm4e1.png?width=1062&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a2c3bd93e5c3d27f496dcfad419009c1025ac22)

In this week's OI we see some notable new Put OI accumulating in the $25-$28 range with concentrations at $27 and $27.50. At the same time, traders opened a substantial number of Calls between $27 and $30 despite our downward day. Indeed, although our day was heavily bearish, our options premium sentiment imbalance was not critical, though indeed bearish:

https://preview.redd.it/28psv54srm4e1.png?width=616&format=png&auto=webp&s=58bb6ce92f185a8485af95a5c992caa289450727

With this being said, understandly our activity shifted down the chain a bit. However, most of our new Put activity is concentrated on this week's expiry only. A few Put trades show up on later expiries, but for now it seems that trader orientations to this downside move are angling toward capturing downside value in the short-term only - again, for now. There is some evidence at later strikes that a select few traders have opened Put positions in the $24 area in order to hedge the risk of a breach of our current support level. 

https://preview.redd.it/y27a4p1sqm4e1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=72882f92bdd232f9d21eb418381b1ef4dced19fb

As we look at our Max Pain data, we see that this increased Put activity has actually pushed our Max Pain strike for the week up to $27, a few pennies above our 100-4hr SMA and yesterday's hedging speed bump. Our OI structure for the remainder of December also has not budged from $25 for the remainder of the month, indicating that these past two days of heavy shorting have not been enough to disrupt our structure to a sub-$25 depth \*yet.\* Overall, these are good signs and provide a limit-horizon on the extent to which the past two days of heavy shorting have and have not challenged our trading structure.

**Gamma Exposure**

https://preview.redd.it/srotievmpm4e1.png?width=412&format=png&auto=webp&s=7df48430eb5843f22d45c8ad87c3a7323f8dde6d

We can see our Put GEX has lept up notably as a result of our new Put OI and our movement toward more gamma-negative negative territory and out of our heavily Call-Gamma-dominant range up around and North of $30. 

https://preview.redd.it/8l2j5aicqm4e1.png?width=483&format=png&auto=webp&s=474316eb728d767ec8c00d6bc5613cc1925c8c0e

As we take a look at our new daily MM gamma hedging structure, we can see many of the factors I've pointed out presenting themselves here. Below $27 we have our gamma flip line. This makes sense. With our 100-4hr SMA currently at $26.81 premarket, a breach of this area \*would\* signal continued downside momentum. Thus, a slightly gamma-negative regime makes sense for this area down until $25 where we can see there is still substantial Call Gamma. 

We can see the negatizing effect at $24 that some traders have had in prepping for a possible further retrace down to the 200-4hr SMA should the 100 not hold. There are not many traders who are betting on this yet, but more might be inclined to do so if institutions borrow every last share available and dump it on the tape today. If this were to occur (still low-probability, and I certainly wouldn't like it), it would probably cut deep enough to walk us down to the mid-$25 area, but not cut through it unless millions more shares become available magically somewhere (never put it past the Street, I guess, to pilfer ETFs as it suits them).

If, however, the onslaught is indeed done and those same institutions that shorted the stock over the past few days have established enough of a long position at a discount, then a return to the stable, but soft net-positive gamma territory above $27 will develop. $30 would resume its role as major upside resistance with bullish movement resuming a grind up pattern contingent on bullish options activity.

**IV Trends**

https://preview.redd.it/2s9ypwnh8m4e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9f2a1bc80a520c5646f8d267eea6f045254a20d

https://preview.redd.it/jufraqkrwm4e1.png?width=1212&format=png&auto=webp&s=6056fbb462af3f4297253364bd2588a100e022f1

Despite our plunge in price and corresponding IV decrease over the past couple days, our IV levels are still trending up overall. I thus suspect that the pre-earnings IV appreciation trend is still in place. If indeed our shorting episode has ended for the meantime and we consolidate, IV would still tick up overall. An episode of upward volatility in that range ahead of earnings (even if it does not return to last week's price highs) would still see a significant appreciation in IV based on this factor. I would anticipate some type of event like this leading up to earnings next Tuesday in order to exploit this dynamic.

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

The 100-4hr SMA has emerged as a support candidate in the immediate term. If indeed it does maintain this status, it will serve to preserve our overall uptrend, even though the sharp uptrend of our previous month of trading atop the 50-4hr SMA will nevertheless have been exhausted. The key to our observation today, thus, is our behavior around $27. Shorts could still come out hyper-aggressively and try to push us into $25 land, but this course of action would appear to exhaust all obvious means of direct price suppression and potentially overexpose the more hyperaggressive shorters. 

From our options data, traders are not yet betting on a longer term correction in the stock price and recognize the suitability of the $27 area (slightly above the 100-4hr SMA) as a support candidate. Things are certainly on the bumpy side ahead of earnings. In such times, it is extra incumbent upon us to be vigilant and scrupulous with respect to our data.

I hope this helps, friends! Cheers and good luck out there, everyone!

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*.

This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor.

I‚Äôm a woman in her mid 30s, diagnosed in 5th grade, so I‚Äôve known ADHD intimately my whole life. I‚Äôve medicated with Ritalin and Adderall in the past, but switching to Vyvanse about ten years ago was a game-changer in terms of success for me. I went from just surviving to thriving professionally in ways that wouldn‚Äôt have been possible for me unmedicated.

That said, I read on here a month ago about protein making meds work better. For the last decade, my routine was wake up at 6am, take meds with water and coffee, and be wildly productive from about 6:30am-2:00pm, where I‚Äôd see my meds start a slow but noticeable decline in efficiency. Because of unrelated gut health issues, I‚Äôve also voluntarily fasted every day from 9:00pm to 2:00pm, half of that time being asleep and the other half not having an appetite because of meds. That routine helped fix some serious gut health problems and, as ADHD people often do, I was adamant not to change what I‚Äôve found worked for me.

I asked my doctor about protein intake, and she said I should absolutely be taking my pill in the morning with a protein shake. I decided to give it a try, and‚Äîoh my god. It‚Äôs like an entirely new medication.

The downside: it doesn‚Äôt work as fast. I take my pill at 6:00 and‚Ä¶ go back to bed? At first I tried staying up and being productive, but my body would still be so tired and aching for sleep, so finally I stopped trying to wait for the meds to kick in and have just started going back to bed. I‚Äôve kept track of when it kicks in each day, and sure enough, every day it takes about two hours before I really feel the fog lift. Two hours! So much different from the old, nearly-instant effectiveness without protein + drinking coffee instead.

The upside: it lasts SO MUCH LONGER and is so much steadier throughout the day. The first day I tried this, I couldn‚Äôt sleep that night. I‚Äôve been taking this pill for a decade!! How is that just now a thing?! Now that I‚Äôve been at it for about two weeks straight, I become productive and ‚Äúneurotypical‚Äù around 8:00am and work efficiently until about 7:00pm, when I start to notice a natural feeling decline in the clarity, sharpness, and organized calm Vyvanse brings me.

I'm brand new to generators and just purchased an ecoflow delta 3 plus as my starter unit. My main goal is to be prepared for emergency outages mostly in the winter.

I don't have to worry about a heat source as I have a wood fireplace so it's really just to keep a few lights on, charge our devices, and maybe use the microwave or coffee machine a couple of times. Based on my calculations, without any solar charging or extra batteries I should be good for a couple of days just with this unit before needing to recharge. Eventually I'd want to expand its usage to include things like the fridge, maybe the TV and the router..etc. but I know I'd need more battery capacity for that.

Anyway, I'm wondering what tips you'd give a newbie entering the world of solar generators that you wish you knew when you first started down this path.

Should I go for solar panels next, or extra batteries?
Any maintenance tips?
Any safety measures I should keep top of mind?

TORONTO, Nov. 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **White Gold Corp. (TSX.V: WGO, OTCQX: WHGOF, FRA: 29W** ) (the ""Company"") is pleased to announce an updated Mineral Resource Estimate (‚ÄúMRE‚Äù) for its flagship White Gold project located approximately 95 km south of Dawson City in west-central Yukon, Canada. The updated mineral resource includes a significant increase in total gold ounces, including a 18.5% increase in inferred resources and an 4.3% increase in indicated resources. The White Gold project now comprises 1,203,000 ounces of gold in the Indicated Resource category (17.7 million tonnes averaging 2.12 g/t Au) and 1,116,600 ounces of gold in the Inferred Resource category (24.5 million tonnes averaging 1.42 g/t Au) at US$2,000/oz gold. The gold resources at the White Gold Project are near surface, almost entirely captured within an open pit, and remain open for expansion in multiple directions with additional opportunities to increase total resources via targets within close proximity. Additional increases to the size of the resource may also be possible through an ongoing analysis of the resource block model and by capturing additional ounces hosted within the Target for Further Exploration area which hosts an additional estimated 10 ‚Äì 12 million tonnes grading between 1 ‚Äì 2 g/t Au. These results form part of the Company‚Äôs work program supported by strategic partners including Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (TSX: AEM, NYSE: AEM) and Kinross Gold Corporation (TSX: K, NYSE: KGC).

‚ÄúWe are very pleased to have further increased the size of our robust flagship deposit which is one of the highest-grade open pit gold resources in Canada of this size or greater owned by an exploration company. Furthermore, significant additional resource growth potential exists on the deposits themselves, as well as in the surrounding areas which has seen only limited exploration and has strong prospectivity for new discoveries. We are also very encouraged by the overall prospectivity of our district scale land package for additional gold and other mineral resource discoveries as this area of Yukon continues to evolve as an emerging Canadian mining camp supported by ongoing mine development efforts, infrastructure initiatives and other investment,‚Äù stated David D‚ÄôOnofrio, Chief Executive Officer.

* 24.472 million tonnes of Inferred Resources averaging 1.42 grams per tonne gold for 1.117 million ounces of gold, representing 48% of total resources.
* Inferred and Indicated Mineral Resources have increased by 18.5% and 4.3% respectively, compared to the previous 2023 MRE (

1. 

* 97.5% of the resources are near surface and within an open-pit. Indicated Resources of 1.201 million ounces of gold averaging 2.12 grams per tonne gold (an increase of 6.7%) and open-pit Inferred Resources of 1.061 million ounces of gold averaging 1.38 grams per tonne gold (an increase of 24.4%).
* Mineralization at the Golden Saddle, Arc, Ryan‚Äôs Surprise and VG deposits all remain open along strike and down dip to further expand the deposits and in addition to multiple underexplored targets in close proximity.
* The project also hosts an additional estimated 10 ‚Äì 12 million tonnes grading between 1 ‚Äì 2 g/t Au of material classified as a Target for Further Exploration which has not been included in the current resource which may further increase the size of the resource and is currently being evaluated in this regard.
* The Company is also currently evaluating additional opportunities to further increase the size of the resources by optimizing the block model and wireframes of the Golden Saddle and Arc deposits to add additional tonnage.

1. *Mineral Resources which are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.*
2. *The estimate of Mineral Resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant issues.*
3. *The Inferred Mineral Resource in this estimate has a lower level of confidence than that applied to an Indicated Mineral Resource and must not be converted to a Mineral Reserve. It is reasonably expected that the majority of the Inferred Mineral Resource could be upgraded to an Indicated Mineral Resource with continued exploration.*
4. *The Mineral Resources in this report were estimated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM), CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, Definitions and Guidelines prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and adopted by the CIM Council.*
5. *Open pittable resources are constrained by GEOVIA Whittle optimized pit shells using a 0.35 g/t Au cut-of grade and are considered to have reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction, assuming a gold price of US$2,000 per ounce, a C$:US$ exchange rate of 0.75. an open pit mining cost of CDN$3.25 per tonne, a processing and G&A cost of CDN$27.50 per tonne milled, and gold recoveries of 92% for Golden Saddle, and VG, along with 85% for Arc and Ryan‚Äôs Surprise. Underground resources assume a mining cost of CDN$120/tonne.*
6. *The following bulk density values for mineralized material were used: Golden Saddle (2.62 ‚Äì 2.65 t/m* *3* *), Arc (2.55 t/m* *3* *), Ryan‚Äôs Surprise (2.63 t/m* *3* *) and VG (2.65 t/m* *3* *).*
7. *High-grade gold assay values have been capped as follows: Golden Saddle and Arc (8 ‚Äì 18 g/t Au), Ryan‚Äôs Surprise (9 g/t Au) and VG (3 ‚Äì 10 g/t Au).*
8. *The Statement of Estimates of Mineral Resources has been compiled by Mr. Gilles Arseneau, Ph.D., P.Geo, of ARSENEAU Consulting Services (‚ÄúACS‚Äù). Mr. Arseneau has sufficient experience that is relevant to the style of mineralization and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity that he has undertaken to qualify as a Qualified Person as defined in the CIM Standards of Disclosure.*
9. *All numbers are rounded. Overall numbers may not be exact due to rounding.*

The current MRE for the White Gold project was carried out by Arseneau Consulting Services (‚ÄúACS‚Äù) of Vancouver, B.C. and is reported in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Securities Administrators National Instrument 43-101 (‚ÄúNI 43-101‚Äù) and has been estimated in conformity with generally accepted Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (‚ÄúCIM‚Äù) ‚ÄúEstimation and Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Best Practices‚Äù guidelines. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.

The MRE presents updated estimates for the Golden Saddle, Arc, Ryan‚Äôs Surprise and VG deposits.

The updated MRE was prepared using a block model approach using ordinary kriging interpolation for the Golden Saddle, Arc and VG deposits and inverse distance squared (‚ÄúID2‚Äù) interpolation for the Ryan‚Äôs Surprise deposit. Block model sizes varied between deposits as follows: Golden Saddle and Arc (10 m); Ryan‚Äôs Surprise (5 ‚Äì 10 m); and VG (10 ‚Äì 20 m). GEMS 6.8.4 software was used for generating gold mineralization solids, a topography surface, and resource estimation. Statistical analysis and resource validations were performed using non-commercial software and with Sage2001. Near surface resources were constrained using GEOVIA Whittle pit optimization software. Pit slopes in rock were assumed at 50¬∞ and the MRE assumes a long-term gold price of US$2,000 per ounce. Gold recoveries used were 92% for the Golden Saddle and VG deposits, and 85% for the Arc and Ryan‚Äôs Surprise deposits. Gold recoveries are based on metallurgical testwork results for the Golden Saddle and Arc deposits and are assumed for the Ryan‚Äôs Surprise and VG deposits based on their close similarities to the Arc and Golden Saddle deposits, respectively.

Mineralization on portions of both the Golden Saddle and Arc deposits is known to extend beyond the limits of the current resource estimate, however, the mineralization in these areas did not meet the criteria to be classified as Mineral Resources. Based on drilling at Golden Saddle and current geologic models, there is an estimated 10 ‚Äì 12 million additional tonnes grading between 1 ‚Äì 2 g/t Au of material classified as a Target for Further Exploration (‚ÄúTFFE‚Äù). The reader should be cautioned that the potential quantity and grade of the TFFE is conceptual in nature. There has been insufficient drilling to define a mineral resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being advanced to a mineral resource. These zones form more continuous mineralized units at US$ 2,000/oz gold and the Company plans to further evaluate this mineralization through re-modelling and optimization of the block model and wire frames to determine if it can be incorporated in future resource estimates.

A technical report to support the MRE for the White Gold project, prepared in accordance with NI 43-101, will be filed on SEDAR+ ([https://www.sedarplus.ca/](https://www.sedarplus.ca/)) and the Company‚Äôs website ([https://www.whitegoldcorp.ca/](https://www.whitegoldcorp.ca/)) within 45 days of the issuance of this news release.

**Resources & Opportunities in the White Gold District**

West-central Yukon is host to several highly prospective mineral districts, including the White Gold, Dawson Range, Klondike and Sixtymile districts. The Klondike was the epicentre of the historic Klondike Gold Rush in 1896 with over 20 million ounces of placer gold production having occurred in the region since that time. The Company‚Äôs property portfolio (Figure 1) which covers large portions of the White Gold District, was assembled by renowned prospector Shawn Ryan, and represents the largest claim package in the region, consisting of 15,876 claims across 26 properties and covering approximately 315,000 hectares. Two significant advanced projects border the Company‚Äôs claims in the south including the Coffee project owned by Newmont Corporation (TSX: NGT, NYSE: NEM) with Indicated Resources of 2.14 Moz at 1.23 g/t Au, and Inferred Resources of 0.23 Moz at 1.01 g/t Au ( 2 ) , and Western Copper and Gold Corporation‚Äôs (TSX: WRN, NYSE: WRN) Casino project, which has Measured and Indicated Resources of 7.6 billion lb Cu and 14.5 Moz Au and¬† Inferred Resources of 3.3 billion lb Cu and 6.6 Moz Au ( 3 )

All four of White Gold‚Äôs near-surface deposits are interpreted to represent structurally-controlled orogenic gold deposits, collectively form the Company‚Äôs gold resource base in the heart of its large land package, and remain open for expansion.

**Golden Saddle Deposit**

The Golden Saddle deposit is located 95 km south of Dawson City on the Company‚Äôs White Gold property (Figure 2), which is supported by the fully operational Thistle exploration camp with airstrip and barge access, and up to 100-person capacity. The deposit consists of the GS Main, GS Footwall and GS West zones and together the zones define mineralization over a 1,500 m strike length and up to 725 m down dip. Currently, the GS Main is the most significant zone in terms of estimated ounces and overall grade; containing approximately 95% of the Indicated ounces within the overall Golden Saddle deposit. GS Main Zone contains a consistent high-grade core of 832,000 gold ounces at a grade of 2.96 g/t gold in the Indicated category and 107,000 gold ounces at a grade of 3.18 g/t gold Inferred using a >1 g/t cut-off. Included in this high-grade core is 525,600 gold ounces at a grade of 4.68 g/t gold in the Indicated category and 81,900 gold ounces at a grade of 4.74 g/t gold Inferred using a >3 g/t cut-off.

Gold mineralization at the Golden Saddle deposit (Figure 2 & 3) is hosted in a meta-volcanic and meta-intrusive assemblage broadly consisting of felsic orthogneiss, amphibolite, and ultramafic units. Gold generally occurs as micron-scale blebs along fractures or encapsulated by pyrite, and as visible gold (less than 5 mm in size) located as free grains in quartz. Mineralization is present in quartz veins and stockwork or breccia with disseminated pyrite. Drill hole intersected gold mineralization is spatially co-incident with structures, and structures or faults which are interpreted to be the primary conduits for hydrothermal fluids responsible for gold deposition. The thicknesses of the mineralization and breccia zones are variable from 5 m to over 50 m, and they pinch and swell along strike. A consistent higher-grade core (> 3 g/t Au) occurs within the main zone at Golden Saddle. Gold mineralization at the¬†Golden Saddle deposit remains open in all directions and is known to extend beyond the limits of the current resource estimate, however, the mineralization in these areas does not currently meet the criteria to be classified as Mineral Resources.

**Arc Deposit**

The Arc deposit (Figures 2 & 3) is located approximately 400 m south of the Golden Saddle and consists of two zones, the Arc Main and Arc Footwall zones, both trending E-NE and dipping to the north at approximately 50 degrees. Mineralization at the Arc has been defined over 1,200 m in strike length and up to 450 m down dip with mineralization open along strike and down dip. Gold mineralization at the Arc deposit is less well understood than the Golden Saddle, which is partially a function of drilling at the Arc deposit being more widely spaced. Gold mineralization is hosted within a meta-sedimentary sequence dominated by banded (graphitic) quartzite and interbedded pelitic biotite schist that is cross-cut by numerous felsic to intermediate dikes and sills.

Gold mineralization appears to be focused within breccia and shear zones that have been affected by hydrothermal alteration and sulphide mineralization. Drilling has defined an upper main zone as well as a lower footwall zone of anomalous gold but of lesser tenure than the main upper zone. Mineralization remains open to the east, west and at depth. The occurrence of gold at Arc is not well understood but appears to be associated with disseminated and veined pyrite, arsenopyrite and graphite.

**Ryan‚Äôs Surprise Deposit**

Ryan‚Äôs Surprise (Figures 2 & 4) is located 1.5 km west of the Golden Saddle deposit, along a 6.5 km long x 1 km wide north-northwest trend of anomalous gold and arsenic in soils (‚ÄúRyan‚Äôs Trend‚Äù), which also hosts several other prospective early-stage targets in close proximity with significant surface gold mineralization and represent further potential for expansion of this project. Gold mineralization at the Ryan‚Äôs Surprise deposit is primarily hosted within a meta-sedimentary sequence dominated by banded (graphitic) quartzite and interbedded pelitic biotite schist cross-cut by numerous felsic ‚Äì intermediate dikes and sills.

Gold mineralization appears to be focused within breccia and shear zones that have been affected by hydrothermal alteration and sulphide mineralization. Recent drilling has defined multiple subparallel zones that are host to gold-bearing sulphide mineralization including arsenopyrite and pyrite, and range in true width from < 1 m to in some instances, > 10 m. The mineralization footprint at the Ryan‚Äôs Surprise deposit measures approximately 550 m north-south by 500 m east-west to a vertical depth of 650 m remains open along strike and at depth. Metallurgical work, and gold characterization and deportment studies are required to further determine accurate gold recoveries. However, host rocks, alteration and sulphide mineralization at Ryan‚Äôs Surprise display many similarities to the Arc Deposit.

**VG Deposit**

The VG deposit (Figure 5) is located approximately 85km south of Dawson City and 11km north of the Golden Saddle deposit. Gold mineralization at the VG deposit is hosted in quartz ¬± carbonate veins, stockwork and breccia zones, and pyrite veinlets, including cubic pyrite and visible gold, associated with intense-quartz-carbonate-sericite alteration, pervasive K-spar and hematite emplaced along en-echelon faults or shear zones. Visually, the style of gold mineralization and alteration appears identical to the Golden Saddle deposit, along with similar dominant host rocks of biotite-feldspar (¬± augen)-quartz gneisses. To date, no metallurgical testwork has been performed on the VG mineralization, however given its close similarities to Golden Saddle, gold recoveries are assumed to be similar.¬† Opportunities exist at the VG deposit to quickly upgrade a significant portion of Inferred Resources to Indicated, as well as for expansion of gold mineralization at depth and along strike. There are also several other prospective targets on the property which have received limited exploration work and offer potential for additional discoveries.

**Qualified Persons, Technical Information and Quality Control**

The MRE for the White Gold Project was prepared by Dr. Gilles Arseneau of Arseneau Consulting Services (ACS), an Independent Qualified Person (‚ÄúQP‚Äù) as defined under NI 43-101, who has reviewed and approved the contents of this news release. The technical content of this news release has also been reviewed and approved by Terry Brace, P.Geo. and Vice President of Exploration for the Company who is also a QP as defined under NI 43-101 ‚Äì Standards of Disclosure of Mineral Projects.

**QA/QC**

White Gold‚Äôs drill core sampling consisted of collecting samples over 0.50 m to 2.50 m intervals (depending on lithology and style of mineralization) over the entire hole length. RC samples were collected at continuous 1.5 m intervals. All drill core was cut in half using a diamond saw, with half of the core placed in sample bags and the other half returned to the core box. Standard, blank, and duplicate samples were inserted into both the drill core and RC sample streams at regular intervals to meet a designated QA/QC sample insertion rate. All samples were organized into batches, flown via fixed-wing aircraft from camp, and transported via courier to an ISO-certified laboratory for analysis.

EXPLORES CREATING NEW CRITICAL MINERALS ENTITY PORTFOLIO TO INCLUDE ITS COPPER, MOLYBDENUM, TUNGSTEN, ANTIMONY & OTHER PROSPECTIVE CRITICAL MINERAL TARGETS","https://preview.redd.it/b6ctjg9vym4e1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=931ecf4a7aa890d62b5033268c06542a28efc8f7

TORONTO, Nov. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **White Gold Corp. (TSX.V: WGO, OTCQX: WHGOF, FRA: 29W** ) (the ""Company"") is pleased to provide an overview and strategy update on its critical minerals portfolio including copper, molybdenum, tungsten, antimony, zinc, bismuth and other critical mineral targets on its district scale land package in the White Gold District (the ‚ÄúDistrict‚Äù) located in west-central Yukon, Canada. The Company‚Äôs ongoing gold exploration program has been very successful in delineating significant gold resources and discovering multiple additional prospective gold targets. Our systematic and extensive exploration in the District has also identified numerous critical mineral opportunities. The Company is currently evaluating accretive strategies to advance these projects to unlock further value for all stakeholders. Additional information and exploration results on priority critical mineral targets are outlined below.

White Gold Corp‚Äôs Yukon property portfolio includes 15,876 quartz claims across 26 properties covering 315,000 hectares (3,150 km 2 ), representing approximately 40% of the District and hosts the Company‚Äôs flagship White Gold Project which was recently updated to include 17.6 million tonnes averaging 2.12 g/t Au for 1,203,000 ounces of gold in the Indicated Resource category and 24.4 million tonnes averaging 1.42 g/t Au for 1,116,600 ounces of gold in the Inferred Resource category (1) and remains open for further expansion. Additional increases to the size of the resource may also be possible through an ongoing analysis of the resource block model and by capturing additional ounces hosted within the Target for Further Exploration area, which hosts an additional estimated 10 ‚Äì 12 million tonnes grading between 1 ‚Äì 2 g/t Au.

Shawn Ryan, Chief Technical Advisor & Director stated, ‚ÄúOne of the strengths of the White Gold property portfolio is the significant critical mineral potential, which nicely compliments the existing gold ounces and gold exploration potential. We have many very exciting targets, such as Bridget target on our Pedlar property, which remains one of the best (based on soils)¬†untested¬†copper-molybdenum porphyry targets in the district. It sits just north¬†of the enormous Casino copper-gold porphyry deposit and has never been diamond drilled. Our technical team has continued to advance these critical mineral targets as part of our ongoing regional exploration program, and we are equally excited to explore them further and strategies to maximizer their value‚Äù.

‚ÄúWhite Gold Corp. is a gold-focused exploration company and has been very successful delineating significant gold resources at our flagship White Gold Project, which is now one of the highest-grade open pit gold resources in Canada of such significant size owned by an exploration company. The Company‚Äôs deposits are also complimented by several new gold discoveries and prospective targets creating a very robust gold exploration pipeline in a highly prolific and underexplored area of the Yukon. Our exploration efforts have also identified numerous critical mineral opportunities which we believe to be quite prospective based on their size, the work done to date, underlying geology and how they compare to other targets and deposits. Yukon is widely viewed as one of the most geologically prospective and underexplored areas in Canada, so it came as no real surprise that our exploration produced such strong results in this regard as well. We look forward to further assessing value-accretive exploration and corporate opportunities on these critical mineral projects alongside the continued advancement of our robust gold exploration pipeline to build additional value,‚Äù stated David D‚ÄôOnofrio, CEO.

**Highlights**

* Exploration database on district-scale land package (Figure 1) including large soil geochemical database (280,000+ samples) includes several large-scale critical minerals anomalies (Cu, Mo, W, Sb, Zn, Bi) which have been unevaluated and largely undrilled.
* Underlying geology is prospective for several critical minerals, including copper, molybdenum, tungsten, antimony and bismuth.
* Existing critical mineral targets include but are not limited to the Bridget, Isaac, Mascot, Aries, Mount Hart, and Guilder targets
* Several of the Company‚Äôs critical mineral targets (Bridget, Isaac, Mascot) are located in the Dawson Range, an east-southeast trending mountain range which hosts several significant copper-gold porphyry deposits including the Casino deposit, the Minto Mine, and the Carmacks Project.
* Middle to Late Cretaceous aged intrusions are prospective for porphyry deposits containing primary sources of copper, molybdenum ¬± tungsten.
* Potential for antimony and bismuth as secondary metals also exists in several mineral deposit types on the properties including orogenic gold, intrusion-related gold, epithermal and porphyry (Bi) deposits.
* The Company is evaluating accretive opportunities to unlock the potential value of its critical mineral projects.
* Results from the Company‚Äôs 2024 exploration program to be released in due course.

The geology underlying the Company‚Äôs land package is prospective for several critical minerals, including copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), antimony (Sb) and bismuth (Bi) amongst others. Middle to Late Cretaceous aged intrusions are prospective for porphyry deposits containing primary sources of copper, molybdenum ¬± tungsten. The best example in the region is Western Copper and Gold Corporation‚Äôs (TSX: WRN, NYSE American: WRN) Casino copper-gold-molybdenum porphyry deposit, which contains Measured and Indicated Resources of 7.6 Billion lbs copper and 14.5 Moz gold and Inferred Resources of 3.3 Billion lbs copper and 6.6 Moz gold.

Potential for antimony and bismuth as secondary metals also exists in several mineral deposit types including orogenic gold, intrusion-related gold, epithermal and porphyry deposits.

The company also welcomes government support for the development of Yukon‚Äôs critical minerals opportunity including the recent announcement by Natural Resources Canada (""NRCan""), conditionally approving¬†$40 million¬†in federal funding to undertake pre-feasibility activities to advance a high-voltage transmission line network connecting the¬†Yukon¬†electrical grid to the North American grid in¬†British Columbia. This funding would be provided through the Critical Minerals Infrastructure Fund (""CMIF""). The announcement was made by the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, with the Honourable Josie Osborne,¬†British Columbia's¬†Minister of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation, and Yukon Premier the Honourable Ranj Pillai. This recent announcement along with other initiatives continue to demonstrate the importance of investments in critical minerals infrastructure to enable¬†Canada¬†to capitalize on the country's rich critical minerals and other resources.

A summary of select critical minerals targets identified to date on the Company‚Äôs claims is provided below.

**Critical Minerals Target Overview**

**Bridget Target, Pedlar Property**

The Bridget target (Figure 2) is a large 3 km NW-SE by 3.5 km NE-SW Copper-Molybdenum porphyry target geochemically zoned with a molybdenum-copper-bismuth core and a silver-zinc-lead-tungsten halo (see Company News Release dated March 27, 2024). It is situated in the north-central part of the Pedlar property 28 km northeast of the Casino deposit, and represents one of the most significant molybdenum anomalies in the region which has never been diamond drill tested. Based on the geochemical anomaly size, intensity, and geological and geophysical features, Bridget is considered by the Company as a high priority porphyry target.

Geologically, the target is underlain by hornblende gneiss, biotite schists, and calc-silicate altered marble (skarn), intruded by quartz eye granite and aplite dikes. The soil geochemical footprint of the anomaly is characterized by Mo-in-soil values as high as 321.9 ppm Mo, including 278.9 ppm Mo, 265.4 ppm Mo, 263.5 ppm Mo, 257.2 ppm Mo, and 253.3 ppm Mo with over 400 additional samples returning values greater than 20 ppm Mo. Across the target, anomalous Cu-in-soil values exceeding 100 ppm Cu are common with the most significant enrichment occurring at the core with values as high as 710.1 ppm Cu, including 662.6 ppm Cu, 594.7 ppm Cu, 492.9 ppm Cu, 406 ppm Cu observed over a roughly 900 m x 900 m area. Other notably enriched critical minerals include tungsten (W), with the highest concentrations observed in the northern half of the target area, where soil sampling has yielded values up to 101 ppm W, with values exceeding 30 ppm W common. Other anomalous metals including Pb, Bi, As, Zn, and Ag are typically observed over two large northwest-southeast oriented fault systems which cut the target in the north and in the south. In 2023 a single deep-penetrating Induced Polarization ‚Äì Resistivity survey line was completed over the Bridget target with five chargeability anomalies identified. The chargeability anomalies generally correspond with a zone of low resistivity which underlies a large molybdenum-copper soil anomaly. The newly identified chargeability anomalies are completely untested.

The Company is currently planning its 2025 exploration programs and has prioritized the Bridget porphyry target for an early season Induced Polarization (IP) ‚Äì Resistivity geophysical survey. Maiden diamond drilling will be planned to test the highest ranked anomalies.

**Isaac Target, Hayes Property**

The Isaac target (Figure 3) measures approximately 2 km E-W by 1.5 km N-S with a central bismuth-arsenic enriched core measuring from 750 m to 1,000 m which is surrounded by a > 400 m wide halo of anomalous silver, lead and zinc. Anomalous copper occurs in the southern portion of the core, and a relatively small area of anomalous molybdenum occurs near the core‚Äôs northern margin. The target is located in the central part of the Hayes property 38 km east of the Casino deposit and is a geochemically zoned multi-element soil anomaly associated with a mapped unit of Late Cretaceous Prospector Mountain suite intrusive rocks. (see Company News Release dated March 27, 2024). Anomalous copper-in-soils occurs in the southern portion of the core, and a relatively small area of anomalous molybdenum occurs near the core‚Äôs northern margin. Within the peripheral halo, silver-in-soil values range from 1 ppm Ag to as high as 16.9 ppm Ag, including 12.3 ppm Ag, 12.2 ppm Ag, 11 ppm Ag, 10.2 ppm Ag, 9.8 ppm Ag, while values > 3 ppm Ag are very common. Also, within this halo, lead-in-soil values occur as high as 3310.4 ppb Pb including 957.5 ppm Pb, 832.8 ppb Pb, 748 ppm Pb, 689.1 ppb Pb, with associated zinc-in-soil values as high as 1747 ppb Zn including 1360 ppm Zn, 1137 ppm Zn, 941 ppm Zn, 763 ppm Zn, 729 ppm Zn, and 713 ppm Zn.

A limited 2022 prospecting and mapping program included the collection of 19 rock grab samples returning values as high as 1269.2 ppm Cu, 106.02 ppm Mo, 27.265 ppm Ag, 3100.1 ppm Zn, 2624.78 ppm Pb, 378.52 ppm Bi, and two samples returning over-limit values for Li (> 2000 ppm Li). The geochemical zonation seen in soils and supporting hyperspectral analysis of rock samples indicate that the anomaly may represent the surface expression of a copper-molybdenum porphyry core surrounded by distal or epithermal style silver-lead-zinc mineralization.

In 2023 two deep-penetrating Induced Polarization ‚Äì Resistivity survey lines were completed over the Isaac target with a total of eight chargeability anomalies identified. The bismuth soil anomaly appears to be controlled by faults interpreted from the IP resistivity data. The bismuth and copper core of the soil anomaly is underlain by multiple chargeability anomalies which sit above a resistivity low that is interpreted as a fault structure. Lead, zinc, and silver, which form a halo around the core, are coincident with fault structures on the south side and north side of the survey area which trend NE (065¬∞) and NW (290¬∞) respectively. Isaac is a recently recognized (2021) target and has never been drilled tested.

**Mascot Target, Betty Property**

The Mascot target (Figure 4) on the Betty property covers a large cluster of gold-in-soil geochemical anomalies which include significant anomalous silver-zinc-lead-bismuth-antimony values measuring 4 km E-W x 4 km N-S interpreted as intrusion-related to epithermal style mineralization, indicating a sizeable mineralized system that appears to be controlled by structures measuring between 1-5 m in downhole width.

The Betty property is strategically located approximately 15 km northeast of the Casino deposit and 40 km east of Newmont Corporation‚Äôs (NYSE: NEM, TSX: NGT) Coffee gold deposit (Measured and Indicated Resources of 2.1 Moz gold at 1.28 g/t Au and Inferred Resources of 0.2 Moz gold at 1.04 g/t Au). The property is transected by the east-west striking Coffee Creek Fault which exerts important structural controls on the Coffee deposit. The property hosts several gold-in-soil anomalies, including the Betty Ford, Betty White, White East, Black Betty, and Mascot targets. Geologically the northern half of the Betty property is underlain by a folded package of quartzite, biotite gneiss, augen gneiss, minor marble, and hornblende gneiss of the Snowcap assemblage along with granodiorite, monzogranite, quartz diorite, and diorite from the Simpson Range. The southern portion of the property is underlain by Middle Cretaceous granite, granodiorite, quartz diorite and diorite of the Dawson Range Batholith of the Whitehorse Plutonic Suite, which hosts the Mascot target. To date the focus of hard rock exploration on the property has been for gold, however potential for critical minerals also exists.

In 2012, the previous operator Ethos Gold Corp. (now Prospector Metals Corp.) carried out an RC drilling program at Mascot, completing 61 holes totalling 7,132 m and in 2022 the Company carried out a limited RC and diamond drilling program following up on three of the known mineralized zones - Davis, Page and Boop (see Company news release dated November 28, 2022). Highlights of the 2022 diamond and RC drilling at the Davis zone included 1.48 g/t Au over 9.14 m in hole BETMAS22RC004, 1.14 g/t Au over 27.43 m in BETMAS22RC005, 7.42 g/t Au over 1.6 m in BETMASD007 and 2.02 g/t Au over 8.6 m and 1.25 g/t Au over 17.35 m in BETMAS22D008. At the Page zone, gold mineralization is associated with polymetallic (Au-Ag-Zn-Pb) veins and moderately clay altered, weakly oxidized northwest-striking structures with gouge hosted sulphides. Sulphide minerals comprise pyrite, sphalerite and galena. Previous drilling has been quite shallow to a vertical depth of only 125 m, and potential for more significant mineralization at depth exists. In addition to the Mascot, porphyry targets with critical minerals potential also exists to the north in the Isaac Creek area, and along the southern margin of the property along an intrusive contact. These areas remain completely untested.

**Aries Target, Wolf Property**

The Aries target (Figure 5) on Wolf property is an interpreted porphyry system that is characterized by a central zone of copper and molybdenum anomalies, surrounded by a large peripheral zone enriched in bismuth, arsenic, lead, and zinc. This forms a footprint measuring approximately 4 km in length (NE-SW) and 3 km in width (NW-SE). To the northeast, the Aries target transitions from a gold-dominant system into a potential porphyry system. This area‚Äôs molybdenum-in-soil values reach as high as 51.4 ppm, with the bulk of the anomaly showing values above 5 ppm. Copper-in-soil values peak at 923.9 ppm, with notable results such as 637.8 ppm, 630.8 ppm, and 600.6 ppm Cu, located near areas enriched in arsenic and bismuth. Previous drilling on the property has been gold-focused and the property remains largely untested and highly prospective for several critical minerals including Mo and Cu.

The Wolf property is located east of the White River, approximately 120 km south-southwest of Dawson City and 35 km west of the White Gold Project. Two main target areas have been identified on the property, the Aries and Taurus targets. The area is predominantly underlain by hornblende-biotite diorite intruded by medium-grained and megacrystic K-feldspar granites. These intrusions are associated with widespread biotite and potassic alteration, which are key indicators of potential porphyry mineralization.

To the north and northeast, the property is underlain by Late Cretaceous Carmacks volcanic units, including andesite and basalt flows, and siliciclastic basal conglomerates. Cu-Mo enrichment appears to be localized along the contact between these volcanic units and the adjacent granites while gold mineralization is concentrated in the southwestern part of the property (Taurus target) in shreddy biotite and k-spar altered hornblende-biotite diorites.

The Taurus target features a gold-in-soil anomaly that spans approximately 2 km long by 0.5 km wide, with maximum gold values reaching 358 ppb Au. The anomaly has an arcuate shape, trending east-west in the southwest and curving northeast-southwest to the east. GT Probe bedrock sampling returned gold values up to 1.22 g/t Au, with several samples exceeding 0.5 g/t Au. In 2023 RAB drilling of the target returned gold values of up to 0.81 g/t Au over 15.24m from 19.81m (hole WLFTRS23RAB002) including 6.55 g/t Au over 1.52m, along with 0.32 g/t Au over 30.47m) from 13.72m in hole WLFTRS23RAB002.

**Mount Hart Target, Nolan Property**

The Mount Hart target (Figure 6) is a large, multi-element soil geochemistry anomaly measuring 5 km N-S and up to 3.5 km E-W with values of up to 1120 ppb gold, 14.8 ppm silver, 1543 ppm arsenic, 81 ppm antimony, 42.2 ppm bismuth and 1677 ppm lead. Several areas are anomalous in gold only, while elsewhere there are strongly coincident Ag, As, Sb, Bi and Pb anomalies. Anomalous copper and molybdenum in the Mount Hart area, combined with observed porphyry-style hydrothermal alteration, indicate the potential for buried porphyry Cu-Mo-Au mineralization. The majority of anomalous soil samples are underlain by rocks of the Late Cretaceous Carmacks Group and coeval intrusions of the Late Cretaceous Prospector Mountain Suite which underly the west-central portion of the Mount Hart soil grid, suggesting a link to a Late Cretaceous mineralizing event.

The Mount Hart target is located in the southern part of the Nolan property approximately 50 km west of Dawson City and 15 km east of the Alaska border.

**Guilder Target, Loonie Property**

The Guilder target (Figure 7) hosts a copper-gold soil anomaly that measures approximately 3.5 km long NW-SE with an arcuate shaped soil geochemical trend which extends to the SE towards the Lucky Joe copper prospect (not held by White Gold). The target is located in the north-central region of the Loonie property, approximately 50 km south of Dawson City. The soil geochemistry displays a copper-gold-lead-zinc metal zonation. The northwesternmost portion of the soil anomaly displays a gold primary anomaly, which gradually transitions to copper primary to the southeast towards Lucky Joe. Lead and zinc appear to form a halo surrounding the copper ‚Äúcore‚Äù of the target.

Prospecting on the Guilder target has uncovered malachite and chalcocite, hosted by quartz-feldspar-biotite schist, near an outcrop of augen gneiss. Samples from this showing returned 1114.8 ppm Cu and 6.1 g/t Ag.

**QA/QC**

Analytical work for the 2023 RAB and diamond drill programs was performed by Bureau Veritas Commodities Canada Ltd., an internationally recognized analytical services provider, at its Vancouver, British Columbia laboratory. Sample preparation was carried out at its Whitehorse, Yukon facility. Samples were prepared using the PRP70-250 package, where samples were weighed, dried, and crushed to greater than 70% passing a 2mm sieve, then pulverized to greater than 85% passing 75 microns.¬† Samples were then analyzed in accordance with BV‚Äôs FA430 and MA250 packages, for both gold analysis by fire assay (30g fire assay with AAS finish) and ultra-trace multi-element ICP analysis (0.25 g, 4 acid digestion and ICP-MS analysis).

Well Ms A may I take a moment to simply explain why I left my client relationship with you ? 

It‚Äôs because you rejected my request to be friends outside of the treatment room.

Let me also write that I really appreciated the treatments and the space you provided to forget all of my responsibilities and it was restorative to me.

Do I miss you? Yes, do I have good feelings about and towards you? Yes.

Why did I do all those things? Simply expressing my thankfulness to you. This is part of my nature and something that I have done all my adult life.  If you look up my ascending sign you‚Äôd see it‚Äôs part of my nature to a fault I might add. 

I sensed that you are just as giving but often did not receive either because you are not comfortable with receiving (my problem) or people don‚Äôt notice and simply take from you. Not my style.  

So why did I leave? Well I am a bit sensitive and it took a lot of strength to ask you to have coffee and spend time with me though I knew it would not be a lot of time. 

Once I asked you I was exposing a bit of my heart and the dynamics between us would be different and I would be uncomfortable in a treatment scenario.

But if you‚Äôre willing to meet and have coffee and conversation I‚Äôm more than willing. 

You‚Äôve been on my mind continuously since September this year.  In fact every morning and evening.

I have not blocked you anywhere and I‚Äôm still on LinkedIn and I think you still have my business card. 

But if not I continue to wish you all the best, like I said before you are the only person that I experienced energy with, I will send you a few colours right now that I‚Äôve sent before.  

About 8:30 am in Tuesday the 3rd of December only 25 days away from when you sent me that text. 

All the best to my unexpected twin flame !

However, something has recently been bothering me, and I‚Äôm feeling torn and unsure of what to do. I‚Äôve noticed something off with my new colleague, who joined the team a couple of months ago. She‚Äôs always been friendly but a little reserved, which didn‚Äôt seem unusual at first. Over the past few weeks, though, I‚Äôve noticed some serious changes in her behavior that make me uncomfortable, and I‚Äôm worried something is seriously wrong.

To give some context, our boss, let‚Äôs call him *Dan*, is a senior manager, and while he‚Äôs generally seen as competent in his work, there‚Äôs always been a vibe among the team that he can be a bit‚Ä¶ overbearing at times. He‚Äôs made comments in the past that seemed flirtatious, but nothing that ever crossed a serious line, at least in front of everyone. He‚Äôs always been a little too ""buddy-buddy"" with some of the younger female employees, though I never thought much of it until now.

My new colleague, *Emma*, seems to be avoiding him a lot more lately, which stood out to me. She‚Äôs always been polite, but she‚Äôs become noticeably withdrawn whenever he‚Äôs around. I‚Äôve caught her avoiding his gaze in meetings, and she looks visibly uncomfortable when he‚Äôs close by. A few times, I‚Äôve even seen her flinch when he brushed up against her in passing. I initially thought maybe I was overthinking it, but it kept bothering me.

One afternoon, I overheard a conversation between Emma and Dan when I was in the break room. I couldn‚Äôt hear everything, but it sounded like she was protesting something, and he was pressuring her to do something, though I couldn‚Äôt make out the exact words. She sounded uncomfortable, almost pleading, and he was speaking in a way that felt manipulative. I can‚Äôt explain it, but something about the tone of his voice and her response gave me a really bad feeling. I had to step out before I could hear more, but I don‚Äôt think she noticed me.

Since then, I‚Äôve noticed her acting more withdrawn and jumpy around him. She‚Äôs also stopped participating in team lunches and seems to be isolating herself more. On top of that, she‚Äôs started coming in later and leaving earlier than usual. I tried talking to her once, just asking if everything was okay, but she brushed it off with a weak smile, saying she was just tired. She didn‚Äôt make eye contact the whole time, and her hands were shaking when she picked up her coffee. It was the first time I‚Äôve seen her like that, and it made me even more suspicious.

There was one specific incident last week that really made me question everything. Emma and I were walking back to the office from a lunch break, and we crossed paths with Dan. He was standing outside with another colleague, but as soon as Emma and I walked by, he turned and called out to her. At first, I thought he was just asking about something work-related, but the way he grabbed her arm to stop her made me feel uneasy. She looked uncomfortable, and for a brief moment, I saw her glance at me, almost silently asking for help. I could tell she was trying to pull away, but he was holding her arm too tightly. It felt like a moment where I should‚Äôve stepped in, but I froze. He eventually let go, and she quickly walked away, but the look on her face was something I couldn‚Äôt shake. I didn‚Äôt say anything to her right then because I didn‚Äôt want to make it worse, but later that day, I just couldn‚Äôt get the image of her face out of my mind.

I really want to help, but I have no idea how to approach this situation without making it worse for her. I‚Äôm terrified of making things worse for Emma, especially if I‚Äôm wrong. I‚Äôm also scared about the possible consequences for my own career if I report this and nothing comes of it. Our boss is well-liked by upper management, and I‚Äôve heard rumors that he‚Äôs pretty close with HR too. I don‚Äôt want to be accused of making false accusations or putting Emma in a position where she feels like I‚Äôm betraying her trust.

I also don‚Äôt know if Emma would even want me to speak up. I can‚Äôt imagine what she‚Äôs going through, and I‚Äôm sure she doesn‚Äôt want attention brought to it. But I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that she‚Äôs in danger, and I don‚Äôt want to stand by and do nothing. Should I try talking to her again and see if she opens up? Or should I report my suspicions to HR, even if I‚Äôm not 100% sure of anything? I‚Äôm just so worried about her and what might happen if I don‚Äôt do something. Please help me figure out what I should do.",1,1733232749.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
1h5nghc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h5nghc,Aeropress Premium review + metal filter comparison,"
I recently upgraded to the AeroPress Premium and wanted to share my experience, along with a comparison of two metal filters vs. the standard paper filter. I purchased the Premium model because I‚Äôm trying to cut down on plastic exposure in my food and drinks‚Äîespecially when hot liquids are involved‚Äîand the stainless steel build of this version was appealing. Overall, the build quality and feel are great, but there are some key trade-offs.

Issues with the AeroPress Premium:

	1.	Inversion Method Limitations
The Premium model is too heavy for the inversion method‚Äîit literally slides down under its own weight. This is a big drawback for fans of the inverted brew method, which often delivers a fuller extraction.
	2.	Drippage Problems
When brewing upright, there‚Äôs a noticeable issue with drippage. I tested two metal filters (DailyBrew and Altura Mesh) against the standard paper filter, and all three resulted in about the same amount of drippage (see photos for comparison). This makes controlling the steep time a bit tricky unless you‚Äôre using an attachment like the Fellow Prismo.
	3.	Prismo Attachment: A Mixed Bag
Speaking of the Prismo, it produces the best coffee in my setup by far, thanks to its pressure-actuated valve. However, the Prismo itself is made of plastic. While it‚Äôs a great tool, I‚Äôm hesitant to use it frequently due to concerns about plastic quality when exposed to hot liquids.

Metal Filters vs. Paper Filter:

	‚Ä¢	The metal filters (DailyBrew and Altura Mesh) performed well, but didn‚Äôt provide any significant improvement in drippage compared to paper. They do eliminate paper waste, which is a win for sustainability. Taste-wise, I noticed slightly more oils and body in the brew with the metal filters, but the difference wasn‚Äôt dramatic enough to sway me from one to the other.
	‚Ä¢	The paper filter remains the go-to for cleaner brews but contributes to drippage just as much as the metal filters in this specific setup.

My Dilemma:

Right now, there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a good solution to the drippage issue without resorting to the Prismo attachment. While I love the Premium AeroPress‚Äôs build, the lack of a workaround for drippage (without relying on plastic) feels like a major limitation.

Open Questions:

Has anyone found a plastic-free solution to minimize drippage with the AeroPress Premium? Or a way to make the inversion method work with its added weight? I‚Äôd love to hear your tips or hacks for optimizing this setup!

1h5ng9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1h5ng9h/coffee_shops_should_stop_pretending_theyre_fancy/,Coffee shops should stop pretending they‚Äôre fancy,"I‚Äôm tired of coffee shops acting like they‚Äôre high-end restaurants. You walk in, and it‚Äôs all about the ""artisanal"" this and ""craft"" that. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs just coffee.

I'm working on an interest project - a website that lets you know what beans cafes near you are currently brewing.

I got this idea while solo travelling when I was looking for cafes. However, it was difficult to distinguish between ""food cafes"" and ""cafes specialising in coffee"".

On this platform, baristas can simply update the available beans they are currently brewing. Users could view baristas who are happy to share and want people to try their beans. I think this would help filter out cafes and baristas who really care about their coffee beans! It would also help users discover interesting coffee beans they can try around them.

Looking for some initial feedback. I'm happy to hear your thoughts!",1,1733232443.0,JamesHoffmann,1,1.0,False

Hey fellow creative souls! Let‚Äôs sit down and deep-dive into that exciting, messy, sometimes-tear-soaked, yet totally magical thing we all love‚Äî*songwriting.* üé∂ Seriously, what is it about pulling words and melodies out of thin air that feels so‚Ä¶ electric? That connection between inspiration and creation? Whew, it‚Äôs special, right? And whether you‚Äôre scribbling in your notebook at 3AM, humming into your voice memos, or trying out your 18th chord progression in the middle of your kitchen for no reason at all‚Äîthere‚Äôs just something *so human* about it.  

But here‚Äôs the real question of the day: **what makes YOUR songwriting voice stand out?**  

We all know the technical stuff matters‚Äîstructure, rhyme schemes, chord changes‚Äîbut let‚Äôs be real. At its core, songwriting = YOU. Your quirks. Your weird metaphors. All the raw, unspoken things you‚Äôve felt but never said out loud. That‚Äôs the good stuff. And every songwriter has that *thing* that sets them apart. Sometimes we lean into it, and other times we spend **way too long** chasing someone else's sound instead of finding our own lane (been there, no shame üòÖ).  

So, how do you dig up those hidden pieces that scream *you* as a songwriter?

- **Pay Attention to Your Gut:** Got that gut feeling that a lyric or a melody just ‚Äúfits‚Äù? Trust it. That‚Äôs your subconscious reminding you that you‚Äôve got something. Sure, not every idea will be gold, but the way you feel about certain lines or parts? THAT is part of your fingerprint as a writer.  

- **Write What Scares You:** If it makes you nervous to write/sing it, you‚Äôre probably onto something. Vulnerability is a freaking superpower in songwriting, and the songs that hit us hardest are often the ones with the most honesty. Don‚Äôt be afraid to get uncomfortably real. (Crying while writing = emotional growth or something, right? üòÇ)  

- **Draw From YOUR Weird:** What‚Äôs specifically *you*? An inside joke? A niche hobby? A tattoo you regret? Add the odd details of your life that no one else can. It makes your work stand out way more than trying to sound ‚Äúperfect.‚Äù Perfect is overrated. Be *you.*  

Side note‚Äîhave you ever stopped to think how wild it is that songwriting can turn our most random life moments (the good, the ugly, and the awkward) into something meaningful? Like, suddenly, that time you tripped over a curb holding a coffee becomes the metaphor in a ballad about heartbreak. Pure alchemy, my friends. ‚òïüíî  

And okay, let‚Äôs talk melodies for a sec. üó£Ô∏è Do you ever feel like you‚Äôre just cycling through clich√©s? Here‚Äôs a handy trick: HUM EVERYTHING. Yep, before picking up your guitar or sitting down at your piano, just hum the first thing that comes to mind with zero expectations. The loopy, weird melodies that come out are often your freshest ideas. It feels silly, but you might get something you‚Äôd never find if you overthink it while gripping that G chord.  

A few bonus thoughts for the road:  

- **Steal Like A Magpie:** Not *literally,* of course. (Plz don‚Äôt go stealing entire choruses‚Äîwe don‚Äôt have the budget for lawyers here. üòÇ) What I mean is, steal inspiration shamelessly. Hear a rhythm you like? Borrow the feel, twist it up. Stumble across a cool phrase? Flip it on its head. It‚Äôs a creative remix, baby!  

- **Write Like No One‚Äôs Gonna Hear It:** Sometimes the pressure to ‚Äúwrite a great song‚Äù stops us before we even start. If you take out the end-goal of *having* to share it with the world, you gain freedom. Write for the pure joy of creating something weird, messy, and completely yours. You can polish it later‚Äîjust start.  

- **Music is Failure-Friendly.** Honestly, some songs won‚Äôt work, and that‚Äôs fine. Every wonky rhyme, off-key demo, or abandoned verse is just you sharpening your craft. Every ‚Äúbad‚Äù song is you leveling up for the next one.  

So, friends, spill the tea in the comments! What‚Äôs been your biggest ""ah-ha!"" moment when writing a song? Got any go-to techniques for breaking through writer‚Äôs block? Let‚Äôs swap tips and lift each other up.  

TL;DR: Write the messy stuff. Sing the weird stuff. Trust your gut and OWN what makes you unique. That‚Äôs where the magic lives. Go forth and create some bangers‚ÄîI‚Äôm rooting",1,1733232084.0,Songstuff,0,1.0,False

I had a very strange experience at the dealer last week when I went for my software update. The upgrade failed because the USB port didn't work, and the technician noted that the reason was - get this - ""found signs of spilled liquid on the passenger floor"". The advisor stated that this is the second one they've seen where it looks like coffee or the like spilled and corrupted the USB port that and possibly the harness under the center console. I stated this makes no sense whatsoever - how would a vehicle marketed as an off-roader with a completely rubber interior put a hidden USB port under the console, on the floor?? Regardless, the solution is to replace the part for $1500 which is at fault of the customer, of course, to which I said I'm stumped, and I'll get back to them (had to run out for the Thanksgiving travel, so couldn't spend much time debating).

When I saw the technician entry in the ticket, it stated USB in the console, not the floor. The thing is the USB console *never* worked from day 1. I put it on the list along with the rear door and super cruise to fix when I take the truck in, but honestly, I completely forgot about it since I never used it with the wireless charging and CarPlay. Has anyone else had this? Is there a possible fuse out or some buried setting in the menu that disables it? Thanks in advance!

""In the flickering neon glow of the Starlight Motel, two souls orbit each other like celestial bodies caught in an inevitable dance. Eri Nakahara, the motel's fierce guardian, rules her domain with iron-clad rules and a carefully constructed wall around her heart. At five feet tall, she commands respect through sheer force of will, her grey eyes holding stories she's never told. When Alexandros Paraskevopoulou arrives at her door, forced from his home by flooding, neither expects the gravitational pull that follows.

Xandros, as he's known to few, carries his own carefully crafted armor - a prestigious law career, an imposing presence at 6'2"", and an eyepatch that marks him as someone who's survived his own battles. His temporary residence at the Starlight sets in motion an intricate dance of avoidance and attraction, as two people accustomed to maintaining control find their carefully constructed worlds beginning to overlap.

Between the motel's book-lined lobby and the Night Owl Caf√©'s quiet booths, their story unfolds in shared insomnia and reluctant understanding. Their initial friction - her blunt aggression meeting his measured sarcasm - masks a deeper recognition: the familiar shadows they see reflected in each other's eyes.

As seasons change and coffee cups empty, their orbits draw closer. But when a sophisticated predator sets his sights on Eri's carefully built sanctuary, and ghosts from Xandros's past emerge to haunt his present, they must decide if the walls they've built are keeping pain out - or keeping life at bay.

In this atmospheric tale of slow-burning romance and psychological tension, love blooms in the spaces between midnight conversations and morning light, proving that sometimes the heart's greatest battle is learning to surrender to its own truth.""",1,1733231910.0,WritersGroup,0,1.0,False

I've gotten the casabrews 20 bar espresso machine as a christmas present, and am aware it's a cheap machine that probably has many faults. However I've read many reviews that said it is possible to brew a good espresso, given you mod it a bit, so that's what I did. 

I have a bottomless portafilter with an IMS basket, fresh beans from LOT61 in Amsterdam, Kingrinder K6, I weigh my coffee with a 0.1g scale, WDT, tamp, preheat my portafilter before brewing and still manage to get very inconsistent results, mainly because of the machine's heating function.

This machine will flash 1 cup and 2 cup if you try to press either, because of it being overheated, mind you, before having brewed anything at all or even touching the steam wand. I let out steam because of this and then it lets me preheat the portafilter. After that it will make a fuss again where I let out steam for 8 seconds again. Then I can start brewing.

With the first cup all goes well, but after a 3rd cup, suddenly a LOT of steam comes out the shower screen through the portafilter and essentially brew purely boiling hot crema, making the brew also way faster. I still let out steam before every cup because the machine doesn't even let me use it if I don't, but somehow it still brews while its obviously at steaming temperature.

Now my question: does anybody has this machine and figured out a workflow that gets consistent coffee? How do I get it to not overheat this bad? A new espresso machine is just not on the budget rn as I'm a broke university student, AND it was a present so I'd love to be able to perfect my workflow on this thing.

I used to walk to my local supermarket that had everything in it. Knowing they had a Ikea loading dock I'd always walk in this way and if I saw someone who needed help I'd come up and help them. They'd usually thank me followed up with a ""Who do I tell to give you a raise?"" or something similar, offer me money. I told them no. I didn't want it. I didn't work there, but I liked helping people out because I worked in similar joints. Plus they were notorious for either being too busy or not providing good help. So you'd get stuck there for like 30+ minutes and even when help came they couldn't/didn't know how to help you

The daughter says ""You don't look strong enough to help anyone... We're fine, another employee will help us"" and I was pretty taken back by this remark. I mean I had always been judged for my size/skinniness, but decided fuck them, I tried and now I'm moving on. At almost the same time the employee they were asking for came over. I had at least 20kgs/50lbs on him. She turned back to me and said ""Wait, can you help him?"" and I said ""Fuck off, I only offered as a favour. Get him to do it. I don't work here""

He ended up damaging something on their car because I wanted to see how it would play out. I just laughed the most exaggerated laugh I could do and walked away

Has not always been the same scenario with this location though! I did encounter another mother/daughter trying to tie down/secure something to a ute they hired to pick something up. Ikea refused. I told them ""I can do it, but you won't be able to bill Ikea if something goes wrong. I am sure of my knots though"" and they said that's fine. I strapped everything in. gave it the ol' driver shakearoo and showed them how to undo the knots easily. The grandmother gave me $10 and told me to get a cake a coffee on her. I declined but she wouldn't take no for an answer. I thanked her profusely and got myself a cake and coffee. I never eat cake, but I'd have felt so bad accepting her money and not doing so. I have helped many people in my time and they were some of the nicest I ever met. A little bit of kindness goes a long way people.

Once again, having diplomatic access paid off. Alex had never left a station so quickly before, with the exception of the launching of the *Kshlav‚Äôo*. The Scoutship program had dedicated hangar bays and approach lanes, and a ship coming or going was planned days in advance so there was no overlap.

The GX8 still handled like a dream, and Alex took third position in the convoy of Tsla‚Äôo ships back to the *Sword of the Morning Light*, setting it up to follow the ship in front of him just like on the trip there. 

Alex made note of the time and shut off the ARGUS. Having to think about what he was saying in front of both the ONI and Imperial Intelligence was tiring. Then he went to do a little eavesdropping of his own. 

Sliding the pilot‚Äôs chair back, he slipped on the remote hud and crept silently as possible back to the stairs, crouching down to peer into the main cabin. The two royal guard were in the first row again, the dichotomy between alien armor and plush white leather chairs still weird. He gave them a little nod. They nodded back. That felt pretty good. Actual recognition.

Carbon and Eleya were all the way back on the right. Carbon had turned her seat around so they were facing each other. He had heard them talking while they stood in the entryway to the ship, but now a good ten meters away he couldn‚Äôt hear anything they were saying, just the sound of voices. At least it sounded copacetic. A little tense, which was about as good as he could imagine if they were having the conversation he was expecting to hear about later. 

Alex parked himself sideways in the navigator‚Äôs station, leaning against the armrest and tapping his feet in the aisle. It was their conversation, one he had been very particular not to put himself into so far despite Eleya's attempt at getting him to spill some details for her. While he was interested in what exactly Eleya was saying, he was relieved that it seemed to be going well enough that there had been no shouting, or attempted murder.

He suspected that a discussion of that magnitude would take more than the entire flight back. Man. This was going to be worse than listening to Eleya sip a drink at the bottom of the cabin stairs because he wouldn‚Äôt let her bring an alcoholic beverage onto the flight deck. 

Eleya had understood *why* he had stopped her from bringing it up, and even approved of his steadfast insistence that it remain in the cabin. The Tsla‚Äôo had similar rules about intoxicants and operating vehicles. It did not make her stop drinking as passive-aggressively as she could to be annoying.

He wished he had brought something to drink up here, though. Alex was sure that even creeping down to the head to get some water would be a distraction. He looked back at the cabin, the plush cream carpet at the bottom of actual wood stairs standing in sharp contrast to the utilitarian gray floor plating in the flight deck. Wait. The GX8 was originally a luxe shuttle, the intrasolar equivalent of a private jet. This area wasn‚Äôt necessarily meant to be seen by the passengers. There was even a sliding door to close so you could be sure that those passengers wouldn‚Äôt have to bear witness to *employees*.

One of the down sides to having nearly all of your experience with a ship being in a simulator is that you traditionally start off in the pilot‚Äôs seat. There‚Äôs no interacting with the rest of the ship, save for glancing back at the CPU navigator. Alex‚Äôs preferred GX8 variant in a sim were stripped racing models, usually with the Italia livery. He only knew where things were because he‚Äôd seen videos of the interior *without* all the luxury bits taken out, before a crew came in and stripped out every unnecessary gram of weight. Which included a whole bunch of what he had thought were just computer racks that took up the left side of the flight deck, across from the navigator‚Äôs station.

If they were going to put a pilot and navigator up here for eight or twelve hours at a time...

The two furthest back were obviously server racks. Rows of blinking lights and little displays telling anyone who would read it what was going on. Even navigation systems that didn‚Äôt handle FLT were not exactly compact, and these were fully loaded from floor to ceiling. The three remaining were just lightly decorated pressed metal to carry the motif of server racks. He popped the first one open, pressing the door inward to unlatch it. Coat closet and luggage storage. Ok. fair. These were not turnaround trips. 

The middle one hid a kitchenette. Score. A little fridge, a sink, recycler, and a microwave. The forward-most locker was mostly emergency gear, but two shelves were stocked with snacks and prepack meals, and a third with some cups and dishes. Now wasn‚Äôt the time for snacking, he was still very much full from dinner, but if there was something good in the fridge...

It too was fully stocked, though not as extravagantly as the wet bar. A few of the usual sodas, juice, water - both still and sparkling because people on the flight deck are very fancy apparently - and the thing he reached for almost instinctively when he spotted it: a can of Vietnamese coffee.

The next question was how was this supposed to be eaten. There was no extra room up here and holding a packet of food over the controls of your expensive ship was not generally approved behavior. Alex looked over the Navigator‚Äôs seat, as it was convenient. Sure enough, there was a tray table in the arm rest and a button to make the chair rotate ninety degrees so none of the console was directly in front of where you would set food and drink. 

He hopped back up into it and cracked open the coffee, then scanned the hud on the eyes he was wearing. They were still accelerating, forty minutes until they would have to turn it and start the deceleration cycle.

While Alex was very enamored with the ship, the reality of using it to scoot around the system was starting to set in. There was a lot of down time and he had not prepared for that, though there was little to be done in this case. Carbon or Eleya sitting around up here would have been more than enough company. Next time he‚Äôd have to make sure Neya came with, or snag somebody from his security team. Zenshen and Amalu would probably be cool with it, but for the rest of them it would literally be their boss telling them to hang out.

He sighed, the worst case scenario having arrived. Alex pulled out his phone and started playing games.

Two hours and three cans of Vietnamese coffee later, they were once again aboard the *Sword of the Morning Light* and parked back where the GX8 had started earlier that day. Eleya and Carbon were still talking. They had nearly thirty years of trouble to walk through, so condensing it down into just a two hour flight was unlikely. Condensing it down into a single conversation was unlikely.

The Royal Guard were just standing there at the stairs to the hatch when he finally departed the flight deck, the ship fully shut down save for auxiliary power. This was probably not a very common occurrence. Alex continued down the short, luxuriously appointed cabin.

They stopped talking as he approached. ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm sure you guys noticed, we‚Äôre back. I don‚Äôt know if you want to move this conversation somewhere else, or would prefer to keep it going here.‚Äù This was no doubt a fantastically important conversation. The incident and the fallout from it had been eating at both of them for decades, so now that it was happening, he would do what he could to facilitate that forward momentum.

The two of them looked up at him, surprised. No, they looked up at him drunk. They both had lowball glasses and that bottle of whiskey Eleya had opened earlier was resting next to hip in her seat, now past half empty.

Carbon looked at him and then to Eleya. ‚ÄúWe have arrived?‚Äù Now she was surprised, turning to look out the little window a little too fast and swaying in her chair. ‚ÄúOh.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo it is.‚Äù Eleya was pleased, a sublime sort of smile on her face. She looked more relaxed than Alex had ever seen her. ‚ÄúI had not even noticed the landing, so talented is the young pilot.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo it is.‚Äù Carbon echoed her aunt before turning back to Alex, bright blue eyes focusing on him after a moment. Her ears and antenna raised before she spoke, working fairly hard to keep that focus from straying. ‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you guys want to continue this conversation elsewhere now that we‚Äôre home? You don‚Äôt have to stay on the ship.‚Äù The amount of concentration she was putting into that was kind of cute. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs up to you, I get the impression it was fairly important.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is, yes. Long overdue.‚Äù Carbon nodded, staring hard to keep eye contact with him as she spoke and switching back into English. ‚ÄúI feel it may be a good idea to continue it tonight? It is not very late yet.‚Äù

She was right, it was only a little after eight. Several hours left in the evening before they normally went to bed. ‚ÄúYou up for that, Empress?‚Äù

Eleya perked up immediately. ‚ÄúOh, I am! There is still much left to discuss.‚Äù

Alex was momentarily taken aback by the raw enthusiasm in her voice. Eleya was in fact ready to get this done. ‚ÄúAll right. Where are we going? Or, I suppose, where are you going?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou pick your words carefully, young Prince.‚Äù Eleya approved of that, whatever exactly she meant by it. ‚ÄúThis is a matter between the Princess and I. We will retire to my quarters. If that is acceptable to you, Carbon?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. My husband, she is correct. These are words between us that do not have the same weight to you.‚Äù Carbon held up a hand. ‚ÄúI know you would accom- acc... follow me anywhere, and I am grateful, but this is a matter that only she can solve.‚Äù

It was nice to have his drunk wife appreciate him. ‚ÄúAlright. Keep me in the loop about how things are going, ok?‚Äù The idea of letting her go anywhere with Eleya alone, particularly when they both had been drinking, did make him uneasy. If the Empress had not exhibited a consistent change in behavior - she hadn‚Äôt been shitty to Carbon recently, and their sober meetings to decide what to do about Sharadi had been good for Carbon. 

For now, he trusted that Eleya wanted her family back more than anything.

‚ÄúBy your sight.‚Äù Carbon smirked and stood, steading herself on him before wrapping her arms around his waist and pulling him into a hug. She nestled down against his chest for a moment, humming happily before stretching up for a kiss. Wasn‚Äôt a quick smooch, either. No, Carbon lingered on it before breaking away, looking utterly smitten as she held onto him before letting her hold on him slip as she headed for the exit. Yep, she had been drinking whiskey. 

All right, it was nice to have his drunk wife being affectionate too. Maybe a kind of weird place as it was right in front of her aunt and the Guards, but he wasn‚Äôt going to bring that up. 

‚ÄúWe shall take our leave and depart your *burner*, Alex. I will be sure that she does not stay out too late.‚Äù Eleya had less trouble getting up, the bottle of 18 year single-malt whiskey tucked under her arm like she was used to absconding with other people‚Äôs booze.

‚ÄúUh-uh. Gimme.‚Äù He pointed out the alcohol and held out a hand. ‚ÄúThat came from the ship‚Äôs bar, so it stays. I‚Äôve seen your liquor cabinet, don‚Äôt pretend like it‚Äôs running dry.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are no fun.‚Äù She huffed as she set the bottle in his hand. Eleya was amused by this, though, stopping beside him and tilting her head to look up with a sidelong glance. ‚ÄúBut you are an admirable husband, Prince.‚Äù

She shoulder checked him as she continued down the aisle, her and Carbon departing with the Royal Guard. Alex suspected that was about the highest praise she would impart upon someone at a personal level.

He returned the whiskey to the wet bar and searched through it for something he was a little more interested in. A familiar looking bottle he had spotted on the bottom rack earlier, frosted black glass with a subtle black and red label. Demerara rum from Guyana, 27 year oak cask aged. A popular one around the Scoutship program. He tucked it under his arm, shut the aux power off and sealed the hatch.

It was *his* ship. He could bend the rules on it.

Alex had gotten the hang of the *Sword* and could reliably get himself around now. Hardly took a half hour to get back to the cabin, since he preferred taking the regular transit. Didn‚Äôt get as many weird looks as he was expecting.

‚ÄúHey, how goes?‚Äù Not having to hang up a jacket really sped up the process of coming home, particularly given how small the Tsla‚Äôo made the fasteners on those things. 

Neya was stretched out on the bed, about three quarters naked, sitting up on a pile of pillows and reading. ‚ÄúI have done nothing of note all evening, it was delightful.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood.‚Äù He started rummaging through the kitchen drawers for a bottle opener. They had one somewhere, he‚Äôd seen Carbon and Neya open wine with it before.

She just now looked up from her book. ‚ÄúWhere is Carbon?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe...‚Äù There it was. Last drawer, of course. He grabbed a pair of glasses and returned to the table. Alex looked straight at her as he started to peel the dipped wax seal off the bottle. ‚ÄúIs talking to Eleya.‚Äù

The silence coming from Neya was so profound Alex could hear her blinking in alarm. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey are having a *conversation*. I have not been privy to it, but it seems to be about the last few decades.‚Äù Alex gestured widely at everything, and then set about getting the cork out. Took forever to wind the corkscrew in, and it was not interested in coming along easily. 

‚ÄúIs that... How does she fare?‚Äù More than a trace of anxiety was clear in Neya as the pale-furred Tsla‚Äôo scooted off the bed, her book abandoned among the pillows. She was wearing just the *daman* right now, almost as revealing as a two-piece swimsuit, and she stood across the kitchen table from him. ‚ÄúIs it safe to leave them alone together?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think it is. I really do.‚Äù The cork finally came out with a subdued pop and Alex poured himself a tot - an eighth of a pint. It was not known who in the Scout program decided to go full British Navy when it came to drinking, but Rum and archaic measurements were already entrenched when he got there, including the ridiculous little metal cups. He held the bottle up. ‚ÄúYou want?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou really think it safe to leave them alone?‚Äù She asked, confused about that as she leaned over to smell it. ‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs rum. Fermented, distilled sugarcane molasses.‚Äù Alex did not look down her *daman* as hard as he could. He knew Carbon would have told him, again, that it was fine if he did because Neya is very particular about what she wears around them so anything he saw was never going to be an accident. Old habits die hard. ‚ÄúAnd I do. You know better than I how much Eleya has changed lately. I think she‚Äôs finally turned a corner, and I think dinner tonight accelerated that change a lot.‚Äù

Neya pondered that as she sniffed the bottle again. ‚ÄúI will try it if you explain what you mean.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAlright. So Carbon had a girl‚Äôs day with my mom, right?‚Äù He poured her a tot as well and slid the glass over.

‚ÄúYes, I was here for that being planned.‚Äù She picked it up and sniffed the glass, violet eyes glancing into it with surprise before taking a sip. ‚ÄúWith the word sugar in the name, I expected it to be much sweeter.‚Äù

‚ÄúFermentation turns the sugar to alcohol.‚Äù Alex hadn‚Äôt been into rum at first, but had come around to the idea that turning molasses into rum was the only good use for molasses. ‚ÄúSo that went well. It looks like they had a great time. At dinner, Eleya had a front row seat to my mom treating Carbon like she was family. And it hurt her. She didn‚Äôt react much, but I saw it in her eyes a few times. A little surprised to be saying this, but I respect that she channeled that pain into productive action.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wish it were not surprising. I have known Eleya as little more than a source of dread for Carbon for the last decade. I am pleased that she is making these strides.‚Äù Neya tasted the rum again, pondering it before taking a larger drink. ‚ÄúI wish I did not have a reason to be happy about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, same. At least she‚Äôs getting her shit together. She asked for permission to fly back with us, and they talked the whole way over - two hours! Never raised a voice. Not a punch thrown.‚Äù He chuckled and put a little water in his. Not enough to make grog, just open up the spirit a little bit. ‚ÄúThey were actually having drinks by the time we got back. Eleya complimented me, and it wasn‚Äôt backhanded.‚Äù

‚ÄúI fear it may take me some time to get used to this.‚Äù She downed the rest of her rum and went to wash the glass. No more for her right now. ‚ÄúThank you for sharing that. It is interesting, may I try it again when I do not feel as though my world has tipped over?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know you don‚Äôt have to ask.‚Äù Alex was sure that there was a formality in the Zeshen system he didn‚Äôt know about, where the conceit that the second soul is the same as the first and can thus take their place broke down a bit. Neya would wear their clothing without a second thought, but anything else always seemed to require a polite request. For better or worse, Alex had found himself going all-in when it came to possessions. If it was his, it was also hers. Just don‚Äôt hog stuff.

The unease on her face every time he said that was just more confirmation. ‚ÄúI am aware.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you?‚Äù He dropped it after that. Finished his drink and set the glass on the counter before flopping down onto the bed. It did feel good to take a load off after a day that hadn‚Äôt been that busy, but had been stressful. He pulled a... A t-shirt from the pile of pillows that Neya had been laying on. One of his, of course. Operation Make Alex Smell Right was still in effect. He grabbed a pillow the second time around and stuffed it under his head.

Neya joined him, nestled up on the side Carbon preferred, draped her arm and leg over him like Carbon did. It had been uncomfortably weird to Alex the first time she had done that, the movements and positioning so close that if not for various physical differences, he wouldn‚Äôt have been able to tell them apart without looking.

It was still a little weird.

‚ÄúYou want to hear about what all we got up to, or wait for Carbon so you don‚Äôt have to hear a bunch of it twice?‚Äù He reached up and massaged her head around the base of her antenna.

‚ÄúWait for her.‚Äù She sighed and relaxed, the similarities starting to diverge. Neya tended to stay tense longer, even as she settled in. Carbon was already very comfortable with him. While Neya did a good job acting the part, it was clear she wasn‚Äôt quite at the same level yet. ‚ÄúDid she say how long she would be?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I figure they‚Äôll hash enough things out for a few more hours. Told her to keep me in the loop, and Eleya said that she wouldn‚Äôt keep her too late.‚Äù None of it was concrete, of course. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve got a lot to work through.‚Äù

‚ÄúI hope it is not long. I miss her, and knowing that she will be leaving for a few weeks makes me miss her more already.‚Äù Neya grumbled quietly, setting her chin on his shoulder. ‚ÄúI would like to go but I may have to represent her here.‚Äù

‚ÄúMight have to represent us both, actually. There‚Äôs enough time in the ramp up that I can go as well.‚Äù

Neya grumbled again. ‚ÄúIt is good that you will see Na‚Äôo and Schoen. Important. Good for Carbon as well, she will need your support when dealing with her father. Perhaps him meeting you will also be beneficial. To learn the truth of you when he cannot simply hide.‚Äù

Alex thought it sounded like she was listing reasons not to be mad. He almost said as much when the door chime rang, a tune that was far too jaunty for this time of night. ‚ÄúAh, what the hell?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll get it.‚Äù She pushed off the bed, plucking a pair of blue pants out of the drawers beneath it before Alex could tell her that he would go take care of it, since he was still fully dressed still. Neya had pulled the pants on and was close enough to fully dressed for the Tsla‚Äôo a moment later, tying the waist as she went to check who was visiting so long after dinner. 

Well. She‚Äôs got it. Alex almost went back to relaxing before his phone started ringing. Not his Human phone, which had no reception here, but his Tsla‚Äôo issued one. When it rains it pours. He fished it out of his pocket and hit answer just as his brain registered what the flowing Tsla script of the contact information said: Eleya. ‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYoung Prince. You must begin answering calls with more decorum.‚Äù Eleya still sounded happy.

*That* was still strange to hear, and unfortunate that it was strange. ‚ÄúAlright, I‚Äôll work on it. What‚Äôs up?‚Äù

‚ÄúSee that you do.‚Äù She hesitated, just for a moment. ‚ÄúYour dearest wife has fallen asleep. I loathe to admit it, but I do not know her well enough to determine if it would be better to let her sleep here, or wake her and send her home. I want... whatever would be best for her.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. Uh, probably send her home.‚Äù Hadn‚Äôt expected a question like that. ‚ÄúWait. Let her sleep, I‚Äôll come get her. That way she‚Äôs not wandering the ship alone while tipsy.‚Äù

She bristled at that. ‚ÄúI would send an escort with her.‚Äù

‚ÄúRoyal Guard? So she‚Äôd be walking home drunk with some invisible guys tailing her?‚Äù Sure, it was nice to have them, but they had been escorted by the Guard before so he knew what was going down.

‚ÄúI have guards who do not wear armor who would have assisted her.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right.‚Äù Alex doubted that, the part about guards without armor. He hadn‚Äôt seen them. He looked over at Neya as she returned from the foyer, carrying five, six... eight shopping bags. He recognized all the logos, and a couple of them were *full*. They had gone to every store on the station, and Carbon had clearly arranged some sort of currency exchange because she had purchased everything. ‚ÄúLook, we‚Äôll be there as soon as we can. Leaving right now.‚Äù

‚ÄúVery well, I will await you.‚Äù

Alex hung up. ‚ÄúI gotta go pick up Carbon, you want to come along?‚Äù

Neya heaved everything onto the kitchen table. ‚ÄúHas something happened?‚Äù She didn‚Äôt sound alarmed, but the way her tail stiffened behind her betrayed it.

‚ÄúNothing to worry about, she just fell asleep.‚Äù Should have led with that. He shook his head and got out of bed, peeking into the largest bag. Everything was wrapped in paper. There were stores that fancy on McFadden station? He had never gone off the main promenade and clothes weren‚Äôt really his thing, so maybe there are. He could snoop more after they got Carbon back. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to come with if you don‚Äôt want.

She didn‚Äôt even think about it. ‚ÄúLet me get my boots and I will.‚Äù Neya got fully dressed in the length of time it took Alex to pick out a jacket, casual boots laced up with practiced hands and a subdued vest thrown on over her *daman*. 

Alex regaled her with the boring minutia of his day on the way over, the things that he could talk about that didn‚Äôt have a security clearance or privacy concerns, at least. Narrowed it down a lot since he was still trying to avoid making her listen to the same stuff twice as well.

He started with the GX8. It was a pretty big deal to him, and the entire fucking Confederation knew he was scooting around in that thing now. Then Alex found out that Neya had known about the Masamune as well, which was fine. It was fine. Everyone had been in on that little conspiracy to hide the ship he had always wanted from him, ostensibly because it was a present and you‚Äôre not supposed to just tell the recipient what they‚Äôre getting.

That was cool, he was completely cool with it.

He mentioned the scuffle between Zenshen and Williams, and how it turned out to just be their secret handshake. And now he was out of things to talk about, so he brought up an item that he had come in halfway through - the fact there were a few hundred Tsla‚Äôo loose in Confederation space now. It was a surprise to Neya too, and she was of the mind that they ought to be brought back to the hearth, if they were willing.

Eleya was waiting for them, as she had said. Curiously, she was sitting in the antechamber, drink in hand, the doors to her quarters waiting open for their arrival. ‚ÄúAlex. When we parted ways I had not expected to see you again so soon.‚Äù She gave Neya a little bow as well. ‚ÄúNeya.‚Äù

‚ÄúEmpress.‚Äù She returned the formality. 

‚ÄúSo, she just nodded off?‚Äù Alex inquired, noting that his wife was not in the room with them.

‚ÄúShe did. I was making us another drink and when I turned around she was asleep. It seems she does not hold her alcohol as well as I do.‚Äù Eleya stood and gestured to her guard by the entry to her bedroom, the barely visible form opening the door. She tilted her head into the room. ‚ÄúThank you for coming. I feel we have made much progress today, so I am wary of anything that might walk it back.‚Äù

Oh, he should go first. Yeah, that makes sense. Right. ‚ÄúI can dig that.‚Äù It was dim inside, lit by the warm flickering light of the false hearth, which was also warming the room up significantly. Hell, it made him want to go to sleep. Carbon was sitting in one of those old wooden chairs, an empty glass before her on the table. Her ears were splayed out in different directions, head tilted back, mouth agape, and very much asleep. That couldn‚Äôt have been comfortable.

She was still wearing the dark blue jacket she had put on that morning. Alex crouched beside her and gave her shoulder a little shake. ‚ÄúHey, Carbon. It‚Äôs time to go home, all right?‚Äù

She stirred, visibly out of it when she sat up. Carbon smacked her lips and she licked her teeth, eyes bleary as she zeroed in on him. When she did speak, it was in mumbled Tsla. ‚ÄúOh, husband. Where is us?‚Äù

He did not laugh, not even the tiniest smirk graced his face. Just a warm, friendly smile. His self control was impeccable. ‚ÄúYou fell asleep at Eleya‚Äôs place, and now we‚Äôre going to go home. Sound good?‚Äù 

Carbon leaned over, wrapped her arms around his shoulders and leaned on him, fuzzy face pressed against his neck. She just hummed in agreement.

That... that wasn‚Äôt really an answer. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to have to get up, ok?‚Äù

She released him and pushed herself to her feet with a grumble, steadying herself with the heavy wooden chair. ‚ÄúYes. We will.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe sure will.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt know what she meant there, but stood up and moved to support her... Alex‚Äôs experience with drunk people was to put their arm over his shoulder, but with the height difference that was kind of impossible.

Carbon was not considering things in such depth, sliding an arm around his waist as she latched on to him, kissing him before resting her head on his shoulder in a surprisingly open display of affection. Blue eyes surveyed the room now that it wasn‚Äôt moving as much and locked on to Neya. Carbon gasped, the sound tiny and delighted. ‚ÄúOh, wife! I require a hug. It has been a good day, and I must tell you about it!‚Äù Her free arm reached out to Neya, beckoning her closer.

There was a moment of panic shared between Neya and Alex. She was standing behind Eleya, at the very least, so the Empress did not see her violet eyes grow wide, or her antenna life up in alarm. If Carbon had come to think of Neya like that, she hadn‚Äôt told either of them explicitly.

The Empress raised an eyebrow in his direction.

For his part, Alex kept himself composed. He furrowed his brow and looked down at Carbon, confused. ‚ÄúHoney, that‚Äôs Neya. Your Zeshen.‚Äù You know, the one you‚Äôre not supposed to be talking about having a very not-Zeshen relationship with?

‚Äú*Our* Zeshen.‚Äù She corrected him and continued to wave Neya over.

‚ÄúThat is correct. I am in service to both of you now, Alex.‚Äù She had recovered reasonably well, a very gentle verbal poke keeping up appearances as she came to give Carbon that hug she desired. 

The Princess shifted most of her weight into that embrace. Neya staggered back with a quiet cry of alarm as she fought to remain upright, Carbon squeezing her tight with no regard to their safety.

‚ÄúWhoa hey, let‚Äôs be careful with the hugs.‚Äù He wrapped an arm around Carbon and pulled her upright, his wife returning to leaning against him. Maybe he should have just let her sleep it off here, even if they needed to finish packing in the morning. 

‚ÄúVery well, dearest husband. I will give more to you.‚Äù She returned her arm to his waist, clinging to him again.

‚ÄúCarbon. Do you think you can actually walk home?‚Äù He asked, not sure if she could at this point. He looked up at Eleya. ‚ÄúDo you have any of that anti-intoxicant lying around? The stuff Kaleta got?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course I can.‚Äù Carbon insisted, still leaning heavily against him.

‚ÄúNo, it is a controlled substance so it is not used to cover up drug abuse or actual crimes.‚Äù Eleya shook her head. ‚ÄúBut it is trivial for me to have some brought around.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh.‚Äù Of course she could get some. Before he started asking people to inject his wife with drugs he assumed were safe but otherwise unknown to him, he would propose a quick test. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see how it goes. If we‚Äôre not under our own power by the time we‚Äôre at the hallway, we will reevaluate this idea.‚Äù

Eleya tipped her head at him and stepped aside, giving them a clear shot to the exit, maybe twenty meters away. ‚ÄúVery well.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right Carbon, let‚Äôs get going.‚Äù He patted her shoulder and gestured out of the Empress' quarters.

She was still pressed against him, but by the time they had reached the doorway it was clear Carbon was doing that because she wanted to, not because she needed the support. Her steps were confident enough, and her initial lack of coordination seemed to be tied to having just woken up drunk. Now that she was awake-drunk, it was good enough.

Eleya had followed them, keen eyes watching her niece‚Äôs progress. ‚ÄúCarbon. Before you go, I must thank you for this evening. I have treated you poorly for too long, for reasons that I do not know are truly forgivable. That you have offered me another chance is not a gift I take lightly, and I will prove your trust is not misplaced.‚Äù

Carbon regarded her for a long moment, nodding slowly. ‚ÄúBy your sight, it is on you to prove it good. I know you have the strength, the willpower. But before tonight I have never seen...‚Äù She paused, eyes searching as she tried to find the right word before she continued. ‚ÄúI have never seen humility in you. I hope you do. I- I look forward to it.‚Äù

Apologies for the delay, bit of a rough day in the Shogun household yesterday.

Before I say anything else, something incredible happened: a [meme was made](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F4j6ma7mdj63e1.jpeg) about this very story. Haha, it very much has been like that. Courtesy of u/Final_Ant5337. Very cool, thank you!

And yes, more art with Alex is in the works.

All right, all right, all right. Looks like Eleya is actually putting in the work and realizes she might not actually deserve it.

Hello everyone,

I'm new to this group and could use some help with my recent purchase. I love coffee and have a big passion for it, which is why I decided to buy this machine during a Black Friday sale. However, I must admit I have little to no knowledge about making a good cup of coffee.

I've been researching online and found some advice. What I've learned so far is to aim for around 18 grams of coffee and an extraction time of at least 25 seconds, depending on the beans. I've also read that the pressure gauge should ideally be at the 12 o'clock position.

The problem is that I only get roughly 12 seconds of extraction, and the pressure gauge goes up to just below halfway before dropping immediately. This leaves me wondering what I might be doing wrong.

I bought some inexpensive beans to experiment with while learning. I've tried grinding the coffee fine since I heard that helps with longer extraction due to more resistance, but I‚Äôm still struggling to get it right.

Could it be that the machine isn‚Äôt programmed properly, or am I just not doing it correctly? I would really appreciate some tips or advice to help me get started on making great coffee.

1h5mxgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1h5mxgp/feel_like_running_away_from_everything/,Feel like running away from everything,"I could really use some reassurance right now.

A life-threatening event was what caused my PTSD. I now dread going to work daily. I'm usually able to push through it, trying to hold my head held high. But today, I was a coward. I used my unexpected car issues this morning and the fact that I forgot essential things for work at home as an excuse to get out of work. I could have worked around those things, but I blew them up more than they really deserved. I drove around town and felt like I wanted to drive away somewhere and never look back. I want to be a different person, unrecognizable, and just stop everything in my current life in order to make a totally new one. Instead, I just hid in my car in a coffee shop parking lot. I went inside and ordered coffee, but accidentally spilled it all over the floor. The barista asked if I'm doing okay. How can I tell her I'm not? I just told her I was tired, hence the reason for the coffee. I can't tell her how much I want to scream and pull myself out of my skin. I want to float away. I am so dissociated that I am unaware of my surroundings. I crave comfort and companionship in this moment, but I also want to run away and be alone. What a paradox...

I've been getting help with a therapist and a psychiatrist for the past 4 months. It's been steadily improving, but it is just so hard to keep putting one foot in front of the other every day. I'm getting tired.",2,1733231069.0,ptsd,1,1.0,False

I started eating spaghetti with my family and I overate and threw up. The next day, I ate a salad earlier in the day and then I developed a headache and then took some oregano oil. the headache came back after me taking it but when I got started into eating dinner, which was really late, I threw up the first bite. During September, I had times where I had food sensitivities to non dairy product foods and it would give me body aches which were unpredictable, specifically ice cream and yogurt (Siggi Yogurt made my back and upper arms burn on and off one day and it lasted a bit throughout one night, Macadamia Coffee Ice Cream made me have a cold ache on my chest and Dark Chocolate Avocado Ice cream made my shoulder hurt for 40 minutes).

I've also had reactions to different foods such as ginger kombucha or any kombucha, Dates, red meat(it did give me a chest ache at first a few occasions but it stopped eventually). Eggs did give me reflux at first but they dont any more. My gut health has gotten better to an extent. All that I just hate is the constant silent reflux daily. I have been dealing with it for 3 1/2 months. Some foods I would eat would give me a mucus feeling in my throat and/or make me cough, even certain things that are plant based. I have also dealt with times of stress and anxiety. I've also had times where I would have sleepless nights. I did have times where I would cough during the night due to dry air so I do work on having my humidifer on as best I can. I am working making sure my environment is not dusty also, especially knowing that dust can contribute to coughing and reflux I think. I think like once a month I get relief from it but then it comes back.

I have been doing different things during the months such as aloe vera juice, collagen peptides, slippery elm, acid sooth(enzymedica), digestive enzymes(digest spectrum), gut assist, 3 in 1 probiotic, just to name a few. So I'm seeing a bit of progress but I still have a long way to go. I have went to a GI doctor about it, I havent gotten any testing for it. I'm just trying to manage it the best way I can and being watchful as I can as far as the trigger foods or at least keeping them to a minimum along with chewing my food thoroughly. I was told from a doctor that I was early in catching the reflux considering that I've been dealing with it for 3 months. I am planning to take more action and connecting with a dietician to help me get rid of majority of my reflux if not all of it once and for all.

So my question is, for anyone who has silent reflux for 3 or so months, what has been your experience and how are you coping with it? Any remedies you have tried?",1,1733230979.0,GERD,0,1.0,False
1h5mvg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1h5mvg3/bad_milk/,Bad Milk ,"Chris woke up to the blaring sound of his alarm and a splitting headache. He sat up in bed wincing, closing his eyes from the sunlight flooding into the room. Blindly he reached out toward his nightstand slapping around till his hand found the snooze button on his alarm. Squinting at the alarm clock, the red lights blinked 8:00 AM. He didn‚Äôt remember setting the alarm last night, and eight in the morning was too optimistic even not hungover. Pulling his blanket back over his head he laid down trying to go to sleep.

¬†

The darkness didn‚Äôt help; it only made him realize how badly he needed to go to pee. Stepping out of bed his foot crushed down on a beer that wrapped itself around his foot. He kicked with his foot trying to shake the can free. As the can shook it sprayed the leftover contents around the room. Chris used his hand to pry the can off his foot, dropping it back on the floor as he rushed to the bathroom. On the way to the bathroom, he didn't notice the spill the can had made as the rest of its contents soaked into the carpet.

¬†

Stepping into the bathroom he was hit by the stench of day-old vomit. The smell made him gag, almost adding to the pile he saw clogging his sink. Wearing a disgusted expression Chris wondered who had thrown up into his sink last night. Whoever it was would have to clean it up, because he wasn‚Äôt about to take on cleaning today. In fact, he wasn‚Äôt about to clean any other day either. No one had cleaned the bathroom in months. A glance around the bathroom would have revealed mold and mildew in every nook and cranny and a yellow bathmat that was once white.

¬†

While at a glance the bathroom looked dingy it became unquestionably hazardous when Chris opened the lid to the toilet. Looking down into the bowl the inside was covered in a brown fuzz resembling a sea anemone floating in the ocean. The disturbingly unkempt toilet might have made scientists question whether the four roommates had succeeded in creating a new lifeform. Spawned by a regiment of protein shakes and incubated in a toilet that hadn‚Äôt seen cleaning products in two years.

¬†

The sight didn‚Äôt faze Chris in fact he barely glanced down as he pulled his boxers down to pee that morning. Once he finished, he ran his hands under the cold water from the faucet splashing some of it on his face in an attempt to wake himself up. Still in a daze he shambled back to his room to get dressed.

¬†

Besides a few patches of bare carpet most of the floor in Chris‚Äô room was covered in piles of dirty clothes. Looking around the various piles he found a pair of jeans and a T-shirt that he thought looked clean enough. At least he couldn‚Äôt see any visible stains on them. He brought the T-shirt up to his face giving it a sniff. It had a slight odor to it, but since he wasn‚Äôt going into class today, he figured it was good enough.

¬†

With his head still reeling from last night he lethargically got dressed. Still wondering if he should just get back to bed. It felt like he had missed his chance though. He was already up, and his growling stomach wasn‚Äôt going to let him get back to sleep. Chris headed towards the apartment kitchen wondering if he was the first one up. Passing by Ricky‚Äôs room he knew it was too quiet for him to be awake yet. Ricky was somehow always lively in the mornings.

¬†

Rounding the corner into the living room he got a look at the aftermath from the party last night. Dozens of questionably empty cans and bottles were scattered everywhere across the tables and floor. The stockpile of liquor they had were now empty and cluttered across the coffee table. Looking at the TV he was shocked to see a firefighter‚Äôs axe buried in the middle of it. Seeing it didn‚Äôt help jog any memories from the previous night. He just chuckled to himself thinking it must have been some wild night.¬†

¬†

His growling stomach pulled his attention back to the kitchen. Still feeling the hangover from last night, he needed to make some eggs. Ever since parties in high school his older brother had told him eggs cooked in soy sauce were the best hangover cure. Regardless of whether it really worked or not Chris began to swear by it over the years making it his morning ritual after nights of heavy drinking.

¬†

Pilling up in the kitchen sink was the apartment's collection of all the pans caked with remnants of food. The last time Chris could even remember one of his roommates cooking was two weeks ago. For a brief moment he thought about cleaning one of the pans in pursuit of his hangover cure, but decided it was too much work. Instead, he grabbed a bowl and a box of cereal sitting on top of the refrigerator. It wasn‚Äôt ideal but it would have to do for now.

¬†

He opened the refrigerator looking for milk but couldn‚Äôt find any.¬† He had sworn there was a half-gallon in there yesterday. Taking a second look around the apartment he saw the carton of milk sitting out behind the pile of liquor bottles. Chris let out an annoyed sigh, Dan, must have been using it for white Russians again. He picked up the container, sniffing it to see if it was still usable. The rancid sour smell punched him in the nose.

¬†

Moving back to the kitchen he went to toss out the bad milk, but the garbage can was full. It had actually been well over full for a week now. Pizza boxes, old, microwaved meals, and beer bottles now formed a precarious tower pilling up from the trash can. Chris delicately balanced the milk carton on top of the pile of trash. It had become a game of Jenga his roommates all played to avoid taking out the trash. All of them would pile the trash as high as they could until it inevitably tumbled down. Whoever caused the pile to crash had to take out the trash.

¬†

The cardboard milk container sat delicately atop the pile. Chris loudly clapped his hand together in celebration. Quickly regretting it when it aggravated his own headache. Not a moment later Dan came out of his bedroom.

‚ÄúWhat are you clapping for this early bro.‚Äù

‚ÄúCause I‚Äôm not the one who‚Äôs taking out the trash from the party‚Äù, Chris said with a smug smile.

‚ÄúMight want to check on that one again‚Äù, Dan said pointing behind him at the now toppled over pile of garbage.

Chris turned around to see the spilled pile of trash covering the kitchen floor. Dan went over sprawling out on the couch, ‚ÄúChris you better get that milk cleaned up I can smell it from here.‚Äù Chris looked around the kitchen confused. The one thing he didn‚Äôt see scattered across the floor was the carton of milk. The smell was unmistakable though. Anywhere Chris moved he could smell the thick stench of rotten milk.

‚ÄúDan, you got to help me find that smell.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo way man I‚Äôm not the one who toppled the trash.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, you're the guy who probably spilled milk everywhere making his white russians!‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you're the guy who invited Becky over. You know crazy Becky the ‚Äúwitch‚Äù who tried to summon a demon with a YouTube video until Ricky put the axe through our TV. ‚Äú

¬†

Mike came out of the bedroom yawning, ‚Äúit‚Äôs too early for everyone to be this loud. What are you all yelling about anyway?‚Äù We can‚Äôt find where that milk smell is coming from. Mike pointed behind the couch, ‚Äúyou geniuses think maybe it's the milk carton behind the couch‚Äù Chris and Dan both erupted back into arguing about who should clean up the milk. Mike ignored them both walking behind the couch to pick up the milk carton. As he bent over to pick it up the milk carton opened a set of red eyes looking back at him. Two small legs and a tiny set of arms popped out from the carton as it dashed away from Mike.¬† He let out a scream and the milk carton began to run around the living room sloshing spoiled milk out from its open top.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is that thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúGrab it dude.‚Äù

All three of the roommates raced around the room chasing the milk carton trying to grab it. The milk carton nimbly avoided their grabs diving under the coffee table and around the couch. The three of them circled up to surround the Milk.¬† Mike lunged forward, the Milk dashed backwards moving right back towards Dan and Chris. Dan quickly reached out, snatching up the Milk carton by the top flap.

¬†

Dan dangled the milk carton in the air, shaking it by the top flap as it flailed its tiny limbs.

Mike laughed at the sight of it flailing around, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kinda cute.‚Äù

Chris looked uneasy, ‚ÄúWhat do you think that this is?

‚ÄúMaybe Becky actually summoned the milk demon last night‚Äù Dan said laughing poking at it with his finger. The milk container hinged in half revealing a sharp set or cardboard teeth. The razor-sharp teeth snapped down on Dan's finger severing it off. Dan screamed out dropping the Milk carton back to the floor and began clutching his hand. Despite his tight grip, blood began gushing out.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúChris get a towel‚Äù Mike shouted at him. Chris stood dazed in horror watching the blood run down Dan‚Äôs arm. Seeing him locked up Mike pushed him out of the way running toward the bathroom to get a towel. In the panic no one saw where the Milk carton disappeared to. Mike came running back in handing Dan a towel. Dan buried his shaking bloody hand in the towel. Mike spun around looking around the room and back at Chris who was still in shock. ‚ÄúWhere did that thing go?‚Äù Grabbing Chris by the shoulders he shook him repeating the questions. Chris stuttered back, ‚ÄúI.. I... don‚Äôt know. I lost track of it.

¬†

Ricky opened his door yawning as he leaned his head into the hallway. ‚ÄúHow are you all up this early?‚Äù He walked out into the hall letting out an even bigger yawn as he walked by the group. Mike grabbed him by the shoulder to stop him from going out into the living room. ‚ÄúThere's a demon in the apartment‚Äù Ricky brushed his hand aside as he walked over to the couch. ‚ÄúI know it's early guys but I'm not that gullible. You all have been spending too much time with Becky.‚Äù

¬†

Ricky sat down in his boxers putting his feet up on the cluttered coffee table. The smell of rancid milk wafted out from behind the couch.¬† He sniffed the air making a sour face, ‚Äúaww which one of you guys was that I can smell it all the way over here.‚Äù They all shouted at once trying to warn Ricky about the milk carton, but he couldn‚Äôt understand anyone as they shouted over one another. In the chaos of the shouting, they couldn‚Äôt hear the milk carton clawing its way up the back of the couch and creeping its way towards Ricky. It stood on the back of the couch staring at Ricky with a dull expression. Out of the corner of his eye Ricky saw something moving and turned to look. ‚ÄúWhoa I think I‚Äôm still tripping guys, you seeing this little guys too?‚Äù The milk let out a hiss as it hinged in half and opened its mouth wide, presenting its set of razor teeth.

¬†

It sprang forward at Ricky biting him across the neck. Ricky screamed out in pain, but the shout only lasted a moment. His scream turned into a hideous gurgling noise as blood ran down his throat. His hands pulled at the milk carton trying to rip it away, but he couldn‚Äôt pry it off. His effort didn‚Äôt last long. Before anyone could react, his arms and head fell to the side going limp. The milk turned back towards the other three roommates hissing at them with blood dripping from its mouth.

¬†

The blood and hiss sent Chris into a panic. He ran back towards his room tripping on his own feet. Pushing himself back up off the ground he dove the last few feet into his room as if the monster was chasing right behind him.¬† Chris grabbed a hold of his door to slam it, but Dan was right behind him toward the room. ‚ÄúGet in here‚Äù Chris shouted slamming the door behind Dan. ‚ÄúMike is still out there‚Äù Dan shouted trying to pull open the door, but Chris leaned against the door keeping it shut. ‚ÄúThat thing killed Ricky we can‚Äôt go back out there.‚Äù

¬†

In the living room Mike darted over to the TV yanking out the axe that was buried in the screen. He yelled out running with the axe ready to strike towards the milk carton. The carton turned back looking towards him letting out another evil hiss. With all his strength he swung the axe down at the milk carton, but it was too fast dodging out of the way. The axe came down hard, wedging itself deep into the back of the couch. Mike pulled on the axe, but it wouldn‚Äôt budge. Sharp claws formed at the end of the milk cartons stubby arms as it rushed towards Mike. It nimbly ran across the axe handle charging at him. Mike pulled his hands away from the axe bringing them up to protect his face as the milk carton launched itself at him. The milk carton swung its claws scratching at Mike's face. Using his arms, he blocked most of the scratches except for one catching him right above his left eyebrow.

¬†

Blood from the scratch trickled down his face forcing him to close his left eye. He reached out trying to grab ahold of the milk carton to crush it, but felt a searing pain shoot down his left arm. The Milk carton had latched down with its razor teeth biting into his forearm. Mike violently shook his arm trying to shake the milk carton off. Blood started pouring down his forearm. The more he shook his arm the tighter the jaws snapped down and the more blood sprayed across the living room. With the milk container clamped down on his arm he slammed it against the back of the couch hoping to shake it off. Still latching on the milk container let out a deep growl back at him. He moved to the coffee table trying to hit it against anything he could find to make it let go. Each time he slammed his arm against something he could feel the impact and shock.

¬†

After a few more swings hitting the milk against the coffee table he slowed down. He started to feel woozy and light headed from the blood loss. With his arm throbbing he couldn‚Äôt bear to hit it much more. His legs started to wobble and buckle. Reaching out he held himself up against the coffee table, and with his last bit of energy he slammed his arm into one of the liquor bottles lying on the table. Glass shards punctured into the milk carton as the glass exploded around the room. Mike fought to maintain his balance but fell to the ground with a thud clipping his head on the coffee table.

¬†

In the bedroom Chris and Dan heard the booming thud. ‚ÄúDo you think he got it?‚Äù Chris said, looking over at Dan. He ignored the question sitting slumped over and staring at the floor. His face had turned a ghostly pale and his hand was still clutching the bathroom towel. The white bath towel was now almost completely red drenched in blood. Chris started pacing back and forth in his tiny room, ‚ÄúWe gotta get out of here.. Or maybe call for help‚Äù¬† Chris kicked his bed frame in frustration, ‚ÄúMy phone is out there in the living room‚Äù. Dan looked back mumbling but Chris couldn‚Äôt understand

¬†

As the two waited in the room trying to plan their next move, they heard a strange sound. Something was scraping along the carpet floor being dragged towards the room. ‚ÄúMike?‚Äù Chris asked, but he could tell from the growing stench what was approaching. The rotten smell of milk had gotten even stronger as it seeped into his room.

¬†

A loud slam shook the door in its frame. Chris quickly locked the door quietly moving back away to his bed. He looked over to Dan who had gone limp and passed out on the floor. The loud crack knock at the door again even louder this time. Something was striking the middle of the door, but the milk carton should have been too small to reach. For a moment Chris wondered if maybe Mike really had taken care of the milk container.

¬†

With hesitation he slowly stepped back towards the door reaching out for the handle. When he reached out the edge of the fire axe came smashing through the door.¬† Chris jerked his hand back to avoid the splinters shooting out. Looking down through the small hole in his door he could see the milk carton looking back with its evil red eyes holding the axe. Small shards of glass were poking out of the milk container. Rancid milk seeped out of the glass wound soaking into the Carpet. Chris started to gag from the smell. He wondered how it had gotten so much worse in so little time.

The milk carton emitted a low growl at Chris menacingly gripping the handle of the axe. Seeing the tiny carton holding the axe he was sure there was no way it couldn't swing it. Ignoring the fact that the axe had already hit the door. The milk container whirled around lifting the axe straight up into the air and slamming it into the door.

¬†

Chris jumped back looking for anything in his room he might be able to defend himself with.

His eyes darted around from object to object. Laptop? no. Backpack? No even worse. Rum bottle? Good enough he thought, clutching the bottle in his hands. The fire axe cut through the door widening the hole into his room. The creature scrambled its way up to the door trying to force itself through the opening. Its clawed hands scratch and pulled on the sides of the hole tearing away wood splinters. Chunks of milk sloped off the milk carton as it struggled trying to force itself into Chris' room. Chris wildly swung the bottle trying to scare the creature back.

¬†

The Milk carton pulled away for a moment lining its mouth up with the hole in the middle of the door. With a gurgling noise it projectile vomited chunks of milk out at Chris. He tried to move out of the way but the milk rained down on him soaking his pants. Looking down at his pants he tried to brush away some milk with the bottle of rum, but he only rubbed the chunks of milk deeper into the fabric.

¬†

\*Ring\* \*Ring\*

Chris looked back up hearing the doorbell go off. He had only taken his eyes off the milk for a second, but he couldn‚Äôt see it through the opening anymore. Taking a cautious step forward he tilted his head trying to get a better angle to look through the hole in the door. He still couldn‚Äôt see the creature, but he could hear the sound of wet skittering steps moving back to the living room. He wondered if this was some elaborate trick.

¬†

After waiting a minute, the sound of the doorbell was replaced with a pounding at their front door.¬† (Who could be coming over this early? Did someone hear all the commotion and call for help). Cautiously Chris slowly opened the door tensing as it creaked. His eyes darted around looking for any sign of the milk carton. On the floor he saw puddles of milk leading back into the living room. He reached for the moist axe coated in milk pulling it out of his door.

¬†

The banging on the front door continued as he slowly made his way towards the living room. With each step his hands clenched tighter onto the axe ready to swing at any moment. Coming into the living room he saw the carton out of the corner of his eye. He turned immediately, swinging the axe as hard as he could. The axe cleaved an orange juice carton in half sending juice flying through the already filthy room.

¬†

Chris froze looking into the living room watching the juice scatter. Fear paralyzed him seeing Ricky and Mike lying dead on the floor. His knuckle turned white clutching the axe as tightly as he could. The banging on the door resumed causing Chris to almost jump out of his own skin. Terrified, he resumed his careful walk towards the apartment door.¬†

¬†

A familiar voice shouted through the door as the pounding continued. ‚ÄúWake up guys it‚Äôs Becky I know I left my jacket there.‚Äù Chris sighed in relief letting himself relax for a split second, but tension quickly crept back in. If it was only Becky at the door, she wouldn‚Äôt be able to help them fight off the creature or save his roommate.

¬†

Chris spotted Becky‚Äôs jacket sitting on the corner of the couch. He quickly pulled the jacket away with the axe ready expecting to see the milk carton. But all he saw was the worn away fabric arm of the couch. His eyes kept darting around the room as he backed his way up towards the kitchen to the door. With his back leaned up against the door he felt around for the handle fumbling around with the jacket in his hand not daring to take his eyes off the hallway.

¬†

After what felt like a minute, he found the doorknob.¬† Swinging the door open he saw Becky standing there looking annoyed. Becky was wearing her black tank top and skirt from the night before. She stood staring Chris eye to eye thanks to her tall platform boots.¬† ‚ÄúWhat's with the axe?‚Äù She said, raising her eyebrows.

¬†

Chris fumbled for words shouting ‚Äúyu..you have to get out of here‚Äù.¬† He shoved the black leather jacket at her trying to push her back. Becky grabbed the jacket back looking even more confused at Chris. As Chris went to slam the door, he heard the patter of tiny wet steps running up behind him. Spinning around he lifted the axe above his head bringing it smashing down onto the tile floor as the milk carton dashed by him.¬† It was making a break to run out of the apartment no longer caring about Chris or Becky.

¬†

Becky yelped, lifting her leg and bringing the platform boot smashing down on the milk carton. The carton crumpled under her heavy boot sending a spray of clumpy milk splattering out from the impact. Becky‚Äôs annoyed disposition now settled into anger looking at the rancid milk on her boots and jacket. ‚ÄúWhat the hell was that, Chris!? Ugh you are going to be getting the cleaning bill for my jacket.‚Äù Chris stood with a relieved smile on his face looking at the crumbled carton. ‚ÄúYeah, sure Becky‚Äù. With a huff Becky stormed away trying to shake the bits of milk off her boots.

¬†

Chris closed the door, locking it behind himself and leaning the axe up against the door frame. Man, I could really use a drink. He walked over to the fridge reaching into the bottom shelf for a beer. The sound of eggs cracking caught his attention. As he looked up on the top shelf of the fridge the egg carton was staring back at him snarling. The egg carton opened up forming a mouth with two rows of sharp teeth as it dove out at Chris clamping down on his face. He fell backwards lying on the floor of the kitchen as he tried to swat the egg carton off. The swatting quickly stopped as he bled out onto the kitchen floor joining his roommates.",2,1733230893.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1h5mv6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h5mv6p/bad_milk/,Bad Milk,"Chris woke up to the blaring sound of his alarm and a splitting headache. He sat up in bed wincing, closing his eyes from the sunlight flooding into the room. Blindly he reached out toward his nightstand slapping around till his hand found the snooze button on his alarm. Squinting at the alarm clock, the red lights blinked 8:00 AM. He didn‚Äôt remember setting the alarm last night, and eight in the morning was too optimistic even not hungover. Pulling his blanket back over his head he laid down trying to go to sleep.

The darkness didn‚Äôt help; it only made him realize how badly he needed to go to pee. Stepping out of bed his foot crushed down on a beer that wrapped itself around his foot. He kicked with his foot trying to shake the can free. As the can shook it sprayed the leftover contents around the room. Chris used his hand to pry the can off his foot, dropping it back on the floor as he rushed to the bathroom. On the way to the bathroom, he didn't notice the spill the can had made as the rest of its contents soaked into the carpet.

Stepping into the bathroom he was hit by the stench of day-old vomit. The smell made him gag, almost adding to the pile he saw clogging his sink. Wearing a disgusted expression Chris wondered who had thrown up into his sink last night. Whoever it was would have to clean it up, because he wasn‚Äôt about to take on cleaning today. In fact, he wasn‚Äôt about to clean any other day either. No one had cleaned the bathroom in months. A glance around the bathroom would have revealed mold and mildew in every nook and cranny and a yellow bathmat that was once white.

While at a glance the bathroom looked dingy it became unquestionably hazardous when Chris opened the lid to the toilet. Looking down into the bowl the inside was covered in a brown fuzz resembling a sea anemone floating in the ocean. The disturbingly unkempt toilet might have made scientists question whether the four roommates had succeeded in creating a new lifeform. Spawned by a regiment of protein shakes and incubated in a toilet that hadn‚Äôt seen cleaning products in two years.

The sight didn‚Äôt faze Chris in fact he barely glanced down as he pulled his boxers down to pee that morning. Once he finished, he ran his hands under the cold water from the faucet splashing some of it on his face in an attempt to wake himself up. Still in a daze he shambled back to his room to get dressed.

Besides a few patches of bare carpet most of the floor in Chris‚Äô room was covered in piles of dirty clothes. Looking around the various piles he found a pair of jeans and a T-shirt that he thought looked clean enough. At least he couldn‚Äôt see any visible stains on them. He brought the T-shirt up to his face giving it a sniff. It had a slight odor to it, but since he wasn‚Äôt going into class today, he figured it was good enough.

With his head still reeling from last night he lethargically got dressed. Still wondering if he should just get back to bed. It felt like he had missed his chance though. He was already up, and his growling stomach wasn‚Äôt going to let him get back to sleep. Chris headed towards the apartment kitchen wondering if he was the first one up. Passing by Ricky‚Äôs room he knew it was too quiet for him to be awake yet. Ricky was somehow always lively in the mornings.

Rounding the corner into the living room he got a look at the aftermath from the party last night. Dozens of questionably empty cans and bottles were scattered everywhere across the tables and floor. The stockpile of liquor they had were now empty and cluttered across the coffee table. Looking at the TV he was shocked to see a firefighter‚Äôs axe buried in the middle of it. Seeing it didn‚Äôt help jog any memories from the previous night. He just chuckled to himself thinking it must have been some wild night.¬†

His growling stomach pulled his attention back to the kitchen. Still feeling the hangover from last night, he needed to make some eggs. Ever since parties in high school his older brother had told him eggs cooked in soy sauce were the best hangover cure. Regardless of whether it really worked or not Chris began to swear by it over the years making it his morning ritual after nights of heavy drinking.

Pilling up in the kitchen sink was the apartment's collection of all the pans caked with remnants of food. The last time Chris could even remember one of his roommates cooking was two weeks ago. For a brief moment he thought about cleaning one of the pans in pursuit of his hangover cure, but decided it was too much work. Instead, he grabbed a bowl and a box of cereal sitting on top of the refrigerator. It wasn‚Äôt ideal but it would have to do for now.

He opened the refrigerator looking for milk but couldn‚Äôt find any.¬† He had sworn there was a half-gallon in there yesterday. Taking a second look around the apartment he saw the carton of milk sitting out behind the pile of liquor bottles. Chris let out an annoyed sigh, Dan, must have been using it for white Russians again. He picked up the container, sniffing it to see if it was still usable. The rancid sour smell punched him in the nose.

Moving back to the kitchen he went to toss out the bad milk, but the garbage can was full. It had actually been well over full for a week now. Pizza boxes, old, microwaved meals, and beer bottles now formed a precarious tower pilling up from the trash can. Chris delicately balanced the milk carton on top of the pile of trash. It had become a game of Jenga his roommates all played to avoid taking out the trash. All of them would pile the trash as high as they could until it inevitably tumbled down. Whoever caused the pile to crash had to take out the trash.

¬†

The cardboard milk container sat delicately atop the pile. Chris loudly clapped his hand together in celebration. Quickly regretting it when it aggravated his own headache. Not a moment later Dan came out of his bedroom.

‚ÄúWhat are you clapping for this early bro.‚Äù

‚ÄúCause I‚Äôm not the one who‚Äôs taking out the trash from the party‚Äù, Chris said with a smug smile.

‚ÄúMight want to check on that one again‚Äù, Dan said pointing behind him at the now toppled over pile of garbage.

Chris turned around to see the spilled pile of trash covering the kitchen floor. Dan went over sprawling out on the couch, ‚ÄúChris you better get that milk cleaned up I can smell it from here.‚Äù Chris looked around the kitchen confused. The one thing he didn‚Äôt see scattered across the floor was the carton of milk. The smell was unmistakable though. Anywhere Chris moved he could smell the thick stench of rotten milk.

‚ÄúDan, you got to help me find that smell.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo way man I‚Äôm not the one who toppled the trash.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, you're the guy who probably spilled milk everywhere making his white russians!‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you're the guy who invited Becky over. You know crazy Becky the ‚Äúwitch‚Äù who tried to summon a demon with a YouTube video until Ricky put the axe through our TV. ‚Äú

¬†

Mike came out of the bedroom yawning, ‚Äúit‚Äôs too early for everyone to be this loud. What are you all yelling about anyway?‚Äù We can‚Äôt find where that milk smell is coming from. Mike pointed behind the couch, ‚Äúyou geniuses think maybe it's the milk carton behind the couch‚Äù Chris and Dan both erupted back into arguing about who should clean up the milk. Mike ignored them both walking behind the couch to pick up the milk carton. As he bent over to pick it up the milk carton opened a set of red eyes looking back at him. Two small legs and a tiny set of arms popped out from the carton as it dashed away from Mike.¬† He let out a scream and the milk carton began to run around the living room sloshing spoiled milk out from its open top.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is that thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúGrab it dude.‚Äù

All three of the roommates raced around the room chasing the milk carton trying to grab it. The milk carton nimbly avoided their grabs diving under the coffee table and around the couch. The three of them circled up to surround the Milk.¬† Mike lunged forward, the Milk dashed backwards moving right back towards Dan and Chris. Dan quickly reached out, snatching up the Milk carton by the top flap.

Dan dangled the milk carton in the air, shaking it by the top flap as it flailed its tiny limbs.

Mike laughed at the sight of it flailing around, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kinda cute.‚Äù

Chris looked uneasy, ‚ÄúWhat do you think that this is?

‚ÄúMaybe Becky actually summoned the milk demon last night‚Äù Dan said laughing poking at it with his finger. The milk container hinged in half revealing a sharp set or cardboard teeth. The razor-sharp teeth snapped down on Dan's finger severing it off. Dan screamed out dropping the Milk carton back to the floor and began clutching his hand. Despite his tight grip, blood began gushing out.¬†

‚ÄúChris get a towel‚Äù Mike shouted at him. Chris stood dazed in horror watching the blood run down Dan‚Äôs arm. Seeing him locked up Mike pushed him out of the way running toward the bathroom to get a towel. In the panic no one saw where the Milk carton disappeared to. Mike came running back in handing Dan a towel. Dan buried his shaking bloody hand in the towel. Mike spun around looking around the room and back at Chris who was still in shock. ‚ÄúWhere did that thing go?‚Äù Grabbing Chris by the shoulders he shook him repeating the questions. Chris stuttered back, ‚ÄúI.. I... don‚Äôt know. I lost track of it.

¬†

Ricky opened his door yawning as he leaned his head into the hallway. ‚ÄúHow are you all up this early?‚Äù He walked out into the hall letting out an even bigger yawn as he walked by the group. Mike grabbed him by the shoulder to stop him from going out into the living room. ‚ÄúThere's a demon in the apartment‚Äù Ricky brushed his hand aside as he walked over to the couch. ‚ÄúI know it's early guys but I'm not that gullible. You all have been spending too much time with Becky.‚Äù

¬†

Ricky sat down in his boxers putting his feet up on the cluttered coffee table. The smell of rancid milk wafted out from behind the couch.¬† He sniffed the air making a sour face, ‚Äúaww which one of you guys was that I can smell it all the way over here.‚Äù They all shouted at once trying to warn Ricky about the milk carton, but he couldn‚Äôt understand anyone as they shouted over one another. In the chaos of the shouting, they couldn‚Äôt hear the milk carton clawing its way up the back of the couch and creeping its way towards Ricky. It stood on the back of the couch staring at Ricky with a dull expression. Out of the corner of his eye Ricky saw something moving and turned to look. ‚ÄúWhoa I think I‚Äôm still tripping guys, you seeing this little guys too?‚Äù The milk let out a hiss as it hinged in half and opened its mouth wide, presenting its set of razor teeth.

¬†

It sprang forward at Ricky biting him across the neck. Ricky screamed out in pain, but the shout only lasted a moment. His scream turned into a hideous gurgling noise as blood ran down his throat. His hands pulled at the milk carton trying to rip it away, but he couldn‚Äôt pry it off. His effort didn‚Äôt last long. Before anyone could react, his arms and head fell to the side going limp. The milk turned back towards the other three roommates hissing at them with blood dripping from its mouth.

¬†

The blood and hiss sent Chris into a panic. He ran back towards his room tripping on his own feet. Pushing himself back up off the ground he dove the last few feet into his room as if the monster was chasing right behind him.¬† Chris grabbed a hold of his door to slam it, but Dan was right behind him toward the room. ‚ÄúGet in here‚Äù Chris shouted slamming the door behind Dan. ‚ÄúMike is still out there‚Äù Dan shouted trying to pull open the door, but Chris leaned against the door keeping it shut. ‚ÄúThat thing killed Ricky we can‚Äôt go back out there.‚Äù

¬†

In the living room Mike darted over to the TV yanking out the axe that was buried in the screen. He yelled out running with the axe ready to strike towards the milk carton. The carton turned back looking towards him letting out another evil hiss. With all his strength he swung the axe down at the milk carton, but it was too fast dodging out of the way. The axe came down hard, wedging itself deep into the back of the couch. Mike pulled on the axe, but it wouldn‚Äôt budge. Sharp claws formed at the end of the milk cartons stubby arms as it rushed towards Mike. It nimbly ran across the axe handle charging at him. Mike pulled his hands away from the axe bringing them up to protect his face as the milk carton launched itself at him. The milk carton swung its claws scratching at Mike's face. Using his arms, he blocked most of the scratches except for one catching him right above his left eyebrow.

¬†

Blood from the scratch trickled down his face forcing him to close his left eye. He reached out trying to grab ahold of the milk carton to crush it, but felt a searing pain shoot down his left arm. The Milk carton had latched down with its razor teeth biting into his forearm. Mike violently shook his arm trying to shake the milk carton off. Blood started pouring down his forearm. The more he shook his arm the tighter the jaws snapped down and the more blood sprayed across the living room. With the milk container clamped down on his arm he slammed it against the back of the couch hoping to shake it off. Still latching on the milk container let out a deep growl back at him. He moved to the coffee table trying to hit it against anything he could find to make it let go. Each time he slammed his arm against something he could feel the impact and shock.

With his arm throbbing he couldn‚Äôt bear to hit it much more. His legs started to wobble and buckle. Reaching out he held himself up against the coffee table, and with his last bit of energy he slammed his arm into one of the liquor bottles lying on the table. Glass shards punctured into the milk carton as the glass exploded around the room. Mike fought to maintain his balance but fell to the ground with a thud clipping his head on the coffee table.

¬†

In the bedroom Chris and Dan heard the booming thud. ‚ÄúDo you think he got it?‚Äù Chris said, looking over at Dan. He ignored the question sitting slumped over and staring at the floor. His face had turned a ghostly pale and his hand was still clutching the bathroom towel. The white bath towel was now almost completely red drenched in blood. Chris started pacing back and forth in his tiny room, ‚ÄúWe gotta get out of here.. Or maybe call for help‚Äù¬† Chris kicked his bed frame in frustration, ‚ÄúMy phone is out there in the living room‚Äù. Dan looked back mumbling but Chris couldn‚Äôt understand

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it‚Äôs time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero‚Äôs journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can‚Äôt even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don‚Äôt wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

1h5mt0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/mounjarouk/comments/1h5mt0y/new_here_2_months_in/,New here 2 months in,"So I'm about to start my 7.5mg journey soon.

I've been skulking around here for about 3 months as I decided that this was the tool I was going to use to reset my weight.  I'd historically floated between 12st 7lb and 13st.

I started this year at 16st 10lbs and after a few events (my best friend passing away and building the courage to leave an unhappy relationship and get out of a toxic job and into a new one) I decided to start rewriting my future as i seen where it was going.  Started getting the numbers down and basically decided if I don't change things I'm going to last less time than my Dad did and I wanted to kick start my transformation.   

I started my MJ journey at 16st 3lbs today I'm 14st 12lbs.  I've gone from a 44 inch waist to a 39.5 inch waist and that beer belly has gone down substantially.   I'm actually starting to feel good about myself and my body image again and I'm squashing back into jeans I haven't been able to squease into for 7 years.  It ain't cosy but my ass can get back in them again!!!!

It's not been without its side effects, sulfer burps, acid reflux (thank god for gaviscon) and that dreaded constipation (chugging water and black coffee like a thing possessed)

Each of us I've seen has a different journey with this stuff but I can safely for me.  It's life changing to get back some control in terms of weight and health,  allowing me to put in the work and see actual results in a reasonable time from without falling back into stress and emotional eating.  I plan on in the future when I get to under 13st to go it alone from mj and let my own discipline and control take over once more like I used to in my late 20's.",3,1733230694.0,mounjarouk,1,1.0,False

https://preview.redd.it/3w4mlkh1pm4e1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a8bb3f456a667b6e3f9ddb3f49f232d414a41a9

**The Weight of Shadows**

Elliot sat on the edge of his bed, staring at the darkened window. Outside, the faint glow of a streetlamp seeped through the gaps in his curtains, casting faint, jagged lines across the floor. It was quiet now, the city around him long asleep, but his mind churned relentlessly.

It always did at this hour.

He rubbed his hands together, fingers trembling slightly. His skin was cold, despite the warmth of the room. He‚Äôd once read that the body responded to prolonged stress by prioritizing essential organs over extremities. It made sense‚Äîhis hands and feet always felt numb these days.

The weight in his chest hadn‚Äôt lifted in years. It sat there like a stone, pressing down with unrelenting force. Therapy hadn‚Äôt helped. Medication blunted the sharp edges of his pain, but the shadows remained. Friends tried to be supportive, but over time, their patience wore thin. He‚Äôd learned to hide his struggles, burying them beneath polite smiles and quiet nods.

Elliot reached for the small, worn notebook on his bedside table. Its pages were filled with scribbled thoughts, fragments of poetry, and sketches of strange, swirling shapes. It was his only outlet, a place where the cacophony in his head could spill out in some tangible form. He flipped to a blank page and picked up a pen, but his hand froze mid-air.

He didn‚Äôt know what to write anymore.

&#x200B;

Mornings were the hardest. The sound of the alarm always jolted Elliot out of a restless sleep, his heart racing as if he‚Äôd been woken in the middle of a nightmare. Today was no different. He slapped at the phone to silence the noise, then lay back, staring at the ceiling.

Another day. Another battle.

He knew he had to get up. There was work to do, emails to answer, people to placate. His job in marketing was high-pressure and relentless‚Äîan irony he recognized, given his complete lack of energy. But bills didn‚Äôt stop for burnout. He forced himself out of bed, shuffled to the bathroom, and splashed cold water on his face.

In the mirror, a hollow-eyed stranger stared back at him. His once-vibrant green eyes were dull now, framed by dark circles. His hair was unkempt, his skin pale. He looked like someone twice his age.

‚ÄúPull it together,‚Äù he muttered, but the words felt hollow.

&#x200B;

The subway ride to work was suffocating. The packed car buzzed with a cacophony of voices, the rumble of wheels on tracks, and the occasional screech of brakes. Elliot stood in the corner, gripping a pole, his headphones providing a thin barrier between him and the world. He tried to focus on the podcast playing in his ears, but his thoughts kept drifting.

He thought about the night his mother had died, her frail body hooked up to machines that beeped rhythmically. He thought about the years of verbal abuse from his father, words that cut deeper than any wound. He thought about his ex, the one person who had come close to understanding him, until the weight of his struggles drove her away.

The memories came unbidden, vivid and suffocating. He clenched his jaw, willing himself to stay present, but the knot in his chest tightened.

&#x200B;

At work, Elliot moved through the day like a ghost. He answered emails, attended meetings, and nodded at his colleagues‚Äô small talk, but it all felt like going through the motions. His mind was elsewhere, trapped in an endless loop of ""what ifs"" and ""if onlys.""

During lunch, he sat alone in the breakroom, picking at a sandwich he didn‚Äôt really want. He scrolled through his phone, mindlessly thumbing past pictures of smiling faces and exotic vacations on social media. It felt like everyone else had figured out how to live, while he was stuck in survival mode.

The rest of the day passed in a haze. By the time he got home, exhaustion weighed on him like a heavy cloak. He dropped his bag by the door and collapsed onto the couch, staring at the ceiling.

&#x200B;

That evening, something shifted.

Elliot was scrolling through a mental health forum when he came across a post about somatic therapy. He‚Äôd heard of it before but dismissed it as too ‚Äúout there.‚Äù But tonight, desperation made him curious. He clicked on the post and started reading.

The writer described how trauma could live in the body, manifesting as tension, pain, and chronic stress. They talked about learning to release it through simple exercises‚Äîshaking, stretching, breathing. It sounded strange, but as Elliot read more, he felt a flicker of something he hadn‚Äôt felt in years: hope.

He bookmarked the post and found a short video demonstration. The instructor had a soothing voice and guided viewers through a series of movements designed to relax the nervous system. Elliot hesitated, then pushed himself off the couch.

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù he muttered.

He followed along, awkwardly at first, feeling self-conscious even though he was alone. But as he moved, something shifted. His body felt heavy, yet lighter at the same time, as if he was finally releasing a tension he hadn‚Äôt even realized he was holding. When the exercise ended, he sat on the floor, breathing deeply.

For the first time in years, the stone in his chest felt a little smaller.

&#x200B;

The weeks that followed weren‚Äôt perfect. Elliot still had bad days, moments when the shadows threatened to pull him under. But he kept at it‚Äîpracticing the exercises, journaling his progress, and even reaching out to a therapist who specialized in somatic work.

He began to notice small changes. His shoulders didn‚Äôt feel as tight. His headaches became less frequent. He even managed to smile at a coworker‚Äôs joke, a genuine, unforced smile that surprised him as much as it did them.

One evening, as he sat on the floor of his apartment, he realized something profound. Healing wasn‚Äôt a straight line. It wasn‚Äôt about erasing the past or pretending the pain didn‚Äôt exist. It was about learning to carry it differently, to make room for both the darkness and the light.

Elliot picked up his notebook and flipped to a blank page. This time, the words came easily.

‚ÄúI am still here,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúAnd for now, that is enough.‚Äù

&#x200B;

***Part 2***

https://preview.redd.it/i934e77bpm4e1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce85a2e9b56d0aeac31e24d84d5ebc513546cd56

**The Light Beyond the Shadows**

Elliot stood in the middle of the park, the early morning sun casting a golden glow across the landscape. He inhaled deeply, filling his lungs with the crisp, dewy air. A gentle breeze brushed his face, carrying with it the faint scent of blooming flowers. He smiled‚Äîan effortless, genuine smile that came from a place deep within. It wasn‚Äôt forced, nor was it fleeting. It simply *was*.

The weight that had once lived in his chest, the tightness in his shoulders, and the constant hum of anxiety were all gone. After years of tireless work, Elliot had arrived at a place he once thought impossible‚Äîa life free of trauma, tension, and pain.

&#x200B;

It had been a long and arduous journey.

The years of practicing TRE (Tension and Trauma Releasing Exercises) had been transformative, though not always easy. At first, the tremors felt strange, almost unsettling. The deep shakes that rippled through his body seemed to awaken long-buried fears, old memories, and emotions he hadn‚Äôt realized were still lodged in his mind. But he trusted the process. Slowly, those tremors became softer, quieter, and increasingly pleasurable, like a gentle wave ebbing and flowing through his body.

The end stages of the journey were the most profound. The tremors had grown so subtle they were barely noticeable, yet they carried with them a sensation unlike anything Elliot had ever known‚Äîa warm, pleasurable current that radiated from his pelvis, through his core, and out into every fiber of his being. It felt like pure joy, like peace made physical.

&#x200B;

Today, Elliot no longer needed to work to feel balanced. Peace had become his natural state. Where there was once anxiety, there was now calm. Where depression had taken root, there was joy.

He walked through the park, noticing the details he had once overlooked: the way the sunlight dappled the ground through the trees, the delicate dance of a dragonfly over the pond, the laughter of a child chasing bubbles. Each moment felt vivid, alive, and full. Life was no longer something to endure‚Äîit was something to *experience*.

Elliot had also noticed changes in how others responded to him. People seemed naturally drawn to his presence. Strangers would strike up conversations with him, their faces lighting up as they talked. Friends confided in him more often, saying they felt calmer, lighter, just by being around him. His newfound charisma wasn‚Äôt something he tried to cultivate‚Äîit simply emerged as a byproduct of his healing.

&#x200B;

Later that morning, Elliot met a friend for coffee. Julie had been with him through some of his darkest moments, offering her unwavering support even when he‚Äôd had little to give in return. She greeted him with a hug, and as they sat down, she tilted her head, studying him.

‚ÄúYou look... different,‚Äù she said, smiling. ‚ÄúPeaceful. Like you‚Äôve figured out something the rest of us haven‚Äôt.‚Äù

Elliot chuckled. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôve figured it out. It‚Äôs more like... I‚Äôve let go of everything that wasn‚Äôt mine to carry.‚Äù

Julie raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúEverything?‚Äù

‚ÄúEverything,‚Äù he said, his voice steady and certain. ‚ÄúThe anger, the fear, the guilt. It‚Äôs gone. And without all of that... there‚Äôs just this.‚Äù He gestured around them. ‚ÄúLife. As it is. Perfect in its imperfection.‚Äù

Julie leaned back in her chair, her eyes softening. ‚ÄúYou make it sound so simple.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs simple,‚Äù Elliot said, ‚Äúbut not easy. It took years of work. Facing things I didn‚Äôt want to face. Allowing my body to process what my mind couldn‚Äôt. But it was worth it. Every painful moment was worth it.‚Äù

&#x200B;

After coffee, Elliot wandered back home, a small apartment that now felt like a sanctuary. He had kept his life simple‚Äîa cozy couch, a bookshelf filled with his favorite stories, a few plants that thrived in the sunlight streaming through the windows. It was enough.

He sat cross-legged on the floor, closed his eyes, and let his attention drift inward. There was no tension, no lingering unease‚Äîjust the soft hum of life coursing through him. A gentle warmth began to rise from his pelvis, spreading upward like a current of pure light. It wasn‚Äôt an intense feeling, nor was it fleeting. It was steady, comforting, and deeply pleasurable.

This was the sensation that had become his constant companion. It wasn‚Äôt tied to any external circumstance or fleeting achievement. It was simply the natural state of a body and mind free from trauma.

&#x200B;

As the day faded into evening, Elliot reflected on the man he used to be. He remembered the nights spent battling insomnia, the days weighed down by despair, and the moments when he‚Äôd doubted whether life was worth living.

But those memories no longer carried pain. They felt like watching an old movie‚Äîdetached, distant, almost surreal. He could see how every struggle, every setback, had been part of his journey. Even the darkest moments had served a purpose, pushing him to grow, to heal, to become the man he was today.

He thought about the people who were still in the midst of their struggles, and his heart ached for them‚Äînot with pity, but with compassion. He knew what it was like to feel lost, to feel like freedom was an impossible dream. But he also knew that healing was possible.

Elliot had started volunteering at a local trauma recovery center, sharing his story with others who were just beginning their journeys. He didn‚Äôt try to fix them or offer quick solutions. Instead, he simply listened, holding space for their pain and reminding them, in his own quiet way, that there was hope.

&#x200B;

That night, as Elliot lay in bed, he felt the gentle rhythm of his breath, the rise and fall of his chest. His body was completely relaxed, his mind quiet. Sleep came easily now, as natural as the turning of the seasons.

Before drifting off, he whispered a silent thank you‚Äîto himself, for never giving up; to the people who had supported him; and to the mysterious, unyielding force of life that had guided him through the shadows and into the light.

For the first time, Elliot felt certain of one thing: he was free.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***Part 3***

https://preview.redd.it/2npza79spm4e1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d84e94db1abb1d5201fd539c0667a58d3d8059d6

**The Eternal Now**

Elliot walked barefoot along the riverbank, the coolness of the damp earth grounding him in the present moment. Every step was a symphony of sensation‚Äîthe texture of the soil, the gentle pressure of his foot sinking into it, the rhythmic flow of the river beside him. The world wasn‚Äôt merely alive; it was ecstatically alive, pulsing with a divine energy that mirrored the infinite expanse within him.

He paused, gazing at the sunlight refracting off the water, each ripple casting shimmering rainbows. There was no barrier between himself and the world around him. In fact, there was no ‚Äúself‚Äù as he once knew it. The sense of a separate identity, of a ‚Äúme‚Äù distinct from the rest of existence, had dissolved years ago, leaving only pure awareness‚Äîa vast, boundless stillness in which all of creation arose and fell away.

&#x200B;

**The Years of Transition**

Elliot‚Äôs life had profoundly transformed after he freed himself from trauma and tension. For years, he had basked in the peace and joy that came from a nervous system unburdened by the weight of his past. Yet even in that state of blissful freedom, a quiet yearning had stirred within him‚Äîa call to go deeper.

He began exploring the nature of awareness itself. Meditation, once a tool to soothe his mind, became a portal to profound insights. He turned his attention inward, asking questions that unraveled the fabric of his old reality. *Who am I? What is this awareness that perceives all things? What lies beyond thought, beyond emotion, beyond identity?*

The answers didn‚Äôt come as words or concepts but as direct experiences. As he focused awareness on itself, the boundaries between observer and observed began to blur. At first, these moments of unity were fleeting, like glimpses of the sky through a break in the clouds. But over time, the gaps between them closed. Awareness settled into itself, unwavering and constant.

Elliot‚Äôs practices shifted naturally. The trembling release of TRE gave way to the subtle flow of kundalini energy‚Äîa powerful, ecstatic current that rose from the base of his spine, clearing every remaining trace of blockage from his system. Yoga and breathwork became effortless expressions of his being rather than deliberate practices. Eventually, even meditation fell away. There was no longer a need to ‚Äúdo‚Äù anything. Awareness simply *was.*

&#x200B;

**Living in Enlightenment**

Several years had passed since Elliot reached what some might call enlightenment, though he rarely used the word himself. Words, he found, often obscured the truth rather than revealed it.

His mind was utterly still unless engaged with the world‚Äîspeaking, working, or creating. In moments of stillness, there was no internal dialogue, no thinking about the past or future. Thoughts arose only when needed and dissolved just as easily. Beneath this stillness, a profound ecstasy coursed through his body, continuous and unrelenting. It was an intensity that would have overwhelmed the Elliot of years ago, but now it was as natural as breathing.

Even sleep had transformed. He no longer experienced unconsciousness or dreams. Instead, there was a seamless continuity of awareness, whether his body was awake or resting. The cycles of day and night unfolded like waves in the infinite ocean of his being, but his sense of self remained untouched by time.

&#x200B;

**The Nature of the Eternal Now**

Elliot no longer sought happiness or fulfillment, for these were his natural state. Suffering, which had once shaped his existence, was a distant memory. Even pain, when it arose, was experienced as a sensation without attachment or aversion. He marveled at the simplicity of it all: suffering had never been inherent to experience; it was merely the mind‚Äôs resistance to what *is.*

The world, too, had taken on a new clarity. He saw through the illusion of separation‚Äîthat the river was flowing, the trees swaying, the sun shining *within* him as much as outside of him. Every moment shimmered with the presence of the Eternal Now, an unbroken flow of being that included everything and excluded nothing.

&#x200B;

**A Simple Life, Rich in Being**

Elliot lived a quiet, unassuming life in a small cabin nestled among the trees. He had no need for grand pursuits or possessions. The simplicity of existence was more than enough. He tended a small garden, cooked simple meals, and occasionally worked on art or writing, not out of necessity, but as expressions of the joy within him.

People occasionally came to him, drawn by the lightness of his presence. They would sit with him, ask questions, or simply share a cup of tea in silence. Elliot never claimed to be a teacher or guru. Instead, he listened deeply and spoke sparingly, pointing others toward their own inner truth.

One young woman, Sarah, asked him one day, ‚ÄúHow do I find what you have? This peace, this freedom?‚Äù

Elliot smiled softly. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt find it, because it isn‚Äôt lost. What you seek is already within you, waiting to be uncovered. Start by being still, by observing the mind without judgment. Follow the pull toward what feels true. And when you‚Äôre ready, turn awareness back on itself.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut how will I know when I‚Äôm ready?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll know,‚Äù he said, his eyes glimmering with gentle certainty. ‚ÄúThe journey is unique for everyone, but the destination is always the same. And it‚Äôs closer than you think.‚Äù

&#x200B;

**A Moment of Timelessness**

One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, Elliot sat on the porch of his cabin, watching the sky transform into a canvas of deep oranges and purples. A bird sang its final song of the day, its melody weaving through the stillness.

There was no need to name the beauty before him, no need to capture it or hold onto it. It simply unfolded, moment by moment, within the infinite expanse of his awareness.

Elliot closed his eyes, not to retreat from the world, but to dissolve into it. The ecstasy within him surged, not as a peak, but as a steady, eternal wave. In this moment, as in every moment, he knew one simple truth:

He *was* the sunset. He *was* the bird‚Äôs song. He *was* the stillness in which all things appeared and disappeared.

(The contest is now legally old enough to drink grape juice in Japanifornia!)

Your task is to write up an Ace Attorney case where a noun I supply below is an important part of the case. After the deadline passes (see below), submissions will no longer be taken and the community will vote for submissions in a Google Form. 

Prizes are as follows:

**1st Place: buy you a pizza** *($15)*

*In addition, u/tenetox will compose a custom soundtrack piece specific for your case!*

**2nd Place: buy you a burger** *($10)*

**3rd Place: buy you a coffee** *($5)*

**In the comments, I will make a post that will give a template of what your submission should look like.** If possible, please fill in all the sections in the template, including N/A if needed. **Feel free to reply to that comment in regards to questions or general discussion. The rest of the thread is for submissions only.**

Regarding the description area, feel free to be descriptive as possible! If you fear the post is too long, you may post the description over several comments or through another source such as Google Docs. There is no word limit, so please do not worry about such.

And remember, **don‚Äôt hold back your creativity!** Your case can be a standard AA case, it can be a reminiscence case, or an Investigations-style case! *(Given the new release, I'd encourage trying an Investigations-style case, though obviously this isn't a requirement.)* 

However, there are some limitations. First, **dark topics are allowed, but discuss them with me beforehand.** That goes for abuse, gore... basically, anything that might require a content warning besides your standard Ace Attorney crime. **Do not be dark just for the sake of being dark or edgy** -- if you are going to include such a topic, have a reason for including it. If you do include such a topic, **please include a content warning at the start of your case.**

Also, **joke posts are allowed, but only ones that are well-thought out, clever, and/or high-quality.** Anything like ‚ÄúThE PHoEnIX wiRIGHT TUnraBOOT: sOMEONE DIED aND phEENIX HAd TO dFEENdED THem!!!1!"" is not allowed.

1h5mj2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h5mj2l/aitah_for_not_wanting_to_forgive_my_mum_for/,AITAH for not wanting to forgive my mum for attacking my insecurity?,"Edit: after discussing it with her she allegedly was not referring to my condition down there at all (I assumed she was because i had told her about it in distress years ago when it happened and it seemed to targetted when she said it today), she merely used that language and imagery to try and scare me into putting my clean clothes of the floor, something that I already do so I'm not sure why bring it up. This seems genuine. One the one hand it's a lot better that she didn't knowingly attack an insecurity, but on the other hand i'm not sure whether her actual meaning is still acceptable. She does seem genuinely sorry it appears so I'm more inclined to forgive her.

TLDR: me (19m) and my mum (50-60f) were arguing about my cleanliness ‚Äì I feel she is too controlling over the flat‚Äôs cleanliness; she feels I‚Äôm too lax and disgusting about it. I brought the argument up at an inconvenient time when she was on the cusp of leaving for an appointment, and in annoyance she brought up my cleanliness and said that it was the reason I had a ‚Äúplague on my penis‚Äù (I have PPP) which I found hurtful considering personal hygiene is one of those things I actually take very seriously and take a lot of steps to maintain, and she attacked a heavy insecurity of mine and I don‚Äôt think it was justified.

I‚Äôm 19, currently living at home in the UK and going to uni next year. My mum is around 50-60 (I don‚Äôt know specifically :/). She‚Äôs recently been feeling quite under the weather and last night she came home feeling rather miserable. She had intended to cook a meal I was really looking forward to scranning down, but she said she was too ill to make it. I figured I want the meal, she can‚Äôt cook it, why don‚Äôt I just cook it? It was spinach and ricotta stuffed pasta, how hard could it be ‚Äì cook down some spinach mix some cheese scoop it into some pasta chuck it in the oven bada bing bada boom, food. However, she flat our refused, she said she didn‚Äôt want me making a mess and having to deal with the clean-up. I found this a bit frustrating as I intended to take care to not produce a mess, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm usually that messy. The thing is mum thinks otherwise. I tend to clean up my mess with a very ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù mindset, but mum goes further. It‚Äôs her house and she seem to get really distressed if things aren‚Äôt exactly how she wants them; if there‚Äôs a few bits of dirt from shoes in the entrance, if there‚Äôs some crumbs from lunch on the counter, she complains every week after cleaning while alluding to me as the culprit that there are white dirt particles all over the hallway floor. When she goes to show me, she points out two miniscule specks that I would assume are just everyday debris that no one would notice, I certainly don‚Äôt, but she does. Because it‚Äôs only us two living together and there‚Äôs no real third party, I find it very difficult to tell whether my perceptions are out of whack, or if it‚Äôs hers, or if we‚Äôre both of kilter or neither. I just don‚Äôt know. But I do know I‚Äôm tired of her insinuating that I‚Äôm a disgusting creature all the time. I try and take good care of myself and my hygiene; I brush my teeth thoroughly, when I shower I scrub myself over everywhere I can, twice, when I clean the bathroom every 2 weeks I try and really get in all the nooks and crannies of where the dirty spots are especially around the toilet etc, I do my skincare every day and generally I try and keep the spaces around me hygienic if not entirely tidy, it‚Äôs really personally frustrating and hard to discern the truth from when I feel like she caricaturises me as some sort of disgusting hopeless beast quite often. So obviously, what she said grated and it wasn‚Äôt sitting right with me and a lot of frustrations about how she talks to me and treats me started to come up. I think that a lot of these frustrations come from simply a difference in where we‚Äôre at; I‚Äôm 19 and I really do feel the need to be independent and autonomous from her. I‚Äôm really sick of being controlled and dismissed by my parents, my dad was a manipulative narcissist and my mum was a heavily depressed individual whose always been very controlling about how her house is maintained and especially as a younger child I remember her dismissing my emotions quite often and forcing a regime of ‚ÄúI know better‚Äù, even when I just wanted to communicate how I felt. So I tried bringing it up, but frankly I‚Äôm quite bad at verbal conversations like this and I think I worded things pretty annoyingly: I explained to her that I thought it wasn‚Äôt reasonable for her to have an issue with me simply cooking a dish in the kitchen, I thought it was unreasonable for her to be so obsessed with the cleanliness and frankly a little annoyance at her characterization of me was seeping through I fear. She wasn‚Äôt happy with this and told me point blank that she was feeling way too ill and tired to talk about this right now. As much as I just wanted to get this conversation over with and come to some better understanding, I conceded and left her be.

This morning, I decided to try bringing it up again, when she had 5 minutes before, she had to leave the house for a dentist appointment ‚Äì not really my brightest move honestly. I was so desperate to get this over with and not lose the opportunity to talk about it that I didn‚Äôt consider timing enough, and straight up that was selfish on my part I feel. I did try wording things better, and I explained that I didn‚Äôt like how she characterized me as a disgusting mess creator. She doubled down and gave examples of mess I had made; when I wash the dishes the sink isn‚Äôt always left clean as it should afterwards, the counters have crumbs on them after I‚Äôm done (this I dispute because she does the exact same thing extremely often, I just don‚Äôt clean it up for her because it‚Äôs her problem not mine I don‚Äôt want her to clean my mess up that‚Äôs my responsibility to learn from I feel. Maybe that‚Äôs the wrong way of going about it but it is how I view it), that when I cleaned the bathroom last week I hadn‚Äôt cleaned the little ridge underneath the top toilet seat fully (I really do try in the toilet this made me quite annoyed with myself for missing it), that in the morning when I make coffee I always end up leaving some coffee grounds around even when I clean up after myself I apparently don‚Äôt do it properly (I thought I did ‚òπ) and she said there were many more. She also said she doesn‚Äôt bother telling me about them because I never listen, and she doesn‚Äôt want to run after me all the time; fair. When she does try and tell me about these things she is very cut and dry about it from my perspective; ‚Äúyou did this wrong and this and this, I wouldn‚Äôt so fix it‚Äù. It‚Äôs never a ‚Äúhey ik ur trying u did alright just remember this next time‚Äù it‚Äôs just ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do that, remember that you missed that, and it‚Äôs annoying‚Äù. I‚Äôm likely being a nit-picky asshole here I fear but I‚Äôd rather she didn‚Äôt talk down to me like a hopeless puppy from time to time about these things. Again, I have no third party here to witness things so I don‚Äôt know whether I should be giving validity to these feelings or not.

Anyway, after she said that I conceded a bit and admitted that ok you were right about some of those, I‚Äôm just tired of the way you characterise and treat me. I did bring up the fact that I didn‚Äôt like how it felt when she spoke down to me condescendingly while pointing out my failures like I‚Äôm a hopeless puppy. My intent was that we both lay out how we feel bare and work from there, so I figured I‚Äôd do that. At this point she was obviously rather annoyed, she had barely a minute left before she had to go, and I was bringing another criticism of her that she was tired of. Things escalated and she mentioned me leaving my clothes on the floor when I got to take a shower (for context, I leave my dirty clothes on the floor and put my clean ones off the floor), saying that I was disgusting for doing that and that no wonder I had a ‚Äúplague on my penis‚Äù (more context: during puberty some bumps appeared under my weens head and it was extremely mortifying, I searched it up and it‚Äôs called PPP, I went to the doctor about it once then, and again recently and both times have been told that it happens to some guys during puberty, it‚Äôs not a serious sign of anything like negative sexual health or bad hygiene. They also offered no solutions as it wasn‚Äôt a serious problem, the doctor on my most recent visit even advising that it may cause issues like ED if I did. Online information seems to corroborate this, and I remain sceptical of any removal programs because I haven‚Äôt yet done enough research into it. While I‚Äôve come to terms with having a weird penis, it‚Äôs very much a point of insecurity for me. Due to a lot of childhood trauma, I have incredibly low self-esteem so this plays into it). When she said this, I calmly pointed out that I think she overstepped and that she surely must know this, and she refused to acknowledge it and denied that she had gone too far. She left shortly after and I felt very much like my trust had been broken and had a meltdown ‚Äì these happen fairly often when I get very emotional, and I don‚Äôt do them in front of people because I don‚Äôt want to make a scene.

She‚Äôs still out of the house currently and I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm willing to forgive her for what she's said; I know for a fact I would never attack her or any of my closest companions‚Äô insecurities no matter how annoyed at them I may be, and I feel very confused and hurt that she would do this to me. On the other hand, I‚Äôve been being a bit of an annoying git I fear and brought this conversation up at genuinely terrible and selfish times, so I understand why she may have done this. Frankly, I just don't know what to think anymore and I don't know whether I can trust my own perceptions.",4,1733229752.0,AITAH,10,0.75,False

Recently (like two days ago) received a k6, and tried immediately on my very entry level de longhi. 
Like, tried a lot, I used at least 250g of beans in these two days. 

I come from Italy, used a medium, maybe someone would say medium light but it really is a medium, lavazza oro (don't know when it's roasted), ground it many different levels (from 38 clicks to 45 clicks), all the time with the same yield (10g in, 27 out); tried a smaller ratio, both 2 and 2.5 but shots were very fast and usually sour. 

Time has always been fast, literally never more than 22 seconds no matter grind level (k6 suggest 40 clicks, as I said I tried from 38 to 45) and with finer settings I felt like shots were beginning to channel (I WDT). 

Some of the shots with coarser levels (43/44) were good I'd say, probably very muddy but also sweet; some other, though, same grind level, same time, same everything were bitter, sour, or sometimes both. 

Might I add, I only have pressurised baskets and I've not been able to find non pressurised baskets compatible with my delonghi. 

Is there something, other than the machine itself, that might explain the incosistency? Something I should watch out for when WDT-ing, maybe using more or less coffee might have some difference? Maybe I should learn to temo-surf with my machine? 

Also, my machine uses a 51mm portafilter, does it matter whether it explicitly says ""compatible with 201ec""? May I just buy whatever 51mm single walled basket?

Thank you all, hope the question is clear",1,1733228409.0,espresso,11,1.0,False

1. I know what a serotonergic buzz or dopaminergic buzz feel like from past experiences
2. despite this I have no stim cross tolerance
3. I bought the nootropicdepot kanna pills

I tried ""primming"" for a week at 15mg sublingual

I felt an effect from day 1, the effect peak at \~30 mins and is meh.

4) I felt no primming, same response from day one to day 6

There is a slight head buzz but it is weaker than e.g. bromantane, which already is not very potent.

I feel zero stimulation (energy, motivational salience) increase from my sober state

I feel no hedonic increase (smiling, music enhancement, joy, etc)

There might be a slight relaxation but it feels non potent

The buzz is a slight alteration of consciousness (you know its there as a discrete background feeling) but this buzz feels useless.

Moreover the effect is short lived like 1-2hours max

I've tried 25mg sublingual with no much improvement.

so is it individual differences? Are the nootropicdepot pills bad? Does primming require longer duration?

1h5m3cl,https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1h5m3cl/galantamine_is_no_joke/,Galantamine is no joke,"I had a few short, shitty LDs after 9 months of diligent practice; detailed dream journaling whenever I had a dream, frequent reality checks (which so far in dreams have passed, meaning they worked as they would in real life), as much ADA as I can and even meditation, some basic supplementation like vitamins. Healthy sleep schedule. WBTB every night (due to natural awakenings).

Finally got my hands on some galantamine and I gotta say, that shit is just bananas. I have had vivid dreams quite like this, but they were random and I suppose just the culmination of ""just right"" dietary and sleep conditions that I was not actively taking part in. But this was so goddamn real. I may as well have been in another dimension.

I was climbing up this little forest trail and I mean, I felt the wind, I felt the dirt crumbling beneath my hands (I was on all fours for whatever reason), the cold soil staining it, the clothes on my body, every leaf crunching, birdsong, I even got out of breath as I went up. And I thought ""I'll be at the top soon"" and I was. There was this totally serene and beautiful sunrise over these mountain tops and this little city below, with dozens of people from my life all walking around unaware of one another. I could see IN to their homes, not in a pervy way I could just observe their life in detail. One guy was making coffee, one guy was taking out the trash, two girls were walking their dogs. All so close together. It was like I was able to see everything. It was like my entire reality was MC Escher works except I could sort of control it.

But here's the kicker, I wasn't even that aware. Flying is great but it wasn't my primary goal. And believe me it was very peaceful and fun. And neat to look into the world like that. Then I had some inception type dreams where I woke up in another place and had to explain to the dream characters what I was doing. I wasn't lucid for that at all but it was just as realistic if not a bit more phantasmagoric.

So, i have a big problem with drinking water. I find it disgusting, i hate it and i never want to drink it. I had a coca cola addiction, which i am glad i got rid of after 15 years. 
I hate alcohol, can't stand the test so i have never drank it. No beer or wine or whatever. 
No coffee, no hot tea of other hot beverages.
I usually drink cold green ice Thea.
Arfid usually is affected with foodz but how are you with drinking (water)?",1,1733228070.0,ARFID,4,1.0,False

1h5m0j3,https://www.reddit.com/r/I_DONT_LIKE/comments/1h5m0j3/i_dont_like_making_everything_a_trend/,I don‚Äôt like making everything a trend,"It feels like we‚Äôre all running in a race we didn‚Äôt sign up for, trying to keep up with whatever's popular today. One minute, something's ‚Äúcool,‚Äù and the next, it‚Äôs yesterday‚Äôs news. There‚Äôs this pressure to be part of it all, like if you don‚Äôt follow the crowd, you‚Äôre somehow left behind. But, when did it all become about what‚Äôs *in* instead of what feels *right* to us? 

Sometimes, it feels like trends make us forget the simple joys that aren‚Äôt attached to any social media buzz or hashtag. Why can‚Äôt we just enjoy the little things without needing them to fit into some bigger picture? That quiet walk with a coffee, the book you can‚Äôt put down, or the way your cat curls up on your lap‚Äîthese small, untrendy moments are often the ones that make life feel complete.

We‚Äôre all unique, and what brings us happiness doesn‚Äôt always have to be loud, flashy, or trending. In fact, the things we truly love often don‚Äôt need the world‚Äôs validation. It‚Äôs okay to not follow every new wave. The real trend is finding the beauty in being yourself, without worrying if it‚Äôs ‚Äúin‚Äù or ‚Äúout.‚Äù So, let‚Äôs slow down, embrace the untrendy, and live in the moments that actually make our hearts smile.
