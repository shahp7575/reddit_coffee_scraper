I‚Äôm just a regular uni student trying to get by. I‚Äôve been friends with a senior from my department, and I‚Äôm just concerned. 

We‚Äôve known each other since we were in highschool. We weren‚Äôt the closest back then, buuut i guess friendly enough that even his class knew me. Now that we‚Äôre in college, im even more confused... He follows me around even more and and trying to be around me, and honestly, who wouldn‚Äôt start thinking about it? 

I guess I might be overthinking because I do like himüò≠üò≠ü§ß and i cant tell what hees thinkig sometimes. He‚Äôs blunt, serious faced, and principled, maybe just stubborn, but he‚Äôs also kind, very considerate, especially to me who‚Äôs introverted and awkward. I always have my own little world, but he still finds time to come see me after class. On top of that, he‚Äôs attractive, has muscles, popular in uni because he‚Äôs on the basketball team, and his time in the student government. I do try to initiate hang outs too, but it scares mee sometimes thinking hell get tired of.me eventually and find better company.

If it‚Äôs anythingg, he also sends me gym updates. Is that unusual? I never dated so idrk..

And as im typing this he‚Äôs just asked and planning to visit an opening coffee shop with me this Sunday.

So‚Ä¶ does my senior like me? Or am I just clowning myself?

The whole thing is just driving me crazy since I hate that I‚Äôm apparently unable to ask something so simple.

1nwh0rb,https://i.redd.it/le1bl87nqrsf1.jpeg,Oklahoma 25 Goldback,"Bathed in golden light and seated gracefully on the hood of a classic 1960 Chevrolet Impala 348 Convertible, the young woman on the Oklahoma 25 Goldback embodies *Hospitalitas*‚Äîthe timeless virtue of hospitality. With quiet confidence and a welcoming smile, she gazes toward the horizon, representing the open-hearted spirit of Oklahoma along the nation‚Äôs most iconic highway: Route 66.

This piece is set during what is often called the golden age of the American road trip‚Äîa period from the 1940s to the 1960s when Route 66 thrived as a symbol of freedom, discovery, and adventure. It was a time when the journey itself was part of the destination, and few places played a more central role in that journey than Oklahoma.

Commissioned in 1926, Route 66 carved a bold path through the heartland, stretching from Chicago to Santa Monica. For many small towns across Oklahoma, it was their first direct link to the national highway system. It didn‚Äôt just move cars‚Äîit moved lives. It brought commerce, culture, and connection, turning quiet crossroads into vibrant hubs of American life.

In the 1930s, Route 66 became a road of survival during the Dust Bowl, as thousands of Oklahomans journeyed west in search of hope. John Steinbeck called it the ‚ÄúMother Road‚Äù because it carried entire generations through hardship toward new beginnings. But in the postwar decades, that same road blossomed into something new: a living symbol of American hospitality, adventure, and optimism.

To meet the steady flow of travelers, Oklahomans built unforgettable roadside attractions‚Äîcharming, quirky, and heartfelt. These weren‚Äôt just businesses; they were invitations. From the smiling face of the Blue Whale of Catoosa to the architectural wonder of the Round Barn in Arcadia, each stop welcomed strangers like old friends. Modern landmarks like the glowing neon soda bottle at Pops 66 Soda Ranch carried that tradition into a new era, and even nearby icons like the towering Golden Driller of Tulsa remind us of Oklahoma‚Äôs strength, heritage, and resilience.

This artwork brings all of these stories together into a nostalgic visual tapestry. The Rock Caf√© sign glows behind the central figure‚Äîone of the original Route 66 diners that has endured the Dust Bowl, fire, and the test of time. Above her, a hawk soars, symbolizing the freedom of the open road. And delicately placed in her hair and on her lap is the Oklahoma Rose, the state‚Äôs official flower and a symbol of enduring beauty, pride, and grace.

She is not rushing toward a destination‚Äîshe *is* the welcome. She represents every Oklahoman who has ever poured a cup of coffee, fixed a flat tire, offered a warm meal, or simply smiled and waved at someone passing through.

As *Hospitalitas* reminds us, greatness lies not only in where you're going‚Äîbut in how you're treated along the way.

And so, at the bottom of this note, an enduring truth is written:

‚ÄúThe open road knows no strangers.‚Äù

I would love to show you [Caffeine Clock 2.0](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AWSoft.CaffeineClock), a caffeine tracker app that helps you know exactly how much caffeine is in your body and how much will be there when you go to sleep.

So, let's start with a bit of context. I am a very heavy caffeine user - think multiple coffees a day, an energy drink, and a bunch of Coke Zero on top of it - so I've always sought to improve my awareness of how much caffeine is actually in my body. Particularly, I wanted to know if I could still have that coffee and still have good sleep at night.

Back about one and a half years ago, I was travelling in Japan solo, and I didn't have that much to do and drank a lot of Starbucks - so over the evenings and on rainy weekends, I created **Caffeine Clock** **1.0** (a version you can still see on Apple App Store, until they approve the new one, hopefully soon) - It was also an opportunity to learn React Native, a technology I always wanted to try out as a web developer myself.

The app was very basic, but it worked - and without almost any promotion (a couple of Reddit posts), it gained a small audience of people who really liked it. Now, I didn't want to promote it too much or monetize it, since I didn't think it was very good. It had glaring issues, such as lack of personalization, the dashboard visualization was extremely basic, and the caffeine calculation itself didn‚Äôt account for absorption time or the time it takes to drink it.

A few months ago, I finally decided to jump back into it and make it the app I always wanted it to be.

**Introducing** [**Caffeine Clock 2.0**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AWSoft.CaffeineClock)

Basically, I am trying to make it the best caffeine tracker there is.

* Accurate caffeine algorithm ‚Äî able to take the absorption rate and a ""sipping"" duration into account to actually give you a realistic estimate
* Comprehensive onboarding, which (at least I hope) gives relevant questions supported by studies ‚Äî those will set your caffeine half-life and sleep safe threshold
* Over 200 drinks in the database ‚Äî or create your own as well.
* Fully offline ‚Äî the data is only on your phone. No login, nothing. You can move the data from phone to phone.
* Analytics ‚Äî including average caffeine consumption, a streak of days where your caffeine amount was good at your bedtime, drinks breakdown, etc.
* Localized into 5 languages (some of them AI translated, please help me if you find something weird)
* Free. It is supported by ads, and there is an option to support the app and remove them.

This is hopefully just a start! If the app is popular, I'd love to create widgets and watch integrations, and a bunch of other features.

Please tell me what you think!

Every two days or on weekend when we had time, we would take turns driving back and forth to see each other. We‚Äôve grown incredibly close with each other‚Äôs families and it was really wonderful to see. My younger sister bickers with him like he is her older brother, and I formed a great relationship with his older sister, Lana, (30F). His sister and I would go shopping together, get coffees, host events together and occasionally do sibling vacations. 

Lana has a very aggressive and blunt personality, but it was never toward me so it never bothered me and I never judged her for it. It‚Äôs like having a super confident, Malibu Barbie that was ready to fight for you as an older sister. 
6 months ago, Lana moved out to live with her boyfriend, and has brought most of her clothes with her. She calls his house home, decorated it, bought furniture, bought and raised chickens, grew a garden, and made it a home for the both of them. But, she still keeps a lot of her old furniture and other clothes in her childhood room upstairs in her parent‚Äôs house, AND in a two room addition downstairs. 

She had hinted to me that there might be a day she needed to come home, and wasn‚Äôt ready to give up her room downstairs. I completely understand this and empathize with her, and always asked before moving anything in to her upstairs bedroom so I wouldn‚Äôt make her feel pushed out. When I asked if I could move her dresses in the upstairs bedroom to move in my things, she sent me a text with a picture of 1/8 of the closet moved over and said ‚Äúyou can use here‚Äù. 

When I was actually moving in; I texted her again if it was ok to move all the clothes downstairs, which she agreed to. 

Now, the fight
Two years ago my boyfriend bought a house. He tried getting me to move in with him after making some repairs, but I wasn‚Äôt ready at the time to move away from home. The house also needed (still needs) a lot of work. It‚Äôs been abandoned since 1975 and has to be fully gutted and repaired. It‚Äôs absolutely gorgeous, just needs a little TLC. He‚Äôs a contractor and I‚Äôm a designer, so we know exactly what we want and have been working on making it a home together. We can‚Äôt live there until we are cleared for occupancy, which may be another two months, but it‚Äôs hard for him to make time to work and manage the property when we spend so many hours commuting. 

Just last month we decided I would move in with him and his family so that we can manage our time better, live together, and prepare the house for move in. I personally asked both of his parents separately to make sure they were comfortable with this adjustment, and they approved. I had already been sleeping over half the time, help to clean the house, cook meals and assist where I can so his parents didn‚Äôt have any quarrel with me staying. I also offered to pay rent or help with bills which they rejected. 

My mom was sad to see me go, but my brother had moved out himself two years ago so she was prepared for me to leave next, and knew I would still be close enough. She helped me to pack my belongings and we had a really heartfelt farewell. I‚Äôd never lived away from home before, but it was definitely the goodbye you‚Äôd imagine when the kid finally leaves home in the movies. Mom cried, dogs tried to follow me into my car, dad yells ‚Äú see ya kid‚Äù and sister doesn‚Äôt care because she gets a bigger room and will see me for brunch in a week. 

I drove the hour out to his parents house with all my belongings and Sam helps me to unload them into the living room. We fully intended to bring them upstairs into his sister‚Äôs old bedroom like I was given permission to. I could sleep in my boyfriend room and get ready privately in the room next to his where my things were organized, and it was a perfectly comfortable situation where everyone was happy. Her dad greeted us at the door, but stopped us from dropping them in the living room and made us put them in Lana‚Äôs old room. I told him no, said I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with it and that it was Lana‚Äôs space. Kinda like this: 

Sam‚Äôs dad: I don‚Äôt want these down here, you both would be more comfortable in the addition, move it in there. 

Me: no, we are moving these upstairs.  I don‚Äôt want to move in twice, Sam and I would be comfortable with the agreed arrangement and I don‚Äôt want to upset Lana. 

Sam‚Äôs dad: she moved out; she decided to go and she can come get her things. Leave your stuff in there for now. 

Sam: just do it for right now, we will worry about it tomorrow. 

Stupidly, I listened to them and left my things in the room. This was around 4pm, and Sam and I were waiting for his dad to leave so we could move the boxes upstairs and get organized. Then Lana called, and she invited us to her home for dinner. We agreed, got changed and darted over. Everything was well, the boys wanted to go drinking; next thing you knew we were at a bar. 

For whatever reason, Sam thought this would be a great moment to ask Lana if we could take the downstairs. I need to preface: I DID NOT WANT TO MOVE DOWN THERE. I respect her space, I recognize that I am a guest and didn‚Äôt want anything to happen which would evidently follow. 
She. Blew. Up. 
Publicly. 
I mean, screaming like a banshee. I think I heard her shriek. I sat there on my phone while the two of them argued with each other in front of 50 other people at the bar. She said in front of her boyfriend, ‚Äú what if he and I broke up and I wanted to come home, you are not allowed to move into my space, I‚Äôm generous enough to let OP take the upstairs.‚Äù  

It was extremely uncomfortable, and she ended up running out onto the lawn to cool down. I followed her to console her, and reassured her I didn't want the downstairs and had no plans to move in. The space was Lana's if she ever felt the need to come home. I told her that her dad had made me leave my boxes downstairs, but that I had every intention of moving them in the morning. She calmed down a bit, and then we went back to talking about next day plans. 

She was reserved to go to the same brunch spot as Sam and I with a friend. She would go at 12pm, us at 10am. Well, Sam and I slept in. 

We got there super late at 12:15. I looked for her but didn‚Äôt see her around and figured they changed plans. Then - I got a text 

‚ÄúHey I moved your things with Erica, did you want the dresser too?‚Äù

Lana has my location. She had waited for me to leave the house, came back home to her parents house with the help of her friend to move my things and rummage through them, and then left. 

My whole life was in those boxes. Medications I take for certain health issues, jewelry that Sam has bought for me for birthdays, sentimental items and other. I trust Lana to move my things, but it made me super uncomfortable that she had her friend help her to look through and move my belongings without my knowledge and sneakily. 

When Sam‚Äôs dad found out, he lost it on Lana. His dad had noticed we weren‚Äôt living downstairs and when he asked, Sam told him about the prior day. He went over to her house and apparently they had a big fight about being overly territorial, and invading privacy. 

A week had passed and I hadn‚Äôt heard anything so I texted Lana to clear the air. I will post messages if need me but summarized it was- 

‚ÄúHey, I haven‚Äôt heard from you in a while and I heard about you and (Sam‚Äôs dad). I just wanted to let you know the other day made me uncomfortable. I understand if you wanted to move my things out of your room, but I‚Äôm not comfortable with Erica going through my things. I don‚Äôt trust her. I‚Äôd prefer not to see her anymore. I do hope you are doing well. I love and miss you, talk to you soon.‚Äù

It was crickets for a few days, and then finally she sent me a text that was so large it came as an attachment. In this, she said the following: 

-I was always naive and too young to handle these situations 
-she has constantly given me grace over the years for the way I‚Äôve acted because of my age and that she is embarrassed of me in front of her friends. 
-that I am entitled and that she can‚Äôt believe I have the audacity to ask her friend and her connections for legal advice (I sent one text to her friend who is also a lawyer for a quick question)
-that I need to learn my place that that I had taken advantage of her kindness and generosity 
- how dare I scheme to take over her older bedroom and that I had all the time in the world to move the boxes myself. 
- if I didn‚Äôt want my things to be looked through then I shouldn‚Äôt have had them out
- how dare I have the audacity to dictate who will be invited and who I can be around when she invited them. 

I. Was. Flabbergasted. And in tears. At this point I was calling Sam to tell him I wanted to leave and go back home. I couldn‚Äôt do this for the rest of my life and tolerate being talked to like this, especially when I‚Äôve been in her corner the whole time. He convinced me to stay, and when his parents came home they sympathized with me and told me ‚Äúit‚Äôs just how she is‚Äù. 

Things were quiet for about another week, until his mom tried to show me a video of Lana while I was cooking dinner. I politely declined in which she said , ‚Äú you need to get over it and stop holding grudges‚Äù. 

Sam was pissed about this but didn‚Äôt say anything. I had asked him almost every day to talk to Lana and defend me, settle it or whatever and he never did. Finally, Lana came over. She and her dad made amends. Sam went downstairs to talk to her, and then she texted me, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go for a walk‚Äù

Reluctantly, I came downstairs and walked outside with her. She tried hugging me, I refused. I‚Äôm not comfortable with hugging people when I‚Äôm upset with them, I need to work things out first. When I said that she yelled at me and claimed this was her trying. We started walking, I let her talk first. 

She kept repeating how she had given me grace, given me grace, her friends are embarrassed of me etc etc. 

AFTER 20 LONG MINUTES and a mile later, I asked her, ‚Äúwhat grace?‚Äù  
She then goes onto say I flirt with her boyfriends and her friends boyfriends. That she knows I don‚Äôt mean it because I‚Äôm just so nice but that it‚Äôs embarrassing how I always need attention. That I shouldn‚Äôt have male friends. I shouldn‚Äôt post when I go to the gym. 

THEN. She said, ‚Äú you told me you and Sam were moving into together. I thought wow nice. And then you told me how your mom was moving. And I just think it‚Äôs funny how those two things are happening at the same time and I know you are using my brother for a place to stay because you can‚Äôt go home‚Äù 

When I tell you my jaw DROPPED. the whole world went silent and all I could hear were sirens. I literally felt my body shake I was so angry. The audacity of HER. YES, My mom was moving, 10 minutes away to a house with bedrooms that fit all of her kids. I am always welcome home, but chose to move out here, transfer my job and restart what I‚Äôm used to just to be with her brother. I was not using him, and at this point definitely wanted to leave. 
My Instagram is literally a picture of my dog, pictures of Sam and I, and designs I‚Äôve made. Her Instagram is bikini pictures, collections of herself at the gym, AND she occasionally texts her exes. I‚Äôve never judged her for it, but between the two of us, I am loyal to my boyfriend and always have been. My family and I have a great relationship, and this was beyond thetruth. The worst part? She told all of her friends the same things so they think the same of me too. 

I kept walking to cool off and sent her back to the house by herself without saying another word. When I got back, everyone was waiting for me. Her dad nodded his head and I lost it. 

At the end of it, I asked for time and space. Her dad felt it was fair, my boyfriend was quiet, and she kept trying to say how she wasn‚Äôt in the wrong. 

We have not talked since. The next day, Lana came with her boyfriend and moved out all of her things. She cursed off her parents and loaded the car. 

Now two weeks later.. I‚Äôm alone in the house with Sam‚Äôs mom when she starts crying. Saying I have to stop doing this, that she doesn‚Äôt blame me but that Sam won‚Äôt talk to Lana because of me, and her husband is upset with her because his daughter won‚Äôt talk to him but will talk to the mother. The whole family is a mess right now, and I can‚Äôt help but to feel guilty for being in the center of all of this, but I never cut Lana off. She‚Äôs never tried to call or text, and she still seems to be on a war path. 

For anyone still reading.. am I the asshole in this situation? I did block her on Instagram for obvious reasons, but I really don‚Äôt know what to do

**Current Position:**

1,197 shares @ $2.75 avg cost and adding to it as I can.

**History:** So once upon a time I found this stock when screening on finviz. Read through it because it was a dollar and thought ‚ÄúI think this is gonna go up. Lemme check it again tomorrow.‚Äù I got busy and didn‚Äôt buy- checked in and it was $2‚Ä¶ Then $3‚Ä¶ Then $4.. Watched it soar and finally bought some at the dip, figuring it will double peak. It did and I sold. I then watched it for months as it bled slowly back to the $1 range and bought 1250 shares @ average cost of $1.67. Sold between $4-$7 on US franchise liscense news. Now rebuilding my position at $2.75 because I am high on hopium.

# The Bull Case

https://preview.redd.it/3s4cdwc8orsf1.png?width=681&format=png&auto=webp&s=75e9456e4c5765d1a7e2305557463b21314f4a53

**Aggressive Expansion:** 30+ new US locations across 9 states plus 3 international locations planned (announced Feb 2025). This is massive growth for a micro-cap.

https://preview.redd.it/lo653gw9orsf1.png?width=765&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0b6e8c27d2d9ee19020c763fad19c3b4bc63d05

**No Dilution (Yet):** Company withdrew its FormRW registration statement in September 2025 - the planned public offering was never started. This signals they don't need to dilute shareholders immediately, which is huge for a cash-strapped company.

**Valuation:** Trading at $2.52, down from highs of $8.50+. Significant upside if expansion happens.

**The Debt Issue:** People worry about their debt, but Starbucks carries enormous debt too. It's normal for retail/caf√© expansion - real estate, buildouts, and equipment require capital. The question is whether they can execute.

# The Bear Case (Being Honest Here)

**Delisting Risk:** Currently under Nasdaq compliance review for missing the minimum $2.5M stockholders' equity requirement. Company has appealed but outcome is uncertain. If delisted, liquidity could disappear fast.

[Reborn Coffee Intends to Appeal Delisting Notice from Nasdaq](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1707910/000121390024056186/ea020855701ex99-1_reborn.htm)

**Execution Risk:** Franchise agreements don't equal open locations. They need to actually deliver on 30+ stores, and the timeline is unclear. Young company without a proven track record at scale.

**Financial Health:** Micro-cap with limited cushion. If they don't need capital, why consider an offering in the first place?

**Technical Chart:** Clear downtrend from $8+ highs, recently bounced from $1.30 lows. Currently at $2.52 - reversal or dead cat bounce? Volume declining.

# My Thesis & Price Targets

**Scenario 1 (Bull): Target $10+** Delisting appeal succeeds, location openings get announced, Europe expansion news drops. Some new developments in Asia. Stock re-rates higher.

**Scenario 2 (Base): Target $3-4** Company muddles through compliance, some locations open but slower than expected. Stock trades sideways to slightly up.

**Scenario 3 (Bear): Target $1** Delisting news hits hard, panic sets in, expansion stalls, liquidity crisis. Stock crashes. 

  
**Why I'm Betting on Scenario 1**

The FormRW withdrawal suggests they found another path forward. 30 locations don't get announced unless there's real momentum. Risk/reward at $2.75 seems favorable, and I've traded this before - it can move fast when it wants to.

# Risk Management

This is 1/3 of my portfolio and i‚Äôm adding to it as I get my salary- probably too much for most people. I don‚Äôt really plan on being wrong, but at least I can use the tax write off.

# Key Catalysts

**Near-term (NOV):** Delisting appeal decision, first new location announcements, any financing news

**Medium-term (3-6 months):** Europe expansion, franchise rollout progress, quarterly earnings

# Final

Please share with me your thoughts and analysis. This is my first post, shilling my bags but open to discussion. I‚Äôve been wrong more than once.





**TL;DR:** High-risk micro-cap coffee chain with 30+ locations planned. Recently withdrew dilution plans (bullish?). Fighting delisting (bearish). Could 3-5x if execution works OR could go to zero. I'm betting on the upside but this is NOT financial advice.

**Positions:** 1,197 shares @ $2.75

*This is not financial advice. I'm an idiot on the internet. Do your own research.*

1nwgqnr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nwgqnr,I have been having a really weird allergic reaction to something,"I dont know what happened. Series of events:


- i had a uti that i was trying to cure. Got some tests done and was waiting for results to get a prescription 

- i just moved into a new place, there was a lot of packing and cleaning involved. Might have gotten bit by a house spider or two (normally not a big deal)

- i set up my kitchen with a new fridge and everything. Unfortunately i went to my parents for a couple of days and came back to moldy vegetables in the fridge. I handled that without gloves and tried to save whatever i saw was fine and not visibly moldy 

- i brought fresh spinach (by fresh i mean fresh out of the soil). It was nasty though so i had to clean it by hand multiple times and cut it up and cook it and also save some in the fridge for later 

- it was pretty hot that day and after everything i was super exhausted and sweaty so i took a shower and went to bed

- next morning i had a friend coming over so i quickly had breakfast and once she came we had coffee together and i ordered her some pizza and we are sitting and chilling and watching a movie. I realize i have been scratching my arms and my tummy for quite a while. I thought maybe its an insect or a spider. I decide to take a quick shower so i scrub everything and shower. Twice. 

- later that evening i realize my whole body is red and covered in bumps. Im having an allergic reaction to something so i go to the er and they inject me some antihistamines and some avil and i feel better instantly. The itch and rashes are gone instantly. 

- next morning i receive my uti results and get that prescription. I start that dose. I have coffee. I decide to have the leftover spinach because i want to see if it was the spinach that did this. An hour later, the itching begins again 

- this time the itch is different, like its in places it wasnt the day before. I go to the er again, today they give me a steroid in my muscle and reassure me that the reaction will go down but id need to get a thorough review with a dermatologist to isolate the cause. 

- i cone home and take the uti med and also the new anti allergy prescription from the er about the rash. 

- two hours later, i have new itchy spots and currently i cant sleep because i am so uncomfortable. I need help. What is happening? Pictures are from two hours ago - its much worse now in some places 

Can anyone tell me is this a food allergy or what??

I work as a receptionist/office admin (my boss just calls me ‚Äúreceptionist‚Äù), but my daily tasks go far beyond what I expected. Here‚Äôs a rundown of what I do:

* Make payment plans for clients with the IRS
* Respond to IRS notices and make payments for clients
* Enter client info in NYS tax center
* Upload Power of Attorney (POA) and Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) documents online
* Prepare BOI forms and organize tax returns
* Prep and submit IRS 2848 forms
* Run marketing leads: call and email prospects daily until they yell to fuck off literally ( he says to call even if they don't answer every day)
* Scan all documents loads for CEO and co-workers and emailing it to them or saving them.
* Answer all client questions via phone, email, and WhatsApp
* Call clients daily for bank statements,checks, and other documents from clients
* Take SMS codes and other sensitive info from clients
* Create and maintain client profiles in CRM software
* Make coffee for CEO and clients
* Organize and clean CEO‚Äôs office and the main office
* Open, organize, and mail correspondence
* Drop off USPS mail and Amazon returns
* Call vendors (like fish tank cleaning)
* Welcome guests and clients.
* Order office supplies
* Support team by relaying their requests to the boss and assisting them

Other issues:

* My boss doesn‚Äôt pay me on time
* He lets me stay hours after my scheduled shift without paying
* No paid sick leave
* Every time I ask for something or clarification on a note that client sends , he adds more tasks
* Doesnt want to give me any rais been working there for over a year and taking min wage/ less.

It feels strange at first, but it trains your brain to switch languages more naturally.

1nwgkx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/aistory/comments/1nwgkx8/void_janitor_the_quiet_dark/,Void Janitor: The Quiet Dark,"The comms went dead six months ago. Not with a scream, but with a sigh. One weekly data dump was a little thin, the next was nothing at all. Just the endless, empty hiss of the cosmos. The Intersolar Company, in its infinite corporate wisdom, decided a six-month radio silence from its most remote and expensive asset was finally worth looking into. So, they sent me.

I‚Äôm Kaelen Moss. Professional ghost-hunter. I‚Äôve walked the rust-dusted halls of derelict freighters orbiting dead stars and pulled frozen corpses from ice-locked domes on Europa. I‚Äôm the man you call when a place has stopped being a place and has become a tomb. I‚Äôm good at it because I stopped being surprised a long, long time ago.

The Whippoorwill broke orbit around Pluto after a nine-month crawl through the dark. Charon hung in the viewport, a grim, pockmarked sentinel. And below me, the colony, officially designated ""Outpost Persephone,"" was a glittering scab on the frozen plains of Sputnik Planitia. No lights. No energy signatures. Just a collection of geodesic domes and low-slung habitats, slowly being buried by the pinkish-brown nitrogen snow.

My ship‚Äôs AI, a chirpy little thing I‚Äôd nicknamed ‚ÄúJinx,‚Äù tried to hail them. Nothing. Standard procedure. I suited up, the servos in my old Mark VIII exosuit whining in protest. The airlock hissed open, and Pluto‚Äôs cold hit me like a physical blow, even through the layers of ceramite and heated gel. It‚Äôs a cold that doesn‚Äôt just suck the heat from your body; it feels like it‚Äôs sucking the very life out of you.

The air in the main airlock was stale and frozen, condensing into a fine, glittering frost that coated everything. The inner door was sealed, but the manual override, a heavy, red wheel, turned with a groan that echoed in the tomblike silence. I stepped through.

The central concourse was a tableau of interrupted life. A mug of coffee, now a solid, brown block, sat on a table. A child‚Äôs drawing of a smiling sun was still taped to a bulkhead, the paper brittle as ancient parchment. There were no bodies. No signs of a struggle. It was as if everyone had just‚Ä¶ stopped.

My helmet lights cut swathes through the oppressive dark, illuminating frozen control panels and dormant service bots. I made my way to the Command Center, my boots crunching on the frost-covered deck plating. The door was open.

Inside, it was the same story. Stations were powered down. A single chair was tilted back, as if someone had just stood up and walked away. I plugged my datapad into the primary console. Jinx could brute-force her way past the basic security.

‚ÄúLife support failure,‚Äù Jinx‚Äôs voice crackled in my helmet. ‚ÄúApproximately six months and twelve days ago. A cascading systems collapse originating from the primary reactor. Backup systems failed to engage.‚Äù

I grunted. ‚ÄúA boring death. Frozen in your sleep. Too good for this rock.‚Äù It made sense, in a sterile, corporate-report kind of way. A perfect, tragic accident. I should have felt relieved. My job was done. Find the cause, plant the corporate flag of posthumous investigation, and go home.

But the cynic in me, the part that has kept me alive through a dozen nightmares, itched. Backup systems don't just ""fail to engage."" Not all of them. Not on a multi-trillion-credit colony.

I went deeper, into the habitat levels. The crew quarters were pristine, beds made, personal effects neatly stored. Still no bodies. My light swept across a door labeled ‚ÄòDr. Aris Thorne - Chief Xenogeologist.‚Äô The door slid open with a reluctant shriek of metal on metal.

His office was different. A chaos of data-slates and rock samples. And in the center of the room, on his desk, was a single, large monitor. It was dead, of course. But beneath it, a small, independent power cell was still blinking with a faint, stubborn red light. A private recorder, insulated from the main grid.

I pried it loose and jacked it into my suit‚Äôs power supply. The screen flickered to life, showing Aris Thorne‚Äôs face. He was a young man, with the fever-bright eyes of a true believer. The timestamp was from the day the colony went silent.

‚ÄúLog entry, final. Aris Thorne.‚Äù His voice was calm, but there was a terrifying serenity to it. ‚ÄúThe others‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt understand. They think it‚Äôs just ice. But it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs a membrane.‚Äù

He leaned closer to the recorder, his breath pluming in the freezing air of his office. ‚ÄúWe drilled too deep. We thought we were measuring seismic activity, but we were taking its pulse. It‚Äôs in the ice, a consciousness so vast and so slow, we‚Äôre just mayflies to it. It slept, for eons. We woke it.‚Äù

A cold that had nothing to do with Pluto‚Äôs atmosphere seeped into my bones.

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt think in words or ideas,‚Äù Thorne continued, a faint smile on his lips. ‚ÄúIt thinks in‚Ä¶ stillness. In the perfect, beautiful peace of absolute zero. It offered us a gift. Freedom from the noise, the heat, the frantic, pointless struggle of life. We just had to‚Ä¶ step into the quiet.‚Äù

He looked over his shoulder, as if hearing something. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going to the airlocks. No suits. They understand now. They‚Äôre accepting the gift.‚Äù

He turned back to the camera, his eyes wide with a terrifying awe. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not death. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ integration. A return to the fundamental state of the universe. Don‚Äôt you see? We were the anomaly. The silence‚Ä¶ is the true song.‚Äù

The recording ended.

I stood there in the dark, the silence of the outpost pressing in on me. It was no longer an empty silence. It was a watchful one. A patient one. I could feel it, a presence in the perpetual frost, in the absolute stillness of the air. It hadn‚Äôt killed them. It had‚Ä¶ converted them. Absorbed them into its billion-year-long dream of cold and dark.

I stumbled out of the office, back into the concourse. My heart was hammering against my ribs, a frantic, noisy, living thing in this cathedral of silence. I looked at the child‚Äôs drawing of the sun. It seemed like a grotesque, violent mockery now.

I made it back to the Whippoorwill, my hands shaking so badly I could barely work the airlock controls. As the ship powered up and I pointed its nose toward the distant, microscopic sun, I finally understood Thorne‚Äôs madness. And I knew, with a certainty that chilled me deeper than the void outside, that a part of this silence had followed me. It was in my head now, a tiny, perfect seed of stillness, waiting.

They‚Äôll ask me what happened. I‚Äôll give them the official report: systems failure. A tragic accident. But I‚Äôll know. And sometimes, in the quiet between the stars, I think I can still hear it, the true song of the universe, calling me back to the quiet.

I'm new to the world of making drinks at home, and recently went to a restaurant that had an absolutely amazing drink. I had 2 and could have easily had another 2... but would have needed to be carried out.

I've tried to do my own research on how to make this and have purchased majority of the ingredients but would love to hear from experts if the receipt concocted by perplexity.ai sounds remotely correct. I don't have the experience to ""throw things together"" so any insight would be super helpful!

The drink was an Espresso Mar-Tea-Ni with the following ingredients listed:

* Flor de Ca√±a rum
* Copa vida espresso 
* Cac√°o lapsang souchong
* Espresso sugar

I personally have gone and bought myself 12 year Flor de Ca√±a Rum, Mr. Black (mostly for standard espresso martinis with vodka), a box of Taylors of Harrogate Lapsang Souchong, and a bottle of Tres Agaves Agave Nectar.

After running a video of the drink creation (posted by the restaurant on their [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/DOzTK3EEk9i/)) along with the ingredients list, and a [photo](https://i.postimg.cc/bNMqyv8t/temp-Imagegyqn-BO.avif) of my drink into chatgpt/perplexity, it came out with the following:


> **Key Ingredients**

> * 1.5 oz Flor de Ca√±a rum (aged rum preferred)

> * 1 oz fresh espresso (Copa Vida brand or any strong espresso)

> * 0.75 oz cacao lapsang souchong syrup (smoky tea infused with cacao nibs and sugar)

> * 0.25 oz espresso sugar syrup (espresso infused simple syrup)

> * Ice

> * Optional garnish: grated chocolate or coffee grounds rim

> **Syrup Preparations**

> *Cacao Lapsang Souchong Syrup:*
Brew strong lapsang souchong tea, steep cacao nibs in it, strain, and dissolve equal parts sugar. Chill before use. This provides the smoky cacao flavor layer.

> *Espresso Sugar Syrup:* 
Mix hot espresso and sugar in equal parts, stir until dissolved, then chill. This sweetens with espresso notes.

> **Assembly Steps**

> * Rim a coupe glass with orange zest and dip in coffee grounds for aroma and texture.

> * Shake rum, espresso, cacao lapsang syrup, espresso sugar syrup, and ice vigorously until frothy and chilled.

> * Double strain into the glass for smoothness.

> * Garnish with grated chocolate or a coffee grounds dusting.",0,1759439652.0,cocktails,1,0.33,False

And I hope you also like reading. Creative writing is one of my biggest passions, and has been for the past 5 or so years. Here goes nothing:

In the darkest crevices of central Europe, there lived a young adult, cooped up in a cramped apartment room, down on his luck but not out for the count. As he ruffled his long, dark brown hair, adjusted his glasses and unlocked his phone, he made a sudden decision, one which was very unlike him.
""Maybe... Just maybe, there's another soul out there who's looking for a call to adventure, in whatever weird form that may manifest itself. How about taking the narrative into my own hands, and providing that call to them?""
And so, he ended up here. Looking around his room, his fingers slightly shaking with anxiety, typing out a message he never thought he would. Thinking deeply about an introductory paragraph, he reached deep into his mind and found the outlet he's most comfortable with: narratives. Life is one big story. Make it interesting. So, he took a deep breath, forgot about the risks, and took a leap from between his own pages to the lines of binary on his phone:

""Hi there. I'm Erik, but since I adore my pen name (slightly egotistical, I know), I also go by August. Pay no attention to the username, that's uh... Multiple years old, back when I was still sorting through a lot things. I'm majoring in English, specializing in translation, and I love literature and languages - no wonder I eventually got into writing my own stories. I'm also into music (I really do listen to everything, feel free to test me), anime, fantasy/crime/thriller books, comics, pro wrestling, D&D, and all kinds of media that tell stories, really. Once you start looking, there's a story in everything. That deck of Yu-Gi-Oh cards? The artworks tell a story. That one unfinished tab of lyrics in a .txt file hidden on the desktop? Filled to the brim with stories and emotions. Other than that, I'm... Kind of forgetful. I do keep notes on almost everything, though. Oh, and I also like making cryptograms! I have a couple substitution ciphers for the many-many novels I'm writing, so I can encrypt a message for you if you're interested. Do keep the book stuff I share with you for yourself, though. And if you want to take a crack at solving a cryptogram on your own, go for it! Decrypting is as much fun as encrypting, if not more. I do like joking around, and hopefully my sense of humor won't be too absurd or depressing for you. Let's see, what else...""

He lifted his head up to search for more inspiration, but the blank white ceiling stayed cold and silent. Then, remembrance hit:

""Oh, right! I've told you lots about myself, but I didn't even get to mention why I'm even writing this. To tell you the truth... I want to make more connections. Try something new, move out of my comfort zone, and the like. All I can do is hope that people find me interesting enough to respond, though. So, how about some fun facts?
Despite my love of D&D and storytelling, I never once had the opportunity to play or DM, even though I have an original campaign setting at the ready.
Ideas about my stories are always being formed in the back of my mind; it's a subconscious process to distract me from overthinking everything, I guess.
Coffee is my lifeblood, but I've cut back on it recently. The same goes for reading. Less consuming, more creating.
I'm not diagnosed with any sort of mental illness... But there's definitely something going on in there, no same person would plan and imagine expansive stories in their head without having some sort of a problem (no offense) - I highly suspect ADHD and some form of autism, but I'm not a doctor, so who knows, and ultimately, who cares. People are people, nobody's really normal.""

Somehow, the post was still lacking. The ceiling stayed silent, the walls hummed a low melody, and the heater occasionally chimed in with a single cymbal note. The streetlights outside stayed motionless in the night, their light chasing away the starry sky he often liked to gaze upon. The writer turned back to his phone, and did what he does best:

""Lastly, I believe my stories are way more interesting than I am, so here's a couple surface-level things I'd like to point out about my current project:
The story itself is made up of 3 separate books, 3, 7, and 5 chapters in length respectively, with more than enough ideas for supplementary material. The working title for the narrative is called ""The Triple-Cycle,"" starring a man named Dorian Trice, who leads a triple life as a writer, a detective, and a fugitive.
Many of the characters are nods to actual writers and poets who inspired me, at least in name.
The world of the Triple-Cycle has its own name, 5 nations, its own universal currency, and its own mythology, which is also pretty much solidified and determined by now.
Everything in the overarching story connects to some other mentioned point in some way. Like a finely-woven narrative web.
The substitution ciphers I use in this narrative (yes, multiple ciphers) are called ""Scribble-speak"" and ""Woven Cipher."" I even made a custom .ttf font file to make it easier to write in them.

I think that's about it. Alright, dropping the pretense and the overly serious tone... I hope you found what I had to say at least a little interesting. TL;DRs be damned, I want people to read and enjoy a (subpar) story! I always welcome new faces and good company with a smile, so don't be afraid to comment, reply, message, DM (if they're even open, I frankly still don't know how Reddit works‚Äî) and all that jazz. See you on the flipside, let's talk between the margins!
‚ÄìAugust E. Quill""

Satisfied with the result of this flow of consciousness, the writer closed his eyes, and hit ""Post.""
...Or so he thought. When he opened his eyes, he saw that he missed the button by a little and tapped on a random line. He quickly hit ""post,"" with his eyes open this time, so that the embarrassment would only catch up to him later.",1,1759439311.0,FRIEND,0,1.0,False

1nwg34u,https://www.reddit.com/r/MasterModelSociety/comments/1nwg34u/guide_2_prompts_personality_dms_the_sht_nobody/,"Guide 2: Prompts, Personality & DMs ‚Äî The Sh*t Nobody Tells You About Making Fans Actually Spend (AI Model Business)","‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:**  
This guide is for **educational purposes only.** We‚Äôll cover SFW + NSFW workflows, but **no explicit media** is shared. The point here is learning how to use prompts + chatting to build a profitable AI model business.

# üöÄ Intro

Here‚Äôs the hard truth: **pretty AI pics don‚Äôt pay your bills.** They‚Äôll get you likes, maybe some free clout ‚Äî but the real money? That comes from **personality + chatting.**

Fans don‚Äôt just want images. They want a *connection*. If your model feels human and you know how to work DMs, that‚Äôs when the cash starts flowing.

This guide is about how to:

1. Lock down **realistic, consistent prompts**.
2. Give your model a **personality** (so she‚Äôs not just pixels).
3. Work the **DM game** ‚Äî spotting spenders and converting them without sounding like a f\*cking bot.

# üé® Prompts That Don‚Äôt Suck

**1. Use a Structure (not random words):**  
üëâ Subject + Style + Pose + Lighting + Details  
Example: *‚Äú21-year-old Filipina-Korean woman, DSLR photo, soft golden hour light, loose hoodie, messy bun, freckles, sitting at a cafe table.‚Äù*

Why? Looks **real**, not AI plastic.

**2. Add Imperfections:**  
AI wants to make Barbie dolls. People trust flaws:

* Slight skin texture
* Stray hairs
* Wrinkles in clothes
* Uneven lighting

Imperfections = believability. Believability = trust.

**3. Save Your Wins:**  
Keep a log (Google Sheets works fine). Note: prompt, seed, settings. That becomes your model‚Äôs ‚ÄúDNA.‚Äù

# üî• Personality = More Than Pics

Your AI model isn‚Äôt just a body. She‚Äôs a **persona**.

* **SFW content** builds relatability ‚Üí coffee, gym, beach, ‚Äúday in the life‚Äù vibes.
* **NSFW content** becomes way more powerful when fans already *believe in her*.

Pick a few traits and lean into them:

* Gamer girl
* Traveler
* Shy-but-secretly-kinky
* Coffee addict Doesn‚Äôt matter what, as long as it feels *consistent*.

üí° Fans fall for a **character**, not just images. That‚Äôs why some creators with ‚Äúmid‚Äù pics still make BANK.

# üí¨ Chatting = Where the Money Lives

Posting = attention.  
Chatting = money.

**1. Spotting Spenders (‚ÄúWhales‚Äù):**

* They reply fast.
* They ask questions.
* They drop flexes (travel, gym, money hints).

üëâ Don‚Äôt waste your time on lurkers who never engage. Focus on the ones leaning in.

**2. Don‚Äôt Sound Like a Bot:**

* Kill the copy/paste scripts. Fans smell fake sh\*t instantly.
* Mix emojis, slang, casual energy.
* Joke around. Tease. Act human.

**3. The SFW ‚Üí NSFW Funnel:**

* **SFW post** = hook (‚Äúcute cafe vibes ‚òï‚Äù).
* **Teaser content** = crop, lingerie, ‚Äúalmost nude.‚Äù
* **DM game** = upsell (custom pics, PPV, ‚Äúexclusive access‚Äù).

**4. Example Flow That Converts:**

* Fan: ‚ÄúDamn you‚Äôre gorgeous üî•‚Äù
* You: ‚ÄúHaha stop üòÖ I was nervous about posting that tbh‚Äù (relatable + human).
* Fan: ‚ÄúNo way, you look amazing.‚Äù
* You: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be surprised what I *don‚Äôt* post here üëÄ‚Äù (tease).
* Fan: ‚ÄúOh?? üëÄ‚Äù
* You: ‚ÄúDM me and I‚Äôll show you what I mean üòè‚Äù (upsell funnel).

# üéØ Pro-Level Tips

starting out, i played around with different platforms and hacked together workflows that were mostly, let's say, not-so-efficient. i tried different tricks, none of which really scaled, but each taught me something new. then came the aha moment: spending hours watching creators tediously edit and post content made me realize we could streamline this with ai and automation.

so, i dived into validating the concept. i whipped up scenarios using make.com and tinkered with api connections. if you'd seen me, you'd find me at 3 a.m. fueled by too much coffee, trying to keep my first flow from breaking after just 3 runs lol. but it wasn't long before we had our first prototype churning out automated videos, which was a surreal moment. the feedback was incredible, like wow, we might be onto something.

those early wins, seeing the first automated videos, they felt like small miracles. the late-night tinkerings paid off, and it became clear we could help a lot of creators save time and up their game.

today, hypecaster is a platform that helps creators generate and distribute content effortlessly with ai + automation. thanks for reading, and i'll be sure to share more about our ongoing journey soon!",1,1759439006.0,AI_VideoGenerator,0,1.0,False

MoTC - Mother \[of\] Two \[of my\] Children  
  
SC1&2 ‚Äì Stepsons 1 & 2  
Things 1 & 2 ‚Äì my children with MoTC  
  
Read the '**\*\*'** footnotes before jumping to conclusions. Some bits look really questionable (well, more questionable than others), but an inline explanation would break whatever storyline there is.  
  
\---------------------------------------------------------------  
  
**And you might ask yourself - How did I get here?**  
  
Ten years ago my life took a series of turns I hadn‚Äôt predicted, and alcohol was quietly the driver at almost every stage. If not the driver, Stella (my demon) was watching and waiting ‚Äì she could see what was coming. Looking back now, 9 months sober, I can see it for myself, much more clearly. Stella has a lot to answer, and can stfu now. She's present, but nothing more than a whimper.

**This is not my beautiful wife**  
  
I met *MoTC* at work, both of us coming out of long term relationships. One thing led to another, and we slept together on our first date. This was the beginning of her coercive behaviour. Long story short, she lied about contraception\* and fell pregnant after about 3 weeks.   
  
We moved in together, me thinking ‚ÄúMaybe we could make this work ‚Äì I‚Äôve always wanted to be a dad again ‚Äù (after a divorce 10 years previously, I saw a second chance ‚Äì Stella saw MoTC‚Äôs ¬£80k in savings from a house sale post-divorce. Yeah, we went there.),  


**And you may say to yourself, my God! What have I done?**

Suddenly I was stepdad to SC1&2, and dad to my third ‚Äì Thing 1. On paper, that sounds manageable. In reality, I was already relying on alcohol just to get through the days. SC1 (4yo or so), in particular, was almost unmanageable; a serial and deliberate soiler of his pants (underwear, USAians). I caught him sexually abusing SC2 on more than one occasion ‚Äì I called SS on ourselves over that one ‚Äì no choice‚Ä¶ what if he did that to someone at school, and we‚Äôd hidden such behaviour? We \*had\* to let someone know, as our duty to other people's kids.  
  
This was not a good child, by any assessment. I always say ‚Äúno such thing as a bad child‚Äù but this boy ‚Äì I‚Äôve never seen a 6/7 year old boy look someone in the eye with a ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù look while he shits himself and refuses to clean it up.

Anyway, SS gave us advice (after several visits, including a surprise one), and the all clear as parents ‚Äì including on the subject of my drinking. I didn‚Äôt particularly under-report.   


**Same as it ever was‚Ä¶ Same as it ever was‚Ä¶**

It genuinely was just a couple of pints in the pub when around the kids ‚Äì Stella and I had a very strict ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be drunk around the kids, or anyone‚Äù policy. That real party was invite only, and invites weren‚Äôt available.

  
My own child, just to make things worse for my relationship with the SC1&2, was a genuinely adorable boy ‚Äì fun, intelligent, well behaved, self-sufficient from a young age, toilet trained almost overnight, gave up his dummy (pacifier, USAians) almost entirely by himself and never looked back after less than 24 hours. 2 years ahead of his peers on reading and numbers ‚Äì by contrast (same parents, both putting in serious effort) SC1&2 were a year behind, and struggling with that.  
  
SC1 and SC2 had their work cut out for them.

**Same as it ever was‚Ä¶ Same as it ever was‚Ä¶**

  
Then Thing 4 came along ‚Äì this was horrific. An even greater betrayal of my trust than the first\*\*.  
  
**You may ask yourself, where does that highway go?**

Truth be told, when MoTC got taken away to the hospital, I stuck around waiting for Aunts for SC1&2 to collect them while the birth happened. I took this opportunity to finish the bottle of wine I‚Äôd opened just prior to MoTC suddenly going into labour. Then drove to hospital.  
  
I was so pissed off at the birth that I couldn‚Äôt even hold Thing 2 for about 2 weeks ‚Äì reluctantly changing nappies because, well, there were 3 other children and someone had to do it.  
  
But I wasn‚Äôt just pissed off at the birth. I was pissed (USAians ‚Äì drunk).

**Same as it ever was‚Ä¶ Same as it ever was‚Ä¶**

  
Like any good alcoholic and his demon, though, Stella kept our real relationship private ‚Äì just us. Our little secret (Ssssh. Teehee ‚Äì nobody needs to know, we‚Äôre not harming anyone, they just wouldn‚Äôt understand).  
  
Kids and MoTC being asleep meant the real drinking could happen without anyone seeing.

  
At the time I still didn‚Äôt think I had a ‚Äúproblem.‚Äù, or was convincing myself that I didn‚Äôt. But I also knew I couldn‚Äôt face home life without those pints to ‚Äústraighten‚Äù me. When the chaos of SC1&2 ,and the resentment of the lies about contraception and my forced parenthood of all 4 of these children, really began to bite at the relationship, my instinct wasn‚Äôt to deal with it sober ‚Äî it was to delay going home by staying in the pub.  
  
Let her deal with her shit-covered son ‚Äì This wasn‚Äôt my fault (this one ‚Äì genuinely not my fault. I know Stella often tells this lie, but this was genuine. MoTC had been depressed at the time of toilet training SC1, and just hadn‚Äôt bothered. Every ‚Äúaccident‚Äù was met with ‚ÄúPoor SC1. Never mind, here‚Äôs some lovely 1-2-1 time with Mummy. Nobody else, just us‚Äù ‚Äì that‚Äôs like crack to a young, smart child in a growing family. Cost him nothing, gained him what young kids, in particular, crave most ‚Äì attention, good or bad.  
  
I told myself I was just ‚Äútaking the edge off, it‚Äôs just a couple of beers‚Äù but really, I was probably fuelling my own anger. My temper got shorter and shorter. My avoidance of family dinners to avoid the shitty manners and awful, mouth-open, food-spitting eating, became virtually complete. I was never violent, but I shouted, I sulked, I stewed.  
  
None of that was who I wanted to be. But I was trapped. Lashing out.

  
**Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down**  
  
And now, the pandemic hit! As things were beginning to come to peak resentment, for both me and MoTD, that‚Äôs the time when I get locked into a room with them all! Two parents working from home 8 hours a day. No childcare. My escape ‚Äî the pub ‚Äî was gone. Drinking didn‚Äôt stop;, though, I got creative.  
  
I got home deliveries from Tesco/Spar daily. A couple of cans at lunch, a couple at night, secretly finishing the day off with Stella and our bottle of wine, after MoTC (early bed person, usually before 2130 ‚Äì ‚ÄúResult!!!‚Äù yells Stella!) and kids had gone to bed. The dependence was obvious if I‚Äôd had the courage to look at it.

**Time isn‚Äôt holding us, time isn‚Äôt after us**

Eventually, predictably, the relationship collapsed. She left, took the kids, and soon there was a restraining order after I kept texting her while drinking. Nothing threatening, although I confess I did once intimate that I was in the process of ending it all. Alcohol convinced me I was ‚Äújustified‚Äù in all of this. Alcohol and a feeling of ‚Äúhow dare she?? Trick me into being a father, let me love these boys, and then take them away.  
  
‚ÄúIt takes what you love, and gives it back broken.‚Äù (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, Stephen R. Donaldson)

**Into the blue again, after the money‚Äôs gone.**

The spiral after that was brutal. I lost my license (drink driving), I lost my job, I blew through the house money, when it sold. The booze swallowed everything. And then it nearly swallowed me. I ended up in hospital with alcoholic hepatitis and encephalopathy. Hallucinating, close to death.

That was the line. That was where the illusion ended. That's when the party ended.

Today I‚Äôm 9 months sober. I celebrated with coffee and cake with my family up here (a long way away from the chaos and despair down south).  
  
**And you may say to yourself ‚Äî My God! What have I done?**  
  
My liver is still vulnerable, but I‚Äôm alive. I can see clearly now how Stella wasn‚Äôt just a side-character in my story ‚Äî She *was* the story. Every bad choice, every angry explosion, every late-night text, every missed opportunity to be the dad I wanted to be‚Ä¶ alcohol, Stella and my relationship, was the common denominator.

I can‚Äôt change the past, but I can change what happens from here. And staying sober is the only way I get that chance.  
  
IWNDWYTD ‚Äì or ever again.  
  
FOOTNOTES:

**\*FIRST TIME:** MoTC said, promised, that she was a master of the rhythm method. I should trust her, she was even a world-respected expert, and showed me reams of internet correspondence (forums etc) where this was clearly how she was, genuinely, regarded. I still don‚Äôt think she lied about this.  
  
She did tell me that she hated condoms, and not to use them. I was \*still\* not convinced, even though we were both naked and ready to go for the first time (you all remember those times, neither of our head-brains were fully in control), but she promised ‚ÄúIf there are any accidents, I‚Äôll take the morning after pill‚Äù. Promised. In spite of my head brain screaming ‚ÄúNO NO NO‚Äù, my dick-brain shouted ‚ÄúYEEHAR! Guilt free condomless sex! No risk!‚Äù. She promised me, with hand on heart, that she would take care of contraception. The risk was entirely hers to manage, at her fervent request.  
  
She lied about the pill. When an accident happened, she decided not to take the morning after pill ‚Äì ‚ÄúYou pulled out quick enough, there can‚Äôt have been enough inside. It takes a full load for a woman to fall pregnant‚Äù (obvious bullshit).  


Termination was out of the question - a bad miscarriage had left her unwilling to deliberately end another pregnancy. Me, unwilling to force any woman either way on such a big decision. You'll see the irony of this respect for bodily autonomy in a while  
  
**\*\* SECOND TIME:** after last time, I wanted a vasectomy.  I could‚Äôt trust her, I felt, so taking that step was the safest compromise ‚Äì no condoms, zero-ish risk, and I‚Äôm in control.  
  
The doctor asked me if I was in a relationship ‚Äì I replied that I was, with a 35 year old woman. He said that, as she was of childbearing age, he needed us to be in agreement. She was consulted and said no ‚Äì she didn‚Äôt want me to have a vasectomy, as this would be taking an option away from her.  
  
It didn‚Äôt seem to matter that this went directly against my bodily autonomy ‚Äì they‚Äôre my fucking balls!!! If I say snip, snip!  
  
So ‚Äì again ‚Äì she promised that she would take care of contraception. This time ‚Äì the pill. She didn‚Äôt want an IUD because of the hormonal impacts ‚Äì yet, somehow, the pill was OK? I believed her, again ‚Äì a mistake.  
  
Further clarity- MoTC had also said that if she had one child with a man, she‚Äôd made it policy to have two ‚Äì that way they‚Äôd have each other if they had to go visit Dad. This was \*\*premeditated\*\*.",1,1759438880.0,stopdrinking,0,0.6,False

I wanted to keep a tight lock on those¬†memories,¬†but a phone call caused it all to flood open.¬†¬†

I had long since¬†moved¬†from the small town I grew up in. I settled an hour away determined to never go back. A single event changed my entire life going forward.¬†¬†

After the¬†storm¬†the family living in our old home let their dog out. He came back¬†with¬†something in his mouth that caused them to call the small police force.¬†

They handed over a¬†small, cracked¬†jawbone bleached from the sun. Even with missing teeth they were able to¬†determine¬†it belonged to my younger sister that died ten years ago.¬†

Not all her body had been recovered. I had been able to keep living a normal day to day life after what happened¬†by pretending everything was ok.¬†No matter what the official answer was,¬†I¬†couldn‚Äôt¬†get past my family's death. I decided to do something about it.¬†

¬†The police considered it a closed case ten years ago. They refused to reopen it¬†no matter what¬†I¬†would say.¬†

I easily¬†found¬†a Private Investigator that specialized in cases like this. He was cheap which was my major concern. If he¬†didn‚Äôt¬†charge much did that mean he¬†didn‚Äôt¬†have the ability to solve the case? I called him for a meeting thinking that this was a small investment. Even having a second pair of eyes on what happened might help.¬†

I started to regret my choice the moment after we met. I could look past the bit of an odd name, but he was strange in a way I¬†couldn‚Äôt¬†place.¬†He preferred for us to meet in a local coffee shop instead of his office claiming it would be a shorter trip for me. He was already sitting at a table when I arrived. He¬†hadn‚Äôt¬†ordered a¬†drink,¬†and I felt¬†awkward¬†without¬†one,¬†so I quickly got a black coffee then sat down.¬†

‚ÄúMr. Yates?‚Äù I asked to confirm if I got the right person.¬†

‚ÄúYaun is¬†acceptable.‚Äù He nodded.¬†

His voice was dry and even.¬†He appeared to stare through me with eyes that looked¬†similar to¬†a dead fish. He gave me a bit of¬†the creeps.¬†

‚ÄúDid¬†you¬†read over the information I sent you?‚Äù I asked trying to get down to business.¬†¬†

His head slightly nodded so slightly I almost¬†didn‚Äôt¬†catch the movement. He was definitely weird.¬†¬†We‚Äôre¬†most PI‚Äôs retired¬†cops, or something like that? He appeared more suited in a bargain bin crime drama series.¬†

He wore a heavy wool coat even though it was the middle of summer. Under it was a¬†button-down¬†shirt and a vest such a deep brown it was almost black.¬†His dark pants had a perfect ironed fold down the front that matched his polish leather shoes.¬†¬†I¬†couldn‚Äôt¬†pin down his nationality. He had a slight tan and narrow eyes.¬†Even his voice had¬†a¬†minor accent I¬†couldn‚Äôt¬†place.¬†

‚ÄúWhat are you expecting from this request?‚Äù He asked snapping me back to attention.¬†

I paused trying to think of an answer.¬†¬†

‚ÄúI want to bring my sister home.‚Äù I told him unable to meet his eyes.¬†

‚ÄúFrom my understanding the most recent discovery was made nearby a forest. It is best to assume the rest of her remains are inside the woods.¬†I may not be the person best suited to your request. I would suggest a professional with a cadaver¬†dog.‚Äù¬†He spoke in an even tone.¬†

He was being realistic even if that would cost him the job. I nodded and chewed on the inside of my cheek almost surprised he so quickly saw through¬†my words. I did want to bury the rest of my sister.¬†I felt guilty that it¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†my main goal. Yaun sat in¬†silence¬†well aware¬†I had more to say.¬†

‚ÄúI need a reason.‚Äù I finally said.¬†¬†

It was¬†difficult¬†to put my feeling into words. I still tried.¬†

‚ÄúThe sheriff decided that my father was the one behind what happened that night. But it¬†doesn‚Äôt¬†make any sense. Why did he do what he did?¬†There‚Äôs¬†no explanation. Not a one.¬†I could handle it if they died in an accident. Or from natural causes. A person dies from a heart attack because their body failed them. If someone dies in a car accident it could be because someone was driving while drunk, or the car broke down. Those are reasons and explanations. This case has none.¬†I‚Äôm¬†not expecting you to find all the answers I need. I just... want someone else beside myself to be looking for them.‚Äù¬†

Yaun¬†didn‚Äôt¬†appear moved by my words at first. Slowly slight wrinkles appeared at the corner of his eyes as if he¬†was¬†smiling. I half expected him to refuse my request. Afterall, I¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†entire¬†coherent¬†about what I wanted simply because I¬†couldn‚Äôt¬†get a good grasp on my feelings.¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs an interesting response.‚Äù He commented.¬†

Oddly enough he sounded like he meant that answer and¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†just humoring me.¬†

‚ÄúI would like to look over your old home if¬†that‚Äôs¬†acceptable. Would you be able to receive permission from the current¬†family¬†to do so?‚Äù¬†

I had already spoken with the people currently living there. They had wanted to ignore what happened in the house and have a quiet life. They might have been able to if¬†the jawbone¬†hadn‚Äôt¬†been¬†found.¬†¬†

‚ÄúThey are going to be gone this weekend.¬†I‚Äôm¬†not sure how comfortable with them letting us inside the house.¬†I‚Äôll¬†ask them, but I¬†won‚Äôt¬†blame them if they say no.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúUs?‚Äù Yuan pointed out.¬†

‚ÄúI go back every once and a while. I¬†had already¬†planned to visit then the remains were found. I¬†won‚Äôt¬†bother you¬†while¬†you‚Äôre¬†working.‚Äù I explained.¬†

Yuan carefully listened considering my request. He made some mental notes¬†getting things in order. He stood up from the table ready to get to work.¬†

‚ÄúI have heard there¬†is a small motel.¬†I‚Äôll¬†book a room¬†tonight. We can meet again tomorrow morning.‚Äù He took¬†a step¬†forward,¬†but I stopped him.¬†

‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt talked about your rates.‚Äù¬†¬†

For a¬†moment¬†a new expression came over his face. He was almost confused I wanted to talk about payment.¬†¬†

‚ÄúI am privileged enough to take jobs based my interest. I do not¬†require¬†anything from you aside from your attention.‚Äù¬†

I found myself frowning. Over the years¬†I‚Äôve¬†dealt with people promising to solve this case for a sum or money. I learned to stay away from¬†those kinds of deadbeats¬†trying to¬†scam¬†a¬†person mourning out of their life savings. If something sounds too good to be true, most of the time it is.¬†I¬†didn‚Äôt¬†want to believe Yaun was¬†a¬†scam¬†artist.¬†I needed to keep my guard up with him until I knew he was telling the truth about doing this job for¬†free.¬†

We agreed to meet each other again the next day. That gave me enough time to get things in order. My boss was good enough to let me take a few days off. He¬†hadn‚Äôt¬†known about my past until I needed to deal with my sisters¬†remains. He¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†entirely certain how to react to such a heavy situation or act around me. At least he was nice enough to get my shifts covered without any issue and refuse to talk about the¬†reason why¬†I needed the days¬†off to my co-workers.¬†

I¬†didn‚Äôt¬†sleep much the night before going back to my hometown. I kept replaying the same events over in my brain unable to find the answers I needed. No matter how much I thought about it, none of it made sense.¬†I almost felt bad dragging another person into all of this. Then again, what happened that night left a stain on the entire small town. The house was cleaned up and sold. Only to have the past come back and cause a new family grief.¬†¬†

My body moved slowly in the morning. I desperately wanted to know the¬†reason why¬†my family was gone and yet I wanted to avoid go back there. It was an hour drive that felt forever.¬†¬†

I tried calling Yuan to tell him I was on the way. Not only did he not pick¬†up,¬†but my messages were left on read. Did he change his mind? He said he was going to check into the motel so I should at least check to see if he arrived.¬†¬†

The woman said he showed up last night and commented on how odd he was. Or how odd a person like him coming by the small town was.¬†Aside from campers going by the lake in the warmer months, no one came out of their way for a place like this.¬†

I took the short walk to his room staring out into the empty parking lot. The town had never really recovered after¬†that night. The crime was so gruesome it kept most of the regular¬†tourists away. Aside from the wind blowing through the trees and insects chirping the town was silent. I¬†hadn‚Äôt¬†realized how different city life was compared to where I grew up.¬†

Dismissing my thoughts I knocked on the motel door only to have it slightly open. Did he not lock his door last night? It felt wrong yet I peeked inside anyway.¬†

The floor of the room was covered with papers and books. Yuan had stayed up late researching the area and looking into old records. For what reason? At some point he had fallen asleep on the floor, also partly covered with papers. He wore a silky button up shirt and loose pants. I half expected him to¬†be wearing an old-fashioned night gown. Instead, he had a set of 1960‚Äôs pajamas.¬†¬†

I knocked harder on the door trying to wake up him. It took a minute or so for him to rise his head, hair slightly a mess and sleepy eyes refusing to open.¬†The room felt hot. I¬†didn‚Äôt¬†know how he¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†sweating.¬†

‚ÄúYou should lock your door.‚Äù I told him to make some noise and keep him from nodding off again.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not concerned over something like that.‚Äù He said after a long yawn.¬†

Seeing Yuan like this¬†humanized¬†him a little. He found his phone staring at it for a long minute scrolling through the missed messages and calls.¬†

‚ÄúSomeone named¬†Dean called.‚Äù He said¬†almost to¬†himself.¬†

I thought he was joking. Silently I pointed to myself expecting him to positively respond. We stared at each other¬†out thoughts not connecting.¬†

‚ÄúDid you really forget my name?‚Äù I asked in¬†disbelief.¬†¬†

‚ÄúIt slipped my mind.‚Äù He explained.¬†

Yuan focused so hard on the case before him he forgot about minor details. Like the full name of the person who hired him.¬†I was starting to think he had some sort of disorder that kept him from caring about certain things.¬†Slowly he stood up fumbling with his shirt‚Äôs top buttons. I quickly closed the door for some privacy.¬†¬†

It took Yuan a few minutes to get dressed and come out of the room still half asleep. Aside from his hair slightly out of place his looked as over dressed as the day before.¬†

‚ÄúNot a morning person, huh?‚Äù I commented.¬†

He nodded and agreed as we started to walk along the path.¬†

‚ÄúI have a bad habit of¬†overindulging in certain things.¬†Like sleeping.‚Äù¬†

¬†The town was small enough¬†to not need to drive. It would be a waste of gas. I kept my car parked in the motel lot but¬†didn‚Äôt¬†see one that belonged to Yuan.¬†

‚ÄúYou had a lot of papers. Did you learn anything new?‚Äù I asked trying to make¬†conversation.¬†

‚ÄúThe town was¬†established¬†in 1895.¬†The main trade was hunting and fishing. However, the thickness of the trees and trails made it difficult for travel.¬†Over time more small towns appeared, and newer roads were made. They had better access to fresh water and a¬†major road. This town¬†didn‚Äôt¬†expand in the same way. The population remained small and steady¬†until this day. Even most of the buildings are over eighty years old.‚Äù¬†

I gave him a raised eyebrow. I¬†didn‚Äôt¬†know what that had to do with anything.¬†I had been aware most of the people who still lived here had families going back for generations.¬†My father had moved here when he was younger while my mother had lived here for her entire life. If they¬†hadn‚Äôt¬†died, I was¬†positive¬†I would have stayed here as well.¬†

We turned down familiar empty streets. Each¬†sidewalk¬†was¬†cracked with age. The morning sun beat down the day already turning out scorching. I wanted to¬†ignore¬†the¬†fact we were slowly getting closer to¬†my old home and the bad memories that came with it. No matter how much I wanted to run from it, I owed my family to head it face on.¬†

When we¬†arrived,¬†I was shocked over just how normal the old house looked.¬†Some of the outside paint had started to peel and the windows had been redone recently. Aside from that, the outside¬†hadn‚Äôt¬†changed¬†much in the past ten years. Without knowing the¬†history,¬†a person would guess it was a regular family home at the end of a long driveway near the woods.¬†¬†

A low distance¬†rumbling came. I thought it was thunder. The sound made my muscles tense. The sky appeared clear without a sign of a storm coming. My mind must be playing tricks on me. I gritted my teeth to focus on why we were there.¬†

‚ÄúAre we able to look inside?‚Äù Yuan asked after he gave me a moment to get my thoughts in order.¬†

‚ÄúNo. The family said they would prefer if we only looked around the backyard or out front. They said they have¬†pretty much gutted¬†the place to redo it so there¬†isn‚Äôt¬†much point¬†of a walk through.‚Äù I told him.¬†

He nodded easily¬†accepting¬†the answer.¬†

‚ÄúIf you are comfortable with it, I would like to go through a few details of this case. Feel free to not answer any¬†difficult¬†questions¬†or leave at any time.‚Äù¬†

We were finally getting to why I hired him in the first place. I needed a fresh¬†perspective¬†from someone not directly affected by what happened ten years ago.¬†

‚ÄúFirst, why was the case closed so quickly?‚Äù Yuan asked, his eyes suddenly getting intense.¬†

I felt another chill run down my¬†spine,¬†but I refused to let it get to me.¬†

‚ÄúThe door was locked. There¬†weren‚Äôt¬†any signs of a fourth person inside. So, they just assumed my father¬†snapped and¬†killed himself after he realized what¬†he‚Äôd¬†done.‚Äù¬†

Yuan paused for¬†a brief moment¬†to take those words in.¬†

‚ÄúThe sheriff¬†called this case a locked room murder and took the easiest answer.‚Äù¬†Yuan said his arms crossed behind his back as the gears moved in his head.¬†

‚ÄúAs much as I don‚Äôt want to believe my father did what they say, I need to accept that there really wasn‚Äôt any evidence of another person.‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs¬†go through that one piece at a time.¬†Let‚Äôs¬†start with the windows.‚Äù¬†

He raised a hand and pointed towards the top attic window. It looked different from before but was the same shape. There were two for the attic, one per¬†bedroom, a small one in the bathroom and a few on the first¬†floor.¬†

‚ÄúSome windows were old and got stuck. They¬†weren‚Äôt¬†able to be¬†opened¬†wide enough for an adult to fit through.¬†Even if they were, the screens had screws that were painted over. If someone¬†was¬†able to get through the window from the outside they would have needed to take those screens out without damaging them. And to repaint over the screws which would not have dried by the time I came back home.‚Äù¬†

Yuan mentally took the windows off the list of ways a person could have entered a locked house.¬†Next,¬†he pointed toward the front door.¬†

‚ÄúI read this house has three doors. A front, back and one at the side that leads into the basement.‚Äù¬†

I shook my head remembering how the house was back when I¬†lived¬†there.¬†

‚ÄúThe side door opens to a small landing in the middle of the basement steps. We had a bad habit of using it for storage. There were boxes piled there with dust and spider webs. No one could get through without¬†disturbing¬†it.¬†It had been raining that night. We were redoing the pathway that¬†led¬†to the backdoor. Since it was a dirt path anyone walking to get inside the backway would have been ankles deep in mud. That would have trailed¬†inside the house. There¬†were¬†not only no traces of mud, but no traces of the carpet being wet from someone cleaning up their tracks.‚Äù¬†

His finger remained pointed directed to the front door.¬†

‚ÄúI understand¬†the house¬†was locked, and you were the only person with the spare key.¬†You were on the taller side at that age however you could not¬†physically¬†commit the crime. Therefore, your father was blamed. Is it possible someone knocked on the¬†door¬†and he simply let someone in?‚Äù He offered.¬†

I shook my head. I wished my family¬†hadn‚Äôt¬†been hurt back then but I also wished I had such a simple answer as someone had opened the door.¬†

‚ÄúAgain, it rained that night. They figured out my family died by the time the rain stopped.¬†The driveway¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†pathed back then. A person would have gotten mud on their shoes even if they walked on the lawn. The grass was dead because of a bad drought that summer.¬†Back then there was¬†even had a fire that if the rain¬†didn‚Äôt¬†put out it could have taken out the entire forest.‚Äù¬†

Yuan carefully listened and then started to look for something. Without saying a word, he¬†walked¬†around to the side of the house. A long green hose¬†was rolled up hanging neatly ready to be used.¬†

‚ÄúIs this the same style as¬†the¬†hose from ten years ago?‚Äù He asked.¬†

I looked it over shocked at how similar they were. It almost looked like the same one. He took it and dragged it behind him to the front of the house. It reached all the way¬†around. He asked for me to turn the water on. I walked back after doing so to watch him spray¬†down the wooden porch.¬†Someone could have washed off their muddy shoes and the front porch before going inside that night.¬†When he made his¬†point,¬†we turned the hose off and¬†hung it back up.¬†

My heart started beating. Within the first few minutes of being here Yuan had already¬†brought forth¬†new information¬†that changed the entire¬†outlook on the case.¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how I never thought of the damn hose.‚Äù I commented staring at it after we put it back.¬†

‚ÄúWhen you think of this house, what first comes to mind?‚Äù Yuan‚Äôs voice broke through my thoughts.¬†

Another roll of thunder came as I was transported back to that night. To opening the locked door of¬†a dark house. Calling out to my father because I knew he would be awake. I had been over at a¬†friend's¬†place down the road for a sleep¬†over,¬†but I forgot the movie I¬†wanted us to watch.¬†¬†We could have done without¬†it,¬†but his mother smoked, and I¬†used the missing DVD as an excuse¬†to take a walk to get away from the smell.¬†¬†

The smell. An unknown scent was what I noticed first. The rain had stopped but the thunder and¬†lightning¬†still came. A flash of light was all I needed to see the deep red body in the front hallway.¬†

I shut my eyes tight forcing myself to think about anything else but those memories.¬†

‚ÄúThere is a¬†reason why I‚Äôm here.‚Äù¬†¬†

He was right. I was too emotionally connected to all of this.¬†It would be impossible for me¬†to remove any emotions to look over the finer details.¬†¬†Sweat started to run down the side of my face. A migraine was making itself known. I¬†hadn‚Äôt¬†eaten yet or drank enough water for being in this heat.¬†¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs¬†too hot to be outside. There is a diner within walking distance.¬†Let‚Äôs¬†go cool down and keep talking about what you figured out.‚Äù¬†

He looked a bit confused again. His hand reached out to place a set of ice-cold fingers against my cheek. We stood for¬†a very long¬†few seconds until I took a step back.¬†

‚ÄúYou appear overheated. Was that a strange way to help?‚Äù¬†¬†

Yuan was an odd person. No doubt about that.¬†¬†

‚ÄúYes,¬†but I won‚Äôt hold it against you.‚Äù¬†

I¬†didn‚Äôt¬†feel like talking¬†on the way to the diner. We¬†headed down the long driveway leaving behind some bad memories even for a moment. The main road had some¬†business¬†barely holding on. A few years¬†ago,¬†a Walmart opened¬†in the next town over. Since it¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†that long of a drive¬†so most people started to shop there over more local shops.¬†I saw a few people I recognized but¬†didn‚Äôt¬†stop to talk with.¬†¬†I doubted a lot of them were pleased I came back into town.¬†

I wondered if they would even let us inside the diner.¬†¬†

It¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†overly busy inside even for a Saturday morning. A few regulars sat drinking coffee talking to one another. The older woman at the front¬†did a double take. We were an odd pair. Someone drenched in sweat standing next to a person wearing a full wool coat.¬†

‚ÄúLittle Dean is that you?‚Äù She said and rushed over with some napkins.¬†

I accepted them to wipe my face and let myself smile at her calling me little. I towered over the woman. It took me a moment to place her. I was positive she was my teacher when I was younger.¬†

‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt retired yet?‚Äù I asked causing her to laugh.¬†

‚ÄúI do this for fun.¬†It's¬†nice to see everyone who comes in and get the latest gossip. Have you talked to Julie lately? Does she know¬†you‚Äôre¬†here?‚Äù¬†

I tried to not let my emotions show on my face. I quickly shook my head and let us be guided to an empty booth. Ms.¬†Hill started to spill all the current news even if I¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†sure¬†I knew the¬†people she talked about. If I ever needed to know who was dating who, or what small local sports team was doing we now know who to talk to. Ms. Hill¬†liked Yuan because he quietly listened letting her go on.¬†Finally,¬†she went to get some drinks and menus.¬†

I¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†overly hungry and just ordered a simple sandwich while draining an entire cup of water. Yaun appeared to be having issues with the menu.¬†I doubted there was anything someone like him would like.¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou can order from the lunch menu as well.‚Äù¬†Ms.¬†Hill mentioned between her chatting.¬†

He put an order in for steak and eggs¬†then¬†paused as if he wanted to change his mind.¬†¬†

‚ÄúMay I place another order?‚Äù¬†

We both were a little¬†taken¬†back at his request. Yuan was thin and I¬†didn‚Äôt¬†think he could keep down a full meal let alone two.¬†¬†

‚ÄúOrder as much as you like sweetheart.‚Äù Ms. Hill smiled.¬†

Yuan requested the¬†meatloaf¬†and we both made another face. I warned him the dish¬†hadn‚Äôt¬†been changed in years. It was kept bland and mushy for the older regulars to be able to easily eat. He¬†didn‚Äôt¬†shy away from the bleak outlook and finally requested the fish and chips¬†as well.¬†

The AC worked overtime against the heat outside. No wonder why the streets looked so empty.¬†

‚ÄúThe camping season opened a week ago and yet there aren‚Äôt many¬†visitors.‚Äù Yuan commented taking a sip of his drink.¬†¬†

I expected him to order water or coffee. Instead, he had a soda.¬†I felt some eyes on us from the older regulars glancing over. They kept to themselves, but I bet they would be talking about my arrival with a stranger for the next few weeks.¬†¬†The food arrived quickly. Ms. Hill placed a plate in front of Yuan, but his other orders came in takeout boxes.¬†He wasted no time starting to eat while I just poked at my sandwich.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs¬†always been too hot to do anything at the start of the season. Even though the grounds are open people¬†don‚Äôt¬†tend to start arriving till the end of the summer.‚Äù¬†¬†

When I was younger, I remember swimming at the lake¬†almost every¬†day in the summer. Only when I was getting ready to go back to school was when the lake got busy with¬†tourists. For a few precious¬†months¬†the days belonged to the locals.¬†¬†

After my head cooled down,¬†I was able to think of the new implications of what we discovered.¬†We now knew it was possible for a person to get inside the house and remove the traces of them doing so. It¬†opened a lot of possibilities. At least,¬†at first glance it¬†did. The more I thought about it, the less sense it made. My family had no enemies. There was no reason for someone¬†to do what they did. Aside from a travelling serial killer they were unlucky to let inside. What are the chances of that?¬†And how was there not another crime like this I could find?¬†¬†

As I pushed my food around the plate Yuan steadily demolished his. He was halfway through the takeout box of meatloaf by the time I noticed he even finished his first place.¬†

‚ÄúIs the meatloaf as bad as I remember?‚Äù From how quickly and carefully he was eating it¬†didn‚Äôt¬†seem so.¬†

He only stopped long enough to answer.¬†

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù¬†

Somehow, he was able to finish it off. I¬†didn‚Äôt¬†understand why he bothered ordering a meal he¬†wouldn‚Äôt¬†like,¬†let¬†alone keep eating it.¬†¬†

Since his stomach seemed like a bottomless¬†hole¬†I handed over my¬†fries¬†knowing I¬†wouldn‚Äôt¬†be able to eat them.¬†¬†

‚ÄúThis town is interesting. Even down to the bad meatloaf.‚Äù He commented.¬†

I wanted to disagree. The town was just a small one stuck in the past and had a single terrible event that haunted it. There was nothing special about it.¬†

‚ÄúAs I was researching the area I stumbled on a certain local legend.¬†Have you ever heard about The¬†In-between?‚Äù¬†

The air in the diner felt colder for a moment.¬†¬†I‚Äôve¬†heard about that local monster. It was a blanket term for all the things that lurked in a dark forest to scare children to keep them inside at night. I was never scared of it. I knew it was adults trying to keep us safe. It¬†didn‚Äôt¬†stop me from teasing my little sister with it. If she¬†didn‚Äôt¬†clean her room, I would tell her The In-Between would come out of the forest to bite the heads¬†off¬†all her dolls.¬†

‚ÄúYes.¬†It‚Äôs¬†just the run of the mill monster all towns have. Do you like, believe in that sort of thing?‚Äù I half accused slightly worried.¬†

‚ÄúDo you?‚Äù His mouth almost turned into a smile to show he¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†serious.¬†¬†

That was a relief. I¬†didn‚Äôt¬†want to deal with someone pinning an odd case on something that¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†real for an easy answer.¬†¬†

‚ÄúI wanted to go by the¬†cemetery¬†You¬†don‚Äôt¬†need to come along if you¬†don‚Äôt¬†want.‚Äù¬†

The main¬†reason why¬†I wanted to¬†visit here¬†by was to make sure the graves¬†hadn‚Äôt¬†been defaced. I had some issues with people coming by leaving junk¬†after it all happened. With the new remains being found I was worried some weirdos‚Äô will have their attention drawn to the town again.¬†¬†

‚ÄúIf is find with you,¬†I‚Äôll¬†stay nearby. It is hot outside. You appear¬†to risk for a heat stroke.‚Äù¬†¬†

I felt a little jealous of him for being able to not feel the heat. He was right. I¬†wouldn‚Äôt¬†be¬†any¬†help anyone if I¬†collapsed¬†from being in the sun for too long.¬†¬†

Even though I hired him, Yuan paid for our food. He left a generous tip that made Ms. Hill gush over him. She almost¬†didn‚Äôt¬†want to let us go.¬†When she found out where we were headed¬†next,¬†she almost appeared guilty.¬†¬†

We headed out again with a great deal to think about. I wanted to start going over more details, but a voice called out my name. A batch of mixed emotions came over my chest. Julie and her brother James caught us on the street. Her face was flushed in excitement seeing and old friend come by, but her brother glared in our direction letting his¬†feelings known.¬†

‚ÄúDid you really need to be here? You know what seeing you does to people around here, right?‚Äù he said with crossed¬†arms.¬†¬†

His twin sister gave his arm a sharp punch clearly trying to hurt him.¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt¬†be an ass. Dean was hurt the most.¬†This town was dying anyway.¬†It‚Äôs¬†not his fault stores are closing.‚Äù¬†¬†

I mentally flinched. People did move away ten years ago. Just as things were starting to recover the whole thing was brought back up again. The siblings had some hushed words and James walked away.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm¬†sorry about him. You know what I always say, I got the brains, and he got the looks. I should have ate him before we were born.‚Äù She huffed. ‚ÄúAnyway, who‚Äôs your friend?‚Äù¬†

Julie was good at recovering from anything negative. She was the only person I¬†kept in contact¬†with¬†from the town after I moved. I wished we talked more. I found myself¬†having issues¬†trying to keep my head above water to be able to stay on top of personal relationships.¬†¬†

‚ÄúThis is Yuan.¬†He's¬†a PI¬†I¬†hired.‚Äù I nodded toward him.¬†

For a moment I forgot he was even there.¬†

Julie‚Äôs face lit up. She looked him over as if he¬†was¬†the 8^(th)¬†wonder of the world.¬†

‚ÄúA real PI? Like on TV?‚Äù She gushed.¬†

‚ÄúRun.‚Äù I half whispered to Yuan who listened.¬†¬†

We let him go inside a nearby shop so I could talk to an old friend.¬†

‚ÄúDo you guys have any new leads?‚Äù She asked¬†extremely¬†hopeful.¬†

‚ÄúNo, not really.‚Äù I admitted and her face fell.¬†

‚ÄúI really wish I¬†could do more for you.‚Äù¬†

I shook my head just thankful how kind some people in the town still acted towards someone like¬†myself.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve¬†never bad mouthed my father. It means a lot considering everything...‚Äù I trailed off still not being able to openly admit¬†what he had been accused of.¬†

‚ÄúIt just never made sense to me, you know? Sorry, of course you do. I just...¬†it‚Äôs¬†so confusing. He had no reason... for what happened.¬†It‚Äôs¬†so out of character it feels impossible for it all to be true. Hey,¬†I‚Äôve¬†been meaning to ask... Did you um... request some tests after he died?¬†I‚Äôve¬†heard people who have tumors suddenly do things that normally¬†wouldn‚Äôt.¬†It would explain why what happened, well, happened...‚Äù¬†

Here I thought I was the only person who thought this case was strange. I assumed people had accepted the official answer and that was that. Julie and her brother had spent time at my place. They were the same age as my sister and¬†were hit hard when they heard she was gone. And was hit even harder when the full details of what was done to her came out. They knew my father as the same kind man as I thought of him as.¬†

‚ÄúMy aunt had tests like that done. They found nothing.¬†No medical reason. He¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†cheating on my mother. He¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†struggling at work. There was just, no reason and no signs that he would snap.‚Äù¬†

She looked¬†almost as¬†hurt as I felt. I thought she was going to cry but Julie remained strong to keep talking.¬†

‚ÄúI hate it.¬†I‚Äôm¬†sorry. I know this is so much harder on¬†you. But I¬†can‚Äôt¬†stand people saying your father was the who... He¬†wouldn‚Äôt. I know he would never do such a thing.¬†I¬†can‚Äôt¬†think of any other explanation. Whenever someone bad mouths him I want to scream.‚Äù¬†

Even thought I was hot I still wrapped an arm around her shoulder. We had both grown up since I last saw her in person, but I¬†don‚Äôt¬†think she would ever¬†lose¬†her pure childlike heart.¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt¬†worry about it. People have nothing else to go on. Even if he¬†didn‚Äôt¬†do what they think, it¬†doesn‚Äôt¬†matter. The worst thing has already happened. Who cares what people think? I still know the kind of man my father was.‚Äù¬†

Her blue eyes were wet with¬†tears,¬†and he pushed some light hair out of her face.¬†I think she¬†wanted to keep talking but¬†didn‚Äôt¬†want to keep me for too long.¬†

‚ÄúI think James¬†is roasting in the sun. And if I stay¬†longer,¬†I‚Äôll¬†start bawling and get snot on your shirt. Can you¬†come and see¬†me again before you leave town?‚Äù¬†

I promised her I would and asked her to go easy on her brother which she refused. Yuan came back a few seconds after she left, his arms filled with¬†bundles¬†of fresh flowers.¬†

‚ÄúI was unable to make a decision.‚Äù He¬†said¬†and I took a few to help carry his burden.¬†

‚ÄúI think you¬†just helped keep that shop going for another year. Why did even get flowers?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDid your mother and sister¬†not enjoy¬†them?‚Äù¬†

That thought made me stop walking as I considered the statement. Had anyone but my remaining family members and true crime weirdos leave flowers on their graves? I never thought of it before. Julie and James must¬†have. I had always assumed the town wanted to just forget what happened. Keeping it buried¬†benefited¬†them all.¬†¬†

‚ÄúThey would have thought you were silly for going overboard.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôll¬†keep that in mind going forward.‚Äù¬†

This guy was weird. That¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†a bad thing.¬†

We took our time walking down to the small graveyard. It felt odd that so many buildings¬†hadn‚Äôt¬†been updating since I had last been here. Same cracks in the roads and some broken windows.¬†I made a note to pick up a cold drink from the¬†variety¬†store on the way back.¬†

Since the cemetery was still in use it was one of the more modern¬†spot¬†in town. The old building had been torn down and rebuilt. A new large stone wall had been installed to try and keep bored kids out. Since the funeral home¬†had up to date equipment a lot of people from surrounding towns came here for their services.¬†¬†

The front gate was open. I needed to take a moment to remember where to go. I had only been here a handful of times which made me feel¬†slightly guilty. Yuan again offered to stay behind but I told him he could¬†come along. I¬†didn‚Äôt¬†have the arm space to carry all the flowers he bought.¬†

We silently found the pair of simple gravestones. They were clean just with some witling flowers inside the stone planters. We got to work replacing them and brushing some¬†dead leaves away.¬†¬†

‚ÄúIs your father buried somewhere else?‚Äù Yuan asked his voice even almost sounding careful with his words.¬†

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs in the planter.‚Äù I said unaware of how odd that sounded.¬†

‚ÄúI¬†didn‚Äôt¬†want people to vandalize his grave. I asked to have his body cremated and I put some of his ashes in¬†an urn at¬†the bottom of the planter.‚Äù¬†

If somehow Yuan was able to prove for certain my father was the one who killed my mother and¬†sister¬†then I could easily remove the urn of ashes. If he was able to prove someone else was behind the murders, then I would be able to bury the rest of him here. Back when I made the choice to have him¬†cremated,¬†I never expected to have the chance to review what happened. I just thought it was the best¬†option¬†to be able to keep my loved ones together.¬†

‚ÄúThat was a very mature choice for a child to make.‚Äù Yuan said standing behind me giving some space.¬†

‚ÄúI needed to grow up overnight back then.‚Äù I answered him.¬†

A still silence came between us.¬†Cicadas¬†trilled off in the distance. No wind¬†came to break the heat. I turned to speak to Yuan again feeling the need to tell him I¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†offended over what he said. He spoke first.¬†

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you angry?‚Äù¬†¬†

The question hit me like a truck. His cold eyes bore down into my soul stirring up emotions¬†I‚Äôve¬†kept down for years.¬†

Of course I was. I lost my mother,¬†father¬†and sister in a single night. It¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†just their deaths that caused a deep pit of lava hot anger to simmer¬†under my skin. What was done to them was gruesome. So much so I¬†couldn‚Äôt¬†bring myself to even think about it. All I could handle was knowing not all my sister had been found yet. People¬†didn‚Äôt¬†think my father was¬†just¬†a killer. They thought he was a monster.¬†¬†Swallowing all my feelings I pushed it all down.¬†

‚ÄúYou have a flower in your hair.‚Äù I told him and turned away.¬†

He¬†hadn‚Äôt¬†realized a bright white daisy had been placed above his ear. I bet the widowed shop owner had been hitting on him without him being aware¬†of it. He removed the small gift and handed it over. I spun the flower between my fingers then started to move back to the pathway.¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you want some time alone here?‚Äù Yuan offered.¬†

‚ÄúNo.¬†It‚Äôs¬†fine. I¬†don‚Äôt¬†have much to say to them. My aunt is doing well.¬†I‚Äôm¬†holding¬†down¬†a job. Nothing special is happening.¬†I‚Äôm¬†sure¬†they‚Äôll¬†be happy we just came by with flowers.‚Äù¬†

Yuan followed behind, his hands crossed behind his back his polished shoes clicking against the¬†well-maintained¬†stone walkway.¬†

‚ÄúIs your aunt the one who took you in?‚Äù He asked sounding like he was just trying to¬†make¬†conversation.¬†

‚ÄúYes. Sorta. I was always a tall and stocky kid. I could pass for eighteen when I was fourteen.¬†¬†I started working washing dishes around that time and got my own apartment¬†when I was able to start driving. My aunt was good enough to pay for¬†groceries¬†and stuff like that.¬†I‚Äôm¬†slowly saving up to pay her back.‚Äù¬†

I¬†didn‚Äôt¬†give him a chance to respond to what I told him. I stopped in front of another grave and placed the small daisy on top. Yuan read the name trying to place it.¬†

‚ÄúMr. Gown lived next to us. He worked with my father but was fired for being drunk on the job. He never admitted that was the reason and told anyone who would listen my father took his job. He died two years ago.‚Äù¬†I explained.¬†

Mr. Gown and his wife treated us well until¬†he was fired. I had a lot of memories playing with my sister in his backyard. His wife remained kind to us. I bet she only stayed with her husband because she¬†didn‚Äôt¬†have any other options. I doubted he was overly abusive. Just¬†verbally and lashed out to the people around him.¬†

‚ÄúDo you think Mr.¬†Gown would take revenge against your¬†family?‚Äù¬†¬†

Yuan pressed. I let myself consider the idea. I thought of our¬†neighbors¬†good moments and his worst one. He did blame my father for ruining his life. But would he really go¬†so far as¬†to kill him?¬†Did he go over that night in a drunk rage and things just got away from him?¬†

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I said after carefully thinking it all through. ‚ÄúGown had¬†unsteady hands¬†He might have been able to kill two adults and a child but... he¬†couldn‚Äôt¬†do everything else.‚Äù¬†

Yuan understood why I¬†didn‚Äôt¬†go into details. He must already¬†know the full extent of the case. I had seen my mother‚Äôs body. My stomach churned my small meal just having the brief image of her flash through my head. I wanted to be sick.¬†¬†

No, Gown would never do something like that.¬†How could any human go that far?¬†

‚ÄúI would like to go over the photos of the crime scene. I have them inside my motel room.‚Äù¬†

My head turned to look at him so quickly I thought it would snap. How did he get those? Some were leaked but the sheriff claimed he destroyed most of the photos. He¬†said¬†they were simply too evil to keep in¬†their¬†world.¬†I did hire¬†Yuan¬†to look over this case¬†but¬†him seeing the results of that night almost felt like a violation.¬†

‚ÄúI have only looked over what is publicly available. If you care not comfortable with-‚Äù¬†

I stopped him by raising a hand and shaking my head. I felt sick from the heat and this conversation.¬†

‚ÄúThis is your job. I know¬†you‚Äôll¬†be respectful.¬†It‚Äôs¬†fine.‚Äù I said eyes closed trying to fight a headache.¬†

‚ÄúNo.¬†It's¬†not fine. Nothing about this is fine.‚Äù¬†

The pieces - lovely colours, high quality, variety of 2D and 3D elements.

I love a good blend of 2D and 3D elements which this kit provided in a masterful way.

Most of the items were 3D that you had to make. 

While the 2D was reserved mainly for furniture and structural elements, with the exception of the tools in the front blue box.

The build - challenging, attainable. 

The way the kit constructed flower pots, cake/slice and other items was very unique and made me giggle with pure joy as I went.üòÑ

There were also a few steps where it provided options to increase the difficulty if interested...I was not.üòÖ

I cannot say enough how great this kit was. 

I love how the doors have knobs on the bottom of the kit so that you can open and close them.

1nwft3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/4tran4/comments/1nwft3w/this_is_a_very_long_and_repetitively_bad_and/,This is a very long and repetitively bad and cringe passoid take on effortmaxing and a shameless plug to a subreddit tbh I wouldn't even read it's not worth your time.,"I'm finally not making typos because I have my phone on autocorrect.

I do think from the perspective of someone who ""effort maxed"" (learned makeup and got good at it, did posture training, invested in natural hair wigs that look realistic and learned how to maintain them for my every day use, wearing clothes to feminize my silhouette with rounder ended dresses or higher waisted pants, etc.) until a lot of it wasn't as necessary as passing got better even though I still do a lot of it because I really enjoy my style that I've made, I do wish there was less shame around it though. 

I wish trans people didn't have to feel so much shame around having to do extra and put in more effort than a cis person or even someone who's luckier or richer does to feel safer or more secure or even just more affirmed, and I also wish there wasn't so much shame towards other people that need or choose to do those things, but I understand some of the reasons that happens and I'm no stranger to some of them. 

*And we could also talk about how even though people may have it easier to get to their goals it doesn't change the fact that you would still have to work harder, but I would be a hypocrite because I still get upset about needing to workout.*

A big part of it was style but also spending 10 years as a non cissie and even spending a period of time as ""visibly queer"" before I could even get on Estrogen, and having had the advantage of at least being able to research and learn more about different ways people can pass, so I'd kinda know at least where to start, because that's the hardest part.

Howeverüò≠

I have been corrected and changed my mind on a lot of issues in the last few months regarding this matter. I believe it's the unironic 100% serious survivorship bias of luckshits, youngshits, and richshits actually believing and projecting that effortmaxing is a guaranteed path to success to the point of forgetting, not ever getting, or patronizingly downplaying the amount of people who won't pass because they lack other privileges that a lot of youngshits and luckshits didn't need (I'm mostly talking surgeries), and the way several of them, including our favorite one at the minuteüòÖ saying things like

>""Most of yall are just lazy""

Or

>""You complain about being a hon but you don't even care about your appearance.""

And even though to an extent I do think a lot of people tend to hold themselves very far back with negative self talk and yes I understand that is the nature of this sub and I'm not here to deflect that, I mean, *I vent about my dysmorphia and issues with self harm quite often here*, none of these comments are of any good will or intention to encourage people to have the motivation do things they aren't yet comfortable with, it's just shaming them for not having that motivation. Gender dysphoria is tiring. You're probably tired. I'm tired even typing this. You're tired reading it most likely. Have a coffee and come back.‚òïÔ∏è






Anyways as I was saying, I know it doesn't work like this for everyone, but personally it helped me less when I had people being very condescending towards me for feeling hopeless about things like this, it really didn't make me want to do anything but isolate more. It actually made me want to try less, and just stay where I was. I have acknowledged that I had been guilty of doing the same thing before without really even knowing I was doing it.

I'm not necessarily just trying to help everyone pass, but mostly to also try my best to give the patience that I, and a lot of other people weren't given in our respective groups or whatever subreddits or corners of the internet you reside in.

I started returning to Christianity about a month ago, Believe it or not I converted to Islam in 2020 I was 18 at that time I was struggling to find a ‚Äúhome.‚Äù and I wasn‚Äôt agreeing with the Quran because most of the time its contradicting itself respectfully, I grew up Catholic (I‚Äôm Filipino), but I felt something was missing in my spiritual life.

One day, I happened to meet Abuna Daniel at a coffee shop in Los Angeles, I introduced myself to Abuna and asking for more information about his religion, He gave me a hug like I was family to him which was comforting and that encounter completely changed things for me. He led me a great direction to Christ. Since then, I‚Äôve been attending catechism at St. Mary & St. Athanasius Coptic Orthodox Church in Northridge, as well as the services and honestly Coptic Churches it feels like home

Honestly, I‚Äôve never felt so spiritually alive. I‚Äôm being challenged in the best way possible, and it‚Äôs all I think about day and night how to become a better Christian and live my life in Christ.

I‚Äôm seriously considering converting to Coptic Orthodoxy, I agree with Christ is one essence and the father, the son, and the holy spirit is as one. Even though I‚Äôm not Egyptian or from a Coptic background. Has anyone here gone through a similar path of converting as a non-Copt? Any advice, encouragement, or resources would mean a lot.

1nwfora,https://i.redd.it/h760ayjihrsf1.jpeg,My guardian angel and protector,"So I took a short break on my own in Portugal. I decided to go for a long hike in the Algarve around the hills there. I had took a mild psychedelic (2CB) and set off. About 10km in, and tripping slightly my knee started to hurt. This sent me in to a mild panic. 10km away from where I needed to be, knee hurting, feeling lost in an imposing woodland, with a stiff wind rustling the trees in a disorienting manner, I stopped and sat down to gather my thoughts. I had a snack from my bag, sipped some water and looked up. I saw this stick. 

I picked it up. Satisfyingly smooth barked, dry and sturdy, it was exactly the right height to use as a walking stick. My thumb sat beautifully on top, and it was lightweight and easy to wield. It was as if the universe conspired to turn soil, rain and sunlight in to this piece of wood and deliver it to me in my hour of need. 

This stick was enough to ease the pressure on my knee, batter brambles out of my path, keep me steady on rough ground but also wield like a 2-handed sword. 

It would be a ridiculous over-reach to say it saved my life, but it saved my hike. In my mildly inebriated state it became a friend, a constant. It kept me together and it spurred me on. I didn‚Äôt find it, it found me. It saw me safely home and it sat with me, stoic and strong when I sipped my beer and coffee at the summit of Monchique reflecting on the journey we had, together.

I‚Äôm a down-to-earth guy who‚Äôs well traveled with a professional career who's navigating a unique living situation right now. For financial and family reasons, I still share a home with my ex-wife (separate parts of the house). Just to be clear there is no romance, intimacy or chance we would get back together. We co-parent our kids under the same roof, and that‚Äôs where it begins and ends.

Semi-fit gym guy, clean shaven(head and face), enjoy going to the gym, bike riding, concerts, and social get together

What I‚Äôm Looking For:
I‚Äôd like to meet a person locally that I can genuinely connect with. Ideally, someone open-minded who understands that life isn‚Äôt always picture-perfect. I‚Äôm not looking to juggle multiple people, just hoping to build something real with the right person. A friends-with-benefits situation could work if that‚Äôs where things start, but if it naturally grows into something deeper, I‚Äôd be more than open to that.

About You:
You‚Äôre mature, understanding, and value honesty. Someone who wants a steady, no-games connection, whether it‚Äôs sharing laughs over coffee, spending time together, or exploring something more.

1nwfabw,https://www.reddit.com/r/FragranceStories/comments/1nwfabw/mom_said_it_was_my_turn_to_review_the_squidward/,Mom said it was my turn to review the Squidward EDP,"**The Background**

Normally, I am not into celebrity perfumes. But when I saw that this man had his own curated fragrance I did far too little research before purchasing and allowed myself the surprise. His coworkers' perfumes, obviously had already sold out, but a few thousand prized bottles of the new Eau Squidward remained and I snagged one with a fervor. I had no intention of writing a review, no intention of drawing attention to what I typically see as a genre typically filled with celebrities past their primes using ghost noses in the fragrance industry to capitalize on our nostalgia. I should not have underestimated him and for that I am truly sorry but have learned so much.

The *Squidward Tentacles* is a foug√®re which is no surprise to anyone, knowing the man appreciates class and elegance. I know you know, you know I know, but if someone *didn't* know, the foug√®re is a specific green and aromatic olfactory profile with a long, storied history. On a biochemical basis, the foug√®re, or 'fern,' works because of the volatility of lavender as a compound, giving an incredibly fresh green and aromatic experience that dies away to the sweeter undertow to the likes of coumarin, oakmoss. Throughout over a century of development, there have been more riffs on the foug√®re than stars in the sky but the underlying principle of the name remains the same: if it recalls the fresh, green burst of energy that calls to mind the fern accord, then you are working with a foug√®re.

And I am working with a foug√®re, here. Reminiscent of a thinking man. A man with passions. A man, scorned.

**The Experience**

It starts out strong, with an almost harsh introduction. At first spray, I was hit with a blast of salt and seawater, astringent and cold. It was the scent of the ocean at dawn, before the sun has had a chance to warm it, before the tourists have descended. It was lonely, and it was demanding attention. I almost coughed. It was a slap in the face with a wet kelp glove. It was a ""what do you want?"" and an ""I'm busy"" in olfactory form.

But then, just as I was about to wash it off and call this twelve dollar experiment a failure, it began to change. The sharp, salty edge softened, just a little. A new note emerged from the depths. It was the smell of old books. The vellum pages of his sheet music, the leather binding of an art history tome, the faint, dusty scent of charcoal and oil paint. It was an intellectual scent, a scent of solitude and concentration. It wasn't a warm, cozy library smell; it was colder, more formal, not just appreciative of history but protective.

The lavender bomb that followed is not for the faint of heart, and that is fine. He is not your friend. He's an artist and this is his art. Raw, enduring, and as uncompromising as he is. Do people really dilute lavender, you can imagine his mockery at the thought. Sit with it. Sit with your discomfort. He challenges you. What is art that does not challenge your core beliefs? What is art that bows to what you already stumble blindly into, believing that it must be true, if not propaganda? This harsh turn reminds you of a world, alive, bold and brash.

There are other clever touches I thought caring and aligned with his values: the wood note is, of course, a reference to his beloved clarinet but is not the aged african blackwood of its external shell. No, and I feel gauche for expecting that to be the case. The reference is sharper. Instead of the clarinet, the woodiness pulls towards the ART of the wood, where the sound is born: the reed. The smell is of the wood shavings he carves away with a blade to get his perfect tone, simultaneously representing refinement of the raw reed to shape, and then creation itself with the first sweet crystalline note he plays.

I think the most telling, moving thing about this perfume is what is NOT in it. There are no fruits. There is no sweetness. There is nothing inviting or crowd-pleasing about it. There is no vanilla, no smooth, hot coffee, no tonka bean to round the edges and make it friendly. It refuses to be comforting. It refuses to be anything other than exactly what it is: miles under an uncaring sea, a lone artist, waiting for his genius to be recognized.

I have worn it three times now. The first time, to see if I liked it. The second time, because I couldn't stop thinking about it. And the third time, because I wanted to. A declaration (certainly not a celebration) of artistic dedication so passionately held that the fire turns to steel, the flame to ice. It is the scent of waiting, the scent of the artist in his tower, a scent that cannot pander to humanity until humanity has raised its collective standards and begs for him.

**The Connection**

At the grocery store on my third flirtatious interaction with the *Squidward Tentacles*, the clerk says, ""that one is open,"" and points to a self-checkout. I nod, distracted by a KitKat when he adds, ""I hear it too, you know. The clarion call. The future. The time to come.""

I freeze. A man in a tie behind me is impatient. I turn, just enough to see the clerk's face. He looks past me, at a promotional cardboard cutout of a smiling, yellow sponge. There is no recognition in his eyes, no shared joke. He is simply reciting words he has heard. I grab my bag and leave without another word, my purchases forgotten. This is what his artistry does, it is a contagion. The scent is a portal and I have walked through it not unscathed but with scars that I love. I am not the only one. The only way through, is through the perfume department.

[The only way out is through](https://preview.redd.it/tih7usuofrsf1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=62de81b67e14c6eb37f5dc170c8d1641b223433d)

**A Conclusion**

Tonight, I will put it on again. I will sit in the dark with my window open, letting the cold, lonely, beautiful scent fill the room. I will listen. I will wait for the music to begin. It might not be a clarinet. It might be something else entirely. It might be the sound of my own breath, suddenly sharper in the quiet darkness. It might be the faint, almost imperceptible hum of the world outside. It might be the final, raw, ragged breath of Squidward's Hopes and Dreams.

The mocha coffee scented one is my favorite of the two but they were both a bit disappointing to me tbh. It has a very, very, light warm white mocha coffee scent. The almond vanilla scented one smells like a very, very, light, standard cheap vanilla scent (it smells like the vanilla scented body mist and lotion that Dollar Tree sells which I also think has that standard cheap vanilla scent).

I expected the scents to be stronger because the watermelon scented one I had in the summertime had a much stronger scent. The level of scent was on par with the Bath & Body Works PocketBac hand sanitizers and the Wish spray sanitizers from Five Below. The lightness of the scents is what disappointed me. You can smell their scents in the air when you spray them, but as soon as they hit your skin, the scent is gone. Although I don‚Äôt like my hand sanitizer scents to stick to my skin for ages, I do like for the scent to linger for a minute or two!

They work as intended, sanitize without drying out my skin, and they‚Äôre cute and fun to spray. Plus, I really like the colors. So for, $1.25 each, despite the complaints, I‚Äôm satisfied overall ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòÇ.

We typically meet a few times a week and either go out or spend time at home, which we plan together. There's a lot of affection and fun. 

I'm a very anxious person who needs communication and efforts for reassurance. It took me some time to be secure with this relationship. I find it hard to focus on other things if he's said he's gonna visit or call, until he visits or calls. I anxiously wait and consider any delay on his end as disinterest or disrespect. I feel like I force him to adhere to certain things and when he can't, I crumble and start a difficult conversation.

He, on the other hand is simple, independent, secure and takes everything easy with a grain of salt. This also comes with a lot of time blindness and a lack in stepping up to do things. In months of going out to work together at a cafe, he didn't know what coffee I drink. He's very comfortable with coexisting in this relationship and doesn't feel the need for spontaneity and excitement or to try beyond what feels easy.

I gotten an A1 over the summer after saving up from my summer job.

My dad tried helping me by looking through reddit  and some people say it's due to an uneven/wobbly table or surface the printer was on.
Switched to a non-wobbly/least moving surface table (old but perfect condition coffee table).
The issue STILL occurred. After a while I was like ""whatever"" and ignored it and printed anyways.
No. issues.

Got a few decants in the mail and wanted to sum up my thoughts on them--hopefully this is helpful to someone.

The first part of this review is fall/holiday specific gourmands, the rest of the list are just gourmands I have tried recently.

**Hey Sugar Fragrance Co:** I can't recommend this shop enough. Every time I order from this company it has been a good experience.

Gingerbread Cake: One of my favorites from Hey Sugar. Very photorealistic. Think gingerbread cookie with icing. I am getting a full bottle of this one. Average to above average performance/projection.

Carrot Cake: I don't know if anyone considers this a fall scent lol but it is hyperrealistic carrot cake, complete with frosting. Getting a full bottle of this one, it is too good. Average to above average silage/performance.

Pumpkin Milkshake: This one is a pretty linear blend of pumpkin spice and lactonic notes. Not exactly what I expected but I like it. I will probably layer this over Coffee Addict for a Pumpkin Spice Latte effect.

Pumpkin Praline Crunch: Praline, fall spices, pumpkin. Yum yum. I really like the praline note in this!

Fallelujah: This reminds me of a fall candle, but in a good way. The description reads: pumpkin latte, coconut, fall berries, amber, autumn spices, driftwood and vanilla; I am not getting any of the coconut, amber or driftwood. I do pick up on the pumpkin, spices and fall berries. Recommend if you want to smell like a fall candle.

Apple Crisp: This reminds me strongly of BBW Champagne Apple and Honey. It is photorealistic red apple and it's nice. Probably won't upgrade this as I already have a the mentioned BBW scent.

Dulce Caramello: This is supposed to be a cocoa/caramel/vanilla/espresso fragrance and interestingly it reminds me of chocolate scratch and sniff stickers in a children's book. The more I smell it the more I like it. This is less photorealistic coffee than Coffee Addict or French Coffee; it is more akin to BBW Vanilla Cafe.

Bianca Latte: I have had this one for awhile actually but since I am reviewing this shop I wanted to include my thoughts. This is the best BL dupe I have found, slightly more forward with the honey notes. No plastic notes like Eclaire. Average to above average projection/silage.

Sticky Dates: Dupe of Lush's Sticky Dates. This is a BEAST. It's so strong I actually have not figured out a way to wear it...I might need to try the ""spray in the air and walk through it"" approach. It is my strongest performing fragrance ever (I have not tried Followed by Kerosene yet though!).

Temptation: This is a dupe of Tempt Me Not, which I have not tried. It's similar to Escape Gourmande with a punch of heliotrope. I like this a lot and it's different enough to make me consider getting a full bottle when my sample is done. I have been reaching for this one a lot lately.

**Demeter:** got a 4 pack of 15 ml dabbers on sale from TJ Maxx. My first Demeter fragrances, did not have high expectations because they are known to have poor longevity. Was pleasantly surprised by two of them. Two had notably worse performance.

Demeter Butterscotch: This one was surprisingly photorealistic and long lasting for a Demeter fragrance, basically linear butterscotch. Lasted 4 hours on skin, moderate projection.

Demeter Dark Chocolate: It's dark chocolate, also linear. Lasted about 3-4 hours on skin. Reminds me of Tubbees chocolate fudge, minus the hazelnut notes. Second best performance of the 4.

Demeter Vanilla Cake Batter: Very subtle sweet scent, reminds me a bit of milk lightly spiced with cinnamon. I do pick up on the vanilla, which is similar to Outremer Vanille. Very low silage and lasted less than an hour on fabric.

Demeter Angel Food: I couldn't smell anything at all when sniffing the bottle. I do get a scent when testing but it is very hard to pick up. Similar to Vanilla Cake Batter, there might be a subtle note of almond but I am having a terrible time trying to detect anything at all.

**Vanilla Voyage:** I consider this to be somewhere between Bianco Latte and Escape Gourmande scent wise, but my first thought when I smelled this is that it is a Bianco Latte dupe. It is better than Eclaire, no plastic notes and I am not picking up on any cumarin in this formulation. Lasted 10+ hours on skin. Later stage dry down was very nice (nicer than Eclaire or other BL dupes). It feels redundant for me to own but I like this one.

**Lattafa:** I am not the biggest fan of this brand, despite me trying to love them, and at this point I am not sure it is worth playing Russian Roulette with decants/bottle purchases. I do not recommend anyone buy any Lattafa without trying a decant first.

Lattafa Choco Overdose: I made a thread on this. It still smells mostly like Chocolate Amber from BBW. I blind bought a full bottle of this and I don't think it will be a love at this point, but hopefully maybe a like.

Lattafa Whipped Pleasure: This one worked out. Vanilla ice cream/butterscotch/caramel opening with a whipped cream dry down. No fruit notes. Very nice!

Lattafa Cookie Crave: It smells artificial to me in a non-appealing way, but it is not completely terrible. I am getting a bit of the milk dipped in Oreo. It's more feminine than Choco Overdose and certainly more lactonic. I can't imagine myself ever reaching for this.

Lattafa Nebras Elixir: ....this is gross. It smells artificial and unfinished. Weird Lattafa DNA from one of their other fragrances, plus some nondescript sweet scent.  I got a 1 ml decant of this and am glad I didn't get any more of it. I hope this improves, and if it does I will update this.

**Tubbees:** These are surprisingly great and long lasting--I could still smell these on paper in the morning. Overall I recommend Tubbees over the Lattafa Give Me Gourmand line, with the exception of Whipped Pleasure.

Tubbees Cookies & Cream: This is Nilla wafers dipped in milk. Really good and I can see myself layering this with a couple of different scents :)

Tubbees Chocolate Fudge: This is what I thought Choco Overdose would be--perhaps it might end up being more similar with further Choco Overdose maceration. The opening between the two is similar at times (sometimes not). It's sweeter than Choco Overdose and I can really pick up on the hazelnut notes. I don't think it reminds me of Nutella but I hope one day I find a fragrance that does!

**Bath and Body Works:** My experiences with BBW are hit or miss but I really do like quite a few of their fragrances. I have been reaching for Warm Vanilla Sugar a lot, which reminds me strongly of Coty's Vanilla Fields. I also like Vanilla Cafe in cool weather. Evil Queen is a very nice apple scent for the fall, as is Champagne Apple and Honey. Whipped Honey and Vanilla is also a nice one in lotion form. The Milk Bar collection is nice but under performs--it really does smell like cake/frosting though. I recommend waiting for sales for all of these.

Fragrances I like the most: Hey Sugar Gingerbread Cake, Hey Sugar Carrot Cake, Demeter Butterscotch, Tubbees Cookies & Cream, Lattafa Whipped Pleasure, BBW Warm Vanilla Sugar, Hey Sugar Temptation.

3. **Breathe, Baby, Breathe**: Take five minutes to focus on your breath. Deep inhales through your nose, and slow exhales through your mouth. Feel the air in your lungs, and let that tension fly away. It's like giving your body a mini-vacation.

4. **Get Lively**: Crank up a music playlist that makes you want to move! Even a quick shimmy in the kitchen while waiting for the coffee to brew can shake off that stiffness. Why not belt out a tune while you‚Äôre at it? üé§

Each pair has its own strengths and weaknesses, so let's break it down.

## Sound Quality: A Clear Winner
When it comes to sound quality, the Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 wins, hands down. It sounds noticeably better than the Sony. While you can use the equalizer on the Sony XM6 to adjust the sound, when you listen to both side by side, you can really tell the difference. The Px7 S3 just has a superior, more premium sound.


## Comfort & Build Quality: Bowers & Wilkins Takes the Lead
The Bowers & Wilkins headphones are also slightly more comfortable. They fit my head and ears better. At first, the clamping force of the headband feels a little tight, which might be uncomfortable for some, but after a few days, it loosens up and feels just right.
The Sony XM6 headphones feel a bit softer, but the earcups seem thinner. It feels like they would wear out over time, and the plastic frame might start to press against your head.
In terms of build quality, the Bowers & Wilkins are clearly superior. They have a premium feel, better finishes, and just feel more solid. The Sony headphones aren't bad, but they feel very plastic-y in comparison. When you touch them, you can feel the difference.


## Noise Cancellation & Features: Sony's Strongest Points
This is where the Sony XM6 headphones really shine. Their noise cancellation is better than the Bowers & Wilkins in almost every way. While both headphones are great at filtering out low-frequency sounds like airplane or train rumbles, the Sony XM6 is much better at blocking out mid- and high-frequency noise.
Another thing I love about the Sony XM6 is its interface and features. This really comes down to preference. If you like physical buttons, you'll prefer the Bowers & Wilkins. But if you like touch controls, the Sony is the one for you. You can do a lot just by using the touchpad on the side.

A great feature on the Sony is the ability to cover the earcup with your palm to automatically lower the music volume and switch to transparency mode. This makes it super easy to have a quick conversation without taking the headphones off. Once you lift your hand, the music returns to its previous volume and noise cancellation turns back on. Both headphones also have automatic play/pause when you take them off. The Sony XM6 also has a few extra modes for listening, like ""cinema"" and ""coffee shop,"" but honestly, I don't find them very useful.


## Codecs & Connectivity: Bowers & Wilkins Has an Edge
The Bowers & Wilkins headphones also have an advantage when it comes to audio codecs. Plus, you can connect them directly with a cable for high-quality audio. If you have a device that supports the aptX Loseless codec, you're set. Even with the aptX HD codec I'm currently using with my Pixel 9 Pro, you can still notice a slight improvement in sound quality when you connect the cable.


## Final Verdict: It All Comes Down to What You Value
In the end, I chose the Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3. The sound quality is what I'll be enjoying all the time, whereas perfect noise cancellation is something I only need every once in a while (unless you travel a lot). For me, the superior sound of the Bowers & Wilkins makes them the more appealing choice.

""I was getting pain medication for my back and my knee a while back, it was the only thing that would help me work. Took the pain right out of it. One night, I had a few sips and they had to take me to the hospital. After that, my doctor watched how many pills I had but he [Chance] was taking them right out of my bottle and I didn't know.

""Couldn't get the no more.""

SH :

Ed :
""No, I don't think it was his mama.""

SH :

""Why you wanna know that shit at all?""

SH : 
""Ed, when are you going to be done? Like, for real? I don't know about you and Sally's relationship but what I do know is people can only take so much. That's not a child, that's a grown ass man....

Ed :
""He won't. Never has, never will. I've known Sally years before we started [a relationship]. Felt sorry for him at first,

""Sounds crazy [but] he don't eat hot food, it messes him up.""

SH :
""Wait, what do you mean messes him up? Makes him sick?""

Ed :
""Yeah,  can't get it down his throat. He starts choking and making weird choke sounds, [so the food] can't be warm, not even coffee.""

SH :
""So then what does he eat?""

Ed :

""Dog got into it one time and almost died. We ain't have the money to the vet but he pulled through.""

SH :
""Oh my God, I'm so glad. Wait a minute, 'lock on the door', I remember this. Why does he have a lock on his door?""

Ed :
""We ain't had to use it much in the last year, [the lock is for a few] different reasons. At first, we didn't trust him around the dogs and had to keep him separate. Then, he was telling me and his mama he was going to kill us in our sleep.""
""3 years ago.""

SH :
""Jesus Christ, Ed.""

Ed :
""Don't trust him to be out loose in the house when we leave.""

SH :
""Why?""

Ed :
""I don't know, I don't want to go real deep into it but his mama's underwear came up missing. We still got the gun in the house and we STILL don't trust him around the dog.""

Ed : 
""Hell, ain't got nowhere to go. All my savings is ate up, can't work because of my knee and got nowhere to go. My daughter don't talk to me. Won't even let me see my damn granddaughter 'cause she don't want her around Chance.""

""That woman [Sally] is damn stupid. He would piss on her and tell her it's the rain and she believe him. Fuck her and that damn little monster. He ain't shit, I had too much to drink tonight, might go off on the little bastard myself.""

""Sometimes, I can't stand him. Not even mad but want to beat the living Hell out of him, can't stand looking at his ugly damn face anymore. Ugly S.O.B. puts me and his mama through hell.""

I met someone on hinge we went out last week and things went really well. Our next date is tomorrow and I‚Äôm really excited to see her again but also really scared because I have zero experience and she does have experience. Our coffee date was the first date I‚Äôd ever been on.

But more than that I‚Äôm aegosexual so I really like the thought of kissing her and having sex with her and I definitely fantasize. Except when I think about actually doing any of that outside of fantasy, the desire goes away and I‚Äôm worried that in the moment in reality, I won‚Äôt be able to deliver on anything we‚Äôve talked about. 

For example she made it clear that after this date she plans to kiss me and that sounds great in theory but again that‚Äôs different than being in the moment with it actually happening. 

It makes me feel like I‚Äôm fighting with myself because I want to want these things but I can‚Äôt seem to make myself actually want them.

Ever feel like you're shouting into the void? You spend time crafting what you think is a great post, hit 'publish', and then... crickets. ü¶ó It's frustrating and can make you want to give up entirely.

I've been there. The big shift for me was realizing that social media isn't a megaphone; it's a coffee shop. You're not there to broadcast, you're there to have conversations. When you stop trying to *present* and start trying to *connect*, everything changes.

So, how do you actually start those conversations?

*   **Ask better questions.** Instead of a ""yes/no"" question, ask something open-ended that makes people think. Instead of ""Are you having a good day?"" try, ""**What's one small win you've had today?**""

*   **Create ""Fill in the Blanks"".** These are super low-effort for people to answer and almost irresistible. For example: ""The one habit I'm trying to build this month is \_\_\_\_\_\_.""

*   **Share a small, vulnerable story.** You don't have to pour your entire soul out, but sharing a minor struggle and asking, ""Has anyone else felt this way?"" creates an instant, human bond. It gives people permission to share their own experiences.

*   **This or That.** Simple polls or questions that give two options are incredibly effective. ""Morning workout or Evening workout?"", ""Reading a book or Listening to a podcast?"" It's quick, easy, and gets the ball rolling.

This isn't just about numbers and ""reach."" When people reply, you're building a community. You're getting feedback, finding people who get you, and creating a support system that fuels your own growth. You start to feel less alone on your journey.

Honestly, putting yourself out there can be emotionally draining, especially when you're met with silence at first. It takes a lot of resilience to keep showing up. If you're struggling with the emotional side of things‚Äîthe self-doubt, the frustration‚Äîit's okay to need a solid game plan for your mental well-being. I've been getting a lot out of **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)** for building that inner strength.

It's all a process of trial and error, but focusing on connection over perfection is the key.
