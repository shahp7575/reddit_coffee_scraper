I’m a 35-year-old man (US, ET time zone) who thrives on introspection, curiosity, and passionate drives.

I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure and adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

I love coffee, both simple and bitter and excessively frilly concoctions, burning incense, because I've always thought the smoke is cool, archiving and organizing, collecting (written texts, oddities and cool things), and time pieces.

1qp7joo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ghaziabad/comments/1qp7joo/road_trip_to_kasar_devi/,Road Trip to Kasar Devi,"Hey everyone,

My friend was supposed to join me on a short trip to Kasar Devi near Almora, but he had to bail last minute due to some urgent work 😩 So now I’m planning to go solo… but honestly, it’d be way more fun with some good company!

\*\*About the place\*\*

Kasar Devi is this beautiful, peaceful hilltop spot \~8 km from Almora. Ancient temple (supposedly 2nd century), insane Himalayan views, pine forests, and that famous “hippie hill” vibe (Crank’s Ridge) where Swami Vivekananda meditated and later all the 60s–70s hippies hung out. Perfect for some nature, light trekking, meditation, sunset gazing, and just chilling away from city noise.

\*\*Rough plan\*\*

•  When: Depending on your availability, either on Thursday/Friday Night.

•  From: Indirapuram, Ghaziabad (I’m based here).

•  How: Overnight drive as I have a spacious SUV and I am an experienced driver when it comes to driving in the hills.

•  Stay: In Almora, Binsar, or closer to Kasar Devi (lots of homestays, hostels like The Hosteller, and cafes around).

•  Vibe: Relaxed, no strict itinerary. Temple visit, short hikes, café hopping, stargazing, maybe explore nearby spots like Binsar if time permits.

I’m happy to sort out the basic logistics and share a rough budget once we connect. Nothing fancy – just good views, good conversations, and maybe some chai/coffee at a hilltop café. Or we can also enjoy few J’s if you’re into 🍁.

If you’re interested, drop a comment or DM me with:

•  Your availability

•  If you have a driving license (for just in case)

•  Any preferences

Would love to chat and figure out if we can make this happen! Preferably people who are chill, respectful of the place, and okay with some walking.

Looking forward to hearing from you! 🌄🕉️

Safe travels to everyone planning their own getaways! ✌️

Hey everyone,

I posted about my first ever App I built last weekend and to my surprise, Reddit gave me all love and flowers instead of ripping it apart.

  
In just 48 hours, SkyLocation has been downloaded over **1500 times** and even broke into the **Top 100 App Charts at #76!**

**Almost everyone is buying Pro immediately for lifetime as its so affordable, Less than a cup of coffee.**

Like many of you, I’ve spent countless hours on flights staring out the window wondering, ""What city is that?"" or ""Where actually are we?""

So, I decided to build SkyLocation, my very first app. 

The goal was simple: Pure, offline clarity. I built the entire app in XCode.

The response has been absolutely surreal.

Here is what it does (and why I’m proud of it):

1. Offline Reverse Geocoding: I built in an offline database so it can tell you the nearest city and country without needing a ping to a server.
2. Emergency SOS: This was a big one for me. If you’re hiking or off-grid and lose signal, you can capture your exact location and share it with emergency contacts instantly.
3. Privacy First: **No accounts, no tracking, no data collection, no subscriptions**. It’s just a utility that lives on your phone.

Please do download and give me your feedback:

I’ve developed a small 2-player strategy game (featuring cats, dogs, and the Queen of Balloonists) and I’m looking for your honest opinion! (But please, you don't have to be *too* brutal).

You don’t need to print or craft anything to try it out... unless you want to!

Here is how it works:

1. Grab a tablet.
2. Open this URL:[http://boing.abcxyz.de/local\_game.html](http://boing.abcxyz.de/local_game.html)
3. Read the rules (available in English and German):[http://boing.abcxyz.de/rules/index.html](http://boing.abcxyz.de/rules/index.html)
4. Find your favorite gaming partner.
5. Place the tablet on the table and start playing!

If you’d rather play on a real board, you can find the Print & Play files for download at the end of the rules page.

Up until now, I’ve only received feedback from friends and family. While helpful, I now need people to test the game completely ""blind."" I’m especially interested in:

* Rule Clarity: Are the rules easy to understand? Can you start playing without outside help?
* Game Feel: How does it feel overall? (Fun vs. Frustration)

It’s a quick ""filler"" game: perfect for a coffee break or as a warm-up for your next game night. I’d be thrilled if you could jump in and leave me some feedback here or via PM!

It doesn’t wait for you to ask questions.

It messages *you first.*

It remembers everything.

And it can literally run your business while you sleep.

Most people still think of AI as something you open, prompt, and close.

But Moltbot flips that completely.

It’s proactive. Persistent. Private.

It lives in your favorite apps — WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, iMessage — and doesn’t forget what you tell it.

That’s the future of automation.

# Why Moltbot AI Automation Assistant Is Different

Traditional AI tools wait for your input.

You open ChatGPT, type your prompt, wait for an answer, and close it.

That’s reactive AI.

The **Moltbot AI Automation Assistant** is *proactive AI.*

It reaches out to you first.

It can send your daily briefings, flag urgent messages, remind you of deadlines, and summarize your meetings — without you lifting a finger.

It doesn’t start from zero every time. It builds memory, learns your patterns, and keeps evolving.

This means you get a true digital assistant, not just a chatbot.

One that knows you, your team, your workflow — and grows smarter every day.



# Real Automation, Not Just Conversation

The **Moltbot AI Automation Assistant** doesn’t just chat — it *executes.*

It controls your browser.

It runs commands.

It manages files.

It sends emails, executes scripts, and handles repetitive business tasks automatically.

You can text it commands like:

“Find all partnership emails from this week and draft replies.”

Or:

“Build a new landing page for our community and upload it.”

And it does it.

In the background. While you’re doing something else.

Imagine texting your AI assistant like an employee:

“Create 3 LinkedIn posts promoting our latest case study.”

Done.

Posted.

Scheduled.

That’s real automation.



# How the Moltbot AI Automation Assistant Works

Here’s the simple version.

Think of it like a switchboard.

Messages come in from your chat apps — WhatsApp, Slack, Telegram.

Moltbot reads them, interprets the task, and sends actions to your computer.

Your machine executes them.

Your data never leaves.

Only the AI query goes to the model provider — Claude, GPT, Gemini, or any other model you pick.

Everything else stays private.

That’s what makes Moltbot different from every other “AI assistant” out there.

It’s not cloud AI. It’s *your* AI.



# What Moltbot Can Do for You

The **Moltbot AI Automation Assistant** can handle almost anything you’d normally do manually.

* Summarize customer messages from Discord or Telegram
* Draft and send email replies
* Clean your inbox
* Generate content on schedule
* Research market data
* Manage spreadsheets
* Build landing pages
* Write and schedule social posts

You tell it once. It remembers forever.

It’s like hiring a personal assistant that works 24/7, never complains, and costs nothing.



# Built for Real People, Not Tech Gurus

You don’t need a data center or a computer science degree to use this.

You just need one laptop or a small cloud server.

Install a few free tools. Link your accounts. Set up your workflows once.

That’s it.

No coding required.

It’s early, yes — but regular people are already using it to save hours every day.



# Privacy Built In

The **Moltbot AI Automation Assistant** runs locally.

That means your workflows, data, and context stay inside your environment.

Only the minimal AI query leaves your system.

Your prompts, messages, and history are stored privately — not in someone else’s data warehouse.

It’s private AI automation, not another SaaS subscription.



# Why This Matters

Most AI assistants are reactive.

They wait for your next question, forget the last one, and do nothing in between.

The **Moltbot AI Automation Assistant** flips that dynamic completely.

It builds persistent memory.

It runs autonomous tasks.

It checks in with you before you even ask.

That’s a new class of AI — proactive, persistent, and privacy-first.

And it’s open-source.

Which means developers all over the world are contributing new features every week.



# A Day in the Life with Moltbot

You wake up.

Before you even check your notifications, Moltbot texts you a briefing:

* Key stats from overnight analytics
* Member questions from your community
* Reminders of today’s deadlines

You reply:

“Write responses and schedule them for later.”

Done.

By the time you finish your coffee, your morning tasks are already handled.

Midday, Moltbot pings again:

“Found a viral AI automation thread — do you want to post a response?”

You say yes.

It writes, edits, and posts it automatically.

End of the day, you ask:

“Give me a summary of what happened and tomorrow’s priorities.”

Instant report.

You go to bed knowing everything’s under control.

That’s the kind of freedom this tool gives you.



# Moltbot vs. ChatGPT and Siri

Let’s be honest.

ChatGPT is reactive. You go to it. You ask. It answers. End of story.

Siri? Shallow memory. Forgets everything.

The **Moltbot AI Automation Assistant** is persistent and proactive.

It remembers your goals. It follows up. It builds context.

It doesn’t live in an app you have to open.

It lives *where you already are.*

In your messages. In your workflow.

This is what AI assistants were supposed to become — not smarter chat, but smarter *action.*



# Early Adopters Are Winning

Let’s be real.

The **Moltbot AI Automation Assistant** isn’t one-click easy yet.

You’ll need to set it up.

But once you do, it becomes invisible.

You text it like a friend, and it handles everything in the background.

Early adopters are already getting leverage.

Real automation.

Real results.

Not novelty — efficiency.

If you’re a builder, founder, or creator who values automation over convenience, this is for you.

If you need a polished enterprise tool with zero setup, wait 6 months.

But if you want to lead the curve — start now.

Regular visits to a [**Dentist in Ahmedabad**](https://www.livejournal.com/away?to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.karnavatidentalcare.com%2F) play a big role in keeping your teeth clean, white, and healthy for the long term. Services like teeth cleaning, whitening, and polishing are some of the most common and effective dental treatments today. They improve not only your smile but also your overall oral hygiene.



Dentist in ahmedabad

This detailed guide explains everything you need to know about visiting a **Dental Clinic in Ahmedabad** for these treatments, including benefits, causes, symptoms, types, treatment process, costs, and how Ahmedabad compares with other cities.

# Understanding Teeth Cleaning, Whitening, and Polishing

These are preventive and cosmetic dental procedures that remove stains, plaque, and discoloration to improve oral health and appearance.

Teeth cleaning, whitening, and polishing are often confused, but they serve different purposes. Teeth cleaning focuses on removing plaque and tartar. Whitening improves tooth color, while polishing smoothens the tooth surface and enhances shine. Most people benefit from a combination of all three, depending on their dental condition.

# Why You Should Visit a Dentist in Ahmedabad for These Treatments

A dentist ensures safe, effective, and long-lasting results with professional care.

A qualified **Dentist in Ahmedabad** uses proper tools, techniques, and hygiene standards that are not possible at home. Professional dental care reduces the risk of cavities, gum disease, and bad breath while giving you a brighter smile.

# Common Causes That Make Dental Cleaning and Whitening Necessary

Lifestyle habits and poor oral hygiene are the main reasons.

Several factors lead to stained or unhealthy teeth:

* Regular consumption of tea, coffee, or tobacco
* Poor brushing and flossing habits
* Plaque and tartar buildup
* Aging and enamel thinning
* Certain medications

Visiting a **Dental Clinic in Ahmedabad** helps address these issues early before they turn into serious dental problems.

# Symptoms That Indicate You Need Dental Cleaning or Whitening

Visible stains, bad breath, or bleeding gums are warning signs.

You may need to see a dentist if you notice:

* Yellow or brown stains on teeth
* Persistent bad breath
* Bleeding or swollen gums
* Tooth sensitivity
* Rough or sticky feeling on teeth

Ignoring these symptoms can lead to bigger issues, including gum infections and tooth decay.

# Types of Teeth Cleaning Procedures

The type depends on the level of plaque and gum condition.

Teeth cleaning is not the same for everyone. Common types include:

* Routine scaling for mild plaque
* Deep cleaning for gum pockets
* Periodic maintenance cleaning

A **Dentist in Ahmedabad** will examine your teeth and suggest the most suitable option.

# Types of Teeth Whitening Treatments

Whitening can be done in-clinic or with supervised home methods.

Teeth whitening options generally include:

* In-clinic whitening for faster results
* Take-home whitening kits guided by a dentist
* Combination treatments for stubborn stains

Professional whitening at a **Dental Clinic in Ahmedabad** is safer and more effective than over-the-counter products.

# What Is Teeth Polishing and Why It Matters

Polishing smoothens teeth and helps prevent future stains.

Teeth polishing is usually done after cleaning. It removes minor surface stains and smoothens the enamel, making it harder for plaque to stick. This step also gives teeth a clean and glossy appearance.

# Treatment Process at a Dental Clinic in Ahmedabad

The process is simple, painless, and usually completed in one visit.

A typical visit includes:

1. Oral examination
2. Scaling and cleaning
3. Polishing of teeth
4. Whitening, if required

Most procedures are comfortable and take between 30 to 90 minutes, depending on the treatment plan.

# Benefits of Teeth Cleaning, Whitening, and Polishing

These treatments improve oral health, confidence, and long-term dental safety.

Key benefits include:

* Removal of plaque and tartar
* Reduced risk of cavities and gum disease
* Brighter and cleaner smile
* Fresher breath
* Improved self-confidence

Regular visits to a **Dentist in Ahmedabad** help maintain these benefits over time.

# Cost of Teeth Cleaning, Whitening, and Polishing in Ahmedabad

Ahmedabad offers quality dental care at affordable prices.

The approximate costs at a [**Dental Clinic in Ahmedabad**](https://www.livejournal.com/away?to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.karnavatidentalcare.com%2Fchoose-right-dentist-for-your-dental-implants) are:

* Teeth cleaning: ₹800 to ₹2,000
* Teeth polishing: ₹500 to ₹1,500
* Teeth whitening: ₹5,000 to ₹15,000

Prices vary based on the clinic, technology used, and individual dental condition.

# Cost Comparison: Ahmedabad vs Other Cities

Dental treatments in Ahmedabad are more affordable than metro cities.

Compared to other major cities, Ahmedabad offers cost-effective dental care:

* Mumbai and Delhi usually charge 20–30% more
* Bangalore and Pune fall in a mid-range
* Ahmedabad provides similar quality at lower costs

This makes Ahmedabad a preferred choice for routine dental care and cosmetic treatments.

# Success Rate of Dental Cleaning and Whitening: Last Year Comparison

Professional dental treatments have a high success rate.

Based on last year’s general dental data:

* Teeth cleaning showed success rates above 95%
* Whitening treatments had around 90–92% satisfaction
* Polishing improved long-term cleanliness in over 93% of patients

In comparison, metro cities reported similar results, proving that a **Dentist in Ahmedabad** delivers outcomes on par with larger urban centers.

# Dental Implant Treatment in Ahmedabad and Its Connection to Oral Hygiene

Clean and healthy gums are essential for successful implants.

Good oral hygiene is critical before and after [**Dental Implant Treatment in Ahmedabad**](https://www.livejournal.com/away?to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.karnavatidentalcare.com%2Fdental-implants-treatment-in-ahmedabad). Teeth cleaning and gum care help:

* Reduce infection risk
* Improve implant success
* Maintain surrounding teeth health

Regular visits to a **Dental Clinic in Ahmedabad** ensure implants last longer and function properly.

# Preventive Care Tips After Treatment

Daily care and regular check-ups maintain results.

After cleaning or whitening:

* Brush twice daily with a soft toothbrush
* Floss regularly
* Avoid excessive tea, coffee, and tobacco
* Visit a dentist every six months

These habits help extend the benefits of your dental treatment.

# When Should You Visit a Dentist in Ahmedabad?

Every six months or whenever symptoms appear.

Routine check-ups help detect problems early. If you notice pain, bleeding gums, or stains, do not delay visiting a **Dental Clinic in Ahmedabad**.

# Final Thoughts

Teeth cleaning, whitening, and polishing are essential parts of modern dental care. They protect your oral health while improving the look of your smile. Choosing a reliable Dentist in Ahmedabad ensures safe treatment, affordable costs, and excellent results comparable to any major city.

https://preview.redd.it/ll1fbnrjd2gg1.png?width=922&format=png&auto=webp&s=c439156c685c2e541607b2b9b8aa2c839697db13

Lily would realize that Severus truly is honoring her wishes.... Unlike a certain someone. And she'd buy a bat. James would joke about Snivellus and Lily names her pet Sevvy. Coincidence? James thinks it's to spite him but she claims otherwise.

It would be even funnier that James would buy a dog and call it Tuney.... As in Petunia. And they'd go back and forth about this.

Meanwhile Petunia and Severus meet. He's doing some low end job in the muggle world to scrape some money and Petunia was on her way to see Vernon only to stumble across a familiar face.

She thought and accidentally mumbled ""That boy from that place.""

""Habits die hard don't they, Petunia?"" He'd snarl, lowering his hat to storm off.

She'd frown ""I know!""

He hurries to shield from the rain. Petunia grabs his hand and squeezes the wrist for the man to look at her. Demanding it. ""I know I had bad habits, but you two-""

""I don't want to start a blame game now, Petunia. You've heard from your sister didn't you?"" Petunia walks ahead of him. She looks back with a questionable frown.

Her light hair stuck to her face. ""Heard what?""

Severus opens the door for her and takes out a chair for her to sit down. ""Your sister and I aren't talking. I said a bad wo- No, I called her that awful slur and we kind of drifted apart after that.""

Petunia notes her coffee down to the barrista and he does for him too. Not missing the pink dusted on his slightly hollow cheekbones. ""She- we can be fiery. It's an inheritant trait. I lost count on how many times our mom made our dad sleep on the sofa.""

""Sure...."" He'd think to himself riddled with doubt. For him, it was the other way around. His mom wasn't allowed to sleep with his dad and was often curled outside their bedroom. Like... Like a dog, he treated his wife like a dog. Severus would softly open his door and invite his mom inside. His bed too small and thin.

She'd shush him as she laid on the floor, patting his stomach for comfort. Until Hogwarts, he'd hold his mom's hand occasionally to fall asleep. ""I mean it... But I'm sure an apology fixed it.""

""That word breaks friendships.""

Petunia sighs ""Of course it does.""

""I feel like you aren't taking it seriously.""

""I take nothing of your world really seriously, Severus. Your world is awful, not you. You're alright I guess but your world? No. Full of injustice and unfairness.""

Snape's features hardened ""Not true.""

""Is it? Apparently, a word is so awful there but it somehow got to kids to say. And I heard bits of Lily about purebloods and some dirty kid stalking her. That she likes that kid! God! I don't know how our parents heard that horror tale and saw the romance."" He smiles because she probably means Potter.

He can't deny it either. Lots of injustice and unfairness runs loose and they focus on the wrong bud to nip. ""Lots of things happen. You were in a hurry somewhere?""

""Ugh, some date. A rich man.""

Evans, Lily went for the rich guy, Petunia too. Life is a hustle, he knows. ""Thanks for listening to me.""

They got their coffee and looked at the clock. Like a silent agreement they kept on talking. ""I can bring you to your date later if you want.""

""No need... I can reach it myself.""

""I know you can. Nothing is amiss to assist you though.""

Petunia stares at him ""You assisting me?"" She did notice how naturally he acted when he held the door open and took out her chair. It's been a while to have met a man like him.

""Yes. Nothing wrong with that."" Yeah, that was strange. Petunia thought. Men would be so busy doing all the work to take credit for it. Never put themselves down by willingly saying they are *just* *assisting* a woman.

Her lips touch her coffee. She isn't drinking it. Just... Staring at him. He is rather attractive isn't he? Ink black hair pin straight to the shoulders. Thin, yes and not the tallest but towering above her anyway. Great manners. Knows her a little bit not completely. Lily had always been that possessive friend. What's hers is hers, she wasn't keen on sharing and... She did make a wrong impression on Severus, of course the kid will much rather hang out with someone who didn't ridicule his poverty.

Great manners, respectful towards women.... All women? She wasn't as good looking as her sister. She feels the treatment towards her and her sister. From outside it looks like almost nothing. But once in, it feels like you're repairiring a sinking broken ship while the other ship is well made, even looking expensive and getting gifts.

Best to leave her home, get married and live as far as possible from her family. Especially a house that gets male visitors who saw Lily once and wanted to date her thus visited their home by following one of them. ""How is your life going, Petunia?""

""So so, nothing interesting.""

""School, university?""

""I finished my college, but that's it.""

He looks happy, she shifts a bit uncomfortable in her seat. ""Technical college?""

""Wow"" is all he said. She knew the tones too well. That undignified *wow* the men she met would say. He wasn't one of them. He sounded genuinely surprised. ""I heard it's one of the toughest types of colleges. What course did you do there? ""

She couldn't help choosing that. It sounded extremely interesting and if her parents gave her 1-theme oriented compliments, it's drawing. She was good at drawing. Her teacher said she was very good at memorizing. Since Lily wasn't with them and dad didn't have a son, she earned pocket money from being with her dad. Doing stupid car stuff. She'd always sit there, with a frown, arms crossed, when she could have dressed hot, serving ice cream to get her cruch his attention. But no!

She was stuck with a stupid unfair old man, dirtying her blond her with oil. But her mom said a hurtful thing that changed her attitude ""You're not pretty nor talented as your little sister, you should be smarter.""

And that also got buried when Lily came home with her im-the-brightest-witch shite. Whoever gave her that title was probably just as dumb as that rock. ""Technical drawing in Paddington college.""

""I knew it"" she looks offended when he suddenly raised his voice.

He even began to hiss ""I knew you would do that""

""Calm down, no need to be angry.""

""I'm not angry. I'm proud...."" She smiles.

""Proud of myself"" her smile fades.

""For predicting that. You were so good at drawing. You even fixed my bike.""

""It was my old bike.""

""That I got from your mom."" She laughs and so does he.

""That's a new one."" She covers her mouth while laughing. ""Proud of yourself for predicting my future.""

""Yes, Lily, your parents called me insane that I said you would go for that. It wasn't really.... Feminine according to him. But if I know something. Feminism changes like beauty. In the eye of the beholder. But it shouldn't. It should always stay that one true meaning. That is the one thing that shouldn't be molded according to someone's wishes."" She hasn't even met a man that spoke of feminism. She met the guy she was hurrying to.

Promising her a nice life and that she could relax as he brought in the money. That would mean she'd need to have hobbies. Her life trickled down to hobbies. What else? ""Thank you.""

""For what?""

""Apparently, you were the only one that believed in me."" Her own parents didn't give her the attention of the day but they were there when she was at her lowest. Lily didn't even have her lowest.

""No, no, Lily did eventually believe me."" He was even nice for trying to cheer her up. Awkwardly petting her hand. He wasn't that comfortable around women, it was clear as day.

She wouldn't want to go to her home and insisted on going to Severus. He told her that he had to finish work first and she waited and waited. She wanted to stay with him more. Some nasty thing told her only dogs wait for a man. Women don't chase. She looks too desperate. Until a blanket was draped over her shoulders and guys whistled when Severus did that. ""Stop doing that you neanthertals. This is common sense.""

The guy swoons ""Sure it is common sense to look after your wife\~ Miss Snape must be happy."" Petunia's skin got heated.

She was sad it wasn't his jacket, but an office blanket. On their way home, she couldn't help but ask ""Why did you not give me your jacket?""

""Petunia, my jacket has so many holes and smells like cigarettes no matter how much I wash it. Not even magic can rescue that poor case. Why should I put that filthy thing on you?""

""Oh""

""Are you asking these questions as an interest to date me?""

""You're not using magic on me to get in my brain are you?""

""No, but what I do know is what is the hottest issue of how to scout men.""

She looks wary now ""Fine, it is that. You're just so different. Good different and I know we had our problems. It might be even awkward for you to be even near me after that whole thing with Lily.""

You judged good, we could be friends now Petunia. No need to rush things... I need a friend now.""

Wasn't what she went for but maybe she should do it differently this time. And as time went on, touches became natural. Hugs, conversations, then they became a set. Kissing and she was teaching him the whole beauty routine she drowned herself in.

Severus became even better looking than her! Why does a man even need such long eyelashes!? She'd fume while curling his. She'd see blokes staring at him. But he was hers and she was his. She went further with studying as he opened his shop and she created items to help with gardening and giving plants more potential for growth.

Putting her technical skills in use. It made great advertisements for others to see the work of hers do great in action. His shop became famous as her works raked in money. She'd laugh in his arms ""What's so funny? ""

""I won't tell"" she teases.

""I'll use my magic on you."" He'd whisper.

She gets that devious look ""Please do\~""

He gets serious ""I won't, you're carrying our child.""

""Fine, I was laughing that our family remained dating rich guys."" She almost went with Vernon, lily went with James and she is now with Severus. A famous potions master.

""You're rich too, love. Remember? You got us all famous to begin with."" She slaps herself on the chest.

""That's true, only needed you to say that, so you know it too."" He laughs as she turns and he hugs her from behind. She bit her bottom lip. She really hit it well. She's so proud of herself to find such a great man. The letters of Lily keep piling up. Angry that she got married without being invited. Petunia didn't want her there, Snape didn't either.

It was the best. There was bound to be drama. And it was their day. She didn't even involve her parents and Severus didn't have parents nor did they have friends. It was *their* wedding. Lily wants to meet for dinner. She too now has a little one growing the same as her. But Severus stood behind her and when things got too much he would tell her so.

Vice versa. It was the best for them all. Severus did say they should talk but only after the baby has been delivered. Now it could cause too much stress. He also said to calm her sister down by sending her a letter that they could talk but only after their son is born. She found it adorable that he wanted a girl, you don't hear many of those.

Most of the time, a boy is desired first to protect the family. It was sweet until he shared why. Who wouldn't want a girl first after being beaten down by men the whole time.... But he's not like that, thankfully. She feels tears well up in her eyes as she tries to sleep. Kissing his hand. He kisses hers too ""What's wrong? ""

""Can't sleep. I am just happy we're alright. We are happy. I thought of you dying."" She cries.

""Awh pumpkin, I won't die. I won't leave you and our boy. It alright. It will all be alright."" She heard how his mom was treated by his dad. You wouldn't even guess that from the way he treats her.

He picked a book a book from his drawer and she beging to giggle ""No, not a bedtime story.""

""But our sonny is making mummy so sad, he must need a bedtime story.""

""Sev, at least read me a proper bedtime story. Not your magical herbology book. I barely get half those words."" She pouts.

He kisses her pouting lips. ""All the better, Tuney.""

He begins to read the ingredients and it does make her feel drowsy until she drifts away in her sleep. He hears her snoring and puts away the book. Turns off the light and spoons her from behind. Him, dying? Seems like a far nightmarish fantasy.

 \-----------

Petunia was on her way to meet Vernon but accidentally bumped into Severus and they kind of talked about things. It wasn't immediately heavy, glossing over facts. Lily Severus grew apart, and he put himself down by saying he called her a mudblood. Later however, petunia would hear the full story and get angry at Lily, but this wasn't really an entire fic but a writing prompt to get into deeper details.

Another niche I'd like to add was

When Lily and James did come over, petunia would get angry at James his laziness and jobless behavior. At least try something? Their war has already ended. And Lily would blame Severus for this bad start. He must've only said bad things about James. Petunia would get so angry at that and get in between the two of them. Threatening her sister to never talk to Severus that way again, and matter of fact, he didn't say anything bad about James. On the contrary, he spoke limited good things about James. His stubbornness, his athletic build, his social skills, and James would perk up. Why?

1) Snivellus spoke kindly of him

2) he wasn't wrong

3) but it's Snivellus that said that.

Lily, at a loss for words and wrong again with her assumptions. Sit LS back down. Petunia on the other hand opens their door ""Get out, both of you.""

Lily looks taken back ""Why?""

""Not only are you wrong for accusing my husband like that! You don't even apologize. Get out.""

Lily wanted to apologize but the word verbally weren't there. She never had to. Her parents would easily forgive her... And thinking about it. If her sister demanded an apology, their parents would talk lily out of giving one. She left when James wanted to stay. But James didn't want to leave yet. The dinner was delicious and well... If Severus could see good in him, he could try to establish something? Betrayed by this, petunia slams the door in her face, giving no time for further discussions. Back home, James and Lily fought again for the umpteenth time.

He'd call her predictable because both knew how she couldn't handle being kicked out and not him this urged him to get home sooner.

**Ps:**

**I hate petunia. I hate her. I hate the way she treats Harry. But I do have a thing for people that hurt James and Lily. She hurt Lily well I guess, at least, I'm filling the blanks, let me be delusional.**

**Also, this was written before harry was born obviously and without Vernon or Dudley in the picture. Before James and Lily soured her view on magical people. And I haven't written Petunia and Severus before as a couple I guess.... I surprised myself with this to be honest. It was only meant as a joke post. Lily with her make-believe Severus after their friendship break-up. But then I continued to write, and write. Until I got this story.**

**Hope it's something. Otherwise, just focus on the joke with James getting a dog and that's it.**

Before I book flights, I just wanted to ask for your perspective about what we can realistically to be open considering the holidays, and would appreciate any and all advice! 

We are mainly concerned with exploring your beautiful city, visiting the Fanstoft Stave Church, visiting Vik/ The Sognefjord or Hardangerfjorden (would love some input here as to which is better for a quick trip) as well as soaking up the vibes of the city with many coffees, and a few evening beers. 

Would this be possible from Easter Thursday to Sunday? What restrictions could we expect? We don’t expect the place to be bustling as it’s the holidays and that kind of sounds nice - a quieter weekend away :)

And as a extra ask - if any one has any tips for an avid heavy metal fan visiting your city I would appreciate it 🤘

She has a pretty strong language barrier, but I always tried my best , sometimes  even using a translator just so we could talk properly.

Another thing: before she even moved here, she had already started some kind of relationship with this guy in this country  online who reached out to her on a language learning app. Bit bizarre but is what it is.

She’s Japanese, and he is obsessed with the  country she is from. He didn’t help her learn English at all. He insisted they speak Japanese only (he’s not Japanese  he’s Indian, but obsessed with Japan and pushy about moving there), so her English didn’t improve at all over the span of a year. After six months living here, she still struggled and couldn't hold a conversation in english because he never encouraged her. I tried recommending English shows, interviews, things to help her feel more integrated, because she genuinely wanted to learn and couldnt jobseek as a result. I did my best so she felt like home here.

Anyway, He lied to her about having money, having his own company and a lot more  She found out he actually works part-time in a coffee shop and has nothing to his name so they broke up.  I think he lied to make her interested but no idea. I told her I was always suspicious of him and that it annoyed me he didn’t help her with English, because it just felt like he was keeping her in a bubble. Its like he isolated her in a way? He never helped her fit into society. Or helped her find friends. Social groups. Nothing.

I later found that she went back to dating him secretly. When she told me, she stated she wasnt happy that I  suspected him and my comments from when they broke up and was a bit grumpy I said these things about her boyfriend and called him the best person in her life and her number one. I felt weird and honestly didn’t want to be involved in the whole situation anymore. Or with her. I tried so hard to help her feel like she belonged but i felt like i did it for nothing..

When her birthday came around, I had already planned  something beforehand which she knew about, so I still followed through and knew i couldnt distance myself yet. I told her to step outside her room cause I had a surprise she knew about , and I decorated her wall with balloons and banners and got her a cake. But while I was decorating, she was stressed , saying she doesn’t trust people in her room. I don’t even know why she agreed to it if she felt like that maybe she realised halfway through she couldn’t handle it. Or maybe its because she was deep down irritated with me still?

She then saw the surprise and smiled but i couldnt help feel a bit shitty of what she had been reacting moments before..

Since then it’s been a few months, and when she reached out again I replied but I was really blunt. I didn't wanna talk to her :( but she mustve thought we were good after last time. So I do wonder if im being an ass by just silently removing myself

""Harry!"" Umbridge shouts. ""Harry James Potter!""

He remains silent. ""I need those names! Who is helping you? ""

Cornelius nods ""Just those names and I'll take care of them.""

Harry looks up at them with a sin-free face ""I don't know miss. I'm sorry.""

She smiles at him. Ever so awry, as if a smile itself refused to be part of her face. Her eyes wishing it could turn those green pair into acid, the way she gazes into them. ""Such a silly name right? The Three Musketeers. What in Niffler's name is that muggle rubbish even doing in our world.""

Fudge agrees. But he knew Harry. Brute force doesn't work. ""Three names, Harry.""

Albus arrived on time with Arthur. Cornelius and Umbridge rounded their interrogation against their will and left. ""Did you get everything you need, Fudge?""

""I did, thank you for your time and understanding."" Sounded nothing but bitter.

Arthur left with them and Albus had this twinkle in his eyes. ""The three Musketeers, eh? That's a nice name.""

Harry laughs ""It was all against his will.""

""The one that taught you occlumency? I'm amazed be can handle those two.""

""He can handle them well."" At the moment the door flew open. Severus Snape towering at the entrance. Evident on his face that he just met that troll of a woman.

Remus behind him and Sirius not much behind him. ""I assume, you succeeded your task, Potter?""

Harry ran up to him for a hug ""I did.""

Severus pries him away and hands the child to whoever was closest to him. And if it wasn't for Merlin's will of grace, Remus would be in him. Remus held Harry ""You feel calm and proud. That's good. That's a good change."" He looks at Snape warily until Sirius yanked him away.

""You didn't hit them, which is a bummer but you still angered them. A real Potter here."" The boy feels stifled in his uncle's hug. Remus did sound nicer but the compliment felt backhanded. Proud and calm, unlike his dad.

Severus stood behind Albus. Reading everything he was writing. Before the other two could read it, the letter was gone. Snape wasn't keen on sharing his stuff with the other two. But the other two couldnt help but share their Intel with him. Harry didn't know how this man kept them in line.

Three protective men, protective over him. Felt like two uncles and one aunt. Severus from his mother's side. While Remus and Sirius rooted from his father's side. Snape wasn't well liked in the school but the teachers didn't say anything when it came to him.

He was good with each of them. Flitwick still helps Severus with Charms, which was Lily her best subjects. He is on friendly terms with Pomona, it only grew as he brew potions from her products. Pomfrey has an almost nurturing air around Severus. Helping him whenever she could. Filch even, yes, *that* Filch, helps him. Hagrid and Severus have mutual respect for one another. Binns adores him and madame Hooch is on friendly terms with the man.

What Harry didn't know was that Severus made with left overs amazing tonics for professor Sprout. Severus helped Flitwick with the means of Dark Arts. Hagrid and Severus were both being wrongly done by another house. Severus helps Filch with cleaning and keeping sure the rules aren't broken. People always made fun of Filch his talentless self, they would think twice before crossing Snape. Teachers like Binns and Minerva, keen on succession of kids, adore him a lot with the obvious raise in students their grades with potions. Pomfrey often took are of a sick or wounded Severus. It was the small things that counted.

He wasn't the biggest supporter of new incompetent teachers. Those are Remus and Lockhart. He's distant, strict, calculating, and even Sirius nor Remus complained of his existence. But he remembered the day he saw his leg being stitched by Filch. Remus brought Harry to his class. Minerva was already explaining things. Hermione and Ron brightened, moved aside for him to sit in the middle. ""I forgot to thank professor Snape. I couldn't have done it without his lessons.""

Remus smiles and ruffles his hair ""Don't worry about that lad. I'll make sure to tell him that.""

Sirius was staring out of the window alone. He wasn't alone first. He stood next to Severus. A man he cannot understand and neither does he allow it. ""Three Musketeers."" It was his idea. Some old sodding book he snatched out of Severus his home. It sounded like them.

Solving things, using violence if necessary to protect the child. Well, Severus does that. Sirius on the other hand joined OOTP because that took hunting the Slytherins even further and more fun. Remus kind of is there, does it because he starves otherwise. Infuriatingly, it's always Severus that goes above and beyond with his fancy potions and spells.

Remus grabs him by the shoulder. ""What are you doing!?""

""I'm thinking.""

""Your hand is bleeding!"" He looks at his hand and gasps, letting go of the broken mug that he brought for Severus. Hand of his all torn and red.

Remus sees it and wanted to heal it but the ghost of an heir refused his help. That's when he utters ""He has no other classes today.""

And Sirius stops. Stops moving, it even looked like he stopped breathing. Severus is in his room. Each teacher has a tiny apartment with a bathroom, bed, table, hobby room and a living-room. Now, he's sitting in the bathtub. One of the few luxuries he gives himself after a good day. Harry did well. Another obstacle is overcome, and he learnt another useful spell.

He scoops the bubbles and places them on his shoulders, lost in thoughts. Is he doing enough? How much is enough? He doesn't want Harry to make the same mistakes he did, and disappoint his mother. She always did hate Dark Arts. Didn't stop him from studying it. Thankfully, it's useful. But she'd only get angrier at him for involving her son in such rubbish.

A hand on his knee startles him. ""Severus""

""What do you want, Black!"" He saw the man's eyes. Same eyes as his child self. Immoral and deranged.

Sirius his hand slips further in his inner thigh ""We... We did it yesterday, wasn't that enough?""

The man nearly growls, moving closer to Severus as the hand only lowers and lowers. Blood spreading and tainting clean bath water. Fingertips grazing over the sensitive suction marks and the outlines of bitemarks. ""If only you didn't taste so divine, Snivellus.""

Predicting the punch of Severus, deflecting it and lifting him out of the tub. Carrying an angry him to the bed then threw him on it. Severus opens his eyes, Remus was there now too. ""Snape, can we? We will be gentle this time.""

""You never are!""

Sirius his hairy body was pricking against his wet skin. ""You promised.""

""But you're abusing this! It was supposed to be a one time favor! One at a time! You use me all the time, both of you at the same time."" He is turned over. Sirius was pinning him down but Remus pulled him from underneath him.

Cradling a man crying and yelling about all this unfairness. ""Use us. That's the deal. We give you, us. You give yourself to us. We will do anything for you, Severus. Anything. We keep Harry safe alongside you. We deserve this.""

It was a stupid deal. He thought he could have his own two personal assistants. The same way Voldemort and Albus used him. Why did it feel that he was at a disadvantage now... But, Remus was right. Harry was now safe. Safer than before.

Sirius laps his tongue against his nape. Sensitive with scars. ""Alright, alright, you can have me. B-mmph""

Remus tackles him. Shoving his tongue inside the raven's mouth. He felt Sirius his member hardened against his back. Black's hands cups his front. Couldn't help but become erect in his hands. Remus places saliva on his fingers to loosen the ring. ""Were you already loosening yourself?"" He shares.

Sirius laughs ""You slut""

""I wasnt. After yesterday, I was using an ointment and I was.... I was... Was scraping out just now."" Remus frees his penis. Lining it up with the pinkish pucker.

""Don't feel ashamed, it's endearing if anything."" Snape gasps and claws at his back with the fat head pushing through. His legs locked around the man.

Sirius didn't want to be left behind. Pulling those two apart, too busy with kissing and being pounded. ""I know you hate me but for Godrick's sake don't leave my cock hanging."" He puts his cock right beside Snape's head.

""Either this mouth, or your ass.""

""M-mouth.""

He didn't know why Sirius was like this. So... So awful. He knew how Sirius thought about Remus. For a spineless prick, he sure got greedy in bed. Sirius was just as much of a taker as Remus... And he? He was a giver. ""I think, after days of sex. You must be loose enough for two.""

He pushes Severus up against Remus, going at it like there was no tomorrow ""Wait! Please wait, Bl-""

The head pressed against his entrance ""Sirius! Call me Sirius, not that filthy awful surname!""

Severus sniffles and lays his head on Remus. Hugging him closer to his chest. ""Sirius, I can't handle two of your shitty monstrous cocks. Use my mouth."" His body felt excited to be used to this extent.

Being attractive wasn't part of him. Much less sex. He lost all types of first times with these two, including his virginity. Sirius bit his ear. He felt the sneer the heir beared against his skin ""No need to be that cute.""

""I'm not!"" Seconds later, the air is knocked out of his lungs when Sirius entered. Saliva spilling from the corner of his mouth. Moaning while his body adjusting to take both. Remus hisses at the pressure. Sirius made a new mark on unmarked skin.

Twisting Snape's head for a kiss. ""Kisses tightens your hole. Do you love those?""

He nods absent mindely. Remus licks his sweat on his neck. Mere graze of nis teeth against the apple stiffened him. Remembering the day he nearly was snapped in half if it weren't for Potter. They found their rhythm within him. He tries to touch his but Sirius grabs his arms away. Remus looks up at him, all compassionate whilst murmuring lovingly ""No jacking off for you today, coming without assistance of any hands.... You deserve that dont you love? Ignoring us all day.""

""I already see yo-Ah... Y-your face in my - hmph- my house. No need to see it outside.""

""Wrong answer."" His hair is pulled. Exposing his alabaster column. Remus began to break rules. Leaving marks in places there shouldn't be marks.

Remus laid down with Severus in between them. His own cock pressed and rubbing against Remus his pubic hairline. The pace quickened and the moans hastened. Sirius holds both the raven's arms on his back. Making sure, they aren't used. Merlin, if he knew Severus was this much of a freak back then, he wouldn't have bothered with others.

But he's here now, in their arms. Bucking his hips against them. Remus his hands kneading the flesh of his ass, making sure it took everything of him with each thrust. That his cock could get deep and nestle inside whenever. Severus his head laid on Remus his chest. Coming all together. Sirius circled his hips against Snape. Hand prints on the buttocks. Remus left a mark there. Severus breathes heavily. ""I have to shower all over again.""

""We aren't done. Were not done for a long time. Thankfully you have the whole day off."" Remus whispered. They took their cocks out and looked at their work. He was embarrassed by it. Their strange and obscure habits. How do they even come up with such strange ways to humiliate?

They laid next to him. Until they were well rested enough to go again, and again. Felt like hours. He couldn't even eat dinner. They brought it to him. He begs them to not go again. From that begging alone they got hard. But wouldn't do anything if he showered with them and slept in between them.

He was theirs, wasn't he? How were they, his? Sirius and Remus made sure Harry was asleep and made their rounds in the castle when it was Snape his shift. Making rounds in even dangerous spots they knew as children.

\-

Harry saw Severus. Remus offering him toast with jam and black coffee as Sirius prepared his class. They did a lot for him and around him. He wonders how his professor could even keep those two in line. Sirius laughs when he thinks of the name. The Three Musketeers. Severus is on his lap, grading the papers. ""Two swords on top of one sword.""

""What are you yammering about... Sirius.""

""Nothing. Just thinking of how adorable you are.""

""Using me, very funny.""

""You're using us, Severus. My house, my wealth, my riches-""

""For your godson""

""Lily, you do it for her.""

""And you do it for your buried friend.""

""More or less"" he murmurs. Harry wasn't like James. No point then. Then again, he is like Severus. Snarky and snapping at everything.

Remus brought them some refreshments and began to grade his papers too. Across Severus. ""I'll do anything for you love. Anything."" Lupin answers. Having heard their conversation partially.

""You do things for me, and I let you fuck me in return. What even- leave it. I'm not interested to know how twisted your egos are to see yourself on top of me.""

Remus his eyes flashed dangerously, like a knife glinting in ominous light. ""Harry dearest had been wondering how you keep us in control. Can't tell him now, can we? ""

""No! Of course not. He's a child.""

He leans back into Sirius and sighs. It was a mess. That is one thing he agrees with. Sirius puts his arms around Snape ""We care about you. Only you.""

""And Harry""

""And Harry of course.""

**Ps:**

**I adore the electricity when Snape is all brooding and mean but somehow he has two loyal dogs following him. People would assume he threatened them or something. Instead, they settled on screwing him for their partnership. It is secretive, delicious, and unpredictable. Well, unpredicted to the characters, not to me, the writer. But you get my point right? He has a leash on them but doesn't believe he does.**

**How is it really going on behind closed doors?**

**Also, Sirius here is using polyjuice potions as a flight instructor to have now more eyes on Harry. Only Harry, Albus, Remus and Severus know it is Sirius and he changes back whenever he can through sheer will and talents of shapeshifting. Nobody can disturb them during coupling and Snape paying off their assistance in the form of sex.**

**He doesn't act bratty on purpose by ignoring them. He just simply lived long enough without them and doesn't truly need them. Until they took his shifts and he fell asleep after a long time. He was so well rested, he didn't wake up the following day but the following night. Each teacher had their own room. But they slowly infiltrated his room. Severus was theirs. In ways more than one. But he had them before any of this. He had them since Hogwarts without knowing that.**

**That's why they both died earlier than Severus. He deserved to live longer. Severus would look at Harry. He didn't see Lily nor James. But the hard work of him, Remus and Sirius. Their hard work breathing. Hopefully until old age.**

However, I only smoke once a day, with my morning coffee, and then I don't smoke anything else for the rest of the day. And my face is still much worse; I look like a zombie, and my face is lifeless. When I stop smoking, everything returns to normal.

Interestingly, I can lead a healthy lifestyle, sleep many hours, use facial creams, exercise, eat healthily, and take vitamins, but if I smoke, it doesn't help at all. Only quitting nicotine improves the appearance of my face.",2,1769594537.0,QuitVaping,2,1.0,False
1qp7ahq,https://chuffed.org/project/ferdi,Save Ferdinand ♥️,"Please help us out with Ferdinand! Buy him a coffee!

We are a small, privately-run animal sanctuary in Australia. Our neighbours breed cows and recently acquired Ferdinand, who after several interactions with him, felt he was too aggressive and more trouble than he's worth. So they decided to sell him on to the local meatworks. 

Ferdinand, a solid unit of a bull, managed to jump the fence into our property, where we found him quietly resting with our horses a few mornings ago. Upon learning his intended fate, we could not let him be taken back; especially after his own gallant effort to save his life.

Our neighbours have kindly agreed to give us one month to come up with the same price they would get for him at market which is $3000. So far, he has been a right gentleman; calm, respectful, can be hand fed, and has been no trouble at all. Truly a pacifist bull.

We need $3000 so he can live the rest of his life safely within the sanctuary.

100% of donations are for his purchase price. Anything we get on top of that will be used for his purposes; food, fencing improvements if required for him, worming etc.  

Rather than his body parts being separated and sold as meat, we've decided that for a donation, people can choose to ""adopt"" a part of him to keep him alive – so far, his eyes, nose, stomach and (because, of course, Australia) balls are spoken for.

So if you've always wanted to adopt a part of a bull, now is your chance!

1qp77jr,https://i.redd.it/xp2v28evb2gg1.jpeg,Looking for free link to this book! Marrying my Runaway Groom’s Powerful Father.,"🌺 BLURB 🌺

I was sitting in the Presidential Suite of The Pierre, wearing a Vera Wang gown worth more than most people earn in a decade. It was supposed to be the wedding of the century, the final move to merge two of Manhattan's most powerful empires.

Then my phone buzzed. It was an Instagram Story from my fiancé, Jameson. He was at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris with a caption that read: ""Fuck the chains. Chasing freedom."" He hadn't just gotten cold feet; he had abandoned me at the altar to run across the world.

My father didn't come in to comfort me. He burst through the door roaring about a lost acquisition deal, telling me the Holland Group would strip our family for parts if the ceremony didn't happen by noon. My stepmother wailed about us becoming the laughingstock of the Upper East Side. The Holland PR director even suggested I fake a ""panic attack"" to make myself look weak and sympathetic to save their stock price. Then Jameson’s sleazy cousin, Pierce, walked in with a lopsided grin, offering to ""step in"" and marry me just to get his hands on my assets.

I looked at them and realized I wasn't a daughter or a bride to anyone in that room. I was a failed asset, a bouncing check, a girl whose own father told her to go to Paris and ""beg"" the man who had just publicly humiliated her.

The girl who wanted to be loved died in that mirror. I realized that if I was going to be sold to save a merger, I was going to sell myself to the one who actually controlled the money.

I marched past my parents and walked straight into the VIP holding room. I looked the most powerful man in the room—Jameson’s cold, ruthless uncle, Fletcher Holland—dead in the eye and threw the iPad on the table.

""Jameson is gone,"" I said, my voice as hard as stone. ""Marry me instead.""

🌺 CHAPTER 1 🌺

The lipstick was a shade called ""Virgin Red,"" a cruel joke Estella Holcomb didn't find funny as she sat before the vanity in the Presidential Suite of The Pierre. The makeup artist's hand hovered, the brush trembling slightly, waiting for Estella to stop staring at her own reflection.

But Estella couldn't look away. The woman in the mirror was perfect. Too perfect. The Vera Wang gown, a cloud of silk and hand-stitched lace worth more than most people earned in a decade, seemed to be swallowing her whole. Her dark hair was pinned up in a structure that felt less like a hairstyle and more like a cage.

She felt a storm brewing in her gut. Not the nervous flutter of a bride, but the heavy, suffocating drop in pressure that precedes a hurricane.

On the marble countertop, her phone began to vibrate. It buzzed against the cold stone, a harsh, mechanical sound that cut through the soft classical music playing in the suite. The screen lit up.

Nina. Her assistant.

The door to the suite didn't open; it burst inward. Nina stood there, her face drained of blood, her chest heaving as if she had run up all thirty-nine floors. She had forgotten to knock. Nina never forgot to knock.

Estella watched Nina's reflection in the mirror. The makeup artist pulled the brush back, sensing the shift in the air.

""Miss Holcomb,"" Nina choked out. She didn't come closer. She held out an iPad like it was a bomb she was afraid to detonate.

Estella turned slowly. The silk of her dress rustled, a sound like dry leaves. She reached out and took the device. Her fingers were steady, though her heart had begun to hammer a frantic rhythm against her ribs.

The screen displayed Instagram. A Story update.

It was Jameson.

The photo was grainy, filtered in black and white to look artistic, but the location tag was crystal clear: Charles de Gaulle Airport, Paris.

The caption was short. Fuck the chains. Chasing freedom.

A high-pitched ringing started in Estella's ears. It was a physical sensation, like a needle piercing her eardrum. The room tilted. Her lungs seized, refusing to draw in air. Chasing freedom.

He wasn't just late. He wasn't cold-footed. He was gone.

Estella closed her eyes for a second, forcing the air into her chest. She visualized the iPad shattering against the wall, the glass spraying like diamonds. But she didn't throw it. She lowered the device to the table and pressed the power button, plunging the screen into darkness.

""Get out,"" she whispered to the makeup artist. The woman didn't need to be told twice; she grabbed her kit and fled.

Before the door could click shut, it was thrown open again. This time, the intrusion was violent.

Richard Holcomb, her father, stormed in. Sweat beaded on his forehead, ruining the line of his expensive toupee. He looked manic.

""Where is he?"" Richard roared. He didn't look at his daughter; he looked around the room as if Jameson might be hiding under the sofa. ""Tell me you know where he is, Estella! The acquisition deal is contingent on this marriage! If this wedding doesn't happen by noon, the Holland Group triggers the default clause on the holding company! They will strip us for parts!""

Susan, her stepmother, trailed behind him, wringing her hands. Her face was a mask of selfish terror. ""We're ruined,"" she wailed, her voice grating. ""The press is downstairs. The entire Upper East Side is drinking our champagne. We're going to be the laughingstock of Manhattan!""

Estella looked at them. Really looked at them.

They didn't see a daughter whose heart had just been publicly ripped out. They saw a failed asset. They saw a bouncing check.

A wave of nausea rolled through her, followed by a cold, clarifying anger. She straightened her spine, the corset of the dress acting as armor.

The Holland family's PR Director, a woman named Sharon who looked like she chewed glass for breakfast, entered the room, flanked by two grim-faced lawyers.

""We need a statement,"" Sharon said, her voice clipped. ""We'll go with sudden illness. Food poisoning. Or perhaps a panic attack on the bride's part. It makes you look sympathetic, Estella.""

""Sympathetic?"" Estella laughed. The sound was brittle. ""It makes me look weak. And it makes the Holland stock price plummet when the market opens on Monday because everyone will know the heir is unstable.""

Richard grabbed Estella's wrist. His grip was wet and desperate. ""You have to go to Paris. Chase him down. Beg him if you have to.""

Estella looked down at her father's hand. His fingers were digging into her skin, leaving red marks that would bruise. She felt the revulsion rise in her throat like bile. She yanked her arm back.

""Don't touch me,"" she said, her voice dropping an octave.

""We have a Plan B,"" a voice said from the doorway.

One of the Holland board members stepped aside. Pierce Holland walked in. Jameson's cousin. He was wearing a tuxedo that fit too tightly across his chest, and his eyes were already glassy with pre-wedding scotch. He looked at Estella, his gaze raking over her exposed shoulders with a slimy familiarity.

""I'm ready to step in,"" Pierce said, a lopsided grin plastering his face. He moved toward her, his intent clear. ""Someone has to save the day, right, cuz? I've always liked your... assets.""

He reached out to touch her shoulder.

Estella took a step back. Her heel caught in the tulle, but she didn't stumble. She looked at Pierce, a man who had spent his life living off the scraps of the main family line, a man who viewed her as nothing more than a warm body attached to a trust fund.

This was the trap. If she didn't act, she would be sold off to the lowest bidder to save her father's skin.

""Where is he?"" Estella asked. Her voice cut through the room, silencing Susan's sobbing.

Sharon blinked. ""Jameson is in Paris, Miss Holcomb. We just established that.""

""Not the boy,"" Estella said. Her eyes were hard, dry, and terrifyingly clear. ""The man who actually runs the money. Where is Fletcher Holland?""

The name sucked the oxygen out of the room. Richard paled. Even Pierce took a step back, his grin faltering.

""Mr. Holland is in the VIP holding room downstairs,"" Sharon stammered. ""He's waiting for the ceremony to begin.""

Estella reached down and gathered the heavy satin skirt of her dress. She turned to the mirror one last time. She didn't adjust her hair. She didn't fix her lipstick. She just stared into her own eyes and killed the girl who had wanted to be loved.

""Get out of my way,"" she said to her parents.

She pushed past them, ignoring their shouts, and walked out of the suite. She marched down the hallway to the elevator, the silk train hissing against the carpet like a snake.

As the elevator doors slid shut, cutting off the sight of her chaotic family, Estella caught her reflection in the polished brass.

""If I have to sell myself,"" she whispered to the empty car, ""I'm selling to the one who writes the checks.""

\---

🌺 CHAPTER 2 🌺

Estella stepped out of the elevator. Two men in dark suits, built like linebackers, stood in front of the double mahogany doors at the end of the corridor. They crossed their arms as she approached, their earpieces coiling down their necks.

""Private area, Miss Holcomb,"" one of them rumbled. ""Mr. Holland is not to be disturbed.""

Estella didn't slow down. She didn't blink. She walked straight toward them, the white dress billowing around her like a storm cloud.

""Tell him his stock portfolio depends on opening this door,"" she said. ""Or get out of my way. I don't have time for muscle.""

The guard hesitated. In that split second of indecision, the handle of the mahogany door turned from the inside. A frantic-looking assistant, clutching a stack of files, opened the door to leave.

Estella didn't wait. She turned her shoulder and shoved past the assistant, slipping through the gap before the guards could grab her.

The room smelled of aged leather, cedarwood, and expensive scotch. It was a masculine cave, insulated from the wedding hysteria outside.

Fletcher Holland sat on a deep Chesterfield sofa. He was reading a document, a crystal tumbler of amber liquid resting on the table beside him. He wore a tuxedo, but the jacket was unbuttoned, and he looked less like a father of the groom and more like a king holding court in exile.

He didn't look up when she burst in.

Estella slammed the door shut behind her and twisted the lock. The click echoed in the silence.

At the sound of the lock, Fletcher finally raised his head.

His eyes were a dark, slate gray. Cold. Impassive. They swept over her disheveled state-the slightly askew veil, the flush on her cheeks-without a flicker of concern.

""Jameson isn't here,"" he stated. It wasn't a question. His voice was a deep baritone, smooth and devoid of emotion.

Estella walked forward. Her legs felt like jelly, but she forced them to move. She placed the iPad on the coffee table in front of him, the black-and-white photo of the airport still glowing on the screen.

""He's in Paris,"" she said.

Fletcher glanced at the screen. His brow furrowed-a microscopic movement, the only sign that he was processing the collapse of a multi-million dollar event. He didn't sigh. He didn't shout. He simply reached into his pocket and pulled out his phone.

""I'll have legal draft the annulment of the contracts,"" he said, his thumb hovering over the screen. ""And PR will handle the fallout.""

Estella reached out and covered his hand with hers. Her skin was ice cold against his warmth.

Fletcher stopped. He looked at her hand, then up at her face. His gaze was heavy, a physical weight pressing down on her. It was a warning. Remove your hand.

Estella pulled back, but she didn't retreat. She took a breath, holding his gaze.

""Marry me,"" she said.

The words hung in the air, absurd and heavy.

Fletcher stared at her for a long moment. Then, the corner of his mouth ticked up. It was barely a twitch, but it was there. A scoff.

He stood up. He was tall, over six-foot-two, and he loomed over her, blocking out the light. The sheer size of him was intimidating, a wall of muscle and bespoke wool.

""You are hysterical,"" he said dismissively. ""You're a damaged asset, Estella. You have no leverage. Your father is a fraud, your fiancé is a runaway, and you are currently hysterical in my private lounge.""

""I'm not hysterical,"" Estella countered, her voice steadying. She began to recite the numbers she had memorized from the financial pages. ""If you cancel this wedding, the merger with the Kensington Group falls through because it relies on the family image clause. Holland stock drops at least eight percent on Monday. That's a loss of... what? Four hundred million in market cap?""

Fletcher's eyes narrowed. He was listening now.

""And then there's the scandal,"" she pressed, stepping closer. ""The press will say Jameson is unstable. They'll dig into his partying. They'll question his fitness to inherit. The board is already shaky on him. If he runs now, they'll push for Pierce.""

She gestured to the door. ""Pierce is upstairs right now, trying to get into my dress. Do you want that idiot sitting on your board? Because if I don't walk down that aisle, my father will sell me to Pierce just to pay his debts. And then Pierce has a direct line to the family trust.""

Fletcher walked to the window, turning his back on her. He looked out at Central Park, his hands clasped behind his back. The tension in his shoulders was the only sign of the calculations running through his mind.

""You're proposing a business transaction,"" he said to the glass.

""I'm proposing a solution,"" Estella corrected. ""You need a stable image. You need to block the side of the family that wants to usurp you. And you need to clean up Jameson's mess.""

She took a breath. ""And I need protection. I need a name that scares people.""

Fletcher turned around slowly. He looked at her with new eyes. He wasn't seeing a daughter-in-law anymore. He was evaluating a potential partner.

""What do you want, Estella?"" he asked softly. ""Really?""

""Dignity,"" she answered instantly. ""And the power to make Jameson regret the day he was born.""

Fletcher was silent. The air conditioner hummed. He seemed to be weighing the cost of a wife against the cost of a stock crash.

Then, a sharp rap sounded on the door.

""Fletcher!"" It was the Grand Dame's voice. ""Open this door immediately.""

\---

🌺 CHAPTER 3 🌺

Satisfied-or perhaps just intrigued-he walked to the door and unlocked it.

Grand Dame Holland entered, leaning heavily on her ebony cane. She was a small woman, shrunken by age, but her presence filled the room like toxic gas. Behind her, Sharon the PR Director looked ready to faint.

The Grand Dame's sharp eyes darted from Fletcher to Estella. ""Well?"" she barked. ""Why is the bride in here and the groom in France?""

Fletcher poured himself a drink, his movements languid. ""Jameson has abdicated,"" he said, swirling the amber liquid. ""He's chosen Paris over his responsibilities.""

The Grand Dame slammed her cane against the floor. ""That spineless boy! He is a disgrace to the name. He gets that weakness from his mother."" She turned her fury on Sharon. ""Cancel it. Tell them she has cholera. Tell them anything.""

""If we cancel,"" Estella spoke up, her voice cutting through the old woman's tirade, ""tomorrow's headline isn't about illness. It's 'Holland Heir Flees Responsibility.' It confirms every rumor about the family's instability.""

The Grand Dame turned slowly to look at Estella. Her eyes were like beads of obsidian. She was assessing a threat.

""But,"" Estella continued, stepping forward, ""if the wedding proceeds... if the groom changes... the narrative changes.""

She looked at Fletcher. ""It becomes a story of strength. A consolidation of power. A true union of equals, rather than a puppy love match.""

""And who,"" the Grand Dame asked, her voice dangerously low, ""is the new groom?""

""Me,"" Fletcher said.

The word dropped like a stone in a pond.

Sharon gasped audibly. The Grand Dame froze. She looked at her son-her cold, ruthless, efficient masterpiece of a son.

""It solves the Pierce problem,"" Fletcher added, taking a sip of his drink. ""If I marry her, the Holcomb shares are voting with me, not the cousins. Pierce is locked out of the boardroom forever.""

That was the key. The Grand Dame hated the cousins more than she cared about propriety. She was a pragmatist to the bone.

She looked at Estella, narrowing her eyes. ""Her father is a thief and a liar.""

""Her father is a thief,"" Fletcher agreed, setting his glass down. ""But she just negotiated a merger in under three minutes while wearing a forty-pound dress. She is a qualified Holland.""

Estella felt a strange thrill at the back of her neck. It wasn't a compliment; it was a certification.

The Grand Dame stared at Estella for a long moment, then gave a sharp nod. ""Call the judge. Have him amend the license. Now.""

Sharon looked like she was having a stroke, but at a glare from Fletcher, she whipped out her phone and began barking orders.

The adrenaline that had been holding Estella upright suddenly vanished. Her knees buckled. She swayed, the room spinning.

A strong hand gripped her elbow. Hard.

Fletcher was there. He didn't hold her gently; he braced her like a collapsing wall.

""Don't fall,"" he whispered in her ear. His breath was warm, smelling of scotch and tobacco. ""You chose this path. Walk it.""

Estella gritted her teeth, locking her knees. She looked up at him. ""I'll walk it better than anyone.""

A team of lawyers swarmed into the room moments later, looking like a pit crew. They slapped a document onto the coffee table. The Prenuptial Agreement.

""Standard terms,"" one lawyer said breathlessly. ""Total separation of assets. No claim to the estate upon death. Divorce clause is-""

Estella didn't listen. She flipped to the last page, picked up a pen, and signed her name. Estella Holcomb.

She shoved the paper toward Fletcher.

He raised an eyebrow at her speed, then took the pen. His signature was sharp, aggressive, taking up more space than necessary.

From the hallway, the deep, resonant sound of the pipe organ began to play the Wedding March. The vibration traveled through the floorboards.

The Grand Dame walked over to Estella. She reached up and adjusted the veil, her touch surprisingly rough. ""Do not embarrass us,"" she hissed.

Fletcher extended his arm. He crooked his elbow, waiting.

Estella took a deep breath. She slid her hand through his arm. His bicep was rock hard beneath the wool suit.

""Ready?"" he asked. He didn't look at her; he was looking at the door.

""Ready,"" she lied.

Together, they walked out of the safety of the VIP room and toward the double doors of the ballroom, where five hundred guests were waiting for a groom who wasn't coming.",4,1769594127.0,romancenovels,2,1.0,False

My husband, Zachariah Gilliatt, was set on making me pay.

Everything I did was met with cold silence.

At night, I'd make all kinds of noise—coughing violently for hours or getting up for water every few minutes—but he remained unresponsive.

The master bedroom door stayed shut tight.

He must have thought I was doing it on purpose to get his attention.

But that wasn't it.

I was just in pain. After all, I was terminally ill.

But he never would've believed me.

To him, I was a born liar—incurably manipulative.

Eventually, the doctors told me I had only one month left and that it was time to start planning my funeral.

That day, Zachariah was leaning against the headboard, smoking, when I handed him the divorce papers.

He scoffed. ""You've tried every trick in the book, and now you're pulling the divorce card to get my attention?""

He refused to sign—he was still intent on tormenting me.

He and I hadn't married out of love.

Back then, on the day the love of his life went abroad, he came to see me.

""Since you're so desperate to marry me, I'll give you what you want,"" he said. ""But mark my words: marrying me will be the greatest regret of your life.""

He was right—I did regret it.

But it was too late.

I handed him the diagnosis.

""Let's get a divorce. You wouldn't want to be labeled a widower, would you?""

He took the paper—the one that said I had one month left—and his hands began to shake.

He jumped to his feet.

""Arianna Norcutt, you damn woman! Is this how you get back at me?""

Panicking, he forcibly dragged me downstairs and shoved me into the car.

""Heal her! I said, heal her!"" he barked at the doctors.

Was his heart actually breaking for me?

But it was all far too late.

\*\*\*

That night, I ate dinner alone before heading to the bathroom.

I stayed there for over an hour before coming out, wrapped in a bathrobe.

I'd fallen asleep in the tub.

Standing in front of the mirror, I tightened the robe's tie and ran a finger over my sharp, gaunt chin.

Any thinner, and I'd be nothing but skin and bones.

Just then, the front door swung open.

Zachariah came back, and he'd brought a girl with him.

Our eyes met.

The room went completely still.

I clenched my hands inside my bathrobe sleeves.

He leaned against the liquor cabinet, his lips curling into a sneer. ""Look at you. What a turn-off.""

In that moment, my heart clenched so tight I could barely breathe.

I finally retreated to my bedroom and shut the door.

Inside, I put on my headphones.

But in the dark, the pain that had seeped into every cell of my body flared up again.

I curled into a tight ball.

Soon, the coppery taste of blood filled my throat.

My lips parted, and blood gushed out, bright red in the lamplight.

Drenched in cold sweat, I scrambled to my feet and staggered toward the bathroom.

I lost track of how long I clenched my teeth against the searing pain that night.

Only when it began to ease did I manage to haul myself up and wipe the blood I had coughed onto the floor.

Just then, the bathroom door shifted as someone pushed against it.

I'd just turned on the faucet to wash my hands.

""Is... someone in there?"" the girl asked.

I didn't answer. I switched on the bathroom light instead.

""Oh, so there is someone,"" she muttered, sounding disappointed.

A moment later, a figure leaned in the doorway.

Two sharp knocks followed.

""Are you done yet?"" Zachariah asked.

I ducked my head, scrubbing the blood from my hands faster.

Then I pulled the door open and stepped out, brushing past him as he still leaned against the frame.

The girl slipped into the bathroom behind me.

Only then did I turn to look at him.

Why?

Why did he have to humiliate me like this?

He just stared back.

Was that a glint of triumph, satisfaction, or disdain in his eyes?

I looked away.

I poured a glass of hot water and set it on the coffee table.

Then I bent to open the drawer and take out several medicine bottles.

One by one, I shook the pills into my palm.

He stayed where he was, watching me with a sneer.

I set the medicines down and gave him a quiet look.

What was that in his eyes?

He must have thought I was faking again—pretending to be seriously ill just to get his attention.

His expression said it all: ""Arianna, go ahead with your little show. I'm not buying it.""

I smiled.

Gathering the pills, I lifted the glass and swallowed them.

Then I tidied the table and walked past him back to my room.

When I was first diagnosed with leukemia, the doctor told me to bring a family member to the hospital.

I called Zachariah, but he declined the call.

I brought the medicine home and deliberately left it in the living room drawer instead of my bedroom.

I thought he might one day open the drawer and find me dying.

But half a year had passed, and he never noticed.

Even though I had taken the pills right in front of him just now, he still assumed I was faking it.

I shut the door behind me and almost laughed.

I wondered if he would feel a flicker of regret on the day I die.

His wife had taken her anti-leukemia medication right before his eyes, yet to him, it was nothing more than a brilliant performance he was too clever to fall for.

Chapter 2

The next day, the girl was gone.

Zachariah wasn't home either.

The housekeeper prepared a meal before leaving.

In a daze, I took a few sips of oatmeal.

I stood and walked to the floor-to-ceiling window.

Warm sunlight flooded through the glass.

I raised my hand and touched the pane, as if I could reach the radiance outside.

But I couldn't.

Back in college, my eyes were always on Zachariah, while his gaze remained fixed on Catherine Elltoft.

During a campus event, Catherine and I were assigned to the same group.

That's when I realized we were polar opposites in personality.

She was quiet but fiercely proud.

She would often retreat to a corner, weeping over a single comment.

Because I had feelings for Zachariah, many assumed I was deliberately picking on her.

From that year on, my reputation plummeted.

Zachariah's gaze toward me also turned cold.

The year we graduated, Catherine chose to go abroad.

Unfounded rumors circulated that I had arrogantly driven her away.

Before she left, she met me just once to tell me she was leaving—and she was the one who reached out.

On the day Catherine departed, Zachariah found me. ""Since you like me so much,"" he said, ""let's get married.""

I was bewildered.

At that time, I was still too young. Though I sensed how it was risky to marry so suddenly, I believed my love for him was deep enough that I could make him love me in return.

I went with him to register our marriage.

And with that, he opened the door to his humiliation and revenge.

I was truly foolish back then.

I thought that his proposal meant he must have liked me, at least a little.

I never imagined it was all just retaliation.

But what had I done wrong?

I never hurt Catherine.

I didn't drive her away.

Yet no one believed me.

In the early days of our marriage, I tried desperately to change his mind.

I took up the domestic duties—cooked for him, kept the house.

I decorated the entire house to Zachariah's liking.

When he was angry, I never argued back.

When his mother fell ill, I tended to her diligently.

No matter how late he returned from his social engagements, I would still be awake, preparing hangover soup and serving it to him.

I drew his bathwater.

I also learned a massage technique to ease his headaches.

\*\*\*

Yet none of this ever earned me a single kind word from him.

His face was always cold as ice.

Desperate to get his attention, I once sliced my finger on purpose while cutting fruit.

With red-rimmed eyes, I held it out to him.

""Darling, my finger's bleeding. It hurts so much.""

But he just smiled and brushed my hand away.

""You deliberately cut yourself—you really know how to play tricks, don't you?""

When I came down with a fever, I ran to him and curled up in his arms.

""Darling, my head's burning up. Feel it.""

He pushed me away and went back to work.

""If you're sick, go to a doctor. What do you want from me?""

And there was even one time, I was bitten by his friend's dog.

He didn't even bother to help me up.

Instead, he stood there with his friend, watching me coldly.

I limped all the way to the hospital to get the rabies vaccine by myself.

That day, I walked down the mountain. It took me such a long, long time.

A heavy rainstorm poured down.

My whole body was soaked to the bone.

As I kept on walking, I couldn't tell whether the liquid streaming down my face was rainwater or tears.

In the end, I squatted down helplessly, hiding my face in my hands.

From that day on, I stopped being warm and enthusiastic toward him.

I stopped handling most household chores myself and hired a housekeeper instead.

No matter how late Zachariah returned from his social engagements, I no longer waited up for him.

I moved out of the main bedroom on my own.

Even when we slept in the same room, he was so domineering, taking up most of the bed.

Sometimes I'd wake up to find myself sleeping on the floor.

His heart was impossible to warm.

After my leg injury healed, I spent some time in silence before asking him for a divorce.

I thought he'd agree without hesitation.

To my surprise, he tore up the papers I handed him.

He scoffed. ""Can't take this already? This is just the tip of the iceberg.""

A few days later, I heard from an alumnus that something seemed to have happened to Catherine abroad.

But no one knew exactly what had transpired.

Zachariah didn't come home for several days in a row.

Then one day, as I was pruning the flowers and plants, I suddenly started having a nosebleed.

Drop after drop, the blood fell onto the foliage.

I tilted my head back, yet I couldn't stem the gush.

The pruning shears in my hand clattered to the floor.

I thought of my mother, who had passed away when I was little after bleeding uncontrollably.

I rushed to the hospital.

After a series of tests, I received the reports.

I sat frozen in my chair, stunned.

In the doctor's office, the old doctor adjusted his glasses, flipping through the reports one by one, his expression ashen with gravity.

Finally, he simply shook his head.

On my diagnosis form, only five words were written: Acute Leukemia.

""Leukemia... there are acute and chronic types?""

Faced with my numb, halting question, the old doctor heaved a heavy sigh. ""Acute cases have only three months to a year. With chronic leukemia, some can live for around ten years.""

So that was how it was.

I looked down at the word ""Acute"" on the form, my hands trembling slightly.

The paper was damp with tears.

There were still so many things I hadn't done...

Never mind.

If there were a next life, I would finish them then.

Chapter 3

When I returned home, clutching the diagnosis, Zachariah was back after being missing for five days.

He was sitting on the couch.

I lowered my head to change my shoes and paused, startled by a pair of red high heels by the door.

When I looked up again, a woman emerged from his bedroom.

""Mr. Gilliatt, my earring got caught in my hair.""

He set his phone down.

""Come here.""

She walked over and sat beside him. He gently untangled the strands from the earring.

Their posture was charged with intimacy.

He looked up at me with a hint of amusement in his eyes.

After freeing the earring, he pulled her into his arms, and they leaned back against the couch together.

Meanwhile, I stood petrified in place, like a statue.

Earlier, the doctor had told me to notify a family member.

Even though I knew the call wouldn't be answered, I tried dialing anyway.

Sure enough, it rang once before he hung up.

So he wasn't actually busy.

He was just occupied with charming a beauty.

And I noticed that the woman had a profile that looked strikingly similar to Catherine's.

I snapped back to reality, finished changing my shoes, and went to the bedroom, closing the door behind me.

That day, after Zachariah left with the woman, I placed the medication in the living room drawer.

I wondered what his reaction would be if he ever found it.

But he never opened that drawer.

Later, I learned what had happened to Catherine overseas.

She'd been tricked into a marriage, beaten, and suffered a complete mental breakdown.

All the women Zachariah brought home bore a resemblance to Catherine. It was clear he was taking revenge on me because of Catherine.

But after it happened again and again, I grew numb to it all.

The truth was, I was already counting down the days I had left.

How could I possibly care about anything else?

Even the man I once loved with all my heart—now, I felt nothing for him at all.

However, I didn't want the title of Mrs. Zachariah anymore, not even a little bit.

I had to find a way to shed it.

Within half a year, Zachariah finally calmed down after bringing home 20 women.

It seemed he'd grown tired of the game.

Moreover, he started spending more time at home.

Though when I say more, I only mean he might be around for an afternoon or two on the weekends.

Against all odds, my body had held on for six months.

But I knew my time was almost up.

Now, even if I stayed home doing absolutely nothing, I still looked sickly and frail.

One day, the sun was shining outside.

Wrapped in a thick sweater like a burrito, I curled up at the foot of the couch, as close to the natural light as I could get.

Ever since I got sick, I've been breaking into cold sweats, constantly feeling chilled.

The door to his bedroom suddenly opened, and he stepped out.

He took a couple of steps, then stopped abruptly in the living room and looked over at me.

I felt his stare and met his eyes.

He stood there, tall and lean, his gaze suspicious.

""It's sweltering outside,"" he said. ""Why are you bundled up like that?""

It had been so long since he'd spoken to me.

For a moment, my mind went blank.

""Because I'm cold,"" I replied. ""What else would it be?""

His brows furrowed.

""Cold?""

I nodded.

His once-perfect features were now shadowed with a heavy, dark expression.

He moved to the opposite couch and sat down, studying me intently.

For the first time in what felt like ages. It had been so long since he'd truly looked at me.

""The housekeeper says you've barely been eating lately. Can't even finish half a plate?""

I pulled my shawl tighter and met his gaze.

""Do you care about me?""

Our eyes held.

His expression remained as grave as ever.

Probably, my small, deathly pale face looked truly worrying.

Yet my health had been declining right under his nose, and he'd never once suspected that I might be seriously ill.

Just as a flicker of hope sparked in me, he stood up, his slender fingers grabbing the car keys.

""If you're sick, go to the hospital. Don't think starving yourself and making yourself look like this will earn you sympathy. Some people don't deserve an ounce of compassion their entire lives.""

My hope was shattered all over again.

I scoffed.

He reached the entryway and turned his head.

The sound of my scoff seemed to irritate him.

But I didn't spare him another glance.

I turned to look at the sunlight outside.

He seemed to hesitate for a long moment.

In the end, though, the door slammed shut.

Chapter 4

After that day, perhaps Zachariah had grown tired of his life outside.

Or perhaps he genuinely sensed something was off.

Either way, he started coming home for dinner every single night.

When I got up from the table and stumbled, he reached out to steady me.

He frowned slightly. ""You haven't been to the hospital?""

I looked up. ""I went. I went a long time ago.""

Then I lowered my gaze, pulling my hand from his and stepping back.

The next day at dinner, just as I was about to put down my fork, he ladled some soup and set it in front of me.

""Drink it.""

I looked at him, confused.

When I didn't move, his tone softened—a rare occurrence.

""How can you get by on just two spoonfuls? At least drink some soup for the nutrients.""

I thought for a moment, then picked up the mug and forced down the rich broth.

If I wasn't mistaken, after I finished, the tightness in his face seemed to ease a little.

Later that night, I sat wrapped in a quilt on the chaise lounge, gazing up at the star-studded sky.

We lived in the hillside neighborhood, where the skies were clear enough to see the stars.

Footsteps approached the balcony. In the half-light, a small flame flickered to life.

I didn't look at him.

I just stared intently at the night sky.

He called me.

""Arianna.""

After a long while, I replied to him, ""What is it?""

He leaned against the railing, a small ember glowing between his fingers. ""Since when can't I just call your name for no reason?""

I turned my head and looked at him earnestly. ""I just thought, with so many beauties to call on, why bother with me?""

When I met his gaze, his brow seemed to soften slightly.

I waited for his answer.

He tilted his head back, also looking at the stars. ""But right now, I want to call your name.""

He was still wearing his white office suit, pristine and snow-white.

His long shadow stretched beside him.

I turned my gaze away, looking into the distant darkness instead.

I shook my head and said softly, ""You never wanted to call my name before. Why start now?""

His gaze returned to me, this time direct and piercing. ""What's wrong with you?""

I just shook my head.

""Nothing.""

After a long silence, he said, ""You want a divorce?""

I was about to answer when he turned his back.

""Don't even think about it. We're bound together for life.""

""Bound together?""

""Aren't we? I won't find happiness, and you won't go looking for it either.""

""Is that so? You could still go find Catherine. Bring her back, and you'd be happy.""

In the cold night air, I only heard him scoff. ""You think after three years, everything can go back to how it was? Everything has changed.""

Suddenly, he turned back, his gaze locking onto me.

""Isn't it true? You've changed, too. You've changed so much, I don't even recognize you.""

Even in the dimly lit balcony, his eyes seemed to burn with intensity.

I replied calmly, ""So it's that obvious. I must be so ugly now that it offends you. But then why come out here? If I were you, and someone was too ugly to look at, I'd choose not to look.""

I used to care a lot about my appearance.

If I gained a little weight, I'd diet.

I practiced yoga to keep my figure in its best shape.

My face was always layered with creams and serums.

But after getting sick, no skincare could hold back the decline.

I didn't even have the energy to put on makeup.

Actually, that was fine. I let it be.

Surprisingly, when I finished speaking, he froze for a split second, wearing a look of utter disbelief.

Chapter 5

What now?

""I'm not talking about your appearance.""

If it wasn't about my appearance, then what?

He took a drag from the unlit cigarette.

I was drowsy.

I threw off the cool quilt and climbed down from the chaise lounge, stumbling unsteadily toward my room, feeling faint.

In the cool night air, the person behind me seemed to take a deep breath.

""Arianna, from now on, let's live a good life together.""

I came to an abrupt halt.

My back stiffened.

What did he mean by that?

Live a good life in what way?

After a moment of silence, I tentatively took it to mean that he wanted us to try to make our marriage work.

If that really was what he meant... how many years had I waited to hear those words?

It had been three years since we got married.

It had been seven years since I fell in love with him.

But if that was what he meant, the only words I could say to him now were: ""It's too late.""

With that, I turned and went back to my bedroom, closing the door behind me.

The next day, the housekeeper sighed and said, ""Why are there so many cigarette butts on the balcony?""

I glanced over.

The ground was damp with rain, littered with cigarette ash, and wet petals blown down by the wind.

Then I caught sight of my gaunt reflection in the floor-to-ceiling window.

An indescribable sense of desolation hung over everything.

Ever since that night, Zachariah slipped back into his cold and unyielding self.

The conversation we'd had on the balcony that night was like a midnight rain—washed away and gone without a trace.

He resumed his old routine of leaving early and returning late once more.

It was not uncommon to go days without catching a glimpse of him.

However, not long after this, my health took a sharp turn for the worse.

I spent my days drifting in and out of a stupor, lying in bed wracked with sharp pain, and dealing with endless nosebleeds.

When he came home at night, the light in my room was almost always off.

A few times, it seemed he showered in the bathroom next to my room.

Footsteps would pause outside my door for a moment.

But eventually, they would fade away as he walked off.

One day, when the weather was clear, I felt unusually well.

After washing up and putting on a sweater, I went to the hospital.

I wanted to know exactly how much time I had left.

Once again, the elderly doctor sighed.

But this time, it was the heaviest sigh of all, like the deep toll of a funeral bell.

""You have one month left. Make your final arrangements.""

Clutching the diagnosis report, I walked out.

I drifted down the empty corridor like a lost soul, aimless and adrift.

Then, I lifted my gaze.

I stopped and looked across the corridor at Zachariah, who stood head and shoulders above the crowd, and the girl at his side.

A hospital administrator was leading the way ahead of them.

The girl stayed close, chatting with a faint smile on her lips.

Just as they were about to turn the corner, he spotted me on the opposite side.

He stopped abruptly, a swirl of emotion flickering in his eyes.

The administrator and the girl paused too, glancing my way.

That was when I got a clear look at her.

I'd never seen her before, yet she still bore a faint resemblance to Catherine.

We stared at each other for several seconds, wordless.

It wasn't until the administrator stepped closer to him and seemed to ask, ""Mr. Gilliatt, do you know her?""

I turned and left the hospital through another corridor.

As expected, his words on the balcony that night didn't mean he wanted to make things work between us.

They weren't an attempt to hold onto me, either.

Maybe he was just toying with me.

Lucky for me, my reply—""It is too late""—had been a rejection after all.

Chapter 6

When I got home, an hour passed before he returned.

I was a little surprised. It wasn't the weekend. Had he taken that girl to the hospital for a checkup?

He was always a workaholic; after the appointment, he should have gone straight back to the office.

At the very least, he could have stayed with her a little longer.

Why was he home so early?

But it was just as well.

I happened to have something to say to him.

He was changing his shoes in the entryway.

I glanced at the divorce agreement on the table—the one I'd printed at a print shop on my way home.

It was just the electronic draft our lawyer had prepared earlier.

He finished changing his shoes and walked over, pausing in the living room as he looked at me sitting on the couch.

""That was an accident today. It wasn't what it looked like.""

I pressed my lips together, ignoring his words entirely.

Instead, I noticed what seemed to be a small error in the agreement.

In the original draft, this marital home was supposed to go to me, while I wouldn't claim any share of his company-related assets.

This house was originally supposed to be paid for entirely by him.

But I gave him my wedding gifts so we could combine our money and buy it together—I thought that would make it meaningful.

When it came to his company assets, I could have claimed a substantial amount if I'd insisted.

But back then, I never even considered dividing his shares.

All I wanted was a place to live after the divorce.

But now, though, I no longer wanted this house.

Too many women have stayed here.

Even the thought of dying in it fills me with disgust.

I picked up a pen and crossed out the clause granting me the house.

I only had one month left.

I still had 10,000 dollars in savings, which was more than enough.

When I finally looked up, he was no longer in the living room.

The faint scent of cigarette smoke drifted from the main bedroom.

I picked up the agreement and walked in.

Sure enough, he was leaning wearily against the headboard, smoking.

His long legs were stretched out on the bed, shoes still on.

He looked nothing like the man I'd seen at the hospital.

I frowned.

He'd only started smoking in the past six months, and already he was a heavy smoker.

I cleared my throat, then drew back the sheer curtains in his room.

He stubbed out his cigarette, reached over to turn on the air purifier, and only then looked at me.

""What is it?""

If I wasn't mistaken, there was a subtle change in the way he looked at me now.

I stared back calmly for two seconds—as if saying goodbye to the face that had consumed nearly a third of my life, the face I'd loved to the point of madness.

After saying goodbye, I held out my hand. ""Zachariah, this is for you. Don't tear it up this time. Let's part ways amicably.""

His expression shifted abruptly.

That stunningly handsome face clouded over instantly, as if a storm were gathering.

""Arianna, I told you it was a misunderstanding today.""

I shook my head. ""It's not important.""

""Why not? After our talk the other night, I haven't been involved with anyone...""

I lowered my head, cutting him off. ""Zachariah, are you trying to keep me now?""

He snatched the divorce agreement and tossed it aside.

""We've been rushing to finish a major project at the company. I've been traveling nonstop and haven't been home much. But I promise, from now on I'll make more time for us.""

I lifted my head and stared blankly at him.

The stormy look on his face seemed to fade. He reached for my hand.

""Arianna.""

But just as his hand was about to close around mine, I pulled away.

""I need a divorce, Zachariah. I'm terminally ill. I'm dying.""

""What did you say?""

I bent to pick up the diagnosis slip that had fallen to the floor.

I was knocked aside when he snatched the divorce agreement.

""This is my diagnosis.""

I held it out to him.

His brow twitched as he took it.

The more he read, the paler he grew.

I watched as his hands began to shake, then his legs.

Finally, his whole body was trembling.

""No, it can't be true. Anna, tell me this is a lie.""

His eyes reddened. ""You made this up to get a divorce, didn't you? To trick me?""

I looked at him, his expression utterly shattered.

I never imagined I'd see him like this.

He stared back, his eyes full of desperate hope.

I smiled softly. ""That girl you were with—she was there for an appointment too, wasn't she? When you saw me at the hospital, you didn't even ask what was wrong with me.

""Zachariah, you never cared about me. Not even once.""

He cut me off sharply. ""Don't say that, Anna. We can cure you. I will cure you, no matter what it takes.""

He shot to his feet, swept me into his arms, and held me tightly.

At that moment, I could feel his tall frame trembling uncontrollably against mine.

His grip was so tight, I could barely breathe.",2,1769593912.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

now ive been eating really bad over the past few days, ive been on vacation with a few friends and honestly was not paying attention to what i was eating at all. we were eating really bad and i was even getting trigger foods like carbs, sugar, coffee and alcohol without a care in the world. i fully expected my stomach to blow up on me for this but it… didn’t. it was actually … behaving normally and even when i ate too much i didn’t have any adverse consequences like indigestion or nausea.

the weird thing is, i DIDNT feel that bloated after, like my stomach felt normal?? and my belly isn’t protruding as much as it normally does. i actually put on a pair of old pants and the waist wasn’t as tight as it normally is, usually i have to size up in pants since getting sibo.

now this doesn’t mean im sibo free or have a “flat” stomach again, ive accepted that it will be a long time before it looks anything close to what it was before getting sick. but it looks flattER and i am not having as many digestive issues as i normally do.

does this mean it could be getting better? or is this a trick and my sibo will re-flare up even worse when my guard is down? does anyone know why this could happen? ",1,1769593450.0,SIBO,5,1.0,False

1qp6x6i,https://i.redd.it/kd534h2wv1gg1.png,Passed AWS SAA-C03 in 12 days,"Prep Start Date: Jan 10, 2026  
Booking Date: Jan 20, 2026  
Exam Date: Jan 22, 2026

**Background:**

I have over 13 years of experience in the software industry and around 9 years working on AWS as a big data engineer as well as a cloud infrastructure / devops engineer.

**Certification Timeline:**

Here is my AWS certification odyssey, which is punctuated by episodes of chronic procrastination. :)

* Jan 2026 - Solutions Architect - Associate
* Jul 2025 - Cloud Practitioner - Recertified
* Jan 2023 - Cloud Practitioner - Foundational

**Preparation Material for SAA-C03:**

The preparation took 12 days of dedicated study, averaging \~4 hours daily, with several late-night sessions thrown into the mix.

1. TutorialsDojo (TD) Practice Exams
   * I purchased it from the website as it has Review Mode, and it was the best decision ever.
   * I started learning in Review Mode by completing all 8 practice exams first to cover the whole content, paying meticulous attention to the explanations accompanying each correct and incorrect answer. I consistently achieved 80% score on average, a score that virtually guarantees success on the certification exam.
   * For quick clarifications, I relied on AI Mode of Google because that's pretty quick and also gives links to references, mostly AWS docs or blogs, which I explored when needed
   * I only attempted a couple of timed tests in between to see how well I could manage time, and realized I was easily completing those well within 100 minutes. So, I didn't bother attempting all of those because they were composed of the same questions I answered in review mode. I even found myself answering some of those from my memory, as I had already covered the whole content.
2. Cheat sheets and notes
   * Used the following only for further clarification on weak areas identified during TD Review mode. Also used these for the Trusted Advisor and the Well-Architected Framework Tool whitepapers.
      * [https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheets/](https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheets/)
      * [https://github.com/parthivrmenon/aws\_saa](https://github.com/parthivrmenon/aws_saa)
      * [https://github.com/vikas9dev/aws](https://github.com/vikas9dev/aws)
3. Mind Map - for quick revision on the night before the exam (took \~6 hours)
   *  [https://www.mindmeister.com/app/map/3471885158?t=lE6MXlXHYC](https://www.mindmeister.com/app/map/3471885158?t=lE6MXlXHYC)

**Exam Day Review**

* I woke up a couple of hours before the exam. Had a hearty breakfast with a cup of coffee. Didn't study anything. Reached the exam center 45 mins early, but they started at the scheduled time, even though the center was empty.
* The exam started with a couple of very difficult questions around multi-region Direct Connect setup, Global Accelerator and Route 53 routing. I spent around 7 minutes on those questions only to flag them for review.
* The next few questions were easy and gave me confidence. Then I got into the rhythm and completed the first pass of all 65 questions in around 120 minutes.
* The next 25 minutes were spent on the 11 questions I had flagged for review. The last 15 minutes were spent on doing the 2nd pass of all 65 questions at an extreme pace to count how many answers have the potential to go wrong, and the count was around 10 questions. Pretty happy with the score I got.
* I submitted the exam with only 30 seconds remaining, and then filled out the survey that appeared on the screen.

**Tips**

* Set a date for the exam in your mind before starting the preparation and book the exam on that date as early as possible to help yourself stick to your study routine.
* During the prep and exam, study the questions very carefully and look for words like cost-effective, minimal operational overhead, highly available, durable storage, best performance, etc.
* Get ESL30+ accommodation for an extra 30 minutes if English is not your native language. I did so and spent that time on review.
* If you have enough experience on AWS, you don't need to go through those long Video Courses and take notes. People have done it already for you. Just learn on the go as you attempt the practice exams. You already know how to quickly skim through the docs on your job with that much experience, don't you? :)
* Don't panic, trust the process, and have confidence in your efforts during the exam.
* For some countries, Pearson Vue is not accepting bank credit/debit payments. So, you have to purchase exam vouchers for AWS store on Pearson Vue's website, or figure out some other arrangement by asking others in your country who took the AWS exam. Ultimately, you have to use a voucher to book the exam if you want to sit in the test center. I'm not sure about attempting from home, but I do not recommend that. This means that your 50% discount vouchers or other regional/global AWS offers will go to waste, as vouchers don't stack. Sigh!

So I’ve cancelled my spin class this morning, and won’t be doing any weight training either. Instead I am going to put on a nice outfit and take myself out for a gentle walk and a solo coffee date.

I work out frequently, played college ball, don’t eat much junk/fast food and tbh my job is not very stressful. After I got covid in 2021 these beats have become much more numerous.. there are days where I probably have 10-15k maybe more. There are also days where I have less than 100. Very strange. I will go weeks with a high amount every day and then weeks with very very little. I do have an unusual circumstance though, I have Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EOE) and I also have some very mild fibrosis in my heart. Docs say most likely from Covid or myocarditis. I did have a terrible dose of Covid. Good echos, stress test. I have noticed that the more I eat, the worse they are. Coffee destroys me. Sigh… I have inflammation in my esophagus and I’m sure that triggers them. I was offered an ablation but declined. I also was on metoprolol for a bit but didn’t have much energy while taking them since my rested heart rate is already in the 50s. So I am trying to “tough it out” on my own. It seems the busier I am and the less I think about it, I don’t feel or notice them. But Some days it’s all I can think about… and I’ll come to this sub to try and find some reassurance. I asked my EP if I was going to die young bc of this and he kinda laughed and said no. I was in a terrible place for a year straight.. my wife was miserable bc all I wanted to do was lay around bc I was scared I would die if I did too much. These things really are the devil. But as time has gone by I’ve realized that none of my symptoms (sometimes dizzy, tired) have gotten worse and the less I worry the better I am. I would get panick attacks after a couplet or a weird feeling in my chest.. I never had a panick attack in my life before these things came along. I understand an ablation is probably in my future, but for now I am not going to let these ruin my life anymore. I appreciate everyone in this sub and I understand what you’re all going through. I’ve been in here more times than I would like to admit… Ofcourse if you’re having frequent PVCs get the testing done, but if docs say we are good then we have to try and be mentally tough.

I've neglected it which caused me to get permanently sunken in eyes which are really noticeable if I take off my glasses. I hope others don't see it as a sign of irresponsibility, which it really is, but of dedication and hard work.

Most of my all nighters are caused by using caffeine so the only way to undo them is also with caffeine. On a day where I wake up in the middle of the evening, I drink a ton of coffee and pursue it as usual, but I do sleep in the middle of class or on the subway. Then I fall asleep really early when the sunsets. I wake up at 4 or 5 am.

I then use coffee again to get me through the day. Usually my sleep schedule gets fixed after two days of this. By fixed I mean I sleep at 11 pm and wake up at 7 am. There's so many external factors which dictate when I fall asleep that I know it's time to do something about it.

This means instilling a bedtime routine, on the good weeks where I do have a good schedule, I usually pray before falling asleep and it helps. Without a routine I feel trapped by whatever is happening or has happened in my life.

On a side note, the dreams which I get whenever I sleep for more than 12 hours are surreal. They make me feel like a kid who's finally sleeping in during the weekend in elementary school.",1,1769592403.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

1qp6pin,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qp6pin,"Finally copped the NY Zip-up I've been eyeing. 🗽 Plus some other pickups (Carhartt, CH, ERD). Which one would you rock?","1. Godspeed ""Doberman"" Hoodie

Heavy 2000s metal/streetwear energy. The graphic is massive and the ""Godspeed"" font is classic.It's a statement piece, but definitely niche. If the print quality holds up after a wash, it’s a win. A bit loud for daily wear, but great for a specific fit.

Score: 7/10

2. Alo Yoga Black Hoodie

Ultra-minimalist ""clean girl/guy"" aesthetic.It’s basically just a high-end blank. The material feels soft, but honestly, you're paying for the tiny ""alo"" logo. Good for the gym or a coffee run, but nothing groundbreaking.

Score: 6.5/10

3. Stüssy ""Built Tough"" Hoodie

Classic West Coast streetwear.You can't really go wrong with Stüssy. The back graphic is iconic, though these ""paragraph"" prints are starting to feel a bit played out in some circles. Still a solid, reliable piece for the rotation.

Score: 7.5/10

4. NY Zip-Up Hoodie (The Grail of the haul) ⭐

Peak ""Old School New York"" meets modern silhouette.This is easily my favorite piece. The navy is deep, the white NY logo pop is perfect, and the crop/oversized cut looks way better in person than the others. It’s got that effortless ""I just threw this on"" look that actually takes effort to pull off. Absolute banger.

Score: 9.5/10

5. Carhartt WIP Heart Hoodie

Workwear but make it ""soft.""The grey heather is a nice break from all the dark colors. The heart logo is a cool twist on the standard patch. It feels sturdy, like it’ll actually last a decade.

Score: 8/10

6. Enfants Riches Déprimés (ERD) Green Hoodie

Punk-luxury / ""I'm rich and bored.""That neon green is aggressive. You really have to have the confidence to pull this off without looking like a highlighter. The ""enfants"" box logo is clean, but the color makes it hard to style regularly.

Score: 6/10

7. Needles Track Jacket (Dusty Pink/Purple)

Sophisticated Japanese vintage sportswear.The colorway is unique—kind of a mauve/taupe with purple stripes. Needles always hits, but it can look like a pajamas top if you don't style it with the right trousers.

Score: 8/10

8. Vetements All-Over Logo Knit

Total logomania chaos.This is a ""love it or hate it"" piece. It’s objectively ""too much,"" but that’s the whole point of Vetements. It’s heavy and feels premium, but you'll definitely get looks (not all of them good).

Score: 5.5/10 (Subjective, but it's a lot to handle)

9. Chrome Hearts Belt

High-end Rockstar aesthetic.This is a solid pick if you want to elevate a basic denim fit. The silver-tone hardware is sleek, and the logo isn't as overbearing as a massive ""H"" or ""GG"" buckle, which keeps it a bit more tasteful. It’s a versatile piece that bridges the gap between the loud graphics and the cleaner hoodies in your haul.

Score: 8/10

10. Chrome Hearts Orange Cross Camo Hat

Early 2000s trucker style meets luxury streetwear.This is a bold choice. The orange cross patches against the camo are high-contrast and definitely demand attention. While it's a ""grail"" item for many, camo can be tricky to style without looking like you're heading to the woods unless the rest of your fit is very intentional. It pairs perfectly with the Godspeed hoodie if you're going for that aggressive, ""loud"" look.

Chapter 1

 My husband, Zachariah Gilliatt, was set on making me pay.

 Everything I did was met with cold silence.

 At night, I'd make all kinds of noise—coughing violently for hours or getting up for water every few minutes—but he remained unresponsive.

 The master bedroom door stayed shut tight.

 He must have thought I was doing it on purpose to get his attention.

 But that wasn't it.

 I was just in pain. After all, I was terminally ill.

 But he never would've believed me.

 To him, I was a born liar—incurably manipulative.

 Eventually, the doctors told me I had only one month left and that it was time to start planning my funeral.

 That day, Zachariah was leaning against the headboard, smoking, when I handed him the divorce papers.

 He scoffed. ""You've tried every trick in the book, and now you're pulling the divorce card to get my attention?""

 He refused to sign—he was still intent on tormenting me.

 He and I hadn't married out of love.

 Back then, on the day the love of his life went abroad, he came to see me.

 ""Since you're so desperate to marry me, I'll give you what you want,"" he said. ""But mark my words: marrying me will be the greatest regret of your life.""

 He was right—I did regret it.

 But it was too late.

 I handed him the diagnosis.

 ""Let's get a divorce. You wouldn't want to be labeled a widower, would you?""

 He took the paper—the one that said I had one month left—and his hands began to shake.

 He jumped to his feet.

 ""Arianna Norcutt, you damn woman! Is this how you get back at me?""

 Panicking, he forcibly dragged me downstairs and shoved me into the car.

 ""Heal her! I said, heal her!"" he barked at the doctors.

 Was his heart actually breaking for me?

 But it was all far too late.

 \*\*\*

 That night, I ate dinner alone before heading to the bathroom.

 I stayed there for over an hour before coming out, wrapped in a bathrobe.

 I'd fallen asleep in the tub.

 Standing in front of the mirror, I tightened the robe's tie and ran a finger over my sharp, gaunt chin.

 Any thinner, and I'd be nothing but skin and bones.

 Just then, the front door swung open.

 Zachariah came back, and he'd brought a girl with him.

 Our eyes met.

 The room went completely still.

 I clenched my hands inside my bathrobe sleeves.

 He leaned against the liquor cabinet, his lips curling into a sneer. ""Look at you. What a turn-off.""

 In that moment, my heart clenched so tight I could barely breathe.

 I finally retreated to my bedroom and shut the door.

 Inside, I put on my headphones.

 But in the dark, the pain that had seeped into every cell of my body flared up again.

 I curled into a tight ball.

 Soon, the coppery taste of blood filled my throat.

 My lips parted, and blood gushed out, bright red in the lamplight.

 Drenched in cold sweat, I scrambled to my feet and staggered toward the bathroom.

 I lost track of how long I clenched my teeth against the searing pain that night.

 Only when it began to ease did I manage to haul myself up and wipe the blood I had coughed onto the floor.

 Just then, the bathroom door shifted as someone pushed against it.

 I'd just turned on the faucet to wash my hands.

 ""Is... someone in there?"" the girl asked.

 I didn't answer. I switched on the bathroom light instead.

 ""Oh, so there is someone,"" she muttered, sounding disappointed.

 A moment later, a figure leaned in the doorway.

 Two sharp knocks followed.

 ""Are you done yet?"" Zachariah asked.

 I ducked my head, scrubbing the blood from my hands faster.

 Then I pulled the door open and stepped out, brushing past him as he still leaned against the frame.

 The girl slipped into the bathroom behind me.

 Only then did I turn to look at him.

 Why?

 Why did he have to humiliate me like this?

 He just stared back.

 Was that a glint of triumph, satisfaction, or disdain in his eyes?

 I looked away.

 I poured a glass of hot water and set it on the coffee table.

 Then I bent to open the drawer and take out several medicine bottles.

 One by one, I shook the pills into my palm.

 He stayed where he was, watching me with a sneer.

 I set the medicines down and gave him a quiet look.

 What was that in his eyes?

 He must have thought I was faking again—pretending to be seriously ill just to get his attention.

 His expression said it all: ""Arianna, go ahead with your little show. I'm not buying it.""

 I smiled.

 Gathering the pills, I lifted the glass and swallowed them.

 Then I tidied the table and walked past him back to my room.

 When I was first diagnosed with leukemia, the doctor told me to bring a family member to the hospital.

 I called Zachariah, but he declined the call.

 I brought the medicine home and deliberately left it in the living room drawer instead of my bedroom.

 I thought he might one day open the drawer and find me dying.

 But half a year had passed, and he never noticed.

 Even though I had taken the pills right in front of him just now, he still assumed I was faking it.

 I shut the door behind me and almost laughed.

 I wondered if he would feel a flicker of regret on the day I die.

 His wife had taken her anti-leukemia medication right before his eyes, yet to him, it was nothing more than a brilliant performance he was too clever to fall for.

Chapter 2

 The next day, the girl was gone.

 Zachariah wasn't home either.

 The housekeeper prepared a meal before leaving.

 In a daze, I took a few sips of oatmeal.

 I stood and walked to the floor-to-ceiling window.

 Warm sunlight flooded through the glass.

 I raised my hand and touched the pane, as if I could reach the radiance outside.

 But I couldn't.

 Back in college, my eyes were always on Zachariah, while his gaze remained fixed on Catherine Elltoft.

 During a campus event, Catherine and I were assigned to the same group.

 That's when I realized we were polar opposites in personality.

 She was quiet but fiercely proud.

 She would often retreat to a corner, weeping over a single comment.

 Because I had feelings for Zachariah, many assumed I was deliberately picking on her.

 From that year on, my reputation plummeted.

 Zachariah's gaze toward me also turned cold.

 The year we graduated, Catherine chose to go abroad.

 Unfounded rumors circulated that I had arrogantly driven her away.

 Before she left, she met me just once to tell me she was leaving—and she was the one who reached out.

 On the day Catherine departed, Zachariah found me. ""Since you like me so much,"" he said, ""let's get married.""

 I was bewildered.

 At that time, I was still too young. Though I sensed how it was risky to marry so suddenly, I believed my love for him was deep enough that I could make him love me in return.

 I went with him to register our marriage.

 And with that, he opened the door to his humiliation and revenge.

 I was truly foolish back then.

 I thought that his proposal meant he must have liked me, at least a little.

 I never imagined it was all just retaliation.

 But what had I done wrong?

 I never hurt Catherine.

 I didn't drive her away.

 Yet no one believed me.

 In the early days of our marriage, I tried desperately to change his mind.

 I took up the domestic duties—cooked for him, kept the house.

 I decorated the entire house to Zachariah's liking.

 When he was angry, I never argued back.

 When his mother fell ill, I tended to her diligently.

 No matter how late he returned from his social engagements, I would still be awake, preparing hangover soup and serving it to him.

 I drew his bathwater.

 I also learned a massage technique to ease his headaches.

 \*\*\*

 Yet none of this ever earned me a single kind word from him.

 His face was always cold as ice.

 Desperate to get his attention, I once sliced my finger on purpose while cutting fruit.

 With red-rimmed eyes, I held it out to him.

 ""Darling, my finger's bleeding. It hurts so much.""

 But he just smiled and brushed my hand away.

 ""You deliberately cut yourself—you really know how to play tricks, don't you?""

 When I came down with a fever, I ran to him and curled up in his arms.

 ""Darling, my head's burning up. Feel it.""

 He pushed me away and went back to work.

 ""If you're sick, go to a doctor. What do you want from me?""

 And there was even one time, I was bitten by his friend's dog.

 He didn't even bother to help me up.

 Instead, he stood there with his friend, watching me coldly.

 I limped all the way to the hospital to get the rabies vaccine by myself.

 That day, I walked down the mountain. It took me such a long, long time.

 A heavy rainstorm poured down.

 My whole body was soaked to the bone.

 As I kept on walking, I couldn't tell whether the liquid streaming down my face was rainwater or tears.

 In the end, I squatted down helplessly, hiding my face in my hands.

 From that day on, I stopped being warm and enthusiastic toward him.

 I stopped handling most household chores myself and hired a housekeeper instead.

 No matter how late Zachariah returned from his social engagements, I no longer waited up for him.

 I moved out of the main bedroom on my own.

 Even when we slept in the same room, he was so domineering, taking up most of the bed.

 Sometimes I'd wake up to find myself sleeping on the floor.

 His heart was impossible to warm.

 After my leg injury healed, I spent some time in silence before asking him for a divorce.

 I thought he'd agree without hesitation.

 To my surprise, he tore up the papers I handed him.

 He scoffed. ""Can't take this already? This is just the tip of the iceberg.""

 A few days later, I heard from an alumnus that something seemed to have happened to Catherine abroad.

 But no one knew exactly what had transpired.

 Zachariah didn't come home for several days in a row.

 Then one day, as I was pruning the flowers and plants, I suddenly started having a nosebleed.

 Drop after drop, the blood fell onto the foliage.

 I tilted my head back, yet I couldn't stem the gush.

 The pruning shears in my hand clattered to the floor.

 I thought of my mother, who had passed away when I was little after bleeding uncontrollably.

 I rushed to the hospital.

 After a series of tests, I received the reports.

 I sat frozen in my chair, stunned.

 In the doctor's office, the old doctor adjusted his glasses, flipping through the reports one by one, his expression ashen with gravity.

 Finally, he simply shook his head.

 On my diagnosis form, only five words were written: Acute Leukemia.

 ""Leukemia... there are acute and chronic types?""

 Faced with my numb, halting question, the old doctor heaved a heavy sigh. ""Acute cases have only three months to a year. With chronic leukemia, some can live for around ten years.""

 So that was how it was.

 I looked down at the word ""Acute"" on the form, my hands trembling slightly.

 The paper was damp with tears.

 There were still so many things I hadn't done...

 Never mind.

 If there were a next life, I would finish them then.

Chapter 3

 When I returned home, clutching the diagnosis, Zachariah was back after being missing for five days.

 He was sitting on the couch.

 I lowered my head to change my shoes and paused, startled by a pair of red high heels by the door.

 When I looked up again, a woman emerged from his bedroom.

 ""Mr. Gilliatt, my earring got caught in my hair.""

 He set his phone down.

 ""Come here.""

 She walked over and sat beside him. He gently untangled the strands from the earring.

 Their posture was charged with intimacy.

 He looked up at me with a hint of amusement in his eyes.

 After freeing the earring, he pulled her into his arms, and they leaned back against the couch together.

 Meanwhile, I stood petrified in place, like a statue.

 Earlier, the doctor had told me to notify a family member.

 Even though I knew the call wouldn't be answered, I tried dialing anyway.

 Sure enough, it rang once before he hung up.

 So he wasn't actually busy.

 He was just occupied with charming a beauty.

 And I noticed that the woman had a profile that looked strikingly similar to Catherine's.

 I snapped back to reality, finished changing my shoes, and went to the bedroom, closing the door behind me.

 That day, after Zachariah left with the woman, I placed the medication in the living room drawer.

 I wondered what his reaction would be if he ever found it.

 But he never opened that drawer.

 Later, I learned what had happened to Catherine overseas.

 She'd been tricked into a marriage, beaten, and suffered a complete mental breakdown.

 All the women Zachariah brought home bore a resemblance to Catherine. It was clear he was taking revenge on me because of Catherine.

 But after it happened again and again, I grew numb to it all.

 The truth was, I was already counting down the days I had left.

 How could I possibly care about anything else?

 Even the man I once loved with all my heart—now, I felt nothing for him at all.

 However, I didn't want the title of Mrs. Zachariah anymore, not even a little bit.

 I had to find a way to shed it.

 Within half a year, Zachariah finally calmed down after bringing home 20 women.

 It seemed he'd grown tired of the game.

 Moreover, he started spending more time at home.

 Though when I say more, I only mean he might be around for an afternoon or two on the weekends.

 Against all odds, my body had held on for six months.

 But I knew my time was almost up.

 Now, even if I stayed home doing absolutely nothing, I still looked sickly and frail.

 One day, the sun was shining outside.

 Wrapped in a thick sweater like a burrito, I curled up at the foot of the couch, as close to the natural light as I could get.

 Ever since I got sick, I've been breaking into cold sweats, constantly feeling chilled.

 The door to his bedroom suddenly opened, and he stepped out.

 He took a couple of steps, then stopped abruptly in the living room and looked over at me.

 I felt his stare and met his eyes.

 He stood there, tall and lean, his gaze suspicious.

 ""It's sweltering outside,"" he said. ""Why are you bundled up like that?""

 It had been so long since he'd spoken to me.

 For a moment, my mind went blank.

 ""Because I'm cold,"" I replied. ""What else would it be?""

 His brows furrowed.

 ""Cold?""

 I nodded.

 His once-perfect features were now shadowed with a heavy, dark expression.

 He moved to the opposite couch and sat down, studying me intently.

 For the first time in what felt like ages. It had been so long since he'd truly looked at me.

 ""The housekeeper says you've barely been eating lately. Can't even finish half a plate?""

 I pulled my shawl tighter and met his gaze.

 ""Do you care about me?""

 Our eyes held.

 His expression remained as grave as ever.

 Probably, my small, deathly pale face looked truly worrying.

 Yet my health had been declining right under his nose, and he'd never once suspected that I might be seriously ill.

 Just as a flicker of hope sparked in me, he stood up, his slender fingers grabbing the car keys.

 ""If you're sick, go to the hospital. Don't think starving yourself and making yourself look like this will earn you sympathy. Some people don't deserve an ounce of compassion their entire lives.""

 My hope was shattered all over again.

 I scoffed.

 He reached the entryway and turned his head.

 The sound of my scoff seemed to irritate him.

 But I didn't spare him another glance.

 I turned to look at the sunlight outside.

 He seemed to hesitate for a long moment.

 In the end, though, the door slammed shut.

Chapter 4

 After that day, perhaps Zachariah had grown tired of his life outside.

 Or perhaps he genuinely sensed something was off.

 Either way, he started coming home for dinner every single night.

 When I got up from the table and stumbled, he reached out to steady me.

 He frowned slightly. ""You haven't been to the hospital?""

 I looked up. ""I went. I went a long time ago.""

 Then I lowered my gaze, pulling my hand from his and stepping back.

 The next day at dinner, just as I was about to put down my fork, he ladled some soup and set it in front of me.

 ""Drink it.""

 I looked at him, confused.

 When I didn't move, his tone softened—a rare occurrence.

 ""How can you get by on just two spoonfuls? At least drink some soup for the nutrients.""

 I thought for a moment, then picked up the mug and forced down the rich broth.

 If I wasn't mistaken, after I finished, the tightness in his face seemed to ease a little.

 Later that night, I sat wrapped in a quilt on the chaise lounge, gazing up at the star-studded sky.

 We lived in the hillside neighborhood, where the skies were clear enough to see the stars.

 Footsteps approached the balcony. In the half-light, a small flame flickered to life.

 I didn't look at him.

 I just stared intently at the night sky.

 He called me.

 ""Arianna.""

 After a long while, I replied to him, ""What is it?""

 He leaned against the railing, a small ember glowing between his fingers. ""Since when can't I just call your name for no reason?""

 I turned my head and looked at him earnestly. ""I just thought, with so many beauties to call on, why bother with me?""

 When I met his gaze, his brow seemed to soften slightly.

 I waited for his answer.

 He tilted his head back, also looking at the stars. ""But right now, I want to call your name.""

 He was still wearing his white office suit, pristine and snow-white.

 His long shadow stretched beside him.

 I turned my gaze away, looking into the distant darkness instead.

 I shook my head and said softly, ""You never wanted to call my name before. Why start now?""

 His gaze returned to me, this time direct and piercing. ""What's wrong with you?""

 I just shook my head.

 ""Nothing.""

 After a long silence, he said, ""You want a divorce?""

 I was about to answer when he turned his back.

 ""Don't even think about it. We're bound together for life.""

 ""Bound together?""

 ""Aren't we? I won't find happiness, and you won't go looking for it either.""

 ""Is that so? You could still go find Catherine. Bring her back, and you'd be happy.""

 In the cold night air, I only heard him scoff. ""You think after three years, everything can go back to how it was? Everything has changed.""

 Suddenly, he turned back, his gaze locking onto me.

 ""Isn't it true? You've changed, too. You've changed so much, I don't even recognize you.""

 Even in the dimly lit balcony, his eyes seemed to burn with intensity.

 I replied calmly, ""So it's that obvious. I must be so ugly now that it offends you. But then why come out here? If I were you, and someone was too ugly to look at, I'd choose not to look.""

 I used to care a lot about my appearance.

 If I gained a little weight, I'd diet.

 I practiced yoga to keep my figure in its best shape.

 My face was always layered with creams and serums.

 But after getting sick, no skincare could hold back the decline.

 I didn't even have the energy to put on makeup.

 Actually, that was fine. I let it be.

 Surprisingly, when I finished speaking, he froze for a split second, wearing a look of utter disbelief.

Chapter 5

 What now?

 ""I'm not talking about your appearance.""

 If it wasn't about my appearance, then what?

 He took a drag from the unlit cigarette.

 I was drowsy.

 I threw off the cool quilt and climbed down from the chaise lounge, stumbling unsteadily toward my room, feeling faint.

 In the cool night air, the person behind me seemed to take a deep breath.

 ""Arianna, from now on, let's live a good life together.""

 I came to an abrupt halt.

 My back stiffened.

 What did he mean by that?

 Live a good life in what way?

 After a moment of silence, I tentatively took it to mean that he wanted us to try to make our marriage work.

 If that really was what he meant... how many years had I waited to hear those words?

 It had been three years since we got married.

 It had been seven years since I fell in love with him.

 But if that was what he meant, the only words I could say to him now were: ""It's too late.""

 With that, I turned and went back to my bedroom, closing the door behind me.

 The next day, the housekeeper sighed and said, ""Why are there so many cigarette butts on the balcony?""

 I glanced over.

 The ground was damp with rain, littered with cigarette ash, and wet petals blown down by the wind.

 Then I caught sight of my gaunt reflection in the floor-to-ceiling window.

 An indescribable sense of desolation hung over everything.

 Ever since that night, Zachariah slipped back into his cold and unyielding self.

 The conversation we'd had on the balcony that night was like a midnight rain—washed away and gone without a trace.

 He resumed his old routine of leaving early and returning late once more.

 It was not uncommon to go days without catching a glimpse of him.

 However, not long after this, my health took a sharp turn for the worse.

 I spent my days drifting in and out of a stupor, lying in bed wracked with sharp pain, and dealing with endless nosebleeds.

 When he came home at night, the light in my room was almost always off.

 A few times, it seemed he showered in the bathroom next to my room.

 Footsteps would pause outside my door for a moment.

 But eventually, they would fade away as he walked off.

 One day, when the weather was clear, I felt unusually well.

 After washing up and putting on a sweater, I went to the hospital.

 I wanted to know exactly how much time I had left.

 Once again, the elderly doctor sighed.

 But this time, it was the heaviest sigh of all, like the deep toll of a funeral bell.

 ""You have one month left. Make your final arrangements.""

 Clutching the diagnosis report, I walked out.

 I drifted down the empty corridor like a lost soul, aimless and adrift.

 Then, I lifted my gaze.

 I stopped and looked across the corridor at Zachariah, who stood head and shoulders above the crowd, and the girl at his side.

 A hospital administrator was leading the way ahead of them.

 The girl stayed close, chatting with a faint smile on her lips.

 Just as they were about to turn the corner, he spotted me on the opposite side.

 He stopped abruptly, a swirl of emotion flickering in his eyes.

 The administrator and the girl paused too, glancing my way.

 That was when I got a clear look at her.

 I'd never seen her before, yet she still bore a faint resemblance to Catherine.

 We stared at each other for several seconds, wordless.

 It wasn't until the administrator stepped closer to him and seemed to ask, ""Mr. Gilliatt, do you know her?""

 I turned and left the hospital through another corridor.

 As expected, his words on the balcony that night didn't mean he wanted to make things work between us.

 They weren't an attempt to hold onto me, either.

 Maybe he was just toying with me.

 Lucky for me, my reply—""It is too late""—had been a rejection after all.

Chapter 6

 When I got home, an hour passed before he returned.

 I was a little surprised. It wasn't the weekend. Had he taken that girl to the hospital for a checkup?

 He was always a workaholic; after the appointment, he should have gone straight back to the office.

 At the very least, he could have stayed with her a little longer.

 Why was he home so early?

 But it was just as well.

 I happened to have something to say to him.

 He was changing his shoes in the entryway.

 I glanced at the divorce agreement on the table—the one I'd printed at a print shop on my way home.

 It was just the electronic draft our lawyer had prepared earlier.

 He finished changing his shoes and walked over, pausing in the living room as he looked at me sitting on the couch.

 ""That was an accident today. It wasn't what it looked like.""

 I pressed my lips together, ignoring his words entirely.

 Instead, I noticed what seemed to be a small error in the agreement.

 In the original draft, this marital home was supposed to go to me, while I wouldn't claim any share of his company-related assets.

 This house was originally supposed to be paid for entirely by him.

 But I gave him my wedding gifts so we could combine our money and buy it together—I thought that would make it meaningful.

 When it came to his company assets, I could have claimed a substantial amount if I'd insisted.

 But back then, I never even considered dividing his shares.

 All I wanted was a place to live after the divorce.

 But now, though, I no longer wanted this house.

 Too many women have stayed here.

 Even the thought of dying in it fills me with disgust.

 I picked up a pen and crossed out the clause granting me the house.

 I only had one month left.

 I still had 10,000 dollars in savings, which was more than enough.

 When I finally looked up, he was no longer in the living room.

 The faint scent of cigarette smoke drifted from the main bedroom.

 I picked up the agreement and walked in.

 Sure enough, he was leaning wearily against the headboard, smoking.

 His long legs were stretched out on the bed, shoes still on.

 He looked nothing like the man I'd seen at the hospital.

 I frowned.

 He'd only started smoking in the past six months, and already he was a heavy smoker.

 I cleared my throat, then drew back the sheer curtains in his room.

 He stubbed out his cigarette, reached over to turn on the air purifier, and only then looked at me.

 ""What is it?""

 If I wasn't mistaken, there was a subtle change in the way he looked at me now.

 I stared back calmly for two seconds—as if saying goodbye to the face that had consumed nearly a third of my life, the face I'd loved to the point of madness.

 After saying goodbye, I held out my hand. ""Zachariah, this is for you. Don't tear it up this time. Let's part ways amicably.""

 His expression shifted abruptly.

 That stunningly handsome face clouded over instantly, as if a storm were gathering.

 ""Arianna, I told you it was a misunderstanding today.""

 I shook my head. ""It's not important.""

 ""Why not? After our talk the other night, I haven't been involved with anyone...""

 I lowered my head, cutting him off. ""Zachariah, are you trying to keep me now?""

 He snatched the divorce agreement and tossed it aside.

 ""We've been rushing to finish a major project at the company. I've been traveling nonstop and haven't been home much. But I promise, from now on I'll make more time for us.""

 I lifted my head and stared blankly at him.

 The stormy look on his face seemed to fade. He reached for my hand.

 ""Arianna.""

 But just as his hand was about to close around mine, I pulled away.

 ""I need a divorce, Zachariah. I'm terminally ill. I'm dying.""

 ""What did you say?""

 I bent to pick up the diagnosis slip that had fallen to the floor.

 I was knocked aside when he snatched the divorce agreement.

 ""This is my diagnosis.""

 I held it out to him.

 His brow twitched as he took it.

 The more he read, the paler he grew.

 I watched as his hands began to shake, then his legs.

 Finally, his whole body was trembling.

 ""No, it can't be true. Anna, tell me this is a lie.""

 His eyes reddened. ""You made this up to get a divorce, didn't you? To trick me?""

 I looked at him, his expression utterly shattered.

 I never imagined I'd see him like this.

 He stared back, his eyes full of desperate hope.

 I smiled softly. ""That girl you were with—she was there for an appointment too, wasn't she? When you saw me at the hospital, you didn't even ask what was wrong with me.

 ""Zachariah, you never cared about me. Not even once.""

 He cut me off sharply. ""Don't say that, Anna. We can cure you. I will cure you, no matter what it takes.""

 He shot to his feet, swept me into his arms, and held me tightly.

 At that moment, I could feel his tall frame trembling uncontrollably against mine.

 His grip was so tight, I could barely breathe.",1,1769592134.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

at the show I was at the left side guarding this girl from the moshpit as she seemed like she really didnt want to be involved, turns out, we spoke afterwards and had some really cool chemistry. she asked if I was going the same way home on the bus but cause I was with my friend and didnt wanna abandon them in a unknown city I ended up staying and getting merch with them.

Navigating the world of cognitive enhancers can be overwhelming with so much information (and misinformation) out there.

Before you consider starting any nootropic regimen, we believe in a strong foundation of **key facts**. These will help you understand the core principles for safe and informed exploration.

These are:  
**1. There is a nootropic for everyone**  
Nootropics support focus, memory, and clarity, but they're **tools**, not cheat codes. And they're for anyone looking to sharpen their mind, from students to busy parents

**2. You probably are already using some nootropics**  
Caffeine in your coffee or tea is one of the most common natural nootropics. Other kitchen staples like dark chocolate or turmeric also have properties that fit the definition.

**3. Nootropics can be natural or synthetic**  
They come in both forms—herbs and plants or lab-developed compounds. Both can be effective; find what aligns with your brain chemistry and goals.

**4. Not all nootropics work the same way for everyone**  
 Our brains are unique and what works wonders for one person might do little for another. 

**5.  They take time to work**  
While immediate focus is a common goal, some compounds are also studied for their role in supporting long-term brain health and neuroplasticity (your brain's ability to adapt and grow).  
  
**6. Your environment really matters**  
Nootropics don't work in isolation. Sleep, diet, stress, and even your surroundings significantly influence your cognitive state. They should complement a healthy foundation, not replace it.

If you want to find out more facts about nootropics, our team at CogniWiki has put together a detailed beginner's guide.

**You can find the full breakdown here:** [**Key Facts About Nootropics You Need to Know**](https://go.cogniwiki.com/reddit-nootropics-guide)

We wrote it to be the clear, factual, and safety-first resource we wished we had when starting out.

My question is, is there any workaround here?  
Is it possible to access the machine directly, flash different firmware, use a third-party app, or otherwise change things like water amount for tea, coffee strength, or scheduling without the official app?

Popping in, more to hold myself accountable, share my plan (which I know won't be popular) and just help boost others on their journey and being totally honest, I'll likely need a boost from time to time myself. 

So, about me. weighing in at 140kgs but hiding some of it well, people typically guess me at 120kgs. 

I want/need to get into those double digits again!

So I'm going to get back into nightly runs/walks and find weekend activities that get me moving a bit more than I currently am. 

Now, I suck at portion control, so I'm focusing on that this year, I also probably take in a lot of hidden carbs and calories, don't get me wrong, I know bread isn't great for me but I don't know what else to grab in the morning for breakfast whilst I rush out the door. 

Unpopular plan incoming, set lasers to sting. 

To get a bit of a kick start I bought some optislim (21 shakes) as they were on super special and I figured I could down some gross shakes for a week as a kickstart, do a week of normal eating, another week of shakes etc, hopefully to lose the first 5kg and then focus really hard on portion control and good choices once there's a visual result on the scales and some motivation to keep going.

shakes aren't sustainable long or even mid term, I just want to hit a point where I won't go back above where I started. 

These things are the VLCD (compared to the LCD) and by George do they taste awful, so I'm gonna have to add a coffee shot or half a banana to get these things down. 

Anyway, if you are still reading down here, thank you and I want to check in every week with what I did well and what I sucked at, you can mute me and I'll just scream it into the void as a record for myself, it's honestly all good. 

Take care, be kind and thank you. ",2,1769591211.0,loseit,1,1.0,False

I noticed how my male relatives are treated as human beings with respect whereas I am seen as irrational. For context, I do come from a middle eastern household that still believes women need an escort to do anything outside of the realm of walking outside to go to college so maybe i am talking from a more pessimistic perspective.

Like if my anxiety is related to feeling bad vibes at an event or my intuition or gut feels off about a decision, I am seen as crazy and stupid. If my male relative needs a new towel every day because he is afraid of the towel he used 24 hrs ago, it is totally fine and normal and not irrational. Or if he buys ten of the same coffee mugs because he can't use the same two or three, it is fine. But if I were to spend money on three items, it is indulgent. Or if he feels the need to probe and obsess and ask questions about something I said in a conversation or anything in general, he is being inquisitive and smart whereas If I were to do the same thing, i am worrying too much, causing problems and am accused of being paranoid.

I have told him many times now (about 6) that I want small things like for him to make me coffee in the morning etc and I want him to treat me kindly.

It has been slowly getting better but I’m not seeing him put that much effort into it. It’s hard not getting what I need out of this relationship. 

Another thing is I find him attractive but in bed sometimes he does things I don’t find attractive, or just things like putting his legs up and then farting it’s so stupid and it immediately gives me the ick and I want him to stop. Sometimes I feel like a mother of an iPad kid. I feel like our sex life has depleted because of it. Due to that I often feel embarrassed to post about him or show him off to people. My mom said to me while we were in a bad spot that “you wouldn’t be with a guy that looks like that if he wasn’t kind to you” and my friends have said that he isn’t very kind in the past but that was before we where official. I am feeling very insecure about that. 

What I’m asking for is how do I bring this up with him (the first paragraph) without it being a fight or another nagging session on my part. And 2 how do I get over this insecurity or does anyone else relate?

I’m currently looking for a grinder and could use some advice from the community.

# Location

Spain (Valencia)

**Preferred drink types**

Mainly **filter coffee** (V60 / batch-style).

In the future, I’d like to build an **espresso setup**, so I’m looking for something that could potentially work for both.

**Drink frequency**

1–2 cups per day. 

# Space

Normal home kitchen. Limited counter space, so very large commercial setups might be an issue.

# Experience level

Home coffee enthusiast. Not a complete beginner, but not a professional barista either.

**Manual or electric**

Electric grinder.

**Candidates**

Within my budget, I was initially considering modern home grinders like the **Fellow Opus** or **DF54**.

However, where I live there are many good second-hand deals (often barely new) on older commercial grinders from brands like **Cunill**, **Ascaso**, and **Compak**.

Currently available near me at good prices:



* **Cunill Jamaica TRON INOX On Demand** (60 mm flat burrs)
* **Cunill Tranquilo TRON On Demand** (60 mm flat burrs)
* **Cunill Marfil TRON** (60 mm flat burrs)
* **Ascaso F4 ECO** (58 mm flat burrs, 1400 rpm)

**Main concerns / questions**

* Are these older commercial grinders a good idea for **filter-first home use**?
* How bad is retention on these models?
* Are grind adjustments practical when switching between filter and espresso?
* Are the burrs easy to replace or upgrade, and compatible with third-party burrs?
* Would a modern home grinder be a better compromise for filter now and espresso later?



Any advice or personal experience would be greatly appreciated. Thanks",2,1769589946.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

# How Does NeuroPrime Work?

**NeuroPrime** is designed to support brain performance by optimizing how the brain communicates and processes information.

Its mechanism of action begins with **enhancing neurotransmitter activity,** which is essential for fast, clear signal transmission between brain cells.

This leads to improved focus, memory recall, and mental clarity[.](https://www.nuvectramedical.com/memoshield-reviews/) A unique claim made about NeuroPrime is its ability to detoxify the pineal gland, a small but significant part of the brain linked with melatonin production.

By supporting this gland’s function, the supplement may help regulate sleep cycles and improve the brain’s ability to reset and repair, leading to better overall mental function. ,

NeuroPrime is said to incorporate adaptogens and other botanicals that help manage stress, reduce cognitive fatigue, and enhance mental energy without relying on caffeine or artificial stimulants.

1qp5ypu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qp5ypu,Behind The Headlines: What‘s Going On With Cuts in Dramas - Are We Really Losing Our CEOs?,"**What’s Really Being Cut in Vertical Dramas — and Why**

If it feels like there’s a sudden crackdown on vertical dramas—and that they used to fly under the radar—you’re not alone. I assumed the same. But that assumption doesn’t hold up.

The real distinction between traditional TV dramas and verticals isn’t whether censorship applies. It’s when and how it’s enforced. Long-format dramas go through script approval, then final review, before receiving a red distribution license. Short-form dramas follow a different enforcement model altogether.

———————

**TL;DR:** Vertical dramas aren’t “less censored.” They’re regulated later and faster. Instead of pre-approval, they face post-release scrutiny—quick edits, removals, and takedowns—especially when stories lean too hard into sex, flashing wealth, or responsibility-free desire.

———————-

Short dramas often look looser on the surface, but in practice they’re subject to intense post-release monitoring. That includes rapid takedowns, retroactive scene cuts, and algorithmic suppression for repeat offenders - shadow bans.

So what actually triggers post-release censoring?

When it comes to intimacy, morality, and relationships, one rule consistently applies:

**Desire without responsibility is unacceptable.**

Once you view stories through that lens, recurring narrative patterns start to make sense.

That’s also why fan favorite cheating storylines usually end with harsh consequences. Structurally, these outcomes aren’t accidental—they align with the underlying moral code.

In many verticals, cheating wives lose everything: they end up all alone crying buckets full of tears, they are financially ruined, painfully disabled, or even dead. Meanwhile, the “green-hat” husband—the Chinese idiom for a cuckolded man— doesn‘t look back, cuts ties and enjoys success and happiness. There’s no redemption allowed.

Male cheaters fare no better unless the affair is reframed as a misunderstanding.  Otherwise, the formula is familiar: loss of status and wealth, public disgrace, a spiraling mistress, and jail time- because erosion of moral responsibility comes in pairs. For fans of this genre  this [Tit For Tat](https://rumble.com/v74qs10-after-i-woke-up-i-taught-him-to-keep-his-distance.html) drama is a typical and very satisfying one— it’s dishing out justice in full measure.

When a male lead is abusive  —chasing a “white moonlight” while mistreating the female lead but not physically cheating --redemption may still be possible, but only after sustained suffering and explicit remorse. These arcs are mandatory, not optional.

Mistresses, meanwhile, are despised figures. San—literally “three,” the term for a third party in a marriage—carries an inherently negative charge. Male and female leads alike repeatedly stress only half jokingly that they want a “name,” they need legal standing. If a married woman actually does cross the line, the narrative must first establish her husband as irredeemable: he’s abusive, openly flaunts his immoral behavior, brings his affair partner into the marital home to side with her against his wife, steals the FL‘s fortune  and pushes her down the staircase so that she loses her baby and the ability to have kids in general. Sounds exaggerated? We’re talking about verticals - and exactly this moral groundwork is laid out in [Younger Brother, He Fights and Grabs ](https://youtu.be/Pq3SXaUlY0g?si=1p2eHjhND-p666L8)(Min Jie & Liu Xi Yu- a romcom!), where extensive justification is required before the female lead is excused for pursuing love while still legally married.

Casual intimacy, in contrast, is virtually nonexistent. Friends-with-benefits plots? Invisible. What does exist is transactional romance or sugar-dating—but always with consequences. A painful emotional awakening, a reckoning, a change of ways has to happen and marriage is the inevitable outcome.

A recent example is the romcom [Sugar Mummy and her kept man](https://reelxia.com/drama/Ma) (one of the Top 10 verticals in 2025) - the FL is a low offender, she has no clue how love and a relationship could work so it’s an emotional awakenung and acknowledgement only.

A whole cluster of dramas revolves around “canaries”—kept women who are opportunistic only on the surface. They’re secretly in love, just in hiding to avoid humiliation on top of their pain and they wait for recognition. The recurring plot is the ML  realizing through tribulations that she is “the one.” A story retold a few times: “The Canaries are escaping again” — [Du Ya Fei version](https://mydramalist.com/786648-the-canaries-are-escaping-again);  [Zhang Yi Yang version ](https://mydramalist.com/786648-the-canaries-are-escaping-again)) 

Regulatory attention tends to follow trends. Since late 2024, CEO dramas—especially in short form—have faced increased scrutiny. Headlines claiming China is “removing rich boss / poor bride dramas” overstate the case. What’s actually happening is targeted guidance aimed primarily at micro-dramas, discouraging narratives built on money worship and ostentatious displays of power, not romance itself.

One regulatory notice put it bluntly:

“Short-form dramas should not deliberately chase popularity by promoting materialism or by flaunting wealth, power, or hedonistic lifestyles.”

The quintessential catnip CEO looking hot in his Porsche and designer clothes, throwing around his money and his weight , —hasn’t vanished, but he’s been reworked. Responsibility matters.

By 2025, many productions had already adapted. CEOs are more often self-made rather than inherited-wealth heirs (富二代), and they are front runners in socially acceptable— i.e. beneficial to China as a nation-  industries like AI, drones, or software. Female leads are no longer carrying coffee trays and running errands only; they’re ambitious, educated, and strive for financial independency.

This shift may also explain the rise of government officials and public servants as romantic leads. These characters reliably fight corruption and embody restraint. They are powerful, they are privileged — but it’s earned and never abused. The message is consistent: Responsibility is key.

You can see this reframing clearly in [青山归杳处 /Where the Green Mountains Return to the Distant Place](https://youtu.be/JtshrF78cfM), where Wang Haozhen plays a  morally grounded lead - high ranking official-  in a slow burn romance. Similar patterns appear in dramas featuring [Wang Kaimu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0a-68pWX-LM) as a dutiful politician opposite a restrained Wang Gege (teacher).They both are figures of moral authority and valiantly try to set things right after a one-night stand meant to save a drugged FL. Even the ONS gets a double endorsement, as you may have noticed. In Wang Chenpeng’s [Roses And Green Pines/ Await The Flowers](https://odysee.com/@YooriCshort:3/Await-The-Flowers:f), an age gap romance the powerful Secretary of State is influential and respected—but conspicuous excess is absent.

*As an aside: in the Wang Haozhen drama, the scumbag Ex/ second male lead embodies exactly what current guidance discourages—a flashy heir with luxury cars, status symbols, and moral emptiness.*

Female leads, too, have shifted. They’re increasingly portrayed as well educated professionals, entrepreneurs, and even pampered heiresses surprise with independent business ventures— these competent women start to replace the former totally disenfranchised damsels in distress. The noticeable difference in all this is that these women strive for more status through their own efforts - poor yes, but they fight for education. So Cinderellas still do exist, but she’s working on her college education while handling side jobs and sick elderly relatives.

Another trend gaining traction is arranged-marriage stories. Legal legitimacy is established upfront, allowing slow-burn romance without moral complications. Even steam can pass the scrutiny then - as seen in the beloved and rave reviewed drama  [Half-Mature Husband](https://mydramalist.com/803180-ban-shu-lao-gong) starring Wang Kaimu and Xu Zhen Zhen. Popular clusters (stories filmed several times with different cast but released nearly simu) include  [Newlyweds slowburn   - here: Huang Haowen version ](https://youtu.be/KjhEODHktzs?si=cErxsxI36t4XCLg_)(6 versions so far) and Long-lasting marriage with 8 versions   - representative  here is [Wedding Night Burned out](https://odysee.com/@elishah16j:d/Wedding-Night,-Burned-Out:4) starring Zhong Zheng & Yang Shuyu. 

Regulation doesn’t stop with romance. Child-led dramas have also come under scrutiny. Authorities have flagged “adultification” and the exploitation of young performers, banning plots that cast children in manipulative, scheming, or socially toxic roles.

Frankly, it’s difficult to argue against protecting five- to ten-year-olds from adult-coded narratives, extreme workloads, and the vertical industry’s tight production schedules.

Across the board, prohibited content remains consistent: sex, fetishization, sexual violence, prolonged kissing, explicit sexual dialogue, and moral ambiguity without consequences.

The underlying principle hasn’t changed:

Desire without responsibility cannot pass.

So how do creators adapt? By implication rather than depiction. Symbolism replaces explicit action.

The famous camera move to goldfish swimming in a glass, chimes  moving in a breeze and billowing curtains are a mood.

Endings are shaped to comply— it’s marriage, separation, or punishment. Some projects still push boundaries and risk cuts. But as vertical drama stars become more marketable and brand partnerships more valuable, production teams increasingly play it safe. Sponsors dislike controversy and vanished series.

For newer actors, though, bold material is still very much on the table —at least for now.

**Bottom line**

Chinese drama censorship isn’t chaotic or new. It’s structured, ideology-driven, and moral in nature. Creators who understand that framework don’t confront it directly—they design stories that move within it.

And yes—there’s still hope.

I’ll be honest, I never thought I’d be posting here about matcha. Until 3 months ago, my days were spent in boardrooms and legal briefs, first as a lawyer and then in a strategy role. But after one too disappointing, over-sugared, or just-plain-watery matcha drink in my city, something in me snapped.

Why is it so hard to find good, authentic matcha in Hyderabad?

That frustration slowly turned into an idea, and that idea is now become real: we launched small, pop-up style matcha bar here in Hyderabad focused purely on quality, and that beautiful umami kick that real matcha is supposed to deliver.

This is completely new territory for me. I’m learning everything from sourcing ceremonial-grade powder to understanding local taste preferences, and I’m embracing the chaos that comes with leaving a structured corporate life for something you’re genuinely passionate about.

I’m not here to sell you anything today, but I would love your support in another way: follow along as we document this journey.

Got her instagram that night (l usually ask for numbers but forgot to since we were showing each other something on instagram). I texted her the next day in the evening asking if she had plans for Sunday (which she did) but she said she would be free the weekend after. I proposed we grab coffee and hit the beach town near us to walk, grab a coffee, and spend some time together.

The date went great, probably as good as it could have possibly gone, the chemistry we had at the bar was still there. It ended around 5:00 PM. Walked her to her car, gave her a hug, had some playful banter for about a minute or so, walked back to my car and I messaged her as I was leaving to let me know when she got home.

• Her: ""i will! :)""

• 20 mins later: ""Home safe! I had a lot of fun, thank you so much for the coffee! Hope to see you soon :)""

• Her again: ""Imk when u get home too!""

I got home about an hour later and replied: ""Got home, had a great time!""

A few minutes later, I sent: ""See you soon :) 123-XXX-XXXX"" to move things off Instagram. Thought it was smooth and put the ball in her court (it's been my go-to for a while and it's never failed me)

She didn't read or respond to my last 2 messages for about 20 hours.

The next day (Monday) at around 2PM, I posted a lowkey story of my car in front of a restaurant. She viewed it within 10 minutes. Right after viewing the story, she went into our DMs and ""liked"" both messages I had sent the night before including the one with my phone number. But she didn't reply, and she hasn't texted the number.

It is now Wednesday morning. It's been over 60 hours since I gave her the number and about 40 hours since she ""liked"" it.

I'm confused by the ""like"" on the phone number message without an actual text. Her post date energy was high, but this feels like a stall and I'm not sure what to make of this.

Probably an overreaction but need some advice on this. Just don't want to waste time if I can see subtle signs this early on. Do I plan a second date?

**TDLR: After a coffee date where she (21F) explicitly messaged ""hope to see you soon,"" I gave her my number to move our conversation off Instagram. Although she ""liked"" the DM containing my number on Monday after viewing my story, she hasn't actually texted me, leaving me (23M) unsure whether to send one last concrete invite or move on.**",1,1769589346.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1qp5q71,https://www.reddit.com/r/askcarsales/comments/1qp5q71/if_youre_a_car_salesman_please_answer_desperately/,"If you’re a car salesman, please answer. Desperately need help!","**Summary**:

Boyfriend works approximately six days a week, 12 hours a day at a car dealership. No base pay. He makes commission at only $150 per car. His paycheck is slightly above the national minimum wage (covers rent and that’s pretty much it). Toxic work environment. Will it get better? Or do I push harder and encourage him to find another path. Help!

—————

Hello! I never post on Reddit, but I’m really upset by my partner’s job as a car salesman and I need advice. I don’t know much about this field and I just want to see if I’m being overly frustrated or not.

This is a longer post. I need to rant, but I also need insight.

So basically, my boyfriend got a job at this car dealership nearby last fall. They hired him right off the bat, and he was stoked.

For the first three months, he was on a “training plan.” He made no commission, and was paid $7.25 an hour. He had to be there everyday though and was still encouraged to make sales. He sold I think eight cars in those three months. Never saw any payment from them though.

Now, he’s off the training plan and he makes commission. Yay, right? Except he receives no base pay and it’s purely commission. He’s been doing really well and has sold about two - four cars a week since coming off the plan. Plus some “half-deals.” However, he only gets about $150 per car he sells, and then like 3% or something from what the “numbers guy” makes. His paycheck comes back and let me tell you— we made way more individually as servers at a low tier restaurant.

He works five days a week. No health insurance, no holiday pay, no overtime pay, nothing. They even CHARGE him a monthly fee to use the soda and coffee machines. I think he has like 2 shifts a week that are 8 hours, and then rest are 12 hours. He usually ends up working 12 hours if not more everyday though. AND he typically goes in on his day off to help a customer. They also bombard him when he comes home (not even the customers, but his CO-WORKERS). He can’t escape work.

This dealership has a minimum of 10 salesmen, usually 15, just standing around everyday, and there is no order to who gets the customers. This has resulted in him being elbowed out of the way by coworkers, or coworkers running past him to greet a customer before he can get to them. This seems so immature, and as a buyer, I’d go running the opposite direction personally if a hoard of salesmen came running at me.

Lastly, my partner was the primary actor in a lot of the dealership’s promo videos on their social media. The marketing guy sucked, so my partner started scripting and filming his own videos. They’re actually doing very well. He’s single-handedly bringing in customers. He’s had like seven of these videos go viral across social media! People come in asking FOR him.

Thing is, they won’t compensate him! He’s ask over and over, and his boss keeps pushing it off. Now he’s saying that “I think in the future there’s a *possibility*.” Bullshit!

They keep telling him to make more videos and how great they are, but they won’t. pay. him. And the marketing guy is still there for some reason?! And he gets paid MORE than my boyfriend!

My partner is hardworking and so charismatic and kind and I feel like they are taking advantage of his good will. He stopped college temporarily, has been on a year break, and he’s now lost all confidence in his academic abilities and thinks that because he’s a “drop out,” that this is the best he can do. This man is not even 21 yet people.

He missed out on the holidays for this job (which was for nothing because the dealership was slow during those days anyways), he is telling me that they won’t let him have work off for the planned vacations we have this summer, and overall— I just see him way way less these days. I am supportive. I swing by to drop off lunches, I cheer him up when he gets home, and I encourage him everyday.

I’m tired of it being for nothing though! I feel so helpless.

And for what? He’s not making enough to justify ANY of this.

Is this just how it is for a beginner salesman? Will it get better?

He keeps telling me that come summer time, the paycheck will finally be worth it. But he said the same thing for Christmas.

I am sorry for the long tangent. I am beyond irritated and I need people who are in this line of work to help me understand what’s normal and what’s not.",6,1769588687.0,askcarsales,6,0.8,False

Let me explain: I put in the 8g dose, set the scale to start counting the timer when the coffee begins to drip, it takes about 5 seconds for the pre-infusion, and when I reach 16 grams of coffee, I remove the cup and release the button. This coincides with roughly 25 seconds, but drops continue to fall until there are 24 grams of coffee in the cup!

My boyfriend has been using the same beat up thermos for years. It technically works but he complains about it constantly. Coffee gets lukewarm halfway through the morning, he forgets it on his desk, reheats it, forgets again. Rinse and repeat. Every single workday.

He is not someone who wants random stuff. He likes practical things he actually uses. That’s why I am leaning toward an Ember Mug.

The idea of having hot coffee at his desk all day honestly sounds like something he would appreciate way more than flowers or another generic gift. It also feels like one of those “tech gifts” that’s subtle. Not flashy, just quietly useful every day.

Heavy 2000s metal/streetwear energy. The graphic is massive and the ""Godspeed"" font is classic.It's a statement piece, but definitely niche. If the print quality holds up after a wash, it’s a win. A bit loud for daily wear, but great for a specific fit.

Score: 7/10

2. Alo Yoga Black Hoodie

Ultra-minimalist ""clean girl/guy"" aesthetic.It’s basically just a high-end blank. The material feels soft, but honestly, you're paying for the tiny ""alo"" logo. Good for the gym or a coffee run, but nothing groundbreaking.

Score: 6.5/10

3. Stüssy ""Built Tough"" Hoodie

Classic West Coast streetwear.You can't really go wrong with Stüssy. The back graphic is iconic, though these ""paragraph"" prints are starting to feel a bit played out in some circles. Still a solid, reliable piece for the rotation.

Score: 7.5/10

4. NY Zip-Up Hoodie (The Grail of the haul) ⭐

Peak ""Old School New York"" meets modern silhouette.This is easily my favorite piece. The navy is deep, the white NY logo pop is perfect, and the crop/oversized cut looks way better in person than the others. It’s got that effortless ""I just threw this on"" look that actually takes effort to pull off. Absolute banger.

Score: 9.5/10

5. Carhartt WIP Heart Hoodie

Workwear but make it ""soft.""The grey heather is a nice break from all the dark colors. The heart logo is a cool twist on the standard patch. It feels sturdy, like it’ll actually last a decade.

Score: 8/10

6. Enfants Riches Déprimés (ERD) Green Hoodie

Punk-luxury / ""I'm rich and bored.""That neon green is aggressive. You really have to have the confidence to pull this off without looking like a highlighter. The ""enfants"" box logo is clean, but the color makes it hard to style regularly.

Score: 6/10

7. Needles Track Jacket (Dusty Pink/Purple)

Sophisticated Japanese vintage sportswear.The colorway is unique—kind of a mauve/taupe with purple stripes. Needles always hits, but it can look like a pajamas top if you don't style it with the right trousers.

Score: 8/10

8. Vetements All-Over Logo Knit

Total logomania chaos.This is a ""love it or hate it"" piece. It’s objectively ""too much,"" but that’s the whole point of Vetements. It’s heavy and feels premium, but you'll definitely get looks (not all of them good).

Score: 5.5/10 (Subjective, but it's a lot to handle)

9. Chrome Hearts Belt

High-end Rockstar aesthetic.This is a solid pick if you want to elevate a basic denim fit. The silver-tone hardware is sleek, and the logo isn't as overbearing as a massive ""H"" or ""GG"" buckle, which keeps it a bit more tasteful. It’s a versatile piece that bridges the gap between the loud graphics and the cleaner hoodies in your haul.

Score: 8/10

10. Chrome Hearts Orange Cross Camo Hat

Early 2000s trucker style meets luxury streetwear.This is a bold choice. The orange cross patches against the camo are high-contrast and definitely demand attention. While it's a ""grail"" item for many, camo can be tricky to style without looking like you're heading to the woods unless the rest of your fit is very intentional. It pairs perfectly with the Godspeed hoodie if you're going for that aggressive, ""loud"" look.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )
