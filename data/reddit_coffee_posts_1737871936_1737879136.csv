1ia96bx,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1ia96bx/postwedding_very_detailed_recap_and_budget/,Post-Wedding Very Detailed Recap and Budget Breakdown: Los Angeles June 2024,"Hello everyone, this subreddit was extremely helpful when I was planning my wedding last year, and I found the most helpful posts to be former brides posting their budget recaps. I just saw one posted a few hours ago and it reminded me that I wanted to do the same after my wedding!

Here is my post-wedding recap for all you data nerds out there! Heads up that this will be long because brides talking about the finer details of their weddings was what helped me out the most and I'm hoping to provide the same help to all the future brides out there!

High Level Details:

* Location: Rancho Palos Verdes, CA
* Headcount: 141 RSVP'd yes - 134 adults, 7 kids. 2 people no-showed last minute (honestly I was expecting more so it's water under the bridge)
* Overview: Standard golf course wedding with ceremony, cocktail hour, and plated dinner reception with open dancing to follow all at one location.
* Friday wedding with an after party + Thursday rehearsal dinner + Saturday farewell brunch

The Budget:

This budget is all inclusive for everything related to our actual wedding week, but does not include my engagement ring or our honeymoon.

* Total Spent: $62,320.72
* Venue, Food, Beverages, Rentals: $27,675.91
   * This was by far our biggest chunk of expenses because after starting our research, I realized I would be completely overwhelmed managing different vendors for food, bar, rentals, etc. We didn't have a wedding planner, and I knew I didn't want to put that extra work on myself. We purposely chose a venue that leaned towards the ""all-inclusive"" side.  So the price above included the following:
      * 6 hour use of the venue space itself (outdoor ceremony on a grassy part of the golf course, cocktail hour on the hall's balcony patio, and indoor reception in their hall) + 6 hours early access for vendor set up + venue use the day before for our ceremony rehearsal
      * The ceremony fee
      * All chair, table, linen, flatware, plates, cups, etc. rentals
      * All food and drinks (tray passed hors d'oeuvres at cocktail hour, plated 2 course dinner + bread baskets, 4 hours of fully open bar at their standard level alcohol, coffee, juices, water, etc.)
      * All waitstaff and bartenders
      * Cleanup (for anything venue provided)
      * Parking (shared parking lot with the regular golf course visitors, but there was plenty of parking and it was very close to the reception hall)
   * I also grouped a few extra food things we did into this category. So subtract these amounts from the $27k+ number above and that's how much we paid the venue.
      * $1300 - Specialty Cultural Dessert Bar
      * $88.17 - Extra Dessert Cookies
      * $36.98 - Late Night Snacks
* Photo & Video: $7,163.88
   * When we first started planning, my husband and I picked 3 things we wanted to prioritize, and photography was at the top of my list because I knew it was the only tangible thing I'd be left with after the wedding.  So I know this is a lot, BUT I do not regret a single cent we spent on this category.  I absolutely love our photos and video and will treasure them for life.
   * Further Breakdown as there are a few categories I grouped under this:
      * $5,250 + $200 tip- Wedding Photography Package
      * $475 + $50 tip- Photo Booth
      * $350 + $50 tip - Videographer
      * $130.23 - Extra gear for videographer
      * $58.65 - Livestream service
      * $500 + $100 tip - Engagement Photos
* Music: $4,950.00
   * My husband and are I both musicians, so having good music was super important for us on our wedding day.
      * $3600 + $100 tip - DJ
      * $800 + $450 tip - Live Band
* Apparel: $2,319.00
   * $1152.38 - My dress
      * I got super lucky and found my dress at a sample sale, and it fit almost perfectly.  I hardly needed any alterations, and the ones I needed my mom was able to do.  I had tried on similar dresses at other stores (I had a cathedral length train and intricate lace detailing) that retailed for over $3k so I thought this was a steal.
   * $374.93 - Accessories + other wedding outfits
      * Between my accessories, shoes, veils, and outfits for the other wedding events that week, this is how much I spent.  I found most of these on Amazon.  I did end up getting custom converse shoes and wore those as my reception shoes.
   * $516.70 - Husband's suit + alterations
      * Got this at Men's Wearhouse. Was really happy with the quality and the fit.
   * $274.99 - Groomsmen's Outfits
      * We asked the groomsmen to wear a traditional shirt from our culture for our ceremony, and we felt bad making them find/pay for this themselves since they'd likely never use them again.  We ended up finding a store in our home country who could custom make these shirts for a pretty cheap price.  We got all the groomsmen's measurements and had their shirts tailor made. The cost of living is much cheaper there, so this turned out really affordable.  This is the cost for 10 custom made traditional shirts for the 8 groomsmen, 1 ring bearer, and my husband.  Thankfully we knew someone who was visiting at the time and picked up the shirts on our behalf and brought them back to the US.
* Hair & Makeup: $1,538.60
   * $1238.60 - Day Of Wedding Makeup
      * This includes bride's HMUA, MOB HMUA, MOG MUA (wanted to do her hair herself), travel fees, credit card fees.  Some of the bridal party opted to get their HMUA done, so they paid for their own portions, but there were extra fees like taxes and credit card fees which I just covered on behalf of the entire party.
   * $300 - Bridal Trial (hair and makeup)
      * I wasn't thrilled about shelling out an extra $300 for a trial, but it eased my nerves tremendously leading up to the wedding because it built a lot of trust in my artists.  Worth it for that peace of mind. One of my big fears was that I would hate my makeup and I'd be stuck with these pictures for the rest of my life.
* Flowers & Decor: $1839.19
   * $577.18 - DIY Flowers
      * Flowers were very close to the bottom of my list for things I cared about, but they were still the most economical and logistically-easy option for decor.  Thankfully, LA has access to one of the largest wholesale flower markets in the country.  My MOH and I went early on Wednesday and bought $360 of flowers and greenery.  I catered dinner and the bridesmaids and I did a bouquet night at the Airbnb on Wednesday.  Each girl made their own bouquet + helped with the extra arrangements we needed.  I had 9 bridesmaids and 14 tables.  We repurposed each of the bridesmaid bouquets after the ceremony as reception centerpieces and then had the bridesmaids make 5 extra for the remaining tables.  I also made my own bouquet.  It was actually so fun to do this because I gave the girls free rein on their bouquet design.  It was really cool to see their personality come out in their bouquet, and I enjoyed the extra girl time with my best friends.  It's infrequent that we all get a chance to all hang out nowadays. I picked all white flowers to keep things simple, and we ended up with way too many flowers at the end. I included the cost of dinner that night in the above number which was $170.04. The various supplies I also bought like ribbons, pins, dollar tree vases, etc. came out to $47.14.  It also helped that we opted not to do any bouts or corsages for the other party members.
   * $550 + $100 tip - Arch Florist
      * Now the one thing that I did hire out for flowers was our ceremony arch.  I was ambitious at first and thought making our own arch seemed doable, but the more I thought about it, the more I stressed.  Thank god I was able to find a florist who was willing to just do the arch and allowed us to do the rest of the flowers.  We had a full ground arch that encircled my husband, me, and our officiant at the front of the aisle.  100% worth it.  It was soooo stunning, and would have been so stressful to make and set up ourselves.
   * $146.5 - Bouquet Preservation
      * Found a wonderful team on Etsy. I opted to get 4 coasters with my flowers preserved in them.  I didn't want anything too big, and I wanted something functional.  This was perfect, and I love how they turned out.
   * $404.93 - Various Games and Amenities
      * This is one of the parts of the budget that I am extremely happy to have spent on.  In the great scheme of things, this line item was negligible, but it had such an outsized value on the guest experience.  We wanted to make sure our guests had plenty of entertainment so we had the following: temporary tattoo station, table games, glow bracelets and necklaces, giant foam glow sticks as dance props, personalized kids bags, tissues, fans, emergency kit, and more.  These were just small touches that we added for our guests' experience/convenience, and they really paid off.  People still mention some of these elements to us today.
   * $60.52 - Signage and Misc Decor
      * We got lucky and had a lot of friends recently get married so they passed down a lot of their signage like frames, etc.  This was what we spent for other signage or random decor we needed.
* Day Of Coordinator - $1100.00
   * $800 + $300 tip - we yet again got lucky and one of my SIL's close friends is a DOC.  She gave us an awesome discount and did our DOC for $800.  We were so appreciative of her and her assistant and all of their hard work that we gave them a $300 tip.  That being said, she did mention that we were the easiest couple she's ever worked with because we were extremely organized.  So I'm glad we made her life easier!  We would have died without them.  If you don't have a wedding planner, PLEASE at least have a DOC.  It will make your day just run so much more smoothly and actually allow you to enjoy your day.
* Stationary - $235.26
   * This was another line item I really did not care to spend on.  I designed pretty much everything on Canva and then printed them ourselves.  This cost includes card stock, place cards, newspaper programs, invitations, thank you cards, signage, postage, but does not include the cost of ink and our printer.   Pretty much everything that was a paper product, we made ourselves.
* Rehearsal Dinner - $394.76
   * Our families really helped us out with this one.  We hosted the rehearsal dinner at the Airbnb, but I excluded the cost of the Airbnb in this and grouped it into the accommodation line item.  My moms and aunts and my husband's mom really helped us with this.  They spent a huge portion of Thursday cooking and/or picking up food for the rehearsal dinner, so the only cost my husband and I really had to take on was the liquor.  We bought all of it at Costco, and it was more than enough for 50 people.
* After Party: $1504.39
   * $784.39 - Table Service at a Local Bar
      * Knowing our crowd, we knew a wedding ending at 11pm would leave them wanting for more so we reserved a section at a local bar and ordered two bottles.  We're happy we did this because it was a great way to cap off the night and give out-of-town guests a taste of what local nightlife was like.
   * $720 - Party Bus
      * Our venue was about 30 minutes from the nightlife scene, and we didn't want the party vibes to die in transit to the after party.  We got really lucky and my husband actually has a friend who used to own a limo service.  He got us a great discount through his connections, and we were able to get a 30 person party bus to take us and the bridal party from the venue to the bar, wait for us at the bar, and then transport us to our hotel at the end of the night.  It was perfect because the energy stayed up the whole time and it provided a safe place for people to leave their things.  The bridal party went on the bus, but other guests met us at the bar.
* Farewell Lunch: $2,699.02
   * We decided to host a casual lunch at a buffet in the area on Saturday.  The buffet was really awesome because we only had to pay for the people who showed up instead of the number we reserved.  We reserved 150 seats. We anticipated a lot of last-minute cancellations due to hangovers, being tired, etc, and I believe around 120 people ended up showing.  We invited family, out of town guests, bridal party, and also extended the invite to people's children.  Our wedding was no kids (exceptions being our flower girl, ring bearer, and babies under 18 months), so opening up the lunch to our loved ones' children gave us a way to include the kids in a casual setting without breaking the bank.  There were probably around 15-20 people who came to the lunch who couldn't come to the wedding so it was nice that we got to see them.
* Accommodations: $4,745.25
   * $2,767.74 - Airbnb for Wednesday - Saturday
      * I rented an airbnb in the area that we ended up using for multiple purposes.
      * $1977.51 - Groomsmen Suite at Hotel Block Thursday - Sunday
* Gifts: $2,030.86
   * We really wanted to make our bridal party and families feel appreciated because we know how much commitment being part of a wedding can be.  So we got gifts for all of our key people.
   * $1436.62 - Bridal Party Gifts
      * I really wanted to focus on getting the girls things they could use outside of the wedding weekend.  I got the girls a custom gold-plated initialed bracelet from GLDN, belt bags, hair restore oil, and lip balm. For my MOH, I got her all of the above plus a matching gold-plated necklace from GLDN with her birth flower and birth stone, and I also paid for her manicure. I had 8 bridesmaids including my MOH
      * For the boys, we decided to gift their shoes that we requested as part of their ceremony outfit (white Vans).  For the best man, my husband procured a signed jersey of BM's favorite soccer player and framed it.  He's a huge sports guy, so he loved this.  He had 8 groomsmen including BM.
   * $594.24 - Other Gifts
      * Between our officiant, parents, flower girl, ring bearer, and various other people who helped throughout the wedding, we gifted them things that we thought they would like as a small thank you.
* Prenup: $2690.00
   * Alright, some people may not include this into their wedding budget, but we viewed this as a cost that wouldn't happen if we weren't getting married, so we included it.  We found a flat rate lawyer who drafted it, and another flat rate lawyer who reviewed it (separate attorneys).  Highly recommend doing this because it turned out there were some unresolved financial things (both logistical and emotional) that my fiance and I needed to work through before getting married, and this brought those to light.  I think it laid a great foundation to set off our marriage on the right foot.
* Miscellaneous - $1434.66
   * $783.00 - Getting Ready Food & Beverage
      * This was the cost of food and drinks the morning of the wedding. I ordered a big catering order of Mendocino Farms sandwiches and salads for everyone who was getting ready at the Airbnb and groomsmen suite (which was a lot of people - probably around 40 or so total). I also ordered some of the big cartons of Starbucks coffee.
   * $294.16 - Wedding Bands
      * We found an awesome wholesale jeweler in Tustin and we found our wedding bands there.  My husband got an awesome tungsten band that he fell in love with for only like $40.  I found a beautiful white gold, pave natural diamond band for roughly around $200 (like what?? how is it that cheap??).  All in with extra fees for resizing and tax, it came out to amount above.
   * $107.50 - Marriage License
   * $130 - Wedding Insurance
   * $120 - Premarital counseling
      * We did 4 session that were $30 each. Thankfully this was super cheap because of my husband's insurance.

Wow, if you made it this far, congrats! I think that is everything! Hope this is helpful for all of you future brides. If you have more questions, I'm happy to answer them.",1,1737878988.0,weddingplanning,0,1.0,False
1ia95jm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1ia95jm/am_i_right_in_asking_girls_parents_to_meet_the/,Am I right in asking girl's parents to meet the girl first,"So I(27M) create a profile on jeevansathi to finally explore the last option too. So there was this profile managed by parents(without any photos). Her profession and place were fine by me. We matched they asked where do I work, to which I replied. Next thing they asked for my parents's contact to proceed to which I said I'd like to meet her before(I don't know how it works and I was taking a dating approach I guess). And they asked meet as in? Then I replied 'meet as in get to know her over a coffee, what she is looking for, her preferences'. We both are in blr according to the profile.


I want to know if this was wrong and how to navigate this if parents are on the other side. Another thought I'm having is if a girl said this it would have been fine saying this as a guy makes me a creep?


Also I didn't want to involve parents because they won't have much say in it they'll ask me to decide so before knowing her. Also if the girl's parents tell them that they found me online my parents will keep asking for updates about new matches.


P.S - I had the last hoped on AM platforms which after using these I found it same as people looking for options(with very little seriuosness) without efforts(because no efforts in communication), good that I explored them early need to find a new way.",2,1737878890.0,Arrangedmarriage,0,1.0,False

1ia8n4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/TBI/comments/1ia8n4x/tbi_pressure_headaches_and_coffee/,TBI Pressure Headaches and Coffee,"Hi! I’m 4.5 years post traumatic brain injury. I was hit by a car doing 60mph while I was in the crosswalk (cycling not in another car). I was in a coma for a week and hospital for over a month. I have seen multiple neurologists and neuro ophthalmologists. 

I had a second incident 2.5 years ago while cycling (I no longer ride) where I was hit again, and my shoulder and head - where I had hit previously took all the impact. 
The second time was so much worse. I had seen a neurologist for the first year. He prescribed topiramate for the first 6 months which helped a lot. I cannot recall why he had wanted me to stop it. But he had told me that the first was an open head injury which is better since it alleviates the pressure. The second was a closed head injury so the pressure remains trapped. 

I have constantly woken up with pressure headaches since, and it is worse with the barometric pressure changes. I had done a year of neuro ophthalmology therapy, which actually helped me a lot, but the headaches still frequent me. I usually only get them in the morning when I wake up. I have special glasses to wear while working on the computer that helps but doesn’t fully resolve the issue for long days. They are not as debilitating as the first year or two post second accident, but I do need to have at least one coffee to start to function and alleviate the pressure headaches. 

I feel dependent on the coffee and am curious if anyone else has had a similar experience and has replaced coffee with something else? Vitamins? Juice? I’m not sure if drinking this much coffee is going to present negative effects, especially with the nervous system and jitters. 

I have been cleared from the neurologist and prefer not taking medications. I have also been cleared from the neuro ophthalmologist. So I’m not seeking medical advice. I’m just looking for possibly healthier alternatives to dealing with the pressure headaches. Or curious if anyone has any advice/ input. I would like to not rely on coffee to function and be able to think clearly and to reduce the pressure headaches in the morning. ",1,1737876614.0,TBI,0,1.0,False

1ia8it3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BookPromotion/comments/1ia8it3/reborn_to_love/,Reborn To Love,"Story Description:
Haunted by vivid dreams of a tragic love story set centuries ago, journalist Livia Harper feels an unshakable connection to a man she’s never met—until she encounters Ethan Ward, a reserved historian who seems eerily familiar. Drawn together by fate, their undeniable chemistry stirs memories of a love long lost to time.

When Livia turns to past-life regression therapy, she uncovers a shocking truth: she was Isabelle D’Armont, a noblewoman torn between duty and love during the tumultuous French Revolution. Her soulmate, Sebastian Devereaux, was a revolutionary leader whose life ended in betrayal and heartbreak. Now, in the present, echoes of their past reemerge, threatening to repeat the same tragedy.

As Livia and Ethan delve deeper into her memories, they uncover a centuries-old secret that ties their souls together—and a modern rival determined to tear them apart. With time running out, Livia must confront her past, embrace her present, and fight for the second chance at love she’s been given.

Can love truly transcend lifetimes, or will history repeat itself?

Reborn to Love is a heart-stirring tale of reincarnation, romance, and redemption that spans centuries, blending the beauty of timeless love with the thrill of unraveling hidden truths.

Chapter 1: Dreams of the Past

The cobblestones beneath my feet were slick with rain, each step a frantic echo in the labyrinth of dark alleys. The night reeked of smoke and fear, the distant screams of revolution closing in.

“Isabelle!” His voice—deep, desperate—cut through the chaos, pulling me back.

I spun around, my breath hitching. There he was. Sebastian Devereaux. His face was shadowed but unmistakable, etched with determination. I ran toward him, my hand outstretched. Just as our fingers brushed, a sharp, searing pain bloomed in my chest.

I gasped.

The world blurred, his shout becoming a distant roar.

When I woke, my heart was pounding, and my shirt clung to my sweat-soaked skin. I clutched my chest, the phantom ache still fresh as if I’d truly been pierced by some invisible blade.

That dream again.

For weeks, it had haunted me—Sebastian, the chase, and that terrible, final moment. I didn’t know who he was or why I kept seeing him. All I knew was that it felt too vivid to be just a dream.

My phone buzzed on the nightstand, its sharp vibration shattering the eerie stillness. I groaned, swiping at the screen.

“Where’s the article? Deadline’s today!”

Nothing like my boss’s texts to remind me that my life wasn’t a historical drama—it was a treadmill of deadlines and mediocre coffee.

“Great,” I muttered, tossing the phone aside.

I spent the morning staring blankly at my laptop, trying to summon the energy to finish my article. But the dream lingered like an itch I couldn’t scratch. By lunchtime, I gave up. The moment I stepped outside, a poster caught my eye:

“Revolution and Love: France’s Forgotten Heroes.”

The title sent a shiver down my spine. Before I knew it, my feet were carrying me through the museum doors.

The exhibit was quiet, save for the hushed voices of a few visitors. I wandered aimlessly until a painting stopped me cold.

It was him.

Sebastian.

The man from my dreams stood tall in the artwork, defiant, as though daring anyone to look away. A noose hung ominously behind him.

I couldn’t breathe.

“You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

The voice startled me, and I turned quickly. My breath caught again.

Standing there was the living, breathing version of the man in the painting—Sebastian. Or at least, someone who looked exactly like him. His sharp jawline, piercing eyes, everything matched. But this man wasn’t wearing the threadbare clothes of a revolutionary. He was in a tailored suit, holding a leather-bound notebook.

“I… I’m sorry,” I stammered.

“Don’t be,” he said, his voice warm, calm. “Ethan Ward.” He extended a hand, and I stared at it for a beat too long before shaking it.

“Livia Harper,” I managed.

“You’re a journalist?” He gestured at the badge hanging from my neck.

“Yeah. You’re a historian?”

“Guilty.” His eyes flicked toward the painting. “This exhibit is my pet project, actually. The Revolution fascinates me.”

I opened my mouth to say something—anything—but nothing came. My heart hammered in my chest, my mind racing with questions I couldn’t ask. Why did he look so much like Sebastian? Why did I feel like I’d known him forever?

Ethan raised an eyebrow, his lips curving into a faint smile. “Are you alright?”

“I—yeah. Fine,” I lied, my hands trembling.

But I wasn’t fine.

Not when his face was the same one I’d been dreaming of for weeks.

And definitely not when my dreams always ended in blood.

1ia8hs1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BollyGlamandRP/comments/1ia8hs1/f4m_bollywood_fanfiction/,[F4M] Bollywood Fan-Fiction,"I love doing erotic fan-fiction especially within Bollywood films . This can be any TV show or movie.

For example, imagine doing a cheating roleplay with characters from Khabhi Khushi Khabhi Gham. The slutty Pooh (Kareena Kapoor) constantly pushing her limits, always small satin robes or sheer robes and nothing else, the ends of the robe stopping at her mid-thigh, the loosely tied belt the only thing protecting her from flashing. Even though her exposed waist and cleavage told a story of their own, her nipples barely hidden and did slip out every few seconds.

Or Andhadhun, When Simi had to test if Akash was really blind she came to his house to investigate and while he was making coffee, she pulled out her massive breasts in the kitchen to see what visible reaction he would have or maybe down in his pants?

or how about a in-universe sequel to Humraaz?

Following the steps of other successful choreographers before him (Farah Khan, Prabhu Deva, Ganesh Acharya, etc) - now Omi has plans to turn into a director and take the responsibility for an entire film.

Raj Singhania (41) has occasionally financed a few films done by his friends. So he is known in the producers-directors circle. One of Omi’s acquaintances helps in setting up a meeting between Omi and Raj. The men meet.

Omi tells Raj, that he wants to make a movie about a married woman, without her knowledge. The woman will be someone who has a dancing background, but has been away from the dancing world for years. Raj is intrigued by the idea, and decides to fund this movie. And asks him, whom Omi wanna cast in the movie.

Omi drops a bomb, and shows Raj a short film. It’s shot with hidden camera, and features Priya (36) - Raj’s wife. It’s a film where Priya is dancing in a wedding baraat, and bumps into Omi. The two dance happily. Raj is pretty impressed with the way, Omi has used the camera, edit and music. And also, he likes the idea of his wife returning to something dance/entertainment related field. He gives green signal.

Omi and his brother Karan had a ten year age gap, so after their parents death - Karan had practically been like a parent to him. Omi as a ten year old, was pretty fond of Priya (who back then, was his Bhaiya’s girlfriend). Omi used to constantly day dream about living a perfect life with Karan and Priya. Until one day - everything was over!

As he grew up in this harsh world, he found what had happened to his brother. And how Priya was now living a luxurious life. He would often feel his brother inside his mind, and would want to take Priya for himself. In his head, that would unite Priya and Karan. He started learning to dance, his brother’s old videos and memories helped him a lot. And the hatred for Priya and Raj just fuelled his passion.

Meanwhile Raj Singhania is going through a crisis. He has been not able to get his rod hard for any woman since years now. He loves his wife truly, and he knows that she loves him too. But the lack of sex is eating him up. There was no excitement or color in his life. Until Omi walked into his office with that short film…

When Raj saw Omi (a young guy) dancing with his wife. He felt a current flowing through his body. He felt hard for the first time in years. He saw how Omi’s hands had brushed against the naked skin of Priya’s back and waist. How her giant melons had crushed on Omi’s chest a couple of times. He wanted more…

i'll preface this with the fact that i am emotionally unstable, i am aware of this. and to be frank, i've ALWAYS been like this.
my first crush on a teacher was in fifth grade. it was, odd, telling my best friend that i found our 45 year old teacher cute and not the boy that ran 76 laps in pacer.
i'm a sophomore in the US, and there's this one teacher who teaches a math class, as a freshman everyone i knew prayed they would get him. from what i heard, he was very calm and understanding. honestly, i thought they were exaggerating. but whoa, i was blessed by the counselors and he was my math teacher for the year! i was head over heels the first time i laid eyes on him, honestly.
it doesn't help that he is the epitome of
EVERYTHING i find attractive in a man. (that sounds weird, sorry!) i chose my seat, right next to his desk. i have no friends in this class, so im pretty focused. my grades are good and i actively do extra credit, even though i don't need it. the extra credit is harder than the normal work, obviously, and ; tell he truly enjoys teaching people about it.
the period im in is relatively tame, but no one's as interested in what he has to say as me.
it doesn't help that im a massive autist with a disgusting amount of anxiety. whenever i speak to him, i cannot make eye contact, this results in my eyes resting at his crotch, i then immediately look away and burn holes in the floor.
my schedule was eventually messed up, and i had to switch out of his class. at the news, i broke down. one else was in the class and i just silently sobbed to be honest, but being next to his desk wasn't the best, he saw and got up, stood in front of the desk and kinda just looked at me.
he's an awkward person, which is one thing i like about him, he understands where i come from.
he asked if i was okay, i honestly don't remember what else he said. i said, yes, then no. i told him i was honestly in shambles and couldn't handle this change. he said he understood and would try to place me back in his class.
my best friend walked by and saw this, and came in. honestly im so happy she did that. i was in such a odd and desperate place at the time (and the current moment didn't help) i knew that my next action would be to hug him.
lots of stuff happens, and he manages to get me back into his class.
honesty, I'm so grateful. even if i didn't find him attractive, he's already such a good teacher- 'a great person (to my knowledge and researc. V is also very similar to me aesthetically.
¡ hope he isn't active on here, because he's pretty young. and if he finds out i feel this way to him, i am willing to transfer schools or commit myself to a psychiatric hospital, no joke.
i'm posting here to ask a few things.
can teachers tell if a student likes them? i like to think I'm not obvious, but i don't know. it's gotten so bad, talking to him makes my heart rate sky rocket. i cannot ask him a question without shaking but also simultaneously wanting to move closer and smell his coffee breath. i wish God would strike me down.
when i graduate, would it be a dumb idea to tell him? i know he didn't get into teaching to be the victim of my instability and desperation for any crumb of male attention.
should i transfer out? i don't know why I'm asking this, my friends have all said to do it. but he's genuinely such a good teacher, math is so easy with him and i hate myself for feeling this way towards him.
feel free to chastise me, i so badly deserve it. please help me, teachers of reddit. it's getting unbearable to walk in there everyday and act like i don't think this man is my soulmate. anyone who can make math understandable is hard not to love.

last minute addition, i recently had a very vivid wet adjacent dream. i couldn't bring myself to even look at him for the entire week. the dream wasn't anything bad, in it, my parents became tired of my crap and institutionalized me after a suicide attempt. he was a psychiatric nurse and locked me in a room for exactly 28 days. he'd check on me through a door, i was being kept in a solitarily confinement room, and leave me food. he'd say things like 'i don't want to do this, i have to. to be honest, i was projecting my fantasies onto this vessel who took his form.

i'm getting tired of it. i tried to crush on a boy my age, but it just doesn't work. and even if it did work, im too pathetic to talk to him, so it's just like the situation im currently in. but the pure power of my feelings towards him dominate everything else in my mind.

i feel like im going insane. i’m so disgusted with myself, for this and a multitude of other reasons (attraction related issues) 

let me add, i was never sexually assaulted, molested, or anything of the sorts. i have no trauma. no, im not exaggerating. my childhood was honestly great. i receive more than enough attention from my parents, and my father and i's relationship is great.

I am trying to find ways to cope with the hunger that comes with eating less, but the thing I'm having more trouble with is the brain fog and low energy. By the mid afternoon on any given workday my focus becomes nonexistent, it takes so much more mental effort and time to complete tasks, and I get tired and groggy and zoned out. It has the unfortunate side effect of making me unlikely to work out in the afternoon which would improve my results. Sometimes I end up thinking about food and spending too much time thinking about my next meal. None of these things happen when I eat a ""normal"" amount of food that focuses on me being satiated, which must be overeating actually since it's how I got fat in the first place.

**EGO ZAYIN ""Soda""**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

EGO Soda will be relatively easy to access for players early in the game. Rumor has it that there is a special Wellcheers that you can drink... no, that's nonsense (please drink all the Wellcheers you can find, it's safe and healthy)  
  
This EGO includes 4 stages, just like the EGO 9:2 of the Prophet of Skin  
Each stage will be significantly more powerful than the previous one, and moving to the next stage will require... a special taste  
  
**EGO Features:**  
*-Style!*  
\-Shrimp smell! (Which, by the way, will prevent zombies from smelling you)  
\-Improved throwing and dodging skills, as well as increased resistance to being knocked down  
\-Access to the net summoning! It's up to you to catch shrimp, fish or zombies  
\-And the ability to summon special, exploding Wellcheers >!(Damn, we added the ability to spam explosive soda. I'm sure players won't abuse it, but still...)!<  
  
And all these features will increase with your EGO rank!

  
You might hear a voice in your head and think that you've had enough Wellcheers. But wait! That's how it should be

**Talking EGO!**

  
Any experienced researcher (if you are not an experienced researcher, take notes) knows that the EGO actually has its own will. And there are enough documented cases of agents hearing voices belonging to their EGO, it had an effect on them, their behavior. Mirror world of CDDA is a strange case, but recently agents working there began to report similar cases, which means...



**Replies from EGOs have been added when using them!**

At the moment this applies to 9:2 and Soda. In the future, it will probably be applied to all EGOs. There are also plans to expand the functionality of this feature.

Our huge balance department was too emotional during the review of the last patch. so much so that now **the emotion system has appeared in the mod!** Similar to how it was in Library of Ruina, in order to use EGO you need strong emotions for this. But don't worry! Your character will now react to the world, and in that world there are enough things that cause emotions

So the EGO is fed with emotions, the survivor must remember to feed himself  
Well, just for such an occasion we decided to open a restaurant

**Welcome to HamHamPangPang!**

[It's bigger than it appears on the screen!](https://preview.redd.it/6z2vjxe0bafe1.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9a7b19077088e95ff77fa0caa75c038bec641ca)

And before you start looking for a rank 9 fixer, let me tell you **what awaits you inside.**

\-In the restaurant itself you can meet fixers and... cooks known to you (well, maybe not to everyone)

\-They have their own quest chains! And, of course, rewards

\-The restaurant is quite safe, you can stop there, rest and spend time

\-There is food for sale! (well, as expected from a restaurant)

\-But there is unique food there! These dishes are more expensive than usual, but their specialty is that they are very filling and give long-term buffs (up to an hour) depending on the type of dish

\-There are also three drinks added that represent members of our team, I hope you will like them!

Time flies over a cup of coffee and cake, of course. Maybe you'll get lazy over time, who knows. Hide away at home under a blanket, reading a book...

But one day your peace will be interrupted by the sounds of grinding metal and the glow of red optics in the dark.

For personal development, we all need... *ordeals*



**We present you Green Dawn!**

[Me and boys at 3PM](https://preview.redd.it/fgtxfiwndafe1.png?width=635&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bf84007fbc1fb0e613df7315d7264c9878e9113)

In general, I think many will agree that the game over time becomes... quite static. And we have brought you changes!



After some time after the start of the game, there is a chance of Green Dawn appearing, they will try to kill you and are generally hardy and dangerous enemies. In the screenshot above you can see their appearance, as well as!

From them it is possible to craft a set of armor and weapons, which you also see on the screenshot



This equipment has excellent characteristics, of the minuses that it is not very convenient and somewhat constrains the player.

The ordeals themselves will become more and more dangerous over time

In the future, it is also planned to add other types of ordeals!



Oh, and

Do not fall near these creatures, they will definitely take advantage of this

1ia8cj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tonsillectomy/comments/1ia8cj1/tonsillectomy_24th_jan_my_journey_to_recovery_day/,Tonsillectomy 24th Jan - my Journey to recovery (Day 2),"
I had a tonsillectomy Friday 24th Jan at 8.30am and wanted to document my experience for anyone worried about having the surgery done.

For reference, I'm in the UK, I'm a dude and had my operation done at the Bath Clinic. It was paid for by my work insurance due to it being classed as chronic tonsillitis.

This is my day 2 Summary - take a look at day 1 by looking at my profile. So here we go...

The Pain

The Pain is ramping up and getting worse. Chewing gum REALLY does help with the pain but yeah, it's getting worse. What really bothers me is the fact that as I'm chewing, I'm hearing clicking in my right ear from the new ""cavity"" that exists in my mouth. It doesn't hurt - it feels like I expect it to be there after the removal of my old tonsil stoney friends - so I'm just dealing with it. 

I would say the hardest part of the day is taking meds after waking up from the (shite) sleep I have. Saw someone else call it L sleeping - yup. Honestly though - I never knew I could sleep like this so I'm pleasantly impressed with myself. Because I can't chew while I'm sleeping, the muscle begins to seize at night - so taking the pills first thing is hell on earth. I think what I'll try tomorrow is waking up a little earlier when I know the pain relief is still working, chew for an hour and then take the meds - gut is telling me it'll help massively. 

I did make a mistake while sleeping and it made my morning hard. I mentioned in my last post I mouth tape. The mouth taping makes my nights easier. Unfortunately, mid way through the night I thought I'd be clever and allow my mouth to breathe a little.....and then preceded to drift off....L shaped....head draped down. I only woke up because my mouth was just producing a continuous flow of spit which caused my throat to dry out. Lesson learned - keep the bloody mouth tape on. 

FOOD AND DRINK

I'm still eating and drinking. My diet consists of 2 jacket (baked) potatoes, cheese and tuna. Where's the veg? That shit stings so I'm leaving it out for 2 weeks. Last thing I want is a spinach leaf sitting on my cave holes so I'm dealing with it. 

I don't actually eat baked potatoes - but for some reason now I do. The cravings are so strong for potato and I have no idea why. 

It's just a great meal though - you get the scratchy skin (that you want), the soothing inner (that you want), the fatty soothing cheese (oh yeah) and the Tuna. The Tuna is a cesspit of fire that causes pain. But it's high in protein and teaches me about resilience and I just drink water with it. 

Speaking of water - I'm finding normal water more painful to drink that sparkling water. So im drinking only sparkling water (apart from medicine taking)


EXERCISE

I was told not to exercise until Day 4. I was also told to avoid crowds for 2 weeks as I'll be at high risk of infection after the surgery. So with that in mind, as I wanted some fresh air, I walked (very slowly) with my girlfriend to a big supermarket and then sat in a corner not near anyone waiting for her to come out so we could (very slowly) walk back. 

I get why my ENT said don't exercise. It's a tad cold atm and so when walking I had a minor slide (not slip) on some ice which led to me tensing. That tensing pain hurt like hell and knackered me out. 

Moral of the story - BE VERY CAREFUL

I don't regret the walk at all - I'll be doing it today. Fresh air feels like it helps. And even if it doesn't, that ""feeling"" like it helps is having a major impact on my mental health and attitude to this recovery. 

GOALS FOR TODAY

Drink lots of tea. 

Go to the bathroom (yeah....i haven't yet....you know....gonna have a coffee and see)

Get another KFC (just cravings. I never have it. Get off my case. I'm recovering)

Chew. Chew. Chew. All. Day

Replay Last of Us Part 1 (the game obviously) 


FINAL COMMENT

Sorry for the long one guys. I read that Reddit is the platform where you write out your ""stream of consciousness to an unknown audience of avatars"" and tbh it's true. 

It's just when you're in recovery from this, the only thing you can do is talk to yourself and so I hope my externalising is just helping someone get distracted for 5 minutes so they're closer to being healed. 

Also, it's a shit recovery. But it's not just shit. So where I'm in pain and I find a solution that works for me, I'll shout so you can give it a go if you're feeling low. We're in this together guys.

1ia87t4,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiveparents/comments/1ia87t4/bottled_up_things_that_i_would_like_to_share/,Bottled up things that I would like to share anonymously since it’s becoming extremely annoying at this point. This is my story..,"I have a very greedy father, he’s been abusive towards my mother for years (I’ve witnessed domestic violence when I was a kid). I found out as an adult now that he had never bought my mom a ring once ever since he got married to my mom in his home country. In the UK, their marriage papers aren’t accepted in the country so that’s at least a good thing it’ll show he doesn’t have that much rights over her in a way. Adding onto that he’s been absent in my life ever since my mom won custody of me in 2011. He was only allowed to see me & my sibling once a week but then fast forward to 2022 everything changed, my father decided to move in front of my home in an apartment that’s close to the house.

I’ve noticed some changes whenever he visits our home, some stuff in the house were missing. My father has a history of stealing & I had high intuitive suspicion that some of my mother’s item were stolen by him & given to another woman that we have no knowledge of. He also has a history of going out with different women especially having very dodgy friends that didn’t seem right to me, knowing he once left me alone with his weird friend at a coffee shop & this friend of his was being oddly touchy towards me. I remember telling him about that at age 16, his response was not a surprise to me: “you are a liar, just like your mom. All women lie.” Hang up the phone on me.
Fast forward he became more n’ more abusive towards my mother today ever since he moved close to us, every time he makes a phone call to my mother just to insult her or accuse her of something that she has no knowledge of. He manipulated my sibling to stay at his place since 2022 already & my sibling became extremely violent, much more dangerous towards me & my mother. (they’re autistic with adhd). My father also has a huge issue with his jealousy, you cannot be successful, happy or even excited around him. He will tear your happiness & success down because he would want what you achieved. Always talks about himself, you cannot talk about anything else it’s always have to be him, his problems with people (yeahhh I wonder whyyy hmmm so obvious) & ofc money. He talks about money all the time as he keeps calculating whatever he spends & would blame it on my mother if he spent too much on smth even on smth that isn’t even expensive at all. 

Deep down in this rabbit hole: my mother has been in debt for a very long time, she’s trying her best to pay whatever she has & it’s not a lot that she has to cover up her debts. Whilst my father.. has a secret whilst pretending to be poor & screams at my mother for the way he lives: he has money.. a lot of money, he didn’t wanna say anything. The house is under my mom’s name and his name but the thing is my mom has been paying the house whilst my father never payed anything, not once at all. He left my mother to suffer with the bills & ran away from time to time from the bills that the house kept receiving as the interest rate has increasing (he knows that). 
Now we want to sell the house & he wants the half… HALF? HALF FOR FUCKING WHAT? YOU DIDNT PAY THE HOUSE EVER SINCE IT WAS BOUGHT BACK IN 2007 MY MOM WAS SCARED SHITLESS PREGNANT WITH MY SIBLING WHEN YOU WERE INVITING VERY WEIRD DODGY FELLAS INTO THE HOUSE WHERE THERE WERE KIDS AT PRESENT JUST TO PARTY & DRINK WITH THEM. Fuck me sideways to the realms above this hell on earth.

So now, me and my mom barely have support, this “man” is not a man at all, he never supported me nor my mother. It’s always him & his envy that’s ruining what we want the best for us & what we want to fight for. He has a big mouth so we cannot tell him anything knowing he can be violent as well so me and my mother always have to stay silent, cautious. We can’t afford a lawyer or for the court itself for him to stay away from our lives as he has been very sneaky with his crimes: stealing, stalking & violence. Yes you heard that correctly.. stalking as well, he would know where my mom goes since he was going to his car & following her. And he would get extremely aggressive when he sees her talking to someone he doesn’t know such as my mom’s long distance friend she bumped into from time to time in town or whoever she known for years. He’d call her phone & threaten her about talking to other people, my mom lost friends because of him. 

I even suspected he’s a mentally ill person due to how he was talking & acting: his behaviour is absolutely fucking odd you have no idea, he would twist words into smth else that doesn’t make any sense whenever he wants to blame someone around him for the mistakes he caused. I just wished he’d disappear, I wish me and my mother could just pack up & leave easily but we can’t due to having an autistic sibling of mine that needs immediate help so my mother is trying her best to look for residential or anything but our council in this town is extremely shitty so we are pushing for an alert help. We do need a lawyer at some point but again we can’t afford it. Other advices I’ve heard were not helpful.",3,1737874808.0,abusiveparents,0,1.0,False

The cafe’s bell jingled as Beau pushed open the door, a wave of warm air brushing over him. He spotted Sierra immediately—polished and poised as ever, sitting in her usual seat by the window. Her sleek black hair gleamed under the soft light, and her phone rested beside a half-empty latte. She looked like she always did: flawless, as if she belonged on the cover of a magazine.

For a moment, Beau paused, his hand lingering on the door frame. The sight of Sierra, perfectly composed and scrolling through her phone, sent a flicker of unease through him. It wasn’t anything specific, just a quiet, nagging tension that had become all too familiar. He shifted the strap of his bag on his shoulder, forcing himself forward.

She glanced up and smiled, her teeth bright against her lipstick. “Morning, handsome!”

“Morning,” he replied, sliding into the seat across from her.

“I went ahead and ordered for you. Same as always.” She gestured toward the counter, where a barista was placing a cup on a tray.

“Thanks,” he said. He appreciated the gesture—or at least, he wanted to. Instead, it felt like one more reminder of how Sierra always seemed to know what he needed better than he did.

She tucked her phone into her bag and leaned forward slightly, resting her elbows on the table. Her eyes sparkled with purpose, and Beau braced himself.

“So,” she started, her voice bright but laced with intent, “I talked to my father last night.”

His stomach tightened. That tone meant trouble. “Oh?”

“He knows someone at Bluewater Insurance. They’re hiring, and he thinks you’d be a great fit. He said if you send over your resume, he’ll make sure it gets into the right hands.”

Beau frowned, his jaw tightening. “Insurance?”

“It’s stable,” she said, as though that settled the matter. “It’s not exactly glamorous, but it’s steady, and the pay’s decent. You could finally move out of that tiny apartment and get something closer to me.”

Of course, that was the real point. Beau forced a polite smile, but his stomach churned. He couldn’t think of anything worse than sitting at a desk in some beige office building, selling policies he didn’t care about. But it wasn’t just the job—it was the thought of living closer to Sierra, of letting their lives intertwine in the way she so clearly wanted. The weight on his chest grew heavier.

“I like my apartment,” he said finally, though even to his own ears, it sounded like an excuse.

“Beau,” Sierra said, her voice softening in the way it always did when she was about to press harder, “you know it’s not enough. You’re wasting so much potential. And honestly, you’ve got that old house you inherited just sitting there, doing nothing. If you sold it, you’d have enough to get a decent place near me.”

Of course. The house. She always found a way to bring it up, like a splinter she couldn’t stop picking at. Beau exhaled sharply through his nose, the irritation resurfacing in his chest.

His gaze dropped to the swirling coffee in his mug. The house in Stonehaven was a knot he couldn’t untangle, a mix of guilt, grief, and memories he wasn’t ready to face. Every time someone brought it up, it felt like a trap.

“Sierra…” His voice was low, a warning.

But she pressed on. “Be honest,” she said, leaning forward slightly. “What’s the point of holding onto it? It’s been sitting there for two years. No one’s touched it. It’s just costing you money in taxes and upkeep. You could sell it and finally move on with your life.”

Move on. The words stung in a way he couldn’t explain. He hadn’t been back to Stonehaven since before his grandfather’s passing, and he knew that  he never wanted. The house wasn’t just some old property to him—it was tied to those last two summers spent before college, to Isla, to the life he’d lost in one horrible moment. But explaining that to Sierra felt impossible. She wouldn’t understand.

“It’s not that simple,” Beau said, his tone sharper than he intended.

“Why not?” Sierra pressed, her eyes narrowing. “It’s not like it’s some family home you grew up in. You’ve barely even been there, right? What’s holding you back?”

What wasn’t holding him back? Beau swallowed hard, trying to push down the wave of frustration rising in his chest. He could feel her words closing in around him, like a net tightening with every question she asked.

“I’ll deal with it when I’m ready,” he said finally, though even he wasn’t sure what that meant.

Sierra sighed, leaning back and crossing her arms. “You’ve been saying that since I met you, Beau. And let’s be real—you’re never going to be ready. At some point, you have to stop running and actually deal with your life.”

Her words cut deep, sharper than he expected. Running. She wasn’t wrong, but hearing it out loud made him feel like the floor beneath him had given way.

Beau stared at his mug, the swirl of coffee chaotic and relentless, like his own thoughts. She didn’t get it. She never had. Every conversation with her felt like a slow push toward a future he didn’t want—a life filled with shared calendars, compromises, and expectations he couldn’t meet. The truth settled heavily in his chest: he didn’t want the life she was trying to build with him.

Hell, he didn’t want to share a life with anyone. He could barely manage his own without someone trying to wedge their way into every corner of it. The thought snapped into place with startling clarity, sharp and unforgiving.

“I think we both know this isn’t working,” he said, his voice quiet but resolute.

Sierra blinked, caught off guard. “What?”

“I can’t do this anymore,” Beau said, finally meeting her gaze. “This… us… it’s too much. I feel like I’m suffocating.”

Her expression hardened, her hands gripping the edges of the table. “Unbelievable,” she said, her voice icy. “You’re blaming me for this? For trying to help you?”

“I’m not blaming anyone,” Beau said, standing. “But I can’t keep pretending like this is what I want.”

“Fine,” she said sharply, her voice rising. “Go ahead. Run away. That’s what you do, isn’t it?”

Beau pulled a few bills from his wallet and set them on the table. He paused, looking at her one last time, but the words he wanted to say wouldn’t come. Instead, he turned and walked toward the door.

As he stepped outside, the cold air hit him like a slap, sharp and biting against his skin. He drew in a deep breath, his lungs burning, but for the first time in months, the weight in his chest began to ease.
The door clicked shut behind him, and Beau let out a slow breath, shrugging off his coat and tossing it onto the back of a chair. The quiet of his apartment wasn’t comforting, exactly, but it felt steady—unchanging. He kicked off his shoes, leaving them where they landed, and sank into the chair at his desk.

The breakup with Sierra barely registered anymore. It had been coming for weeks, months even, and now that it was over, the only thing he felt was relief. His chest felt lighter without the constant push and pull of her expectations.

Beau opened his laptop, the glow of the screen highlighting the mess on his desk—a stack of unopened mail, an empty coffee mug, and a tangle of charging cables. His email inbox blinked to life, the usual flood of junk cluttering the screen. He was halfway through deleting messages when a subject line stopped him:

Subject: EchoWave Technologies – Job Offer

He sat up straighter, his eyes narrowing as he clicked it open.

We are pleased to inform you that after our discussions, we’d like to offer you the position of Senior Business Consultant at EchoWave Technologies. Your experience aligns perfectly with our needs, and we’re excited about the possibility of you joining our team.
For a moment, he just stared at the screen. The salary was there, big and promising, dangling a future in front of him like a carrot. This was it—the opportunity he’d been waiting for. The kind of job that could actually get him somewhere.

But the excitement fizzled out as reality set in.

The cost of moving to L.A. alone made his chest tighten. Deposits, rent, transportation—it all added up fast, and he didn’t have the savings to cover it. Even with the promise of a bigger paycheck, the gap between now and “settled” felt impossibly wide.

His gaze drifted to the corner of the room, to the stack of boxes from Stonehaven. His grandfather’s house. It was just sitting there, empty, racking up taxes and quietly bleeding him dry.

And just like that, the thought crept in, unwelcome and sharp: Sierra was right.
Beau sat back in his chair, exhaling through clenched teeth. The idea of selling the house had always felt abstract, something to deal with “someday.” But now? Now it felt more like a threat. He’d have to go back—to Stonehaven, to the house, to everything he’d been avoiding since the day he left.

His mind skated dangerously close to the memories he tried to keep buried: the accident, the life he’d been running from ever since. Stonehaven wasn’t just a place; it was a weight he wasn’t sure he could carry.

He pushed the laptop away, his hands balling into fists. Selling the house would mean facing all of it—Isla, the life they should have shared, the way everything fell apart. And to make it worse, Sierra’s voice echoed in his head, smug and unrelenting: You could sell it and finally move on with your life.

“Damn it,” he muttered, dragging a hand over his face.

The thought sat there, persistent and irritating, like a splinter he couldn’t ignore. He hated that she was right. He hated the house. He hated the memories. But most of all, he hated the idea that Stonehaven might be the only way forward.
Beau let out a long, frustrated breath and leaned back in his chair. The email glowed faintly on the laptop screen, the promise of a new future spelled out in neat, sterile lines. It should have felt like an escape, but between here and there stood Stonehaven—and that was a road he couldn’t bring himself to take.

He glanced at the clock. Barely noon. Too early to feel this drained, yet his body felt heavy, weighed down by problems he didn’t know how to solve.

With a frustrated sigh, he shut the laptop and pushed away from the desk. The quiet of the apartment pressed in on him, suffocating and still. Giving in to the exhaustion pulling at him, he made his way to the bed, flicking off the lights and collapsing onto the mattress.

The ceiling loomed above him, sunlight streaming in through the window and cutting across the room in harsh, unwelcome beams. He groaned, turning onto his side and pulling a pillow over his head, desperate to block out the light—and the decisions he didnt want to make. Sleep, he thought. Just sleep.

Chapter 2
The road stretched ahead, endless and slick, a pale ribbon of ice glowing faintly under the cold, indifferent light of the moon. Beau’s hands clamped the steering wheel, his knuckles bone-white, the tension crawling up his arms and into his chest. The heater sputtered, blowing weak, lukewarm air, but the inside of the car felt suffocatingly cold.

“You’re always like this, Beau!” Isla’s voice cut through the thick silence, sharp and brittle, vibrating in the small space. “Waiting until the last second, like things will just fix themselves!”

“Just stop!” he snapped, his voice rising, the words spilling out before he could stop them.

The air shifted instantly, heavy and brittle. His stomach twisted as he glanced at her—just a flick of his eyes, brief but enough to see her face. Isla sat stiffly, her profile half-illuminated by the dim dashboard light. Her jaw was tight, her lips pressed into a thin line. Her hand rested on her lap, fingers curled slightly, her engagement ring catching the glow in a soft, fleeting shimmer.

Then it happened.

The tires hit ice.

The car jolted violently, a gut-wrenching lurch that sent Beau’s heart into his throat. The steering wheel jerked in his hands, twisting against him as the car began to slide.

Time fractured.

The world tilted, spinning wildly as the tires lost all grip. The grinding roar of rubber skidding on ice tore through the silence, louder than it should have been, drowning everything else out.

“Beau!” Isla’s scream shattered through the chaos, raw and panicked, echoing in his ears as the headlights of the oncoming car grew impossibly large.

Everything blurred together—the blinding glare of the headlights, the sickening weightlessness of the spin, the deafening screech of metal meeting metal. The impact slammed into them like a freight train, a bone-jarring crunch that reverberated through every nerve in his body.

Beau woke with a start, his breath tearing from his chest in shallow, frantic gasps. His heart slammed against his ribs, the rhythm wild and uneven, as if trying to break free. His skin was damp with sweat, the sheets twisted around him.

The room was still too bright. The sunlight poured through the window, casting sharp, unkind streaks across the walls. Beau closed his eyes, dragging in slow, measured breaths, but the memory clung to him, vivid and unrelenting.

The headlights. The ice. Isla’s voice, sharp with frustration. The sickening crunch of metal on metal.

She used to laugh so easily, he thought. He couldn’t remember the sound anymore—not the way it used to be, bright and carefree, bubbling out of her like sunlight on water. But in his dreams—his nightmares—it was her anger, her frustration, that always rang loud and clear.

The guilt weighed heavy in his chest, an ache that never quite left. It wasn’t just that he had been driving. It was that they had been fighting, stupidly, over nothing that mattered now. It was that he hadn’t seen the ice in time. It was that he had walked away from the wreck when she hadn’t.

How many times had he replayed the moment in his mind? Wondering if it could’ve gone differently, if there had been a single choice, a single second that might have changed everything? The thought haunted him, circling endlessly.

He pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes, willing the images to fade. It didn’t work. It never worked.

Beau swung his legs over the side of the bed, his feet hitting the floor with a dull thud. His hands trembled slightly as he pushed himself up and made his way to the kitchen. The hum of the fridge was the only sound in the too-quiet apartment. He grabbed a bottle of water, the cool condensation slick against his palm, and leaned heavily against the counter.

The same dream. The same memories. It always came back to that night.

The bottle felt cold in his hands, grounding him, but it wasn’t enough to shake the weight pressing down on him. His eyes drifted to the window, the city outside alive with movement—cars honking in the distance, muffled voices rising from the street below. It felt so far away, like it belonged to a world he didn’t quite live in anymore.

Turning away, Beau walked back to the small desk in the corner of the living room. His laptop was still open, the screen glowing faintly. He tapped the trackpad to wake it, the email staring back at him.

We’re excited to offer you the position…

The words blurred as he read them again. It was a chance—a fresh start, far away from the memories that clung to him no matter how hard he tried to shake them. But getting to L.A. was another story. The money in his bank account wouldn’t cover half of what he needed to relocate.

Sierra’s voice pushed its way back into his thoughts, insistent and nagging. “You should sell it, Beau. That house is just sitting there. It’s not like you’re ever going to use it.”

She wasn’t wrong, and that was what stung the most. Selling the house made sense. It was the quickest way to get the money he needed, to make the move, to take the job. But it wasn’t the house he dreaded—it was the memories waiting for him in Stonehaven. The place they had first met as teenagers. The place they had been together for the last time.

He thought of those two summers in Stonehaven, stuck at his grandfather’s house because his mom had been worried about him. She thought small-town life might straighten him out, keep him out of trouble long enough to make it to graduation. He had been so angry back then—angry at her, angry at the world, angry at being sent to that nowhere town where he didn’t know anyone and didn’t care to.

Except for Isla.

She had been the one bright spot in those long, tedious summers. The daughter of the nurse who came by a couple of times a week to check on his grandfather, Isla had shown up one day with her quick smile and curious eyes, asking him questions he hadn’t wanted to answer. But somehow, she’d gotten under his skin. Slowly, they’d gone from awkward small talk to spending entire days together. By the end of that first summer, they were inseparable.

They’d fallen hard, the kind of love that felt bigger than the both of them, like it could defy the world. When it came time to choose colleges, they had picked the same one in Chicago without hesitation. It hadn’t been easy—new city, new pressures—but they’d had each other.

And then winter break came. They’d gone back to Stonehaven to visit her family. He could still see her smile when they’d pulled into town, the way her eyes lit up excited to show her family her engagement ring.

But the memory always stopped there, hitting a wall he couldn’t get past without everything unraveling. The accident had erased all the good that came before it, leaving only fragments of what they had been. 

That town held pieces of his life that felt frozen in time, untouched by everything that had happened since. 

Still, he didn’t have a choice. The house wasn’t doing him any good sitting there, empty and rotting. It was just another piece of the past he couldn’t afford to hold onto.

His eyes dropped back to the email, the job offer staring back at him like a lifeline. If he sold the house, he could move forward. He could finally take the next step, leave everything that happened behind him, and focus on something—anything—that wasn’t tied to that night.

He pulled up a browser and typed: bus ticket to Stonehaven, Vermont.

The results loaded quickly, but he didn’t move for a moment, his hand hovering over the mouse. Selling the house was logical. Practical. It was just a house. But as he clicked to finalize the ticket, a knot of dread settled in his stomach.

It wasn’t the house he feared. It wasn’t even Stonehaven. It was himself—the memories he couldn’t escape and the guilt that followed him, relentless and unyielding.

He exhaled slowly, closing the laptop. This was the only way forward. He’d sell the house, take the job, and leave it all behind. One last trip to Stonehaven, and he’d finally be free.",0,1737874225.0,RomanceWriters,0,0.25,False

I wish *I* could 🥴 

I'm gonna try to keep this as succinct as possible. This all came to a head last weekend and I've been stewing since.

I (29F) have an older step-sister, 35F, ""Marley"". It's relevant to the issue that she and I have never had a good relationship. We are water and oil.

Marley has a 9 y/o daughter ""Kait"". They live in an apartment with Marley's BF ""Rick"" and their 2 pet cats. Well, now 1 pet cat.

Marley, Kait and Rick got an offer to go spend 4 days up at a friend's cabin & took the offer since neither had to work. They left their two cats in the care of their neighbor friend, who came to look after them every day. On the morning of the 3rd day, the friend called them bawling, saying that when she came in to give breakfast, the male kitty was laying on the floor, not alive.

As soon as they drove home they brought kitty's body to the vet and the vet determined that he'd died from the effects of paint toxicity. Apparently his paw pads were stained bright blue.

Marley admitted then that she'd spontaneously decided to paint Kait's bedroom floor the day before they left. And she ""was so distracted getting ready that she left the bedroom door open"". And the one cat went into Kait's room before the paint dried. The neighbor somehow failed to notice.

I'll be honest, I'm furious about how the cat died. And when she came to our parent's house with Kait last Saturday to eat brunch and cry about her beloved cat and his 'accident', I lost my cool and admittedly snapped at her, that if she loved the cat, she should've put in the effort not to kill him with neglect.

That went over very poorly at the table. Marley got really upset and started shouting at me that I didn't need to be a bitch, and that I essentially called her a murderer. My husband scoffed into his coffee and muttered 'well, if the shoe fits...'

10 minutes later, brunch was over, Marley and Kait were gone, and my parents were unimpressed with me. Later that day I got a long text from Marley. About how I should never have said that in front of Kait, that I expected too much from the people around me, that I wasn't perfect either and just because I hated her didn't mean I had to be a heartless bitch. I texted back 'Your neglectful behaviour killed your cat. He didn't have to die. And I refuse to tiptoe around it, for the sake of your shitty ego. Grow up.' Then I muted her number, and haven't looked at our messages since. On Sunday Rick texted me, telling me that it 'was a pretty shitty thing to do, especially with Kait there, and it seemed like I just wanted to feel superior to Marley, by rubbing her nose in her mistake.' Rick ain't shit, so I just blocked him without answering.

My husband and younger brother both think I did absolutely nothing wrong. My mom agrees with me but thinks it wasn't for child ears to hear, and my step-dad is mostly just unhappy that the family is fighting and asked me why I had to kick the nest so hard. Our parents said that I 'probably could've worded it more softly'. But I think the cat deserves to have the truth spoken, since he apparently had to die so unfairly. I love cats and recently lost mine to cancer, so this did piss me off *extra* bad when I heard what she did.

If I'm the asshole for what I said, I'm fine with being the asshole. But did I step over the line by saying it in front of Kait? It's the truth, but I do love my niece, and didn't mean to cause her extra pain.",3,1737873611.0,AITAH,15,1.0,False

1ia7v6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllivesSakuyaKaito/comments/1ia7v6h/tomoko_january_2025/,Tomoko January 2025,"I didn’t set an alarm today because work was suspended, but my body clock still betrayed me, pulling me from the comfort of sleep despite me having more time today to rest. There are still few sunlight filtering through the curtains that tells me it might still be just around 7 A.M. right now. I could feel its warmth but that warmth also made me want to burrow deeper into my blanket. My body still feels heavy and sluggish. My eyelids pleaded to close again.

I gave into my body and shut my eyes, trying to drift back to sleep. After a few minutes though, the familiar hum of Tomoko’s voice drifted into my ears, followed by the sound of my door creaking open. I ignored it, clinging desperately to the fragile remnants of my dream.

“Hey, Onii-chan,” her voice called softly, almost too sweetly. It was a singsong voice but dripped with mischief.

The bed dipped under her weight, and before I could register what was happening—thud.

“Rise and shine, sleepyhead!”

My eyes flew open as Tomoko plopped herself on top of me, straddling my waist. The world was a blur for a moment, but when my vision cleared, her grinning face hovered mere inches from mine. Her eyes sparkling with mischief.

She was wearing an oversized pastel sweater, the sleeves draping over her hands, paired with shorts that barely peeked out beneath the hem. Her hair was tied in a messy ponytail, a few strands falling over her forehead.

“What are you doing, Tomoko?” I muttered, my voice hoarse with sleep.

She smirked, leaning in closer, her weight pressing on me. “What? You weren’t waking up, so I had to take drastic measures. You’re lucky I didn’t dump water on you.”

“Get off me,” I said flatly, though the warmth rushing to my face betrayed my calm tone.

She tilted her head, pretending to think, her ponytail swaying slightly. “Hmm, nope! Not until you promise to get up. Today’s Valentine’s Day! It’s a special occasion!”

“It’s just another day,” I grumbled, turning my head to the side to avoid looking directly at her. The faint scent of strawberries drifted from her hair, hinting that she probably had taken a bath already.

“Oh, come on,” she said, crossing her arms but staying firmly seated. “Are you really going to treat today like it’s just another day? You’re so boring!”

I sighed, dragging a hand down my face. I tried to ignore the very obvious fact that Tomoko was still sitting on me. The absurdity of the situation was one thing, but the realization that she wasn’t going to let this go made it even worse.

“You know, normal people wake others up with an alarm clock,” I said, glaring at her from the corner of my eye. “Not... whatever this is.”

“Well, you’re not normal, Onii-chan” she shot back with a playful smirk, sticking her tongue out at me.

Reluctantly, I opened both eyes and met her gaze fully. Her face was so close I could see every detail– the light dusting of freckles on her cheeks, the mischievous curl of her lips, and the way her eyes softened just a little when I finally gave her my attention. That grin of hers—the one that was equal parts innocent and troublesome—was hard to stay mad at.

“Fine, you win,” I said, sitting up slightly, though it didn’t do much to change the awkward position we were in. “Now get off me.”

“Promise you’ll get ready?” she pressed, leaning closer again, her expression daring me to refuse.

“Yeah, yeah,” I muttered, raising my hands in defeat and gently nudging her off me. “You’re impossible.”

Tomoko finally hopped off, looking far too pleased with herself. “Great! Be ready in thirty minutes! Today is important!”

With that, she skipped out of the room, leaving me to sit there, disheveled and red-faced.

Tomoko was... well, Tomoko. Full of energy, ridiculously stubborn, and always dragging me into her plans. She wasn’t my sister—not by blood, at least—but we’d been living together for a while now.

I sighed again, running a hand through my hair. Something felt different today. She looked so happy, so excited. I couldn’t help but wonder what she had planned—and why it felt like there was more to it than just another one of her schemes.

I swung my legs over the edge of the bed and dragged myself upright. My limbs still felt heavy, but there was no point in trying to cling to sleep now– Tomoko had made sure of that.

After throwing on some sweatpants and an old T-shirt, I shuffled my way into the kitchen. The faint morning chill brushed against my skin, and the sounds of my footsteps echoed softly. The sunlight streaming through the windows gave the room a warm, golden glow.

Cooking breakfast felt like the only way to regain some control over my morning after Tomoko’s wake-up ambush. It was my routine, my way of starting the day on my terms. Reaching into the fridge, I grabbed a couple of eggs and set them on the counter, my other hand instinctively reaching for the frying pan.

“Stop!”

Tomoko’s voice startled me, and before I could react, she suddenly appeared beside me, snatching the eggs from my hands.

“What now?” I asked, raising an eyebrow as I looked at her.

She carefully set the eggs back in the fridge, then turned to me with her hands on her hips. “You’re not cooking today,” she declared, her tone leaving no room for argument.

I stared at her blankly. “I always cook,” I replied flatly. “And I’m hungry.”

“Well, today’s special,” she said with a cheeky wink. “We’re eating out. You’ll thank me later.”

My gaze flicked between her and the fridge. “That sounds expensive.”

“Don’t worry about it,” she chirped, grabbing my shoulders and steering me out of the kitchen. Her hands were small but firm. “Now go take a bath and get dressed properly. No sweatpants. No T-shirts. I mean it!”

She shoved me toward the bathroom before I could argue. “And don’t take too long, or I’ll come in and drag you out!”

“Yeah, yeah,” I muttered, waving her off.

As I turned on the shower, the steady stream of warm water cascading over me began to wash away my sleepiness. My mind can’t help but wonder what she was planning. Tomoko always had a knack for surprises, and she seemed especially determined today.

By the time I stepped out, the bathroom mirror was fogged up, and the lingering warmth of the water clung to my skin. I grabbed a towel, dried off, and threw on something passably decent—jeans and a button-up shirt, per her unspoken dress code.

When I stepped into the living room, Tomoko was already waiting by the door, practically bouncing with excitement. 

She looked… stunning.

She is wearing an off-shoulder white blouse that draped elegantly, exposing just enough of her collarbone to seem playful without trying too hard. It was paired with a pink skirt that swayed with every movement, falling just above her knees. Long white socks covered her legs, making the outfit look both youthful and stylish. Her purple hair was tied up in twin buns, each secured with a cheerful yellow bow that somehow added to her overall charm.

For a moment, I was speechless.

“What?” she asked, noticing my gaze.

“Nothing,” I said quickly, looking away. But the image of her stayed in my mind, lingering like  a faint perfume. 

“Finally! Let’s go!” she said, grabbing my hand and pulling me outside before I could even slip on my shoes properly.

Her grip was warm and insistent, and before I knew it, she was dragging me out the door. As we stepped into the crisp morning air, I couldn't help but feel a mix of curiosity and apprehension about what she had planned.

We walked through the bustling streets of Shinkai City, the sun casting a warm glow over the familiar sights. Tomoko led the way, her steps light and purposeful, while I followed, still trying to shake off the remnants of sleep.

After a short walk, we arrived at a quaint café I'd never noticed before. The sign above the door read ""Copy Cafe Kapikachu"".

The café was cozy, with a whimsical design that matched its quirky name. The exterior had a cartoonish charm, with pastel colors and a neon-lit mascot resembling a chubby hamster holding a steaming coffee cup. Inside, the warm smell of freshly brewed coffee mixed with the faint sweetness of pastries wafting from the counter.

Tomoko didn’t hesitate for a moment. She grabbed my wrist and led me straight to the counter, where a cheerful barista greeted us with a smile.

“Welcome to Copy Café Kapikachu! What can I get for you today?”

Tomoko leaned over the counter, her eyes scanning the menu. “We have to try their exclusive Valentine’s day special drink!” she said, turning to me with a grin.

“I’ll just take a black coffee,” I replied, trying to keep things simple.

Tomoko pouted. “Boring! It’s Valentine’s Day—live a little! Let’s order the special couple Frappe.”

Before I could protest, she placed the order for both of us, along with a couple of heart-shaped strawberry shortcakes.

“You didn’t have to order for me,” I muttered as we found a table by the window.

“Of course I did!” she said, pulling out her phone and snapping a quick photo of the café’s adorable interior. “Besides, you’ll thank me later. This place is famous for their drinks!”

As we waited, I glanced around the café. The customers seemed to be mostly couples, laughing and chatting over colorful drinks and desserts. A soft playlist of romantic pop songs hummed in the background, adding to the cozy ambiance.

Tomoko was busy scrolling through her phone. I leaned back in my chair, taking in the relaxed vibe of the place.

“Here you go!” The barista returned with our drinks and cakes, placing them on the table with a flourish. The Valentine’s Couple Frappe Special was topped with whipped cream and caramel drizzle, complete with a little hamster-shaped cookie perched on the rim of the glass. Since it is a drink designed for couples, there are two straws entangled, forming a heart shape.

Tomoko clasped her hands together in excitement. “Look at how cute this is!”

I raised an eyebrow, skeptical. “It’s a little too... extra.”

“Oh, stop pretending you’re not impressed.” She took a sip, her face lighting up instantly. “Mmm! It’s so good! Try it!”

I mentally facepalmed before taking the straw between my lips reluctantly. The sweetness hit me right away. The taste wasn’t bad—actually, it was pretty good.

“See? Told you it was worth it,” Tomoko said, smiling triumphantly.

“Yeah, it’s fine,” I muttered, trying not to give her the satisfaction.

She grinned. “Told you! This place really knows how to make Valentine’s Day drinks.” Her eyes gleamed as she picked up her straw again, watching the way our two drinks were connected by the straws. “You know... this kind of reminds me of something in physics.”

I raised an eyebrow, glancing at the straws twisted together. “Physics? How?”

I am already used to her talking about stuff like this but there is still a lot of this that I don’t know so when she mentioned that, my curiosity was sparked and I’m hyped up.

Tomoko’s expression lit up. “You see, it’s kind of like quantum entanglement. When two particles become linked, even if they’re far apart, what happens to one particle will instantly affect the other. No matter the distance.”

I blinked, my interest piqued. “Wait... you’re saying our drinks are like... quantum particles?”

She nodded enthusiastically. “Exactly! The straws are ‘entangled,’ and when you drink, it’s like a ripple effect that impacts the other one—even if you’re not touching it.”

I thought about it for a moment, letting the idea sink in. “So, if I take a sip, you’ll feel it across the room?”

Tomoko laughed softly, her eyes sparkling. “Not exactly, but you get the concept. Quantum entanglement means that things are connected, no matter how far apart they seem. It’s like we’re both part of this moment, linked by our shared experience, even if we’re just sitting here drinking.”

I took a slow sip, glancing at the straws again. The analogy was strange, but somehow, it made sense. “Alright, I guess I’m... entangled, then?”

She nodded, pleased with my response. “See? It’s not all bad.”

After we finished our drinks and dessert, Tomoko grabbed my wrist again, her energy as boundless as ever. “Come on, we’ve got more places to see!”

“Are you planning to drag me around all day?” I asked, though I let her lead me without much resistance.

She shot me a grin over her shoulder. “Obviously. It’s Valentine’s Day—I can’t let you waste it by being boring. Oh, and by the way…” She paused for a moment, her grin turned into a sly smile. “I prepared a gift for you. But you’ll only get it if you hang out with me until the end of the day.”

I blinked, caught off guard by her words. A gift? She didn’t elaborate but that just triggered my curiosity so I decided to follow along. 

Our next stop turned out to be an aquarium, its grand entrance adorned with banners advertising a Valentine’s-themed exhibit. Inside, the dim lighting and the glowing blue tanks created a serene, otherworldly atmosphere. Schools of fish swam in hypnotic patterns, and jellyfish drifted like living lava lamps.

Tomoko’s enthusiasm was contagious. She pressed her face to the glass of every tank, pointing out creatures I barely knew the names of.

We spent the rest of the morning exploring the aquarium, wandering through tunnels where sharks swam overhead and pausing at an interactive touch pool where Tomoko dared me to hold a starfish. By the time we stepped back into the sunlight, my usual reluctance to follow her plans had all but melted away.

Our next stop was the mall. The atmosphere was lively, filled with couples carrying shopping bags and kids darting between stores. Tomoko and I wandered aimlessly for a while, pausing at random shops to window-shop or laugh at overpriced trinkets.

At one point, as she bent down to adjust her bag strap, I caught a fleeting glimpse inside her bag. Among the usual clutter– her wallet and phone— was a wrapped package decorated with tiny hearts.

Before I could get a better look, she stood up and adjusted the strap. “Ready to move on?”

“Yeah”, I replied while my mind lingered on what I’d seen.

Eventually, we stumbled upon a small stage in the center of the mall, where a crowd had gathered. A banner overhead announced: “Valentine’s Day Magic Show!”

Tomoko’s eyes lit up. “Oh, we have to watch this!”

“Seriously?” I asked, but she was already pulling me toward the front of the crowd.

As we settled into place, the magician stepped onto the stage, dressed in a sleek black suit and top hat. The crowd clapped enthusiastically as he began his performance, pulling colorful scarves out of thin air and making objects disappear.

Tomoko was riveted, her gaze glued to the stage. I found myself watching her more than the magician, noticing the way her eyes sparkled with childlike wonder.

“See? This is fun,” she whispered, nudging me with her elbow.

“Yeah,” I admitted, a small smile tugging at my lips. “It’s not bad.”

As the magician moved on to his next trick, the atmosphere seemed to shift slightly, and I had a feeling this Valentine’s Day adventure was far from over.

After the magic show ended, our stomachs reminded us it was time for lunch. We found a cozy little restaurant near the mall and shared a hearty meal.

“I need energy,” she said, justifying her choices with a grin. “We still have the arcade to dominate.”

And dominate we did. The afternoon flew by in a whirlwind of flashing lights and the sound of coins clinking into machines. Tomoko was frighteningly good at claw machines, snagging not one but two cat plushies—one for herself and she immediately handed the other one to me.

“This one matches your vibe,” she teased, laughing as she shoved the plush into my hands.

“I don’t know how to react to that,” I replied, smirking.

We played everything from racing games to rhythm games, her energy seemingly endless. We got some coupons from playing and headed to the reward shop to exchange these coupons for various items. 

I crouched to see the items below and checked if there’s something interesting that I would want my coupons to be exchanged into. Tomoko was beside me standing on my right side and I noticed that she was holding her bag using her left hand while her right hand seemed to inspect some items. The curiosity of me to know what her gift gnawed at my thoughts.

I looked up to see if she would catch me looking at her bag but then it was a different thing that attracted my eyes. It was the bloomers under her skirt. Upon noticing that, I immediately moved away before she caught me looking and misunderstood what I’m trying to catch a glimpse of.

I stood up and found a trading card game pack. I pointed it out to Tomoko and she agreed that we should get it—- so we did. The coupons that we collected were enough for us to get a couple of packs.

By the time we stepped out of the arcade, the sky was streaked with orange and pink, signaling the end of the day. As we walked toward the station to head home, the atmosphere shifted. Tomoko was unusually quiet, her usual bubbly demeanor giving way to something more thoughtful.

“Hey, Onii-chan,” she began, breaking the silence.

“Yeah?” I glanced at her, noticing how her gaze was fixed on the horizon.

She hesitated for a moment, then turned to me with a small smile. “Do you remember what I said earlier? About quantum entanglement?”

“Yeah,” I said, curious where this was going.

“Well, there’s another concept in quantum physics—superposition,” she said, her voice soft but steady. “It’s the idea that something can exist in multiple states at once until it’s observed and the wave function collapses.”

I thought about it for a moment. “Okay... and how does that relate to anything right now?”

She laughed lightly, though there was a tinge of nervousness in it. “It’s like... our relationship. Right now, it’s in superposition—it exists in every possible state in the universe. We could stay as we are now, like siblings, or we could be something more. But eventually, someone has to collapse the wave function and decide.”

Her words hung in the air, their meaning sinking in slowly but surely. I stopped walking, turning to face her fully.

“Are you saying you want me to decide?” I asked, my voice quieter than I intended.

Tomoko met my gaze, her usual playfulness replaced by something far more vulnerable. “I’m saying... I’m okay with whatever state we end up in. But after today, I just thought you should know—there’s more than one possibility. And I’m waiting to see which one you choose.”

I was at a loss for words. The world around us seemed to blur, leaving just the two of us standing there, caught between the present and the infinite possibilities of what could be.

We arrived at the station, and the air between us was still quiet, heavy with unspoken words. Tomoko walked beside me, her usual spring in her step replaced with a calmer, more subdued rhythm.

As we reached the platform, she paused, glancing down at her bag. Before I could say anything, she pulled out the wrapped package I’d glimpsed earlier and held it out to me.

“Here, for you,” she said softly, her cheeks tinged pink. “But open it later once we arrive home, okay?” She smiled as I took the package.

By the time we boarded the train, I could see the exhaustion catching up to her. She settled into the seat beside me and let out a soft sigh.

Without a word, she leaned her head against my shoulder, her eyes fluttering closed.

I didn’t move, letting her rest. The steady rhythm of the train filled the silence, a soothing backdrop to the whirlwind of thoughts in my mind.

Her earlier words echoed softly, like ripples on a still lake. Superposition. Infinite possibilities. Waiting for me to decide.

I glanced down at her, her face peaceful and calm. For now, it felt like the universe could stay in this state a little longer—neither one of us needing to collapse anything.

As the train carried us toward home, I stared out the window at the darkening sky, the faint lights of the city beginning to glow.

Whatever was inside this gift— or whatever the future held, for this moment, it felt enough just to exist in it together.

1ia7up9,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/1ia7up9/in_need_of_serious_help/,In need of serious help,"To start, I am dad, and I am writing about our 2 year old (25 months) son. I will keep it short: every child is different, my wife and I completely understand that as we have a 4.5 year old son. I am a full time student but only go to class twice a week, and she is a stay at home mom, but in reality, we are both stay at home parents. We each have our roles; I cook, clean, do the shopping, etc., and she mostly deals with the kids, however we do swap roles, so there is no “the kids are used to her and not me” type situation. 

This has been going on for the last 1.5 years: Our 2 year old son is causing a major strain in our home due to his constant scream crying when told no, not getting his way, or just about anything else honestly. My wife and I don’t argue, however, we did have a major argument 2 days ago due to his behavior, and the last 3-4 fights in the last have been attributed to his behavior as-well. He is also very mean ti his older brother by throwing, hitting, jumping on, and biting him. It’s also important to mention that we virtually have no help. My mother loves 2 hours away and is very selfish absorbed/ignorant and her mother is the same way, just that she lives around the corner. Neither of them offer to help and/or almost always have an excuse when we ask…we’ve stopped after years of disappointment. When we did use their help, we would get calls and texts an hour into our “date”, asking us to come home because he’s crying. Honestly typing this is causing my eyes to well up. 

My wife and I can’t hear ourselves talk or think, and unfortunately we often lose patience very easily with our older son, who is just being a 4 year old boy, especially when the crying and tantrums are taking place. He is dealing with the crying and anxiety as well and it’s not fair to him. 

He is still breast fed, however, my wife is currently working on ways to inorganically wean due to her and breast feeding being the only way to break his tantrum. At the moment I am completely unable to console him, and we’re hoping that him not “needing”, or wanting, to feed will help remedy that some; it’s becoming clear that it is simply a comfort issue, as he doesn’t even drink sometimes. But if she takes it away, or attempts to redirect his attention, he’s loses it. 

Without going over every single thing that we’ve tried, I’ll just say that we have tried virtually everything. He only watches tv for a short while in the mornings while we have tea and coffee, due to this being one of the only times that her and I can sit and communicate with one another. Our other bit of free time begins at around 9:15pm after the boys go to bed, and 11pm, when he wakes up crying. 

Because we feel like we’ve tried everything, I’m not sure what to ask, but what can we do? Does it get better with a child like him? I do love him, but I hate the way he makes me so angry and anxious, literally 90% of the day for the last 1.5 years. Help us with any advice. Even if that advice is related to my wife and I’s mental health and not him at all.

I feel like it's the least I can do.

But I can tell my coworkers are becoming a little uncomfortable, and think that by giving him money every few weeks I'm creating a relationship where he will (destructively) rely on me. He has a friend who is also homeless and who looks out for him when he is particularly ill or tired.

Toxicity—whether it’s the company we keep, the junk food we eat, the doomscrolling we do, or the meaningless conversations we tolerate—leaves a permanent stain. In this wild era of instant everything, negativity isn’t just lurking around the corner—it’s practically invited in and handed the remote control. Propaganda, toxic tech, smartphones, social media, and convenience apps like DoorDash have created a buffet of shallow engagement and endless distractions.

Don’t get me wrong—convenience has its perks. Who doesn’t love a burrito delivered right to their couch during a Netflix binge? But like any addictive substance, overindulgence quickly spirals into self-sabotage. Before you know it, you’re 300 pounds overweight, your brain is an overflowing junk drawer of useless trivia, and your thumb is practically stuck in the scroll position.

And then there’s TV, the OG dealer of mental junk food. Mainstream news is like a tragic soap opera you didn’t sign up for but can’t seem to look away from. People binge on other people’s pain as if it’s the hottest new drama series. It’s trauma porn, plain and simple. Older generations especially cling to the excuse that they “just want to stay informed.” But do you really need to know about a robbery in a town you’ll never visit? Unless it’s coming to your doorstep, do you need to carry that emotional baggage? Spoiler alert: no.

I’ve had my fair share of personal drama—I don’t need a side of the world’s chaos with my morning coffee. And yet, society tells us it’s normal, even noble, to soak up every drop of misery offered by the 24-hour news cycle. Newsflash: It’s not noble. It’s exhausting.

Over time, I’ve noticed how normalized these toxic habits have become, especially in America. We’re a nation of passive consumers, scrolling and snacking our way through emotional and mental sludge. It’s high time we broke out of this hamster wheel of mental junk food and started curating what we consume—physically, mentally, and emotionally.

I get it, though. This is ‘Merica, the land of “Do what you want, consequences be damned.” Everyone picks their poison. Maybe it’s fast food, maybe it’s TikTok, maybe it’s yelling at strangers in Facebook comment threads. We all have vices—nobody’s perfect. So go ahead, indulge. Meanwhile, the microscopic minority of us trying to live detoxed, intentional lives are left dodging the chaos like it’s a game of emotional dodgeball.

And let’s be real: deciding to step off the societal hamster wheel is basically a declaration of weirdness. People treat you like you’re the strange one because you’re not obsessed with the latest drama or scrolling through everyone else’s highlight reels. Fine. Let me be the weirdo. I’ll be over here sipping kombucha, watching the madness unfold like a dystopian sitcom I didn’t audition for.

So who else feels this way? Who’s choosing peace over chaos? Who’s breaking the toxic cycles and reclaiming their mental space? Let’s start a club—or at least a support group—because this circus is exhausting, and I’m ready to quit the act.

1ia7o0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/1ia7o0m/insider_tips_for_your_stay_any_marriott_gaylord/,INSIDER TIPS FOR YOUR STAY @ ANY MARRIOTT GAYLORD HOTEL!,"Here are all the need to know about these hotels. I’m going to make a laundry list of things that can improve your stay or fix issues you might experience at any Marriott owned hotel. I’m speaking from a previous employees standpoint from Marriott’s Gaylord’s Hotels, it’s not often you get access to information like this. So tune in if you’re planning on spending way too much money at one of these hotels. Not all of these will apply to all Marriott hotels so keep this in mind while reading. I’ve mentioned which ones are Gaylord specific. 

1) There is a Marriott Reservation Teams dedicated to providing information about hotel occupancy, date availability, and pricing. The reservation teams will have MORE information than the front desk when it comes to occupancy + pricing. Occupancy affects prices immensely! The less people the better the prices, the more people, the pricier the room will be. If you ask the front desk they won’t be able to offer you pricing in advance as it can be pretty hard to determine. Front desk employees do have access to occupation reports, although, they can only generate up to 10 days in the future of how many people are staying at the hotel vs the reservation team having more specific information on these kinds of things. They won’t be able to tell you anything past those 10 days. What should you ask the Marriott Reservation Team? Example: “I’d like to know what your occupancy is for March 25th, 2025.” 

The front desk associates cannot see into the future past these 10 days. It would very much be in your BEST interest to contact the Marriott reservation team before contacting the front desk on this matter. 

If you ever come across an associate who seems uninterested in helping you or simply doesn’t know how to look into whatever you’re asking for all you need to do is politely ask for someone else who might. If you’re looking to avoid phone hold times call early in the morning. If you get a robot just ask for a representative and it should ring you to a live employee. Most Marriotts have front desk associates 24/7 (I cannot ensure this for all of Marriott hotels, but this is the case for the Marriott Gaylord hotels.) 

2)  If you’re having a less than desirable stay, seriously any issue just go speak to the associates at the front desk. The big thing here will be your attitude, so leave your anger and frustrations in your room before doing so. Since the Gaylord’s front desk is staffed 24/7 you can do this at any time during your stay (3A.M if you really wanted to) if you’re having Issues with your room, food, amenities, or anything tbh - just go speak to an associate at the front desk, now this only works if you’re respectful and candid, try not to let your emotions take control and list your complaints respectfully, if you have pictures of your problem(s) their response will be better. 

The associates are always willing to help and fix things if you’re willing to have a normal conversation about it. If you come across an associate who seems less than willing to assist you, then ask for a manager but again do not get frustrated. Bad attitude will not benefit you at all. From my personal experience as an employee, if guests came to me with valid complaints or problems and they were kind and communicative I was ready to make there stay 100% better if I could. Money is not a thing in these kinds of hotels but don’t get greedy and don’t push your luck. 

I would often remove food charges, offer upgraded rooms, moving rooms, breakfast/lunch/dinner vouchers, gift baskets, and all kinds of things if it meant fixing a bad experience. My go to was meal vouchers (I would base the dollar amount of the voucher on how many people were associated with their party. Or I would remover meal charges from their bill. If you’ve ever eaten at any Gaylord you know your food bill can really add up. It’s always best to charge the food to your room, this way it can be removed from the bill if needed. If you charge it on your card at the restaurant it’s a lot harder to return your funds/compensate guests for their negative experience.

At Gaylord’s specifically, any Front Desk Associate (does not need to be a manager) could completely comp up to 1 night stay. You’re not getting comped for a bad food experience, or minor complaints, it has to be a really big problem like if housekeeping or security entered your room without permission or a water leak. Depending on your attitude again, and the problem you’re having it’s really likely they’ll remove the cost of 1 nights stay, it all really depends on how you ask for this and who you get at the front desk. Again you don’t really need a manager for this to happen. 

If your food is cold, was delivered super late, wrong order arrived, order never arrived, ect, go politely complain - I’m almost positive the associate will remove it from your bill ASAP and offer that the food be remade. (assuming you charged it to your room, as mentioned above this is the best way to ensure your money back if something goes wrong I would take food off of people bills and resend the order all the time. Even if the guest had a bad attitude I would still make this right (not all employees will be as willing to go the extra mile if you’re blatantly rude) If they had a good attitude though I would take the correction further by adding on a meal voucher or sending a goodie basket to their room. Again, pennies and chump change for Marriott. 

3) You can request feather free rooms if you have bad allergies. There are certain types of rooms which might cater to your stay better than a standard room. Some Gaylord’s have bunk beds for kids. Not all king rooms have a pull out couch make sure you double check w Front Desk if you’re needing this. Rollaway beds (an extra bed that can be brought to your room. There are foam pillow and feather pillows. Blankets and comforters are DIFFERENT, blankets are thin like paper and the comforters are the bigger ones. Some hotels have theater rooms (a wing in the room which has extra seats + tv’s.) Ask for their room catalog the options will suprise you. A lot of it isn’t listed of their website so ask the Front Desk. 

The water and coffee in your room will NOT cost you extra, you’ve already been charged for them in the form of a “resort fee” so use them and request new ones daily. There’s no getting out of the resort fee so don’t ask, just enjoy your amenities and request extras. They have everything you might need; combs, razors, shaving cream, toothpaste, deodorant, feminine hygiene products, floss, and basic hygiene products you might have forgotten to pack. This one might be Marriott Gaylord specific, I’m not sure if this is the case with all Marriott hotels but never hurts to ask. 

4) The pools are open all year long, yes, even if it’s cold. They’re heated too! If the weather is threatening (lightning or blizzard) the pool will be shut down. The word “water park” at some of these Gaylord locations is an over statement so beware of this. Same thing with the “arcade”, lame games and expensive cards for game credits + short play times.  (Gaylord Specific) 

5) If you have too much fun and pass out somewhere in the hotel you might wake up wondering how the hell you made it back to your room, the truth is, security likely had to wheel chair your sleepy drunk a** to your room after digging in your pockets to figure out who you are and what room you’re assigned too. If they can’t figure out who you are or where you belong they will take however long necessary to get you where you need to be. If you’re inebriated they will wait until you’re conscious enough to verify where you belong. Yes, they’re allowed to do this, just be thankful they didn’t send you to the hospital in an ambulance. If they feel like you need medical attention they won’t hesitate to call. There a serious requirements/protocol involved to return someone to their room. 

6) Parking gate tickets giving you an issue? Use the call button if you’re lucky an underpaid associate will answer the call box and let you through the gate without charge. This isn’t the instance every time, if they ask for your room number and you give it to them, parking fee’s will be added to your room bill (per night) and your room key will be activated to open the gates. 

7) DO NOT USE 3RD PARTY BOOKING SITES. Just book using the Marriott website. Here are some of the risks that will absolutely occur if you’ve booked through a 3rd party booking site; they can’t refund your room, they can’t cancel your stay, they can’t change or upgrade your room, they can’t change your dates of stay, and getting your money back from these 3rd party sites can be extremely challenging especially since Marriott is not directly involved in your reservation/purchase. Hotel associates will not be able to help you with any of this. If you booked 3rd party then you have to communicate with the 3rd party site you booked with to fix errors in your reservation. I’m serious, just don’t book with 3rd party and save yourself the headache, the difference in price can be enticing but I’m warning you now, it’s the worst way to book any stay at any hotel. 

8) Cleaning crews operate 24/7 through out the hotel. They have large staffing to ensure that the hotel is thoroughly cleaned. Everything in the hotel, bathrooms, halls, meeting rooms, and honestly any area of the hotel that is in reach. They actually go to great lengths to uphold cleanliness in all areas of the hotel. (This is Gaylord specific.)

9) Bring your own booze, this place will ring your pockets for alcohol. You can have alcohol delivered to your room (again super pricey.) Bars close when they close (based on the state you’re in and the liquor laws associated with that state.) You cannot bribe anyone to give you liquor past that time, it’s the law so go to bed or bring your own booze so you can sip all night, you will be told no 100 times if necessary.

10) You’re not getting the Presidential Suite (the best and biggest room in house.) They don’t care who you are, how much money you have, or if you’re a Platinum, Titanium, Ambassador member or what ever status you have. You’re not getting it I promise. The presidential suite is reserved for big groups in house (business/corporations that bought 400+ rooms for an employee sponsored event at the hotel) the suite requires loads of paperwork weeks in advanced to the stay and can only be approved by the top shot hotel managers.

11) If you have a high elite status then you’re really likely to have a lot of additional privileges. As for room upgrades, if it’s available they will definitely give you a suite. There were multiple times in my employment where I would upgrade Platinum, Titanium and Ambassador members rooms to a suite free of charge just because I could not because I had to. Most members with high status’s expect this or ask for it. If occupancy is high they will make you pay for the room upgrade. 

If you’re silver or gold status you’re probably not getting a free upgrade, don’t ask why, I really don’t know. For your elite status one night free suite stay the hotel is not required or obligated to honor this when you arrive for check-in unless you’ve requested it in advanced and the request was approved (one of those high status privileges mentions earlier.) Complaining at the front desk will not change this at all, this is out of the hotel staffs control, it must be approved through Marriott using the online request. You are absolutely required to have the request approved through Marriott it’s not something you ask for upon check-in it has nothing to do with staff at the hotel. Read the fine print. 

12) If you behave poorly a report will be made in a Marriott wide database. Every stay you have ever had will have notes about what kind of guest you are. Whether it’s negative or neutral. This is especially important if you’ve ever been charged for damages you caused in the hotel or smoking in the room. Any employee can view that information and will know if you’re a naughty guest or a well behaved guest. Same thing for your desires and common requests as a guest. 

If you were charged for smoking in the room your likeliness to successfully appeal the charge is 0%. The truth is they’ve already collected sufficient evidence against you to support this charge without your knowledge. Reports were made, photos were taken, ash was found in your room. Who reported you? Your hotel neighbor, security, or housekeeping. You have to remember that different types of employees have access to your room so try and get mad about someone entering your room without you being present all you want but it won’t help your case unfortunately. 

My recommendation is go smoke outside. Gaylord properties are “smoke free” so this is not something they will take lightly and the fee is pretty hefty. No one will bother you if you smoke outside. If you get caught smoking in your room (or evidence was collected showing you smoked in the room) this will be in your worldwide Marriott record FOREVER, go ahead and make a new account because it’s not going away. It’s unlikely you’ll be banned but they will watch you closely in your next visits at any Marriott hotels. 

13) You don’t have to check out at the Front Desk, your card is on file, they will charge it at checkout time. Although it is super helpful to employees to check out at the front desk or on your T.V. you’re not obligated to, feel free to just walk out and leave. Late check out is pretty available. Yes you might get an additional fee for this. Ask for it as early as possible. If you want free late check out it’s best to ask an overnight employee, call in the dead of night to ask. The daytime employees get bonuses from late check out charges, overnight employees don’t give a sh*t because they don’t really benefit from charging for late check out. This is not a promise and your attitude will affect this immensely. (Gaylord specific) 

14) The room capacity is usually 6. This usually does not affect the price of your stay but it can if the occupancy of the hotel is high during your stay. If you’re bringing a lot of people just book your reservation for two guests. No one is counting how many people you bring so don’t mention it. Usually the place is too big to really look into something like this. Obviously don’t put yourself in a position where they have to investigate you and your party. Behave and you’re really likely to not incur additional charges for extra guests. The bigger the hotel the better. 

15) You can ask for housekeeping to never enter your room during your stay. Although, your linens, towels, and trash will not be cleaned/replaced. You will have to call the front desk and request these services if you’ve requested housekeeping not enter your room during your stay. Your DND (do not disturb) sign for the door handle does not apply to security. If they need to enter your room they will, it says it right on the tag and you will not be able to argue this with staff of security enters your room. There is a specific protocol that staff must follow before entering your room. If you don’t answer the door they will enter. 

If you requested a wake up call and fail to answer the phone when it comes, security will literally come wake you up. A lot of guests are unaware of this when they request wake up calls and are often caught off guard by this. Security will be at your door knocking if you haven’t answered the phone for your requested wake up call. If you don’t answer the door you can 100% expect the security guard to enter the room and verbally wake you up. Complain all you want it’s another one of those read the fine print situations. They also have the materials necessary to undo a deadlock/deadbolt. 

16) Park your car in well lit areas of the lots. Do not park near the gates/exits of the parking lot (thieves will target your vehicle for theft.) Do not leave your car unattended for long periods of time. Valet is a dreadful waste of money maintained by mindless 3rd party companies who have little respect for your vehicle (not always the case but super common problem for these hotels unfortunately.) Do not drive through/damage the red and white gates, and especially do not tamper with the gates. Security usually has the best footage in these areas and you will be charged assuming you had plates on your vehicle, a police report will be made if possible. 

17) If you brought a fire arm to the hotel and forgot to take it with you upon check-out, it’s extremely difficult to have it returned to you. If it is found by housekeeping and you return just minutes after its discovery it will not be returned to you immediately. You will be required to provide all the necessary identification/documentation to the police in order to have it returned. Super timely and painful process. Leave your gun at home, if not then do not forget it. 

18) If your valuables got locked in the room safe due to a dead battery or you don’t remember the code you set, inform the front desk, the security team will solve your problem, do not try to open the safe by force as this will result in a damage fee. If you get locked out of your room you will be required to identify yourself using legal documentation (ID, passport, ect.) If your card fails to pay during your stay you will be locked out of your room once you leave the room and your assigned key cards will not function requiring you to visit the front desk to resolve the payment issue. 

19) Lost and found can be tricky but more than often your item was located by hotel staff and turned into security. If you’ve already left the hotel you can have your item shipped to you on your dollar (assuming they found your item.) There is a form requiring descriptive information about your lost item and your mailing information in order for them to successfully ship it back to your desired location. Usually the form can be acquired by communicating directly with security.  If they don’t have what you lost, you can assume you didn’t lose it there or it was stolen - unfortunately in this case hotel staff will be unable to offer you any further assistance in regards to your lost item. 

20)  List of random sh*t you can ask for if it’s available; baby crib, humidifier, box fan, midnight snacks & beverages, diapers, contact solution, over the counter medication, wheel chairs, bell carts to your room, luggage assistance (usually free), distilled water, air mattresses, thermometers, and lots more, try asking even if it seems unlikely they might have it. (Gaylord specific) 

Feel free to ask questions, I cannot tell you which areas of the hotel I worked in as to protect my identity but I have lots of good info the average guest would never ever know. If anyone can somehow benefit from this knowledge please do! Your hotel stay does not have to suck. The best approach will always be to be kind to the staff when communicating your issues/needs, it will seriously benefit your chances for resolve. 

Cheers everyone, I’m wishing you a great stay on your next reservation. If you somehow made it to the end of this post then your chances of a better stay is 100%! A lot of this stuff will apply to regular Marriotts as well being that they all usually operate with the same standards as the Marriott Gaylord hotels. Although, I am mainly speaking about the Marriott Gaylord hotels in this post because I cannot ensure any of this for standard Marriott hotels. I also cannot ensure everything in this post because I was very generous as an employee for this company (as is expected of all employees) but your chances are high if you know what to ask for and how to ask for it. 

I apologize for the wordy post, I tried to include lots of paragraph breaks.

1ia7mab,https://www.reddit.com/r/chocolate/comments/1ia7mab/hot_cocoa_recs_for_lazy_diy_mocha/,"Hot cocoa recs for ""lazy"" DIY mocha?","I often make a ""lazy girl"" mocha by microwaving water, making coffee in a basic French press, then dumping a packet of Swiss Miss w/lil marshmallows in with my coffee in the mug and stirring. 

I like it! I have improved it by doing stuff like getting a Brita filter for my tap water and getting the French press ground coffee from a local roaster. My fave roasts are blonde and medium, well balanced (not overly acidic), and have a bold *coffee*-coffee flavor (occasionally with berry or nut undertones). 

Question:
**What type of fancier chocolate should I try to up the flavor game?**

Important: I'm still lazy! 

- I do not want to melt a chocolate disc in a pan on my stovetop, which is constantly broken. 
- I'm not gonna get an espresso machine. 
- I likely need cocoa in a form that does not require refrigeration, because, again, the appliances here are crap. 

Ideal recommendations:

- Already powder or small bits (chips?) that easily melt evenly when stirred in hot coffee

- Rich, complex flavors 

- Stirring in a little brown sugar or something is within the bounds of my commitment to laziness! So, open to chocolate anywhere across the sweet-bitter spectrum. 

- If it has milk, ideally low or no lactose

- Bonus points for vegan and ethical labor, tho not mandatory 

I once received a fancy hot cocoa from Goodnow Farms as a gift, and it was so good. 

For reference: 
- I am often broke but I will splurge on this! 
- I live in a city in the Midwest in the United States, which is relevant if I need to pay for shipping. 

☕🍫💜 Thanks!

I believe life is better when shared with a little humor and a lot of curiosity.

I have a deep fascination with history, especially Ancient Greece. There’s something magical about sitting on old stones and pondering the meaning of life. Maybe I was a philosopher in a past life? But don’t worry, I’m fully modern now—coffee and anime are my fuel!

I’m also passionate about motorcycles and dream of exploring Europe on two wheels someday. Traveling feels like a grand adventure to me, and getting lost just adds more fun to the story.

If you’re up for conversations about physics, anime, motorcycles, and Ancient Greek philosophy over a cup of coffee, then you’re in the right place. Who knows? We might even start an exciting new adventure together.

1ia7jxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1ia7jxb/can_gnomes_follow_you_from_location_to_location/,Can gnomes follow you from location to location,"The past three months I have been moving states for a new job. I left a house I owned and moved two states for a job (a total move of about two hours from door to door). First, I was in temporary corporate housing (a furnished condo) provided by my company and now I am in a rented, new home. The temporary housing was for sixty days.

From the end of October until this week, a time period where I completely moved out of my old home, put most of my belongings in storage while I stayed in corporate housing and look for a permanent rental, and then moved into the permanent rental, I’ve had a couple of things go missing and then turn up (or not) in strange ways. I truly believe some otherworldly entity, and actually a tribe of gnomes, is following me and fucking with me. I am scatterbrained and some misplaced stuff is almost certainly my own doing, but some other instances are too hard to explain.

First instance: I went to a big Halloween party back at the end of October while moving out of my house. I did not bring my wallet with me because it did not fit in the clutch I wore, that went with my costume. Instead, in my small clutch I had my ID, my credit card, a lipstick, my phone, and a travel size tub of cosmetic glitter. About an hour into the party I drop the clutch, which is a hard bodied heart shaped bag, and it breaks. I have no where to put my stuff—no bag, no pockets, so I stick it all in my knee high cowboy boots.

My boyfriend, who was buying the drinks, leaves early and I want to stay and dance. As such, I go to the bar and open a tab once I’m wanting a drink upon his departure. I close it out and put the card back in my boot, thinking it will be my last cocktail and I’ll be going home soon. However, I’m soon having fun dancing again and craving another drink. I go to grab my card out of my boot and it’s gone. I can’t find it on the floor, it’s not at the bar, and it’s not in my boot. I assume that I’ve dropped it so I cancel it the next day. 

A few weeks later, after my replacement card has already arrived, the lost card turns up in my wallet—-but I HAD NO WALLET WITH ME the night I lost it. I was using my boot after the clutch broke! I can’t wrap my head around it. The card went missing at the party while I was moving from one state, and turned up while staying in my temporary housing two states over in a wallet I wasn’t even carrying the night I lost it. 

Second instance: I was traveling over the holidays. I live in the US, but boyfriend is Canadian and we went to Canada to do the holidays with his parents. For Christmas he gave me a very lovely, very expensive opal necklace. 

On NYE, after returning to the states, we had lunch plans with friends. I spent the night before at his place in my old state. I got ready for lunch there that morning. I was wearing a high neck halter dress that looked weird with a necklace, so I took the opal necklace off and put it in my travel jewelry pouch (I had not yet returned to my own residence after our travel to Canada at this point). We did NYE things and the next morning I left to go move into my new place from my temporary housing, again driving two hours to go two states over from where I lived in October and where boyfriend lives. 

I first went to the new, permanent rental house and unpacked all my travel stuff. I put the jewelry pouch in a closet but didn’t take anything out of it at this time. I then go to the temporary apartment my company had provided for two months, about fifteen minutes from my new place, pack up the limited stuff I have there and bring it to new place. Lots of boxes come from storage following day and next two weeks are organizing and moving. 

That night though, before the boxes arrive, I make plans to meet a new friend. I put on a specific dress and decide the opal would look great with it, but I can’t find the opal in the jewelry pouch. I tell myself that it’s probably just been misplaced in the moving chaos and once I’m all unpacked and organized it will turn up. However, it doesn’t. I unpack every box and bag and go through them all multiple times. I clean out my car and search through it multiple times. Nothing.

Then yesterday, a full week after I cleaned out the car and unpacked the last box, I get into my car after grabbing a coffee and look down to put the car in drive. The opal pendant is sitting under my clutch, on the flat space between my clutch and my cup holder. 

Im totally flabbergasted! I’ve driven this car everyday since the last time I wore the necklace three weeks ago, and my boyfriend has also driven it. I had cleaned out the cupholders days before, and if the pendant had been sitting there the entire time we would have seen it, either when using the cup holders or plugging our phones in (the charger sits right there), or even putting the car in park. And on top of that it was just the pendant—not the chain. The chain was not in the car and showed up later that day in my jewelry cabinet.

I also had a dress that literally disappeared in my temporary housing. I was using the nuuly clothing rental service while in temp housing since most of my clothes were in storage and one of the items literally disappeared in that condo. I took it off one night and then couldn’t find it for the life of me when going to return the clothes. I assumed I would find it when moving out since I had to empty the corporate condo of all my belongings, but it never turned up.

I can’t explain these occurrences. A card that reappears in a wallet that was not on my person when I lost it, a pendant that suddenly reappears in a spot I look at everyday after I put it away three weeks ago, a dress that completely vanishes into thin air. I told my boyfriend I’m convinced that gnomes are following me and messing with me! But from what I understand aren’t they tied to a place? Can a gnome tribe be with ME?",0,1737872004.0,Paranormal,2,0.5,False
