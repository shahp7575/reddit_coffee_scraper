so I’ve just noticed in the past two days these werid brown patches on the back of my two front teeth, as you can see I already have a few cavity fillings which are silver I’d say my teeth are kinda weaker than other peoples because of genetics possibly. 

I don’t drink coffee, tea, no fizzy drinks no smoothies no orange juice no any juice nothing only water. 

I eat an awful amount of chocolate and I love cake to, maybe to much chocolate. 

So I noticed these two days ago but I’m always worried about my teeth anyway so I’m constantly taking pictures so on the 29th October I saw in a video I had this spot but I mustn’t of noticed it. 

Is this decay or just a stain from choclate which won’t turn into a cavity as CHATGPT is saying it’s going to form int a cavity but it’s still smooth doesn’t feel or look like a hole thanks. ",1,1768680648.0,askdentists,2,1.0,False

Its also bizarrely foamy and taste like a strong cigar. As if its in frothed milk but its just the espresso

The finished puck is also impossible to get out of the basket when done. Tapping the wand literally has the filter basket come out with the spent grinds before the grinds themselves come out

We’ve been married 7 years, together 10. We’re not a screaming couple. We bicker, we cool off, we move on. But about a month ago we had a fight that didn’t feel like a normal argument, it felt like a crack. It started over something stupid, chores and weekend plans, who was “supposed” to do what. Then it escalated fast into all the stuff we usually avoid. She said she feels like she’s been carrying the emotional weight for years. I snapped back that it feels like I live under a microscope and she keeps a running list in her head of everything I do wrong. We both got mean. Then she said this line that keeps replaying in my brain: that sometimes she wonders if she married the wrong person. I swear I felt my chest go hollow. And instead of shutting up, I said something nasty back. I threw her parents’ divorce in her face, like a weapon. The second it came out I wanted to grab the words back, but I didn’t. She cried, I got defensive, we slept in separate rooms and the next day felt like a hangover from hell.

We did apologize. Real apologies. We talked for hours. We owned what we said, we owned the cheap shots. We agreed the scorekeeping has to stop and we can’t talk to each other like enemies. Since then, things have looked better on paper. We’re doing the small “good spouse” stuff again, checking in, thanking each other, making coffee, little hugs in the kitchen. She seems lighter. She jokes, she plans stuff, she acts like we’re back to normal. And I want that so badly. But inside, I’m stuck. I keep replaying her sentence like my brain is trying to figure out if she meant it, or if it was just anger with a mouth. I catch myself reading into her tone, watching her face when I walk into the room, getting that cold drop in my stomach for no reason. It’s embarrassing, like I’m turning into this anxious version of myself I don’t even like. I don’t want to punish her forever for something said during a blow up. I don’t want to drag the fight back up and make her feel like nothing is ever “fixed”. But I also don’t know how to rebuild that layer of safety once it’s gone. If the next stressful week happens, are we right back at “maybe I married the wrong person”?

1qfnbh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheIronCouncil/comments/1qfnbh7/how_to_become_a_more_romantic_boyfriend_the/,How to Become a MORE ROMANTIC Boyfriend: The Psychology That Actually Works,"Let's cut through the noise. You care about your relationship, but something feels off. Maybe she's hinted you're ""not romantic enough,"" or maybe you've noticed she lights up more when her friend's boyfriend does something thoughtful. You're here because you want to step up, but most advice out there is either cringe (""surprise her with 100 roses!"") or useless (""just be yourself, bro"").

Here's what I learned after diving deep into relationship psychology, reading experts like Dr John Gottman and Esther Perel, and studying what actually makes romantic relationships thrive. This isn't about grand gestures or pretending to be someone you're not. It's about understanding the mechanics of romance and applying them consistently. These insights come from research, therapy frameworks, and relationship experts who've studied thousands of couples.

Step 1: Understand What Romance Actually Is (Spoiler: It's Not What You Think)

Most guys think romance equals flowers and candlelit dinners. Wrong. According to relationship research, romance is about intentional attention and emotional presence. It's showing her that she's a priority in your mental space, not an afterthought.

Dr John Gottman's research on successful couples found that the magic isn't in big moments but in small, consistent bids for connection. When she tells you about her day, do you actually listen, or are you half-watching the game? Romance starts with presence.

Here's the shift: Romance isn't about what you do. It's about making her feel seen, valued, and desired. Those three things are the foundation.

Step 2: Master the Art of Anticipation

Women are wired to appreciate anticipation and thoughtfulness. This isn't some outdated gender stereotype; it's backed by research on attachment and emotional connection. The anticipation of something good triggers dopamine, the same chemical that makes falling in love feel so damn good.

Here's how you use it: Don't just plan a date. Tease it beforehand. Text her earlier in the week, ""Got something planned for Saturday. Dress comfy but cute."" That anticipation builds excitement. She's thinking about it. You're on her mind.

Or leave a note in her bag before she heads to work: ""Can't wait to see you tonight."" Small moves. Big impact. The book ""Mating in Captivity"" by Esther Perel breaks this down beautifully. She explains how mystery and anticipation keep desire alive in long-term relationships. Perel is a world-renowned psychotherapist who's studied erotic intelligence for decades. This book will make you rethink everything you thought you knew about keeping passion alive. Insanely good read.

Step 3: Listen Like Her Words Are the Only Thing That Matters

Most guys hear their girlfriends talk. Romantic guys listen. There's a difference.

Active listening means you're not just waiting for your turn to speak or thinking about what you'll say next. You're absorbing what she's saying, asking follow-up questions, and remembering details. When she mentions she's stressed about a work presentation next Tuesday, you text her Tuesday morning: ""You're going to crush it today.""

That's romance. It shows you were paying attention. She matters enough for you to remember.

Try this for one week: Every time she talks, put your phone face down. Make eye contact. Repeat back what she said to confirm you understood. ""So you're saying your boss has been micromanaging you and it's driving you nuts?"" Watch how her face softens when she realises you're truly there.

Step 4: Spontaneity Beats Routine Every Time

Predictability kills romance. If she can set her watch by your behaviour (Netflix every Friday, sex on Saturday morning, brunch on Sunday), you've entered relationship autopilot. And autopilot is where romance goes to die.

Break the pattern. Surprise her mid-week with ""Let's go for a drive, I found this spot I want to show you."" It doesn't have to be expensive or elaborate. Spontaneity signals that you're thinking about her outside of the routine.

The app Paired is actually solid for this. It's a relationship app that sends you daily questions and challenges to keep things fresh. One day, it might ask you both about your fantasies, another day it'll challenge you to plan a surprise date. It gamifies keeping romance alive, and honestly, it works. My girlfriend and I started using it, and it sparked conversations we wouldn't have had otherwise.

Step 5: Physical Touch Beyond Sex

Here's where a lot of guys fumble. Physical affection shouldn't always lead to sex. If every time you touch her, she thinks you're trying to get laid, she'll start associating your touch with performance rather than connection.

Non sexual touch is wildly underrated. Hold her hand while you're watching TV. Kiss her forehead when you walk past her in the kitchen. Run your fingers through her hair while she's reading. These small touches build intimacy without pressure.

Dr Gary Chapman's ""The 5 Love Languages"" explores this concept in depth. Chapman is a relationship counsellor who's helped millions of couples understand how they give and receive love. If her love language is physical touch, this changes everything. The book is a quick read and gives you a framework to understand what makes her feel loved. This is the best relationship book I've ever read, hands down.

Step 6: Compliment Her in Specific, Unexpected Ways

""You're beautiful"" is fine, but it's generic. She's heard it a thousand times. Romantic guys notice details.

Try: ""I love the way your eyes light up when you talk about that project you're working on"", or ""You looked so confident presenting that idea in front of everyone today."" These compliments show you're paying attention to who she is, not just what she looks like.

Compliments about her character, intelligence, or quirks hit different. They show depth. They show you see her as a whole person, not just arm candy.

Step 7: Create Rituals That Are Just Yours

Successful couples have shared rituals, small traditions that belong only to them. Maybe it's coffee in bed every Sunday morning. Maybe it's a specific playlist you only listen to together. Maybe it's a weekly walk where you talk about your dreams and fears.

These rituals create a sense of ""us against the world."" They build a private universe that only you two inhabit. And that's romantic as hell.

Start small. Suggest something like ""Let's make Wednesday nights our night. No phones, just us, cooking dinner together."" Over time, she'll look forward to that ritual. It becomes a sacred space in your relationship.

Step 8: Express Vulnerability Without Being Needy

Here's a tough one. Romance requires emotional vulnerability. You've got to let her in. But there's a fine line between being vulnerable and being emotionally dependent.

Share your fears, your dreams, your insecurities, but don't make her your therapist. If you're struggling with something deep, consider talking to a professional. The app Ash is actually a solid tool for this. It's like having a relationship coach in your pocket, helping you process emotions and communicate better. It's helped me understand my own patterns and how to show up better in my relationship.

When you share vulnerability, you're showing her the real you. And real connection, the kind that sustains romance, requires both people to be authentic.

Step 9: Plan Dates Like You're Still Trying to Impress Her

Too many guys stop dating their girlfriends once they're in a relationship. Big mistake. You should be dating her harder now than you did in the beginning.

Put effort into planning. Don't just ask ""What do you want to do?"" Take the lead. Research a new restaurant. Plan a hike with a view. Book tickets to that concert she casually mentioned three weeks ago.

The effort shows her she's worth your time and energy. And that's what romance is, showing through actions that she matters.

If learning about relationships and attraction is something you're genuinely interested in, there's this AI learning app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that might be worth checking out. It's designed by Columbia grads and pulls from relationship psychology research, expert interviews, and books like the ones mentioned here. You can ask it to create a learning plan around something specific, like ""becoming a more thoughtful partner"" or ""understanding attachment styles in dating,"" and it generates personalised audio content at whatever depth you want, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The voice options are surprisingly good; some people go for the calm, conversational style while others prefer something more energetic. It covers a lot of the same relationship experts and research discussed here, plus you can pause mid-session to ask follow-up questions if something clicks. Worth exploring if this kind of psychology-backed self-improvement interests you.

Step 10: Say It Out Loud

This one's simple but brutal for a lot of guys. Tell her you love her. Tell her why. Don't assume she knows.

""I love how you never give up on things that matter to you"", or ""I love that you make me laugh even on shitty days."" These specific declarations of love are far more powerful than a generic ""love you too"" as you're heading out the door.

Words matter. Use them intentionally.

Romance isn't some mysterious art reserved for poets and Italian lovers. It's a skill. You can learn it, practice it, and get better at it. The key is consistency. Small actions, done repeatedly, compound into a relationship where she feels cherished, desired, and prioritised. That's the goal. That's what makes her fall harder.

I’m a woman in my late 20s, recently diagnosed ADHD and likely autistic but waiting on my assessment. Me and my husband have been married for a while and were originally planning on staying childfree but now we have been considering having a child (we’d definitely be one and done). I’m wondering if anyone else has been similarly conflicted and what your thoughts and experiences are. 

For a long time I found the concept of having children too foreign and overwhelming to fully consider. Now that I understand I’m neurodivergent and am finally beginning to have a calm nervous system for the first time in my life I’m able to really consider my options. I find child psychology and parenting methods fascinating, and I work with kids, so I know a decent amount of related knowledge about what they need to thrive. Having a little one around who I can help learn how to be a person really appeals to me in a lot of ways. But I just need so. Much. Peace, quiet, and alone time. I’m confident I could be flexible enough to adjust if I needed to but I frequently find myself thinking that spending the amount of time I want to alone and the amount of time I want with my husband is like 95% of my time already. And in a way a child is just an addition to your family, it’s not the same as suddenly having to be on a coffee date with someone 24/7. I have a phenomenal relationship with my husband and I would love to go on the adventure of parenting with him, but I also genuinely don’t think having a lot less time and energy to spend with him would be worth having a child. He’s completely enough for me. 

How does anyone navigate this? I don’t feel like our family is missing anyone. But a calm home and relationship this solid is also the perfect environment to bring a child into, I think we would genuinely give them a great childhood. And I’m constantly wondering if I’m completely delulu even asking if I could handle motherhood when I find myself needing hours to just think and regulate and be by myself. I struuuuuuggle if I sleep less than 8 hours and noise and demands are my main triggers lol. Any insight? ",2,1768680194.0,AutismInWomen,1,1.0,False

Day 2 (336km|1000km) (3|4)

https://preview.redd.it/uen7a0zgtydg1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e834e32be510e20d2a1db5431982056db2a48fb9





I woke up feeling super refreshed and I jumped almost into my dress. Coffee, cereal, some fruit and onto the bike. It was 08:00 when I got into the saddle but I knew that I’d rather sleep longer and ride faster. Sleep deprivation is a huge performance killer for me. The day started with a 80km climb with increasing gradient towards  Wasserkuppe, a very famous hill that is known for its huge radar station, that was used for military surveillance of the then separated eastern part of Germany. Today it's a huge airfield for gliders. While the first 40ks felt like flying and I enjoyed being back on the routes of my youth, the first climb hit all riders quite hard. I met a group of riders at the beginning of the steeper section. They told me, that most of them cycled till Schweinfurt in the first day, but they didn’t roll in until 2am. The lady from the gas station, who asked me about other riders, apparently was very nice with them and allowed them to sleep directly inside the gas station. This kindness led to almost 40 people sleeping on the floor of this gas station. She's probably still telling her friends about these crazy cyclists. The group left Schweinfurt at 07am which meant that I was able to catch up an hour in just over 60km. But still this is not a race! The climb got very steep with up to 15% so the group fell to pieces very fast. I tried to pace myself and keep my power below 240 Watts if possible without tipping over. My smallest gear is 36-33, so we are riding on the edge here to tip over.  A mountain bike cassette would have been necessary for this in some segments.  Just after the first very steep climb followed a very scenic drive through the Rhön-national parc and a fast easy decent followed by a less steep climb up to the Wasserkuppe, so the mood was high up again at the top of the hill. This Mountain top was used for military surveillance on the DDR as it is high above its surroundings and very close to the former inner German border. The radome built for this purpose was the 5th checkpoint(414km). I enjoyed the warm but not hot weather for a short break with a Spezi (German mix of Coca-Cola and orange lemonade, best softdrink in the world!) before I rolled into an everlasting decent of almost 50km.

https://preview.redd.it/3yc9s15ltydg1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d243fc30c5702048283472c776cfc838dd85903

I didn‘t see any other riders so I popped in an audio book and rode on my own on flat roads with not a lot of traffic along the Werra valley. I felt a little lonely and was disappointed about missing the opportunity to meet up with the group of the first day. Besides that, I didn’t have any hard feelings at all. My legs still felt good, my mind was very positive, the bum a little sore and my knee startet itching a little. The nature around me was beautiful and yet I didn't see a challenge, that was unbearable for me in this ride. Before I got to the next checkpoint one more climb had to be passed. I underestimated this one with only 200m of vertical climbing and had to dig a little deeper than expected as it also got quite hot in the afternoon (32°C) I knew that fueling in these events is everything so i kept eating and eating. My stomach luckily is very resistant, so i do not have a problem with a eating a bag of Haribo directly followed by a Döner Kebap.

I had already planed to take a longer food brake at checkpoint 6 in Mühlhausen(km 543) and to arrange my night stay. Food worked fine, night stay was problematic. I checked the websites of some hotels at the town of Wernigerode, that I wanted to stay at but everything was booked solid. Yet I didn’t mention that this event happened on a nationwide extended weekend. The town I was aiming for is the center of a touristic region. One might think what I could expect on such days… I also was confident that I would be able to still tackle the next stage (95km and 1700m climb) up to Brocken, the second big hill on this journey before sundown. After finishing a solid plate of pasta I rode on without a hotel around 5pm. I passed an open bicycle shop and wondered if I needed anything. Confident in my bike with a questionable tire and only one spare tube I passed this opportunity. 

My bum felt worse at this point so I thought about also reapplying some charmoisse creme. I’m yet ashamed to write this down but I think this needs to be taken into account. I noticed that after the whole day of riding (217km!) I was wearing my bib short inside out(SQ Lab, black and white with a black pad, pretty thin, you can even see it if you zoom in on the picture with my legs on the mountain). Needless to say, that I adjusted this at the next opportunity but the damage was done. 

The following route was not very nice with more traffic than I am comfortable with and my head was mostly busy with thinking about my night stay without taking action. I was in the situation where I wanted to take kilometers of the clock regardless of other problems. Just before the climb up to Brocken started, I forced myself to stop and to not mount the bike again until I found a hotel as it was already 7pm. I called a lot of places in the designated town and gave up after 15… I was really not prepared to sleep outside, but I still felt good on my bike, so I looked further up the route. The next town with hotels along the route was Königsluther, just a “little” further, measured by looking at a map on my phone, and no vertical meters (as i thought). Two Hotels available, a nice lady immediately answered my call and offered me a room and the opportunity to leave the key in a doorsafe. Great :) 

While I was arranging this, one of my mates from the first day passed me and we went on together. This was a big motivational boost for me, because I had the opportunity to exchange some thoughts and experiences about the track we both took. He was also again riding a little slower than I would have if I was on my own which was very good, because like this I paced myself far below my threshold. We cycled into the foothills of the mountain, that started with a gracious gradient and I was super happy. The only thing, that was on my mind was the road ahead. 

The daylight started to vanish and we had to take a break to mount the lights and get out the reflective vests. After some ups and downs we reached Schierke at the foot of Brocken. From there on waited a climb of 8km with avg of 6% and 470vm. As soon as we hit that, my partner and I had to split up. He was getting slower and slower with every crank turn and I was still feeling fresh. We agreed, that we would meet up at the top but shortly after that he called and told me that he had to call it a day and that he wanted to sleep in the little village we just passed. I rolled up the hill and was surfing on an emotional high, because the hill felt a lot less steep than I expected. The scenery of the very special nature around this mountain and the almost gone daylight fading into darkness took its part to make this a climb I will hopefully not forget too soon.

I arrived at the top at 23:30, took some time to text my wife, get the stamp on my Brevet-Card and then prepared for the descent. Riding downhill is not my favourite, especially not in the darkness. My magicshine lamp has enough power to shine very bright, but I didn’t want to spend too much battery, as I was uncertain about the time that I would still be in the saddle.There is a reason why almost everybody started this journey with a dynamo and that is, that you do not want to lose trust in your light source. Not being confident, that your light will not switch off from one pedal stroke the next is incredibly stressful. While I felt super good, that this hills is not so steep while riding uphill, I was clutching on my brakeleavers. After about 10kms going down, I took another stop to put on my downjacket as with the darkness and the altitude temperature dropped to 9°C. Clothing was still the only thing, that I will not change on the next trip. 

Happy about my warm jacket and about another challenge overcome, i rolled on and saw the red light of another rider waddling ahead of me. I catched up and came to see my mate again. He told me he had massive knee pain and that up here it was too cold for him to sleep. He wanted to roll down to the next city and get some sleep there. He assured me, that even if riding slow, he would be able to make it and that I can ride on, which I did. 

Yet I didn't feel exhausted, but tired so I was keen on getting to my hotel. To this point I didn’t know for sure how far that was. After I passed Wernigerode at the foot of Brocken, I stopped to take off my downjacket and dared to look how far exactly I’d have to go. 50km. That's a bummer. Even with good speed, this ment at least 1h30min longer in the saddle. As there was no other option, nagging wouldn’t get me anywhere so I put on some guilty pleasure music and off I went. The terrain allowed a nice rolling at a pace above 30km/h and I think most of the time I spent calculating in my head, when I would reach my destination flying through the night. When I was not doing that, I thought about a hill that i saw on the routes profile and convinced myself that this hill of 200vm was just after my arrival, not before. Guess what. Königluther at Elm as it is fully called, is just after the Elm mountain, that I needed to pass to get there. The climb above this hill was probably the toughest challenge of the whole trip. I was tired, I was fed up because of my bad planing, I had to force myself to keep eating and I didn’t have any backup plan. The constant nagging in my head was probably the worst about it.

I reached my hotel at around 2:15, took a shower and jumped into bed. The big relief after two hours of riding on a low was worth it, I’d say.  Although the last kilometers were a lot harder than expected, I went to bed with another 380km and 4500m of climbing in the bank. I didn’t set an alarm because I knew, that the cutoff of 75 hours time would not be a problem.",3,1768680130.0,randonneuring,0,1.0,False

Also, I am looking for a therapist specialised in DID/OSDD that I can afford, but it is really difficult in my country and being unemployed. I just wanted some opinions. Should I keep looking? Or should I just try to calm down and forget all of this?

So... this is going to be a looong post... be warned.

I suspect I have OSDD or DID, but I have a lot of doubts.

Facts:

I'm 29 years old. I barely remember anything from my childhood. I was bullied every day in kindergarten, school and high school. I had anorexia when I was 14/15 and was hospitalised for 3 months in a room I wasn't allowed to leave except for visits. I had struggled with my ED since then (now I'm much better, don't worry). I was diagnosed with DP/DR in 2019 by a neurologist (after visiting loooots of doctors for years, I really don't remember when I had my first symptoms). Oh, and also I have a narcissistic father who has shouted A LOT since I have had memory and has always dismissed my feelings and problems (when I told him that I had DP/DR, he said that it is nothing to worry about!). And I don't remember him helping me in ANYTHING when I was in the worst moments of my ED. I can remember my mother helping me, but not him.

  
Things that have been happening recently:

My grandfather (whom I loved with all my heart and had more presence in my childhood than my father) died in June (when it happened, it was like I had lost a part of me, a part of my inner child). I had a big discussion with my father, one in which I even feared for my physical integrity because he towered over me (I'm 1.54 m) and shouted he wouldn't allow me to disrespect him... We haven't talked since September/October... And I live with him and my mother, so... it's been stressful since then, to put it mildly.

Well, after those wonderful events and the stress I already had because of my unemployment situation, something changed. I started having weird dreams (with micro-awakenings in which I didn't feel like myself) and a foggy memory (apart from the amnesia I have of my childhood and teenage years) of the past weeks, and have had lots of symptoms that I suspect are DID/OSDD... Okay, I will give you an example of how these days have been: Today I woke up and felt my body was different from yesterday, like, bigger and lighter? (Yeah, I know it sounds contradictory). I also felt my movements and posture were a bit different. Then, when I went to the bathroom (which I didn't recognise but, by logic, I recognised at the same time) and looked at my reflection in the mirror, I instantly thought ""Nox"" (which is the name of one of the alters I suspect I have). Also, later, when I was drinking my morning coffee (which I prepared with the same milk/coffee proportions as always), it tasted too bland for my taste. This reminded me that some years ago I liked my coffee strong, but one day I found myself unable to drink it (waaay too bitter); I didn't like it at all... I could go on and on with weird taste changes in clothes and food, and with weird attitude/perspective changes (even changes with the gender I identify with). In a nutshell, it is what a user of the OSDD Reddit commented in a post: Almost every day I feel like Doctor Who when he regenerates. I'm still 'me', but a different 'me'. The memories are there, but I don't feel I am the one who lived those moments.

The thing is that I almost have no interactions with alters; I'm not even sure if I am imagining them. So far, my 'interaction' has been mental images of the appearance of two of them and not voices, but, like, thoughts that I don't think are mine and appear from nowhere, without mental processing (if that makes sense?), but they have been very scarce. Most of the time, I just 'feel' they are there, like there's an occupied part in my mental space? And sometimes I know who is there by some kind of intuition. Following the advice of one of the videos of Dr Mike Lloyd, I tried to create a 'mental home' with a board to interact with them and put a post-it with a message introducing myself on it. That was 4 days ago. I left the 'mental home' for a while, and when I came back, I found more post-its of different colours on the board (I was surprised!). I wasn't able to read them, but two of my alters were there. I have had some interaction through that system with them and a Little (a version of me when I was 6 years old, I think) for a bit, but now that has changed. I haven't been able to go to the 'mental home' since yesterday (when I had my anxiety attack), it is like there is a black barrier that blocks me. Also, the night before THE anxiety attack, I had what I think was a very brief switching. I was in my room, coding, when I heard my father shouting (he was watching a football match), and, suddenly, I wasn't me; I was a kid full of fear, looking at the door, waiting for the worst. It lasted just some seconds, but I'm almost sure that in that moment I wasn't the one controlling my body and emotions...

I'm confused and anxious... I keep fearing that I'm faking everything, because, even if I feel all of this as real, I don't think I have amnesia in the present. Sure, my memory is foggy, but I keep doubting because I have almost no interaction with my supposed alters... My mind has been pure chaos for months now...

Any question/advice is welcome.

I'm a 30-something year old with long covid who moved here for work recently. I'm quite extroverted but have found it hard to socialize because all my old hobbies were very active (dancing, running, hiking) and I'm not healthy enough to engage in those right now. And reinfection makes me much sicker, so crowded indoor events aren't really doable for me at the moment either with all these winter viruses going around. These restrictions obviously make it hard to meet people. Surely I'm not the only one experiencing this!

Have you ever met someone, and by the end of that exchange you feel like you have known them for years? That was me (20 F) and my ex-bestie (21F) at the time. To make things easier, lets call her Jane.

Jane and I met through our husbands, who became friends a few months before we did. They bonded over a mutual passion and hubby kept telling me that I'd really like Jade, and thinks we'd be good friends. 

Jade had a baby girl and she was truly a sweet little angel. The friendship grew over the years to the point that Jade asked us to be her girl's godparents. I am Christian so I completely underwhelming weight of being a godparent.

Now Jade and her husband Rob (23M) at the time were not in the healthiest relationship. Whenever hubby and I visited them, Jade would complain about Rob and his controlling antics and I would sit there in full support.

Rob was the working parent and never let Jade forget it. He would often use working as an excuse for not doing any responsibilities at home. He'd come home, spend and hour in the bathroom, sit on the phone then go to sleep. He wouldn't help Jade with their girl at all nor with anything in the home. 

Now Rob wanted to move from where they were currently living but with being the only one earning an income, they couldn't afford to move. So Jade had to get a job. This is where things get more complicated. Jade did not have a driver's license because Rob refused to let her drive. He used to use her health as an excuse but I quickly realised it was just another control mechanism used to make her feel like she couldn't leave at the end of the day.

So Jade started looking for work and finally found a job right next door to where Rob worked. I used to work in a few shops down so it was an amazing way to spend lunch times.

Over time our friendship bond grew and hubby and I (dating at the time) got married and also started having marraige issues. so Jade and I would spend lunches together complaining. venting or even gushing over our SO's and just enjoying life together.

I completely understand that Jade and Rob weren't the happiest in the marraige but from what I was told, it was similar to mine and hubby's issues. However, I was mistaken.

Jade started telling me about her ex, we'll call him John. She said that John and his wife came to visit and that they all started growing closer in friendship as well. Apparently John never stopped loving Jade but because Jade fell in love with Rob and fell pregnant, they got married before baby girl was married and John missed his chances with her. John moved on and married Mary. (Marry later becomes very crucial).

So this version of the story occurs in a short period of time. I fell pregnant with our first baba and Jade was such a huge support. During this time things got messy. 

Jade started talking more about John and telling me they have been talking. John would visit with Marry and would spend time with their baby girl. Basically displaying more or a relationship with baby girl than Rob ever did. 

When she told me this, I got a sense that she viewed John as a better partner than Rob and started seeing Rob in the worst light possible. Now Rob wasn't a saint, however there were times he'd put in effort to make things work. as far as minipulation goes, he was working on it.

So, Jade often started talking about John more and more and the conversation started taking a very personal turn. She would tell me how John was better suited for her, how she and John planned on leaving their SO's so that they could be together. This went on for a few months and it got to the point where I was thinking ""emotional affair""

I didn't know what to do, and I even spoke to hubby thinking he might have a word of advice. After a serious discussion, hubby and I said we needed to talk to Rob and let him know, but before that I wanted to give Jade the opportunity to come clean.

Turns out, none of that was necessary!

I get a text at 5am from Jade panicking. The first one read ""She knows!"" followed by ""she's going to tell Rob."" and then. ""She's sent screenshots to Rob."" Now I was just a little while from giving birth so my sleep was very off and I was actually awake when these messages came through. 

I asked her to give me a call and we spoke on the phone for about an hour. I basically told her that unfortunately Marry had all the evidence she needed and even if Jade tried to delete the messages off of Rob's phone, Marry would just contact Rob anyway and tell him. So i told her she needs to prepare for the storm coming. I asked if she was serious about leaving Rob or if that was just fantasy talking. She said it was mostly fantasy but that a part of her would always want to leave him because of how little he thinks of her. 

So my advice? Be honest. Don't blame the situation on Rob and his lack of affection, and also don't be dishonest. When hubby woke up, I told him he might get a call from Rob, and I explained everything. 

Later on in the day, Jade and Rob ask to speak with us so we agree. We organize a coffee and they come over. Rob asks me how much Jade has told me about the situation and I was sincere in saying that I didn't want to get involved in their relationship, but that I was here for support if any of them needed. 

I took this entire situation to my pastor to ask for advice and he told me that they need counseling, soon. So I spoke to them and suggested they speak with my pastor (he is certified in trauma counseling, childhood counseling a d marital counseling so I thought it was the best thing on gaining sane perspective).

Rob told me that he would try, and so the next day they made an appointment and went. After their session. Jade messaged me and said that Rob doesn't want to go back and thinks it's a waste of time. However when I spoke to Rob I got a sense that it wasn't the case.

Turns out, Rob saw my pastor as a threat because he is a good looking man, single and a heart of pure gold, and Rob thinks that Jade would want to get with him. So, big trust issues here. Normally I'd say ""can't blame the guy after what he's been though."" But, dear potatoes...turns out you can.

A little while passes and we don't hear much from Rob and Jane. in this time, John and Marry get a divorce and both cut contact with Rob and Jane. I give birth to our wonderful son and a few weeks later invite Rob and Jane over to meet him. They come through and while hubby and Rob are outside talking, Jane and I are inside also talking. 

If you thought this was messy do far, get ready for a tornado.

Rob initiated an open relationship perspective not too long after their daughter was born, and so Jane never technically cheated. Rob just hated that people found out about Jane's relations and didnt want to admit to the open relationship out of embarrassment. It was to the point that they even had couples getaways with other's in similar situations.

Rob was jealous that Jade was getting attention, and didnt want her to be in an open relationship, bit he wanted to be in one because it was ""just spicy time"" and nothing more. And before Marry told Rob, he wanted to find out from hubby and I if we ever considered an open marraige.

When I say I gasped, I GASPED! Picture that meme where you could here the picture through the phone. That's how bad it was for me. I quickly and authoratively said it was never going to happen, regardless of what has happened in their relationship and I didnt appreciate marraige been viewed that way. Eventually they left, and I gold hubby EVERYTHING. HE. WAS. SPEECHLESS! 

After that night, communication dies down and I dont hear from Jade again until she contacts me one day to tell me they're getting a divorce. I tell her it's the healthiest thing for them as they're very toxic for one another. She started a new relationship, with a new feller named William, and is very content. 

Rob also started a new relationship with someone and they are now engaged.

1qfn0gk,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1qfn0gk/weird_customer_interaction/,Weird customer interaction,"This is a situation that happened a few weeks ago at my job. Working as a gas station cashier means that weird customer interactions aren't exactly uncommon, doubly so when you’re working the night shift. If you’re lucky you might have a coworker on your shift, but that’s never a guarantee. However, I have never had a customer interaction like this before, and I really hope I never have one like it ever again. Let me just explain what happened.  
  
The gas station where I work is pretty far from anything, it’s along a major highway, but whoever previously owned the rights must have been a good salesman to offload this store. We aren’t busy. Customers tend to come in waves, 20 minutes of chaos, and then dead, empty night for hours. The night of the incident was pretty normal, customers filtered in and out, buying snacks, scratchers, and coffee. There’s a certain kind of desperation that customers get around 1:00am, they know what they want, and they know you’re the only one that can give it to them. During the downtime you kind of drop your guard. You feel like you’ll never see another person again.  
  
It was during that downtime that my problem customer showed up. It was maybe 1:40am, and I had sold a dozen packs of cigarettes, some scratchers, and a cup of coffee to basically every customer. I had been sitting behind the counter, leafing through some car magazine I took off the shelf, trying to save the waning battery of my phone, when I heard something from outside the door. It was a thumping sound, almost a sensation that I could feel in my bones, Thump - Thump - Thump.  
  
I could tell whatever it was, was coming closer to the door. Through the yellow haze of the store I stared at the glass door hoping to catch a glimpse of whatever it was. I considered hiding behind the counter, but there was nothing to hide from. Just the inky blackness of the night, diluted only by the light of the gas pumps. I looked away from the door, hoping to see something on our cheap security camera. Nothing, just a haze of grey spots squirming like insects making out the shape of the pumps, no cars, no people, nothing out of the ordinary.  
  
The lights of the station flickered and the thumping sound became nearly painful, like my brain was actively resisting the sensation. That was when I saw it, half a dozen gnarled black hands reaching out from the closed door, pulling something massive behind them. The hands squeezed the frame of the door, cracking the glass and warping the metal frame. They moved further into the store, grasping at anything they could reach, pulling merchandise off the shelves, bending and warping whatever they touched, as though reality itself was repulsed by the thought of interacting with such a being. The entire store strained with each pulse of the entity’s flesh, and my mind along with it.  
  
The full extent of the mass had finally made its way into the store.  
  
The creature was immense, its size almost indeterminate, and the composition of its body constantly in flux. Its skin, if it even was that, was that same inky blackness of the night, almost intangible in the same way, but shiny, iridescent like a pool of oil. Its thin sinewy arms flailed around grasping the air, as though they had a mind of their own, but always, constantly bringing the creature closer to me. As it got closer I could see its face, in the centre of the mass. It consisted only of a slowly opening mouth, full of blunt crooked white teeth, strings of saliva forming as it stretched itself into a facsimile of a smile.

A sound came from the thing, my mind clearing as it did. The thumping sound was gone, replaced with a low rumble from its mouth. Not words, just a deep rasping noise. Then, the sound started changing, forming into words, maybe not that I could hear, but deep within my mind.  
  
“I NEED SMOKES, GIVE ME A PACK OF REDS”  
  
I stumbled back into the shelf, unable to fathom the request, we don’t stock the brand. I stumbled over my words but managed to reply, “We don’t sell Marlboro Reds … it’s- it's an American brand. Would you like Rooftop Fulls, they’re basically the same.”  
  
The customer responded, its voice now sounding like the gurgle of a boiling pot, “…FINE.”  
  
I unlocked the cigarette cabinet and retrieved a pack of darts, “It’ll be $21.00”

The customer grumbled something to himself, itself, as its hands turned inwards, reaching inside of its body and returning, holding a $100 bill. Three of the hands moved towards the counter dropping it in front of me. The other hands pulled a cigarette from the pack, lighting it in the creature’s mouth.  
  
“You can’t light that in here”  
  
The customer grumbled yet again. Then in the blink of an eye, began to vanish, its viscous, shimmery black flesh becoming papery thin, almost translucent as the lights of the store flickered, plunging the room into darkness.

In seconds the lights flickered back on. I looked around the store, half expecting the damage to be gone, but the store was just as the customer had left it, leaking bottles of motor oil, crushed snack cakes, and broken glass littered the floor. On the counter in front of me lay the customer’s payment, I picked it up and held it towards the light.

1qfn0f9,https://i.redd.it/ascyn4rdsydg1.jpeg,Vietnam Gov't approves plans to implement Viet Nam – Israel FTA,"The implementation roadmap … prioritizes boosting trade and investment promotion activities in Israel, promoting Viet Nam's investment climate and strategic advantages to Israeli firms. The initiatives are expected to expand bilateral trade, attract foreign investment into priority sectors, and bring Vietnamese goods closer to Israeli consumers and importers.

A core pillar of the plan is industry and enterprise competitiveness support, with programs tailored to micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), start-ups, and sectors directly affected by the FTA. The Government also calls for response measures for vulnerable industries, while encouraging stronger linkages between domestic firms and Israeli-invested enterprises to deepen integration into production networks and supply chains.

The plan seeks progress on the mutual recognition of conformity assessment results, enabling smoother regulatory compliance for exporters. It also supports Vietnamese producers in meeting Israel's market-specific standards, including Halal certification requirements, which are essential for certain consumer segments and import categories.

VIFTA was signed on July 25, 2023 and took effect on November 17, 2024, becoming Israel's first FTA with a Southeast Asian country and Viet Nam's first trade pact with a partner in the Middle East.

Under the agreement, Israel eliminates 66.3 percent of tariff lines immediately, while the remaining duties are being phased out over the following years. Viet Nam has also committed to removing the majority of its tariff lines, enhancing competitiveness for traded goods.

The FTA is creating broader opportunities for Vietnamese exports, including seafood, cashews, textiles, coffee, and pepper, while strengthening cooperation in services, investment, and high-tech industries.

Bilateral trade was projected to exceed US$3.7 billion in 2025, with Viet Nam's exports to Israel growing more than 10 percent year-on-year, reflecting rising momentum driven by tariff reforms and market engagement.

1qfmzhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtCrit/comments/1qfmzhs/pwp_art/,PWP art,"PwP Art: When Art Is Pointless, Worthless, Yet Priceless

We live in an era where a banana duct-taped to a wall is worth more than a teacher’s annual salary. Where a white line on a white canvas sparks deep philosophical debates. Where silence in a gallery drowns out the scream of meaninglessness, rebranded as an “artistic statement.” In this spirit, I’m introducing a new label for this phenomenon: PwP art – Pointless. Worthless. Priceless.

What Is PwP Art?

PwP art is art that is:

- Pointless – It lacks any clear purpose. Or perhaps it has so many meanings that they dissolve into a fog of interpretation.
- Worthless – Materially insignificant, often made from trash, randomness, or spilled paint.
- Priceless – And yet, it sells for millions. Because someone, somewhere, declared it “genius.”

Why PwP?

This isn’t an attack on art. It’s a way to name a trend that’s spun out of control. PwP art isn’t about aesthetics, craftsmanship, or message. It’s more of a test: how much are we willing to pay for something just because someone else says it has value?

PwP is a mirror. Not for the artist, but for us. For our desire to be exceptional, to understand the incomprehensible, to be part of “something bigger.” PwP art is like the emperor’s new clothes — and I’m the kid saying, “But it’s just a smudge on a canvas!”

How to Spot PwP Art

Here are some telltale signs:

- The description is longer than the artwork itself.
- Without a curator’s explanation, you’d think it was a mistake.
- The price is directly proportional to your confusion.
- The more you try to understand, the deeper you sink into nonsense.

PwP Isn’t Hate. It’s a Filter.

PwP art isn’t about what’s “bad” art. It’s a label for works that pretend to be profound but mostly make you ask: “Seriously?” It’s a way to keep your sanity in a sea of conceptual fog.

In Conclusion

PwP art is here. Whether it fascinates you, frustrates you, or makes you laugh, one thing is certain: sometimes art is so meaningless, worthless, and yet priceless that it deserves its own label.

So next time you see a blank canvas titled “The Silence of Existence”, or a sculpture made of crushed coffee cups called “Deconstructing Consumption”, remember: this is pure PwP.",1,1768679491.0,ArtCrit,1,1.0,False

For those of you who have never tried a winter ultra and are interested in a good one to start with, read on! Here is my review of the 2026 St Croix 40 Mile Winter Ultra:

The SC40 (St Croix 40) takes place in St Croix State Park, up near Hinckley, MN. It was my first winter ultra, but the whole idea of this race is that it gives you a good idea of what longer races, like Tuscobia, AH135, and beyond, are like. I live in MN, so I had a relatively strong group of people I knew who had done the race or other similar events and gave me advice; if you were one of them, I am very grateful for everything, I wouldn't have made it to the finish without it.

Unlike a normal trail race, there are no checkpoints where you can drop a bag, you have to carry everything with you, so for 95% of us, we pulled sleds (actually a pulk because it's a whole system with a harness and rigid poles to connect it, at least in my case). There is minimum gear required because if you have to stop, you must be able to survive in temps around zero degrees F, or below. This includes a sleeping bag, bivi, pad, water containers, food, stove, and kettle. I carried additional clothing to change out of if I overheated and sweat too much, or if I needed to add layers. I also carried enough water mixed with Tailwind in Nalgene bottles that were covered in some homemade insulated covers. Plenty of food as well. You also need blinky lights and a headlamp to last you all night. For those of you who have the UltrAspire Lumen 800, it lasted 11.5 hours in the cold no problem! Though I did bring extra lithium batteries for it just in case.

I started the race wearing a very light amount of clothing because temps were around like 15-20 degrees with a little breeze. I had running pants that breathe in the back, a very light merino baselayer, and a rain jacket. For shoes I wore the Altra Lone Peak Waterproof hiking shoes and some gaiters. Gloves were Outdoor Research down mittens. I wore the had that I got when I picked up my bib. Oh yeah, also had a neck gaiter.

The course is a two-loop snowmobile trail, plenty wide, and clearly marked. According to my Garmin watch, it had about 1050 feet of elevation gain.

The race started at 6 PM which is cool because I'm trying to get more experience running over night. You actually start in your bivi just before 6 and then at 6 PM sharp, you get out of your bivi, pack it up, and go! Most of us were power hiking the whole way, but I would run the downhills. At the halfway point, you have to prove you can light your stove and boil water; they give you water to boil, and you can fill up your water bottles, but that is the only thing they give you. I ate some of my soup and drank some coffee, after that, I felt great and was back out on the trail.

During the last lap, I had several issues ranging from aches and pains in my legs, lower back, feet, and probably others, normal trail/ultra stuff. I also had digestive issues for the first time in my running experience. That all said, I got to the finish line.

Here is what I learned:

1. Don’t stop moving. The best advice I got. The pain will go away, and the only way to the end is to just keep walking.

2. I didn’t like my shoe choice. The LP9’s don’t have enough cushion for me, I put a lot of miles on those before the race, but doubling my mileage yielded some different feelings at that distance.

3. Make sure your lights are secured properly, I lost one, and had to grab a spare from my bag, and forgot to preload it with batteries, doing that in the cold sucks.

4. Watch the weather closely because I way over-packed and I ended up with a heavy bulk.

5. Pull your sled to train, and before that, pull your tire! I need to make sure I load mine down more next year for training.

6. I need to figure out the back issue, I never had that happen, and it felt fine afterward, so I bet there is some strength training I can do to fix it.

7. DON’T EAT 10 ZEBRA CAKES IN FOUR HOURS, EVER. Yeah, that had to be the source of my digestive issues. Next year, I’m putting hot food in something insulated to eat on the trail.

8. My water didn’t freeze in the Nalgene’s with those homemade insulated containers, but I think I probably over-consumed my water, and because my nutrition was in it, I was sort of committed to it.

9. Figure out your gloves, at least for me, it’s the most challenging part of my body to regulate (temperature-wise).

10. If you’re used to longer races, you will not struggle with the endurance, but you might struggle with the gear. Practice getting out of your bivi, packing everything away, and putting it in your sled. Practice organizing your sled. Figure out how you’ll organize your sled, what bags you’ll use, where things will be, and how you’ll access it during your race. Practice your water boil. Practice practice practice!

I loved this event, and I cannot wait to try another winter ultra next year.

It can elevate a dish from bland to brilliant with just a sprinkle. However, as we become more health-conscious and aware of the effects of excessive sodium on our bodies, many of us are seeking ways to reduce our salt intake without sacrificing taste. The good news is that we can create vibrant, flavorful meals with less salt by employing a few clever techniques and flavor-enhancing alternatives.

Let’s embark on a culinary journey to discover how we can cook with less salt while still tantalizing our taste buds.

# Understanding the Role of Salt in Cooking



Salt does more than just add flavor; it also plays a crucial role in the cooking process. It enhances the natural flavors of ingredients, balances sweetness, and can even improve the texture of certain foods. When we season with salt, we typically think of it as a finishing touch or a basic necessity, but its impact is much broader.

So how do we replicate that magic without relying heavily on sodium? It starts with understanding flavor and how to build it.

To replace salt, we need to focus on the fundamentals of flavor. The five basic tastes—sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami—can help guide us in creating delicious dishes that are low in sodium.

**Sweetness** can come from natural sources like fruits, honey, or even vegetables like carrots and sweet potatoes. These ingredients not only add depth but also create a sense of satisfaction.

**Sourness** adds brightness and can be introduced through citrus juices, vinegar, or fermented foods. Think about how a squeeze of lemon on a dish can brighten the flavors and reduce the need for salt.

**Bitterness** can provide complexity and balance. Ingredients like arugula, kale, or coffee can introduce nuanced flavors that enhance our meals.

**Umami**, often described as savory or meaty, can be found in mushrooms, tomatoes, aged cheeses, and soy sauce. Incorporating these elements can create a satisfying depth, making it easier to cut back on salt.



# Fresh Herbs and Spices: Our Flavor Allies



One of the best ways to infuse dishes with flavor without adding salt is through the use of fresh herbs and spices. They can transform a simple meal into something extraordinary.

When we think of herbs, we might first consider basil, parsley, or cilantro. These fresh additions can brighten up a dish, adding a burst of flavor that can easily compensate for reduced salt levels. For instance, a sprinkle of fresh cilantro over a spicy salsa can make the dish feel complete, even if we’ve held back on salt.

Spices like cumin, paprika, and coriander can also enhance flavors without adding sodium. They offer warmth and richness, creating layers of taste that bring our dishes to life. Don’t be afraid to experiment with spice blends; they can be a great way to introduce new flavors and make our meals exciting.



# The Power of Acidity



Acidity is our secret weapon in cooking with less salt. A splash of vinegar or a squeeze of lemon can elevate flavors in a way that replaces the need for salt. The bright, tangy notes of citrus or vinegar can cut through richness, providing balance and stimulating our taste buds.

For example, consider a simple roasted vegetable dish. Instead of relying solely on salt for flavor, we can toss our veggies with olive oil, a bit of balsamic vinegar, and a handful of fresh thyme before roasting. The result is a dish that sings with flavor, showcasing the natural sweetness of the vegetables without overwhelming them with sodium.



# Cooking Techniques That Enhance Flavor



The methods we use to cook our food can also impact flavor. Techniques such as roasting, grilling, and sautéing can help develop deeper tastes and aromas.

Roasting vegetables caramelizes their natural sugars, creating a depth of flavor that can be incredibly satisfying. When we roast Brussels sprouts, for example, the high heat brings out a nutty sweetness that can easily overshadow the need for salt.

Grilling, too, imparts a smoky flavor that can enhance our dishes. Just think of how a grilled peach or pineapple can transform a dessert, adding a sweet and smoky element that feels indulgent without requiring extra salt.



# Incorporating Flavorful Broths and Stocks



Using homemade stocks or broths can be another fantastic way to boost flavor while keeping sodium levels in check. When we make our own broth, we can control the amount of salt that goes in, allowing us to create a rich, flavorful base for soups, stews, and sauces.

Instead of reaching for a store-bought stock that may be high in sodium, we can simmer bones, vegetables, and herbs for hours to extract deep flavors. This simple act not only enhances our dishes but also provides a comforting and nourishing element to our cooking.



# Flavor Pairings That Work Wonders



Sometimes, the right combination of flavors can do wonders for our meals. Pairing certain ingredients can amplify taste without relying on salt. For instance, the sweetness of roasted carrots pairs beautifully with the earthiness of cumin, creating a dish that is satisfying and flavorful.

We can also experiment with contrasting flavors. A rich, creamy dish can benefit from a touch of acidity, while a spicy dish might be complemented by something sweet. By understanding how flavors interact, we can create balanced dishes that feel complete, even when we’ve reduced salt.



# Experimenting with Fermented Foods



Fermented foods are not just trendy; they also pack a flavor punch that can help us cut back on salt. Foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, and miso not only provide a wonderful umami flavor but also offer health benefits due to their probiotic content.

Incorporating a spoonful of miso into a dressing can create a savory depth that enhances salads or marinades. Similarly, a dollop of kimchi can add a spicy, tangy kick to a bowl of rice, making it feel indulgent and complex without needing extra salt.



# Mindful Seasoning



As we explore cooking with less salt, it’s important to be mindful of how we season our food. Instead of adding salt at the beginning of the cooking process, we can hold off and taste as we go. This approach allows us to gauge the natural flavors of our ingredients and adjust accordingly.

At the end of cooking, we can add a pinch of salt if needed, but often, we might find that the depth of flavor we've created through other means is sufficient. This practice not only helps us reduce sodium but also trains our palates to appreciate the natural flavors in our food.



# Embracing the Journey



Cooking with less salt is not just a dietary change; it’s an exciting culinary adventure. As we explore different flavors, techniques, and ingredients, we discover new ways to create delicious meals that nourish our bodies and satisfy our cravings.

It’s important to remember that cooking is a personal journey. We each have our own tastes and preferences, and what works for one person may not work for another. The key is to experiment, taste, and adjust as we go along.

So, the next time we step into the kitchen, let’s embrace the challenge of cooking with less salt. With the right techniques and a little creativity, we can create meals that are bursting with flavor and make our taste buds dance. By focusing on the building blocks of flavor, enhancing our dishes with herbs and spices, and experimenting with acidity and cooking methods, we can enjoy delicious, healthful meals without the guilt of excess sodium.

As we continue on this flavorful journey, let’s remember that cooking is all about creativity and joy. So, let’s roll up our sleeves, gather our ingredients, and get cooking—without the salt!",1,1768678981.0,u_recipe2kitchen,0,1.0,False
1qfmrjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qfmrjz/aitah_for_providing_raw_feedback_to_hotel_telling/,AITAH for providing raw feedback to hotel?  Telling GM he is not suited to his role?,"I should preface this by saying that I am a hotel professional, and have managed hotels from select-service to full-service under a particular brand for the better part of 8 years.  I am trying to move into consultation, specializing in customer service theory and operations.  My recent work ended in September, so I'm currently unemployed, but worked constantly in hotel management for at least 8 years.  Recently, one of my previous hotels sold and changed management companies.  The hotel had been mismanaged under its previous company, and was a terrible dump.  2/3 elevators out of order, torn carpets, dirty rooms, every coffee maker broken, draught beer served flat, exterior doors were largely out of order, preventing entrance through many of them, etc.  This was a full-service, suburban hotel.  I stayed there as a full-rate paying guest to experience it before the full transition which has been announced to see how awful it was on its precipice and set a baseline for its journey in renovation (full disclosure, I'm a huge hotel nerd.  I love hotels, especially their ties to cultural Americana and response to changing trends).

Anyways, after the stay, I was provided a brand-standard survey.  I replied honestly, as a full-rate paying guest, that the hotel was, in my opinion, worth 3/10 on the ranking scale (which will lower their overall score, but with guests how they are, I can't imagine it being that good to begin with), and provided feedback about it.  It was all stated pretty straightforward without any ""flourishes."" The feedback was several paragraphs long (remember, this hotel was an absolute disaster), and one sentence of feedback in particular seemed to rub the manager of the hotel the completely wrong way.  In my paragraphs of feedback, I provided the following sentence:  ""The staff was nice but some seemed to be affected by drugs or alcohol.""  I didn't mention it further, before or after.

This was spurred by the fact that one of the staff was having trouble standing up, her eyes were droopy to the point that you were unable to make eye contact with her, and her speech was slurred.  It was my perception as a paying guest at ""first glance"" and was not stated with any sort of rudeness or authority (IMO).

I received a templated generic response from the GM.  Fine.  I would have been satisfied with that, honestly.  However, he also sent me a ""private"" email directly to my email address, saying that my claims about drug or alcohol use were unsubstantiated, baseless, badly perceived, etc, and could have been caused by a disability, medication to treat a disability, etc.

I agreed.  It could have been.  But again, it was only my perception as a guest that a substandard level of service was provided because one of the staff appeared intoxicated.  I received another reply, saying that my perception was not objective, again baseless, and that it would not be discussed further.  At this point, I was kind of enraged.  This GM clearly did not get it.  It wasn't anything about this staff member being intoxicated, it was about his response.

IMO, the need for feedback is intrinsic in a service business.  I wrote him back a final time, expressing that it was at his discretion to perform any followup to my feedback as manager of his business, but that as a paying guest in this case, I should have been thanked for my feedback, apologized to for the level of service I thought I received, and made to feel that my feedback was valuable, even if it was baseless, unsubstantiated, or without expert medical knowledge (lol, do you know how many sensational but baseless guest surveys I've received as a hotel manager in my days?  Guests can be absolutely whacky).  That's all he had to do.  What he decides to do in his hotel in response to my or any feedback is his decision as that hotel's manager.  But to tell a guest, with however much insight they may or may not have (I disclosed I was a manager at this hotel about 7 years ago), that their feedback was wrong infuriated me.

In my final response to him, I stated that it was my opinion that feedback must happen in a service business, and that if he doesn't welcome feedback not to ask for it, but this would be detrimental to the long-term success of the enterprise.  Of course, this brand automatically sends surveys to all guests not paying a discounted rate.  With this, I said perhaps he would be better off managing a business which is not a service business, because he needs to be able to accept feedback, thank the guest for their honesty, apologize, and move on with what he feels is appropriate from his end.

Idk, WITAH?  I guess on two counts:  Was it TA to point out the intoxication based on my inexpert perception only, and was it TA to tell the GM he seemed ill-equipped to handle a service business if he could not welcome feedback with his guests without pointing out why the guest could be incorrect?  I have a sense within me that I overstepped somehow, but I'm not sure how, or if I did.",1,1768678956.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

My 6 weeks recovery has been hell. I was readmitted to hopsital because of a strange fever 2 days after I left. I did a bunch of tests. Blood cultures, CT scan urinalysis and ultrasounds. Nothing really showed up but the broad spectrum antibiotics they had administered dropped my c reactive protein to normal levels and I was discharged. I the. Got another fever maybe a week later but I could tell I was getting a cold or something. I got more antibiotics just from my GP. I saw my cardiologist and surgeon after this for my check up and both of them were very happy with everything. 4 days ago I got another fever. It was low grade. It was 37.8C. I went to my normal GP who is back on holiday. He said the GP I saw didnt prescribe the right antibiotics and that penicillin isnt enough to get rid of hospital sinus infections (I was coughing and sniffing again by the time I saw this GP).  He gave me some crazy antibiotics that I am 5/6 days through with. Last night though I had another fever of 37.8. I messaged my GP and he said I shouldnt panic and keep in touch with him. Honestly I have had low grade fevers now since I left hospital. My mental health is taking a toll from this and I'm getting scared that something more sinister is developing. What do you guys think of this? I don't know what to do. I have been seeing my doctors and telling them. I'm just tired of this. I've had sleeping issues since I left hospital. I was there for 20 days and over christmas even just on antibiotics. They woke me up at 12 to change my IV antibioticsx and then at 2AM for bloodtests, and then at 5:30 for tea or coffee.

If its endocarditis I want to know now but its starting to feel like something that has to manifest until its already bad enough for more surgery. What do I even do? Its 10pm now in my country and I swear I can feel my little low grade fever coming back. Did anyone else struggle with this?

1qfmpdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1qfmpdb/5_underrated_ways_to_care_for_introverted_friends/,5 underrated ways to care for introverted friends (that extroverts miss ALL the time),"Let’s be honest, most advice online about “how to support an introvert” sounds like it’s written by someone who’s never had an actual conversation with one. It’s a mix of recycled clichés: “Give them space,” “Don't drag them to parties,” “Let them recharge.” Cool. But that’s just survival-level care.  



As someone who’s spent years researching social dynamics and introversion (and let’s be real, observing a LOT of friendships fall apart), this post breaks down how to actually nurture your introverted friend. Not patronize. Not tolerate. But support and connect in a way that deepens the friendship.  



This isn’t from TikTok therapists or influencers selling crystals on IG. This is real stuff, backed by psych research, deep-dive books, and some very underrated podcasts. If you often wonder why your introverted friend seems “distant” or “hard to read,” this might explain why, and what to do about it.  



Now, let’s upgrade your friend game:



\- Respect their social battery (but don’t ghost them for being quiet)

  \- Introverts aren’t avoiding you. They’re managing their energy. Dr. Marti Olsen Laney, in her book The Introvert Advantage, explains that introverts process stimulation differently, using a longer acetylcholine pathway in the brain. Meaning? They feel more from less.

  \- Instead of waiting for them to bail on plans, offer low-stimulation options ahead of time: “Hey, want to grab coffee and sit outside instead of going to that loud thing?”

  \- Don’t take “no” personally. Saying no to a thing doesn’t mean saying no to you.

  

\- Don’t pressure them to share, create space where they want to open up

  \- Research by Dr. Laurie Helgoe (author of Introvert Power) shows introverts need time to process before responding. Silence doesn’t mean disinterest, it means depth.

  \- Instead of rapid-fire questions, try curiosity with space: “I’m here when you feel like talking about it. No rush.” Watch how that builds trust faster than any deep convo you try to force.

  \- Podcast alert: The Ezra Klein Show's episode on “Why You Should Pay Attention to What You’re Not Saying” nails this. Listening is intimacy.



\- Be mindful of text vs. call dynamics

  \- According to a 2020 Pew Research study, over 65% of introverts prefer texting over calling because it gives them time to formulate responses, reducing social fatigue.

  \- Rule of thumb: unless it’s urgent or emotionally heavy, text first. Give them the option to mentally prep.

  \- If you must call: lead with “Got a few mins to talk?” instead of just launching into conversation. That micro-consideration makes a big difference.



\- Show up in 1-on-1 settings, that’s where they shine

  \- In Susan Cain’s Quiet, she explains that introverts thrive in environments with controlled stimulation, like deep one-on-one convos or small groups.

  \- Group hangs might exhaust them. But one coffee date where you talk about the meaning of life? That’s where the magic happens.

  \- Invite them to those settings more. Not with “let’s catch up!!!” energy, but with real intimacy. “I was thinking about that convo we had last month. Wanna pick it back up over tea soon?”



\- Appreciate their way of caring, it’s not loud, but it’s real

  \- Introverts often show love through intentional gestures: remembering your favorite snack, sending a thoughtful article, checking in when it matters.

  \- Just because they’re not flooding your DMs or hyping you up in public doesn’t mean they don’t care.

  \- A 2023 Harvard Business Review article on workplace dynamics noted that introverted workers often go unrecognized because their empathy is quiet. Same applies to friendships.



Most of this boils down to this: stop trying to make introverts act like extroverts. Start seeing how their quiet is intentional, not a flaw. They’re not trying to be hard to read. They just experience the world, and friendship, more slowly, more deeply, and way more intentionally.



Care for them the way they care for you: with presence, patience, and attention.  



They notice. Even when they don’t say it.

In our contemporary world, if steel has been freshly ground, sanded, or polished, it will form an oxide layer on its surface when heated. As the temperature of the steel is increased, the thickness of the iron oxide will also increase. Although iron oxide is not normally transparent, such thin layers do allow light to pass through, reflecting off both the upper and lower surfaces of the layer. This causes a phenomenon called thin-film interference, which produces colors on the surface. As the thickness of this layer increases with temperature, it causes the colors to change from a very light yellow, to brown, then purple, then blue. These colors appear at very precise temperatures, and provide the blacksmith with a very accurate gauge for measuring the temperature. The various colors, their corresponding temperatures, in others words, they’d be riding around in bright steel armour that stunningly refracts every color in magenta-cyan-chrome-yellow hued rainbow of crinkling laser-cut and machine-aided handmade steel armor backed with carbon fibred studded leather suede in a multitude of deep, vibrant dyed colors, -from the Kings future.

\### Chapter 1: The Anomaly

Seattle, January 2026.

Elias Crowe sat alone in the small, cluttered apartment that smelled of instant coffee and old books. Rain streaked the single window overlooking Puget Sound, turning the city lights into blurred halos. On the coffee table in front of him lay an object that should not—could not—exist in this timeline.

A copper coin, Roman, minted in 1490 under Pope Innocent VIII. Perfectly preserved, edges still sharp, the profile of the pope crisp as the day it left the die. Elias had bought it two weeks ago from a reputable antiquities dealer in Rome for an absurd sum. He had paid in cash, worn gloves, and spoken to no one about it.

Because he knew exactly where it had come from.

He turned the coin over in his fingers, feeling the familiar tingle at the base of his skull—the same sensation he’d had since childhood whenever he pushed something backward. It had started small: a marble vanishing from his palm in 1998 and reappearing in a 19th-century shipwreck off Cape Cod. A Polaroid photo of his dog slipping out of 2005 and turning up in a Gettysburg battlefield archive, dated 1863.

He had spent his life hiding it. Testing limits in secret. The rule was absolute: matter only. Never living things. Never himself. And always one direction—backward. The further back, the more it",1,1768678746.0,stories,0,1.0,False
1qfmn4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheImprovementRoom/comments/1qfmn4h/i_deleted_every_app_from_my_phone_for_60_days_and/,I deleted every app from my phone for 60 days and my brain completely healed,"I was picking up my phone 400 times a day and didn’t even realize I was doing it.

My phone was the first thing I touched when I woke up and the last thing I looked at before sleep. In between I was checking it constantly, compulsively, automatically. Every notification, every buzz, every moment of boredom was an excuse to unlock my screen.

Screen time showed 9 hours and 23 minutes average daily usage. That’s more than a full time job spent staring at a 6 inch screen. That’s 65 hours per week. That’s 3,380 hours per year of my life absorbed by apps designed to be addictive.

I was 26 years old and I couldn’t go to the bathroom without bringing my phone. Couldn’t eat a meal without scrolling. Couldn’t wait in line for 30 seconds without unlocking my screen. Couldn’t sit in silence for even a minute without reaching for it.

My brain had been completely hijacked. Every spare moment was filled with digital input. Waiting for coffee, scrolling Instagram. Walking to my car, watching TikToks. Sitting on the couch, browsing Reddit. Lying in bed, endless YouTube. My mind never had a second of rest.

I wasn’t present for anything in my life. I’d be having dinner with someone and checking my phone under the table. I’d be watching a movie and scrolling through half of it. I’d be at the gym and spending more time on my phone between sets than actually working out.

My attention span was obliterated. I couldn’t read more than two paragraphs without getting distracted. Couldn’t focus on work for more than 5 minutes without checking something. Couldn’t have a conversation without my mind wandering to what I wanted to look at on my phone.

The phone had become a reflex. I’d unlock it without even thinking, scroll for 20 minutes, close it, then immediately unlock it again. My hand would reach for my pocket hundreds of times per day on autopilot. I was a slave to a piece of glass and aluminum.

I’d tried to use my phone less dozens of times. Deleted apps and reinstalled them the same day. Set screen time limits and ignored them within hours. Moved apps to folders and just learned to find them there. Nothing worked because I was treating an addiction like a bad habit.

Then I realized you can’t moderate an addiction. You can’t use cocaine responsibly when you’re addicted to cocaine. Same thing with a phone when every app is engineered to be as addictive as possible.

So I made a decision that terrified me: delete absolutely everything from my phone for 60 days and turn it into a brick that can only make calls and texts.

No apps, no browser access, no escape routes. Just a phone that makes phone calls like it’s 2005.

It felt like cutting off a limb but it saved my brain.

\## What I actually did

\*\*Deleted literally every app \*\*

Day one I deleted everything. Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, Snapchat, Facebook, Discord, every social media app. Then games, news apps, entertainment apps, shopping apps, delivery apps, weather apps, everything.

What remained: Phone app, Messages, nothing else. Not even a browser. Deleted Safari and Chrome so I couldn’t access anything through web either.

My smartphone became a device that could make calls and send texts. That’s it. A $1000 brick.

\*\*Set up complete blocking as backup\*\*

I knew myself. I knew I’d try to reinstall apps when urges hit. So I needed external enforcement.

Found this app called Reload on Reddit right before deleting Reddit. It creates structured 60 day plans and has blocking features that work at the network level. Installed it and set it to block app downloads and all websites 24/7.

That way even if I got desperate and tried to reinstall something or use a browser, it wouldn’t work. I’d locked myself out completely.

The app also built me a complete structured plan for what to do with all the free time I’d have without my phone. Sleep schedule, workouts, reading time, skill development, everything mapped out day by day.

\*\*Removed it from my bedroom entirely\*\*

Started leaving my phone in the kitchen overnight on a charger. It was not allowed in my bedroom at all.

No more waking up and immediately checking it. No more scrolling in bed for an hour before sleep. No more keeping it on my nightstand. My bedroom became a completely phone free zone.

\*\*Kept it in my bag during the day \*\*

Instead of in my pocket where I could compulsively check it every 30 seconds, I put my phone in my bag. If someone called I’d hear it and could answer. But I couldn’t mindlessly unlock it every few minutes.

That physical distance was huge. Out of sight, out of mind. The compulsion to check it decreased dramatically when I couldn’t feel it in my pocket.

\*\*Got a watch for time\*\*

Realized I’d been using “checking the time” as an excuse to unlock my phone and then scroll for 20 minutes. Bought a cheap watch so I could see the time without touching my phone.

\*\*Told people I was unreachable except by call or text\*\*

Let my friends and family know I deleted everything and could only be reached by actual phone call or text message. Most people were confused. Some were supportive. I didn’t care, I needed to do this.

\-----

\## DAY 1-3: Pure panic and withdrawal

The first three days I felt like I was dying. My hand reached for my phone probably 500 times and there was nothing to do on it.

I’d unlock it out of habit, see just the phone and messages apps, feel this wave of anxiety and emptiness, lock it, put it back. Two minutes later I’d do it again. The compulsion was overwhelming.

Day 1 I picked up my phone 80+ times just to stare at my empty home screen. My brain was screaming for the dopamine hits it was used to getting from apps.

Day 2 was worse. I felt genuinely anxious and irritable. Physical withdrawal symptoms from phone addiction. Couldn’t focus on anything, felt restless, kept reaching for my phone every few seconds.

Day 3 I almost gave up. The urge to reinstall Instagram was so strong. Opened the app store and it was blocked. Tried to open Safari, blocked. I’d removed every escape route and trapped myself with the discomfort.

\-----

\## DAY 4-7: Boredom became unbearable

Days 4 through 7 I experienced boredom at a level I hadn’t felt in years. Without my phone to fill every gap, I had so much empty time and my brain didn’t know what to do with it.

Eating breakfast without scrolling felt weird. Just sitting there eating food and thinking. Waiting in line at the coffee shop without my phone felt uncomfortable. Just standing there existing.

Sitting on the toilet without Reddit was torture at first. Just sitting there doing nothing. My brain had been trained to need constant input and now there was just silence.

But I forced myself to sit with the boredom instead of finding other distractions. Just be bored. Let my mind wander. Think about things. Or think about nothing. Just exist.

Day 7, one week down. The worst week of my life in recent memory. But I’d made it seven full days without any apps.

\-----

\## DAY 8-14: My brain started adapting

Week two something started shifting. The constant compulsion to check my phone decreased from every 30 seconds to every few minutes.

I stopped reaching for it automatically. Would catch myself about to pull it out of my bag and remember there’s nothing on it anyway. The reflex was weakening.

I started being present during meals. Actually tasting food instead of mindlessly eating while scrolling. Noticing textures and flavors I’d been missing for years.

Conversations improved. I was actually listening to people instead of thinking about checking my phone. Making eye contact. Engaging fully. People noticed and commented that I seemed more attentive.

Day 10 I read for 45 minutes straight without getting distracted. First time in years I’d sustained focus on a book for that long.

Day 14, two weeks. The withdrawal anxiety had mostly passed. I still wanted my apps back but it wasn’t the desperate craving it had been.

\-----

\## DAY 15-30: Everything started changing

Weeks three and four my brain started functioning like it used to before smartphone addiction destroyed it.

My attention span was coming back. I could focus on work for 90 minutes without breaking concentration. Could read for an hour. Could watch a full movie without needing to check anything.

My sleep quality improved dramatically. Without scrolling before bed my brain could actually wind down. I’d read for 30 minutes, turn off the light, and fall asleep in 10 minutes instead of scrolling until 2am.

I was present for my life. Walking down the street actually looking around instead of staring at my phone. Noticing architecture, people, nature. The world became interesting again.

Boredom became peaceful instead of uncomfortable. Waiting in line, sitting on a bench, lying in bed before sleep, all these moments of nothing became restful instead of anxiety inducing.

Day 21, three weeks. I’d picked up my phone maybe 10 times that entire day, all to actually make calls or send texts. Not 400 times mindlessly checking apps.

Day 30, one month. Longest I’d gone without social media and apps since getting my first smartphone at 16. I felt like my brain was healing.

\-----

\## DAY 31-45: Complete transformation

Weeks five and six I became a different person. The phone addict I’d been for years was gone.

I could sit in complete silence comfortably. Could be alone with my thoughts without needing distraction. Could exist without constant external stimulation. My brain had remembered how to just be.

I was reading a book every 4-5 days. Finished 6 books in these two weeks. More than I’d read in the previous three years combined. My brain could engage with long form content again.

Real conversations became meaningful. I was fully present with people. Remembered details they told me. Asked followup questions. Connected as humans instead of being half present while thinking about my phone.

My productivity skyrocketed. Could do deep focused work for 3-4 hours without breaking. My output probably tripled just from being able to actually concentrate.

Day 40, someone asked if I wanted to follow them on Instagram. I said I don’t have Instagram. They looked confused. I said I deleted everything from my phone. They said “how do you survive?” I said “way better than before.”

\-----

\## DAY 46-60: Never going back

The last two weeks I knew I was never putting apps back on my phone. Maybe ever.

My phone sat in my bag most of the day. I’d check it maybe twice to see if I had any actual calls or texts. Otherwise it was irrelevant to my life.

My screen time average was 22 minutes per day. Down from 9+ hours. I’d reclaimed 8.5 hours of my life every single day. That’s 510 hours over 60 days. Over 21 full days of time I’d taken back.

I was present, focused, calm, productive. My relationships were better. My work was better. My life was better in literally every way.

Day 60, mission complete. Two months without any apps and I was never going back to being a phone zombie.

\-----

\## What actually changed in 60 days

\*\*My attention span completely recovered\*\*

I could read for hours. Focus on complex work for extended periods. Watch movies without distraction. Have deep conversations. My brain worked properly again.

\*\*I got 8.5 hours of my life back every day\*\*

Hours that used to disappear into mindless scrolling became time for reading, learning, building things, connecting with people, actually living.

\*\*My sleep quality transformed\*\*

Not scrolling before bed meant my brain could rest. I’d fall asleep fast, sleep deeply, wake up actually rested. Years of terrible sleep fixed by removing screens at night.

\*\*I became present for my actual life\*\*

No more experiencing things through a screen to post about them. Just experiencing them. Being there. Noticing details. Making memories instead of content.

\*\*My relationships became real\*\*

Actual conversations with full attention. Real connection. People said I seemed more engaged and present than I’d been in years.

\*\*My productivity tripled\*\*

Uninterrupted focus time meant I accomplished in 3 hours what used to take 10 hours of distracted attempts. My work output skyrocketed.

\*\*My anxiety disappeared\*\*

The constant low level anxiety from phone addiction was gone. No more FOMO. No more comparison. No more information overload. Just calm.

\*\*I remembered how to be bored\*\*

Boredom wasn’t something to immediately fix anymore. It was peaceful. Restful. Where thinking and creativity happen. I welcomed it.

\-----

\## The reality, the first month was brutal

Those first 30 days were genuinely one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. The withdrawal, the boredom, the compulsion, all of it was overwhelming.

I almost reinstalled apps probably 50 times. What stopped me was the blocking through Reload making it impossible, and seeing small improvements that motivated me to keep going.

The structure the app provided also gave me things to do with all my free time. Without that I probably would’ve just sat there suffering and given up.

\-----

\## If you’re addicted to your phone

Look at your screen time report right now. Don’t change anything, just look at the number. That’s how much of your life you’re giving to apps designed to addict you.

Delete everything. Not just social media, everything except essential communication and navigation. Make your smartphone a dumb phone.

Use blocking to enforce it. I used Reload which blocked app downloads and websites at the network level so I couldn’t cheat even when desperate.

Remove it from your bedroom. Charge it in another room. Your bedroom should be phone free.

Keep it in your bag during the day. Out of reach, out of mind. Break the constant checking reflex.

Sit with the boredom. Don’t replace phone addiction with other distractions. Let yourself be bored. Your brain needs rest.

Give it 60 days minimum. The first two weeks are withdrawal hell. Week three it gets manageable. By week eight you won’t want apps back.

Track what you do with the reclaimed time. Read, learn, build, connect. Use the hours you get back for things that actually matter.

\-----

\## Final thoughts

60 days ago I was checking my phone 400 times per day, spending 9+ hours staring at apps, completely enslaved to digital addiction. My attention was destroyed, my relationships were shallow, my life was passing by through a screen.

Now I use my phone maybe 20 minutes per day for actual calls and texts. I’ve read 15 books, tripled my productivity, rebuilt real relationships, reclaimed 500+ hours of my life, and my brain works properly again.

Two months without apps completely freed me from phone addiction.

Your phone isn’t connecting you to life, it’s disconnecting you from it. Every minute on apps is a minute not actually living.

Delete everything today. Make your smartphone dumb. Sit with the withdrawal. Reclaim your brain and your time.

The version of you without phone addiction is present, focused, calm, and actually living instead of just scrolling through life.

1qfmkel,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/1qfmkel/respect_for_my_therapist/,Respect for my therapist,"I had been debating getting evaluated for ADHD as an adult woman (in Canada, therapists don't diagnose here).

My therapist does think it's likely I do, but evaluation from a psychologist is about $1600. I had been talking to him, telling him I wasn't sure it was worth it because I wouldn't take medication anyway due to fears around it, and that would cost as much as 10 therapy sessions and I already can't afford as much as I'd like.

(I have nothing against others taking medication it's just not for me. I drink coffee but no alcohol even, I even don't like one of my migraine meds have emotional side effects, I dislike it as it makes me feel like something is making me not fully myself, like I lose agency. I hope to manage my ADHD symptom better other ways).

He talked to me addressing a lot of those fears and giving me perspective on possible benefits of medication.

I know that he has ADHD as he'd disclosed it early on. A couple weeks ago I asked if it was okay to ask a kind of invasive question, he said yes so I asked if he took medication for ADHD.

He told me no. *He actually sees it similar to me.*

Yet he was being so unbiased in discussing my fears and helping me figure out what I personally wanted.

I already respected him a lot, but once again my respect for him has grown.

Not to mention that his memory seems so good... He told me it was mostly life style management. Which has given me new motivation to try to be less of a disorganized mess.

I understand why he didn't initially tell me, because it might have biased me when I wasn't 100% sure if I wanted medication. But I'm also just impressed seeing it can be managed so well without it too.

I’m moving into a new place soon and living by myself for the first time, so I thought I’d ask for some help here. I’ll add a video walkthrough of the empty space so you can see what I’m working with.

1qfmjhm,https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/1qfmjhm/us_rn_14_yrs_experience_considering_a_move_to/,"US RN (14 yrs experience) considering a move to Victoria, BC - looking for honest perspectives on work, pay, and daily life","Hi everyone - I'm a U.S.-based RN with \~14 years of experience (periop background, ideally ambulatory/outpatient surgery), and I'm seriously considering relocating to Victoria, BC. I'd really appreciate hearing from nurses who currently work there (or recently have).

I'm looking for real, lived experience, not recruitment language, especially what daily life actually looks like on an RN salary.

A bit about me / why I'm considering Victoria

* \~14 years RN experience (periop / ambulatory surgery preferred), with a strong interest in optimization, logistics, and systems improvement in healthcare delivery
* I'm 40, single, and would be moving with my dog (well-trained rescue). I'm hoping to make friends through the hospital system and the hobbies I listed below, but I'm comfortable in solo situations while I establish relationships and settle in
* I'm relatively unencumbered: no property, no mortgage, no car loan etc
* Currently living in Manhattan near Central Park and The Met (Brooklyn and Queens before that, Long Island growing up) - so I'm very familiar with a high cost of living being a driving force in my budget
* I'm considering Victoria as a 3-5 year chapter, with potential interest in permanent residency if it proves to be a good fit
* I've traveled internationally extensively and solo, but I've never lived outside the U.S., which is something I've personally always been curious about. The current Canadian nursing shortage, expedited visa endorsements for RNs, combined with the absence of a language barrier has made this feel like a rare opportunity that may not come again.

To be transparent about a few other factors driving this consideration: I'm currently watching what's happening in U.S. healthcare, particularly in NYC - where even major unionized hospitals are engaged in prolonged bad-faith bargaining, unsafe staffing, and wage stagnation relative to rent, while spending extraordinary sums on short-term staffing. I'm not under the illusion that Canada is perfect or that nursing there is easy, but I'm trying to understand whether the trade-offs of lower pay in exchange for healthcare access, labor protections, and a more livable day-to-day environment are applicable to Canadian nursing as I understand it as an outsider.

I'm also thinking long-term. As a millennial aging alone in the U.S., the model of tying healthcare and security to employment feels increasingly risky. If I'm going to spend the next 20-30 years working in a complex healthcare system and paying taxes in the US or Canada, I want to understand how Canadian nurses experience concerns about healthcare, aging, and long-term stability.

I've read posts from a few years ago mentioning physician shortages and difficulty accessing primary care in Victoria. Is this still an issue? As someone who would be moving without an established healthcare network, I'd appreciate knowing what accessing care actually looks like for newcomers.

One important clarification: I'm not viewing Canada as ""America-lite"" or assuming U.S. norms carry over. I'd be moving as a foreign worker with professional qualifications into a sovereign country with its own culture, laws, and healthcare system. Part of why I'm asking these questions is because I *don't assume* the systems or experiences are the same. I'm trying to understand those differences honestly, from the perspective of nurses who live and work within Canada's publicly funded healthcare system who might potentially be my future colleagues and neighbors.

What I'm hoping to learn from Victoria nurses

Work & pay

* Rough hourly range you're actually at (especially with 10-15+ years experience). I've reviewed the public wage grids but I'm hoping for individual, real-world examples.
* Availability of OT, casual, or per-diem work if you want to supplement income. I'm already used to working FTE plus an additional 8-24 hours/month. I understand OT works differently in BC. Nearly every nurse I know in the states has a side hustle/2nd per diem nursing job (especially in NYC) how often are extra hours actually available versus needed to make ends meet?

Cost of living & affordability

* Are you able to live alone on a nurse's salary? For context, I currently live in a prewar(early 1900s) walkup in NYC - no washer/dryer or dishwasher, no doorman, no common spaces. Honestly, I'd love to have a dishwasher and laundry in-building if not in-unit in an apartment if possible. I don't need views of the bay or luxury amenities. I do however need it to accept a 22lb scruffy dog with an underbite.
* If you're a solo person in the city as a nurse or comparable salary: Do things feel financially tight month-to-month, or generally stable? Are you able to save and still do things like go to coffee shops and have brunch on the weekends? I once lived in a great neighborhood in Brooklyn, but couldn't afford to shop locally.  Are you able to have a few hobbies and travel occasionally, or do things feel tighter than that?
* Roughly what percentage of income goes to rent?
* How does the rental market work in Victoria? I've read that it's tight, but I rarely read the income levels and square footage where it becomes accessible, or whether newcomers typically need guarantors, credit history, or other barriers I should prepare for. For example brokers fees in NYC can be up to 15% of the yearly rent, and they don't do anything aside from show the unit. 
* Do hospitals offer any employee housing assistance or programs? Or temporary housing for new employees?

Lifestyle (this is the big immediate trade-off for me)

* Do you feel you have financial access to the places in your neighborhood? Do most employees live walking distance to the hospitals or do most drive/take public transportation, and what would you say the average commute time is? 
* How often do you travel, even short trips? Is living on the island a huge hurdle for you? My assumption is that the first few years I'll be busy exploring locally before I start thinking about international trips again. I did grow up on an island, but it's very dense and is connected to NYC via multiple routes, so I've never been fully separated from a large metropolitan area before. 
* What does a ""normal"" day off look like? I've visited both Victoria and Vancouver but I'm curious what life feels like when you're not a tourist visiting. Are groceries expensive, do you have options? Is there a lot of sprawl when doing your errands?

Car/transportation

I don't currently own a car; in NYC I'm dealing with alternate side parking (moving your car 2-4 times/week or paying $400-600 USD/month for a spot). Should I plan to move with a car, or is it realistic to arrive car-free and settle in for a few months before deciding? In the neighborhoods I'm looking at (Fairfield, Cook Street Village, Harris Green, James Bay), is parking problematic, expensive, or generally accessible if I do get a car later?

Activities & culture access

I'm hoping the exchange for NYC's museum/cultural access will be access to the outdoors in Victoria. I actively enjoy paddleboarding, rock climbing, snowboarding, hiking, pottery, kayaking and yoga. Are these financially accessible on a nurse's salary? What do memberships/gear/classes actually cost?

For those who are museum/gallery/culture nerds like me... where do you get your fix? Do you travel to Vancouver regularly? Seattle? What does that look like financially and logistically?

Neighborhood / living style

I've lived across three NYC boroughs for the last 14+ years, so this will already be a significant change for me in terms of population density. In order to absorb and adapt to the culture shock, I'm initially hoping to live somewhere walkable, near parks and/or water, quiet cafe/bookshop/pottery studio/yoga studio kind of neighborhood.

Areas I've been looking at: Fairfield, Cook Street Village, Harris Green, James Bay.

Very open to corrections or better suggestions. I currently live in a 750 sq ft one bedroom - it's a 4th floor walkup with no amenities, but it is rent stabilized.

I'm not looking for luxury-- just safe, calm, and livable, potentially without needing a car immediately.

Why I'm asking

I know nursing in Canada has real challenges, and I respect that. I'm trying to decide whether this move makes sense in practice, not just on paper or in idealized comparisons.

If you're a nurse in Victoria, especially if you've worked in both the U.S. and Canada. I'd really value your perspective.

Thanks in advance. I genuinely appreciate anyone willing to share their experience.

PGA nominations suggest *Weapons* and *F1* could play into this still, *F1* being an audience favorite with guaranteed tech nominations to support a Best Picture nomination. Hell, there’s a real shot that *Sorry, Baby* could get boosted into the 10 with Julia Roberts singing its praises at the Globes right before nomination voting began. Thankfully, if any of those films make it in, it would be a pleasant surprise. This has been a great year for films, particularly international films, and my guess is given how international the Academy has gotten, that non-English language films will continue to do incredibly well with #1 votes.

1qfmcsq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qfmcsq,Nate Buzz. A deep dive into his rhetoric. - A Case study.,"Hey everyone.   
  
I know we are primarily here to discuss TVD as a show. However, given that Nathaniel Buzolic (Kol) has become a major public figure using his platform for activism, I think it’s time to have a look at what he says.

This is a research piece based on posts and stories archived from December 2025 to present. You may build your own opinion based on this, or ignore it completely.  
But I feel strongly that I have to say something about this now.



A little something: I would be very thankful for every upvote on this post to increase its reach. Thank you in advance.



**1. Dehumanization of Palestinians**

Let us begin with how he talks about Gaza and its people.

On December 1st he posted a video in his story by the Israeli creator Alon Ohel \[1\], who was abducted on October 7th, 2023 until his release on October 13th, 2025. In the interview regarding his time as a hostage with the Israeli news network N12 (Channel 12) Ohel talks about a specific incident of sexual abuse when a Hamas terrorist.

Nathaniel’s comment underneath that video reads:   
“Another terrorist who sexual \[sic\] abused an Israeli hostage. Palestinians culture?”   
And yes, while hostages report of sexual violence, and this incident has a very high possibility of happening exactly like that, Nathaniel does not discuss it like that, he projects this crime onto all Palestinians. He explicitly questions if sexual violence is “Palestinian culture”, generalizing en entire ethnic group as inherent rapists.

He continues this trend by calling a march of Hamas terrorists walking through the ruins of the city a “(...) gay parade in Gaza” \[2\]. 

He also stated: “What the Palestinians have done, are doing and plan to do is evil. Pure evil. We must rebuke their messaging their ways and belief in jihad. (...) We must stand with Israel.” \[3\] Just in case, Jihad actually means just “Fight”, but it has been increasingly used by Islamists as a term for “fighting against/killing non-believers”. What Nathaniel does here is quite obvious if you give it a second glance; he is trying to connect Palestinians to their Hamas occupiers to spread apathy for these people and mix the terrorists and civilians together to make them seem like a homogeneous group. 

And there is more, for example: “All the Gazan had to do to achieve long lasting peace was to resist their own urge to be violent towards their Jewish neighbor.” \[4\]

By framing the conflict as an “urge to be violent,” he strips the Palestinians of political grievances and paints them as biologically and culturally savage.



**2. Disinformation: The “Scam”**

But Nathaniel not only denies the civilians innocence, no, he as well frequently denies the starving and suffering, as he proves in an Instagram story from December 5th, 2025 which shows a group of women at a food handout, his comment on that reads: “Calorie surplus” and below “I was in Gaza, most women I saw were overweight - It’s a scam.”



And while this can seem off-putting given the frequent news about the starving in Gaza it has an explanation.

The reality: This is a medical misconception. Humanitarian aid often consists of *high-energy*, *processed foods* because fresh produce is blocked and spoils easily. A diet high in sugar and cheap carbs leads to obesity and diabetes, even in a starving population. 

According to health data, over 20% of adults suffer from diabetes with another 30,841 women in Gaza at risk. Diabetes leads to being overweight later, especially if untreated.

Pointing to “overweight” women in a war zone as proof they are not suffering is not just unscientific; it is cruel.



**3. Islamophobia disguised as Theology**

On December 7th, 2025 he posted the following pasted on a picture of the Quran he was studying in his story: “Islam isn’t here to co-exist, it’s here to conquer and kill oppose faiths” \[sic\]

When asked in a Q&A “Why are u Islamophobic ?”, he deflects, giving the word a whole new meaning: “This word is a tool used by the Islamic world to silence any criticism we might have as Islam as a belief or the life of Mohammad.” \[5\] he goes on saying that every religion should be criticized, which is not wrong, but then he says “\[every religion should be criticized\] but in Islam you’re not allowed to. Why?"" Following this he starts listing the relationship between Mohammad and a six year old and that he married his own nephew. 

Fact Check: This highlights his lack of knowledge. Mohammad did not marry his nephew, he married his cousin (Zainab). As well, of course you can criticize Islam, there is no one stopping him from doing so.



What is crucial here, Nathaniel likes to cherry-pick the worst quotes from the Quran and show the worst news to his audience, it is what he does, it is what makes it easy for him to hate and justify his hate. Truth: Both books the Bible and the Quran contain verses that are absurd today, and while some interpret the Quran says all those who leave Islam deserve the death sentence, in the Bible God demands the Israelites not to spare the Canaanites, for example.   
  
This is what makes his content a campaign, he follows his own ideology, only discusses issues in other religions but Christianity and Judaism, he is actively fighting for the unjustified and cruel attacks by Israel's military against innocent civilians in Gaza in the name of humanity.



**4. The “Bad activist” Straw-man**

Nathaniel does not only resent Palestinians, but their supporters as well.   
He frequently attacks (western) supporters with false equivalencies:

Here’s what he says: “Pro Palestinian supporters are called hero’s when they boycott  Starbucks coffee but the same hero’s won’t boycott Hamas even after it killed 23 Palestinians and stole 92 fully loaded air trucks from people in need.” \[sic\] \[6\]. 

This is a logical fallacy. The vast majority of Pro-Palestinian activists (myself included) despise Hamas and their violence against civilians. Nathaniel refuses to engage with the actual arguments of activists, preferring to pretend we all support terrorism.



**Conclusion**

Nathaniel’s rhetoric is cut out to radicalize people. 

What hurts me personally, as a person that grew up in close relation to Christianity, is his understanding of this belief and that he truly believes that God could ever support hate.

For me, God and Jesus alike are merciful and loving of everybody. Christianity is a belief of love for one another and to bond together in shared faith and also, to welcome other religions. My upbringing has taught me to invite everyone in, be friends with people, who show you the same interest in connection, regardless of anyone’s faith. I hate to see Christianity presented like this. I hope this can come to an end. That Nathaniel can let go of his hate and embrace the love that comes with his belief.

This religion is not one to justify hate, nationalism and war.



One last thing, though.

As much as I despise his rhetoric, his understanding of what Christianity is and his idealistic beliefs, I do not support death threats against him, or anyone.   
No one, for having a belief, should be punished by or threatened with death. 

He can be punished enough when we take away his reach and his platforms. Nothing will be more effective against his campaign but to not even watch it.  
We need to stop idolizing him as “hot TV vampire” and recognize him as a course of hate speech.

Drop your link and I'll do yours free.","I've been pulling patterns from Google reviews for the past few weeks. Not reading them one by one, but finding what businesses actually miss.

Some things that made me go ""wait, what?""

The Hoxton Chicago charges $400/night for rooms where the L train literally shakes the walls. Fifteen reviews mention it. Zero soundproofing. Zero discount. Just... ignored.

Dalla Terra Wine Bar has one manager: ""the guy in a suit"", mentioned in 8 reviews as rude and dismissive. That's not a training issue. That's a personnel issue killing a 4.3-star business.

Wall Two 80 has customers saying ""best coffee in Balaclava"" 24 times. Their Google Business description? Generic. They're not using the exact language that drives local search.

PureGym Liverpool: broken AC for 30+ days, gym hitting 30 degrees, management ghosted members on timeline. People canceling memberships and writing 1-star reviews about being ignored.

Razza Pizza: people drive 45 minutes and call it ""life-changing."" But 12 reviews say burnt crusts at $30/pie. The messaging says ""artisan wood-fired."" The reviews says ""inconsistent execution."" That's a positioning-reality gap.

What I'm learning:

1. Voice of customer is sitting in plain sight

South Lake Chalet guests mention ""walkability to beach"" 22 times. It's not in their listing title. That's the primary decision factor and they're not leading with it.

2. Surface complaints hide the real opportunities

""This gym is crowded"" = ""not enough bench presses at peak hours"" (12 mentions)

""This hotel is loud"" = ""L train rooms need discount pricing""

The real insight is always one layer deeper.

3. Differentiation already exists in reviews

Snowy Owl Cafe: ""Authentic Peruvian empanadas"" mentioned 12x. That's differentiation in a saturated coffee market.

Barry's WeHo: Instructor playlist curation mentioned 15x. That's a specific competitive advantage, not just ""good music.""

Most businesses never extract these positioning anchors because they're reading for sentiment, not strategy.

Why I'm doing this:

I'm working on a system that pulls this intelligence from reviews automatically. Analyzed 11 businesses, 5,000+ reviews so far.

Workflow is automated, but I manually QA every report to make sure insights are actually useful (not just sentiment scores and quote dumps).

Trying to answer: What positioning should you lead with? What customer language should be in copy? What operational fix has highest ROI? What's the real reason customers choose competitors?

•Wedding hall “show-offs” from both genders, posting their photos with a caption that makes you cringe so hard you might cry. The goal is clearly to post the picture, but they don’t know how to make it career-relevant, so they just say anything.

•Don’t be surprised if you see your coworker who talks trash about someone day and night, suddenly clapping for them on LinkedIn.

Because hypocrisy is basically required for their own benefits.

•People paying pages to feature their photos and praise them, just for a few likes.

•A clueless manager who barely shows up to work, giving lectures about leadership and discipline.

•Get used to HR team photos where someone is pouring coffee for the team like: “We nailed the cool work culture!” and of course there has to be a giant Dunkin’ coffee box to complete the vibe.

•That guy who keeps turning your feed into political posts like it’s Facebook.

•HR on LinkedIn acting like they got promoted to “minister” level, only adding “elite” people, and you’re not allowed to message them privately and if that green “open to work” badge is showing? You’re rejected with zero discussion.

•Some people still have hope, posting real discussions and valuable articles… but all they get is: “Thanks for sharing, nice post, insightful post, well done” with 5 likes.

If you’re in the UK and don’t already have Monzo, this is one of the easiest bits of free money you’ll get.

What you get:

➡️ £5 instantly

➡️ No subscription

➡️ No catch

What you have to do (takes \\\~5 minutes):

	1.	Sign up using my link:

https://join.monzo.com/c/1ccz7579

	2.	Verify your ID (standard selfie + ID check)

	3.	Transfer as little as £1 into the account

	4.	Spend that £1 on anything:

	•	App Store

	•	eBay

	•	Amazon

	•	A coffee

	•	Anything that counts as a card payment

That’s it.

As soon as the £1 spend goes through, £5 drops into your Monzo instantly.

You can then:

	•	Withdraw it

	•	Transfer it out

	•	Keep the account (it’s actually a solid banking app)

I’m not spamming this, not selling anything, and not gaining anything beyond Monzo’s referral bonus — just trying to use my final referral before it expires.

If you were ever going to do one of these, this is probably the easiest.

1qfm7ls,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernDatingDoneRight/comments/1qfm7ls/the_psychology_of_spotting_red_flags_in_your/,The Psychology of Spotting RED FLAGS in Your Relationship (Science-Based Warning Signs),"honestly, i've been seeing this pattern everywhere lately. friends, coworkers, even that couple arguing in the coffee shop last week. people staying in relationships that are slowly destroying them, convincing themselves it's normal. i spent months diving into relationship psychology research, listening to experts like Esther Perel and John Gottman, reading clinical studies on attachment theory. what i found was pretty eye opening.

here's the thing. most unhealthy relationships don't start out terrible. they deteriorate gradually. you don't wake up one day in a toxic situation, you slide into it so slowly that your baseline for ""normal"" shifts without you noticing. the brain actually adapts to dysfunction when exposed to it consistently enough. wild right? but understanding the actual warning signs, backed by real research, can help you catch things before they become irreparable.

**the silent treatment as punishment**. this one's insidious because people think it's just needing space. but when someone deliberately withholds communication to punish you or manipulate your behavior, that's emotional abuse. dr. sue johnson talks about this extensively in her work on emotionally focused therapy. healthy partners say ""i need time to cool down, can we talk in an hour?"" unhealthy ones disappear for days to make you suffer. there's a massive difference.

**you're walking on eggshells constantly**. your nervous system shouldn't be in fight or flight mode around your partner. if you're constantly monitoring their mood, carefully choosing words to avoid setting them off, or feeling anxious about their reactions to normal things, something's broken. that hypervigilance? it's trauma response behavior. your body is literally telling you this environment isn't safe.

**they isolate you from other relationships**. starts subtle. little comments about your friends being ""bad influences"" or your family being ""too involved."" gradually escalates until you've distanced yourself from your support system. check out the book [why does he do that](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/289845/why-does-he-do-that-by-lundy-bancroft/) by lundy bancroft. this guy spent decades working with abusive men and the patterns he describes are chilling. isolation is always an early control tactic because it makes you dependent on them for all emotional needs and validation.

**you can't express needs without drama**. healthy relationships have space for both people's needs. you should be able to say ""hey, i need more quality time together"" or ""i'm feeling disconnected lately"" without it turning into a three hour fight where somehow you're the villain. if every attempt to communicate your feelings gets twisted into you being demanding, needy, or crazy, that's manipulation. therapist nedra glover tawwab covers this brilliantly in her work on boundaries.

**the apologies never lead to changed behavior**. apologies are cheap without action. if your partner repeatedly does hurtful things, apologizes, then does them again, the apology is just a reset button to maintain the cycle. real remorse includes genuine effort to change the behavior. otherwise it's just words to pacify you until next time.

**you've lost touch with who you are**. when you look in the mirror, do you recognize yourself? or have you molded yourself into whatever keeps the peace? unhealthy relationships often require you to suppress core parts of your identity. your interests, opinions, even personality get slowly eroded. you become a supporting character in someone else's story instead of the protagonist of your own.

**there's a constant scorecard**. ""i did this for you so you owe me that."" everything becomes transactional. healthy love is freely given, not tallied and weaponized later. if your relationship feels like you're constantly in debt or keeping score of who did what, that's not partnership, that's business negotiation.

**they refuse accountability**. nothing is ever their fault. they blame you, their childhood, their job, the weather. any criticism gets deflected or turned back on you. people who can't take responsibility for their actions can't grow or change. full stop.

**you've developed anxiety or depression symptoms**. your mental health is directly connected to your relational health. if you were relatively stable before this relationship and now you're having panic attacks, insomnia, or feeling depressed most days, your body is screaming that something's wrong. don't ignore that data.

**physical intimacy feels obligatory or coercive**. you should never feel pressured, guilted, or forced into physical contact. consent needs to be enthusiastic and ongoing. if you're having sex to avoid conflict or because you feel like you have to, not because you genuinely want to, that's a serious problem.

**future planning feels impossible**. you can't envision a future together that doesn't fill you with dread. or they actively avoid any discussion of commitment and next steps, keeping you in indefinite limbo. healthy relationships move forward. they evolve. if yours has been stuck in the same place for years with no growth, ask yourself why.

**your friends and family have concerns**. sometimes people outside the relationship see things more clearly than you do. if multiple trusted people in your life are expressing worry about how you're being treated, listen to them. they're not jealous or trying to interfere, they're watching someone they care about suffer.

look, neuroscience research shows our brains can actually become addicted to unhealthy relationship patterns. the intermittent reinforcement, occasional good moments mixed with bad, creates a powerful psychological bond similar to gambling addiction. that's why leaving feels impossible even when you logically know you should.

Some things that made me go ""wait, what?""

The Hoxton Chicago charges $400/night for rooms where the L train literally shakes the walls. Fifteen reviews mention it. Zero soundproofing. Zero discount. Just... ignored.

Dalla Terra Wine Bar has one manager: ""the guy in a suit"", mentioned in 8 reviews as rude and dismissive. That's not a training issue. That's a personnel issue killing a 4.3-star business.

Wall Two 80 has customers saying ""best coffee in Balaclava"" 24 times. Their Google Business description? Generic. They're not using the exact language that drives local search.

PureGym Liverpool: broken AC for 30+ days, gym hitting 30 degrees, management ghosted members on timeline. People canceling memberships and writing 1-star reviews about being ignored.

Razza Pizza: people drive 45 minutes and call it ""life-changing."" But 12 reviews say burnt crusts at $30/pie. The messaging says ""artisan wood-fired."" The reviews says ""inconsistent execution."" That's a positioning-reality gap.

I’m turning 20 in 5 days, officially not a teen anymore!

Instead of a party, I’m doing a few things that feel meaningful to me: feeding street animals, planting 20 trees in vacant areas, and ending the day with a small coffee meetup.

I’m inviting 6 strangers to a Cafe in Kolkata. We’ll have coffee (that is on me), talk about life and everything around it, laugh, think, and just exist together for a while. Don’t bring anything at all, if you*want* to, you can write a short letter, but that’s optional.

Since I’m posting this on a teen sub while aging out, please be 18-20 only. I am equally dividing 6 people into 3 men and 3 women. We were created together, as a whole, walking with everyone feels right. Also do not come with dating agenda in mind, I understand that we often associate dating with opposite gender, but there's more in the world than just dating and clinging to somebody.

As a small token of gratitude, I’ll bring my photo gear and take individual and group photos. I’ll get them printed and mailed to each of you as a memory.

**I SEE YOU SHOWER.**

I laughed, because the city is full of people who think a router name counts as personality.

That night, after I got out, I checked again out of dumb curiosity.

**NICE BLUE TOWEL.**

My towel was blue. Not “a lot of people own blue towels” blue—*my* faded, fraying, cheap blue. I stood there dripping, phone in my hand, and felt my apartment shrink around me.

Across from my living room window was another tower, close enough to see someone’s plants if they forgot to close their curtains. I walked to the glass and scanned the grid of windows.

That’s when I saw it: a tiny blinking light in one dark unit, two floors above mine. Blink. Pause. Blink. Like a device reminding itself it was alive.

I closed my blinds. All of them. I changed clothes in the dark, then sat on my couch with every light off, listening to pipes and elevators and my own breathing, waiting for the next joke.

Morning made me feel ridiculous. Sun on the counter. Normal noises. Normal city.

Then I checked the Wi‑Fi list again.

**WHY SO SHY?**

I didn’t move for a full ten seconds. The coffee machine hissed like it was the only thing brave enough to speak.

I tried logic first. Maybe it was a prank. Maybe someone guessed. Maybe I’d overreacted.

Then the blinking light returned across the gap, steady and patient, as if it had all day.

I called the front desk. “Can you tell me who’s in the unit facing mine across the street? There’s… a bright light.”

“We can’t access another building,” the receptionist said, already done with the conversation. “If you believe you’re being filmed, contact the police.”

“Filmed” sounded too dramatic out loud, but it fit too perfectly inside my head.

I spent the rest of the day moving like I was borrowing my own home. I kept away from windows. I avoided turning on lights. I caught myself stepping out of the shower and freezing, towel clutched like armor, listening for a sound that would confirm someone was there.

Nothing. That was the worst part.

At dusk I opened the blinds one inch, just enough to see the opposite building without giving it my whole life.

Blink. Pause. Blink.

I packed a bag without a plan. Laptop, chargers, clothes, documents. My hands didn’t shake until I reached for the blue towel. Taking it felt petty, like winning a point in a game I never agreed to play.

I left my key on the counter, because returning would require pretending this was temporary, and I didn’t want to pretend.

In the lobby, the security guard nodded like it was any other night.

“Everything okay?” he asked.

I almost said yes. Almost.

“No,” I said. “Someone’s watching my apartment from across the way. Their Wi‑Fi name is… threatening.”

His face changed—small, controlled, but real. “Come here.”

He walked me to the office and pulled up a camera view of the street-facing windows. You couldn’t see into apartments from this distance, but you could see patterns: curtains, lights, silhouettes.

He zoomed toward the opposite building. “Which side?”

I pointed.

He frowned. “That blinking? That’s not a TV.”

He called the police. Not as a favor—as a procedure.

Two officers arrived. The older one listened without smirking while I showed them the Wi‑Fi names on my screen. The younger one looked up at the buildings like he was trying to measure the distance with his eyes.

“You’re not the first person to report that side,” the older officer said, and my stomach turned in a new way. “Do you have a place you can stay tonight?”

“I’m going to a friend’s,” I said.

“Good. Don’t go back alone.”

I slept on my friend’s couch with my phone facedown and the bathroom door locked, even though it wasn’t my door.

The next day, I didn’t check the Wi‑Fi list. I deleted the network screen from my habits like ripping out a page.

On the third day, a detective called.

“We spoke to the other building’s management,” she said. “They let us into the unit you described.”

My throat went dry. “And?”

“In the window, behind blackout curtains, there was a camera on a tripod with a long lens. Pointed directly at your bathroom window line. There was also a small router broadcasting those names.”

I sat down hard, like my legs had been waiting for permission to quit.

“Did you find who did it?”

“Yes,” she said. “We did.”

I didn’t ask for details. I didn’t want to picture a face. I wanted the idea of a person to stay vague, like a monster you don’t give a name.

A week later I signed a lease in a different part of town. Lower floor. Interior courtyard. No building close enough to touch with my eyes.

On move-in day, I stood in my new bathroom and ran the shower just to prove I could. Steam gathered on the mirror. The sound filled the room in a simple, private way.

After, I dried off and—against my will—opened my Wi‑Fi list.

Normal names. Boring names. Someone’s dog. Someone’s last name. A router called “FBI VAN” that was too tired to be scary.

I put my phone down and hung my towel—still blue, still mine—on the rack in plain sight.

Then I closed the blinds anyway.

Not because I thought someone was watching.

Looking at the **last 45 seconds** (from 10:31:04 backwards):

📊 **Spike Analysis:**

I can identify **2 distinct spikes** in the last 45 seconds:

**Spike #1: Temperature Peak (around 10:30:08-16)**

* Peak: **17.0°C** (62.6°F)
* Duration: \~18 seconds at peak
* Then cooled down

**Spike #2: Humidity Surge (around 10:31:26-32)**

* Humidity jumped from **74% → 81%** in just 8 seconds! 📈
* Temperature also rose slightly from 16.3°C → 16.6°C
* Currently stabilizing at 81% humidity

**Pattern Summary:**

* First spike: Temperature hit 17.0°C and held
* Brief cooling period with dropping humidity (down to 68%)
* Second spike: Sharp humidity increase (+7% in seconds) with slight temp rise
* Now: Temperature cooling back to 16.2°C, humidity holding high at 80-81%

**What caused spike #2?** That rapid humidity surge suggests:

* Did you breathe on it again?
* Or bring something moist near it?

The humidity spike is quite dramatic! 💨💧

that where the say hot breath comes from

Jan 8

Exactly! 🎯 That's a perfect demonstration of why we say ""hot breath""!

**What your breath contains:**

* 💨 **Warm air** \- Your body temperature is \~37°C (98.6°F), so your exhaled breath is much warmer than the 16°C room
* 💧 **Moisture** \- Your lungs saturate the air with water vapor, making exhaled breath nearly 100% humidity
* 🌡️ **Heat energy** \- Warms up everything it touches

**What the sensor detected:**

* **Temperature spike:** Room temp 16°C → Brief spike to 17°C from your warm breath
* **Humidity surge:** 74% → 81% in just 8 seconds from the moisture in your breath

This is why:

* Glasses fog up when you breathe on them 👓
* You can see your breath on cold days ❄️
* Windows fog up from breathing in cars 🚗
* The phrase ""hot breath"" exists! 🔥

Your DHT11 just scientifically proved why breathing on someone's neck feels warm AND moist! The sensor caught both components perfectly. Great real-world physics demonstration! 🧪

Want to try any other experiments? 😄

it also a way to joke about some one having bad sytinky breath \]

Jan 8

😂 Ha! Yes, absolutely! ""Hot breath"" definitely has that double meaning - both the scientific fact AND the social nightmare!

**The polite science version:** ""Your breath contains warm, moist air at 37°C with high humidity...""

**The real-world version:** ""Dude, back up, your hot breath is killing me!"" 😷

The DHT11 can detect the temperature and humidity, but thankfully it can't measure the *smell* component! No ""stink sensor"" on this Arduino... yet. 😄

Though now I'm imagining an Arduino project: ""Bad Breath Detector 3000"" with an air quality sensor that makes the LED turn red and play an alarm when someone with coffee breath gets too close. That would be a hilarious (and slightly mean) Arduino project! 🚨☕

Want to build something like that, or should we stick to less embarrassing sensor experiments? 🤣

lol

Jan 8

😄 Right?!

I can already picture the product pitch:

*""Introducing the Breath-O-Meter™ - Now with RGB LED Warning System!""*

* 🟢 Green = You're good, fresh breath
* 🟡 Yellow = Grab a mint, buddy
* 🔴 Red = EMERGENCY - Step away from the sensor!
* 🚨 Flashing red = Call a dentist immediately

Tagline: ""Because sometimes friends don't tell you the truth... but Arduino will."" 💀

Okay, I'll stop roasting people's breath now! 😂

What's next - want to try something else with your Arduino setup, or shall I keep monitoring the DHT11 for more ""hot breath"" incidents? 🎤",1,1768677169.0,ClaudeAI,2,1.0,False

I’m in Tampa, working part-time (retail/gig stuff), but hours got cut last week due to slow season after holidays, so my next check isn’t until Friday and it’s only gonna be partial.

I have about $8 left in my account after paying what I could toward rent and electric (TECO bill is brutal this month with the heat running non-stop in this ""cold""). My gas tank is on fumes—I need to get to my shift tomorrow and a job interview Tuesday, or I’ll lose both. Plus, fridge is basically empty except some ramen and condiments; I haven’t eaten a real meal since yesterday.

$30 would cover enough gas to make it through the week (\~$20) and grab basics like bread, eggs, peanut butter, milk from Walmart or a dollar store (\~$10). It’s not much, but it’d keep me from walking miles in the cold or missing work.

I’m happy to pay it back double and throw in a coffee or whatever to show I’m legit. I’ve been trying to stretch everything, applied for more hours, but it’s just one of those rough spots.

If anyone can help even a few bucks via PayPal/CashApp, it’d mean a lot and get me through til payday. I’ll pay it forward when things stabilize.

The next day, I didn’t check the Wi‑Fi list. I deleted the network screen from my habits like ripping out a page.

On the third day, a detective called.

“We spoke to the other building’s management,” she said. “They let us into the unit you described.”

My throat went dry. “And?”

“In the window, behind blackout curtains, there was a camera on a tripod with a long lens. Pointed directly at your bathroom window line. There was also a small router broadcasting those names.”

I sat down hard, like my legs had been waiting for permission to quit.

“Did you find who did it?”

“Yes,” she said. “We did.”

I didn’t ask for details. I didn’t want to picture a face. I wanted the idea of a person to stay vague, like a monster you don’t give a name.

A week later I signed a lease in a different part of town. Lower floor. Interior courtyard. No building close enough to touch with my eyes.

On move-in day, I stood in my new bathroom and ran the shower just to prove I could. Steam gathered on the mirror. The sound filled the room in a simple, private way.

After, I dried off and—against my will—opened my Wi‑Fi list.

Normal names. Boring names. Someone’s dog. Someone’s last name. A router called “FBI VAN” that was too tired to be scary.

I put my phone down and hung my towel—still blue, still mine—on the rack in plain sight.

Then I closed the blinds anyway.

Not because I thought someone was watching.

1qflz81,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qflz81,"40[M4F] Maryland/Somewhere - Looking for a CF long-term partner – patience, cats, and good music required","Hi everyone! 

 I’m here looking for a long-term partner, someone to share life without kids. I just turned 40 a few months ago, living in rural Maryland, and I’m AuDHD (Autism + ADHD), so I’m upfront about needing patience, understanding, and clear communication. I value my downtime a lot, and sometimes I just need my own space, even though I love doing things and spending quality time with someone special.

A bit about me: I’m a cat dad, a coffee enthusiast, and a sneaker collector. I love concerts and music—pop punk, 80s/90s/00s hits, some modern rap/hip-hop, pop rap, alternative, indie pop, and lofi. Halloween is a favorite time of year, and I enjoy retro gaming, casual gaming, and playing board games with close friends. I even have a tattoo of my favorite game, Final Fantasy 8! I’m a big foodie, love curry, and can’t resist watching cooking competition shows. Lately, eating healthy with an 80/20 approach and staying active through exercise have become important parts of my life.

I’d describe myself as thoughtful, loyal, and a little sarcastic in the best way. I enjoy quiet nights at home, meaningful conversations, and a good laugh.

I’m looking for someone genuine, kind, and down-to-earth, who values honesty and communication. Bonus points if you love cats, music, gaming, board games, or can appreciate a good pun.

If this resonates with you, I’d love to hear from you. Patience is key, thanks.",1,1768677096.0,cf4cf,0,0.67,False

This will be a little long, because I appreciate reading detailed reviews and hope someone else will, too.

Overall, this was a wonderful cruise and I don’t have any huge complaints. We are a family of 4 (adults mid-40s, twin kids age 13)

Parking—we parked in the lot at San Pedro Cruise Terminal. $161 for the week. We were very close to the cruise terminal, parking was easy. We stayed at the DoubleTree the night before and they do offer parking and a shuttle, but we knew that we wanted to go straight home on disembarkation day. On disembarkation day we were in the car at 8:00 and able to hop right on the freeway. I’m glad we didn’t have to wait for a shuttle.

Boarding—I was very happy I paid the $10 to have medallions shipped beforehand. The Green line was about 30 minutes to get onto the ship and the Blue line was long; I heard it took about 2 hours for some people! We did get there at 10:30ish for 11:00-2:00 boarding.

Stateroom—we had a deluxe balcony on deck 9, midship, starboard side. We are a family of 4. The deluxe balcony has a sofa bed and the pullman bed comes out of the ceiling over the sofa bed. This was tight but it worked for us. A regular balcony for 4 requires the pullman beds to come out of the ceiling over the main bed—no thanks. Mini suite would be great but it was around $1000 more and we did this cruise on the cheap.

Ship—was fine? I didn’t notice some of the smell issues others had, although the casino smoke was overwhelming. I did not like the layout of this ship at all. Not enough public spaces overlooking the water; some of the prime spots on deck 7 were almost completely obstructed by lifeboats. I was constantly confused and losing my way. I see so many people say they love the Royal class ships but I’m not sure why…and I definitely wouldn’t take one on an Alaska cruise! Now, the only ship I have to compare to is HAL’s Koningsdam, and I was really missing the Crows Nest and covered pool. It was really windy on the 2 sea days back and there weren’t really good public areas to be looking at the water. And library! The Royal library and game collection was small and sad. Activities staff was great; we loved the trivia and game shows. The singing/dancing shows were not for us. Ship was over 100% capacity at more than 3800 passengers. It didn't feel terribly crowded.

Food—was really good for us. The MDR was horrifically slow—we went once to Allegro MDR (you reserve a time on the day of) and more to Concerto (walk in). We didn’t face long walk in waits but we went on the earlier side, 5:45ish. When we came out the walkin line was very long. Service was slow and off—like the wrong waiter would come to the table, someone would bring menus when we had already gotten appetizers and were waiting on main dishes, afternoon tea took about 30 minutes out of the 45 minutes scheduled to get the actual tea. MDR staff seemed overworked and not very friendly. This did not ruin our cruise by any means! We ate in the buffet for breakfast and a few nights for dinner. Buffet waiters didn’t come around offering water, coffee, etc. We went to the waiter stands and just served ourselves. There is only one self-serve water/juice/tea/coffee station. Food quality and selection was great!

Excursions—we did a historic walking tour in Puerto Vallarta that totally exceeded expectations. This was a ship excursion. The guide was great and we would walk a while and then have 15-30 minutes to explore on our own and meet back. It was 90 minutes of walking spread out over 4 hours. Cabo—we did a ship excursion so we could get on the tenders quickly—Best of Cabo—went to San Jose del Cabo and a glass blowing factory. Again, amazing tour guides! Really enjoyed this; wish we had spent more time in San Jose del Cabo. There was a drink stop at a restaurant that was a waste of time. Mazatlan—we did a pulmonia tour booked through Viator. It was okay. We saw a lot of city highlights. Tour guide was good for the first two hours but then we wound up at a crappy, overpriced restaurant that we didn’t feel we had a choice going to. If I do this trip again I’d probably do a beach day or excursion at Stone Island.

Teen club was excellent. They had a nice balance of structured activities (scavenger hunt, ping pong tournament, chess tournament, game shows) and free time, like board games and video games. My kids are on the younger side of teen club. One stayed in the club most of the time and the other would spend the first 2 hours in teen club and then go duck hunting with a friend group he made. The teen club operates in 3 hour blocks of time mostly.

Medallions—really great for families! We could see where our kids were and they could scan in at any elevator map and see where we were.

Overall, I want to sail Princess again, but not on this ship. I might want to try Discovery (the newest of the Royal class), or the new Sun/Star, or the older ones.",6,1768676931.0,PrincessCruises,5,0.88,False

and i kept making excuses you know? im too busy. i dont know how. im not spiritual enough. i'll start tomorrow. i'll start when things calm down. i'll start when i figure out the right way to do it.

but the thing that kept getting louder was this knowing that something was waiting for me in the silence. not like some magical answer or some voice from heaven or whatever. just like there was a version of me that i'd never met because i was too scared to stop moving long enough to look.

i think we all feel it sometimes. that call to look within. to actually sit with ourselves instead of running from ourselves. and its terrifying right? because what if we look inside and we dont like what we find? what if its just emptiness or pain or all the stuff we've been avoiding?

but here's what i realized after finally answering that call and sitting my ass down to meditate regularly. the thing that was calling me wasnt outside of me. it was me. the real me underneath all the noise and the anxiety and the performance and the constantly doing doing doing to prove im worth something.

and when i finally got quiet enough to listen it wasnt scary. it was like coming home to someone who'd been waiting for me the whole time. someone who knew me better than i knew myself and wasnt mad that id been gone so long.

started with just five minutes in the morning. felt like an idiot at first. my mind was chaos. i kept checking the time. i thought i was doing it wrong. but i kept showing up because that call wouldnt leave me alone and honestly i was tired of running from it.

three months in now and i cant explain what's changed but everything feels different. like ive been wearing clothes that were too tight my whole life and i finally realized i could just take them off. im still anxious sometimes. still stressed. still human. but theres this space now between me and all of that. like i can watch my thoughts instead of being completely hijacked by them.

prayer stopped being this thing i did when i needed something and became more like having coffee with someone who actually gets me. meditation stopped being this intimidating spiritual thing and just became sitting with myself without apologizing for existing.

and the wildest part is i think this call has always been there for all of us. that pull to stop and breathe and actually look at whats going on inside instead of constantly distracting ourselves from it. but we're so conditioned to stay busy and productive and useful that answering it feels almost rebellious.

so yeah. its calling. whatever that voice is that tells you to get quiet and look within and actually spend time with yourself instead of running from yourself. its been calling probably your whole life.

the question is are you going to answer?

because i waited so long and i wish i hadnt. i wish id trusted that pull earlier. but also maybe i wasnt ready earlier and thats okay too. maybe you're ready now. maybe youve been ready and youre just scared like i was.

but i promise you whoever or whatever is waiting for you in that silence isnt something to be afraid of. its you. the real you. and they've been waiting so patiently for you to come home.

just sit down. close your eyes. breathe. and listen. even just five minutes. answer the call. see what happens.

it changed my life and im just some random person who was scared and resistant and made every excuse. if i can do it you can too.

the call is there. its always been there. what are you waiting for?

Drop your link and I'll do yours free.","I've been pulling patterns from Google reviews for the past few weeks. Not reading them one by one, but finding what businesses actually miss.

Some things that made me go ""wait, what?""

The Hoxton Chicago charges $400/night for rooms where the L train literally shakes the walls. Fifteen reviews mention it. Zero soundproofing. Zero discount. Just... ignored.

Dalla Terra Wine Bar has one manager: ""the guy in a suit"", mentioned in 8 reviews as rude and dismissive. That's not a training issue. That's a personnel issue killing a 4.3-star business.

Wall Two 80 has customers saying ""best coffee in Balaclava"" 24 times. Their Google Business description? Generic. They're not using the exact language that drives local search.

PureGym Liverpool: broken AC for 30+ days, gym hitting 30 degrees, management ghosted members on timeline. People canceling memberships and writing 1-star reviews about being ignored.

Razza Pizza: people drive 45 minutes and call it ""life-changing."" But 12 reviews say burnt crusts at $30/pie. The messaging says ""artisan wood-fired."" The reviews says ""inconsistent execution."" That's a positioning-reality gap.

What I'm learning:

1. Voice of customer is sitting in plain sight

South Lake Chalet guests mention ""walkability to beach"" 22 times. It's not in their listing title. That's the primary decision factor and they're not leading with it.

2. Surface complaints hide the real opportunities

""This gym is crowded"" = ""not enough bench presses at peak hours"" (12 mentions)

""This hotel is loud"" = ""L train rooms need discount pricing""

The real insight is always one layer deeper.

3. Differentiation already exists in reviews

Snowy Owl Cafe: ""Authentic Peruvian empanadas"" mentioned 12x. That's differentiation in a saturated coffee market.

Barry's WeHo: Instructor playlist curation mentioned 15x. That's a specific competitive advantage, not just ""good music.""

Most businesses never extract these positioning anchors because they're reading for sentiment, not strategy.

Why I'm doing this:

I'm testing a workflow that pulls this intelligence from reviews automatically. Analyzed 11 businesses, 5,000+ reviews so far.

The process is automated, but I manually QA every report to make sure insights are actually useful (not just sentiment scores and quote dumps).

Trying to answer: What positioning should you lead with? What customer language should be in copy? What operational fix has highest ROI? What's the real reason customers choose competitors?

Currently works with Google Business Profile reviews. Planning to add more platforms (Yelp, TripAdvisor, Airbnb, Amazon, Reddit, etc.) based on what people actually want, trying to avoid building features no one needs.

Drop a Google Maps link + what you want to know:

Why customers choose competitors

What language should be in messaging

What differentiation exists but isn't leveraged

What operational fixes would move the needle

I'll run it through Kairo and share the patterns.

My story:  
  
I've only been drinking coffee for about six or seven months.  
I never liked it before, and I don't really know why. We drank coffee at home, but it didn't appeal to me. The smell did, though... when I drove past a couple of large roasting plants in my neighbourhood, I would sometimes even open my carwindow to let in the smell of coffee.  
  
I really don't remember what the exact trigger was, but I tried a latte once, watched some videos online, looked at some espresso machines... Long story short: I started making and drinking coffee. I forced myself to try/taste coffee every day to get used to the flavour, I I was determined to learn to drink it. Regular bike rides to Antwerp (Cross Roast/Café Mundi, Cuperus Horsey coffee bar) introduced me to pourouvers, dozens of types of coffee beans, and people who were all immersed in the lively coffee scene. So far for a quiet start of a new hobby...  
  
Cause things moved rather quickly: first came a Sage (Breville) Oracle Touch, a month later a Bezzera Giulia, which I (almost immediately)converted with the flow control kit... for fun and because the meter looked so much like an AR (Giulia) rev counter, a little later came the Lelit Bianca to end with the Rocket R Nine One, I use today.  
Recently, I received my Kalita Wave dripper, a Kinto coffee server and a CHiATO kettle. Soon I will be diving into filter coffee.  
  
I converted an Ikea kitchen island: on the back, at the bottom of the unit, there are two 22-litre containers (one for fresh water and one for rinse water). The system consists of a Flojet pump, a one-litre accumulator, a BWT Bestmax filter and the necessary taps. I also installed a digital bwt flow meter to get an idea of how much I am “consuming”. The filter is good for 3,000 litres/year. Heavy-duty castors are mounted under the cabinet to keep everything easily accessible and mobile.  
  
A pitcher rinser was installed (water supply is drained before the filter) and just behind it, a nice big beer tap that is used as a drinking water tap. Totally over the top, but still, if you're going to go all(most) the way, why not?  
  
Standard tamping stations, in my opinion, have far too little storage space and are often unattractive, but above all, they have space for tamping, which I find much easier to do on the edge of the table (on my rubber tamping mat).  
So I had mine custom-made (in Ukraine) in solid walnut. Four coats of quality oil and it looks really stylish.  
  
The rotary wdt tool was designed and made in Germany, bought mainly for its looks, but still, it does the job. Although I have to say that a non-rotary tool works a bit better, because the needles easily go over the edge and then bend... well, maybe I'm just not very handy, which is of course also a huge possibility.  
  
In terms of grinders, I went from a Macap MXD Xtreme (which I converted to single dose myself) to a Ceado E37SD and then a Rocket Fausto for the pour-overs, which I want to start doing soon.  
  
Then there are the scales:  
\-a barista essentials that I found too high for some cups, but all in all, a very cheap scale that does what it should and is super light, so easy to handle.  
\-a Bookoo themis ultra, beautiful design, 100% waterproof, bluetooth, auto stop/auto tare/...the whole shebang. But maybe a tad on the heavy side.  
\-a Difluid microbalance, does everything the Bookoo does, but I got a good deal bought together with a Difluid R2 refractometer. Something I want to experiment with soon.  
\-A dosing cup with built-in scales, very handy, already ingrained in my workflow: weigh beans with dosing cup, grind, weigh ground coffee in portafilter on the Barista Essentials, make espresso on the Bookoo or Microbalance.  
  
I've already taken a few barista courses, including some latte art. Soon I'll be starting the official SCA intermediate course. 🤘  
  
And yes, it has been a steep learning curve over the last six months. But it has been worth it so far, I am learning every day AND get to drink delicious coffee... after *sixty years*.....😉  
  
  
Sometimes you have to force yourself to go against your instincts, it really does bring new insights....I think.

Sometimes it feels like someone is knocking or pounding inside my head, but other times the pain comes in different forms and intensities. The pain can be strong enough that I cannot focus or do anything productive, which forces me to sleep again.

Over the years, I relied heavily on caffeine to function. At first, it helped, but I believe my body and brain gradually built a strong tolerance to it. With time, normal amounts of caffeine stopped working completely. To feel any effect at all, I had to drink extremely large amounts, sometimes 8 or 9 cups of coffee in a single day. This became dangerous, and I nearly had a heart attack, so I stopped using caffeine like that.

Because of how much I sleep, my daily life feels very limited. I wake up, eat, go to work, and then go back to sleep. There is barely any time or energy left for hobbies, learning, or enjoying life or anything, and it honestly feels like my life is slipping away.

I have tried many different ways to reduce my sleep hours, but nothing has worked so far. I am not looking for unsafe solutions or stimulants. I want to understand why my body needs this much sleep and whether there is a healthy way to reduce it or improve my energy levels.",2,1768676490.0,NoStupidQuestions,9,0.75,False

She always left the most random stuff lying around.

She always had dirty cups throughout the house! I'm talking about empty cups or cups with water or coffee still in it, in every bedroom, living room, and even the bathroom for days!! I really tried to bite my tongue and it ignore it but most days I couldn't and sorta snap.

Shit, she would even Leave lunch containers with food still in it in her car for days or weeks!! We lived in Sacramento where it's extremely hot most of the time !!

So basically there was mold growing in the plastic containers!! And the coffee cups she'll leave sitting in her office for days would also grow mold in them !! ... unfortunately, we would clash over that a lot .. ",1,1768676441.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1qflok5,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversalEpicUniverse/comments/1qflok5/my_epic_day/,My epic day,"Our last day was Thursday January 15th, and since we had 4 park hopper pass, we (my wife, daughter and I) decided to hit all our favs at Universal, IoA and Epic.  Crowds were low due to the cold, so we were able to hit all of my 7-year-old daughters favourites like Mario cart, Simpson, ET, etc.   My plan was a little different, though.  I wanted to hit all the coasters at all the parks.  

We started with coffee and Cinnabons, and while the girls ate their rolls (I was finished before them as I ordered while they went to the restroom), I hit single order line on the Hulk twice, and got both rides done in 15 mins.  After the hulk I rode Velocicoaster (front row) while the girls did the glider.  The ride shut down literally as I was walking out from the lockers, which thwarted my plan to go again quickly on the singles lane.   Looking at the photos on the way by, there was a pic of a fellow who was slumped over in his seat, so not sure if he was hamming it up for the camera or if his less-than-conscious experience was the cause of the delay.  I suspected the latter.  The ride wasn’t down for long, and by the time my family met up with me I was able to show them a train go by inverted out front of the entrance.  They, of course, thought I was crazy for riding.  From there, we headed to Hagrid’s motor bikes, which my daughter loves.  She rode sidecar with me. 

After Hagrid’s we hit the Howard’s express at about noon, and popped onto Escape from Gringots.  We looped around the top of the park to hit my daughter’s favs (MiB, Simpsons, ET), and while the girls went to Transformers I banged off The Mummy (front row).  My daughter rode the mummy 3 or 4 times through the week, but wanted to do transformers instead, as we were running short on time to get lunch and Epic in.  So off we went at about 3pm for pizzas at the Red Oven, and bus ride to epic. 

Got to epic at around 4:15, and headed straight to the Harry Potter area.  We wanted to catch the circus show, as we’d missed it on Tuesday when we spent a full day at Epic.  With some time to kill, my girl did lots of spells with her wand.  So fun.  After the show, we went to BotM, but it had gone mechanical, so off we went to Hiccups (which my daughter also loves).  Too cold for the water gun ride, and my girl is too scared to do the fliers, so off to SNW.  Quick ride on Mario cart and we were able to get Mine Cart Madness checked off the list.  By this time the wind and cold had the girls ready to tap out and they decided to get a tea and hot chocolate while I went to ride Curse of the Warewolf.  Line was short, but I used express anyway and basically walked on.  I got second cart, and the ride was kinda shit, as I didn’t really spin at all (kinda like when you do tilt-a-whirl and the cart sits on just the wrong spot and never really gets a good spin going).  The car in front of me spun like a top the whole time and the folks were commenting about how crazy it was.  So I had to go on again.  Second ride was a bit better, but I felt a bit short changed again by the spinning. When we rode on Tuesday it was way better and scared the crap out of my girl (poor thing), but it wasn’t meant to be today.  The girls decided to do the carrousel and head back to Cabana Bay, and I headed to Stardust.  Rose back row green, front row green (WAY more intense), then front row yellow for comparison.   I agree with the general consensus of green being more intense.   Headed over to knock off the Pteradon fliers since I didn’t get to ride it with my girl in tow (fun), then back to Stardust.  Front row green again.  Looped back around again for one last go, and the line was back to the bottom of the stairs at the lockers and not moving, so I bailed out and headed to the busses at 9:45.   

So all in all, a great last day.  Hit all 3 parks, hit all the coaster rides, and had plenty of multiples.  Honestly, if I hadn’t been so exhausted from 4 straight park days, 100,000+ steps, and carrying my 50 pound girl for hours and hours in lines, I could have stayed and rode stardust until 2 am if I could.  It’s so good!  Wish I could have had that second lap of VC though.  After riding front and back rows, gotta say, in these launch coasters the front row (for me) is the way to go. Especially with the negative-G features of VC and Stardust.  Front car goes over so fast, and rear car is the slowest one over.  Anyway, if you’re still reading - thanks!

Instead of a party, I’m doing a few things that feel meaningful to me: feeding street animals, planting 20 trees in vacant areas, and ending the day with a small coffee meetup.

I’m inviting 6 strangers to Red Bari Cafe. We’ll have coffee (that is on me), talk about life and everything around it, laugh, think, and just exist together for a while. Don’t bring anything at all, if you *want* to, you can write a short letter, but that’s optional.

Since I’m posting this on a teen sub while aging out, please be 18-20 only. I am equally dividing 6 people into 3 men and 3 women. We were created together, as a whole, walking with everyone feels right. Also do not come with dating agenda in mind, I understand that we often associate dating with opposite gender, but there's more in the world than just dating and clinging to somebody.

As a small token of gratitude, I’ll bring my photo gear and take individual and group photos. I’ll get them printed and mailed to each of you as a memory.

Here's a compilation of some of my favorite clips (rainy window reflections, coffee steam morphing into faces, walking through crowded neon markets, intense close-ups in the downpour):

i cleaned up the audio. it had some squeaky sounds.

**Strengths that blew me away:**

1. **Speed** – Seriously fast for what it delivers, especially compared to other local video models.
2. **Audio sync** is legitimately impressive. I tested illustration styles, anime-ish looks, realistic characters, and even puppet/weird abstract shapes – lip sync, ambient rain, subtle SFX/music all line up way better than I expected. Achieving this level of quality on just **12GB VRAM** is wild.
3. **Handles non-realistic/abstract content extremely well** – illustrations, stylized/puppet-like figures, surreal elements (like steam forming faces or exaggerated rain effects) come out coherent and beautiful.

**Weaknesses / Things to avoid:**

1. Weird random zoom-in effects pop up sometimes – not sure if prompt-related or model quirk.
2. **Actions/motion-heavy scenes** just don't work reliably yet. Keep it to subtle movements, expressions, atmosphere, rain, steam, walking slowly, etc. – anything dynamic tends to break coherence.

Overall verdict: I literally couldn't believe how two full days disappeared – I was having way too much fun iterating prompts and watching the queue.

Maybe these hiring managers never had anyone visit their home or have never welcomed with guests at all.

I had a 2 hour interview, I had to wait in the ""lobby"", it was just a space outside the elevators of the building on the first floor with doors opening to the cold weather. I think I could have gotten the office phone number beforehand to let them know when I got there so I did not have to stand around like a weirdo and freeze. I caught someone going in the office door and got into the main office area.

Once in the interview office I was not offered a water, mind you the interview was scheduled for a couple hours. I did not want to bring a big 'ol water bottle. Although, I now know the drill and bring a small water like an 8 oz plastic bottle, I mean they don't offer anything a water, coffee, or nothing.

They know I'm there for 2 hours they don't even offer a bathroom break or show me where the bathroom is located. I mean I can hold it but, it would be nice just in case.

I was told that a computer would set up for me to take the ""virtual"" portion of the interview, well they asked me to log into my email to get to the link for the interview. I was not comfortable logging into my email on their computer system. Also the email I used to apply was not on my phone, that is my own fault, I wanted a seperate email just for applyting to jobs. Of course the computer system cannot get into Gmail anyhow so this is out. I suggest they text me the link and I take the interview from my phone, this is not ideal. However, It was a solution I came up with and I made it work and everyone acts like oh no big deal we have tech issues sometimes. YES it's a BIG DEAL, I'm solving issues **already** with my own hardware mind you.

1qflk93,https://kairo.so,"I analyzed 5,000+ Google reviews across 11 businesses. The patterns are wild. Drop your link and I'll do yours free.","I've been pulling patterns from Google reviews for the past few weeks. Not reading them one by one, but finding what businesses actually miss.

Some things that made me go ""wait, what?""

The Hoxton Chicago charges $400/night for rooms where the L train literally shakes the walls. Fifteen reviews mention it. Zero soundproofing. Zero discount. Just... ignored.

Dalla Terra Wine Bar has one manager: ""the guy in a suit"", mentioned in 8 reviews as rude and dismissive. That's not a training issue. That's a personnel issue killing a 4.3-star business.

Wall Two 80 has customers saying ""best coffee in Balaclava"" 24 times. Their Google Business description? Generic. They're not using the exact language that drives local search.

PureGym Liverpool: broken AC for 30+ days, gym hitting 30 degrees, management ghosted members on timeline. People canceling memberships and writing 1-star reviews about being ignored.

Razza Pizza: people drive 45 minutes and call it ""life-changing."" But 12 reviews say burnt crusts at $30/pie. The messaging says ""artisan wood-fired."" The reviews says ""inconsistent execution."" That's a positioning-reality gap.

What I'm learning:

1. Voice of customer is sitting in plain sight

South Lake Chalet guests mention ""walkability to beach"" 22 times. It's not in their listing title. That's the primary decision factor and they're not leading with it.

2. Surface complaints hide the real opportunities

""This gym is crowded"" = ""not enough bench presses at peak hours"" (12 mentions)

""This hotel is loud"" = ""L train rooms need discount pricing""

The real insight is always one layer deeper.

3. Differentiation already exists in reviews

Snowy Owl Cafe: ""Authentic Peruvian empanadas"" mentioned 12x. That's differentiation in a saturated coffee market.

Barry's WeHo: Instructor playlist curation mentioned 15x. That's a specific competitive advantage, not just ""good music.""

Most businesses never extract these positioning anchors because they're reading for sentiment, not strategy.

Why I'm doing this:

I'm building Kairo, a tool that pulls this intelligence from reviews automatically. Analyzed 11 businesses, 5,000+ reviews so far.

Workflow is automated, but I manually QA every report to make sure insights are actually useful (not just sentiment scores and quote dumps).

Trying to answer: What positioning should you lead with? What customer language should be in copy? What operational fix has highest ROI? What's the real reason customers choose competitors?

Currently works with Google Business Profile reviews. Planning to add more platforms (Yelp, TripAdvisor, Airbnb, Amazon, Reddit, etc.) based on what people actually want, trying to avoid building features no one needs.

Drop a Google Maps link + what you want to know:

Why customers choose competitors

What language should be in messaging

What differentiation exists but isn't leveraged

What operational fixes would move the needle

I'll run it through Kairo and share the patterns.

Hey Maximizame crew! 👋

Been thinking a lot lately about how we chase those huge, life-altering goals. And don't get me wrong, aiming for the stars is fantastic! But sometimes, the sheer scale of it all can feel… overwhelming, right? Like staring up at a mountain you're not sure you can climb.

What if I told you that the real magic often happens in the tiny, consistent steps? The seemingly insignificant habits that, over time, compound into something truly extraordinary. It’s like those small drops of water that eventually carve canyons.

Think about it. What are those little things you could tweak, just slightly, that would ripple out and make a big difference?

*   **Morning Rituals:** Are you hitting snooze five times or greeting the day with intention? Even just 10 minutes of quiet, mindful activity can set a whole new tone.
*   **Movement:** Forget the intense gym sessions if they're not your jam right now. A brisk walk around the block, some stretching – anything to get the blood flowing.
*   **Learning:** A few pages of a book, a short podcast episode, watching an educational video. Small bursts of knowledge add up faster than you'd believe.
*   **Connection:** A quick text to a friend, a genuine compliment to a colleague. Nurturing those bonds feeds your soul.
*   **Mindfulness:** A few deep breaths before a stressful task, consciously savoring your coffee. It’s about being present, even for a moment.

The beauty of these habits is their simplicity. They don't require massive overhauls or huge chunks of time. They’re about finding those small levers that, when pulled consistently, can shift your entire trajectory.

And when life throws curveballs, which it inevitably does, having a solid foundation of simple, positive habits can be your anchor. It’s about building resilience from the inside out.

Sometimes, though, navigating the emotional side of things can be tough. If you ever find yourself needing a little extra support or guidance on your journey, please know that there are resources available. You don't have to go through it alone. You can find helpful tools and strategies at [this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizame).

‍

**Why This Pick?**

Not only did the last meeting between these two squads see a mere 16 points, but their last 3 straight encounters have been low-scoring affairs. And, this time around, there’s plenty more at stake. Divisional games are always intense – but with both of these teams being incredibly capable on defense, I expect points to be at a premium. Take the Under to cash.

1qflawn,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qflawn/rfunreal_city_after_dark_chapter_2/,[RF]Unreal City (After Dark) Chapter 2,"Chapter 2: Unreal City, 6:12 p.m.

At 6:12 p.m., my building spits me out onto the pavement like it’s done with me.

The sky is still bright in that smug spring way—like the day is trying to convince you you’ve always been okay. People are outside in their light jackets, their rolled sleeves, their freshly unburdened necks. They look like they’ve been edited for optimism.

Liv is leaning against the wall by the entrance, sunglasses on, iced coffee in hand, posture saying: I came here to rescue you, but I will not be gentle about it.

She takes me in—the too-heavy jacket, the dead-eyed stare, the way I’m carrying my bag like it contains a jury.

“You look like you fought a printer,” she says.

“I fought my memories,” I say. “The memories won.”

Liv offers me the coffee like an altar offering. I take it even though it’s clearly oat milk and spite.

“Okay,” she says. “Rule recap.”

“We have rules now,” I say, because it’s easier to pretend this is funny than admit I’m afraid of my own phone.

Liv counts on her fingers.

“One: no texting Ezra.”

“I didn’t text Ezra.”

“Great. Two: no looking for Ezra.”

“I can’t promise I won’t accidentally detect his presence through the vibrations of the city.”

“You’re not a bat,” Liv says. “Three: drink water.”

“I drank coffee.”

“Coffee is anxiety with a lid. Water.”

She hands me a little plastic bottle like she’s passing me a torch.

I unscrew it and take a sip. It tastes like nothing, which is somehow offensive. I want my salvation to have flavor.

We start walking toward the tube. The city at this hour is a shift change: office people unbuttoning their collars like they’re escaping a mild cult; nightlife people appearing like they’ve been summoned, already glowing, already wearing perfume strong enough to alter a stranger’s decisions.

Everywhere I look, it’s skin. Legs. Collarbones. Those little flashes of wrist when someone checks their phone. Everyone is on display. Everyone is pretending that’s not the whole point.

As we pass the station entrance, a billboard pulses overhead: FIND YOUR PERSON.
Underneath, smaller: Terms and conditions apply.

Liv laughs. “They should put that on wedding invitations.”

I laugh too, but it’s tight. Like my ribs are clenching.

Because—because—this is the exact time of day I used to meet Ezra. Six-ish. The light still there. The world in a forgiving mood. We’d walk like we were matching. We’d talk like it mattered. We’d kiss in public like we had nothing to lose except dignity.

Now my dignity is a limited-edition collectible, and I’m not sure I still have the packaging.

We descend into the tube station. The air changes the moment we hit the escalator—cooler, metallic, damp with everyone else’s breath. The underground has its own logic: time becomes foggy, all faces become tired, all lives become urgent.

A busker is playing something mournful on a violin, the kind of tune that tries to make you feel tragic on purpose. Someone drops coins into his case with the seriousness of a confession.

On the wall behind him, a poster peels at the corners. It’s for a gig: BASIL ROOK — ONE NIGHT ONLY. The face on the poster is a man with eyes like he’s seen the inside of every bad decision and lived to review it.

Liv notices me staring. “You know him?”

“No,” I say. “But my nervous system does.”

We reach the platform. It’s packed. Everyone’s lined up in those polite rows that feel like rules you never agreed to, but still obey. Above us, the electronic sign flashes: 2 MIN and then, like a joke, DELAYED.

A woman in front of us scrolls with the grim intensity of someone reading an autopsy report. A couple nearby are whisper-fighting, smiles glued on because this is public and public is performance.

“I’m just saying—” the man hisses.

“No, you’re always just saying,” the woman says, still smiling. “You never mean anything.”

I flinch like the words are thrown at me.

Liv leans in. “You alright?”

“Yeah,” I say automatically. “I’m fine.”

Liv tilts her head. “That’s your favorite lie.”

I’m saved from answering by the sound of a train arriving—wind, metal, a rush of bodies shifting. The doors open and people pour out like they’ve been held underwater.

We shuffle in. It’s one of those carriages where you can’t tell if you’re standing or being stored.

Liv wedges herself into a pole position like she’s boarding a battlefield. I end up facing the doors, shoulder-to-shoulder with strangers, trapped between a man wearing aftershave loud enough to pick a fight and a woman in gym leggings who looks like she’s never once doubted her own right to exist.

My phone buzzes in my bag.

My body reacts before my brain does. Heat, dread, a tiny rush of adrenaline that makes my mouth dry.

Liv sees my face and doesn’t even ask. She just holds her hand out.

“Gimme,” she says.

I hesitate. It’s ridiculous, the way a phone can feel like a diary and a weapon at the same time.

Liv wiggles her fingers. “Give. Me. The. Brick.”

I hand it over like it’s evidence.

She pulls it out, checks the screen, and her eyebrows lift.

“Oh,” she says. “Well. That’s… fun.”

“What?” My throat tightens. “Is it him?”

“It’s an unknown number,” Liv says, and her voice has that careful sweetness that means she’s about to say something violent. “So yes. It’s him.”

She reads, then turns the screen so I can see without touching it, like she’s showing me a cursed object.

UNKNOWN NUMBER: u going out tonight?

No punctuation. No shame. No hello. Just the assumption that he still gets a seat at my table.

The train jolts and I grip the rail. It feels, suddenly, like the carriage is too small for my rage.

“He’s asking like—” I start.

“Like you’re still his,” Liv finishes.

That hits harder than it should, because it’s too close to the truth. Not the truth of reality—our breakup, the months, the silence—but the truth of my body. My body still remembers him as a season. My body still expects him the way the city expects the next train.

Liv locks my phone.

“You’re not replying,” she says. “You’re not feeding the demon.”

“I wasn’t going to reply,” I lie.

Liv looks at me.

I look away.

Across from us, a teenage boy is filming a TikTok with his friend, both of them doing some dance that looks like it was invented by someone who has never been embarrassed. Their joy is loud. Their confidence is a miracle.

A man near the doors is reading a paperback, lips moving silently. I catch a phrase on the page as the train sways:

…the barren land…

My chest tightens, like the book knows me.

The carriage is too bright, too loud, too full of other people’s lives. I can hear snippets: a woman talking about her boss, someone saying “I told you I’m not jealous,” a laugh that sounds like a warning.

The train stops. More people cram in. My arm is pinned.

Liv leans close to my ear. “Okay. We’re upgrading the plan.”

“There’s an upgrade?”

“Yes,” she says. “Because he’s circling.”

“That’s not fair,” I say, and it comes out small, like I’m twelve. “He can’t just—”

“People do whatever they’re allowed to do,” Liv says. “Your job is to decide what you allow.”

I stare at the floor. It’s speckled, grimy, stubbornly ordinary. Part of me wants to cry. Part of me wants to laugh. Part of me wants to step off at the next stop and walk into the river fully clothed as a statement.

Liv continues like she’s giving me instructions on how to assemble myself.

“We’re going to do something symbolic,” she says.

“Oh my God,” I mutter. “Liv.”

“We’re going to buy something stupid and sacred,” she says. “We’re going to make a tiny ritual. And then we’re going to go somewhere loud enough that your brain can’t audition trauma for an audience.”

I swallow. “What are we buying?”

Liv smiles, the kind of smile that belongs to someone about to make your life worse so it can get better.

“A candle,” she says. “And possibly lingerie.”

“Liv.”

“Not for you,” she adds quickly. “Unless you want. But mostly I mean: we’re going to walk into a shop that makes you feel like a person with choices. Not a person waiting to be chosen.”

The train announces our stop with a ding that feels like judgement.

We get off into the rush of the platform. The air here is warmer, like the underground is breathing. We move up the stairs with the crowd, emerging back into daylight that’s turning gold at the edges.

Outside the station, the city is in full spring delusion. People are drinking on patios like tomorrow doesn’t exist. Someone is holding a bouquet like they’ve just forgiven life. A group of friends laugh in the way you laugh when you’ve all decided to pretend you’re fine together.

We pass a shop window filled with crystals and overpriced intentions. A sign hangs crooked in the glass:

REBIRTH. RESET. RENEW.
NO REFUNDS.

I slow. Something in me tugs toward it—like a thirsty plant leaning toward light.

Liv notices. “Absolutely not,” she says immediately, like she can hear the future.

“I was just looking,” I say.

“You were looking like a woman about to buy a curse for £39.99.”

“It might come with a free tote bag.”

Liv grabs my elbow and steers me past, brisk and affectionate.

“We are not letting capitalism perform your exorcism,” she says. “If you want to be reborn, you’re going to have to do it the old-fashioned way.”

“What’s the old-fashioned way?”

Liv glances at me over her sunglasses. “Humiliation,” she says. “And dancing.”

My phone buzzes again in Liv’s hand. She doesn’t even look at it. She just tucks it deeper into her bag like she’s burying a body.

We turn down a side street, heading toward whatever ritual she’s planning.

The sunlight hits the buildings at an angle that makes everything look briefly holy. The city, the people, the dust in the air—all of it glowing like it could mean something if you believed hard enough.

On the corner, a man in a high-vis vest is smoking and talking to someone on speakerphone. His voice carries, flat and certain:

“Love shouldn’t feel like customer service.”

I stop for half a second. Liv keeps walking, tugging me forward.

“What?” she says.

“Nothing,” I say, but my skin prickles.

Because the city has started doing that thing again—throwing lines at me like scraps of prophecy. Like I’m meant to collect them. Like if I stitch enough of them together, I’ll make a map out of the wasteland.

Liv squeezes my elbow, grounding me.

“Come on,” she says. “Let’s go buy your dignity back.”

And I follow her, into the warm week, into the noise, into the part of the city where the lights come on and everybody pretends they aren’t thirsty.",0,1768675578.0,shortstories,1,0.5,False

Maybe these hiring managers never had anyone visit their home or have never welcomed with guests at all.

I had a 2 hour interview, I had to wait in the ""lobby"", it was just a space outside the elevators of the building on the first floor with doors opening to the cold weather. I think I could have gotten the office phone number beforehand to let them know when I got there so I did not have to stand around like a weirdo and freeze. I caught someone going in the office door and got into the main office area.

Once in the interview office I was not offered a water, mind you the interview was scheduled for a couple hours. I did not want to bring a big 'ol water bottle. Although, I now know the drill and bring a small water like an 8 oz plastic bottle, I mean they don't offer anything a water, coffee, or nothing.

They know I'm there for 2 hours they don't even offer a bathroom break or show me where the bathroom is located. I mean I can hold it but, it would be nice just in case.

I was told that a computer would set up for me to take the ""virtual"" portion of the interview, well they asked me to log into my email to get to the link for the interview. I was not comfortable logging into my email on their computer system. Also the email I used to apply was not on my phone, that is my own fault, I wanted a seperate email just for applyting to jobs. Of course the computer system cannot get into Gmail anyhow so this is out. I suggest they text me the link and I take the interview from my phone, this is not ideal. However, It was a solution I came up with and I made it work and everyone acts like oh no big deal we have tech issues sometimes. YES it's a  BIG DEAL, I'm solving issues **already** with my own hardware mind you.

Maybe I'm just remebering a different time, like 2019, but people used to prepare for you to interview at the office and they made you welcome.

I think murder suspects get treated better at police interrogations...at least they get water.",2,1768675391.0,recruitinghell,0,1.0,False
1qfl4zq,https://www.reddit.com/r/malementalhealth/comments/1qfl4zq/weekly_reflections_helped_me_break_out_of/,Weekly reflections helped me break out of autopilot - wanted to share what’s worked,"I’ve been feeling like I was just going through the motions for a while - work, routine, rinse, repeat. Not unhappy exactly, just… unfulfilled? Like I wasn’t actually steering my own life.

About six months ago, I started doing weekly reflections. Just 20 minutes every Sunday morning with coffee. No fancy system, just three questions:

	1.	What mattered most to me this week?

	2.	Where did I show up as the person I want to be? Where didn’t I?

	3.	What’s one thing I want to be intentional about next week?

It sounds simple, but the consistency changed everything. I started noticing patterns - like I’d say connection mattered to me, but I was barely reaching out to friends. Or I’d feel drained, and realize I hadn’t done anything creative in weeks.

The biggest shift? Moving from reactive to intentional. Instead of just responding to whatever life threw at me, I started actually choosing how I wanted to show up.

I know a lot of us struggle with this - feeling stuck or directionless but not really knowing how to change it. Weekly check-ins have been the most practical thing I’ve found.

I actually just started a private community for men doing this together (Brother Space) because I realized doing it solo only takes you so far. First week is free if anyone wants to try it - happy to chat via DM.

Curious - does anyone else do regular reflections or check-ins? What’s worked for you?",1,1768675205.0,malementalhealth,1,1.0,False

Problem is I finish a cup in like 10 minutes because I’m hyperfocused, then I go make another one just to have something in my hand. By 11am I’m absolutely vibrating with anxiety but I still want to keep sipping.

I've started mixing half decaf / half regular pods at work just so I can drink more volume without the panic attack.

Does anyone else do this? I feel like I need a ""pint of coffee"" that has the strength of a single cup just so it lasts longer but then I just end up with watered down coffee.

1qfl1r2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qfl1r2,Bean swap? Received duplicate beans from India 🇮🇳 (Bombay Island Espresso Blend) - Roasted 8th Jan 2026.,"Bit of a long shot, but thought this sub would be the best place to ask.

I’ve ended up receiving the **same beans twice** from India, and was wondering if anyone here would be willing to participate in a **bean exchange**.

**Details:**

* **Origin:** India
* **Roaster / Source:** Bombay Island
* **Bean:** Espresso Blend
* **Roast:** Medium–dark
* **Condition:** Unopened, stored properly

Happy to swap for pretty much anything interesting — single origin, light/medium roast, filter or espresso — just keen to try something new rather than sit on duplicates.

**Postage:**  
From what I can see:

* **Evri** is roughly **£3–£4** for a small parcel (up to \~1kg)
* **Royal Mail Tracked 48** looks closer to **£4–£5**

So Evri seems slightly cheaper, but I’m flexible — whatever works best for both of us.

If you’re interested, please drop a comment or DM me with your details, and we can sort something out.

Lately, I've been curious about putting that towards an online casino instead, just for the entertainment.

But here's my dilemma: I don't want to just pick a random site and hope for the best. I'm in Canada, so I know there are licensed options, but I have no idea how to actually compare them in a smart way. I'm not looking to ""get rich,"" I just want to know the smartest way to use that small entertainment budget without getting ripped off or stuck with impossible withdrawal rules.

For example, is it better to go for a site with a lower bonus but way lower wagering requirements? Should I even care about bonuses at all with a small budget?

I tried to do some research and stumbled across comparison tables on sites like casino com/ca, which at least let you filter by stuff like ""fast payout"" and ""low wagering."" It seems like a decent way to avoid the worst traps, but I'm still not sure what metrics actually matter for a casual player.

What's your strategy? Do you have a strict budget cap? Do you avoid bonuses completely, or do you know how to spot the ones that are actually fair for small deposits?

He is a supreme commander. He is from the TRNC. He goes to the Greek side to work at the British bases. His situation is good because it is rare to see a Turkish Cypriot working at British bases. He retired at the age of 60 or 62but I am not very sure. He can speak five languages fluently: Turkish, English, Spanish, German, and Greek. He sometimes goes to Malta for work for one month each year.

When Greece attacked the TRNC, the TRNC created 16 wartime military districts, and one of them was Serdarlı, where he lives and where my entire family also lives. He has very extensive knowledge about wars and armies, so the government decided that he should become the administrator of that military district. Because his situation was good and he had strong backing due to his work at the British bases, he was chosen for this role.

For me, he is my hero. I feel different when I see him. He lived a very long life. When I was around six years old, I went to my village primary school. My school was near my grandfather’s and grandmother’s home. I always sat next to the window to look outside. I saw him every day at 2 p.m.

At that time, he was 84 years old, and after he turned 60, he spent his time in his garden, taking care of his plants and vegetables with his tractor. From the age of 60 until his death, every day he walked to the village café to drink coffee, chat, and play backgammon. He also loved cats very much and would take all of his food and give it to them. However, as you know, this is not very normal because he was getting older and his brain started to work differently.

One of my theories is that the only person in my family who likes cats is me, and I believe I carry his genes. Maybe this is the reason I feel such loyalty toward him. He could also read newspapers without glasses. After I learned English fluently, I never spoke Turkish with him. When he saw me, he started speaking English. I have a special interest in Germans. I learned their history, food, places, and language. Now I know German at a B1 level. One day, he promised me that if I learned German, we could speak German together if I wanted. But that never happened.

The reason I am writing this is that today I almost cried when I saw a chocolate. It is a Turkish product called ETİ. They sell a chocolate called Pop Kek. While I was eating it, all my childhood memories came to my mind. It has a very special place in my life. Whenever I went to their house, he always gave me this chocolate, and it made me remember everything.

Three days later, on January 19, it will be the anniversary of his death, and it will be my first year without him. I will never forget that day. I called my grandfather to come and pick me up from my house so we could go there, and then I was supposed to go to my German lesson. When my grandfather answered the phone, I realized that his tone of voice was not normal. Then I said, “Are you alright?” and he said, “Your great-grandfather is dead.” Suddenly my eyes opened. I had woken up five minutes earlier. I was deeply in shock.

He died at the age of 98. He also had Alzheimer’s. He never forgot nearly anything, but sometimes he called me by my dad’s name. For me, my dad is dead. (That’s a long story, but if you guys want, I can tell it,no problem, for real.)I get angry when he uses my dad’s name. I always want to say something when I hear my dad’s name, but I can’t say anything to him. I even don’t care. At his funeral, I was speechless.

I always remember him. RIP",0,1768674767.0,cyprus,6,0.31,False

1qfkupp,https://www.reddit.com/r/aisommelier/comments/1qfkupp/how_we_built_the_first_ai_sommelier_for/,How We Built the First AI Sommelier for WooCommerce,"I’ll never forget the conversation that sparked this entire project. I was sitting in a small wine shop in Nice, watching the owner, Marie, help a customer choose the perfect Burgundy for a dinner party. She asked about the menu, the guests’ preferences, even the weather forecast. Ten minutes later, the customer walked out with three bottles and a huge smile.

The next day, I visited Marie’s website. It had hundreds of wines listed but no guidance, no conversation, no Marie. Just a search bar and endless options. The site felt dead.

“How many people abandon their carts?” I asked her.

“About 70%,” she sighed. “They get overwhelmed and leave.”

That’s when it hit me: **online wine shopping is broken**. And artificial intelligence could fix it.

# The $44 Billion Problem

The online wine market is exploding. It’s projected to hit $44.4 billion by 2029, growing at 80% year-over-year. But there’s a massive disconnect:

**In-store wine shopping** = Personal, guided, conversational  
**Online wine shopping** = Impersonal, confusing, lonely

Customers face decision paralysis when confronted with 300+ bottles and no expert to guide them. Wine shops lose sales because they can’t scale their expertise.

The obvious solution? Hire more staff, write detailed descriptions, create filtering tools.

But that’s expensive, time-consuming, and still doesn’t replicate the magic of talking to a real sommelier.

# Why AI Was the Answer (and why nobody built this yet)

Here’s what shocked me: **there was no AI Sommelier plugin for WoooCommerce.**  None. Zero. Zilch.

There are thousands of generic recommendation engines. There are wine-themed websites. But nobody had combined:

* **AI-powered conversations** (like ChatGPT)
* **Wine-specific knowledge** (varietals, regions, pairings)
* **WooCommerce integration** (where wine shops actually sell)

The market gap was staring us in the face.

So we spent six months building it.

# What We Built (And What Makes It Different)

**AI Wine Recommendations for WooCommerce** does three things really well:

# 1. It Talks Like a Sommelier

Instead of filters and dropdowns, customers have conversations:

>

Natural. Helpful. Personal.

# 2. It Gets Smarter Over Time

Machine learning algorithms analyze:

* Which recommendations lead to purchases
* What questions customers ask most
* Which pairings resonate with different customer segments

The more it’s used, the better it performs. One of our beta testers saw their conversion rate improve by 40% in just two months.

# 3. It Works Out of the Box

This was non-negotiable. Wine shop owners aren’t developers.

Setup time: **5 minutes**  
Coding required: **Zero**  
Works with: **Any WooCommerce theme**

Upload, activate, customize your widget appearance, done.

# The Results (so far)

We launched in private beta three months ago. Here’s what happened:

**📈 35% average increase in order value**  
Customers buying more bottles per transaction when they get personalized recommendations.

**💬 10,000 conversations**  
That’s 10,000 million moments where a customer got expert guidance instead of bouncing.

**⭐ 5 rating**  
Wine shop owners genuinely love this thing.

# The Hardest Technical Challenges

Building this wasn’t straightforward. Here were the biggest hurdles:

# Challenge #1: Wine Knowledge Is Complex

We couldn’t just train a generic AI. Wine involves:

* 10,000+ grape varieties
* Regional terroir differences
* Vintage variations
* Food pairing chemistry
* Personal taste preferences

# Challenge #2: Real-Time Inventory Integration

The AI needs to know what’s actually in stock. Recommending out-of-stock wines destroys trust.

We built live WooCommerce inventory syncing so the AI only suggests available bottles. If something sells out during a conversation, it smoothly pivots to alternatives.

# Challenge #3: Making It Fast

Nobody waits 30 seconds for an AI response. We optimized for sub-2-second reply times by:

* Caching common queries
* Using efficient API architecture
* Pre-computing wine similarity matrices

Speed matters. A lot.

# Why Freemium Was the Right Model

We debated pricing for months. Enterprise-only? Subscription-only? One-time purchase?

We landed on freemium:

**Free tier:** 30 conversations/month  
**Starter:** $19/month (100 conversations)  
**Pro:** $99/month (2,000 conversations)  
**Enterprise:** $299/month (unlimited)

Why freemium?

1. **Lowers barrier to entry** — Small wine shops can try it risk-free
2. **Proves value first** — They see results before paying
3. **Natural upgrade path** — Success creates demand for higher tiers
4. **Viral growth** — Free users tell other wine shops

# What We Got Wrong (and how we fixed it)

# Mistake #1: Making Setup Too Flexible

Our initial version had 40+ customization options. Wine shop owners were paralyzed by choice.

**Fix:** Smart defaults + “Advanced Settings” toggle. Most users never touch advanced settings and get great results.

# Mistake #2: Generic Widget Design

We designed a minimal, generic chat widget. It worked but didn’t *feel* like wine.

**Fix:** Wine-inspired aesthetics, deep burgundy colors, elegant typography, wine glass icon. Conversion rates jumped 15% just from better branding.

# Mistake #3: Assuming Wine Shops Would Promote It

We thought shop owners would add the widget to their homepage and tell customers about it.

Most didn’t.

**Fix:** Proactive pop-up triggers:

* After 30 seconds on wine category pages
* When viewing 3+ products without adding to cart
* When hovering over the exit button

# The Bigger Picture: AI in Small Business

This project taught me something crucial: **AI isn’t just for enterprise companies anymore**.

Small businesses have been locked out of sophisticated technology for too long. Building tools like this democratizes what used to require million-dollar budgets and engineering teams.

Marie’s wine shop in Nice now provides the same caliber of AI recommendations as major wine retailers. That levels the playing field in a nice way.

# What’s Next

We’re launching publicly this week after three months of private beta. Here’s our roadmap:

**Q1 2026:**

* Multi-language support (French, Spanish, Italian, German)
* Advanced analytics dashboard
* A/B testing for recommendation strategies

**Q2 2026:**

* Integration with wine rating databases (Vivino, Wine Spectator)
* Custom sommelier personality options
* White-label version for wine distributors

**Q3 2026:**

* Mobile app for in-store use
* Voice-enabled recommendations
* Predictive inventory suggestions based on recommendation trends

The vision is bigger than just wine. This same technology could work for coffee, craft beer, cheese, olive oil, any product where expertise drives purchasing decisions.

# Lessons for Anyone Building AI Products

If you’re thinking about building AI tools for niche industries, here’s what I learned:

# 1. Solve a Real Problem, Not a Theoretical One

We didn’t build this because “AI is cool.” We built it because 70% cart abandonment is a real problem costing wine shops real money.

# 2. Domain Expertise Matters

Generic AI falls flat. We needed sommelier knowledge to make this work. Don’t skip the expert input phase.

# 3. Distribution > Technology

The AI is impressive, but figuring out the WooCommerce plugin ecosystem and [WordPress.org distribution](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pinpointed-ai-sommelier/) was just as important.

# 4. Make It Dead Simple

If setup takes more than 5 minutes, you’ve lost 80% of potential users. Simplicity beats features.

# 5. Freemium Accelerates Growth

Charging from day one would’ve limited our growth. Free tiers create evangelists.

# Try It Yourself

The free plan is actually free, no credit card, no tricks. Install it, see if customers engage with it, then decide if it’s worth upgrading.

# Final Thoughts

Building this taught me that **the best technology feels like magic, not machinery**.

When customers chat with our AI sommelier, they don’t think “wow, cool AI.” They think “this wine shop really gets me.”

That’s the goal. Technology should enhance human experiences, not replace them.

Marie in Nice put it best: “It’s like I cloned myself and now I’m helping 50 customers at once.”

That’s the power of AI done right.

If you build something similar for your industry, I’d love to hear about it. Drop a comment or reach out, I’m always happy to chat about AI, small business or wine.",1,1768674562.0,aisommelier,0,1.0,False
1qfkuje,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1qfkuje/im_not_a_gold_digger_wtf_is_wrong_with_men/,I'm not a gold digger wtf is wrong with men,"I'm literally super ordinary humble woman (a mom). I work, i make some money, not much, but enough. 

I don't own many bags, shoes, parfumes, jewelery. I'm okay with owning 2-3 pairs of sneakers and it's enough for me. 

I don't know why all the men i date are so scared i'm only after their (not-existing) fortune! 

  
I literally just want some cool nice fun person that is taking care of himself. No need to have an expensive car, or take me fancy restaurants or vacations. No need to pay for my coffee, and i would never ask for money out of nowhere like he's obligated to treat me all the time. 

  
BUT 

  
1. A man once gave me 50 cents (i didnt have enough cash, only card) and then demanded i return it back to him on the next date,

2. Another dude took me to shopping, saying i can pick something for myself (he treats) .... he got 6 hoodies, few pants, 2 pair of shoes ... (he was kinda rich, yes, cant deny), i asked if i can have this cute backpack for 20$ and he said ""You already have a backpack?"" .. and i said okay and we just kept shopping for him. He spend almost 1000$ for clothes and swag and got me absolutely nothing. Not that he has to, but i think u understand my point. 

3. Another dude told me straigh away he is jobless and living with his parents right now, but his biggest red flag are women using him for money. I literaly had more than him. He kept venting about exes that only wanted him to pay for their wine or coffee. This was instant turn off.  

5. A guy made a scandal, because i had the audacity to leave a tip to the taxi driver on his behalf. CONTEXT: He is in my country, so he doesn't speak the language and i'm doing all the communication. So our bill was 2.5$ and i absolutly by habbit told the driver that he can round it to 3$. My partner then was paying, so when we went home (my place) he was super pissed that i didnt ask him first. I agree maybe it was not okay to spend on his behalf, but i suggested i cover it .. but he kept going it's principal thing and i have no rights. 

6. Another ex used to put on gambling 500$ DAILY NO PROBLEM (and lose it for fun), but when he suggested to buy me a new laptop so we can game together (I DIDNT ASK FOR THIS), he said i can only pick a laptop under 500$. I really liked one for 550$ and he said thats okay, but i should cover the 50 extra. Which is fine, i guess ... maybe im in the wrong here. 



I have more examples, but  .. you got the point.

I'm super generous person and i just don't understand men. Because that's my experience with ALL the men i dated. Few times i was richer than my partnes (for example once i bough a PS4 to my ex for his bday and he was super happy) ... and i gladly share ALL my fortune with my loved once. It makes me happy buying them clothes, shoes, cool stuff, toys even .. whatever. Now as a mom i spend every coin i have for my kids. Once i found on the sidewalk bunch of cash, while hanging out with friends - i shared it all with them and treated everyone. And i don't want ""thank u , u the best, blah blah"" .. i just love it, you know? I would even send an anonymous gift to make someone happy without the need of praise. 

BUT GOD ... THESE MEN ARE ALL SO FUCKING CHEAP 

I JUST CAN'T STAND IT HONESTLY 

Not towards me only, i get it, u don't like making me gifts and treats, fine, i'm a grown up, i can take care of myself. BUT DAMN ... give this homeless person a coin. Buy flowers from a granny on the streat. Instead of 500$ for gambling, help out a friend in need! WTF IS THIS 

  
I'M HONESTLY OUT OF WORDS

Am i this unlucky to never find a men that will not be scared i will drain his bank? I mean.. look at me??!??! Do i look like high maintanence?? With my not-branded hoodie and decathlon sneakers??? FUCK SAKE ",0,1768674552.0,Vent,25,0.33,False

Push plunger at least 10mm if you have newer AeroPress or if you have changed your gasket with a silicon one

As we stand on the brink of a new year, it’s all too easy to feel overwhelmed by the pressure of resolutions and the expectation to make sweeping changes. Instead of falling into the trap of guilt and disappointment, why not embrace a growth mindset this year? Here’s how to cultivate habits that lead to real, fulfilling progress—without the added weight of guilt.

1. **Start Small Habits**: It’s tempting to aim high with grand resolutions, but this can often lead to burnout. Focus on micro habits that are achievable. Instead of saying, ""I’ll exercise for an hour a day,"" try ""I’ll walk for 10 minutes."" Small steps can lead to big changes over time.

2. **Habit Stacking**: This technique involves pairing a new habit with an existing one. For example, if you enjoy your morning coffee, use that time to practice gratitude by writing down three things you’re thankful for. This method creates positive habit formation that feels effortless.

3. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Reflect on your progress regularly. Did you walk that extra 10 minutes this week? Celebrate it! Acknowledging small victories reinforces a growth mindset and encourages you to keep going.

4. **Focus on Process Over Perfection**: It's important to remember that growth is a journey, not a destination. Embrace the process and learn from setbacks rather than aiming for a flawless execution. This approach will reduce guilt and create a more forgiving atmosphere for your development.

5. **Sustainable Resolutions**: Instead of setting lofty goals you might abandon by February, aim for sustainable habits you can gradually build on throughout the year. Create a wellness routine that fits naturally into your life, making it easier to stick with.

6. **Mindfulness and Alignment**: Finally, approach each new habit with mindfulness. Ask yourself how each action aligns with your values and long-term vision. Practicing mindfulness will help cultivate an awareness of your needs and motivations, making it easier to engage in habits without guilt.

This New Year, don't let the pressure of expectations define your habits. Instead, embrace the journey of personal growth with grace and kindness towards yourself. If you're seeking more resources on developing effective habits and nurturing your personal growth, I found valuable insights at www.thebusinessbench.com.

1qfkrr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1qfkrr3/nighttime_guests/,Nighttime Guests,"She twirled the pen in her hand and gazed at the blank cream-colored parchment that sat on her desk, its silence a mocking laugh.

She sighed and slumped back against her chair. Three days. She had been wrestling with this for three days, and she was aghast at how dry her inspiration well could run. She'd tried everything from walks in the garden to visits at the bazaar to striking up conversations with strangers even though her nerves had pleaded with her to jump off a cliff and take her chances there instead. 

And still. Nothing.

As she rummaged through her memories for any spark of an idea that could pull her out of this rut, someone entered the room. Without looking back, she knew who it was. The air around her had shimmered ever so slightly, taking on a hazy quality and smelling of possibilities. Yearning.

""There are refreshments on the table,"" she said, going back to stare at her nemesis of a paper. ""I made sure to get some oolong tea this time - your favorite.""

""Won't you join me?"" he asked, his voice soft, light, and hopeful. It tugged at her heartstrings, so she got up and made her way to the spread of goodies she'd laid out for her overnight endeavor.

""What tales to regale me with this time?"" she asked sardonically, filling up a plate with coffee biscuits and Danish pastry and moving to pour herself a cup.

Yearning chuckled, a mellifluous sound that reminded her of burbling streams in forest glades. ""Never something you don't want to hear,"" he said.

They'd filled up their plates and cups and had moved over to the couches and small table by the fireplace. The flames crackled as they seated themselves across from each other.

""Then tell me."" She broke off an edge of a coffee biscuit with her teeth, holding a hand underneath to catch the raining crumbs.

Yearning took a sip of his tea, his eyes lost in the dancing flames before looking up to meet hers. They were a grayish blue, reminding her of ocean waves in the distant horizon, the ones she could never reach.

""There's a mountain across from the sea,"" he began, ""blanketed with evergreen trees. At its base thrives a small town. People are kind. They don’t lie, swindle, or humiliate one another. You set up an apothecary at the town square. And you are competent in your trade. The herbs and oils, concoctions and contraptions that you devise are a boon for the community. Your days are spent in happy toil, and your nights are filled with contented dreams. Some nights, you take a stroll under the stars and climb the mountain for a better view. The streetlights of your hometown, now pinpricks of starlight, twinkle from where you watch. You breathe in fresh, crisp scents of mountain pine and chilly air.""

She breathed in deeply. Wouldn't that be something, she wondered.

""And."" Yearning cocked his head slightly, his eyes going back to the fire, as if he was getting new intel from the flames. ""You have pets. Lots of them."" A smile dawned over his face. ""You have a farm, actually.""

She laughed. Yes indeed. She'd always dreamed of having one ever since she'd visited her grandfather's estate in the countryside. Although he wasn't a farmer himself, he employed a large cohort of caretakers to look after the land and animals while he wrote extensively about his studies on the local flora.

Ah. A pang of realization pierced through her chest. Right. She was supposed to be writing too.

Before she could voice as much to Yearning, the air shimmered again, this time with small blue, electric sparks, bringing sights into sharper focus, and the dread that was building up like a crescendo in her gut as she thought about facing her blank parchment halted in its tracks. She wasn't happy about his coming, but it brought relief nonetheless, so she didn't complain.

Procrastination bounded into the room like a golden retriever. He clasped hands with Yearning, old friends as they were, and inclined his head towards her.

""My lady signaled distress,"" he said with a hand on his heart. ""May I assist?""

""You know you don't, Tee"" she said with a raised brow.

Tee threw back his head and laughed, deep, resonant, a mix of mirth and apology, and as warm as a hug. ""I know, I know,"" he said. ""Maybe not with the task, but I do help stave off the worst of your feelings, for the moment at least.""

She rolled her eyes. And then invite Panic to the party much later, she was tempted to say. But she bit her tongue. Tee's enthusiasm was a welcome reprieve, so she would let herself enjoy it just a little.

""What were we talking about?"" Tee asked, piling up a plate with a mound of biscuits and finger sandwiches before making himself at home at their gathering by the fire.

Yearning gestured to her. ""Our lady likes animals,"" he said, eyes twinkling.

""That's fantashtic!"" Tee swallowed a mouthful of sandwich. ""What kinds?"" He turned the full weight of his attention on her, his chocolate brown eyes wide with curiosity.

""Hmm, let's see."" She picked up her tea cup, leaned back into the couch, and took a sip, admiring the floral, peachy notes of the oolong. ""I've always wanted a pet cat, for one,"" she said, her mind going back to a particular orange tabby. ""People say they're aloof, but they're awfully tender once they warm up to you.""

Tee nodded vigorously. Yearning seemed to look at something in the distance within the fire, an almost melancholic smile on his lips.

""I once befriended an alley cat by the cobbler's when I was twelve. It was the highlight of my day to play with it while waiting for my father to get his shoes touched up. After it saw me a few times and associated my visits with food and play, it would race to meet me when I called for it.""

Tee whooped.

""Some days, I would be upset."" Something about the air had shifted and her heart was beginning to weigh like paving stones, but she continued. ""Mother might have yelled at me for playing ball around the house again, or Father would be disappointed that I couldn’t do his bidding right. Those days, I'd simply sink against the alley wall and wonder if I should spare the cat my failure of an existence too.""

Tee and Yearning were quiet. The tempo of the fire's crackle had slowed, and the shadows in the room had grown.

""Rumi,"" Tee growled.

That explained a lot. Rumination had joined them. He didn't walk through doors; he simply creeped in like a languid snake.

""Oh,"" she said, sinking further into her couch. ""Hello, Rumi."" She addressed a dark patch of shadow that she suspected was the new guest.

""Hello,"" it rasped, stretching out the ""O."" ""Don't let me interrupt, love.""

She waved towards the refreshments table. ""Help yourself."" She was resigned to deal with all three of them tonight.

The shadow drifted away and clinks of cutlery permeated the air.

""But the thing was,"" she resumed, ""that the cat always came. It didn't matter that some days I was sad. It would still come, curl up around my feet, and pour some love into my sorrow-soaked bones.""

Tee and Yearning hummed with pleasure. Rumi crashed a plate.

""But the sadness still clung,"" Rumi said in an insistent rasp, coming closer to settle with his pickings. His cup was empty, and he only had olive pits on his plate.

Looking over, Tee remarked what she was thinking. ""Interesting choice."" He nodded to what Rumi had brought over.

""The empty cup brims with bitter memories, and the pits remind of what once was.""

""A bit melodramatic,"" Tee said.

""Poetic,"" Rumi rejoined through what sounded like gritted teeth.

""I can appreciate it,"" Yearning offered, eyeing the plate and cup thoughtfully.

""Downers, the two of you."" Tee turned back to her. ""Going back to your love of cats. Did you know that cats heal themselves through purring? I wonder if your feline friend was trying to help you by passing on their vibrational frequency to your bones.""

She blinked at Tee. ""If that’s true, that'd be amazing. But see what I mean about cats being more than the haughty, dismissive creatures they're made out to be?""

""Tell me about it. Seriously.""

""Wouldn't a cat companion like that be perfect?""

""But it's tragic you couldn't take the one you loved home with you.""

She looked at the three of them. Then she looked at the clock. It was 3am. She needed Determination and Courage to keep her current guests at bay. But those brothers were flighty; she never knew when they'd come, and it has been her lifelong pursuit to make conditions as inviting for them as possible. The three present here tonight were not the wingmen she needed to get her work done.

As the three bickered about what she should indulge in next, she let her thoughts gather around her limbs. What had Determination said? ""One step at a time."" And what had Courage followed with? ""Just move."" Right.

She set down her cup. Tee, Yearning, and Rumi cut off their voices mid-argument. A tenseness stole into the atmosphere.

""Leaving?"" Tee asked, voice a bit strained.

""Just over to the desk there,"" she said, standing up. ""You are welcome to relax here. Just let me mind my business.""

Before they could throw up a protest (or rather, snare her with their stories), she made her way towards the smirking scroll of blank parchment. Just you and me now, she thought.

She scraped her chair back and sat down. Then she picked up her pen and, grasping at words floating about in the fog of her mind, wrote ""When the night was dark and the inhabitants asleep, the girl set a table for three.""

""Make it five,"" someone whispered near her.

She looked up to find Courage and Determination standing like sentries behind her. They stood with backs straight, legs planted, as if ready to take on a storm.

""Continue, my lady,"" Determination said, as he turned his watchful eyes on the other guests. ""My brother and I will keep guard.""

She offered a grateful smile then turned back to the no-longer-blank parchment. Its laughter was gone. Its silence was only brooding. It stared back at her less like an enemy and more like a grumpy cat. All it needed, she realized, her mouth curving up slightly as the tip of her pen went back to trace words on the rough texture, was just a little bit of food and play.",1,1768674371.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False
1qfkror,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qfkror,Found a hidden gem ft. Ingri at Museo,"**Disclaimer: I may have gone overboard with the photos.**

So today I visited Ingri at Museo and honestly wasn’t expecting to like it this much. Had their **deconstructed vegan burrito bowl(s)** along with vegan coffee(hot and cold) and everything was really good. Simple, comforting, not too heavy kind of food. Definitely worth a try.

What really stood out for me was the vibe of the place. It’s super calm and cozy, almost countryside like. Very quiet, not crowded at all with a closed garden and warm indoor seating. It genuinely makes you feel relaxed from inside which is rare in Gurgaon. The front yard is designed so nicely with lights and props, it almost feels like something you’d find in Delhi or some artsy city, not something very common here.

And then there’s the camera museum inside. I wasn’t expecting much but it turned out to be really interesting, kind of the cherry on top. They also keep hosting plays regularly, so if you’re into that, you can ask around. Those are paid obviously but there are both ticketed and free entry areas so you have options.

I know this might be a pretty common place for some people but it definitely wasn’t for me and I’m glad I stumbled upon it. If you’ve been here already, would love to know how your experience was.",16,1768674366.0,gurgaon,12,0.91,False
1qfkr7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensDiscipline/comments/1qfkr7c/how_to_become_disgustingly_charismatic_the/,How to Become DISGUSTINGLY Charismatic: The Science-Backed Guide That Actually Works,"You know what's wild? We all know that one person who walks into a room and somehow everyone just gravitates toward them. They're not necessarily the hottest or the smartest, but there's something magnetic about them. Meanwhile, you're standing in the corner wondering why people keep checking their phones mid conversation with you.

Here's what I found after diving deep into books, research papers, and psychology podcasts: charisma isn't some magical gift you're born with. It's a learnable skill backed by actual science. I spent months studying this because honestly, I was tired of being forgettable. And the stuff I discovered? Game changing.

**Step 1: Presence, The Foundation Nobody Talks About**

Real talk, most people aren't charismatic because they're not actually THERE when talking to you. Their mind is somewhere else, planning their next sentence, thinking about lunch, judging themselves. You can feel it.

Charisma starts with presence. When you talk to someone, you need to be 100% locked in on them. No phone checking, no eye wandering, no mental rehearsals of what you're gonna say next. Just listen. Actually listen.

**The Charisma Myth** by Olivia Fox Cabane breaks this down beautifully. She's a charisma coach who worked with executives at Google and coached folks at Stanford. The book won multiple awards and honestly, it's the best charisma book I've ever read. She explains how presence is the core of all charisma, backed by neuroscience research. Your body language, the way you listen, it all communicates whether you're truly present. This book will make you question everything you think you know about social skills.

Here's a quick hack: When someone's talking, focus on the color of their eyes. Sounds weird, but it forces you to maintain eye contact and stay present. Your brain can't wander if you're actively observing.

**Step 2: Warmth Before Competence**

Big mistake people make: they try to impress others by showing how smart or accomplished they are. That's backwards. Research from social psychologists Susan Fiske and Amy Cuddy shows people judge you on warmth FIRST, then competence. If you lead with accomplishments, you just seem like a tryhard.

Warmth means showing genuine interest in others. Ask questions. Remember details about their life. Smile when you see them, like you're actually happy they exist. Compliment people on specific things, not generic crap like ""nice shirt."" Say stuff like ""I love how you always bring energy to these meetings"" or ""That perspective you shared last week actually changed how I think about this.""

**Step 3: Master the Art of Storytelling**

Charismatic people don't just talk, they tell stories. Stories create emotion, and emotion creates connection. When someone asks how your weekend was, don't say ""good."" Paint a picture. Make them feel like they were there.

Instead of: ""I went hiking.""  

Say: ""Dude, I went hiking and got completely lost. Ended up following this random dog for like an hour until I found the trail again. Pretty sure that dog saved my life.""

See the difference? One's forgettable. The other makes people lean in.

**Step 4: The Power of Vocal Variety**

Your voice is a weapon you're probably not using. Monotone = instant boredom. Charismatic people vary their pitch, pace, and volume. They pause for emphasis. They speed up when excited. They get quieter to draw you in.

Listen to podcasts like The Jordan Harbinger Show where Jordan interviews everyone from FBI negotiators to cult survivors. Pay attention to how he modulates his voice, how he uses pauses. The guy's insanely charismatic and it's partly because he knows how to use his voice to create engagement.

Try this: Record yourself talking for 2 minutes about anything. Play it back. Cringe at how monotone you probably sound. Then practice adding variety. It feels weird at first but it works.

**Step 5: Confidence Through Body Language**

Your body talks before your mouth does. Slouching, fidgeting, crossed arms, they all scream insecurity. Charismatic people take up space. Not in an aggressive way, but in a ""I belong here"" way.

Stand tall, shoulders back, chin up. When sitting, don't make yourself small. Use hand gestures when you talk, it makes you seem more passionate and engaged. And for the love of god, uncross your arms.

Amy Cuddy's research on power poses shows that holding confident postures for just 2 minutes can actually change your hormone levels, increasing testosterone and decreasing cortisol. It's not just fake it till you make it, it's biochemistry.

**Step 6: Vulnerability as a Superpower**

Counter intuitive but true: showing vulnerability makes you MORE charismatic, not less. When you admit mistakes, share struggles, or talk about times you failed, people connect with you on a human level.

**Daring Greatly** by Brené Brown is a cultural phenomenon for a reason. Brown's a research professor who spent years studying vulnerability and shame. This book has sold millions of copies and basically launched an entire movement around authentic living. She proves through data that vulnerability isn't weakness, it's courage. When you're willing to be seen as imperfect, you give others permission to do the same. That's magnetic.

Don't overshare like you're in therapy, but don't be a polished robot either. If someone asks how you're doing and you're actually stressed about something, say it. ""Honestly, bit overwhelmed with work right now, but managing."" That's real. That's human. That's charismatic.

**Step 7: Energy Management, Not Time Management**

Charismatic people have energy. They're not exhausted zombies dragging through conversations. You can't be magnetic if you're running on 4 hours of sleep and 3 cups of coffee.

Take care of your basics: sleep, exercise, decent food. Use an app like Finch to build better daily habits. It gamifies self care and habit building, making it actually fun to track things like exercise, water intake, and sleep. When your baseline energy is higher, your natural charisma shows through.

Also, know your energy cycles. Some people are morning people, some are night owls. Schedule important social stuff during your peak energy times when possible.

**Step 8: The Platinum Rule**

You've heard of the Golden Rule: treat others how you want to be treated. The Platinum Rule is better: treat others how THEY want to be treated.

Not everyone wants the same type of interaction. Some people love banter and jokes. Others prefer deep, meaningful conversations. Some want advice, others just want to vent. Charismatic people adapt.

Pay attention to social cues. If someone's giving one word answers, they're not in the mood to chat. If they're asking follow up questions, they're engaged. Match their energy and style, don't force your own.

**Step 9: Remember Names and Details**

Dale Carnegie nailed this in **How to Win Friends and Influence People** back in 1936 and it's still true. A person's name is the sweetest sound to them. Use it in conversation. ""Sarah, that's such a good point"" hits different than just ""that's a good point.""

And remember stuff people tell you. If someone mentions they have a big presentation coming up, follow up later and ask how it went. People feel valued when you remember details about their life.

Quick trick: After meeting someone, write down their name and one unique detail about them in your notes app. Review it before you see them again.

**Step 10: Stop Seeking Approval**

Here's the paradox: the more you try to be liked, the less likable you become. Charismatic people don't need everyone to like them. They're comfortable with who they are.

When you stop performing for approval, you become authentic. And authenticity is the ultimate charisma hack. You stop saying what you think people want to hear and start saying what you actually think (with kindness and tact, obviously).

This doesn't mean being an asshole. It means having boundaries, opinions, and the courage to disagree respectfully. People respect that way more than someone who agrees with everything.

**Step 11: Practice Active Curiosity**

Charismatic people are genuinely curious about others. Not fake curious where they're just waiting for their turn to talk. Actually curious.

Ask deeper questions. Instead of ""what do you do?"" try ""what's the most interesting project you're working on right now?"" Instead of ""how was your weekend?"" ask ""what's something that made you smile this week?""

The podcast **Hidden Brain** with Shankar Vedantam explores the science of human behavior and often covers communication and social dynamics. Listening to it trains your brain to think more deeply about why people do what they do, which makes you better at connecting with them.

**BeFreed** is an AI learning app that turns all these books, research papers, and expert talks into personalized audio podcasts. Built by Columbia grads and former Google engineers, it pulls from quality sources like the books mentioned above and creates adaptive learning plans based on your specific goals, whether that's improving social skills or becoming more charismatic.

You type in what you want to work on, and it generates content customized to your preferred length and depth, from quick 10 minute overviews to 40 minute deep dives with examples. The voice options are honestly addictive, including that smoky, conversational tone that keeps you engaged during commutes or workouts. For anyone serious about continuous improvement, it makes fitting learning into daily life way more manageable.

**Step 12: Embrace Discomfort in Social Situations**

You're not gonna become charismatic by staying in your comfort zone. You need to put yourself in situations where you have to interact with strangers, make small talk, handle awkward moments.

Join groups, go to events alone, strike up conversations with randoms. It's gonna feel weird and forced at first. That's the point. You're building a muscle. The more you do it, the more natural it becomes.

Charisma isn't about being perfect. It's about being present, warm, authentic, and genuinely interested in other people. It's about making others feel seen and valued. And yeah, it takes practice. But it's absolutely learnable.",1,1768674335.0,MensDiscipline,0,1.0,False

1qfkode,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ru_sh_/comments/1qfkode/qa_and_sharing_indian_dom_and_subby/,Q&A and sharing - Indian dom and subby,"Hi, taking another Q&A and sharing our thoughts on the female led relationships. 

Background: 
I(F 33) and my husband(M32) are married for last 2 years and have been dating for 7 years. We stay in a separate apartment not very close to his and mine parents and far enough for privacy. We are in FLR for the last 5 years knowingly and unknowingly from day 1.

To add some spice to this post - 
I am currently wearing my night robe with my hair freshly washed by my sub just 2 minutes back. 
I have placed my laptop on the dining table to write this post and under the table my subby is doing my leg shave and pedicure, after which he has to paint my nails and proceed to do my hair.

Obviously, he is supposed to not speak or disturb me while I focus on writing this post. So obedient!

Lets get started -

Q: How did you guys start (most common question) -

Ans : Well, long story short - I have tendencies for a dom and he naturally fits as a sub. In our dating days also, he would rely on me for almost everything. It took me good amount of time to understand that he needs guidance and structure and thrives under my leadership. Slowly as the relationship evolved, I was naturally the lead and he followed. As we got married and moved out, now I am in full control and he has only one goal to obey me. It keeps us both very happy and involved in the relation. This also ensures the spark is never lost.

Q: How have we structured our relationship, the routine, my expectations and day to day life?

Ans: I will try to cover most of the things in this question. 

Firstly, everything that I have been able to achieve so far is because of a lot of push and efforts from my side. There will be days he dis obeys or life happens but you need to have a system of getting things back on track. The more lose you keep the more lazy he becomes. It is best for both to ensure that the roles are well documented and followed to the T.


We both are working in corporate. We both have the same shifts and come back home by 7-9pm. It has been this way for almost 7 years now.

Intially, before marriage, it was absolutely impossible for us to be able to live our dynamics on daily basis. I would notice that he became lethargic and kind of over smart with me when he would go unchecked for long period of times. It was a helpless situation for me. He even spoke badly and made me cry often. We would only get the weekends to ourselves. 

At that time, I had to stratch a lot of my head to keep him on track and establish my dominance. I read online about few things such as petticoat training, discipline and punishments, femdom and chastity to bring him in order. Highly recommend doms to read these topics.

Then I slowly introduced these things and over time it has become normal for him. I realised he was more controlled and submissive when he was in some form of bondage.

We had him wear chastity cage for different time horizons. In his initial days of chastity training, he was supposed to ensure that in a week he wears chastity at least for 24 hrs in total. This is because he should spend minimum 24 hrs in a sub state and knowing who is in charge. So, to meet this 24hrs he would wear it at night time on some weekdays and always wear it when he was out with me on weekends. This way I would establish my control even when we were doing long distance. This arrangement lasted before our marriage and moving out.

You'd be surprised that chastity changed things from 0 to 100. When he was locked, he no longer felt the thing between his legs. His mind was only on one thing which is my pleasure. He would be very attentive and submissive which made me so happy! Chastity is now like a second skin for him, and a power to me which lets me take away his penis problem and use it as per my needs. We have had him do so many different experiences locked. Like taking him out to malls, restaurants, and cinemas. 

As a rule, when we meet his parents or my parents he is always locked. This helps me endure the random taunts I get from his parents on some random stuffs. The thrill for both of us is amazing. Being locked in front of both of our parents keeps him nervous to the edge and makes me high on power. 
Fun fact : Whenever my MIL or FIL taunt or say harsh things, I add one punishment point in his diary. So when the taunting is going on, I know that he is more nervous and worried (you will know the punishment in the coming sections)

Secondly, we also discovered that adding a few items here and there kept would keep him on edge. So i started having him to wear my bra or panties when we met outside, sometimes padded bras but well hidden under cloths, a bit feminine earing, carrying my purse, painted toe nails under socks etc. It gave us both a channel to express our positions.

We also added a punishment diary where he notes the mistake I pointed out and keeps adding points. For every point he adds, he needs to get spanked 50 times.

Then when we once moved in after marriage many things changed,

Firstly, I was relieved that he is no longer far away, secondly there were lot more possibilities for me to exercise control on him. He was right in front of my eyes and it was our own private apartment with enough privacy.

So then, I slowly started to structure his routine. Over time, I have been able to make it pretty structured, keeping his office and health in mind. While I have added a lot of things to his routine, we will still keep making it more interesting going forward. I read alot of reddit and blogs for ideas. 

His current routine is after discussions with him and understanding what he likes the most - serving me. I have asked him multiple questions to figure out which submissive personality he is, and what kind of routine would make him the happiest. The routine is pretty tight, as I know he likes to be busy from morning to night and also focused on my plesure and comfort as I like it this way.

Currently the routine looks like

6/7AM - he wakes up, baths, wears mangalsutra and does pooja, then cuts vegetables for the day ahead (bf, lunch)
7AM - 8AM - he puts the cloths in washing machine, brooms the floor (mops alternate days) and puts the cloths to dry and preps my coffee

8 AM is the hard stop for him to get done with the above chores,  irrespective of when he woke up or when he slept previous night. So it is for him to decide when to wake up and manage the stuff.

8.15AM - He needs to wake me up. I quickly brush and he keeps the coffe on the table. 
8.15-8.30AM - I like to use this time for my pleasure. I sit on the chair and have him lick me non stop, v slow and in a rhythm. I usually dont make sounds now, just scroll my reels and ignore him. This is a good start of day for me. This is also the first thing he tastes in the morning. A good way to enfore the dominance on him.

8.30-9.30AM - I get into the bathroom while he quickly gets done making breakfast, he serves me and then proceeds to eat. We both have a chit chat during this time and I also help him decide the lunch menu

9.30AM - 10AM - he cooks the lunch, and packs for me while I get ready. Then at our door, when I am about to leave, he kisses my feet and I unlock his cage. This is a very important ritual we follow daily. Over time I have been able to train him enough to trust that he will not touch himself in my absence.

10AM - 11AM - He goes to our building gym and comes back takes his lunch and leaves

Notice how things are skewed? I am living lavishly while he has hectic routine? Thats exactly how FLRs work and thrive. Most females find it difficult to accept this even when they know they can achieve this. Thats because society conditioned us to always be inferior and belong to chores. If you ask my subby, he will tell you he is living the best life, and thats what I would say too! That's what makes me his dom and him an obedient sub.

Coming back -

Now we both come back from the office at random time between 7-9pm. If he comes first, then lucky for him as he can get started with chores earlier, before I reach. 

As soon as I reach we first hug and discuss our day. He then has to get the dinner menu decided by me, place order for things not available and request for getting locked into the cage. We both then start getting ready.

I get ready for my gym or pilates, whereas he gets ready as the housewife in the outfit of his night. He usually takes more time to get dressed than me, obviously because he has to do makeup and things. He has to ensure that his face makeup is ready and the wig is put so that I can add sindoor before I leave for my classes. This small gesture is very powerful. Irrespective of western or indian look I like him to dress up as married. Which means sindoor and mangalsutra are his best friends, lol. In fact, he wears mangalsutra 24/7. It is a symbol of who wears the pants in our house

We have a collection of cloths for him now.
On weekday if we are short on time he wears western with short hair wig. Otherwise if its a Friday or weekend he is mostly in saree and very long wig braided with flowers. He is now very good at makeup and getting ready and sometimes I only share the picture of what look I need him for the night. I feel so proud of him as he serves me with different looks!! 

After he gets ready, he does the cooking and once I come back from the gym we both chill and eat. 

Then we both change into our twining night gowns and relax!!I now almost have a girlfriend with whom I can watch girly movies, series, tutorials. We both spend a lot of night time gossiping and I do the bitching too!! 

Ofcourse there are a lot of things in between which I will cover in next questions

Q: How do weekends look? 

Ans : Weekends means a lot more elaborate routine for my subby and a lot of relaxation and social catchup for me. It is truely a feeling of living like a queen.

The weekends have a lot of over lap with weekday routine. The most striking change on the weekend is that he wears only sarees on weekends, properly dressed up with bangles,payals, bindi, sindoor, managalsutra and everything. If I am being too romantic I get gajra omw home sometimes. Mind you, my sarees have been wore more by him than me. Also we have got blouses stitched for it to fit him (again the tailor visit experience was another thrilling one, haha).

So as he gets in the housewife mode, I have a lot of free time. I use it in different ways. Earlier, I had this compulsion or guilt of helping him or disturbing him or not letting him do the work I set for him. But over years I have realised that he is the most happy when he is serving me and I am most happy knowing that he is my sub. This was also because I have always been conditioned that girls are supposed to do the housework and settle for less. I had to take measures to change these feelings of mine.

Coming back to topic, on weekends he has to do some deep cleaning stuff like toilets fans etc and also re arrange wardrobes, prepare groceries list etc. He is busy almost entire day and does not feel lazy or tired even once! We have written down his routine for the week and he follows it so that I am not bothered again and again.

Whereas for me, I have joined dance classes on weekends. I have a new friend circle there and we hangout. I wake up around 8 and come back from classes by 1/2pm to freshly cooked meal and my curvy wife, haha. Uk the best thing about having my sub follow this routine and dressing up is that I can live care free. Firstly at my parents place I was not privileged to have this kind of life. I was never given food on platter, but I would see other friends have thier moms take care of them. So when he does this and dresses up, I like to think of him as my ideal mom, lol.
I am healing a lot of scars thru him.


 I might have to accept this that I like seeing him all dressed up, so much under my control and working for me. To top it up he is also locked 24/7 on weekends. I usually pull him over during the day and ask him to pleasure me. Ofcourse his tongue. But because now that he is locked and dressed up, we have figured out what can replace his penis and not need to spoil his cloths or wet his underwears -  using Dildos. So he uses dildos on me to give me the pleasure of his penis. Depending on my mood I choose the size of dildo to be used (we have 3).
I will cover the sexual part in next questions. Apart from this, on certain afternoons or evenings I also visit my old friends - school, college, work etc.
I also hop to my parents place. I like a lot of shopping and I have a very close girlfriend so we spend time doing spa or shopping too. 

Overall, we both get what we both want - he gets the space and time to serve me, dressed up in the most submissive way (indian housewife) and doing chores to please me - whereas I get the control, power and assurity of him being obedient and available for my pleasures.

Q: How do you benefit from this?
Ans : Alot! Firstly, for anybody who reads above answers, it is very clear that he is very obedient and submissive. That itself helps run the home very smoothly. I dont have the problems which other ladies of my age face. Husbands are either drunkards, or jerks having affairs in office or do not move a needle at home. All this gets avoided. Instead I have a husband who plays the role of so many people. One time he is my wife, one time maid, one time sex lover and one time my toy.
It brings a lot of calm. You need to implement this to feel it.

Second, there are a lot of things I get from him -
Time : he frees up most of my time. I do not spend doing any redundant chores (which is btw a way of how women are suppresed and shown weak for centuries)
Ease : I get most things very easily, without even raise a finger. He is trained that way, from coffee to even my favorite dish. Only thing I need to invest is guidance and leadership. The more I dominate the more he submits.
Flavor : seeing him dress up and presentable adds so much color and fun in our life. Seeing him struggle in saree, then learning to carry it better, it is a journey we travelled.
Pleasure : i get the pleasure of my life. When you have submissive, you get to have pleasure in the most fulfilling ways. I have had girlfriends complain that their better halfs are only focused on themselves and dont last beyond 10 seconds. 

I am basically his source of direction. We both discuss but I decide. I have read so many articles and structured this dynamics in the way that runs the best.

Q: Sexual aspects
Ans : He is now my sex toy, almost. We both like it this way. I get the pleasure from my pleasure but I have trained him to get his pleasure from delaying, frustration and pleasing me.
Thats how all of the FLRs are. Give a read online. You will eventually evolve into this. Thats my bet. 

My pleasure -
I like him to use his tongue almost daily, and at any point of time I would need. He is trained to stop only when I say so.

Apart from that I also get pleasure by doing different things

Dildos - for avoiding to unlock his chastity
Dildos - for pegging him
Strapon - for pegging him
Nipple clips - for some teasing and pain
Stick,combs etc - for spanking
Vibrator - for my pleasure and sometimes teasing him in chastity

His pleasure -
Nipples - if your sub feels his nipples as he sees you then congratualtions, you are progressing well!
Over years, we have moved his focus and pleasure from masturbation to his nipples. Now when he feels needy, its for being touched around his nipples. 
I play with them for long periods, like 15mins to 1hrs, usually when we are chilling or watching stuff. 
I like seeing them sore or sensitive and have him twiching a bit.

Ass - he gets pegged almost weekly to keep his punishment diary clean. 1 session of pegging(10mins) and he has eliminated 2 negative points from diary
Best part of pegging is that we can go on for longer time without any issues, just enough lube needed.

Ruined Orgasm - i have evolved him to only have ruined orgasm. He is unlocked and given RO once a month, randomly as a surprise.
Early on, I realised that penis and release can be a big factor which derails our dynamics. After multiple reading online, i figured out that ruined orgasms help you to release the cum but he does not lose the state of submissive mind. Further, these orgasm are a very dominating and powerful way of having him cum without any pleasure.

Chasitity - he is locked and sometimes vibrator is used on chastity to give pleasure and a bit of tease to his penis

In our relationship, we like to call his penis - 'pussy/clitty'. Most FLR call it this way. It is no more the macho factor, as it is for being locked and given RO's. It suits because his cage is pink and his penis is now v submissive to his domme orders, almost non existant

This is very imp that you make sure to eliminate his penis from his mind and pleasures, otherwise be prepared for him to roll back to being the previous unruly self.

Previously, I used to do mistakes of touching and playing with it randomly. But this meant that his body would still associate penis playing as a reward and he would keep begging or concern me with it. 

So now, i strictly avoid touching it. Only unlocked and RO's when the time comes. Ofcourse, edging is a different ball game which I have covered below.

Q: Punishments?
Ans : Many - Pegging, RO's, spanking, making him wear feminine stuff publicly, edging

I can also randomly, ask him to play with his nipples while he is dressed up and make sounds. He is locked so I know nothing is possible and this is super hot.

For every not up to the mark chore or behaviour I give points that he notes down with reasons in his diary. Once the points cross 3 he needs to ask for my time and get spanked to bring it back to atleast 1.
As i said 10mins spank will reduce his 1 pts

But if he is busy or I am busy and if he reachs a score of 5, then he invites a mega punishment.
 
What is Mega Punishment?

First this means that on the upcoming Saturday, he will have a very tough day. Entire day he has to wear heavy stuff like my wedding saree, lehenga, jewellery etc that make it difficult to work. Then every 3 hrs he comes to me and ask to get edged for 5 mins and locked back. Mind you he has to manage this edging time without his chores getting delayed, or spoiling cloths/makeup.

Lets say I am busy that saturday and go out with friends for say 5-6 hrs, then he has to add all the edging times missed and get them done once I am back (this is the toughest as it means continous edging for 30/1hr).

During this day, I will make sure to play with his nipples, peg him and things. 

Then on next day (viz Sun), this will shift to him having to pleasure me every 3 hrs. If he doesnot make me release, then he gets edged for 10mins (which will happen multiple times during the day)

He has to ensure that he does not cum even once during these 2 days of edging. Then finally at Sunday night around 11-12pm, I will randomly RO him while edging, he has to do at the count of 5.

This will clear his entire punishment diary and give him a fresh start from Mon.

What this does is that he is very scared to disobey that will have him earn a point. Also if he earns a point he makes sure that he gets spanked willingly. Because if he crossed 3 and reachs 5, he knows he will have a mega punishment.

Q: Some common mistakes/tips for dommes
Ans : 
1. Taking things lightly: Most doms fail and have to restart from 0 just because of this mindset. Every action, word, punishment counts. Anytime you think of skipping anything, it dilutes your power. Your sub will mimic you. If he notices that you are linient, then he will take full advantage. Ever felt that he is not obeying? Mostly likely you let him be this way. As I said few things should be non negotiable -
1. His routine - well documented and conveyed
2. Your pleasure - he must know it is supreme
3. His pleasure - are a by product or at your will
4. Punishment - are there to support him be better
5. Dressing up - is needed for him to feel submissive

2. Not having your day planned : Doms usually plan their submissives day and then find themselves free. You need to know that only for the first few times you need to set up the routine for him. If you implement proper punishments then that routine getting followed is given. Now if he follows his routine and you are free, it means you need to also have a plan. It can be anything from sleeping to going out. Its your world, your freedom. Not every women dared enough to have a FLR. You are the top few powerful women who realised their potential. So make sure you benefit from it. This dynamics, the goal of it is for you to be free. For you to do things which your parents or society never let you. I have realised this late, you dont repeat it. 
Let your sub take the burden, dont have this guilt. This guilt is the conditioning which society has put the females for centuries. If females doing chores, getting ready and being submissive is ok for you then why do you feel it is wrong when your sub does it? Realise it, and come out of it. The more clear and vocal you are the more it helps

3. Clarity : Your sub is seeking only one thing from you viz clarity. You need to be sure what is needed. He will get it done. In my experience, when you communicate authoritatively, subs are more compliant.

Q: How to know you are dom?
Ans : So many cues. Firstly, during our dating phase, I would guide all our activities, take decisions. Now in marriage, I am the queen, very obvious. But more subtle cues? People! I have had so many people come up to me and say that my husband is very obedient/helping. They also feel I am bit controlling, which to be honest is a sexy thing for us. This is like having our dynamics known to others without crossing lines.
Then, do you ever feel your pleasure is more important than his? Congrats here u r again - dom. Who among the two usually raise voice in public and private? You? Congrats!! There could be so many, but basically doms know they are doms, subs dont because they need guidance.



Q: How to keep him sub?
Ans : I have tried and tested and also read online the below -

1. Tone - the way you talk matter. I call him names like follows
Does a bad job? - what a bitch! You slut, whore etc
Does a great job? such a good girl, darling etc
Dressed well? What a pretty baby, so girly etc
Every time you say these words, it just re inforces the dynamics. The more these gets used, the more FLR is the environment.

2. Encouragement - Be very very generous in compliments. He cooked well? Give me a pat, make him sit on your lap. He did something well first time? Have him get a small reward like touching his nipples etc

3. His place - In our daytoday life, he know where he is supposed to be. When we are watching romcoms he will first sit near my leg on the floor while I am on the couch. He starts massaging my legs then makes his nipples available for use. When I am having lunch on weekends, he generally serving me first and waits for me to ask him to eat. Thats because head of the house eats first.
These may sound weird but doms, dont do the mistake of taking it lightly.

4. His play - most FLR make their sub nipple play. It is a healthy play, where your sub learns to associate pleasure through nipples. If he feels needy, you can ask him to touch nipples. Over time, you will notice his nipples are sensitive and receptive. Nipple play can also act as re inforcement of your dominance and his submission. You feel happy with your sub? Ask him to play with his nipple for 5 mins. Guide his moments. This is like a small treat your pet gets. Also nipples are traditionally a female pleasure. Make sure you highlight this when he plays with nipple. Say things like - aww my baby loves his tits, what a soft nipple girly, youd love to get them sucked ha? This is re inforcement of your dominance and his sub mind.

5. Confessions - every thing you made him do, make him confess he likes it. Confessions work strongly. It will help you achieve goals faster. When I introduced chastity, i knew it was hard for him. But I would make him confess how submissive he felt. His body then started associating it with himself. He does chores, make him confess he likes it. He gives u pleasure, make him confess he likes it. Any embarassing thing you do, make him confess he likes it. 

6. Cloths - dressing him, teaching him how to dress up are again another important aspect of FLR and subs.
I have trained him to wear almost all outfits, do all makeup and accessorise by himself. We all know it takes decent time and delicate approach to get dressed. So when he is getting dressed, you need to understand whats going on in his mind. First, he is accepting that he is not wearing the pants in this relationship. Second, with every step of dressing up, he feels more controlled. Think like this - he is getting ready to please his master. That is super submissive. In indian wear, there are more submissive aspects which I suggest all of you implement - the sound making ones. Have him wear bangles and payals. These make sound as he moves. It is also a way for you to know he is working properly. It will constantly remind him of what he is wearing too! I like to joke sometimes - tere hathon me nau nau choodiya hai, haha!! Let him style his wigs differently. You can give him years of work right now if you tell him to master every aspect. Like hair, eyes, makeup, cloths. Keep him busy and you are free!!!

7. Maid - Finally, if you follow the above and train him well you will have the following at your will - a properly trained personal maid -
He is capable of -
a. Doing household chores
b. Giving you massages
c. Getting you ready
d. being your personal cook
e. giving you pleasure
You wont believe, I am also saving the maid charges because of our FLR.

8. Introduce - You can consider introducing a third person to your dynamics too! This might sound tough but it is more useful. I was hesitant but online articles suggested that this will add more fun. Which turns out to be true. What level of exposure you want is in your hands. In my case, my girlfriend (the bestest one), now knows that I am always free because my husband is my submissive. I shared it with her after a lot of caution. But to my surprise, she said that she knew I am controlling and this was obvious to her! She also feels she needs one partner like my subby. Now when I am out with her on weekends, as a fun, my subby has to call on her phone for any guidance needed (in cooking or house work). She also playfully mildly dominates him and we both have a good laugh! These things make me feel more powerful and dominant. When my friend says you are a strong lady, i feel very proud too!  


To summarize -
You need to take efforts to set up the relationship. You will have yo encourage him to submit, to do chores, to get dressed, to pleasure you. You have to also be proactive in challenging and punishing him. Make use of your time and in return, give yourself and your submissive a great life!!

To end -  Do not mistake that you have a lifetime, you dont. If you have this dynamics, you are blessed women. If you let it slip, it is the worst thing for yourself. Read and communicate to him. If your sub is next to you, make him do 1 sub thing right away to start your journey! All the best, doms!! ",1,1768674159.0,u_Ru_sh_,0,1.0,False

My family and I live in Southeast Missouri, about eight hours away from GSMNP. We are planning a vacation for this fall, and I was hoping to get a little advice from the community. 

Normally, we enjoy tent camping and hiking however this will be our first vacation with our son, who will be just over two years old. So, we will mostly be interested in areas of the park that can best be appreciated through the windshield and a cozy place to rest our heads at night. I'm curious to know of any particular highlights that are highway or roadside attractions. It's not how we normally do things, but we are just itching to get away for a little bit. 

Also, I am curious where we should look for lodging. I checked AirBNB for cabins and I see there are options, but I don't know if any particular areas are more appealing than others. I would like (as much as is reasonably possible) to  avoid touristy areas, so away from Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, etc... Definitely looking for a cabin, not a hotel room. Ideally, we would love to walk out on to a porch or patio and have our morning coffee with a mountain view. I'm seeing some cabin rentals in the Seiverville area, but it looks as it Seiverville may still be a fairly large community? I can't really tell.  Peace and quiet with beautiful natural surroundings is the target, not really interested in tours, shopping, etc. Recommendations for a nice dinner or two would be appreciated though.

Our timing is flexible. We are likely to be there something like Monday -Thursday vs over the weekend, so that should help avoid some crowds. We would like to see nice fall colors, and it looks like the last week of October or first of November should be about right for that?

I'm just trying to get some recommendations, I haven't been through that area since I was a kid back in the 90's. I always think it's best to ask the locals. Thanks for any tips!

Every week I take Vegas lines + odds and convert them into projected fantasy points. Then I compare those projections against DraftKings and FanDuel DFS salaries to create a value score, which helps determine who’s overpriced vs underpriced.

These typically lean toward chalk / higher-owned plays, so they’re great for double-ups and safer builds, but use them however they fit your strategy.

1qfki7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1qfki7g/former_hr_here_subtle_signs_your_company_is/,Former HR here - subtle signs your company is preparing for layoffs,"I’ve been through 3 rounds of layoffs (twice in HR, once when I was also laid off), and there’s a pattern that emerges before the axe falls. Not trying to create paranoia, but if you’re seeing multiple signs on this list, it might be time to update your resume.

This got long, so I’ve broken it down by timeline and severity. Hopefully this helps someone see what’s coming and prepare accordingly.

EARLY WARNING SIGNS (3-6 months out)

Financial and strategic shifts:

Hiring freeze gets announced, especially if it’s sudden or poorly explained. When companies say “we’re being strategic about growth” out of nowhere, that’s HR-speak for “we’re about to cut costs aggressively.” Pay attention to whether it’s a soft freeze (critical roles only) or hard freeze (literally nobody).

Executives start talking about “efficiency,” “operational excellence,” “doing more with less,” or “rightsizing” in all-hands meetings. Once leadership starts using these phrases repeatedly, start paying attention. They’re preparing employees psychologically for cuts.

The company misses earnings or revenue targets multiple quarters in a row, or leadership keeps revising guidance downward. Public companies especially - check their investor relations page and quarterly calls.

Consultants show up. Specifically McKcKinsey, Bain, Deloitte, or similar firms. They’re not there to make things better for employees - they’re there to identify “redundancies” and provide cover for cuts leadership already wants to make. If you see consultants doing org chart analysis or “efficiency studies,” that’s a massive red flag.

Leadership changes at the top. New CEO, CFO, or COO often means new priorities. New executives frequently want to “make their mark” within the first 100 days, and layoffs are a quick way to cut costs and restructure.

Budget and resource signals:

Training and development budgets disappear. Conference approvals get denied, software licenses don’t get renewed, that certification you wanted gets tabled indefinitely. When companies stop investing in employee development, they’re not planning long-term with current staff.

Discretionary spending freezes. Team outings canceled, holiday parties scaled back or eliminated, small perks disappear. These are the easiest costs to cut first.

Delayed or frozen merit increases and bonuses. If annual raises get “postponed” or bonuses are cut despite decent performance, the company is hoarding cash for something.

Open headcount gets quietly closed. You might not notice a hiring freeze officially, but those three open roles on your team just stop being discussed.

Cultural and messaging changes:

The “we’re a family” messaging intensifies. Ironically, when companies start really pushing the culture stuff hard, it’s often because morale is tanking and they know what’s coming. Authentic culture doesn’t need constant reinforcement.

Town halls become more frequent but less substantive. Leadership is trying to control the narrative and keep people calm, but they’re not actually saying anything meaningful.

Internal communications shift tone. Messages become more formal, more carefully worded, more legal-sounding. This usually means lawyers are reviewing everything.

Real estate and facilities:

Office consolidation starts being discussed. Subleasing space, breaking leases early, or suddenly pushing hybrid/remote work after being office-focused. Real estate is expensive and often the first place companies look to cut.

Facilities staff reductions. If maintenance, security, or reception teams shrink, that’s a leading indicator.

MEDIUM-TERM SIGNS (1-3 months out)

The ones people miss:

Your manager starts acting weird in 1-on-1s. They seem distant, can’t give you clear answers about future projects, or suddenly don’t want to talk about your career development, or they cancel 1-on1s. They often know 4-6 weeks before you do and are terrible at hiding it. Watch for:

\- Avoiding eye contact

\- Being vague about Q2/Q3 planning

\- Not fighting for resources they normally would

\- Seeming stressed or checked out

Cross-functional projects get canceled or put on hold indefinitely. If that big initiative involving multiple teams suddenly loses steam, it’s often because leadership knows the teams won’t exist soon.

Reorganizations that don’t make sense. When they shuffle reporting structures or combine teams in weird ways, they’re often preparing for consolidation. The reorg is the setup; the layoff is the follow-through.

Senior people start leaving and aren’t replaced. When your VP quietly exits and the role just disappears or gets absorbed, that’s a restructure preview. Execs often see the writing on the wall before layoffs and jump ship.

The “high performer” narrative shifts. Suddenly everyone’s being evaluated more critically, PIPs increase, and the bar for “meeting expectations” gets higher. They’re building paper trails.

HR and administrative signals:

HR schedules random meetings with employees to “check in.” This can be them gauging morale, but it can also be them identifying who might be problems during layoffs (ie, who might sue or cause issues).

Increased focus on documentation. HR suddenly cares a lot about having everything in writing, attendance records are scrutinized, minor policy violations are documented. They’re building files.

Anonymous surveys about “organizational effectiveness” or “role clarity.” They’re identifying redundancies and overlapping responsibilities.

Operational changes:

Vendors get cut or renegotiated aggressively. If the company is trying to save money everywhere, labor costs are next.

Projects shift from innovation to maintenance. All the exciting new work stops, and teams are just keeping lights on. This suggests they don’t believe in long-term investment right now.

Contractors and temps disappear first. This is always the canary in the coal mine. If contractors are let go en masse, full-time employees are usually 4-8 weeks behind.

Financial desperation moves:

The company takes on debt or seeks additional funding under unfavorable terms. This suggests cash flow problems.

Asset sales. Selling off business units, real estate, IP, or other assets to raise cash.

Delayed payments to vendors. If your company is stretching payables or late on bills, they’re struggling with cash.

IMMEDIATE RED FLAGS (2-4 weeks out)

The “oh shit” tier:

You or your team suddenly gets asked to document all your processes in detail, create runbooks, or do knowledge transfers “for continuity.” They’re preparing for people to be gone and don’t want institutional knowledge walking out the door.

Managers have mysterious meetings that aren’t on the calendar, or meetings that say “leadership sync” with no agenda. Often they’re being told how to “rank” their teams (stack ranking) or getting trained on how to deliver termination news.

HR blocks calendar time that’s marked private across the entire organization on the same day. That’s layoff day. Usually a Wednesday or Thursday.

Managers seem panicked or are suddenly unavailable. They’re either in planning meetings or mentally preparing for what they have to do.

IT or Security starts asking random questions about access, or you notice permissions audits. They’re preparing to revoke access quickly.

Conference rooms get blocked all day with “private” meetings. Those are the termination meetings.

The parking lot has way more cars than usual early in the morning on a random day. Leadership arrives early to prepare and coordinate.

The final 48 hours:

Executives all happen to be “in the office” on the same day when they’re usually remote or traveling. They want to show their faces and deliver messages in person.

Your manager asks for a “quick sync” with no context, or you get a calendar invite for early morning with just “meeting.” That’s often the termination conversation.

You notice coworkers disappearing into conference rooms and not coming back, or leaving with boxes. If it’s happening, it’s happening to multiple people today.

Email access starts acting weird, VPN connections drop, or badge access to certain areas stops working. IT is already starting to shut you down.

WHAT TO DO - ACTION PLAN

Preparation phase (as soon as you see early signs)

Update LinkedIn immediately. Make sure your profile is complete and compelling. Turn on “open to work” privately so recruiters can see it but your company can’t.

Refresh your resume and tailor it for your target roles. Have multiple versions ready for different job types. Get it reviewed by someone who knows your industry.

Document your accomplishments with metrics. Revenue generated, costs saved, projects delivered, teams built. Save this somewhere personal, not company equipment.

Save important files legally. Performance reviews, reference letters, samples of your work (that aren’t confidential), documentation of your achievements. Email them to your personal account or save to personal cloud storage. Do NOT take confidential company information, client data, or proprietary code.

Screenshot or save your LinkedIn recommendations and endorsements. Sometimes people leave and delete their profiles.

Reconnect with your network NOW while you’re employed. It’s easier to get coffee as a “catch up” than as a desperate job seeker. Reach out to old colleagues, mentors, recruiters you’ve worked with.

Financial preparation:

Build emergency fund if possible. Even an extra month of expenses helps.

Understand your benefits. Know your PTO balance, how severance works at your company (if there’s a standard package), what COBRA costs, when your stock vests, and what happens to your 401k.

Reduce expenses where you can. Not to panic level, but maybe hold off on big purchases.

Check if you have any loans against 401k or obligations tied to employment. Some companies require repayment upon termination.

Legal and administrative:

Keep records of everything. If you suspect you’re being targeted unfairly (discrimination, retaliation), document it meticulously with dates and witnesses.

Check your employment contract for non-compete, non-solicitation, and IP assignment clauses. Know what you signed.

Mental preparation:

This is not about your worth. Layoffs are business decisions, usually driven by executive mistakes or market conditions. Even top performers get cut.

Have a plan for how you’ll spend day one after a layoff. Whether it’s updating your resume, going for a run, or calling a friend, having a plan helps you not spiral.

Tell your partner or trusted person what might be coming. Don’t suffer alone or let it blindside your household.

If/when it happens:

Don’t sign anything immediately. You usually have time to review severance agreements. Consider having an employment lawyer review it, especially if it includes non-compete or release clauses.

Negotiate if possible. Severance, extended healthcare, references, job search support, equity vesting. The worst they can say is no, and many companies have wiggle room.

File for unemployment immediately. Even if you get severance, you might be eligible. Don’t leave money on the table.

Ask for a neutral reference or letter of recommendation before you leave. Much easier to get this on day one than six months later.

Understand what’s happening to your benefits. COBRA deadlines, life insurance conversion options, FSA/HSA balances.

Get contact info for colleagues you want to stay in touch with. Once you lose email access, it’s hard to reconnect.

Job search strategy:

Take a day or two to process emotionally. You don’t have to start applying immediately.

Quality over quantity. Targeted applications with customized materials beat spray-and-pray.

Use your network first. Most jobs are filled through referrals. Let people know you’re looking.

Consider contract or freelance work to bridge gaps. It keeps money coming in and shows you stayed active.

Be honest in interviews about the layoff. “Company went through restructuring” or “position was eliminated due to budget cuts” is fine. Most interviewers get it, especially if layoffs were public.

WHAT NOT TO DO

Don’t panic or make it obvious you’re job hunting. Don’t print your resume on the company printer, don’t take recruiting calls at your desk, don’t update LinkedIn with “OPEN TO WORK” publicly while still employed.

Don’t badmouth the company publicly. Even if you’re furious, keep it professional. The industry is smaller than you think.

Don’t stop doing your job. Keep performing until the end. You want good references and you never know what might change.

Don’t burn bridges with your manager. Even if they’re delivering bad news, they’re probably just doing what they were told. Stay professional.

Don’t take things that aren’t yours. Seriously, don’t steal company property, access data you shouldn’t, or do anything that could give them cause for termination instead of layoff. You want that severance and unemployment eligibility.

AFTERMATH - IF YOU SURVIVE THE CUT

Survivor’s guilt is real. It’s okay to feel relieved and also sad for colleagues who were let go.

Your workload is about to increase dramatically. Set boundaries early and document what’s not getting done. Don’t try to do three people’s jobs.

Start looking anyway. Companies that do one round of layoffs often do more. Plus, the culture and workload might not be sustainable.

Support your laid-off colleagues. Write recommendations, make introductions, be a reference. What goes around comes around.",0,1768673782.0,careeradvice,3,0.41,False

48 she,her,hers Cis yt AFAB Queer socialist/leftist antizionist patrilineal liberal reform Jewish femme who is neurodivergent/ on autism spectrum Deal with cptsd, grief trauma, perimenopause, anxiety and depression

After the overturning of Roe V. Wade in 2022- I was distraught and traumatized like many many other women, femmes and afab. I had been scrolling tiktok for a year by then and one day I saw  Maus’ live on my fyp. She was quirky, she was spunky, she was funny & she took no shit. I felt like I found someone who was “fighting the good fight” against pro forced birthers and misogynists. I bought her tshirts and wore them proudly. “Don’t hate me because you’re a doucehbag” and others. I remember when we got big 1k ppl lives and getting mass reported. It kept us dancing around tikok trying to hold space somewhere for bodily autonomy. I felt part of something bigger.

I typically don’t do well with bigger groups of friends or groups of women but our extended group felt like a chosen family of sassy weirdos and I loved it.. Sometimes we would just joke and drink on live and be naughty- it was fun. In general, I don’t conform and I don’t “fit in” especially since I am neurodivergent.  I am outspoken, passionate, and yah sometimes I am loud (I spent a large part of my life as a theatre artist and I am from the east coast so it isn’t an insult to me! For those that think it is makes me laugh. That’s all ya got??? ) In Maus’ sphere-I felt like I had purpose in a world that wasn’t recognizable for women anymore. I tried to “manage” things for Maus once she made me a moderator. Watching the comments like a hawk as soon as I woke up, ejecting the trolls, blocking the guests who used slurs etc. We had a group of 20 original mutuals who joined a discord specifically for Maus.This was the OG discord for Maus. Apparently she has had more since. Slowly, Maus started to lean on and trust me more and more for support, organization, coordinating lives etc etc. She came to me first to strategize many times before talking to the rest of the group about topics. She called me her “ride or die.” I felt special that she singled me out and said she needed me and our friendship. She had my phone number. She had my address. She knew my full government name. She knew my business website. She knew exactly what nonprofit I volunteer for and I am part of the board of directors. In retrospect, I wonder now sometimes if this was all her manipulation because I can’t trust that she ever truthfully cared for me sincerely at this point. She seemed safe then though- I wasn’t being hypervigilante with her like other femme friends in the past. All this to illustrate to you that I loved this woman. We would speak on the phone. I would be solely Maus focused & distraught when she was crying or mad. When she needed me I dropped things as quickly as I could to help her. I removed ppl from her discord for her. I would relay messages to those she cut out and blocked. I am a generous person who deliberately works hard to make friendships substantive and not transactional. I wanted community and it was exhilarating sometimes! Our goal before the 2022 midterm elections was to do as much outreach on tiktok to try and change as many minds as possible. The day before the elections we held a “a group incantation” that I had found to use witchy vibes for our protection and advantage and we all repeated it on a discord call (cheesy I know but it was cool to have solidarity) Then, after the Blue wave 2022 she became different. We had done really well but she was withdrawn. It was confusing because we had really great results and we built these friendships too. I told her she didn’t have to come back to doing lives but that she seemed sad and I wanted to support her to feel confident again.  And she did slowly come back to lives on tiktok but she had a renewed vigor for a new topic for her. She began to become increasingly involved in lives of LGBTQIA+individuals and actively supported a popular transgender creator, frequently participating in panel discussions and immersing herself in the community. One particular trans creator we would laugh and kiki with regularly on live. Many times, when Maus would debate for trans rights I remember getting frustrated because she didn’t always have thorough knowledge or evidenced arguments and sometimes (many times) I would try and correct her gently after the fact. Maus would have queer and trans representation on panel sometimes but not always and I felt responsible a lot of the time for making sure we didn't “go off the rails.” Then, one day she made a huge overture to get into vc - she had a really big issue she needed input on. She laid out what she had learned behind the scenes from a mutual about our trans friend. We heard her out. Something about a reddit thread. Something about a lesbian creator. Something about a call out a year previous. Something about lawsuit?  
A few of us were like”….. ok? What do you want us to do about this?” I wasn’t sure we needed to do anything especially since there was word of some type of legal action. I distinctly remember saying “hey we should see whatever this “evidence is,” and come back and talk about it in discord after.” She was activated and I feel like I did try and de-escalate her vibe at this point.. She had only intimated she wanted to “do something” but she wasn’t specific about what.  So I read the reddit as thoroughly as I could and we went in another group vc with her. I chirped in and said first, this is a trans creator and right now in our political climate we have to be really careful how we shine light on trans people.  
I thought to myself “It feels like she felt icky around some interactions but what is she asking us to do? I don’t see “real” receipts in any of this” Now mind you some others we knew had had uncomfortable experiences feeling sexualized by the trans creator but that is a conversation CALL IN with a mutual in private. I didn’t think it was necessarily our job to go “warn” people etc. Its generally best with someone you are mutuals or friends with to talk to them first if you can to see if the behavior can be modified. Or to ask directly about the accusations to gage if you personally want deal with this etc. If not those things- just remove them, blocking them or whatever and go about your business. I clearly said to Maus that the “optics” of “calling out” the trans creator (in whatever way) wouldn’t look good on her or us as a group. Especially since in order for it to be legit we would need more than a mostly anonymous user reddit thread. Many comments were anonymous and there was no way we could verify their veracity. (In addition there was also blatant transohobia in the reddit. Not by every commenter but it was there) She insisted that she was really mad and that she deemed the trans creator “a predator.” I was like “woh ok” in my head and tried to de-escalate her further again. I suggested and then I THOUGHT we all agreed to sleep on it AND TALK ABOUT IT TOMORROW. In my head I thought she would process it some more and come to a different conclusion the next day or that I could work on her some more to support her through feeling so triggered to find a more productive course of action. I thought I had time to mold whatever action she initiated. So I went to sleep. I wake up the next morning and everyone in the discord has apparently been up and doing a live with Maus already. But then I notice- they’re commenting in the discord thread about how its a callout not a live debate and that it’s about the trans creator. I am shocked. I go into her live and all I say is hello in the comments and within 20 seconds the guest invite timer box is in front of me. She wants me on panel RIGHT NOW. I thought of decliniing it - but I didn’t know what kind of reaction she would have to that and I never wanted to upset her. We were always on eggshells for her. I hadn’t even had coffee and it was still very early in my timezone. I accepted the invite. The invite I SHOULD have declined. And that’s when myself, and many other mutuals cycled through and performed our BLIND LOYALTY test. I said things I shouldn’t have uttered and will not utter here. Some of it was clipped and put on youtube and I tried to tread the line between my loyalty to her and trying to make sure my reputation didn’t go down the tubes however the damage was done. My actions and words were harmful.

That live was not something I wanted to do, planned to do nor felt was necessary. But in my head at the time, I thought that it would be safer for her if there were other people doing it with her. I thought I was protecting her by not defecting or abandoning her. I was also scared of her- she had all my info and atp I realized FUCK what if she gets mad at me.I knew what she was like when she was mad. Pushing back or challenging her would not go well.

But I was gobsmacked in that live that she took it even further- Maus now accused him of sexual assault which we did not have “receipts” of nor direct testimony of. She also questioned the safety of his kids and I like a little mimicking parrot said it too. Gross. I should have stuck to leaving kids OUT of it. It was wrong to bring them up. I was in her cult and but had no idea until now that I had to break from her somehow. But the live was snowballing and I was in the thick of it doubling down. It was not ok and its still not ok. Now, Some mutuals had reported feeling sexually harassed or sexualized by this person- thats not ok either. However, Harassment is not assault. Both can be sexual in nature but they are not synonmous. Maus proceeded to cry and crash out for awhile and it felt like she was making herself the victim which confused me. She was not harmed directly by the trans creator nor did she have alleged survivors of a sexual assualt coming to share their story. It’s my personal opinion she was triggered into her own ptsd and thats why the disproportionate reaction ( but I am not a psych professional so I can only theorize.) We finished the live and chaos ensued of course. Mutuals were taking sides. And Maus held 2 more lives discussing it again. One I agreed to to be friends only and the last public one she did on her own. After the last one- I told Maus directly YOU HAVE TO STOP DOING LIVES ABOUT THIS NOW. And I made sure to tell people in the discord that I didn’t help “plan” this and that that was all Maus (and whoever hyped her up in the moments leading up to that first live.) Thats when someone took a short clip of something I said one of the lives and put it on youtube. I was flabbergasted but in hearing the negative impact I made I realized that I did have accountability to take. So I tried to tread the line between loyalty to Maus with trying to rehab my reputation, apologize for the hurt of my words and give mutuals a chance to judge for themselves. I made a friends only response video and someone took it and put it on their youtube channel. I felt like I was swimming and drowning in chaos Maus had started. Maus didn’t say much about my video but I knew she was not satisfied I didn’t consult her about doing it first. At this time she stopped talking to me and thats when Missandry came back from a trip (wasn’t involved in the live callouts) inserted herself as some peacemaker moderator and decided to take that chance to try and push me out. She mispresented my words somehow and Maus demanded I meet in VC. Where she screamed at me about the point I kept making about being auto invited into panel that day. She NEVER INVITES people into panel she said. I was lying she said. I said this is what I experienced and I expressly remember the “maus has invited you as a guest” timer box. I might not have had coffee but I didn’t imagine that. So instead of her being accountable for going too far with the callout of the trans creator - she  deflected to accusing me of lying and being a narcissist. I can’t remember everything she said but she was screaming at me and I was screaming back. Thats when I was ejected from the discord. I told Missandry I was deleting my tiktok (in my head I know now so i could control who had access to me and also so if in the future I wanted to come back I would be redoing my whole fyp, my mutuals and being able to block her accounts) I had 2 friends from that time come to me and hold space with me, with them  for healing in a private 3 person discord since 2023. I am grateful they stuck with me. I was scared of her and honestly, I knew then and now that it was my relationship with her that caused all this and that I meant well but it didn’t matter. I did some bullshit. So when I came back to tiktok a month later I wouldn’t use the same name and I wouldn’t use my face. For a really long time. Maus is harmful. She is manipulative. She is a covert narcissist. It has taken a long time to heal and parse it out. She is a dangerous person especially for afab, women and all other marginalized communities. I hate hearing she rinse and repeated the cycle over again and continues to harm. But now we have solidarity among her survivors. You aren’t alone. I am not alone. And we can’t be gaslit or convinced anything she did to me or us was or is ok. Basta Maus. Enough.",1,1768673744.0,HausOfMausSnark,0,1.0,False
