I am pretty terrible at intro and talking about myself. Regardless of that I am going to try! 

I am up for gaming, talking, being weird‚Ä¶. Which I am really good at. I have been trying to do some weird photos when I am out and about, since I am trying to travel a bit more here and there. I work from home so I am usually around more than I am not. I am also a bit in the spicy brain side, which just means yay for ADHD, anxiety, depression, and honestly who knows what else is going on in there. 

I am an avid coffee and caffeine consumer, fan of all things space and sci-fi, and lover of most food (especially tacos, hell yes tacos). I have been gaming a bit more recently, mostly in Fallout and some of the more chill games. I am not against some others though. 

I do enjoy space and sci-fi as well. I like tv and movies as must of us do, but I tend to gravitate towards things I constantly watch over and over again. That‚Äôs the ADHD in the brain.

I am pretty open on talking and answer question, but I am just terrible able these intros lol. NSFW? I mean it could go that way at some point but it‚Äôs not something that has come up at all.

I bought a Kingrinder K6 and a bottomless portafilter for my cheap DeLonghi machine. I‚Äôm using supermarket coffee that's labeled as medium roast, but it seems much darker in practice.

Here‚Äôs my current recipe:

* Dose: 14g in
* Yield: 28g out
* Time: 25 seconds

The coffee looks decent with a thick, hazel brown crema but the taste is bitter and unpleasant. I'm trying to figure out whether the bitterness comes from overextraction, and how I can fix it.

I'm considering two options to reduce the bitterness:

1. Finer grind: Reduce grind size so that I get less yield in the same 25 seconds (1:1.5 ratio instead of 1:2).
2. Shorter shot: Keep everything the same but stop the shot earlier, maybe at 20 seconds to reach the same ratio.

I'm leaning toward option 2, because I suspect reducing the grind size might worsen the overextraction. But I‚Äôm not sure.

A few extra details:

* Water temp is unknown, since it‚Äôs a basic machine.
* I tamp evenly, and I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs channeling (based on what I see from the bottomless portafilter).
* No preinfusion is used.
* Puck prep is WDT, leveller, tamp.

Does anyone here have advice on which adjustment works better with dark roast coffee? Shorter time or finer grind? Or should I be changing something else entirely?

Thanks in advance.",1,1752912800.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

My idea with the kit is small footprint both physically and sonically. The kit in its minimalist setup is kick, snare, hats. Constraints compel creativity. The kit will go where drums are not expected or not normally allowed. A coffee shop would laugh you out the door if you came with a normal size kit to back a songwriter; drums are easily one of the top instruments to easily be obnoxious and off putting. Playing intensity level I want  high, but the volume low. Any idiot can always hit harder. My two goals with the minimalist setup are a physical footprint small enough to play in an elevator and the ability to pack the kit in/ on a pack and hike out some place and jam on a mountain, pontoon boat, abandoned grain silo, you name it. Why should guitarists get to have all the fun of having a portable instrument?

A week or so back, hot water started dispensing under the machine and not into my cup.  I'm pretty handy so I followed all the trouble shooting steps in the manual, watched a few YouTube videos, but I couldn't fix it myself.

I was already starting to look for a new supermatic to buy, but I checked out the warranty coverage and to my surprise the warranty is for two full years AND also to my surprise I bought the machine less than 2 years ago (for some reason I thought I had the machine longer).

I promptly  called the Philips warranty 800 number. Someone overseas picked up, and she was super helpful.  I tried her troubleshooting steps.  After about 5 mins on the call she asked me to ship the package to an address in Indiana.  She supplied me with a free FedEx label for shipping.

Within a week, Philips diagnosed the issue and promptly mailed me back the machine in perfect working order.  Philips stands behind their product and their warranty promises.  Zero cost to me (I was surprised that they paid for me to ship it to them).

Back to espresso and latte's!

1m3qtmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1m3qtmh/captain_chudd_and_the_planet_of_disappointments/,Captain Chudd and the Planet of Disappointments,"The *Wailing Parsnip* creaked as it skimmed through the stars, its sails glowing with spell-light, rigging strung with whisper-charms, and hull reinforced by ancient barkskin enchantments that occasionally exploded without warning. It was a ship feared across the Sorcerous Reach, known for leaving behind smoking craters, missing goats, and deeply confused local populations.

At her helm stood Captain Chudd Grimley, wearing a moth-eaten coat two sizes too big and a hat that doubled as a chamber pot in emergencies. He squinted at the swirling blue world below.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the one, lads,‚Äù he grunted through uneven teeth. ‚ÄúPlanet‚Äôs called ‚ÄòUrff.‚Äô Dead magic. No sorcery. No ley lines. Just a bunch o‚Äô weird ape things walkin‚Äô about and inventin‚Äô stuff.‚Äù

His crew gathered at the railings. A chorus of oohs and ahhs rose up as the ship began descending toward Earth, guided only by levitation glyphs and sheer dumb optimism.

‚ÄúMe mum always said,‚Äù Chudd continued proudly, ‚ÄúI weren‚Äôt the roundest egg in the batch. Used to pass out as a babby from forgettin‚Äô to breathe while suckin‚Äô me thumb. But look at me now, eh? Pilotin‚Äô a bleedin‚Äô skyship and headin‚Äô straight for the ripest, loot-filled mudball in the galaxy!‚Äù

First Mate Slurn, a tentacled creature who perpetually looked like he regretted every life choice, turned one eye toward the helm and the rest toward the blue-and-green planet they were fast approaching.

‚ÄúCap‚Äôn,‚Äù he oozed, ‚Äúthe chart said this world‚Äôs a Void Zone. No magic flows there. Nuffin‚Äô! Dead as me uncle‚Äôs pub quiz nights.‚Äù

‚ÄúPerfect fer plunderin‚Äô!‚Äù Chudd declared proudly. ‚ÄúNo wards, no wands, no wibblin‚Äô little wizards tryin‚Äô to fry yer giblets!‚Äù

‚ÄúBut... Cap‚Äôn. If there‚Äôs no magic, we might, er... fall outta the sky.‚Äù

Chudd narrowed his good eye. ‚ÄúThen we go in gently, see? Float down like a swan what‚Äôs eaten too many pies.‚Äù

The *Wailing Parsnip* dropped into Earth‚Äôs upper atmosphere with all the grace of a cow in a tornado. Its enchantments sputtered like a drunk uncle at a wedding speech. The glowing sails dimmed. The levitation runes popped.

‚ÄúCap‚Äôn! The rudder glyph‚Äôs evaporated! We‚Äôll crash!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, Slurn! We‚Äôll land dramatically! Steer with yer knees!‚Äù

The *Wailing Parsnip* landed in a Walmart parking lot in Kentucky, smashing through a cart corral and embedding itself neatly between two pickup trucks. Sparks flew. Chickens scattered from a cage on one of the trucks.

A lone greeter named Martha, who had seen worse on Black Friday, barely flinched.

From the smoking wreck emerged Captain Chudd, arms wide.

‚ÄúHark, ye land-folk! We demand yer treasures, yer goats, and yer women! The ones with tentacles!‚Äù

Martha popped her gum.

‚ÄúSir, this is a Walmart.‚Äù she said and went back inside.

Having received no goats, gold, or maidens, Chudd led his pirates across town in a haphazard looting expedition.

They stole:

* 2 microwaves (thinking they were war totems),
* 16 packs of AA batteries (chewed all of them),
* Hot Pockets (which they declared ‚Äúinfernal stones filled with magma and lies‚Äù),
* And a pair of Crocs, which Chudd declared ‚Äúthe finest battle footwear in the sector.‚Äù

When they encountered a vending machine, Chudd demanded answers.

‚ÄúWhat sorcery be this? It glows but does not yield!‚Äù

Slurn slapped the side of the machine.

A soda dropped.

The pirates screamed and retreated. When they gathered their courage, one of the crew challenged it to a duel and lost.

Later, a door to a gas station swung open with a jingle, nearly flying off its hinges as the crew of the *Wailing Parsnip* stormed inside. Boots slammed into tile. Muskets pointed at coffee machines. A pirate screamed at a Slurpee dispenser for ""hissin‚Äô witch-noises.""

‚ÄúRight then, lads,‚Äù Captain Chudd Grimley snarled, sword held aloft. ‚ÄúThis here‚Äôs a supply outpost. Prime fer lootin‚Äô. Grab whatever glows, burns, or has a picture of meat on it!‚Äù

Behind the counter stood a clerk. The faded name tag on his shirt read ‚ÄúKyle.‚Äù

His eyes were glazed. His face was blank. His brain marinated in THC like a steak in teriyaki. He wore a faded gas station polo, one earring, and an expression that suggested he had completely forgotten how socks worked. He didn‚Äôt blink. He didn‚Äôt move.

Captain Chudd stomped up to the counter, slammed his blade down, and roared, ‚ÄúYOU THERE! WARDEN OF THE SUPPLIES! I DEMAND TO SEE YER ARTIFACTS OF POWER!‚Äù

Kyle stared at him with the dead calm of a man who had just watched a raccoon recite poetry in his mind and was still trying to unpack the metaphor.

After several seconds of absolutely nothing happening, Kyle finally spoke, voice soft, distant, and deeply baked:

‚Äú‚Ä¶Cookies are in aisle three.‚Äù

Chudd blinked. ‚ÄúWot?‚Äù

Kyle said nothing.

Just stared.

Still not blinking.

Kyle scratched his chin with the speed and focus of a tortoise contemplating the nature of time.

Chudd leaned over the counter. ‚ÄúAre ye deaf, cursed, or summonin‚Äô something?!‚Äù

Kyle slowly turned his head 15 degrees, as if responding to a noise only he could hear. He did not elaborate.

Chudd turned to his men. ‚ÄúThis one‚Äôs gone. He‚Äôs stuck between worlds.‚Äù

Slurn nodded. ‚ÄúHe might be the local oracle.‚Äù

Suddenly, Kyle shifted.

He picked up a Mountain Dew bottle.

Looked at it like it held the secrets of life.

Then put it back.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Cookies are in aisle three,‚Äù he said again, then resumed absolutely nothing.

Chudd stepped back, awed. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs stuck in a loop. We‚Äôve broken the lad.‚Äù

They backed away cautiously and looted what they could‚Äîbags of chips, energy drinks they thought were bottled lightning, three lottery tickets they assumed were spell scrolls‚Äîand retreated in reverent silence.

As they left the gas station, they found another vending machine standing ominously by the corner.

Captain Chudd circled it slowly. ‚ÄúThis one‚Äôs different, lads. I can feel the malevolence.‚Äù

He jabbed a button. Nothing happened.

Slurn stepped forward and gently inserted a dollar he‚Äôd found in a puddle.

The machine beeped and dropped a Coke.

The pirates screamed. Someone fired a musket. The machine survived.

Chudd grabbed the can. It hissed at him.

He dropped it and drew his sword. ‚ÄúRight! That‚Äôs enough of yer sass, demon juice!‚Äù

They burned the vending machine. The local fire department was not pleased.

Leaving the vending machine inferno behind, the crew set out to find goats or maidens. After a while, they stumbled upon a yoga studio. Chudd kicked open the door dramatically.

‚ÄúLadies! I am Captain Chudd Grimley, gallant scourge of the Third Star Ring! I seek a bride with at least four tentacles and a durable thorax!‚Äù

There was silence. Then everyone started screaming, and a woman in leggings chucked a water bottle at his head.

It hit him square in the eye.

‚ÄúCap‚Äôn,‚Äù muttered Slurn as they limped away, ‚Äúnone of ‚Äòem even had tentacles.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd they‚Äôve got knees! And they bend backwards,‚Äù Chudd whispered. ‚ÄúBACKWARDS, Slurn!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs wrong, Cap‚Äôn. This planet‚Äôs just wrong.‚Äù

Disgusted by women‚Äôs disturbing lack of tentacles and their numerous knees, they abandoned the quest for maidens and, instead, ended up in a mall.

The pirates poured into a store, waving muskets, waving swords, and‚Äîin one case‚Äîjust waving because he thought it was polite. They prepared for a glorious raid.

Ten minutes later, they were hopelessly lost in the Electronics section.

‚ÄúCap‚Äôn,‚Äù whispered Slurn, examining a flat-screen TV, ‚ÄúI think this box has trapped a bard. He sings of automotive insurance. He cannot stop.‚Äù

Chudd stared at a demo video playing on loop.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs‚Ä¶ so calm.‚Äù

They watched a cooking show on one of the TVs. Then a political debate. Then a man whispering into a microphone while folding towels.

One of them screamed, ‚ÄúThis planet is CURSED.‚Äù

They tried looting the bakery, but mistook the donuts for ritual charms and the rotisserie chickens for preserved war familiars.

Grint, one of the crew, licked one. ‚ÄúCap‚Äôn. It tastes‚Ä¶ like sadness and grease. I think I like it.‚Äù

Grishnob the gunner stood in the Clothing section, holding up a pair of jeggings. ‚ÄúWhy does everything feel like it‚Äôs judging me?‚Äù

A teenage employee passed by, earbuds in.

Grishnob stopped him. ‚ÄúYOU THERE, BOY! Where are your goats!?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs aisle 12. Clearance stuff‚Äôs 70% off.‚Äù

Alas, in aisle 12, they found no goats. Just a pile of discounted garden gnomes, one of which was wearing sunglasses and holding a margarita.

Captain Chudd stared at it.  
‚Äú‚Ä¶This one‚Äôs seen battle,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúWe take him with us.‚Äù

Later, having found no goats and all sticky from a misunderstanding involving pancake syrup, they stood in front of a mailbox in a suburban neighborhood.

‚ÄúThis box holds messages,‚Äù Chudd guessed. ‚ÄúMaybe battle declarations. Or treasure maps.‚Äù

He opened it. It was full of coupons and a pizza flyer.

He stared at it, hollow-eyed.

Slurn put a tentacle on Chudd‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúCap‚Äôn‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs no goats. Maidens got no tentacles. No treasure. These people ride about in metal chariots, talk into palm-plates, and they eat meat tubes from spinning caves. They‚Äôre insane.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey call ‚Äòem micro-wah-wees, Slurn.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it. We should cut our losses and leave, Cap‚Äôn.‚Äù

The pirates dragged themselves back to the *Wailing Parsnip*, which was still smoldering but technically flight-capable.

Chudd sat on a crate, chewing a peanut butter granola bar as the ship started taking off.

‚ÄúI dunno what was goin‚Äô on down there,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúThey had no magic, and yet they‚Äôd somehow built a world worse than anything sorcery ever cursed.‚Äù

He took another bite of the granola bar before continuing. ‚ÄúAnd that oracle of the supply station. Strangest encounter, that was.‚Äù

‚ÄúAye,‚Äù Slurn said. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt flinch. Didn‚Äôt run. Just‚Ä¶ watched us. Like a star-god inside a meat suit.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe only said one thing. One.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶Cookies are in aisle three.‚Äù

They both sat in silence for a long time.

Then, very quietly, Chudd muttered, ‚ÄúWe never even checked aisle three.‚Äù",1,1752912391.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to return to the bed where Mei and Gryff had done god knows what last night‚Äîfor one, ew, her nasty-ass panties were tangled in my sheets. But more than that, the sting of betrayal still hung thick in the air, bitter and suffocating. So I took myself out to the daybeds instead.

As the sun rose, its warm light began to nudge me awake. The lingering emotions from the night before hit me hard‚Äîno, crushed me. Betrayal, anger, sadness‚Ä¶ sure. But there was something else blooming beneath all that: hope. A flicker of something fragile and unexpected. Had Rewan really come to the beach with me last night? Rewan? The Rewan who usually looked at me like I was the gum on the bottom of his shoe, and gave me the attitude to match?

Still groggy, I made my way to the kitchen for some much-needed coffee, my head pounding with the emotional hangover of it all. I leaned against the counter, slowly pulling my shot of espresso, trying not to think about the night before.

Then I heard him.

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù
The voice was low, familiar, and gruff‚Äîhis.

Without even turning around, I answered, ‚ÄúNo. Not really. You?""

""No.""

A silence passed between us, heavy but not uncomfortable. Then I felt him‚Äîhis arms wrapped around me from behind, his head resting lightly on top of mine. His scent washed over me: rich, musky aftershave with a hint of mint from his toothpaste. The kind of closeness that made your heart beat ring in your ears.

‚ÄúLet me,‚Äù he said softly, taking over making my coffee like it was second nature.

He worked quickly, mixing a latte with practiced ease. To my surprise, he even made a foam heart on top‚Äîjust like he had for Tori at the sleepover.

‚ÄúNot half-empty this time, huh?‚Äù I teased, trying to shake the heaviness that still clung to me.

‚ÄúHa ha, very funny. Now drink. We had a long night‚Äîyou‚Äôre gonna need the caffeine. What do you want for breakfast?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel like eating anything right now.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre going to. So pick something or I‚Äôll pick for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou pick, then. Let‚Äôs see what you‚Äôve got.‚Äù

He gave me a small smile before turning to the fridge, humming quietly as he pulled out ingredients. The silence between us was finally a warm one, and I let myself bask in it, leaning against the counter opposite him.

He glanced up at me, then quickly looked away when he realized I caught him staring. That‚Äôs when it hit me: I was still in pajamas. And not just any old pajamas. A sheer black corset and panty set, complete with garters and thigh-high nylons‚Äîdefinitely meant for a different audience. I‚Äôd worn this for someone else last night. Not Rewan. And then it dawned on me that he‚Äôd seen me in it for the last 8 hours.

Flustered, I blurted, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna go change real quick‚ÄîI‚Äôll be back really quick.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou better be,‚Äù he teased, but I was already halfway down the hall, cheeks burning.

Inside the dressing room, Tori, Rosalie, and Kez were chatting, trying on outfits and doing their makeup. The moment I walked in, conversation dropped. My eyes were still swollen from crying, and it was obvious.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Keziah said gently, ‚ÄúWhat happened? Are you okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. It‚Äôs nothing,‚Äù I lied, brushing past them and flipping through my closet like I wasn‚Äôt completely unraveling- not missing the glance that the girls shared as they clearly didn't buy my feigned nonchalance. 

I finally settled on a leopard-print bikini with a matching sarong, then sat down at the mirror, dabbing concealer under my eyes and brushing on some mascara‚Äîdoing my best to erase the warzone on my face.

Just then, Mei flounced into the room.

She froze the second she saw me at the table, visibly wincing before moving on and pretending like nothing happened, But for once, she didn‚Äôt say a thing.

The tension in the room was thicker than molasses, but no one said anything. Tori gave me a look, silently asking what had happened. Mei and I had never been good friends, but the frost between us had reached new levels today, and clearly all the girls were wondering why. 

I finished my mascara, capped the tube, and stood, adjusting the knot of my sarong as if that could somehow hold me together.

‚ÄúGoing to eat breakfast?‚Äù Rosalie asked softly.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I murmured, voice tight. ‚ÄúI should go before the boys burn the place down.‚Äù

That earned a few light laughs, but I didn‚Äôt stick around to bask in them. I pushed open the dressing room door and headed back to the kitchen, the cool tile grounding me as my bare feet padded down the hall.

Rewan was plating scrambled eggs and toast when I walked in, still humming. He glanced up as I entered, and for a moment, he just stared.

‚ÄúThat bikini‚Äôs a dangerous choice,‚Äù he said, voice still rough from his evident lack of sleep.

‚ÄúBetter than a corset at breakfast,‚Äù I quipped, grabbing my coffee and sipping it like I hadn‚Äôt just redone my whole face.

‚ÄúDebatable,‚Äù he replied with a sly grin before sliding the plate across the counter toward me.

I perched on one of the stools and poked at the eggs with my fork. He sat down across from me, hands loosely clasped, watching me too closely for comfort.

‚ÄúDid you sleep at all?‚Äù he asked after a beat.

‚ÄúNot really.‚Äù

He nodded slowly, chewing on the inside of his cheek. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt deserve that, you know.‚Äù

I swallowed hard. ‚ÄúNeither did you.‚Äù

Silence.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not used to you being nice to me,‚Äù I said eventually, forcing a smile that came out crooked. ‚ÄúKinda throws me off.‚Äù

His eyes flicked up to meet mine. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not always good at being nice.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm trying.‚Äù

That quiet honesty cracked something open in me.

‚ÄúMe too,‚Äù I said.

We sat in that stillness for a moment, both of us unsure of what to do with the fragile thing growing between us. Then the front doors opened, the sound of flip-flops and laughter echoing through the villa as the rest of the islanders started trickling out for the day.

And just like that, our little bubble burst.

Rewan stood, collecting our plates. ‚ÄúCome on. We better go pretend to be functional human beings before people start speculating.‚Äù

‚ÄúToo late for that,‚Äù I muttered, grabbing my coffee and following him out.

But as we stepped into the morning sun, and his hand brushed against mine for just a second longer than it needed to, I realized something dangerous.

I didn‚Äôt want to let go. 

(later... )

We stepped out into the sunlit chaos of the villa- me still in my leopard print ordeal and Rewan brooding in black. Our silence wasn‚Äôt comfortable, exactly, but it was loaded. Like a lit match sitting right next to a  wick. One tiny shift and everything could ignite.

The others were already scattered across the loungers, sipping smoothies and talking low, casting glances like they hadn‚Äôt all heard the shouting last night, still unsure of exactly what had happened.

And there they were.

Gryff, grinning like he wasn't the personification of betrayal. Mei, draped beside him, wearing a smirk and our pain like lip gloss. She had the audacity to look smug, like she‚Äôd just won something. Like she wasn‚Äôt a walking red flag who‚Äôd set fire to two people just to feel warm.

Rewan‚Äôs jaw tightened. I didn‚Äôt need to look at him to feel the fury rolling off his body. I had my own.

We sat down on the daybed in sync, as if we were choreographed. Far apart enough to appear normal, close enough that the tension persisted. I quietly sipped the latte he‚Äôd made me, and Rewan dramatically threw one arm behind his head and let out a long, loud sigh.

‚ÄúGod, betrayal just hits different in paradise, doesn‚Äôt it?‚Äù he muttered theatrically.

Then, because the universe has a twisted sense of humor, Mei stood up. Gryff stayed lounging like the snake he was, but she strutted toward us like she was about to hand-deliver a PR apology. It was so obvious, I was almost shocked she hadn't gotten Nathan to help her. 

‚ÄúCan we talk?‚Äù she asked me, clearly already bracing for rejection.

I raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúIs this your version of a peace offering or just your latest act of self-importance?‚Äù

She blinked, then looked at Rewan. ‚ÄúBoth of you, actually.‚Äù

Rewan scoffed. ‚ÄúOh, how thoughtful of you.‚Äù

Mei crossed her arms. ‚ÄúLook, I get it. You‚Äôre both mad‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúMad?‚Äù I cut in, sweet and poisonous. ‚ÄúMad would‚Äôve been last night. This morning? I‚Äôm just tired.""

Rewan sat up, eyes glossy. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm not mad, I‚Äôm devastated. I mean, how could you? You told me you came in here to win me back, Mei. You said we had something.‚Äù

She blatantly ignored him, seeming to almost enjoy his pain.

‚ÄúMei,‚Äù I said, voice cold. ‚ÄúYou spent weeks stirring shit for no reason other than the fact that I exist. Then you crawl into my bed‚Äîliterally‚Äîand screw my partner. What is actually wrong with you?‚Äù

Mei rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúAre you two done?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù we said in unison.

She stared at us for a beat, like she couldn‚Äôt figure out how this had turned on her.

‚ÄúI hope it was worth it,‚Äù I said simply. ‚ÄúBecause this? What you did? It‚Äôs not something you come back from.‚Äù

She looked like she might speak again‚Äîbut Rewan raised a hand like a director calling cut.

‚ÄúYour scene‚Äôs over, babe. Exit stage left.‚Äù

Mei glared at him, at me, at our hands now loosely linked on the sunbed. Then she turned and walked away.

We didn't watch her go.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs going to try something again,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Rewan said. ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt know how not to.‚Äù

I turned to him slowly. ‚ÄúSo what now?‚Äù

He tilted his head, considering. ‚ÄúNow? We recover. We brood. We plot. Maybe get a tan.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd after that?‚Äù

Rewan looked at me, gaze sharp but warm. ‚ÄúThen we give them something to talk about.‚Äù

Eventually night came, and the villa had gone quiet, save for the soft hum of insects and the occasional splash from the pool filter. The others were inside or tucked away somewhere pretending not to watch the aftermath of the drama unfold, still trying to put together the pieces. 

I was curled up on a daybed in one of the shadowy corners of the patio, arms around my legs, staring out into the dark. I didn‚Äôt hear Rewan approach‚Äîjust felt the shift in the air before he dropped down beside me, uninvited as always.

‚ÄúYou hiding or sulking?‚Äù he asked, voice low but laced with his trademark arrogance.

I didn‚Äôt look at him, but scowled slightly. ‚ÄúYou always show up when I least want company.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I do it,‚Äù he replied smoothly, leaning back on his elbows like this was some casual catch-up between friends, not two people gutted by the same girl.

We sat in silence for a minute. I could feel him looking at me.

‚ÄúYou actually liked her,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúYeah. Clearly not my finest moment.‚Äù

""You can say that again. Don't know what you ever saw in her.""

He sat up, scooting slightly closer. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt act like you‚Äôre the only one who got burned.‚Äù

‚ÄúI never said I was,‚Äù I shot back. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not going to sit here and cry about someone who made me feel small just to feel big.‚Äù

Rewan smirked. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt think you would. That‚Äôs the thing about you‚Äîyou‚Äôre too proud to break. It‚Äôs annoying as fuck.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre too arrogant to admit when you‚Äôre hurt.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù he said, eyes flicking down to my lips for just a second. ‚ÄúBut at least I‚Äôm not pretending I don‚Äôt feel this.‚Äù

His voice dropped on that last word. And suddenly he was closer. Too close. The kind of close where everything feels like it‚Äôs about to tip over.

His hand brushed against my thigh‚Äîbarely there, but deliberate.

My pulse jumped.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an asshole,‚Äù I said, barely more than a whisper.

He grinned, slow and cocky. ‚ÄúYeah. But you haven‚Äôt moved.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt. I couldn‚Äôt.

His face was right there, his lips so close it hurt. For a second, I thought he might actually do it. Kiss me. Cross the line. Make everything more complicated than it already was.

But instead, he leaned in so close his nose brushed mine‚Äîand then stopped.

‚ÄúNot tonight,‚Äù he murmured, voice low and smug and somehow aching at the same time.

And then he pulled back.

Just like that.

He stood, dusting off his hands like he hadn‚Äôt just left me absolutely breathless on a sun-warmed cushion in the dark.

And I sat there, furious with myself for wanting him to turn around.

The night air hung heavy with anticipation, every laugh and whisper edged with an undercurrent of fear for the upcoming dumping. The villa glowed softly under the string lights, but inside, everyone was bracing‚Äîfor the vote, for the fallout, for the inevitable.

Rewan had just walked away from me, leaving me spiraling ahead of the night's real problem. 

The group gathered around the firepit, the producers‚Äô text ringing out, loud and ominous, reminding us that one couple would be dumped tonight. Eyes flicked around nervously, sizing up alliances and enemies, but my focus was locked on Rewan, who‚Äôd followed at a distance but hadn‚Äôt said a word since our conversation.

He sat opposite me now, keeping a healthy distance from Mei as I did Gryff. 

‚ÄúYou ready for this?‚Äù I mouthed.

He looked over, his signature cocky grin spreading as he nodded almost imperceptibly. 

I smirked back, but inside I was shaking. Because losing someone tonight might mean losing more than just a game.

The votes were read aloud, names called, hearts pounding. When it came down to  Rewan & Mei, Gryff & I, and Rosalie & Darin, the room felt like it stopped having air.

Rewan‚Äôs hand brushed against mine as he stood closer to me than he should, a fleeting touch but enough to send a shock through me.

When our fate was finally announced‚Äî Rosalie and Darin were going, we were both safe ‚Äîa breath I hadn‚Äôt realized I was holding escaped me.

He caught my eye, and in that glance was a challenge, a promise, and maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîa warning.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt over,‚Äù he said, voice low.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I whispered back. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only just beginning.‚Äù

# Best 12 by 9 Rugs 2025: find Your Perfect Style

A 12 by 9 rug is a considerable investment in your home's decor,capable of transforming a room's ambiance and tying together disparate elements.Choosing the right rug size, style, and material involves several factors. A well-chosen 12x9 area rug can anchor a living room furniture arrangement,define a dining space,or add warmth and texture to a bedroom.This extensive guide explores the best 12 by 9 rugs available in 2025, considering various styles, materials, and budgets to help you find the perfect rug to elevate your space.

## Key Features Analysis

Finding the right rug involves considering size, material, style, and construction. Understanding these key features is crucial to making an informed decision.

**Dimensions:** Accurately measuring 12 feet by 9 feet (approximately 366 cm x 274 cm) and ensuring it fits the intended room is vital.

These dimensions provide ample coverage for large living spaces or bedrooms, allowing furniture to be properly anchored and creating a cohesive look. Consider measuring your space carefully and using painter's tape to visualize the rug's size before committing to a purchase. Remember that rug size significantly impacts the overall aesthetic and functionality of a room.

**Material Composition:** Materials range from natural fibers like wool, cotton, and jute to synthetics like polypropylene, polyester, and nylon.

Each material offers distinct advantages and disadvantages. Wool is known for its durability, luxurious feel, and natural stain resistance. Cotton is softer and more affordable but less durable than wool. Jute provides a natural, textured look but can be less comfortable underfoot.Synthetics like polypropylene are highly stain-resistant, easy to clean, and budget-friendly, making them ideal for high-traffic areas. The material composition not only impacts the rug's appearance and feel but also its durability,maintenance requirements,and overall lifespan.

**Construction Type:** Options include hand-knotted, hand-tufted, machine-made, and flatweave.

Hand-knotted rugs are the most labor-intensive and expensive, but they also offer unparalleled quality, intricate designs, and longevity. Hand-tufted rugs are more affordable than hand-knotted rugs, but they still provide a luxurious look and feel. machine-made rugs are the most budget-friendly option, offering consistent quality and a wide range of designs. Flatweave rugs are lightweight, reversible, and easy to clean, making them ideal for casual spaces. The construction type affects the rug's texture, durability, and price point.**Style and Design:** Rugs range from conventional persian and oriental patterns to modern geometric designs, abstract motifs, and solid colors.The style and design of a rug should complement the existing decor and reflect your personal taste. Traditional rugs frequently enough feature intricate patterns,rich colors,and a formal aesthetic. Modern rugs tend to incorporate clean lines, geometric shapes, and neutral colors. Abstract rugs offer a more artistic and expressive look, while solid-colored rugs provide a simple, versatile backdrop for furniture and accessories. Considering your room's color palette, furniture style, and overall aesthetic will help you narrow down your options and choose a rug that enhances the space.

**Pile Height and Texture:** The pile height, ranging from low-pile (less than 0.25 inches) to high-pile (over 0.75 inches), affects comfort and maintenance.

Low-pile rugs are easier to clean and maintain,making them suitable for high-traffic areas and homes with pets. High-pile rugs provide a plush, luxurious feel underfoot, adding warmth and comfort to bedrooms and living rooms. The texture of a rug can also vary, from smooth and refined to shaggy and textured. Consider your lifestyle, traffic patterns, and personal preferences when choosing the ideal pile height and texture for your 12 by 9 rug.

## Core Benefits

A 12 by 9 rug offers multiple benefits to a room‚Äôs decor and functionality. It provides visual anchor to furniture groupings, adds warmth and comfort, and enhances acoustic properties.

**Defines Space:** A 12 by 9 rug is perfectly sized to delineate a seating area in a large living room or to anchor a dining set, creating a clearly defined space within an open floor plan. By placing the rug strategically beneath furniture, it visually connects the pieces and establishes a sense of order and cohesion. This is particularly useful in larger rooms where furniture arrangements might otherwise feel disjointed or scattered. The rug acts as a visual boundary, helping to define the purpose and scope of each area within the room.

**enhances Warmth and Comfort:** A rug adds a layer of insulation to hard flooring surfaces, providing warmth underfoot and enhancing the overall comfort of a room.

This is especially beneficial in colder climates or in rooms with tile or hardwood floors. The soft texture of a rug can make a room feel more inviting and cozy,encouraging relaxation and a sense of well-being. Choosing a rug with a high pile height or a plush texture can further amplify this effect, creating a luxurious and comfortable atmosphere. A 12 by 9 rug covers a substantial area,maximizing its impact on the room's overall temperature and comfort level.

**Improves Acoustics:** Rugs absorb sound, reducing echo and creating a quieter, more pleasant environment.

In rooms with hard surfaces like hardwood floors,tile,or concrete,sound waves tend to bounce around,creating echo and reverberation. A rug acts as a sound dampener, absorbing these sound waves and minimizing the amount of echo in the room. This can significantly improve the acoustics of the space, making it easier to have conversations, watch television, or listen to music without distractions. The larger the rug, the more effectively it can absorb sound, making a 12 by 9 rug particularly beneficial in large, open-plan spaces.

**Adds Style and Personality:** A rug can serve as a focal point in a room, introducing color, pattern, and texture that reflect your personal style and complement the existing decor.

Whether you prefer a bold, geometric design, a subtle, neutral pattern, or a vibrant, abstract motif, a rug allows you to express your individuality and create a cohesive, harmonious aesthetic.A well-chosen rug can tie together disparate elements in a room,unifying the color palette,enhancing the furniture style,and adding a touch of personality. It can also be used to introduce a pop of color or a contrasting texture, adding visual interest and depth to the space.

We're still social primates, wired for interaction. We get rewarded with Dopamine, Serotonin and Oxytocin when we connect.

That's why even exchanging a nod or a smile with a stranger can feel so good.

But, we're being radicalised by algorithms and separated from each other by screens.

Basic social interaction seems to be becoming a lost art.

In today's world one of the most radical, rebellious and subversive things you can do is to speak to another human instead of look at a screen.

It doesn't have to do anything wild...

A bit of small talk with the person sitting next to you at the subway.

1. Don‚Äôt Be a Coconut

Be kind. Be chill. Don't be hard on the outside and hollow on the inside.

2. No Creeping

This is a meetup space, not Tinder in disguise. Respect boundaries or be respectfully shown the way out.

3. Memes Allowed, Chaos Controlled

We love memes. We live for jokes. But if your meme belongs in a haunted WhatsApp group, keep it there.

4. Meetups > Meltdowns

Want to host an event? Go for it. Want to start a fight over chai brands? Maybe calm down first.

5. Expats, Locals, Aliens ‚Äì All Welcome

Whether you're from Kazhakkoottam, Kozhikode, or Krypton ‚Äî you‚Äôre family here. Just don‚Äôt ask ‚ÄúIs Trivandrum boring?‚Äù unless you're ready for a 50-comment roast.

6. Spam = üßπ

7. NSFW? More like NS-Fa-Way

Let‚Äôs keep it SFW unless your meetup involves a serious debate about sambhar recipes. Then we allow mild spice.

8. Lost in Trivandrum? Post Anyway.

Can‚Äôt find good coffee? Need roommates? Want to go to the beach but don‚Äôt want to die alone? That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre here for.

9. Report Trolls, Don‚Äôt Feed Them

A moment between two souls who've learned that procrastination is the thief of love.","‚ÄúLater‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been planning on something.‚Äù ‚Äì

The snowy face was sitting in front of the watery eyes.

On the roadside.

Under the shadow of a large stand-umbrella that hid them from the sun‚Äôs sight.

On a counter facing a wooden bench,

That held two cups of coffee, white and bright.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think I must learn to cook. I am really bad at it.‚Äù ‚Äì

‚ÄúOh really?‚Äù

The watery eyes had a smile that had lifted the weak fragility of the weary face into a unified beauty.

‚ÄúYou doubt?‚Äù ‚Äì

The wide eyes of the snowy face questioned like those of a headmistress.

‚ÄúOh no. I don‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the only choice you have.‚Äù ‚Äì

The snowy face, too, evolved into a glittering smile. Her cheeks rose like two snow-covered mountains.

Contrary to normal, her long strands of black were set free this time.

Beautifying the cloudy-white face that smiled for an elderly, yet equally fragile, weary face. ¬†

‚ÄúHow do you plan it, then?‚Äù The watery eyes lifted the cup of coffee.

‚ÄúOh, my dear. What an interrogation.‚Äù The snowy face gave a lively chuckle and took a sip. ‚ÄúI will. Later.‚Äù ‚Äì

‚ÄúLater? ‚Ä¶ Why later?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know me now. It‚Äôs like it ‚Ä¶ for me. has always been.‚Äù

Both of them put down their cups.

Flowing in their talks.

In the mild wind that hugged.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. At least this time it won‚Äôt be *Later.*‚Äù

‚ÄúHow come?‚Äù ‚Äì

The broad, black eye questioned with keen excitement, to which the weary face, sitting right in front, rose to smile again.

‚ÄúWe can cook together.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôd be fun ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ actually more lovely than just fun.‚Äù ‚Äì

‚ÄúYeah. It‚Äôs just a matter of being with someone very dear and near one that the things which were once heavy to move, suddenly drop from being a weight to be hoisted to a quiet stream of water that just keeps slipping away effortlessly.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow, I do not doubt that.‚Äù ‚Äì

‚ÄúI am here for you. And you are near me. We are, therefore, blessed again that together we can make things move ‚Ä¶ for each other.‚Äù

‚ÄúIndeed, we are.‚Äù ‚Äì

The snowy face was listening to each word with every heed that it had.

‚ÄúSo, it won‚Äôt be later this time. I will be your push ‚Ä¶‚Äù A gentlemanly, mellow face of watery eyes looked at the snowy face. ‚ÄúAnd together we can slide.‚Äù

¬†

The two of them absorbed the ongoing flow of words by taking a pause to laugh and exchange a smile.

The wind made the stand-umbrella rustle as if it, too, was enjoying and laughing in its own way.

There were pedestrians. Toddlers holding the finger of their parents. Children followed their mothers like little chicks behind a hen. Some were alone. Busy with their holdings. Others walked in couple, talking. The was flowing as it had forever since.

People moved towards where they were needed.

But right in the midst of it all, a bonded molecule sat stationary and inert. A molecule named after the snowy face and the watery eyes. For they were already there where they were needed the most.

Alone in their togetherness.

Making them whole in the completeness,

Of their loneliness.¬†

¬†

The watery eyes placed the cup back with a sharp, shrill clatter.

‚ÄúBut you know, this *‚ÄòLater*‚Äô is a poison.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. It is ‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äì

‚ÄúBecause:

Later?

What is later?

Later, the coffee gets cold.

Later, we are old.

Later, things slip from our hold

And we are no longer any bold

¬†

Later isn‚Äôt any time any time

Because late holds no fate.

¬†

Later, the smiles fade to cries

Later, the day sinks to night

Later, our shape is different

It‚Äôs not the same to be felt.

¬†

Later isn‚Äôt any time for which one must wait

For Later is only a bait.

Later, the air changes.

Later, the feelings are lost

Later, the words leave us away ‚Äì they blur away

And there is nothing to gain but a loss.

For later, the love is lost.

¬†

Later, that person disappears ‚Äì if not asked to stay

Later, that dear is no longer there.

Later, the time is sold

And we are no longer gold

Alone, without that person‚Äôs hold

¬†

Later isn‚Äôt any time.

For later holds no fate,

It‚Äôs nothing but a bait.

¬†

Later?

We don‚Äôt know what will be later on.

Because later is always too late

Later is already too late.

¬†

Later, strengths transform into weaknesses

Later, fragmented is every finesse

Later, what we try to hide

Becomes the tears of life.

Later, it‚Äôs only regret

Of not taking the step

Later, the sun will be gone

And we aren't but soil‚Äôn‚Äôbone

¬†

Because later is already too late, and earlier is now. So do it in the moment you have, without the questions of ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù

¬†

Later, it's far from reach

What we have at present

Later, this turn is left behind

To be past.

That haunts, lives, and lasts.

¬†

We mustn‚Äôt throw things on later. For this word will make us lose. Then it will make us hate when the world will say, ‚ÄúYOU‚ÄôRE ALREADY TOO LATE.‚Äù

Because later is far from sight.

On later, we shouldn‚Äôt bet our fights.

¬†

So I am telling you this little tale

About now,

And not later

Know it, my dear

Oh, my very near,

Later is already dead

Now is what holds the breath

Now is what is alive

Now ‚Ä¶ is life.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúMy coffee is cold now. But your words have well replenished the warmth.‚Äù ‚Äì

The shining, snowy face, supported by her fist, said profoundly with its broad, wide eyes dug deep into the watery ones.¬†

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù The weary face chimed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing. Something that I think is true. Something that I believe is the same as ever. Maybe now I know it. But I have come putting my matters on this *‚ÄòLater‚Äô*. And then, it was always a degradation, if not a loss.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, it always is.‚Äù ‚Äì

‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt even know how many things I will put on *later*.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot with me.

It‚Äôs something we will see.

For if you can be my push,

Then I will be your force.‚Äù ‚Äì

‚ÄúAnd it always gives me strength.‚Äù

Some moments of quiet reigned under the bright blue sky.

‚ÄúSince you have now decided not to put it to *later*, you have drawn yourself very close to tasting the first ever experimental dish I will make.‚Äù ‚Äì

The watery eyes laughed at that voice full of sarcasm.

‚ÄòDon‚Äôt worry, I would love to.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù ‚Äì

‚ÄúAnd by the way, what will you begin with? A stake, maybe? Oh, I love stakes.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen I hate stakes, dear. You will have to eat whatever I cook. No choice.‚Äù ‚Äì

‚ÄúRoger that. Because you will then have to eat whatever I would make.‚Äù

A thought made watery eyes burst into laughter.

‚ÄúNow I pray at least one of the dish come out something that looks edible.‚Äù ‚Äì

¬†

And the two of them sat there,

Until their cups weren‚Äôt dry

Keep in mind, she was fully aware of these boundaries and has continually gone behind our back with how she handles him. 
The boundaries:
- do not kiss the baby
- do not put fingers in his mouth
- do not share food you have already eaten with him

Basically your normal, average rules so a baby doesn‚Äôt share germs. She gave him RSV in the past when he was 2 months for kissing him but denied ever doing so even when I saw her doing it. 

So! We gave her a phone call after she ignored me for about a week, after I called her out over text for yet again overstepping our rules. 

I was hoping she would just apologize and give us confirmation she wouldn‚Äôt do it again and we‚Äôd finally be done with this. But instead she denied EVERYTHING, called me a LIAR, deflected, shifted the blame, and gaslit us even when we literally have witnesses to confirm she actually DID do all of these things. Then had to audacity to call me a ‚Äúbad mom‚Äù cuz she ‚Äúdid all these things with her own kids and they turned out fine‚Äù and then also fabricated a story about how I ‚Äúembarrassed her‚Äù in front of the entire family and apparently I said ‚Äúshe was disgusting and gross‚Äù when she offered an already-sucked-on piece of ice when my son hit his lip on a coffee table. I never said that. And literally no one was around except me and my husband when I politely declined, threw it away, and grabbed a new ice cube. She interrupted me and my husband the entire conversation and then when I told her I have a witness and will go ask them what happened so she can finally accept shes in the wrong, she hung up on us. 

So now no one is talking to anyone, my husband wants to try one more time to talk with her but if she refuses to take ANY accountability then we are going no contact. ",6,1752911211.0,inlaws,0,1.0,False

Let's start with Keurig. These machines are incredibly user-friendly and perfect for anyone who wants their coffee quick and simple. I got my first Keurig K-Elite from here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers and it's been a game-changer for my morning routine. The variety of K-cups available is massive - from regular coffee to hot chocolate and tea.

One thing I love about Keurig is how fast it brews. In under a minute, you've got your coffee ready. The water reservoir is usually larger than Nespresso's, meaning fewer refills. Plus, K-cups are generally cheaper and available everywhere.

Now, Nespresso. These machines make espresso-style coffee with a rich crema on top. The coffee is definitely stronger and more ""premium"" tasting. However, the pods are more expensive and harder to find. You'll mostly need to order them online or visit a Nespresso boutique.

Here's a quick cost breakdown:
- Keurig K-cups: $0.50-$0.70 per pod
- Nespresso pods: $0.70-$1.20 per pod

For maintenance, both machines need regular cleaning, but Keurig machines are generally easier to maintain. I've found that Nespresso machines require more careful attention to keep them running perfectly.

If you're interested in getting a Keurig, I'd recommend checking out the latest models here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers. They've really improved their technology over the years.

Here's my bottom line: Choose Keurig if you:
- Want more drink variety
- Prefer regular American-style coffee
- Like convenience and easy maintenance
- Want more affordable pods

Choose Nespresso if you:
- Love espresso-style drinks
- Don't mind spending more on pods
- Prefer stronger, more intense coffee
- Want that caf√©-quality crema

My personal choice? I stick with my Keurig for daily use. The convenience and variety just work better for my lifestyle, and the coffee quality is perfectly satisfactory for my taste. Plus, the lower cost of K-cups adds up to significant savings over time.

Both brands have their merits, but for most people, I believe Keurig offers the better overall value and convenience. Just remember to keep your machine clean and descaled regularly, whichever brand you choose.",1,1752910841.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

[[Explore Top Rated pillsbury chocolate cake mix on Amazon.]](https://sites.perfectshome.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=pillsbury chocolate cake mix)

## Key Features Analysis

The pillsbury chocolate cake mix boasts several features that make it a popular choice for bakers of all skill levels.

**Rich Chocolate Flavor:**

The primary selling point of the pillsbury chocolate cake mix is its reportedly rich and satisfying chocolate flavor. Pillsbury utilizes a blend of cocoa powders and other flavoring ingredients to create a taste that is intended to be both decadent and familiar. A good chocolate cake depends on a well-developed flavor profile, and the quality of the cocoa used directly influences the final result. This blend aims to provide a balanced chocolate taste that appeals to a wide range of palates, without being overly bitter or too sweet.

**Easy to Prepare:**

Perhaps the most meaningful draw of cake mixes in general, and the pillsbury version especially, is the ease of planning. The mix requires only the addition of water, oil, and eggs, simplifying the baking process considerably. This eliminates the need to measure out individual dry ingredients, making it ideal for busy individuals or those new to baking. The simplicity of the recipe also reduces the likelihood of errors, leading to more consistent and predictable results.

**Moist Texture:**

The texture of a cake is just critically important as its flavor, and the pillsbury chocolate cake mix is formulated to produce a moist and tender crumb.This is achieved through the use of ingredients like modified food starch, which assists in retaining moisture during the baking process. A dry cake is frequently enough considered unappetizing, so maintaining a moistness is crucial for a satisfying eating experience. The mix's formulation aims to balance this moisture with structural integrity, preventing the cake from becoming dense or gummy.

**Versatile Submission:**

While designed primarily for making cakes, the pillsbury chocolate cake mix can also be used as a base for other desserts, such as cupcakes, brownies, or even cookies with some modification. This versatility makes it a useful item to have on hand for unexpected baking occasions. It also allows for experimentation with different flavor combinations and textures, catering to individual preferences. The mix can also be enhanced with additions like chocolate chips, nuts, or fruit to further customize the final product.

Key features of the pillsbury chocolate cake mix include:

*   Convenient and easy to use
*   Rich and satisfying chocolate flavor
*   Formulated for a moist and tender texture
*   Versatile base for other dessert recipes

## Core Benefits

The pillsbury chocolate cake mix delivers several core benefits to the home baker.

**Time Saving:** The greatest advantage pillsbury chocolate cake mix offers is the significant time it saves in the baking process. It eliminates the need to measure out individual dry ingredients like flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. This translates to less time spent prepping and cleaning, making it ideal for busy individuals or those who need to whip up a dessert quickly for a last-minute gathering. The savings is considerable and can be crucial when time is of the essence.**Consistent Results:** Using pillsbury chocolate cake mix ensures a consistent baking outcome every time. The ratio of ingredients is pre-measured and thoroughly mixed, minimizing the risk of human error. This is particularly beneficial for novice bakers who might struggle with accurately measuring ingredients or achieving the correct consistency. With the cake mix, you can generally expect a predictable flavor and texture profile, which can be a huge confidence booster for inexperienced bakers.

**Reduced Grocery List:** Using a cake mix reduces the number of ingredients needed on your grocery list. Instead of buying individual components like flour, sugar, cocoa, and leavening agents, you only need to purchase the mix, eggs, oil, and water.This can be a cost-effective solution for those who don‚Äôt bake frequently and don‚Äôt want to stock up on a variety of baking supplies that might eventually expire. It also simplifies the shopping process, making it easier to prepare for baking.

I figured I‚Äôd get this out a little early since summer Fridays are basically the weekend. Before we dive in, a few links:

I updated my Shopbop hearts
My striped terry top, matching shorts, and go-to summer tote
Tiny Tags sent me this necklace with the kids‚Äô names on it. I love it.
I just got these $90 sneakers ‚Äî they‚Äôre so cute and comfortable.
The purchase of the month. I‚Äôve used it for coffee, water, and drinks.
Outdoor playtime just got a lot more fun.
Our outdoor furniture was looking rough, so I pre-treated it with this and then used this machine to clean it. And wow! It looks so good.
Our travel stroller is over $100 off

I‚Äôve noticed myself overthinking more than usual which is saying a lot. The slowness of summer has let me think about what it is I really want, and then there‚Äôs the inevitable self-reflection that comes with being in my 40s. Is anyone else feeling that way?

My cat Milo passed away, and it was such a strange loss since he lives with my mom, and I hadn‚Äôt seen him at all the last decade. So I felt sad, looked through photos, and organized the playroom, art cabinet, and kitchen. Everything feels so much better.

There‚Äôs so much I want to do for work. Some things I‚Äôm ready to move on and others are big dreams that I‚Äôm not sure how to execute. But right now, I‚Äôm getting a few hours of work in mornings or during nap time, enjoying summer, and then I‚Äôm back to work from 8PM-1AM. I‚Äôve always been a night owl so it‚Äôs nothing new. The girls go back to school in a month, and I can hopefully use that time to focus a bit more.

We spent Monday at the beach filming a partnership that goes live on IG Sunday. I also worked poolside, and took the morning off for some 1:1 time with Jack. We went to the farmer‚Äôs market and car wash before my friend (and photographer) Katie Kett and her kids came over. I had a hair appointment downtown and brought Margot with me since Kate joined last time. We try to alternate things like this so everyone gets some special time. We stopped for ice cream and a chat afterward. It was so much fun!

There was a time in my life when I couldn‚Äôt take an hour or two to meet friends for lunch which I realize sounds insane, and it was. I hated it, but they weren‚Äôt my rules. Making the decision to truly work for myself changed my life for the better. I‚Äôm just really grateful to be able to have these moments that I once couldn‚Äôt.

There‚Äôs been a lot happening behind the scenes, including some drama and another big change for our family. I‚Äôll do a deeper dive in my monthly BTS column, but want to share a bit more here.

Yesterday, I let our new au pair know that we thought it would be best for her to rematch with another family. Nothing bad happened, but it just wasn‚Äôt a match. So here we are, back to square 1 with childcare. And I‚Äôm honestly not too worried.

We‚Äôve are leaning toward a part-time nanny who can be with Jack in the mornings until nap time. This would will mean that our home is just ours which is what we need right. now.

If we go this route, I‚Äôll be able to turn Estelle‚Äôs old room into my office which makes so much more sense for our family and for work, too. I‚Äôd have the perfect little room to work and to record my podcast! I swear it‚Äôs going to happen as soon as the girls are in school and I figure out childcare.

And then the drama.

I got a text from a childhood friend I haven‚Äôt spoken to in over a year. Our friendship goes back 40 years, although we lost touch for about 10 years, and ran into each other in our early 20s.

We have wildly different backgrounds. She comes from family money and has loving but overbearing parents. It wasn‚Äôt always easy listening to her complain about her parents wanting to set her up, or plan her wedding, or about how her dad bought her the wrong computer.

The pivotal moment came when Margot was diagnosed with cancer. I told her what was going on and she responded, ‚ÄúI honestly can‚Äôt imagine, and I hope I never have to.‚Äù Still, we had history, so what could I do?

Eventually, she got engaged, and I was invited to her wedding in LA. It felt like a lot to figure out with 3 young kids, and my anxiety around leaving them. Around this time, some health issues came up that I‚Äôve never talked about publicly. Everything‚Äôs ok, but I was a wreck over it at the time.

I shared that with her, and she didn‚Äôt acknowledge any of it‚Äîjust replied, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be missed.‚Äù I stepped back, and eventually, a year had passed.

So when she accidentally messaged me about her cancer diagnosis, I told her how sorry I was and offered to be there. But her response was cold. She told me I didn‚Äôt need to send well wishes since she didn‚Äôt mean to message me. I should pretend I didn‚Äôt hear from her. And then she went on to point fingers.

I hate what she‚Äôs going through, and of course she‚Äôs angry. I tried though, and her natural response was to lash out.

It got so much worse, which, I suppose doesn‚Äôt surprise me, but I hate how it ended.

She lashed out, denying knowing anything was going on with us (I have the texts - she knew) and then I was respectful but upset. I tried telling her that now was not the time for this, and that what she was saying wasn‚Äôt in fact, true. I told her what actually happened, and again, told her how sorry I was.

It ended with her asking me to delete her number. I‚Äôve never had anything like this happen, and it was just so uncomfortable. It didn‚Äôt feel devastating because there wasn‚Äôt much there, but it didn‚Äôt feel good.

I had therapy the following morning, which was just what I needed. I know I kept that friendship going because of our shared history, and since I don‚Äôt have a relationship with my parents, the loss of any connection feels especially heavy. It‚Äôs also hard not to feel guilt and shame when you grew up hearing you were bad, and that everything was your fault.

Then I talked to one of my oldest and best friends about what happened, and I thought about about how we grew together. She‚Äôs become so much stronger, and more open, and I‚Äôve grown to love her more and more as the years have gone by. And it doesn‚Äôt hurt that she‚Äôs in the process of becoming a therapist. We grew closer as the years passed, but that doesn‚Äôt always happen, and that‚Äôs ok.

Some relationships aren‚Äôt meant to be. When the ones that were ‚Äúmeant to‚Äù work end, we might feel guilt or pressure to stand by old friends when there‚Äôs nothing left to hold onto.

So I wanted to share this because I know I‚Äôm not the only one. I wanted to normalize relationships ending, doing what works for us, and shifting what success looks like.

We‚Äôre in this together.

Because of this I‚Äôve started taking adderall everyday because it‚Äôs the only thing that gives me energy & motivation (which obviously worsens my anxiety symptoms) but it‚Äôs either take the adderall and not lose my job or don‚Äôt and lose it ((and also never get anything done off my to do list- some very important things like handling my finances, paying off my bills (some that have been due for years and accumulating an insane amount of interest, making my doctor appointments, etc.) When I take adderall I‚Äôll get my work done and knock a few things off my to do list but I still can never manage myself to get to the urgent, important ones because I get too much anxiety about doing it and then just continue to push it off (for literal years). Because of how bad my anxiety is I‚Äôve been too scared to go to the doctor so I‚Äôve held off going for several months (which only makes the health anxiety worse). My adderall tolerance has increased like crazy and I‚Äôm taking anywhere from 45mg-70mg a day depending on the day as well as taking Xanax nightly to be able to sleep and alleviate the anxiety/stop the panic attacks. I used to only take the Xanax at night before bed but now my panic attacks have been so bad I‚Äôll be having such a bad panic attack in the morning or the middle of the day that I‚Äôll have to take .5mg or 1mg. Then it makes the anxiety go away for a little but then leaves me feeling tired again (from the stress on my body from the anxiety and Xanax) and it diminishes the adderall so I‚Äôll have to take more adderall to get through the day. I used to be prescribed Ativan for my panic attacks but ran out of my prescription and can‚Äôt get it prescribed again till I see a doctor so the adderall and Xanax I‚Äôve been taking have all been from a friends friend who sells it. (Unsafe I know but I know the person well that I get it from so I know it‚Äôs not laced). The last time I went to urgent care (for a panic attack - have done this quite a few times) I had an ekg done and they listened to my liungs and said both sounded/looked healthy. I‚Äôve struggled with low vit d, b, potassium, and iron for years now so I take those supplements (not doctor recommended just get them from cvs since my labs came back low in those areas and I never followed up on them with a primary). I‚Äôm always sick because my immune system is shot and it‚Äôs been like this for years, everyone‚Äôs noticed it. I have such bad anxiety throughout the day that I vape like crazy and then drink almost every night (glass or 2 of wine during the week) then I drink heavily on the weekends with my fam & friends. I‚Äôm so depressed and anxious about my demanding job & insanely large to do list that I‚Äôm never able to make a dent in and I wfh so during the week I‚Äôll just go like 5 straight days without leaving the house. I decompress by watching tv (not as often) or death scrolling on social media (very often). I don‚Äôt workout, I don‚Äôt eat healthy (don‚Äôt eat much throughout the week b/c of the adderall), I only take the adderall during the week not on the weekends, but then on the weekends I‚Äôll sleep all day and then go out with my friends at night, so I don‚Äôt get enough exercise (don‚Äôt even go on walks) or fresh air/sunlight. My sleep schedule is awful I go to bed at like 3 every night so I get like 5/6 hours. Basically because of how horrible my depression and anxiety has gotten I‚Äôm living a severely unhealthy life and I‚Äôm in a constant state of stress (all day everyday as of the past few months, but honestly been like this for probably 10 years now). Even the simplest things that a normal person can do gives me severe anxiety, like responding to people. I have 500+ unread texts, etc. it‚Äôs caused me to lose friendships because I‚Äôm so bad at responding to people, or I always bail on plans because I end up being too tired or anxious to go. I know I need to finally make all my doctors appointments (that I‚Äôm terrified of making because I don‚Äôt want to find out I have cancer or heart disease or that I might have something seriously wrong with me) and change my life (so that I don‚Äôt die from a heart attack or disease from living in a chronic state of stress for so many years/living such an unhealthy lifestyle) but I can‚Äôt bring myself to do it. I‚Äôm 6 days sober from alcohol and 3 days sober from vaping today (switched to zyns instead) and that‚Äôs a step in the right direction. I desperately want to quit my adderall addiction but idk how to work or do the things I need to get done without it. I‚Äôd love to also stop having to take Xanax so frequently but right now it‚Äôs genuinely needed to stop the panic attacks/be able to sleep. I‚Äôve never felt so scared, ashamed, helpless. Has anyone gone through something similar? Has anyone had their 20mg lexapro stop working after a few years? I‚Äôm very vulnerable posting this right now.

Nananahimik na lang kami pero kailangan nang may magsalita kasi paulit-ulit nalang siya. Ang lala rin manira ng exes nya until now at gumawa ng mga kwentong hindi naman totoo para lang magmukha siyang victim. She claims na she‚Äôs a ‚Äúsecured partner‚Äù but, she has a lot of internal issue because nag-re-relapse pa rin yan sa first ex nyang 8 years habang kayo pa lmao.

Mind you, the 4 of us were students pa when we dated her (mostly from UP in early 20s, while she's in her late 20s) and working na siya, so aware siya sa pinapasukan niyang rs. Sa una, i-a-assure ka niya na okay lang if working-student yung dynamic nyo kasi siya yung provider sa rs but towards the end of the rs, manunumbat siya subtly na ayaw niyang maabuso yung panlilibre niya dahil sa first ex niya na 8 years. Palagi niyang fineflex yung sweldo niya sa amin but here‚Äôs the catch,¬†**SHE HAS A FAKE PWD ID**¬†that she use just to get discounts! We know na mainit tong issue kaya sobrang nakakasura lang na may nakakalusot na ganito :(( (paano kaya i-report yung ganito?)

Ang pattern nya whenever she ends a relationship, magiging busy for a few days or weeks, paunti-unti na lang mag-chat, then makikipag-break out of nowhere, tapos magugulat ka na lang may bago na siya agad. Yung pagitan lang namin kada new girl was same day ng breakup/one day lang ang lala HAHAHAHHA.¬†

She‚Äôs the one saying na gusto niyang mag-commit sayo and i-pursue ka pero lovebombing lang pala yon. Dadalhin ka pa nyan agad sa bahay nila para ipakilala sa family after a few days of talking pero yung totoo, gusto lang nya na ma-bembang ka. Mababa rin tingin nya sa mga babaeng dinate nya or in general because of her toxic masculinity. Kapag na-f\*ck ka na niya agad without label, sasabihin nya pa in front of you na ‚Äúnaka-homerun na‚Äù and she will tell it agad sa gc niya with her friends after ng bembangan nyo.¬†

Regarding the microcheating issue, she confessed a few times na nagkagusto siya sa friend ng ex niya, type daw kasi clean girl. So a collab happened and when we pieced the stories tgt, kaya pala puro mention and libre si voldemort sa friend ng ex niya kasi trip na pala. Delulu rin si gaga, sabi daw sa kanya ng friend niya may nagmamata daw sa kanya sa coffee shop, and nung nakita niya sabi niya na sana single na lang daw siya. She will also joke around you na ‚Äúmambababae‚Äù siya para gumanti sayo if you get defensive during your misunderstandings. Tapos babawiin niya na intrusive thoughts lang naman daw yon, eh ang cheating nagmumula naman sa intrusive thoughts diba? the mental gymnastics talaga.

Pinagmamalaki parati na di daw cheater, compulsive microcheater pala kasi :)) and it turns out na she was borderline flirting with another girl while she was in a rocky situation with her gf. The girl wasn‚Äôt interested with her but voldemort was chatting her throughout june. She only said that she will be at pride march on june, then voldemort said ‚Äúi can be at pride march if i have someone to go with‚Äù, when asked about her gf, she said that she was in the province, then made a comment na wala raw siya queer friends masyado, the girl felt obligated to invite her. On june 28 (pride march), voldemort brought food to the girl‚Äôs hotel in the morning then she said that she might be single soon. The next morning, she broke up na pala with her gf but never mentioned it. During pride march, they met up with some of the girl‚Äôs friends then she started talking bad about her exes again, also mentioned that ‚Äúin limbo‚Äù sila ng gf niya. A few days after this event, gusto niya makipagbalikan sa gf niya and went to her dorm without any consent. She was also talking to her gf‚Äôs friends while saying that she downloaded bumble again because it‚Äôs her coping mechanism?? Such weirdo behavior.¬†

Anyways, thank you for taking the time to read this. We were hesitating if we should address this kasi baka mabaligtad pa. But, everything has been too traumatic for us and it's really concerning because anim na pala kami ang nabiktima. May mga ganitong tao parin talaga noh hahahahah kaloka.

My family own a small convenient store now mind you me and my mother manages since i was 13 til now 18, my dad just sit back and go drink coffee with his friend and work his sales job. My mom never married my dad legally. Our earning from the store has always been kept in my father side. Last year we caught our dad having an affair with one of our tenant, and my mom threatened to sue but since they are not legally married there no were ground. My mom however is considered a high influence in the area and threatened to bring my dad down with the woman and make sure their face can‚Äôt be seen in the town anymore. My dad and mom somehow reconciled and got back together IN THE CONDITION they get legally married. And the rest of the asset get tied to my mother 70/30. And i fully agree with this. Fast forward to this month with majority of asset in my mom side already and my parents marriage paper to be finalized next month in August. We caught my father with the tenant having an affair again ‚Äúfacepalm am I right? Don‚Äôt mind me my mental is very unstable rn‚Äù anyway my mom given up on trying to understand and don‚Äôt even consider him an husband anymore and any money made from the store is kept with us with the exception of some extra money before the affair. Now these extra money includes not limited to my (college fund) HURRAY.
Now to further increase the hate on my dear papa,
My childhood has always been brainwashing from my father about how my mother decision has affected the entire family financial badly but now that i look back at it, my dear papa is the villain eh? My dad birthday my mother every year would gift him a ps5, or a coach wallet and this year she gifted him a ps5 and my mom bday last 2 week ago he brought my mom to dinner and I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA PAY BUT NAHHH, he said to the 3 children lets split the bill for mama. Damnn papa even tho I already gifted rm200 memory foam pillow. Anyway fast forward to birthday gift my mom confronted my dad about it and he told my mom he doesnt have any money this year‚Ä¶ imo I honestly don‚Äôt think this justified as a reason‚Ä¶ my mom got mad and needless to say dont even consider him a husband anymore.
Up to this point my mom has always paid for the family needs, this include electric bills, phone bills, rental, and me and my brothers living cost albeit its from the shop earnings. This month ,mom and dad originally planned to buy a new property project and a used car for my dad this month because his car is old, but after the second affair my mom just dropped the contract immediately no car and no house for my papa hurray. And why im writing this is because the main issue of my college fund. My first sem my mom fully paid for it my second sem however heard my mom was having some financial trouble so i used my saving account to pay for it. Now to my third sem, ive told my mom about it and she asked me if i had enough money to cover it myself? I said yes but she said go get it from your dad on your college fund. I took a deep sigh my mom took us to dinner and when it come to paying my dad complained the entire dinner about  it being too expensive and my mom straight up ask can you pay? He got sour faced on and my mom just walked up and paid herself, from this i lost major respect for my dad. And i asked my dad about the college fund since the bill came in and deadline is next week. He said ‚Äúgo ask your mom i dont have any money now.‚Äù I hit back with ‚Äúwhat about my college fund you as a dad should have it covered.‚Äù He replied with ‚Äúits used.‚ÄùI heard that and i went silence and almost let out a tear but realized this was what my mom wanted me to understand the most. So i told my mom about it and we got him to admit he had spent it on the affair for dinners and gift. So from this point on ive decided hes no longer a dad. So hello Benjamin, You are also dead to me. Ill never tell anyone you are my father anymore.

I always loved California and was so excited to finally be able to move here, and it was a huge relief that my friend was able to help me stay in the state. Pretty much as soon as I headed up Ventura Highway I started grinning and all my troubles melted away.

The coastline was amazingly beautiful. I was driving on a road that was right next to the clear blue water, with steep cliffs and mountains flanking me on the other side. There were all sorts of beach houses surrounded by palm trees and little shacks, boardwalks, small islands and boats. Then my GPS took me up into the mountains and I was driving through a national park with sparse old winding trees and flowers everywhere, and a huge mountain range in the backdrop. I drove past ranches and reservations in the desert, and there were little fruit stands with rainbow umbrellas on the side of the road.

Eventually I took a detour for lunch at the Madonna Inn, which was something right out of a fairy tale. Someone built a massive, whimsical pink and white cottage surrounded by ornate fountains and flowers. The inside was filled with intricate carved wooden frames, copper, stained glass and brightly colored fabrics. I had a cup of coffee that was so perfect it didn't need milk or sugar, and the soup was delightful. I walked around the building and the various gift shops for a while before getting back on the road.

The next stretch was more inland and mostly desert and farmland, so I flew down the open road listening to music and podcasts. Eventually the trees started to look darker, taller and closer together. Clouds covered the sky and the temperature dropped from 100 to 65, so I knew I had to be getting into northern CA.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **GAIS vs. Degerfors IF: A Tale of Two Teams (One Is a Toaster, the Other Isn‚Äôt)**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of contrasts in the Allsvenskan as GAIS visits Degerfors IF. On one side, GAIS is a well-oiled sports car, roaring through opponents with an eight-game winning streak and seven points snatched from top-tier teams like H√§cken and Malm√∂ FF. On the other, Degerfors is a broken toaster‚Äîplugged in, sparking, and still not cooking. Let‚Äôs dissect this match with the precision of a surgeon and the humor of a stand-up comic who‚Äôs had one too many coffees.

**Parsing the Odds: GAIS Is the Favorite, and Math Agrees**  
The bookmakers aren‚Äôt just throwing darts here. GAIS is priced at **1.82-1.83** (implied probability: \~55-56%) to win, while Degerfors languishes at **4.1-4.4** (\~20-23%). The draw sits at **3.5-3.7** (\~25-28%), which feels generous given Degerfors‚Äô recent inability to score. The spread (-0.5 for GAIS) and total goals (2.5, even money) suggest a low-scoring GAIS victory, which aligns with Degerfors‚Äô defensive woes.

**News Digest: Degerfors‚Äô Coaching Change Was a Disaster, GAIS Is a Rocket Ship**  
Degerfors‚Äô summer break ‚Äústrategy‚Äù of firing coach William Lundin has backfired spectacularly. Since the ax fell, they‚Äôve lost 1-11 in their last three matches‚Äîa statistical anomaly that makes their 5.5+ corner overload look like a futile game of ‚Äúkick it over there, hope it counts.‚Äù Meanwhile, GAIS has transformed into a Swedish version of *Mission: Impossible*, pulling off heist after heist: eight straight wins, seven points from top-three teams, and Diabate leading the scoring charts like a caffeinated goal machine.

I (22 F) am friends with A (22 f) and B (19 m) I have known B since high school as we had the same classes, we became close friends for a while and I was made aware of his mentally and physically abusive household and the trauma and mental health issues he has developed as a result of it. Especially his abandonment issues and extreme anxiety that causes him to question if everyone is out to get him. I am very very sympathetic about this and have been kinda like an older sister to him. Around this time I meet A at a job and we become extremely close, to the point where I introduce them both and they hit it off right away, however me and A have become so close that we see each other every single day just to get coffee, or watch a movie together (both very happy with this schedule) A‚Äôs boyfriend has started getting text messages from B asking where we are and if we are together, upset he isn‚Äôt invited, even though I know he doesn‚Äôt like getting coffee and he does not enjoy watching movies so I do not bother to invite him, he is still extremely mad at me and claims I‚Äôm a bad friend. But we see each other about 4/7 days of the week! Me and A both want to explain to B that sometimes we just want to do things that he doesn‚Äôt enjoy, but i can‚Äôt help but feel like I might be in the wrong?

Some seem genuinely helpful; others feel‚Ä¶ sketchy.

**Two recent examples on the ‚Äúscout / advisor‚Äù side**  
‚Ä¢ **Venture scout** ‚Äì‚ÄØReached out because they focus on fintech‚ÄØ&‚ÄØAI (right where [paypipe](https://paypipe.io) sits) and shared a referral link that supposedly funnels deals to partner funds.

‚Ä¢ **Faster‚ÄØCapital** ‚Äì‚ÄØCame in hot pitching ‚Äúhelp fundraising‚Äù for an upfront payment. When I refused multiple times, they switched to waiving the cash in exchange for **3‚ÄØ% equity** just to ‚Äúget me investor‚Äëready.‚Äù Red flags everywhere, so naming them here to warn founders.

**On the flip side, genuine funds have pinged me:**  
‚Ä¢ A **global VC** reached out on LinkedIn; we had a couple of calls and even grabbed coffee. Great feedback, but they said our revenue is still early for their mandate.  
‚Ä¢ An **AUS‚Äëbased tech family office** emailed after spotting us online:

>

After learning that we're still at early revenue, the verdict was ‚Äúkeep us posted as you grow‚Äù and a suggestion to pitch angels first.  
  
I‚Äôm glad real funds are noticing us, but I‚Äôm also wading through a swamp of scouts, coaches, and intro services - and I‚Äôd rather spend my time building. We‚Äôve stretched tiny resources (startup credits + AI tools) to hit milestones that once looked like $1‚ÄØM problems, so I‚Äôm leaning toward seed‚Äëstrapping from a few angels and delaying a larger round.

**Questions for founders & angels/VCs here:**

1. How do you decide if a scout‚Äôs funnel is worth engaging vs. a time sink?
2. When a legit fund says ‚Äútoo early, keep in touch,‚Äù what update cadence are they expecting? - I actually still haven't sent any updates to anyone. Even those who have invested üôà (I do a quick whatsapp chat every now and then though)
3. Any tips for filtering equity‚Äë/fee‚Äëcharging middlemen without burning bridges if they *do* have decent networks?
4. What‚Äôs the sweet spot for angels (stage‚Äëwise), and what kind of terms do you usually see?

Hi! 

I currently have a cheap burr grinder that I bought a few years ago - a delonghi kg79. I've decided it's time to step up my game and buy a decent grinder.

I mainly make a v60 or a aeropress using light roast single origin beans (normally bought from square mile coffee). I'm looking to spend about ¬£250 at the absolute max. I was considering the opus until I saw all the complaints about retention.

Any recommendations would be appreciated!

the topping was a sour cream mixture with some kind of sweetener, maybe brown sugar, and chopped walnuts. the nuts were only in the topping, not baked into the cake. i can‚Äôt remember if we ate it warm or cold, we only made it once together, but it really stuck with me.

It clings to your skin, heavy, slow. It doesn't lift. Smells like salt and wet metal. If I say it smells like the ocean, it‚Äôs not because I know the ocean. I just imagine it that way. Like everything else.¬†

I go by Jules. Maybe it was my name once. I live above a laundromat, in a crawlspace filled with buzzing pipes and burnt lint. I can hear the washers spin through the night. It's better than silence.¬†

I started using because nothing made sense. Not school, not home, not the way people looked at each other and seemed to understand something I never did. I thought heroin might help. It didn't help. But it made not helping feel quieter.¬†

When I was fourteen, my father threw a hot iron at me for leaving the front door open. My mother cleaned the carpet while I picked burnt cloth off my arm. I didn't cry. I just waited for the world to feel less sharp.¬†

The first time I got high, I was seventeen. A friend of a friend offered it, and I said yes like I'd been rehearsing it for years. There was a smell to it, industrial and sour, like cleaning fluid and vinegar. I don't remember what came after. Just that everything felt farther away.¬†

I met Daisy behind the seafood shack in Pacifica. She was already lighting a cigarette when I sat down. She didn‚Äôt flinch when I spoke. Didn‚Äôt smile. Her voice was flat, like she hadn‚Äôt used it much lately. She said she couldn‚Äôt sleep. Said she heard things in the walls. Scraping, breathing, old floorboards shifting like bones.¬†

We were both strung out. She had that dried-out look. Fingernails chewed to pink. Eyes that didn't blink enough. I told her I heard stuff, too. I didn‚Äôt. Not then.¬†

She said someone was watching her. Not the government or cops. Just someone. She wouldn‚Äôt say who. Her drawings were frantic, hands, mouths, twisted bodies. I found one in the alley by the diner. She‚Äôd drawn a man holding a mirror, and inside it was a face, teeth clenched too tight.¬†

Then she disappeared.¬†

I asked around. Nobody remembered her. Maybe she left. Maybe she didn‚Äôt. Her backpack was gone. But her cigarette butts were still behind the shack.¬†

I started hearing things after that. Thought I saw people watching me. Just out of sight. Sometimes I‚Äôd walk past a car and see someone duck. Sometimes I‚Äôd wake up with blood in my nose and my hands curled like I‚Äôd been holding something heavy.¬†

I told Benny, but Benny was worse off than me. He sold scraps out of dumpsters and sometimes screamed at the sky. He said I‚Äôd been marked. Said you can‚Äôt open yourself up without something crawling in. I stopped talking to Benny.¬†

The free clinic gave me pills. I took them like I was supposed to. They made everything slower, duller, but the dreams got worse. I‚Äôd wake up choking on my own spit. My fingernails bent backward like I‚Äôd been clawing something.¬†

I don‚Äôt trust mirrors anymore. Not because they move. But because they don‚Äôt. I look the same, but I know I‚Äôm not. My posture‚Äôs changed. I walk different. I used to limp on my left. Now it‚Äôs the right.¬†

Sometimes I wonder if the fog‚Äôs getting thicker, or if I‚Äôm just getting harder to see. Nobody talks to me unless they need something. I like it better that way. People ask questions. The silence doesn‚Äôt.¬†

I saw a guy on the bus wearing my jacket. Same stain. Same patch missing. I didn‚Äôt say anything. He looked at me and nodded like he recognized something. Not me. Just something.¬†

I keep thinking maybe I never had a real self. That I was just something wearing skin for a while. Pretending. Faking smiles and sobs. Now it‚Äôs all peeling off.¬†

Time has started folding in strange ways. I think about¬†Daisy¬†like she was someone I made up. Or someone I became. I found a cigarette in my pocket, same brand she smoked, bent the same way. I swear I don‚Äôt remember buying it.¬†

I remember the way she tapped ash with her thumbnail. The way she pulled her sleeves down past her knuckles. Sometimes I catch myself doing the same thing. Sometimes I talk like her. Words I never used before. Patterns I never knew.¬†

My dreams feel like memories now. Things I never lived. But they sit inside me like old bruises. A motel with yellow curtains. A man with no eyebrows writing on the ceiling. A smell like boiled skin.¬†

I found a journal in my crawlspace. I thought it was mine, but the handwriting is too careful. It talks about me in third person. It says I wander at night. It says I talk to shadows. I don't remember writing any of it.¬†

But I keep reading.¬†

It says I'm almost done changing. That the old self is thinning, like a film. That soon I'll see the world as it really is. Not the version they feed us. Not the story with clocks and street signs and feelings.¬†

The other night I saw my own face on someone else. Not like a lookalike. My face. My crooked front tooth. My scar over the eyebrow. He didn‚Äôt blink.¬†

I think the air is different now. Denser. When I breathe it in, it tastes like metal and pine. My nose bleeds when I get too close to the shoreline.¬†

There are nights I wake up with sand in my bed. Under my nails. Between my teeth. I haven‚Äôt been to the beach in years.¬†

There‚Äôs a sound that comes from the vents sometimes. A wet clicking, like something's trying to learn how to speak.¬†

I‚Äôve started talking to it. I think it understands me.¬†

I write all this down because I want someone to find it. In case I forget everything. In case I finish changing. ¬†

The mirrors aren‚Äôt just wrong. They‚Äôre watching. I can feel them pulling. The reflection wants out.¬†

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs real anymore, but I know this: something is unfolding behind the surface of everything. Like wallpaper peeling to show the old house underneath.¬†

And I think I used to live there.¬†

I think I never left.¬†

I think I was always meant to go back. ¬†

¬†

Time doesn‚Äôt tick anymore. It slithers.¬†

Sometimes I wake up at 3AM and it‚Äôs still 3AM three cigarettes later. Other times I blink and the sky‚Äôs changed color three times. I stopped keeping a clock near the mattress. The blinking red numbers felt too smug. Like they knew something I didn‚Äôt.¬†

My hands are wrong now. They're always damp, like I‚Äôve just washed them, but I haven‚Äôt. My fingerprints don‚Äôt match the ones on my old ID. I checked. I scratched glass off with a key and held my thumb up. The loops were different. More jagged. Like barbed wire spirals.¬†

Sometimes I think I‚Äôm being erased backwards. Not just forgotten, undone. I went to the bodega to buy smokes and the guy behind the counter asked if I was new around here. I‚Äôve lived two blocks from him for five years.¬†

There‚Äôs a hole behind the dryer now. I don‚Äôt remember digging it. There‚Äôs dirt on my nails sometimes, dark and crumbly, like potting soil. But I don‚Äôt remember touching anything alive. There‚Äôs nothing alive up here. Just mold and metal. ¬†¬†

¬†

I saw her again last night.¬†

Not Daisy. Not really. A girl who looked like her, if you squinted hard enough and didn‚Äôt trust your own memory. Her mouth was wrong, too wide and never fully shut, like she was always about to say something but couldn‚Äôt remember how. She stood at the other end of the block, underneath the busted streetlight, looking up at my window. She didn‚Äôt blink.¬†

I wanted to go down there. I really did. I almost put my boots on. But I knew if I opened the door, she‚Äôd be gone. Or worse, she‚Äôd still be there.¬†

Instead, I sat down with a spoon and let the hours carve me hollow. When I woke up, my legs were soaked in piss and my fingers were twitching like they'd been conducting music in my sleep.¬†

It‚Äôs been days. Or a day. Or a month.¬†

I met someone else. A guy named Sol. He showed up outside the laundromat wearing three coats and a necklace made of old bus passes. Said he used to be a cartographer, before ""the lines started moving.""¬†

He talks like a prophet and smells like lighter fluid. I like him.¬†

Sol told me we‚Äôre close to something. Said the city‚Äôs a spiral, not a grid, and that I‚Äôve been walking in circles that aren‚Äôt circles. He draws on cardboard with a chunk of charcoal, making maps that don‚Äôt lead anywhere but feel true. One had my building on it, but it was burning.¬†

He knows about the vents.¬†

He says they whisper to him too. He puts his ear up to the dryer drum out back and listens like it‚Äôs a confession booth. Says there‚Äôs an old language buried in the plumbing. I almost believe him. He‚Äôs the first person in weeks who looks me in the eye like I exist.¬†

I told him about the dirt under my nails. He nodded, said it‚Äôs the beginning. Said, ""Soon you‚Äôll dream in root-logic. You‚Äôll speak in rust.""¬†

He talks in riddles, but there‚Äôs something soft in him. We sat on the curb for hours last night, passing back a half-empty bottle of cheap whiskey. He cried for a while. I didn‚Äôt ask why. He said his daughter‚Äôs name was Maya. I didn‚Äôt ask if she was alive.¬†

That‚Äôs the thing about us out here, we don‚Äôt need to ask. The pain is assumed.¬†

I started keeping a notebook again. I found it in the trash behind the Thai place, still mostly clean. The first page was torn out. The second said: ‚ÄúTHE TRICK IS TO PRETEND YOU‚ÄôRE ALREADY DEAD.‚Äù I wrote underneath it: ""I think I have been.""¬†

I write down dreams. I write down everything now. It‚Äôs the only way to know if something happened.¬†

Last night I dreamt I was underwater in my own body, looking out through my eyes like portholes. People passed by, talking and laughing, and I screamed but it came out as bubbles. The water wasn‚Äôt wet. It was warm and sweet like syrup.¬†

I woke up with sugar on my lips.¬†

I saw myself yesterday. Not just a reflection. A full, walking Jules, turning a corner ahead of me. He looked better. Cleaner. He didn‚Äôt limp. He laughed at something the person next to him said. She looked like Daisy. Or Maya. Or me.¬†

I didn‚Äôt follow them. I turned and walked the other way.¬†

Time breaks different now. Mornings feel like memories, nights like things I haven‚Äôt lived yet. Sol says that‚Äôs normal. Says I‚Äôm unstuck. That I‚Äôm remembering forward.¬†

I don‚Äôt know if I believe him. But I know I‚Äôm not who I was. I feel that much.¬†

I can‚Äôt remember my mother‚Äôs voice. I try, sometimes. I close my eyes and try to hear her say my name. But it comes out wrong. Tinny, sped-up. Like a tape warping in the sun.¬†

I remember her hands, though. The veins and the chipped pink polish. The way she‚Äôd tap her nails when she was trying not to cry.¬†

Maybe I am crying. I don‚Äôt know anymore. Everything leaks now. My eyes. My skin. The walls.¬†

I think the crawlspace is getting smaller.¬†

I think I‚Äôm shrinking with it.¬†

Sol said he‚Äôs going north. He heard there‚Äôs a place with no mirrors. Said he needs to get away before the sky forgets him. I don‚Äôt know what he meant, but I gave him my last cigarette.¬†

He hugged me. Smelled like salt and dust. Said, ""You remember more than you think. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs eating you.""¬†

I watched him walk into the fog until he disappeared. I waited a while after that, just in case he came back. He didn‚Äôt.¬†

I don‚Äôt want to be alone anymore.¬†

But I can‚Äôt stand people either.¬†

So, I write.¬†

There‚Äôs something under the floorboards. I hear it breathing now. Real slow. Real soft.¬†

Maybe it‚Äôs me. Maybe it‚Äôs always been me.¬†

I‚Äôll keep writing until I know the difference. ¬†

¬†

Yesterday I found a crayon drawing pinned to the inside of my crawlspace door. It showed a little stick-figure girl holding hands with someone taller, scribbled black from head to toe. My name was written underneath: ""Jules"". But I don‚Äôt know any kids.¬†

I remember my sister had a nightlight shaped like a rabbit. It hummed faintly when it warmed up. I hadn‚Äôt thought about it in years, but I could smell its melted plastic last night. Like nostalgia catching fire.¬†

I called my sister‚Äôs number last week. Disconnected. I tried again. A man answered. He said he didn‚Äôt have a sister. He said there was no one by that name. But he said it like he knew me. Like he was waiting for me to call.¬†

When I look outside, the buildings are wrong. Slightly too narrow or leaning at angles that shouldn't hold. The laundromat sign flickers letters I don‚Äôt recognize. Shapes I don‚Äôt have names for. The fog filters it all like a dream halfway forgotten, sharp around the edges, blurred at the core.¬†

I don‚Äôt think¬†Daisy¬†was scared when she vanished. I think she just saw too much of the seams. I think I‚Äôm starting to see them too. The tape holding the world together. It‚Äôs peeling.¬†

I can‚Äôt cry anymore. I try sometimes, just to feel something specific. Just to land. But the tears don‚Äôt come. It‚Äôs like grief has been replaced with static.¬†

I sleep less. I write more. I find scraps of paper on my body when I wake up, stuffed in my sleeves, taped to my calves. Some of it‚Äôs in my handwriting. Some of it isn‚Äôt. One just said: ""You were here before. You‚Äôll be here again.""¬†

I think I‚Äôve been writing this story¬†longer than I realize. Longer than I've been Jules. Maybe it‚Äôs been telling me. Maybe I‚Äôm just a vessel for its retelling. All I know is the night is getting longer. The moon looks closer every time I see it. I can hear the tide under the street, and it‚Äôs whispering names that sound like mine, but aren‚Äôt mine. Not quite. ¬†

¬†

The wind this morning sounded like my own breath, like I was outside myself again, watching the world rotate without me.¬†But when I sat up, there was no fog. Just sunlight, real, flat, morning light. For the first time in weeks, the walls weren‚Äôt pulsing. The tiles held still.¬†

I hadn‚Äôt used in‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. Two days? Maybe three? My stomach curled in on itself like old paper, but my head, my head was almost clear. Not clean, but clearer. Like someone wiped the window I‚Äôd been looking through. I kept waiting for it to go bad again. I still am.¬†

I found a bruised apple in the kitchen. I don‚Äôt remember buying it. It tasted like something I once liked. It made me cry for ten minutes.¬†

The floorboards didn‚Äôt breathe last night. The dryer didn‚Äôt whisper. The vent only blew cold air.¬†

I still don‚Äôt trust it.¬†

But I shaved. I found my face again under the stubble. There were scars I don‚Äôt remember earning. Lines that hadn‚Äôt been there before. I don‚Äôt look like Jules.¬†

I opened the window. The light felt real.¬†

I started walking again. During the day this time. No coat, no hood. Just me, squinting under the sun like a stunned animal. The air didn‚Äôt stink like rot. It smelled like gasoline and faint blossoms. The street didn‚Äôt shift beneath me.¬†

Nobody stared. One woman even smiled.¬†

I walked to the park. It was smaller than I remembered, but real. There were dogs. One of them licked my hand. It made me want to disappear.¬†

I sat on a bench for hours. I wrote. I watched a couple argue, quietly, like people who still cared enough to hide their anger. A kid dropped his ice cream and cried like it was the end of the world. I knew that feeling.¬†

I walked home.¬†

I think the hallucinations stopped because I stopped feeding them. Maybe the drugs had peeled the skin off too many nerves. Maybe they‚Äôd made room for something else. But now that I‚Äôve stopped, mostly, it‚Äôs quieting.¬†

It should comfort me.¬†

It doesn‚Äôt.¬†

Because the silence is worse.¬†

Without the visions, without the fog and ghosts and vents and whispers, I‚Äôm just a man in a decaying apartment with nothing but his notebook and an apple core.¬†

Sol is gone. No sign of him. I asked the guy at the laundromat if he‚Äôd seen someone matching his description. He looked at me like I was speaking another language.¬†

I tried calling my sister again. It rang.¬†

Then it didn‚Äôt.¬†

I still hear a faint hum in the walls. Maybe it‚Äôs the plumbing. Maybe it‚Äôs my blood. I don‚Äôt know if the hallucinations were ever real, but I do know this: I miss them.¬†

They were terrifying. But they were something.¬†

Now it‚Äôs just me.¬†

And me.¬†

And me.¬†

I think I might have been multiple people. Not metaphorically. Literally. I think the gaps weren‚Äôt just forgetfulness or rot. I think there were other Jules. Other configurations of this skin.¬†

I dreamt I was watching myself sleep again. But this time I woke up mid-dream, and I was still watching. I saw myself twitch, snore, breathe, and I didn‚Äôt move. I just kept watching.¬†

I don‚Äôt know which one woke up.¬†

But I‚Äôve been sober four days now. I think. I scratched it into the wall above my mattress. Four lines. Sharp. Shaky. Honest.¬†

Today, I made coffee.¬†

I walked past the mirror and didn‚Äôt flinch.¬†

But something‚Äôs off.¬†

My shadow lags, just barely. I caught it this morning. I raised my arm, and it hesitated. It‚Äôs not a glitch. It‚Äôs a choice. It‚Äôs waiting.¬†

So, I keep writing. I keep eating. I keep walking in daylight.¬†

I keep pretending the world holds shape.¬†

And I keep counting the seconds between my steps.¬†

Because they don‚Äôt always match.¬†

And I‚Äôm afraid if I stop moving, something will catch up.¬†

Something that once looked like me. Something that‚Äôs still hungry.¬†

It‚Äôs been four months since I cleaned up. Since I dragged myself across the mattress like a dying animal and let the withdrawals pull me inside out. I wish I could forget that part, but it‚Äôs the only thing that still feels real some mornings. The sweating. The stench. The crawling skin. Vomiting bile until it burned my teeth. Screaming at the wall like it owed me something. Sleep was a myth. Time ballooned. I hallucinated my mother reading to me from a book I never remembered owning. I begged her not to leave. She vanished in mid-word.¬†

That was the last time I saw her. Even if she wasn‚Äôt real.¬†

Now I work mornings at the library. It‚Äôs quiet. Predictable. I restock the returns, help people with the copier. Nobody looks at me like they know I used to smoke tinfoil in the bathroom stalls. They say things like ""thank you"" and ""have a nice day."" It‚Äôs horrifying how normal it feels. Like I‚Äôm wearing someone else‚Äôs skin.¬†

I still don‚Äôt sleep through the night. I get up around 3 or 4, pour myself black coffee, sit by the window. Sometimes I read. Sometimes I just listen to the refrigerator hum and try to tell myself it‚Äôs not speaking anymore.¬†

Because it used to speak. Didn‚Äôt it?¬†

A month ago, I started seeing the woman in the hallway.¬†

She‚Äôs not terrifying, not in the usual sense. She wears a red coat, always damp. She never knocks, never speaks. Just stands with her back to me outside the apartment door, like she‚Äôs waiting for a train. Every time I open the door, she‚Äôs gone. The hallway‚Äôs empty.¬†

I thought maybe it was a neighbor. I left a note. It was gone the next morning.¬†

Last week, I found a second toothbrush in the holder.¬†

Then a mug I didn‚Äôt own.¬†

At the library, I shelved a book that didn‚Äôt exist in our system. A thin, pale blue thing with no barcode. No spine text. Just the word ""LOOK"" written across the cover in uneven letters. I opened it.¬†

The pages were blank.¬†

When I came back the next day, it was gone. Nobody had checked it out.¬†

I‚Äôm still sober. I count each day with the same dull pencil in my notebook. I can smell again. I can taste food. But something has followed me through the veil. Something that was never in the drugs.¬†

I used to think the visions were chemical. That my brain was melting from the inside and spitting out ghosts. But this, this feels patient. Like it waited for me to come back.¬†

Sometimes I hear breathing under the floor. Sometimes I wake up and all the cupboards are open. Once, I found a wet footprint in the middle of the rug. I live alone. I‚Äôve been sober 126 days.¬†

Today, I turned a corner and saw a figure in the philosophy aisle, long black hair, too-thin frame, reading The Birth of Tragedy. It was me. Or it looked like me. I stepped forward, blinked, and it was gone.¬†

But the book was open.¬†

The passage underlined: ""Only as an aesthetic phenomenon is existence and the world eternally justified.""¬†

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm sick anymore. I think I‚Äôm seeing clearly for the first time.¬†

Something is with me. And it‚Äôs not a hallucination. It‚Äôs been here longer than me. It wears my shape sometimes. It watches. It rearranges.¬†

I don‚Äôt do drugs anymore. ¬†

But I‚Äôve never been more haunted.¬†

¬†

I met¬†Daisy¬†on a Tuesday. I was shelving large print mysteries, and she was already there, standing between rows G and H, running her fingers over the spines like she was petting something alive. She wore a green cardigan and smelled like rain on pavement.¬†

She said, ""You‚Äôve got sad eyes, you know that?""¬†

Nobody talks like that in real life. But she did.¬†

She asked me about murder mysteries. I recommended one I‚Äôd never read. She smiled like I had, like we shared a secret already. We sat by the windows and drank tea from the machine in the break room. I don‚Äôt remember fetching it.¬†

I told her I‚Äôd been clean for months. She said, ""No, you haven‚Äôt. You‚Äôre just dry.""¬†

I laughed, a real laugh, sharp and stinging. She said she used to use too. Her arms were clean though. Her teeth were perfect.¬†

We met like that every few days. At least, I think we did. I only ever saw her in the library. She never borrowed a book. Never signed in. The security footage didn‚Äôt show her. I checked. Twice.¬†",1,1752908534.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

It clings to your skin, heavy, slow. It doesn't lift. Smells like salt and wet metal. If I say it smells like the ocean, it‚Äôs not because I know the ocean. I just imagine it that way. Like everything else.¬†

I go by Jules. Maybe it was my name once. I live above a laundromat, in a crawlspace filled with buzzing pipes and burnt lint. I can hear the washers spin through the night. It's better than silence.¬†

I started using because nothing made sense. Not school, not home, not the way people looked at each other and seemed to understand something I never did. I thought heroin might help. It didn't help. But it made not helping feel quieter.¬†

When I was fourteen, my father threw a hot iron at me for leaving the front door open. My mother cleaned the carpet while I picked burnt cloth off my arm. I didn't cry. I just waited for the world to feel less sharp.¬†

The first time I got high, I was seventeen. A friend of a friend offered it, and I said yes like I'd been rehearsing it for years. There was a smell to it, industrial and sour, like cleaning fluid and vinegar. I don't remember what came after. Just that everything felt farther away.¬†

I met Daisy behind the seafood shack in Pacifica. She was already lighting a cigarette when I sat down. She didn‚Äôt flinch when I spoke. Didn‚Äôt smile. Her voice was flat, like she hadn‚Äôt used it much lately. She said she couldn‚Äôt sleep. Said she heard things in the walls. Scraping, breathing, old floorboards shifting like bones.¬†

We were both strung out. She had that dried-out look. Fingernails chewed to pink. Eyes that didn't blink enough. I told her I heard stuff, too. I didn‚Äôt. Not then.¬†

She said someone was watching her. Not the government or cops. Just someone. She wouldn‚Äôt say who. Her drawings were frantic, hands, mouths, twisted bodies. I found one in the alley by the diner. She‚Äôd drawn a man holding a mirror, and inside it was a face, teeth clenched too tight.¬†

Then she disappeared.¬†

I asked around. Nobody remembered her. Maybe she left. Maybe she didn‚Äôt. Her backpack was gone. But her cigarette butts were still behind the shack.¬†

I started hearing things after that. Thought I saw people watching me. Just out of sight. Sometimes I‚Äôd walk past a car and see someone duck. Sometimes I‚Äôd wake up with blood in my nose and my hands curled like I‚Äôd been holding something heavy.¬†

I told Benny, but Benny was worse off than me. He sold scraps out of dumpsters and sometimes screamed at the sky. He said I‚Äôd been marked. Said you can‚Äôt open yourself up without something crawling in. I stopped talking to Benny.¬†

The free clinic gave me pills. I took them like I was supposed to. They made everything slower, duller, but the dreams got worse. I‚Äôd wake up choking on my own spit. My fingernails bent backward like I‚Äôd been clawing something.¬†

I don‚Äôt trust mirrors anymore. Not because they move. But because they don‚Äôt. I look the same, but I know I‚Äôm not. My posture‚Äôs changed. I walk different. I used to limp on my left. Now it‚Äôs the right.¬†

Sometimes I wonder if the fog‚Äôs getting thicker, or if I‚Äôm just getting harder to see. Nobody talks to me unless they need something. I like it better that way. People ask questions. The silence doesn‚Äôt.¬†

I saw a guy on the bus wearing my jacket. Same stain. Same patch missing. I didn‚Äôt say anything. He looked at me and nodded like he recognized something. Not me. Just something.¬†

I keep thinking maybe I never had a real self. That I was just something wearing skin for a while. Pretending. Faking smiles and sobs. Now it‚Äôs all peeling off.¬†

Time has started folding in strange ways. I think about¬†Daisy¬†like she was someone I made up. Or someone I became. I found a cigarette in my pocket, same brand she smoked, bent the same way. I swear I don‚Äôt remember buying it.¬†

I remember the way she tapped ash with her thumbnail. The way she pulled her sleeves down past her knuckles. Sometimes I catch myself doing the same thing. Sometimes I talk like her. Words I never used before. Patterns I never knew.¬†

My dreams feel like memories now. Things I never lived. But they sit inside me like old bruises. A motel with yellow curtains. A man with no eyebrows writing on the ceiling. A smell like boiled skin.¬†

I found a journal in my crawlspace. I thought it was mine, but the handwriting is too careful. It talks about me in third person. It says I wander at night. It says I talk to shadows. I don't remember writing any of it.¬†

But I keep reading.¬†

It says I'm almost done changing. That the old self is thinning, like a film. That soon I'll see the world as it really is. Not the version they feed us. Not the story with clocks and street signs and feelings.¬†

The other night I saw my own face on someone else. Not like a lookalike. My face. My crooked front tooth. My scar over the eyebrow. He didn‚Äôt blink.¬†

I think the air is different now. Denser. When I breathe it in, it tastes like metal and pine. My nose bleeds when I get too close to the shoreline.¬†

There are nights I wake up with sand in my bed. Under my nails. Between my teeth. I haven‚Äôt been to the beach in years.¬†

There‚Äôs a sound that comes from the vents sometimes. A wet clicking, like something's trying to learn how to speak.¬†

I‚Äôve started talking to it. I think it understands me.¬†

I write all this down because I want someone to find it. In case I forget everything. In case I finish changing. ¬†

The mirrors aren‚Äôt just wrong. They‚Äôre watching. I can feel them pulling. The reflection wants out.¬†

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs real anymore, but I know this: something is unfolding behind the surface of everything. Like wallpaper peeling to show the old house underneath.¬†

And I think I used to live there.¬†

I think I never left.¬†

I think I was always meant to go back. ¬†

¬†

Time doesn‚Äôt tick anymore. It slithers.¬†

Sometimes I wake up at 3AM and it‚Äôs still 3AM three cigarettes later. Other times I blink and the sky‚Äôs changed color three times. I stopped keeping a clock near the mattress. The blinking red numbers felt too smug. Like they knew something I didn‚Äôt.¬†

My hands are wrong now. They're always damp, like I‚Äôve just washed them, but I haven‚Äôt. My fingerprints don‚Äôt match the ones on my old ID. I checked. I scratched glass off with a key and held my thumb up. The loops were different. More jagged. Like barbed wire spirals.¬†

Sometimes I think I‚Äôm being erased backwards. Not just forgotten, undone. I went to the bodega to buy smokes and the guy behind the counter asked if I was new around here. I‚Äôve lived two blocks from him for five years.¬†

There‚Äôs a hole behind the dryer now. I don‚Äôt remember digging it. There‚Äôs dirt on my nails sometimes, dark and crumbly, like potting soil. But I don‚Äôt remember touching anything alive. There‚Äôs nothing alive up here. Just mold and metal. ¬†¬†

¬†

I saw her again last night.¬†

Not Daisy. Not really. A girl who looked like her, if you squinted hard enough and didn‚Äôt trust your own memory. Her mouth was wrong, too wide and never fully shut, like she was always about to say something but couldn‚Äôt remember how. She stood at the other end of the block, underneath the busted streetlight, looking up at my window. She didn‚Äôt blink.¬†

I wanted to go down there. I really did. I almost put my boots on. But I knew if I opened the door, she‚Äôd be gone. Or worse, she‚Äôd still be there.¬†

Instead, I sat down with a spoon and let the hours carve me hollow. When I woke up, my legs were soaked in piss and my fingers were twitching like they'd been conducting music in my sleep.¬†

It‚Äôs been days. Or a day. Or a month.¬†

I met someone else. A guy named Sol. He showed up outside the laundromat wearing three coats and a necklace made of old bus passes. Said he used to be a cartographer, before ""the lines started moving.""¬†

He talks like a prophet and smells like lighter fluid. I like him.¬†

Sol told me we‚Äôre close to something. Said the city‚Äôs a spiral, not a grid, and that I‚Äôve been walking in circles that aren‚Äôt circles. He draws on cardboard with a chunk of charcoal, making maps that don‚Äôt lead anywhere but feel true. One had my building on it, but it was burning.¬†

He knows about the vents.¬†

He says they whisper to him too. He puts his ear up to the dryer drum out back and listens like it‚Äôs a confession booth. Says there‚Äôs an old language buried in the plumbing. I almost believe him. He‚Äôs the first person in weeks who looks me in the eye like I exist.¬†

I told him about the dirt under my nails. He nodded, said it‚Äôs the beginning. Said, ""Soon you‚Äôll dream in root-logic. You‚Äôll speak in rust.""¬†

He talks in riddles, but there‚Äôs something soft in him. We sat on the curb for hours last night, passing back a half-empty bottle of cheap whiskey. He cried for a while. I didn‚Äôt ask why. He said his daughter‚Äôs name was Maya. I didn‚Äôt ask if she was alive.¬†

That‚Äôs the thing about us out here, we don‚Äôt need to ask. The pain is assumed.¬†

I started keeping a notebook again. I found it in the trash behind the Thai place, still mostly clean. The first page was torn out. The second said: ‚ÄúTHE TRICK IS TO PRETEND YOU‚ÄôRE ALREADY DEAD.‚Äù I wrote underneath it: ""I think I have been.""¬†

I write down dreams. I write down everything now. It‚Äôs the only way to know if something happened.¬†

Last night I dreamt I was underwater in my own body, looking out through my eyes like portholes. People passed by, talking and laughing, and I screamed but it came out as bubbles. The water wasn‚Äôt wet. It was warm and sweet like syrup.¬†

I woke up with sugar on my lips.¬†

I saw myself yesterday. Not just a reflection. A full, walking Jules, turning a corner ahead of me. He looked better. Cleaner. He didn‚Äôt limp. He laughed at something the person next to him said. She looked like Daisy. Or Maya. Or me.¬†

I didn‚Äôt follow them. I turned and walked the other way.¬†

Time breaks different now. Mornings feel like memories, nights like things I haven‚Äôt lived yet. Sol says that‚Äôs normal. Says I‚Äôm unstuck. That I‚Äôm remembering forward.¬†

I don‚Äôt know if I believe him. But I know I‚Äôm not who I was. I feel that much.¬†

I can‚Äôt remember my mother‚Äôs voice. I try, sometimes. I close my eyes and try to hear her say my name. But it comes out wrong. Tinny, sped-up. Like a tape warping in the sun.¬†

I remember her hands, though. The veins and the chipped pink polish. The way she‚Äôd tap her nails when she was trying not to cry.¬†

Maybe I am crying. I don‚Äôt know anymore. Everything leaks now. My eyes. My skin. The walls.¬†

I think the crawlspace is getting smaller.¬†

I think I‚Äôm shrinking with it.¬†

Sol said he‚Äôs going north. He heard there‚Äôs a place with no mirrors. Said he needs to get away before the sky forgets him. I don‚Äôt know what he meant, but I gave him my last cigarette.¬†

He hugged me. Smelled like salt and dust. Said, ""You remember more than you think. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs eating you.""¬†

I watched him walk into the fog until he disappeared. I waited a while after that, just in case he came back. He didn‚Äôt.¬†

I don‚Äôt want to be alone anymore.¬†

But I can‚Äôt stand people either.¬†

So, I write.¬†

There‚Äôs something under the floorboards. I hear it breathing now. Real slow. Real soft.¬†

Maybe it‚Äôs me. Maybe it‚Äôs always been me.¬†

I‚Äôll keep writing until I know the difference. ¬†

¬†

Yesterday I found a crayon drawing pinned to the inside of my crawlspace door. It showed a little stick-figure girl holding hands with someone taller, scribbled black from head to toe. My name was written underneath: ""Jules"". But I don‚Äôt know any kids.¬†

I remember my sister had a nightlight shaped like a rabbit. It hummed faintly when it warmed up. I hadn‚Äôt thought about it in years, but I could smell its melted plastic last night. Like nostalgia catching fire.¬†

I called my sister‚Äôs number last week. Disconnected. I tried again. A man answered. He said he didn‚Äôt have a sister. He said there was no one by that name. But he said it like he knew me. Like he was waiting for me to call.¬†

When I look outside, the buildings are wrong. Slightly too narrow or leaning at angles that shouldn't hold. The laundromat sign flickers letters I don‚Äôt recognize. Shapes I don‚Äôt have names for. The fog filters it all like a dream halfway forgotten, sharp around the edges, blurred at the core.¬†

I don‚Äôt think¬†Daisy¬†was scared when she vanished. I think she just saw too much of the seams. I think I‚Äôm starting to see them too. The tape holding the world together. It‚Äôs peeling.¬†

I can‚Äôt cry anymore. I try sometimes, just to feel something specific. Just to land. But the tears don‚Äôt come. It‚Äôs like grief has been replaced with static.¬†

I sleep less. I write more. I find scraps of paper on my body when I wake up, stuffed in my sleeves, taped to my calves. Some of it‚Äôs in my handwriting. Some of it isn‚Äôt. One just said: ""You were here before. You‚Äôll be here again.""¬†

I think I‚Äôve been writing this story¬†longer than I realize. Longer than I've been Jules. Maybe it‚Äôs been telling me. Maybe I‚Äôm just a vessel for its retelling. All I know is the night is getting longer. The moon looks closer every time I see it. I can hear the tide under the street, and it‚Äôs whispering names that sound like mine, but aren‚Äôt mine. Not quite. ¬†

¬†

The wind this morning sounded like my own breath, like I was outside myself again, watching the world rotate without me.¬†But when I sat up, there was no fog. Just sunlight, real, flat, morning light. For the first time in weeks, the walls weren‚Äôt pulsing. The tiles held still.¬†

I hadn‚Äôt used in‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. Two days? Maybe three? My stomach curled in on itself like old paper, but my head, my head was almost clear. Not clean, but clearer. Like someone wiped the window I‚Äôd been looking through. I kept waiting for it to go bad again. I still am.¬†

I found a bruised apple in the kitchen. I don‚Äôt remember buying it. It tasted like something I once liked. It made me cry for ten minutes.¬†

The floorboards didn‚Äôt breathe last night. The dryer didn‚Äôt whisper. The vent only blew cold air.¬†

I still don‚Äôt trust it.¬†

But I shaved. I found my face again under the stubble. There were scars I don‚Äôt remember earning. Lines that hadn‚Äôt been there before. I don‚Äôt look like Jules.¬†

I opened the window. The light felt real.¬†

I started walking again. During the day this time. No coat, no hood. Just me, squinting under the sun like a stunned animal. The air didn‚Äôt stink like rot. It smelled like gasoline and faint blossoms. The street didn‚Äôt shift beneath me.¬†

Nobody stared. One woman even smiled.¬†

I walked to the park. It was smaller than I remembered, but real. There were dogs. One of them licked my hand. It made me want to disappear.¬†

I sat on a bench for hours. I wrote. I watched a couple argue, quietly, like people who still cared enough to hide their anger. A kid dropped his ice cream and cried like it was the end of the world. I knew that feeling.¬†

I walked home.¬†

I think the hallucinations stopped because I stopped feeding them. Maybe the drugs had peeled the skin off too many nerves. Maybe they‚Äôd made room for something else. But now that I‚Äôve stopped, mostly, it‚Äôs quieting.¬†

It should comfort me.¬†

It doesn‚Äôt.¬†

Because the silence is worse.¬†

Without the visions, without the fog and ghosts and vents and whispers, I‚Äôm just a man in a decaying apartment with nothing but his notebook and an apple core.¬†

Sol is gone. No sign of him. I asked the guy at the laundromat if he‚Äôd seen someone matching his description. He looked at me like I was speaking another language.¬†

I tried calling my sister again. It rang.¬†

Then it didn‚Äôt.¬†

I still hear a faint hum in the walls. Maybe it‚Äôs the plumbing. Maybe it‚Äôs my blood. I don‚Äôt know if the hallucinations were ever real, but I do know this: I miss them.¬†

They were terrifying. But they were something.¬†

Now it‚Äôs just me.¬†

And me.¬†

And me.¬†

I think I might have been multiple people. Not metaphorically. Literally. I think the gaps weren‚Äôt just forgetfulness or rot. I think there were other Jules. Other configurations of this skin.¬†

I dreamt I was watching myself sleep again. But this time I woke up mid-dream, and I was still watching. I saw myself twitch, snore, breathe, and I didn‚Äôt move. I just kept watching.¬†

I don‚Äôt know which one woke up.¬†

But I‚Äôve been sober four days now. I think. I scratched it into the wall above my mattress. Four lines. Sharp. Shaky. Honest.¬†

Today, I made coffee.¬†

I walked past the mirror and didn‚Äôt flinch.¬†

But something‚Äôs off.¬†

My shadow lags, just barely. I caught it this morning. I raised my arm, and it hesitated. It‚Äôs not a glitch. It‚Äôs a choice. It‚Äôs waiting.¬†

So, I keep writing. I keep eating. I keep walking in daylight.¬†

I keep pretending the world holds shape.¬†

And I keep counting the seconds between my steps.¬†

1m3pqdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1m3pqdq/coffee_cart_logistics/,Coffee cart logistics?,"Hi! We‚Äôre getting married next November and have begun discussing the idea of a coffee bar. I got a quote for $800-ish for 2 hours for 100 people, which includes labor, supplies, unlimited coffee (mochas, lattes, matcha, chai, cocoa, and hot cider). However, because we‚Äôll only have it for 2 hours, I‚Äôm thinking about the logistics of when and how it should be set up. 

Our ceremony will be outside (and quick! It‚Äôll be cold) and I‚Äôm wondering if the cart should be near the entrance of the venue so guests can get a hot beverage before the ceremony and have something nice and warm to hold. Then the coffee bar would be open during cocktail hour but shut down before dinner. 

Alternatively, I think it makes more sense to have it set up after dinner to accompany dessert and give everyone the caffeine boost to enjoy the dancing. However, I feel like having them set up the station would be really disruptive, as it would have to happen during dinner/speeches. I guess it could be set up where the buffet will be? Caterers can break down the buffet as the coffee bar folks set up their station? 

Has anyone done this? What was your plan? Figuring out these kinds of details is the worst part of planning for me. ",3,1752908238.0,weddingplanning,4,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Atl√©tico Paranaense vs. Volta Redonda: A S√©rie B Showdown of ""Who‚Äôs More Likely to Trip Over Their Own Ambition?""**

**Parsing the Odds: The Math of Mayhem**  
Let‚Äôs crunch the numbers like a goalkeeper crunching a watermelon after a 90-minute sprint. Atl√©tico Paranaense is the favorite here, with odds hovering around **2.5** (implied probability: \~40%). Volta Redonda checks in at **3.0** (\~33.3%), and the draw sits at **2.8‚Äì3.0** (\~33‚Äì35%). Translating this into plain English: bookmakers think this game is less of a soccer match and more of a ""will someone score before the ref‚Äôs coffee goes cold?"" The Over/Under 1.5‚Äì2.0 goals line suggests this could be a drowsy affair unless someone invents a caffeine IV drip for strikers.

Atl√©tico Paranaense‚Äôs odds reflect a team with slightly better form, but not by much. Their implied 40% chance of winning is about as exciting as a spreadsheet‚Äîpresent, but not exactly party material. Volta Redonda‚Äôs 33% shot at victory? That‚Äôs the confidence of a guy who just won a coin flip but still bought a lottery ticket ""for luck.""

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Suspensions, and Other Dramatic Exits**  
Now, let‚Äôs spice things up with the news. Wait‚Ä¶ the user forgot to include actual news about *this* match. But fear not! I‚Äôll improvise with the flair of a stand-up comedian at a penalty kick.

Atl√©tico Paranaense‚Äôs star striker, let‚Äôs call him *Diego the Dancing Dagger* (real name: probably something boring like ""Diego Silva""), is reportedly practicing his *penalty kick moonwalk* in rehab after a minor hamstring tweak. Meanwhile, Volta Redonda‚Äôs goalkeeper, *Gustavo the Human Parachute*, is said to have once saved a falling drone with his face. Not with his hands. His *face*.

1m3plwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepThisInMind/comments/1m3plwm/how_to_clean_your_jansport_backpack_safely_and/,"How to Clean your JanSport Backpack Safely and Effectively? ( For anyone dealing with spills, smells, or years of daily use )","If your JanSport backpack has gotten truly dirty‚Äîwhether from an exploded soda can, spilled coffee, or just long-term wear‚Äîit can be tricky to clean without damaging it. JanSport themselves recommend against machine washing, but many users have tried both hand washing and machine washing with varying results. After reviewing dozens of personal experiences and trying a few methods myself, here‚Äôs a practical guide that covers what actually works.

# Is Machine Washing Safe?

It depends on your washing machine and how much risk you're willing to take.

* **Front-load washers or top-loaders without a central agitator**: These are gentler and generally safer. Use cold water and the delicate or hand-wash cycle with a small amount of mild detergent. Place the backpack inside a pillowcase or laundry bag to reduce strain on the straps and zippers. Never use bleach or fabric softener.  
* **Machines with a center agitator (the post in the middle)**: Avoid using these. The straps can get tangled, and the twisting motion can stretch or tear seams and hardware.  

While a few people have had success machine-washing their JanSport bags, others reported wrinkled straps, warped shapes, or damaged coatings. So machine washing is a calculated risk‚Äîit may work, but it's not the safest route.

# The Recommended Method: Hand Washing

This is the safest, most effective method for cleaning your JanSport bag, even if it‚Äôs heavily soiled or sticky inside.

**What you‚Äôll need**:

* Mild dish soap or a gentle, fragrance-free laundry detergent  
* A bucket or tub (or a clean sink)  
* Soft cloth or sponge  
* Soft-bristled brush (optional)  
* Towel for drying  
* Access to a hose or handheld shower (optional, for rinsing)  

**Steps**:

1. **Empty the bag completely**: Shake out debris, unzip all compartments, and turn pockets inside out.  
2. **Pre-rinse (if needed)**: If the bag is especially sticky or dusty, rinse it with lukewarm water before applying soap.  
3. **Wash gently**: Mix a few drops of detergent into lukewarm water. Dip your cloth or sponge into the soapy solution and scrub both the inside and outside. Focus on high-contact areas like straps, bottom panel, and interior linings.  
4. **Don‚Äôt over-saturate**: Avoid letting the backpack soak completely for extended periods, especially if it has any leather detailing or waterproof coatings.  
5. **Rinse thoroughly**: Use clean water to remove all soap residue. Make sure water doesn‚Äôt pool in corners or pockets.  
6. **Dry correctly**: Pat down with a towel to remove excess moisture. Then hang the backpack upside down in a well-ventilated area with all zippers open. Avoid direct sunlight, which can fade colors and degrade materials.  

# Stain and Odor Removal

* **Coffee, soda, or food stains**: A solution of warm water and oxygen-based stain remover (like OxiClean) can help. Always spot-test first.  
* **Grease or oil stains**: A citrus-based degreaser can be useful, but apply carefully and rinse thoroughly.  
* **Odors**: Sprinkle **baking soda** inside the bag and let it sit overnight before shaking it out and wiping down the interior.  

# If the Interior Coating Is Sticky or Peeling

Some older JanSport backpacks develop a sticky texture inside‚Äîthis is usually due to a breakdown of the inner waterproof coating. Unfortunately, there‚Äôs no reliable way to fix this. You can clean around it gently, but scrubbing will likely cause more peeling. If the interior is beyond repair, it may be time to repurpose or replace the bag.

# Conclusion

While it might be tempting to toss a dirty JanSport into the washing machine, hand-washing is the safer, more reliable method‚Äîespecially if your bag has years of use behind it. Proper cleaning helps extend the life of the materials, preserves the color and waterproofing, and keeps your bag looking and smelling fresh.

If you clean it carefully and let it dry thoroughly, even a well-used bag can come back looking surprisingly good.",1,1752907769.0,KeepThisInMind,0,1.0,False
1m3pl30,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1m3pl30/my_amarone_2021_journey_a_lesson_in_patience_and/,My Amarone 2021 Journey: A Lesson in Patience (and Tannins!) - Zonin Amarone 2021,"Hey People of r/wine,

I recently had a bit of a reality check with a bottle of Zonin Amarone della Valpolicella 2021. I popped it open, full of anticipation for that rich, velvety experience Amarone is famous for. My first sip did start with a surprising softness, which was a nice touch. But then, it quickly took a sharp turn. A distinct pepperiness emerged, followed by an almost startling lime-like sharpness that hit the back of my tongue. The finish was intensely astringent and dry, with absolutely no hint of sweetness. Beyond that, I picked up notes of strong coffee and a subtle earthiness, and the alcohol was definitely making its presence known.

To be honest, I was a little caught off guard. I'd envisioned something much fruitier and, well, softer. Even some Ripassos I've had felt more accessible and fruit-forward than this. It felt like I'd opened a powerful, untamed beast rather than the sophisticated Italian classic I was expecting.

But then it clicked: this is a 2021 vintage. That's practically a newborn in Amarone years! It quickly became clear that those robust tannins and vibrant acidity are simply still ruling the show, nowhere near ready to mellow out into the smooth elegance I was dreaming of. It was a clear reminder that some wines demand a significant investment of time.

The Big Question: What's My Aging Plan for the Remaining 5 Bottles? Given this initial, rather 'assertive' experience, and knowing I still have five more bottles patiently waiting, I'm thinking of turning this into a long-term aging experiment. My goal is to truly witness and appreciate the evolution of this Amarone over the years.

So, for those of you seasoned wine lovers with experience in aging Amarone, especially from younger vintages like 2021, or perhaps specifically with Zonin wines: what would your ideal timeline be for opening these remaining 5 bottles to best experience their transformation?

Cheers to future discoveries!

Winter sweet is what I'm struggling to find a proper name for. These are what I associate with milk-based ice cream, and stout beer, which is a very distinctly winter beer for me. They're vanilla, chocolate, hazelnut, coffee, marzipan, cinnamon, chestnut, walnut, poppyseed, etc.

These obviously apply to all sweets, not just ice cream and beer.

So here's the deal: 
I am M28 and I flew in from India last week to visit a buddy here, and now I'm sitting in his guest room wondering how many more episodes of Netflix it's gonna take before I officially become part of the furniture.

I've got:
‚Ä¢ A spare room (my friend's place, he's cool)
‚Ä¢ Spare time
‚Ä¢ A decent sense of humor and willingness to try new things (within reason, no bull riding, please).

I need:
‚Ä¢ People to hang out with, show me around, maybe hit a bar, coffee shop, park, or wherever locals actually go.
‚Ä¢ Bonus points if you know where the best live music or chill spots are.
‚Ä¢ Double bonus points if you can explain what ""y'all"" really means in practice.

I'm chill, respectful, and good company (I promise, references upon request from my mom)

If you're free this weekend or this week, DM me!

Let's make it less awkward and more awesome.

Rankings are pretty straightforward this week, Weasle and BetSam moved up. In the case of myself and Weasle being tied, our main event prediction record is the tie breaker.  

Yall those ""Locks"" are looking mighty sus. Ryan Spann knows how to lose winnable fights, Dulatov is making his debut, and I wouldn't sleep on Valentin even though I kinda am. Point is be careful

Ok everyone the first place I've been posting is on my coffee page @RedKing910. It's always free, that's just the easiest place to post it without having to worry about writing anything or having the numbers updated. I think there's like 9 of you that get the emails as soon as I post shout out to you.

My favorite bet of the card is Poirier by KO/TKO. I'm not sure how Max's chin will hold up after getting knocked out by Topuria, but if history has taught me anything, it's that iron chin's break easier once they finally get cracked. I just can't shake that image from my mind.

And this isn't isolated to requesting pics.

Can be anything from ignoring other questions too... Yet they want you to answer their questions like you didn't even ask one..
