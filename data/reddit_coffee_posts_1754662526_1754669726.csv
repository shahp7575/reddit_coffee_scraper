I hated it. I hated the gnarled twisted feeling in my gut when I wanted to help someone and I couldn’t. I hated it when I tried and I failed. I hated it more when I felt I was the reason someone I cared about in some way was hurt or in trouble.  
  
I felt useless. The Henderson family had their house locked up for the night, and may or may not have more people coming though the rest of the day to gather evidence. For better or worse I liked the elderly family that had taken me in. They were a good sound board, kind, and looked out for me in their own ways.  
  
That I had let the people go who later came for them was not forgivable. The Hendersons could forgive me, but it was not them I was answering to in my own head. An evil ignored was an evil endorsed.  
  
Tired as I was physically, I could not sleep. My old soldier brain woke up and went to bed at the same time every day, and unless I took active measures that was hard to change. More so, I wanted to do something. I needed to do something.  
  
Heading to the Guardian’s headquarters was not much, but it was something. The place stood a little outside of town, into the woods, and near the coast. It’s not hard to find though. You do not even need directions, just look up.  
  
The difference in technology between the standard person and the superhero organization was staggering in retrospect. You could tell whenever you dared to glance above the buildings around you.  
  
The Guardian’s headquarters was a blocky semi-circle in the middle of nowhere with two remarkable features. The first and most obvious was the fully functional space elevator. The second was an independent port with the potential for industrial level shipping.  
  
The level of funding they must have was staggering, and it became clearer the moment you stepped inside the grounds. Nearly a mile in all directions from them was cleared of any trees that were not incorporated into the grounds to be decorative. The ground was level in the clear areas and at the building itself, at a height to be perfectly level with the ocean port they built. The grass was immaculate and vibrant looking.  
  
The entire thing had two perimeter fences and a perimeter wall. The wall was between the two layers of fence, and when I went past it I could tell it was in and of itself a narrow building that surrounded the place, complete with interior halls and rooms, and stairs that let soldiers walk around the top of the wall using it as an elevated firing position if needed.  
  
Then there was the building itself. It looked more like a rich college campus building than a paramilitary structure controlled by the government and people with powers. There was more glass than stone, and you could see straight through the building in many areas.  
  
Even where I was sitting now did not really match. The interview room they had seated me in had a floor to ceiling window that looked out over the interior courtyard. The few hundred feet between myself and the anchor point of the space elevator tube was landscaped and filled with things for outdoor activities like courtyards for sports and barbecue pits. There were cherry blossom trees in full bloom, weeping willows, and oaks for shade.  
  
The room itself had some security aspects. There was a one way glass mirror for a wall adjacent to the window we had in the room. It seemed that most glass in the building could be made opaque with the tech they had so they did not feel the need to have curtains. In the middle of the room where I sat was a carved wooden table with comfortable chairs on either side of it.  
  
I hadn’t brought a lawyer with me. I likely should have but I just did not have the money. In place of that, it seemed The Guardians were uncomfortable that I did not have a guardian. Adult or not, I was male. So filling in that role valiantly was Pantheon.  
  
“Is it customary to make me wait this long?” I asked coolly. “If I didn't know better I would say I was in trouble and this was a way to break my nerve.”  
  
“Ouch kid. You make it sound like you do not like my company.” She said in a jovial sort of way. “They’ll be in. Like I said the other day it’s a day we are accepting applications, and we got a few so those are being handled.”  
  
My brow perked in interest at that. “How many?”  
  
“That’s about as classified as telling you that the girl you saved applied.” She said with a yawn.  
  
“Nessi?” I asked with curiosity.  
  
“Mhmm. She said she was not doing good at leading a gang and came here for training. On one hand, kudos for her being brave enough to be so honest, on the other hand stupid for being so honest.”  
  
I shrugged a little at that. I didn't really expect guile from Nessi. The level at which she lacked it was a little surprising though.  
  
“I suppose that is not surprising. Recruit her and you can probably change her mind easily enough that she does not choose to try and go villain.”  
  
“That was about what we think. Her next two years in the junior guardians should pan that out well enough.”  
  
I perked both brows at her and she answered my body language with words. “I figure you should know given if you join us you could end up in charge of her. The Juniors that do not live with their parents live here. You can visit her on the grounds if you like.”  
  
“Later maybe. Honestly I am not sure I would have anything to say.” My words were firm, and perhaps a little dismissive. I had chosen to save Nessi, once from another and again from herself. It was up to her to sink or swim now.  
  
“You sound like an old woman when you speak like that. It does not suit you.” A more gentle tone had taken over her voice.  
  
“I am more mature than I look. That is a good thing.” I shook my head and looked out of the window, sipping at the coffee they had provided for me when I had come in to start.  
  
“No Gabe, it’s not. I know you’ve been through a lot. The day you got your powers-”  
  
“Is not, and likely never will be up for discussion.” My words were more harsh than I would like them to be. It was another case where an old mind conflicted with young emotions. No, that was a lie. I was hurt. Being experienced or mature would not change that.  
  
“It’s been six years. You need to talk about it some time. Everyone’s tried to give you space, but if it’s never going to not be too soon, then there is no reason to put it off.” Again gentle words. It was starting to make me angry just how many people treated me like I was a paper doll, like the slightest mishandling would destroy me.  
  
“What happened, happened. It is what it is. I have moved on.”  
  
Pantheon looked about ready to speak again, but thankfully there was a knock at the door. A woman poked her head in.  
  
Her looks were striking. Early thirties if I had to guess. Her ginger hair cascaded down her shoulders, and she had freckles that covered just under her eyes and from the looks of it ran down the back of her neck. Her eyes were a green where the inner iris was a brighter color than the outer iris in a striking enough manner that you could tell even at a distance where the separation was. Overall appearance made her look pretty enough that I had to wonder why she did not have powers if my own power was right.  
  
It was something of a strange effect but the longer a person had powers the more their body changed towards their own ideal of conventional beauty.  
  
“I hope I am not interrupting.” The woman asked tentatively.  
  
I forced a smile and gestured to the chair across from me. “Not at all. We were not discussing anything important.” I risked a look at Pantheon after that statement. It looked like I wounded her on accident with that one. Though she was able to hide it for the most part.  
  
I gestured to the seat across from me and she entered with another. I had been expecting another cape to show up. I had not expected it to be Echo. Meta-humans were a bit like celebrities, just instead of being ranked on just popularity some of their clout came from how powerful they were.  
  
Echo was not especially popular, and she was not one of the celestials by any stretch, but she was the most powerful meta in the city and thus the state. It was a little like sitting down for a job interview at a lower level public office, and having the governor show up.  
  
She was markedly more human than I was expecting. When all Metas slowly transform into some mind's eye picture of themselves over time most become the definition of conventional beauty. Echo was not. Her face was a little too thin, her nose hooked down some and bridged in the way that people might call it roman. Her body was thin and her shoulders a bit on the broad side. None of this was to call her ugly, she just was not perfect in a conventional sense.  
  
	“Thank you for waiting Mr. Kyong, Ms. Pantheon. I am Emily Madischild. I wear a few hats here at The Guardian’s headquarters. One is their lawyer, the other is one of the heads of the department of public relations. As such I tend to do the interviews here. Today I will be taking your statement with the help of Ms. Echo.” She pulled out a file folder and started to rifle through it.  
  
I perked a brow at the P.R. lady, then looked over to Echo. She was looking at me a little too hard. It made sense though. She was a scientist before she got her powers. It was an ironic stroke of luck, or perhaps intentional on the part of some higher force that her power she received was vibrations when she had been studying sonic waves as her career field.  
  
“Ms. Madischild.” I said adjusting myself in my seat enough that I was at least not slumping.  
  
The chair was not as comfortable for me as it was made to be for most people. I was tall enough to be nearly eye level with Echo while sitting down when she had gone to stand against one of the walls.  
  
Her costume was different from a lot of capes. Instead of the tights that leave very little to the imagination that most heroes wore, or the stylized costumes that a smaller group like pantheon wore, hers was far more practical.  
  
Large pockets sat at easy to access areas of a large dark purple shin length coat. She was wearing what looked like normal pants of the same color that tucked into a pair of black boots. Around her face was a golden colored scarf. While she did wear one of those head coverings that the skin tight suits provided it was clear it was hiding a thin helmet that conformed to the shape of her head.  
  
“Now Mr. Kyong, this is mostly a formality. The perpetrators have already confessed. This statement will be used at their sentencing hearing most likely, and it is a standard practice for The Guardians in the event of future lawsuits of things like Excessive force.” She emphasized the last two words with a minor pause before them. It was subtle, but there.  
  
“Excessive force?” My voice implied a curiosity. For the most part it was genuine, but with my history with The Guardians I could tell where this was likely going.  
  
“Yes Mr. Kyong. The Guardians get into a fair bit of violent conflict. As such we like to have all of our ducks in a row in the event of lawsuits. Naturally people have the rights to defend their own homes, and our heroes-”  
  
“Guardians. Calling yourself a hero is a joke.” I cut her off.  
  
Pantheon leaned forward onto the desk and tried to make a casual show of resting in a way that her hands mostly covered her mouth. Ms. Madischild ruffled a little, but continued.  
  
“Our Guardians have a right to defend themselves and others as they go about their duties on the streets. It’s a little rare in either stance for someone to do as you did however.” She said looking back through the files again with a feigned disinterest.  
  
I was fairly aware of most of the laws of the state. I knew there was a sort of castle doctrine in place that made it so the moment the would be murderers set foot on The Henderson Family’s lawn I would be within my rights to kill them, as a tenant of the Hendersons.  
  
“What I did?” I took a moment to stifle the genuine anger rising in me.  
  
They were trying to make a play at something here. It galled me less that they were trying, and more that they genuinely thought I was stupid enough to fall into it.  
  
“One of the girls had to have her hand amputated. You crushed it so thoroughly it would be useless to her ever again even if it was possible to extract the former firearm she was holding from it. She will also likely never walk again from you yanking her around by the neck. The other suffered broken ribs and a major concussion after you used her friend like a mace to beat her into the floor. The third is fine physically, but is expressing enough mental trauma to make us dubious of some of the information her confession contains.” She looked over the papers as she spoke as if she was getting all of her information from them.  
  
“I was afraid for my life.” I said in a deadpan voice as I drummed my fingers on the table.  
  
“Be that as it may Mr. Kyong, can you agree that you took this a little far?” She tried again.  
  
“Everything I did in that house is covered by the self defense laws of this state. I stopped the moment things deescalated, and I was within my right to kill them if I felt it necessary.” Again my voice was flat and neutral in a manner that was somewhat intentionally mocking.  
  
“You seem remarkably relaxed about murder for a man your age.” Echo chimed in, right on queue.  
  
“And you are remarkably comfortable with coercion tactics on a man my age.” The words came out with an ease and speed that Echo and Ms. Madischild did not really have an immediate answer.  
  
“What exactly do you think we are trying to coerce you into Mr. Kyong?” It was Madischild who broke the silence. She had had that plastic diplospeak to her voice the entire conversation and it was grating on me.  
  
“To join The Guardians. I am one of three male Meta humans in the city. One is a criminal, the other two are neutral.” I leaned back in my chair folding my hands over my stomach. “It is a bonus to the P.R. of your team if you manage to recruit me, and it banishes some of this stigma about The Guardians failing male Meta Humans and them turning to crime because of it.”  
  
I had to hold most of my own weight to stop the chair from tipping and ruining the illusion of a high ground I was trying to make, looking at Madischild in a way that made it look like I was looking down at her.  
  
It was something that should be as easy as it sounds as I towered over her, but in truth it was harder than it looked. I needed my eyes to be angled down at her and for my chin to be pointed at her. If the angle is too steep you look like a clown and if it’s not steep enough you the glare you give looks impotent.  
  
Echo shifted uncomfortably in her spot against the wall. Madischild stood firm. Why was it that this unpowered woman had more of a force of will than the literal strongest woman in the room?  
  
“While recruiting you was a side objective of this meeting, and something that we would consider a happy ending to it, I can assure you the Guardians would not use strong arm tactics to try and force you to join its ranks Mr. Kyong.” She said again in that diplospeak voice.  
  
It took a moment of looking between them for it to click for me. The left hand was not speaking to the right. A smile formed on my face, and it likely lacked warmth.  
  
“She never told you what she did.” I said firmly. It would be a question to most people. It was not a question here.  
  
Madischild dared a glance at Echo who refused to meet her gaze in any way, instead choosing to stare stoically out of the window.  
  
“Enlighten me?” She finally asked towards me, somehow managing to glare at Echo while keeping a polite smile towards me at the same time.  
  
“The last time Mist tried to recruit me, it included a threat to arrest me if I got into another fight with another metahuman. A fight mind you where I was attacked while trying to pull a dying girl out of a fight to get her medical aid.” I managed to keep the smug feeling I was having out of my voice, barely.  
  
It felt a little like telling on a sibling to my mother as I looked between the two. Echo had decided the tree outside was far more interesting than the conversation inside. Madischild had turned in her seat fully to look at Echo. It was hidden by her hair and the angle she was sitting from me, but I could tell it was not a pleasant look.  
  
She turned back to me and that perfect smile she had was a little more plastic now.  
  
“I am sure you can understand that she may have been acting under the laws around meta humans. There is a different standard for violent encounters, you understand?” Her voice, at least, was not as flimsy as her argument.  
  
“Even for meta humans both are covered under both self defense and good samaritan laws.” I said flatly. “And you playing along with her coercion tactics does not endear you to me.”  
  
Pantheon at least seemed to be having fun. There was silence after my statement. It was her who broke it with a chuckle.  
  
“I told you he does this.” She sounded amused.  
  
Madischild let out a sigh and rubbed her eyes for a moment before she relaxed. Her expression did not shift to anything unpleasant, but it was more genuine now. There was no smile however.  
  
“A seer power?” She asked Pantheon and not me. That was disappointing, typical, but disappointing.  
  
“Maybe, but he is also just very smart. He was challenging and skipping grades even before he got his powers. It got a little faster after that, but nothing to suggest it was a seer power more than it was hard work.” She offered a shrug at the statement.  
  
There was another sigh from Madischild. She looked at me for a long moment as if trying to decide something.  
  
I rested my elbows on the table and folded my hands together, then rested forward as she watched me. I decided to be the one to break the moment of contemplation to keep my forward momentum.  
  
“It is not hard to figure out what you were doing. You were trying to generate a problem for me. If I did not know anything about the legal system I would have panicked, thinking I was in serious legal trouble. Then you planned to present yourself as a solution. Most young men do not have my education, and are less independent. -They- would have jumped at the chance to be protected and have someone else take over the supposed legal issues you were raised.” I started, locking eyes with Madischild as I did.  
  
The information overflow I was getting from my powers was making me fuzzy headed, but lack of eye contact here would make my words have less effect. Something confirmed by the information I was getting.  
  
 “The worst part is that there is a plausibility to them as each issue is something that could go to jury trial if the district attorney decided to be an ass about it.” I continued. “And you could pull strings with them to get them to file charges if you wanted. Ultimately they would have to be dropped and would become an embarrassment to the state if I chose to fight them, but you could use them for the charade.”  
  
All of it was something someone intelligent could figure out. None of it was information I should not know that I had extracted with my power.  
  
Madischild raised one of those perfectly shaped eyebrows. There was a little bit of surprise that slipped into her now much less guarded expression. She had decided before to be more honest with me as she could see dishonesty was having the opposite of the intended effect. Now she was cemented in that thought.  
  
Pantheon outright laughed now. Though her grin was up at Echo now. “I told you so.” was all she offered, but it was enough to stir the head Guardian out of her stupor.  
  
“And it’s not a seer power. He’s just smart enough to cold read everyone in a room he walks into?” She asked at Pantheon.  
  
Again the conversation was around me and not directed at me. I did not let the frustration show in my features. It was the way of this world no matter how irritating it was.  
  
“As near as I can tell, yeah. He passed through his course studies so fast he had to wait a few years before the foster care system would let him take college courses. In that time he sort of just asked me for books. Taught himself other languages among other things.” She had a soft smile on her face and sounded proud. Was she bragging about me?  
  
“It could be a super intellect. That does fall in the scope of seer powers.” Echo offered in response.  
  
“He could also be right here, sitting in the room with you.” I wasn’t fully able to keep the irritation out of my voice, and it caused every woman in the room to look at me.  
  
I cursed myself at that. While men were never the heads of the families they were in, they were central figures who raised the children. In this world there was an almost instinctual conditioning to focus and listen to a man when his voice was stern. It was a little like the same reaction people had to women in my first world. It wasn’t the gender so much as it was the role of being a caretaker.  
  
“You can ask me about my powers. You do not need to speculate with my advocate.” I added a bit more gently.  
  
“Right.” Madischild. “Should we get to your statement?” She asked promptly.  
  
“Yes. My statement first, then other business after.” I relaxed again in my seat letting the tension drain out of me.  
  
“Other business?” She asked with curiosity.  
  
“In spite of how much the tactics of the two of you have been making me want nothing to do with you. There have been other circumstances in my life weighing in on my decisions.” I felt a little like I was in fact lecturing a rowdy teen at this point.

I spent most of Monday staring at the elevator floor numbers, waiting for it to decide where to take me. Floor 7 ¾ is not exactly listed on any building directory, but here I was, pressed against spotless white walls, trying not to panic.

When the doors slid open, I stepped out into a hallway that looked exactly like the inside of a clock: gears turning slowly on the walls, ticking sounds that weren’t synced with anything, and lights that flickered like they had a secret.

A voice behind me startled me.

“Employee #2937, welcome to your new home away from time.”

I turned to see a woman wearing a blazer that seemed stitched from tiny calendars, her nametag reading Maris. She smiled like she knew I had a hundred questions but was waiting for me to ask just one.

“We’re the Future Correspondence Department,” she said, leading me down the hall. “We don’t really do much, but that’s the point. We handle messages from futures that might or might not happen.”

I blinked. “Messages from the future? Like… letters?”

“Exactly. Sometimes emails, sometimes physical packages. Mostly reminders. Sometimes warnings. Sometimes nonsense.”

We arrived at a row of desks that looked like they belonged in a library—old-fashioned typewriters next to holographic displays, stacks of paper next to floating digital scrolls.

“And here’s your desk,” Maris said, handing me a coffee cup that smelled suspiciously like photocopier coffee.

“Your coworkers are… interesting,” she added with a smirk. “First up: Nolan. He’s convinced the office plants are spies. Next, Vera, who claims she’s training a time-traveling hamster. And then there’s Julian—don’t trust his smile. Apparently, he already hates you.”

I laughed nervously. “Already hates me? That’s… comforting.”

Maris winked. “Don’t worry. It’s probably for something you’ll do on Thursday.”

I sat down, watching as a small mechanical bird flew by, dropping a note in my inbox labeled: ‘Don’t open until 3 p.m.’

The day passed in a blur of strange tasks: reading letters dated years from now, filing envelopes addressed to people who hadn’t been born yet, and answering phone calls that echoed with static and laughter from nowhere.

By 3 p.m., I remembered the note. I carefully unfolded it:

“When everyone’s clocks are broken, time is what you make of it. Watch the shadows at noon.”

I looked up, but the hallway was empty, the clocks still ticking offbeat.

Just then, my computer beeped. A new email, sender: Future Me.

Subject: “Don’t trust the coffee.”

It is paywalled, but below are a few passages.  Nothing particularly new for avid readers of this subreddit but interesting.  Does say 787s will get premium economy and Starlink.

>Alaska Air is building out its Seattle hometown hub, envisioning a top-tier global gateway that lets it serve hot spots in Europe and Asia.

>There is just one problem: Delta....

>A decade-plus-long turf war has been reignited. Delta and Alaska have been duking it out for market share in the Emerald City since Delta pushed to expand there and designated it a hub in 2014.

>Seattle’s tech industry, including corporate headquarters for Microsoft and [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com), has made the city a draw for airlines, along with its growing population and concentration of affluent, globe-trotting residents.

>Alaska Air has more than twice as many flights out of Seattle as Delta. But for years, Delta has been able to offer access to international destinations that were out of reach for Alaska, except through its partnerships with other carriers, such as American Airlines.

>That changed last year, when Alaska Air bought Hawaiian Airlines. The roughly $1 billion deal expanded Alaska’s fleet to include wide-body jets suitable for long-haul trips, with more on order. Now it can go global....

>For Alaska Air, the new flights are part of a makeover as the fifth-largest U.S. airline looks to burnish its bona fides as a major player. Its Boeing 787 wide-body jets, currently outfitted in Hawaiian’s colors, are getting a new paint job inspired by the northern lights to present a more cosmopolitan, premium image.

>While its footprint in the U.S. East Coast and Midwest is smaller, Alaska is a powerhouse in the western U.S. For Seattleites, having the Alaska co-branded credit card in their wallet is as ubiquitous as drinking coffee and carrying a raincoat, said Rachel Smith, CEO of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce...

>Alaska also plans to add a new international premium economy section to its wide-body planes. While the Dreamliners it inherited from Hawaiian don’t currently have Wi-Fi, Harrison said they would be equipped with Starlink internet by the time the airline’s new service to Europe launches next year.

1mkzf24,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1mkzf24/its_gone/,It’s gone!,"On 8/28 at around 930 in the middle of work I got the weirdest feeling like my stomach dropped and it was followed by the most intense pain I’ve ever felt. It started by what felt like my sternum and radiated to my back throughout my rib cage on the right. I felt disoriented, started sweating like crazy and got super cold. I ran to the bathroom thinking I was getting stomach flu ( I had coffee with heavy cream that expired the 31rst so I thought maybe the heavy cream went bad early and it was wrecking my stomach.) I got to the bathroom and nothing, I got up and started stretching my arms to get rid of the back pain and I turned and face the toiled and threw up. I went back to work and told my coworker how I felt and she suggested it was probably indigestion, to drink a soda. I bought a Canada Dry and sat down while sweating like crazy but freezing at the same time, I was pale and dizzy. After burping for about 10 minutes I had the urge to go to the bathroom and was able to go, the symptoms almost instantly went away. I went back to work and was able to finish my work day. I just left feeling extremely bloated. I got home and told my mom who right away said it might be my gallbladder or liver and she wanted me to go to the ER. I brushed it off and told her it was gas cause I felt better… I tried eating dinner but I felt so bloated i couldn’t eat and the pain, although like 7/10 was there. I drank some pain killers, ate some tums and called it a night. I normally sleep on my left side and I couldn’t get comfortable, but once the medicine kicked it I was good. Friday I woke up feeling back to normal, I went about my work day and during lunch I figured rice and beef sounded good. I ate and no pain, however about an hour later I started feeling that aching pain again on my back. I kept hitting my back trying to crack it but nothing would make it go away. I got home and took a hot shower and put on a hot compress thinking I’m full of gas cause I hadn’t been able to pass gas or go number two since the day before. I skipped dinner and drank hot tea, pain medicine and tums and knocked out. Saturday I decided I was just gonna eat plain rice and an apple, something light to not upset my stomach. I took some hot tea and felt awesome aside from an extreme bitter taste in my mouth. I went to pee and noticed my pee was orange, like if I’d drank a whole bottle of vitamin B. My manager asked if I was okay because I looked yellow, which threw me off. I left work and had slight pain like a 5/10 and drove to my boyfriends house. It was the start of my weekend so I told him I wanted to stop by the ER and see if they give me something for the indigestion before we went to eat…… we went to the ER for me to end up staying 5 days🙃 turns out I was jaundice, by the time I was admitted my skin and eyes were very yellow. My bilirubin was trapped due to having HELLAA stones spread throughout my ducts🙃 and one being jammed in the main duct🥲 I had ERCP done Wednesday to get rid of all those stones which helped my bilirubin drop from a steady 7 to a 3.8 and was able to get surgery done yesterday.🥳🥳 I hadn’t had any solid food since last Saturday so when I was out of surgery and they gave me a pudding and crackers I felt like the biggest fatty lol I scarfed it down and no pain! I got home and my mom made me a mashed bean soup that I ate with some chips and NO PAIN!!🥳🥳🥳 today is my first official day post op. My incisions hurt when I cough, sneeze, when I try and get up, but feels like a bee sting, nothing crazy. I’ve been able to pass gas with no pain and I was able to pee no pain. I’m gonna try and eat some egg and see how my stomach handles it. But overall so happy to be back home and eating😭 definitely gained a new appreciation for food lol THANK YOU TO THIS SUB!! I was so scared about what life would look like after but after talking to several people about post op or even their life with their gallbladder issues, I feel it was the right choice and I felt very prepared for this next chapter.

Let’s be real for a second—does anyone actually enjoy slogging through endless spreadsheets or sending the same email 30 times? If you do, you’re an absolute hero and I applaud you! But for most of us, the promise of business automation is nothing short of electrifying.

I’m talking about waking up to see the to-dos checked off, partners updated, reports sent, calendars synced, customers delighted—and you haven’t even finished your coffee yet.  

Here’s why I’m so hyped about business automation and why you might want to be, too:

* **Scalability without Compromise:** Automation doesn’t just make the work go away. It actually unlocks growth! Imagine onboarding a thousand customers in the same time it used to take to onboard ten. That’s real scale without burning out your team.

* **Freedom from Repetition:** Repetitive tasks are soul-sucking. What if we *never* had to worry about invoice reminders, time tracking, or error-prone data entry ever again? Automated workflows make that possible. Suddenly, your work day is focused on actual problems that require your brainpower—and maybe even a spark of joy.

* **Insights Without the Grind:** Manual reporting is a surefire way to never want to look at numbers again. Automation means you get beautiful dashboards in real-time, no all-nighters necessary.

But, I get it. There are valid concerns:

- Is automation only for “the big guys”? Nope! Tools are rolling out every day with simple integrations (yay, Zapier and Make.com).
- Does it kill jobs? Not if we reframe the conversation around *augmentation*. It’s about empowering creative, valuable human work, not replacement.
- Is it expensive? The ROI on saving people-hours every month is usually way higher than you think.

Let’s make it practical—here are a few easy automation wins you *could* start on today:

- Set up an auto-responder for new leads with Mailchimp or ConvertKit
- Sync customer orders across platforms using Zapier, Make, or n8n
- Automate meeting scheduling through Calendly and Google Calendar integration
- Use AI bots to transcribe and summarize meetings (yes, GPT-style too)
- Trigger team reminders, ticket assignments, or report sharing in Slack automatically

The future looks pretty bright. Imagine this:

One year from now, you look back at your business processes and laugh. The ‘fire drills’ are gone. Your team has time for moonshots and creative pivots. Your customers feel seen and supported every step of the way (with a little help from the bots).

We’ve got tools, trust me—there’s never been a time with more access to plug-and-play automation magic. The only real limit? How bold we’re willing to get with redesigning the work we do.

Curious to hear your stories! 🌟

- What business headaches do you dream of automating?
- Which automation win got you doing your happy dance?
- Are there pain points you wish someone would build an automation for?

I have a sweet tooth that will probably be the end of me, and I appreciate kanal humor. My jokes are corny, but apparently memorable—my friends still quote some from 10 years ago, so… who knows, maybe you’ll remember one too.

Movies? I’m into sci-fi, adventure, action, psychological thrillers, and the occasional romcom.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Veronika Kudermetova vs. Suzan Lamens: A Serve and Sisterly Vendetta**  
The WTA Cincinnati Open final is a clash of contrasts: Veronika Kudermetova, the serve-and-volley assassin with the precision of a Russian missile, versus Suzan Lamens, the Dutch underdog who’s somehow still here after a career defined by “meh.” Let’s break it down with the mathematical rigor of a spreadsheet and the humor of a tennis ball bouncing off a clown’s nose.

---

### Parse the Odds: Who’s the Favorite?

The books are screaming **Kudermetova -650** (implied probability: \~87%) and **Lamens +450** (\~18%). Those numbers aren’t just numbers—they’re the sound of Veronika’s thunderous first serve echoing through the Cincinnati night. The spread (-4.5 games) and total (20.5 games) suggest a dominant Kudermetova performance, unless Lamens pulls off a miracle like finding a “win” button on her second serve.

---

### Digest the News: Family Feuds and Form

Kudermetova enters this match with the weight of her sister’s ghost haunting her. Polina Kudermetova, Veronika’s sibling, was *defeated by Lamens in Montreal*. Imagine the family WhatsApp group: *“Sis, I fixed the mistakes you made last time… I hope.”* Veronika’s response? A career-high ranking and a serve that’s been clocked faster than a Fed Cup statistician’s coffee intake.

Lamens, meanwhile, is the tennis version of a “dark horse with a broken bridle.” She’s won 18 of her last 20 matches, including a shocker over Bia Haddad Maia, who’s currently plotting her comeback in a spreadsheet. But here’s the rub: Lamens’ game relies on consistency, not power. Against Kudermetova’s metronomic serve (averaging 117 mph) and net charges, it’s like bringing a spoon to a gunfight—*unless* she can turn this into a rally longer than a TikTok video.

1mkz6gp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1mkz6gp/showcase_best_nut_milk_maker_iagreea_and_is_it/,Showcase best nut milk maker IAGREEA and is it really worth it,"Testing the IAGREEA HB-B10KW1 nut milk maker in my kitchen over the past few weeks felt like opening a gateway to endless creamy drinks and plant-based experiments. The idea of whipping up homemade almond milk, oat milk, or even rice paste sounded like a dream come true for anyone who’s into healthier diets or wants to skip store-bought options full of additives. Yet, despite its impressive features, this device isn’t without a few quirks worth mentioning.

**Sleek Design and Build Quality**  
From the moment I unboxed this nut milk maker, its streamlined, modern design caught my eye. Compact and lightweight, it fits nicely on the countertop without hogging a ton of space—perfect for small apartments like mine. The 35-ounce capacity is a thoughtful touch, enabling just the right amount of homemade beverage without overwhelming leftovers. While the exterior feels sturdy, the ultra-durable nonstick interior ensures easy cleaning while eliminating pesky residue. The small lid at the top even allows for adding spices or flavorings mid-process, although it’s wisely recommended to avoid this feature during high-heat cycles.

**Impressive 8-in-1 Functionality**  
I found the 8 one-touch programs delightful for simplifying kitchen tasks. There’s a preset for classic almond milk, soymilk, oat milk, and even smoothies! Even better, it can also boil water or prepare rice paste. With just a few taps on the digital touch controls, I was making fresh plant milk that was creamy and consistent. My Saturday experiments ranged from soy milk topped with honey to oat milk thick enough to write home about. The “self-clean” setting is an absolute lifesaver—fill it with water post-use, run the cleaning program, and you’re good to go!

[Find the best price for IAGREEA HB-B10KW1 on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b0dgt8mc7t/)

**Ease of Use for Busy Lifestyles**  
What sets this nut milk maker apart from many kitchen gadgets I’ve used is how user-friendly it is. This thing streamlines everything—so much so that I found myself using it multiple days in a row, guilt-free. The 12-hour delay timer was a surprise game-changer. I could set it up at night, and by morning, hot almond milk was ready for my coffee. Plus, for someone like me who repeatedly forgets items on the stove, the automatic heat preservation feature kept drinks warm for two hours, eliminating the rush to pour.

**Strengths**  
- Offers 8 versatile one-touch settings  
- Self-cleaning system minimizes post-use hassle  
- 35oz capacity suitable for small to medium families  
- Compact design ideal for small kitchens  
- 12-hour delay start adds unmatched convenience  

**Negatives**  
- Heated programs like soymilk could foam up, requiring careful monitoring  
- Not ideal for crushing harder solids—frozen fruits struggled a bit in tests  
- Can't be used for seasonings with high heat, limiting mid-recipe adjustments  

**Drawbacks in Everyday Use**  
Despite all its merits, the nut milk maker isn’t flawless. Heated processes tend to foam when making liquids like soymilk, so you’ll want to keep an eye on it to prevent any bubbling over the brim. I also found that while it excels at liquids, it struggles with frozen ingredients like fruits that you’d use in smoothies—if that’s your primary goal, you might need a dedicated blender. And though the option to add seasonings mid-recipe is clever, the manufacturer’s note about avoiding it during heat-based tasks was a bit of a letdown.

**Competing Products**  
Going up against similar plant milk makers like Nutr or Almond Cow, the IAGREEA model holds its own in sheer functionality. Nutr, for instance, offers a compact design but doesn’t match the 8-program versatility here. Almond Cow excels in producing larger quantities of nut milk faster, yet it lacks the one-touch program diversity, making the IAGREEA a better all-rounder for variety seekers. However, I did notice Almond Cow performed slightly better when blending harder nuts like hazelnuts—something to consider if that’s your primary ingredient.

**Affordable Quality**  
For the features this little powerhouse delivers, I’d say you’re getting solid value for its capabilities. Instead of juggling multiple devices, you have an all-in-one solution for homemade plant-based drinks and beyond. Its convenience and self-cleaning capability alone might justify the investment, especially if you’re someone like me who values time and flavor equally. Given its energy-efficient features and quick preparation times, this gadget feels like a smart purchase.

This stylish coffee maker has certainly elevated my caffeine game, yet it comes with its quirks. Let me walk you through my experience with this machine so you can decide if it suits your lifestyle as well.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The sleek, modern aesthetic of the Nespresso VertuoPlus definitely catches the eye. With its elegant grey finish and compact design, it fits seamlessly on my kitchen countertop without consuming too much space. The large, 40-ounce swivel water tank is a clever touch, as I can reposition it to suit the layout of my kitchen. Additionally, the machine feels solid, providing the impression of premium craftsmanship. However, the glossy plastic exterior is prone to collecting fingerprints, which means occasional wiping is needed to maintain its elegant look.  

**Performance**  
This machine is powered by innovation, with its 25-second heat-up feature and precise Centrifusion technology for brewing. I was genuinely impressed by how consistently it produces rich, creamy coffee with a smooth layer of foam. Pressing one button is all it takes to produce coffee or espresso in less than two minutes. While I appreciate the automatic shut-off feature for energy efficiency, the machine can sometimes vibrate a bit during brewing, which might nudge lightweight mugs slightly out of place.

**Functionality and Features**  
With the ability to brew four cup sizes—5-ounce and 8-ounce coffee, as well as single and double espresso shots—the versatility is undeniable. On days when I’m rushing out the door, it delivers smaller servings effortlessly. When hosting friends, I often use the larger sizes or pour a shot over ice to create a refreshing iced coffee. Every button press feels intuitive, and I appreciate how the machine adjusts brewing parameters based on the barcode of each Nespresso capsule. Yet, if you’re someone who prefers customizing brewing strength manually, you might find this a bit restrictive.  

**Brewing Experience**  
One of this machine's highlights is its convenience. The capsule system takes the guesswork out of measuring coffee grounds or dealing with filters. Popping in a pod and watching the machine work its magic is oddly satisfying! Included in the box was a sampler pack of Nespresso capsules—a great way for me to discover some new blends. That said, the cost of continuously buying pods can add up, especially if you’re a heavy coffee drinker like I am. It would have been nice if the machine worked with reusable pods, but its reliance on proprietary capsules is something to account for.

**Advantages**  
- Compact and space-saving design with an elegant finish.  
- Versatility to brew four cup sizes with one-touch simplicity.  
- Fast, efficient heating system with energy-saving auto-off.  
- Starter set of Nespresso capsules included for experimenting.  

**Disadvantages**  
- Limited to using proprietary Nespresso capsules only.  
- Plastic construction is prone to fingerprints.  
- Vibrates during brewing, which may shift lighter mugs.

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing this coffee maker to some of its competitors, like the Keurig K-Café or the De'Longhi Lattissima, the Nespresso machine holds its ground for its premium coffee extraction using Centrifusion technology. The De'Longhi offers a built-in milk frother, which ups the game for latte lovers, while the Keurig caters better to customizable brewing preferences. However, if capsule quality and coffee consistency are your top priorities, the VertuoPlus easily beats standard pod machines like Keurig. For those who value reusable pod compatibility, though, other models might offer greater sustainability options.  

**Value for Money**  
There’s no doubt that this brewer delivers excellent coffee with unmatched flavor quality, but the recurring cost of proprietary capsules needs to be factored in. While it’s not the cheapest option out there, for someone who appreciates the ease of use and flavorful results, the price feels justified. The machine also makes for a great gift, given its stylish design and foolproof operation, but it suits individuals or families who prioritize convenience over budget-friendliness.

Bad results followed, and June had to rush them to the local hospital to have their stomachs pumped. Several weeks later the little girls climbed up into our medicine cabinet and seized a bottle of candy-flavored cough syrup that included some sedative drug. Cooperatively alternating their draws at the bottle, the two finished its contents, with predictable results. June grabbed one child under each arm and rushed for the hospital again. After their stomachs had been pumped, the nurse told June that would be ten dollars each. The total of twenty dollars would be a terrible drain on our funds, and June argued with the nurse, pointing out that the last time she brought the girls in to have their stomachs pumped she had been charged only five dollars each. The nurse made appropriate record of that fact, and within a week we were visited by a Chicago public health nurse, who made some very pointed inquiries about the storage of our harmful substances and our fitness as parents.""

From President Beck, a 1st Counselor in the General Young Women's Presidency: ""My next story is about a woman I will call Mary. She was the daughter of faithful pioneer parents who had sacrificed much for the gospel. She had been married in the temple and was the mother of 10 children. She was a talented woman who taught her children how to pray, to work hard, and to love each other. She paid her tithing, and the family rode to church together on Sunday in their wagon. Though she knew it was contrary to the Word of Wisdom, she developed the habit of drinking coffee and kept a coffee pot on the back of her stove. She claimed that “the Lord will not keep me out of heaven for a little cup of coffee.” But, because of that little cup of coffee, she could not qualify for a temple recommend, and neither could those of her children who drank coffee with her. Though she lived to a good old age and did eventually qualify to reenter and serve in the temple, only one of her 10 children had a worthy temple marriage, and a great number of her posterity, which is now in its fifth generation, live outside of the blessings of the restored gospel she believed in and her forefathers sacrificed so much for.""

1mkywdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/UndergroundFiction/comments/1mkywdd/novel_idea_please_critique_heavily/,Novel idea - please critique heavily,"Sat at the very centre of the big, and really rather messy goop of cosmic jelly that is our universe, there is a tree. There shouldn’t be.
When at an extremely important, yet entirely unfortunate part, of a universes’ creation, it gets dropped and suddenly a tree (which has absolutely no right in being there) has appeared at its’ core; one would assume it’s creators would throw it away and start again. It was however the last of the stardust they’d just used…
“It’ll be alright won’t it?” A thunderous voice bellowed from within the dark nothingness.
“Nah, it’s buggered.” A second announced knowingly. “Look at the consistency of it, the stardust is getting into all the places it shouldn’t do. It won’t work like it’s s’posed to.”
“It’ll have to do” A third, more assertive yet altogether disappointed voice spoke from the abyss.
And thus was the creation of the known universe; despite various differing accounts of shamans, priests and holy-men alike, who all seem to have something to say on the topic.  Woden, and his brothers, Wilo and Wiha, had been tasked with shaping the matter of the universe into a functioning, law abiding, system of rules and regulations. It was a job they now feared they wouldn’t have for much longer. 
The tree now floated at the centre of space and time, its roots and branches growing quickly, like a bed of writhing eels. They slithered and wriggled between themselves, intertwining as if reaching out for one-another. Amongst these tendrils, the three entities now watched, small particles of the stardust come swirling together to form burning lights .
“Well that definitely shouldn’t be happening” The voice known as Wilo said, pointing out the obvious.
“No, you’re right brother.” Came the reply from Wiha. “Definitely not suppose’ to be doin’ that.”
Woden was the eldest of the three and somewhat the wiser of the brothers. It hadn’t taken him long at all to realise what was going on:
“It’s life you fools! The impact must have compacted too much of the dust together in one space.” Woden spoke.
“Isn’t life suppose’ to come later on, once we’ve designed all the creatures big n’ small, and named ‘em?”
Woden thought about this for a moment. This series of events his brother was describing was the usual way things worked, as Woden well knew having had done this same routine some 60 billion times before - but there was no other answer for what was happening before them. It had to be life. Only this version of it wasn’t a well thought out script that had to play by their universal laws. This one seemed to play by it’s own.
“Well err… Yes… Usually.” He eventually replied. “But I think that knock may have messed with the fundamental nature of this one. It appears as if life has, for absolutely no reason that had anything to do with us, simply sparked itself into existence.”
“Ah… Bollocks..”.

***

The carriage shuddered as it came to a sudden stop, its wheels screeching over the wet cobblestones, spraying puddle water up onto the coach box. Two cloaked figures sat perched upon it, illuminated only by a sliver of moonlight that had taken the opportunity to escape from between a gap in the rain clouds.
“I hate the evenings this time of year” came a grumble from the driver; the words appearing in the frigid air as wafts of steam.
“We all do Lum, it's the sodding rain. Park her up while I go find out what's going on”. The second figure sprung down from the carriage landing with a splatter in the stream of rainwater that had formed at the side of the carriageway. They repositioned their heavy waxed cloak in an effort to keep the worst of the deluge out. An attempt that in all honesty wasn't working; a point highlighted by the fact that the cheap leather boots worn by the figure had already let in water.
The shape appeared to shrug, then made its way towards a small doorway just off the road, sheltered under an overhanging first floor as the rattling of the carriage disappeared around a narrow street corner.
On either side of the cheap wooden door to what was honestly little more than a poorly kept and dingy set of rooms, were two more cloaked silhouettes, busying themselves in whispered conversation. They had found what must have been the only available dry spot, a narrow strip under the overhang, their backs forced right up against the wall. The faces of the pair were intermittently illuminated by the amber glow of a cigarette the larger of the two was smoking. The squelching of approaching footsteps caught their attention, bringing the smaller of the pair abruptly to an upright position.
“You the boys from Ascett?” Asked the larger of the figures through a lungful of cigarette smoke, tossing the butt to the floor and extinguishing it on the cobblestones with an expert twist of his boot. The voice was gruff and gave the impression they’d spent one too many nights standing around in the frigid rain. “About time you showed your faces. We were only supposed to be lending a hand with this. What's your name anyway son?”
A match was suddenly struck close to their face, lighting another cigarette which now hung between the lips of what appeared to be a huge bearded man. The flickering light from the flame unveiled a rugged face that had been weathered by perhaps 40 winters or so, although their eyes gave away that they were likely younger.
“You know what it's like. Boss is trying to run several jobs in this town and there’s only so many of us to go round. The name’s Briggs by the way.”
Briggs had learned fairly quickly that the old sweats seemed to respect you more if you mirrored their attitude of seemingly being fed up by the fact you were still breathing at the end of the day.
The bearded man nodded approvingly, then ushered his smaller counterpart over with a wave of his hand. 
“This here’s, Mouse. He’s new to the family but he'll fill you in on what we've got here so far”
The skinny figure that was Mouse, now lurching towards Briggs, was quite noticeably an academy leaver. He was dressed in a clean and recently pressed black uniform, its brass buttons highly polished and glinting in the cigarette light. It was an odd reflection for Briggs, to think that only a few years ago that had been him. His buttons had long since turned green and matted from oxidation, and his trousers were more or less held together at this point, by a complex patchwork of stitching where they’d been ripped and torn on so many occasions.
Mouse stood rigidly as he puffed out his chest, trying his best to appear confident, before he meekly squeaked out the words:  
“Well… at this point, to be honest… we’re thinking, well… it’s, err… a bit odd”
“A bit odd?” The bearded man roared with laughter. “Well that’s certainly one way of putting it! There’s cadavers in there without no bleedin’ eyes!”
Briggs felt his eyes roll as he let out an audible sigh that floated in the night. The thought of bodies behind that flimsy door with holes where the eyes should be, filled him with the sudden realisation that this wasn’t going to be a quick job. He had been hoping for an easy shift this evening. He’d not been able to sleep the day through before leaving for work, and no amount of the strong sticky black tar that was the station coffee had been able to revive him.
Briggs had joined the watchmen in the hope that he would be chasing criminals and just this, dealing with suspicious dead bodies. And to many, that was all the job was. All the novels and tales he’d heard basically glamorized the solving of the puzzle of who done it.  However, now that he was suddenly faced with the situation in the flesh, Briggs couldn’t help but be filled with dread.
“Well this is going to be a lot of paperwork…” he thought to himself out loud. “Have you sent for the watch sergeant yet?”
“Yeah, sent for ‘em practically soon as we opened the door. Proper weird in there, you wanna take a look?” came the reply from behind the beard.
“Might want to cover your face though, it stinks in there.” squeaked Mouse through a grimace.
Briggs found himself edging forwards. He hadn’t really planned to go in at this point, but the morbid curiosity of human nature seemed to be dragging him towards the door, his hand reaching out towards the doorknob.
He was suddenly brought back to reality by the sound of rapidly approaching footsteps. That must be Lum back from the carriage he thought to himself. As he turned, he noticed the silhouette of his partner jogging towards them, a lamp extended before him hanging from his right arm swinging excitedly from the maneuver. 
“Flipping rain!” Lum exclaimed grumpily as he drew closer, hurrying himself into the slither of dryness up against the wall.
“No eyes Lum…”
“Guessing they didn’t see it coming then?” Lum chuckled under his breath. “Well… this is gonna take all night.” He stated to the group. “You gone in yet?”
“Nah” replied Briggs “These two have, but better not until sarge arrives, just in case we mess up something evidential. You guys will probably have to stay to brief him when he gets here since you’ve already gone in” he said, pointing towards the other two with a tilt of his head.
The group elected that this was for the best through a collective nodding of their heads in agreement. If there was one thing you didn’t want to do in their profession, it was to upset a senior watchman. They had a nasty and rather creative imagination for coming up with ways to repay the favor.

The four tried their best to remain in the thin patch of dryness for what felt like hours, the cold and rain whipping the faces of them all, bar the large bearded man who seemed unfazed by the weather, content in his chain smoking of what appeared to Briggs, to be a seemingly endless supply of cigarettes. 
As it approached what felt like midnight, Briggs watched as a chubby little man across the street poked his balding head out from a door to guard his small yappy dog that had sprinted out from between his legs, whilst it went about its business on the wet cobbles. The man made no attempt to clean up the mess before quickly closing the door once the dog had returned. Briggs couldn’t really blame him considering the weather.
The distinctive sound of the clip-clopping of a carriage could be heard approaching shortly after. The noise of metal horseshoes striking the cobbles echoed into the night, getting louder as they drew closer. A large black wagon pulled up, a single driver sat atop the coach box. Briggs recognised the driver from the Ascett station. It was Sergeant Fielding. A large, burly chap with an appetite for solving crime, and what appeared to be an even larger appetite for anything served with an alcohol content and from a keg - this had left him over the years, with a permanent red glow to his face and nose, and the inability to formulate a whole sentence without a hiccup randomly occupying the space between his words.
Briggs hadn't often worked alongside Sergeant Fielding, which probably was, in large part due to the fact the sergeant could usually be found slumped over a table in the station bar, but the sergeant had always seemed considerably friendly for a senior watchman, giving a nod of acknowledgement when passing Briggs at the station. 
“Well, well, *hic!* Well… next of kin in the *hic!*, err… shackles yet then? *Hic!*” Said the sergeant, a hand clutched to his chest and sounding to Briggs as if suffering from indigestion.
This was fairly normal protocol for jobs relating to dead bodies. Usually if there had been suspicion of foul play, the grimy finger of the law would stery point straight in the face of the spouse or estranged child and yell: “You’re nicked!”, and nine times out of ten with little to no evidence they were hanged the next day, thus proving their guilt on the matter. Well that was the way things normally went anyhow. Briggs however was more of a new school ideologist on the concept of criminal thinking, and felt that asking a few questions before opening the trapdoor usually left him with a lot less explaining to do the next day, when inevitably, little Miss Miggins came in with a vital piece of exonerating evidence just moments after a flock of ravens rustled and squaked into the air following the sound of a loud, intense ‘crack’ of rope.
It occurred to Briggs that the senior management really ought to find a better place for this kind of evidence. The carpets at the station were after all becoming a trip hazard, and he was surprised more Watchmen hadn't been given the sack. You’d need a fair few sacks to clean up the amount of stuff that had been kicked under that musty green material over the years he thought.
“No Sergeant!” Blurted out Mouse. “Watchmen present all agreed to preserve the scene and handover to yourself, Sergeant!”. 
“Alright… *hic!*... Junior, err.. watchman..? *hic!*” Came the reply from the sergeant, his eyelids forced into a squint as if they were trying to catch the name of this young beanpole of a watchman from flying off into the night.
“Narrowford, Sergeant!”
“Right.. right.. yes.. *hic!*. Quite right anyhow. You must always wait for the senior watch-*hic!*-man, to err, assess the scene before rushing off and making, err… *hic!* Decisions for yourself, ha ha!” Sergeant Fielding clambered down from atop his carriage, a feint which was rather unglamorous. Dismounted, with a spin and landed in front of the four seeking refuge from the rain, swaying forward and back with his arms straight out to the sides, before blowing out a sigh of effort, and walking towards the group.
“Let's, err… let's *hic!*, have a look inside then shall we?”

my buddy invited me maybe a month ago.  him and I were both pretty new but he'd gone a few times and liked the sunday meditations.

i've been to maybe 5 sunday meditations now.  it's usually 30min guided meditation, 30-40min lecture, then discussion + food.  and some of us usually grab coffee afterwards.

the topics are pretty easy and acceptable.  every session i've been to has spoken on emptiness (which is where the class is at right now).   the guided meditations are just speaking on mindfulness and feeling peace.

nothing has seemed problematic so far.   except for the picture of gyatso.  when i first entered that picture creeped me out, but i also have a lot of uncomfortable feelings from childhood around old / sickly people and that picture reminds me of those things.  

  
i'm asking for your guys opinion here because everything i read online seems problematic.  
the leadership, the history, the political stance, the resistance to the dalai lama, etc.

but i've yet to see any of that.    and just going to the sunday classes has felt pretty peaceful so far.  
plus they have 6pm 30min meditations for $5 - with no commentary.  just sitting and the teacher will go through a basic guided meditation.

  
i trust your experiences and expertise more than mine, considering how new i am.  given their problematic history - should i just completely avoid this?    even if it's seemed okay and non intrusive so far?  

there's a feeling of anonymity here, where i could show up and leave. nobody's asking my name, address, what i do for work etc.

[bambino plus, df64v2]","I’m at my wits end. I’ve tried everything but my shots keep coming out basically lifeless with a bitter aftertaste, no matter what bean I use it always tastes the same. It’s not bitter in the traditional way, it’s ashy, stale, and over extracted flavor, even with fresh beans.

Here’s my setup:

Breville Bambino Plus (descaled and cleaned two weeks ago) DF64 V2 (cleaned regularly) Normcore bottomless portafilter Normcore manual WDT tool, spring loaded tamper, regular tamper, and distributor which I all use.

Currently I’m using stumptown hair bender beans roasted 9 days ago. I have had this same issue with george Howell alchemy, red rooster funky chicken, and many other roasters.

I pull my shots at 18.5g in (I get the least channeling and most predictable shots with this dose, but I could be wrong, I’ve experimented with other doses) and I have tried many ratios. I’ve tried

18.5g in 36g out in 30 sec, 25 sec, 35 sec 18.5g in 28g out in 25 sec, 30 sec 18.5g in 32 out, 25 sec, sec

No matter how I play with these times, the shots are really inconsistent. I generally don’t get channeling except for a spurt here and there sometimes, except with difficult beans like george Howell alchemy  where the shot would fall apart and spurt everywhere by the end of the shot for reasons I don’t know why.

No matter what I do, every shot is either slightly sweet at best with a really bitter ashy tail, or just flavorless with a stale and gross aftertaste. Even if I get a good drink every once in a while, I can’t replicate it, and the older the beans get the more miserable this issue becomes. I only ever get a good drink out of the first 1-3 days of receiving the beans, after that they all taste even more lifeless and papery and burnt. I drink all my drinks as iced cortados, 1:4 espresso to milk.

Please Reddit wizards help me, I’ve tried everything and I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. If you guys say grind finer I already tried I promise, I also tried grinding coarser. I hate my coffee tasting so bad when I know it could be good, I’ve had drinks from all these roasters and I know how good they can taste.

Let me know if I can provide any further info.

Edit: I also use third wave water, so my water is not an issue.",1,1754668206.0,espresso,9,0.67,False

I bit back a moan in the darkness as Reginald violently thrust into me, his hands gripping my hips with bruising force. The pain was searing, tearing through me like fire, yet my body responded involuntarily.

I trembled with each brutal movement, my fingers clawing at the sheets until my knuckles turned ghostly white. Our ragged breathing filled the room, and each involuntary gasp that escaped my throat only seemed to drive him to more savage aggression.

When it was finally over, he yanked himself away and smacked my backside hard, his lips curling into a cold sneer as he looked down at me.

""Holy shit, Elena, you're even more desperate than I thought. You had to drug my drink to get me into bed? So desperate for my cock?""

""I didn't--"" I was so out of breath, but the liquid dripping from my vagina betrayed my words.

""Just shut up."" He cut me off. ""You think I'd sleep with you willingly? Look in the glass - your cunt's still throbbing, such a needy slut. Did your family teach you this shitty trick? Or did you pick up it from those social climbers?""

""Enough, Reginald. For God's sake, I'm your wife!"" I snapped back.

""A title you bought when your family went broke,"" he scoffed before turning toward the bathroom.

This gave me a chance to button my shirt. My hands shook violently, the fabric brushing against the inch-long scar on my arm. The scar reminded me of that dark cave fifteen years ago - but that wasn't my worst nightmare.

Three years ago, in the study of Stewart Villa, I drank champagne that had been spiked. Before everything went dark, I heard my parents' voices getting farther away: ""It's the only way to save the company...""

Before I knew, I was being ushered into a room by my parents' people. My head was spinning, my legs unsteady. And there, in the soft light, stood Reginald. His brown hair was tousled, and his thick, dark eyebrows arched in surprise.

His eyes were deep blue, almond-shaped, with long lashes. High cheekbones, a straight nose, and full lips pressed into a line formed his striking face. He was tall, with broad shoulders filling out a deep gray suit, collar slightly open revealing a hint of bronzed chest. Even in my drugged state, I was struck by his good looks.

Looking back, I had been such a naive idiot back then. I actually thought I could make this marriage work. I thought I could fit in with the rich people in Manhattan.

But reality proved far crueler than my girlish fantasies. For three years, I had had to listen to all those whispers about ""that new money Stewart girl."" Had to watch Reginald pine over his ex, Vivian Drake. That's when I finally realized this marriage was a total joke.

The sound of the bathroom door slamming jolted me from my bitter memories as he walked towards me, with something shiny in his hand. And then, a Plan B pack landed right between us on the bed.

""Take it,"" he commanded, ""Don't tell me you thought you could baby-trap me? Get real, Elena. This ain't some Hallmark movie fantasy.""

My stomach sank. Three years of degradation, of being treated like nothing more than a transaction, crystallized in that single moment. I'd been planning this for months, waiting for the right time, but suddenly I couldn't bear another second of this charade.

With trembling fingers, I reached for my purse, trying my best to ignore that stupid scar on my arm, and pulled out the divorce papers.

His eyebrow went up a little bit. ""Finally got your big move, huh? What does Stewart Group want this time? More money? More power?""

""Nothing,"" I stared right back at him. I wasn't going to back down. ""I paid back every single penny Stewart owed you. Every last cent.""

He blew out some cigar smoke and smirked at me. ""And you think I'm just gonna roll over and sign these papers? You've got another thing coming.""

""Do whatever the hell you want,"" I straightened my spine, even though my body was still in searing pain. ""I'm done playing this stupid game of being your pretend wife in this joke of a marriage.""

In two quick steps, Reginald was in front of me. The smoke from his cigarette hit my face, forcing a violent cough from my throat. My eyes watered from the smoke, but I refused to back down.

His fingers tapped the divorce papers. ""Still playing your little games? Or is this just another one of your desperate stunts to get my attention?""

I kept my voice steady despite the rage inside me. ""Guess what? You wanna hear something really funny? You're so obsessed with thinking I'm trying to manipulate you that you wouldn't know real feelings if they punched you in the face.""

""Real? Like when you threw yourself at me that night?"" He laughed as if I'd told the greatest joke. ""How long did you practice that little act?""

""I've been real with you since day one, you asshole,"" I fired back. ""Oh right - I forgot you can't handle anything that's actually genuine.""

For a split second, something flashed across his face - maybe it was doubt? Or anger? But it was gone quickly. He grabbed his pen and signed those divorce papers really quickly. ""Keep up the act, sweetie.""

He then tossed the papers on the floor. ""Though I gotta say,"" he pulled out a black card, ""you played your part pretty damn well."" He flicked the card at me. ""Think of it as..."" his smirk made me want to punch him right in his perfect teeth, ""payment for services rendered. You know, for being my fake wife.""

With that final laugh, he turned and walked out, slamming the door behind him.

The second he strutted out of the room, it was like all the life had been sucked out. Deadly quiet.

I just stood there. I don't even know how long. My hands were still shaking, but finally, I managed to pick up that stupid black card. The sharp edge caught my finger - a thin line of red appeared, but I barely felt it.

My eyes were burning, and I bit my lip so hard, I thought it was going to bleed. I was trying so hard not to cry, but the tears came anyway. But you know what? For the first time in a long, long time, those weren't just sad tears. They felt... freeing. Like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders.

I wiped my face, and all those years of taking his bullshit just turned into something else - something cold and hard inside me.

Looking around this penthouse - my gilded cage for the past three years - I suddenly couldn't stand another minute here. Every designer dress, every piece of jewelry, they all felt like chains now. I dropped my wedding ring on the nightstand. Let him keep his precious tokens of ownership.

I grabbed my laptop and a small bag I'd packed weeks ago but never had the courage to use. Funny how clear everything becomes when you finally stop being afraid.

The night air hit my face as I stepped out of the building. ""To the airport,"" I told the driver as I slid into the waiting car. My laptop was already open, fingers flying across the keyboard.

The city lights blurred past my window as Manhattan's skyline faded into the distance. That pushover who would do anything for the Stewart family? She died tonight. The real me - the one with dreams of making it in the tech world? She was finally breaking free.

Reginald's POV

Goddamn that woman!

Elena's words kept echoing in my head as I sped through Manhattan's empty streets in my Rolls-Royce.

Three years. Three fucking years of this charade. And now she pulls this shit? My mind kept drifting back to that night, the memory hitting me like a sucker punch straight to the gut.

That damn dinner party at the Stewart Villa? Nothing but a setup. Everyone had stared when I'd strutted in like the hotshot CEO. Looking back, it was really talking about walking straight into a bear trap with both eyes open.

Old man Stewart had pushed Elena on me all night, like she was merchandise. ""Meet my Stanford grad daughter.""

Elena had played her part perfectly—tight black dress, flirtatious glances, ""accidental"" touches. She had kept refilling my scotch glass. ""Special occasion,"" she'd said with that fake smile.

By midnight I'd been wasted, making a fool of myself. Adam had driven me home, practically carried me to my room. ""Boss, you're gonna have one hell of a hangover."" he had warned. If he had only known what was coming.

Then, right as planned, Elena had showed up at my door in a thin silk robe. ""Just checking on you,"" she had said, playing innocent.

She had then pulled that oldest trick in the book - had ""accidentally"" spilled water all over herself, ensuring that silk robe had become practically transparent. What had followed was a blur of passion - her nails had raked across my back, her theatrical moans had echoed through the rooms, loud enough to wake every sleeping soul in the estate.

The next morning, Adam's call had woken me up with the worst hangover ever. ""Boss, you need to see this right now.""

I'd checked his link, blood freezing. Photos of Elena entering my place had been all over social media. Financial news already speculating about a merger through marriage. I'd been played from the start.

Right on schedule, the Stewarts had shown up at my door two hours later. Elena had played the innocent victim, while her father had paced around my living room, acting all self-righteous.

""This is outrageous, Reginald,"" he had shouted, slamming his fist on my coffee table. ""You've destroyed my daughter's reputation!"" Then had come his real agenda: I had to marry Elena to ""save their family name,"" and how ""beneficial"" it would be for both companies.

He had even pulled out a pre-written prenup. With press outside and board members calling, I had had no choice.

For three years I've been living this lie, watching Elena play the perfect wife in public. And now she wants a divorce, but claims she doesn't want anything else? Bull-fucking-shit! A woman who schemes her way into marriage doesn't just walk away empty-handed.

I just drove away in my car, not knowing where to go. I couldn't stop thinking about what she'd said. My chest felt tight and I just needed to get away.

Ended up checking into a hotel - anywhere was better than going home. I knew I wouldn't get any sleep that night anyway. And I was right—spent hours staring at the ceiling, mind racing with anger.

The next morning, eyes burning from lack of sleep, I dragged myself to the Vanderbilt Estate, my eyes automatically scanning every corner. The fresh air had the sweet smell of the orchids that my grandfather, Richard, had taken such good care of.

Normally, at this time, I'd find Elena and Grandpa standing together, talking about how the orchids were growing. Her laugh would fill the air.

But today, just Grandpa's flowers blooming quietly. Their scent hung there, but no Elena.

Just then, Martha, our old butler, hustled over with fresh coffee. I tried to sound casual. ""Mrs. Vanderbilt hasn't shown up yet?""

She wouldn't look me in the eye. After a bit of hesitation, she finally said in a whisper, ""No, sir. Do you want me to call her?""

""Don't bother."" My voice came out harsher than I intended. In three years, Elena had never missed a day visiting Grandpa. Not one. That thought made my stomach turn.

Then Grandpa's demanding voice came from his greenhouse as he didn't even look up from his precious plants. ""Where's Elena?""

""No fucking clue. Crashed at a hotel last night."" I shrugged, trying to look indifferent.

""Have you lost your damn mind?"" Grandpa snapped, finally looking at me with those steel-gray eyes.

""Since when do I need a permission slip to sleep somewhere else?"" I shot back, my temper flaring.

He glared at me, his face reddening. ""Everything a Vanderbilt heir does needs the family's approval.""

He noticed the servants lowering their heads, pretending not to eavesdrop on our little family drama. Then he growled, ""Get your ass upstairs. Now.""

In his study, he shoved his tablet in my face. The headline hit me like a ton of bricks: #VivianDrakeAffair trending - Mystery Mogul Caught with Emmy Winner.

The photos were everywhere. It was just me helping Vivian after she twisted her ankle outside some restaurant. But the media had turned a simple act of being nice into a huge scandal.

""It's not what it looks like,"" I started to explain, but Grandpa's cold laugh cut me off.

""If it's not true, then fix it,"" he barked, slamming his fist on the desk. ""This mess you've created—have you even thought about what it does to Elena and the Stewarts?""

The thought of Elena running to him and playing the victim made my blood boil. ""What the hell does it have to do with her?""

""Don't play stupid with me!"" he exploded, and hurled his teacup straight at me.

I jumped out of the way, and the cup smashed on the carpet.

Grandpa stood there, chest heaving, his voice shaking with anger. ""As long as I draw breath, that woman will never be a real Vanderbilt! Don't make the same mistake as your father!""

Hearing him mention my father really got to me. I forced myself to take a deep breath and said, ""I know.""

His face softened just a fraction. After we discussed some business stuff—the only language we both really spoke—I walked out of his study. The weight of the Vanderbilt name felt heavier than ever on my shoulders.

After leaving the estate, I frowned as I called my assistant, Adam, ordering him to make that TikTok trend vanish.

By evening, I found myself parked outside my Fifth Avenue apartment - habit, or maybe just nowhere else to go.

Taking the elevator up, the day's chaos still spun in my head - Elena's divorce, Grandpa's rage, those headlines. The doors opened and I froze. Something was off. The lights I always left off were on. A half-empty wine glass sat on the coffee table - definitely not mine. Then I caught an unfamiliar jasmine perfume in the air - too sweet, too strong.

My fingers tightened around my keys as I noticed high heels carelessly tossed by the sofa, a white jacket draped over my armchair. A figure in white was standing by the window, the city lights creating a silhouette I didn't immediately recognize.

""Why the hell are you still here?"" I demanded, my voice echoing in the quiet space. When she didn't answer, I kept pushing. ""Didn't we just sign the divorce papers?""

The silence felt wrong - too playful, lacking Elena's usual measured grace. Before I could process what was happening, the figure spun around.

My face darkened as I realized the woman in the white dress was Vivian. But not just any white dress - it was the one I'd gotten Elena for our second anniversary.

""Reginald, you're back!"" Vivian came running toward me, arms outstretched, seemingly oblivious to my darkening expression.

The dress didn't quite fit her, revealing much of her ample curves as she embraced me. ""Miss me?""

Ignoring her flirtation, I changed the topic. ""Why are you wearing Elena's clothes?"" I kept my voice flat and controlled.

Vivian's laugh tinkled like crystal as she explained, ""Oh, I spilled coffee on my outfit earlier. Had to borrow something."" She sashayed toward me. ""Your wife won't mind, will she? Or should I say... ex-wife?""

""Where is she?""

""No idea."" Vivian shrugged. ""Place was empty when I got here. The maid let me in - she knows me well enough by now, doesn't she?""

She reached for me, perfectly manicured nails trailing down my arm. ""Reggie...""

I stepped back. ""Take it off. It doesn't suit you.""

""Come on, don't be so cold."" She pouted. ""I thought we could celebrate your newfound freedom. The papers are signed, aren't they?""

""How did you know about that?"" I asked coldly.

Her smile faltered for just a fraction of a second. ""Oh, please. Everyone knows you were headed for divorce. It was just a matter of time.""

""Meet me at Eclipse Lounge tonight,"" I cut her off, done with this circus. ""Get out.""

""But Reggie-""

""Now, Vivian.""

The second she was gone, I bolted upstairs. The master bedroom was a mess - the bed looked like someone had been rolling around in it. Not Elena's style at all. Her side of the closet was untouched though, all those designer pieces I'd bought her still hanging there. But the divorce papers from last night? Gone without a trace.

Something stank about this whole situation. I could feel it in my gut as I changed into a fresh suit, my mind racing.

Eclipse Lounge was packed when I walked in - trust fund brats throwing daddy's cash around, wannabe Instagram stars desperate for their next photo op, and the real sharks who ran this town from the shadows.

""Reginald!"" Marcus waved me over to the VIP section. ""About time you joined the land of the living again!""

""I've been swamped with work lately"" I muttered, sliding into a seat.

He barked out a laugh, snapping for drinks. ""Yeah right, like the mighty Vanderbilt empire needs you to lift a finger these days. But speaking of lifting things..."" He leaned in close enough I could smell the bourbon on his breath. ""Word on the street is you're finally kicking that gold-digger to the curb. 'Bout damn time, buddy.""

My vision went red. ""Watch your fucking mouth.""

""What? It's not exactly breaking news that she only wanted your bank account. I mean, a Stewart?"" He snorted. ""Though I gotta give her folks credit - that whole drunk hookup setup? Pretty slick move.""

Before I could respond, a ripple went through the crowd as Vivian walked in wearing a red dress. She moved through the crowd, greeting everyone with air kisses and fake smiles.

""Now that's what I'm talking about,"" Marcus whistled. ""A real queen for the Vanderbilt throne.""

The usual crowd of kiss-asses swarmed her immediately. I could see her eating up every word.

""Vivian, that dress is absolutely divine!""

""Red is definitely your color, darling!""

""Indeed, not everyone can shine like Vivian - just look at a poor princess from Stewart. She's become the industry's running joke.""

Vivian's laugh carried across the room. ""Everyone, please! Let's not waste time discussing the past. We're here to celebrate new beginnings, right?"" She shot me a look that made my skin crawl.

Marcus and James circled me like sharks. ""So Reginald, when are you and Vivian making it official?"" they asked with a wink.

""Yeah?"" I narrowed my eyes at him. ""Why are you hurry?""

Marcus's grin turned nasty. ""Just saying, why settle for bottom-shelf when you can have top-shelf?""

I knocked back my drink, fighting the urge to deck him.

Suddenly Adam materialized next to me, his voice low and urgent. ""Sir, one of our people spotted Mrs. Vanderbilt at JFK.""

My heart stopped. ""What?""

""Security footage matches her description, but we lost her at international terminal.""

""Keep me posted."" I said before Adam nodded and left. Elena at the airport? The missing papers?

At this moment, Marcus called everyone to gather into a circle for a game, pulling me back from my thoughts. ""Truth or dare time! No chickening out, Reg!""

""What are we, in high school?"" I grumbled, but let myself get dragged into their stupid game.

After a few rounds, the bottle's neck pointed right at me.

Some drunk socialite giggled. ""Reggie's turn! Truth or dare?""

""Truth."" Let's get this over with.

""How did you and Vivian really meet? There's like, so many stories going around...""

The memory hit me like a punch to the gut. Fifteen years ago. The taste of fear. The sound of my own screams echoing off concrete walls.

""She saved my life,"" I said flatly. ""Kidnapping attempt when I was twelve. She helped me escape.""

""OMG, that's like, so dramatic!"" The socialite was practically swooning. ""Just like a movie!""

""Speaking of movies,"" Marcus piped up, ""Vivian, what's this Oscar buzz I'm hearing about?""

But I was barely listening. Something about that kidnapping memory felt... off. Like trying to recall a dream that keeps slipping away. The details were fuzzy, distorted. I remembered being terrified, remembered running through dark corridors, but Vivian's face in those memories... it seemed somehow wrong, like a badly edited photo.

Next thing I knew, Vivian was all over me. Catching my distant expression, she tried to pull my attention back to her. ""Take me home?"" she murmured, breath warm against my ear.

I barely remember nodding, my mind still churning over Elena at the airport. The memory of that crash kept flickering through my head too - something wasn't adding up, but I couldn't put my finger on what.

The car ride was dead silent. Suffocating.

Vivian kept shooting me these little sideways glances, her perfect smile getting tighter each time I ignored her attempts at small talk.

""Come up for a drink?"" Vivian's voice jolted me back to reality as we pulled up to her place. She was drawing circles on my chest with those talons of hers, but all I could think about was how Elena would always trace hearts there instead.

I was just about to tell her where she could stick that drink when my phone exploded with an incoming call. Grandpa's voice ripped through the speaker: ""YOU IDIOT! What's this bullshit about a divorce?""

Grandpa's voice exploded through my phone like a nuclear bomb, making me pull it away from my ear. ""Have you completely lost your mind? Get your ass back to the estate before I drag you here myself!""

I glanced at Vivian in her attention-grabbing red dress by the entrance. When did she become so annoying?

""Not. Now."" I growled, already turning away from her pouty face.

""Don't you dare 'not now' me, you little shit!"" The line went dead with a bang that matched my growing headache.

""Reggie?"" Vivian's voice was sugary. ""Everything okay?""

""Rain check."" I didn't even look back as I slid into my car, driving to the Fifth Avenue Apartment. My mind was too busy replaying Elena's last words on repeat, ""You're so obsessed with thinking I'm manipulating you that you wouldn't know real feelings if they bit you in the ass.""Damn her for always being so... right.

The second I walked into the apartment, something felt wrong. Like walking into a tomb. That subtle jasmine scent that always made the place feel like home? Gone. Just... gone.

""Shit,"" I muttered in the empty rooms.

The master bedroom looked normal - bed perfectly made, Elena's style. Then I saw my black card on the nightstand with a blood stain.

I had my phone out before I could think. ""When the hell did she leave?"" I barked at Adam.

""6 AM sharp, sir. Town car to JFK. We're tracking her movements but..."" Adam's voice had that careful tone he uses when he knows I'm about to lose it.

The walk-in closet hit me like a ton of bricks. All those designer pieces I'd bought her hung there. But her old stuff? The clothes she'd brought from Stewart Villa? Vanished. Like she was erasing every trace of the life we'd built. Or pretended to build.

A timid cough from the doorway made me spin around. A maid stood there wringing her hands like a bad soap opera extra.

""Good evening, sir."" The maid bobbed her head nervously. ""Would you like me to inform Mrs. Vanderbilt that you're home?""

My whole body went rigid. ""What do you mean?""

""I... I haven't seen her all day, but I assumed..."" The maid trailed off, wilting under my stare. ""She always returns before dinner...""

I angrily pulled her to the closet and demanded, ""Do you see anything wrong with this closet?""

The maid quickly scanned the contents before hesitantly replying, ""Mrs. Vanderbilt's own clothes... they're all gone.""

""Get out!"" The whiskey glass left my hand before I could think, shattering against the wall in a spray of glass. The maid bolted like she'd seen a demon. Maybe she had.

My phone buzzed - Adam again. ""Got something, sir. She booked a flight to Paris.""

I actually laughed out loud. ""Bullshit. She fucking hates France.""

The memory hit me like a truck - that disaster of a charity gala two years ago. Some French businessman getting handsy with Elena, me too busy schmoozing investors to notice. She'd never forgiven me for that one. Just added it to her list of my failures, probably.

""First class ticket, bought this morning,"" Adam continued. ""But here's the thing - she never boarded.""

Of course she didn't. Elena always had backup plans. But why leave the expensive stuff? Why the blood?

I stood in the quiet bedroom for what felt like an eternity. Feeling agitated, I stepped over the fragments and walked out of the room.

Downstairs, the maid was startled by my dark face. She looked at me, wanting to say something, but I cut her off with a cold stare. ""You don't need to come back tomorrow,"" I said icily.

If she couldn't even tell that someone as significant as Elena had disappeared, there was no sense in keeping her on.

Leaving the apartment, I sat in my car and lit a cigarette. The crimson flame stood out sharply against the night as a cold smile played across my lips. Did Elena really think she could just walk in and out of the Vanderbilt family as she pleased?

Since my parents' accident, I hadn't felt such consuming anger. The irony - I'd wanted Elena to divorce me for Vivian. Now Elena's gone, and all I want is to find her. After years of business success, this was my first real failure.

Two weeks crawled by like a hangover. Meetings, sleepless nights, more meetings. Every lead on Elena turned to smoke. The Paris ticket? Dead end. Credit cards? Silent. Phone? Dead.

Then a package showed up.

Plain envelope, no return address. Inside: divorce papers and a note: \[Done pretending. Enjoy your freedom. P.S. - Before accusing others of drugging you, check your drink. Karma's a bitch.\]

I stared at those words. That night at Stewart Villa... had I really been that stupid? That blind?

My phone lit up. Vivian texted: \[Missing you baby... dinner?\]

I looked at her message, Elena's note, and the empty apartment still waiting for her.

For the first time in three years, I wondered if I'd been the biggest fool in a game I didn't even know I was playing.

""Sir?"" Adam appeared, looking uncomfortable. ""The board is waiting. And... sir? You might want to fix your tie.""

I looked in the mirror. Shit. When had I started looking so... lost?

""Yeah."" I straightened up, packed away the confusion and that dangerous feeling that felt too much like regret. I had an empire to run. Elena had made her choice.

After a year-long search, there was still no sign of Elena, as if she had vanished into thin air.

I rubbed my temples, feeling the exhaustion. It was time to end it.

I looked up at Adam, who was standing at the other end of the office waiting for instructions, and said calmly, ""Call off the search.""",1,1754668158.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Though, following some extreme stress in his life (his parents getting divorced, and graduating with more loans than he was made aware of) we have struggled both financially and romantically.

My life has been extremely stable. I graduated debt free and I got a job where i make around 70k a year. His parents sold his childhood home, causing us to need to move out, and get an apartment together so he can continue to study (he is on a path to becoming a pilot, and is mid way through training) and I can work. The only problem is, he is drained financially and emotionally. He works part time, and makes enough to cover about 1/3 of our rent and slowly pay back his loans. Beyond this, every cent is put towards flying.

Obviously, I am exhausted. I work from 7-5 most days, and try to keep up with laundry, groceries, etc. Because of this, we have what feels like no time for romance. Generally, I am the one to initiate sex. I know what makes him happy and de-stresses him, so I do that, whether it be putting on cute little outfits, cooking his favorite foods, planning dates, going for long walks w him after work. The only problem is that I feel as though I do it all. We have arguments almost every other week about me wanting to feel special and noticed, and him responding that he can’t take me on dates or treat me because he has no money.

In addition to this, he is very rarely able to see his friends, but when he does, he will take them to the movies to see something they’re really interested in, or will take a friend out for coffee and a walk in a park. This crushes me, understandably, because it is all I want. I want him to notice the things i like and the activities i want to do, and plan to do them with me. I feel as though I work so hard for us and our relationship, just to feel that he pays more attention to what his friends enjoy than me. This morning, we got into an argument where i basically begged him to pick me flowers on his way home, or take me for a picnic, or open doors for me, just keep the spark alive with me and make me feel actively pursued or attractive or wanted. He was somewhat understanding, but upset as he thought us going for walks, or him paying for dinner once was enough to be classified as a “date.”

I don’t want to beg to be treated like a woman anymore. I feel as though we are roommates who have sex, but only when I ask to. Everything takes me planning extensively and pulling teeth, and he is constantly stressed and anxious. His family still stresses him out, his career stresses him out, financials stress him out. I just don’t know what to do. How can I make him understand what I need, as well as not stress him out further?",2,1754668034.0,relationship_advice,10,1.0,False

Please critique!!,"Sat at the very centre of the big, and really rather messy goop of cosmic jelly that is our universe, there is a tree. There shouldn’t be.
When at an extremely important, yet entirely unfortunate part, of a universes’ creation, it gets dropped and suddenly a tree (which has absolutely no right in being there) has appeared at its’ core; one would assume it’s creators would throw it away and start again. It was however the last of the stardust they’d just used…
“It’ll be alright won’t it?” A thunderous voice bellowed from within the dark nothingness.
“Nah, it’s buggered.” A second announced knowingly. “Look at the consistency of it, the stardust is getting into all the places it shouldn’t do. It won’t work like it’s s’posed to.”
“It’ll have to do” A third, more assertive yet altogether disappointed voice spoke from the abyss.
And thus was the creation of the known universe; despite various differing accounts of shamans, priests and holy-men alike, who all seem to have something to say on the topic.  Woden, and his brothers, Wilo and Wiha, had been tasked with shaping the matter of the universe into a functioning, law abiding, system of rules and regulations. It was a job they now feared they wouldn’t have for much longer. 
The tree now floated at the centre of space and time, its roots and branches growing quickly, like a bed of writhing eels. They slithered and wriggled between themselves, intertwining as if reaching out for one-another. Amongst these tendrils, the three entities now watched, small particles of the stardust come swirling together to form burning lights .
“Well that definitely shouldn’t be happening” The voice known as Wilo said, pointing out the obvious.
“No, you’re right brother.” Came the reply from Wiha. “Definitely not suppose’ to be doin’ that.”
Woden was the eldest of the three and somewhat the wiser of the brothers. It hadn’t taken him long at all to realise what was going on:
“It’s life you fools! The impact must have compacted too much of the dust together in one space.” Woden spoke.
“Isn’t life suppose’ to come later on, once we’ve designed all the creatures big n’ small, and named ‘em?”
Woden thought about this for a moment. This series of events his brother was describing was the way things usually worked, as Woden well knew, having had done this same routine some 60 billion times before - but there was no other answer for what was happening before them. It had to be life. Only this version of it wasn’t a well thought out script that had to play by their universal laws. This one seemed to play by it’s own.
“Well err… Yes… Usually.” He eventually replied. “But I think that knock may have messed with the fundamental nature of this one. It appears as if life has, for absolutely no reason that had anything to do with us, simply sparked itself into existence.”
“Ah… Bollocks..”.

***

The carriage shuddered as it came to a sudden stop, its wheels screeching over the wet cobblestones, spraying puddle water up onto the coach box. Two cloaked figures sat perched upon it, illuminated only by a sliver of moonlight that had taken the opportunity to escape from between a gap in the rain clouds.
“I hate the evenings this time of year” came a grumble from the driver; the words appearing in the frigid air as wafts of steam.
“We all do Lum, it's the sodding rain. Park her up while I go find out what's going on”. The second figure sprung down from the carriage landing with a splatter in the stream of rainwater that had formed at the side of the carriageway. They repositioned their heavy waxed cloak in an effort to keep the worst of the deluge out. An attempt that in all honesty wasn't working; a point highlighted by the fact that the cheap leather boots worn by the figure had already let in water.
The shape appeared to shrug, then made its way towards a small doorway just off the road, sheltered under an overhanging first floor, as the rattling of the carriage disappeared around a narrow street corner.
On either side of the cheap wooden door to what was honestly little more than a poorly kept and dingy set of rooms, were two more cloaked silhouettes, busying themselves in whispered conversation. They had found what must have been the only available dry spot, a narrow strip under the overhang, their backs forced right up against the wall. The faces of the pair were intermittently illuminated by the amber glow of a cigarette the larger of the two was smoking. The squelching of approaching footsteps caught their attention, bringing the smaller of the pair abruptly to an upright position.
“You the boys from Ascett?” Asked the larger of the figures through a lungful of cigarette smoke, tossing the butt to the floor and extinguishing it on the cobblestones with an expert twist of his boot. The voice was gruff and gave the impression they’d spent one too many nights standing around in the frigid rain. “About time you showed your faces. We were only supposed to be lending a hand with this. What's your name anyway son?”
A match was suddenly struck close to their face, lighting another cigarette which now hung between the lips of what appeared to be a huge bearded man. The flickering light from the flame unveiled a rugged face that had been weathered by perhaps 40 winters or so, although their eyes gave away that they were likely younger.
“You know what it's like. Boss is trying to run several jobs in this town and there’s only so many of us to go round. The name’s Briggs by the way.”
Briggs had learned fairly quickly that the old sweats seemed to respect you more if you mirrored their attitude of seemingly being fed up by the fact you were still breathing by the end of the day.
The bearded man nodded approvingly, then ushered his smaller counterpart over with a wave of his hand. 
“This here’s, Mouse. He’s new to the family but he'll fill you in on what we've got here so far”
The skinny figure that was Mouse, now lurching towards Briggs, was quite noticeably an academy leaver. He was dressed in a clean and recently pressed black uniform, its brass buttons highly polished and glinting in the cigarette light. It was an odd reflection for Briggs, to think that only a few years ago that had been him. His buttons had long since turned green and matted from oxidation, and his trousers were more or less held together at this point, by a complex patchwork of stitching where they’d been ripped and torn on so many occasions.
Mouse stood rigidly as he puffed out his chest, trying his best to appear confident, before he meekly squeaked out the words:  
“Well… at this point, to be honest… we’re thinking, well… it’s, err… a bit odd”
“A bit odd?” The bearded man roared with laughter. “Well that’s certainly one way of putting it! There’s cadavers in there without no bleedin’ eyes!”
Briggs felt his eyes roll as he let out an audible sigh that floated in the night. The thought of bodies behind that flimsy door with holes where the eyes should be, filled him with the sudden realisation that this wasn’t going to be a quick job. He had been hoping for an easy shift this evening. He’d not been able to sleep the day through before leaving for work, and no amount of the strong sticky black tar that was the station coffee had been able to revive him.
Briggs had joined the watchmen in the hope that he would be chasing criminals and just this, dealing with suspicious dead bodies. And to many, that was all the job was. All the novels and tales he’d heard basically glamorized the solving of the puzzle of who had done it.  However, now that he was suddenly faced with the situation in the flesh, Briggs couldn’t help but be filled with dread.
“Well this is going to be a lot of paperwork…” he thought to himself out loud. “Have you sent for the watch sergeant yet?”
“Yeah, sent for ‘em practically soon as we opened the door. Proper weird in there, you wanna take a look?” came the reply from behind the beard.
“Might want to cover your face though, it stinks in there.” squeaked Mouse through a grimace.
Briggs found himself edging forwards. He hadn’t really planned to go in at this point, but the morbid curiosity of human nature seemed to be dragging him towards the door, his hand reaching out towards the doorknob.
He was suddenly brought back to reality by the sound of rapidly approaching footsteps. That must be Lum back from the carriage he thought to himself. As he turned, he noticed the silhouette of his partner jogging towards them, a lamp extended before him hanging from his right arm swinging excitedly from the maneuver. 
“Flipping rain!” Lum exclaimed grumpily as he drew closer, hurrying himself into the slither of dryness up against the wall.
“No eyes Lum…”
“Guessing they didn’t see it coming then?” Lum chuckled under his breath. “Well… this is gonna take all night.” He stated to the group. “You gone in yet?”
“Nah” replied Briggs “These two have, but better not until sarge arrives, just in case we mess up something evidential. You guys will probably have to stay to brief him when he gets here since you’ve already gone in” he said, pointing towards the other two with a tilt of his head.
The group elected that this was for the best through a collective nodding of their heads in agreement. If there was one thing you didn’t want to do in their profession, it was to upset a senior watchman. They had a nasty and rather creative imagination for coming up with ways to repay the favor.

The four tried their best to remain in the thin patch of dryness for what felt like hours, the cold and rain whipping the faces of them all, bar the large bearded man who seemed unfazed by the weather, content in his chain smoking of what appeared to Briggs, to be a seemingly endless supply of cigarettes. 
As it approached what felt like midnight, Briggs watched a chubby little man across the street poke his balding head out from a door to guard his small yappy dog that had sprinted out from between his legs, whilst it went about its business on the wet cobbles. The man made no attempt to clean up the mess before quickly closing the door once the dog had returned. Briggs couldn’t really blame him considering the weather.
The distinctive sound of the clip-clopping of a carriage could be heard approaching shortly after. The noise of metal horseshoes striking the cobbles echoed into the night, getting louder as they drew closer. A large black wagon pulled up, a single driver sat atop the coach box. Briggs recognised the driver from the Ascett station. It was Sergeant Fielding. A large, burly chap with an appetite for solving crime, and what appeared to be an even larger appetite for anything served with an alcohol content and from a keg - this had left him over the years, with a permanent red glow to his face and nose, and the inability to formulate a whole sentence without a hiccup randomly occupying the space between his words.
Briggs hadn't often worked alongside Sergeant Fielding, which probably was, in large part due to the fact the sergeant could usually be found slumped over a table in the station bar, but the sergeant had always seemed considerably friendly for a senior watchman, giving a nod of acknowledgement when passing Briggs at the station. 
“Well, well, *hic!* Well… next of kin in the *hic!*, err… shackles yet then? *Hic!*” Said the sergeant, a hand clutched to his chest and sounding to Briggs as if suffering from indigestion.
This was fairly normal protocol for jobs relating to dead bodies. Usually if there had been suspicion of foul play, the grimy finger of the law would sternly point straight in the face of the spouse or estranged child and yell: “You’re nicked!”, and nine times out of ten with little to no evidence they were hanged the next day, thus proving their guilt on the matter. Well that was the way things normally went anyhow. Briggs however was more of a new school ideologist on the concept of criminal thinking, and felt that asking a few questions before opening the trapdoor usually left him with a lot less explaining to do the next day, when inevitably, little Miss Miggins came in with a vital piece of exonerating evidence just moments after a flock of ravens rustled and squacked into the air following the sound of a loud, intense ‘crack’ of rope.
It occurred to Briggs that the senior management really ought to find a better place for this kind of evidence. The carpets at the station were after all becoming a trip hazard, and he was surprised more Watchmen hadn't been given the sack. You’d need a fair few sacks to clean up the amount of stuff that had been kicked under that musty green material over the years he thought.
“No Sergeant!” Blurted out Mouse. “Watchmen present all agreed to preserve the scene and handover to yourself, Sergeant!”. 
“Alright… *hic!*... Junior, err.. watchman..? *hic!*” Came the reply from the sergeant, his eyelids forced into a squint as if they were trying to catch the name of this young beanpole of a watchman from flying off into the night.
“Narrowford, Sergeant!”
“Right.. right.. yes.. *hic!*. Quite right anyhow. You must always wait for the senior watch-*hic!*-man, to err, assess the scene before rushing off and making, err… *hic!* Decisions for yourself, ha ha!” Sergeant Fielding clambered down from atop his carriage, a feint which was rather unglamorous. Dismounted, with a spin and landed in front of the four seeking refuge from the rain, swaying forward and back with his arms straight out to the sides, before blowing out a sigh of effort, and walking towards the group.
“Let's, err… let's *hic!*, have a look inside then shall we?”

So this is following my ex situationship where he lied to me for months about sleeping with others and has repeatedly lied to me about other things big and small. My other post can provide a bit more context but I stupidly contacted him last night to confront him about the suspected stalking. 

I have monitored bot accounts (which apparently appear from third party websites) and a couple of genuine burner accounts (0 posts, 0 followers, 0 following, ambiguous name) watching my public stories for the past month and proven to myself again and again that it’s him. It would only be one viewer 99% of the time and the view time would be consistent when a person would be awake or asleep. It was never consistently instant or in the middle of the night. Almost always reasonable evening or morning time and this is the sort of thing he does. He times responses, used to watch my snapmaps, reacts to whether I watch his stories or not, tries to make me jealous etc.

However, if I’m being honest, I was initially almost flattered by the idea that he could be obsessed enough to watch me secretly like that with seemingly no motivation apart from potentially missing me. So I allowed it and tested it. Posted things which I knew might provoke him (that I was back in our city) and saw two bot accounts appear (for two watches at different times of day). Then one day, another burner appeared but it followed me and my dad’s company. And then it followed my dad himself and even my grandma. When I saw it was following my grandma and other accounts related to my family I knew it had to be him. But instead of feeling happy to have what felt like certainty, it felt more like a violation. It felt creepy that he was involving my family in this. So I decided to put an end to it, if not also for my own mental state to stop thinking about it. 

<<<<<<<<< “CONVERSATION” >>>>>>>>>>>

I messaged the account directly:

“Hi, sorry who is this? Do you know my family?”

The user opened the message the next day and didn’t respond. That is something my ex would frequently do and I couldn’t understand why an innocent follower wouldn’t just respond with an explanation. So I said:

“Right. So should I assume that this and any other suspicious accounts are you (his name)? Because there's only one person in the world who knows about my dad's Instagram, my grandmother's dog, the coffee shop, and has a motivation to stay anonymous”

He did not respond. I started to feel a lot more upset. Like I was being gaslit again. Lied to by omission. I knew it was him and he wasn’t admitting to it. I started to feel crazy so I decided to go private. The night that I went private, I got a follow request from yet another suspicious account that doesn’t have any mutuals. And suddenly it hit me with how violated and betrayed I felt by his secret watching. I don’t know if this specific account is him or not, but I realized how paranoid I had become. I genuinely have no idea if it would be or not.

He knows that I have anxiety but I have never lashed out at him. Never cursed. Barely even been angry. Never really anxiously texted him. I have been very restrained and tried to express my feelings in a healthy way without attacking so he would understand where I am coming from. And every time he has lied or denied or blamed me until the point that I’m at now.

 This is what I said: 
“This is really embarrassing for me okay because I don't want to have to say this and I'm sorry to send such a long message but this is my last attempt not to hate you.

I don't have proof that the gardening account or the OnlyFans bots that have been watching me for the past month are you. But even if you said they weren't, I wouldn't believe you. I don't know if that's just a symptom of how much you've lied to me and twisted reality, but please stop if it is.

I went private, and I wake up to a follow request from another seemingly random account. I have no reason to think it's you except for everything else that's already happened. It made me feel physically sick and I started panicking. I am so worn down and overwhelmed with stress from how often you have lied to me or twisted reality. Every time something new happens I shake from the anxiety.

Just please say you won't do it again even if I go back to public. And actually don't do it anymore. I'm really done this time okay, I don't want anything else from you.”

He said:

“Hi (my name). Okay so, l'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt that this is a serious message and not a prank. This is despite this probably being the wildest and most unhinged message l've ever received.

Let me be perfectly clear. I do not have the time or energy to make up false accounts to follow you. I'm not that interested in what's going on in your life. I only messaged this summer to try and square up, but I quickly realised that was a mistake, and since then I haven't been interested in the slightest to contact you again or keep up with anything you do.

I realise this can come off a little harsh, but from your messages it seems like this is what you need to hear. Frankly, from what you're saying you might want to see someone to talk about your issues. I sincerely do wish you the best but please, for both our sake, don't contact me again like this.”

I said:

“I did think what if despite everything you would try to deny again. And I thought well even if you were going to lie, at least if I am clearly very upset you'd at least be kind enough to say ""I'd never do something like that, I hope you feel better"" but I knew it was more likely you'd aggressively defend yourself and blame me once again. Your lying really is compulsive and I shouldn't have been second guessing myself for so long.

So although I was hoping that you might just be kind or honest for once, this does still make things easier in a way because you have proven that is not possible. My goal was not an apology anyway. Just please stop watching me and my family. I hope this is what you wanted.”",2,1754667492.0,AITAH,14,1.0,False

Initially our plan was to get an smaller oval or rectangular coffee table that would be placed by the shorter portion and leave the area in front of the sectional open, but now we’re wondering if having a longer coffee table places farther away might be a better option?

I’ve included the photo with the dimensions for reference, the sectional portion sticks out 12 inches. The shorter side is around 50 inches long, which would give us room for a 42-48inch coffee table if we did the shorter route. 

We do want our coffee table to be functional for game nights so more surface area is definitely better.

By the time someone refers to their job as “wage slavery,” they’re not just being dramatic, they’re reflecting a deeper cultural fatigue.

The phrase has become common parlance, especially online, where criticism of traditional 9-to-5 jobs is often delivered with a mix of cynicism and righteous fire. You’ve seen the memes: gray cubicles, lifeless coffee breaks, existential dread at the printer. The modern office, we’re told, is a soul-sucking void. And to be fair, sometimes it is.

But recently I’ve started to wonder: Is all this disdain for steady work just honest frustration, or is it also, somehow, a setup?

1mkyfvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1mkyfvm/does_the_ninja_express_food_processor_deliver_on/,Does the Ninja Express Food Processor Deliver on Efficiency and Power?,"Ninja NJ110GR has been a regular in my kitchen for a while, and, honestly, it’s earned its place on the counter. Compact, lightweight, and ridiculously easy to use, this food chopper packs some serious power despite its modest appearance. Every time I grab it for chopping onions, mincing garlic, or blending small recipes, I’m impressed by how much functionality they’ve crammed into this little thing. It’s not perfect, but it’s pretty darn close for anyone who needs quick meal prep without the fuss of larger appliances.

**Compact Design Means Convenience**  
One of the first things I noticed about the food processing unit is how small and lightweight it is. The Ninja NJ110GR weighs just 1.1 pounds, so moving it around the kitchen—or even taking it to a friend's cooking party—is totally hassle-free. Its 16-ounce bowl offers just enough capacity for smaller tasks like grinding nuts, but don’t go expecting it to churn out large family meals in one go. Paired with its gray aesthetic, the device fits smoothly with nearly every modern or minimalistic kitchen setup.  

**Efficiency in Every Chop**  
The 200-watt motor was a pleasant surprise. I didn’t expect so much chopping power from such a tiny gadget. Whether I’m making salsa, grinding breadcrumbs, or pulverizing nuts for desserts, this processor delivers consistent results every time. The chopping blade handles softer ingredients like herbs without turning them into mush while handling tougher vegetables effortlessly. Grinding coffee beans? Check. Prepping meats for a quick recipe? Double-check. For its size, the performance is truly impressive.  
[Time to see Ninja NJ110GR cost on Amazon.](https://tastyshow.com/p/b081vrb8ck/)

**Good Aspects of the Ninja NJ110GR**  
- Compact and space-saving design makes it ideal for tight kitchens.  
- 200-watt motor handles chopping, grinding, and mincing effortlessly.  
- Dishwasher-safe components make cleanup a breeze.  
- The simple one-touch operation is beginner-friendly.

**Bad Points to Watch For**  
- Limited 16-ounce capacity isn’t great for prepping large meals.  
- Hand-wash instructions for certain parts may be a deal-breaker for some.  
- The plastic build can feel slightly underwhelming if you’re expecting a premium feel.

**Ease of Use and Controls**  
Operating this chopper is as simple as it gets. The one-touch pulsing feature gives you control over how finely—or coarsely—you want your ingredients chopped. Since there aren’t complicated settings or speed dials to fuss over, it’s perfect for people who aren’t exactly tech-savvy. The locking mechanism ensures the blade stays secure, although I had to get used to positioning the lid just right.  

**Safety and Maintenance**  
Safety seems well-thought-out here, especially with its locking mechanism preventing use unless everything is securely in place. I appreciated that, considering I have curious kids snooping around the kitchen. Cleaning the bowl and the blade is super easy, as they’re dishwasher-safe. That said, I tend to hand-wash these parts to maintain their longevity better.  

**Market Rivals**  
While the Ninja NJ110GR impresses with its efficiency and compact design, it does face stiff competition in the compact food processor category. Products like the Cuisinart Mini-Prep Processor stand as strong competitors. The latter offers higher wattage but lacks the same ease of use when it comes to cleaning. On the other hand, another rival, the Black+Decker HC150B, offers a more budget-friendly option. However, the plastic feels slightly less sturdy than Ninja’s compact chopper. Where this gadget truly steps ahead is in its balance of power, portability, and ease of cleaning.  

**Affordable Quality Perspective**  
In terms of cost efficiency, the Ninja NJ110GR definitely strikes a balance between affordability and functionality. It’s not a premium food processor, but you get what you pay for—and probably a little more. You won’t find unnecessary bells and whistles here, but if you’re someone who values a reliable chopper for quick tasks, the price feels justifiable. Sure, it’s not equipped for heavy-duty grinding or endless food prep, but for its intended use, it’s worth every penny.

I currently have 15mm 3.5 voigt for z and 20mm 1,8 g for f mount as my two widest. I actively shoot with both a d850 and z7ii for events. Want to make a decision for tax free weekend. 

Tamron
- newer tech
- takes filters
- smaller
- good for events
- only works for z mount
- is narrower 30mm. 

Nikon
- legacy piece
- cheap used around 500 usd
- made in Japan
- works with both all my cameras. 
- goes wider

I guess the Nikon makes most sense in regards to when I will use it. I normally use the 24-70 2,8s on the z7ii and the 70-200 2.8e on the d850. But if I get the f mount then I can switch between the 14-24 and 70-200 depending on the venue. For example, I did a coffee shop opening and it was tight; so I didn’t bother even using the d850 with 70-200 as it was crowded and not really useful in the scenario. If I had this 14-24 I probably would have utilized it a little

*‍*\-CHI Cubs Team Total Over 4.5 (-115) | 0.5 Units

‍**Why This Pick?**

**‍**St. Louis Starter Michael McGreevy (5.08 ERA)  has allowed 11 runs in just his last two starts, friends. On the other side, Cubs starter Matthew Boyd (2.34 ERA) is an impressive 11-4, and has allowed 5 runs across his last 5 starts. Boyd notably got blown up by the Milwaukee Brewers on July 28th, but has allowed 0 runs in 4 of his last 5 outings. The Over has cashed in 4 of McGreevy’s last 5 starts – but to be frank, I don’t think the Cardinals will get much past Boyd today. If the Over cashes it will likely be the Cubs’ doing. I know the Chicago offense has been a bit shaky lately, but this is the perfect spot for them to turn up. My money’s on the visitors to put at least 5 on the board.

____________________________________

The morning light assails your eyes; piercing the slight gap between your lids, prying you into a conscious state. Your movements are slow, stiff as you come alive again. Your body aches, your legs tense, neck heavy.

You raise your head just enough off your pillow. You take inventory. The room is messy. The curtains do little to hold back the morning light, revealing the grime that clings to the walls. The dust that has settled on that old pile of clothes.

To your left, your wallet. It's half-opened, face down on the bed. To your right, your phone. You reach for it limply. It's glare feels intense in your haze of drowsiness. 

It's full of notifications. From your bank, from gifting sites. ""You paid $20 to... $20 to... $30 to... $50 to..."" and so on. Beneath the weight of all of those sends, you see an alert from your bank, something about a counter fraud helpline. A link to a gambling aid resource. You dismiss it. Deeper still beneath the vibrant, lurid send notifications, you find a text message. ""Mom"". A brief ache clenches you, tightly, before you dismiss that as well.

You raise to an upright position on your bed, still half wrapped in duvet. You take stock of the surroundings again. More clearly this time as the fog of sleep dissipates. Dishes that once hosted a hastily cooked meal. A dusty book under the bed; you started it months a go. The door is closed. The room is hot. The smell of you lingers in the air - a grim reminder of the frenzy you worked yourself up into hours before.

You lurch to your feet, and step towards the window. You see a neighbour stuffing their kids into the back of a minivan. Another out for a walk with their dog. You catch the time - 8:30. Your home office beckons you forth for another day at the grind.
You crack open the window to relieve the heat in the room. A breeze immediately invades the narrow opening. It's sharp. It insights a shiver, yet something about it feels comforting.

You trudge up to your desk to prepare for the day ahead. You're greeted with dozens of emails. A passive aggressive message from your co-worker. You see the hearty ""Good morning!"" texts flood the work chat. You roll your eyes.

You glance down at your phone again. You check your balance, finally confronting the damage of last night. It's bad. Not catastrophic. But it leaves an unshakeable sting. You slam the phone down and sigh. You glance out the window again. Leaves are whirling on the ground. The sun shines down on the roads and pavement; it looks inviting. Healing. A cat leaps from a neighbours fence, attempting to catch a magpie. It fails spectacularly, but walks on proudly, as if it were entirely disinterested in it's hunt after all.

You look back down at your phone again. You don't open it this time. You just stare at the blank screen. You seethe. Another work email lands. Deadlines. Priorities. Requests. Queries, all building up. You step away from your chair, suddenly determined. You march down the stairs. You grab a coffee. A half-breakfast. You return to your desk. Push your phone aside.

""Never again.""

You feel an itch. Subtle, but potent. You know exactly what it's directing you to. You look at your phone again. You open the apps you've become so familiar with. But then- ""NO.""
This wasn't healthy, you knew that. You hated how it made you feel once it was over. What she reduced you to. Why was it all so difficult? Why couldn't you shake this? 

Then a thought. You could. You could absolutely shake this. You deleted the apps. X, Instagram, Throne. You had done it all before, but something felt different this time. You felt a discipline. You looked out the window again and felt a calming resolve. A confidence.

You wondered though; ""is it just me?"" You take to Reddit. You scour the app for any signs of others engaged in the conflict you feel. You see groups celebrating it. Trying to matchmake subs and dommes. You see feeds of porn, laced with all the triggering captions you'd become accustomed to. A breeding ground of degeneracy.

Amongst the playgrounds of sexual deviancy, something stands out, a little taller in your mind than the rest. r/paypigsupportgroup. 

You take a look and immediately feel a comfort that the top rated posts aren't some triggering images. Instead, you are greeted with conversation. Some indeed celebrating findom, in defence of it. Others talking of struggles, hardships, low-points in their journeys.

You expand these posts and feel a warmth. You read the stories of others; their losses, their conflicting feelings. The mutuality of their struggle envelopes you in a bizarre comfort - you feel sympathy, but an understanding. A strong, lament-filled understanding.

You delight at the comments below. The encouragement offered by other subs. Even by other dommes! You catch one comment seemingly celebrating the struggle, enocuraging or inviting them to relapse. Though it appears the community stands against it in this case. Shaming the commenter for their attempt at capitalising on the poster's vulnerability.

After delving Further into post after post: it becomes clear to you that while unable to agree or celebrate everything that the community is discussing, this is the closest to a safe haven you have found to date. You feel comfortable sharing in a space like this. You might just be able to articulate your own journey, while others provide insights of their own - piecing it altogether, making sense of it all.

And so you post. You talk of your domme. The intense highs she makes you feel. The powerful regret and anguish she leaves you with. You express the conflict of it all. You call it an addiction and do so with revelation as you have witnessed others in the group describe it so. You open yourself for advice. For guidance. You ask how others cope with it all. 

Upon posting, a relief washes over you. You sense a positive development in your journey. Traction on the post is slow, but gradually comments begin to emerge. Some relating to your journey; the exact point you are at in this moment. Others offering humble insight from the lessons they have learned, clear veterans of sorts in the findom scene. You see encouragement from what appear to be domme accounts. While hesitant to take their feedback, you cannot deny how genuine their comfort appears. 

After engaging with some of the contributions, you set your phone down. You prepare dinner. A smile adorned across your face. You cook more emphatically - no microwave meal tonight, something real, with substance. A small feat perhaps, but a genuine leap forward in your mind.

Suddenly, the smile fades. Something has gone unaccounted for. You polish off the meal and retreat upstairs, seizing your phone. You pan over to your messages. 

""Mom.""

Right as you tap the screen to respond, a new message comes through. It's from Reddit. A message request. An irksome curiosity forces your hand. You open the app. You find the interruption:

""Hey, I saw your post - it's amazing to see vulnerability like that! Glad you shared 😊""

You feel at ease, flattered by the positivity, the warmth - and all from a stranger! You respond:

""Thank you! I'm still trying to make sense of it all, but this has been such a relief!""

Before you can close the app again, the mystery messenger appears to be typing. Typing... typing... until at last:

""You're aren't REALLY going to quit though, are you?""

You start back from the screen slightly, confused.

""😈""

What was this? A troll most likely. You should have left it. Ignored the message. Closed the app. Responded to Mom. You didn't. You were angry. Angry that someone would poke and prod you after being so open, so vulnerable.

""I'm very serious about quitting. Stop messaging me.""

The messenger does not relent.

""Serious, hmm. We both know it won't last. You'll relapse. You love it.""

The messages cast your mind back to the apps you had vowed to quit. To the domme you had given up so much to. The parallels in their messages were agony. 

The messages continued. they taunted and jeered. They spoke of breaking you. Making you weak. Using you. Controlling you. Enslaving you - all for their financial gain. All in the name of accelerating your downfall.

You kept replying. Faintly combating the messages. You didn't understand why you felt the need to defend yourself against this vile person.

The exchange continued, the horrid person in your messages sent trigger after trigger. And then; a picture. A gorgeous women, in a suggestive pose. 

""Just send, idiot 🥱""

Clearly a model off the Internet, you thought. A Google image. You checked their Reddit profile. A panic crept over you. You feasted your eyes, helplessly. Triggering captions. Screenshots of sends; mountainous sends. The same woman again and again. Pose after pose. Caption after caption.

Then you felt it. That painfully familiar urge. It starts with a latent pulse. Then it grows into a throb. Then an ache. You felt your demeanour shift. The notion of quitting floating slowly away into darkness as you spoiled your eyes to Further images, further captions. You returned to their DMs to you-

""Hurry up!! SEND.""

________________________________________

There, you lay. Sheets sticking to your back. Eyes fixed onto the ceiling. Wallet discarded at the foot of your bed. Phone balancing on the edge of the mattress, tossed aside yet again. 

It's dark. The sun has set. Day come to an end. Your arms lay limp at your side. Your legs gently quake from the release. You cast your eyes down at yourself. You look upon the mess you've made, pooling tragically onto your stomach. You reach for a napkin and clean yourself up. Disgust haunts you in this moment.

As you glance back up at the ceiling, a sharp chill reminds you of your nakedness. The night time air, the breeze from your window. You drag yourself to your feet and approach the window. You pause- staring out into the street. All is quiet. Bathed in moonlight. You close your eyes, for a moment and breathe.

You close the window.

1mky43x,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ziogio998/comments/1mky43x/for_the_post_in_pragues_group/,For the post in Prague's group,"First things first, DO exclude real medical diagnosis. I do a full preventive exam every year (mostly blood, urine tests and an ECG or Holter), plus monitor my hear beat, blood pressure, avg activity levels etc with an Apple Watch at least a couple of months per year.

Once you exclude real diseases, it's time to address the elephant in the room:

* **Your mind is your real enemy, not your body**. Your body is a stupid piece of meat. The reason you feel like something horrible is going to happen is because your brain is creating that in your head. Your body is simply reacting to the stimulus as if something truly horrible IS happening, because that's what your brain communicated
* You probably get palpitation, sweat, disassociation, dizziness, and all other common symptoms of serious diseases or emergencies like a heart attack. That's what makes it feel so dangerous, especially because to everyone around you simply look... fine. Try to research online and understand that's simply how **adrenaline cycles work**. Your body is reacting to the panic induced by your mind, not a real danger, and doing nothing is exactly what you should do
* Granted you do the exams and talk to a physician, the chances of you actually being in danger anywhere in Prague are miniscule. **Prague has a VERY robust emergency network**. An ambulance, police, defibrillator, anything you might need is always very close to you, people are more than willing to help, and the infrastructure is readily available and mostly free to use if you have insurance. Even if you don't know anyone, if you were to actually pass out or something, I can almost promise you someone would help and call an ambulance
* **You cannot fully get rid of anxiety, but you CAN get rid of panic attacks.** The reason is back to point number one here. Panic is the result of endless spiraling, and it can only happen if you let your brain go to a point of no return. But if you study WHY you have the symptoms you have, you're almost surely not going to have another for mundane activities. I know what it feels like to get a panic attack simply shopping for milk, and you CAN get over it
* At the end, I end to decide if I wanted a **medical path or self-improvement path**. Look, I don't know how old you are, but the reality is that you can't really live being scared of the outside. It's normal to fear a new city and the move, but if this is going to be your home, **you can't fear Prague** or the outside. So, it's something you need to address. How you address it is up to you, but it's crucial to do something about it to improve your quality of life
* **You need to accept the goal here is not to ""fully"" heal**. You might never go back to who you were, if you didn't have these symptoms before. And that's totally fine. We grow, we change, we get older. It's completely normal to change. And just like losing a bit of eyesight, getting a burn, back pain, etc. don't destroy your life or define who you are, this can be just another one of those things. If you get over panic attacks and go out, then the fact you have anxiety from time to time isn't going to impact you as much. The goal is to live a normal life and tame anxiety, and the more you do it, the less frequently you're gonna have it

And for things that actually helped: 

* Having a partner helped tremendously, can't really lie about it. If you have no one near, consider maybe inviting a **friend** to stay with you from abroad for a bit
* I followed LOTS of courses online from psychologists about **how panic attacks actually work**, replicated the symptoms at home, and kinda demystified the reason why every symptom appeared. There are a few good ones on Udemy for like 13€
* **I chatted with ChatGPT every time I had anxiety**. Yes, it's controversial, but whatever I'm telling you what worked. If you ask right, ChatGPT is a perfect way to get through every symptom logically. Explain it what you feel, and you'll get a perfectly rational explanation of why it isn't dangerous
* **Get an emergency tool for your main triggers**. My #1 trigger is indoor heat and poor ventilation, making me feel like I can't breath, and gastric reflux. So, I always have a portable fan (neck fan, small AC plaque included) and Gaviscon with me. This way, I always know I have an ""escape"" even when I don't really have one (e.g. underground). It can be a big relief, and makes you feel in control
* **Exposure therapy**... there's no real other way around it. You either take anxiety medication, or you do exposure therapy. Anything else is temporary. I'd love to tell you there's a magic way out, but there isn't. It's painful, ugly, and it will continue to be for a while. But no one can do it for you. The psychologist can't hop on the tram for you. People online can't walk on the street for you. It's just you and your body. You need a way to make that synergy work. I personally decided I didn't want to be addicted to anti-anxiety meds from age 25, so I went with exposure therapy. And it DOES work. After you do the same thing dozens of times and see nothing real happens and that you're still breathing, eating, and sleeping just fine, you'll realize the worry was useless and your mind will slowly tune the alarm system down

And things I'd avoid:

* I used to have constant anxiety and panic attacks at work. I have a good job, well paid, and lots of responsibilities. It was significantly impacting my ability to work. I was willing to pay any reasonable amount to get out of it. **So I bought all sorts of bullshit**. EMS machines, anti-depression devices trialed in the UK, various breath work machines, apps, etc. Absolutely none of it improved my life one bit like going out for a walk and facing the fear. The only subscription that did help me was the AI subscription, because ChatGPT is genuinely so helpful in my life. But take it with a pinch of salt, I work in AI so I know how to use it very well & I'm biased. Buy a course on understanding panic attacks, or watch YouTube vids on it, and that's enough. If you have money to spend, spend it on real therapy, not gimmicks
* **Trying to ""explain"" it to others**. The reality is that you are completely fine. Everyone around you has the same symptoms as you, your mind is just overreacting to them. There's nothing weird about having palpitations, sweating, dizziness, etc. they're just symptoms. But, while most would simply eat a bit to solve dizziness, breath to solve palpitations, and cool themselves down with a drink for the sweat, you overreact and think you're dying. So, you can't ""explain"" it. From the outside, you will always look fine, because you are. When you try to explain something that makes you suffer, and others don't understand, it can make it worse. Instead, focus on the actual symptoms. If you feel hot, ask them to open a window. If you feel dizzy, ask for a pack of sugar. Those are things people CAN understand and WILL help with. You have no idea how many times I solved an anxiety attack because it was too hot by simply asking to open a window
* **Feeling like a failure**. I vividly remember many of the attacks I used to have. I'll give you an example that I think can help. I received a package from a friend. The post office took it instead, and my husband was working so he couldn't walk to take it with me. I had anticipatory anxiety going there for hours on end. When I eventually went to take it, my heart beat was literally 175 BPM or more (I tracked it with a watch). I could barely look straight, and was hyperventilating and restless. No one even noticed. It felt like forever, I took the pack, went back home, cried for an hour feeling like a failure. I remember telling my husband ""How the fuck am I able to move countries, work in a high-stress career, and then feel like I'm dying taking a goddamn package?"". Look, everyone fights their battles. What's hard for you is easy for others and viceversa. Focus on your struggle and self-improvement, not comparison. Last week, I had to go back to that post office and joked with the employee there, took a coffee, sit down to look at the ceiling, and my heart beat was completely fine - no palpitations or restlessness.

It's possible. You're not a failure if it's not today. Focus on making tomorrow better.",1,1754666549.0,u_ziogio998,0,1.0,False

I know lots of Mormons who are true believers and can still follow social etiquette and respect. When we excuse it we are allowing them to continue acting rudely and not helping them (especially young missionaries) understand social norms of behavior.
I worked with Mormons who could sit in a coffee shop with a juice and socialize without being judgy or refusing to meet. I had a boss who had to do a lot of networking and even had to plan events serving alcohol. If someone offered them a drink their answer was “yes, thank you, a Sprite would be nice .” He hated Mormons who would respond “No, I am a Mormon.” I’ve had missionaries who leave politely after I say I’m not interested. One of my college friends would hang out with us at night clubs and go dancing without making comments about drinking, clothing, etc. 

Mormons can be polite if they want to be. But if we accept their rude behavior we are allowing it to continue. We can polite and still call out bad behavior to help them interact with society at large.",6,1754666530.0,exmormon,3,0.88,False

## key Features Analysis

The allure of petrified wood tables lies in their inherent natural beauty and the captivating geological processes behind their formation. Several key features contribute to their value and appeal.**Authenticity and Geological Age:** Petrified wood is formed when organic wood material is gradually replaced by minerals, typically silica, over millions of years. The authenticity of the petrified wood is paramount. Tables should be accompanied by documentation or assurances verifying their geological origins and that they are genuine specimens. The age, often dating back to prehistoric eras, adds to their past and aesthetic importance.

**Size and Dimensions:** The size of a petrified wood table varies greatly depending on the original tree and the subsequent processing. Coffee tables typically range from 36 to 48 inches in diameter or length, while dining tables can span 60 inches or more. The thickness of the slice influences its visual presence and stability. Accurate measurements are crucial for determining if the table will fit appropriately within the intended space and serve its functional purpose.**Mineral Composition and Coloration:** The types of minerals that permeate the wood during petrification determine the table's color and pattern. Silica, iron oxides, manganese, and copper oxides are common elements that create a diverse palette of hues. Colors can range from earthy browns and reds to vibrant blues, greens, and yellows. The mineral composition not onyl affects the appearance but also the hardness and durability of the table.

**Polishing and Finishing:** Petrified wood tables undergo meticulous polishing to enhance their natural details and create a smooth surface. The finishing process involves applying sealants and coatings that protect the wood from moisture, stains, and scratches. The quality of the polishing and finishing significantly impacts the table's aesthetic appeal and longevity. A well-polished table highlights the intricate patterns and colors, while a durable finish preserves its beauty for years to come.

**Base and Support Structure:** The base of a petrified wood table is essential for providing stability and support. Common base materials include steel, iron, wood, or even complementary stone elements. Design considerations involve ensuring the base complements the tabletop's aesthetic while being structurally sound enough to bear the weight of the heavy stone. Artistic bases can enhance the table's overall visual impact, while simpler designs offer a more understated look.

I (25M) work in mortgage finance, pretty sweet gig, i love the team, love the work behind it, and truly from the bottom of my heart love to help people find their next home. Whether that is just a new home or their dream forever home it’s a great feeling when you can lend a hand.

These are the same people who are up in arms “oh rent is so bad, rent is skyrocketing, im tired of renting blah blah blah” I could’ve gotten you into a home with a fixed payment a month ago, yet you’re too chicken to speak with anyone. 
    These grown adults have no idea how to help themselves and at times, and i feel a little guilty, hope that you never find your dream home. Good luck renting till you die all to save you a few minutes to see what options benefit you. Homes don’t fall out of the sky
    Now I don’t know how much space I have left so I’ll try to be brief. You mean to tell me you cant get any documents in order? You haven’t done your taxes, you don’t know who to get paystubs? Wtf. You scheduled a call when you are available only to say you’re not?What?! Makes me wonder how these people go with their day to day. You say you are having financial trouble, yes this is very valid, but all of our services (near 200+) that help with Down Payment Assistance, Fixed rates and payment, budgetary payments, etc. But once i mention them you walk.  
    Would you walk out of a doctors office when the start offering treatments? I certainly wouldn’t

Anywho, I needed to get that off my chest. I don’t expect much people to read all that, if you did hey kudos have a good day.

Yes, mitragynine and 7-OH-mitragynine may produce some opioid-related effects, but the pharmacology is way more complex than that simple comparison.

Traditional opioids are like using a sledgehammer - they hit opioid receptors hard and with minimal selectivity. Kratom is more like a precision tool - it has partial agonist activity at mu-opioid receptors, but also interacts with adrenergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic systems.

This matters because:

1. The ceiling effect on respiratory depression is much lower
2. The euphoria is minimal compared to traditional opioids
3. The withdrawal profile is generally milder
4. The compulsive redosing behavior is much less common

Recent research shows most people use kratom ""to feel good generally, and not to get 'high'"". This distinction is huge and something traditional opioid users rarely report.

I'm not saying kratom is risk-free or non-addictive. But comparing it directly to fentanyl or oxycodone in terms of addiction potential is like comparing coffee to cocaine because they're both stimulants.

The research community is starting to recognize these differences, but regulatory discussions still treat them as equivalent. We need more nuanced conversations about kratom's unique risk-benefit profile.",1,1754666371.0,KratomVibes,0,1.0,False

1mky0ez,https://www.reddit.com/r/EvilLord/comments/1mky0ez/spoilers_for_vol_11_chapter_9/,Spoilers for Vol. 11 chapter 9,"\* We start with the Banfield fleet coming out of the long distant warp gate. Entering the Exner territory 

\*Liam is relived that there not being ambushed as soon as they emerge 

\*Adelbert mentions that if they had fought there the Exner territory would quickly be isolated within the empire

\*This is because of the long distant warp gate If it had been destroyed by either side it would cut them off

\*Liam goes on to tell Adelburt , about the situation as the enemy is going to throw a wedding, and he cant believe that they would do all this and then throw a wedding lol 

\*Liam tells him not to think about it as he's to smart to be worried about what dumbass have planned 

\*Liam goes on to command his fleet to, finish the mission quickly since the enemy has the advantage with numbers and they are lying in wait for any retaliation, so if they don't finish it quickly they will get withered down 

\*Liam explains to the fleet the mission objectives: Save princess Cecilia and the Exner Family and expose the truth.

\* The fleet then all as one begin their small distance warps to the Exner Home world 

The scene changes 

\*We move to the enemy's commanders fleet and his bridge 

\*The ships communicator announces the arrival of a fleet appearing.

\*They are all surprised and in shock that it the Banfield fleet, they weren't expecting them to really show up 

\*The commander is drinking coffee and is complaining about it lol, he tries to get his bridge under control as there are losing thee shit. he reminds them to ""Do as you were trained"" and he asks how many ships the Banfield fleet has

\*Its noted that the commander used to live in luxury in his own quatres, but he's exhausted having been dragged into this mission

\*The fleet he commands is a bitch ass Patrol fleet that was only trained for emergencies unlike the frontline fleet also they have third factory ships that only look good 

\*Cleo called on them and they really weren't expecting to fight 

\*The operator announces that the fleet is only 5000 ships, and it has no reinforcements in sight 

\*The commander is overjoyed that they only have 5000 ships, he believes if he beats the Banfield's it will be a huge achievement, and he would be able to demonstrate his fleets strength

\*His fleet only does train exercises and is looked down on  

\*The commander tells his fleet to enter a circler formation and prepare for the usual way of naval warfare. The usual way is that both sides square off and change formations in anticipation of the others fleet 

\*The commander is the only one with battle experience, and his adjutant praises him for his knowledge and how he got the bridge back under control 

\*BUT the crew begins to panic again as something isn't right   

\*The Banfield's are CHARGING!!!

\*The Commander is exhausted with his crew he believes since they only train that they lose there composure quickly, he tells his crew that its just a bluff and that there trying to intimidate them so they will just spread the formation and surround the Banfield's fleet.

\*The commander is upset with his crew thinking they need more training 

\*EXCEPT THE BANFIELDS ARE STILL CHARGING!! 

\*The crew loses their shit as the Lieutenant does some research and finds out that the Banfield's fighting style is to blitz the enemy 

\*The commander just cant understand the reason why they fight that way and that it had to be a bluff

\*The battle begins as they enter firing range 

The scene changes to Liam on his ship 

\*Liam is enjoying the sight of the enemy fleet scurrying around the battlefield, and comments on how its useless to have a fleet that only trains

\*The Banfield fleet is tearing through the enemy fleet  

 \*Ethel is impressed with the Vanguard leading the charge and asks who they are

\*Adelburt answers before Liam can and says it the public order fleet called (Jaeger)  

\*Adelburt was going to continue, but Ethel was pissed that he stepped on her moment with Liam and he breaks out in a cold sweat as she stares at him with the upmost bloodlust in her eyes 

\*Liam is enjoying them fight, but its war time not play time  so he barks some orders and Adelburt salutes Liam and runs away trying to avoid Ethels glare lol

The scene changes 

\*We move to the Exner home world where Billy is surprised to hear the news that Liam had shown up 

\*The sword demon is with Billy and is pacing back in forth in fear and excitement

\*Billy tries to calm him by telling him its only 5000 ships and not to worry so much

\*The sword demon reminds him that this is what they do they always turn the tides on larger numbers( He's starting to freak out)

\*Billy tries to comfort him again by telling them that even if they to make it to the planet, they would basically be trapped since they control the plantery defenses  

\*Billy is sure of things and is sure that Cecelia wont betray them aswell 

\*Then a soldier rushes into the room and exclaims that the people have risen up against them and are aiming to free the Exners

\*Billy surmises that it had to be the knights and soldiers of the Exners that were lying in wait for a moment

\*Billy authorizes the soldiers to put down the rebellion and kill a few to make a statement  

\*The sword demon berates him for not doing his job better as if he did this wouldn't have happened

\*Billy then acknowledges that he's been preoccupied with his side job the production of the sex change plants 

\*Billy has his own plans and contract wil Cleo as when this is over he was going to make a fortune selling them and he would return to the underworld 



this was a good little chapter not much happens besides Liam coming and clapping the fleet with no problems lol

Apple will expand U.S. production with a fresh $100B investment, bringing its four-year domestic commitment to $600B. Projects include high-end product assembly, AI labs, and semiconductor work. The move may ease White House criticism of Apple’s reliance on India and China for iPhone production.

Global airfreight volumes grew 5% YoY as shippers sought to beat new U.S. tariffs. Capacity was up just 3%, lifting average load factors to 58%. Spot rates fell 2% YoY but rose slightly from June. Analysts expect short-term demand to stay firm until tariffs fully bite.

1mkxtod,https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningTrainingShoes/comments/1mkxtod/does_the_feethit_ht02p_walking_shoe_review_prove/,Does the Feethit HT-02-P Walking Shoe Review Prove Its Comfort and Durability?,"The product Feethit HT-02-P Mens Slip On Walking Shoes immediately caught my attention with its sleek and modern design. As someone who juggles between outdoor activities and casual outings, I was curious to see how this footwear would hold up to daily use. With a rating of 4.3, there were some expectations to meet. I decided to take these shoes for a spin, testing both their performance and comfort.

**Lightweight and Breathable Design**  
The mesh outer material really stands out when you first lay eyes on these shoes. This breathable fabric not only enhances the aesthetics but also ensures ample ventilation. After a couple of brisk morning walks and an hour-long tennis match, I was pleased to note my feet stayed fairly dry—a true blessing for anyone who tends to sweat during physical activity. They feel incredibly lightweight too, making them perfect for extended use without feeling like you’re dragging your feet.

**Comfort Without Compromise**  
Comfort was one area that these shoes delivered in spades. The memory foam insole feels like you're walking on small cushions. Whether darting around the office or heading out for a coffee run, my feet felt supported. I lent them to my father, whose daily job requires being on his feet for hours, and he raved about how soft and supportive they felt, yet not overly tight.

[Want to see Feethit HT-02-P deals on Amazon now?](https://crosner.com/p/b07zyvcp4g/)

**Grip and Stability in Action**  
Wearing these on wet pavements after a light rain gave me a proper sense of the traction they offer. The rubber outsole paired with the groove design ensures you’re not sliding across slippery surfaces. Whether at a park, on uneven ground, or hurrying across tiled floors, these shoes gripped firmly, making them a reliable choice in varying conditions.

**Advantages**  
- Lightweight and breathable mesh material.  
- Comfortable memory foam insole for added support.  
- Rubber patch increases slip resistance effectively.  

**Flaws**  
- The pull-on closure can be tricky for those with broader feet.  
- Limited customization options in terms of width for individuals with unique sizing needs.  

**Style Meets Versatility**  
One of the aspects I personally enjoyed is how versatile the design is. These sneakers are functional for both sports and casual wear. I’ve worn them to a weekend lunch and in gym sessions. The minimalist profile blends seamlessly with any ensemble. A co-worker even asked me where I picked them up during a casual Friday office outing. However, if you prefer sneakers that scream ""statement piece,"" these may seem a little understated.

**Product Alternatives**  
The competition in the world of men’s athletic sneakers is undoubtedly fierce. Comparing this pair to big names like Nike Revolution’s walking shoes or Adidas Cloudfoam sneakers, there are a few distinct differences. While Nike and Adidas offer more advanced cushioning technology, the Feethit HT-02-P excels with its beginner-friendly price point and simplicity. However, its competitors might hold the edge in terms of high-tech features, such as built-in arch support or better custom fit options.

**Quality for Price**  
Considering the features offered, the Feethit HT-02-P shoes provide commendable value. From robust materials to all-day comfort, you’re unlikely to feel you’re overpaying for what you’re getting. For anyone who needs reliable, casual sneakers that easily double as performance shoes, they hit the sweet spot. Are there flashier alternatives? Sure! But those come with a heftier price tag. For practical shoppers like me, these seem worth every cent.

1mkxthu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1mkxthu/aita_for_working_in_the_morning_instead_of/,AITA for working in the morning instead of helping with the baby,"Our nighttime routine has been very 50/50 with me feeding the baby a bottle while my wife pumps. Sometimes the times don't align when baby wakes vs when mama wakes. This morning my wife got up at 4 am to pump, I got up at 5 am when the baby woke from sleep and fed the baby. When the baby was back in his crib, I found that my wife was still awake. We both tried to fall asleep but only got about 30 minutes each before it was time to get up for the day. She is on Mat leave, I am not on pat leave, but I work from home which allows me to help out whenever I can which has been a huge blessing. But this also puts a large amount a stress over my head as I try to balance a new job that requires me to learn a new skill, and learning how to be a new parent and trying to help my wife WHENEVER I can.

So when my wife was in tears this morning over exhaustion, I told her I would take care of everything until she woke up and go back to sleep. I had to practically beg her to go back to sleep because she just wouldn't do it, coming up with every reason in the book to get up. Finally I got her to agree but I think all those reasons still floated in her head and she couldn't sleep so after an hour she woke up. 

Then it was time to feed the baby so she nursed him at nine and put him down for a nap around 10.30 while I ""went to work"". When she came to my office for the monitor, I told her I would watch and soothe when he wakes and told her to go and sit and have coffee. She immediately started crying and asking why I didn't come and take him from her after nursing so she could have breakfast and coffee. And she said that when I grabbed a snack she thought I was going to come and take him after, but I was working so I went back to my office. I really was working too, and I told her that, but she posits that If I were willing to play hookie from work for an hour or two while she slept I should have thought to come and take over the baby too. And yeah, I see her point for sure and I'm sitting here wishing I did. But I was also working, trying to balance the two priorities and keep things afloat. 

I apologized and said I should have thought about it but I'm still definitely in the doghouse on this one and I'm left feeling a little short changed. While I was attmepting to do a few nice and helpful things around my work schedule, I didn't think about the thing she was thinking I should do. I had conflicting priorities and I should have checked in, but if she was sitting there expecting something we hadn't communicated about, aren't we both at fault for the lack of communication? At the end of the day I get that the mom is always right in these instances but I felt a little damned if I do damned if I don't when I'm working on a deadline on a project and she was awake so I figured I could rush to prioritize that.

  
Edit: I've gotten a lot of comments about my use of the word ""Help"". To clarify, I only use this because I am technically at work, therefor if I step away I am helping during her time with the baby. If in the afternoons, evening feeds, bathtime etc. (all things that have become my responsibility) she were to step in, I would say she's helping me. There's no conflict here, we help one another and theres no primary parent. She agrees with this mindset.",36,1754665870.0,AmItheAsshole,77,0.79,False

I distinctly remember how boring it was as a kid to listen to my parents (and they spoke little about their feelings, being of the Silent Generation) say “in my day…”  Well I had it this morning and couldn’t believe the words crossed my brain. 

I had the opportunity to have a quick coffee date with someone I’d been talking to for a few days because my new motto is meet as quickly as possible. I am off the apps but we’d already switched to texting back and forth which for some reason lately I can’t stand. I want to have an organic flowing conversation, not just put forth a few sentences and then wait to see how he responds. Unless it’s a purely silly exchange by text like sharing memes and gifs over a fun topic, I find trying to get to know someone over text now supremely boring. 

I digress… the meetup was okay, I’m neither blown away nor put off but he’s interesting to talk to, until we are leaving and I still have some coffee left and the remainder of my little treat. Basically my hands are full as I approach the door but I’m trying to move things around so I can grab the handle and push out. My date, empty-handed, stands behind me and waits. He doesn’t offer to get the door. He doesn’t move around me and hold it open. Hell, even a guy on his way into the coffee shop doesn’t get the door. Two guys watching a woman try to figure out how to push the door open with her hip because it’s a heavy door. And I’m no bruiser, so no it didn’t look like I could easily muscle my way through compared to them. 

It wasn’t until I’d pushed the door open with pure glute strength, that the man outside grabbed it and he didn’t even open it much for me. He held it open just enough for himself so I just really kind almost stumbled out the door since I was coming out sideways with my arms akimbo. All this to say, I immediately ranted internally “in my day, my date would’ve reached for the door to hold it open for me.” I even remembered back in the day a man said “allow me.” It seems cheesy nowadays but I almost shed a tear then and there, knowing those days are truly gone. Although my date told me he wants to see me again, I will not be and I’m sure he will have no idea truly why but I’m certainly not going to say “you didn’t hold the door open for me.” It feels silly to say but that’s how I truly felt. My teen son has even teased me “but you’re a strong independent woman, you got this, right?” That’s not the point, young padawan. How has it come to this? 

I’m sure some would say I’m being too picky but I’m not judging modern men by some crazy standard, am I? I’m only 52 and I guess I’m ready for the walking stick to shake at whippersnappers. I mean, I see people struggling with a door, man, woman, child, I’m holding it open for them. I’m not asking for a man to lay his jacket on a puddle for me so I can cross the street, but since I saw two mature men, not boys, just stare at me fumbling instead of taking charge of the situation (if not for me, then themselves!!), I feel very nostalgic and sad. I know I keep hearing, these men are out there, but I’m literally not seeing them in just day to day life. I told myself that this is not a big deal, these specific men were somewhat rude or clueless and leave it at that, but I feel increasingly hopeless, just finding someone *kind*!

## Key Features Analysis

The current market offers a wide variety of drink bottles with tea infusers, each boasting diffrent qualities and specifications. Evaluating these features is essential to find the best fit for your individual needs and lifestyle.

**Material Quality:**

The material of the bottle is a crucial consideration. Most high-quality tea infuser bottles are made from borosilicate glass or stainless steel. Borosilicate glass is known for its durability and resistance to thermal shock, meaning it can handle both hot and cold liquids without cracking. Stainless steel, particularly food-grade stainless steel, is another excellent option, known for its durability, lack of chemical leaching, and ability to maintain temperature for extended periods. Cheaper alternatives may use plastic, which can possibly leach chemicals into your tea and is generally less durable.

**Infuser Design and Functionality:**

The design of the tea infuser itself is just as critically important as the bottle's material. Look for infusers with fine mesh or perforations to prevent tea leaves from escaping into your drink.The infuser should be easy to remove and clean, ideally dishwasher safe.Some infusers are full-length, allowing for better flavor extraction, while others are smaller baskets designed for steeping loose leaf tea in smaller quantities. Consider an infuser design that accommodates different types of tea leaves, from large leaves like oolong to smaller particles like rooibos.

**Capacity and Portability:**

Drink bottles with tea infusers come in various sizes, ranging from small, compact bottles suitable for short trips to larger bottles that can hold enough tea for an entire day. Choose a capacity that aligns with your daily hydration needs and the length of time you usually spend away from a refill source. Consider the bottle's dimensions and weight when full,particularly if you plan on carrying it in a bag or backpack. Look for bottles with ergonomic designs that are pleasant to hold and carry.

**Leak-Proof Design:**

A leaky drink bottle can quickly turn a pleasant tea-drinking experience into a frustrating mess. Ensure the bottle has a reliable,leak-proof seal,particularly around the lid and infuser. Consider models with silicone gaskets or O-rings that provide a tight, secure closure. Read reviews to see if users report any issues with leaking. A well-designed lid should be easy to open and close, even with one hand.

**Insulation:**

For those who prefer their tea hot or cold for extended periods, insulation is an critically important feature. Double-walled insulated bottles can maintain the temperature of your tea for several hours. Vacuum insulation is the most effective, creating a thermal barrier that minimizes heat transfer. Consider whether you primarily drink hot tea, iced tea, or both, as insulation needs may vary.

key features of high-quality drink bottles with tea infusers include:

* Durable materials like borosilicate glass or stainless steel
* Well-designed and easy-to-clean infuser
* Suitable capacity and portability
* Leak-proof construction
* Insulation for temperature retention

## Core Benefits

Drink bottles with tea infusers offer a range of benefits that go beyond simply carrying your favorite beverage. They enhance the tea-drinking experience, promote a healthier lifestyle, and reduce environmental waste.

**Freshly Brewed Tea on the Go:**

One of the most significant benefits is the ability to brew fresh tea wherever you are. No longer are you limited to pre-made bottled tea, bland office coffee, or sugary drinks. You can enjoy the nuances of your favorite loose leaf tea, controlling the steeping time and strength to perfectly match your preferences. Imagine brewing a calming chamomile tea on a stressful commute or a refreshing green tea during a midday workout.

**Health and Wellness:**

Brewing your own tea allows you to control the ingredients and avoid added sugars, artificial sweeteners, and preservatives found in many commercially available beverages.Tea is packed with antioxidants and other beneficial compounds that can boost your immune system, improve digestion, and promote overall wellness.Bringing a drink bottle with a tea infuser encourages you to drink more water and stay hydrated throughout the day, supporting optimal health.

**Environmental Sustainability:**

By using a reusable drink bottle with a tea infuser, you reduce your reliance on single-use plastic bottles and disposable teabags. Plastic bottles contribute to environmental pollution, and many teabags contain plastic polymers that are not biodegradable. Choosing a reusable bottle helps minimize waste and supports a more enduring lifestyle.**Cost Savings:**

While the initial investment in a high-quality tea infuser bottle may be higher than buying disposable bottles of tea or relying on coffee shop beverages, it can lead to significant cost savings in the long run.By brewing your own tea from loose leaf, you avoid the ongoing expense of purchasing individual drinks. Over time, the savings can be considerable, making a reusable bottle a financially sound choice.

## faqs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about drink bottles with tea infusers.

**What types of tea can I use in a tea infuser bottle?**

You can use a wide variety of loose leaf teas,including black tea,green tea,white tea,oolong tea,herbal tea,and fruit infusions. Experiment with different types of tea and steeping times to find your perfect blend. Avoid using powdered teas or very fine tea dust, as they may clog the infuser.

**How do I clean my tea infuser bottle?**

Most tea infuser bottles can be cleaned with warm soapy water. Use a bottle brush to reach the bottom and scrub any stubborn stains. The infuser should be thoroughly rinsed to remove any tea residue. Check the manufacturer's instructions to see if the bottle and infuser are dishwasher safe. Regular cleaning is essential to prevent the build-up of bacteria and mold.

**Are tea infuser bottles suitable for hot and cold beverages?**

Many tea infuser bottles, especially those made from borosilicate glass or stainless steel, are suitable for both hot and cold beverages. However, it is essential to check the manufacturer's specifications to ensure the bottle is designed to withstand temperature fluctuations. Insulated bottles are particularly well-suited for maintaining the temperature of both hot and cold drinks for extended periods.

*Throne's Fortune Escort Ship* Svitre's Vengeance

Commodore Dolin sat in his command chair calmly, watching the holos they'd managed to scrape together from Hurdop. It was difficult to not be angry as he watched a second-hand and re-cut feed of 'The Victories of Gunner's Mate Kiole's Husband, Freelord Gryzzk'.

They'd fallen so far, so fast. Not a year ago they were lauded as sword, shield, and hunters for Hurdop. His brethren of the Throne's Fortune had kidnapped the heir to the Vilantian Throne, and the worlds of the sector were going to learn to show their bellies. Now they were being seen as a relic, something to be honored but not followed. All of this because of the Terrans.

After the Shaming of Vilantia, the Terrans had moved into both systems with a purpose that would have been beautiful if it hadn't been aimed at the destruction of his life-work. For the first time, the Freelords of Hurdop had met and collectively decided to divide systems among themselves to play both ends of the field as both helpful saviors and wanton pirates. It was a good trail to walk, and Freeclan Svitre had gotten fat and happy on their labors.

Too fat, as it turned out. It rankled to think how two ships - respectably armed, but still only two - had moved like a keen blade through their defense and turned what was supposed to be a battle hardened group of fearless warriors into scampering pups. Still, there was a lesson in that defeat for those with the courage to sift the ashes.

He went over the ship's sensor logs as well as requesting logs from other ships, and finally finding a Widegrid site that held recordings of a Terran mercenary commentary show in both subtitled and dubbed versions. The commentary were varied, and one of the more common debates that he saw was whether the subtitled versions or the dubbed versions were superior, with the debates all agreeing that with no scent track something was distinctly lost. Finally they found one that actually included scent-markings, and was thoroughly displeased to see that it was a dissection of their engagement. But sill he watched it.

And watched again. Over and over for half a day until he could almost say the commentary before the figures on the holo did. But from that, he and Smeitr began to plan. They didn't know precisely when the bastard Freelord was going to arrive, but as they followed various Gridspace entries, it seemed soon. Freelord Gryzzk had fought yet another engagement with his own planet and come out a clear winner, giving him even more laurels and an entire Vilantian Greatclan at his beck and call. This prompted a call to the other Commodore, hidden halfway across the system.

""So he has a Greatclan, as well as his Freeclan. What of it?"" Smeitr had always been a doer, not a thinker. Dolin inhaled and exhaled once to calm himself before responding.

""It means that if we could board and take him hostage, we could...convince him to relay our wishes to his new clan.""

There was a moment of thought. ""We may not even need to take him, taking his wife or child would suffice to make him barter and see the wisdom of our words.""

Dolin shook his head. ""Freelord Svitre thought as you did. Shall we ask for his opinion?""

There was a grunt of memory. ""Perhaps another route then.""

""Overwhelm and declaw his ship. Board it and take it as ours; from there we separate the crew among our ships. Keep them divided. Eventually with the promise of being reunited, we'll be able to find a way to turn his newly found gains to our advantage.""

Smeitr seemed pleased by the idea. ""You seem to have thought of everything.""

""Not quite. The test comes from when his ship emerges from R-space. I've been watching analyses of his actions, as well as taking in things that were seen as laudable by us in our previous engagement..."" Dolin began explaining his plan.

*Terran Foreign Legion Ship* Twilight Rose

Gryzzk glanced at the entirety of the bridge squad before speaking. ""We'll be exiting R-space during the early morning. You'll be on duty during that time, and we expect an ambush as soon as we exit. That said, we've got a plan in the vat based on we think they're going to do - but I need to know right now if any of you are uncomfortable with the idea of flying into an immediate combat scenario."" He looked around and up, holding his gaze on Miroka for a long moment.

Laroy spoke first. ""Well, hope they made their peace then. Ser'en' Major showing me a thing or two, so if it's time, it's time.""

""I will fly well."" Miroka stood rigid, her scent one of readiness.

Reilly smirked. ""If we get their comm frequencies, I got something for 'em.""

Larion looked around for a moment before speaking. ""I was raised to fight the Hurdop. Now I am. It would be ungrateful for me to not accept this.""

There was a nod. ""Very well. Captain Hoban, dismissed - brief the shuttle pilots on their part, confirm their loadouts, then make sure they are rested.""

Hoban flipped a little salute as he exited, leaving Gryzzk to look at the rest of the squad. ""Now then, for everyone else. Based on what we know, I believe the Hurdop ships will be doing a tight patrol of the area. Once we exit to normal-space, Larion will confirm hostile ship location. After that the shuttles will launch for intercept, carrying printed volcanic ash that will ejected once they're inside the shield radius of the enemy ships. Theoretically this will disrupt sensors and theoretically cause damage to weapon blisters, after which they'll retreat to a safe distance. Reilly, flood their comm frequencies. XO, attempt to gain access to their systems and once successful...talk to them.""

""During that time, Laroy will fire disabling torpedoes at widest possible spread - we want to disable their weapons. Corporal Larion, you will have to entirety of the torpedo runtime to locate and mark all hostiles. Corporal Miroka, once we have positions, plot an immediate escape course and exit toward Hurdop V.""

Miroka cocked her head. ""Our destination is Hurdop Prime.""

""Indeed it is, and they know that. They may even set a trap for us, offering a route to Hurdop Prime. Make for Hurdop V, confuse them. They will hesitate, and then we'll be able to assess from a strategic location.""

Gryzzk paused to look at the entire squad. ""Now the normal dayshift will be in the conference room - they'll be backup in the event of injury, and only in the event of injury. I suggest you familiarize yourselves with your station harnesses. For the next few hours, we'll be running through some simulations courtesy of the XO. Fair warning, Rosie has been in a mood since Corporal Kiole sat on my tablet earlier today.""

Rosie pouted from her spot outside the conference room. ""She didn't *have* to sit on your tablet.""

""Why don't we save that conversation for a moment when we're not planning an engagement."" Gryzzk paused. ""I can't say that I have the best squad in front of me that's ever been in existence. I can say that this is the best squad I've had the pleasure of commanding. And that I would like to continue that command for as long as possible. Take the hours to consider every possible bad thing that can happen, and then find the best way to counteract it with the tools at your disposal. To your stations.""

As they settled, Reilly cleared her throat. ""And just remember, we're not doing this for money. We're doing it for *shit-ton* of money.""

The next few hours were tense. Rosie threw scenario after scenario as they drilled for possible outcomes. For the most part, they came out well, with corrections made after the fact.

After a few hours, Gryzzk called a halt and break. He was admittedly a bit tired but he knew that the upcoming events would keep him from rest. Instead he went to his quarters, put his face above the planter, and simply breathed. The mix of scents was intoxicating on a level - Vilantia with it's familiar call of home, Hurdop as familiar and alien as possible. Then Terra, a confusing mixture but deep with possibility, and finally Moncilat, which smelled rich but delicate at the same time. He let the cloying scents sift through his nose and closed his eyes for a moment.

""Freelord Major, we are fifteen minutes out from Hurdop.""

Gryzzk blinked at his tablet and looked over at the door. Rosie was standing in the doorway, garbed in combat armor and waiting for him to acknowledge. Next to him someone had placed a cup of tea that was still steaming warmth. His took a sip, stood and stretched, feeling a few slight cramps in his legs.

""Thank you XO. Boarding parties?""

""Loose as a goose and twice as mad. 'Bout a third of them were planning on taking the skin-boat to tuna town before we made Hurdop, and this little meeting from the Throne's Fortune threw those plans to hell. Everyone else is at condition yellow, armed and in their quarters waiting to go.""

""I would feel for them if they weren't planning to attack us."" Gryzzk made his way to the bridge and walked the numbness out of his legs as he donned his combat armor. This also gave him a chance to look and scent everyone. Overall, there was tension, but it was measured. Overall there seemed to be a grim resolve present both on the bridge and the conference room, where the day shift had chosen to take a little nap themselves before helping themselves to dark, viscous print-coffee.

Gryzzk's tea was empty, so he set the cup in the holder calmly before slotting his tablet into place and prepared as rapidly as possible for what might happen.

R-space fled and immediately there were proximity alerts flashing red as Miroka coolly made the ship pirouette through the not-as-empty as he would like.

Larion reported in first. ""Freelord, I count eight ships total."" He paused. ""There should be twelve. They're breaking patrol orbits, weapons charged.""

Reilly reported next. ""R-space buoy launched. Locking to comm frequencies and backfeeding. Shuttles report clean launch, intercept in forty seconds. Inbound transmission just keeps repeating 'The Clanwar continues.' I don't think they want to parley, Major.""

""They firing, plasma only. Torps away, Maj'r."" Laroy's fingers drummed at the control panel as he kept the gun turrets moving to prepare to fire.

The ship was slightly buffeted as Miroka dodged fire elegantly, causing the incoming plasma to skip off their shields or absorb it's energy into the ship systems, causing Rosie to jitter slightly and move about with a touch more energy. The torpedoes detonated on cue, bubbles of disruptive energy that caused the plasma turrets aimed at them to fall to silence. They were fifteen seconds in, and nothing had gone wrong. This was quite possibly a record. Gryzzk was considering what to make of his good fortune

Then fortune changed dramatically. Larion's scent went surprised for a moment as he reported. ""Major multiple r-space exit signatures, single point."" He shifted the sensor view to point at the area, and four ships all appeared from R-space to immediately collide each other. While R-space wasn't exactly a dimensional shift, the transitional moments were something of an exercise in physics where lots of things could go very wrong very quickly if one was not cautious.

Things went wrong for the incoming ships in short order as four contained singularities became uncontained catastrophes of astrophysics. Miroka didn't hesitate, turning the ship with the engines toward the explosion and letting the explosion propel them forward before the shockwave passed over them. Not all the other ships were so lucky, with two spiraling wildly as they vented smoke and atmosphere into space. The shuttles were buffeted about, tumbling wildly for several seconds before they each recovered, finding their targets and then beginning some rather unorthodox maneuvers as they darted in to release billowing clouds that damaged sensors and jammed weapon mobility platforms. The enemy turrets recovered from their brief torpedo-induced seizure and began firing anew.

Laroy grumbled slightly, pausing his firing sequence as the ship swiveled under Miroka's command like a ballerina going from plié to relever to fifth position in a space of moments. ""Got-dammit *Petitchat*!""

""The choice was to lose lock or lose the weapon cluster, Mister Laroy."" Miroka didn't look over, keeping her eyes on her console.

""Fiiiine.""

During this, Reilly and Rosie were wrecking havoc on the comm feed, with Rosie doing most of the talking. ""Hole-ey fuck, what kinda bass-ackwarks fucking pageantry is happening here - I thought we were up against a fuckin' team and the fuckin' '74 Caps show up? Hang on, we'll eject a garbage can so's you can skate it like it's the Cup on your way home. Fuck, you want a square go there's a Mighty Mites team out of Neo-Toronto that you titfuckers'd be an even match for. Hang on, call coming in."" Rosie paused with an expression that suggested she'd been waiting for this one. ""Hey it was your mom calling from my bed asking me what's taking so long with the warm towel and a blow-dryer, I had to tell her I'd be a minute cause I needed a magnifying glass and tweezers to help her bouncing baby boy find his favorite toy.""

The taunting seemed to drive the remaining attackers to utter madness, with the results being predictable to everyone - Gryzzk noticed one ship staying to the edges and being...well-managed. Scans noted it as the *Svitre's Vengeance*, which set it apart - the ship seemed to be the flagship of this remnant fleet which was being quickly set to floating scrap under the exceptional fire from Laroy.

""Redirect. Corporal Laroy, take a few shots at the *Svitre's Vengeance* \- Rosie, keep the other ships busy for a few moments. Miroka, plot a course to maximize our coverage from that ship."" Gryzzk lowered his voice slightly, forcing calm. ""They've only thrown a few shots at us. Let's see if we can tease them from their perch.""

Her reply was soft and confident. ""I am a leaf on the wind. Watch how I soar..."" Miroka moved the ship in a twisting spiral arc, hiding behind a dead hulk and showing just enough of the weapons for Laroy to sail a short burst of fire at the marked ship as the other ships were de-engined and forced to eject their singularities, causing more waves of damage than Gryzzk would have liked. for it's part, the *Svitre's Vengeance* took damage, but not a great deal - it seemed as if had defensive augmentations that the other ships didn't.

The response to the incoming fire was both expected and surprising, as the *Svitre's Vengeance* leaped forward like a spurred horse, finally pitching itself forward and rotating along it's spine to slam it's forward portside hard into the *Twilight Rose*, causing Rosie to emit a cry of pain as the ship was damaged by both the *Svitre's Vengeance* and the poor ship they'd been using as cover. The entire bridge squad was thrown against their harnesses, with Miroka screaming in pain for a moment before she went silent as her head collided with the control panel. Hoban launched himself from the conference room, taking only a moment to check on Miroka before assuming her position. He did however keep a foot on her chest as it rose and fell.

""Aft portside airlock being force-breached.""

Laroy swiveled the forward gun emplacements and began a relentless assault on the enemy ship engines, causing the other ship's power to go to emergency before he stopped. ""I pop 'em again and the singularity might go and that's a party nobody wants an invite to Maj'r.""

Even as Laroy was talking, Gryzzk was nodding and tapping his tablet.

""Aft boarding parties, prepare to defend and assault. Forward boarding party move to midships for support. Clanwar rules of engagement are in effect."" There was a chance that this insanity was a diversion and another boarding party might attempt entry at the forward airlock. At least that's what Gryzzk thought he would do in a reversed position.

The attempt to board was enough to make Gryzzk's heart beat fast enough that for a moment he couldn't think clearly. The attackers surged forward for a bare instant before fire extinguishers and shotguns were put to use along with energy pistols to make the pirates realize the extreme error of their ways. Then the boarding party surged forward from the *Twilight Rose* to the *Svitre's Vengeance* with a collective howl of anger. Gryzzk could only watch and watch more as the squads from the armory in security sections boiled into the pirate ship, taking lives effectively and efficiently as they moved through the ship like a cloud of death and dismay. The conversations were quick, the shots effective. In a span of minutes it was over, and the other ship secured.

As soon as the officers had confirmed the area initially secure, Gryzzk and O'Brien carried Miroka's unconscious form to the medbay as the medical teams moved out to attend the wounded and begin triage, helping everyone back and taking a few back on stretchers. The cleanup from the battle took almost as long as the battle itself. After tending to Miroka, Gryzzk went aft to take a look at the damage. Overall, it didn't seem too bad until he got to the airlock and then came the part he was almost looking forward to.

""Tuckers Trashheap and Taxidermy - we'll stuff it somewhere, Chief Packer talking *what?*""

""Chief, I require a time estimate for repairs.""

""Sometime between now and the heat death of the universe. We got structural damage across most of the aft spaces, airlock's gonna need a couple hours to uncouple. Figure three before we're moving again. Take a nap already.""

""Understood chief. Advise when something goes wrong and the estimate becomes three hours. Gryzzk out.""

Rosie was using a cane as she moved toward Gryzzk. ""Freelord, Delia insists that she be allowed access to inspect the other ship. She has invoked the proper clauses, and indicates that the safety of the ship clause does not apply, as she wishes to inspect another ship and not this one.""

Gryzzk exhaled softly as he weighed the options. ""Very well. We'll allow it however for her own safety she gets into a set of armor before leaving the ship.""

Reilly stood and grabbed her pistol and shotgun from the side of her console. She shrugged at Gryzzk's questioning look. ""She's gonna want me to be her bodyguard; might as well get this shit over with.""

Gryzzk nodded, and Reilly left. ""Corporal Larion, make sure there's no life signs on the other ship. And get a constant feed from Reilly's helmet.""

""None that I can detect, but there is a great deal of interference and several dead zones in the ship. Reilly's feed is live.""

They watched the holo feed as Reilly approached Delia calmly, with Delia seeming far too excited. Somehow this was...pleasant for her.

""Oh, I'd hoped your Major Gryzzk would agree to this. He's seems quite reasonable really. I've always wanted to know how the socially common elements express themselves.""

There was an exhale as the younger Reilly spoke in chopped sentences. ""Delia, I hate to burst your bubble but - scratch that I *love* to burst your bubble. Anyway, the closest thing thing to art that we're probably gonna find on this heap is Hurdop-on-Vilantian porn. And not the good stuff either, more like the ones that make you wonder if this was a job or mental sickness. Now when something goes to shit you do exactly what I tell you to do when I tell you to do it. I tell you to run, you fuckin' run. Stay behind me.""

Delia's reply was cheerful. ""Oh, I'm sure I'll find something worthy.""

The walk-through was mostly quiet, with Delia looking all around in a dizzying fashion and somehow missing the results of recent combat while her daughter kept her head moving in a careful sweep pattern. The elder Reilly kept a running commentary.

""Well, I see some things...the graffiti suggests deep anger. Isn't that the Major's family...oh."" Delia's helmet stayed fixed on a bit of bone surrounded by other fluids and brain.

""That's a still life sculpture in a biomass medium. The working title's probably something like *That's When I Knew I Fucked Up*.""

""How can you...how? This is not how..."" Delia was stammering a bit at the reality in front of her.

Reilly's voice was soft. ""Not everyone plays by your rules. These guys are part of a group that wants everyone in the Majors clan dead - me included. No negotiation, no dealing. Either we kill them all, or they kill us all.""

""That's hardly civilized.""

""It's very civilized when you consider the alternative.""

""I don't see ho-*hrgh!*"" Whatever Delia was going to say was cut off as a body exploded from a pile of debris; Reilly swiveled, exchanging shotgun for pistol as the situation clarified itself. Delia was on her knees and gasping, being held by the throat with her armor hanging slightly off her body. Behind her was a Hurdop with a pistol at Delia's head. His eyes were wild and unfixed, but his clothing and jeweled adornments suggested he was one of the higher-ups of the ship's company.

Delia's captor snarled. ""Get off my ship before she dies. As soon as I have control again the war will continue.""

Reilly's response was devoid of emotion as she backed off a pace and took a knee. ""Listen twilight-fucker, there's three ways this goes down. Option one - you catch a sudden case of I-Wanna-Live-itis. You drop the gun, your ass goes in the stockade and you get tossed at the authorities when we hit Prime. Option two. You shoot her, I shoot you, and I'm pretty sure the gods take her to y'alls afterlife so you can spend eternity getting bitched at by a professional beee-yotch."" Reilly's vitals had gone up a touch, but not dangerously so. By contrast, Delia's vitals indicated extreme panic at the situation, with her heart rate and respiration spiking wildly into level that were far outside the normal range - though considering the current situation, outside normal was in fact normal.

There was movement behind Delia as Reilly continued talking. ""Option three, you stand there with your thumb up your ass and try to figure your way out of this until I get bored and decide it's time to play an exciting game called Shoot the Hostage. At that point, I shoot her under the collarbone and put a round in your throat. She lives and spends the next week in the medbay, you die. Oh, and just so you know – I get bored very easily. For me, the last two options are what I like to call a win-win."" Reilly paused, shifting slightly to keep the Hurdop's attention on her. ""Or is it win win win? Like you shoot her and I shoot you, that's a double win because whatever bounty's on you I get. And then with that last option, it's like all the win for me because like I get to shoot her and you at the same time, and I still get the bounty. Hmm. Maybe we should think about this for a second, yeah?""

While Reilly had been talking, the silent movement behind them resolved to a form Gryzzk knew all too well, and he didn't need a nameplate to know that Kiole was creeping up with a pistol in hand. Kiole came up closely, aimed, and Reilly's video pickup was suddenly replaced by a field of red as a single shot rang out, and then two more shots followed in quick succession.

There was a great deal of motion as Rosie switched feeds, first to Delia who was watching the floor, and then to Kiole who had a slightly obscured vision field due to carrying Delia. There was no talking until they reached the safety of the *Twilight Rose*.

Once there, the feed was switched to the internal camera that showed Kiole setting Delia down, who seemed to be in some sort of shock. Then Reilly wrapped both Kiole and Delia in a tight embrace, and a single word was choked out, barely audible.

He was a boorish man from another era. 

In 1917 he was suspended for a week and fined $100 for punching an umpire. Not sure if it’s the same incident, but that year the Babe had a start where he was ejected during the first batter after punching the umpire. Ernie Shore finished off that batter and proceeded to complete a perfect game. 

In 1921 the Babe was arrested for speeding, doing 28 mph in a 15. He spent a day in jail and was fined $100. 

Later that year he’d participate in an unsanctioned barnstorming tour, resulting in a 6-week suspension.

In 1922, after being called out trying to stretch a single into a double and throwing dirt in the umpire’s eyes, he climbed into the stands to fight a heckler in a Polo Grounds. When he couldn’t catch up to the offender, he offered to fight the entire crowd. 

He was named in a paternity suit in 1923 by Dolores Dixon, a Manhattan telephone operator. She was lying and withdrew her lawsuit. 

In 1925 he was sued for losing horse racing bets and not paying. He denied owing $7,700 to a bookmaker for that. 

In 1925 after a night on the town, he was late for batting practice. Miller Huggins fined him $5000 and suspended him until an apology 9 games later. 

In 1927 he was arrested in San Diego for violating child labor laws after allowing an 8 year old to read a poem in a show without the proper permits. Those charges were dropped. 

He was overall a rampant alcoholic and womanizer. And he tried doping by injecting extract from sheep’s balls. 

But TECHNICALLY his only conviction that I could find was for driving 28 in a 15.

Spoiler alert: it mostly delivered on its promises, but there are a few quirks to know about.

**Build and Packaging**  
Right out of the box, I noticed that this cleaner came as a set of 34 individually wrapped tablets. That might not sound like a big deal, but trust me, it matters. There’s no messing around with powders or liquid descaling solutions that tend to leak or spill. The pre-dosed tablets are convenient and easy to store. For someone like me who values simplicity, this packaging checks all the right boxes. However, I did notice that the plastic wrapping on each tablet isn’t exactly eco-friendly—something to keep in mind if you’re trying to reduce waste in your home.

**Performance and Efficiency**  
Using this product is as straightforward as those feature bullets describe. You toss a tablet into the water reservoir, run a cleaning or brewing cycle, and flush everything out with fresh water. Simple, yes, but the results speak louder. After using it in my single-serve coffee maker, the taste of my coffee improved dramatically. The tablets managed to remove some limescale I didn’t even know was working against my beloved morning beverage. I even tried it on an older espresso machine that I’ve been neglecting, and it seems like new life has been breathed into it.

**Key Benefits**  
- Easy-to-use tablets eliminate the need for measuring or mess.  
- Prolongs the life of your coffee maker, saving you money in the long run.  
- Restores the pure taste of coffee by removing buildup and residue.  

**Versatility**  
These tablets aren’t picky—compatible with pretty much all coffee machines, whether you’ve got a Keurig, Ninja, Breville, or some other brand of espresso maker. My coworker even used them on their drip coffee pot and had equally great results. I appreciate how it simplifies maintenance for households or offices managing varied machines. No one wants to juggle different cleaning solutions for different systems, and this product solves that problem seamlessly.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The plastic packaging for each tablet might not appeal to environmentally conscious users.  
- Slowly dissolving tablets mean a thorough clean takes a little longer than I anticipated.  
- While effective, it isn’t unscented as claimed—a faint but noticeable chemical smell lingered during cleaning.

**Cleanliness Without Guilt**  
What sets this product apart for me is the environmentally conscious formula. While I’ve seen some descaling solutions that seem super harsh, the manufacturers of this one use ingredients like sodium carbonate and citric acid, which are gentle yet effective. Nothing ruins a morning cup of coffee faster than an overpowering chemical aftertaste, and thankfully, my cup tasted as pure as ever after I was done cleaning. That said, the faint smell during the process might bother some folks, especially if you’re sensitive to those kinds of odors.

**Other Options to Consider**  
While these tablets impressed me, there’s no denying the competition out there. Products like Dezcal and Urnex cleaning tablets are popular among coffee aficionados for their quick-dissolving properties and broader brand recognition. However, the price-to-performance ratio here feels more attractive. Unlike some rival brands, these tablets didn’t leave behind any peculiar residues, and the individually wrapped tablets are easier to store than powders or liquids that tend to spill when mishandled.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
If you’re wondering whether these tablets are worth the cost, I’d argue yes, especially because 34 tablets can last you well over a year, even with regular monthly cleaning. Compared to competitors with fancy branding and higher price points, these tablets offer high-quality performance without making your wallet cry. Being budget-friendly yet effective makes the investment well worth considering.

1mkxazs,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1mkxazs/my_sister_technically_cousin_has_destroyed_our/,"My “sister” (technically cousin) has destroyed our relationship beyond repair, and I’m finally done.","This is going to be long. I need to get it all out. I’ve kept so much of this inside for years- constantly making excuses, trying to be the bigger person, trying to keep the peace. But I’m done.  
  
Let’s call her Anna. She’s technically my cousin, but I’ve called her my sister since we were kids. She and her younger blood sister (let’s call her Christine) moved into my house under foster care when we were young. A year later, their mom passed away. We became a family over the years.  
  
When I moved out at 18, Anna started having issues with my mom (who was her foster parent). Eventually, the foster agency moved her to a new home. Our sister moved in with their grandma. They were split up, but I kept in contact. I came home every summer to visit, including going out of my way to see Anna in her new placements. I even moved back partially to be closer, because I didn’t like that she was going through everything alone.  
  
Fast-forward to adulthood: Anna and I have had blowout fights every year or two, followed by long periods of silence. In the early years, I wasn’t great at managing my emotions and would engage too much. She’d lie, harass me online, twist stories- and I’d lash out. Now, I disengage. But she still spirals.  
  
Over the years, Anna's lying got worse. Christine and I learned not to confront her, because she explodes- full emotional meltdowns. Instead, we’d quietly talk about it between ourselves. Her lies have become so unbelievable, it’s hard to keep track. Often they’re twisted versions of the truth- just enough true to seem believable, but totally distorted.  
  
I used to drive over an hour, multiple times a week, because she’d call me sobbing about her abusive boyfriend. This happened for years. Every time they broke up (which was often), I was the one who showed up. Many times, they were back together before I even arrived. At one point, my boyfriend (now of 6 years) even drove me to pick her up from the police station after she got caught violating a no-contact order she had against her boyfriend.   
  
One of our big fights started when she called me crying about being homeless and sleeping at a Tim Horton's (which, wasn't the true- she could go home, she was just being dramatic. She went home that night). I said something about her horoscope (trying to relate and offer comfort), and she freaked out- accused me of being insensitive, reminded me I “have a mom” and she doesn’t. But she’s always has a place at my mom’s- she just refuses to live under rules like doing chores or not ordering Starbucks and food delivery every day.  
  
After that fight, while we weren’t speaking, she called my mom while my mom was on vacation and told her I was having ""old men"" over. I was 30, dating someone 20 years older, who she had met and even accepted help from. It was clearly just an attempt to cause chaos. My mom flew home early - money wasted - only to realize Anna was full of it. Just causing stress and drama, as always.  
  
Eventually, Anna apologized and said she was now on meds. I forgave her, again. She moved in with her new boyfriend to my mom’s house. My mom charged them $600/month total ($430USD, barely anything, and that was only because the boyfriend was moving in as well), but Anna couldn't handle being asked to eat dinner with the family instead of ordering out every day, or to clean up. When confronted, she exploded. Her boyfriend moved back home. She moved into my place, rent free- but still dating him. Big mistake on my part.  
  
At my house, she was still seeing her ex while with her current boyfriend. She lied about it constantly. Told us to lie to her boyfriend too. The ex was still giving her money while she was getting $2K/month ($1450USD) in pandemic aid. She’d spend it all by the middle of the month, every month, and become absolutely unbearable.  
  
She refused to follow a budget I helped her make, and got upset when I mentioned it, walking away while we were trying to discuss it. She mocked me and my boyfriend constantly until I had to ask her to stop. She threw a tantrum when I asked her to pay for her own weed while Christine was visiting and I was supporting both of them. Literal tantrum- slamming doors, stomping around, raging over something that she should have been doing from the get-go. That’s when she started talking to some guy on Instagram who offered her an apartment in exchange for s\**x once a month.*  
  
*Now, I was a s\*x worker* from 18 to 25- she did online s\*x work. I never judged her for what she chose to do. But she never wanted advice, just handouts. She would say things like, “I’m gonna have to f\*\*k people for money” essentially suggesting if I didn't financially help her, it would be my fault she had to do it. So I stopped reacting. She went through with it, didn’t get the apartment, and got ghosted. Not my problem, she was 26 at this point. She made her own bed.  
  
Eventually, she left my place. I don’t even remember how it ended, but she broke up with the new boyfriend and she moved back in with the ex again.  
  
Christine then moved in with us while fighting to get her child back from foster care. We found that Anna had trashed the spare room- vomit on the floors from drinking which damaged our wood floors and trim, as well as red hair dye and tattoo ink which stained into the wood.. Never told us when she did it, never cleaned it up herself or offered to fix it. Just left it like that, and later pretended she didn't know. Christine and I cleaned it quietly. We knew confronting her would lead to another breakdown.  
  
For nearly two years, we supported Christine and her son. Built a makeshift wall in our tiny living room to give her kid a bedroom. My partner was diagnosed with epilepsy during that time, having full tonic clonics sometimes multiple times a day, to the point where his face went blue during them. Anna was not supportive at all and had no problem starting fights while we experienced the most terrifying period of our lives.  
  
On Christmas eve to Christmas day, our power went out. We bundled up and made do, but Christine was very upset and had a bit of a breakdown about it. The next day, I went to my mom’s to take care of our dying family cat. Christine must’ve vented to Anna about being cold and Christmas being ruined by it, because I got SCREAMED at in voicenotes for “abandoning them on Christmas.” Even though I invited them to come with us- and it was Boxing Day. Anna was unhinged. Oh- and she screamed all of that into an iPhone we were paying for, which she had only paid two bills out of seven on. We gave her a month to transfer the phone plan or return it, and once that month was up and we said we were coming to get the phone, she made a scene. Her boyfriend messaged us harassing us too. When we picked up the phone, we brought her old one back- which was in the same condition she had given it to us. She gave us back a phone that looked like it had been whipped out of a moving vehicle. She promised to pay us for the damage. But of course, she never did.  
  
I let her back into my life again after that. This time, at arm’s length. She got a new place with that same boyfriend, but that relationship fell apart again when he cheated on her with a girl he ended up being with. His mom had cosigned for the apartment. When they broke up, she kept the apartment and she was trying to keep him in her life, stating that she only slept with him so that his new gf would see what it felt like to be cheated on. Then she got a new boyfriend which seemed to overlap with her sleeping with the ex. She was still cheating, still playing people. She even texted us “I made an oopsie” after sexting another guy behind her new boyfriend’s back.  
  
She kept asking Christine and I for money, saying it was for groceries or coffee- but we knew she never bought groceries. The amounts she asked for never added up to what she was saying it was for. We constantly felt manipulated. She 'borrowed' $1000 from her grandma and another $1000 from my mom to move again. Still no budget. Just chaos. She claimed that she just wanted to move, but I'm sure that the ex boyfriend and his mom had forced her to move as she couldn't stay at a place they cosigned.  
  
Back in March, she asked me why I seemed distant. I told her the truth, in a calm way: that it’s not okay to keep financially draining people who are already struggling. That it’s selfish to expect support but offer nothing in return. That my mom isn’t rich. Christine has a kid. I have my own problems. That I found all the damage she left in my home which she never told me about. And other stuff that isn't worth getting into because it requires me to explain even more about her shitty behaviour. She snapped. Sent me voicenotes saying she “already knows she’s a piece of shit,” playing the victim, and blaming me for not bringing it up sooner. Then she said ""fuck you"" and quickly blocked me before I could respond. Something she always does.   
  
The next day, she posted a photo at my mom’s house with the caption “I win bitch, as per usual.” She also flaunted an expensive skirt that I left at my moms (which my mom had given her not remembering it was mine) on Instagram and has refused to return it since.  
  
Christine recently shared a passive-aggressive comment she posted with a video in her IG story, obviously directed at me, saying “if you have parents to fall back on, you are EXTREMELY privileged. Don't forget it and don't ever look down on the financial situation of people who don't have that privilege”. As if she doesn't spend her money frivolously on stupid shit like hair extensions multiple times a year, ordering food delivery multiple times a day, colouring her hair monthly, getting her nails done, buying things online constantly, going out drinking, etc etc. As if I don't live the life I live because I BUDGET and do not spend frivolously. As if she doesn’t have the same access to support, if not more- she just refuses to follow any of the rules that come with the support. I’ve received help from my family because I help back. I drove her to extracurriculars. I drove her to school. I paid her phone. I paid off her debts to drug dealers (weed) when she went to the hospital, likely to get out of those debts. I gave her a home. I 'rescued' her every time she cried wolf. I mentally and financially supported her, nonstop. And I never got anything in return, ever. Not even mental support. I was just given extra stress. I honestly cannot say one thing she has ever done for ME. She thinks that I just get given things because I have parents but everything I have ever been given came with a responsibility that she refused to accept. She's honestly the most ungrateful person I know. Ever her own sister, who experienced the same trauma as her, thinks she is ridiculous.   
  
I will note, the help I have received was being given a place to live as an adult (while working for the family business for very little pay, for a job most people don't last a year in), I was given a car at 18 (that could only be sold as a parts car as it couldn't be certified, and lasted about half a year before dying), and I was lent $1000 when my bf was diagnosed with epilepsy and we were paying almost $1000/month for meds, while Christine was living with us, that I paid back asap. It's not like my rent is paid by them, it's not like they have helped me buy a home, it's not like I have some trust-fund. They are not financially well off. But even if that was the case, I have also done so much for them. Any time someone needs a ride, or something delivered, or for something to be picked up, I am the go-to. When my mother was sick and needed help, I was there. I am always offering to help. It's not like the things I have been given come without a responsibility to the family. But she doesn't look at it that way. She expects things to be given to her without any expectation of her having to do anything in return, ever. From me, our family, from her boyfriends, from her sister. She's a user. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. There is so much more I am not saying because this would be a literal novel.  
  
Oh and for the record, she never paid back that $2000 she 'borrowed'. My mom tried to get her to help clean the house (as my mom has multiple autoimmune disorders now) to pay it back, and that lasted about a week. She only went as a means to rub it in my face and talk shit about me to my mom, which my mom shut down.   
  
Christine went through worse in the system and doesn’t victimize herself the way Anna does. That’s how I know- it’s not just trauma. It’s her. She is almost 30 and still acting the same way she did at 16. Lying and manipulating her way through life.  
  
I’m done.

**TLDR;** I considered my cousin a sister after she and her younger sibling came into foster care with us as kids. Despite years of trying to support her- emotionally, financially, and even giving her a place to live- she’s repeatedly lied, manipulated, used people, destroyed my property, refused accountability, and played the victim. She constantly asked to borrow money she never repaid, trashed my home, caused endless drama, and lashed out whenever anyone tried to set boundaries. Her younger sister went through worse, has grown up, and has turned out well. She didn’t. I’ve finally cut her off, and I feel sad but relieved.",1,1754664686.0,FamilyIssues,0,1.0,False

African Market
Address: 1004 N. Old 63

Email: africanmarketcomo@gmail.com

Phone: 319-777-3590

Hours: Call or email

Mahinga Tubirore used to drive to St. Louis every two weeks to buy he ingredients he needed to make traditional African Food.

That’s what inspired him to open his own African market on Old 63 in Columbia.

The small but well-stocked store offers a wide selection of produce, packaged snacks, spices, a small freezer section with fish and meat, fresh samosas and a large selection of flour, such as cassava, pounded yam, rice, bean and maize flour.

Tubirore’s main customer base is from Western and Eastern Africa, but he said he sees customers from everywhere, particularly the nearby medical and nursing schools.

When he noticed that a lot of students would bike or walk to his store, he decided to start making deliveries to better serve that community. That should start next month.

The market also carries ingredients from Caribbean, Jamaican, Asian and Hispanic cuisines.

“This market is for everyone, even though it’s called African Market,” Tubirore said.

Hong Kong Market
Address: 2006 E. Broadway

Phone: 573-474-2878

Hours: 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily

Hong Kong Market has been a staple of Asian-stocked groceries for 30 years. The market shelves are filled with fresh, hard-to-find Chinese vegetables, along with pantry staples, such as Shaoxing wine, hot pot bases, tofu, soy sauces and vinegars.

For many, it’s the only place to get these ingredients within 100 miles.

Every week, Shaoyung Wang makes a trip to Hong Kong Market for bamboo shoots, his favorite food, jasmine rice, oyster sauce, bitter melon and other staples of the Chinese meals he cooks to feel grounded during his Ph.D. studies at the University of Missouri.

For Wang and other Chinese students at Mizzou, Hong Kong Market is an essential part of their weekly routine.

“If you want to make Chinese food, you have to come here,” said Miles Zhang, a first-year doctoral student. One of his regular purchases is fruit-flavored jelly cups, a snack widely available at home.

Hong Kong Market also draws local Columbia residents looking for more variety. Kristin Smith, a full-time manager at Campus Dining Services’ Wheatstone Bistro, shops there once or twice a month.

“I love trying food from different cultures,” Smith said. “This is the only place I’ve found with a wide range of snacks. I always get Buldak ramen and Melona bars.”

Iyumva Market
Address: 705 Vandiver Drive

Phone: 573-219-1222

Hours: 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Thursday; 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday; 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday; closed Saturday

Owner Angelique Iyomugaba opened Iyumva Market on Vandiver Drive about six years ago. Her family ran an African market in her hometown of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and customers from Columbia would drive to Iowa for their groceries.

Her sister, who has lived in Columbia for 15 years, told her the city needed an African market. So Iyomugaba began commuting from Cedar Rapids to Columbia once a month with a supply of traditional African ingredients.

“I started bringing stuff to them in Columbia, especially our main foods like matoke, which is green bananas,” Iyomugaba said.

She was inspired to open her own market here at a time when there was no African market. Now there are least two others.

When she opened the store, it primarily focused on African staples, but it has since expanded to include ingredients from Caribbean, Hispanic, Asian and other cuisines.

She noticed overlap in certain cuisines, such as African and Hispanic, in the use of ingredients like plantains and cassava root.

“I know our big profit is African communities,” Iyomugaba said, “We also try to add things for other people so everyone who comes in can find something from home.”

The store’s most extensive selection includes ingredients found in central and eastern African food — countries like Rwanda, Congo, Burundi and Kenya. For example, a Congolese recipe, sombe, is made from cassava leaves.

Besides the basics, the store also stocks ingredients to customize dishes. There are different versions of sombe, she said, some with cow’s feet, fish or peanuts, and the store tries to supply them all.

The store also has a large selection of frozen meat and fresh and smoked fish, such as sardines, catfish and tilapia.

You can find a lot of common ingredients in her store, such as tomato paste, but they taste a bit different than the ones from an American grocery store, she said.

The store also has a small selection of clothing, jewelry and traditional baskets.

Lee’s Market
Address: 700 Cherry St.

Phone: 573-443-1977

Hours: 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily

Located just steps from the Mizzou campus, Lee’s Market offers Korean groceries and household staples in a compact and convenient location. For students without cars, the downtown spot makes it an accessible option.

Lee’s Market was established in 1990 as Chong’s Asian Market. In 2011, John Lee purchased the store, and it became Lee’s Market. The family-owned and operated business is now run by John, Mikyung and Jean Lee, and it primarily offers a wide selection of Korean foods and beverages sourced from five distributors in Chicago.

“We see new faces all the time, like students, international families, people just curious to try something different,” John Lee said.

“What really keeps them coming back is that we’re local. We’re part of Columbia, and shoppers appreciate that,” Lee said.

Graduate student Erica Gong said she goes to Lee’s Market several times a year.

“It’s not as big as Hong Kong Market, but it’s great when you’re craving Korean food or just feeling a bit homesick.”

The shop stocks kimchi, rice cakes, frozen dumplings, sauces, ramen and popular Korean snacks and drinks. Gong said the owner speaks Korean and is easy to talk to, adding a layer of familiarity for customers.

“It’s the kind of place that feels warm,” Gong said. “It reminds you that even in a small town, there’s a little slice of your culture here.”

Los Comales Restaurant & Store
Address: 3510 Interstate 70 Drive S.E.

Phone: 573-447-6243

Hours: 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday; 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Sunday

At Los Comales, visitors can either enjoy a bite to eat or browse a lively market for a variety of authentic Mexican ingredients.

Los Comales has become a community hub, despite being tucked in a strip mall on an outer I-70 road. Seasonings, produce and tortillas can be picked up from the shelves, and a butcher’s counter features fresh meats for dishes like homemade carne asada.

Other cultural snacks, ingredients and sweets line the shelves of the market, as well as everyday household goods. At the front counter, customers can buy artisan goods like handbags and pulseras — hand-woven bracelets — while they check out.

The restaurant side of Los Comales has a menu featuring carne asada tacos, chilaquiles and even red snapper, a staple of Puerto Rican cuisine and just one of many dishes that brings a taste of home to Columbia’s Hispanic community.

Los Comales opened in 2022 and was founded by lifelong cook Ezequiel Mendez. In June, a second location opened in Mexico, Missouri, 45 minutes northeast of Columbia. This location will feature only a restaurant, with much the same menu in the original restaurant and market.

Mercadito Oasis
Address: 1301 Vandiver Drive

Phone: 573-810-0258

Hours: 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Saturday; 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sunday

A fews doors down from the only Honduran restaurant in town on Vandiver Drive is the only Honduran market in town.

The shop, which opened in March, sells traditional Honduran items, such as certain cheeses like cuajada and requesón, Mexican butter (mantequilla), catracha sugar, Honduran coffee, chips, fresh vegetables and fruits like lichas. Juices, different flours and rice also line the shelves.

Juan Carlos Izaguirre is the owner of the market. While he’s not one of the owners of the Honduras Restaurant, he said he’s friends with the owners. They appeal to the essentially the same customer base.

“It’s people from Honduras, Guatemala and Central America, American people (too), because they visited my country, and they know about these products,” Izaguirre said.

He said one older gentleman became quite emotional at the sight of the products in the store, which actually happens frequently.

The store evokes memories for many immigrants from Central America, he said, because almost all of the products are imported from the region.

“Every time when they come in, they say, ‘Oh, I remember that when I was a kid,’” Izaguirre said.

Shwe Market International Foods
Address: 800 Vandiver Drive, Suite 101

Phone: 573-514-7010

Hours: 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Saturday; 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sunday.

Though less well-known among students, Shwe Market is a favorite among longtime Columbia residents and those seeking Southeast Asian staples. Located in a modest strip mall off Vandiver Drive, it carries products from Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam and other countries.

Shwe Market was opened by Burmese refugee Cing Cing Hlamyo to bring more cultural ingredients to Columbia’s Asian community. Located in north Columbia, the store offers fresh produce, frozen meats, snacks and spices from across Southeast Asia.

What sets Shwe apart is the fresh produce and the community atmosphere.

“I’m so glad I found this place,” said Jonathan Cook, a regular customer at the store. “It reminds me of the markets back home, with fresh produce packed in boxes, reasonable prices and new shipments arriving every Thursday.”

Local customers say the market often has seasonal fruits like rambutan, mangosteen and Thai basil that are hard to find elsewhere in town.

Although the store is smaller than others in town, customers say it stands out for its fresh produce and consistent service.

Nainesh Patel, like many entrepreneurs, identified a problem that led to an idea.

He needed to drive to St. Louis or Kansas City to find specialty imported produce for the recipes he and his family wanted to eat.

So Patel opened up shop in March 2022, selling all sorts of Indian snacks, flours, rice, lentils, frozen foods, drinks and specialty produce.

“Before we opened, there was no Indian grocery store in town, and we have a quite decent community in town,” Patel said. “Everybody (had) to go either to Kansas City or St. Louis for their groceries. We were thinking, (there) should be a decent store in town.”

Patel said he carries things like tindora, Indian bitter melon, ridge gourd, and long squash.

“It’s all Asian produce, and it’s hard to find anywhere in Columbia,” Patel said.

Patel said he still must drive frequently to bigger cities to get certain items for the shop, but now customers who want these specialty items don’t have to make that same trip.

I like to drink regular whole cow’s milk in my coffee. I have a milk frother I use to make a sort of latte foam on top.

The last month I have not been able to make even the slightest foam. I’m buying the same whole milk for years and never had this problem until recently. Doesn’t matter how hot the milk is or how long I froth it. It comes out a watery mess, exactly how it does when I have tried to use skim or 2%.

Warm whole milk is known to froth better due it its fat content. The less fat in the milk, the less stable the froth. For this reason I believe Tuscan brand is labeling their milk with a lower fat content as whole milk. ",2,1754664451.0,LowStakesConspiracies,2,1.0,False

Late peri (symptoms started at 42). ADHD with a neurospicy side of anxiety + mild depression. Probably PMDD? On stimulants (not helping much lately). Apologies in advance for the ADHD-tangent nature of this post.

**Current HRT:** estradiol 0.05 mg patch (1x/week) + oral progesterone 200 mg days 1–12/month. Cycle is wildly erratic — skipped 4 months last fall. When my gyno prescribed HRT in spring 2024, she said peri can *exacerbate neurodivergence* and that I was likely near the end AND symptoms often get worse towards the final transition to menopause. Yay? 😵‍💫

HRT worked great… until I started a *super demanding job* this spring. Then brain fog and anxiety came back with a vengeance. I’d had occasional aphasia before, but never this level of mental fog. I’ve been high-functioning ADHD my whole life (GenX latchkey kid raised by a single mom), but lately my focus has been *crippling.*

Last week, during the luteal phase of my unpredictable cycle, I had what I’ll call a “mini breakdown” — months of anxiety, panic, and pathological demand avoidance catching up to me. I called out sick for 3 days.

**Thursday:** Went to my PCP, saw a sweet young resident who took time to parse out anxiety vs. depression. Diagnosis: depression. Prescription: Lexapro 10 mg. I took a full dose that night. Didn’t sleep. Felt like my skin was on fire. The next morning coffee smelled nauseating, oatmeal tasted awful.

**Friday morning:** Got out of bed *knowing* I had to quit this job. My gut had been screaming \* GTFO \* since month one.

**Weekend:** Fantastic. Started my period for the first time in 82 days. Ate well, spent time outside, talked to my sister for two hours. Worked on my resignation letter. Took only ¼ pill of Lexapro at night until I could speak to my psychiatrist.

**Monday:** Resigned. Handled it well, gave two weeks’ notice, and blamed perimenopause (partially true). Thought the Lexapro was helping. I’ve been *more productive this week wrapping things up* than in my entire \~6-month tenure.

**Psych appointment:** Last night. He explained Lexapro takes 6–8 weeks to work and the micro-dose I took couldn’t have caused this turnaround. The relief was from quitting — the act itself lifted the fog.

**The downside:** Partner is not thrilled. We lose benefits + my paycheck.

**Next steps:** Yearly physical next week, virtual gyno appointment after that. Stopping Lexapro for now. Will discuss PMDD with gyno, though my unpredictable cycle makes that tricky. My Oura Ring is the only reason I guessed my period was coming.

Did I make a rash luteal-phase decision? Maybe. Will I regret it? Possibly. But I can live with it. I know the job market is rough — I’m open to anything right now.

If nothing else, I’ve learned that for me, sometimes the cure for “brain fog” is quitting the thing that’s making me miserable.

1mkx4bo,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitVaping/comments/1mkx4bo/about_to_try_to_quit_again_tw_pregnancy_loss/,About to try to quit again. (TW pregnancy loss),"So, I’ll be honest I’ve never quit nicotine ever in my life. I’ve been using nicotine since I was 12. I’m 25 now. The longest I’ve gone is the 3 days I had to spend in the hospital when my son was born (this was 10 years ago, I hid my pregnancy bc I was so young and dumb and part of hiding it was keeping up my habits. Also I was young and dumb and probably couldn’t have quit if I really wanted to) 

Since then, I went from cigs to disposable vapes to now I’ve had a tank mod for like almost a year now. I’ve been using 3mg free base juice since then, which is the lowest I can find without ordering juice online. 

In April I found out I was pregnant and immediately started cutting back w the vape, but 6 days later I miscarried. We decided to NTNP (not try, not prevent) and see what happened. Surprise! I got pregnant again immediately. I really struggled to put down my vices this time because I felt like I was going to lose the baby again. At my 8 week scan we discovered the baby had stopped growing 2 weeks prior and no heartbeat was detected. I lost the baby again. 

So, despite it being 5 weeks since discovering the baby had died, I still haven’t miscarried. I’ve gone right back to vaping all the time, smoking weed multiple times in the evenings, and drinking more than one coffee a day. Obviously I struggle with letting these vices go, even after discovering the second miscarriage I planned to continue to try to stop. But my birthday was coming up and I was so upset about how things have gone, I fell right back into my old habits and frequency of using these things.  

Well, my hCG is nearing zero and 2 months from now we can try again. In the meantime, I need to quit. Like, no ifs ands or buts, I need to quit before I get pregnant again. So yesterday I bought a 3lb bag of lifesaver mints (our fav, when we got together 5 years ago he had just bought a bag like this and it lasted like a whole year into our relationship lol). I put them in a bowl on the coffee table. I put some in our room. I put some in my purse. I put some in his work bag. We’re gonna try to quit, it’s expensive and we gain nothing from it. I listened to Alan Carrs Easy Way To Quit Vaping about 3/4s of the way thru after my first miscarriage, then stopped bc I switched jobs and didn’t have the time to finish it. I’m now unemployed for the time being and plan to finish the book and hope it helps me to actually fully quit. I know willpower isn’t the best method to quit but man even tho I know vaping does nothing for me, it is so hard to quit. I know all the things.

She swears it happened to a group of people she knew, friends of hers from an improv troupe who went on a weekend retreat together. I can’t vouch for how much of it is true, but the way she told it… well, let’s just say I’ve never been able to hear the words “Yes, and” the same way again.

\-

When Mara first began ‘teaching’ improv classes 6 years ago in her dorm common area, she never would have expected to end up here. 

An accounting major at first, then “undecided” for far too long, and now here, a struggling improv troupe leader. She was never really sure how she became the group leader, the whole idea had originated from YouTube and Saturday Night Live skits that she and her roommate (an insufferable theater major) had found funny. They thought that surely it couldn’t be too difficult for them to do something similar as a creative outlet for their otherwise very average college experience. 

The group started with the two of them, plus Mara’s boyfriend at the time, but gained traction quickly. Slowly, the rest of their friend groups wanted to join in on the fun, and within a year, they had an entire community-recognized ‘improv club’. 

They did open mic nights at smelly dive bars, created their own YouTube channel (with *very* mild success), and eventually even made small profits on their shows. Mara’s roommate originally led the group, using her theater experience to keep things moving, but after her abrupt departure 1 year ago, Mara was left with two choices. She could either let the group go their separate ways or she could step up to the plate and become the new leader. 

The group had been such a large part of her life for so long that she just couldn’t stomach letting it go without giving it another shot. And it wasn’t like she had anything better to do. Mara had been teaching Zumba classes at the local rec center to make ends meet between gigs, and the number of middle-aged white women attending her classes there was shrinking by the week. She couldn’t afford to *not* keep the group going. 

The first few months of running the improv group were fairly fun and easy to Mara, their bookings rolled in consistently and their social media stayed fairly active. But the last few months had been much more of an uphill battle. 

The group had found success in the first few years (and a few audience drinks) consistently selling out small theaters in the tri-state area. With ticket prices set at $15 per person it wasn’t too difficult to do. Their favorite show, Murder Mystery in the DMV, even went somewhat viral online 7 months ago. However, after the high of the viral show ended, the last six months had shown dismal ticket sales, less audience engagement, and even resulted in a 1-star review of the last venue they had performed at. 

Mara felt in her gut that something needed to change, and needed to change quickly, or else she was going to regret never finishing her accounting degree. 

Luckily for her, she had the perfect plan to reignite the group's spark, and it all started with Mara’s aunt's untimely car accident.  
  
Mara had never been particularly close to her aunt Marge. Ever since Mara was a child, Marge had lived outside of the city on a few acres of land with a somewhat dilapidated large house that sat right in the middle of the land. 

Marge would visit Mara and her family on birthdays, holidays, and when Mara’s grandparents had passed away. She never married or had children of her own. Marge had told everyone in their family that it was never in the cards for her, and they had all accepted that. 

So when Marge was struck and killed by a drunk driver 7 weeks ago, Mara had been surprised to learn that her somewhat estranged aunt had willed the estate to her. The paperwork had been settled, and now she held the keys to her aunt's stately 5-bedroom house. 

Mara had been once or twice as a child, but it was unfamiliar to her now as a somewhat grown-up. 

Mara got out of the small SUV they had rented to make the trip here. All but one of their group had agreed on carpooling. Mara had promised they would do no improv exercises until they arrived, much to the delight of the other passengers. 

Her no-frills tennis shoes crunched the gravel as she approached the rickety wooden porch. Car doors opened and closed behind her as the others got out, stretching their legs and grabbing bags from the vehicle.

“This place has... atmosphere. I’ll give you that.” Chris quipped from behind Mara, giving her a slight scare.

His description of the house was about as accurate as it could be. The house looked like it had sat sad and alone for a decade. Although it wasn’t crumbling, it seemed like it might start at any moment. 

Chris had been a part of the improv group for the last 2 years. Chris had also never intended to end up in this position; he was a *serious* actor, with Shakespearean stage roles under his belt (and a small stint as a dead body on a Law & Order spin-off). But after a few months of silence from his agent, he was forced to implement his backup plan. 

Starbucks. Starbucks had welcomed him with open arms, teaching him the ways of the barista quickly. He had loathed his early morning shifts and passing hot coffee to D-list actors who had taken over the roles that he was supposed to have. 

He had been scouring the internet for any auditions one night, really, any, when he saw a post that the improv group was looking to add a new member. Chris hadn’t seen any of their work, but with a pay of a few hundred dollars per gig and the possibility of exposure, it was something he couldn’t afford to pass up. 

Mara gave him a quick side eye glance. She never understood his need to wear so much jewelry, with such deep V-neck shirts. Chris was a great addition to their scenes, but off the stage, he was somewhat of a diva. Mara had a sneaking suspicion that she knew why his agent had ‘ghosted’ him. 

“Okay guys, let’s go over the rules and schedule one more time. Did everyone receive the email?” Mara asked.

There was a collective eye roll from the other members, but Dan's was the most exaggerated. 

Almost a year ago, during one of Dan’s many forgettable Tinder dates, a *very hot* woman (solid 10/10, no notes) had leaned across her drink and said, *""I just love a funny guy.""* Naturally, Dan lied and said he performed improv. She made him prove it. He Googled the nearest group that night and showed up to the group's open workshop the next evening. He planned to say a few jokes, maybe snap a pic for Instagram/the hot woman, and ghost the scene entirely.

Instead, he received an invitation to join the group again. Somehow, despite his obvious sarcasm, Dan had the timing, the presence, and, according to Mara,  “an ironic detachment that makes you weirdly magnetic.”

So he stuck around. What started as a bit had become a weekly obligation… and, annoyingly, a kind of community. Plus, the small payday from gigs didn’t hurt him either.

Dan had a solid day job working in IT for a local finance company, so he didn’t need to rely on the gigs as heavily as other members of the group. That was something he often forgot when he wasn’t seriously rehearsing like the others. 

Sometimes he had a hard time shaking off the corporate aesthetic he was forced to put on at work. In his bag all he had were more collared shirts.

Now here he was, using his Paid Time Off,  trapped on an ‘improv retreat’ with these people. 

“Mara, you know wifi is dangerous to the human body and that I don’t condone internet usage.. Can you give me a handwritten copy?” Said Lila from where she was standing next to Dan.

At least Lila was kind of hot, even if she did smell a little weird sometimes, he thought.

Unlike Dan, Lila wasn’t invited to join the improv group.

She just kind of… showed up.

About three years ago, the group was running a barely attended show in the back room of a vegan bakery-slash-crystal-emporium called **“**Chakra Cake**.”** Right as the lights went down, Lila walked in, barefoot and radiant, carrying a handmade kombucha bottle and smelling somewhat strongly of patchouli. She took a seat in the front row and laughed at everything — even the weird bits that didn’t land.

After the show, she approached the group and said:

*“You all have such open auras. I dreamed about this exact scene three nights ago. I think I’m supposed to be part of this.”*

Mara’s roommate, still high on the adrenaline of the one person who clapped during the blackout scene, said yes.

No one could explain how it happened, but Lila just kept showing up. Rehearsals, shows, meetings. She never asked for permission. She never did any of the venue work like hauling equipment in and out of the building. But she brought tea, tarot cards, and unexpectedly brilliant character work when the moment called for it.

According to Lila, improv is a sacred energy exchange and she’s been ""channeling archetypes"" since childhood. No one knows where she lives. She sometimes leaves rehearsal early to “help a birth” or “clear the energy of an office building.”

But, she's never missed a show, and here she was on the retreat with the rest of them.

Just as Mara was about to go over the retreat schedule for the third time, holding up Lila’s printed itinerary like a flight attendant, the gravel driveway crunched with the sound of tires.

Everyone turned.

A small, beat-up sedan crept up the long, tree-lined drive, one headlight out, the engine making a sound. The car looked like it had been salvaged from the set of a student horror film. The group watched as it rolled to a slow stop near the others’ van.

Out stepped Natalie. 

Mara took notice that Natalie was about 4 minutes late, according to the schedule. If she had ridden with the rest of them in the SUV, this wouldn’t have been a problem, Mara thought.

Natalie didn’t say anything at first. Just stood beside her car, one hand still on the door, eyes scanning the house.

Lila tilted her head. “Mmm. Heavy energy.”

Natalie finally looked at them. “I got a little lost. My GPS started rerouting me in circles like five miles back. Kept saying I’d arrived, but there was nothing there.”

Dan gave a mock shiver. “Cool. Ghost road.”

Natalie cracked a very slight smile. “Maybe.”

Mara forced a friendly wave. “Glad you made it!”

Natalie reached into the passenger seat, grabbed a leather-bound notebook and a battered duffel, and joined the group on the front steps without another word.

No one was quite sure how Natalie had ended up in the group. She’d shown up to an improv workshop in February, hadn’t spoken for the first forty minutes, then stepped into a warm-up exercise and delivered a monologue so raw and chilling that it left the group in stunned silence. No one clapped. No one laughed. Chris looked personally offended.

Since then, she’d come to every rehearsal. Always early. Always watching. She didn’t do bits. She rarely played games. But when she performed, it was like something else was in the room.

Mara never officially invited her. She never asked to join. But when they booked the retreat, Natalie was already on the email thread. No one had the guts to remove her.

“Now that we’re all here, can I continue with the ground rules and schedule review?” Mara asked, very mildly annoyed.

“Of course, Mara, it’s not like you’ve already gone over it multiple times and asked for our opinions on it multiple times already.” Chris replied, his necklaces lightly tinkling as he moved with his words. 

Everything Chris said was dramatic. Chris did nothing subtly.

Dan shot him a look. Mara ignored them.

“Okay crew, if we want to get back into the groove of our group and recreate the successes we’ve previously had, we have to all agree that we will follow the rules and the schedule of our retreat. Understood?” Mara asked the group.

Natalie gave a slight nod (she wasn’t sure what successes Mara was referring to). 

“So the ground rules are as follows, and if you ever forget them, please refer to your emails.” Lila raised her hand at this, but Mara ignored her and continued.

“Rule number 1: Stay in character! This retreat is a fully immersive experience at all times. Meals, chores, bathroom breaks, all in character. The whole thing is a scene. Rule number 2: Yes and everything! No blocking ideas, no denying new directions, no saying something is dumb.” Mara gave Chris a look, but he ignored her.

“Rule number 3:  The safe word is pineapple! Although I don’t want us to have to use it, if anything gets too real, too personal, or too anything, use the safe word pineapple to get out of it.

Rule number 4: Respect the space! This is my aunt’s old home. It’s an antique, and there are antiques inside it. Try not to break anything or get too nosy, even I don’t know what’s in there.” Mara said.

**“**That’s smart.**”** Natalie cut in, her voice quiet but serious. 

Everyone turned to look at her.

She shrugged.**“**Old houses are like… emotional sponges. Bad stuff sticks around. You don’t want to wake it up**.”**

Chris raised an eyebrow. “Are you saying this place has, like, emotional mold?”

Natalie shrugged in response, and Lila nodded her head in a ‘yes’ motion. It was Mara’s turn to roll her eyes.

“Rule number 5: No phones, no wifi, no distractions! Phones will be left in the car; I have the keys to the car. If you must make a phone call, please do so at least 10 feet away from Lila and the house. We must unplug in order to reconnect.” Mara finished the rules, feeling satisfied with her closing sentence. 

Chris interrupted her moment of peace.

“No phones? What if my agent calls while we’re here?” He asked.

“Chris, you haven’t had an agent in at least a year.” Mara replied flatly.

Dan snorted at Mara’s response, and Chris resigned himself. 

“Everyone got it?” She asked; she desperately needed the group to follow the rules and the structure that she was trying to create. 

Mara was a firm believer that true creativity comes from strict structure.

“Got it, thanks for organizing all of this, Mara. It’ll be nice to unplug for a little while.” Chris said, taking a final check of his work Slack channel before setting his status to ‘Offline’. 

“Yes, thank you, Mara! I can feel the renewed group energy already.. Or has someone forgotten to turn off their wifi?” Lila asked.

No one responded. They were used to Lila’s ‘quirks’. The group was busy turning off their phones, gathering themselves and their personal items, and walking up the old porch steps to the front door. 

The house was big. Bigger than any of them expected.

Not in a modern, open-concept kind of way, more like it had been slowly added onto over time, by someone who never quite cared if one hallway connected cleanly to the next. Still, it had enough bedrooms for everyone to have their own, and that alone made this retreat feel borderline luxurious. They’d done gigs where all five of them crammed into one double-bed motel room, taking turns sleeping on yoga mats and using their coats as blankets. No one was eager to go back to that era.

The decor was... difficult to describe. Sparse, but in an unsettlingly intentional way. The rooms that *were* decorated felt like time capsules from several decades ago — but not in a charming, curated thrift-store kind of way. In a *bordering-on-haunted* kind of way.

Too many mirrors, all slightly different shapes. Faded velvet drapes. A taxidermied peacock in the hallway that seemed to be staring directly at the bathroom. The air smelled faintly like mothballs and rosemary.

Mara hadn’t changed anything since inheriting it. Honestly, she hadn’t known where to start.

Her aunt Marge had never been a fan of HGTV. Or electricity. Or people, really.

Most of the house still ran on half-functioning light switches and ancient pull-chain lamps. The upstairs hallways creaked no matter how lightly you stepped, and some of the doorways had visible grooves in the wood where the doors had been opened and closed hundreds of times over decades.

While everyone claimed their rooms (Chris went straight for the master), Natalie wandered through the halls. She didn’t mind the dust on most surfaces, and preferred to see the entire place before she got too settled in. 

One of the rooms had a slightly ajar door. Natalie peaked through the open crack and saw a wall lined with books. She nudged the door and it creaked open a bit more. After a short pause the door opened the rest of the way on its own, groaning the entire time.

She didn’t think this would be considered too nosey, especially if the door was basically opening itself, so she took a step inside. 

The entire room was wood panelled, and the wood matched the floor perfectly. Besides the wall of books, the room contained a large wooden desk with a faded leather chair behind it. In the middle of the room was a lounge setup. A couch and small velvet chair centered around a wooden coffee table. 

There was a creak and Natalie turned quickly back to the door. It was only Mara. 

Mara entered the room slowly, looking around. 

“My aunt never let me play in this room when I was little."" She said quietly.

Natalie paused in front of one of the bookcases — the only piece of furniture that looked well-used. It was built into the wall and packed with old volumes, almost none with titles on the spine. She ran a finger down the side of one book and pulled it out. The leather cover creaked like an old joint.

“Hey Mara,” she said, holding it up. “Was your aunt into theater?”

Mara glanced at the book.

The cover read: *The Art of Ritual and Stage Presence: Invoking Emotion and Memory Through Performance.*

“No,” Mara said slowly. “She wasn’t really into… anything.”

Natalie flipped through it. The pages were dense and yellowed.

“Feels like something Lila would sleep with under her pillow,” she said jokingly, handing it off to Mara as Dan entered the room.

Dan took a look at the book and raised an eyebrow. 

“Yeah, this definitely looks cursed.” He said with a light chuckle.

He mimed being sucked into the book, then set it down on the coffee table in the center of the room.

Everyone laughed. The moment passed.

But later that night, the book was still sitting out on the coffee table.

Open.

After the group members got settled in, they slowly reconvened in the kitchen of the old house. 

Mara was putting away the groceries she had brought for the trip, basics like eggs, bread, sandwich fixings, various snacks, and ingredients for a vegan spaghetti (Lila’s suggestion). 

Dan’s contribution to the kitchen was a case of PBR. He liked PBR in the semi-pretentious, non-ironic kind of way that so-called ‘hipsters’ do these days.

Chris’s was similar. He had brought a single bottle of expensive whiskey. It was definitely out of his budget, but he couldn’t bear the thought of showing up empty-handed, or with an averagely priced gift. 

As the three of them put their items in their respective places, Lila lit a small bundle of sage.

“Do you have to do that every time we go somewhere new?” Chris said, pinching his nose.

“It’s always good to cleanse the space, so there’s room for new energies like ours.” She replied, not at all deterred by him. 

Dan had moved to the window that looked into the expansive backyard. He wanted to get away from the sage smoke.

“Hey guys, it looks like there’s a fire pit in the yard. With a big fire like that, Lila, we won’t even need the sage.” He said, pointing out the window.

The rest of them in the kitchen took a look out the window. There was indeed a good-sized fire pit outside the back door. Behind and around the fire pit was nothing but trees and natural landscape. 

“I didn’t even know that was out there..” Mara said, shrugging.

She headed out the back door, hands full of chips and crackers, Dan following behind with an opened can of PBR and a small stack of paper cups. Lila continued saging the kitchen. Chris let out an exasperated sigh before snatching up his whiskey bottle and following the other two out the back door. 

Natalie entered the kitchen just in time to see the small group depart. 

Lila smudged with her sage mostly in silence, occasionally humming something very quietly to herself. 

Natalie opened the fridge, looked around, cautiously grabbed a PBR from the shelf, and then shut the fridge door.

“You coming out to this fire thing?” she asked, leaning on the counter.

Lila paused, waving the last curl of smoke toward the ceiling.“Just about done. Mara wants everyone together, right?”

“Yeah,” Natalie said, opening her drink.  “She’s already doing the thing where she pretends it’s not mandatory, but it totally is.”

“She gets twitchy when we free-range.” Lila said, grinning.

Natalie smirked, already heading for the door. “Better come before she starts assigning fire circle roles.”

“I’m right behind you,” Lila said, giving the sage bundle one last little flick before snuffing it in the sink.

The sun had gone down for the evening, which made the fire they had started in the backyard seem even larger than it was, flaring up between them as they sat in a circle around it.

There were a few empty PBR cans around the fire, and a smattering of paper cups that may or may not have held the aforementioned expensive whiskey. Lila brought her own mug out, and was drinking something murky and questionable from it.

“Alright, let’s do a new game here.” Dan said, holding up his beer.

Since no one was allowed to object (per Mara’s rules) no one did.

“Let’s do ‘Yes and..’ but...drunk!” Mara said with a little giggle. 

She was always a little more free after a few drinks. 

“I’ll start!” Dan volunteered.

“I can’t believe you brought a goat to our wedding!” He said dramatically.

Chris immediately picked it up.“Yes and, I accidentally put your wife’s veil on it!” Chris said, proud of himself.

Lila jumped in.

“Yes and, I believe it’s legally your officiant now!” 

Natalie joined in, quietly, but with purpose.

“Yes and, that goat is my uncle, and we’re very proud of his accomplishments!”

That got a laugh out of everyone. 

They continued playing ‘Yes and’ for a few more rounds, each one getting more and more absurd. At one point, Mara had a thought to herself that this was exactly what the retreat was supposed to be about, reconnecting the group and finding their spark again. 

While playing this game, she felt like they were doing just that. 

“Yes and, I need to use the ladies' room.” Chris said, standing and swaying slightly in front of the fire.

“Yes and, go you old man.” Dan replied. 

With that Chris started his easy walk back to the house. It was lit up by firelight that danced over its rough edges, making it seem like the house itself was moving. 

That was disorienting to Chris, who had already had a few paper cups full of whiskey at this point. 

With little grace, he made it inside the house. The rooms were now dark, lit only by fire and moonlight that was coming in through the windows.

He made his way down the main hall in search of the bathroom he knew was on this floor. The hall was dark, darker than most of the house, since all of the doors to the rooms were tightly shut. 

Chris reached the bathroom, going in to do his business, not even bothering to turn on the light. 

He washed his hands in the dark, then re-entered the hallway. Something had changed. 

A door on his right had drifted slightly ajar, letting the tiniest bit of light out into the hallway. As he went to pass it, he took a quick look inside. 

Inside the cracked door were books, many books. Some of them appeared to be almost glowing in the light from the window. 

Something caught his eye. There, on the table. A book lay open, moon and fire light playing on its pages. 

Chris pushed the door open and stepped inside to take a look at the book. 

“Theater Rituals for the Devoted Stage..” He read quietly to himself. 

“Hmm.. this could be interesting.” He said as he picked the book up and began to make his way back outside to the rest of the group. 

“Yes and, took you long enough, Chris!” Lila shouted as Chris reapproached the fire. 

“What is that?” Mara said, pointing to the book under Chris’s arm. 

“Drink Mara! You broke character! You have to drink!” Dan said excitedly, pointing at Mara. 

Mara gave a small sigh and took a short sip of the cup of whiskey Chris had poured her when they first started the fire. She grimaced. Just because it was ‘expensive’, as Chris had stated, didn’t mean it was good. 

“Theater Rituals for the Devoted Stage!” Chris proclaimed loudly, holding the open book out in front of him like a script. 

“Oooh, I love a good ritual!” Lila said, clapping her hands together excitedly. 

“Where did you get that from?” Mara said, attempting to interrupt him, but Chris had already started. 

“It even has blocking notes! It’s a perfect monologue.” He said, clearing his throat. 

Chris stood up taller, puffed his chest out, and began reading with the Shakespearean approach he had perfected during his time at Starbucks. 

“To the Sacred Order of players, who speak truth through lies and give breath to the dead with their words, gather now beneath flame and sky. Let none wear masks who fears the face beneath.” 

“Okay, weirdly spooky start..” Natalie said as Chris took a breath between words.

“We call now on the Echo Beyond: keeper of forgotten lines, patron of vanished voices. Enter this circle and bestow us with the gift of divine spontaneity. May we channel the chaos, embrace the unknown, and offer up the selves we do not yet know.” Chris continued, never dropping his dramatic tone.

“Really, though, what is this and where did it come from?” Mara said, brows furrowed as she tried to remember more about her aunt Marge and why a book like this would be in her house. 

Chris ignored her questions, never looking away from his script. 

Natalie noticed that his tone had changed slightly. What began as almost a mocking tone had turned very serious, very quickly. 

They all had come to know Chris as an ‘over-actor’, a term for those who were desperate to have the *it* factor, but unfortunately did not. So Natalie did not find his approach very surprising. 

“We are vessels. Let the spirit of the stage enter us. Through laughter, through terror, through revelation. 

Take our fear, take our pride, take our names.” His body had tensed up during this moment in his monologue. 

Everyone sat in silence. This was one of Chris’s best performances to date. 

Too bad there were no ticket sales for this one, Mara thought to herself.

“We are ready.” Chris finished his performance, let out a large sigh, and visibly deflated.

At the same moment, a cold gust of wind came through the fields around them, rushing over the fire. In response, the fire cracked loudly. A single flame shot high into the sky. 

Mara yelped.

“Thanks, Chris, I think that’s enough of that for one night.” She said quickly. 

Chris didn’t respond. His gaze was firmly planted on the fire. Mara could see the reflection of the flames in his unblinking eyes. 

“Are you good?” Natalie asked, standing to lightly touch Chris on the shoulder. 

He jumped at her touch, eyes refocusing on the group. 

“Yeah, sorry, was just doing a bit..” He said unconvincingly.

“Rituals like that can take their toll on a person.” Lila said, sipping from her mug, seemingly undisturbed by the events that had just taken place. 

“Okay, but that wasn’t a ‘ritual’, it was just a monologue, right? It was just a bit?” Dan said in a tone that wanted to be factual, but instead came out more like questioning. 

“Yeah. Just a bit.” Chris said as he took his seat next to Natalie. 

“Alright, new rule.” Mara cut in.

“No more monologues from weird books that we find in the house. Also, just a reminder, that part of rule 4 was ‘no snooping’.” Mara said, glancing at each of them around the fire. 

She needed to maintain the integrity of the retreat's structure, and Chris’ monologue had come dangerously close to throwing it off.

“Sorry, Mara, that looks like the book that we found in your aunt's office earlier.” Natalie said, not wanting to upset Mara any further. 

“Yes, we promise to obey rule 4 and the new rule from here on out!” Dan said, eager to move away from this experience. 

Above them, the wind died down. The fire resettled itself even smaller than it had been originally. The house and the land became very, very quiet.

I'll write out more of what I know of the story if people are interested, it gets even crazier but I didn't have time to get to the next part.

I’m in the market for a new grinder so before I spend some money I was actually looking for a chance at borrowing a few and making the decision


I’m wondering if anyone has a coffee grinder I could borrow for a little while. I live in London and I’m more than happy to pick it up and drop it back off — I’ll take good care of it.

I’m looking to make just one or two cups a day, so it won’t be heavily used. I mainly want to see how it fits into my daily routine, how it sits on the countertop, and how easy it is to dial in for a good cup.

If you’ve got a spare grinder or one you’re not using at the moment, I’d really appreciate the chance to try it out.

Happy to offer a small contribution, a bag of beans, or a coffee on me as a thank you.

Thanks in advance for your kindness",0,1754664082.0,LaPavoniLovers,0,0.5,False

Imagine this: you’re settling into Saturday’s energy, the day ruled by Saturn, the cosmic authority of time, boundaries, and discipline. You can feel the shift. Your magic starts to take on structure and meaning. In the latest article, you’ll find out why this energy is ideal for spells focused on protection, release, and spiritual foundation.

It begins with a simple but powerful journaling practice. Before your coffee even cools, you’ll take a few minutes to reflect. The prompt invites you to explore dream fragments, emotional weight, or unfinished goals that need clearing. This isn't about writing a novel. It’s about making space for clarity.

Afterward, you’re encouraged to brew a cup of tea infused with cleansing herbs. Think sage, lemon balm, or a touch of honey for sweetness. This simple act opens the door to grounding your energy. It’s a moment to breathe, reflect, and prepare for intentional work.

From there, the ritual moves into tarot. A three-card spread for Saturday's that gives structure and purpose to your spell work. You’ll learn how to draw insight from the cards without overthinking it. Black stones like tourmaline or obsidian rest nearby, not just for show, but to anchor and protect your space.

We helped each other out of bad relationships. We confided in each other about struggles we were having. We talk a lot about deep conversations and have an immense amount of trust between us. I thought at the beginning of our friendship he might have had feelings for someone else. I asked him that repeatedly and he swore he did not and gave me very specific reasons why she was not his type and reasons why he didn’t see her that way. As time moved on, we got closer and he would tell me really sweet things like how genuine and sincere I was, that I needed to have confidence in myself, that I was pretty, etc. He also knows I’m insecure about my body and told me he didn’t have a type when it comes to physical attraction.  He would also banter and flirt with me to the point that several people noticed and made comments to me. He would always be helpful (we used to work together but don’t anymore) at work and get me coffee, help me out etc. He also said cryptic things like “both of us need to find someone who keeps the spark alive for us” and that he “needed a confident girl who made the first move.” Well after dinner one night we were talking and about to go home, and he said “there’s one thing I’ve been lying to you about,” so I asked what it was and he said “you’re the one person I can’t tell it to, I’m going to make you guess” and we laughed back and forth for a few minutes, and I felt like he was hinting he had feelings for me. And then boom. He admits he has feelings for the girl he assured me months ago (multiple times) he didn’t. I was so confused, and ended up telling him he was incredibly confusing and I had feelings for him because I didn’t want to regret not being honest, pretending everything was okay, and letting bottling up my feelings impact our friendship. He laughed at me when I told him I had a crush, and was like “score” and I was like “do you think that was easy for me to say? Is that a joke to you? You led me on and flirted only to tell me you had feelings for someone else?” I don’t regret being honest because I’ve never admitted feelings to anyone and took a step out of my comfort zone. But I am hurt and worried I messed up badly by misreading things that I thought were flirting and real feelings for me. He claims he had no idea that I felt that way, or that he even was flirty with me and that he’s bad with understanding signals and women. Idk if I fully believe that. Anyone else think I misread signs and signals? Or do you think he knows what he was doing? ",1,1754663861.0,dating_advice,2,0.67,False
1mkwy1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/CampingGear/comments/1mkwy1m/upgrading_my_cooking_setup_advice_appreciated/,Upgrading my cooking setup - advice appreciated,"For the last few years my cooking setup has been a trusty MSR Pocket Rocket 2, Toaks 1100ml Ti pot, Optimus clip on windshield, Jetboil canister stand. It's performed well and reliably, but over the last year in particular as certain uses have become more regular, I've noticed some shortcomings with this setup that I'd like to address. 

I'm based on Denmark, and spend most of my nights out on climbing trips in Sweden, Germany, Austria and Italy. There's little to no serious hiking, so ultralight isn't a requirement, size is more important than weight, though lighter is better than heavier. We're usually out for 2-5 nights at a time, and always have access to canister fuel. 

There are two main scenarios that I'm planning for:

1. Solo cooking on trips with myself, and possibly 1 - 2 others, where we're each making our own food. This will typically be some coffee and boiled eggs in the morning, and then cooking a meal in the evening that'll either be dehydrated, or added to water.

2. Me and my partner, possibly also cooking with 2 - 3 others. Breakfast would be the same as on the solo trip, coffee, (more) boiled eggs, possibly porridge. Dinner is a little more extravagant with my partner's cooking, could basically be anything you'd cook at home on the stove.

The main shortcoming I'd like to address with my current setup mainly relate to the group scenario, as this isn't really at all possible with a 1.1L pot. The Pocket Rocket is also sub-optimal with larger pots, I'd rather have a remote canister with a larger burner and better simmer control. For the solo setup, I'm unhappy with how slow and loud the Pocket Rocket is, especially in comparison to my friend's JetBoil Sumo. The difference in boil time is surprising every time, and his stove isn't as inconsiderately loud to sleeping campers. I've realised that what I most often use the Pocket Rocket for is boiling water, and while it's done the job fine enough, I'd like to improve my cooking experience.

My current idea was inspired by one of my close friends setups, and unfortunately my research has only confirmed his sound logic. I'm leaning towards a JetBoil MiniMo for solo trips, and Primus Primetech 2.3L stove set for group trips. I'd be looking to buy the Primus first as that is higher priority, but I'm going to buy both setups when things go on sale, or second hand. 

Other remote stoves I've considered are the MSR Whisperlite Universal (love the versatility and repairability, but if I'm being honest, it's overspec'd for my usage and therefore too expensive), Soto Fusion Trek, Kovea Spider. In any case I'd need to find a good pot, which would likely be the same size as the Primus pots, but unlikely to have the heat exchange. I'd also need to buy a separate windshield, which wouldn't fit inside the pots, and is unlikely to be as efficient as the Primus. It's possible that a custom setup could be cheaper, lighter, more efficient than the Primus, but I haven't been able to find one.

Does this sound like a good idea? Any shortcomings you can think of with the JetBoil MiniMo or Primus Primetech 2.3L?",1,1754663849.0,CampingGear,1,1.0,False

I was prescribed 18mg of Strattera over 6 months ago, in addition to 300mg of Wellbutrin XR that I’ve been on for about two years. Everything was smooth (no pun intended) for the first 4.5 months.

Then, suddenly, and out of no where, my digestive system slammed on the brakes. Like, hard. I’m talking next-level constipation. The kind that makes you start bargaining with the universe. I’ve never experienced anything like it, and I’ve had my fair share of post-surgery pain meds, so that’s saying something.

For the past month and a half, I threw everything at it. Miralax, gut supplements, stool softeners, osmotic laxatives… and still needed enemas or stimulant laxatives just to make anything happen. 

Three days ago, I decided to stop taking Strattera because I couldn’t deal with it anymore and wanted to rule everything out. Today, I had my first natural poop in 1.5 months. No laxatives. No enema. No chugging multiple doses of Miralax. I almost cried. I will never take for granted my morning post-coffee poop again. 

I’m genuinely sad about it because Strattera worked so well for me otherwise. But if you’re months in and suddenly can’t poop to the point that you’re considering how much eating food is worth it, it very well could be the drugs, even if you tolerated it well at first.

1mkwwij,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1mkwwij/thalasson_humanitys_last_island_chapter_2_a_hfy/,Thalasson – Humanity’s Last Island. Chapter 2. A HFY Science Fantasy Isekai.,"**Chapter 2 - The Ship** \- *Leon discovers the Sea Pearl*

Leon stepped out of the Citadel of Thalasson for the first time.

With him came ten high-power automatons in the form of Senate Guards. They were clad in plate armor, wearing heavy, flowing gold-yellow cloaks and elongated helmets richly engraved with gold. In their hands, they carried halberds, and at their sides were bastard swords. Normally, fitting a bastard sword at the hip would be difficult—but since they stood nearly two meters tall, it posed no problem. Magical runes were engraved into their armor; with his enchanter and magical engineer abilities, Leon could see that they served damage reduction and boosted abilities like strength and speed. The old humans of Thalasson had not skimped on these warriors.

A carriage stood ready, drawn by horses that looked quite normal.  
“Are those real horses?”

A13 looked at him askance.  
“What do you mean, Master?”

“Well, are they flesh golems or automatons that merely resemble real horses?”

“Thalasson also has green pastures and a horse breeding program run by flesh golems. You sometimes say wise—and sometimes a bit silly—things, Master.” A13 sounded amused.

“And you’re sometimes a mean automaton!”

“My maximum operational lifetime of 200 years has been significantly exceeded, Master. There may be an error or instability in my mana-stone personality matrix.”

""Or maybe you just start developing somekind of real personality beyond the dutiful robot."" Leon thought.

“I like you just the way you are, A13. Let’s head to the harbor.” He climbed into the carriage with A13 and examined his automaton secretary. A13 looked human except for his eyes and wore a long white robe decorated with a golden sash engraved in geometric patterns, as would have been customary in antiquity. His eyes were biomechanical, his irises glowing with silver bioluminescence.

A13 wasn't suited for combat. Leon had never seen him move quickly—but that wasn't necessary. His abilities as a secretary were a thousand times more important to Leon, who felt overwhelmed by his new life in this world. The entity had told him he must live according to his potential and that a grand mission awaited him, and at that moment it had sounded like the right path. But now, ruling over an island as large as Cyprus or Sardinia, he was no longer so sure.

“What are you thinking about, Master?”

“I’m thinking that we have a sizeable fleet, but we lack crew for most of the ships and combat flyers—at least none with the necessary skills. It will take a long time before we’ve bred enough flesh golems to man the fleet effectively.”

“You could also pursue alternative options, Master.”

“Are there?”

“Yes. You could have cloned humans created in the factories, not merely human-like flesh golems.”

“I’m not sure that’s a good idea…”

In his week here, Leon had formed the impression that the old humans of this world were quite advanced, but also had a massive superiority complex toward other races. They had founded many cities. The many places whose names began with *Thal-* or *Tal-* were evidence of that. Today, according to spy bird reports, all those cities are inhabited by elves, beastmen, Grimgnomes, and the unfamiliar dark-skinned Askari—or worse, conquered by the Legion and their large, muscular species—the Dunakali.

How would cloned old humans feel when their cities lie in the hands of other races? For Leon, it was clear it would inevitably lead to war. As a reincarnator from beyond, he had no Thalasson national pride, so he could see things more objectively. To him, it made sense that human cities had been taken by other races after more than 500 years of absence.

Moreover, he was an impostor. He was Leon in the form of Fenno Cavil—the Consul of Thalasson. But apart from the gift of enchantment magic and knowledge of magical engineering, he possessed no deep background knowledge of this world. In other words, he was something of a fraud—and the fact that the entity had tasked him with saving humanity and the world’s races would not be enough for outsiders to accept him. Bringing the old humans back didn’t seem like a good idea.

“We’ve arrived at the military harbor, Consul.”

A Senate guard opened the carriage door, and Leon stepped out, looking down from the raised access road to the lower-level military harbor. It was colossal—a testament to the mighty sea empire the old humans of Thalasson had built: a true thalassocracy.

He counted four carrier arks and their escort squadrons, each consisting of a battleship and four cruisers of various sizes, docked in various stages of overhaul. From the documents, he knew none of the four squadrons were fully operational due to the age of the ships and the fact that automatons had to completely refurbish each vessel.

Humanity had perished due to a fertility crisis. After centuries of research, the automatons discovered that humanity’s powerful mana reactors had emitted radiation that caused infertility and DNA damage. These reactors had been widespread throughout Thalasson’s civilization. Parts of the old genetic archives for flesh golems and human clones were also damaged or destroyed.

Once the automatons discovered this, they began independently restructuring Thalasson’s entire energy infrastructure—first the medical facilities, then the capital itself, and now the land areas and ships. The ships had to have their old heavy reactors removed and replaced with two or four low-power reactors that emitted much less background radiation.

This was a painstaking process, which is why, of the four carrier arks, four battleships, and sixteen cruisers, only two cruisers were currently operational. However, on Leon’s orders, the automatons had focused heavily on the first squadron. Within a month or two, the first squadron would be ready—though likely still short of a full crew. Leon had many challenges ahead. Considering he had only been an employee in his past life, he was proud of what he had accomplished—but as fulfilling as it felt personally, it wasn’t enough on a civilizational scale.

They descended into the harbor. One of the two cruisers—the *Solana*—lay ready. A light cruiser with a twin-turret housing two mana cannons. Compared to Earth’s kinetic guns, mana cannons were less efficient in damage and range—but they generated no recoil. That meant they wouldn’t stress or fatigue ship superstructures, and the ships didn’t have to carry ammunition.

They also appeared as a blend of 18th-century sailing ships and WWI-era warships—white steel, golden runes. Whoever had built these vessels had invested in a “glorious” aesthetic.

Leon boarded, followed by the Senate Guards. On the ship, he was greeted by a crew of older flesh golems, including a few simple golem-mages—perhaps resembling sixty-year-old humans and half-elves—and a female human automaton in a uniform with the signature mechanical eyes. Also aboard were fifty standard combat automatons.

“Welcome aboard, Consul. You look stunning!”

Leon was taken aback by the comment from the female automaton, who looked at him with eyes full of reverence.

“Ah, pardon,” she bowed gracefully like a court lady before a king. “I am Captain G0X19. I command the *Solana*. We are ready to set sail and drive the enemy galleon to flight, eradicating it to the last man—everything in the name of our beloved creators!”

“Captain Gox,” Leon gave her a nickname as he did with A13. “We intend to investigate the galleon, not necessarily sink it. Please bear that in mind. We will board if it’s safe and rescue the crew.”

“But, sir… you’re the last human! If we lose you…” She looked to A13 who merely shrugged.

Leon gestured at the imposing Senate Guards standing behind him.  
“That’s why I brought the Senate Guard.”

“I understand, Consul. I hear and obey.”

“Then let us approach the elven ship!”

“Please follow me to the bridge.”

Leon and A13 followed Captain Gox. Leon found it slightly difficult to navigate all the ladders and narrow steps but grew accustomed to it. The bridge looked less mechanical and more magical. Crystals and nautical instruments were everywhere—rangefinders, old yellowed sea charts, and similar things. Leon skimmed the maps. Privately, he had been a sailor, so he understood some chart markings, even if he didn’t know the symbols in this world. But that could wait.

“Captain to crew. We are departing. Our destination is the enemy elven galleon in our coastal waters. We will determine whether it poses a threat—and, if necessary, destroy it!” Gox sounded somewhat enthusiastic for a moment and then, with noticeably less zeal, added: “But at the Consul’s request, we will first investigate it and only destroy it if it poses a risk to him.”

Leon rolled his eyes.

A shudder ran through the *Solana*, and it began moving under its mana drive. The ships of other races used sails, but Thalasson’s vessels ran on mana. The Legion used sails for smaller ships and mana propulsion for their large warships—of which they had many more than Thalasson, according to spy bird counts.

The *Solana* glided smoothly out of the harbor. Perhaps the sea was calm, or the mana shield that enclosed the island prevented the sea’s turbulence from reaching Thalasson’s waters—but there was no rocking to be felt. As a little sea rat, Leon had never been prone to the typical seasickness many inexperienced sailors suffered from.

As they approached the shield, Captain Gox activated several devices together with two old flesh-golem mages who stood on the bridge.

“Signal sent. Shield tower confirms code received... We are permitted to pass through.”

Before Leon’s eyes, a large opening formed in the mana shield, and the *Solana* moved toward it. The rest of the shield remained unaffected and fully operational.

Once the *Solana* had passed through, the shield closed behind them.

Leon was genuinely impressed by this protective barrier. It was, in essence, a kind of world wonder—a marvel that had kept the island safe, even without active defense management from its former masters.

Slowly, the galleon came into view. The *Solana*’s twin turret took aim but did not fire. Captain Gox, with a deep bow, handed him her spyglass.

“Master: The galleon shows signs of fire damage and heavy wear—possibly from a storm. She’s listing and may even be at risk of sinking. Her sails appear mostly destroyed. Her guns are inactive.”

“Could they pose a threat to us?”

“Yes, Master. It seems their cannons are strong enough to cause damage. However, they have a shorter range and lower rate of fire compared to our weapons.”

“Hmm.”  
Leon compared the ships—roughly on par with First World War vessels or maybe those from twenty years prior—to this sailing ship, which had two wooden gun turrets reinforced with metal slats mounted on its bow. The elves’ improvisational ability was not to be underestimated, but this was more of a slapdash solution than a professional job. A Mad Max-style retrofit. In his mind, he compared it to the homemade vehicles he had once seen among rebels in the Middle East—compared to real tanks.

The races of this world were adaptable—but also desperate...

It's the difference between walking out of your house feeling like a million bucks versus looking like you wrestled with a particularly aggressive hedge trimmer. And trust me, I've been on both sides of that equation more times than I care to admit :)

## Why Your Skin Deserves Better Than Basic After Shave

Remember those old-school after shaves that basically felt like pouring liquid fire on your face? Yeah, those days are officially over. **Modern luxury after shave oils** have completely revolutionized the post-shave game, and honestly, it's about time.

Here's the thing – your skin goes through absolute hell during shaving. You're literally dragging a sharp blade across your face, removing hair and often taking some skin cells along for the ride. What do you think happens next? Your skin freaks out, gets irritated, and sometimes decides to trap those new hairs under the surface just to spite you.

That's where a **premium after shave oil** steps in like a superhero. Instead of that burning sensation followed by tight, uncomfortable skin, you get this smooth, hydrating experience that actually makes your face feel better than before you started shaving.

## The Science Behind Luxury After Shave Oil (Don't Worry, I'll Keep It Simple)

Ever wondered why some guys seem to have naturally smooth, irritation-free skin while others look like they've been through a blender? The secret often lies in their post-shave routine, specifically their choice of **after shave treatment**.

**Quality after shave oils** work on multiple levels:

• **Immediate Soothing**: Natural oils like jojoba, argan, or sweet almond oil calm inflamed skin instantly
• **Deep Hydration**: Unlike alcohol-based products that dry you out, oils penetrate deep to restore moisture
• **Barrier Protection**: Creates a protective layer that shields your skin from environmental irritants
• **Ingrown Hair Prevention**: Keeps follicles clear and reduces the likelihood of hairs getting trapped

The magic happens because **premium formulations** don't just sit on your skin's surface – they actually absorb and work with your skin's natural healing processes.

## Breaking Down the Ingrown Hair Problem (And How Oil Fixes It)

Ingrown hairs are basically your skin's way of saying ""Hey, something's not right here!"" They happen when newly cut hairs curl back and grow into the skin instead of straight out of the follicle. The result? Those annoying bumps, potential infections, and that general ""I look like a teenager going through puberty again"" vibe.

**Traditional after shaves** often make this problem worse by:
- Drying out your skin excessively
- Creating micro-tears that trap dirt and bacteria
- Failing to provide adequate moisture for proper healing

But here's where **luxury after shave oils** shine. They create the perfect environment for healthy hair growth by:

• **Maintaining Optimal Moisture Levels**: Properly hydrated skin allows hairs to emerge naturally
• **Gentle Exfoliation**: Some oils contain natural acids that help remove dead skin cells
• **Anti-Inflammatory Properties**: Reduces the swelling that can trap hairs under the surface
• **Antibacterial Benefits**: Many natural oils have antimicrobial properties that prevent infections

## What Makes a Truly Luxury After Shave Oil Stand Out

Not all after shave oils are created equal – trust me on this one. I've tried everything from drugstore options to products that cost more than my monthly coffee budget, and the differences are night and day.

### Premium Ingredients Matter

**Luxury formulations** typically include:

**Base Oils:**
• Jojoba oil (technically a wax, but who's counting?) – closest to your skin's natural sebum
• Argan oil – loaded with vitamin E and essential fatty acids
• Sweet almond oil – lightweight and non-comedogenic

**Active Botanicals:**
• Tea tree oil for its antimicrobial properties
• Lavender for soothing and fragrance
• Chamomile for anti-inflammatory benefits
• Rosemary for circulation improvement

The key difference? **High-end products** use cold-pressed, organic versions of these ingredients, while cheaper alternatives often rely on synthetic substitutes or heavily processed oils that have lost most of their beneficial properties.

### Absorption and Feel

Ever used an oil that just sat on your skin like a greasy film? That's usually a sign of poor-quality ingredients or improper formulation. **Premium after shave oils** absorb quickly, leaving your skin feeling smooth and hydrated without that slick, uncomfortable feeling.

## Daily Use Benefits That Actually Matter

Let's talk about what happens when you make **luxury after shave oil** part of your daily routine. FYI, the changes don't happen overnight, but when they do kick in, it's pretty impressive.

### Week 1-2: Immediate Comfort
Your skin stops feeling like you've been slapped by an angry lobster after every shave. The burning, tightness, and immediate irritation become things of the past.

### Week 3-4: Fewer Ingrown Hairs
Those annoying bumps start appearing less frequently. Your skin begins to ""remember"" how to let hairs grow properly instead of trapping them.

### Month 2+: Overall Skin Improvement
This is where things get interesting. **Regular use of quality after shave oil** can actually improve your skin's texture, reduce fine lines (thanks to all that hydration), and give you that healthy glow that makes people ask what you're doing differently.

## How to Use After Shave Oil Like a Pro

Using **after shave oil** isn't rocket science, but there are definitely right and wrong ways to do it. Here's my foolproof method:

### The Application Process

**Step 1: Clean Slate**
Rinse your face with cool water to remove any remaining shaving cream or soap. Pat (don't rub) dry with a clean towel.

**Step 2: The Right Amount**
Start with 3-4 drops – seriously, that's it. **Quality oils** are concentrated, and a little goes a long way. You can always add more, but you can't take it back once it's on your face.

**Step 3: Warm It Up**
Rub the oil between your palms for a few seconds. This warms it up and makes application smoother.

**Step 4: Application**
Gently press the oil into your skin using upward motions. Don't rub aggressively – your skin just went through enough trauma during shaving.

**Step 5: Let It Work**
Give it a minute or two to absorb before applying any other products.

### Pro Tips for Maximum Benefits

• **Timing is everything**: Apply oil to slightly damp skin for better absorption
• **Don't forget your neck**: The skin on your neck is often more sensitive and needs the same care
• **Store it properly**: Keep your oil in a cool, dark place to maintain its potency
• **Quality over quantity**: Better to use a small amount of premium oil daily than a lot of cheap stuff

## Choosing the Right Luxury After Shave Oil for Your Skin Type

Not all skin is created equal, and neither are all **after shave oils**. What works amazingly for your buddy might leave you looking like you dunked your head in a vat of olive oil.

### For Sensitive Skin
Look for oils with **minimal ingredients** and avoid anything with strong fragrances or high concentrations of essential oils. Chamomile, calendula, and pure jojoba oil are your friends here.

### For Oily or Acne-Prone Skin
Don't skip the oil just because your skin is already oily – that's actually when you need it most. Choose **lightweight, non-comedogenic options** with tea tree or grapeseed oil bases.

### For Dry or Mature Skin
Go for **richer formulations** with argan oil, rosehip seed oil, or vitamin E. These provide the deep hydration and anti-aging benefits your skin craves.

### For Normal Skin
Lucky you! You can pretty much use any **high-quality after shave oil**. This is your chance to experiment with different scents and formulations to find your perfect match.

## Common Mistakes That Sabotage Your Results

I've seen guys make the same mistakes over and over again with **after shave oil**, then wonder why they're not getting the results they expected. Here are the big ones:

**Using Too Much**: More isn't better with oils. Start small and build up if needed.

**Applying to Completely Dry Skin**: Your skin should be slightly damp for optimal absorption.

**Mixing with Alcohol-Based Products**: Don't follow up your oil with an alcohol-based cologne or toner – you'll undo all the good work.

**Inconsistent Use**: **After shave oil** works best as part of a consistent routine, not as an occasional treat.

**Choosing Based on Price Alone**: Sometimes expensive doesn't mean better, but with oils, you usually get what you pay for in terms of ingredient quality.

## The Long-Term Investment in Your Skin

Here's something most guys don't think about: **investing in quality after shave oil** now pays dividends down the road. Good skin care isn't just about looking good today – it's about maintaining healthy, comfortable skin as you age.

Think about it this way – you're going to shave regularly for the rest of your life (unless you're planning to go full mountain man). Each time you shave without proper post-care, you're essentially creating micro-damage that accumulates over time.

**Premium after shave oil** doesn't just prevent problems; it actively improves your skin's condition with each use. The natural oils provide nutrients, the gentle massage during application improves circulation, and the consistent hydration keeps your skin functioning optimally.

## Why Daily Use Makes All the Difference

Some guys treat **after shave oil** like it's a special occasion product – breaking it out only after particularly rough shaves or when their skin is already irritated. That's like only eating vegetables when you're already sick and wondering why you don't feel great.

**Daily use** creates a cumulative effect:

• Your skin learns to expect and utilize the nutrients
• Ingrown hairs become increasingly rare
• Your overall complexion improves
• Shaving becomes a more comfortable experience
• You develop a routine that becomes second nature

The best part? Once you establish this routine, it takes maybe 30 extra seconds out of your day. That's a pretty small investment for significantly better skin.

## Final Thoughts: Your Skin Deserves the Upgrade

Look, I get it – adding another step to your morning routine might seem like a hassle. But once you experience the difference that **truly luxury after shave oil** makes, going back to basic (or no) post-shave care feels like punishment.

Your skin works hard for you every day. It protects you from the elements, heals from daily damage, and lets face it – it's pretty much the first thing people notice about you. Doesn't it make sense to treat it with the respect it deserves?

**Premium after shave oil** isn't just another grooming product – it's an investment in daily comfort, long-term skin health, and that confidence that comes from knowing you look and feel your best. And honestly, once you make the switch, you'll wonder why you waited so long to upgrade your routine.

**TL;DR:** Stevia and Monk Fruit = best for diabetics, Allulose = best for baking, Jaggery = most nutrients but highest glycemic index. Full breakdown below.

# The Quick Facts Table

|Sweetener|Calories/gram|Sweetness vs Sugar|Glycemic Index|Best Use|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Stevia|0|200-300x|0|Beverages|
|Monk Fruit|0|150-200x|0|Drinks/Coffee|
|Allulose|0.4|70%|<1|Baking|
|Brown Sugar|4|1x|65|Standard baking|
|Muscovado|4|1x|\~65|Fancy baking|
|Jaggery|4|1x|84.4|Traditional recipes|

# What I Actually Learned (The Surprising Stuff)

**🤯 Mind-blown moments:**

* Jaggery has a HIGHER glycemic index than regular sugar (84.4 vs \~65) - so much for ""healthy sugar""
* Allulose is technically sugar but your body can't really use it for energy
* Monk fruit might still trigger insulin even with 0 calories (jury's still out)
* Stevia can taste like ass to some people due to genetics (like cilantro)

**💰 Cost reality check:**

* Monk Fruit = expensive AF
* Stevia = pricey upfront but you use tiny amounts
* Allulose = getting cheaper but still premium
* Everything else = normal sugar prices

# Real Talk Reviews

**Stevia (7/10):**

* Pros: Zero everything, dirt cheap per serving
* Cons: Bitter aftertaste, baking is a nightmare
* Reddit verdict: Great for coffee if you can handle the taste

**Monk Fruit (6/10):**

* Pros: Clean sweetness, zero calories
* Cons: Stupid expensive, some get licorice vibes
* Reddit verdict: Bougie Stevia

**Allulose (9/10):**

* Pros: Actually bakes like sugar, minimal calories
* Cons: New kid on block, pricey
* Reddit verdict: The chosen one for keto baking

**Brown Sugar (5/10):**

* Pros: Tastes good, available everywhere
* Cons: Still sugar with extra steps
* Reddit verdict: It's fine, I guess

**Muscovado (7/10):**

* Pros: Complex flavor, some minerals
* Cons: Still basically sugar, hard to find
* Reddit verdict: Brown sugar's cooler older sibling

**Jaggery/Piloncillo (4/10):**

* Pros: Lots of minerals, traditional vibes
* Cons: Higher GI than regular sugar, what's the point?
* Reddit verdict: Overhyped health halo

# Bottom Line Recommendations

**If you're diabetic:** Stevia or Monk Fruit only **If you bake a lot:** Allulose is worth the premium **If you're broke:** Stevia goes furthest per dollar **If you don't give a damn:** Brown sugar works fine **If you want to feel fancy:** Muscovado for special occasions

# Personal Experience Corner

Anyone else think Stevia tastes like metal mixed with sadness? And why does everyone say Monk Fruit is ""natural"" when it goes through more processing than a Hot Pocket?

Also, PSA: Don't go crazy with Allulose at first. Trust me on this one. Your digestive system will send you a strongly worded letter.

I switched to McDonald’s iced coffee from Starbucks years ago when McCafe started. When I order an iced coffee, I always order a large iced coffee and there’s almost always an issue. It’s overly milky, packet sugar is added instead of the liquid cane sugar, sometimes i’m handed an all black iced coffee

I don’t think employees are taught the iced coffee recipe, not the vanilla or caramel flavored ones, when someone says “i want a large iced coffee please”, that recipe

If I have to talk to an employee, they always ask “What flavor do you want?” and I always say I just want the liquid cane sugar, the way it is made according to the recipe supposedly…

It’s become a running joke between my partner but it sucks lol. 2 out of 10 iced coffees will be how it’s supposed to be made where i can take a sip and say ahhh. The rest are all shit

I very much look forward to my coffee for the day like most addicts

Who do I talk to that would care enough to ensure the iced coffee is made properly? Manager, franchisee? Do I write a letter? I’ve been buying an iced coffee at McDonald’s at least five days a week for years, and I have the receipts to prove it, and it just sucks with such wild and consistency, such as no sugar, overly milky, it just sucks, bruh 😅

Certainly, in an ideal world, I’d be open to meeting irl (eventually) to grab a coffee or catch a movie… you know, just one human looking to find another human to do things with- but that’s my long shot :)  Despite my introvert tendencies, I genuinely enjoy meeting people, learning about what makes them tick and I’m easy to talk to. Tbh, solitude is comfortable but I am getting sick of my own company. 

So, if this wee blurb grabs someone’s attention, feel free to get in touch. Oh, I’m not religious! Added the prayer because I’m willing to try anything at this point!

1mkwnlq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/1mkwnlq/husband_is_resentful/,Husband Is Resentful,"And I totally get it.  My husband (43M) and I (43F) have been together for 27 years (since high school) and married for 17 years.  We have 2 kids (14F and 7F), own a nice home in a nice neighborhood, and things have been pretty good overall.  However, we unexpectedly lost my mom in 2021 after a short illness, and I took on a lot of responsibilities for my dad (71M) and my husband is so frustrated by all of it. 

In the beginning, I was just setting him up on auto-pay for his bills because Mom always took care of the bills.  Then it was making sure he got a home-cooked meal a few times a week, because he was eating fast food or frozen meals every day (I would invite him over to have dinner with us). As time passed, I began to realize how little my dad knew how to do.  He could manage household tasks like dishes and laundry, but his home was covered in dust.  Then he wouldn't keep up with medical appointments and medications.  He wouldn't actually read his mail, he'd just toss it in a pile (he allowed insurance policies to lapse).  He didn't pay the taxes and registration on his truck.  I think there was a depression component that went along with all of this, but his health started to decline because he wasn't taking care of himself.  My husband never complained about me helping dad, but he would get aggravated that dad wouldn't do things for himself that my husband felt he was fully capable of.

It was a slow transition from me helping with small tasks to dad basically relying on me for almost everything.  Help with his insurance, help with his cellphone bill, help with his cable and internet, help with scheduling home maintenance, etc.  I don't think I realized it at first - I was just trying to help my grieving father.  Before I knew it, I had basically started running 2 households.  I was handling all the daily tasks that come along with our family of 4, running a small business out of our home, and taking care of all the small minutiae of dad's life, too.  I realized at about the 2 year mark after mom's death that I had never really grieved, and it hit me really hard.  I was getting overwhelmed and burnt out quickly.  Everything that I was responsible for started suffering.  The house was messier, I would forget important dates or appointments, I became more withdrawn and isolated.  I finally started seeing a therapist and things got a lot better for a time.

Dad finally began to branch out and start doing a few things.  He reconnected with a family friend who had lost her husband about 15 years ago, and they struck up a close friendship.  After several months, that friendship turned into something more, and dad started seeing her pretty regularly.  Dad came to me in March of 2024 and asked if I would be okay with him moving in with her in our hometown (about 3 hours away from my home).  Not gonna lie, it was weird for me, but I was happy that he'd found a companion, so I encouraged it.  He moved in with her in May of 2024.  Once he moved, I wasn't as involved in the details of his life anymore.  He didn't ask me to do things for him all the time, I didn't have to take care of meals and home maintenance anymore, and I finally had some room to breathe and rest.  

Then seven months later, dad was diagnosed with cancer.  He chose to seek treatment at the hospital near my home.  He asked me if he could live with us temporarily while in treatment.  My husband and I spoke about it, and though he was reluctant to do so, my husband agreed to let dad stay with us during cancer treatment.  Honestly, I've never dealt with anything like this before.  I was naive to the intricacies that go along with a cancer diagnosis.  Silly as it may seem, I thought I'd help dad get to his appointments, support him through treatment, and then he'd head back to his girlfriend's place.  I was so stupid...

Dad moved in with us in mid-January, and immediately began to have complications.  My strong, healthy, perfectly normal dad became an absolute shell of himself.  He cognitively declined and couldn't make any decisions for himself.  He was hospitalized for 34 days.  He refused to eat the hospital food and would send the PT and OT people away, so he rapidly lost 40+ pounds.  He couldn't answer basic medical questions or really participate in his own care at all.  It all happened so fast and I was frantic and absolutely beside myself with worry.  My husband was super supportive and sympathetic while dad was hospitalized.  Once my kids were off to school everyday, I'd take off to the hospital and stay there all day so I could facilitate conversations with Dad's care team and make sure he had a meal that he would eat.  Admittedly, my husband took care of basically all of my household responsibilities from mid-January until early March until dad was discharged.

When dad got back to our home, he was in pretty rough shape.  He needed help showering and dressing.  He needed help getting up and down the stairs to his room.  I made sure he had his medications and meals everyday.  PT and OT came to see him at our home several times a week.  I became consumed with getting him stronger.  And slowly, he got stronger.  We still have some hiccups here and there, but he can shower and dress himself and he can get up and down the stairs unassisted.  The major problem now is that he kind of got used to being waited on hand and foot.  He may grab a cup of coffee for himself, but he won't even pour his own bowl of cereal or make his own sandwich.  His cognitive ability is back to about 90% of what it was before treatment and he SHOULD be able to do things for himself, but he just... won't.

I still coordinate appointments (of which there are MANY), I make sure he takes his meds (he has demonstrated that even if the meds are in a spot he can see and reach, he won't take them without prompting), I make sure he eats (otherwise he would just sit on the sofa watching TV and not eat).  He was participating in PT and OT and actually got quite a bit stronger, but once he was graduated out of the program, he stopped trying to exercise, so he started getting weak again.

My husband wants me to just stop doing anything for my dad.  He says that dad is capable of doing things for himself, and that I do too much for him.  He wants me to tell dad that if he won't do the most basic tasks to help himself get stronger and gain weight, then he needs to move out because our home isn't a long-term care facility. He wants me to toughen up and get angry at my dad and basically kick him out.  And I truly understand what he is saying, and agree that my dad needs to do more for himself to regain independence.  But he's still my dad and I love him.  If the things I do for him are improving his quality of life, then I want to make sure he's as comfortable and happy as possible.  It doesn't feel like my mom has been gone that long, and I'm not sure I could handle losing dad yet.  He responded well to his cancer treatments (although we won't know for some time whether he's out of the woods), so I feel like he still needs some time.

What I've noticed over the past couple of months is that my husband has become cold and distant with me.  He has a short temper with our kids.  He has very little sympathy for my feelings or position in all of this.  He has expressed that he feels like I ""steamrolled"" him into agreeing to this arrangement.  Neither of us really knew what we were getting into, so I don't feel like either of us would have agreed if we had know how taxing this would be. He asks me how my day was, but gets aggravated if I talk about my dad at all.  If I express frustration, or sadness, or any kind of upset at all with my dad's trajectory, he basically shuts down and doesn't want to hear it.  Or he'll say ""I'm not trying to be mean, but you need to tell your dad to get out.""  

I desperately want my marriage to survive this hardship.  I love my husband so much - he is truly my best friend and I value his opinion above anyone else's.  I also want to be there for my dad and be supportive of his recovery journey.  I'm afraid if I evict him from our home, he'll give up entirely and stop fighting to regain his health.  I feel like I'm being ripped in half and given an ultimatum.

How do I stay true to myself while also respecting my husband's frustration with our situation?  I can see a light at the end of the tunnel because dad seems stronger everyday, but I don't want to rush the process.  However, every day that dad is still here is another day that drives a wedge into my marriage.  My husband won't talk to me, touch me, or even offer a supportive hug anymore.  I don't know what to do and I'm paralyzed over all of it.  I guess I'm looking for advice on how to juggle the two most important men in my life and my love for both of them.  I don't want my husband to eventually hate me.",2,1754663159.0,CancerFamilySupport,2,1.0,False

(Sound of opening and closing the door)

Where is everybody?

Oh, I was upstairs, talking on the phone. I didn't notice it's already that late. So why are you still here?

Am I interrupting?

Oh, so you are going home now?

No, it's just...

No, nothing happened... Do I look like something has happened?

Ok, maybe, but I don't want to talk about it... But I... I think I don't want to be alone right now. But I don't want to bother you either. 

Are you sure?

Yes, coffee would be great.

(I guess some sound of making coffee in this moment would be good addiction)

We didn't talk a lot before, am I right?

Really? Never?

Yeah, I'm not really talkative. And I mostly come here for money, not for friends. 

Andy? I think he's just easy-going with everybody. Have you ever heard somebody saying ""I don't like Andy""? But I'm not sure if I would call him a friend. We even didn't ever hangout in private.

So we're almost complete strangers... What do you usually talk about with strangers?

I don't talk with strangers either... So...

Yeah, books. I can talk about books. Do you read books?

I don't think I've read any of these... Any authors?

Sounds familiar. I've probably read something but it wasn't my taste.

I like science fiction. 

Not, not really. I mean... I do like Star Wars, but that's not that kind of sci-fi. I'm more into classics. Have you heard about Phillip K. Dick for example?

Blade Runner, Minority Report, Total Recall - these are all adaptations of his books. He was a genius! Reading him is like entering a different state of mind. For example - The Man in the High Castle. It's about how the world would look if Germany and Japan would win the second world war. It's mind-blowing! And there's more... Why are you laughing?

Oh, I guess I might get a little overexcited when it comes to books. It's just... I really love books.

Other authors? Lem, Polish writer. He was incredible. Dick even said once that Lem is probably a team of writers, because he was too much for one author. And the more I read of Lem, the more I see his point. His books are so diverse...

Solaris, with George Clooney, is based on Lem's book. But the book is way better. If I can recommend something for the beginning - Tales of Pirx the Pilot. It's rather easy to read, but still incredible. It's a collection of short stories, so you may just read a few for check.

My favourite? Definitely Terminus. Gosh, it's such a marvelous story. It's kind of science fiction gothic.

Yes. It's a story about Pirx starting a new job and the space ship he's taking over seems to be haunted. 

I won't say more, you have to read it now. It's not long.

Sci-fi is not only about the future and space and rockets... There are many subspecies. You would probably find something you like.

Oh oh oh! A long time ago I had a roommate who studied Russian language. He's kind of responsible for my love for sci-fi, cause there is lot's of great Russian writers in that genre. He once translated a Bulychev short story - Someone Else's Memory. About a scientist who cloned himself, but his clone kind of gained his own personality, being aware he's just a copy. And he decides to solve a mystery from his, or more their past. It's like you just divide in two and one half decided to cure your trauma against you. It's such a masterpiece! I still keep the copy of that translation. I could send it to you. If you want, of course.

I'm a nerd? Guess so...

I don't look like one? Sorry to disappoint you, ha ha ha!

Yeah, I'm feeling a bit better now. But tomorrow I will wake up in a different reality and I'm not sure how I'm going to handle this.

Maybe. Maybe things won't look that bad when the dust settles. But I have a weird feeling that there is a long road before me.

No, I still don't want to talk about it. If I say it out loud it will mean it really happened. Maybe tomorrow. Or someday. Or never.

It's just... You don't expect some things to happen to you. And when they hit, you are completely unprepared and powerless. It feels a bit like my mind doesn't believe, but my body knows the truth.

Stage of denial? Maybe. What's the second stage?

I don't think anger is something in my style. Have you ever seen me angry?

Hahaha, it really looks that bad from the outside? Of course I have emotions, I just don't feel like I should wear them for everyone to see. Especially in a workplace. 

No, I don't think it's bad to show emotions. It's more like a personal choice. In fact - a moment ago you've seen me overexcited, so it's not that I keep them all to myself at all costs.

Oh, it's true, I'm avoiding Ruby as much as I can, but not because she is extremely intense in showing emotions, but because she is so loud... I would cope with her emotions without a problem if she would be about a half of her level of loudness.

Of course I prefer more peaceful environments, but I don't think that's something bad. I've always been that way.

No, I don't isolate myself. You'll be surprised, but I do have friends and I do spend time with them. Sometimes. But they are highly selected.

I just don't think you have to be friends with everyone you know. There are people you vibe with and there are people you don't. What's the point of wasting your time for someone who you don't feel good with?

Yes, but how many friends can you have to still be able to keep this as a quality relationship?

Yes, friends do come and go, and it's very sad that you mentioned it, but that's the point: to keep them close as long as possible.

Oh gosh, you really see me keeping a spreadsheet of my friends. I look so cold?

And what kind of categories would I sort them by?

Oh boy... It's rude, and cruel, and funny at the same time. How could you? 

Have you finished your coffee?

Yeah, I did mine too. 

No, it would be stupid to stuff myself with more caffeine, when there's probably a hard night waiting for me.

So... Do you have any plans for the rest of the day?

Wanna go for a walk?

I'm glad. Let's go!

1mkwldu,https://v.redd.it/ulvo85xz1thf1,What are the benefits of creating a strong personal brand?,"Why your reputation is your most valuable asset

A compelling personal brand opens doors before you even knock. It’s not just about popularity—it’s about trust, clarity, and being unforgettable. Learn how a strong personal brand can become your silent advocate in rooms you’re not even in.

What Is a Personal Brand, Really?

Your personal brand is the perception others have of you based on what you consistently say, do, and represent. In an era of hyper-connectivity, your digital presence, communication style, and professional values shape your brand—whether you’re intentional about it or not.

Think of it like a lighthouse. It doesn’t chase ships; it simply shines. A strong personal brand guides opportunities your way, signaling who you are, what you value, and what you bring to the table. You become a beacon of trust and identity in a sea of generalists.

Top Benefits of a Strong Personal Brand

1. Trust and Credibility

People do business with those they trust. A consistent and authentic personal brand builds credibility. When your values align with your actions over time, others see you as reliable, competent, and principled.

Demonstrates consistency: Your actions align with your words.

Reflects integrity: You stand for something clear and unwavering.

Fosters loyalty: People return to and recommend what they trust.

According to Edelman’s 2024 Trust Barometer, 73% of consumers will pay more for products from brands they trust—and the same principle applies to personal brands. In professional settings, Harvard Business Review research shows that trusted leaders are 2.5 times more likely to be high performers and receive promotions.

This trust becomes the foundation for leadership, influence, and referrals. Much like a favorite brand of coffee or running shoes, people will choose you again and again because they know what to expect.

2. Career and Business Opportunities

A well-defined personal brand acts like a magnet. It attracts job offers and promotions, speaking engagements and partnerships, clients and investors.

When others know your expertise, they can align you with relevant opportunities. Instead of being one more name in a pile, your brand puts you top-of-mind. LinkedIn data reveals that professionals with complete, branded profiles are 40 times more likely to receive opportunities through the platform.

Consider this: Would you rather hire a freelancer with a blank LinkedIn or someone who clearly articulates their niche, posts helpful insights, and gets endorsements from thought leaders? Your brand does the talking for you.

3. Professional Clarity and Focus

Defining your personal brand forces reflection: What do I stand for? What makes me unique? Who do I help, and how?

This process sharpens your career decisions. It becomes a filter through which you assess opportunities, partnerships, and projects. If an offer doesn’t align with your brand, you’ll know it—and avoid distractions.

A focused brand also helps you set boundaries and avoid burnout. You’re not trying to be everything to everyone. Research from the Corporate Executive Board found that professionals with clear personal brands are 50% more likely to feel satisfied with their career trajectory.

4. Visibility and Influence

In a crowded market, visibility is key. Your personal brand increases your discoverability—on LinkedIn, Google, and through word of mouth. It helps you shape the narrative around your expertise.

Whether you’re an executive or a solo creator, visibility builds social proof through followers, testimonials, and media features, searchability via SEO-friendly content and strategic keywords, and thought leadership through insights, articles, and podcasts.

5. Authentic Connections

One of the less talked-about benefits of personal branding is connection. When you’re clear about who you are, you attract people who align with your values and interests. It’s like sending out a signal that says, “These are my people.”

Authenticity isn’t just a buzzword—it’s a filter for quality relationships, mentors, collaborators, and clients. Studies show that authentic leaders have 60% higher employee engagement rates and build stronger, more resilient teams.

Real-World Examples: The Power of Strategic Personal Branding

The Executive: Satya Nadella’s Transformation

When Satya Nadella became CEO of Microsoft in 2014, he didn’t just change the company—he strategically rebuilt his personal brand from “operations executor” to “empathetic innovator.” His consistent messaging around growth mindset, inclusion, and collaborative leadership helped transform Microsoft’s culture and market perception. Under his leadership, Microsoft’s market value increased from $300 billion to over $3 trillion, partly due to stakeholder trust in his vision and character.

The Consultant: Annie Duke’s Niche Mastery

Former professional poker player Annie Duke leveraged her unique background to build a personal brand around decision-making under uncertainty. Rather than staying in poker, she translated her expertise into corporate consulting, writing bestselling books like “Thinking in Bets,” and becoming a sought-after speaker. Her brand positioning—”the poker player who teaches better business decisions”—made her instantly memorable and allowed her to command premium rates in an oversaturated consulting market.

The Creator: Ali Abdaal’s Educational Empire

Ali Abdaal, a doctor turned YouTuber, built his personal brand around “evidence-based productivity.” His consistency in sharing study techniques, productivity systems, and life optimization strategies attracted over 5 million subscribers and enabled him to launch multiple revenue streams—from online courses generating millions annually to a successful newsletter and book deals. His medical background gave credibility to his advice, differentiating him from other productivity gurus.

The Corporate Professional: Morning Brew’s Alex Lieberman

Alex Lieberman co-founded Morning Brew while still in college, but his personal brand extended far beyond the company. By sharing transparent insights about entrepreneurship, failures, and mental health on LinkedIn and Twitter, he built a following of 500,000+ professionals. When Morning Brew was acquired for $75 million, his personal brand helped him transition into investing and advising, with opportunities flowing directly from his reputation for authentic leadership.

The Bottom Line

A strong personal brand isn’t vanity—it’s strategy. It attracts the right opportunities, builds authentic connections, clarifies your professional path, and establishes trust and credibility.

Your brand tells your story before you even enter the room. It’s your shortcut to relevance, resonance, and recognition. In an increasingly competitive and digital world, those who are intentional about their personal brand don’t just survive—they thrive.

The question isn’t whether you have a personal brand—you do. The question is whether you’re building it on purpose or by accident.

🧼QuestionStrings to Practice

QuestionStrings are deliberately ordered sequences of questions in which each answer fuels the next, creating a compounding ladder of insight that drives progressively deeper understanding.

🔍 Clarity String: “What do I want to be known for?” →

“Who do I want to serve?” →

“What value do I offer that’s hard to ignore?”

Try weaving this into your journaling or strategy sessions. It can help distill your brand into something clear and actionable.

A well-crafted personal brand can do the heavy lifting when you’re not in the room. It’s not just about being known—it’s about being known for something meaningful.",1,1754663011.0,QuestionClass,0,1.0,False

I'm very excited to share a little project I've been working on, Graffity Falls, an interactive world map where we collect and showcase Gravity Falls inspired graffiti and fan art spotted in the real world!

The idea is simple: I’ve always loved Gravity Falls, and I’ve noticed a few graffiti pieces inspired by it in my country (Uruguay, Unfortunately, last year a beautiful graffiti of Mabel and Waddles was lost when an old wall was torn down to make way for a new building.). I thought, why not build a space where fans from all over the world can share the ones they find too?

The project is just starting, and I’d love for the community to help it grow. Whether it’s a small doodle in a bathroom stall or a giant mural, if it has Gravity Falls vibes, it belongs on the map!

In the future, I’d love to add a leaderboard to highlight the top contributors who’ve helped by submitting graffiti.

I truly appreciate every contribution!

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and enjoyment of chocolate spoons depend on several key features that differentiate a truly exceptional product from a disappointing one. Consider these elements when selecting the best chocolate spoons for your needs.

**Chocolate quality:** The foundation of any great chocolate spoon is the chocolate itself. Look for spoons made with high-quality chocolate, preferably with a clear indication of the cacao percentage. Higher cacao percentages typically mean a richer, more intense chocolate flavor. Check the ingredient list for real cocoa butter and avoid spoons with excessive amounts of vegetable oils or artificial flavorings.

the type of chocolate also matters. Choices typically range from milk chocolate (sweeter and creamier) to dark chocolate (more bitter and complex) and white chocolate (sweet and buttery). The best choice depends entirely on your personal preference and intended use.

**spoon Design and Durability:** A well-designed chocolate spoon should be both aesthetically pleasing and functional. The shape should allow for easy stirring without snapping or breaking prematurely. The thickness of the spoon is crucial; it needs to be thick enough to withstand stirring but melt smoothly into the hot beverage.

Pay attention to the edges of the spoon. Are they smooth and well-finished? Rough or poorly molded edges can detract from the overall experience. A sturdy and thoughtfully designed spoon contributes to a more enjoyable melting process.

**Flavor Infusions and Extras:** While pure chocolate spoons are delightful, some manufacturers offer enhanced flavors to add more complexity. Consider spoons infused with peppermint, caramel, coffee, or even chili for a spicy kick. These additions can transform your drink into a unique and sophisticated flavor profile.

If you enjoy added textures, look for spoons with inclusions like nuts, sprinkles, or candied pieces. These additions provide an engaging contrast to the smooth melting chocolate. Ensure that any additional ingredients are of comparable quality as the base chocolate.**Packaging and Presentation:** The packaging plays a significant role, especially if you plan to give chocolate spoons as a gift. Look for attractive and protective packaging that prevents damage during shipping. Individual wrapping ensures freshness and allows for easy portion control.

Consider the overall presentation. Do the spoons come in an appealing box or container? Is the packaging designed to keep the chocolate at an even temperature during transit and storage? premium packaging elevates the gifting experience and reflects the quality of the product.

**Ethical Sourcing:** for conscious consumers, ethical sourcing is an significant consideration. Look for chocolate spoons made with fairly traded or sustainably sourced cocoa.Certifications like Fairtrade or Rainforest Alliance indicate that the chocolate was produced in a manner that respects workers' rights and protects the environment.Clarity is key. Manufacturers should be willing to provide clear information about their sourcing practices. Supporting ethical brands not only benefits cocoa farmers but also aligns your purchase with your values.

## Core Benefits

Chocolate spoons offer distinct advantages compared to simply adding chocolate chips or powder to a hot beverage.These benefits encompass the sensory experience, convenience, and overall indulgence.

**Enhanced Flavor Delivery:** Chocolate spoons provide a more controlled and gradual release of chocolate flavor than customary methods.Instead of dissolving quickly, they melt slowly as you stir, allowing the chocolate to fully infuse the drink. This creates a richer, more balanced flavor profile, preventing pockets of undissolved chocolate at the bottom of your cup.

The gradual melting process allows you to taste the chocolate evolve as it mixes with the beverage, offering a nuanced sensory experience. Each sip becomes a delightful exploration of flavor and texture.

**Simplified preparation:** Chocolate spoons eliminate the need for measuring and scooping chocolate powder or chips. Simply grab a spoon,stir it into your hot beverage,and enjoy as it melts. This streamlined process saves time and effort, making it perfect for busy mornings or fast indulgences.

The convenience of chocolate spoons makes them an ideal solution for single servings. No need to open a large bag of chocolate chips or worry about stale powder. Each spoon is perfectly portioned and ready to use, resulting in less waste and greater efficiency.

**Elevated Sensory Experience:** The act of stirring a chocolate spoon creates a uniquely luxurious sensation.Watching the chocolate slowly melt and swirl into the drink stimulates the senses and adds a touch of elegance to your everyday routine. It’s more than just a drink; it’s an experience.

The gradual release of chocolate aroma further enhances the sensory experience. As the chocolate melts, it releases its rich fragrance, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. This makes drinking a cup of hot chocolate or coffee with a chocolate spoon a truly pleasurable ritual.

**Perfect for Gifting:** Chocolate spoons make thoughtful and charming gifts for friends, family, or colleagues. Their novelty and indulgence factor makes them a welcome treat for any occasion. They can be especially appreciated during the colder months or holiday periods.

Their attractive packaging and unique appeal make them an ideal alternative to traditional chocolate boxes. They present a more personalized and memorable gift that shows you put thought and care into selecting the perfect treat.

## FAQs Section

**How long do chocolate spoons typically take to melt fully?**
The melting time varies based on the temperature of the beverage and the size of the spoon. In a hot cup of coffee or hot chocolate, a standard chocolate spoon should melt fully within 1-2 minutes with gentle stirring. For cooler beverages, it may take slightly longer.

**Can chocolate spoons be used in cold drinks?**
While primarily designed for hot drinks, chocolate spoons can be used in cold beverages like iced coffee or milk, even though melting will be substantially slower. The chocolate will still eventually dissolve, imparting its flavor, but you'll need to stir for a longer period or break the spoon into smaller pieces for faster dissolving.

**What is the best way to store chocolate spoons to maintain their freshness?**
Store chocolate spoons in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight or heat sources. Ideally, keep them in an airtight container to prevent absorption of moisture and odors. Refrigeration is generally not recommended unless the spoons contain perishable inclusions like fresh fruit, as it can cause condensation and affect the chocolate's texture.

**Are chocolate spoons suitable for individuals with dairy allergies?**
Many chocolate spoons contain dairy products, primarily in the form of milk chocolate or white chocolate. Individuals with dairy allergies should carefully check the ingredient list before consuming. Look for dark chocolate spoons made with dairy-free ingredients or specifically labeled as ""vegan"" to ensure they are free from milk products.

Short Story: The False Promise

Layla sat by the window of a small, dimly lit café. A cold cup of coffee rested untouched before her. Her eyes, full of anticipation and silent pain, remained fixed on the screen of her phone. She had been waiting.

When Maher finally walked in, he carried himself with false confidence. He smiled casually and sat across from her as if nothing had happened.

Layla looked up at him, her voice calm yet laced with restrained anger.
""You’re not late to the meeting, Maher. You’re late to the truth.""

Maher blinked, pretending to be confused. ""What truth are you talking about, Layla?""

She stared at him, her eyes heavy with disappointment.
""The truth you once promised me. You said you would support me. You told me the money was ready, that you didn’t need any guarantees because you trusted me. You swore by God — again and again — and then what? You disappeared. You stalled, made excuses, and now you come back like nothing happened?""

He leaned back, forcing a relaxed posture, and replied, ""You’re exaggerating. It was just the circumstances. Ramadan, then Eid, the kids… things got busy.""

Layla’s voice sharpened. ""Don’t talk to me about circumstances. Circumstances don’t stop a man from apologizing when he breaks a promise. They don’t make him ignore messages or avoid someone who trusted him. They don’t allow him to celebrate Eid while someone else cries in silence. Do you even know what you did to me?
You killed my hope.
You stole my time.
You shut the doors I could’ve knocked on if only you had been honest from the start.""

Maher shifted uncomfortably. He attempted a half-smile. ""I never meant to hurt you. I was going to—""

""You were going to what?"" she interrupted, her voice steady despite the tears forming in her eyes.
""Deceive me with a pretty lie? Pretend to be a savior then vanish like I meant nothing? I am not a waiting room in your life. I am not a page you turn whenever you please.""

Layla stood up. She looked at him one last time — not with hatred, but with the sadness of someone who had finally let go. She picked up her bag and walked away, her steps firm and final.

For the first time, Maher felt the weight of his actions. He realized he had lost a kind, genuine woman who had trusted him deeply. She had been a sister, a friend, a loyal soul who had never wronged him — yet he had hurt her, lied to her, and played with her trust. He remembered the opportunity she had told him about — one that could have changed her life — and how she had begged him not to let the deadline pass without including her name.
Still, he found excuses to avoid helping, simply because he never truly intended to support her. It was just a small amount of money, but to her, it meant everything.

And so, instead of taking responsibility, he brushed off his hands and smiled — a cold, indifferent smile.

Layla exited the park where the café stood. A single tear slipped down her cheek despite her efforts to hold it back. She wiped it away, lifted her head with quiet dignity, and whispered to herself:

> ""Some promises are like false rain — thunderous in sound, but my land remains dry.""
A promise is like thunder.
Fulfillment is like the rain.
There is no good in a friend who betrays his companion
And comes with coldness after closeness.
Peace be upon this world...
