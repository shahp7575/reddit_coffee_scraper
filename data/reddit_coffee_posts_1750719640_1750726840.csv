Hello folks! Your resident performance obsessed Redditor here, with my updated Pagespeed guide! It's gone through significant revisions since the last time I posted it. It has grown another 16 pages, up from 368 to over 383+ (and growing!) pages of content. It's officially hit full on novel length!

Major content additions, expansions on everything that was previously in the guide, significantly better and more logical organization, revamped table of contents, grammar and spelling fixes, many new optimization strategies and much needed additional specificity.

**[Don’t forget to check the table of contents, it is not expanded by default! The icon is on the top left side on desktop](https://imgur.com/a/GjsPhfo)**

Included is a breakdown on how to analyze and interpret Speed Test reports to identify optimization opportunities.

Wordpress specific optimizations: It has sections on how to optimize common features including Ads, Forms, Woocommerce, Analytics, Google Maps, Custom Fields, Galleries, Video Players, Sliders, Filters, SEO plugins, Anti-Spam, Cookie Notices, Backup plugins; in addition to one size fits all optimizations(Images, Videos, CDN, SSL, CSS, JS, Resource Hints, Fonts, Caching, HTML Document size, DOM optimization, etc), and tons and tons more.

There's an extensive amount of optimization information and resources for server stack configuration for NGINX, Apache, OpenLiteSpeed, Varnish, Object Caching, PHP, HAProxy, MySQL, SSL, Gzip/Brotli, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, Security considerations effects on performance and Linux optimizations. There are also a bunch of resources on database optimization.

Every optimization opportunity has a free plugin option (or multiple) listed. Some paid plugins are included as I find them very useful(Perfmatters and Asset Cleanup Pro for example). However I've included alternatives for all paid options. Every single thing in my guide can be implemented for free. 

I've done my best to cover all of the bases you’d find in any page speed guide, in addition to a focus on adding uncommon optimization strategies and solutions that you won’t find in any off the shelf guide. This is a compilation of all of my research over the last 6 years delving into performance optimization.

I'm confident that if you follow every single step in the guide, almost any site you maintain can score 90+ on a Pagespeed Insights Mobile Speed Test. 

If you notice anything missing from my performance guide that you think I should add, or if there is some information you believe needs to be amended (or expanded on), please let me know in the comments and I'll be sure to add a section or revise the content on the topic (if necessary) as soon as possible!

If you feel that the guide is too overwhelming and you'd prefer to have someone else optimize your site’s performance or need a consultation, feel free to DM me.

If anyone wants to be able to import a large set of free optimization plugins (and you can selectively choose which ones to download/install), download WP Favs. I do need to update the collection since I've added tons to the guide since the last time I posted this, but it's still comprehensive:

https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpfavs/

The code to import them is: JAuOGP5BZICR5LmBsPANN9kpKHfiie

The most recent additions to the guide have been: Refinements throughout the guide, grammatical fixes, and more concise explanations.

1lixnw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lixnw4/i_25f_need_help_processing_what_happened_last/,I [25F] need help processing what happened last night at this seemingly casual reunion with friends [25F] [26M] [76M].,"I've been in a LDR for more than 6 years and will be moving to my partner's country in over a month. This year I met someone with whom I have friends in common; he (let's call him ""S"" [26M]) thought I was cool to talk to, got my number, chatted occasionally and invited me out on friendly plans. He then started texting me daily and I enjoyed it way too much, which gave me a huge sense of guilt in spite of knowing my limits and never letting conversations or actions go to compromising levels. 

One day, we ran into each other at a mall (he somehow finds me everywhere but I think it's because my city is rather small). He invited me for a coffee, I accepted. Then a peculiar friend of his joined us (a german old man, let's call him ""C"" [76M]), it was quite a weird experience but I enjoyed most of it except for the parts in which C talked about sex, freedom in love, open relationships and suggested for me to get more than one boyfriend (I don't even feel comfortable talking about that with close friends). For the record, S had to translate everything C said to me because C does not speak my language.

Last friday I went out with my best friend (Let's call her ""K"" [25F]). I wanted us to go to a play we had planned to see together and then drink some alcohol and talk about life, my worries about moving out and also my mixed feelings about S. Once we went out of the play she suddenly said ""S is in this place, let's go there"". I did not have the courage to say no so I let her drag me. Once there we continued drinking but I got upset and tired so I did not participate much in the conversation. By the end of the night, S said something completely out of the blue that got me very weirded out and made me feel incredibly vulnerable. He said to me ""I still cannot believe you didnt realize that throughout the whole night C was telling us you and I should go fuck"". I looked at him and could only say ""how did you want me to know? He speaks german"". The way he said it though, so lightly and almost as if it was a joke. It felt very insulting.

Last Saturday. Although I was feeling very uncomfortable in S presence, we had scheduled a dinner at C's house months ago and even before I met him. I was hesitant about going but I decided to fulfill my commitment.

At the beginning of the dinner, everything was fine. Calm. Normal. We arrived and C showed us his house and his art (he is dedicated to painting and sculpting). Then we had dinner, talked for a while and started drinking.

Later, C brought out his guitar and started playing. He told me to sing, to raise my voice and stop being so introverted (which I am, I know). I began to feel that he had developed a fixation on me. I became especially aware of this when K said something like ""tell this to C"" and I replied, ""why don't you tell him yourself?"" And she responded, ""because he's obsessed with you."" This made me feel a mix of discomfort, pride, and vanity. I usually don’t seek to be the center of interest, and even less so from a 76-year-old man; however, receiving all that attention was flattering.

After the guitar session, C began to have a lot of physical contact with me. I HATE unnecessary physical contact; I am not someone who hugs, kisses, or even simply touches other people unless they are my partner. C touched my arm, saying I was very skinny (he even asked my weight), took my hand, compared it to his, and told me he liked it and he also put one of his rings on my finger. It seemed like he wanted to have physical contact with me at every opportunity.

Then, K thought it would be a good idea to tell C (when he started talking about religion) that I was extremely Catholic and got offended when people said God didn’t exist (which is not true). After this, C’s fixation on me increased, and he started saying things like, ""but why do you believe that?"" ""You are very intelligent; you are capable of thinking, think!"". They kept teasing me about religion, and I felt a bit uncomfortable again because C was too insistent on me.

Anyway, C talked about Muslims, then his dislike for beards and finally, he somehow connected it all to the topic of male and female hormones, and therefore, delved into the topic of genitals, which made me extremely uncomfortable (but made K and S laugh). So when he made very explicit comments, I would cover my face with a pillow. When he noticed this, C would take the pillow away and say, ""but this is normal; you are a woman, you have a v*gina. He is a man (pointing to S), he has a p*nis.""

Then came the part that made me the most uncomfortable. C asked S something in German, and S laughed a lot and said he wouldn’t translate it. After insisting, S said: ""Okay, I will translate what he asked me but not my answer, with the condition that you (meaning me) won’t feel uncomfortable."" I told him that I was already feeling uncomfortable, so it probably wouldn’t make a difference. Unfortunately, it did make a difference. What C asked was, ""S, which of the two (K or me) would you like to sleep with?"" Once he said that, I felt my stomach twist. Obviously, it seemed inappropriate, but I felt even worse thinking that S DID ANSWER HIM. That left me very perplexed, and intrigued about not knowing whom he had chosen. A part of me wanted it to have been me; I suppose it was because of ego and the feeling of being desired. Another part of me tried not to dwell on it (but I did dwell on it a lot).

After that, we went down from the terrace. C invited me to go down before everyone else and did so with a bow, as if I were royalty. He extended his hand to me, and I hesitated for a second whether to take it or not. He insisted, I took it, he squeezed it hard, and dragged me toward where he was going. It seemed like he only had eyes for me, and K and S noticed, so they decided to take the dishes and things from the terrace to the kitchen while C showed me his paintings all over the house. He tried to explain them to me in very basic Spanish (my native language), asked me what I thought of them, guided me to the next piece he wanted to show me by taking me by the shoulders and brusquely steering me, and sought my eye contact. Since S and K left me alone, I felt very vulnerable and even became afraid that this man might try to do something to me. He didn’t, fortunately. His house has four floors, so it was a very long tour.

At one point, I had a strange feeling. I thought: what are K and S doing alone in the kitchen? Was this C’s plan because S’s answer to his question had been ""K""? This unsettled me and caused a feeling of jealousy, which I know is unfounded since I have nothing with S and don’t want to. Maybe it was the thought that I was not his center of attention. How stupid of me, right?

Anyway. C took me to the first floor, his workshop. After this, K and S joined us again. C asked me if I painted, and I told him no, so he kept insisting that I try new things, express myself, and stop being so introverted (I feel this perception came from the way I reacted to uncomfortable comments, I suppose). He gifter me two of his paintings and finally, I sat down in his workshop and started to fall asleep in the chair. That marked the time to leave. K ordered an Uber that arrived very quickly. I tried to order one to my house, but it took an eternity. When K got in the car and left, it was just S, C, and me at the door (standing in that order too). That was when C said, ""You are going to leave with S, right? You are going together, right? You are going to be together tonight?"" And as he said this, he took me by the arm and brusquely tried to push me toward S. I repeatedly told him no and tried to pull away.

Since I couldn't get an Uber, S said I should go with him in his taxi, that they would take me home first and then he would go to his house. I accepted. I was very sleepy and drunk. C took me by the arm again and then roughly dragged me to another area of his porch to wait for the taxi. S was far away, and at that moment, C asked me, ""Are you and S going to have sex tonight?"" I told him no; he insisted on asking why; I just replied no, visibly uncomfortable. Then he asked, ""Don't you like him?"" And I told him no, even though, deep down, I won’t deny it, I am physically and intellectually attracted to him, and in an alternate reality, under different conditions and contexts, I would have liked the freedom to spend the night with him. That is just a thought (which confuses me even more and makes me feel very guilty); I would NEVER act on it. I do not intend to make that mistake.

The taxi arrived, we said goodbye, and left. S and I didn't talk much during the ride. Suddenly, I remembered all the times I've been minimized or violated in my life, which gave me the motivation to talk about my boundaries. On the way, I said to S, ""Can I ask you something?"" He said, ""Of course, tell me."" ""Why did you decide to tell me yesterday at the bar and in front of K what you hadn’t wanted to translate from C last Saturday?"". ""I don't know, I had no specific reason, it just occurred to me. Honestly, I don’t know why C started saying those things; he had never been like that with those topics. I know I can't apologize for him, but I apologize anyway"". ""I understand; however, it seemed a bit unnecessary for you to tell me anyway"". ""Did you feel uncomfortable?"". ""A lot."" ""I'm sorry. I want you to know that those are not my intentions with you"". ""It's okay; you don't have to apologize for him because you are you, and he is he. However, even though he is from a different culture and of advanced age, that doesn’t lessen the discomfort he made me feel and that I also felt when you translated what he said the other day in such an unnecessary way."" ""I'm sorry. I just thought about saying it. Also, I was very drunk since I started drinking at 2 p.m. yesterday. But I want you to know that those are not my intentions with you"". ""It's okay, thanks,"" I finally responded. I got out of the car and arrived home. After all that, he mostly sent me unrelated text messages and also said ""thank you for being brave enough to confront me and telling me all that yesterday"".

1lixnkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1lixnkn/update_my_ex_went_to_jail/,UPDATE!!!!! MY EX WENT TO JAIL,"So… remember when I posted about how my *ex boyfriend* was getting **PAID** by my *best friend* to date me? (Hi again, Charlett, if you see this  I still love you and this part is even messier ) Buckle up, because this just took a hard left into “this can’t be real life” territory.

Jake  the ex who pretended to love me for money  is now *in jail*. Like *actual jail*. Orange jumpsuit. Mugshot. I couldn’t make this up if I tried.

Here’s how it went down:

A couple days after everything blew up, I was still deep in my heartbreak/don’t trust anyone era when a mutual friend (bless her nosy heart) sent me a link to a local *police blotter* post. And there it was. Jake’s name. His face. Under the headline “Local Man Arrested for Fraud and Identity Theft.”

EXCUSE ME???

Apparently, Jake didn’t just fake a relationship. He’s been living a *double life*. The man had multiple aliases, fake accounts, and  get this  was *scamming women online for money*. And I’m not talking about basic catfishing. He was posing as different guys, building relationships with women, then asking for “help” with rent, cars, sick family members, etc. Classic scammer behavior.

Turns out, he used MY relationship as a cover. While dating me and pretending to be some dream boyfriend (thanks to the money my “bestie” M was slipping him), he was running all these other side scams behind the scenes.

And get this  when the police searched his stuff, they found *screenshots* and *notes* about me. Like, a literal script. Talking points. “Ask about her dad here.” “Bring up her favorite coffee order.” It’s like I was a freaking role he was playing.

The worst part? M still tried to defend him. She messaged me saying, “This isn’t the guy I knew. He must’ve changed.” GIRL. He didn’t change  you just didn’t know him. Or worse… you didn’t care.

So yeah. Jake is in jail. There’s an ongoing investigation, and apparently more women are coming forward. I’ve already been contacted by someone who thinks they were also being played by him while we were together. I’m honestly *numb* at this point.

What started as a horrible breakup turned into a full on crime show. And the betrayal from my best friend still stings the most.

I’m doing better now, though. I cut off M, blocked everyone who tried to gaslight me about it, and I’m currently in my “wine and self respect” era.

To anyone going through something similar: trust your gut. If something feels off, it probably is. And if your friend says they’re “helping” you in weird ways? Ask questions.

Anyway, thanks for the support on the first post. You guys made me feel way less alone. If anything else wild happens… I’ll probably be back ",5,1750726313.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False

I've already put the deposit down and everything will be signed and finalized soon. The dealership is asking if I want this additional package for around $995. Does any of this actually do anything? Does the dealership even put anything on the car's exterior and interior to protect it, or do they just take my money and laugh at me in the break room? 

(Oh, and the $995 also includes tangible things that I know are real, like rubber floor mats and 35% window tinting of the windshield and front driver/passenger windows. Those I'm not worried about. It's the other stuff that kinda feels like bullshit to me.)

  
Here's what the flier says verbatim:

EXTERIOR PAINT SEALANT: Protects against corrosion of all chrome and painted surfaces, paint fading, oxidation, discoloration and environmental hazards such as tree sap, pollen, acid rain, bug, or bird droppings and industrial pollution. 

INTERIOR PROTECTION: Prevents stains from coffee, soft drinks, baby mishaps, mud, grease, and oil. Penetrates pores with an invisible layer without altering the appearance of the interior. Also protects against deterioration, fading, cracking, and discoloration. 

UNDERCOAT/SOUND SHIELD: Protects the undercarriage of your vehicle against the elements such as liquid salt along with little rocks and debris that are kicked up as you drive. Over time those elements wear down and degrade the undercarriage. It also helps cut down on the amount of road noise heard coming up from the bottom of the vehicle. With undercoat on the undercarriage, it acts as a sound dampening/deadening material.

1lixihs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jerseycity/comments/1lixihs/jury_duty_and_a_circadian_rhythm_disorder_advice/,Jury duty and a circadian rhythm disorder. Advice where to get prove,"Hello everyone. I received a summon for jury duty and already filled it out the questionnaire online last night. I wish I can serve, but unfortunately, I have a disorder that will affect my ability to stay focus and to think clearly. In part, due to my work schedule, I go to bed at 6AM and fall as sleep at 7AM and wake up at 2:30 PM. I eat ""breakfast"" at 3PM, I eat ""lunch at 7PM"", I eat dinner at 1AM, and cycle repeats. Even during my only day off I follow the same eating and sleeping schedules. I have tried to, at least go to bed a little earlier but I can't fall as sleep. For example, one day I had an appointment at 10 AM for my car mechanic, and the night before I went to bed much earlier at 3AM to sleep at least 6 hours, but ended up falling as sleep at 6AM and ended up sleeping just 3 hours. My circadian rhythm is so severe that even during my one week vacation I follow the same schedule. Ready for this? Last year I flew to a different place, and I was tired, so in the hotel, (and I was by myself) I went to bed at 12AM (at night), so it was significantly earlier that what am used to sleep. I thought that I was gonna fall as sleep and had a better vacation experience. Hours passed and couldn't fall as sleep. Guess what: at about 6 AM fell as sleep and woke up at 2PM. Then after that, even if I go to bed at 4AM, I always ended up falling as sleep at 6 or 6:30 in the morning. I would need like at least 2 months to adjust.

I need to give prove of my condition in the court just in case they asked me for papers. I need to go to a doctor in the area, in Union City area, or The Heights area. I found in Google Maps a doctor on Pavonia, and I would like to hear your opinion if am choosing the right doctor. The reason for the doctors visit is not to sleep earlier, (I work nights; not all night, but I go home at 1AM and at that time I eat dinner, and needs to wait until my digestion finish. Even if I don't eat dinner, would not be able to fall as sleep earlier. Also, I don't have the time in my job to eat dinner, just lunch (a snack), so I have to eat dinner when I come from work).

Any doctor to visit? Maybe the one on Pavonia ? I don't have any primary doctor because am healthy and I rarely get sick. Also, any advice what to say to the doctor, (beside telling him all these) so he can give prove of my disorder? 

If I have to go to jury duty, that would mean that am ""only"" going to sleep 0 hours. Zero, absolutely no sleep. Not even an hour of sleep. I would probably fall as sleep in the chair, or not thinking clearly because of lack of sleep. (I can't drink coffee because of caffeine, hearts irregular beeps, headache, (maybe that's caffeine allergy). I wish that the courts have a second shift for people who can't sleep nights.

We are a bit more of a situationship/nesting partners than a true relationship due to some preferences and life things. 

Lately we seem to be struggling with communication and jealousy. 

I (41F) am always open if I am going to hang out with another person, have sex with someone, etc. I give an idea of when I'm going out and roughly when I'll be back as he (42M) takes care of both of our dogs and I try to do things on opposite schedule as him so that the dogs needs are met. 

I started hanging out with a guy my primary knows from groups. We went for coffee once and then hung out and made OF content together as my primary doesn't want to be on OF. He's been super encouraging one minute and then shut off and clearly jealous the next. When I made my first video I was really excited to show him because it was a huge thing for me and he told me he didn't think he could watch it due to feeling jealous, then later in an argument told me he didn't want to see it cause he thought I was purposely trying to make him jealous.

Now hes been talking to someone from Fet and Im pretty sure they are hanging out or more. I am getting half details like ""i won't be home for dinner"" and then hes gone all day and night. 

I've tried telling him that I need him to communicate better with me about dates as its making me feel like im the only one holding up our agreement of ""tell me what's going on and wear a condom if you have sex"". 

Today hes gone out again and only told me he was going to not be home for dinner, I asked if he was going to be late and he said yes. A little while later I asked if he was going to be gone all day as one of the dogs had not been feeling well and that was when he told me he would be gone all day and well into the night. I also just found out he got picked up and didn't take his truck, which only worries me if the dog that has been sick needs to go to the vet I wont be able to call him to come home if I need help.

I dont know how to approach this anymore, let alone process my own feelings. I feel so angry but then think this is also what I agreed to, even if its not 100% being done on his end.

I always thought we were good at this, that we had pretty strong communication, but it just seems to not be so. He blames the communication issues on both of us but I feel like its him not communicating.

1lixhxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/goodmythicalmorning/comments/1lixhxn/inauthentic_overly_commercialized/,Inauthentic & Overly Commercialized,"**Where are the boys from Buies Creek?** 

I used to watch R&L every single day without fail. It was the show I turned on first thing every day when the t.v. was switched on. I've been a long time viewer from the tiny desk, commercial making days. I own books and merch, I mean I'm have been a fan. I loved the genuine nature of the fellas. I can still see it in Link more so than Rhett, but something has changed. 

Sure would love to have a kind and open conversation, because as someone who does like R&L I'm simply trying to express the change I see. 

Somewhere along the way a shift came, first with Rhett and his deconstruction, of which Link followed suit. They have pressed down hard on this, Rhett especially, which leads me to believe that he really isn't sure. He wants us to believe he's certain about it all, consistently making content in the form of podcasts and music to tell us his feelings and express to the viewership his deepest emotions. 

To me Rhett has always been the leader in the friendship. I don't believe that Link would have left the faith had Rhett not lead him toward it. I'm sorry that they had such a terrible religious experience that it has caused them to disavow all things religious. Honestly, it disappoints me to see Rhett go so hard on this topic. If it's what he believes, deep down in his heart of hearts, then he doesn't need to justify his feelings constantly. 

Rhett is seeking approval, that he will never find. 

Much of the religious fanbase that began watching them at the start of GMM have now been ostracized. We can't dislike that the fellas have become so liberal in their beliefs and practices that it causes some us to feel we can't relate to them anymore. What made R&L special to me was their genuine country by friendship that built them into something more than brothers could ever be. They had kids, loved their wives and seemed to have a value system. 

Now it's no holds barred, anything goes, sexual innuendos and adult humor that is many times distasteful. I've never paid to watch one GME, because of the previews I glimpsed. It's all about being drunk and everything sex and crude humor. Why? 

Is it not possible to be comedians and insight laughter and amusement without faking like your sucking a d$#@ What is wrong with the writers and how far gone are R&L as good old country boys with down homes roots and love for wholesome things? Rhett is the culprit in the demise of their value system. Mark my words, the show will end, because of the liberlistic shenanigan's they show. I won't allow my son to watch them and I'm finally done. I sure don't want it to be this way. I tried to encourage them to show us more of ""them."" Their trip home was wonderful. The R&L channel I like far more than GMM. 

Both R&L come across as inauthentic, merchandise hockers and ad revenue seekers. They're overly commercialized and have left the common person in the dust. If Link had any guts or backbone he'd tell Rhett no when it comes to hocking every sweatshirt, pen, sticker and coffee cup they can come up with. All of which is just more trash for the landfill and more consumerism. 

Rhett and Link try to play off as this clean living, health conscious set of gentlemen, all the while wasting enormous amounts of food and making products that are nothing more than vanity pieces. I don't care how much they say they ""donate"" to the food bank, it does not offset the waste. All the packaging they waste alone is enough to be a tremendous burden upon landfills. 

Personally, I just want to see them return to some humility, original, non-food related content and hush their mouths when it comes to sexual innuendos. If they don't have religious values, they don't have to have them, but what's the point in shoving it down people's throats? Believe what you want to believe and keep being the clowns of the world. We all need laughter and humor, what we really do not need is another celebrity standing on a soap box and trying to change our minds about the world. 

Until R&L can edit themselves and get back to who they were there will be no place for them any longer in my life. I know I'm not the only one who feels this way. I wish I didn't. I wish I could say, ""man Rhett and Link are two of the best fellas that ever made it big, they are the genuine article."" But to me, they've allowed Stevie to get too far ahead in her leadership role. I have seen Link become frustrated with her asking in the past ""are you the host or am I"" and ""would you like to sit here?"" He feels the aggravation of her trying to take on a bigger role, but I guarantee you this, Rhett stands up for her and now Link ""loves lesbains."" 

It's all too much. They're propagandist for the liberals and deny that L.A. has changed them when it's written all over their bodies and their merchandise.

1lixgw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Belize/comments/1lixgw8/driver_recommendation/,Driver Recommendation,"Im yet another happy customer of Oscar the private driver. Thanks to everyone on Reddit who recommended him!

He drove us from Belize City to Placencia and again from Placencia into San Ignacio. His quoted rates were a bit higher than I had anticipated but considering the tremendous additional value he provided, I think the prices were reasonable. Though not technically a tour guide, he is a lot more than just a driver.

Along our journeys, Oscar took us to a roadside stand for bbq, to Saint Herman's cave, to the Belize zoo, to cocoa tasting, to Billy Barquedier National Park for a short hike to a waterfall, and for ice cream! He offered even more stops, including coffee tasting and swimming in a cenote, but we ran out of time and daylight! He also took us to a grocery store for snacks and ATMs when we needed cash (and suggested which ones would have lower international fees). He had countless food suggestions and cultural spots to hit up. 

Oscar was very communicative and always on time. We rode in two of his cars - a minivan and an SUV. Both were older cars but totally comfortable.

Oscar said he may have a website coming soon, but for now you can contact him on Whatsapp - 501 613 6030",2,1750725777.0,Belize,1,1.0,False

1lixe1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/comments/1lixe1t/mesh_router_causing_significant_delay_over_works/,Mesh router causing significant delay over work's VPN?,"tl;dr downloading or uploading across my work VPN is slow **at home only** and I wonder if it's my router.

I WFH and connect over a VPN. I have a TP-Link Deco 6E AXE5300 system. The primary device is on the main level and I have a secondary device downstairs in the office. I can connect to it wired or use wi-fi and my issue persists.

I pay for 600/25 and speedtests both on and off the VPN average 400/18 with ping in the 20s. Solid enough. Plus I have a personal PC for gaming in the same room also on wi-fi and it works just fine, as do other connected devices in the home, streaming, etc.

Doing anything on the work network is >stupidly< slow. The worst example is just opening the file browser. It takes at minimum 5 seconds to load all the subfolders in any folder. I just counted it taking 4 seconds to open a 28kb CSV in Excel and 9 seconds to save it. Takes about 9 seconds to open a 1mb Excel doc.

I have a secondary method to connect to work, via a Citrix remote connection. The issue doesn't occur with this.

So anything where I'm pulling significant amounts of data from work specifically on the VPN just sucks. It's been a year and I'm only getting more irritated with this.

However, at the library or any of a dozen coffee shops I've ever worked at? Nearly as fast as being on-site. Even airport wi-fi is faster. Yes, the freaking file browser never has to load.

I've asked my IT for help and they can't suggest anything. Given that it only happens at my home, it doesn't surprise me that they don't have any suggestions. I think it's on my end.

I'm probably going to pick up some mid-range router and swap it in just as a test. I kind of want to get rid of this TP-Link set anyways due to the security concerns re: China.

So this post is mainly wondering if there could be some weird mesh setting causing my issue and also a small part looking for advice for a new 6E router that would work well in a tri-level home (my issue is my home is tall, but not really that spread out).

-

     at the time we started talking, he had just moved back from a city (where he went to college and worked after college) to where he’s from originally, which is where i go to school. his job was removing his department basically and gave him and the others he worked with an opportunity to change departments or to take the severance pay, which he did and moved back home because he hated the city which he was working. so when we first started talking, he was super relaxed, had the severance pay, not much going on work/stress related. things got a bit intense once he  started applying to jobs again, and now he has a good job. he is in finance and i’m going to school to be a doctor, so completely opposite spectrums. he is saving up money at the moment and is staying with one of his parents as they have an extra room as opposed to pouring it all into rent, as he’d like to accumulate some funds before being forced into monthly payments. (so, no, none of this has to do with his income. he’s very smart financially, obviously, and as you all know, the housing market is ridiculous rn). 
-

     i have a very anxious attachment style. it gets worse at night. we are very different in a lot of ways. i have an anxious attachment style, and id bet money my boyfriend has avoidant. my last relationship prior to this (3 years) was extremely healthy, we just grew apart, and were on about of good as terms as exes can be. so, being in that relationship, really suppressed my anxious attachment style i think.
-

     as i said, my bf and i are very different. i think with my heart. im extremely idealistic and believe the best in every situation. i like to have a set plan for when i am going to see him next or about plans oriented with my friends, but at the same time am very much the type of person thats like “hey, let’s travel to europe and get hotels, we can figure out what we’re gonna do when we get there!” he is the opposite of this. likes a plan, likes to know whats going on. he likes simplicity. (i do think he has OCD, but not confirmed). i’m also the type of person that values memories and experiences more than anything. i don’t care about material goods, id rather spend my money going to a concert with the people i care about. he’s the opposite, thinking it’d better to save money or that money should be put into something with longevity, as opposed to a trip or event. 
-

      i apologize for the length of this, im just trying to give as much insight and detail as possible. 

-
      that being said, i really love him. i want to text him all the time, see him all the time. but i feel like he doesn’t act this same initial way as when we first started dating, which i heard is sort of a common thing with people with an avoidant attachment style. when i asked him about if once, he made remarks that when we first started talking, he didn’t know as much about me aside from surface level things and my looks, so he praised my looks. he said now that he knows me on such a deeper and emotional level and cares for me so much more than he did then, that he talks about other stuff. which ok. i completely understand. 
-

      just overall though, he texts less. his texts are more blunt and dry cut. 
-

     when we first had arguments, they were brutal. i thought i was being so healthy by stating what my problem or issue was or why i was upset, how it made me feel and why, and i thought i was being open and transparent. it took me a long time to figure out that was making it seem like to him that i was targeting him, so he would get extremely defensive and ball up and would be blunt with his responses, which obviously upset me more , and the situation would escalate from something that should have never been an argument into something that made me feel so physically nauseous and ill. 
-

     as of recently, we were  supposed to go on a trip for a weekend to a city about seven hours away, from Friday to Sunday, and it would be us as well as five of my other friends and their boyfriends, and he has met them all, but they’re my friends and not his. I asked him when he was a guest at a wedding and he said yes, and then we later talked about it, and he said that he probably couldn’t because his company would start the testing of their new program around that time, and he didn’t know what his work schedule would look like, and said I should go without him, which I said I didn’t want to do because I didn’t want to be the only one without my significant other there, and I know that I would feel upset and jealous, and that I probably wouldn’t have the best time. 
-

He took that as me trying to guilt trip him into it, which I was not trying to do, I was just trying to work out a situation that could accommodate for him to go, and if not that we could talk it through, but he eventually said yes, we will go because his family vacation is the week after.  
-

      fast-forward about two weeks and we are discussing about how stuff might get difficult with the fact that I am starting the hardest year yet of my schooling, taking over 30 credits, and his company is starting a new testing and he is also studying for the CPA soon, and we were talking about how we really need to communicate with each other if we want this to work out, because we both said that we have. I know it is very soon, but he has told me that he sees himself marrying me multiple times, and I know that he cares because of how many arguments we have gone through where I probably put him through the ringer because of my anxious attachment style, because I type super long paragraphs because I am trying to be clear about how I am feeling, and what I need from him, but this is the worst thing to do to an avoidant attachment style person. 
-

      He basically told me he was super anxious about the trip and he’s now not going, which I said, I wish we had figured that out before we paid the money and it was the week before, and he brought up that I was guilt tripping him, which was not my intention, but rather just trying to be clear about my feelings and my opinion. 
-

      He also has a family vacation the following week, which he had made multiple comments about bringing me on  the months prior, saying things like “oh you’ll meet so and so when we go to my family’s house for the fourth” or “you’ll see this when we go on my family’s vacation for the 4th.” this made me feel super wanted, and included, and appreciated.  (background, he just met my parents beginning of june and i haven’t met his. i met his brother very briefly mid june) (also, his parents are divorced). for the past month, he stopped saying stuff like this about his family vacation where I was included, and would say things implying that only he was going. I brought it up and basically he said that reality kind of hit him with how soon it is coming up, and that the women in his family can be b**chy  (especially with drinks) and have not been welcoming to his exes in the past. he said that he would hate to bring me there and for then me to say why the heck would you bring me there and put me in this situation, and doesn’t want me to feel like crap.  he then said “Because I love you and would love you there to meet some people in my family and it’s a beautiful town” when I asked then why he would even bring it up in the first place. he then proceeded to say yeah come up, i was trying to protect you, so if they are mean to you or make you feel uncomfortable like you can’t blame me for it and get mad at me for it. 
-
  
      The argument was longer than this, and unfortunately was heated because again, as I said, we just keep escalating each other. 
I would’ve liked to felt like I was invited and like I had the option. 
-

      It makes me overthink like crazy, thinking that his past two exes both went on the trip  (his most recent relationship ended sometime 2022). I don’t know if they had known his dad, or some of his siblings, or anyone else in the family prior to going on the vacation, but it hurts that they were invited and I wasn’t.  
It is so easy for me to overthink and to get in my own head.  
-

      I crave reassurance so much, and I am struggling so much because of my anxious attachment style, and I don’t know what to do .  
-

       I would’ve liked to have been invited and felt like I was wanted there with him, actually asking me and letting me make the decision on my own. He told me that he thinks that I would do the best there out of all of his exes, so I still don’t understand why not invite me.  or ask me. 
-

      I want to just dump all of my emotions and fears and thoughts on him and just tell him that I need reassurance on every little thing, but I know I can’t do that because that’s the literal worst thing to do to someone with an avoidant attachment style, but at the same time I am struggling so much. 
-

      It is so easy for me to overthink so much, even though he has said to me numerous things to prove his love to me and also has done many things to prove his love to me. This post is still not giving enough insight into our life and our relationship, and is only highlighting the bads but because that’s what I need help with. so please, before everyone is rude in the comments, please understand that this is still not the entirety of the situation, and that I have feelings and that I am going through a lot, and don’t need to hear rude comments about him or about myself. I am here because, well, it’s reddit. 
to highlight some of the positives: 



- always pays for dinner, coffee, etc. i’ve paid for dunkin once and our breakfast bagels once. over the course of 8-9 months. 


-he comes to my place every weekend. 


-we cook together, he buys the groceries. 


-he picked up my online order of groceries (after waiting for them for an hour) and brought them to my place when i was sick. 


-he picked me up bc i was hammered at a school related event (im super small and hadn’t had anything to eat that day, oops) driving 35 mins to my event, picking me up with a bag for me to vomit in and a bottle of water, took me back to my place, helped me change and stayed with me all night. 


-was about to drive 2.5 hours one way to pick me up from the airport and 2.5 hours back (but luckily my flight was changed) 


-babysat my 3 cats (2 of which are kittens,) for 4 days 


he puts up with all of our fights. even though they get bad.  

-
      i’m the person who saves every animal and critter on the side of the road. he’s not that person. but we were talking about it and was saying yeah no we’re not doing that when we’re older. so i got upset. we were cleaning after dinner and he went to the bathroom and i was still putting stuff on the dishwasher, and he saw that i was still kinda upset (wine influence for sure! ) and he said “ i am going to marry you someday. listen look at me. if we are driving and we see a one legged mink of a two legged bear or a four legged cat and it has disabilities i promise we will stop and pick it up. that’s not who i am but if it makes you happy it makes me happy. because i want you to be happy. i will do anything to make you happy. if it makes you happy it makes me happy because i always want you happy. okay? i promise you “. 
so please don’t come at this situation guns a blazing. i love him. and i know he loves me. even if he doesn’t always show it in the way i want. I just need genuine opinions and help and support. you have all been in the situation where you have been struggling in a relationship, so please take that into consideration when you are commenting, because mean comments aren’t going to do anything to help me. I need genuine help and   advice. 
-

      I just hate that anytime I bring something up as a discussion that escalates into an argument. I don’t know what to do because as an anxiously attached person, all I want to do is talk about my feelings and my thoughts, and to work it out in the moment, which I know is the worst thing to do to someone who is avoidant, bombarding them only makes stuff worse.  I don’t know how we can come to a spot where we can discuss things without it escalating and where I can bring up what I am feeling and thinking and talk about how I need reassurance without him taking it personally or in a bad way, because I know he doesn’t think how I do.

1lix9vn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lix9vn/aitah_for_not_biting_the_bullet_and_saying_sorry/,AITAH for not biting the bullet and saying sorry to my dad?,"I, 24f, and my dad, 51m, have had a rocky-ish relationship for years, but last Monday was the final straw for me.

At 5:30PM, I had asked my dad if I could take my sister (14f) to the park so we both could walk the trail. I had recently given birth to a surro-babe and am trying to lose the weight, and my sister just likes to get out of the house because otherwise, she's stuck inside as my dad doesn't take them (both sisters) anywhere. 

At first, my dad said no due to the weather, but then after looking at the radar, he confirmed it was okay. I had mentioned that we would get coffee too, and he was fine with that. I even asked if he might need anything at the store and he mentioned paper plates. I told him I'd get them for him. He told us to have fun and didn't mention anything else.  When I left, he was doing dishes and watching the news. That's it. 

We head out, go get coffee at Wawa, and then go to the park. Between 7:10P-7:20P, he messages about something on the news. Cool! No problem! I responded but didn't get anything from that. 

We are getting ready to head out from the park at 7:50ish, so I message my dad asking if he needed my sister back right away or if he is okay with me taking her to the store. If he needed her back, I was going to drop by and drop her off, then go on my own. The conversation went like this (copied from text):

Me: When did you want Kyra back? We were on the trail for a bit. We were testing out the Aztec Death Whistle. Heading to the store now if you don't need her back right away. 

Dad: I had made dinner but I guess that's wasted now too.  Whenever, it doesn't matter.

Me: You didn't say a specific time back. I will drop her off so I can go then. 

Dad: Dinner is over.  Take her with.

Me: Remember, I can't read minds either, so don't expect me to do something you can't do. 

Dad: Over.

I didn't respond after that and took my sister straight home. I walked in (we live side-by-side, I have the key because I watch my sister's occasionally) and I'll admit, I wasn't mature, and asked him if he was going to stop being a d*uche canoe. He told me to get out, and that's when I asked him ""How am I supposed to know when you were making dinner, you never said anything?""

He proceeded to say that dinner is common sense and I should just know. Keep in mind that this man doesn't make dinner at a set time every night. Sometimes he'll nap until 7 PM. I am on an evening shift schedule and sometimes won't make dinner until 10. He knows this. I proceed to tell him that, and he continues to say ""get out"". I eventually got out after saying things out of frustration. I haven't spoken with him for a week. 

The biggest thing that angers me is that he's always upset when no one communicates with him. As he puts it ""I'm psycho, not psychic."" But then he expects us to also know what he means when he doesn't say anything at all. 

He also has a bad tendency to be passive aggressive as the texts usually go. I feel I have to walk on eggshells every single time with him. Me and my sister will tell him stuff, and he'll forget it a few days later. 

I feel bad for not speaking to him but I'm at my witts end. He never apologizes. He never is sorry. I'm done saying sorry when I feel I'm not in the wrong.

after a year of relationship
Sara and I met last year and we shared many beautiful moments. We met through a friend with whom we had a fight because of our relationship. The first outburst that happened in the relationship was when she called me ugly and stupid and I will never be beautiful or handsome. the best moments and slept at each other's place and had good sex 
however, all that changed after her excursion when she didn't answer me and got drunk, used her friends' phone when I called her and didn't answer me for 5 hours, I broke up with her for the first time then and turned off the phone for 3 days as a punishment, then after returning from the excursion she called me to see and talk and cried was then and she begged me to reconcile and we did, I gave her one more chance
and of course she didn't change for the first five months, everything was normal, even more beautiful, but only a few days after that it got worse and worse, she started to distance herself from me in every possible way and when I asked her what she was doing, she would give some stupid reasons, such as that I don't tell her she's beautiful enough to listen to her, that her dad annoys her, that school makes her tired, etc. etc. blah blah 
when I started to press her, she would be worse and worse, she would behave badly towards me and scold me and say that I was a psychopath and if I worked so hard around her, I prepared her lunch while she was sleeping, made the most beautiful coffee that she likes the most, but it seems that everything was in vain because we broke up on her aunt's birthday, I turned out to be a gentleman, I have to admit that I went there because I promised her mom, whom I loved very much, and that's why I left when we got there, of course we had a small argument where she said it wasn't fair that I was going to the beach with my friends to cheat on her and she wasn't cheating on me 
and she didn't want to make me coffee, which hurt me the most because I just remember how much I ran and in the end we got on the bus together and she turned around and said I was disgusting and left. from that moment on, every conversation ended and we didn't hear from each other again, and it's good, honestly, since she's gone, I feel peace, my training is never better, but I still suffer a lot",1,1750724996.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

Almost a year ago we met 3 times for coffee, I said I can’t meet him no more since it’s not the time and since he doesn’t share my faith. A few weeks ago he called me and shared the amazing news that he found God . We met a couple time at church and for tea, max what happened was us holding hands for 3 seconds. Now I feel that I have to say goodbye again, since I don’t want to disturb his walk with God. As a person I am not inspiring at all and everything that is good in me is God, the rest is my fault. I see that he likes me a lot, but I fear that when he sees that I am very much flawed, it will disturb his relationship with God. He is fresh into this and especially at the start of this walk I don’t want to disturb anyone. I prayed to God to protect him from me, even if that means that we can’t see each other anymore.

The entirety of the time I was living with her she always randomly expected things of me as if I was her boyfriend, like taking HER out to places and talking to her. I actually did not hear her say this to me, she told other people who told me this. I found out recently that there was a lot of stuff she was angry about with me through one of my friends but she never told me when stuff was bothering her and she seemed okay the entire time. It was always things that didn’t really affect her too. I paid for most of the things in our apartment (microwave, coffee machine, tv, tv stand, etc) and she only brought a couch. I would also drive her everywhere and even bought a parking permit that allowed me to park at our apartment complex and the school (which cost around $400+) even though I was already struggling financially while her parents pay for everything and own 10 air bnb’s. When we moved out we split cleaning the common areas by me cleaning the floors of our living room and kitchen (the majority of the common areas) while she only cleaned the kitchen counters (she decided this was how it was going to be split). We ended up getting a cleaning fee for our floors that was $7… which i’m not sure how because my mom and I both cleaned the floors together, but when I spoke to my roommate about it she acted like understood but apparently she told our friend she was pissed about it. She randomly became moody and quiet one day after I told her she doesn’t invite me to things and I found out there was more she was mad about with me that I didn’t even know. Living at this apartment would be very convenient for me as it’s right by my college, and I’m too uncomfortable too live with another person, but I don’t know if I can live with my bestfriend anymore.",2,1750724878.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

Gluten free is basically a myth with them, as cross contamination is a constant(I mean literally incessant) issue. The gluten free pastries and normal ones are stored in the same places often touching with the non gluten free items. The bread is handled in a super uncleanly way, just like the pastries! They use the same tongs to grab everything, whether it’s savory pastries, sweet pastries, breads, etc etc. They also pretty much never properly wash and disinfect the pastry cases or anything handling/touching food items. They also waste insane amounts of materials, bread and other things. Bins of day old bread are constantly being thrown away. The way food and pastries are stored is an absolute health code violation shit show— which leads me to talk about the kitchen and barista station. 

The kitchen is disgusting. Flat out. No way around it. Dirty rags are tossed into the ingredient bins, or on the food itself. They put sandwiches on unclean surfaces and casually cross contaminate things like raw meats and vegetables. The bread is old, dropped on the floor in some cases and still used. The utensils in which they scoop ingredients like capers, spring mix, tomato, etc etc are almost never changed out and washed. They assemble food with disgusting gloves after touching a various amounts of non disinfected items while making the food. It was an absolute mess back there, food all over the floors yet never cleaned up to help with the roach problem. Cleanliness and hair nets is virtually non existent in the kitchen, which is why it reeks of mice and has trash littering the place 24/7. Not to mention the kitchen employees don’t like their jobs, and don’t care about the customers because of that! Being smothered in heat all day in a disgusting kitchen with very little regard for sanitation, if any at all, I’d hate my job too.

The barista station is often wiped down with rags but no safe disinfectant. The way things are prepped in general are done with very little concerns for getting soap grain or other debris in the coffee pots and drinks themselves. The syrups used to sweeten coffees are often left open with no cap overnight despite having mice/ants/roaches littering the entire joint. Not to mention never wiped down whatsoever, constantly crystallizing from the top catching hairs and other debris. 

The training for their new employees is merciless and terrible,  they basically force you to figure it out and reprimand you for mistakes you made— although they reprimand you discreetly by never communicating to you directly what needs to improve, just telling management where you’re lacking until they have reason to let you go after covering the needed hours you were hired for. Not to mention, the higher ups are incredibly apathetic, somewhat unfriendly and surface level with new employees, yet incredibly tight knit with the other higher ups. The whole experience is isolating and honestly reminiscent of high school, just with full blown adults! Because you don’t know the very specific and tedious(gross) ways they do things, you’re subject to being talked down to and “tattled” on.

They’re so popular it’s insane and frankly undeserved. if only more people knew how terribly run that place was, they’d probably stop eating there and feeding their little ones food from such a risky environment.

I've generally been regarded as attractive, but of course I'm a skinny/smaller dude.

At present, my days are rather quiet, but enjoyable. My free time is spent on walking, playing the piano, video games, and more rarely; watching TV and reading. I improvise and write my own music for the piano, though that has slowed down this year, and the games I typically play consist of roguelikes (Hades, Barony, Balatro, Slay The Spire, etc.) as well as Nintendo games and League of Legends/TFT, though quite a bit less.

I went really hard with spirituality from about 2020 - present, and I'd say now that I'm most functionally similar to an orthodox Christian meet Buddhist, though of course that's only a rough description and doesn't begin to describe the profound and weird experiences I've had, none of which I care to delve into for this post, but if that's something you'd like to talk about then you're welcomed to inquire :)

I'd say I have the most fun when I'm watching different ideas and thought emerge in my mind regarding physics and health sciences ideas, though that is exhausting so I've been pacing myself to do it much less, and to be more focused on tangible and actionable things. Presently I'm getting resources together to be able to start a mathematical analysis on cymatic patterns/Chlandi plates.

As of now, I'm out of work and living with my parents while I focus on curing my body of scoliosis. I suspect this will be a deal-breaker for some, but frankly I love my parents and spending time with them, and I'm not interested in moving out just to be alone. As for work/money, this is of course out of medical necessity as I heal, and though I presently have no income, I also have no student debt.

As for more physical things, I'm a good cook (I tend towards vegetarianism, but would accurately be described as a pollo-pescatarian), and I like things quiet and simple. I'm not one for arguing or really any type of emotional drama, and as such I do my best to always be direct and not lie, no matter how small.

Deal-breakers for me: Facial piercings, tattoos, dyed hair, not a ""conspiracy theorist"" (governmental, health, scientifically). I want someone comfortable enough with themselves to be themselves without the need for altering their body for accessories; I enjoy natural beauty so much more.

If you think we'd get along and you're close to Orlando, then I'd love to chat. I'm all for setting up a coffee-date or something quickly too as I really don't care for text conversations, especially not for getting to know someone. Regardless, I appreciate you giving my post a read, and hopefully we'll be chatting :)",1,1750724475.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1liwumo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1liwumo/avoidant_vs_anxious_attachment/,avoidant vs anxious attachment,"hi all. burner account. i need some advice majorly. i (23F) have been dating my boyfriend (26M) officially since March (3 months) but acted like bf/gf since january, been talking since mid october. we matched on hinge and i really wasn’t looking for anything serious. we talked for a few weeks before going out on a date and just kept seeing each other since.  when we first started talking, he would text back way more frequently, and he was over the top with his comments. he was offering to bring me soup when i was sick before we had even met, complimenting my looks like crazy, and being super sympathetic and encouraging when id talk about something in my life that was annoying me. at the time we started talking, he had just moved back from a city (where he went to college and worked after college) to where he’s from originally, which is where i go to school. his job was removing his department basically and gave him and the others he worked with an opportunity to change departments or to take the severance pay, which he did and moved back home because he hated the city which he was working. so when we first started talking, he was super relaxed, had the severance pay, not much going on work/stress related. things got a bit intense once he  started applying to jobs again, and now he has a good job. he is in finance and i’m going to school to be a doctor, so completely opposite spectrums. he is saving up money at the moment and is staying with one of his parents as they have an extra room as opposed to pouring it all into rent, as he’d like to accumulate some funds before being forced into monthly payments. (so, no, none of this has to do with his income. he’s very smart financially, obviously, and as you all know, the housing market is ridiculous right now). 
i have a very anxious attachment style. it gets worse at night. we are very different in a lot of ways. i have an anxious attachment style, and id bet money my boyfriend has avoidant. my last relationship prior to this (3 years) was extremely healthy, we just grew apart, and were on about of good as terms as exes can be. so, being in that relationship, really suppressed my anxious attachment style i think. 
as i said, my current bf and i are very different. im smart, dont get me wrong, but i cant help but think with my heart. im extremely idealistic and believe the best in every situation. i like to have a set plan for when i am going to see him next or about plans oriented with my friends, but at the same time am very much the type of person thats like “hey, let’s travel to europe and get hotels, we can figure out what we’re gonna do when we get there!” he is the opposite of this. likes a plan, likes to know whats going on. he likes simplicity. (i do think he has OCD, but not confirmed). i’m also the type of person that values memories and experiences more than anything. i don’t care about material goods, id rather spend my money going to a concert with the people i care about. he’s the opposite, thinking it’d better to save money or that money should be put into something with longevity, as opposed to a trip or event. 
i apologize for the length of this, im just trying to give as much insight and detail as possible. 
that being said, i really love him. i want to text him all the time, see him all the time. but i feel like he doesn’t act this same initial way as when we first started dating, which i heard is sort of a common thing with people with an avoidant attachment style. when i asked him about if once, he made remarks that when we first started talking, he didn’t know as much about me aside from surface level things and my looks, so he praised my looks. he said now that he knows me on such a deeper and emotional level and cares for me so much more than he did then, that he talks about other stuff. which ok. i completely understand. 
just overall though, he texts less. his texts are more blunt and dry cut. 
when we first had arguments, they were brutal. i thought i was being so healthy by stating what my problem or issue was or why i was upset, how it made me feel and why, and i thought i was being open and transparent. it took me a long time to figure out that was making it seem like to him that i was targeting him, so he would get extremely defensive and ball up and would be blunt with his responses, which obviously upset me more , and the situation would escalate from something that should have never been an argument into something that made me feel so physically nauseous and ill. 
as of recently, we were  supposed to go on a trip for a weekend to a city about seven hours away, from Friday to Sunday, and it would be us as well as five of my other friends and their boyfriends, and he has met them all, but they’re my friends and not his. I asked him when he was a guest at a wedding and he said yes, and then we later talked about it, and he said that he probably couldn’t because his company would start the testing of their new program around that time, and he didn’t know what his work schedule would look like, and said I should go without him, which I said I didn’t want to do because I didn’t want to be the only one without my significant other there, and I know that I would feel upset and jealous, and that I probably wouldn’t have the best time. 
He took that as me trying to guilt trip him into it, which I was not trying to do, I was just trying to work out a situation that could accommodate for him to go, and if not that we could talk it through, but he eventually said yes, we will go because his family vacation is the week after.  
fast-forward about two weeks and we are discussing about how stuff might get difficult with the fact that I am starting the hardest year yet of my schooling, taking over 30 credits, and his company is starting a new testing and he is also studying for the CPA soon, and we were talking about how we really need to communicate with each other if we want this to work out, because we both said that we have. I know it is very soon, but he has told me that he sees himself marrying me multiple times, and I know that he cares because of how many arguments we have gone through where I probably put him through the ringer because of my anxious attachment style, because I type super long paragraphs because I am trying to be clear about how I am feeling, and what I need from him, but this is the worst thing to do to an avoidant attachment style person. 
He basically told me he was super anxious about the trip and he’s now not going, which I said, I wish we had figured that out before we paid the money and it was the week before, and he brought up that I was guilt tripping him, which was not my intention, but rather just trying to be clear about my feelings and my opinion. 
He also has a family vacation the following week, which he had made multiple comments about bringing me on  the months prior, saying things like “oh you’ll meet so and so when we go to my family’s house for the fourth” or “you’ll see this when we go on my family’s vacation for the 4th.” this made me feel super wanted, and included, and appreciated.  (background, he just met my parents beginning of june and i haven’t met his. i met his brother very briefly mid june) (also, his parents are divorced). for the past month, he stopped saying stuff like this about his family vacation where I was included, and would say things implying that only he was going. I brought it up and basically he said that reality kind of hit him with how soon it is coming up, and that the women in his family can be b**chy  (especially with drinks) and have not been welcoming to his exes in the past. he said that he would hate to bring me there and for then me to say why the heck would you bring me there and put me in this situation, and doesn’t want me to feel like crap.  he then said “Because I love you and would love you there to meet some people in my family and it’s a beautiful town” when I asked then why he would even bring it up in the first place. he then proceeded to say yeah come up, i was trying to protect you, so if they are mean to you or make you feel uncomfortable like you can’t blame me for it and get mad at me for it. 
The argument was longer than this, and unfortunately was heated because again, as I said, we just keep escalating each other. 
I would’ve liked to felt like I was invited and like I had the option. 
It makes me overthink like crazy, thinking that his past two exes both went on the trip  (his most recent relationship ended sometime 2022). I don’t know if they had known his dad, or some of his siblings, or anyone else in the family prior to going on the vacation, but it hurts that they were invited and I wasn’t.  
It is so easy for me to overthink and to get in my own head.  
I crave reassurance so much, and I am struggling so much because of my anxious attachment style, and I don’t know what to do .  
I would’ve liked to have been invited and felt like I was wanted there with him, actually asking me and letting me make the decision on my own. He told me that he thinks that I would do the best there out of all of his exes, so I still don’t understand why not invite me.  or ask me. 
I want to just dump all of my emotions and fears and thoughts on him and just tell him that I need reassurance on every little thing, but I know I can’t do that because that’s the literal worst thing to do to someone with an avoidant attachment style, but at the same time I am struggling so much. 
It is so easy for me to overthink so much, even though he has said to me numerous things to prove his love to me and also has done many things to prove his love to me. This post is still not giving enough insight into our life and our relationship, and is only highlighting the bads but because that’s what I need help with. so please, before everyone is rude in the comments, please understand that this is still not the entirety of the situation, and that I have feelings and that I am going through a lot, and don’t need to hear rude comments about him or about myself. I am here because, well, it’s reddit. 
to highlight some of the positives: 
- always pays for dinner, coffee, etc. i’ve paid for dunkin once and our breakfast bagels once. over the course of 8-9 months. 
-he comes to my place every weekend. 
-we cook together, he buys the groceries. 
-he picked up my online order of groceries (after waiting for them for an hour) and brought them to my place when i was sick. 
-he picked me up bc i was hammered at a school related event (im super small and hadn’t had anything to eat that day, oops) driving 35 mins to my event, picking me up with a bag for me to vomit in and a bottle of water, took me back to my place, helped me change and stayed with me all night. 
-was about to drive 2.5 hours one way to pick me up from the airport and 2.5 hours back (but luckily my flight was changed) 
-babysat my 3 cats (2 of which are kittens,) for 4 days 
he puts up with all of our fights. even though they get bad.  
i’m the person who saves every animal and critter on the side of the road. he’s not that person. but we were talking about it and was saying yeah no we’re not doing that when we’re older. so i got upset. we were cleaning after dinner and he went to the bathroom and i was still putting stuff on the dishwasher, and he saw that i was still kinda upset (wine influence for sure! ) and he said “ i am going to marry you someday. listen look at me. if we are driving and we see a one legged mink of a two legged bear or a four legged cat and it has disabilities i promise we will stop and pick it up. that’s not who i am but if it makes you happy it makes me happy. because i want you to be happy. i will do anything to make you happy. if it makes you happy it makes me happy because i always want you happy. okay? i promise you “. 
so please don’t come at this situation guns a blazing. i love him. and i know he loves me. even if he doesn’t always show it in the way i want. I just need genuine opinions and help and support. you have all been in the situation where you have been struggling in a relationship, so please take that into consideration when you are commenting, because mean comments aren’t going to do anything to help me. I need genuine help and   advice. 
I just hate that anytime I bring something up as a discussion that escalates into an argument. I don’t know what to do because as an anxiously attached person, all I want to do is talk about my feelings and my thoughts, and to work it out in the moment, which I know is the worst thing to do to someone who is avoidant, bombarding them only makes stuff worse.  I don’t know how we can come to a spot where we can discuss things without it escalating and where I can bring up what I am feeling and thinking and talk about how I need reassurance without him taking it personally or in a bad way, because I know he doesn’t think how I do. 
The situation with the family lake house is also really bugging me and I would really love some input and feedback on that. Honestly, anything would be appreciated. what do i do??",1,1750723994.0,Advice,4,0.67,False

It seems like, since I was put on seroquel, it caused it to kinda come back again and have kinda worsened my anxiety and made me more angry and depressed. I was taking trazodone at first because I was just getting general anxiety and from moving to a new place, I also was having trouble sleeping, which manage to get rid of it many of problems for a while then I was switched to seroquel because I kept getting extremely irritable before my period. I also think it had to do with consuming too much caffeine before my period, too. I switched back to trazodone and have switched to decaf tea and coffee. I seem to be doing a little better since I started back on trazodone again.",1,1750723764.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

1liwq6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1liwq6s/my_brother_is_trying_to_drown_my_children_pt_1/,My Brother is trying to drown my children. Pt 1,"I feel like this post might belong better on AIO or another subreddit like that but the panic is getting to me. For some pretense to my jitters, my younger brother drowned 20 years ago. I lost him so young that I have never been able to completely move on. It left me with a guilt that etched itself onto my soul and now I think that something more malicious is haunting my family. It feels evil. Like whatever it is, want’s to hurt me. I’ll let you all know what happened that day and whats going on now.

In the early 2000's, our family would take yearly trips to Mexico to visit relatives and keep us in touch with our roots. From sight seeing at national parks to visiting coastal towns, we spent a lot of time on the road. We would get pulled out of school for about two weeks at a time every year around January. It felt like a blessing to get away from school for those two weeks. I was a chubby quiet kid with a bowl cut, so that pretty much tells you how popular I was. But I wanted this trip to be different for me. My bubble was slowly suffocating me and it felt like it was time for it to burst. This was supposed to be my chance to try and prove to myself that I could be cool if I just tried. 

My younger brother, on the other hand, was a ball of energy that never sat still. He loved to ask questions and could entertain himself for hours with just his imagination. I envied how free he was and how he always was the center of attention even at a young age. While my older sister was more the stoic and calm type. Always around to scold us for misbehaving, but also played the role of a gentle and strong role model. I wished to be more like both of them. They shone in ways I only dreamed of being able to.

This trip was our last vacation together as a family, and I can’t seem to recall any of it. All of the fun moments spent together blotched out by the suffocating miasma of the day I lost my brother. My only recollection being that it was our second last day before we would be flying home. Our final destination was to be a famous water park on the coast of Michoacán, the state where my parents were from. This was my last chance on the trip to achieve my goal.

The park was a bustling and buzzing mess of patrons. Lifeguards with summery cocktails in hand, chatting with their coworkers and keeping their eyes everywhere but the pools. With it being seemingly normal for almost no supervision of any kind. Even the most wary of parent still only paying the slightest attention to their children, as they all seemed to frequent the bar. 

Lost in the jumble of music and screaming children, my brother David and I lost our parents and sister almost immediately. Yet we didn’t mind in the slightest, we were almost happier now that we were alone. The park seemed like a wild west, a no mans land of sorts. Every child for themselves to enjoy their time however they pleased. I could have sworn we even spotted a boy with a margarita in hand while sunbathing.
""Nesty where should we go first!"" David squealed with excitement. He seemed like he was having fun at just the sight of the place. His eyes squinting as the sun beamed directly towards him. I never understood why I found his reaction to be so irksome. It could be because I felt that playing with my younger brother would seem childish and the cool older kids at the park wouldn’t want me to hangout with them if I had him following me around.

""Go find mom and dad or something, I don’t want to hang out with you.""
""Why not? I didn't do anything! Please lets go play!"" He grabbed my hand and tried pulling me towards the slides by the kiddy pools.
""David leave me alone! I'm too old to play with you anymore!"" I said as I ripped my hand from his. Thinking back, I wasn’t too old to play with him. I loved my brother and his youthful enthusiasm. I just needed to prove to myself that I could be cool too and that I wasn’t just some fat awkward kid.
I started heading towards the lazy river where a group of 5 children, all around my age or older, were mindlessly floating. Even from a distance I could tell these guy’s were cool. Like, they already had girlfriends and did what they wanted, type of cool. They all shared the same skinny sun tanned build with their ribs slightly noticeable.

“Hey, can I hangout with you guys?” I asked sounding a lot more suave in my head.
They looked at me up and down with judgmental stares, analyzing me head to toe. I sucked my pudgy stomach in reflexively out of embarrassment.

“Why aren’t you in the water?” They all asked me confused on why I was still dry and on the side of the river.

“Umm, I don’t…”

“You don’t what?”

“I don’t know how to swim…” I whispered sheepishly as I stared at the ground.
Wailing laughter erupted from the boys as they fought to cling onto the edge of the river. They seemed like a pack of hungry hyenas encircling their prey as they rose from the water to stand in-front of me and David.

“Wait shouldn’t you be at the kiddy pool with him?” One said as they pointed at David and laughed.

“I’m not with him!” I yelled back. “David go find mom or Irene!” I whispered to trying to push him away. Yet he wouldn’t budge and simply shook his head and scowled up at me. I got the feeling that this kid was going to stay with me all day, whether I liked it or not.

The oldest of the group, seeming to be about 13 or 14 years old, stopped laughing. His black hair glistening with droplets of water collecting at the tips. He was obviously the leader and they all knew it. Grabbing the other boys by the shoulders, he turned them from my direction. All we heard were whispers and giggling over whatever they were discussing.

“Okay  Mowgli,” he said as all five boys turned to face us. Some holding back laughter while the others grinned from ear to ear. “We’ll let you hang out with us, BUT you have to do something first.”
David nervously glanced at me while slightly tugging on my swim shorts, he noticed something that I was too blind see.

It was simple. To hangout with them all I had to do was go through the main pool of the park, from one side to the other. Starting from the shallow end which would be a simple few steps, going all the way to the deep end on the other side. To this day I still barely know how to float let alone swim for a few feet before having to place my feet on the ground. But I thought this would be a good way to lose my brother and have him go find our parents or sister.

I stood before the bustling blue pool, readying myself for the trial before me. Once I made it to the other side I would finally be able to consider myself cool. There was nothing else that mattered in that moment other than me and the gently declining slope of the pool. Remembering back now the pool only reached about 5 feet deep but it seemed on par with marianna’s trench.

I started taking my first baby steps into the shallow end, when I felt how cold the water was to the touch. It freaked me out how on such a sunny day the water felt almost arctic. An eerie sign for my perilous journey from one end of the pool to the other. Within a few steps I was already knee deep in the water and I still felt confident. I was going to do this. Being so hyper focused on the water gradually swallowing my lower body, I tuned out my surroundings completely. All of the talking, screaming, and music turned into a droning murmur of sound that I was trying to ignore. The waves of the water rocking me as everyone in the pool splashed and swam in different directions.

“Look at the little piggy why would he get in the pool if he doesn’t even know how to swim?!” Screamed one of the boys as they laughed at me. I had no clue I was being mocked and made a joke of, all while I was fighting for my life to breathe. My sister, on the other hand who wasn’t too far away, was sun bathing and enjoying her peace. Yet she always made sure to keep us somewhere where she could either hear or see us. And she had one ear acutely tuned to what was happening with David and I.

“My big brother isn’t a pig.” David said taking his eyes off of me and turning to face the bullies.

“Aww is the baby mad cause his big brother is a little porky?” The leader said now pushing his nose up trying to look like a pig.

“You guys are bullies and I’m telling my brother that you guys lied to him!” David turned, making his way into the pool behind me. My sister decided at that moment to intervene before we got into any harm because of the bullies. She had gotten up and made her way to the lifeguard’s chair on the left end of the pool away from David and I.

“Nestor stop they tricked you!” He yelled as he began wading his way through the water quickly. 
His quickness brought him to a few feet behind me. And at a few feet behind me, he couldn’t walk on the pool floor any longer. He tried swimming with an awkward form between doggy paddling and something else. All of the swimmers and kids jumping into the pool created waves just strong enough to stop David from keeping his head above the water. The sloshing behind me was pulling and trying to bring my attention towards my brother’s desperate fight to grab my attention. He began to silently and slowly sink as the screams of other children and the blaring music drowned him out. Others starting to swim over and around us as my momentum started coming to halt and panic began settling in. 

I felt a slight bump on my back. A push so gentle yet with just enough force to propel me forward again. I came up for air and saw the edge just within my reach. If I went under and just tiptoed enough for one last bounce I could make it! I extended my arms out and closed my eyes as my hands pawed for the edge. With my hands touching the cool stone above the edge of the pool, my eyes shot open. I had made it! 

Pulling myself with all the force left in my body, I sprang out of the water gasping for air and looking across the other side for the boys to be cheering me on. But as I looked around, I saw no one not even David. I rubbed my eyes and saw Irene running my way with the lifeguard. Fear covering her face as she screamed and I stood watching as the lifeguard dived in the pool past me. The world was silent for some reason. I saw the bustling of the other swimmers stop. The music even seemed to pause as everyone turned to face the pool I had just managed to escape from. In the water, was David’s body face down and floating up with his small back facing the sky. A high pitched ringing was all that I could hear as I stood motionless staring at my brother.

Irene began telling me everything as we sat outside of my brother’s hospital room. The mocking and David trying to stop me from going deeper. My mother, screaming as if she was being murdered, hid her face in my father’s chest as the color drained from him. This scene would play on repeat for the next 15 years of my life. While David’s death devastated all of us, I took it the worst. I knew this all had happened because of me. Because of a stupid childish wish to be cool. And it cost me my brothers life. 

My parents swore to never let my sister and I out of their sight ever again. Irene hated it but I had no objections. I gave up on my personal journey and fell deeper into my hole of self loathing. Where I used to feel the need to be recognized by my school mates as ‘cool’, was now replaced with a shame and guilt that the trade between my brothers life and mine was fueling.

The years following, I had no real motivations or goals so I followed the path my father set for me. Become an architect as he was and work for his firm that maintained steady work. And I did. I went to college with nothing on my mind rather then to just be in and out. But I found love and comfort while there. 

My wife was a psych major and normally our paths wouldn’t have crossed but she says her accidentally ramming her bike into me as I walked to class, was destiny. She wouldn’t let me just walk away without her properly apologizing to me, so I let her buy me a coffee. After that, what was supposed to be a simple apology turned into us meeting coincidentally at the same café every Friday morning. We would talk about our week, classes, and life in general. She offered me such a sincere and genuine connection that brought a glimmer back to my eyes.

We married after college and had two beautiful boys. Ironically enough their age gap was the same as David and I. My oldest son, Daniel, was the exact same as his late uncle. A ball of energy who could keep himself occupied for hours. It’d bring me tears of mixed emotions whenever I would get to watch him for awhile. Rami was like his mother in the fact that he was gentle and kind even at a young age. Going as far as bringing a small injured bird into our apartment to nurse him back to health. The boys loved to ask about my childhood since I was always so reserved about it.

They argued whether I was apart of a secret spy family or hitmen, but I would laugh and reassure them that it was nothing out of the ordinary. I told them that I had a normal childhood and I even had a brother. But he went to heaven early to make sure we would all know the way there. That answer was good enough for them so they never asked more and it was good enough for me to not wallow on the past. When Amanda and I finally had enough money saved, we bought our first home. She wanted a nice house in the suburbs with a pool for the boys to swim in, since she always dreamed of having a pool as a little girl. 

Having designed a house recently in the city of Agoura Hills, I felt that the quiet nature there would suit us perfectly. With her job as a well established marriage counselor and my job as an architect, we could afford it. As soon as we moved in Daniel and Rami hounded me to have the pool cleaned so they could swim. And when I did, I was left on lifeguard duty. The boys splashed water at each other, swung pool noodles and screamed with joy. I cherished the simple blessings like this, it offered me the chance lick my wounds in a way therapy couldn’t. Amanda was at a last minute emergency appointment with a client of her’s that swore she was finally going to divorce her dead beat husband. Distraught that she wouldn’t able to join the boys for the first swim in our new pool, she asked me to take and send as many pictures as I could.

“Okay boys I’m going to get your towels, I’ll be right back.” I said to them as I slid open the pocket door for the backyard and made my way to their room. I would always forget which drawer had their towels so I opened and closed them in order until I reached the bottom. “I have to remember that it’s the last one.” I murmured as I grabbed two blue towels and threw them over my shoulder. The layout of the house had the boys room right next to the backyard, with the window giving a view of everything going on in the pool. Listening to the boys still splashing and giggling, I heard my phone chime. Pausing and reaching into my pocket with my back to the window, I saw a message from Amanda.

“Oh did one of the neighbor’s kids come to play with them!”
Rereading the text, I thought my wife was seeing maybe a smudge on my camera that could have looked like a third kid? I pressed the photo and zoomed in. In the corner of the picture was a figure of a boy in the pool. Not Daniel or Rami, but another child facing their direction with them oblivious to his presence. 

I glanced towards the pool before I left the room. What I saw sent a numbing shock through my body. A tingling sensation of dread and danger that caught me so off guard I couldn’t find the strength to even breathe. There, on the deep end side of the pool, was a boy with pale blue deeply cracked skin like old leather. His hair buzzed and his eyes squinting daggers at Daniel and Rami, who didn’t notice the boy floating in the pool with them. The next moment his head swiveled towards my direction and white bubbling foam began oozing out of his mouth and down into the pool. I dropped the towels and ran out of the room in an instant. My heart thudded against my chest, my eyes began to burn, and my mind worked it’s hardest to tell myself I made that whole scene up.

“DANIEL, RAMI GET OUT OF THE POOL NOW!” I yelled as I dashed outside.
“What’s wrong dad?” Daniel asked as they both dropped their pool noodles and looked at me nervously.
“I SAID GET OUT!”

The two of them stiffened up and got out quickly as I paced around the edge of the pool.
There was nobody there but I couldn’t have made that up! I haven’t been on medications for years and I stopped seeing things along with them. I saw David, there’s no fucking way I was hallucinating. Sure it was a nightmare version of him but I know it was my brother. I searched every corner of the pool and found no signs that anyone else got in our out of there in the few second’s it took me to run outside. All that was left where the boy vanished was  a small white foam cluster in the center of the pool.

I pulled the boys quickly to the bathroom and began drying them off before they noticed anything.
 “Boy’s… did you guy’s see um… anyone else in the pool?” I asked as I continued patting them down.
“No dad,” Rami said innocently, “me and Daniel we’re just play samurais!” Daniel shook his head in agreement underneath the towel as I dried his hair. Daniel was still tense from me yelling at them, but Rami was already over it and ready to start playing inside now. I sighed and took both towels in my hands.

“Okay… sorry for scaring you guys. Dad’s just been a little on edge because of all the moving stress.” I said softly as I got down to eye level with them. They both looked ready to bolt to their room and continue playing as they stepped from side to side. I smiled a bit knowing that I didn’t scare them too much. Everything was fine.

“Go on boys, go play.”

They darted out towards their room as I stood at the door. I still felt a twinge of shock throughout my body. Sighing I walked towards the broom closet and took out the mop. Amanda hated any stains on the ground, so I had to clean up the wet footprints the boys left as we walked inside. Starting at the sliding door, I followed the footsteps with the mop and stopped at the hallway splitting between the guest bathroom and my office. 

Where the trail of two child size and one adult pair of foot steps curved towards the direction of the bathroom, another set strayed from the path. Small wet foot prints led to my office, where the door stood slightly ajar. I gulped and felt the air around me thicken to an almost sludge like sensation. Inhaling the thickened air, I snailed my way through the suffocating humidity enveloping the hallway. 

The door hung tauntingly as it creaked a tease for me to open it. My mind raced, heart tightened and body trembled as I moved as an embodiment of fear. When my hand grasped the warm edge of the door, I swung it open and found the steps almost skipping forward. They ended at the foot of my grand bookshelf where I stored house plans and books of construction codes that I collected over the years. But with all of my work related things, sat a picture book from my childhood that I would look at whenever I was feeling nostalgic. That same book laid perfectly open on the ground. Open to last picture of David and I, from our trip to Mexico.

I’m still staring at the book, I can’t even bring myself to put it back on the shelf. I had to wipe my sweaty hands down before I began typing all this out. Can someone tell me I’m just over-reacting?  I’m going to keep this away from my wife cause I don’t want her to worry about my mental health again when she has so much going on. In the meantime I’m going to get a drink and clean this up. God knows I need it.

1liwppj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1liwppj/the_town_at_the_end_of_route_18/,The Town at the End of Route 18,"It was supposed to be a quick drive. It’s been three weeks.

I’d just finished moving my sister into her new place in Cincinnati and figured I’d take the long way home, scenic route, a little peace, maybe grab a picture of a covered bridge or something old-school. My Dad used to do that, take new routes home every day. I’d get so annoyed because I just wanted to go, but now I understand why. He was trying to teach me to enjoy the journey I guess.

Anyway I was halfway through a two-lane stretch of Route 18 when I realized I hadn’t seen another car in nearly an hour. No trucks, no semis, no headlights in my rearview. Just gray road, flat cornfields, and the kind of cloudy sky that makes everything feel like it’s been put on pause.

It was so strange because 5:00 is always rush hour. I’ve been stuck in standstill traffic for up to four hours before, but here there was absolutely no one else on the road. I didn’t panic or anything, not then, I just thought it was good luck.

Since I was in a new area I wanted to see what it had to offer. I started scanning for a gas station, a diner, something local, no chains. And then I saw the sign. It was small, wooden, and so weather-worn it almost completely blended into the trees behind it.

""Welcome to Bent Bridge.”

It had a population count too, but the numbers were too faded to read. I don’t remember seeing it on the map, but I was mostly driving by the overhead roadsigns at that point, so I figured I'd stop in, stretch my legs, maybe get a snack. The town looked like it had been plucked from a postcard, but not a new one.

One of those washed-out, sepia-toned photos you find in boxes at a flea market. Small main street, angled hanging shop signs, brick buildings with hand-painted windows. Everything extremely neat. The people were the same. Polite. Smiling. Friendly in a way that felt scripted. Like they were reading from a play I hadn’t seen.

A man at the gas station greeted me with a wave and a grin so big I swear it moved his eyes. I pulled over to ask a few questions and he called out

“Beautiful day, isn’t it?”

he said it just like it was something he’d practiced for a high school play. I nodded and mumbled

“Yeah, I guess.”

He didn’t blink. Just kept smiling.

“I was looking for a place to rest and eat a little, you got any restaurants? I’m looking for something local.”

“Well yeah! BB Diner is just down that street on the corner, you can see the sign from here! Best Pan Fried Steak in the county! And you’re in luck too, because right across the bridge is the BB In!”

I said thanks and kept driving. I heard him behind my car say his line.

“Beautiful day, isn’t it?”

""The birds are singing!"" another replied.

Looking down the street I noticed everything was named BB Something. BB Mercantile, BB Postoffice, BB autorepair. It was like the creators of the town really liked shortening Bent Bridge into BB and threw it everywhere. If it ain’t broke, I guess.

In the diner, a waitress refilled my coffee four times without being asked. I never saw her walk over. I’d blink, and my cup would be full and she’d be smiling asking if she could get me anything else. I asked if the BB Inn had rooms. She paused for a really long time, just staring.

At first right in the eyes but then they went distant. They came back into focus and it was like she snapped out of a trance.

“Of course! Just past the old bridge.”

“Old bridge?” I asked.

She looked at me and smiled again. Wide.

“It’s what the town’s named after.”

I don’t know why but I faked putting the pieces together about BB and it made her laugh. It wasn’t a real laugh.

As I left I noticed the handful of guests in the diner hadn’t moved, one was still in the same place of his lemon pie he’d been when I walked in. He just sat there, staring at the half eaten wedge, fork in his hand.

I followed the directions she gave me, left at the courthouse, past the shuttered post office, down the gravel road with no name, until I found the bridge. It was barely standing. Rusted bolts, sagging beams. One of the handrails had broken clean off.

On the other side was the inn. At least, that’s what the crooked wooden sign said. “BB Inn” But it didn’t look like an inn. More like a house someone abandoned and then some other fellow moved in thinking it could be a fixer upper.

I would assume this individual was one of those who always start projects and never finish. The windows were different kinds from the frames to the panes. Paint peeling like birch bark, and the front door was wide open. Inside, it smelled like pine cleaner and bleach, but underneath there was something sickly, like old melted candy or rotting fruit.

A woman stood at the check-in counter. She looked young, but in the same way a wax museum figure of a young woman might look young. Smooth face. Hair that didn’t move, and that wide smile everyone seemed to have. It started to unnerve me.

“Room’s ready,” she said.

“Oh… did you know I was coming?”

“Shirley from the Diner called ahead, we got everything ready for you!”

If it weren’t for the circumstances I’d take this chance to start flirting.

Everything about this town was so strange I gave staying there a second thought. But I told myself I was tired. That I’d just lock the door and leave at first light. But the door didn’t lock. And when I tried to prop a chair against the knob, I turned around and it was already back under the desk. I started to actually freak out. I didn’t sleep. I listened.

All night there were voices under the floorboards. Not talking, practicing. Repeating lines over and over again.

“Beautiful day, isn’t it?”

“Coffee’s always fresh here.”

“Room’s ready.”

Over and over. Same cadence. Same exact words. No variation. Like they were warming up for something. At dawn, I left. No one stopped me, but the town wasn’t the same.

The shop windows were still painted, but the names had changed, now they were just labels. “FOOD.” “HARDWARE.” “SLEEP.”

The people were walking in slow loops, nodding to each other on perfect intervals, as if on cue. And every single one of them looked at me with that awful smile.

I hurried back in my car, I tried to drive back the way I came. But Route 18 didn’t curve on the way out like it did the way in.

The cornfields were gone, replaced by endless, repeating houses. I turned around a dozen times trying to find the road I’d taken. But all I passed were the same houses. Not identical, but uncannily close. As if variations of the same design. Like someone had an idea but didn’t have success in making it real. Like someone had studied suburban design and built it from memory, and got 95% of it right.

The windows were slightly too tall. Doors too narrow. Mailboxes sitting just a bit too close to the curb. And every driveway had a car with license plates that ended in “111.”

The gas tank never empties. The clouds haven’t moved once. I've started to pick up some of the lines the townfolk use. I found out there might be only a certain number of them, either that or they recycle outfits.

It's always a man in a worn sunhat and overalls, or a nice business suit. A woman in a polkadotted pencil skirt or a blouse, sometimes with an apron.

It's always the same clothes with slight variations. When I pass one I recognize I know what they're going to say. I said it at the same time once to see what would happen. Nothing, just the awful uncanny smile. I saw one woman wearing modern clothes once, but I never saw her again. I don't know where she went.

Sometimes I pass the BB Inn again. Different angle. Different sign. Same crooked smile in the window. Every time I pass, I feel more like I belong here. The lines are starting to stick. And the next time someone says

""Beautiful day isn't it?""

1liwpby,https://i.redd.it/wyvr7wn0or8f1.jpeg,"New to espresso and flair, damn good results","I'm new to espresso brewing, coming from a casual enjoyer and someone who has used French, drip, and aeropress. I got the 58+2 bundle 6 weeks ago and have been drinking 2-3 shots a day. It took me just a bit to get used to the process, and I feel I've got it down now.
Preheat level 1-2, water 92-96c
18g in (this has stayed constant, open to trying more)
Been finding an initial press around 4 bar for a few drops, a gradual ramp to 6-8 depending on resistance, and ending the shot with a fade down to low bar when approaching 1:2ish (basically near 30g out) to finish at 38-42g out

My two qualms that are hard to nail down-- water, do you open the plunger when pouring or fill and let it fall? The latter is what is recommended by flair and I've had moderate success doing. However, ""burping"" all the bubbles out can take wildly different amounts of time. I still preferred this method because I could fill the brewhead and let the water and the heating element come to equilibrium. I was getting some air trapped in though, so I've just recently tried pouring directly on the pf by slightly opening the lever and pouring while lifting open. Still, I'm finding there's still a good bit of bubbles to shake out when I've got it full. I'd like to minimize the ""burping"" because I have to yank around the device and it's an uncontrolled variable.

I've been finding that if I take too long getting the air bubbles out, my shot gets so saturated that it turns into a turbo and I can't reach pressure. I can usually salvage the shot by easing pressure but there are slight flavor differences I can taste and I'd like to just nail down consistency altogether. It seems like a fine line between a nice 30sec pull or something that shoots out in half the time, is this true for anyone else? Should I start timing the moment I let water hit the coffee and pull the shot at a certain time regardless if there's air in there? Gotta be a better way.

Anyway I was halfway through a two-lane stretch of Route 18 when I realized I hadn’t seen another car in nearly an hour. No trucks, no semis, no headlights in my rearview. Just gray road, flat cornfields, and the kind of cloudy sky that makes everything feel like it’s been put on pause.

It was so strange because 5:00 is always rush hour. I’ve been stuck in standstill traffic for up to four hours before, but here there was absolutely no one else on the road. I didn’t panic or anything, not then, I just thought it was good luck.

Since I was in a new area I wanted to see what it had to offer. I started scanning for a gas station, a diner, something local, no chains. And then I saw the sign. It was small, wooden, and so weather-worn it almost completely blended into the trees behind it.

""Welcome to Bent Bridge.”

It had a population count too, but the numbers were too faded to read. I don’t remember seeing it on the map, but I was mostly driving by the overhead roadsigns at that point, so I figured I'd stop in, stretch my legs, maybe get a snack. The town looked like it had been plucked from a postcard, but not a new one.

One of those washed-out, sepia-toned photos you find in boxes at a flea market. Small main street, angled hanging shop signs, brick buildings with hand-painted windows. Everything extremely neat. The people were the same. Polite. Smiling. Friendly in a way that felt scripted. Like they were reading from a play I hadn’t seen.

A man at the gas station greeted me with a wave and a grin so big I swear it moved his eyes. I pulled over to ask a few questions and he called out

“Beautiful day, isn’t it?”

he said it just like it was something he’d practiced for a high school play. I nodded and mumbled

“Yeah, I guess.”

He didn’t blink. Just kept smiling.

“I was looking for a place to rest and eat a little, you got any restaurants? I’m looking for something local.”

“Well yeah! BB Diner is just down that street on the corner, you can see the sign from here! Best Pan Fried Steak in the county! And you’re in luck too, because right across the bridge is the BB In!”

I said thanks and kept driving. I heard him behind my car say his line.

“Beautiful day, isn’t it?”

""The birds are singing!"" another replied.

Looking down the street I noticed everything was named BB Something. BB Mercantile, BB Postoffice, BB autorepair. It was like the creators of the town really liked shortening Bent Bridge into BB and threw it everywhere. If it ain’t broke, I guess.

In the diner, a waitress refilled my coffee four times without being asked. I never saw her walk over. I’d blink, and my cup would be full and she’d be smiling asking if she could get me anything else. I asked if the BB Inn had rooms. She paused for a really long time, just staring.

At first right in the eyes but then they went distant. They came back into focus and it was like she snapped out of a trance.

“Of course! Just past the old bridge.”

“Old bridge?” I asked.

She looked at me and smiled again. Wide.

“It’s what the town’s named after.”

I don’t know why but I faked putting the pieces together about BB and it made her laugh. It wasn’t a real laugh.

As I left I noticed the handful of guests in the diner hadn’t moved, one was still in the same place of his lemon pie he’d been when I walked in. He just sat there, staring at the half eaten wedge, fork in his hand.

I followed the directions she gave me, left at the courthouse, past the shuttered post office, down the gravel road with no name, until I found the bridge. It was barely standing. Rusted bolts, sagging beams. One of the handrails had broken clean off.

On the other side was the inn. At least, that’s what the crooked wooden sign said. “BB Inn” But it didn’t look like an inn. More like a house someone abandoned and then some other fellow moved in thinking it could be a fixer upper.

I would assume this individual was one of those who always start projects and never finish. The windows were different kinds from the frames to the panes. Paint peeling like birch bark, and the front door was wide open. Inside, it smelled like pine cleaner and bleach, but underneath there was something sickly, like old melted candy or rotting fruit.

A woman stood at the check-in counter. She looked young, but in the same way a wax museum figure of a young woman might look young. Smooth face. Hair that didn’t move, and that wide smile everyone seemed to have. It started to unnerve me.

“Room’s ready,” she said.

“Oh… did you know I was coming?”

“Shirley from the Diner called ahead, we got everything ready for you!”

If it weren’t for the circumstances I’d take this chance to start flirting.

Everything about this town was so strange I gave staying there a second thought. But I told myself I was tired. That I’d just lock the door and leave at first light. But the door didn’t lock. And when I tried to prop a chair against the knob, I turned around and it was already back under the desk. I started to actually freak out. I didn’t sleep. I listened.

All night there were voices under the floorboards. Not talking, practicing. Repeating lines over and over again.

“Beautiful day, isn’t it?”

“Coffee’s always fresh here.”

“Room’s ready.”

Over and over. Same cadence. Same exact words. No variation. Like they were warming up for something. At dawn, I left. No one stopped me, but the town wasn’t the same.

The shop windows were still painted, but the names had changed, now they were just labels. “FOOD.” “HARDWARE.” “SLEEP.”

The people were walking in slow loops, nodding to each other on perfect intervals, as if on cue. And every single one of them looked at me with that awful smile.

I hurried back in my car, I tried to drive back the way I came. But Route 18 didn’t curve on the way out like it did the way in.

The cornfields were gone, replaced by endless, repeating houses. I turned around a dozen times trying to find the road I’d taken. But all I passed were the same houses. Not identical, but uncannily close. As if variations of the same design. Like someone had an idea but didn’t have success in making it real. Like someone had studied suburban design and built it from memory, and got 95% of it right.

The windows were slightly too tall. Doors too narrow. Mailboxes sitting just a bit too close to the curb. And every driveway had a car with license plates that ended in “111.”

The gas tank never empties. The clouds haven’t moved once. I've started to pick up some of the lines the townfolk use. I found out there might be only a certain number of them, either that or they recycle outfits.

It's always a man in a worn sunhat and overalls, or a nice business suit. A woman in a polkadotted pencil skirt or a blouse, sometimes with an apron.

It's always the same clothes with slight variations. When I pass one I recognize I know what they're going to say. I said it at the same time once to see what would happen. Nothing, just the awful uncanny smile. I saw one woman wearing modern clothes once, but I never saw her again. I don't know where she went.

Sometimes I pass the BB Inn again. Different angle. Different sign. Same crooked smile in the window. Every time I pass, I feel more like I belong here. The lines are starting to stick. And the next time someone says

""Beautiful day isn't it?""

A bowel with chilli and two slices of bread. First thought “that’s some good looking gf bread” then that made me question it. Here comes the first hurdle. I hate saying anything or being a burden so I first had my mom taste it and she said “yea it tastes a little weird so I can see it being gluten free” but it sussed me out still so I asked the waiter and she said “yea that gluten free” I got excited and then thankfully she came back and was like “actually that’s not gluten free”. Real bummer. And so dumb that they serve something labeled gf with non gf bread. That makes no sense to me.

1liwitr,https://www.reddit.com/r/patrickmullensauthor/comments/1liwitr/mother_short_horror/,Mother (Short Horror),"“I need to go back to Mother.”  He said.

His small frame looked frail on the couch, too thin.  I’d made sure there were plenty of snacks there, and a bottle of water.  Even though he was clearly upset, it was good to see him eating.

“We’re going to take good care of you, Ezekiel.  You’re safe here.  Do you like those, the peanut butter cups?”

A pile of wrappers lay on the coffee table.  Normally, I wouldn’t let him eat so many, but he needed the calories.

“They’re good.”  He grabbed another handful.

I was looking at his incomplete information, trying to make sense of it.  A hunter had seen him by a creek, in the middle of nowhere.  Well, near the Idaho/Montana border.  There was a sort of shack or cabin nearby, which seemed lived in, even though it was decrepit.  Ezekiel was the only person there when the hunter looked.  I’d called and left a message asking for details, but he hadn’t gotten back to me yet.

“It can be hard to leave a place you’ve spent a lot of time in, and hard to make changes.”

No response.  There were a lot of questions he didn’t want to answer, which I attributed to trauma.

“What’s it like being in Boise?”

“It’s loud.  I don’t like cars.  They scare me.”

“Are you used to seeing less cars?”

He stared at nothing, silent.

We still hadn’t figured out who he was.  He’d said his name, Ezekiel, but didn’t know his last name.  At this point, I couldn’t be sure if he even had a social security number.  He could have been born outside of a hospital and just grown up in the mountains.  Finding out was the first step, before we could do anything else for him.

“It’s a lot warmer down here than it was up in the mountains, isn’t it?”

“Mother kept me warm.”

“That’s good.  Did she make fires, or give you blankets?”

Another blank stare.

It seemed like any question about ‘Mother’ or his living conditions was met with silence. That would make sense if his ‘Mother’ was very controlling.  I had to try and prompt answers in other ways.

“You know, when I was your age, my Mom used to make the best pies.  She’d make the crust out of flour and water, then roll it out into a big circle, kind of like a pancake.”

I tried to engage him, leaning forward and making a circle with my thumbs and index fingers.  He listened intently, unwrapping another peanut butter cup.

“She would put in berries and sugar, bake it in the oven.  There was nothing like that smell, waiting for the first slice.”

I wanted to know what he was eating, if anything.  But I didn’t want him to shut down again.  Maybe taking a different angle would help.

“I think my Mom was the best mom in the world.”

“No!”  He threw the candy to the ground.  “Mother takes care of me.  She’s all I need.”

“You know, I’d like to meet her sometime.”

“You don’t want to meet her.”  Ezekiel’s voice was matter of fact.

“I like meeting new people.”

“She wouldn’t like you.”

“I’m very nice though.  I could give her peanut butter cups.”

“No.  She only eats dead things.”

That was a strange turn of phrase, but I was glad he was talking.

“Like the hunter that found you?  He was trying to get deer to eat.”

“She eats deer, but doesn’t cook them.  She makes me scare the birds away, so they don’t eat it all.”

I didn’t know how to make sense of what he was saying, but I wanted to keep him talking.  Something like ‘So your mother eats rotting carcasses?’ would probably end the conversation.  I needed a better prompt.

“Are the deer good?”

He scoffed.

“I don’t eat them.  You shouldn’t try and eat Mother’s food.”  For whatever reason, his tone suggested an aggressive dog or animal more than a person.

There was a knock at the open door.  My coworker carried what could only be Ezekiel’s file.  His expression was professional, but concerned.

“Here’s his info.  BPD is sending someone over to ask more questions.  I'm working on contacting next of kin.”

“Thank you, Clark.  Ezekiel, is it okay if I read this for a minute?  Here’s some crayons, do you need any more food or water?”  He shook his head, and gladly accepted the crayons and paper.

If Clark contacted the police, that meant Ezekiel was a missing person.  I opened the manila envelope, wanting to know the situation before the authorities arrived.

Ezekiel had gone missing two years ago.  Apparently he was seven, older than I’d thought based on his small size.  His family had gone camping, and were reported missing by his aunt on his mother’s side.  A ranger found the car and camp site unoccupied, with the tent cut open.

Gerard, Mary, and Ezekiel Clayton, all still missing.  The cause was suspected to be foul play.  Looking through their photos, Ezekiel was much better fed two years ago.  His father was a tall man with a dark beard, his mother strikingly beautiful with long red hair.  

“Ezekiel, is your Mother still alive?  Out there in the woods?”

I showed him her picture.

At first, his face was blank.  Little by little his eyes widened, thin lips parting gently then pulling back at the corners.  Painful sobs wracked his small frame, as he put his face into his hands and brought his knees up into his chest.

“That’s not my Mom!  That’s not her!  Mother said to forget about her!”

I went over, trying to put an arm around his shoulder.  I’d been reading the file for a few minutes, absorbing every detail in case there was useful information.  On the table in front of him, a drawing sat.

It was rudimentary, with a simple circle for the face like kids tend to draw.  Much of it was disproportionate, and I would not have been flattered if my child drew a portrait of me like that.  The ears seemed too long, the mouth too wide, and he’d used the same color brown for everything, which made the whole face look hairy.  It unsettled me a little, but I had more pressing concerns than this boy’s lack of artistic skill.

The PD had sent a few people over, and I helped an officer ask more questions.  We needed to see if Ezekiel knew anything about what had happened, or about the person taking care of him, who was the most likely suspect in his parent’s disappearance.

“This might be a hard question to think about, but if you know anything about what happened to your parents, you have to tell us.  It’s the only way we can make things right.  Do you know where your parents are, or what happened to them?”

Ezekiel shook his head furiously.  I looked at the officer, whose face was stern.  This was now a criminal investigation, likely for murder, and the suspect was still out there.  I didn’t want to try and force information out of him when he was clearly traumatized, but I had to.

“Ezekiel, do you know where your parents are?”

“No!”

He kicked furiously, knocking over the coffee table and the drawing, sending the crayons rolling across the carpet.  Getting to his feet, he tried to run for the door.  I grabbed his arm, and pulled him into a hug.  At first he fought me, then relaxed.  After a minute, his breathing slowed down and he began to hug me back.

“You’re safe here.  You’re safe.  It’s okay, just breathe.”

I steeled myself for another outburst, as I asked him the question again.

“Okay, Ezekiel.  We’re safe here.  You can just whisper in my ear.  It’ll be a secret, right?  Just us.  Do you know what happened to your parents?”

He looked up at me, eyes pink and swollen.  Then he leaned in.

“She killed them.”  He said, in a soft voice that was just air.

“She killed them, and ate them.  She left them on the ground, until they changed colors and the birds and flies were eating them, too.  She said I had to forget them, but I remember.  I can show you where the bones are.  I go there sometimes, when she’s asleep.”

I stood there, paralyzed.  The horror of it, and this boy had to watch.  My stomach was turning, but I had to keep going.

“Anything else?”  I whispered.

He looked at me for a moment, standing in front of the couch, by the upended coffee table.  He leaned in, right up to my ear, as if to tell a secret that could get him in trouble.

“We’re not safe here.”  His voice was even quieter than before.

The whole situation had disturbed me, but the way he said that one sentence was terrible.  He didn’t believe he could ever be free of her, to be safe, and why should he?  It had only been two days.  It would take time, and work.

The police took him to ask some additional questions.  I don’t know if they got him to say anything useful for the investigation or not.  I was at my desk staring at nothing when they called me back in.

There was a sketch artist, working on a portrait based on Ezekiel’s description.  He was pacing near the door when I came down the hall, and immediately walked up to me.

“Dr. Evers?”  He was upset about something.

“Just call me Haley.  How can I help?”

“Well… we want him to draw the abductor.  I talked with a few people, and I understand that this person likely killed his parents.  See the problem is, I think maybe he’s projecting their personality into their appearance or something.  I thought you might know better than me, since you’re the psychiatrist.”

He had held a paper in his hand the whole time, facing the ground.  Now, he handed it to me.

It was masterfully done, in horrific detail.  The mouth was too wide, and sharp teeth protruded over the bottom lip.  The ears were too long, and it seemed like at least part of her face was covered with hair.  The eyes unsettled me the most, with rusty brown irises so large that there were almost no whites visible.  Even with all of these animal features, I could tell it was a woman.

The artist exhaled slowly, hands on his hips.  He didn’t know what to make of it, and neither did I.  His picture was unbelievable, grotesque like something from a nightmare.  For all of the work this man had put into it, the drawing was unusable.

“That’s mother.”  Ezekiel said, as if it were an obvious conclusion.

A feeling came over me.  It would be denial to call it anything but fear, a deep and primal fear.  I knew there had to be an explanation, but my intuition was telling me something else.  It told me that Ezekiel had described ‘Mother’ exactly how she was.

I looked the boy in the eyes, and there was no dishonesty there.  Whatever my mind told me didn’t matter, because the artist’s drawing defied logic.  Instinct was telling me something, and very loudly: we weren’t safe here.

The cornfields were gone, replaced by endless, repeating houses. I turned around a dozen times trying to find the road I’d taken. But all I passed were the same houses. Not identical, but uncannily close. As if variations of the same design. Like someone had an idea but didn’t have success in making it real. Like someone had studied suburban design and built it from memory, and got 95% of it right. 

The windows were slightly too tall. Doors too narrow. Mailboxes sitting just a bit too close to the curb. And every driveway had a car with license plates that ended in “111.” 

The gas tank never empties. The clouds haven’t moved once. I've started to pick up some of the lines the townfolk use. I found out there might be only a certain number of them, either that or they recycle outfits. 

It's always a man in a worn sunhat and overalls, or a nice business suit. A woman in a polkadotted pencil skirt or a blouse, sometimes with an apron. 

It's always the same clothes with slight variations. When I pass one I recognize I know what they're going to say. I said it at the same time once to see what would happen. Nothing, just the awful uncanny smile. I saw one woman wearing modern clothes once, but I never saw her again. I don't know where she went. 

Sometimes I pass the BB Inn again. Different angle. Different sign. Same crooked smile in the window. Every time I pass, I feel more like I belong here. The lines are starting to stick. And the next time someone says 

""Beautiful day isn't it?""

Doing this for free, so show love when you can!

Weather & Monday Rundown:

We’re talking HEAT today. It seems summer has decided to arrive with authority. Expect the sweltering heat and humidity to stick around through Tuesday, with temperatures climbing into the mid to upper 90s. The heat index is the real story, making it feel more like 100 to 110 degrees, especially here in the Champlain Valley. Relief, or what passes for it, won't even come after sundown, as overnight lows will linger in the 70s. A cold front is set to move in late Tuesday, bringing a chance of scattered thunderstorms and finally breaking the oppressive humidity for Wednesday, which should feel somewhat more pleasant with highs in the low 80s. Thursday looks cooler still, in the mid 70s, before some rain returns for the end of the week.

If you’re looking for an air conditioned activity tonight, the City Council is holding a meeting with a pretty packed agenda. They'll be discussing the Great Streets traffic mitigation plan—specifically, whether to reopen Main Street to two way traffic on nights and weekends—and giving a final look at the FY26 budget. There’s also a significant public hearing on the 2025 Action Plan for housing and community development, and a vote on an amendment to the City Place agreement. It’s a full slate, touching on some of the city's most talked about topics, from downtown construction to long term development.

As the heat begins to break midweek, the event calendar really heats up. The Ben & Jerry's Concerts on the Green series continues its strong season with the acclaimed indie artist Waxahatchee at Shelburne Museum tonight. On Wednesday, the series brings a double bill of Peach Pit and Briston Maroney, another big draw for the indie and alternative crowd. And for a more family-centric vibe, South Burlington's Nite Out on Thursday at Veterans Memorial Park features the band Sticks and Stones, a fleet of food trucks, and a fire show from Cirque de Fuego to cap off the evening.

There’s plenty more happening around town, too. On Tuesday, you can head over to Zero Gravity for a free Bike & Gear Repair Fair, a perfect opportunity to get that finicky derailleur adjusted or a jacket patched up. That same evening, Switchback Brewing is hosting a movie night featuring ""Dazed and Confused"" in their beer garden. Then on Wednesday, you can join the Silent Book Club for a quiet, companionable reading session at Water Works Park—a decidedly low key and lovely way to spend a summer evening by the lake. But, make sure to keep your Thursday open because I have a special event for you! Keep reading…

Burlington is experiencing a heat spike well above its June norms—with highs \~14°F above the average and overnight lows \~13°F above expectations, nearing record levels. After today’s blistering heat, temperatures dip significantly over the next three days, returning closer to seasonal norms.

**Friends Mixer/Meet Up Event** **Thursday** **at the Pinery**

 **(South End Get Down Spot aka Coal Collective. FREE!!)**

I’ve been collecting events for months and months now, and I’ve always wanted to have my own event. So I did some thinking. Think of this event as a space built for making friends; everyone who shows up shares the same hope: **“I want to meet someone I’d happily stop and chat with if I saw them around town.”**

Being here means you’ve given everyone permission to say hello, and **that shared understanding** does the ice-breaking for you. Bring everybody you want and help make new friends all together, it’s free! The South End Get Down Spot already has an bar, DJ, one food truck, bathrooms, and parking for their Thursday evening hang out. So, it makes it a perfect spot for a community party! Plus, come meet me, the Btown Brief guy, so you can finally put a face to it! Starting Thursday night at 6:45pm.

Now I just have to make it ***fun*** and interesting. Chef, yes Chef, here’s what’s on the hour-and-a-half menu:

* 6:45pm: People come in.
* 7:00pm: Group Rock, Paper, Scissor Tournament (match up with a stranger, best 2/3. Winners raises their hands to play other winner’s until the last 1v1 match-up. Cheer on the person that beats you, then if they get beat, cheer on the person that won)
* 7:15pm: Mingle between games. Grab a drink, check out the other stationary icebreakers, say hello to someone new, or another group of people.
* 7:30pm: Group Scattegories (Split into 4–6-person teams, 3–5 squads total. I call a category + letter, and hit a 60-second timer; teams shout ideas while one writer scribbles. Time’s up—cross out duplicates; most unique answers wins.)
* 7:45pm: Mingle again. Check out the other stationary icebreakers, say hello to someone new, or another group of people.
* Venue closes at 9. I’ll be packing my stuff up sometime in between!

**Stationary Icebreakers Include:**

**Cornhole** – casual bag-toss duels. **Giant Jenga** – build, wobble, crash. **Cards / Uno** – quick hands when seats open. **Community Map** – pin “best sunset” spots & more, trade stories. **Question Tokens** – pull a coin, ask its icebreaker. **Burlington Bluff** – 3 local “facts,” vote on the lie. **Two-Minute Portraits** – strangers sketch each other, big reveal. **Paper Plane Toss** – 30 second folds, variety of planes to choose, longest flight wins. I have more ideas to rotate in, and would love to make it a weekly or bi-weekly event; so show me you’re interested!

# Also, coming soon:

What if meeting new people in Burlington was easier? I'm launching an idea to make that happen. Soon, you'll be able to sign up to meet a small group of strangers in your age range for coffee or a drink. Just fill out a quick poll with your age range and when you're free. I'll handle the rest, organizing you into groups of **six**, and sending you each the time+location. Plus, you'll already have something in common to talk about: the Btown Brief! Keep an eye out for the sign-up. Let’s turn this newsletter into a culture!

[**Shelburne Museum to break ground on $14M Indigenous arts center**](https://www.wcax.com/2025/06/20/shelburne-museum-break-ground-14m-indigenous-arts-center/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-june-23rd)

“The more people we teach, the more knowledge that’s out there, and then we’re not living in a life where there’s so much people not knowing and ignorance that’s actually been in the state and around us for a long time.,” said Chief Brenda Gagne of the St. Francis-Sokoki Band of the Abenaki Nation of Missisquoi, per WCAX.

This is a significant and long-awaited development for one of the area's premier cultural institutions. The 11,000 square foot Perry Center for Native American Art aims to provide a dedicated space for Indigenous art and education, developed in collaboration with local tribal leaders. The project, expected to be completed in early 2027, represents a major step toward elevating and honoring the region's Indigenous heritage.

[**Vt.-based Gardener’s Supply files for bankruptcy**](https://www.wcax.com/2025/06/23/whats-next-gardeners-supply-after-bankruptcy-filing/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-june-23rd)

""In a statement on Monday to WCAX News, Gardener’s Supply blamed a post-pandemic downturn in business, saying, 'Despite cost-cutting measures, the challenges posed by increased competition, rising shipping expenses, tariffs, and escalating marketing costs have proven insurmountable.'” per WCAX.

The Chapter 11 filing of the Vermont-based, employee-owned company has raised concerns about the fate of its retail locations and employees' stock. An Indiana-based catalog business, Gardens Alive!, is expected to purchase the company in what's described as a ""going-concern sale,"" meaning the operations will likely continue. For now, the company has stated that business will carry on as usual for customers while the sale is finalized.

[**Cooling shelters opening as dangerously hot weather rolls in**](https://www.wcax.com/2025/06/22/cooling-shelters-opening-dangerously-hot-weather-rolls/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-june-23rd)

""In Burlington, locations include: Fletcher Free Library... Core at the One Center... a shade tent in City Hall Park... The Sharon Bushor Conference Room... The COTS Daystation... CVOEO Community Resource Center... and The Vermonters for Criminal Justice Reform Office."" per WCAX.

With heat index values soaring past 100 degrees, the city and local organizations have established several cooling centers to provide relief. These locations offer a vital service, especially for vulnerable residents without access to air conditioning. It’s a practical reminder of the public health challenges extreme weather poses and the community infrastructure required to respond.

[**Plastic Bag Use Dropped 91 Percent After Ban, UVM Study Finds**](https://www.sevendaysvt.com/news/uvm-study-plastic-bag-use-dropped-91-percent-after-ban-43834522?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-june-23rd)

“The transition from plastic to paper was quite minimal, and what we saw was people switching from single-use options to something else,” said UVM researcher Emily Belarmino, per Seven Days.

Five years after Vermont banned single use plastic bags, a University of Vermont study confirms the policy's effectiveness. The dramatic reduction shows a significant shift in consumer behavior, with most people opting for reusable bags rather than simply switching to paper. The findings suggest that the fee and ban combination has been a successful model for reducing plastic waste, a point of pride for a state that often leads on environmental initiatives.

[**Court favors Wheeler Park project in appeal**](https://vtdigger.org/2025/06/23/court-favors-wheeler-park-project-in-appeal/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-june-23rd)

""The decision issued last month affirms the Vermont Environmental Court’s decision that also favored the development following a six-day trial last summer."" per The Other Paper.

The Vermont Supreme Court has sided with developers planning 32 mixed housing units next to South Burlington's Wheeler Nature Park, a decision that upholds earlier court rulings. Neighbors who appealed the project cited concerns over aesthetics, blasting, and the loss of a scenic view, arguing the land was intended for conservation. This ruling marks another chapter in a long legal history surrounding the park and adjacent parcels, though appellants have already filed a motion to have the case reargued.

[**Vt. district ends school early due to hot weather**](https://www.wcax.com/2025/06/23/vt-district-ends-school-early-due-hot-weather/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-june-23rd)

“We didn’t want to have the kids in these hot buildings for these next couple of days. Don’t think anyone would be doing much learning, and certainly wouldn’t be excited about sweating all day,” said School Superintendent Steven Dellinger-Pate, per WCAX.

Students in the Washington Central Unified Union School District got an early start to their summer vacation, as officials canceled the last two days of school due to the extreme heat. Since the district's students had already met the state's required 175 days of instruction, the administration decided it was safer to close. The move highlights the challenges that aging school infrastructure, much of which lacks air conditioning, faces with increasingly hot weather.

# Volunteer Opportunities Highlight: American Cancer Society

There are ***so*** many volunteer opportunities near Burlington! And a great way to meet people, and make new friends. This week I choose to highlight:

**Road to Recovery: Give a Ride, Change a Life**  
Help make sure no one misses a cancer treatment because they couldn’t get there. The American Cancer Society’s *Road to Recovery* program is looking for volunteers in Chittenden and Washington County to give patients free rides to and from treatment. It’s a simple but powerful way to support someone during one of the hardest times of their life. Volunteers must be 18–84 with a valid driver’s license. Learn more at [cancer.org/drive](https://cancer.org/drive?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-june-23rd) or call 1-800-227-2345.

# 202+ Things to Do in Burlington (Summer Activities)

Today’s picks:

Five more ways to keep things interesting while the days are still long and warm. Head out to Colchester Pond for a calm paddle or a walk around the perimeter trail, where it’s just you, the birds, and the water. Stop in at August First for a pastry on their sunny patio, a perfect place to slow down for a bit and watch the world go by. Take a late afternoon trip to Lone Rock Point and sit on the cliffs for a quiet view of the lake and mountains—bonus if you catch golden hour. Wander the Pine Street corridor and see what’s new at the local shops and studios, especially in the Soda Plant. And when you’re ready for something simple, pack a picnic and spend the evening lounging at Waterfront Park as the sun sets.

Full list’s always waiting here when you need a plan: [https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/c/202-activites](https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/c/202-activites)

# This Week’s Restaurant Review: Farmhouse Tap & Grill

A cornerstone of Burlington’s farm-to-table scene, the Farmhouse Tap & Grill on Bank Street has cemented itself as a downtown institution. Housed in a cleverly renovated former McDonald's, the gastropub buzzes with a constant, lively energy, drawing in everyone from beer aficionados to families. The rustic-chic interior is warm and inviting, though its popularity often means the main dining room is bustling and loud. For those seeking a different vibe, the seasonal outdoor beer garden provides a more relaxed setting, while the downstairs Parlor offers a cozier escape.

The menu is a testament to Vermont’s agricultural bounty, with the LaPlatte River Angus Farm beef burgers rightfully earning their city-wide praise. These aren't your average pub burgers; they are thoughtfully constructed, often featuring local standouts like Vermont Cabot cheddar. Beyond the burgers, the kitchen delivers consistent, elevated comfort food, from the savory blue cheese garlic toast to a fresh New England raw bar. The main attraction for many, however, is the tap list—an expertly curated and extensive selection of Vermont’s most sought-after craft beers that has earned the bar widespread recognition.

Still, the very elements that define the Farmhouse experience can be a double-edged sword. The commitment to high-quality, local ingredients is reflected in the price point, which is a noticeable step up from a casual pub meal and may not fit every budget. The restaurant’s energetic atmosphere, while vibrant and fun, can easily feel crowded and may not be the best choice for an intimate or quiet conversation, especially during peak hours. Despite these considerations, Farmhouse Tap & Grill remains a great spot for a reliably delicious, locally-sourced meal and arguably one of the best draft lists in town.

Outside of cosplay as Eddie Munson from Stranger Things, Leon from Resident Evil along others, I take pride in dressing well, staying active with workouts, and—believe it or not—entering raffles and sweepstakes, which I tend to win more often than I should. Life’s been an interesting ride, including being featured on the local news for my fandom passions.

I’m looking to meet a woman who’s into nerdy things, likes to travel, and wants to build a meaningful connection. Cosplay is totally optional—it’s more about sharing good vibes, geeking out, and seeing where things go. A casual coffee would be a great start if you’re local.

Dishes in both sinks every surface in the kitchen with spills on it even the coffee bar, open food left in fridge, and dog bowls on the floor with food and scraps scattered all around the bowls on the floor, and the doggie door flap broken. It's very disappointing. This is the first unclean guest I've had in only 6 months of hoting. Had they actually said they had a pet and paid the pet fee it wouldn't be so bad, but they said nothing and didn't pay it. I haven't left a review so I cannot see their review yet, but I am very nervous. What should I do? Should I tell Airbnb they had a pet and ask for that charge to be put on? Should I leave a mediocre review for her? Should I just clean it all up and ignore it and move on thankful that nothing was too damaged that was very expensive other than the doggie door I have to replace? I have not had a bad experience yet and I do not want this to go south because I'm brand new. Help. I feel like with breaking the flap off the doggie door they should at least pay the pet fee which is currently $99, but I'm considering lowering it to half of that.

1liw8nn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1liw8nn,I built an app to read the news to help me save time and keep on top of the news,"Hello Reddit,

In the past few months, I've released and continuously updated a news aggregator app called [Newsreadeck](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/newsreadeck/id1593025917). I enjoy starting my day with coffee and news from various sources, but most similar apps are focused on English and cater primarily to U.S. users.

Initially, I tried using RSS feeds, but many websites don't provide them, and manually creating or finding these feeds was tedious. Additionally, most news apps restrict article access, bombarding users with ads, suggested articles, and irrelevant information.

To tackle these issues, I developed my own data sources. I've compiled over 16,000 curated sources, categorized by language, location, and topic, which I monitor for reliability. The app lets you discover and follow sources without limits, providing seamless access to articles. I also built a custom reader to remove ads, banners, and distractions, though some paywalls may still appear.

Following multiple sources can lead to unwanted articles. With the app, you can mute words, mute sources, or create a custom reading list by grouping channels, keeping your news feed clean and relevant.

If you want to stay informed and save time by avoiding distractions,[ feel free to download the app from the App Store.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/newsreadeck/id1593025917) :)

For instance, what under extracted coffee tasted like, and what would fix the issue. 

I recently made a cup that was very dry and tasted like cardboard. When I kept looking at papery tasting coffee, all the reasons for it came back to the filter and it needing to be rinse. However, rinse is a normal step in my workflow and there’s no way I missed it in two cups, so I was confident this wasn’t the issue because it was in two separate cups.

1liw4h5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Idaho/comments/1liw4h5/update_trip_to_idaho_on_sunday/,Update: Trip to Idaho on Sunday.,"I made a post last week about how I was visiting Idaho on Sunday. I just wanted to update on what happened. Sorry that I don't have much to say about Idaho and more about Utah and Montana.

 Here's the link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Idaho/comments/1lfmkir/comment/myqco1r/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Idaho/comments/1lfmkir/comment/myqco1r/?context=3)

Saturday: I drove into Utah, Salt Lake City. I said Idaho interests me more than Utah and it still does. However, having never been to Utah, I was pretty mesmerized by how it looks. Salt Lake City and Provo. Amazing views. I want to see more. I got breakfast at a place called Eggs In The City. 

  
On Sunday, I took I-15 into Idaho. I passed through Woodruff, Malad City and had a nice mountain view. I stopped in Pocatello and had breakfast at Elmer's. It was a very good breakfast and the coffee was great. Pocatello is a nice 60K population mountain town. I may come back and visit again.

I decided to keep driving north on I-15 and stopped in Idaho Falls for some gas. I didn't venture much around here, honestly. I wanted to drive because I really only had a day or so and Montana was on my mind. I stayed on I-15, which turned into route 20 heading into West Yellowstone. I got a nice road view of Targhee National Forest. 

As I was approaching Montana, I realized that it was my kind of weather: Cloudy and rainy! I eventually think I saw some sleet and little snowflakes. I was getting really happy because I love that kind of weather. And guess what? It did snow! It was like Christmas in June! Big snowy snowflakes that stick to your face! As I kept driving and approached the Idaho-Montana line, I took a bunch of photos and videos because IT WAS SNOWING! Snow all over. I was very happy. And cold while wearing short sleeves. 

That was mainly it for Idaho. I know I stuck to the main road and didn't really see MUCH scenic things, but I can see myself coming back and driving throughout the state and stopping to smell the roses so to speak. I really liked Pocatello. I'm drawn to that town. I want to see venture throughout and see all the little towns and such.

I don't think I should talk about Montana too much because this is an Idaho thread. But let me just say that West Yellowstone Montana had a good coffee shop named Mountain Mama's Coffeehouse (the clerk gave me a free coffee!), it was snowing when I entered the coffee shop and 15 minutes later when I exited, it was sunny. I stayed on Route 90 to Billings and thought it was a decent view, but wasn't too impressed, honestly. I didn't stay too long in Billings and didn't explore much....but I thought Billings was a little underwhelming just passing through (Sorry, Montana). I need to go back and visit this state like I'm gonna do with Idaho because I think I'd like it if I found another mountain town that's cold.

He is by far the kindest and most honest person I have ever met in my 30 years of living. Life has not been kind to me, and dealt me my fair share of less than kind individuals (sadly, my own family members are included in this), but at no given moment have I ever doubted my love for this man, nor his sincerity, and I never will. We were instant best friends from the day we met, and have actually lived together since knowing each other since we met as roommates. It just made sense after cherishing everyday we had with each other, and now over a year later here we are in our own little place. I couldn’t ask for more. However, even paradise has its flaws. I do not love my husband any less for this terrifying habit of his, but it is a rather large concern of mine. My husband is incredibly tall, built like a quarterback, which doesn’t help the fact that he is ridiculously clumsy. Bumping into damn near everything within his vicinity, knocking items over, you name it. Knocking over things here and there is fine. Breaking a cord by tripping on it? That’s fine, I have plenty. Knocked a glass over and it shatters to pieces? Well at least no one got hurt; we can replace the cup. But when these things happen over, and over, and over, and over again, it starts to make you lose your mind a little. It doesn’t help that we aren’t exactly in the money, so having to replace whatever he breaks or shatters really costs us. I’ve said before that he since this is something that happens almost routinely, that he needs to be a little more careful then he has been either handling things, or have a little more spacial awareness. It may sound insensitive, but he always brushes off every incident as simple clumsiness. But when it happens constantly, and I mean CONSTANTLY, can you really just write it off like that? It also scares me because we want to start a family together, but his carelessness has the capacity to hurt our children. I can’t help but think: what if he drops our kid?, what if he rounds a corner of the house and he just cracks their head against it?, what if he spills boiling water on them? I try not to think in situationally as it’s not fair to him, but it’s really starting to add up and get to me. Just now was the tipping point as he went to get up and smacked a cup of red juice with a couch pillow all over our coffee table. All I could do was curse (not at him, just like if you stubbed your toe on a table leg) while promptly grabbing a bunch of things to clean it up before it could spread. Now he’s upset with me and how I reacted, and won’t even stand in the same room as me. I don’t want to react so viscerally, but it’s just so frustrating and genuinely terrifying. I feel so hurt because I don’t want to make him feel bad for always breaking things or knocking things over, but it’s become a chronic problem. I’m at my wits end about this and don’t know what to do.",1,1750721825.0,TrueOffMyChest,7,0.55,False
1liw2k2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1liw2k2/avoidant_bf_26m_vs_anxious_gf_23f/,avoidant bf (26M) vs anxious gf (23F),"hi all. burner account. i need some advice majorly. i (23F) have been dating my boyfriend (26M) officially since March (3 months) but acted like bf/gf since january, been talking since mid october. we matched on hinge and i really wasn’t looking for anything serious. we talked for a few weeks before going out on a date and just kept seeing each other since.  when we first started talking, he would text back way more frequently, and he was over the top with his comments. he was offering to bring me soup when i was sick before we had even met, complimenting my looks like crazy, and being super sympathetic and encouraging when id talk about something in my life that was annoying me. at the time we started talking, he had just moved back from a city (where he went to college and worked after college) to where he’s from originally, which is where i go to school. his job was removing his department basically and gave him and the others he worked with an opportunity to change departments or to take the severance pay, which he did and moved back home because he hated the city which he was working. so when we first started talking, he was super relaxed, had the severance pay, not much going on work/stress related. things got a bit intense once he  started applying to jobs again, and now he has a good job. he is in finance and i’m going to school to be a doctor, so completely opposite spectrums. he is saving up money at the moment and is staying with one of his parents as they have an extra room as opposed to pouring it all into rent, as he’d like to accumulate some funds before being forced into monthly payments. (so, no, none of this has to do with his income. he’s very smart financially, obviously, and as you all know, the housing market is ridiculous right now). 
i have a very anxious attachment style. it gets worse at night. we are very different in a lot of ways. i have an anxious attachment style, and id bet money my boyfriend has avoidant. my last relationship prior to this (3 years) was extremely healthy, we just grew apart, and were on about of good as terms as exes can be. so, being in that relationship, really suppressed my anxious attachment style i think. 
as i said, my current bf and i are very different. im smart, dont get me wrong, but i cant help but think with my heart. im extremely idealistic and believe the best in every situation. i like to have a set plan for when i am going to see him next or about plans oriented with my friends, but at the same time am very much the type of person thats like “hey, let’s travel to europe and get hotels, we can figure out what we’re gonna do when we get there!” he is the opposite of this. likes a plan, likes to know whats going on. he likes simplicity. (i do think he has OCD, but not confirmed). i’m also the type of person that values memories and experiences more than anything. i don’t care about material goods, id rather spend my money going to a concert with the people i care about. he’s the opposite, thinking it’d better to save money or that money should be put into something with longevity, as opposed to a trip or event. 
i apologize for the length of this, im just trying to give as much insight and detail as possible. 
that being said, i really love him. i want to text him all the time, see him all the time. but i feel like he doesn’t act this same initial way as when we first started dating, which i heard is sort of a common thing with people with an avoidant attachment style. when i asked him about if once, he made remarks that when we first started talking, he didn’t know as much about me aside from surface level things and my looks, so he praised my looks. he said now that he knows me on such a deeper and emotional level and cares for me so much more than he did then, that he talks about other stuff. which ok. i completely understand. 
just overall though, he texts less. his texts are more blunt and dry cut. 
when we first had arguments, they were brutal. i thought i was being so healthy by stating what my problem or issue was or why i was upset, how it made me feel and why, and i thought i was being open and transparent. it took me a long time to figure out that was making it seem like to him that i was targeting him, so he would get extremely defensive and ball up and would be blunt with his responses, which obviously upset me more , and the situation would escalate from something that should have never been an argument into something that made me feel so physically nauseous and ill. 
as of recently, we were  supposed to go on a trip for a weekend to a city about seven hours away, from Friday to Sunday, and it would be us as well as five of my other friends and their boyfriends, and he has met them all, but they’re my friends and not his. I asked him when he was a guest at a wedding and he said yes, and then we later talked about it, and he said that he probably couldn’t because his company would start the testing of their new program around that time, and he didn’t know what his work schedule would look like, and said I should go without him, which I said I didn’t want to do because I didn’t want to be the only one without my significant other there, and I know that I would feel upset and jealous, and that I probably wouldn’t have the best time. 
He took that as me trying to guilt trip him into it, which I was not trying to do, I was just trying to work out a situation that could accommodate for him to go, and if not that we could talk it through, but he eventually said yes, we will go because his family vacation is the week after.  
fast-forward about two weeks and we are discussing about how stuff might get difficult with the fact that I am starting the hardest year yet of my schooling, taking over 30 credits, and his company is starting a new testing and he is also studying for the CPA soon, and we were talking about how we really need to communicate with each other if we want this to work out, because we both said that we have. I know it is very soon, but he has told me that he sees himself marrying me multiple times, and I know that he cares because of how many arguments we have gone through where I probably put him through the ringer because of my anxious attachment style, because I type super long paragraphs because I am trying to be clear about how I am feeling, and what I need from him, but this is the worst thing to do to an avoidant attachment style person. 
He basically told me he was super anxious about the trip and he’s now not going, which I said, I wish we had figured that out before we paid the money and it was the week before, and he brought up that I was guilt tripping him, which was not my intention, but rather just trying to be clear about my feelings and my opinion. 
He also has a family vacation the following week, which he had made multiple comments about bringing me on  the months prior, saying things like “oh you’ll meet so and so when we go to my family’s house for the fourth” or “you’ll see this when we go on my family’s vacation for the 4th.” this made me feel super wanted, and included, and appreciated.  (background, he just met my parents beginning of june and i haven’t met his. i met his brother very briefly mid june) (also, his parents are divorced). for the past month, he stopped saying stuff like this about his family vacation where I was included, and would say things implying that only he was going. I brought it up and basically he said that reality kind of hit him with how soon it is coming up, and that the women in his family can be b**chy  (especially with drinks) and have not been welcoming to his exes in the past. he said that he would hate to bring me there and for then me to say why the heck would you bring me there and put me in this situation, and doesn’t want me to feel like crap.  he then said “Because I love you and would love you there to meet some people in my family and it’s a beautiful town” when I asked then why he would even bring it up in the first place. he then proceeded to say yeah come up, i was trying to protect you, so if they are mean to you or make you feel uncomfortable like you can’t blame me for it and get mad at me for it. 
The argument was longer than this, and unfortunately was heated because again, as I said, we just keep escalating each other. 
I would’ve liked to felt like I was invited and like I had the option. 
It makes me overthink like crazy, thinking that his past two exes both went on the trip  (his most recent relationship ended sometime 2022). I don’t know if they had known his dad, or some of his siblings, or anyone else in the family prior to going on the vacation, but it hurts that they were invited and I wasn’t.  
It is so easy for me to overthink and to get in my own head.  
I crave reassurance so much, and I am struggling so much because of my anxious attachment style, and I don’t know what to do .  
I would’ve liked to have been invited and felt like I was wanted there with him, actually asking me and letting me make the decision on my own. He told me that he thinks that I would do the best there out of all of his exes, so I still don’t understand why not invite me.  or ask me. 
I want to just dump all of my emotions and fears and thoughts on him and just tell him that I need reassurance on every little thing, but I know I can’t do that because that’s the literal worst thing to do to someone with an avoidant attachment style, but at the same time I am struggling so much. 
It is so easy for me to overthink so much, even though he has said to me numerous things to prove his love to me and also has done many things to prove his love to me. This post is still not giving enough insight into our life and our relationship, and is only highlighting the bads but because that’s what I need help with. so please, before everyone is rude in the comments, please understand that this is still not the entirety of the situation, and that I have feelings and that I am going through a lot, and don’t need to hear rude comments about him or about myself. I am here because, well, it’s reddit. 
to highlight some of the positives: 
- always pays for dinner, coffee, etc. i’ve paid for dunkin once and our breakfast bagels once. over the course of 8-9 months. 
-he comes to my place every weekend. 
-we cook together, he buys the groceries. 
-he picked up my online order of groceries (after waiting for them for an hour) and brought them to my place when i was sick. 
-he picked me up bc i was hammered at a school related event (im super small and hadn’t had anything to eat that day, oops) driving 35 mins to my event, picking me up with a bag for me to vomit in and a bottle of water, took me back to my place, helped me change and stayed with me all night. 
-was about to drive 2.5 hours one way to pick me up from the airport and 2.5 hours back (but luckily my flight was changed) 
-babysat my 3 cats (2 of which are kittens,) for 4 days 
he puts up with all of our fights. even though they get bad.  
i’m the person who saves every animal and critter on the side of the road. he’s not that person. but we were talking about it and was saying yeah no we’re not doing that when we’re older. so i got upset. we were cleaning after dinner and he went to the bathroom and i was still putting stuff on the dishwasher, and he saw that i was still kinda upset (wine influence for sure! ) and he said “ i am going to marry you someday. listen look at me. if we are driving and we see a one legged mink of a two legged bear or a four legged cat and it has disabilities i promise we will stop and pick it up. that’s not who i am but if it makes you happy it makes me happy. because i want you to be happy. i will do anything to make you happy. if it makes you happy it makes me happy because i always want you happy. okay? i promise you “. 
so please don’t come at this situation guns a blazing. i love him. and i know he loves me. even if he doesn’t always show it in the way i want. I just need genuine opinions and help and support. you have all been in the situation where you have been struggling in a relationship, so please take that into consideration when you are commenting, because mean comments aren’t going to do anything to help me. I need genuine help and   advice. 
I just hate that anytime I bring something up as a discussion that escalates into an argument. I don’t know what to do because as an anxiously attached person, all I want to do is talk about my feelings and my thoughts, and to work it out in the moment, which I know is the worst thing to do to someone who is avoidant, bombarding them only makes stuff worse.  I don’t know how we can come to a spot where we can discuss things without it escalating and where I can bring up what I am feeling and thinking and talk about how I need reassurance without him taking it personally or in a bad way, because I know he doesn’t think how I do. 
The situation with the family lake house is also really bugging me and i could really use advice and input on that. i struggle so much with this. thank you for taking the time to read this. ",0,1750721806.0,relationship_advice,0,0.5,False
1liw1w6,https://www.reddit.com/r/uktravel/comments/1liw1w6/help_me_plan_a_day_in_newcastle_upon_tyne/,Help me plan a day in Newcastle upon Tyne,"Thanks in advance. I plan to start my U.K. holiday this year by flying into Manchester and then taking a train from Manchester airport to Newcastle city centre and will stay at the Mile Castle hotel. Arrival day will be from an overnight flight from the USA so I won’t make any plans for that day.

My first full day will have me taking a full day trip to Durham.

My question is for the second day. I really like being in Newcastle but it doesn’t seem likes there’s too much of tourist interest actually in the city. I love the castle and cathedral and could happily see them again. 

What do you think I should seek out and can you talk me into perhaps even another day in Newcastle?

My interests include art, reading, coffee, history, football, politics, economics, and I’m a gay male so I do like the LGBT nightlife in Newcastle.

After reading the guidelines I feel like I am in the wrong place. Basically, I prefer espresso, so regular coffee or Nespresso won’t cut it. I want to brew 2-4 shots, toss in some milk, and call it a day. Currently, coffee is my largest monthly expense outside of living expenses. Two lattes a day is about 15/day or 450/mo. 

Any recommendation is helpful for a machine [$500], grinder, or beans.

If whole beans are significantly cheaper to grind a home, then I’ll probably need something for that too. Any information or suggestions are helpful.

The only reason I haven’t bought a machine sooner is because I couldn’t figure out what type of coffee beans I needed, if there were specific beans for espresso or if they were regular coffee beans? Either way, ground or whole, shoot me some recommendations and I’ll go from there.

Thank you for your time, advice, and recommendations in advance!",2,1750721741.0,espresso,5,1.0,False
1liw140,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Lazy_Palpitation_517/comments/1liw140/free_regular_fries/,Free regular fries...,"That was what brought me into Captain Cluckey's that evening. I stood there in line behind two middle aged women who were taking a rather long time to place their order. Where is my mind by the Pixies played over the restaurant speakers. Over the music I could hear the man in the dirty ragged clothes out front, still yelling about the end of days. I did my best to ignore him, just like everyone else. I turned back to look out the window, past the ragged man and across the street to the bus station. I thought about how I should have been out of this backwoods town and on my way back to Chicago by now. Unfortunately, my car had broken down a mile outside of the town of Pleasence. The town mechanic said he could have the part in sometime next week, but I had no intention of hanging around that long. Double unfortunately, the bus to the city didn't run until the next morning. So, for the time being, I was marooned there. 

 I glanced down at the receipt in my hand, the attached coupon read, Free regular fries with next purchase. I had gotten a Clucky combo meal earlier that day and with nothing else to do, I decided to grab my extra fries and loiter around town till morning. I was low on cash, so a room at the local motel wasn't in the cards. 

I checked my watch, 7:35PM. “Only about 13 hours to go.” I thought to myself. I glanced up to the ladies ahead of me, still talking over their order. The door chimed behind me and a group of teenagers came in, laughing and talking loudly. I gave them a cursory glance and noticed one of them wore clothes that weren't quite in the style of the others, an old letterman jacket and jeans instead of the tee shirts and shorts the others wore. I noticed the bruising on his throat and made a note to myself to not make eye contact with that particular young man. I was sandwiched between the two chatty Kathys and the obnoxious teenagers and my social anxiety was climbing to a fever pitch. Not only that, but the nicotine itch was beginning to set in. I shrugged to myself and stepped out of line; I was in no hurry after all.  

Stepping out into the warm summer evening, I looked up orange and purple sky. The sky seemed so clear out here away from the city. I pulled my crumpled pack of cigarettes out of the pocket of my thrift store Hawaiian shirt as the ragged man continued his tirade a few feet away from me. I lit my cigarette and continued to ignore him. After a moment he noticed me and stepped over, directly in front of me.  

“THEY ARE HERE! YOU ALL MUST LEAVE THIS PLACE! DON’T YOU UNDERSTAND? THEY ARE BENEATH US! THEY ARE AMONG US! AND THEY WILL COME FOR YOU ALL! YOU THINK YOU KNOW THE TRUTH; YOU THINK YOU KNOW WHAT COMES AFTER BUT YOU ARE ALL WRONG! ALL OF YOU! THEY WILL DEVOUR YOU! THEY WILL HOLLOW YOU OUT AND FILL YOU WITH HATRED AND ROT! ROT! ROT! 

I inhaled the smoke and focused on the setting sun, doing my best to ignore the man's putrid breath as he screamed in my face. I exhaled and watched the smoke drift through the man's face before calmly moving to lean against the restaurant wall. I didn't react to the man, didn't acknowledge him. I couldn't, if I did, he would never leave me alone. Eventually he went back to his place on the sidewalk and started his speech all over again. I glanced over at him, standing there shouting, begging to be heard, preaching his heart out to an absent congregation. I pitied him, what he was. I wondered at the circumstances that brought him to that place.  

After smoking another cigarette and doom scrolling on my phone for a few minutes, I went back inside and found that the line had dissipated. The cashier from earlier was gone, replaced by a pimple faced kid with a name tag that read, Jimmy. His head hung low as I approached the counter. Probably looking at his phone, I thought. 

“Welcome to Captain Cluckey's, how may I help you?”  

His voice carried such melancholy that I assumed those other teens had been giving the poor kid a hard time.  

“I'll take a small soda and a free regular fries.” I said laying the coupon on the counter.  

The kid looked up at me slowly, his eyes finding mine and studying me for a moment. Suddenly his mouth dropped open in a dopey smile and he turned and headed back into the kitchen muttering something about being right back. I stood there, confused. “The hell was that about?” I wondered.  

After a few minutes, the cashier from earlier came out from the kitchen and saw me. 

“Sorry about the wait sir, what can I get you?” He said stepping up to the counter. 

I squinted and looked back to the kitchen, “What happened to the other guy?”  

“Other guy?” He asked. “What other guy?” 

Then it hit me. “Shit.” I muttered under my breath. 

I glanced around the restaurant. The chatty Kathys were nearby, watching me curiously. From their point of view, I had just placed my order to thin air. So, I looked like a crazy person. That was fine, maybe I was. Who the fuck cares? 

I looked back to the group of teens, they were still in their own world, still being obnoxious. But the out of place one, he was watching me now. I did my best not to meet his eyes, but I knew he could see me. He knew I could see him. I fucked up. 

“Looks like it's time to go.” I thought. I turned to head for the door and saw the ragged man standing outside. I needed to compose myself before leaving, I was rattled. I needed to clear my head; be alone for a moment. In the bathroom I splashed water on my face and studied myself in the mirror. I looked older than my 25 years. My shaggy sandy blonde hair was now streaked with silver, and the lines on my face were more care worn than they once were. 

“Hi there!” Came the voice from behind me.  

Jimmy, the other cashier, was there. I tried to act like I didn't hear him, looked through him when I turned around, tried all the usual tricks. But when I went to open the door, Jimmy stepped in my way, and I hesitated. 

“I know you can see me.” He said, his eyes burrowing into mine.  

Yeah, the jig was up. I do my best to avoid these situations, otherwise they never leave me alone, always seems to be just a little more unfinished business. I sighed, “What do you want?” 

He laughed, “How?” He asked. “How can you see me? Can you see others?” 

I shook my head, “Doesn't matter. I can see you, I can hear you. Tell me what you want or leave me alone.”  

“Okay, Okay.” He said. “I'm sorry, I just... I haven't spoken to anyone in... Well, I'm not sure how long. Your car broke down right? It's a small town, people gossip, and all I can do is listen. Well, until now.” He smiled wide. 

I nodded and made a get on with it motion.  

“Well, there are others here. They want what I want, maybe you can talk to them too? I’ll go...” 

“No!” I demanded, grabbing his arm before he could leave. “No others, that's the deal. You already know, I can't change that. I help you and you never mention this to anyone else. Got it?” 

He stared down at my hand on his arm, “Holy crap, you can actually touch me.” His eyes shot up to mine.  

“Thats the deal, got it?”  

He nodded, “Okay, I mean, yeah deal.”  

I let go of his arm; icy pain was radiating up my arm from my hand. I’ll never get used to how it feels to touch the dead, they have substance but at the same time they don't. Like trying to hold on to frozen mist. 

“So, what do you want?” I asked again. 

He smiled, “Well, my name is Jimmy.” He said pointing at his nametag. “And I was murdered.” He turned to show me a series of stab wounds on his back.  

I nodded, “And you want me to find the killer, right?”  

“Oh, no.” He said, still smiling, “I know who it was. He got away with it, but he died a few months ago. Heart attack, and he saw me as he passed. It was very cathartic.”  

“Okay. So, what do you want?” I asked. 

“Weeell. Here’s the thing, and you might want to brace yourself because this is a big ask... What was your name by the way?” 

“My name is Jonas.” I said. “Now please for the love of God, tell me what you want.” 

“Oh, like the Weezer song, neat. Okay, well here goes. So, the man that killed me, also killed several other people around town, mostly just drifters and the like, no one who would be missed. Only he wasn't the only one. He was actually a member of some kind of cult based here in Pleasence. I'm not sure what their practices or goals are, aside from killing lots of folks. But I do know that whatever they are planning, it will be coming to a head soon. I've heard lots of hushed talk about the new moon and rituals and a lot of other such stuff. I think they want to open some kind of doorway to somewhere, but I really can't be sure. You really never can tell with these culty types. So, my request is that you, Jonas, seek out the members of this cult and put a stop to whatever they're cooking up.”  

I took a breath and blew out my cheeks. “So, there's a cult?” 

“Yes.” 

“And they are doing something big on the new moon?” 

He nodded, “Correct.”  

“Which is tonight.” 

His smile faltered a little but didn't go away altogether, “Um, I guess so.” 

I leaned back against the sink and crossed my arms, ""So, you want me; one mentally unstable guy, to find and stop a whole ass cult from opening up some kind of doorway or something? And you want me to do it tonight? Like right now? Does that about sum it up?” 

His smile had completely melted away as I laid it all out. He said, “I mean, it sounds like a lot when you say it like that.” 

“Goodbye Jimmy.” I said as I brushed past him and out the door. 

Of course, he followed me, “Hey wait!” He yelled across the restaurant as I made my way to the exit. 

“Don't follow me.” I said over my shoulder. 

“Are you alright sir?” The cashier asked as I passed the counter.  

I ignored him and pushed through the door, also ignoring the still ranting ragged man on the sidewalk. If the kid was right and there really was some kind of cult here, doing something tonight. I wanted to get as far away from here as possible. I was halfway down the block when I heard the dead cashier calling out to me again. 

“I know it's a lot, but what are the odds of you, of all people, showing up here right at this time. Thats either one heck of a coincidence or you are meant to be here. I believe you are here for a reason Jonas.” 

I pulled out my phone and held it to my ear. If anyone happened to be watching, I was just taking a phone call, “I'm here because my car broke down, there is no other reason. Besides even if I wanted to help, it isn't possible. I don't know the first thing about dealing with cults or whatever. Now stop following me.” 

“It is possible if we work together, if we have faith...” 

“Faith?” I laughed, “Faith in what? In people? The universe? “God?” 

“How can you not have faith? With your gift...”  

“Gift? My Gift?” I said, cutting him off. “You wanna talk about gifts, about beliefs?” I shook my head, “Let me tell you a story. See, the original owner of the house I grew up in fell asleep with a lit cigarette in his hand. The house was almost a total loss, but my folks happened to come along and got the place for a steal. Would you like to take a guess which room he died in?” I asked. “Every night he stood the foot of my bed, tears running down burnt and blackened cheeks, going on and on about how he was a good Christian. How he shouldn't still be here. And when he found out I could see him...” 

“What happened?”  

“He screamed, raged, begged me to help him, demanded I help him.” 

“And did you?” 

“I was 9 years old. What the fuck could I have done?” 

Jimmy said nothing so I continued, “It wasn't long after that, he realized he could make physical contact with me.” 

Jimmy winced. 

“Yeah, now he had someone to take out all his anger and frustration on.” 

“Didn't you tell your parents?” He asked. 

“Of course I did, and they sent me to therapy. And therapy led to doctors, which led to medication, then to psyche wards. No one believed me. Do you have any idea how many people die in those places? Do you think they move on when they do?” I shook my head, “I just thought the burned man was bad. Is that your idea of a gift?” 

He began to speak, then trailed off. 

“Yeah, I wouldn't know what to say either. You wanna know what I believe kid? I believe that God, if he's even still around, either hates us or doesn't give a shit about us anymore.” 

‘Thats not true.” He said. 

I chuckled, “Look at yourself kid, if you’re such a faithful believer, then why are you still here?” 

“I don't know!” he shouted, “But there has to be a reason, I have to believe I'm here for something.” 

I shrugged at him and turned to leave. “Sorry, kid. I'm all out of Faith.” 

“Please, Jonas.” He continued. “Fine, don't do it for me, or faith or God or any of that. Do it for the innocents that haven't died yet.  Please help me stop them from killing anyone else.” 

I stopped. I didn't want to deal with this, didn't want to know about some cult in the middle of nowhere. But now I did, and if he was right, people could die tonight, innocent people. How would I feel if I could have stopped it and didn't? What would that kind of decision do to whatever is left of my own soul. Shouldn't I at least look into it and see if anything can be done. I sighed, “God dammit.”  

Jimmy smiled when I turned around. 

“Where and when is this ritual happening?” I asked. 

“So, you'll help?” 

“I don't know. I don't know if there's anything I can do. But I have nothing else to do and nowhere to go so I might as well check it out. So, where's it happening?” 

He shrugged, “I don't know for sure where, but it has to be happening soon right?” 

I looked as the last rays of sunlight sank below the horizon, “Yeah, I'd say so. Okay, do you know of any other members of the cult? Where do they live?” 

Jimmy thought for a moment. “I know that Mr. Paterson, the school science teacher, and Greasy Bob, the guy who runs the gas station, are both members. I've heard them discussing some horrible things inside Cluckey's. But I've never been to where they live, you'd have to go without me.” 

“Shit.” Funny thing about ghosts, if they had never been there when they were alive, they can't go there when they're dead. “No, if I'm doing this, I'll need someone watching my back.” 

Just then flashing red and blue lights pulled up next to me and stopped. Jimmy stood there, his legs vanishing into the hood of the town sheriff's car. 

“Evening son.” He said it friendly enough, though he eyed me suspiciously.  

“Evening.” I nodded back in greeting. “What can I do for you officer.” 

He pushed an oversized cowboy hat up on his head, “Well we got a call about somebody out here by the Cluckey's having conversations with himself. Would you happen to know anything about that?” 

I smiled, “Oh yeah, sorry about that. I must look like a crazy person. I was talking on the phone; I have a Bluetooth earpiece.” I said pointing at my ear, which was fortunately covered by my long hair. 

The sheriff nodded, “Oh I see. Well, I suppose that makes a little more sense. Although, you're not from around here, are you? What brings you to town?” 

“No sir, my car broke down and is in the shop here. Should be fixed sometime next week but I'm leaving on the bus in the morning.” 

“Okay, so where are you staying tonight?” He asked. 

I shrugged, “Honestly, I haven't quite figured that out yet.” 

He studied me for a moment, “Well we have a fine motel in town, and if needs be we have a cell or two empty at the station. Come on by, if you can't find somewhere. It aint the Ritz but you won't be on the street.” 

I smiled and nodded, “Thank you sir, I might just do that.” 

He nodded back, “Tell them Sheriff Reed sent you.” And with that, he drove off, leaving me alone again, sort of alone. 

“I got it.” Said Jimmy. “Old Mrs. Thompson. She runs the pharmacy, and she used to give me piano lessons when I was a kid.” 

“And she's part of the cult?” I asked dubiously. 

“I mean, I don't know for sure. But she was always such a hateful woman, and I did see her talking with the science teacher and greasy Bob a few times.” He shrugged, “Although everyone around here talks to everyone at some point, could be just coincidence.” 

“Do we have any other options?” I asked 

He shrugged again, “Not really.” 

“Okay then.” I said, “Let's go see old Mrs. Thompson, the evil pharmacist.” 

 

Ten minutes later, we were standing in front of a large old farmhouse with a long winding fence lined driveway, complete with a dilapidated red barn and grain silo. 

“This is the place.” Said Jimmy. “So, what's the plan?” 

“Does this place look too picture perfect to you?” I asked. 

“What do you mean?”  

I shook my head, “Never mind. So, what happened to Mr. Evil pharmacist?” 

“Oh, he passed years ago. Poor man had a stroke while tending the field.” 

“A stroke huh?” I asked. Turning to look at him halfway up the long dirt drive. 

“Yeah, bless his heart.” 

“I'm guessing you haven't been back here since you died?” 

“No, why?”  

I stopped and pointed towards the barn, “Because he's still hanging from the tree next to the barn.” 

He looked to where I was pointing to see the late Mr. Thompson. He was in fact still there; his hands bound with the same blue nylon rope as was around his neck. His eyes bulged as they followed us up the drive.  

Jimmy’s mouth dropped open in shock, “Well that dirty rotten liar. Why would he go and do a thing like that?” 

“Look again kid, most people don't bother tying their hands to kill themselves.” 

He gasped, “That means...”  

I nodded. 

Jimmy shook his head, “Poor Edgar. Well, that seals it, she has to be one of them.” 

“I think you're right.” I said pointing to the house.  

The old woman stepped out of the front door and walked over to an old pickup; she was wearing some kind of dark cloak or robe. She started the truck, and the headlights illuminated the drive. 

“Get down.” I said as I ducked behind a bush next to the fence line, then realized who I was talking to and mentally kicked myself. I took the kick back when Jimmy did in fact get down behind the bush next to me. 

The truck passed, probably going to wherever the ritual would be taking place. I briefly considered diving into the truck bed as it passed but quickly dismissed the idea. It was moving too fast, and I didn't think I was stealthy enough to get in without making a sound. 

When we were sure the truck was gone, we made our way to the farmhouse. I was hoping I could find some clue as to where the ritual would be.  

Jimmy stepped through the front door and waved to me through the glass; I grinned and flipped him off.  

“Can you see anything?” I asked. 

“I don't know what to look for.” He said waving his arms.  

I sighed, “Are there any schedules or notes stuck to the fridge that say big secret cult thing at this time. Anything like that?” 

“No, nothing here in the front room, which is the only room I have ever been in. Well, and the bathroom one time but I don't think we will find anything in there.” 

“Damn. Okay, I’ll find a way in.” 

I was hoping this was one of those country towns you hear about, where everyone is so friendly they don't even bother locking their doors. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with a locked and deadbolted front and back door. But not totally disappointed, I found one of the side windows had been left cracked open.  

I slid open the window and looked in, it was the kitchen. I climbed inside, careful not to knock over any of the dozens of dishes stacked precariously by the sink. I looked around the kitchen and dining room. Apparently there had been some big feast here, and all of the food was just left out. 

“What the hell?” 

“What is it?” Jimmy called from the front room. 

“Is Mrs. Thompson a bit of a slob?” 

“What? No not at all, she's always been very tidy.” 

 “It looks like she had company, like a lot of company. A big dinner or something but they didn't clean any of it up. All the food and dishes are just left out.” 

“Why would they do that?”  

“I'm not sure, unless they thought there was no need to clean up.” 

“Like they weren't coming back.” Jimmy continued. 

I left the disaster of a kitchen and made my way into the front room. Jimmy was staring out the window at Mr. Thompson, dangling from the tree. 

“Isn't there something you can do for him?” he asked. 

I shrugged, “I don't know, he most likely can't speak, and even if he could, he seems to be bound there.”  

I started searching through the papers on Mrs. Thompsons desk. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Jimmys head sink low. I cleared my throat, “I'm hoping, that stopping whatever his wife is doing will be enough to set him free.” He nodded slightly, and I went back to my search. 

“Anything yet?” Jimmy asked as I came back from searching the bedroom. 

“No.” I grumbled as I plopped down on the couch and pulled out my cigarettes. 

“Oh Mrs. Thompson hates smoking, you shouldn't...” He started then stopped when he saw the look I gave him. He nodded and smiled awkwardly, “Right, evil cult lady. Wish I could have one, really stick it to her.” 

I lit my cigarette and chuckled. “How did you die anyway?” I asked. 

He looked down at his feet for a moment then took a calming breath, “Well, it was a typical Tuesday night for the most part, only we weren't as busy as we usually were. My boss, Dave, told me I could take the night off early. He said he was gonna close soon anyway, had some work to do at the church or something. I thanked him and headed out the door. I had been home for about an hour when I realized that I forgot to clock out. I was tempted to just say “Oh well” and fix my timecard on my next shift... But I always had to be a goody two shoes, that's what my brother used to say anyway.” He took another deep steadying breath before continuing.  “When I walked back into the office to clock out, I noticed the back door was open. I could hear voices but couldn't make them out. So, I got closer and peered out through the open door. Dave was there, but he wasn't alone. Greasy Bob was there, and another man that I didn't know, He was an older man, with white curly hair and dirty clothes. They had him hogtied in the bed on Bobs truck. He looked up at me and moaned something through the duct tape covering his mouth. I don't know what it was, but his eyes pleaded for me to do something. Dave had been telling greasy Bob something about where to take the man, but he stopped at the man's moans for help. They turned around and saw me and I ran, I tried to anyway, but I wasn't quick enough.” He sighed, long and sad, “And that was the end of me.”  

I breathed out a lung full of smoke, “Fuck... I'm sorry.” 

He nodded and continued, “Afterward, when I figured out I was dead, I learned about the cult. Like I said, Mr. Paterson and greasy Bob would come into Cluckey’s and discuss things. And there were always rumors around town about...” He trailed off. 

I looked up at him, “What?”  

“The rumors, I never thought about it until now but...” 

“What rumors Jimmy?” I demanded. 

He was pacing the floor, “The old chapel on the edge of town. When I was a kid the older teens at school always used to tell us stories about it being haunted, but I never really believed any of it.” 

I gave him a look that said, “Really?” 

He shrugged, “Well, that was before. And I still don't think its haunted, I mean maybe it is but that's not all. They used to tell stories about seeing dark hooded figures coming and going from the chapel on certain nights. Holy crap, Jonas. I think that's the ritual site.” 

He smiled and put up his hand for a high five, “come on Jonas, let’s go stop a cult!” 

I grinned and got up, putting my cigarette out on the couch and slapping his hand, “Lets fucking go.” 

We left the Thompson house and headed for the old chapel. I checked my watch, 9:40PM. “Still a couple hours till midnight.” I thought to myself. I had no idea if midnight mattered but it seemed like the time to do culty ritual shit to me. 

 

It took about 25 minutes to walk across town to the old chapel, even at a brisk pace. We were about 100 yards away from the chapel when Jimmy came to a dead stop. 

“What are you doing?” I asked turning back to face him.  

“I can't go any farther.” he said demonstrating by walking forward and not actually moving. “Other kids would go to the chapel on dares, but this is as far as I ever made it.” 

“God dammit.” I muttered, “Okay. Well, I guess I’ll go see what I can do. You stay here and keep a watch out.” 

“For what?” He asked. 

“I don't know, just yell if you see anything.”  

“What are you going to do?”  

I shrugged, “I’ll figure something out.”  

I crouched down in the tall grass by the road and crept up to the big creepy old building. “What the fuck am I doing?” I kept asking myself. 

The old chapel was, old to say the least. It had once been painted white but was now almost all bare wood, only a few chips of paint still clung to the weathered boards here and there. The windows looked like they had all been broken and boarded up, and a faint orange light poured out from between the boards. The steeple stood tall but warped at an odd angle, and the large cross that stood up on it was partially broken off, making it resemble a capital T. 

I could hear hushed voices inside, chanting low and ominously. I crept up to a window and tried to see inside but my view was blocked by old pews shoved against the sides. Through the boards, I could see the ceiling of the chapel, there was a large hole in the roof. If I could get up there, I could get a better view of what was happening.  

I crept my way around to the back of the building and found the old Mrs. Thompson's pickup. Luckily it had been parked right up next to the building. I climbed on top of the truck's cab as quietly as I could, then scrambled my way onto the roof, a little less quietly. The roof boards creaked under my weight, and I held my breath, hoping no one had noticed. When there was no sign of anyone coming to see what the noise was, I made my way further up the roof, crawling on my belly. 

When I reached the edge of the hole, I peered down to see a dozen people. Most of them were dressed in dark robes with hoods up. They walked in a circle around a large pentagram drawn on the floor. Another man stood at the alter holding a large leatherbound book. He wore a white robe and hood. I leaned out to see better and the boards began to creak more. Suddenly they gave way, and I fell down into the midst of them in a heap of rubble, luckily some poor bastard broke my fall.  

The assembled cultists jumped back at my sudden arrival, then one by one, they all gathered round to look down at me. 

“So, I guess this isn't AA?” I said between coughs. 

“You!” Said the man in white, who I guessed was the leader.  

He removed his hood and glared at me; it was Sheriff Reed.  

“Evening again, officer. I think I'll take that cell now.” I said as I climbed to my feet. 

“The son of a bitch killed Bob.” Said one of the cultists behind me. 

“What the hell are you doing here?”  

“I was gonna ask you the same thing?” I said, “But I think I already know.” 

He squinted at me, “Whatever you think you know, you're wrong.” 

“So, you're not trying to open a doorway to hell and let out a whole bunch of nasty shit? Pretty much fucking up the whole world.” 

The cultists around me started muttering to each other. 

“We are doing the world a favor. I know you can't see that, but you will.” He said as a smile spread on his face. “You will soon see firsthand. Since you robbed us of one of our number, your blood will have to do.”  

I looked back to see the cultist I had landed on; his neck twisted at an unforgiving angle. “Oops.”  

“Hold him.” Said the sheriff. 

I looked around and recognized one of the hooded figures approaching me. 

“Hey Mrs. Thompson. Edgar says hello, or at least he would if the rope hadn't crushed his throat.” 

She stumbled back in surprise, “What? How...”  

But I didn't wait for her to finish. My foot shot out, connecting with the nutsack of the man in front of me. He crumpled to the ground as I pivoted and threw a punch at the next cultist, their nose crunched audibly and blood splattered Mrs. Thompson. Unfortunately, that was about all the damage I managed to do. I tried to fight but there were too many. suddenly, something hard impacted the back of my head and the last thought that ran through my head as my vision went dark was, “Well, shit. This is how I die.”  

 

I came to some time later. My hands cuffed around a pillar at the back of the chapel. The cultists were chanting something in some language I couldn't understand, maybe Latin? I wasn't sure. I could feel blood, sticky on the side of my face. I tried to move but the cuffs would let me get far. 

“You’re awake.” said the sheriff. “Just in time.” 

I stood, as well as I could, “In time for what? To watch you fuck up the whole world?” 

“To watch us save it. And you, whoever you are, get to be a part of it. Though you don't deserve it.” 

The sheriff went back to his place behind the alter and raised his hands addressing the assembly. “My friends. Tonight is the long-awaited night. You have all worked so hard to get us to this point and I am so very grateful to you all.”  

The cultists gave polite cheers and applauded. 

“This world is sick my friends, and it will only get sicker. We must stop it. We must bring about the great cleanse.” 

They applauded louder. 

“Just as God cleansed the earth with the great flood, we must now bring upon it the power of the cleansing flame! Only then will the world know true peace and righteousness again!” 

The cultists shouted with joy. 

“The hour approaches, bring out the sacrifice!” 

The cultist came and uncuffed me from the pillar, I tried to get away but it was no use. They drug me to the center of the pentagram. Sheriff Reed approached me, the book and a knife in his hands. 

“You must have really bad luck son. You see, Bob there had volunteered to be the sacrifice. But since you decided to drop in and break his damn neck, looks like you’re it.” 

I squirmed in the cultists grip, “How do you even know this will work? Don't I have to be willing or something?” 

Someone punched me in the gut, causing me to gasp for air. As he approached, he pricked his finger with the knife. My shirt was ripped open and began drawing something on my chest. 

“Doesn't say anything about willing, only that the sacrifice be marked with the sigil. Which now, you are.” 

The sheriff opened the book and began reading a passage. The language he spoke, it made no sense, it hurt my head to hear. My vision blurred and cleared then blurred again. I thought I would pass out, then I saw it. Through the hole in the ceiling of the chapel, stood a huge, emaciated figure. Towering high and blocking out the night sky, its flesh the color of ash. Two massive wings spread out, flexing and stretching, eager to take flight. There were charred and broken skeletons dangling from the thing's coal black antlers. Its face was like that of a jackal and its eyes were deep set and burning with a fire so hot I could feel the heat from them. As it looked down at me, I saw visions of scorched cities and towns, the oceans boiled and the whole world burned. I knew that there would be no peace on earth, there would be nothing left but ash and ruin if this thing got out. I could not let that happen. 

I looked back at Sheriff Reed just in time to see him plunging the knife straight at my heart. I had no other choice. I did something I absolutely hated. Something I had only done once before. I clenched every muscle in my body, and I shifted myself out of the living plane. Every cell in my body screamed out in agonizing pain. It felt like dying, which I guess it kind of was. I could only hold it for a few seconds, but it was enough. The knife passed through me and into the chest of the cultist behind me. I shifted back and fell to the floor, looking back at the cultist with the blade buried in his chest.  

Everyone gasped, the sheriff started to say something but was cut off by the cultists blood curdling scream. His body began to stretch and expand as skin ripped, and bones snapped. Suddenly his eyes caught fire, and his body exploded. Showering everyone with chunks of gore. Just as quickly, the cultist who had been next to him began screaming as his eyes caught fire. I jumped to me feet and ran for the door. I heard the wet pop as the next one exploded and the screaming continued. I shoved through the door and slammed it closed behind me. Maybe I'm an asshole for barring the door shut with them inside. But I did it anyway.  

One by one the screaming stopped, accompanied by the sound of 9 more people exploding from the inside out. Then came a great deep howling roar that seemed to shake the earth, car alarms went off, dogs and coyotes howled in the distance. The tone was so low, I felt like my eardrums would burst. There was the sound of strong winds like a hurricane, heat radiated from the edges of the chapel door. Then all at once the roaring and wind sound faded away into nothing. 

 After a few minutes, when I was pretty sure it was all over, I opened the door and stepped inside. The blood and gore that had to have covered the place was burnt to ash, but the robes lay there still, empty and smoldering but whole. I walked across the floor to what stood at the center of the ash covered room. The book, it completely unharmed. I bent down to pick it up and read the inscription on the cover, Liber Vitae, Mortis et Ultra. “Whatever that means.” I thought. No clue how those yokels got ahold of something like this, but I figured I had better hang on to it. Wouldn't want it to fall into the wrong hands, again. 

Jimmy was standing there waiting for me as I approached, “Jonas! Are you alright? What happened? And what was that thing standing over the chapel? “And why are you covered in blood? Eww” 

I laughed and patted him on the shoulder, “Let's get out of here, I'll tell you on the way.” 

On the way back into town we stopped by a pond where I rinsed the blood off of my shirt and out of my hair, didn't need anyone asking complicated questions. Jimmy was doing enough of that already. I told him what had happened and how I stopped the cult through sheer stupid luck.  

“You mean you went ghost mode?” he asked, grinning like a kid. 

I shook my head, “First off, that's fucking stupid and I'm not calling it that. Second, I really don't know what it is or how I do it. It just seems to be something I can do, though it hurts like hell and I never want to do it again.” 

A firetruck passed as we walked back up the street towards the bus stop, it looked like it was headed for Mrs. Thompsons place.  

We sat together on a bench next to the bus station and talked for a while. Jimmy told me stories about his life growing up in the small town, we laughed and joked together. I wondered to myself what was still keeping him here, I had assumed that once this was over, he could move on.   

It turned out I had been unconscious for longer than I first thought. My watch and phone had broken at some point, so I had no clue what time it actually was. As we sat there talking like two old friends, I could see the first rays of the sun peaking over the treetops. 

Jimmy stopped halfway through a story; his eyes focused on a man a few blocks away. The man was maybe in his mid 50s, with thinning gray hair and a thick mustache. The man stopped to unlock the front door of a hardware store. I looked back to Jimmy and saw tears in his eyes. 

“Your dad?” I asked. 

He nodded, “We had a fight, just before I...”  

Now I understood. 

“I told him I hated him, that I couldn't wait to get away from him. But, I didn't mean any of it, I was just angry.” 

“What was the fight about?” I asked. 

Jimmy shrugged, “I can't even remember, we fought so much about anything and everything, we were just so different. I’d give anything to take it all back.” 

I nodded and got up. 

“What are you doing?” 

I didn't answer, just kept on walking. I stepped through the doors of the hardware store the man had entered and saw him behind the counter a thermos of coffee in one hand and a newspaper in the other.  

“Excuse me, sir.” I said stepping up and clearing my throat. 

He smiled, “Early bird huh? What can I help you with today?” 

“Um, you don't know me, and this is gonna sound a little strange, but I knew your son, Jimmy.” 

He blinked and looked me over, “Okay.”  

“I just wanted to tell you that he was a good friend. He had a great heart, and he spoke very fondly of you.” 

The smiled sadly, “You must not have known him too well. We didn't really get along, especially near the end.”  

“Everyone has rough patches, that's part of life. He loved you; he may not have shown it at the time. But he always loved you.” 

There were tears in the man's eyes, but he held them back as he nodded again. “Well, thank you, young man. I really needed to hear that.” 

Jimmy was standing outside, waiting for me, tears in his eyes as well. “Thank you, Jonas. Thank you for that.” 

I just shrugged and looked at the rising sun, “Morning already, I'm starving.”  

“Oh hey, you still have the coupon.” he said. 

I dug around in my pocket and pulled out the receipt, crumpled and with a drop of blood on one corner but still readable. I smiled. 

“One small soda please, and my free regular fries.” I said, placing the coupon down on the counter. 

The cashier took it and looked it over, before hissing through his teeth, “Ooh sorry sir, this coupon is only good if you purchase a Cluckey combo.” 

I sighed, “Really?” 

He nodded and slid the coupon back across the counter to me, “I'm afraid so.” 

“So, I have to buy a combo with fries to get the free fries?” 

“That is correct sir.” 

I shook my head and laughed. 

“Would you still like the small soda?” he asked. 

 

I stepped out of Captain Cluckey’s, small soda in hand. “Yo Jimmy, youre not gonna believe this.” 

... 

“Jimmy?” I said again. 

... 

I glanced around for him, but I already knew. I smiled and chuckled to myself, as I pulled out my last cigarette and headed for the bus station.

1livwt0,https://i.redd.it/aupmyaighr8f1.jpeg,Love this scale,"I’ve been looking for a coffee scale with a live brew ratio feature. So far, I’ve come across a few options:
* Fellow Tally Pro – $190
* Hario Polaris Scale – $80
* Brewista Ratio Scale – $??

There are other scales like Timemore, which show the brew ratio after the pour is finished, but I specifically wanted one that shows it live.
The Fellow was too expensive, and the Hario was okay, but I noticed it had been selling on Amazon for under $60 for a couple of years—and now it’s over $75, which I think was the original price anyway. As for Brewista, I’m not sure what happened to them; it seems like they’ve disappeared.

Recently, I found another one: the Maestri House S3, which has both live brew ratio and flow rate, and costs under $30 (after a $10 discount on Amazon). I’d been searching for a couple of months, so I was thrilled and bought it immediately.

Here’s what I was looking for in a coffee scale:
1. Live brew ratio (must-have)
2. Under $60 (must-have)
3. Accurate and fast response (must-have)
4. Flow rate (really wanted)
5. Not too ugly (really wanted)
6. Separate power toggle (nice to have)
7. Separate control area so button presses don’t affect weight readings (nice to have)

The S3 checks most of the boxes. It’s accurate and responsive (though I still want to test it over time to ensure it holds up). It looks pretty nice, and I really like the design. It even has a dedicated power toggle, which I appreciate.
The only downside is #7 — while the control area is technically separate, the scale measures the entire surface, so pressing buttons does affect the reading. Still, at this price point, I’m more than happy to say:
This is my favorite coffee scale.

Last week I was at holiday, I went to seashore by walking 10mins from my home. For resting I drinked 500ml of cold beer and a liter of water. Since beer doing diuretic effect at me ,while I was returning home, I suddenly needed to pee hard urgently and went to pee, plucked went out while peeing. 

Between 3 weeks that I couldnt pee the kidney stone (it was inside bladder probably), I had problems peeing, pain at urether while peeing, unable to pee... Just felt like URI or Prosthatis patient. EVEN I FELT JUST PAIN AND INFLAMATION AT MY PROSTATE. Just after peeing kidney stone, all of symptoms went away instantly and I relaxed after 3 weeks of pain...

My advice is, even it is coffee, beer, tea or water... Drink as much as liquid you can intake regularly which makes diuretic affect anyway. Stopped using energy drinks and mineral soda's which may develope stones from excessive salts and minerals.

I’m currently exploring the beautiful city of Salerno and I’m eager to meet new people—whether you’re a fellow traveler passing through or a local who knows the area well. Traveling is always more fun when you can share experiences and stories with others, so I thought I’d reach out here!

I’m here to enjoy good company, discover hidden gems in Salerno, and maybe even make some lasting friendships.

I’m open to all kinds of meetups—whether it’s grabbing a coffee or gelato, wandering through the historic streets, checking out local art or music, or simply relaxing and chatting somewhere cozy. If you know some great spots that tourists don’t usually find, I’d love to hear about them! Also happy to share some travel stories and tips from my own adventures.

# 🔥 The Four Horsemen of the Haikupocalypse

## 🧾 Sentences

**Definition**: A poem composed entirely of grammatically complete sentences that could exist outside poetic form with zero change in tone or meaning.

**Symptoms**:

* Line breaks feel cosmetic
* Reads like a diary entry or bad voiceover
*  Often includes pronouns (""I"", ""you"") in every line
* Zero tension, pivot, or evocative compression

**Side Effects**:

> *All I want is love / But my heart has run away / On a midnight train*  
> → Poetic meaning dissolves back into prose syrup

---

## 🪢 Line Jams

**Definition**: Three lines that don't speak to each other. No shared moment, no emotional or imagistic continuity. Often reads like three unrelated tweets in a trench coat.

**Symptoms**:  

- Lines depend on each other grammatically in an unnatural or forced way
- L2 veers into a different image space than L1
- L3 introduces a new character or object with no context
- Often feels like it was generated by a malfunctioning AI poet (which may be true)

**Side Effects**:

> *Morning coffee steam / My grandmother's wedding ring / Bitcoin hits new highs*  
> → Reader experiences interpretive vertigo, mild civic disorientation

---

## 🥱 L3 Collapse

**Definition**: A third line that undercuts or abandons the poem's imagery, mood, or narrative. Often vague, contradictory, or cliché. Frequently mistaken for “profound.”

**Variants**:

- False Twist™: L3 introduces a ""surprise"" that doesn't land
- Tonal Undercut™: L3 weakens the emotion built in L1/L2
- Shrug L3™: It just... ends

**Side Effects**:

> *Dewdrops catch sunrise / Each one a tiny mirror / Life is beautiful*  
> → Reader hears a door creak open but finds only a broom closet

---

## 🥠 Fortune Cookie Collapse

**Definition**: When a haiku abandons concrete imagery entirely in favor of generic life wisdom, inspirational platitudes, or greeting card philosophy. The poem becomes a motivational poster disguised as poetry.

**Symptoms**:

* Abstract concepts replace specific images
* Overuse of words like ""hope,"" ""dreams,"" ""journey,"" ""heart,"" ""soul""
* Could be printed on a coffee mug or bathroom wall
* Reads like it was generated by a wellness app
* Often rhymes accidentally while trying to sound profound

**Side Effects**:

> *Follow your dreams / The journey of a thousand miles / Begins with one step*  
> → Reader experiences sudden urge to check email, spiritual advice fatigue, mild existential emptiness despite technically ""uplifting"" message

1livjo7,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1livjo7/review_floral_street_discovery_set/,Review: Floral Street discovery set,"Hey r/fragrance! I'm relatively new to the world of perfume and Floral Street was my first discovery set. It's been a few months and I've spent enough time exploring it that I feel I have ""completed"" the set. This is my review - I've written it mostly for my own enjoyment, but I also think it's useful to have longer-form descriptions of different houses!

Overall impression:  
\- This brand is vegan and cruelty free which I very highly value.  
\- They market themselves as a ""cheaper"" option. At £110 for 100ml, £74 for 50ml, and £29 for a travel size (10ml), I think this is a bit misleading and they actually fall squarely in the designer price range. Nothing wrong with that but it doesn't particularly stand out when it comes to price.  
\- The fragrances are fairly linear. I'd describe a lot of them as simple ideas done well. The overall vibe of the perfumes is bright, cheerful, quite youthful. I think this is part of what attracted me to the brand initially: a lot of other fragrances smelled too ""perfume-y"" or too complex for me.   
\- You may struggle to find something you really love if you're looking for something really special, unique, or more complex.   
\- I had fun going through the set and found a few frags I like!

Individual reviews: 

**London Poppy:** I tried this one maybe 3 times, but every single time without fail it gave me a headache, so I can't really do it justice. **Unrated/10.**

**Wonderland Peony:** This one is their bestseller and I can see why. It's a sweet floral that manages to not be too sweet. It's like a veil of very soft and respectful icing sugar. Smells like: mango (I think it's actually the pink guava), cotton candy, strawberry lemonade, unspecified white florals. But very safe and not overpowering. Great broadly appealing option, maybe a little boring. **8/10.**

**Sunflower Pop:** Supposedly inspired by the Van Gogh *Sunflowers* though it doesn't have much to do with sunflowers aside from being generally cheerful. Smells like: orange juice when it's first sprayed on (it's almost uncanny), lemon tea when it dries down. Like many citruses the top notes are quite fleeting - if that's a problem for you, you've been warned. 

This isn't one of those fragrances that makes you hold your wrists up to your nose, take a big breath in, and immediately know it's something special. You just catch a little whiff of it and think ""oh, that's nice"" and before you know it's wormed its way into your mind. The radicalising moment for me came when I was trying to make myself like Lush Junk and realised this fragrance was actually so much more lovely. **9/10.**

**Electric Rhubarb:** It's Sunflower Pop but less charming. I'm sorry. Smells like: rhubarb, white wine, prosecco, a fizzy drink. It's just like holding rhubarb up to your face and sniffing it. Is it offensive in any way? No. It just doesn't stand out to me. **7.5/10.**

**Neon Rose:** I'm not sure why it's neon (if anything the mood feels soft and dreamy) and I don't get the rose. I'm sure it's in there somewhere but I cannot in good faith say I pick up a rose note. Smells like: soapy powdery pear. It's like someone took a beautiful, ripe pear and asked: how can we make it smell more like dog shampoo? It's not actively unpleasant but I don't get any joy from wearing it either. **6.5/10.**

**Arizona Bloom:** This is one of those big-brained amber fragrances that wants to smell like nothing, everything, and delicious moist humid summer air all at the same time. I'm sure it achieves that to some people (some locals tell legends of it resembling Le Labo Another 13), but for me it gets the balance very slightly wrong to disastrous effect. The nail in the coffin was when I wore it on a morning when I was having a regrettable unwashed hair moment. I will forever associate it with the emotion of ""I am barely keeping it together - thank goodness for dry shampoo"". I gave the sample to my sister. **4.5/10.**

**Wild Vanilla Orchid:** Actually a very balanced vanilla that miraculously bucks the trend of vanilla only being present in sweet perfumes. This would score much higher if it weren't for a small problem: it smells waxy and I don't like that. Two of the notes listed are bamboo and cashmere and I'm convinced one of them must be the culprit. **7.5/10.**

**Sweet Almond Blossom:** The other Van Gogh inspired one; this time the painting series is *Almond Blossoms*. Smells like: pineapples (bet you didn't expect that), sweet and powdery almond, something slightly astringent (the matcha?). Some reviewers say they don't smell the almond at all but I get it very clearly. I really like this one: I've never regretted smelling almond and I think the development from tropical pineapple is very fun. Might be too sweet or too random for some. **8.5/10.**

**Iris Goddess:** Oh my. No. I would rather Arizona Bloom. I wore two sprays of this on a train once and it was one of my worst decisions this year. It's like someone sleepwalked into a perfumery lab and started mixing random liquids together without checking the balance. Buttery + powdery iris + cloying sweetness = I disintegrate. **3.0/10.**

**Chypre Sublime:** Lives in my head rent free. Juicy, heady rose with just the right hit of incense and patchouli to make it interesting. I could gush about this fragrance all day. The short version is: it's incredibly atmospheric. Initially I thought it was a very specific vibe that wasn't for me, but I kept coming back to it. Some reviewers say it's similar to Portrait of a Lady. I can confirm it's similar but not quite identical. **9/10.**

**Black Lotus:** Patchouli and spice bomb. It's actually not that bad, but: 1. It's really strong to the point it's not practical. I have to do only one spray and proceed with caution. 2. It's completely overshadowed by Chypre Sublime - to me this is Chypre Sublime without the juiciness of the rose. **6.0/10.**

**Ylang Ylang Espresso:** Well. To be absolutely honest, it's not balanced. But sometimes it's not all about balance, you just gotta take a fragrance the way it comes and admire whoever had the guts to make the extremely fun little abomination. Smells like: chaos, tiramisu, cream, dark chocolate, coffee, cigarettes mixed with something really sweet at a club, the abstract feeling of a cozy mountain hut in the snow. **7.5/10.**",1,1750720389.0,fragrance,0,1.0,False

Before work I go to the gym about every other day. I’m hardly shredded but I’ve gone enough that you can see my muscles when I come into work in short sleeves. I wouldn’t describe myself as a gym bro or a gym rat, I really just go for my overall health. Anyways, I work in an office with maybe 25-30 people that work there. We mainly do business to business sales and supply (not really relevant to the story). 

Anyway, I get to work one day wearing a polo and a couple of girls and guys in the office were asking me if I had been working out recently and I told them that I had. It wasn’t flirtatious or anything like that I think they were just giving me a friendly compliment, plus I’m married but as we’re discussing me working out, my coworker Gary (40sM) walks in. Gary is… a lot. He's one of those guys who constantly talks about how much he benches, his ""gains,"" and generally just tries to project this super intense, alpha male image. Which is annoying but none of my business really. 

This is where the problem starts. Someone asked me what my max bench was. I told them honestly, and Gary, who was lurking nearby, scoffed. Loudly. He then proceeded to tell me, in front of like five other coworkers, that my number (170) was ""pathetic"" and that I clearly wasn't a ""real man"" or an ""alpha."" He then went on a tirade about how men need to be strong and dominate, etc., etc. It was super uncomfortable.I tried to just laugh it off and change the subject, but it didn't work. Since then, it's gotten worse. Every single day, Gary makes some kind of comment. If I'm getting coffee, he'll ask if I'm ""strong enough to lift the pot."" If I'm walking to my desk, he'll flex and ask if I'm ""inspired yet to hit the weights like a real man.”

I've tried ignoring him, giving him short answers, even politely telling him to knock it off. Nothing works. He just laughs and says I need to ""grow a thicker skin.""

Then, this is where I start to lose my shit a little. My wife (27F) texted me a screenshot yesterday. It was a DM from GARY. It was a picture of him flexing in the gym with some ridiculous caption about being a ""true alpha"" and how ""real women"" know what's up. (Summarizing but you get the sentiment). He'd somehow found her on social media and sent her this unsolicited picture and message. I was beyond furious. I wanted to march over to his desk and punch him, but I knew that would only make things worse.

I'm starting to dread coming to work. It's constant, it's demeaning, it's making me feel genuinely small and uncomfortable, and now he's involving my wife. Am I overreacting to this? Is this just typical ""guy banter"" that I'm not getting? Should I just suck it up and ignore him, or is this actually something worth addressing with HR? I feel like if I tell HR it might just add fuel to the fire. But if I come down to his level and respond violently, I’ll lose my job.

I am normally brewing one to two gallon jars at any given time plus my scoby hotel - three jars total. I had been using muslin as my filter for months with no issues, but got distracted in the middle of summer two years ago & forgotten about them for a few weeks. When I returned to them, they were all infested with fruit fly larvae - as bad as any wriggling pellicle that's been posted to this noble forum.

Now here's the part that makes me a monster: I didn't dump out my kombucha. I threw out the infested pellicles, but I bottled the booch for my F2 as normal and used pellicles from my hotel to replace the ones I tossed. All 12 bottles that week turned out bubbly & normal with no foul taste or irregularities. 

The next week, the maggots returned in drastically smaller nnumbers. Again, I threw out & replaced the offending pellicles & bottled the fluid. By the third week, I was maggot free. I replaced the muslin with basket coffee filters and have never had an issue since. I've been using the same SCOBY hotel this entire time since as the source of my starter.

Please don't judge me too harshly - the only person I hurt was myself. And I guess anyone reading this if it made you want to gag at the thought of me drinking the infected booch.

About me:
Pics are available on my profile, mutual attraction is important so let's get it out of the way.

I'm looking to be child free and aim to wait a long time for marriage (5-10 years).

While I'm supportive of polyamory and ENM, it is not for me.

I am agnostic, and am tolerable to other religions.

I lean left politically.

My love languages are Quality Time and Physical Touch.

I'm a big and tall kind of man, standing at 6'4"" and weighing 250 lbs. I am very actively working on that second number, and would enjoy someone who is also conscious of their body. I work out 6 days a week with various intensities.

My biggest hobby is to explore Orlando, looking for new coffee shops, restaurants, bars, and things to do.

I'm a classic computer geek with a majority of the associated hobbies and interests.

I'm very into music, with my main genres being metal, deathcore, metalcore, and rock, I am open to pretty much all music except country.

Though I am accommodating, I am a man who is serious and knows what he wants.

In case the following are important, I am a cancer, my MBTI is INFJ, ennegram types 4&5, and I'm rather spicy in the bedroom.

Ages 24-34

In Central Florida or reasonable driving distance

Willing or wanting to be child free and to wait for marriage

Able to tolerate long periods of my music tastes.

Are willing and able to go out in public for coffee, food, and drinks.

Can enjoy and are able to have a back and forth conversation with an active listener. Having a good and open sense of humor is a major plus.

Normally I would just scrub the hell out of it with some good cleaner spray and call it a day. But I don't want to destroy the surface. How the heck can I clean this filthy boy?

1livbik,https://www.reddit.com/r/floxies/comments/1livbik/why_am_i_easily_getting_tendonligament_flares/,Why am I easily getting tendon/ligament flares from coffee 1.5 years out?,"A quick summary of my story: I was floxxed in February 2024. Initially had a ton of different symptoms, but primarily ligament damage (I have EDS). 6 months into my floxxing, in August 2024, I had to take 300-400 aspirin for a heart condition pericarditis). I didn’t have a choice – I had to either take aspirin or steroids because the pericarditis almost killed me. The aspirin caused my first tendon issues from the floxxing, and MAJOR tendon issues at that. My tendons mostly calmed down several months later by December 2024, however they still flare here and there and are definitely not fully healed yet. 

My question is: why does coffee still affect me so much? I recently decided to try it and drank about 4 cups over the span of two days. Within 24-48 hours my tendons and fatigue were noticeably worse. My ligaments were also affected. I waited until the flare died down over the span of a couple weeks and then tried coffee again to confirm whether or not that’s what the trigger was – and it absolutely was the coffee. 

Why is a small amount of coffee still causing me issues 1.5 years out? Is it because I’m sensitive from taking hundreds of aspirin a year ago? Doesn’t coffee/caffeine induce cellular turnover/mitophagy? Could my MTHFR gene mutations have something to do with it? I don’t consume any folic acid and occasionally supplement with methylated folate or B12.

Would love to hear from any veterans or people who have researched this!

You gave me everything for about 6 months, and then it all came to a complete stop....I found out that pretty much the entire time, facebook...snap chat....instagram were all guilty pleasures for you...and I decided to look passed it...foolishly...you would go out with your friends and get drunk every other night, would block my calls and ignore my texts, even while I was at home with YOUR children, and come home 2 or 3 hours before you had to go to work...and blame me for not providing somehow...your friends would tell me you've cheated....your family would tell me that you dont love me...they would all tell me that your using me for bill money and security....and I was blind too it all....you cheated on me, tossed me to the side, pitched and complained that I wasn't doing enough all the time....but...I didnt hear you complain about a single thing while I was buying you things, or opening my wallet to pay another price....did I? But i still saw videos and picture of you cheating on me rounding all the bases, from the very people you call your best friends....9 months has passed...and I haven't even received a single ""im sorry"" after I gathered the BALLS to pack my shit and leave you....which was the hardest fucking thing I've ever had to do...it was the same night the I left, that you went out to the bar and left with a random stranger. Everyone would inform me...all the drinking and the blackouts....hook ups....and you even tried to call me and rub in my face about a new boyfriend that you had that he would do this or that....but now you dont date him anymore...
I get random messages.telling me that you have been in and out of the hospital for doing cocaine now...? 

All of this...I cant help to feel guilty, and sorry...and like...I didnt do enough or something...because somehow I still love you...somehow...I still want our souls to align in another realm, and be able to have that version of me be happy....

I dont know....I NEED to completely let you go...I do...I know thats good for me...but somehow I think I need to hear you say that I need to move on and that we aren't meant to be together....I need you to release me...please release me...

We’ve had our moments. We were extremely toxic (I’m talking hed get mad at me for anything. Throwing stuff. He’d call me berating names.) about a year ago, but since then we fixed it. But I’m scared it’s not as fixed as I thought.

Today is a celebration. I wanted to celebrate his birthday early since on his real birthday we will be on a plane all day. I had it all figured out. A $150 massage, take him out to breakfast, a full day of plans, then take him to dinner.

We had a small misunderstanding. I’m very calm when I communicate and I don’t raise my voice, so I was communicating to him how I didn’t like that he made ‘happy ending’ jokes (this was after the massage). All he said was ‘I’m not doing this right now’ and silent treated me.

We went home. He argued with me about how I always ruin every special event for him and how I’m always super negative. At one point, he said ‘you’re a grown ass woman’. So I said ‘but you always say I’m not?’ And he went ‘yeah, because you’re not mentally there ever.’. …am I grown or not??

Either way, I called him selfish. (Mind you, in bed he lets me use a vibrator to finish first, then he will do everything else. He never tries to please me. Also I do all the dinners, lunches, I bring him coffee at work, and I work and go to school full time, he does not go to school.)

A little extra detail. His ONLY chores in the house are dishes and trash. Calls me a nag when dishes have been piled up for 3 weeks. Calls me too picky when I say do the trash. Wtv.

So I brought all that up. And he said ‘I’m not selfish. You’re never satisfied.’ So I made the comparison of ‘if I made a joke to get pounded by random men, would that be okay?’ And he went ‘I bet you would get pounded by them, too.’ Like.. what,?,

At the end, he went ‘I know why you’re arguing. It’s because everytime I wanna be happy or have an event for myself, you go out of your way to get me.’ WHAT???

I’m so upset you guys. All I ever wanted was to be treated fairly. I feel like I’m great! I never argue, I always go out of my way for him, and I let him do all that to me,??

I guess I just need advice or some sort of moral support. I feel horrible for ruining his birthday celebration.",14,1750719733.0,relationship_advice,55,0.85,False

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wouldn't it be just grand to swap those mundane office walls for the endless blue horizon, to feel the sun-kissed sand between your toes and the gentle caress of the sea breeze on your skin? France, the land of romance and delectable cuisine, isn't just about Parisian chic or alpine majesty. Oh no, my friends, it offers a coastal tapestry rich with vibrant towns, hidden coves, and stretches of golden sand that beckon the weary soul. We're talking about the veritable gems among France beach cities, those picturesque havens where the Mediterranean's sparkle or the Atlantic's roar becomes the soundtrack to your perfect escape. Forget the stuffy travel brochures for a minute, because we’re about to dive deep, peel back the layers, and truly experience what makes these coastal French towns so utterly irresistible. From the glitz and glamour of the French Riviera to the wild, untamed beauty of the Atlantic coast, there's a beach city in France with your name on it, just waiting to be discovered. So, grab a fresh cup of coffee, or perhaps a glass of rosé, and let's embark on this sun-drenched journey, shall we? You're in for a treat, I promise you.

### Sun-Kissed Riviera: Where Glamour Meets the Med

Ah, the French Riviera! Just the name itself conjures up images of movie stars, superyachts, and an undeniable aura of sophisticated allure. This isn't just a stretch of coastline; it's a lifestyle, a dream woven into the very fabric of its existence. Picture this: azure waters that shimmer like scattered diamonds, palm-fringed promenades bustling with activity, and charming old towns tucked away amidst the modernity, each with its own unique story to tell. It's a place where the air hums with excitement and the scent of jasmine mingles with the salty sea breeze. Whether you're a high-roller looking for a slice of the good life or a wanderer seeking picturesque beauty, the Riviera offers a smorgasbord of coastal delights. It’s got a reputation, sure, but don’t let that scare you off; there’s more to it than just the glitz. Much, much more.

#### Nice: The Queen of the Côte d'Azur

Nice, my dear friends, is the undisputed queen of the Côte d'Azur, and for good reason! This sprawling city effortlessly blends the charm of a bygone era with the vibrant energy of a contemporary metropolis. Its iconic Promenade des Anglais, stretching for miles along the Bay of Angels, is a spectacle in itself – a ribbon of activity where locals jog, rollerblade, and stroll, while visitors soak in the panoramic views. But delve deeper, beyond the promenade, and you'll discover a labyrinthine Old Town (Vieux Nice) bursting with color, narrow cobbled streets, bustling markets overflowing with fresh produce and fragrant flowers, and hidden trattorias serving up delectable local specialties. The pebble beaches might not be to everyone's taste, but the sheer beauty of the water and the lively atmosphere more than make up for it. It's a place where you can spend your mornings exploring art museums – the Matisse Museum and the Marc Chagall National Museum are must-sees – and your afternoons basking in the sun or savoring an authentic Niçoise salad with a glass of crisp regional wine. Don’t miss the climb up Castle Hill for truly breathtaking vistas of both the city and the sparkling coastline. It’s a workout, but oh so worth the payoff!

#### Cannes: The Epitome of Chic

When you hear ""Cannes,"" what's the first thing that springs to mind? The film festival, right? And you'd be spot on! But this glamorous city on the French Riviera is so much more than just a red carpet affair. Cannes is the embodiment of chic, a place where luxury yachts bob in the harbor, designer boutiques line the chic Rue d'Antibes, and the Croisette promenade buzzes with an undeniable air of sophistication. The city’s sandy beaches are a big draw, offering a softer landing than Nice’s pebbles, and many are private, attached to luxury hotels, but there are public stretches too where you can lay out your towel and enjoy the sun. Explore the charming old quarter of Le Suquet, perched on a hill above the modern city, with its winding medieval streets, historic church, and panoramic views over the bay. It’s a wonderful contrast to the glitz below. And while the prices can certainly be steep in some places, you can still find delightful local eateries serving up fresh seafood and Provençal dishes if you know where to look. Cannes truly knows how to blend its world-renowned glamour with a surprisingly laid-back Mediterranean vibe, making it a compelling destination for anyone seeking a taste of the good life.

#### Saint-Tropez: The Legendary Playground

Mention Saint-Tropez, and images of Brigitte Bardot, sun-drenched yachts, and a perpetually vibrant nightlife leap to mind. And you know what? Those images aren't far off! This quaint fishing village, immortalized by the silver screen, has blossomed into the legendary playground of the rich and famous, yet it still manages to retain a captivating charm that draws in visitors from all walks of life. The tiny, picturesque port, lined with colorful fishing boats alongside colossal super-yachts, is the heart of the action, perfect for people-watching over a coffee or an apéritif. The town's narrow, winding streets are a joy to explore, leading you past high-end boutiques, art galleries, and charming, flower-filled squares. But the real draw, for many, lies just beyond the town’s core: the stunning Pampelonne Beach. This legendary stretch of golden sand is home to world-famous beach clubs that hum with music and effervescent energy, but also offers quieter spots if you wish to escape the party scene. It's a place where you can truly indulge in la dolce vita, whether it’s sipping rosé at a chic beach club or simply enjoying the unparalleled beauty of the Mediterranean coast. Saint-Tropez might have a reputation for extravagance, but its undeniable allure lies in its ability to combine that glamour with a timeless, rustic beauty that's truly captivating.

### Atlantic Allure: Wild Coasts and Majestic Waves

Now, if the calm, azure waters of the Mediterranean don't quite stir your soul, if you yearn for something a little wilder, a little more rugged, then the Atlantic coast of France is calling your name! This isn't the Riviera's polished charm; this is raw, untamed beauty, where the powerful ocean sculpts dramatic cliffs, the winds whisper tales of ancient mariners, and vast stretches of golden sand seem to go on forever. It’s a truly magnetic region, offering a completely different kind of coastal experience. Perfect for surfers, nature lovers, or anyone who simply loves the feeling of vast open spaces and crashing waves. The air here holds a different kind of tang, a bracing freshness that invigorates the senses. Get ready to embrace the elements, because the Atlantic coast is a force of nature in the best possible way.

#### Biarritz: Surfing Capital with Belle Époque Charm

Biarritz, perched majestically on France's southwestern Atlantic coast, is a city that effortlessly marries its aristocratic Belle Époque past with a vibrant, contemporary surf culture. Originally a favored retreat for European royalty, including Empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III, Biarritz still exudes an air of sophisticated elegance. Its stunning Grand Plage, a crescent of golden sand overlooked by grand hotels and the iconic Casino Barrière, is a sight to behold. But beyond the glitz, Biarritz is undeniably the surfing capital of France, attracting wave-riders from across the globe. You'll see surfers with their boards heading to the legendary waves of Côte des Basques, while others enjoy the gentler surf closer to the city center.

Stroll along the clifftop promenades, discover the Rocher de la Vierge (Virgin's Rock) for panoramic views, or explore the charming fishing port (Port des Pêcheurs) with its unique fishermen’s houses. The city also boasts fantastic thalassotherapy centers, capitalizing on the rejuvenating properties of the Atlantic seawater. Even if you're not a surfer, the energetic atmosphere, the stunning natural beauty, and the blend of history and modern vivacity make Biarritz an absolutely captivating destination among the France beach cities. It’s a place where you can feel the raw power of the ocean while still enjoying all the creature comforts.

#### La Rochelle: Historic Port with Island Charms

Ah, La Rochelle! This captivating city on the Atlantic coast is a real gem, brimming with history, maritime heritage, and an undeniable allure. Unlike the sun-drenched glamour of the Riviera or the rugged surf culture of Biarritz, La Rochelle offers a different flavor entirely – one steeped in centuries of seafaring tales and architectural beauty. Its pièce de résistance is undoubtedly the Vieux Port (Old Port), guarded by three impressive medieval towers: the Tour Saint-Nicolas, the Tour de la Chaîne, and the Tour de la Lanterne. Imagine standing there, watching the boats bobbing in the water, and picturing the ships of old setting sail for distant lands – it’s easy to get lost in the romance of it all.

The city’s arcaded streets, bustling with boutiques, cafes, and restaurants, lead you through a fascinating journey back in time, boasting stunning 17th and 18th-century architecture. Beyond its historical charm, La Rochelle is also a vibrant modern city, home to a fantastic aquarium that's one of Europe's largest, and a lively, pedestrian-friendly center. It’s also the perfect launchpad for exploring the nearby islands, Île de Ré and Île d'Oléron, both accessible by bridge and offering stunning beaches, charming villages, and wonderful cycling opportunities. La Rochelle offers a wonderful blend of urban sophistication, historical depth, and easy access to coastal natural beauty, making it a truly unique and enriching experience.

#### Arcachon: Dune Delights and Oyster Oases

Let me tell you about Arcachon, a delightful resort town on the Atlantic coast that’s often overshadowed by its flashier neighbors but holds a quiet charm all its own. Nestled on the Bassin d'Arcachon, a tranquil inland sea protected from the fiercest Atlantic waves, it offers a distinct coastal experience. Forget the crashing surf for a moment – here, it’s all about calm waters, golden sand, and a truly unique ecosystem.

One of the undeniable stars of the show is the majestic Dune du Pilat (Dune of Pilat), Europe’s tallest sand dune. Walking up it – and trust me, it’s a climb, but there are stairs! – feels like ascending a natural skyscraper. Once at the top, you’re rewarded with breathtaking panoramic views of the forest on one side and the seemingly endless Atlantic on the other. It’s an absolutely unforgettable experience and a must-do if you find yourself in the area.

But Arcachon isn't just about the dune. It's also renowned for its world-class oysters! The Bassin is a veritable oyster farming haven, and you can indulge in these briny delights fresh from the sea at numerous oyster shacks, often paired with a glass of crisp white wine. The town itself is divided into four distinct ""Ville"" sections based on the seasons: Ville d'Été (Summer Town) with its lively promenade, Ville d'Hiver (Winter Town) boasting stunning Belle Époque villas, Ville d'Automne (Autumn Town), and Ville de Printemps (Spring Town). Exploring the opulent architecture of Ville d'Hiver is like stepping into a romantic novel. Arcachon offers a relaxed, authentic French coastal experience, perfect for families, foodies, and anyone who appreciates natural wonders. It really is a place where you can kick back, breathe deep, and truly unwind.

### North and West: Hidden Gems and Diverse Landscapes

When we think of France beach cities, our minds often jump straight to the south or the Atlantic powerhouses. But hold on a minute! To truly appreciate the breadth of France's coastal offerings, we absolutely have to cast our net wider, to the stunning and often overlooked regions of the North and West. These areas present a completely different narrative, one of rugged beauty, historical significance, and a charm that’s distinctly French but with its own unique regional flair. We're talking about everything from the dramatic white cliffs of Normandy to the granite rose coastline of Brittany. It's a testament to France's incredible geographical diversity that such stunning variations exist, all within one country. So, let’s peel back another layer and discover some of these less-trodden, but equally mesmerizing, coastal treasures.

#### Normandy: Where History Meets the Sea

Normandy. Just the name conjures up images, doesn't it? For many, it's synonymous with the D-Day Landings, a poignant reminder of history that shaped the world. And while the solemn, windswept beaches of D-Day are undeniably powerful and a must-visit for historical reflection, Normandy’s coastline, stretching along the English Channel, offers so much more than just its wartime past. It's a region of dramatic cliffs, picturesque half-timbered villages, and a rugged, bracing beauty that’s completely distinct from the sun-drenched south. The air here holds a different kind of chill, a fresh, invigorating tang that feels utterly authentic. This is where Impressionist painters found their muse, captivated by the ever-changing light and the striking landscapes. Think Monet's cliffs at Étretat or the quaint charm of Honfleur. It's a testament to the diverse range of France beach cities that such a unique coastal experience exists.

- **Étretat:** Imagine soaring white chalk cliffs, sculpted by centuries of wind and sea, forming colossal natural arches that plunge into the turquoise waters below. That, my friends, is Étretat. It’s a breathtaking geological marvel that has long inspired artists and writers alike. Walking along the clifftop paths offers truly spectacular views, and during low tide, you can even explore the pebble beaches and grottoes beneath the arches. It's less about traditional swimming and sunbathing and more about awe-inspiring scenery and invigorating walks.
- **Honfleur:** Step into a fairytale in Honfleur, a charming port town nestled at the mouth of the Seine. Its picturesque Vieux Bassin (old harbor) is lined with tall, narrow, slate-fronted houses that immediately transport you to another era. It’s no wonder Impressionist painters flocked here! Wander through its cobbled streets, browse the art galleries, enjoy fresh seafood at a waterside restaurant, and visit Sainte-Catherine's Church, France's largest wooden church, built by shipwrights. Honfleur exudes an unpretentious, artistic charm that’s utterly captivating.
- **Deauville &amp; Trouville:** Often referred to as ""Paris by the Sea,"" Deauville is synonymous with glamour. Think horse races, film festivals, and chic boutiques. Its wide sandy beach, iconic boardwalk with its colorful striped changing cabins, and grand hotels attract a sophisticated crowd. Just across the Touques River lies Trouville-sur-Mer, Deauville’s more down-to-earth twin. Trouville boasts a bustling fish market, a lively casino, and a beautiful sandy beach that offers a true taste of traditional seaside fun without the Deauville price tag. They make a fantastic duo, offering two distinct but equally appealing coastal experiences.

#### Brittany: Wild Beauty and Celtic Spirit

If you're looking for something truly unique, something that feels a world away from the familiar Mediterranean vibe, then Brittany is your answer. This peninsula in northwest France is a region unto itself, with a strong Celtic heritage, ancient legends, and a coastline that ranges from stunning pink granite formations to rugged cliffs and extensive sandy beaches. The weather can be a bit more unpredictable than the south, but that just adds to its dramatic charm, lending a moody, atmospheric quality that’s incredibly appealing. It’s an adventurer’s paradise, full of character and unspoiled natural beauty, and a prime example of the diverse selection of France beach cities.

- **Saint-Malo:** This walled city is an absolute must-see. Its imposing ramparts, rebuilt after extensive damage in WWII, enclose a labyrinth of cobbled streets, grand granite buildings, and bustling squares. Walking the ramparts offers incredible views of the sea, the tiny islands dotting the bay, and the historic buildings within. Saint-Malo is famous for its massive tides, which reveal vast stretches of sand and even allow access to certain islands at low tide. It’s a city steeped in pirate history, with an adventurous spirit that’s palpable. Don't leave without trying some local seafood, especially oysters!
- **Perros-Guirec:** Welcome to the heart of the Côte de Granit Rose, or Pink Granite Coast. Perros-Guirec is a gorgeous resort town that serves as the perfect base for exploring this truly unique landscape. Imagine gigantic, fantastical rock formations, sculpted by millennia of erosion, glowing a magnificent rose color as the sun hits them. It’s a geological wonderland that feels almost otherworldly. The customs officers’ path (Sentier des Douaniers) between Perros-Guirec and Ploumanac'h offers some of the most stunning coastal walks imaginable, winding through these extraordinary rock gardens and past beautiful coves.

- **Quiberon Peninsula:** This long, narrow peninsula jutting out into the Atlantic is a land of contrasts. On one side, the ""Côte Sauvage"" (Wild Coast) boasts dramatic cliffs and crashing waves – perfect for intrepid explorers and stunning photography. On the other, sheltered sandy beaches offer calmer waters ideal for swimming and windsurfing. Quiberon town itself is a lively resort with a fishing port and plenty of seafood restaurants. It’s a fantastic spot for outdoor activities, from cycling the coastal paths to enjoying the fresh sea air.

### Planning Your Coastal French Getaway: Tips and Tricks

Alright, so by now you’re probably dreaming of frolicking on sandy beaches, sniffing out the freshest seafood, and soaking up all that wonderful French culture, right? Before you pack your bags and head for the nearest airport, a little prep work can go a long way in ensuring your trip is as breezy and beautiful as those coastal winds. Moving around those France beach cities, especially during peak season, can be a whole different ballgame. Don't worry your pretty little head, though; I've got some savvy tips and tricks up my sleeve to help you navigate the nuances and make the most of your epic adventure. Trust me, a little forethought can save you a world of headaches and help you truly kick back and enjoy the ride.

#### Best Time to Visit and What to Pack

This is a big one, because the ""best time"" really depends on what you're after!

- **Summer (June to August):** This is prime time, no doubt about it. Warm, sunny weather is pretty much guaranteed on the Mediterranean coast, and the Atlantic can be lovely too. The downside? Crowds, especially in popular spots like the Riviera, and prices will be at their peak. Book accommodations and flights well in advance if you're traveling during these months. Pack light, breathable clothing, swimwear, sunhats, high SPF sunscreen, and comfortable sandals. Evenings can be mild, but a light jacket or cardigan might be handy.
- **Shoulder Seasons (April-May, September-October):** In my humble opinion, these are the sweet spots. The weather is generally pleasant, the crowds are thinner, and prices are more reasonable. The sea might be a bit chilly for swimming in April/May, but September/October offer lovely warm waters, especially in the south. This is also a fantastic time for coastal walks and exploring without feeling rushed. Pack layers – a mix of light clothing, a jumper or two, a waterproof jacket, and comfortable walking shoes.
- **Winter (November to March):** If you're seeking a quiet, contemplative escape, winter can be surprisingly charming, particularly in the larger France beach cities like Nice or Biarritz which remain vibrant. Many smaller towns might be very quiet, with some restaurants and shops closing for the season. Expect cooler temperatures, and rain is more likely, especially on the Atlantic coast. Pack warm layers, a good waterproof coat, sturdy shoes, and perhaps an umbrella. You won't be swimming, but the dramatic coastal scenery can be breathtakingly beautiful.

#### Getting Around: From Trains to Automobiles

France boasts an excellent public transportation network, but how you get around largely depends on your itinerary and what kind of experience you're after.

- **Trains (SNCF):** For zipping between major France beach cities like Nice, Cannes, Biarritz, or La Rochelle, the French train system (SNCF) is a fantastic option. It's efficient, comfortable, and often scenic. High-speed TGV trains connect major hubs, while regional TER trains serve shorter distances and smaller towns. Booking in advance, especially for TGV, can save you a pretty penny.
- **Buses:** For more local travel within regions or to reach smaller, less accessible villages, buses fill the gaps where trains don’t go. They’re generally reliable and economical.
- **Rental Cars:** If you plan on exploring charming villages, rugged coastlines, or hidden coves off the beaten path – which I highly recommend, by the way! – renting a car gives you ultimate flexibility. This is especially true for regions like Brittany, Normandy, or the area around Arcachon. Just be aware that parking can be a challenge (and pricey) in popular city centers, and driving in French cities can be a bit… *spirited*. Consider a smaller car for navigating narrow streets.
- **Cycling:** Many coastal areas, like the Île de Ré near La Rochelle or the trails around Arcachon, are incredibly cycle-friendly. Renting a bike is a wonderful way to explore at a leisurely pace and discover hidden gems.

#### Culinary Delights and Local Flavors

You simply cannot visit France and not talk about the food! Each region boasts its own culinary identity, and the France beach cities are no exception. Get ready to embark on a gastronomic adventure!

- **Seafood, Seafood, Seafood!** This is a no-brainer. From the freshest oysters of Arcachon and Brittany, juicy mussels (moules marinières), and grilled fish to platters of langoustines, crabs, and虾 (shrimp), the coast is a seafood lover's paradise. Don't be shy; dive in!
- **Mediterranean Flavors (South):** Think sun-drenched ingredients!
    - **Niçoise Salad:** A classic, authentic Niçoise salad from Nice is a world away from approximations you find elsewhere.
    - **Pissaladière:** A delicious onion tart, often with anchovies and olives.
    - **Socca:** A thin-crust chickpea pancake, a popular street food in Nice.
    - **Bouillabaisse:** While originating from Marseille, you’ll find excellent versions of this rich fish stew throughout the Riviera.
    - **Rosé Wine:** The ultimate Riviera accompaniment!
- **Atlantic Delicacies (West/Southwest):**
    - **Fleur de Sel:** The famous sea salt from Guérande (near La Rochelle) is prized worldwide. Try it on everything!
    - **Oysters (Huîtres):** Especially from the Bassin d'Arcachon and Brittany. Pair them with a glass of Muscadet or white wine.
    - **Galettes (Brittany):** Savory crêpes made from buckwheat flour, often filled with ham, cheese, and egg. A Breton staple.
    - **Crêpes (Brittany):** Sweet crêpes for dessert, of course!
    - **Kouign-amann (Brittany):** A heavenly, buttery, sugary pastry. You *must* try this.
- **Normandy Specialties (North):**
    - **Cider and Calvados:** Apple brandy! Normandy is apple country, so these are a must-try.
    - **Camembert &amp; Livarot:** Famous cheeses from the region.
    - **Marmite Dieppoise:** A creamy seafood stew.

**A little tip:** Look for ""Menu du Jour"" or ""Formule"" at lunchtime. These set menus offer excellent value and a great way to sample local specialties! Don't be afraid to try the little family-run places tucked away from the main tourist drag – that's where you'll often find the real culinary treasures.

### Navigating the Nuances: Safety, Etiquette, and Language

Traveling, especially internationally, can sometimes feel like stepping into a new universe, where the unspoken rules are just as important as the written ones. And while France is incredibly welcoming, knowing a few little insider tips about safety, local etiquette, and a smattering of the lingo can truly transform your experience from good to absolutely glorious. Don't want to step on any toes, do we? Understanding these nuances won’t just make your interactions smoother; it’ll show respect for the local culture, and believe me, that goes a long way. So, before you jet off to those dreamy France beach cities, let's take a quick peek at how to blend in, stay safe, and generally be a savvy traveler, shall we? You'll thank me later.

#### Staying Safe and Sound

France is generally a very safe country for tourists, but like any popular travel destination, it’s always wise to exercise common sense and be aware of your surroundings, especially in crowded tourist areas.

- **Pickpockets:** This is probably the most common crime affecting tourists, particularly in busy areas like train stations, crowded markets, or popular promenades (e.g., Nice’s Promenade des Anglais, Cannes’s Croisette). Keep purses zipped, wallets in front pockets, and bags slung across your body. Be extra vigilant on public transport.
- **Scams:** Be wary of people approaching you with ""free"" bracelets or ""signature petitions."" These are often distractions for pickpocketing. Politely but firmly decline and walk away.
- **Beach Safety:** While the beaches are beautiful, be mindful of currents, especially on the Atlantic coast where the waves can be powerful. Always swim near patrolled areas and obey any flag warnings. And, of course, wear sunscreen! The French sun, especially on the Riviera, can be intense.
- **Emergency Numbers:** It’s a good idea to have these handy:
    - **112:** European emergency number (for police, ambulance, fire)
    - **15:** SAMU (medical emergency)
    - **17:** Police
    - **18:** Fire Brigade

#### A Little Bit of French Goes a Long Way

While many people in tourist areas, especially younger generations, speak English, making an effort to speak a little French will be hugely appreciated. It shows respect and can open doors to more authentic interactions. Don’t be shy; most French people are happy to help you out if you try!

- **Greetings are key:**
    - *Bonjour* (Good day/Hello) – Use this religiously when entering a shop, restaurant, or even passing someone on the street. It’s fundamental.
    - *Bonsoir* (Good evening) – Use after sunset.
    - *Au revoir* (Goodbye)
- **Basic courtesies:**
    - *S'il vous plaît* (Please)
    - *Merci* (Thank you)
    - *Oui* (Yes) / *Non* (No)
    - *Pardon/Excusez-moi* (Excuse me/Sorry)
    - *Désolé(e)* (Sorry – more for apologies)
- **In restaurants/shops:**
    - *L'addition, s'il vous plaît* (The bill, please)
    - *Un café, s'il vous plaît* (A coffee, please)
    - *Je voudrais…* (I would like…)
    - *Parlez-vous anglais?* (Do you speak English?)
    - *Un peu* (A little bit)

#### Tipping and Etiquette

Tipping in France is different from North America, for instance. Service (service compris) is usually included in the price, so you don't need to add 15-20% like you might elsewhere.

- **Restaurants:** If service has been excellent, leaving a few extra euros (e.g., rounding up the bill, or leaving €1-5 for a regular meal) is appreciated but not mandatory. Don’t feel obliged to leave a large percentage.
- **Cafes/Bars:** For a coffee or a drink, rounding up to the nearest euro or leaving a small spare change (e.g., 50 cents to €1) is common.
- **Taxis:** Round up to the nearest euro or add a couple of euros for a longer ride.
- **General Etiquette:**
    - **""Bonjour"" first:** Always start any interaction with ""Bonjour."" If you don't, you might come across as impolite.
    - **Dress Code:** While casual is fine for beach towns, a little effort goes a long way, especially for dinner or nicer establishments. ""Smart casual"" is often a good rule of thumb.
    - **Meal Times:** Lunch is typically between 12 pm and 2 pm, and dinner rarely starts before 7 pm, often later. Many restaurants close between lunch and dinner.
    - **Shops close for lunch:** Be aware that smaller shops, especially outside of major cities, might close for a couple of hours in the middle of the day.

By keeping these points in mind, you’re not just a tourist; you’re a thoughtful visitor, ready to immerse yourself in the rich tapestry that is coastal France. And trust me, when you manage to order that perfect *café au lait* with a confident ""Bonjour,"" you'll feel like a true insider!
