I really find it amazing how passionate you all are about this and after reading a few threads here I instantly feel welcomed.

So.. just a few days ago I firstly heard about Yerba Mate and find it very tempting to try. Until then I only thought of Mate as like a yellow/orange soda-like kinda sweet drink (e.g. Mio Mio Mate or Club-Mate) which if I understood correctly is not at all the case with Yerba Mate as it’s more bitter - at least for the first time drinking it until you acquired the taste of it.

After doing some basic googling I came across this „Starter Set“ from a German company called caámate.: https://caamate.de/products/matetee-set-bio-edelstahl-matebecher?variant=44052002144524 (I’m sorry that it’s only in German but I believe the site can be translated)

Even though the Set already comes with 3 varieties of Yerba I’m planing on also getting a pack of Canarias Serena since I heard that it’s not supposed to be as strong as others. I dont drink coffee (seen Yerba being compared to that on here) and the only bitter thing I really drink is Gin-Tonic so I don’t think that I really bring optimal starting conditions for this with me. (Please correct me on anything I say if you think I’m in the wrong!)

I’d love to get some feedback on my possible choices here and if you have other recommendations I’d love to hear about them. (Please keep in mind though that, at least for the start, I don’t want to spend a fortune on this as I don’t really know if I’ll like it in the first place)

Thanks a lot in advance for any feedback :)",1,1732755025.0,yerbamate,0,1.0,False

1h1jqap,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h1jqap/im_wearing_my_happy_face/,I'm wearing my happy face.,"But I don’t think I should be.

In fact, I think something very, very bad has happened.

It began with Nikita, Alan, and a harebrained endeavour. They were trying to pull me out of my “funk”; a quirky, palatable way of referring to clinical depression. Not that I have to worry about such things anymore.

The day has almost entirely pushed out the night.

Nikita and Alan, with conniving looks on their little faces, were chortling at me from the sofa. I tried to ignore them, instead finding purchase on the armrests of my chair; busying my fingers by kneading the fabric like dough. Stimming, folk call it. Certainly used to help me when I felt anxious.

That only temporarily kept my grinning friends at bay. Eventually, with a deep sigh, I looked up. Alan was hypnotically wiggling a little, white pill before my eyes; rubbing it between his thumb and index — enticingly, which was strange, as the tablet appeared no less ordinary than an aspirin. Than any white pill. Yet, it enchanted me. *Saw* me, though such a thing made no sense.

I groaned. “I’ve told you so many times, Alan. I’m not going to try ecstasy.”

He chuckled. “You’re so innocent, Macy. It’s not ecstasy. It’s emptanol.”

“Emptanol? That sounds made-up,” I said, though my gaze did not waver from the pill.

Alan shook his head and thrust the tablet into my palm. “It’s not.”

“Okay, what does it do?” I asked sceptically.

My friend smiled. “It gets rid of pain.”

And I replied, “I hate to tell you this, Alan, but your wonder pill has already been invented. I’ve got two boxes of paracetamol in the kitchen drawer, actually.”

“Not *physically*,” he said. “It ends mental pain. And you only need to take the *one* pill. Just one will change your life. Change your neurological makeup.”

“Well, that’s just science fiction,” I scoffed, twiddling the pill between my own fingers. “Even the best antidepressants in the world need to be taken every day. There is no ‘one-and-done’ fix.”

Alan shook his head, then nodded at the emptanol. “It’s here, Macy. The answer. No more depression, and none of the numbness that comes with Sertraline; this will make you happy.”

I sighed. “Look, I don’t know what black market drug you’ve actually bought, Alan, but I’m not taking it.”

He produced a second pill. “That’s why I’m going to take one first to put your mind at ease.”

“You’ve not even *tried* it?” I asked, hoisting my brows higher.

Alan rolled his eyes. “Of course not. I told you, Macy: *one pill*. That’s all it takes to irreversibly alter your brain chemistry. I wanted to wait. Wanted to take the journey with you.”

“Just to let you know, I’m going to sit it out,” said the ever-reserved Nikita.

I frowned. “What? Why?”

“Because Keets isn’t depressed,” Alan replied, squeezing his girlfriend’s shoulders.

“Besides, I’m going to make us some food in a second,” Nikita added. “*Proper* food. Not the takeaways you’ve been eating all week, Macy.”

“I eat proper food…” I protested, folding my arms. “I just know what I like.”

“Well, today, I’m going to cook something that none of us have ever had before,” Nikita promised, before smiling. “But it’s a surprise. It’ll be a fun way to get out of your comfort zone.”

“We’re *all* getting out of our comfort zones tonight,” Alan whispered.

Then, without any warning, he gobbled down the emptanol.

“There,” my friend said, sticking out his tongue to show that he had, in fact, ingested the drug. “We’ll wait for it to work its magic, then you’ll take yours. Okay, Macy?”

“Do you even know what you’ve just taken?” I asked, once I’d picked up my jaw. “Is it *safe*?”

“Bit late to ask that now,” Alan said, checking his watch. “Anyway, I’m supposed to notice results within the first few minutes, but my brain will rewire fully over the course of the next twenty-four hours. The seller said it would feel like day pushing out the night.”

“Right. And how does one pill fundamentally change your mind?” I asked.

He groaned. “You remember Liam from school, don’t you? LSD broke his brain. This is just the other end of the spectrum; emptanol will *fix* our brains. I mean I…”

Alan trailed off and sat silently for a few moments. Then he tilted his head to eye the coffee table with great intrigue, sparking grins from Nikita and me.

“Has it hit, sweetie?” she asked her boyfriend.

Alan hummed curiously; coldly, like a machine processing code. “What are we having for dinner, Keets?”

She smirked. “That’s all you have to say? I was expecting some enlightened, philosophical statement. Maybe the drug needs a few more minutes to work its—”

“Have you ever thought about it?” he interrupted near-breathlessly, stuck on some new train of thought.

I grinned and asked, “Thought about what?”

“What it would be like?” Alan moaned, almost orgasmically, as he ran his fingers through Nikita’s hair.

“Careful! You’re going to mess it up,” she warned.

“See, I never thought about it before,” he continued, ignoring his girlfriend and bunching up a clump of her hair in his hand. “Nikita made an interesting point about leaving our comfort zones. Trying things we’ve never tried before. It’s given me an idea. An unorthodox one. And nothing matters now, Macy. Let me show you.”

Suddenly, like a dunking bird from an office desk, Nikita’s upper body was thrust into the glass table below and hoisted straight back up; only, rather than heat, it was Alan’s hand that fuelled the engine of his toy — his firm grip on her hair. The deranged man had slammed his girlfriend’s face into the coffee table, filling it with broken shards. Blood and wailing gushed from Nikita’s lips, but not a sound gushed from mine. I simply sank into the armchair.

Alan continued. He repeatedly dunked his plaything into the wooden frame — all that remained of the table — and lifted her into an upright post. Dunked, lifted, barely paused, then started again.

“*STOP!*” I screamed as the life flitted from Nikita’s rolling eyes; eyes stained with blood running from the glass protrusions in her skin.

Alan did stop, but only half a minute later; once he’d bludgeoned the girl he loved into a lifeless mess. The calm man rose to his feet, then rolled Nikita’s twitching body to the side with a large toe, dismissing her gurgling, *fading* pleas for help.

“I was demonstrating something,” he whispered. “Look at me, Macy. I’m fine. No pain. No sorrow. I feel light; content, unlike you on that medication. This is what Nikita and I wanted for you. Not to feel nothing, but to feel *happy*.”

And that was what made me scream. Alan, having done what he’d just done, wore a beaming smile on his face. I know I was afraid, though I’ve forgotten how that felt. I’m beginning to forget how anything dark felt, as dawn has nearly broken into day.

“*GET AWAY FROM ME!*” I remember screaming.

My face was coated in a film of tears and snot as Alan approached. I tried to escape, but he quickly hurled me back into the armchair and shushed me as I shrieked for salvation. My dear friend answered that cry for help by wrestling the emptanol out of my clenched palm and prying my lips apart.

“Come on, Macy. It's time to wear your happy face. You'll never feel terror like this again,” Alan cooed, thrusting the pill into the back of my throat, then shutting my lips as I gagged. “No, Macy. Swallow.”

I mumbled a sound of refusal, and Alan gently smiled. He was so joyous, and I understand why now. He was free.

“Swallow, or you’ll want to call the police. And then I’ll have to snap your neck,” he softly said, stroking my hair with his free hand.

It wasn’t a threat. Just a promise. Not a hint of venomous spittle projected from Alan’s soft lips. He simply wanted me to feel the same way as him, and I swallowed, of course, as I didn’t want to meet the same fate as Nikita.

Then came more than serotonin. More than the simplicity of chemistry. It was an awakening. A giddiness. It wasn’t like the antidepressants. It was just that everything was bright and colourful. Beautiful.

It is only now, close to twenty-four hours later, that I find myself asking questions. I know the emptanol has almost finished its work — remodelling my mind. But I feel an urge to post this. To reach out to all of you.

Did Alan do something wrong?

He says I shouldn’t even have questions anymore. Questions are doubts, doubts are worries, and worries should be purged by emptanol.

“The chemicals must be taking a little longer to *fully* mend you, Macy,” he explained at the kitchen table. “Perfectly natural. Admittedly, I was a little uncertain when I killed Nikita. But then I remembered *why* I’d decided to do it, and I felt tremendously excited. Bludgeoning her was no different than mashing potatoes for a Sunday roast.”

I nodded and smiled, then tucked into the meal.

“Long pig,” Alan said, placing the dish in front of me. “I’m positively thrilled to be trying it with you, Macy.”

He was right. Human meat is easier to appreciate, from a culinary standpoint, once you rid yourself of morality and, in my case, neurosis. I’ve never tasted a dish so succulent. Nikita was medium-rare; perfectly cooked.

Nevertheless, the drug hadn’t quite drowned all of my pain — still hasn’t, but it was worse last night. That’s why I’m posting this. Part of me, strange as it seems, remains fearful of emptanol, though I haven’t the foggiest clue as to why. After all, it’s cured my depression.

Nikita was a *little* fiddly to eat, as I still felt residual sadness, anger, and fear. As you might imagine, that spoiled the meal ever so slightly. It didn’t sour my mood, as emptanol had already washed such a capacity away, but it certainly kept me from maximal happiness. For some reason, there lingered a horrified part of me, far from my conscious mind. I had to incessantly dab away the tears from my eyes, so as not to over-salt the meat.

And I found Nikita thoroughly delectable, but it was difficult to swallow each mouthful, as my vocal cords insisted on [screaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).",1,1732754759.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

My name is David, a 28-year-old guy from New Jersey. I'm here in search of a meaningful relationship with a like-minded individual who shares my values and aspirations.

In terms of appearance, I'm of average height at around 5'10"". I'm bald but naturally blond with a stylish beard. You'll often find me rocking black band shirts and comfy sweatshirts. If you're into a laid-back and alternative aesthetic, we might just hit it off! Here are multiple pictures of me: https://imgur.com/a/mA06N8G

When I'm not immersed in a game or exploring extreme metal music (mostly Black Metal), I enjoy the company of my friends. Together, we go on camping trips, visit museums, get dinner or treats, watch movies, play board games, and hang out. We've also visited the Renaissance faire a couple of times. I used to play music with friends as a vocalist. Recently, I've been having movie nights with one of my best friends, enjoying new movies and showing him some he's never seen.

I've also been hanging out at my local game store recently. I met a bunch of cool people there, and I enjoy playing TCGs such as Magic: The Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh, and Pokémon. Recently, I've also gotten into building model kits. Outside of the game store, I'm trying some language learning, こんにちは. I would love to play D&D, but I don't quite have the time or people, unfortunately. One of my best friend's girlfriends has expressed interest, so don't be afraid to be nerdy with us.

Professionally, I am an IT Tech. I just started at a new place, and I've been learning new things and getting along great with all my coworkers. Academically, I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Information Systems. I'm a laid-back individual who doesn't partake in drugs or party scenes (yes, I even abstain from coffee!). I don't drink alcohol either, but I don't mind if you do. My friends have beers while I'm around. Apparently, I have an INTJ personality type. I maintain a positive and lighthearted atmosphere, constantly cracking jokes with my close-knit group of friends.

In terms of my ideal partner, I'm looking for someone around the ages of 18 and 25, preferably of East Asian or Caucasian descent. As someone who's reasonably skinny, I am also looking for someone who is slim, fit, or petite. I'm not the biggest fan of tattoos or piercings either, but that's not always a dealbreaker, so don't let that completely deter you.

My long-term goals involve building a future together and creating a life filled with meaningful experiences and shared adventures.

I took my time getting ready for work and started feeling really cold and shivery.  The mornings have been cold recently so I didn’t think anything of it. I was planning to leave around 9 so I would have plenty of time to stop and get coffee on the way before my shift at 9:30. I live 15 minutes away so I’m really close to work. 

At about 8:30 I start to feel nauseous but continue getting ready. At this point I’m washed and dressed with my bag packed for the day. At 8:45 my stomach really turns and I head to the bathroom where my system totally empties itself. I start sweating and shaking visibly so I text work to say I might be late and I’m going to try to settle my stomach first. They say no problem. I text again half an hour later to say that I’m no better and I think I have a bug so they say that they will try to call someone in. 

I get a message hours later to say that we need to notify them by 3pm if we will not be in the next day and they won’t take messages after 9. They also say that they need at least an hours notice to say if we’ll be late or not coming in. By this point in the day I have a fever and let them know that I’m still very sick so they called someone to come in for tomorrow as well. 

Can they enforce any rules around when to call in sick and if so how? I was fully expecting to come in until I was basically on my way out the door and started throwing up. I don’t know what I could have even done to prepare for this. Thoughts? I really want to do this the right way but I don’t want to waste sick days if I’m not really sick but call super early anyway.

Since black friday is already going on this week, I think its the best time to start with a new coffee making hobby. I dont have any experience just watched many youtube videos and blog posts. This year I tried my first hand drip coffee in korea and I was amazed how smooth it tasted in comparison to the coffee I get from a delonghi full automatic coffee machine, which is acidic and bitter.
I don't want to go all out and lose alot of money, but quality and aesthetics are important to me.
So the gear I got my eye on are the following:

- Fellow Stagg EKG Pro
- Fellow Ode (Gen 1)
- Hario V60 (ceramic or metal)
- Hario V60 Range server

Do you guys think it is good to start with this setup? Or should I just ditch everything besides the ode gen 1 and get a fellow aiden? The reviews I read are pretty good and it seems way more easy than do everything myself. 
The fellow stagg ekg pro would be handy to do some tea brewing aswell, since I dont own a temperature controlled kettle.

The seller repaired it due to the constant clogging, slow (sometimes minutes-long) grind times per shot, and mess due to all the static. But, after less than a week of 2-3 shots per day, it is effectively unusable again. The seller insists this is normal for dark roasts with a DF54. I feel scammed and will never use that brand or shop again.

So, I’ve ordered a Baratza ESP. I’ve previously used a friend’s. I had no issue at all with static or clogging—even with the same beans, which I could grind much finer without any problems—and it gave the coffee a velvety mouthfeel that I don’t get from the DF54. 

I’ve ordered the Introvert single hopper bellows. I already have a WDT, spring tamper, metal dosing cup, and sprayer in case I try RDT with it.

But I want one more piece of kit that I can’t find. The dosing cup sits on a tiny stand inside the stand, leaving a gap of several cm where grinds could fly out.

1h1jec7,https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1h1jec7/assessing_the_best_crops_for_getting_to_10/,Assessing the Best Crops for Getting to 10 Farming as Fast as Possible,"**TL;DR: Green Beans, Hot Peppers, Eggplants.** Plant as many as you can early in the season for best results.

I couldn't find a guide covering this- let alone one that really explained its thought process, so I'm making my own. While planning out a soulless Joja-only run to get a Gold Clock by the end of Year 2 I ran some numbers, found the fastest way to max out my farming skill, and got 10 Farming by the middle of summer, year 1. Here's what I figured out.

**Criteria for Determining the Best Crops**

There's two metrics that I think are very handy to consider when focusing on farming experience- XP gained per Gold spent and XP gained per day.

XP per gold spent (XP/G) is the metric you want to pay attention to if you have lots of farming space and want the biggest bang for your buck when buying seeds. The only problem with this metric is that it assumes you have all the sprinklers and all the space in the world to work with. Some savvy players can push out 20+ quality sprinklers by summer if they wanted to, but if space or sprinklers become limited another metric takes over.

XP per Day (XP/d) is for when your farming space is starting to get limited. It looks at which crops are good at giving out the most XP per day for the time that crop is there. The catch is that crops that excel at this are often costly upfront and/or don't lend themselves to amazing profit margins. This metric is worth paying attention to if you don't have much space to work with, money investment or return rates are a non-issue, or you somehow have a seedmaker and want to make good use of it.

I will be focusing mostly on the former because a farm focusing on that will be far more effective than a farm focusing on the latter. If a crop is great for XP/day or money in some way I'll mention it. I'm also leaving out Year 2 crops and Oasis crops in my comparisons unless something stands out about them.

Without further ado let's see which crops are great in spring.

**SPRING - green beans, free seeds, some potatoes and parsnips**

Year 1 Spring crop XP/G ranking:

* Green Bean - **0.90 XP/G** (Planted Day 1, Harvest on 11, 14, 17, 20 23, 26) (6 x 9XP / 60G)
* Parsnip - 0.40 XP/G  (8XP / 20G) (best XP/G past the 13th)
* Strawberry - 0.36 XP/G (Plant on 13, harvest on 21, 25) (2 x 18XP /100G) (highest raw return on investment for spring- even if planted on the 13th. Raw meaning ""sold once harvested and not processed in any way"")
* Tulip - 0.35 XP/G (7XP / 20G)
* Jazz Flower - 0.33 XP/G (10XP / 30G)
* Cauliflower - 0.29 XP/G (23XP / 80G) 
* Potatoes - 0.28 XP/G (14XP / 50G) (highest gold/day besides Spring 13 strawberries)
* Kale - 0.24 XP/G (17XP / 70G) (best XP/day)

A green bean trellis planted on the 3rd or sooner that's been watered every day will net you 54 XP per 60 G spent by the end of the season. Planted on the 5th or 6th it will only net 45 XP per trellis, but doing so is the safer route should you want to build a scarecrow first and avoid crows.

Free seeds are always good, but if you can't find any parsnips are the best XP/G on the 13th and beyond. Any mixed seeds, carrot seeds, rice shoots, coffee beans, or ancient seeds will all give farming XP without costing any gold. Spring seeds as of version 1.6 offer 3 farming xp each over 7 days. So you can plant those, but you're not missing out on much if you don't.

Cauliflower is relatively weak until you can pickle it for 400 G. On paper it has a slightly larger profit margin than potatoes, but keep in mind you can grow two generations of potatoes and get more XP than you would with one cauliflower. Pickling it is great if you can sell it before the end of the season, but beyond that it's not worth heavily investing in.

Kale is weak overall. On paper it offers the best XP/day in year 1, but with 210 G in your pocket it's better to buy 4 sets of potato seeds than 3 sets of kale seeds in terms of both XP and raw profit.

Parsnips are great for filling empty space or planting on the 23rd/24th when you can't grow anything else before the season ends.

In Year 2- Day 1 strawberries are the best crop in spring in terms of XP/G (0.90), XP/d, raw profit ratio, net raw profit, and net keg profit. In Year 2 garlic takes over kale for most XP/day and is far cheaper. With bus access rhubarb is better than strawberries if your keg throughput is choked up.

**SUMMER - hot peppers, some hops**

Year 1 Summer crop XP/G ranking:

* Hot Pepper -  **1.80 XP/G** (Harvest on 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27) (8 x 9XP / 40G)
* Hops - **1.70 XP/G** (Harvest on 12, 13, 14... 28) (17 x 6XP / 60 G) (great for kegging, most XP/day if planted at the start of the month)
* Tomato - 1.20 XP/G (Harvest on 12, 16, 20, 24, 28) (5 x 12XP / 50 G)
* Corn - 0.73 XP/G (Harvest on 15, 19, 23, 27, Fall 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27) (11 x 10XP / 150G)
* Sunflower - 0.67 XP/G (Harvest on 9, 17, 25, Fall 5, 13, 21) (Assuming one seed dropped every harvest, 6 x 14XP / 125G at Joja Mart)
* Wheat - 0.60 XP/G (6XP / 10G) (great for kegging and hay)
* Blueberries - 0.50 XP/G (Harvest on 14, 18, 22, 26) (4 x 10XP / 80G) (10XP per harvest, not per berry. These aren't good for leveling with)
* Radish - 0.38 XP/G (15XP / 40G)
* Melon - 0.34 XP/G (27XP / 80G) (good for kegging if starfruit seeds aren't in your budget)
* Summer Spangle - 0.30 XP/G (15XP / 50G)
* Poppy - 0.20 XP/G (20XP / 100G) (Highest XP/d past the 7th)
* Sunflower - 0.11 XP/G (Assuming no seeds drop at harvest) (14XP / 125G at Joja Mart)

It takes 209 hot pepper plants on summer 1 or 2 to rocket you from 0 to 10 farming by the end of Summer... and it only costs 8360 G. They're not great in terms of profit, but they can go in preserve jars, kegs, and even dehydrators if you really don't want to sell them raw. Personally I gift the highest-quality ones to Lewis and Shane.

Alternatively hops are not much worse in terms of xp/cost efficiency and offer the highest XP/day. Having 148 hop starters on Day 1 can get you from from 0 to 10 Farming by the end of the season (8880 G, 102 XP per plant). Furthermore they become very profitable when you get kegs and the Artisan profession. The only nuance is that they should be planted on day 1, and they grow on trellises like green beans. You have to plan ahead a bit to plant these properly, or maybe couple them with another crop (like hot peppers).

Planting more hot peppers continues to be the best XP/G crop up until the 17th. After that wheat takes over for the most XP/d. Wheat is a really good crop overall in this game.  

Poppies offer the highest XP/day between the 7th and 21st, but it's not by much. The seeds are 100 G each, which is pretty high considering Wheat is 10 times cheaper and offers far more profit.

Not much changes in Year 2- except Starfruit if you can get to Oasis. Those offer pretty good XP/day and are less demanding than hops, and best of all they make you *filthy rich* when placed in a keg.

**FALL - eggplant, some grapes and wheat**

Fall crop XP/G ranking for year 1:

* Eggplant - **3.00 XP/G** (Harvest on 6, 11, 16, 21, 26) (5 x 12XP / 20G)
* Grape - 1.40 XP/G (Harvest on 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26) (6 x 14XP / 60G) (high XP/day)
* Wheat - 0.60 XP/G (6XP / 10G) (gives hay, great for kegging)
* Yam - 0.44 XP/G (22XP / 50G)
* Sunflower - 0.34 XP/G (Harvest on 9, 17, 25) (Assuming one seed dropped every harvest, 3 x 14XP / 125G at Joja Mart)
* Pumpkin - 0.31 XP/G (31XP / 100G) (decent for kegging)
* Amaranth - 0.30 XP/G (21XP / 70G)
* Cranberries - 0.29 XP/G (Harvest on 8, 13, 18, 23, 28) (5 x 14XP / 240G) (best raw product value)
* Bok Choy 0.28 XP/G (14XP / 50G) (highest XP/day)
* Corn - 0.27 XP/G (Harvest on 15, 19, 23, 27) (4 x 10XP / 150G)
* Fairy Rose - 0.15 XP/G (29XP / 200G) (great for honey farming)
* Sunflower - 0.11 XP/G (Assuming no seeds drop at harvest) (14XP / 125G at Joja Mart)

It's no longer summer and you didn't hit 10 Farming? Not a problem; your options get even better. Having 250 eggplant plants planted by Fall 3 (5000 G, 60 XP per plant) will catapult you from 0 to 10 Farming by the end of the season guaranteed.

Grape Starters excel in having both a high XP/day while also offering decent XP/G and profits if kegged or jarred. The only drawback is that they go on trellises, so planning ahead is necessary and they need to be planted early in the season.

If it's midseason or later wheat will always be there to make you some extra profit here and there.

If you have a seedmaker early in the season and some extra space, then bok choy becomes a great crop for XP. Chucking what you grow into the machine offsets the expensive 50 G per seed and generates more seeds. It only takes 4 days to grow, which means you can make a lot of bok choy seeds the earlier in the season you start. Better yet you can sell the higher-quality crops for more money and use the lower-quality crops to make more seeds. This can also be done with Garlic in Year 2 Spring if Winter comes before Farming 10.

**WINTER - not much you can do**

You'll either need to have dozens of farm animals or have thousands of winter seeds planted (in version 1.6+) to get the kind of farming XP crops offer in other seasons. In other words it's better to focus on other skills or add more animals to your farm during this time. 

**CLOSING STATEMENT**

I hope that wasn't too dense of a read. In some of my earliest playthroughs I thought having about a thousand tilled squares was necessary to get lots of XP. Now I know the sprinkler area of the Beach Farm is more than enough to finish the community center while also getting 10 farming by the end of Year 1 Fall.

Finally, something you said is actually funny. ( Laughing ) ( Laughs ) Yeah, I do kid a lot, but, no, this is actually... Christmas three times bigger!

( Clinking ) ( Max barks softly ) ( Wind whooshing ) ( Lively chatter ) Narrator: From the edge of his ledge way up in the sky the Grinch felt upset, though he wasn't sure why. It could've been Christmas, all thatjoy and the such or some thoughts from his past that he just couldn't quite touch. But whatever it was, it made his heart moan. ( Sighs ) Though he was used to it now, this being alone. And now safe in his cave, and apart from the fray, he reminded himself... ( Sighs ) It is better this way. ( Max whines ) That's right, yeah. Just right there. No. No. ( Footsteps thudding ) ( Indistinct chatter ) Whoa! ( Grunts ) Cindy-Lou! Don't worry, Mom! ( Grunting ) ( Groans ) I'm wearing four ski jackets. Four jackets? Aren't you a little hot? ( Grunts ) Yep. Sweating a little bit. Are you going somewhere? North Pole. Oh, wow! Any, uh, particular reason? I gotta talk to Santa. Santa, huh? Yeah. It's really important. Well, it must be if you need to go see him in person. It sure is. Okay, then. Well, good luck and I guess I'll see you in about a month. Wait. It takes a whole month to get to the North Pole? Oh, yeah. At least. Christmas will be over by the time I got there. Ah, that's true. Now, we would miss you at Christmas. Wow, I guess I'm gonna have to come up with another plan. Hey, maybe while you're thinking, you could put the halo on the angel. Okay. ( Children giggling ) You wanna take your jackets off? Yeah, at least one or two of them. ( Both laughing ) Donna: No, boys. Don't pull the angel's wings off. She needs those. ( Clock gongs ) ( Christmas carol playing ) So, uh... What do you wanna do today? ( Whines ) ( Upbeat song playing ) ( Horn honking ) No idea, huh? Ooh, I got one. ( Organ playing somber music ) ( Cymbal crashes ) ( Organ playing ) ( Whines ) ( Grunts ) All right, all right. I'm sorry. You're a good dog. ( Scoffs ) But a bad drummer. What would you like to do? More than embarrassing to be beaten by a dog. ( Toy squeaks ) Oh, what's that? ( Barks ) And checkmate! Again. ( Rumbling ) What in the world is happening? ( Gasps ) What is that? It's the most beautiful Christmas tree you've ever seen. ( Laughs ) Three times bigger? That's a hundred times bigger! Oh, you just wait till we light it tonight. It'll sparkle so bright you'll be celebrating Christmas with the rest of us. Ho-ho! ( Groans ) Bricklebaum: Oh, man! I can't wait. I'm gonna keep at it. I'll see you later, Grinchy! No! You will not see me later, and I will not be celebrating. And that tree, that tree has got to go. Come on, Mom. Cindy-Lou, look over there. Wow! That's amazing! Thank you! ( Growling ) Ooh, a three-eyed sock monster! Awesome robot! Mayor McGerkle: Oh, how marvelous this time of year is. Welcome, Who-ville, to the annual tree-lighting ceremony. How spectacular are these ornaments? Look what I made, everybody. It's a Christmas dragon. It came to me in a dream. ( Chuckles ) Oh, man! Hey, Bartholomew! Hey there, Ms. Who. Here you go! Got it! Find a good spot for it. There it goes. Mayor McGerkle: Now, let's get ready to flip that switch and light up the sky. ( Chuckles ) Oh, no! Not on my watch, you don't. See you guys soon! I'm gonna go find Groopert. Okay. Have fun. Bye. Say bye. Here you go. I hope your big brother gets what he deserves. Hey, Groopert, how's business? Good. What I can't sell I can always eat. I need to talk to you about something really important. Okay. Come on. Let's go. All right, check this out, Groopert. I'm gonna stay up on Christmas Eve this year and meet Santa Claus. Whoa, that is crazy! Yeah, I really gotta talk to him. About what? Well, it's really personal. But I'm going to tell you because you're my best friend. It's about my mom. She works all night and takes care of us all day. And it just isn't fair. She acts like she's fine, but I know it's really hard for her. So I figured if anyone could fix that, it'd be Santa. Wow. And I just asked him for a turtle. Mayor McGerkle: Here we go! Oh, it's starting. Okay, Who-ville, it is time to light this beautiful tree. ...17, 18, 19 and 20. ( Chuckling ) Okay, lock and load. All right, just attach this here and we'll be ready to launch. ( Grunts ) ( Whines, barking ) I know! I wish I could see the look on their faces. Whoa! ( Exclaiming ) ( Shouting ) Whoa! ( Grunting ) ( Panting ) Okay. Oh, boy! ( Grunts ) ( Sighs in relief ) Wow. That could be so much worse. ( Screaming ) Let's begin the countdown. All: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two... Hey! My dragon can fly! ...one! ( All cheering ) Oh, my! No, no, no! No, no! Whoa! Wow! Oh, it's beautiful. There it is, the most beautiful tree Who-ville has ever seen. ( Panting ) No! No! ( Exclaiming ) ( Shouting ) ( Groans ) No! No, no. Narrator: He walked through the crowd and the sound, and the lights. And his ears heard the thump of theirjoy and delights. And it took him right back to his earliest years, to that lost, lonely boy who cried all of those tears. That lost, lonely boy, isolated and sad with no home of his own, no mom and no dad. ( Gasping ) And as the Grinch looked around, he felt downright scared as he remembered that Christmas where nobody cared. Where nobody showed, not even a flea, and there were no cards, no gifts, and no tree. ( Lively chatter, laughter ) And as he watched other kids, one thing became clear, that this was the single worst day of the year. And now here it was, that day once again when he felt all those feelings he felt way back when. When he'd watch Whos young and old all sit down to feast, and they'd feast, and they'd feast, and they'd feast, feast, feast, feast. They'd feast on Who-pudding, and rare Who roast beast. Which is something the Grinch could not stand in the least. And then they'd do something he liked least of all. Every Who down in Who-ville, the tall and the small, would stand close together with Christmas bells ringing. They'd stand hand-in-hand and the Whos would start singing. They'll sing, and they'll sing, and they'll sing, sing, sing, sing. Narrator: Yes, he couldn't recall without feeling the sting. So the Grinch finally declared... ( Whispers ) I must stop this whole thing. Why? For 53 years I've put up with it. Now... I must stop this Christmas from coming, but how? ( Organ jarring ) ( Whines ) ( Organ plays note ) Narrator: Then he got an idea, an awful idea. The Grinch got a wonderful, awful idea. I know just what to do. I'm going to steal their Christmas. ( Organ playing ) All the trimmings. All the trappings. All their gifts and garlands. When they wake and see it's gone then all their joy and happiness will be gone as well. ( Thunder crashes ) So prepare yourself, Max. For, tomorrow we begin. ( Echoing ) ( Bell ringing ) ( Yawns ) ( Barks ) ( Upbeat music playing ) ( Grunting ) Genius starts with the abs, Max. ( Growls softly ) It's go time. And now, the question we have all been waiting for. How will I steal Christmas? Well, prepare to have your little doggy mind blown. Poof. ( Panting ) ( Creaking ) Ta-da! ( Chuckles ) That's right. I become Santa Claus. But instead of giving all the joy and happiness, I'll take it away. If he can deliver Christmas to the whole world in one night, then I can certainly steal it from little old Who-ville. I mean, come on, what's Santa have that I don't? ( Barks ) That's hurtful. ( Grunts ) Um, what are you doing with my bowling ball? Chasing it. And you're taking it where? It's a secret. ( Sighs ) All right, but not without breakfast. Catch. Whoa, waffles, my favorite! Thanks! See you guys later! ( Grunts ) Here we go. Hey, Cindy-Lou! Oh, hey there, Mr. Cubbins. ( Cawing ) ( Hooting ) ( Grunting ) Ready. All right. Let's go. ( Exclaiming ) Hold on! Both: Whoo! Yeah! Let's go, let's go. Let's move. ( Grunting ) Hang on! Whoo! And dismount. ( Squirting ) So, what do we know? Waffles are delicious. Super delicious. But I meant about meeting Santa. We know no one's ever done it. Hmm... Okay. How about this? I'm gonna sit in the living room with my eyes wide open, like this, and if I start to drift off, I'll just open them wider! I'm pretty sure you're gonna fall asleep. And by the time you wake up... He'll be gone. ( Whooshes ) Nothing but cookie crumbs. Yeah, you're right. I got it. Tell me! Maple syrup. All right, maple syrup. We pour it on the roof, the reindeer get stuck and then they can't fly away. Science! Won't the syrup just freeze? Good point. Also, how do we get all that syrup on the roof? Yeah, I got nothing. ( Both sigh ) Wait a minute. I think I got it. What? We're gonna need the whole gang for this one. Okay. If I'm gonna become Santa, then I need to get into character. All right. Let's see. ""Christmas tree, Christmas traditions, Christmas pudding."" How does pudding work its way into everything? Where is the Santa stuff? Look at this, little girls and boys giggling over sugarplums. Oh. Look how they did the roof of the gingerbread house with vanilla icing. Hmm. Little family of gumdrops. ( Clears throat ) Huh. So dumb. So, so stupidly dumb. Ah, here we are! ""The Legend of Santa Claus. Red suit, white beard. Always in a jolly mood."" Oh. That's not gonna happen. Oh, well. Let's just start by finding ourselves some reindeer. ( Yips ) ( Deep sigh ) Beautiful, isn't it, Max? This, my little friend, is the Rein-Horn. It perfectly recreates the mating call of the reindeer. Behold. ( Rein-horn blowing ) ( Bleating ) Oh. Hey, there. Sorry, little goat. I was calling for a... ( Screaming ) ( Gasps ) What was that? Scram! Skedaddle! Strange goat. ( Bleats ) Now, reindeer migrate, so maybe we'll catch a few headed south for the winter. I also read that they tend to mate in densely wooded... Will you stop following us? ( Bleats ) Shoo! Away! Go back to the goat farm! Go eat a can. ( Sighs ) ( Bleats sadly ) All right, now that that's over, back to the task at hand. ( Wind whooshing ) Whoo. It's a little crisp. Oh, it's getting really cold. Oh, goodness! Can't feel my lips! Can't blink. Eyes frozen! ( Gasps ) Max, we've hit the mother lode. ( Gasps ) We'll have 100 reindeer to pull our... ( Screaming ) ( Reindeer bellowing ) ( Bleating ) ( Sighs ) ( Reindeer bellows ) Huh? Well, Santa had eight. He looks like he ate the other seven. Watch and learn, Max. All right. ( Gasps ) ( Gasps ) ( Sniffing ) ( Screaming ) ( Bellowing ) ( Grunting ) ( Screaming ) ( Laughs ) ( Grinch groaning ) ( Reindeer grunting ) ( Grinch exclaiming ) Frozen, stinking... Stop, stop. Onward, my furry friends. We're walking toward destiny. ( Crowd cheering ) All right, you called, we came. So what's up? Yeah, what's the deal? Thanks for getting here so fast, guys. Follow me. So what's the big secret? Yeah, I don't have very long. My parents set the timer. Dude. Don't ask. It's new. All right, everybody, brace yourselves. In exactly 48 hours we're going to do something that's never been done before. We're gonna trap Santa Claus! Trap Santa? Why would we wanna do that? Duh. To steal all his toys. I love it. That's a great idea. Not to steal his toys. To, um... To talk to him. What? Why'd you wanna talk to him? It's personal. Yeah, it's kinda personal. Well, I don't wanna do it if you won't tell me why. What are you talking about, ""personal""? Axl, when you asked to borrow $16 and my mom's suitcase, did I ask you why? No. ( Ozzy chuckles ) And what about you, Ozzy?

( Grinch yelping ) ( Bells jingling ) Ooh! Holy moly! Man, I don't know what's in this cake, but I think I just saw Santa Claus. ( Laughs ) Let me get another piece. ( Laughing ) Today was great! We did mean things and we did them in style. ( Whines ) Max, you know the rules. You sleep in your bed, and I sleep in... ( Reindeer grunting ) Oh, no, no, not you, too. I don't believe this.

Now that is a great cup of coffee! ( Max grumbles ) ( Bellows ) Max, this morning, you and I need to do some recon. Fred, you just sit right there. And don't touch anything! Intel, Max, that's what we're after. How many houses are in Who-ville and how many Whos? How many wreaths and trees and chimney flues? I'll be in your ear the whole time, and whatever you're seeing ( Through comms ) I'll be seeing on the monitor. Ready? Now off you go, Max. ( Whines ) Fly, boy! Fly! ( Barks ) Max, stop socializing! Now, let's go in for a look. Okay. Six houses on Oak Street... Oh, watch out! What? Oh. Grinch: Okay. Go, go, go, go! Now cut through Main Street and survey the south side. ( Lively chatter ) Look at those greedy little gift monsters. Loading themselves up with Christmas junk. Okay, Max, turn right here. So I woke up this morning, got dressed, had my coffee, went outside, looked on the roof. My sleigh was gone. My, my, I wonder who took it. ( Grinch chuckles ) Huh? Okay, let's see here. If we do 28 houses an hour for six hours, that would be sausages. ( Exclaims ) Sausages? Max! Don't even think about it. ( Whines ) Max! Max, are you okay? Max? Oh, hey, look, it's me. Oh, dear. ( Groans ) ( Groans ) Bad dog. Fred! We're home! Fred! What are you doing? Okay. Come on, we got work to do. Now, let's plan our route. First, now, we go south, quick jaunt to the east, and then this house, skip the subdivision for the moment, knock off the entire southeast quadrant of the town. And then we finish it all up on Whistling Who Lane. That's 223 houses and only seven hours of darkness to work with. That means we have to be fast and focused. And believe you me, there will be temptation... ( Buzzes ) ...all around us. Behold! The present! This is our enemy. You will want to unwrap it and play with it. ( Whines ) Hmm. But you must not! And if you can get past the present, the only obstacle left is the cookie. Look at it in all its red, sugary splendor. ( Sniffing, bellows ) No, no, no! Look at yourselves! Discipline! We must... ( Chomping ) ( Panting ) ( Sighs ) Resist. Are you ready? Groopert: Almost. Good. Think jolly. Ozzy: And fat. Groopert: Okay, I'm ready. All right, quick. Everybody hide! Three, two, one, cue Santa! That means you, Groopert. ( Exclaims, groans ) ( In monotone ) hо, hо, hо, hо. Look at this pretty house. I will leave presents for the people. Come on, it's not the school play, dude. Then why do I have to wear the outfit? Groopert, focus! Just get the cookie. But I can see the string. Stop worrying! It'll be dark at night. What if he has a flashlight? Have you ever seen a picture of Santa with a flashlight? No, but I just... Groopert! Just pick up the cookie! Hmm. What do we have here? A delicious little cookie. ( Groopert shouts ) Groopert! Groopert? Groopert: Uh, hey, guys. Do I still get to eat the cookie? ( Max barks ) ( Fred grunts ) Grinch: All right. So, I tinkered with our sleigh a bit. Behold! ( Whirring ) Look at this, Max. Now you'll be riding in style. A throne for a barking prince. How do you like that? ( Barks ) All right, Fred, you are the engine of this great machine. Understood? ( Low grunting ) Good. Now, remember, this is just a practice run. But on this team, we practice like we play. So, let's leave it all out on the snow. ( Bellows ) Whoa! Okay! All right, how about that? Now, let's pick up the pace and see how she handles. ( Shouting ) Whoo! Hang on! No, no, no. No problem! It's all under control. Hold on! ( All shouting ) Whoa! ( Laughing ) We're doing it, Max. We are doing it! We will not be... Stopped? What happened? Fred? Oh. Um... Sorry, but we don't need any more reindeer. No. Go. Get. Shoo. I have what I need. ( Bellowing ) ( Sighs ) It's okay, Fred. ( Grunts softly ) ( Whines ) ( Sighs ) On our own again, Max. ( Wind whooshing ) ( Clock ticking ) Narrator: It was the day before Christmas and the Whos were abuzz, all doing the things that a Christmas Who does. Some were out buying presents, others just milled about. There you go, sir. But the whole town feltjoyous of that, there was no doubt. ( Camera shutters clicking ) The weather was perfect, and soon snow would fall. This surely would be... Everyone ready? ...the best Christmas of all. ( Bell dinging ) Max! There you are! Check this out! Whoa! Ah! I've been making lots of cool... Whoa! ( Laughs ) Stuff. Ooh, more coffee! ( Slurps ) It's gonna be a big night. We got all the gizmos and gazmos we need, but we still don't have the proper outfit. Come on, let's do a little stitching. ( Whirring ) There's only one thing left to do. Max, do you know what you are? You are a sturdy little fella. And loyal. Very loyal. In fact, I think you're the best dog a Grinch could hope for. ( Whines ) And that is why I'm promoting you. Max, you will guide my sleigh tonight. ( Barking ) Ha-ha! I knew you wouldn't let me down. Narrator: It was now Christmas Eve. There was joy in the air. For in just a few hours, Santa Claus would be there. And the gifts would be left, and the stockings all filled. And the anticipation, well, it started to build. Woman: Ozzy, what are you doing? Trying to get myself tired. ( Panting ) All right, eight hours till Christmas morning. That's 28,800 seconds. Okay, and sleep! Waffle One, this is Waffle Two. Are you there? Over. Cindy-Lou: I read you loud and clear, Waffle Two. Groopert: This is Groopert, by the way. Cindy-Lou: Yeah, I got that. Groopert: Oh. I just wanted to wish you good luck with Santa Claus. Thanks. Talk tomorrow. So, you got any last-minute wishes for Santa? Yep. I have one great big wish. Good. Because you deserve everything you want and more. Thanks, Mom. I want the same thing for you. ( Sighs ) How did I end up with such a wonderful daughter? I don't know. Sometimes you just get lucky. Well, then I really did. Me, too. I love you, Mom. I love you, sweetheart. Good night. Good night. Narrator: The Grinch was now ready to start his big trip. He stood like a captain aboard a great ship. Yes, the time had now come to take off like a shot. Here we go, Max. Let's see what you've got! ( Barking ) What? Max? Max, are you okay? ( Creaks ) Huh? Yeah, Max! Attaboy! Go, boy! Go! ( Max barking ) ( Laughing ) Narrator: And down the Grinch came on his great fateful ride toward the good homes of Who-ville and the Christmas inside. ( Grinch cackling ) He had planned it and prepped it, big detail to small. Yes, he'd get rid of Christmas now, once and for all. You take the outside, I'll take the inside. House number one. Narrator: He was ready to pounce, and set the score right. He'd make up for the past, and he'd do it tonight. Okay. Now let's steal Christmas. Narrator: He swept up their presents with the speed of a wiz. And he knew he'd cause sadness, only theirs now, not his. ( Vacuum whirring ) ( Clicks ) ( Chuckles evilly ) All this excess and nonsense it was all about greed. About meaningless stuff that they didn't even need. Yeah. ( Chuckles ) The Grinch went to work. He scooped up the toys. He raced against time, he raced againstjoy. He hit a few snags as he made his way through... ( Yowling ) ...an angry orange cat and a sleepwalking Who. ( Gasps ) Huh? Thank you, Mommy. Narrator: He stole pop guns and bicycles, roller skates, drums, checker boards, tricycles, popcorn and plums. Gadgets and gizmos and dolls with strange names, goofballs and shloof-balls and video games. And he swiped, and he poached. Yes, the stealing was on. And this day that he hated, well, he made it be gone. This is it. The last house. ( Singing ) ♪ Dashing through the snow in a one-dog open sleigh ♪ ( Grunting ) ♪ One more house to go and Christmas goes away ♪ ( Grunts, laughs ) ( Scatting ) Huh? ( Sighs ) Oh, what the heck. ( Sighs ) Huh? ( Yelping ) ( Bells clinking ) He's here! What the... ( Groans, exclaiming ) ( Grunting ) How do I get out of this? Santa Claus. Oh. Hello. A little help, please. I'll let you down, just give me a minute. Oh, that'd be great. I'm coming. Just trying to remember which cord it is. ( Groaning ) Oh, no! I'm so sorry, are you okay? Yeah. I guess so. Let me help you. ( Sighs ) Sit down here. Drink this. It'll make you feel better. Uh... Thanks. Wow. I can't believe it's really you! Uh... Yeah. I'm so sorry about the trap and everything, but I really need... Hey! Why are you taking our Christmas tree? ( Spits ) Well... One of the lights wasn't working, so I thought I'd take it back to the workshop and see if I could fix it. I didn't know you did that. Yeah. Sure. Now, why don't you go back upstairs to bed, and then when you wake up the tree will be fixed and your presents will be waiting under it. Wait. You don't understand, I don't want presents. ( Chuckles ) Of course you do. Everyone wants presents. No, no, really, I don't! I want you to help my mom. Your mom? Yeah. She works so hard and is always doing stuff for other people, and I just want her to be happy. You want me to help your mom? You're Santa. You make people happy. And everyone should be happy, right? ( Stammers ) Yeah... I guess they should. Santa, are you okay? What? Uh... Yeah. I'm fine. ( Chuckles ) Now, why don't you go back up to bed, hmm? Okay. I wish you could celebrate with us tomorrow. We all get together and sing. It's so beautiful that if you close your eyes and listen, all of your sadness just goes away. That sounds nice. ( Chuckles ) Huh? Thank you, Santa. Good night. Good... Good night. ( Whines ) I just met the strangest little Who girl. ( Whines ) All right, Max. Let's go. Narrator: He tried to forget it, but the words filled his head and he found himself thinking about what the young girl had said. It was hard to imagine. Could it really be true? But if they could all be happy, maybe he could be, too. ( Yawns ) ( Gasps ) ( Gasps ) ( Giggling ) What? Narrator: Her head felt unsteady, and her heart was just sick. Oh, no! It must be a joke or a prank, or a trick. Who would do such a thing? Who would stoop down this low? And then one little girl realized she might just know. 3,000 feet up, up the side of Mount Crumpit, the Grinch rode with his load to the tip-top to dump it. Keep going. We're gonna make it. Izzy: Oh, dear. What... What happened? Where's the decorations? All the presents. Aw, man! Mom, it's my fault. What... What is? All of this. I trapped Santa last night because I wanted to ask him to do something special for you. But I think I made him mad and that's why he stole everyone's Christmas. No! No, no. No, honey, this isn't your fault. He didn't steal Christmas, he just stole stuff. Christmas is in here. And besides, I already have the greatest gift I could ever get. You. ( Grunting ) Just one more shove. ( Singing in distance ) What's that? Do you hear it? They're singing? I don't understand, Max. Don't they know what I've done? Narrator: As he watched the small girl, he thought he might melt. If he did what she did, would he feel what she felt? And the luscious sound swelled, reaching up to the skies. And the Grinch heard with his heart, and it tripled in size. ( Heart beating ) ( Gasping ) ( Gasping ) ( Sighs ) What? Oh, no! ( Shouts ) No! No, no, no! Oh, no! ( Shouting ) ( Grunting ) No, don't worry. I got it. ( Barking ) Max, it's okay. I'm... ( Shouts ) ( Exclaiming ) Oh, no, no, no. Max! ( Grunts ) Huh? ( Grunting ) ( Max barks ) ( Fred grunting ) Fred? ( Bellowing ) ( Bleats ) You... You came back. ( Grunts softly ) Max, the gifts! We have to return them. ( Barks ) Narrator: And having heard the Whos' goodness, having felt the Whos' song, he tried to make right what he had made wrong. ( Trumpet playing ) ( All murmuring ) Uh... Hello, everybody. Uh... Uh... It was me. I stole your Christmas. I stole it because... Because I thought it would fix something that happened a long time ago. But it didn't, and I'm sorry. I'm so very sorry. For everything. ( Max barks ) Not now, Max. I need to be alone. ( Bell ringing ) ( Stammers ) I kind of thought you might like it. You don't like it? Oh, I could take it back. It's not a big deal. I just thought maybe you... ( Barking ) ( Barking ) ( Toy squeaking ) Oh, hey. ( Chuckling ) Merry Christmas to you, too, Max. ( Squeaking ) ( Laughing ) ( Sighs ) That's gonna get old. ( Knocking at door ) What was that? Huh? Uh, hello. Hi. Remember me? Yes. Yes, I do. I remember you. My name is Cindy-Lou. Cindy-Lou Who. It's nice to meet you, Cindy-Lou. Oh, my name is Grinch. ( Toy squeaking ) And, uh, this is Max. ( Chuckles ) Whoa! Nice to meet you, Max. I just came to invite you to our house for Christmas dinner. What? Me? But I took your gifts. Yeah, I know. And your trees. Yep. I stole your whole Christmas. I know you did. But we're inviting you anyway. But why? Because you've been alone long enough. Dinner's at 6:00! Don't be late. And make sure you bring your sweet doggy, too! ( Sighs ) ( Sighing ) ( Lively chatter ) ( Christmas music playing ) Right. Okay. Mmm. Hmm. ( Panting ) Um, this is a bad idea. ( Stammers ) I can't do this. I can't do this. They're all gonna hate me. ( Sighs ) All right. ( Grunts ) ( Doorbell rings ) I did it. Oh, Mr. Grinch. I'm so happy you decided to come. Welcome! Thank you for inviting me. Uh, I wore a tie. And it's a very nice tie. Cindy-Lou, look who came! Mr. Grinch! You're here! Hello! Come on in, I'll show you around. Oh. Okay. ( Lively chatter ) ( Christmas music playing ) Hello, Mr. Grinch. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you, too. Aunt Ida, I'd like you to meet my friend, the Grinch. Oh, it's nice to meet you, Mr. Grinch. Thank you. It's nice to be here. ( Grunting ) Oh, here, let me take that for you. Oh, thank you. Cindy-Lou, could you make a little room for this, please? No, don't worry. I've got it. Oh, isn't that thoughtful? ( Children laughing ) Bricklebaum: Is that grouchy, grumpy Grinchy I see standing over there? ( Laughs ) Bricklebaum, good to see you. Come on, Grinchy, give me a hug. Oh! ( Chuckles ) It don't count if you don't hug back, buddy. Okay, come take your seats, everyone. Dinner's ready. Come on, you're sitting next to me. Here you go. ( Slurping ) ( Gasps ) ( Lively chatter ) This is my first Christmas dinner. What happens? You'll see. Would you do the honors, Mr. Grinch? Oh. Uh, okay. Do you mind if I say something first? Not at all. Um, well, everybody, I just want to say, I've spent my entire life hating Christmas and everything about it. But now I see that it wasn't Christmas I hated, it was being alone. But I'm not alone anymore. And I have all of you to thank for it. But especially this little girl right here. Ma'am, your daughter's kindness changed my life. That's my girl. Oh, that was beautiful. That's my best friend. Merry Christmas, Mr. Grinch. Merry Christmas, Cindy-Lou. ( Barks ) Narrator:And the Grinch raised his glass, and led the Whos in a toast. To kindness and love, the things we need most.

1h1jbwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlternateDayFasting/comments/1h1jbwt/update_on_ny_adf/,Update on Ny ADF,"8 months ago my total cholesterol was at 255. At that time I began charging what I ate. Last week, after 3+ months of ADF, it is now at 206.  A 49 point drop. That’s the good news. 

Never had a vitamin D test. Got a new doctor and she added it to my tests. It came in at 10. Insufficient is between 20 and 29. Optimal is 30 and above. I was put on weekly vitamin D3 capsules. For 12 weeks. 

How did this happen? Otherwise my levels improved, with a general trend towards the middle of the healthy range. The following circumstances may have contributed to this vitamin D deficiency. 

1.  Many years history of skin cancer requiring surgical removal, skin treatments, daily sunscreen, big hats, long sleeves, and avoiding the sun. A source of Vitamin D is sunlight on your skin. 

2.   Stopped drinking milk one the kids moved out. Milk is another source of vitamin D. 

3.  Stopped eating eggs, for the most part, after switching to 16-8, IF, in 2018. That was because I had always eaten eggs for breakfast for my whole life. Eggs are a good source of vitamin D. 

4.  3+ months ago, I switched from 16/8 to ADF.  In addition, I fasted with only coffee and water on the alternate fast days. Did this cause my vitamin D deficiency?  I think maybe contributed. 

So here are my changes:

1.   Started wearing short sleeves. 
2.  Now that grandchildren visit, we have milk, so I started drinking milk on my eating days. 
3. Now have 4 egg breakfast on eating days. 
4.  Now have 4 egg dinner on fasting days. 

     This is my update. I see my doctor in January and will have follow up blood tests in February.  I presented myself as an ADF patient to my doctor. Maybe that is why she tested for vitamin D. Don’t know.  But glad she did. I hope to test out normal in February. 

     One thing I do believe. That by seeing your doctor and presenting your ADF or any diet  to your doctor, might spark their interest.  As in my story, a doctor’s visit made me rethink and adjust.

1h1jb7v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h1jb7v,CTB26 Griffin Typical Work/Gym Day Use,"The recent posts in this group about people’s typical EG bag use inspired me to share my typical work day.

I go to the gym during lunch.  My CTB26 is my work bag to bring my office items - work laptop, sometimes my personal laptop, and other everyday work stuff (some of it in my CAP2).  On my workout days it also holds: 

- my change of clothes (packed into a small Peak Design packing cube)

- my wet/dirty clothes bag (the black bag stuffed out in pic 4) that I toss my clothes into after my workout

- my gym shoes packed in a Peak Design shoe pouch (to reduce the gym bag/feet smell)

- my squat knee sleeves (these stay in the car after my workout - I’m not putting these smelly items back in the bag)

- GoRuck Shadow Pocket 3L with my microplates and SBD Wrist-wraps

- post-workout cleaning items (body wipes, etc.) inside the mesh pocket

- protein shaker bottle in the exterior pocket

On my non-workout days my CTB26 is my sole carry item.  My coffee tumbler goes in the bottle pocket and my Yeti 36oz Rambler goes inside the pack.  On gym days those items, along with my CAP2, go into the Alpaka Bravo tote.

Gym day or not, the front QAP has my snacks and workout supplements.  Front admin has my Griffin CAP 1.  Top QAP has my keys and random stuff I need to quickly put away/access throughout the day.

I’ve also used this bag for travel, and will eventually use it for all-day family excursions when I’m hauling around the kids stuff.  It’s a versatile bag that covers a lot of my needs.",3,1732753500.0,EVERGOODS,0,0.8,False

It is insanely comfortable and was free. The issue is, I have no idea how to style it. It is also huge - AND we got the matching set of large oversized love seats that are living in another room while we decide wth to do with them (literally just one in this room is too big/eats up space).

We are both into more MCM/meets some boho/southwest vibes so this could land somewhere in there I think with the right rug and coffee table??

Her death brings up a lot of mixed feelings for me because of what’s happened with her, her brother, her kids (my cousins, Martín and Julia), my brother and myself.

Martín stole from me when I worked for the family business. He also treated my brother, Andrés, like shit when Andrés worked there, humiliating him over and over again. One example is he reduced my brother’s commission every time he exceeded sales targets, which is also a dumb move tbh.

Eventually, Andrés quit, taking his entire client list with him and started his own business. That hit the family business hard, and the fallout split the family in two—those who sided with Andrés and those who sided with my uncle, Roberto (my mom’s brother), and Martín. At this time Andrés had a son and none of the people mentioned here reached out. My nephew is seven years old and none of them have met him.

I stayed out of it until Franco, another cousin on my dad’s side who was also like a brother to me, was murdered. I flew back to Mexico for his funeral, and neither Martín, Julia, their mom or Roberto showed up or called. I decided to end my relationship with them. If they won’t show up when it matters especially given the way they behaved in a business setting, what is the point of having them in my life? I have tons of friends I can have coffee with when I go back home.

I wrote them letters explaining exactly why I was going no-contact. I told Martín he was a liar and a thief and called out how he’s been going around saying he paid for my dad’s funeral when it was Andrés and me who covered every expense. I told Julia that after 45 years of friendship, her silence when Franco died said everything I needed to know. And I told Roberto that he’s a piece of shit for exploiting my family and stealing part of my mom’s inheritance. I summarized each thing he’s done—stealing money, humiliating my mom, asking my brother if my dad’s cancer treatments were worth the cost. I told him I hope he dies like my dad did, in pain.

After that, my aunt called my mom to say she never wanted to see her again. I retaliated by calling her a cunt. A few hours later, I called her back to apologize for that, but I didn’t apologize for the letters, and I never contacted Martín or Julia again.

My aunt remained no-contact with my mom for two years but eventually reached out, and they reconciled. She never wanted to see me or Andrés again, though, and she refused to meet my nephew (Andrés’s son).

Now she’s dead. I feel a small pang of regret. My partner suggested sending a note of sympathy to my cousins as an olive branch. Another of my mom’s siblings suggested the same to my brother. When I looked back at my hate docket which is a list of grievances, and the letters I wrote, I got furious all over again. I called my brother for his perspective. He reminded me that they didn’t even bother to go to Franco’s funeral and that is when he himself decided they were no longer family to him either and there was no possible reconciliation.

So I know what i want to do and my brother and I are aligned in remaining no contact. But I’d like a reality check and some perspective.

But when I matched with *Jake*, something felt different. His profile was full of jokes, adventure pics, and an obscure playlist that immediately caught my attention. We chatted about everything from travel to food, but the real spark happened when we started talking about our favorite movies. It turns out we both have a weird obsession with 80s cult classics.

We decided to meet at a local coffee shop, and as soon as I saw him walk in, I knew this wasn’t going to be just another coffee date. He had this laid-back vibe and a smile that seemed to light up the whole place. What followed was a whirlwind of random topics, shared stories, and a bit too much coffee.

But then things took an unexpected turn. As we left the café, Jake suggested a spontaneous trip to the beach. In my head, I was thinking, Why not? and somehow, we ended up on a sunset walk along the shore, barefoot, laughing over nothing in particular. It felt like a scene straight out of a rom-com.

By the end of the evening, we were sitting on the sand, staring out at the ocean, and I realized something crazy. I wasn't just enjoying the date I was genuinely connecting with him. It was wild, unplanned, and completely unexpected, but I’d never felt so at ease with someone so quickly. The night ended with a promise to see each other again... and to my surprise, we actually did.

• I spend most of my early mornings drinking coffee outside to brace for my day. 

• My career is a pretty hectic one that takes a lot of critical thinking and understanding complex situations. 

• Because of my career, I’m a pretty simple man on my days off. I enjoy my own company, the ability to appreciate quiet and the outdoors. 

• Most days if I’m not at work, you can find me in the gym or close to a pond fishing. 

• I have some pretty hot takes, the first being that socks absolutely do not belong in bed. Argue your point with me if you will. 

• Craft beer is delicious and I try to find a cool little brewery in every small town I go in. 

• Because of my love for craft beer, see my previous statement about the gym. 

• My love language is 100% making fun of you. If you can’t take it or are gonna take it personal, I’m not the guy for you.

What do we do?","I've never made a proper reddit post before, I just casually listen in on different podcasts, so I apologize if the formats kind of off.

I'm gonna try and make it somewhat quick, and if anyone needs specifics I can clarify more in comments, but me and my family have been going insane trying to figure out this whole thing.

I (20m) was staying with my girlfriend at her parents for a couples weeks, when I get a phone call from my mom asking if I stopped by the house. I told her I wasn't, asked why and if something was going on. She told me someone greased the doorhinges. She noticed the dog would walk into rooms and the doors would shut behind him locking him inside, which was never an issue before, not only that but none of the doors squeaked now.

She said someone greased the doors, and at the time no one was home so she has no idea who. 

When I got back home, sure enough none of the doors were squeaky anymore and they were constantly closing on thier own. Besides one door.

My door.

When no one's home we cover my door with a dresser, its a raised one so the cat can leave in and out but the dog won't get in to eat the cats food. We do this all the time, it's part of the routine all of us do when no ones home.

Which means there was 100% no one home, and the person who greased the doorhinges either didn't know my door was even behind it, or didn't want to move it.


We checked the hinges themselves and they're covered in grease, besides mine of course and it makes the sound of mine painfully more obvious. My mom asked everyone, friends, grandparents, cousins, aunts, uncles. None of them did it, and none of them know who could of done it.

Or more importantly why? Why would someone grease our doors while we weren't home?

This has been kinda freaking us out for a bit, and the dresser things shows for sure no one was home, and it's likely someone who wouldn't know we did that.

Just yesterday another weird thing happened, which could be unrelated, but it's a second strange occurrence in the same time frame so we assume it's related.

While I was in the shower the dog was barking, loud. I assumed maybe someone was out walking thier dog, so I really didn't think much of it. A while later my brother came home and asked ""What's up with the basket?"" I told him I had no idea what he was talking about.

He walked out onto the porch and walked back in with a basket, it was full of chocolates, coffee, a blanket, and other things. We assumed it might very been a grandparent so we just set it down on the kitchen to show to mom. When she came home she asked who brought the basket, we told her probably a grandparent but we had no idea. 

So she messaged around asking family if they dropped it off so she could thank them, no one in the family did it. It all seems very similar to the doorhinge story.

My mom's been losing sleep over this since she's really freaked out, it freaked me out knowing someone came in while none of us were home. And it's freaked out the whole family cause no one can figure out who's been doing these things.

If anyone knows what could be going on please let me know, were not sure what to even do so any input would help. Maybe we're overreacting or looking too deep into nothing but it's getting really freaky.",10,1732752470.0,TwoHotTakes,28,1.0,False

Well in the first one a certain spark or something was missing that made me feel we weren’t compatible in the long run. Second one there was an amazing spark but certainly a toxic relationship. So toxic it made me aware of my flaws and insecurities. 

When I got out of it, I was joyful to have been alone again. And decided it was time to improve myself more than I have ever. But it did get lonely, and I was never good at attracting women. It’s a struggle I’ve had all my life. Grew up being called ugly on a consistent basis and well chronic loneliness never helped out my social skills and personality. 

But since last year I had discovered more and more of myself. I’ve lost weight, and have gone to the gym. While I can’t say I’m 100% satisfied yet with my body, I definitely look more toned. With the weight loss it made my face nicer I’d like to think. Try to take care of my skin more (had very bad acne and still deal with the scars but have lightened them up through a routine). And I’ve grown out my hair and get compliments on it. I can see why women identify with their hair so much, I feel so powerful with longer hair haha. 

On top of that I try to be more out and about then before. Always used to watch movie or play video games all day. Hobbies I still do but limit. I love going to the library and just reading a bunch of historical/philosophical books. Try my best to increase my knowledge. I’ve become a more open minded and less biased person. Through meditation and mindfulness I have let go of many negative thoughts and hateful feelings I used to have. Still struggle, but not as before. I’ve become a bit more understanding of people. I also got diagnosed with ADHD, and am now treating with Adderall. I’ve discovered coffee, and now enjoy a cup or 2 on weekends right before going to the library. I go to bars on weekends with a friend and shit the stick and enjoy a good night out. 

There’s so much more I can do however. New things to discover and such.

The issue is… I did all these things to become a more attractive person. My motivation was women. I knew it was wrong. But a reason was a reason. May have been wrong but it helped me. I am now loving the idea that I’m becoming a better person. 

And slowly but surely I have become more attractive. Can’t say I turn heads. But I’ve been hit on by both guys and girls at bars. 

The reason why it’s an issue now is this, I met a women. I’m 26M, she 32F. She’s beautiful. Our first date there was already good chemistry. She’s tall (I’m 6’4, a tall women is a godsend), has unique interests, is aggressive which I like because it counters my passive personality, we’re able to talk about thing extensively, I can share some of my hobbies with her such as film watching, when we touch it’s magic. 

She wants a relationship… and that’s what scares me…

If I get into this now… that motivation is gone, the oil or whatever of my journey is gone. My ambition of self improvement is gone. 

This clearly roots in an insecurity, a need for validation, because I have enjoyed being validated when people tell me they like me new hair or when they say I look good from the gym. I know it’s wrong but it’s what’s given me meaning this past year. 

I got to my destination in some way, but now… I’m thinking I want the journey more. It’s like I want to bullshit myself, to lie to myself. Manipulate myself. Force myself to be a journey and continue wanting instead of having…

It’s so messed up. And I don’t know how to feel or deal about it..",5,1732752063.0,self,1,1.0,False

Age: 24


Height & Build: 5'5"", relatively fit


Relationship Status: Single


Education & Profession:
I have a Bachelor’s in Software Engineering and currently work as a software engineer in Sydney, Australia.


A Little About Me:
I was born and raised in the UAE and I have spent much time in Pakistan tbh, originally from Punjab. These days, I’m living the Sydney life, balancing my tech career with my love for the outdoors(I know it's quite cliche 🤣). I’m a practicing Muslim who doesn’t smoke, drink, or do drugs. I’d call myself a coffee addict and an adventurous soul who enjoys camping, hiking, fishing, and long walks. I also love gaming when I’m not exploring the great outdoors. Romantic at heart, I value honesty, love, and strong family connections.


Family:
I come from a Punjabi family with two older brothers, one younger brother, and my amazing mom and dad. We’re big on supporting each other and value good vibes all around.


Where I Live:
I currently reside in Sydney and stay in an apartment


What I’m Looking For:
I’m looking for someone who is kind, beautiful in her own way, and amazing to be around. A partner who values family, has a positive outlook on life, and enjoys the little adventures. Bonus points if you love coffee and are up for camping or fishing trips!


Deal Breakers:
I don’t get along with overly emotional or cold personalities, and I’d prefer someone with no major family issues. Excessive male friendships or negativity in relationships are also not my vibe. I don't mind if you had past relationships as long as you have overcome it.


My Timeline:
I’m hoping to take the plunge in about 3 years. In the meantime, I’d love to get to know the right person and grow together.


Why You Should Say Yes:
If you’re someone who wants a romantic, caring, and supportive partner who can cook almost everything, I’m your guy. I’ll always prioritize our happiness, keep the spark alive, and make sure life feels like an adventure we’re on together.


Let’s connect if this sounds like the kind of journey you’re ready for!

In my first cup the initial flavor was good, but as it steeped/sat longer, the smoky flavor got too intense. I had to cut it with room temp water. 

I got Playadito, a brand I saw was good for noobs. I understand the leave are smoked - so there's no getting rid of the flavor, are there any brands with a mild smoke flavor or any tips to brewing that will make it more palatable for me?

Which is fair, but I said that I'd take it back to school before drinking it, that way the weather outside wouldn't make a difference.

They separated when I was 3 and since then I have always lived with my mom. I had a good relationship with my dad until I turned 14, when he started a family of his own and we rarely got to see each other. The frequent catching up became sporadic on both sides very quickly. 

The house where I live is my mom's house, but before the divorce it was the house where we lived as a family. My dad is really familiar with the house and the entirety of the apartment complex. One of the other person living in our complex is my dad's best friend, let's call him Paul. They know each for 30+ years and my dad always describe him as a ""family friend"". Both me and my mom never quite liked him. After my parents divorced, when my mom and I meet Paul in the communal spaces we do some polite small talks but nothing more since we simply don't enjoy his company but it has happened a couple of times that for complex related things he came up into our house uninvited. He is someone that doesn't understand boundaries and that makes us really uncomfortable. Last time, using a maintenance excuse, he stayed for two hours and a half, actively asking for coffee more than once and when he wanted something more to drink he just went straight to the fridge without asking. Trust me, I am a really welcoming person, but the way he acts and his soft entitlement really rubs me the wrong way.

Back to my dad. He just got a new job that makes him drive by my house, so it became a spontaneous habit for him to come by once every week. I was really excited at first but it became pretty apparent from the start that it was not going to be what I expected.

Three times out of the average four monthly visits he hangs out with Paul in my living room. Most of the time when I call to check when he will arrive, he is at Paul’s and they just come at my door and stay both for a couple of hours, take a coffee or two before vanishing. Last week when I asked my dad to come watch a movie it was no different. He called me, told me that he was at Paul's and simply added ""We're coming in a minute"". I just snapped. I told him that I wanted only him to come by and that I didn't want Paul in the house. He asked me why and I explained that I just didn't want Paul there. He exploded. He told me that I was extremely rude for not inviting him. He kept saying ""Since when Paul cannot come to OUR house?"". I just responded that technically that was not his house and that if he really wanted to spend some time with Paul they could have went elsewhere. He hung up on me and never showed up. I wasn't expecting that reaction from him and I felt extremely betrayed because I thought our hanging time was more important than Paul.

When later I told my mom what happened she said that I did the right thing and that my dad is known to be dismissive and extremely angry when he doesn't get what he wants.

I still feel bad. Maybe I could have overlooked Paul's presence but idk.

I’m also a huge fan of motorcycles and dream of touring Europe on two wheels someday. Traveling is my passion; every new destination feels like a new adventure. And honestly, getting lost is just part of my charm

We are affectionate when we smile at our partner, hug and kiss them. We are loving when we take care of them. We are loving when they hurt us. But true love is not in smiles but in tears. Many people can laugh with you, but fewer people can feel your pain and cry with you. To know if we truly love, ask yourself these questions Does my loved one's pain hurt me, do you cry, does watching him or her leave hurt me in any way, do you cry, do you cry?

How can I go about reporting them when they won’t tell me the company they work for?,"I’m in England

I work in a chain coffee shop and every day a vulnerable man comes in with his support workers. They look like a family, there’s three of them (looks like mother, father and son)

There’s many examples of them not doing their job and I am concerned for the man they are caring for, some things include:

- They don’t talk to him, continuously stand away from him and ignore him
- They make him sit alone on separate tables when he tries to sit with them
- They’ll disappear leaving the son with him and return with shopping bags clearly not meant for him (fashion brand carrier bags etc)
- There was an incident where the vulnerable man started shouting at a member of staff and they didn’t intervene
- His trousers will fall down leaving his buttocks completely exposed and they won’t tell him 
- They left him to stand and stare at us for 10 whole minutes while they were sat on their phones 

Today I asked for the company they work for with the false intention of looking for getting into care work. They seemed extremely hesitant and told me CYT. I later searched this and found it’s for 10-18 year olds, so they gave me a ‘decoy’ company because this man clearly looks around his 40s.

I genuinely believe these people are pretending to care for this person for income, and use the time outside to tend to their own person life duties at the same time. 

It’s hard to explain via message how they truly are not helping this man at all and it is miserable seeing him being completely ignored. This has been occurring for around a year now and I feel guilty for not doing anything. I’m genuinely concerned and would like to report them but I have no idea where to turn to. Any guidance would be appreciated.",10,1732750953.0,LegalAdviceUK,3,0.92,False
1h1idzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h1idzs/am_i_the_bad_guy_for_feeding_cat_food_to_my_lunch/,Am I the bad guy for feeding cat food to my lunch thief?,"This is my first time here.

Over a year ago, my aunt’s husband helped me get my current job. I’m not a fan of nepotism, but in my country, getting your first job is nearly impossible. You need experience, but without that first opportunity, how do you gain it? That’s why we have a high unemployment rate among young people. Often, you need someone with connections to help.

I did my internship like any final-year student. At first, I just made copies, took notes, brought coffee, ran errands, etc., until they moved me to a different department where my uncle-in-law had more influence. He started assigning me tasks related to my field, and eventually, I got hired permanently. Some people gave me attitude, while others ignored me.

Now, my uncle is out of the country. No, I’m not in his position. I report to someone else, but ever since he left, it seems like there’s a plan to make me quit. They take my parking spot, eat my lunch, exclude me from birthday cake celebrations, and plan loud social outings without inviting me. Not everyone is like this, but at least four out of a team of ten are, and the rest just stay indifferent.

I had a mini fridge under my desk one of those tiny ones my sister used for skincare products. My lunch stopped disappearing, but then they started complaining that it was leaking, which was untrue. Then they said my food had strong smells and made the area stink, and finally, they claimed the fridge was an unnecessary power expense for the office. My boss told me to get rid of it to avoid escalating the issue to HR. When I unplugged it, I overheard them joking outside that I didn’t have my “godfather” anymore, referring to my uncle.

I started leaving my lunch in the shared fridge again, and they resumed stealing it. I was furious. HR only told me to label my food, so I did. The thief responded by taking my food out and leaving the labeled bag in the fridge.

I spent days thinking of a way to teach them a lesson. I considered adding laxatives to my food, but after researching online, I saw a video where someone did that, and the thief ended up in the hospital and sued the person who did it. That discouraged me.

While reading the comments on that video, someone suggested using cat food. I bought a can, but the smell was overpowering. My girlfriend suggested seasoning it to mask the smell, and it worked like a charm. I added garlic, oregano, and fried onions—it smelled amazing. The first day I left the food, someone took it. I waited all afternoon for a reaction, but nothing happened. This went on for several days, and I got so good at preparing it that even I found it tempting.

Then I thought, “This doesn’t make sense. I’m still feeding the thief. Why would anyone believe someone would keep leaving great lunches without ever noticing or complaining?” I decided the thief needed to know what they were eating, but I didn’t know who it was yet.

I planned to leave a can of cat food inside the lunch. This time, I didn’t cook or season it; I just poured it in. I also hid a baseball bat under my desk, just in case. I wasn’t sure who the thief was, and there were two muscular guys on the team I’m not exactly strong.

Not long after lunch, the thief came storming over. I was stunned it was the last person I expected. This guy had always told me, “Don’t worry, they’re just jealous of you because of your uncle.” Sometimes, he even chatted with me. He yelled that he would kill me for feeding him dog food. I told him it wasn’t dog food; it was cat food.

He tried to come at me, but someone intervened. In HR, he claimed I had never complained and that I had given him permission he came up with a string of excuses. I explained that my food had been disappearing, and I had switched to a more “organic” diet. HR told him not to eat anything of mine again and sent us back to work.

The next day, he served me with a police summons for “damaging his dignity and personal rights.” HR called me in alone and told me to resolve the issue quietly because what I did was serious.

I gathered all the receipts for the cat food I bought, along with the seasonings and the time I spent preparing it, and handed the bald an invoice. I told him we could settle if he reimbursed me for all the meals he’d stolen.

He lost it, and my boss happened to see the invoice. My boss started laughing and told him the deal was fair. However, some colleagues said dignity isn’t something to be played with.",26,1732750836.0,AITAH,19,1.0,False

However I do have a part time job which I am grateful for, over the past 4 months I have been living in a tent, riding my bike to and from work because I am fortunate. Mostly receive free coffee from a gas station from a individual who I went to jail with. Occasional going to Dunkin donuts to warm up, with enough money to buy a donut. I have enough money, not alot, but enough to make ends meet. Currently I am at motel 6 after all the money I saved, because of the holiday, nothing was going to be open, especially market basket cafe which I frequent. The employee's of this establishment are absolutely terrific! Even those that frown at me. But now I am sitting on a big bed which I haven't had the pleasure to sit let alone lay in. I have a EBT card as well for food, which brought me food for the holiday. I plan being here because of the weather, only for that reason. I wanted to let you all know this because life isn't bad, events are taken advantage of, people are taken advantage of. My life isn't taken advantage of, it was placed in this moment for me to tell you, if life is serving you something you didn't want. Just know things change even if it's temporary. Be grateful. I know I am glowing being in this warm room. Hot water to shower, after weeks of not showing. A TV I can watch, even though I am typing this to tell you. Even the Internet I am using from this bed. Please be kind to each other, even though it can be unbearable because of what life serves you. That is the battle we all face, let's do this with a smile, as I am smiling now. Thank you all",25,1732750539.0,gratitude,18,1.0,False

1h1i8pl,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypastachannel/comments/1h1i8pl/barstool_bargain/,Barstool Bargain,"The rain was relentless, hammering down on the pavement like a symphony of despair. I sat slumped in the corner of O’Malley’s, a dingy little bar that smelled of stale beer and lost hope. My suit was wrinkled, my tie loose, and my shirt stained with coffee from a clumsy spill that morning, though I wasn’t sure it mattered anymore. It had been the worst day of my life, the kind that left a permanent scar on your soul.

The call had come at 9:00 a.m., just as I was settling into my desk. I knew it was bad news before I picked up the receiver; the HR manager’s voice was too soft, too rehearsed. Budget cuts, they said. Nothing personal, they said. “We appreciate your contributions.” But no amount of corporate jargon could mask the fact that I was being tossed out like yesterday’s garbage.

By noon, the contents of my desk were packed into a cardboard box, and I was out on the street, jobless for the first time in fifteen years. It was raining then, too, a cruel metaphor, as if the universe had decided to mock me. I thought about calling Rachel, my wife, but decided against it. She’d been distant lately, her patience frayed by my long hours and dwindling paychecks.

I didn’t have to call her. She called me.

“I can’t do this anymore, Eric,” she said, her voice trembling but firm.

I knew what was coming. We’d been circling this drain for months.

“I’ve filed for divorce,” she continued. “I’ll send over the paperwork. I’m sorry.”

That was it. No tears, no drawn-out explanations. Just a clean, efficient severing of the life we’d built together. I sat in my car for an hour after the call, staring at the steering wheel, feeling the weight of everything crushing me.

So here I was, drowning my sorrows in whiskey at O’Malley’s, the only place in town where no one cared if you fell apart. The bartender, a grizzled man named Frank, slid me another glass without a word. The amber liquid burned as it went down, but the pain was a welcome distraction.

“Rough day?” a voice came from the seat beside me.

I hadn’t even noticed anyone sit down. Turning my head, I saw a man who didn’t quite fit the bar’s atmosphere. He was impeccably dressed in a charcoal-gray suit that looked like it cost more than my car. His hair was slicked back, and his dark eyes sparkled with an unsettling mix of amusement and curiosity.

“You could say that,” I muttered before taking another swig, not in the mood for small talk.

He smiled, revealing perfect white teeth. “I’d say it’s more than rough” he leaned in closer. “You’ve hit rock bottom, haven’t you?”

I stiffened, the words cutting deeper than they should have. “What’s it to you?”

He chuckled in a low, rich sound. “Let’s just say I have a talent for recognizing desperation. And you, my friend, are radiating it.”

I turned away, but he wasn’t deterred.

“Lost your job today,” he said, as if it were a casual observation. “And your wife, too. Oo now that’s quite the double blow,” he chuckled again. 

My blood ran cold. “How the hell do you know that?”

He didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he signaled to Frank for two drinks, one for himself and another for me. When the glasses arrived, he raised his in a toast.

“To new beginnings,” he said, his voice smooth as silk.

I didn’t move. “Who are you?”

He leaned in closer, his grin widening. “Let’s just say I’m someone who can help.”

“Help?” I scoffed. “Unless you’ve got a job and a time machine in that fancy suit of yours, I don’t see how.”

The stranger’s eyes gleamed. “Oh, I can do much better than that. I can give you everything you’ve ever wanted—money, power, love. A fresh start. All I ask in return is something you won’t even miss.”

I laughed bitterly. “Let me guess: my soul?” I took another drink. 

He tilted his head, feigning surprise. “Ah, you’ve heard this pitch before. But tell me, Eric, what’s your soul really worth? You’re miserable, broken. What if I told you that all of this,” he raised his hands and gestured all around him, “your failures, your pain, your loss, could all disappear with a single… stroke?”

I stared at him, half-convinced I was hallucinating. The whiskey had dulled my senses, but there was something unnervingly real about him.

“You’re serious?” I asked finally.

“Deadly.” He said without blinking as he pushed a sleek black pen and a folded piece of parchment toward me. The paper looked ancient, the writing on it ornate and otherworldly.

“All you have to do,” he said, “is sign.” There was excitement and anticipation in his voice. 

I hesitated, my hand hovering over the pen. My rational mind screamed at me to walk away, to laugh this off as some elaborate prank. But the darkness inside me whispered something else. “Do it,” I heard in my head. It sounded like the stranger’s voice, but how could it have been? His lips hadn’t moved. It was a thought I had in my head, wasn’t it?

“What’s the catch?” I asked.

“There’s always a catch,” he admitted matter of factly. “But wouldn’t you rather live your life like a king, even for a short while, than waste away in obscurity?”

I looked around the bar, at the peeling wallpaper and the flickering neon sign. This wasn’t just rock bottom. It was the grave I’d been digging for myself for years.

The stranger leaned in again, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “Picture this: tomorrow morning, you wake up in a penthouse. There’s a seven-figure balance in your bank account. Then the phone rings. It’s your dream job, begging you to join their team. Rachel? She’s begging to come back, but fuck her! You’re too busy deciding which of your many admirers is worth your time. This isn’t a fantasy, Eric. This is real. I can make it happen.”

My throat tightened. It did sound like the perfect life. The life I had dreamed. The life I deserved! Hadn’t I earned it? Worked my ass off only to get let go, tried to save a failing marriage. I poured my heart and soul into everything! And what did as I get as a thank you. I got jack-shit! 

As I reached for the pen, something inside me, something buried deep, made me stop. My mother’s voice, soft and full of faith, echoed in my mind: “When you’re lost, Eric, pray. God listens, even when you feel like no one else does.”

I dropped my head into my hands, closed my eyes, and began to pray. My words were clumsy, desperate, and tear soaked. It was a plea for strength, for guidance, for a sign that I wasn’t alone in this darkness.

The stranger’s smile vanished, replaced by a sharp glare.

“Praying? To Him?”  he sneered, his voice cold and dripping with contempt. “Eric don’t waste your time. Do you really think He’s going to swoop in and save you now? After all you’ve been through? Where was He when you lost your job? When your wife walked away? When you cried yourself to sleep, begging for just one break? He’s not listening. He never was.”

I tightened my eyes shut, ignoring the mocking venom in his tone. I whispered another prayer, more insistent this time.

The stranger’s calm began to crack. His voice turned sharp, filled with agitation. “Stop it,” he demanded, leaning in so close I could feel the unnatural chill radiating from him. “You think muttering those words will change anything? You think He cares about you? Look at your life, Eric! He’s the reason you’re here. He let you fail. He let you fall.”

I gripped the edge of the bar, my knuckles white as I continued to pray.

“Enough!” the stranger barked, slamming his hand on the bar. The glasses rattled, the sound piercing the heavy air. His composed demeanor slipped further, his face contorting into something darker, more feral. “Do you hear me, Eric? He. Does. Not. Care!” His voice grew louder with each word, almost a roar. “Why waste your breath on a God who abandoned you when you needed Him most?”

I opened my eyes just enough to glance at him, his face twisted with frustration. I closed them again and started to pray again. 

“Eric you’re throwing away the only real chance you’ve got!” His voice was no longer smooth and enticing; it was raw, jagged, desperate. “Look at me, Eric. I’m here. I’m offering you something tangible. A way out of this misery. God isn’t coming to save you! He doesn’t care if you rot in this bar or die in the gutter.”

I ignored him as my prayers grew louder, the words clumsy but filled with growing conviction.

The stranger snarled, his voice dropping into something inhuman. “Stop it! You think He’s going to help you? You’re nothing to Him! You’re a  speck. A failure. A man who couldn’t even keep his life together. And yet here I am, offering you salvation, and you’d rather grovel to a deity who asks for your unwavering faith and devotion but offers nothing in return?!”

I opened my eyes as he stood, towering over me as the stool was thrown to the ground. The shadows around him deepening, his eyes glowing faintly with a sinister light. “You’re wasting precious time,” he hissed, jabbing a finger at the contract on the bar. “Sign the fucking paper, Eric! Let go of this foolish hope. It’s pathetic. You think you’re strong enough to get through this without me? You’re not. You’re nothing without me.”

I raised my head, meeting his gaze. There was a calmness in me now, something steady and resolute that hadn’t been there before. Then, I felt something. It felt like a hand. A fatherly hand on my shoulder from somewhere behind me. It was firm, but most importantly, comforting. 

“If I’m nothing,” I said quietly, “then why are you so desperate?”

The stranger flinched as though struck, his eyes widening in shock. For a moment, the mask he wore slipped completely, revealing something monstrous beneath the surface. His perfectly polished exterior flickered like a bad signal, the illusion cracking and warping. “You don’t understand,” he hissed, his voice a guttural growl. “You’re throwing away everything! He doesn’t deserve your prayers. I’m the one who’s here. I’m the one offering you a way out.”

I stood, pushing the pen and parchment back toward him. “No,” I said firmly. “You’re offering chains.”

The stranger’s composure shattered. He bared his teeth, now sharp and gleaming like blades. The air around him seemed to vibrate with an unnatural energy, the shadows swirling like a living thing. “You’ll regret this,” he snarled, his voice distorted, almost unrecognizable. “You’ll come crawling back to me when you realize He’s not coming for you. And when you do, the price will be so much, much worse.”

I held my ground, meeting his gaze. “I’d rather take my chances with Him than spend a second chained to you.”

His fury exploded, a guttural roar filling the bar as the lights flickered and the shadows closed in. Then, as quickly as it began, the storm of his anger subsided. He straightened his suit, the edges of his form flickering one last time before solidifying.

“This isn’t over, Eric,” he growled, his voice low and venomous. And then, with a sharp snap, he vanished, leaving behind the pen and parchment.

The storm outside had stopped. I looked down at the bar, at the empty glass in front of me, and for the first time all day, I felt something stir inside me…hope.",1,1732750411.0,creepypastachannel,0,1.0,False

**My partner (M30) and I (32F) met in the very beginning of 2023.**  
Our relationship is the best I ever had, whereas we talk through any problems/differences/challenges we might have, talk about most things before they even could become a problem. Where we both work on our personal flaws and challenges (Were both somewhat neurospicy) to become better and make the relationship grow together rather than grow apart. We share belifes and goals, and things go smoothly as we keep briefings between us and keep up the honest communication even when its naturally a bit uncomfortable.

# The problem is his friendgroup.

I got the chance to meet his friends earlier than I would have prefered, but he really wanted to be able to bring me places as if i was a natural part of his life already. I approved of meeting the friends, but told him I only wanted to meet his parents when he was as sure about the long term future of the relationship as much as one realistically can be. He understood and supported this.

In the beginning I noticed that he spent some weekends or nights with his friend group of three. Two dudes being in a relationship with one another, and a female friend. She had dominant brash tendencies like myself in some ways, and we went along pretty nicely thanks to that. She seemed to care alot more about looks and fashion than me, but in the beginning i did not see that as noteworthy on any deeper level. They all four used to go to bars and drink together, and during those nights he would still call me and text me just as when being home alone.

The first bad feeling came when I realised he sometimes would spend an afternoon with the female friend whose not in a relationship. Im not usually jealous or posessive, but this time it triggered me even though i tried to remain pragmatical and logical. I did not at first ask him about this, since they all had been friends since way back in school. Shes a friend and I had no reason to question this yet.

**I get a chance to meet 2 people out of this friend group soon after this,**   
And I am really nervous about what this friend group will think of me. I boost my ""socializing focus"" even though im a self reliant introvert, and manage to actually build a good reportoire with the two. One of them being this female. If i focus on our similarities, we could even be really good friends together, so adapt this friendly attitude towards her slowly building trust. Something in the way she speaks to my partner during this evening, makes this a bit hard still.

I cant be sure if its enough to be upset about yet. Its nothing ""out in the open"" and ""physically pointable at"" yet, there is nothing substantial. Just vague intuitive (or paranoid) hints making me wonder several times if they have ""had something together"" previously. The vibe comes from her, I do not sense anything weird or extra from my partner towards her.   
I bring it up with him, ask him if there has been something between them. Partly because i feel odd around her, partly because i already sensed there was some kind of trauma within him when it comes to love. Despite him openly confessing to not having had any relationships or girlfriends before.

The male friend is the best ever. Just like me very socially restricted but very polite and intellectual. He has depth, maturity, and observes alot. It is also this friend that my partner feels the closest to when I watch them interact. I have not met the intellectual male friends partner yet.

One thing stood out during the first meeting. They bring up the topic of a lost friend in the friend group, a female that moved away and started a family with someone. Since i am not used to this kind of people, i state what i would believe most would; That its a shame and sad to hear, but also that its normal when someone wants to realise themselves and create a life as time goes. The male friend seems to contemplate silently, but does not seem disturbed. The female friend on the other hand looks like its her funeral on a platter.

**Some time later my partner tells me this female friend is the one planning their group vacation,**   
To celebrate having known eachother for 10 years, and that she would visit him later that week to plan and book the last parts. I told myself that this is normal and valid as close friends, nothing illegitimate about her being the organiser. They spoke about this even when i met them in person earlier, and as such it seemed to be nothing big.

One afternoon they want to bring me and my partner to take a quick stroll in town so that i get to meet the intellectual male friends partner. Nothing noteworthy there, we meet up and this male partner seems amazing. Kind, considerate, a bit flimsy and go happy go lucky. Real easy to talk to. 

Then it all goes pretty fast. We celebrate the intellectual male friend and my partner shared birthday anniversary in the female friends parents apartment (this will become a theme, where we spend time at either her parents city apartment or her parents lakeside cottage, mainly because ""us others"" dont live in small apartments only). 

**The birthday party at the female friends parents apartment**   
Is really awkward now that i look back on it. We arrive and i get the biggest happiest hug from the female friend, she is sounding like im her new bestie and im not used to this kind of ""sharing the love"" vibe, but i try my best to reciprocate everything back. We were gathered all five of us in a nice modern kitchen, when i start to wonder if i really was invited though. I get seated in the corner of the kitchen table, while the four friends are making food and drinks for the day. For some reason i get this cold sensation and i start to wonder if i really had been invited to this at all, since its like i dont exist in the room for quite some time. Besides the kisses and my partner talking to me, im a ghost to the others. The newly aquainted soft male friend breaks off from the group when he can, and seats himself next to me. He whispers to me that he knows what its like to be new in a premade group, and that i can count on him now on. It seemed considerate and sympathetic of him, and we bonded over spirituality together during that time. My boyfriend loved how we got along, and i felt happy. The female friend even bonded with me at their balcony over american cars and different life experiences.

**Time passes again, and its time for the planning meetup with the female friend. Its valentines day.**  
Im not in their town that day, so my partner calls me to let me know he will meet this female friend for planning later in the evening. Alone. This made me feel odd about it, but the other friends had planned a trip the day after and was going to do the planning for their part some hours earlier. (They would later talk about this being a fact, aswell). My boyfriend would still be at work by then, so it had to be done in the evening. 

A couple hours later i receive a picture from my partner.   
Its the local pub table, with roses in a vase and lit candles on the table, and the female friends hands holding her cellphone in front of him. The odd feeling i had grew bigger. He calls me the second theyre done, and i then bring up how i feel. He admits that it seemed weird that they had this planning meetup at valentines day out of all days, and apologized for how it made things look. But he insured me that this was his friend from school once upon a time and that he saw her as a sister/friend, that thinking about her in any intimate way felt inc3stuous and disgusting to him naturally. That Valentines day was not something he as a single foverer person even had thought about, and that he rather would have spent it with me if we could have (living in different towns). I heard him, but questioned this all alot and could not fully release the feeling of this all being off.

The friends often sends their regards or asks about me, and i see this as a good sign. As in me being included. As in them checking in on their male friend and his new relationship. 

**Its not long until the friends invite us to hang at the female friends parents apartment again.**  
We get there, they wear party attire, theres going to be music and drinks. I brought my own liquor and wore some of my nicest things. It was a really great night together, but it also reminded me of what it was i had broken off from in my own past: Alcohol, partying, drunk people, embarrassing emotional talks the same people would not have being sober, shallow conversations about unemotional and stale things.  
They seemed to bond over competitive games, trivia contests and music. None of the things i connect by, and this was not what my partner and i connected over either. I tried my best anyhow, sang along and chatted with these friends. And discovered that me talking about emotions and asking actual questions about actual things, disturbed the flow of the group. So i had to tone that down a bit, perhaps they thought i didnt know them enough yet. My boyfriend on the other hand seemed to appreciate that he felt he got to know his friends better, so i tried to not feel discouraged. We leave a bit early. So does the other male couple. The female friend still hugs me like im her bestie...

The soft kind male friend and i deepen our connection. We chat about his work situation, neurodivergency, and how to handle certain points in life. I somehow manage to open his eyes to leaving his toxic work environment and being studying something hes passionate about. I did not expect him to listen, but he did. His way of looking at me like i was an angel after that felt positive.

**One day my partner calls me up and tells me this female friend wants to come over by his place.**   
He tells me this to make sure this is okay with me since were a serious couple by now, and i ask alot of questions. Why she meets him alone this time. Where the other friends are at. What he has been taught about female friends within serious relationships as a guy. We have a long solid chat and it seems like hes got a good outlook on things, feels honest.

When he later tells me about this visit, he mentions that she had asked him ""what he saw in me"". About ""what he liked so much about me"". Bringing it up because he wants to tell me what his reply was, and how hes been thinking about me all the time. He interpreted the female friends questions as her caring for him and making sure everything was okay, and as our relationship went by i have come to learn that he has not been taught anything about relationships at all. I have taught him about romance politics all along. He gets upsed when he understands afterwards, but then it is already too late. I know a male assh0le when I see one, and this is not .. that. It would have been easier if it was.

**Eurovision song conest finals rolls in,**   
And were supposed to be at the male couple friends place for the first time. We bring something nice to drink and share with the others, and head out. During the stay I really get a chance to shine since the male friends actually share a big interests with me: computers and gaming. Then, during one of the more spiritual witchy themed songs, the female friend interrupts all interactions to turn to me and point out that the symbol on the screen is nice. Its a pentagram, a wiccan symbol. I stalwart point out that yes it is indeed nice. (I have no desire to talk about my spirituality with people i barely know yet). She stares me down even further and again asks about the symbol on the screen. ""Do you know what it means??"" And there is this heavy atmosphere around it i cannot pinpoint. I tell her that i do know, as softly as i can. The male friends bring some other topic up quickly. All of a sudden the female friend needs to leave. I state to myself that i dont trust her at all. Her questions had not been curious, but rather accusing to the tone and i did not feel well about it physically. My stomach hurt.

**Midsummers up**,   
And were out to the female friends parents freetime cottage house.  
We all go together and its a happy carride singing songs on the radio together. We all seem like best friends and the photos taken shows a shiningly happy group that has found its rhythm. The female friend seems to have let go of the wicca pentagram television thing and were back to ""oh its my best friend! Hugs honey"" time.  
We all had the task of coming up with a contest each for this afternoon together where we would compete against one another, and my contest was a success on all levels. I felt so proud of myself. Everyone seemed to appreciate me and i felt happy. 

The female friend did not feel happy. As we after the contest all split up for different responsibillities like cutting meat and vegetables for the dinner, fetching toilet paper for the outhouse, etcetera, she got upset. To me this was natural: We had a shitton to get done, and everyone had something to contribute with. Time was short and lighthours are limited. But apparently, from the kind and soft male friend, we afterwards got to hear that the female friend had been really upset and angry about our behaviour. Not keeping her company or appreciating her lighting the bbq fire for us all. She had felt alone and left out. I still didnt get the issue, she obviously had the male friend listening to her, and it wasnt like we were twiddling our thumbs or hanging out without her. I figured she might have been hangry at the very best... 

That settled down and the atmosphere became so good after having eaten, that me and my partner felt comfortable telling the friend group about our BDSM relationship. The reason being because a friend brought a question up about the quality ropes i had brought for the contest. Reactions were positive and engagement was high, my boyfriend seemed to be relieved like never before. ""Now we dont have to behave like something we aint, around our own friends"". I nodded in happy agreement.   
The female friend on the other hand, did not have a happy agreement, but rather seemed to mope in the corner of the sofa, and i could not understand why this was such a problem to her even though i tried.

The car ride home the day after was stiff and akward. I did not understand what was wrong, but my partner said that he did not really notice it, so i let it go.

**A coffee meetup is organised**   
where were supposed to talk about the female friends upcoming summer vacation and her needing someone to watch the cats in her apartment where she is currently renovating. Also they are meant to finalize the plans for their 10 year anniversary trip that is upcoming; what they can and can not bring on the plane etcetera.   
We show up togheter since anything else would be unthinkable in my partners eyes, but i already feel like i should not have been there. None of the friends talk to me, i dont exist all of a sudden. 

When the female friend brings up the cats needing some attention during her away, i try warming things up by telling her that i would love to help aswell. The ""dear bestie hugs forever honey"" attitude is nowhere to be seen, im met with that ugly face bullies used to make in highscool. Im really surprised, and so is my partner since he has already told her that me and him wants to help her with that. We both have vacation that time. Regardless she decides that we will have shared weeks between our couple and the male couple in the group....

**My birthday comes up,** and by this time i do not feel like i have that kind of a relationship to neither his parents (which i have met a couple of times now) or his friends to invite them to any party. I am still not done with unpacking things and im starting to feel the toll of an employment i never should have gotten myself into to begin with. I do not invite anyone, and as such no one needs to buy my any gifts either. No invitation means no obligation or expectation and i dont really feel like they care about me at all. So, i think to myself that i will invite them next year if things have gotten better. I still do not know if their weirness is because of me being new in their group context. Its my first birthday celebrated truly for my own sake, ever in my life, and i dont need new toxic people acting weird around it. I want calm. Perhaps this was stupid.

# The summer rolls in and the female friend goes on a vacation trip over the summer/fall. 

During that time i develop the relationship to my partner and his two male friends which I really get along with. We all develop a solid constellation, its effortless and natural and we talk about actual things together over lunches and journeys to the beach. We deepen the connections, so much so that hey helped me to finally move to the same town as them. (I had gotten my employment there about the same time and date i met my partner, it all just coincided instantaneously). 

Me and my partner decided to remove some of our social media accounts and rinsed our accounts of innapropriate content etcetera since we both were serious about the relationship. This meant things like pornsites, snapchat, and similar notorious places/apps. Including old dating profiles aswell. I was waiting for comments or sly replies from his friends about where it all had gone, but none came. 

**Some months later we decide that the best timing if we wanted to move in with one another, would be now.** Since i would be super busy for months upon months in a short while and there then would be no doing that. It was also pointless to pay two rents when we already spent all our free social time together. (we had been together for almost nine months meeting intensely often, it felt and still feels right.)

**We really wanted his move to my city center apartment to be a surprise,**  
So we did not tell the friends and planned on inviting them over for pizza when done as a fun thing. This failed as we had 3 stairs from the 1700's to climb with all our stuff, and i had barely gotten done with my unpacking yet. The two male friends came and helped us out and was impressed by our resiliance and cooperation together as a couple, which made me smile. 

Me and my partner had gotten used to our peaceful life where we go about our life in our own pace. Life has never been this harmonious ever. His hobbies work with my hobbies, his proffession and worktime schedule works with mine, his diet and mine works fine together, it all just falls into place. Living together has been like finding the truth of life, kindof.

**His male friends are great, we celebrate their birthday together.** We bring a birthday cake i baked for them and find a gift that they are amazed at where we even found. Splendid, greatness. Im super happy. We have the greatest evening together, but for some reason the friends ask me to take the cake with me home. I ask if we could just repackade the cake slices, but they incist that i should take it home. I ask my partner if there was something wrong with my otherwise famously good cake, and he replies that it was the best ever. I feel rejected, but tell myself its not really that bad. They probably didnt have space for it. 

**The period of caretaking the cats roll in.** Me an my partner arrives and takes care of everything surrounding the cats, and are a bit sentimental about having one ourselves. We quickly remember why both of us dont. Still its a loving good time, we buy toys and wet food, lactose free milk and make sure they have a clean floor where the litterbox is. We do an exceptional job, and for some reason i sensed that that in itself was not good either. She sent thank you messages to my partner for each picture and phrase he sent her about it to comfort her about missing her cats at home, but i received none and never got a real thank you for it even when i was included in the pictures with said cats or litterbox. Later, my boyfriend didnt get appreciation for it eather, only the kind and soft male friend... The rest of us are disclosed from it as it seems.

**I get a question** from the soft male friend shortly before their shared anniversary friendship trip, if i dont want to come along with them. Why i am not going aswell. I partway know the answer already: I am not into alcohol, jumping in and out of weird places, around shady people alongside freshly aquainted friends. But the biggest and actual reason is that i would find it rude for me to go on a 10 year anniversary for something i just stumbled into. I reply that the celebration is for them and their friendship and that i want to honour that fact. I could tag along next time. This seems to put the soft male friend off bigtime, and i dont understand why.

# Then the female friend came home from her vacation with her parents.

This is when things started getting weird for real, after having stabilized and been normal quite a while. I did thusly not expect there to be chaos again once the female friend came home, i believed our friendship with the male friends would sort that issue out since they could vye for the fact of me not being some sort of intruder at all. That they had gotten to know me and so forth. This did not happen like that.

... 

All of a sudden the kind and soft male friend stops showing up to hang with me and my partner. We go shopping with the intellectual male friend in the closest shopping area together two or three times, and the other male friend has a headache each time. So out of kindness i buy my favorite valerian sleep and calmness tea for him since i know it will work wonders, and send it home with his partner. I recieve a deep heartfelt thanks from the partner, but not the male friend with the headache at home. In fact, he stops responding thoroughly to my messages online even. I keep on going like my natural self and try thinking he has much on his plate in life. 

**Birthday present.**  
It goes so far as to where the day we need to buy the birthday present for the female friend already has arrived. Its us three that go buy it, since the kind soft male friend still has his headache. He was the one placing the most importance on what we would choose for her, but now he is not even with us. I did not judge back then, he was clearly not feeling well. At the store what we came for was no longer available and my 2 dudes standing there perplexed, lead me to decide that the professional staff got to arrange a similar gift set within the same price limit but with adaptations to this female friends personality traits. I thought it was the most beautiful thing to do for her, little did i know...

From that point we hear even less from the two male friends for some reason, and we barely notice since i have a hard time at work and life is hectic. 

**Then we get to the female friends big birthday party**, at the parents cottage. Its the second time there by then. This time we travel there with just the intellectual male friend in his car, the soft male friend still has a headhache. I am the one carrying the giftbag that im so proud of. An absent friend calls my partner and asks if we can stop and buy a card for her bestie since she cannot participate. We get a card on the way, i chose a glittery cat one and write calligraphy on the inside to my best abillity. My partner loves it, the bestie loves it...

But the female friend does not. She meets us as we arrive, and its a stale hello. Her entire family with relatives are there and i do not feel like i should be there. But i was invited. The friend also looks at me like i should not be there, but she invited me herself?! My partner hands over the giftbag, and she just pokes around inside it with this slanted stiff mouthshape. I try to clarify to make her happier, and remark that its a personally adapted and hand picked set from the brand itself we ordered for her. She shrugs it off completely. She finds the card and looks disinterested and unimpressed, until my boyfriend tells her its from her best friend that cannot come tonight. He does not tell her that i wrote it. She smiles... And i am dying inside, wanting to claw her eyes out. But i dont. The cold inside turns on. I get calculated. 

She during the evening sits across the table from me and my partner, we sit next to eachother close knitted as always holding hands. My married parents of 35 years still do that, and i refuse to not do it in my relationships aswell. If they could, without being childish, then we can. This upsets this female friend, each time he speaks to me or touches me, she looks like i have stolen something from her. 

The evening has the same theme of her moping in silence about our relationship. We cant go home, we have to stay for a while. We bbq, eat and drink well, her parents talk to me about how glad they are that the female friend has me as a friend to talk to about important things, and i guess i dont look that convinced anymore. I listen, i say the well raised things, but its bare minimum and stiff as concrete. We partake in trivia contests as always, and her parents make remarks about me never knowing anything. I want to yell at them for being so rude, but i dont. I tell myself its the last time im coming here anyhow. I will not cause a scene now. 

The female friend seats herself next to my partner the second we are not glued together. She tries to imply to my boyfriend that they need to go to the gym together now on because she thinks its a good idea and shes so lonely working out by herself. He tells her hes really not interested in that. She rages inside but tries to look contained. I notice the black eyes though.   
She then after her failed attempt seats herself next to me, telling me she loves me as a friend, asking me about relationship advice, shes in something with a dude that has kids and is older than her. I try to act like the adult person, i give her the advide she needs, but its not with warmth or engagement. Its a duty by not, not something i do out of warmth. 

She then starts reaching out her hand towards me each time she sees me. She used to do this as a high five between female friends, but when i reach out to do it this evening, she laughs at me and tells me thats not what she wanted. Each time it was my vape she wanted. Thats when the flashback hit me and i remembered that shes always been negligent about my boundaries with my vape. I have offered it to her when things have been good, but i never told her it was hers or that it was free use for all, or that i would give it to someone trying to go to the gym alone with my partner... She makes it really clear to me that she only reaches out to me or talks to me the rest of that evening, because of my vape. ""Oh i dont want that from you, i just want your smoke thing!"". Thats when i told my partner i wanted to go home. 

She runs up to us as we try to leave, and tries to convince my partner to receive beer cans from her ""for the ride home"", but hes not doing nicotine at all anymore, and not drinking excessively any longer. Havent been since we met. He denies, and she looks like she could kill us both right then and there. She wanted us to stay the night, and my partner strictly denied.

# Anniversary trip 

Time for the friendship celebration trip, and i am happy by now that im not tagging along. Im so upset about this female friend that i dont know if i ever want to see this friend group again or not. At the same time, i have just days before the trip gotten to know that my job can no longer keep me employed. I am unemployed out of thin air having been promised years of work at this place. My life feels shattered since this was why i moved here, it is what keeps me self sufficient and it was my sense of retribution from an unfair life in a small town. I am glad that i dont have to be on a trip pretending to be happy when im falling apart completely.

I wont let my partner stay at home with me, he has deserved and longed for this for ages now. I know his friends also will blame everything on me, for him not going and having fun, if that would have been the case.

While they are out of the country partying and adventuring together, I am at home reviewing the pattern of these relationships. Everyones behaviour. My own attempts at making things work. How its been completely not appreciated and completely invain, because here we are. Wondering why everyone acts so weird. All of a sudden this male friend doesnt have a headache. Hes on the trip. Im at home crying, no one asks if im okay. No one has said any condolences. I dont exist. I excuse it with the fact that im not even there, but if i would have been there and someone was missing, i would have texted or called. Sent a postcard, something.

My partner gets home from the vacation.  
What he expresses when he gets home is that he does not want to go on any more vacations for now. He wants a home vacation next summer, a car trip out in nature in peace and calm. I try asking him what happened during the trip, and he explains this teenage chaos that i cant relate to at all. The female friend had been out alone chasing men, and hopping between clubs while the dudes all tried sleeping in their rented apartment with little luck. 

He came home tired and unhumored. Told me about conversations they had when the kind soft male friend had ""headaches"" again. The female friend had apparenty interrogated the intellectual friend and my partner about love and whether they loved their partners (me and the soft guy). They had talked about having real conversations in relationships, and when my partner had expressed how me and him handled things and felt about things in relationships and love, it had been shrugged off as bull by the female friend. I still do not understand this woman, but words does not cover it anymore in my case. 

We talk and talk about the pattern with his friends, we try to break down what has happened. I ask him if he has talked poorly to them about me, if it its caused by them trying to distance themselves from me due to something he has done or said about me, but he still holds to the fact that he defends me and praises me in their presence.

**The television contest night**

Last time we met, we got invited as a couple to watch a television contest show at the female friends apartment alongside the male couple. We arent super motivated to go, but i have thought to give it one last chance, as my partner is aware of their behaviours now and might be able to tell his friends to be respectful. 

We arrive at the door, nicely dressed and having brought what we were told to do beforehand.   
Then it all went quick. The intellectual male friend sat with my partner in the sofa, the soft kind male friend also on the sofa in the middle, and the female friend on the foots edge. When i got inside properly, there was no room for me, and i scrammed myself up on the corner next to the female friend. No other spot had space. She glanced at me like i was some kind of a rat plagued by disease, but said nothing. No one said anything to me or my partner for a while. 

Until the female friend asked ""and what have you two been up to?"". I did not want to talk about my unemployment since no one had asked me how i was doing or if i was okay, i had not existed. My partner tried resembling something we had done that he wanted to share, but took some seconds to think. Before he could speak, they interrupted him. I tried to answer the question, but they spoke over my voice two times. He managed to get some air, and told them about buying a bookshelf. The only comment came from the female girlfriend commenting that she will have one on that wall over there, when shes done renovating, aswell.   
On to the next topic, back to not existing. 

My partner felt the setting and asked me to come sit beside him in a chair instead. I did so, deciding that i will not be a bitch, this is his fight with his friends, not mine. Hes the man, he knows these people, i dont. I was invited here as his counterpart and they disrespect their friend by disrespecting his partner. He has social points enough to take the conflict head on, without damaging too much. I dont, i have no scores socially with people i barely know, to take from. Apparently, im on minus now.

During the whole evening the female only speaks to the kind soft guy. The intellectual male friend i really like, me and my partner, dont exist. were air. Occasionally during the contest part, the female friend will recount each time everyone knew the answer to a question on the show, that ""all three knew the answers"". She didnt count me in, even when one of us pointed out that were actually four, she overtrhows that with ""yes, us three knew the answer!"". Shes asking if everyone wants wine, and all of a sudden the fourth one in the company exists. But when i show her i have my own drink and that i dont need her to make me a glass of wine (thank god), shes even more stiff towards me, even though i was polite and said thank you. The female friend even dares to tell my partner when a football question comes up, that thats a thing between her and my partner, and them alone together. I almost drown myself bt my tiny aluminium wine can, when hearing it. I will not stoop down to her petty, if football is the only thing they have in common that i and him dont, then that just says it all anyhow.

I gave up on this friendgroup when i realized after enough repetition, that i was being bullied. I did not understand why i was invided in the first place. We go home early that night. 

My partner ties to say that this is normal behaviour in their group setting, that the female usually picks one person to chat with all night until their ears bleed, and that it could be any person really. But in my view, thats still just as rude. If you as a hostess invite a bunch of people and behave like this, shame on you! No matter how ""used to it"" you might be as a host, its still rude and unbelieveable.

# The chrisis

So i have enough. Either we solve this, or i dont want to see his friends no more. Which would be terribly complicated and sad since this is his only friends, and i have consciously chosen to stay by myself since i like peace of mind, and hate drama. 

My partner listens to me, and decides that he should bring the question up with his intellectual male friend, that we get along with and that also has some kind of leadership status in the group. We have good hope for the situation, and hope that we will find out what the problem is. He asks this male friend about the pattern around me, how i felt the last time we all met, how they did not speak to me, how the female friend and the kind friends behaviour can be seen as incredibly rude, how it is disrespectful in front of him to not respect his chosen lifepartner, etcetera. Everything on the table. 

The intellectual male friend replied that the best thing would be for him to go home and talk to his soft male counterpart, and return to my partner with the result after. After that debriefing the plan was to have a coffe meetup again between the four of us and figure out what has happened since summer when all was super good. 

A few days later the intellectual male friend comes back to my partner with one response. That the soft kind male partner only had stated that ""if this is so, then its weird that this girl has not came to me with it.""  
And theres that. End of conversation. 

Were planning our future together in all areas and details constantly. Hes getting less and less interested in meeting his friends by what it seems. Its all sad, because it would not have to be like this at all. People chose this, and i dont get it.

  
**This is where we are at.**   
What is wrong with people. Why is my partners friends acting like this and how does one go about it?  
Would i be insane if i denied any social interaction with these people? Im stuck mentally, i just dont get people.  
Hand me everything im missing.

Remember I told you about working on my diet and noticing how it makes me feel? Well this is the almighty kick in the shins: I had a cookie. ","Not just any cookie but one of my most favorite types of cookie: soft chocolate chip. It was literally perfect. 

But it was not like eating a cookie used to be and I will say I’m a tiny bit jittery today which is abnormal but I can’t say it was the cookie because I put some caffeinated coffee in my decaf so there are 2 variables because as you might have noticed, kids, auntie does not need any fucking stimulants but the caffeinated coffee really is so much more robust than decaf so sometimes splash some in there. 

Well I’m a citizen scientist kids. I’m sure the real ones would not do it this way but in all fairness, I don’t plan any of this I just find patterns and test them. So now we’ll isolate caffeine and sugar and see which one is the one that makes me feel like whatever this feeling is right now.

I remember Aajonus claiming he slept 4 hours a night with a nap during the day, so I was curious, was that just him or is it something related to the diet? Do you truly get more daytime on this diet. 

Personally I sleep atleast 8 hours a day, but I currently spend my days doing stressful activities while also having coffee and nicotine, so maybe that's why I need that much. 

I think it is also worth noting, I don't follow the diet, I eat raw meat and fruits only, the sourcing of the diet is too difficult for me as things are right now, but I was curious to see if anybody on this diet had the same success as Aajonus had in terms of sleep.",1,1732749959.0,rawprimal,5,1.0,False

>Charging an electric car at home in Australia is surprisingly affordable, especially with off-peak electricity rates as low as 8 cents per kWh. These rates are 4-5 times cheaper than standard electricity costs. For example, fully charging a 60 kWh battery only costs AUD 4.80, allowing me to drive about 400 km on a single charge.

To put it in perspective, a petrol car with an average fuel consumption of 7.5 litres per 100 km would need 30 litres of fuel to cover the same distance. At a fuel price of AUD 1.80 per litre, that’s AUD 54—making home charging roughly 11 times cheaper than refueling a petrol car for the same distance!

# How Much Electricity Does an EV Consume Annually?

In one year of owning a Tesla Model Y in Sydney, Australia, I drove **17,000 km** and consumed approximately 3,100 kWh of electricity, spending a total of **AUD 529 (\~340 USD)** on charging:

* **Home Charging: AUD 204 (82% of charging done at home)**
* **Supercharging: AUD 325**

This highlights the cost-effectiveness of EVs, with significantly lower running costs compared to traditional gas-powered vehicles.

While electricity consumption can vary based on driving habits, climate, and charging balance (home vs. public), home charging remains the most economical option for EV owners.

I also run a blog to share insights and raise awareness about EVs and sustainable transportation. If you're interested in learning more, feel free to check it out (techwheel . co)

1h1hxry,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h1hxry/should_i_continue_to_pursue_my_complex_career_in/,Should I continue to pursue my complex career in acting and journalism or just pursue law school instead? ,"I just turned 26 years old and have not been more confused about what I want my career path to be than ever now...I grew up doing theatre and acting in middle and high school, landing lead roles and getting into advanced acting classes; I was always told I was good at it and fell in love with it. I knew it was a career I wanted to pursue, and it inspired me to audition for acting programs for different conservatories and liberal arts colleges. 

I got accepted into various programs and attended a college in Colorado for theatre arts and acting. I enjoyed it for the most part, and I graduated in 2020. I hadn't realized the difficulty of getting a liberal arts degree would be when it came to finding work, so I just right away began working for my parents post-college, helping them out with their businesses for a couple of years; following that, I pursued my master's in Professional Creative Writing in 2022 with the intention to pursue a career in reporting and journalism. Since graduating last year, I have yet to land a stable job or a consistent income in that field. I have applied to countless editor, associate editor, reporter, staff writer, and blog writer roles, and nothing has stuck. It's been a tough industry to break into. 

I took on a couple of pro bono writing internships when pursuing my master's in order to build a writing portfiolio. I ended up publishing 17 articles with one blog writing company. Once I graduated, I landed a part-time job for a small indie magazine as a reporter and freelancer with inconsistent pay (pay is very slow and is 60-90 days out...it was stated on the form I signed before I accepted the job and I was taking whatever opportunity was coming my way). I have written and published 20+ articles for the magazine since and haver been with them for over a year now and I am also publishing a couple more articles from different news outlets before the end of the year. I have emailed countless reporters and journalists in the industry asking to connect and meet for coffee to get their advice on the industry and ways to find opportunities as a young journalist/writer in the industry. I have a meeting with a journalist next week who claims he will help me get a good opportunity at his news station. I was also told by one of the news outlets that I am writing an article for that they are looking for a new editor at the end of the year as well and I expressed my interest...so those are possible opportunities for potential jobs, but of course, I don't want to expect these things to just fall into my lap. 

With all that being said, I have a very complicated relationship with my family, who hate that I do the arts and my creative mindset and they've always resented the idea of my acting career. They are more fond of my writing career, but since I haven't landed a consistent and regal job after graduating with my master's (it's been over a year now), they think it is a useless degree and industry  and are starting to second guess my future success. They have always pressured me and wanted me to go to law school since I was a kid and they want me to become a lawyer and I resented it for the longest time. I recently, probably in the past year or so have considered law school as it could be a fruitful career route, and I am very concerned about my financial stability in the future and think I could find stability in that. My younger brother, who is currently studying political science at UCLA, also intends to pursue law, and hearing how he has explained things and the different ways my parents treat him and put him on a pedestal over me has pushed me into considering law school, for that sense of security, acknowledgement, and safety. I know my passion lies in writing and acting...I am just lost at what to do because I need a good job, I need a good income for a sense of livelihood. Is it delusional to say that I could pursue all three?

Should I continue pursuing my journalism/reporting and acting career and stick it out for as long as possible and see where it takes me, or is it about time I settled for my plan B for stability and contentment? (I also want to clarify that I am interested in many aspects of law, and my parents would for sure pay for my law school, so school debt and paying for school isn't an issue.)

Would love any and all advice! Thank you. ",1,1732749553.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False
1h1hx7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllureStories/comments/1h1hx7b/barstool_bargain/,Barstool Bargain,"The rain was relentless, hammering down on the pavement like a symphony of despair. I sat slumped in the corner of O’Malley’s, a dingy little bar that smelled of stale beer and lost hope. My suit was wrinkled, my tie loose, and my shirt stained with coffee from a clumsy spill that morning, though I wasn’t sure it mattered anymore. It had been the worst day of my life, the kind that left a permanent scar on your soul.

The call had come at 9:00 a.m., just as I was settling into my desk. I knew it was bad news before I picked up the receiver; the HR manager’s voice was too soft, too rehearsed. Budget cuts, they said. Nothing personal, they said. “We appreciate your contributions.” But no amount of corporate jargon could mask the fact that I was being tossed out like yesterday’s garbage.

By noon, the contents of my desk were packed into a cardboard box, and I was out on the street, jobless for the first time in fifteen years. It was raining then, too, a cruel metaphor, as if the universe had decided to mock me. I thought about calling Rachel, my wife, but decided against it. She’d been distant lately, her patience frayed by my long hours and dwindling paychecks.

I didn’t have to call her. She called me.

“I can’t do this anymore, Eric,” she said, her voice trembling but firm.

I knew what was coming. We’d been circling this drain for months.

“I’ve filed for divorce,” she continued. “I’ll send over the paperwork. I’m sorry.”

That was it. No tears, no drawn-out explanations. Just a clean, efficient severing of the life we’d built together. I sat in my car for an hour after the call, staring at the steering wheel, feeling the weight of everything crushing me.

So here I was, drowning my sorrows in whiskey at O’Malley’s, the only place in town where no one cared if you fell apart. The bartender, a grizzled man named Frank, slid me another glass without a word. The amber liquid burned as it went down, but the pain was a welcome distraction.

“Rough day?” a voice came from the seat beside me.

I hadn’t even noticed anyone sit down. Turning my head, I saw a man who didn’t quite fit the bar’s atmosphere. He was impeccably dressed in a charcoal-gray suit that looked like it cost more than my car. His hair was slicked back, and his dark eyes sparkled with an unsettling mix of amusement and curiosity.

“You could say that,” I muttered before taking another swig, not in the mood for small talk.

He smiled, revealing perfect white teeth. “I’d say it’s more than rough” he leaned in closer. “You’ve hit rock bottom, haven’t you?”

I stiffened, the words cutting deeper than they should have. “What’s it to you?”

He chuckled in a low, rich sound. “Let’s just say I have a talent for recognizing desperation. And you, my friend, are radiating it.”

I turned away, but he wasn’t deterred.

“Lost your job today,” he said, as if it were a casual observation. “And your wife, too. Oo now that’s quite the double blow,” he chuckled again. 

My blood ran cold. “How the hell do you know that?”

He didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he signaled to Frank for two drinks, one for himself and another for me. When the glasses arrived, he raised his in a toast.

“To new beginnings,” he said, his voice smooth as silk.

I didn’t move. “Who are you?”

He leaned in closer, his grin widening. “Let’s just say I’m someone who can help.”

“Help?” I scoffed. “Unless you’ve got a job and a time machine in that fancy suit of yours, I don’t see how.”

The stranger’s eyes gleamed. “Oh, I can do much better than that. I can give you everything you’ve ever wanted—money, power, love. A fresh start. All I ask in return is something you won’t even miss.”

I laughed bitterly. “Let me guess: my soul?” I took another drink. 

He tilted his head, feigning surprise. “Ah, you’ve heard this pitch before. But tell me, Eric, what’s your soul really worth? You’re miserable, broken. What if I told you that all of this,” he raised his hands and gestured all around him, “your failures, your pain, your loss, could all disappear with a single… stroke?”

I stared at him, half-convinced I was hallucinating. The whiskey had dulled my senses, but there was something unnervingly real about him.

“You’re serious?” I asked finally.

“Deadly.” He said without blinking as he pushed a sleek black pen and a folded piece of parchment toward me. The paper looked ancient, the writing on it ornate and otherworldly.

“All you have to do,” he said, “is sign.” There was excitement and anticipation in his voice. 

I hesitated, my hand hovering over the pen. My rational mind screamed at me to walk away, to laugh this off as some elaborate prank. But the darkness inside me whispered something else. “Do it,” I heard in my head. It sounded like the stranger’s voice, but how could it have been? His lips hadn’t moved. It was a thought I had in my head, wasn’t it?

“What’s the catch?” I asked.

“There’s always a catch,” he admitted matter of factly. “But wouldn’t you rather live your life like a king, even for a short while, than waste away in obscurity?”

I looked around the bar, at the peeling wallpaper and the flickering neon sign. This wasn’t just rock bottom. It was the grave I’d been digging for myself for years.

The stranger leaned in again, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “Picture this: tomorrow morning, you wake up in a penthouse. There’s a seven-figure balance in your bank account. Then the phone rings. It’s your dream job, begging you to join their team. Rachel? She’s begging to come back, but fuck her! You’re too busy deciding which of your many admirers is worth your time. This isn’t a fantasy, Eric. This is real. I can make it happen.”

My throat tightened. It did sound like the perfect life. The life I had dreamed. The life I deserved! Hadn’t I earned it? Worked my ass off only to get let go, tried to save a failing marriage. I poured my heart and soul into everything! And what did as I get as a thank you. I got jack-shit! 

As I reached for the pen, something inside me, something buried deep, made me stop. My mother’s voice, soft and full of faith, echoed in my mind: “When you’re lost, Eric, pray. God listens, even when you feel like no one else does.”

I dropped my head into my hands, closed my eyes, and began to pray. My words were clumsy, desperate, and tear soaked. It was a plea for strength, for guidance, for a sign that I wasn’t alone in this darkness.

The stranger’s smile vanished, replaced by a sharp glare.

“Praying? To Him?”  he sneered, his voice cold and dripping with contempt. “Eric don’t waste your time. Do you really think He’s going to swoop in and save you now? After all you’ve been through? Where was He when you lost your job? When your wife walked away? When you cried yourself to sleep, begging for just one break? He’s not listening. He never was.”

I tightened my eyes shut, ignoring the mocking venom in his tone. I whispered another prayer, more insistent this time.

The stranger’s calm began to crack. His voice turned sharp, filled with agitation. “Stop it,” he demanded, leaning in so close I could feel the unnatural chill radiating from him. “You think muttering those words will change anything? You think He cares about you? Look at your life, Eric! He’s the reason you’re here. He let you fail. He let you fall.”

I gripped the edge of the bar, my knuckles white as I continued to pray.

“Enough!” the stranger barked, slamming his hand on the bar. The glasses rattled, the sound piercing the heavy air. His composed demeanor slipped further, his face contorting into something darker, more feral. “Do you hear me, Eric? He. Does. Not. Care!” His voice grew louder with each word, almost a roar. “Why waste your breath on a God who abandoned you when you needed Him most?”

I opened my eyes just enough to glance at him, his face twisted with frustration. I closed them again and started to pray again. 

“Eric you’re throwing away the only real chance you’ve got!” His voice was no longer smooth and enticing; it was raw, jagged, desperate. “Look at me, Eric. I’m here. I’m offering you something tangible. A way out of this misery. God isn’t coming to save you! He doesn’t care if you rot in this bar or die in the gutter.”

I ignored him as my prayers grew louder, the words clumsy but filled with growing conviction.

The stranger snarled, his voice dropping into something inhuman. “Stop it! You think He’s going to help you? You’re nothing to Him! You’re a  speck. A failure. A man who couldn’t even keep his life together. And yet here I am, offering you salvation, and you’d rather grovel to a deity who asks for your unwavering faith and devotion but offers nothing in return?!”

I opened my eyes as he stood, towering over me as the stool was thrown to the ground. The shadows around him deepening, his eyes glowing faintly with a sinister light. “You’re wasting precious time,” he hissed, jabbing a finger at the contract on the bar. “Sign the fucking paper, Eric! Let go of this foolish hope. It’s pathetic. You think you’re strong enough to get through this without me? You’re not. You’re nothing without me.”

I raised my head, meeting his gaze. There was a calmness in me now, something steady and resolute that hadn’t been there before. Then, I felt something. It felt like a hand. A fatherly hand on my shoulder from somewhere behind me. It was firm, but most importantly, comforting. 

“If I’m nothing,” I said quietly, “then why are you so desperate?”

The stranger flinched as though struck, his eyes widening in shock. For a moment, the mask he wore slipped completely, revealing something monstrous beneath the surface. His perfectly polished exterior flickered like a bad signal, the illusion cracking and warping. “You don’t understand,” he hissed, his voice a guttural growl. “You’re throwing away everything! He doesn’t deserve your prayers. I’m the one who’s here. I’m the one offering you a way out.”

I stood, pushing the pen and parchment back toward him. “No,” I said firmly. “You’re offering chains.”

The stranger’s composure shattered. He bared his teeth, now sharp and gleaming like blades. The air around him seemed to vibrate with an unnatural energy, the shadows swirling like a living thing. “You’ll regret this,” he snarled, his voice distorted, almost unrecognizable. “You’ll come crawling back to me when you realize He’s not coming for you. And when you do, the price will be so much, much worse.”

I held my ground, meeting his gaze. “I’d rather take my chances with Him than spend a second chained to you.”

His fury exploded, a guttural roar filling the bar as the lights flickered and the shadows closed in. Then, as quickly as it began, the storm of his anger subsided. He straightened his suit, the edges of his form flickering one last time before solidifying.

“This isn’t over, Eric,” he growled, his voice low and venomous. And then, with a sharp snap, he vanished, leaving behind the pen and parchment.

The storm outside had stopped. I looked down at the bar, at the empty glass in front of me, and for the first time all day, I felt something stir inside me…hope.",1,1732749509.0,AllureStories,0,1.0,False

“There’s always a catch,” he admitted matter of factly. “But wouldn’t you rather live your life like a king, even for a short while, than waste away in obscurity?”

I looked around the bar, at the peeling wallpaper and the flickering neon sign. This wasn’t just rock bottom. It was the grave I’d been digging for myself for years.

The stranger leaned in again, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “Picture this: tomorrow morning, you wake up in a penthouse. There’s a seven-figure balance in your bank account. Then the phone rings. It’s your dream job, begging you to join their team. Rachel? She’s begging to come back, but fuck her! You’re too busy deciding which of your many admirers is worth your time. This isn’t a fantasy, Eric. This is real. I can make it happen.”

My throat tightened. It did sound like the perfect life. The life I had dreamed. The life I deserved! Hadn’t I earned it? Worked my ass off only to get let go, tried to save a failing marriage. I poured my heart and soul into everything! And what did as I get as a thank you. I got jack-shit! 

As I reached for the pen, something inside me, something buried deep, made me stop. My mother’s voice, soft and full of faith, echoed in my mind: “When you’re lost, Eric, pray. God listens, even when you feel like no one else does.”

I dropped my head into my hands, closed my eyes, and began to pray. My words were clumsy, desperate, and tear soaked. It was a plea for strength, for guidance, for a sign that I wasn’t alone in this darkness.

The stranger’s smile vanished, replaced by a sharp glare.

“Praying? To Him?”  he sneered, his voice cold and dripping with contempt. “Eric don’t waste your time. Do you really think He’s going to swoop in and save you now? After all you’ve been through? Where was He when you lost your job? When your wife walked away? When you cried yourself to sleep, begging for just one break? He’s not listening. He never was.”

I tightened my eyes shut, ignoring the mocking venom in his tone. I whispered another prayer, more insistent this time.

The stranger’s calm began to crack. His voice turned sharp, filled with agitation. “Stop it,” he demanded, leaning in so close I could feel the unnatural chill radiating from him. “You think muttering those words will change anything? You think He cares about you? Look at your life, Eric! He’s the reason you’re here. He let you fail. He let you fall.”

I gripped the edge of the bar, my knuckles white as I continued to pray.

“Enough!” the stranger barked, slamming his hand on the bar. The glasses rattled, the sound piercing the heavy air. His composed demeanor slipped further, his face contorting into something darker, more feral. “Do you hear me, Eric? He. Does. Not. Care!” His voice grew louder with each word, almost a roar. “Why waste your breath on a God who abandoned you when you needed Him most?”

I opened my eyes just enough to glance at him, his face twisted with frustration. I closed them again and started to pray again. 

“Eric you’re throwing away the only real chance you’ve got!” His voice was no longer smooth and enticing; it was raw, jagged, desperate. “Look at me, Eric. I’m here. I’m offering you something tangible. A way out of this misery. God isn’t coming to save you! He doesn’t care if you rot in this bar or die in the gutter.”

I ignored him as my prayers grew louder, the words clumsy but filled with growing conviction.

The stranger snarled, his voice dropping into something inhuman. “Stop it! You think He’s going to help you? You’re nothing to Him! You’re a  speck. A failure. A man who couldn’t even keep his life together. And yet here I am, offering you salvation, and you’d rather grovel to a deity who asks for your unwavering faith and devotion but offers nothing in return?!”

I opened my eyes as he stood, towering over me as the stool was thrown to the ground. The shadows around him deepening, his eyes glowing faintly with a sinister light. “You’re wasting precious time,” he hissed, jabbing a finger at the contract on the bar. “Sign the fucking paper, Eric! Let go of this foolish hope. It’s pathetic. You think you’re strong enough to get through this without me? You’re not. You’re nothing without me.”

I raised my head, meeting his gaze. There was a calmness in me now, something steady and resolute that hadn’t been there before. Then, I felt something. It felt like a hand. A fatherly hand on my shoulder from somewhere behind me. It was firm, but most importantly, comforting. 

“If I’m nothing,” I said quietly, “then why are you so desperate?”

The stranger flinched as though struck, his eyes widening in shock. For a moment, the mask he wore slipped completely, revealing something monstrous beneath the surface. His perfectly polished exterior flickered like a bad signal, the illusion cracking and warping. “You don’t understand,” he hissed, his voice a guttural growl. “You’re throwing away everything! He doesn’t deserve your prayers. I’m the one who’s here. I’m the one offering you a way out.”

I stood, pushing the pen and parchment back toward him. “No,” I said firmly. “You’re offering chains.”

The stranger’s composure shattered. He bared his teeth, now sharp and gleaming like blades. The air around him seemed to vibrate with an unnatural energy, the shadows swirling like a living thing. “You’ll regret this,” he snarled, his voice distorted, almost unrecognizable. “You’ll come crawling back to me when you realize He’s not coming for you. And when you do, the price will be so much, much worse.”

I held my ground, meeting his gaze. “I’d rather take my chances with Him than spend a second chained to you.”

His fury exploded, a guttural roar filling the bar as the lights flickered and the shadows closed in. Then, as quickly as it began, the storm of his anger subsided. He straightened his suit, the edges of his form flickering one last time before solidifying.

“This isn’t over, Eric,” he growled, his voice low and venomous. And then, with a sharp snap, he vanished, leaving behind the pen and parchment.

The storm outside had stopped. I looked down at the bar, at the empty glass in front of me, and for the first time all day, I felt something stir inside me…hope.",1,1732749470.0,MrCreepyPasta,0,1.0,False
1h1hwgj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepypastastories/comments/1h1hwgj/barstool_bargain/,Barstool Bargain,"The rain was relentless, hammering down on the pavement like a symphony of despair. I sat slumped in the corner of O’Malley’s, a dingy little bar that smelled of stale beer and lost hope. My suit was wrinkled, my tie loose, and my shirt stained with coffee from a clumsy spill that morning, though I wasn’t sure it mattered anymore. It had been the worst day of my life, the kind that left a permanent scar on your soul.

The call had come at 9:00 a.m., just as I was settling into my desk. I knew it was bad news before I picked up the receiver; the HR manager’s voice was too soft, too rehearsed. Budget cuts, they said. Nothing personal, they said. “We appreciate your contributions.” But no amount of corporate jargon could mask the fact that I was being tossed out like yesterday’s garbage.

By noon, the contents of my desk were packed into a cardboard box, and I was out on the street, jobless for the first time in fifteen years. It was raining then, too, a cruel metaphor, as if the universe had decided to mock me. I thought about calling Rachel, my wife, but decided against it. She’d been distant lately, her patience frayed by my long hours and dwindling paychecks.

I didn’t have to call her. She called me.

“I can’t do this anymore, Eric,” she said, her voice trembling but firm.

I knew what was coming. We’d been circling this drain for months.

“I’ve filed for divorce,” she continued. “I’ll send over the paperwork. I’m sorry.”

That was it. No tears, no drawn-out explanations. Just a clean, efficient severing of the life we’d built together. I sat in my car for an hour after the call, staring at the steering wheel, feeling the weight of everything crushing me.

So here I was, drowning my sorrows in whiskey at O’Malley’s, the only place in town where no one cared if you fell apart. The bartender, a grizzled man named Frank, slid me another glass without a word. The amber liquid burned as it went down, but the pain was a welcome distraction.

“Rough day?” a voice came from the seat beside me.

I hadn’t even noticed anyone sit down. Turning my head, I saw a man who didn’t quite fit the bar’s atmosphere. He was impeccably dressed in a charcoal-gray suit that looked like it cost more than my car. His hair was slicked back, and his dark eyes sparkled with an unsettling mix of amusement and curiosity.

“You could say that,” I muttered before taking another swig, not in the mood for small talk.

He smiled, revealing perfect white teeth. “I’d say it’s more than rough” he leaned in closer. “You’ve hit rock bottom, haven’t you?”

I stiffened, the words cutting deeper than they should have. “What’s it to you?”

He chuckled in a low, rich sound. “Let’s just say I have a talent for recognizing desperation. And you, my friend, are radiating it.”

I turned away, but he wasn’t deterred.

“Lost your job today,” he said, as if it were a casual observation. “And your wife, too. Oo now that’s quite the double blow,” he chuckled again. 

My blood ran cold. “How the hell do you know that?”

He didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he signaled to Frank for two drinks, one for himself and another for me. When the glasses arrived, he raised his in a toast.

“To new beginnings,” he said, his voice smooth as silk.

I didn’t move. “Who are you?”

He leaned in closer, his grin widening. “Let’s just say I’m someone who can help.”

“Help?” I scoffed. “Unless you’ve got a job and a time machine in that fancy suit of yours, I don’t see how.”

The stranger’s eyes gleamed. “Oh, I can do much better than that. I can give you everything you’ve ever wanted—money, power, love. A fresh start. All I ask in return is something you won’t even miss.”

I laughed bitterly. “Let me guess: my soul?” I took another drink. 

He tilted his head, feigning surprise. “Ah, you’ve heard this pitch before. But tell me, Eric, what’s your soul really worth? You’re miserable, broken. What if I told you that all of this,” he raised his hands and gestured all around him, “your failures, your pain, your loss, could all disappear with a single… stroke?”

I stared at him, half-convinced I was hallucinating. The whiskey had dulled my senses, but there was something unnervingly real about him.

“You’re serious?” I asked finally.

“Deadly.” He said without blinking as he pushed a sleek black pen and a folded piece of parchment toward me. The paper looked ancient, the writing on it ornate and otherworldly.

“All you have to do,” he said, “is sign.” There was excitement and anticipation in his voice. 

I hesitated, my hand hovering over the pen. My rational mind screamed at me to walk away, to laugh this off as some elaborate prank. But the darkness inside me whispered something else. “Do it,” I heard in my head. It sounded like the stranger’s voice, but how could it have been? His lips hadn’t moved. It was a thought I had in my head, wasn’t it?

“What’s the catch?” I asked.

“There’s always a catch,” he admitted matter of factly. “But wouldn’t you rather live your life like a king, even for a short while, than waste away in obscurity?”

# Background & Training

This is my third time posting in this sub, and while the mods keep removing my updates (third time’s the charm?), I’m endlessly thankful for the support and advice I’ve received here. You all helped me through this journey, and I hope this one sticks.

This marathon marked a big comeback for me. I started running again in April after recovering from a labral tear in my hip that had me sidelined since January. The injury forced me to rethink my approach to training entirely. I’ve since lost a bit of weight, improved my nutrition, and stuck to a consistent PT and strength training routine. Early on, I leaned heavily on spinning (8–10 hours) and trail running was the only way I could build volume without pain, and I kept it in my routine even after transitioning back to roads.

Choosing the right plan was a challenge. I originally considered Pfitz 18/55 but worried my base wouldn’t be strong enough to start safely. Instead, I followed the [BAA Level 2 plan](https://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon/train/leveltwo), which offered a more conservative mileage progression, but I still averaged 43 miles/week, while leaving room for cross-training. I also liked the plan’s incorporation of workouts into long runs—a feature that helped me mentally break up those daunting 16–20 mile efforts.

My training focused on heart rate rather than pace, especially during the summer heat and humidity, since pace felt unreliable on trails and in tough conditions. I worked hard to dial in my effort and relied on this approach to guide my workouts. Racing during the build also helped me mentally and physically. I hit PRs in the 5K twice (21:17 in August on a hot, hilly course and 20:47 in September on a warm, flat course).

The biggest confidence boost came four weeks out, when I ran a half marathon in 1:30 on a course with over 900 feet of elevation gain and even set a 5K PR mid-race. This half helped me finalize my marathon strategy. I decided to aim for a conservative start at a 3:22 pace to leave room for a push in the later miles, while focusing on effort and staying controlled. My goal was clear: a BQ with a buffer that might help me get accepted.

# Pre-race

I used a carb-loading calculator to aim for 430g/day over three days. My husband joined in solidarity, which made it more fun. We stayed downtown near the start, and I woke up at 4 a.m. for coffee, a bagel, and sipped Nuun Endurance while getting ready. I felt calmer than my first marathon but still a little jittery. 

Critically I wanted to get a final bathroom stop before the race and lines at the porta-potties were *massive*. I took my Maurten gel while waiting, made it just in time, and dashed to the corral without doing my usual warm-up drills. I ended up with the 3:25 pace group, figuring it was a good spot to start conservatively before speeding up.

# Race

The start was electric, and I took off with the 3:25 group. Their 7:40 splits surprised me, but it aligned with my 3:22 plan so I figured I would stay with them for a bit. Aid stations were chaotic, so I pulled ahead after mile 4 to make fueling easier. I broke the race into fueling chunks, taking gels at miles 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 (caffeinated Maurten), and 22. This gave me \~50g carbs/hour which was solid but something I think I’ll aim to increase next time.

I kept reminding myself to stay controlled and focused on good form. Before I knew it the halfway point flew by, and I still felt strong. The windy bridge around mile 15 ended up being my favorite section, thanks to trail training that made the incline manageable. I paced with groups for wind cover, which kept me focused. Flat Coca-Cola from an aid station near mile 16 gave me a surprise energy boost, and the crowd support was *amazing*.

At mile 22 I planned to take my final gel, but things got a little messy where the marathon and half marathon courses overlapped. A half marathoner crossed over to the marathon side of the course and stopped *dead* in front of me when I was approaching the aid station, and I narrowly avoided a collision. I delayed my gel to mile 23 and tried to pick up the pace. My heart rate was steady, and aerobically I felt good, but my legs felt jello-like and struggled to turn over faster. Still, I pushed hard and soaked in the crowd’s energy on the downhill finish, a little nervous that I’d fall in front of the crowd because of my jello legs. I crossed the line in 3:17 with about an 8-minute BQ buffer and a massive PR!

# Post-race

Richmond’s post-race party was fantastic—pizza and Tito’s vodka for the win. Later, we toasted with champagne and celebrated with my in-laws over a nice dinner.

What’s next? I’m eyeing a spring half to work on foot speed (to maybe tackle that weird leg disconnect) and a fall full. Current contenders for next fall are: Twin Cities, Marine Corps, or Wineglass. If you’ve run any of these, I’d love to hear your thoughts!

Big thanks to this sub for all the advice and support—you’ve been incredible.  (Mods, if you’re reading this, my next PR is dedicated to you… if this post survives!)

I didn’t have to call her. She called me.

“I can’t do this anymore, Eric,” she said, her voice trembling but firm.

“I’ve filed for divorce,” she continued. “I’ll send over the paperwork. I’m sorry.”

He chuckled in a low, rich sound. “Let’s just say I have a talent for recognizing desperation. And you, my friend, are radiating it.”

I turned away, but he wasn’t deterred.

“Lost your job today,” he said, as if it were a casual observation. “And your wife, too. Oo now that’s quite the double blow,” he chuckled again.

He leaned in closer, his grin widening. “Let’s just say I’m someone who can help.”

“Help?” I scoffed. “Unless you’ve got a job and a time machine in that fancy suit of yours, I don’t see how.”

The stranger’s eyes gleamed. “Oh, I can do much better than that. I can give you everything you’ve ever wanted—money, power, love. A fresh start. All I ask in return is something you won’t even miss.”

I laughed bitterly. “Let me guess: my soul?” I took another drink.

But the darkness inside me whispered something else. “Do it,” I heard in my head. It sounded like the stranger’s voice, but how could it have been? His lips hadn’t moved. It was a thought I had in my head, wasn’t it?

“What’s the catch?” I asked.

“There’s always a catch,” he admitted matter of factly. “But wouldn’t you rather live your life like a king, even for a short while, than waste away in obscurity?”

I looked around the bar, at the peeling wallpaper and the flickering neon sign. This wasn’t just rock bottom. It was the grave I’d been digging for myself for years.

The stranger leaned in again, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “Picture this: tomorrow morning, you wake up in a penthouse. There’s a seven-figure balance in your bank account. Then the phone rings. It’s your dream job, begging you to join their team. Rachel? She’s begging to come back, but fuck her! You’re too busy deciding which of your many admirers is worth your time. This isn’t a fantasy, Eric. This is real. I can make it happen.”

My throat tightened. It did sound like the perfect life. The life I had dreamed. The life I deserved! Hadn’t I earned it? Worked my ass off only to get let go, tried to save a failing marriage. I poured my heart and soul into everything! And what did as I get as a thank you. I got jack-shit! 

As I reached for the pen, something inside me, something buried deep, made me stop. My mother’s voice, soft and full of faith, echoed in my mind: “When you’re lost, Eric, pray. God listens, even when you feel like no one else does.”

I dropped my head into my hands, closed my eyes, and began to pray. My words were clumsy, desperate, and tear soaked. It was a plea for strength, for guidance, for a sign that I wasn’t alone in this darkness.

The stranger’s smile vanished, replaced by a sharp glare.

“Praying? To Him?”  he sneered, his voice cold and dripping with contempt. “Eric don’t waste your time. Do you really think He’s going to swoop in and save you now? After all you’ve been through? Where was He when you lost your job? When your wife walked away? When you cried yourself to sleep, begging for just one break? He’s not listening. He never was.”

I tightened my eyes shut, ignoring the mocking venom in his tone. I whispered another prayer, more insistent this time.

The stranger’s calm began to crack. His voice turned sharp, filled with agitation. “Stop it,” he demanded, leaning in so close I could feel the unnatural chill radiating from him. “You think muttering those words will change anything? You think He cares about you? Look at your life, Eric! He’s the reason you’re here. He let you fail. He let you fall.”

I gripped the edge of the bar, my knuckles white as I continued to pray.

“Enough!” the stranger barked, slamming his hand on the bar. The glasses rattled, the sound piercing the heavy air. His composed demeanor slipped further, his face contorting into something darker, more feral. “Do you hear me, Eric? He. Does. Not. Care!” His voice grew louder with each word, almost a roar. “Why waste your breath on a God who abandoned you when you needed Him most?”

I opened my eyes just enough to glance at him, his face twisted with frustration. I closed them again and started to pray again. 

“Eric you’re throwing away the only real chance you’ve got!” His voice was no longer smooth and enticing; it was raw, jagged, desperate. “Look at me, Eric. I’m here. I’m offering you something tangible. A way out of this misery. God isn’t coming to save you! He doesn’t care if you rot in this bar or die in the gutter.”

I ignored him as my prayers grew louder, the words clumsy but filled with growing conviction.

The stranger snarled, his voice dropping into something inhuman. “Stop it! You think He’s going to help you? You’re nothing to Him! You’re a  speck. A failure. A man who couldn’t even keep his life together. And yet here I am, offering you salvation, and you’d rather grovel to a deity who asks for your unwavering faith and devotion but offers nothing in return?!”

I opened my eyes as he stood, towering over me as the stool was thrown to the ground. The shadows around him deepening, his eyes glowing faintly with a sinister light. “You’re wasting precious time,” he hissed, jabbing a finger at the contract on the bar. “Sign the fucking paper, Eric! Let go of this foolish hope. It’s pathetic. You think you’re strong enough to get through this without me? You’re not. You’re nothing without me.”

I raised my head, meeting his gaze. There was a calmness in me now, something steady and resolute that hadn’t been there before. Then, I felt something. It felt like a hand. A fatherly hand on my shoulder from somewhere behind me. It was firm, but most importantly, comforting. 

“If I’m nothing,” I said quietly, “then why are you so desperate?”

The stranger flinched as though struck, his eyes widening in shock. For a moment, the mask he wore slipped completely, revealing something monstrous beneath the surface. His perfectly polished exterior flickered like a bad signal, the illusion cracking and warping. “You don’t understand,” he hissed, his voice a guttural growl. “You’re throwing away everything! He doesn’t deserve your prayers. I’m the one who’s here. I’m the one offering you a way out.”

I stood, pushing the pen and parchment back toward him. “No,” I said firmly. “You’re offering chains.”

The stranger’s composure shattered. He bared his teeth, now sharp and gleaming like blades. The air around him seemed to vibrate with an unnatural energy, the shadows swirling like a living thing. “You’ll regret this,” he snarled, his voice distorted, almost unrecognizable. “You’ll come crawling back to me when you realize He’s not coming for you. And when you do, the price will be so much, much worse.”

I held my ground, meeting his gaze. “I’d rather take my chances with Him than spend a second chained to you.”

His fury exploded, a guttural roar filling the bar as the lights flickered and the shadows closed in. Then, as quickly as it began, the storm of his anger subsided. He straightened his suit, the edges of his form flickering one last time before solidifying.

“This isn’t over, Eric,” he growled, his voice low and venomous. And then, with a sharp snap, he vanished, leaving behind the pen and parchment.

1h1hvpc,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1h1hvpc/barstool_bargain/,Barstool Bargain,"The rain was relentless, hammering down on the pavement like a symphony of despair. I sat slumped in the corner of O’Malley’s, a dingy little bar that smelled of stale beer and lost hope. My suit was wrinkled, my tie loose, and my shirt stained with coffee from a clumsy spill that morning, though I wasn’t sure it mattered anymore. It had been the worst day of my life, the kind that left a permanent scar on your soul.

The call had come at 9:00 a.m., just as I was settling into my desk. I knew it was bad news before I picked up the receiver; the HR manager’s voice was too soft, too rehearsed. Budget cuts, they said. Nothing personal, they said. “We appreciate your contributions.” But no amount of corporate jargon could mask the fact that I was being tossed out like yesterday’s garbage.

By noon, the contents of my desk were packed into a cardboard box, and I was out on the street, jobless for the first time in fifteen years. It was raining then, too, a cruel metaphor, as if the universe had decided to mock me. I thought about calling Rachel, my wife, but decided against it. She’d been distant lately, her patience frayed by my long hours and dwindling paychecks.

I didn’t have to call her. She called me.

“I can’t do this anymore, Eric,” she said, her voice trembling but firm.

I knew what was coming. We’d been circling this drain for months.

“I’ve filed for divorce,” she continued. “I’ll send over the paperwork. I’m sorry.”

That was it. No tears, no drawn-out explanations. Just a clean, efficient severing of the life we’d built together. I sat in my car for an hour after the call, staring at the steering wheel, feeling the weight of everything crushing me.

So here I was, drowning my sorrows in whiskey at O’Malley’s, the only place in town where no one cared if you fell apart. The bartender, a grizzled man named Frank, slid me another glass without a word. The amber liquid burned as it went down, but the pain was a welcome distraction.

“Rough day?” a voice came from the seat beside me.

I hadn’t even noticed anyone sit down. Turning my head, I saw a man who didn’t quite fit the bar’s atmosphere. He was impeccably dressed in a charcoal-gray suit that looked like it cost more than my car. His hair was slicked back, and his dark eyes sparkled with an unsettling mix of amusement and curiosity.

“You could say that,” I muttered before taking another swig, not in the mood for small talk.

He smiled, revealing perfect white teeth. “I’d say it’s more than rough” he leaned in closer. “You’ve hit rock bottom, haven’t you?”

I stiffened, the words cutting deeper than they should have. “What’s it to you?”

He chuckled in a low, rich sound. “Let’s just say I have a talent for recognizing desperation. And you, my friend, are radiating it.”

I turned away, but he wasn’t deterred.

“Lost your job today,” he said, as if it were a casual observation. “And your wife, too. Oo now that’s quite the double blow,” he chuckled again. 

My blood ran cold. “How the hell do you know that?”

He didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he signaled to Frank for two drinks, one for himself and another for me. When the glasses arrived, he raised his in a toast.

“To new beginnings,” he said, his voice smooth as silk.

I didn’t move. “Who are you?”

He leaned in closer, his grin widening. “Let’s just say I’m someone who can help.”

“Help?” I scoffed. “Unless you’ve got a job and a time machine in that fancy suit of yours, I don’t see how.”

The stranger’s eyes gleamed. “Oh, I can do much better than that. I can give you everything you’ve ever wanted—money, power, love. A fresh start. All I ask in return is something you won’t even miss.”

I laughed bitterly. “Let me guess: my soul?” I took another drink. 

He tilted his head, feigning surprise. “Ah, you’ve heard this pitch before. But tell me, Eric, what’s your soul really worth? You’re miserable, broken. What if I told you that all of this,” he raised his hands and gestured all around him, “your failures, your pain, your loss, could all disappear with a single… stroke?”

I stared at him, half-convinced I was hallucinating. The whiskey had dulled my senses, but there was something unnervingly real about him.

“You’re serious?” I asked finally.

“Deadly.” He said without blinking as he pushed a sleek black pen and a folded piece of parchment toward me. The paper looked ancient, the writing on it ornate and otherworldly.

“All you have to do,” he said, “is sign.” There was excitement and anticipation in his voice. 

I hesitated, my hand hovering over the pen. My rational mind screamed at me to walk away, to laugh this off as some elaborate prank. But the darkness inside me whispered something else. “Do it,” I heard in my head. It sounded like the stranger’s voice, but how could it have been? His lips hadn’t moved. It was a thought I had in my head, wasn’t it?

“What’s the catch?” I asked.

“There’s always a catch,” he admitted matter of factly. “But wouldn’t you rather live your life like a king, even for a short while, than waste away in obscurity?”

I looked around the bar, at the peeling wallpaper and the flickering neon sign. This wasn’t just rock bottom. It was the grave I’d been digging for myself for years.

The stranger leaned in again, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “Picture this: tomorrow morning, you wake up in a penthouse. There’s a seven-figure balance in your bank account. Then the phone rings. It’s your dream job, begging you to join their team. Rachel? She’s begging to come back, but fuck her! You’re too busy deciding which of your many admirers is worth your time. This isn’t a fantasy, Eric. This is real. I can make it happen.”

My throat tightened. It did sound like the perfect life. The life I had dreamed. The life I deserved! Hadn’t I earned it? Worked my ass off only to get let go, tried to save a failing marriage. I poured my heart and soul into everything! And what did as I get as a thank you. I got jack-shit!

He chuckled in a low, rich sound. “Let’s just say I have a talent for recognizing desperation. And you, my friend, are radiating it.”

I turned away, but he wasn’t deterred.

“Lost your job today,” he said, as if it were a casual observation. “And your wife, too. Oo now that’s quite the double blow,” he chuckled again. 

My blood ran cold. “How the hell do you know that?”

He didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he signaled to Frank for two drinks, one for himself and another for me. When the glasses arrived, he raised his in a toast.

“To new beginnings,” he said, his voice smooth as silk.

I didn’t move. “Who are you?”

He leaned in closer, his grin widening. “Let’s just say I’m someone who can help.”

“Help?” I scoffed. “Unless you’ve got a job and a time machine in that fancy suit of yours, I don’t see how.”

The stranger’s eyes gleamed. “Oh, I can do much better than that. I can give you everything you’ve ever wanted—money, power, love. A fresh start. All I ask in return is something you won’t even miss.”

I laughed bitterly. “Let me guess: my soul?” I took another drink. 

He tilted his head, feigning surprise. “Ah, you’ve heard this pitch before. But tell me, Eric, what’s your soul really worth? You’re miserable, broken. What if I told you that all of this,” he raised his hands and gestured all around him, “your failures, your pain, your loss, could all disappear with a single… stroke?”

I stared at him, half-convinced I was hallucinating. The whiskey had dulled my senses, but there was something unnervingly real about him.

“You’re serious?” I asked finally.

“Deadly.” He said without blinking as he pushed a sleek black pen and a folded piece of parchment toward me. The paper looked ancient, the writing on it ornate and otherworldly.

“All you have to do,” he said, “is sign.” There was excitement and anticipation in his voice. 

I hesitated, my hand hovering over the pen. My rational mind screamed at me to walk away, to laugh this off as some elaborate prank. But the darkness inside me whispered something else. “Do it,” I heard in my head. It sounded like the stranger’s voice, but how could it have been? His lips hadn’t moved. It was a thought I had in my head, wasn’t it?

“What’s the catch?” I asked.

“There’s always a catch,” he admitted matter of factly. “But wouldn’t you rather live your life like a king, even for a short while, than waste away in obscurity?”

I looked around the bar, at the peeling wallpaper and the flickering neon sign. This wasn’t just rock bottom. It was the grave I’d been digging for myself for years.

The stranger leaned in again, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “Picture this: tomorrow morning, you wake up in a penthouse. There’s a seven-figure balance in your bank account. Then the phone rings. It’s your dream job, begging you to join their team. Rachel? She’s begging to come back, but fuck her! You’re too busy deciding which of your many admirers is worth your time. This isn’t a fantasy, Eric. This is real. I can make it happen.”

My throat tightened. It did sound like the perfect life. The life I had dreamed. The life I deserved! Hadn’t I earned it? Worked my ass off only to get let go, tried to save a failing marriage. I poured my heart and soul into everything! And what did as I get as a thank you. I got jack-shit! 

As I reached for the pen, something inside me, something buried deep, made me stop. My mother’s voice, soft and full of faith, echoed in my mind: “When you’re lost, Eric, pray. God listens, even when you feel like no one else does.”

I dropped my head into my hands, closed my eyes, and began to pray. My words were clumsy, desperate, and tear soaked. It was a plea for strength, for guidance, for a sign that I wasn’t alone in this darkness.

The stranger’s smile vanished, replaced by a sharp glare.

“Praying? To Him?”  he sneered, his voice cold and dripping with contempt. “Eric don’t waste your time. Do you really think He’s going to swoop in and save you now? After all you’ve been through? Where was He when you lost your job? When your wife walked away? When you cried yourself to sleep, begging for just one break? He’s not listening. He never was.”

I tightened my eyes shut, ignoring the mocking venom in his tone. I whispered another prayer, more insistent this time.

The stranger’s calm began to crack. His voice turned sharp, filled with agitation. “Stop it,” he demanded, leaning in so close I could feel the unnatural chill radiating from him. “You think muttering those words will change anything? You think He cares about you? Look at your life, Eric! He’s the reason you’re here. He let you fail. He let you fall.”

I gripped the edge of the bar, my knuckles white as I continued to pray.

“Enough!” the stranger barked, slamming his hand on the bar. The glasses rattled, the sound piercing the heavy air. His composed demeanor slipped further, his face contorting into something darker, more feral. “Do you hear me, Eric? He. Does. Not. Care!” His voice grew louder with each word, almost a roar. “Why waste your breath on a God who abandoned you when you needed Him most?”

I opened my eyes just enough to glance at him, his face twisted with frustration. I closed them again and started to pray again. 

“Eric you’re throwing away the only real chance you’ve got!” His voice was no longer smooth and enticing; it was raw, jagged, desperate. “Look at me, Eric. I’m here. I’m offering you something tangible. A way out of this misery. God isn’t coming to save you! He doesn’t care if you rot in this bar or die in the gutter.”

I ignored him as my prayers grew louder, the words clumsy but filled with growing conviction.

The stranger snarled, his voice dropping into something inhuman. “Stop it! You think He’s going to help you? You’re nothing to Him! You’re a  speck. A failure. A man who couldn’t even keep his life together. And yet here I am, offering you salvation, and you’d rather grovel to a deity who asks for your unwavering faith and devotion but offers nothing in return?!”

I opened my eyes as he stood, towering over me as the stool was thrown to the ground. The shadows around him deepening, his eyes glowing faintly with a sinister light. “You’re wasting precious time,” he hissed, jabbing a finger at the contract on the bar. “Sign the fucking paper, Eric! Let go of this foolish hope. It’s pathetic. You think you’re strong enough to get through this without me? You’re not. You’re nothing without me.”

I raised my head, meeting his gaze. There was a calmness in me now, something steady and resolute that hadn’t been there before. Then, I felt something. It felt like a hand. A fatherly hand on my shoulder from somewhere behind me. It was firm, but most importantly, comforting. 

“If I’m nothing,” I said quietly, “then why are you so desperate?”

The stranger flinched as though struck, his eyes widening in shock. For a moment, the mask he wore slipped completely, revealing something monstrous beneath the surface. His perfectly polished exterior flickered like a bad signal, the illusion cracking and warping. “You don’t understand,” he hissed, his voice a guttural growl. “You’re throwing away everything! He doesn’t deserve your prayers. I’m the one who’s here. I’m the one offering you a way out.”

I stood, pushing the pen and parchment back toward him. “No,” I said firmly. “You’re offering chains.”

The stranger’s composure shattered. He bared his teeth, now sharp and gleaming like blades. The air around him seemed to vibrate with an unnatural energy, the shadows swirling like a living thing. “You’ll regret this,” he snarled, his voice distorted, almost unrecognizable. “You’ll come crawling back to me when you realize He’s not coming for you. And when you do, the price will be so much, much worse.”

I held my ground, meeting his gaze. “I’d rather take my chances with Him than spend a second chained to you.”

His fury exploded, a guttural roar filling the bar as the lights flickered and the shadows closed in. Then, as quickly as it began, the storm of his anger subsided. He straightened his suit, the edges of his form flickering one last time before solidifying.

“This isn’t over, Eric,” he growled, his voice low and venomous. And then, with a sharp snap, he vanished, leaving behind the pen and parchment.

The storm outside had stopped. I looked down at the bar, at the empty glass in front of me, and for the first time all day, I felt something stir inside me…hope.",2,1732749308.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I’m 19 years old and have a group of 5 friends. We’ve known each other since high school, and usually, we all get along. Then there’s Nessie.

She’s never liked me, and I’ve never liked her, but at the time, I wasn’t going to stop hanging out with my “friends” because of her.

I don’t know why Nessie dislikes me, but I can tell you why I dislike her. When it became trendy to dye your hair in bright colors, I dyed mine blue, and so did she. I’m not claiming I invented the color blue, but there were plenty of other colors to choose from why blue?

We were never Facebook friends, but Jenny sent me pictures of Nessie copying some of my photos, even posing in the same angles. In some, she even wore similar-colored clothes. At first, I thought it was funny that she was imitating me.

Then I started to dislike her when she began posting the same things I posted on my stories. I uploaded a picture of my coffee on Snapchat, and a few hours later, she did too. I posted a picture of my nails, and she did the same.

I told my friends that Nessie was weird and creepy. Jenny said that nails and coffee are things everyone does, even her. The others basically said it was “just a trend.”

She had a pretty smile, and I didn’t. I got braces, and that’s when my friends started believing me about Nessie copying me because Nessie got braces too.

They talked to her, and she denied everything. She said she also needed braces and told me that the world doesn’t revolve around me and those kinds of excuses.

We already had disputes about birthdays. My birthday and hers usually fall on weekdays, so we’d argue about which weekend to celebrate. Since my birthday is first, I’d usually get the first weekend by default, but Nessie wanted it too. To keep the peace for my “friends,” we’d negotiate. That’s how it’s been for the last 5 years.

Now, this year, by cosmic chance, my birthday falls on a weekend. Nessie wants me to move my celebration to the following weekend and give up the date. I told her absolutely not. She started pulling the “poor me, nobody loves me” card, and I still said no.

This is the one weekend I’ve been waiting for, and I’m not giving it up. I’m tired of Nessie. I’ve already skipped plans with my friends just to avoid her.

I’m not giving up my birthday for someone who could easily celebrate hers the following weekend like she always has.

I sent a group message telling them that if they didn’t come to my birthday, they could consider themselves no longer my friends not just for the birthday but forever.

Josh said I couldn’t be so extreme over a birthday. I blocked him without replying.

Jenny, my so-called best friend, said she’d go to Nessie’s birthday first and then mine. I blocked her too without replying.

She texted me from her sister’s phone, asking, “Are you serious?” I didn’t respond. Instead, I gathered everything she had at my house and all the gifts she’d ever given me, left them at her doorstep, and sent her a picture with the caption, “Bye.”

She came to my house, but I didn’t answer the door.

Samantha and I have classes together, so it’s been tense. She eventually brought it up, saying that Nessie could be annoying sometimes but wasn’t a bad person and didn’t act maliciously. She said it wasn’t fair to put her in the middle of something that didn’t directly involve her. I told her not to worry, that she’d already made her choice, and I walked away. Then I blocked her everywhere.

Nick said he understood my side and would come to my birthday, but he thought it was a shame the group was falling apart because I didn’t want to compromise like I used to. I told him I was 14 back then, and things have changed.

Lili said she’d come to my birthday without any problems.

My cousin says I can’t just block people because they disagree with me. I’m thinking about blocking her too. Haha, not joking.

I feel like I need people who give me the same amount of support I give them. If they’re not going to be there for me when I need them, I don’t want to waste more time with them.

Do you think I’m asking for too much? Am I a bad person for putting them in this situation?",3,1732748821.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

Matched with a 49f online several weeks ago. We chatted for a while and met for coffee about a month ago. We hit it off and have gone on several dates the last of which was me cooking her dinner at my place last Tuesday. We talked and watched a movie, made out a little. Had a great time. 

I took my kids on a planned trip to Florida over the weekend. I told her I’d be in touch throughout the trip via text and I want to see her when I get back. She responded positively to this. 

Long story short, I kept my word and texted her a couple of times. She only responded once saying she had been helping her elderly parents over the weekend etc. I totally understand that and let her know. I texted her last night (our final night in Florida) and have yet to hear back. 

My question is, how long do I wait around for a response? Is this some kind of shit test? Do I reach out again? If so, how do I not come across as needy or butthurt?",2,1732748559.0,dating,5,1.0,False

So a little background I woke up had a cup of coffee (ya know normal beginning of the day stuff) then my brother all of the sudden started talking about the political subject (Men competing in women’s sports) me and my dad said the stuff you normally hear “women are built differently then men, so it’s not really fair”.

And then my dad talked about the navy seal MMA fighter who was once a man but transitioned into a woman (my brother kept correcting him when he was saying that he was a dude though that’s revisionist history), then I told him also that correcting him when talking about the past is revisionist history.

And then he yelled that we’re “Fucking Assholes” which hurt me a little and my dad so I told him later why I don’t like these discussions and they make me deeply uncomfortable, and then told him would he like it if I made him hurt like that.

I might’ve been a little too hard, like I get l that you want to respect trans people, but like I do to so does my dad but we just spoke our opinions and you yelled at us….
