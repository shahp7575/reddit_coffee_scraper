My latest fascination has been trying to weave some subtle **literary gothic** elements into a genuinely wearable daytime look. The goal: less ""haunted manor resident"" and more ""thoughtful individual with excellent taste in dusty books."" It's a tricky balance, and frankly, my first few attempts veered hard into ""too much"" territory.

Here's a breakdown of what finally clicked for me after a good bit of trial and error:

*   **The Vibe:** Soft literary gothic, inspired by Victorian novels and dark academia aesthetics, but adapted for a casual Tuesday. Think muted drama, not full-on theatrics.
*   **Key Products & Techniques:**
    *   **Base:** Instead of heavy, stark foundation, I went for a medium-coverage skin tint (I used **NYX Bare With Me Blur Tint** in 'Pale') applied thinly, followed by a light dusting of setting powder. The aim was to even tone without completely masking my skin. *Price point: drugstore.*
    *   **Eyes:** This was the make-or-break. I skipped intense black liner and instead reached for a deep, smoky plum eyeshadow (specifically, a shade from the **Colourpop 'That's Taupe' palette** – ironically, a purple-grey).
        *   I applied it softly along the upper lash line, then smudged it out with a small brush for a diffused, almost 'lived-in' look.
        *   A touch of the same shade was lightly applied to the lower lash line and blended well to avoid harsh lines.
        *   Finished with a couple of coats of a lengthening mascara (like **L'Oréal Telescopic**). *Price point: drugstore/affordable indie.*
    *   **Cheeks:** A very subtle application of a cool-toned contour powder (e.g., **ELF Putty Bronzer in 'Feelin' Shady'**) just under the cheekbones to add a touch of structure without warmth. No blush. *Price point: drugstore.*
    *   **Lips:** The trick was finding a berry shade that wasn't too bright or too vampy. I went with a blotted liquid lipstick (my current favorite for this is **Maybelline Superstay Matte Ink in 'Composer'**) applied with a fingertip and then dabbed off with a tissue. This gives a soft, stained effect that feels understated yet intentional. *Price point: drugstore.*
*   **Time Invested:** Once I got the hang of it, this look took about **15-20 minutes**. The smudged eyeshadow is forgiving, which helps!

**Real Talk & Lessons Learned:**

My first try with this concept involved a much darker eye, a stronger lip, and a foundation that was a bit too pale. I looked less ""subtly moody"" and more ""ready for a graveyard photoshoot."" The biggest lesson was learning to *pull back* – especially with the eyes. Instead of packing on color, diffusing it and using a softer shade made all the difference. Also, choosing a lip that was more of a stain than a full opaque color kept it from overpowering the rest of the face. It definitely took a few attempts in front of the mirror, wiping things off and trying again, to get to this point. I was genuinely surprised how much of a difference a *blotted* lip could make in transforming a look from evening-appropriate to daytime-friendly.

1qs6gbs,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1qs6gbs/my_mom_and_1_of_my_sisters_are_in_cahoots_again/,"my mom and (1 of) my sisters are in cahoots again and moving weird, wdid.","I, 15F, am the oldest daughter out of seven siblings and while the situation I’m currently going through is potentially minor, I need advice on how I should approach this situation.

For context of my current environment, there’s a lot that I just can’t do (e.g. going places, work, drive, purchasing) and the city me and my family live in is no help. The schools do not make it any better, as they genuinely make things worse. We also do not have any family here, and we’ve moved a good amount of times so that now I do not have any friends or reliable associates I can communicate with or talk to about things like this.

That being said, I think that my mom, 38F, and my sister, 14F, are moving sketchily again. The reason I say again is because this has been a reoccurring thing where my sisters are may begin to feel some kind of way and then it quietly puts me on a back burner until further notice.

Previously, they’ve pushed me away like this but then when they stop pushing me away they feel like it’s my fault for becoming distant and when I did muster up the courage to tell them what they’re doing makes me feel unwanted, my mom began crying and saying how it hurts her feelings that I felt that way, but even then made no attempt in trying to fix it. For example, back when I was maybe 11 and 12, we stayed with my Nana and I consistently tried to give both of them hugs to which they both pushed me away. Now, I don’t want to be touched, and just two years ago made that clear when she tried to forcefully corner me and hug me. I didn’t hug her back.

There have also been many points in time where my mom specifically broke my trust, blatantly said she wouldn’t apologize, and still expect me to stay. And to my default, I have no where else to go…so I did what any other child would did when they see “love” flashing in faux material.

The rerun of both my mom and my sister’s actions against me, started a couple of weeks back before my papa fell ill (my grandfather, I mean, which has an even worse effect on how things transpire). My sister tried to force me and \[one of my other sisters who is close in age\] upstairs, claiming that it was because we “had school”, but get real. I am a teenager who can’t sleep, even on the pills, and even those I take in moderation. 

But because she’s unbearably controlling, I went to bed, and the other sister I mentioned followed suit. All for not even 15 Minutes later, my sister and our mom downstairs, watching television and laughing it up.

After this, the small remarks begin.

It’s the “whatever you say.” It’s the “you can’t do….” It’s the constant correction or doubt that I can do anything. It’s the “Oh, this dish is dirty” (dishes are my chore) and proceeds to put a spotless coffee cup back inside of the sink. It’s the talking to me like I’m a baby even though I’ve explicitly told mom that I don’t like this, nor do I like to control people or be controlled in this manner, it’s not cool and it grates at my skin.

I can’t even help out with the kids without being told that I’m disagreed with in some way and then when I don’t try to help she complains that she’s the only one ever doing anything.

She doesn’t get in trouble for these things, in fact, it’s endorsed. My mom laughs at it, and then when I start correcting and begin telling her off—“It’s the end times, you two are arguing over bullshit.” 

And to be real, no, I do not cook anymore. I used to love to cook and bake, now my sister does that because she wanted to. My chore was to do dishes, but she made it a big deal to me that I wasn’t doing my job the correct way, or commenting on how slowly I do it. Or whenever she got tired of “waiting” she’ll get up and tell me to get out and say stuff like, “Now, watch how I get it done in less than 25 minutes.” Boasting, as per usual.

When, I try to explain anything, or tell her what’s holding me off (after she barks out orders by the millisecond) she screams at me and tells me that I am talking back and that she has bigger problems than just me.

What really began to rub me in the wrong way was is how the last time me and mom were having a genuine conversation, my sister got mad and stormed off upstairs after mom “ignored her” while mom was clearly talking to me. After mom asked me where she was, I told her, “Went upstairs because she’s mad at you because she thinks you are ignoring her.” 

My mom calls her and starts driving her, but “good-naturedly” and in my sister’s defense I “jokingly” tell my mom to stop driving her and that they’re both being difficult. My sister turns around and stands right to the side of my mom but looks her dead in her face while I’m sitting there, and expresses how mom was able to talk to me but completely ignore her when she was talking.

And then ironically, I am the one who is now being ignored because of it. First slowly, and now completely.

Personally, because of most of the rest of the kids—I don’t ever get a chance to spend time with mom without making someone else feel some kind of way. 

This has also been the same way with the men my mom used to date, where I would be side-lined, or disliked by those men in defense of my mom. I’ve still been humiliated, accused, and considered last in my opinion, even though my mom says that my opinion comes first.

After that incident (my sister accusing my mom of ignoring her), mom and my sister have been closer. To the point where my sister’s every move is being praised, and she is deliberately choosing not to acknowledge any of the attempts of help that I’ve made. Then always saying I’m always on my iPad or am always distant or too independent and that’s why I don’t receive as much attention as the other kids, but what the hell am I supposed to do? We don’t have anything.

Then mom keeps sending me to my room over small shit. Another example, my sister got mad at the other sister I mentioned earlier and I had backed her up by saying that it was true, and she didn’t ever have her door open unless mine was because my room is right across from hers. Everyone got yelled at and sent to their rooms and I apologized to my sister because mom made it seem like everyone was ganging up on her, and I genuinely apologized but still got sent to my room. Or how she (sister) calls the kids stupid and dumb, but one remark from me about saying “You guys aren’t stupid,” after they continuously tried to act illiterate because they thought it was cool, I got in trouble and cussed out and told to stop saying it.

As far as everything else, they also keep demeaning everything about me. This includes my struggles, only to shine limelight on my sister and make her seem like a martyr. When my mom and sister were up, I was tossing and turning as well, but out of reverence for both of them, I stayed where I was so my sister wouldnt think I was intruding in on her and mom’s “time together.” They kept talking about us moving again, but no longer show me any of the houses or include me in any of the topics. And they’ve also made it their mission to tell my nana and themselves that I don’t do anything, I’m always in room, and told the kids that I don’t not care about our papa (grandfather, who is currently in the hospital).

I can garuntee a rats ass that they are going to blame it on me being distant, always having my headphones, or my iPad, but we can’t do anything because we don’t have anything. They’re constantly watching tv or on phones too, but it’s a problem when I do it because they don’t like when I wear my headphones and try to force me to leave one out even though when I speak to them they almost don’t acknowledge me at all.

I don’t know. I feel terrible for even feeling this envious or enraged when things with Papa are going on and it doesn’t help that even now currently, I’m sitting in this room. Am I in the wrong? How am I supposed to approach this situation head-on, instead of just playing Rapunzel (being isolated in my room) all day long? Any advice helps.",1,1769876075.0,whatdoIdo,0,1.0,False

The rain in London was a persistent, gray curtain. Elara, a junior archivist with ink-stained fingers and a heart guarded by old books, stood shivering under the narrow awning of a café. She had forgotten her umbrella—again. Her life was a comfortable, predictable loop of tube rides, dusty manuscripts, and quiet evenings in her small flat. Romance was something she catalogued in 19th-century letters, not something she expected to find on a Tuesday afternoon.



A deep voice cut through the drumming rain. “It seems we’re both prisoners of the weather.”



She turned. A man stood beside her, holding a large, cobalt-blue umbrella. He had kind eyes that crinkled at the corners and a smile that felt like a sudden patch of sunlight. He was tall, dressed in a rumpled trench coat, with a leather satchel slung over his shoulder.



“My knight in a waterproof armour?” Elara quipped, surprising herself with her boldness.



He laughed. “Leo. And my castle is just across the street. Can I offer a temporary pardon?” He extended the umbrella over her.



That five-minute walk, huddled under the blue dome, listening to the rain patter a new rhythm on the fabric, was the first deviation from her loop. By the time they reached her bus stop, the rain had slowed to a drizzle, but the conversation hadn’t. When her bus arrived, Leo handed her the umbrella.



“You’ll need it more than I will,” he said. “Find me at The Pen & Page bookstore tomorrow to return it?”



Elara, clutching the umbrella handle still warm from his grip, could only nod. As the bus pulled away, she watched him wave, a solitary figure in the softening rain, and felt the first crack in the walls around her heart.



\## \*\*Chapter 2: The Bookstore and the Baker\*\*

The Pen & Page was a labyrinth of towering shelves and the scent of old paper. Elara found Leo not browsing, but behind the counter, deftly repairing a spine with bookbinding glue. He wasn’t just a customer; he was the owner.



“You’re full of surprises,” she said, placing the umbrella on the counter.



“So are you,” he replied, wiping his hands on a cloth. “Elara, the archivist who can decipher Gothic script but can’t remember an umbrella.” He’d remembered her name, her job. He offered her a tour, pointing out hidden nooks and his favourite first editions. Their connection, sparked in the rain, began to smoulder in the quiet aisles. He was passionate about stories, not just selling them, and he listened to her talk about her work with a genuine, captivated interest.



Their first official date was at a tiny French patisserie. Leo, it turned out, was also a spectacularly bad but enthusiastic baker. He brought two slightly lopsided but delicious almond croissants he’d attempted that morning. “I wanted to bring you something I made,” he admitted, a faint blush on his cheeks. “It’s a bit of a disaster, but it’s honest.”



Elara took a bite. It was perfect. In that moment, over flaky pastry and terrible coffee, she realized she wasn’t just falling for a charming man with an umbrella. She was falling for his kindness, his quiet passion, and his wonderfully imperfect croissants.



\## \*\*Chapter 3: Whispers of the Past\*\*

As spring blossomed, so did their relationship. They explored hidden London gardens, shared picnics in Regent’s Park, and spent hours in his bookstore or her archive. But Elara carried a quiet sorrow. One evening, as they walked along the Thames, she finally shared it: her mother’s long illness and passing two years prior, which had left her emotionally withdrawn, afraid to love something she could lose.



Leo didn’t offer empty platitudes. He simply took her hand and said, “Grief is just love with no place to go. It doesn’t mean you stop loving; it means you learn to redirect it.” He shared his own story—his dream of the bookstore almost failing in its first year, the loneliness of building something alone. Their vulnerabilities, shared under the amber streetlights, became a new layer of intimacy, a mutual promise of safety.



\## \*\*Chapter 4: The Storm Before the Calm\*\*

The first test came with the Summer Book Fair, a make-or-break event for Leo’s shop. Stress turned him distant and preoccupied. Elara, feeling shut out, misinterpreted his silence as regret. A small misunderstanding over a missed dinner escalated into their first argument—a tense, painful exchange of frustrated words in the cluttered back office of the bookstore.



“I just need to focus, Elara!” he finally said, running a hand through his hair.



“And I need to feel like I’m not just another item on your to-do list!” she retorted, hurt.



They parted that night with a cold silence. Elara walked home feeling the familiar ache of loss, believing their beautiful story was already ending.



\## \*\*Chapter 5: The First Edition\*\*

For two days, the silence was a physical weight. Then, a parcel arrived for Elara at the archive. Inside was a first edition of \*Persuasion\* by Jane Austen, her favourite novel. Tucked in the pages was a note in Leo’s distinctive handwriting:



\*“Elara, I’m an idiot. The shop is my dream, but you are my heart. In this book, Anne Elliot gets a second chance at love. I am begging you, on my knees (metaphorically, the floor is dusty), for ours. Meet me at the bridge where we talked about the past? Tonight, 7 PM. I’ll be the one with the blue umbrella, just in case. – Leo”\*



Tears welled in her eyes. He had remembered.



\## \*\*Chapter 6: The Bridge and the Promise\*\*

He was there, umbrella in hand, under the same ironwork bridge. The apology was in his eyes before he spoke. They talked, really talked, about fear, pressure, and communication. Leo promised to let her in, even during the storms. Elara promised to voice her fears instead of letting them fester.



“I love you,” Leo said, the words simple and sure in the evening air. It was the first time either had said it.



“I love you too,” Elara whispered back, the words lifting the last of the sorrow from her heart. They sealed the promise with a kiss that tasted of rain, forgiveness, and a future written together.



\## \*\*Chapter 7: Weaving Lives\*\*

Their lives began to knit together seamlessly. Elara helped plan the book fair (a roaring success). Leo built a special shelf in the shop for “Archivist’s Picks.” He had a key to her flat; she had a favourite chair in his bookstore office. They navigated the mundane—groceries, laundry, a leaky tap—and found joy in it, because they were doing it together. Love was no longer a dramatic event; it was the quiet peace of a shared Sunday morning, the comfort of a known presence.



\## \*\*Chapter 8: The Unexpected Question\*\*

It happened on a random Thursday. They were in the bookstore after hours, dusting shelves. Leo was reading aloud a terribly romantic passage from a dusty novel, making her laugh. He suddenly stopped, put the book down, and got down on one knee, not on the dusty floor, but on a small, clean rug he’d seemingly placed there earlier.



“Elara,” he said, his voice thick with emotion. “My story was good before. But with you, it’s my masterpiece. Will you marry me? Will you be my partner in every chapter to come?”



There was no ring box. Instead, he held out a delicate, antique key on a chain. “To the bookstore,” he explained. “It’s been my heart. Now I want you to have the key to it. A ring is coming, but this felt right first.”



Through joyful tears, Elara said “Yes” a hundred times before he even finished. He fastened the chain around her neck, the cool metal a permanent, precious weight over her heart.



\## \*\*Chapter 9: The Two Suitcases\*\*

The wedding was small and perfect, held in the bookstore, surrounded by the stories that had brought them together. After a honeymoon in the Scottish Highlands, they returned to their new life. The final step was Elara moving her belongings into the flat above the bookstore. As she packed the last box in her old flat, she came across her mother’s jewellery box. Inside, under a simple necklace, was a note: “For my darling girl. May you find a love that makes you feel as treasured as you have always made me feel.”



Sobbing and smiling, Elara realized her mother’s love had never left; it had simply been waiting to guide her to this moment, to Leo. She wasn’t leaving her past behind; she was bringing its greatest blessing with her into her future.



\## \*\*Chapter 10: The Epilogue: A New Shelf\*\*

Five years later. The bell on the door of \*The Pen & Page\* jingled. A little girl with Leo’s eyes and Elara’s curly hair toddled down the central aisle, followed by her smiling parents.



“Papa, story!” she demanded, pointing a chubby finger.



Leo scooped her up. “Of course, my little bookmark.” He carried her to a special, low shelf they had built together. It was labelled “Our Story.” On it sat a few items: a faded, repaired blue umbrella in a stand. A framed photo of a lopsided croissant. The key on its chain, now resting beside a wedding band. A first edition of \*Persuasion\*. And at the end, a new, blank, beautiful leather journal.



Elara wrapped her arms around them both, resting her head on Leo’s shoulder. The rain pattered gently against the window. Her life was no longer a predictable loop, but an expansive, beautiful, and ever-growing story. She had found love not in a grand gesture, but in a shared umbrella, a bad croissant, and the quiet, steadfast promise of a shared tomorrow. Their story was still being written, one ordinary, extraordinary day at a time, and every chapter began and ended with love.",1,1769875956.0,u_Alternative_Low_1007,0,1.0,False

1qs69fj,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1qs69fj/afterlife_death/,Afterlife Death,"“This can’t be right,” I said, my eyes glued to my iMac, my coffee-lifting arm frozen midair. I was in the study, wherein I’d spent the better part of a month scrutinizing job listings, afore a desktop buried under bite-sized candy bar wrappers.

 

“What can’t be right?” asked my wife, Beatrice, from just over my shoulder. Since my layoff, her pretty face had sprouted three new wrinkles—deep ones—and her incessant nagging was the only thing keeping me from the couch, from watching ESPN until my eyes bled. Her job as a telecom sales rep barely covered her wardrobe requirements, after all, and our savings would only stretch so far before we lost the house. 

 

“This listing. No way can it be legitimate.”

 

“What’s it say?”

 

I swiveled in my seat, to stare into those chestnut-colored eyes of hers. It seemed that she’d been crying. Anxiously, she finger-scrunched her black bob cut. 

 

“It says that the research and development division of some company—Investutech, I guess it’s called—will pay $10,000 to anyone who lets the company claim their body after death.”

 

“So they pay you now, even though it might take you decades to die?”

 

“It appears so.”

 

Softly laughing, she shook her skeptical head. “Yeah, that’s *gotta be* a scam. But then again, it can’t hurt to call the number.”

 

“You’re serious? You want me to call these guys?” 

 

Before I could blink, Beatrice had the phone in my hand.  

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Investutech’s R&D facility epitomized modern architecture: a massive cube of steel and glass, unadorned and soulless. In its lobby, I met Dr. Vern Landon, Lab Supervisor. A short, bald fellow disappearing into his own liver spots, the good doctor shook my hand as if attempting to crush a spider between our palms.

 

“Thanks for coming down,” he said. “I know we’re somewhat off the beaten path, but that’s how corporate prefers it.”

 

“It’s no problem.”

 

“You’re here about the Internet listing, I understand.”

 

“Yeah…it’s some kind of scam, right?”

 

“Quite the opposite, my friend. At this establishment, we seek nothing less than world-shattering scientific innovation. In this pursuit, we use every tool obtainable, even the dead ones. To those of a scientific bent, a fresh corpse offers a cornucopia of potential knowledge.”

 

“Huh?”

 

“Some experiments are too risky to use a living human as a test subject, and lab monkeys don’t always cut the mustard. Perhaps you’d like an example. Well, when developing a medical device, we can insert it into a deceased man or woman to ensure that everything fits where it’s supposed to. We also harvest organs for tissue engineering projects.”

 

“Tissue engineering?”

 

“Yeah, buddy. Right now, we’re learning to create artificial and bioartificial organs for patients awaiting transplants. We also use cadavers in all sorts of genetic engineering projects.”  

 

Gently gripping my arm, Dr. Landon herded me down the corridor. “Come along now,” he said. “I’ll give you the grand tour.”

 

We passed a cafeteria, wherein a handful of sad-faced individuals in lab coats sat at Formica tables, silently consuming their lunches. As we walked, my guide began orating:

 

“Investutech is the number one innovator in a wide range of fields—from mainstream consumer technology to the wildest of fringe sciences. In fact, there are facilities like this spread all across the United States, answerable only to Investutech’s board of directors. At this location alone, we have laboratories dedicated not only to biomedical engineering, but also to physics, biology, and even psychology. We are engaged in many exciting projects here, which I’m unfortunately unable to speak of. Here’s the elevator. Why don’t we hop aboard?”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

While I didn’t get the whole run of the facility, I saw enough to be suitably impressed. Many doors were closed to us, requiring security clearance denied to visitors. I did, however, get to see a particle accelerator, located in an extensive, circular tunnel beneath the facility. The device’s beam pipe resembled something from a sci-fi flick, as if light cycle races could take place inside it. Naturally, I requested to see the thing in action—propelling particles at nearly the speed of light—but the doctor assured me it wasn’t possible.

 

The labs I visited were practically identical: workbenches and cabinets, sinks and tables, notebooks filled with incomprehensible jottings. In some corners, I saw containers marked with radioactive waste tags. 

 

In one laboratory, I was introduced to the jubilant Dr. Hegseth. Rotund and mottled, the man handed me a pill bottle labeled *6/7.9*. 

 

“What’s this?” I asked.

 

“Have you ever gone to the movies after getting good and smashed at the nearest bar?” 

 

“Why, yes, I suppose I have.”

 

“It’s great, isn’t it? In fact, the practice has gotten me through many an evening with the missus. The only drawback is the inevitable bathroom break, during which you could be missing the movie’s best scenes.”

 

“Yeah…what’s your point?”

 

“Well, each of those pills affects your system like a six-pack of strong beer. You can get as drunk as you like and never have to pee once. Pop a pill or two and you’re ready to sit through even the most insipid romantic comedy. Best of all, you won’t be burning off your date’s eyelashes with a blast of dragon breath.”

 

Thinking it over, I had to admit that the innovation intrigued me. 

 

“Keep the bottle,” Dr. Hegseth said. “They hit the market next month.”

 

Dr. Landon led me further down the corridor. Passing a number of simulation-running supercomputers, we arrived at the psychologists’ labs: austere rooms featuring one-way mirrors and hidden cameras, allowing one to observe the behavior of human test subjects. Only one room was occupied. Imagine my surprise when Dr. Landon whipped out his security card and ushered me inside it.

 

In one corner of the room, sitting with his knees pressing his chest, was a bearded man in a hockey jersey and soiled blue jeans. He stared without seeing, rarely blinking, spittle spilling from his mouth corners. *Does he even register my presence?* I wondered. For a moment, his face seemed to contort into a terror mask…but then his mouth slackened again, and I had to wonder if I’d imagined the expression change. 

 

“This is Ruben,” my guide informed me. “He’s the last of our Nonlinears.”

 

“Nonlinears?” I asked.

 

“How can I explain this to you? Basically, our brains are filled with these cells called neurons—around 100 billion of them, supposedly—which process and transmit information all day long. Each neuron is electrochemically linked to at least 20,000 other neurons, sending and receiving signals through synapse connections. If not for them, our minds wouldn’t function properly.

 

“With the Nonlinears, we did a little brain tinkering, blasting their temporal lobes with intense dopamine bombardments to unlink the neurons associated with linear time perception. We weren’t sure what would happen, but the results defied all hypotheses.”

 

“What happened?” I asked, astounded.

 

“We discovered that by unlinking these selected neurons, we altered their time perception beyond anything we could’ve imagined. In fact, the tragic bastards ended up living every moment of their lives from that point onward simultaneously, all the way up to their deaths.”

 

“That’s amazing.”

 

“You’d think so, but experiencing a lifetime of sensations all at once is too much for *anyone* to process. That’s why Ruben doesn’t move. We feed him and clean him because he’s trying to do as little as possible, to limit his movement and sensations to a manageable level. He’ll likely remain that way until he expires, the poor guy.”

 

“So, what happened to the rest of the Nonlinears?”

 

“Some had immediate heart attacks, the sensation onslaught being too intense for their autonomic nervous systems. Some succumbed to brain aneurisms. The rest committed suicide in the most gruesome way imaginable, bashing their heads against the walls until their skulls caved in.”

 

“Good lord.”

 

“Only Ruben had the foresight to claim a corner for his own. Who knows what’s happening in that manic brain of his? Every communication attempt has been a failure thus far, just like the experiment itself.” 

 

The doctor ushered me out. “Well, that about concludes the tour. I could show you the bacteriology and virology labs, but you’d have to put on a biocontaminant suit before entering, and then take a chemical shower, followed by a regular shower, before leaving. It’s not worth the effort, trust me.”

 

“No problem. My mind’s blown already.”  

 

“Of course it is,” he chuckled. “So…have you made a decision? You’ve seen what we do here. Will you sell us your corpse?”

 

“For ten grand, it’s a no brainer,” I replied.

 

“Great! Step into my office and we’ll fill out all of the necessary paperwork. We’ll cut you a check and let you get back to your life.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Two weeks later, my wife and I were eating portabello tatin at a quaint French bistro. Sucking down Pierre Ponnelle Pinot Noir by the glassful, we contemplated a getaway cruise to the Bahamas. 

 

The check had cleared, and life was grand. No longer did we argue about money; no longer did I power through bags of miniature candy bars at my desk, searching in vain for a job that never existed. The ten grand would run out eventually, but until then I wasn’t going to let life get me down.

 

My wife made a joke. Laughing uproariously, I accidentally knocked over my wine. Dabbing it up with a napkin, I regretted popping a *6/7.9* pill before dinner, which had left me buzzed immaculate, just a stone’s throw away from drunk. I didn’t want to embarrass Beatrice, not when things were going so well. 

 

Neither of us desired dessert, so with our plates mostly emptied, I signaled for the check. Tipping the waiter a magnanimous twenty-five percent, I took my wife by the elbow and escorted her from the restaurant, into the sun-drenched day. There was a park across the street, a grass field framed with benches, containing no less than twelve picnic tables. To prolong our love’s rekindling, I suggested that we grab a bench, to watch a Hispanic family play croquet. 

 

“That sounds nice, dear,” Beatrice cooed, giving my hand a tender squeeze. I felt a decade younger, like it was our first date all over again, and it was going better than I’d hoped for. When the little green man appeared at the other end of the crosswalk, we strode forward leisurely, eyeing each other, not the surrounding traffic. 

 

Just as we passed the median strip, tragedy struck. At the sound of a horn blare, I glanced up to see a green Chevy Nova flying down the left-hand turn lane. Perhaps its bug-eyed driver hadn’t noticed the red light, or perhaps he didn’t care. Either way, I had just enough time to push my wife behind me, just enough time to brace for impact. With a great crumpling, I found myself ground under the vehicle’s polished metal grille.

 

I felt my bones grind and splinter, my liver burst. Drowning on lifeblood, I watched the world cloud over. Dying, I tried to speak Beatrice’s name, succeeding only in vomiting blood and bile onto the asphalt. 

 

Then I was gone, breeze-borne into oblivion. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

When next my eyes opened, I beheld neither Heaven nor Hell—no harp-strumming angels, no demons cavorting around a lake of fire. Instead, I found myself strapped to a metal table in one of Investutech’s psychology labs, with a shorthaired Asian American doctor attempting to blind me with a penlight. 

 

“He’s awake, Dr. Landon,” the man announced.

 

In the background stood my erstwhile tour guide—smiling benevolently, sweat beads dotting his brow. “Welcome back, my friend,” he said. “I trust that you remember me.”

 

“Whaaa…haaapened?” I wheezed, my voice like a broken lawnmower. My skin was cold. I felt metal rods inside of me, where my bones had been. My outfit consisted of a hospital gown over thick layers of bandages. Even without drugs, there was no discomfort. It was like all of my pain receptors had been switched off. 

 

“There’s no other way to tell you but to leap right in,” said Landon, struggling for a soothing tone. “You were run over by a car in the middle of an intersection. You pushed your wife to safety, but lost your life in the process. In fact, your funeral started five minutes ago. They’re burying an empty coffin, however, as you signed your body over to us.”

 

“Youuu…brought meee baack.”

 

“We sure did. In fact, you’ve become the culmination of all our work at this facility. Most of your organs were ruined, so our tissue engineering division grew you new ones. A good portion of your skeleton was shattered, so we grafted steel bones into your physique. After that, with a strenuous application of galvanism, we actually brought the life spark back to your body. Your heart’s beating, and your neurons fire again. Now, if we can just figure out a way to stop the decay process, you’ll be good as new. You may even return to your wife someday.”

 

“Ah’m decaaaying?”

 

“Unfortunately, yes. It seems that your body doesn’t realize that it’s alive again. But our biomedical engineers are on the case, positing thermoregulation strategies even now. They should have your body generating heat again in no time.” 

 

“Whaaas wrong wiith my voiiiice?”

 

“Well, my friend, you did crack your head pretty hard on that crosswalk. Obviously, the trauma affected your brain’s language center. Once we stop the decay, perhaps we’ll look into repairing it.”

 

“Whyee am I straaapped doown?”

 

“Oh, that’s just a precaution. We’ve never tried something like this before, and had no idea what you’d be like upon waking. Dr. Lee, free our guest from his bonds, will you?”

 

The doctor did as instructed, allowing me to test my reflexes. They seemed unnaturally slow, as if the connection between my mind and musculature was on a time delay. After what felt like an hour, I *finally* slid my legs over the table and lurched to standing.

 

“Steady, steady,” Dr. Lee cautioned. “We don’t want you toppling over.”

 

Attempting to walk, I found my legs insensible. Indeed, I toppled forward. Fortunately, Dr. Lee was kind enough to catch me. 

 

“I warned you about that,” he grumbled, straining to brace me up. “Next time, we’ll…arggh!”

 

His screams were deafening. Groggily, I realized the source of his discomfort. For some reason, my body—operating on pure instinct—had me biting deep into Lee’s neck, gnawing frantically, my mouth filling with arterial blood. I was repulsed, yet couldn’t stop myself. A powerful appetite suffused me; it seemed it would never abate. 

 

Eventually, Lee’s screams faded. Landon tugged the corpse from my grip and I lurched in pursuit, tripping into a face plant. Losing consciousness, I heard the door slam behind them, locking me in my cell. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

For a while, I lurked in solitude, though I sensed observers just beyond the one-way glass. Time lost all meaning, as I no longer required sleep. Though I drank nothing, I felt no thirst, only that damnable hunger, that yearning for human flesh.   

 

With no entertainment options, I spent my time relearning to walk. It was more of a shamble, actually, as my knees refused to bend. Afterwards, I watched my body putrefy. 

 

First, my lower abdomen turned green. Then, in an embarrassing display, every bodily fluid, every bit of fecal matter, poured out of me. My face swelled balloonlike: mouth, lips, and tongue practically bursting. The swelling made even slurred speech impossible, garbling my every vocalization into soft moaning. 

 

My veins sprouted red tendrils, which later went green. Blisters erupted everywhere, suppurating pale, yellow fluid. Even my skin and hair began sloughing away. I won’t even mention the smell.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

When Dr. Landon finally reappeared, this time flanked by two armed guards, I was in full-on undead mode. Landon offered no reaction to my appearance, but his eyes were sad. Gone was the jovial tour guide I remembered, replaced by a man who looked two decades older. Nauseous, the guards squinted at me, Glock 22s at the ready.

 

“Guuuuuhhhh,” I said, the best salutation I could manage under the circumstances. 

 

“Guh right back,” replied Landon. He hesitated for a moment, his face slackening sorrowfully. Regaining his composure, he said, “Well…I have some bad news, buddy. Because you slaughtered Dr. Lee, no scientist will go near you. This means that all efforts to stop, and even reverse, your decay have been suspended. In fact, Investutech’s board of directors has proposed returning you to the grave, allowing us to study your brain postmortem. Hopefully, we’ll be able to identify what prompted your blood lust and correct it before our next test subject arrives.”

 

“Nnnnnn.”

 

“I’m sorry, but that’s the situation. The final decision has yet to arrive, but I wouldn’t get your hopes up. The next time we enter your cell, it’ll most likely be to put you down. If it’s any consolation, though, your wife knows nothing of this. To her, you’ve been dead all this time. If Beatrice saw you now, who knows what it would do to her?”

 

The doctor’s practiced indifference disintegrated, as hoarse sobs burst through his quivering lips. Spilling tears, he exited the room, with both escorts trailing behind him. “I’m so sorry!” Landon called back, just before the door closed.

 

Starving and depressed, I threw myself from wall to wall. *I should’ve eaten all three of them when I had the chance*, I reasoned. *I’m already deadish. What could their guns possibly do to me?* Beneath the stained, tattered mess of my hospital gown, most of my bandages had peeled away. With every wall collision, my putrid body discharged flesh chunks, which only increased my agitation. Eventually, I collapsed, howling at the top of what was left of my lungs.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Time crawled interminably. My body dried out—darkening, acquiring a texture like cottage cheese—as its terrible death stench subsided. Internally, I visualized maggots wriggling throughout my organs, feasting on necrotic tissue. 

 

My shambling slowed, every step now a struggle. I have no idea what kept me ambulatory, kept my tormented spirit inside its moldering frame. Perhaps dark sorcery was involved.

 

Finally, Dr. Landon reappeared, accompanied by four guards this time, all with weapons drawn. “Well, my boy, the end has come,” he informed me. “I’d have brought a priest to pray over your immortal soul, but lab security doesn’t permit faith-mongers. Once again, I’d like to apologize for your situation. Sometimes good intentions breed monsters; sometimes all you can do is cut your losses and try to learn from your mistakes. Goodbye, my friend.”

 

The guards opened fire, sending a bullet spray through my torso, legs and arms. Feeling no pain, I stepped forward to meet them, as fragments of my living corpse splattered the floor behind me.

 

“It’s not working!” shouted one guard—a mulleted, red-faced ginger—right before I tore his head off. 

 

“Mmmmmwwwwah,” I moaned, reveling in the blood spray, wondering where my prodigious strength came from. It almost equaled my hunger. 

 

The next guard, I ripped his gun away, along with the arm holding it. In shock, his eyes rolling back into his skull, the brawny fellow dropped to his knees. 

 

I cracked the third guard’s cranium clean open. Consuming warm blood and squishy clumps of cerebral cortex, I would’ve slobbered, had my salivary glands still been operational. 

 

Dr. Landon, grasping the situation’s severity, turned on his heels and sprinted out of the room, hooking a right down the corridor. Naturally, I gave pursuit, pausing only to disembowel the fourth guard. 

 

Bloodlust lent new strength to my shamble. Resembling a mentally disabled child skipping, I positively flew down the hall. Catching up to Landon, I found him collapsed, hand to chest, gasping with an ashen face. Before the heart attack could claim him, I dashed his brains onto the floor and began to feed. 

 

With the doctor’s corpse picked clean, I grabbed his security clearance card and went back for the guards. Not that I was still hungry, mind you, but when visiting a buffet, you expect to gorge yourself.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Sirens blared overhead. Startled, I paused, clenching a dripping tendon between my teeth. They’d be coming for me, I realized, most likely in numbers I couldn’t fight through. Still, I had Landon’s key card and a memory of a fellow detainee: Ruben, the Nonlinear.

 

Two doors down the hall, I buzzed myself in. Ruben raised his eyes as I entered. I knew that this time he was really seeing me.

 

“You’re finally here,” he said, unafraid. 

 

“Ynnnnnn,” I confirmed, closing the intervening distance. 

 

My chin slick with the blood of my captors, I leaned over the Nonlinear. As my teeth met his flesh, he had just enough time to thank me. Then came gunfire and bloodletting, great gore eruptions amid a soundtrack of shrieking. The world began dimming; a red curtain closed.",1,1769875639.0,DarkTales,0,1.0,False

That first morning coffee with a teaspoon of kratom fixes this hell for about 20 minutes. I keep wondering if the brief relief is due to unusually rapid neurotransmitter clearance or breakdown. After that, I'm in absolute anhedonic hell until around 3 p.m., when I return to my chronic routine of a six-pack of high-ABV beer.

Alcohol brings very little actual pleasure—at best, it lets me sit through a movie for twenty to thirty minutes before boredom sets in. It does make me overly chatty with a neighbor for about an hour, though it's more me being unhinged and rambling incoherent nonsense. Overall, it accelerates the day—the whole evening just seems to disappear. I've been doing this for years now, and it's really taking its toll. I don't want to continue this way. If I keep this up, I'll be dead in five to ten years.

Just got denied TMS treatment despite downplaying my drinking. They require three months of sobriety. Didn't even mention the kratom—that would have been a hard no too.

At this point, it's hard to say whether the severe depression or the anhedonia is more unbearable. I also know that until I quit drinking, I'll never see any meaningful recovery. A few months back, I could sort of tolerate my evenings sober on 400 mg of gabapentin, which gave me some minor degree of focus. But since my depression worsened this winter—due to a physical health problem getting worse—I've fallen hard back onto alcohol.

I still haven't tried MAOIs or pregabalin. Really hoping TMS ends up making a difference if I eventually get accepted. Might need a documented rehab stay at this point.",2,1769875593.0,anhedonia,3,1.0,False

Since it's food safe and has anti-fungal properties, I figured it would be good to add a small teaspoon of it to my coffee every morning as well.

For background, every morning I take L-Theanine, Taurine and NAC (also has antifungal biofilm disrupting properties) before my coffee. I then usually have a little yogurt. 

I am not on a strict candida diet, and I regularly have sugary foods, albeit not a lot of sugary foods, but I try to stay away from extremely processed carbohydrates, and I've been adding more yogurts, kefirs and fermented foods like kimchi.

After two days of adding the C8 MCT oil (Caprylic Acid) in my coffee, I noticed unusua side effects starting in the early afternoon when the coffee starts to kick in.

The side effects include:

- Extreme anxiety / feeling of dredd
- Lightheadedness
- Additional brain fog
- Extreme muscle tightness around shoulders, chest and lower back (all areas I generally have inflammatory pain)
- Increased heart rate 10-15 beats
- Slight nausea
- Stomach upset

These symptoms were not always consistent, and sometimes I'd get no symptoms at all. So I just chalked it up to anxiety.

Though, recently I had a colonoscopy and the prep really cleaned me out. It seemed like I may have been removing a lot of the built-up biofilm deep within me.

After the colonoscopy, I started feeling all these symptoms at once and they were extreme. Especially the feeling of deep dredd, anxiety and muscle pain. The chest pain sometimes almost feels like I'm going to have a heart attack but my vitals seemed fine and I recover after 1 hour at most. After these episodes I feel very fatigued.

I only recently put it together that the NAC, C8 MCT Oil (Caprylic Acid) and bowel clense may have incidentily kicked things into high gear!

On the plus side, the seb derm on my face seems to have cleared up a bit, and my scalp is also a little bit better, even considering the dry weather.

Is this a real herx reaction I'm having? What can I do to support my gut when / if I have this reaction again? I have stopped with the C8 MCT oil daily but I'm still taking the NAC and other supplements in the morning as usual.

I know it seems very consistent with a real herx reaction but I want to make sure there's nothing else at play here that I should worry about so if anyone wants to play devils advocate I would appreciate a less biased approach.

My self-concept has improved a lot after I realized that everyone is just us pushed out. His inconsistency was a reflection of my own inconsistency: when I assumed we were already a couple, I would later start questioning why he took so long to reach out (he would talk to me one day and then take around 15 days to comment or reach out again).

Anyway, this phase is passing now, and I understand that everything has its right time to mature and blossom. In the meantime, I don’t want to deprive myself of going out with other men if I feel interested or if I feel like dating someone else — but I’m afraid that doing so might interfere with my manifestation with my SP.

The idea was never to wait for my SP to come back, but to live my life while he hasn’t returned yet. I would honestly love to send my SP a message asking him out for coffee and to make out a lot haha, but that’s not possible yet.

Key observations:

1. Massive range: from 369.81 m²/kg (lamb) to 0.33 m²/kg (root vegetables). That's over 1000x variation.
2. Animal products dominate the high end. Top 10 are all animal-derived except dark chocolate and coffee (tree crops).
3. Beef from beef herds needs 326.21 m²/kg. That's roughly a tennis court per kilogram of meat produced annually.
4. Chicken (12.22 m²/kg) is dramatically more land-efficient than beef, but still higher than any grain or vegetable.
5. Plant proteins cluster low: peas (7.46 m²/kg), tofu (3.52 m²/kg), other pulses (15.57 m²/kg).
6. Almost all vegetables fall under 1 m²/kg. Tomatoes, potatoes, onions, leafy greens all extremely land-efficient.

1qs61uw,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qs61uw/i_dont_know_why_im_like_this/,I don’t know why I’m like this,"I think I have an eating disorder, I’m not diagnosed or anything but it’s starting to become harder & harder to deny….. it’s starting to get harder to deny I don’t have a problem. Even just typing it out feels so hard. I don’t want to be this way, my whole day revolves around food it’s honestly pathetic. 

Right now I’m trying not to cry (being on my period doesn’t help) while I’m having my first coffee at 3pm “to hold” myself till I can have my one & only meal of the day later in the evening. You would think I can just get up & eat something, but it’s really not that easy. Firstly because I’m not on speaking terms with my mother and she does this thing where she keeps leftovers from dinner on top of the microwave where she can see from the living room to make sure I don’t take any. I’m sure that’s not the exact thought process she has, but it feels like that because she’s upset I stopped eating the food she makes. 

Honestly this is all my fault…. I stopped eating the food my mother prepares because I was restricting and started to make my own food which just consists of repeat slop bowls of yogurt or oatmeal. Something I can make quick because I feel so embarrassed having my parents walk in on me weighing everything, they probably think I’m crazy. They definitely know something is going on, they’ve been hearing me throw up for years now. I’ve lost weight and gained weight and lost weight again. But honestly they’re probably used to it. They even get me yogurt since that was all I ate for a very long time. And that makes me feel horrible, it makes me feel like a spoiled little brat who won’t eat anything but yogurt. I can almost see my mother roll her eyes as she gets me the same yogurt again and again. I honestly feel awful for being like this, I try not to have any as a punishment and only start making my way through the yogurt 3 days before it expires because no one else will eat it since in our house it’s known as “mine”.

Idk I guess I’m ranting because when I opened the fridge earlier today to get milk for my coffee I noticed the tupperware with my portion of dinner has already been taken. I cried while I was making myself a coffee and my mother saw me crying when she asked me a question. She just then moved on, didn’t ask why I’m cry or anything like that. In that moment I felt like I don’t matter. I mean those leftovers are probably not even for me since I stopped eating dinner with my family a long time ago. I think every time I see any leftovers I tell myself “see they left me some food, they do care about me” but I still don’t eat it. I just open the fridge and look at it, that alone makes me feel a sense of relief that they still think of me you know? I probably sound pathetic I know I know. I just can’t stop, and it’s all my fault.

Many thanks also to the exceptionally helpful people in the pour-over moka pot group.

The taste is incredibly clean, very chocolatey, and, due to the lack of fines, there are no bitter notes. Combined with the E&B Lab filter, I hadn't expected such a powerful aroma intensity, and I've been making moka pots for over 24 years.

And the grinder isn't even properly broken in yet. I've only put about 600g through it with various types of coffee.

Next, I'll be testing moka pots with the Flair 58+2 and the Graph Step Down basket (58 to 46mm), as this basket requires a coarser grind.

1qs5wy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1qs5wy2/this_morning_my_husband_slapped_me/,"This morning, my husband slapped me.","I woke with a vicious sting prickling across my cheek, the unmistakable sound of skin against skin pulling me from slumber. 

“Babe?” my voice came out in a croak.

He knelt over me with a giant grin, thick brown curls hanging in sleepy eyes. 

Freddie had always been quiet. 

He wasn't usually this… animated. 

In fact, it usually took coffee and smelling salts to wake him up. 

This morning was different. 

Freddie was *too* awake. 

He had to raise his voice to be heard at our own wedding, stumbling through his vows. 

Now, it was like I was staring at a different person. 

“Good morning, sweetheart!” Freddie sang, and I flinched. 

Instead of hitting me again, which I was sure he was going to do, he delicately patted me on the head, rocking forward to kiss my forehead. 

His breaths were shuddering and uneven, prickling my skin. 

I noticed him *lick* my cheek, his tongue lightly grazing over where he'd slapped me. Freddie was never this intimate. This touchy. 

“Do you… like… chicken *tenders*?” He murmured, bursting into childlike giggles.

“Freddie,” I whispered, my voice stuck in my throat. I was too scared to ask him if there was something *wrong*. 

Freddie didn't drink, so he was clearly not under the influence. He wasn't feverish, and he had color in his cheeks, which meant he wasn't sick. Did he hit his head? 

On *what*, though? 

Our bedroom was practically one big comfy cushion.

“Freddie!” 

“Hmmm? 

I was deadly serious. “Are you… having a stroke?”

He sighed, dragging his lips down my spine. 

“Mmmm. Maaaybeeee.” Freddie pulled away and flicked me on the nose, his eyes half-lidded and droopy. “Maybeeeeee…not!” 

He kissed me again, and in the same breath, his lips found my ear. His voice was different, more of a breathy hiss. “Do you *trust* me?” 

I wasn't sure anymore. Instead of questioning his behavior, I rolled out of bed and headed downstairs on wobbly legs. I grabbed some water and slammed the refrigerator shut, before almost jumping out of my skin. Freddie was standing right behind me.

“Good morning!” He said, dancing over to the cupboard. He grabbed cereal. 

Which was weird, because Freddie hated cereal. 

His breakfast was usually avocado toast and a can of soda. 

I watched him overflow his bowl  with Frosted Flakes, grinning at me the whole time. “Mmmmm!” He said, as milk flooded from the bowl, soaking the countertop. 

Freddie grabbed a *fork*, scooped up a mouthful, and swallowed, grinning through a mouthful of milk. “Don't you just *love* cereal on a Friday morning?” 

“You're scaring me,” I whispered, slumping into a barstool. The words came out fast, alphabet soup twisted on my tongue. 

I didn't mean to say that. I didn't mean to look vulnerable. But somehow, those words were in my mouth, choking me, suffocating me. Freddie laughed. Loud. 

Explosive. 

“Scaring you?” He continued shoveling cereal in his mouth, most of it dripping down his chin. 

Then he strode over to me, and dumped the bowl over my head. 

“Merry Christmas!” 

I jumped up, grabbing him. 

“Hey.” I forced him to look at me, at his wide, vacant eyes and plastic grin that wasn't him. “Freddie, look at me,” I whispered. What's going on?” I cupped his cheeks, my eyes stinging. “Have you been gambling again? Tell me the truth.” 

His expression faltered for a moment. 

A blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment. 

For a fraction of a second, his smile twisted. 

His eyes widened. Like he was *screaming*.

Right before his smile seemed to settle, that sharp ignition in his eyes going out. 

I staggered back when his arms dropped to his sides, lips pricking into a grin. 

“Do you wanna have fun?” He took my hand, spinning me around. “Let's be spontaneous! You and me, *babe*.” 

“Fun?” I shoved him back. “What are you *talking* about?” 

“Fun!” 

Freddie strode over to the kitchen drawer and pulled out a knife. 

“Let's play a game,” he burst into giggles. “Fuck! I've always wanted to say that!” 

Freddie started forwards, swinging the hilt. “The objective!” 

He pointed it in my face, blade first. “You run. When I find you, I'll gut you like a fish.” 

I backed away, slowly, and dove into the bathroom. 

But he didn't follow me. 

Instead, he stood there, swaying, the knife drooping. 

Then, he smacked his head into the countertop.

Once. His agonizing cry ripped through me. 

Twice. He dropped to his knees, sobbing. 

Three times, and he was bleeding, red seeping down his chin.

Freddie took two staggered steps back.

“I…” he croaked, dropping to his knees. “I need to tell you something.”

Somehow, I knew it was *him* again. The man I married.

The man I loved. 

But I didn't move, my tongue twisting.

“I gambled away our mortgage,” he whispered through a broken sob. 

I almost laughed. 

That was *it*?

Crawling over to him, I wrapped my arms around him.

“You have a problem,” I whispered. “But I can help you.” I squeezed him tighter. “Whatever you've done, we can fix it, Freddie.” 

He stiffened against me. 

“No, we…we *can't.*” 

His tone made me want to pull away.

“That's… not all,” Freddie whispered.

My blood ran cold.

“I sold us,” he broke into sobs. “I sold our relationship to repay it.” 

He pulled away slowly, and I caught something flash in his eyes.

An ignition of blue coiled around his iris.

“So, they caaaan do whatEVER they want with…mE,” Freddie moved like a puppet. 

He lurched forward, and grabbed the knife, his voice twisting into a snarl.  

“With… *us*.”

His frightened eyes found mine, parting in a silent cry. 

“I… I'm sorry,” he croaked, as my bones turned to lead, my vision blurring. 

Darkness came over me thick and heavy and suffocating, like being pushed to the back of my mind. All I could hear was my own giggle, as my husband’s voice replayed in a vicious cycle.

From endless scrolling and typing to gripping steering wheels and lifting weights, it’s no surprise that hand fatigue, tension, and stiffness have become common complaints. That’s where a smart hand therapy tool can be a total game-changer. Whether you're an athlete, office worker, or someone simply looking to improve your grip strength and relieve built-up tension, this compact solution offers some serious benefits.

# 1. Daily Tension Relief at Your Fingertips

We carry a lot of stress in our hands without even realizing it. Over time, tension builds up in the muscles and joints, leading to stiffness, soreness, and reduced flexibility. A smart hand therapy tool uses rhythmic compression and soothing heat to target deep tissues in the hands and fingers. This not only helps melt away tension but also promotes blood circulation, leaving your hands feeling lighter, looser, and more relaxed after just one session.

# 2. Boost Your Grip Strength Without Hitting the Gym

Stronger grip strength isn’t just for athletes. It plays a huge role in everyday tasks—like opening jars, carrying groceries, or holding onto your favorite coffee mug. By regularly using a hand therapy tool that focuses on resistance and targeted massage, you engage key muscles that improve overall hand function. It’s like strength training for your hands, but without the dumbbells or strain.

# 3. Great for Recovery and Preventative Care

Whether you're managing arthritis, recovering from an injury, or dealing with carpal tunnel from constant computer use, hand therapy tools offer a gentle yet effective way to promote recovery. The customizable settings allow you to control pressure and intensity, so you can start slow and gradually work your way up. Think of it as self-care that’s both preventive and restorative.

# 4. Easy to Use, Anytime and Anywhere

One of the biggest perks? It’s super convenient. You don’t need to carve out extra time for therapy sessions. Just use it while watching TV, reading, or winding down before bed. It’s quiet, cordless, and lightweight—making it perfect for use at home, at work, or on the go.

In short, this smart hand therapy tool does more than just feel good—it helps you *function* better. Less tension, more strength, and happier hands? That’s a win all around.",1,1769874639.0,TheCreativeContent,0,1.0,False

After a brief exchange of pleasantries—during which he told me how much he loved me and my family—we sat down to talk. I’m PIMO, my wife is TBM, and to his credit he is a genuinely kind man with, I believe, good intentions.

He asked when I had last held a temple recommend. I told him I honestly couldn’t remember; it turned out to be 2021. He then asked if I would be willing to review the recommend questions together. I agreed.

When we reached the Word of Wisdom question, I told him I was not observing it. He asked me to elaborate. I explained that I enjoy coffee and tea. As an Englishman, I grew up in a culture where tea drinking was deeply woven into family life and social interaction. Now, living in the United States, I also enjoy coffee. I told him that both my doctor and my cardiologist have advised me that moderate coffee consumption is beneficial to my overall health and heart health, a view supported by numerous medical studies.

I then offered a hypothetical example. If an obese person came in for a temple recommend interview—someone who clearly does not take care of their body, eats excessive amounts of processed food, burgers and fries, and washes it all down with large sugary sodas—that person would likely walk out with a valid temple recommend. Meanwhile, I am a healthy, fit man who limits processed foods, exercises daily, and takes my health seriously, yet I would be denied a recommend because I drink a cup of coffee. I asked him plainly: how is that wisdom?

If you want to see one of the largest collections of unhealthy, overweight people, I said, go to the temple.

He responded by referencing a recent General Conference talk by a woman who spoke about a friend who denied herself temple blessings—and ultimately exaltation—because she would not give up coffee. I told him I simply could not believe in a loving God who would exclude me from the Celestial Kingdom over a cup of coffee.

At that point, the conversation shifted. He asked whether I had tried any coffee substitutes. He then volunteered that every morning he adds a 5-Hour Energy drink to his “healthy” shake. I told him, candidly, that was far worse for him and that he should probably stop doing that.

I then asked him what he believed was the single most dangerous substance we regularly put into our bodies today. He thought for a moment and said fried food. I told him I believed the answer was sugar—something virtually every nutritionist agrees on. I asked why, if the Word of Wisdom were truly about health, God failed to warn us about that.

For me, the conclusion is unavoidable: the Word of Wisdom is not about health. It is about obedience—specifically, unquestioning obedience.",38,1769874587.0,exmormon,10,0.98,False

1qs5ouy,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qs5ouy/have_you_seen_lily_finch/,Have You Seen Lily Finch?,"For as long as I can remember, people have brought up a person named Lily Finch. I finally met her.

When I was thirteen, there was this girl in my class. I don’t recall her name. She would always sit there and daydream.

After a while, one of my classmates walked up to her.

In the days that followed, she grew more outspoken.

Eventually, after a few weeks of this behavior, she began raising her hand—not to answer questions, but to ask her own.

Who is Lily Finch?

After that, she began showing up less and less.

The last time I remember seeing her was sometime in February of 2016.

She looked… emaciated. Dark circles clung to her eyes, and the blue they once were had dulled into a dark, sickly green.

A few weeks later, she was found in a ditch.

Apparently, the cause of death was cerebral hypoxia. Or at least, that’s what the rumors said.

The day after she was found, the principal came over the intercom and encouraged students to visit the school counselor.

Nobody did.

That was ten years ago. Since then, I’ve only heard the name “Lily Finch” every so often—but the context always changes.

I heard it again two weeks ago while grabbing coffee before work. Two women were talking behind me, and I couldn’t help but overhear part of the conversation.

“The Finch’s girl came by last night.”

The details aren’t important. What matters is how casually they said it. As if Lily Finch were a given. As if she’d always been part of this town.

She’s ingrained herself into this town.

But there has never been a Finch family in Jackson County.

The same night I bought that coffee, around 10 PM, I was waiting for a pizza. Music played in the kitchen—some random playlist a friend had sent me. Money sat on the counter for the driver. The forecast called for a bad winter storm later that night.

A knock at the door.

I sprang up and looked toward the front entrance. The porch light flickered a few times before staying on.

I grabbed the cash, assuming it was the delivery guy. Before opening the door, I peeked through the curtains.

Nobody was standing there.

I opened the door. Nothing. I put the cash in my pocket and took a step outside. It was a new moon—no ambient light, just the porch light humming beside me. The wind struck my face carrying the snow with it.  
The mailbox flag was raised. I started walking towards it and nearly slipped a few times before finally reaching it. An envelope. No return address. No stamp. Sealed.

I took it back inside, sat at the table, and opened the envelope.  
I unfolded it. It simply read “See no evil”

The handwriting had no flaws. Not typed. Not printed.

I noticed something out of the corner of my eye—but before I could focus on it, there was another knock at the door.

This time, before opening it, I grabbed the bat leaning against the wall and kept it at my side. I pushed the curtain aside.

The pizza guy.

I opened the door, fumbled with my pockets, tipped him, and took the pizza inside.

As he turned to leave, I caught a reflection on the icy path beside him.

A girl.

Long black hair. Sunken eyes. Too thin.

She was standing just out of the porch light.

I quickly shut the door, locked it, and set the pizza on the table.

The bat slipped from my hand and rolled across the floor, stopping just short of the door.  
I moved toward it slowly.

The porch light cast a sickly green hue across the floor, stretching to my feet—then creeping forward, inch by inch, toward the doorway.

As if it were leading me outside.

A faint hum came from outside the door. The closer I got to the bat, the louder it grew.

I reached it, knelt down, and wrapped my fingers around the handle. I couldn’t help myself and peeked through the curtains.

Outside—on the path—stood the girl, her back to the house.

Something compelled me to open the door. I stood in the doorway, the bat hanging loose in my hand, watching her.

She didn't turn. After a moment, she stepped forward—into the storm. The blizzard swallowed her whole.

I shut the door and locked it. I walked back to the kitchen. My pizza sat there, cold. A second note lay on the pizza box. One that wasn't there before. I unfolded it.  
“Hear no evil”

That was two weeks ago.

For fourteen nights straight, I’ve heard things moving around my house. Not loudly—just enough to notice. Just enough to make sleep impossible. I don’t know how to stop it.

Today, I was at a restaurant with a friend. I asked him about Lily. He hesitated before asking, ""Did you see her?""

I waited a moment before answering. ""Yeah. Why?""

He reached into his pocket, pulled out a hundred dollars in cash, set it on the table, and walked out.

Written on the dollar: ""**Speak no evil**.""

Now I'm writing this asking one simple question.

1qs5li6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buildingmyfutureself/comments/1qs5li6/how_to_stop_filtering_yourself_and_finally_say/,How to Stop Filtering Yourself and Finally Say What You Actually Think: The Psychology Behind It,"so i've been going down this rabbit hole lately about why we're all so goddamn fake with each other. like we'll literally rehearse a text 47 times before sending it to someone we've known for years. i've been researching this across psychology books, stand-up comedy theory (yeah that's a thing), improv training, and honestly just watching people who seem weirdly comfortable being themselves. turns out there's actual science behind why we filter everything and how to stop doing it without becoming an insufferable asshole.

the thing is, most of us are walking around wearing like 12 different masks depending on who we're talking to. work mask. family mask. dating app mask. it's exhausting and also kinda pointless because people can smell inauthenticity from a mile away anyway.

your brain is literally wired to make you scared of being real

there's this part of your brain called the amygdala that freaks out whenever you think about saying something authentic. it's the same part that kept our ancestors from getting kicked out of the tribe for saying the wrong thing. back then, exile meant death, so your brain evolved to play it safe.

but here's the kicker, in modern society that same fear response fires off when you're just trying to tell your friend their new haircut looks weird or admit you don't actually like craft beer. your nervous system can't tell the difference between ""social rejection"" and ""actual danger"" so it treats both like you're about to get eaten by a bear.

reading ""The Courage to Be Disliked"" by Ichiro Kishimi completely shifted how i think about this. it's based on Adlerian psychology and basically argues that all your problems come from seeking approval from others. sounds harsh but it's weirdly liberating. the book sold over 3.5 million copies in Japan and the authors are legit philosophers who spent years studying Alfred Adler's work. best psychology book i've read in years, hands down.

the filtering happens in milliseconds

most people don't even realize they're filtering. it happens so fast. you have a thought, your brain instantly calculates ""will this make them like me less?"" and boom, you say something completely different or nothing at all.

comedians have figured this out better than therapists tbh. they've trained themselves to notice that split second and push through it. that's literally what makes comedy work, saying the thing everyone's thinking but won't say.

there's this concept from improv called ""yes, and"" where you accept what someone offers and build on it honestly instead of filtering or deflecting. sounds simple but it's hard as hell because it requires you to be present and authentic instead of calculating your next ""impressive"" response.

practical ways to unfuck your filter

start small with low stakes situations. next time a barista asks how you're doing, say something real instead of ""good, you?"" like ""honestly kinda tired but this coffee's gonna help"" or whatever's true. sounds dumb but you're literally retraining your nervous system.

practice the 3 second rule. if you think something genuine (and not cruel), say it within 3 seconds before your filter kicks in. works for compliments too, most people think nice things about others all the time but never say them because their brain talks them out of it.

if you want something more structured without reading every book on social psychology, there's this app called BeFreed. it's basically a personalized audio learning platform built by folks from Columbia and Google that pulls from books, research papers, and expert interviews on communication and social skills. you type in a goal like ""stop overthinking what i say in conversations"" and it creates a custom learning plan with podcasts you can listen to while commuting. 

you can adjust the depth from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples, plus pick whatever voice style keeps you engaged, like sarcastic or that smoky Samantha from Her vibe. it actually connects a lot of the dots between books like The Courage to Be Disliked and Radical Candor without having to read them all separately. makes the whole self-improvement thing way less overwhelming.

stop confusing honesty with cruelty

here's where people mess this up. being unfiltered doesn't mean being a dick. there's a difference between ""your presentation sucked"" and ""i think the data in your presentation could be clearer."" authenticity with zero empathy is just being an asshole with extra steps.

the book ""Radical Candor"" by Kim Scott breaks this down perfectly. she's a former Google and Apple exec who literally taught leadership courses on this. the framework is care personally but challenge directly. be real AND give a shit about the other person. that's the sweet spot.

your ""personality"" is probably just anxiety

real talk, that carefully curated version of yourself you present to the world? that's not your personality, that's your anxiety's idea of what will keep you safe. your actual personality is what comes out when you're alone or with someone you deeply trust.

i started noticing this when i'd say something unfiltered by accident and people would be like ""i love when you're like this"" and i'm sitting there like oh shit, i've been boring everyone including myself this whole time.

the paradox nobody tells you

when you stop filtering, some people won't like you. that's literally the point. you're not trying to be universally liked anymore, you're trying to find the people who actually vibe with the real you. it's quality over quantity.

mark manson talks about this in ""the subtle art of not giving a fuck"", his whole thing is about choosing what to care about instead of caring about everything. dude's a blogger turned bestselling author with millions of readers because he just says what he actually thinks. not filtering is literally his brand and it works because people are starving for authenticity.

what actually happens when you stop filtering

conversations get way more interesting. you stop feeling drained after social interactions. you attract different people, usually better ones. you have less friends but deeper friendships. work becomes less exhausting because you're not performing all day.

also weirdly, people respect you more. there's something about someone who's willing to be real that makes others pay attention. even if they disagree with you, they respect that you actually stand for something.

the comedian andrew schulz built his entire career on this. he says the most unhinged shit but people love him because he's clearly not calculating every word. he's present and reactive and real. that's literally his competitive advantage in a world of filtered people.

look, nobody's saying walk into your job tomorrow and tell your boss exactly what you think about their leadership style. but maybe start with telling your friend you're not really in the mood to go out instead of making up some elaborate excuse. then build from there.

I'm taking woodshop classes because I have an interest in woodshop, but in all honesty everything we are doing in this workshop I could teach myself for free online.

I spend about $300 a month on fuel to go offroading with an offroading meets group. I genuinely enjoy going offroading, and while it's fun to do these things with people, I'd be lying if I said I didn't prefer to do it alone.

I also regularly join in events with atheist organizations in my community, namely the FFRF, and go to all of their secular Sunday coffees and membership meetings.

I am taking group rifle classes which cost about $500 a month. These aren't your stupid hillbilly with an AR15 Classes lead by a gravy seal who preaches about God. It's an actual rifle class aimed for long range shooting for deer hunting. I'll be honest, I could probably just spend the cash on more ammo and train myself up through volume rather than instruction.

I don't do these things because I necessarily enjoy them, I do them because I'm starting to feel increasingly alone in the world. I'm an OTR Truck Driver and I specialize in moving overweight and unusual cargo through mountain passes. I'm basically the guy that loads up things like Ambulances or School Busses and deliveries then to areas other truck drivers will refuse to drive through. It's good money, but it's a lonely job 

My friends have also all just sort of become distant or faded away. OG's that I thought would always be there and that I would always be there for are just sort of gone. Not dead, just gone. We don't talk anymore, we don't share messages, we don't invite each other to anything. And it's not like there was a big falling out, it's just the same people I once knew have changed and the bond we once shared just isn't there anymore.

Interestinly enough, the two friends I do feel I have left are the ones with kids, and I feel a huge element of that is I've always prided myself and being the friend that would drop whatever I was working on to help out a brother in need, and so when you're raising kids, it pays to have a friend who can help you out in a pinch with no questions asked.

Because of all of this, I've found myself in a world where I feel isolated and alone. Ice accomplished a lot of incredible things. I rebuilt a Ford Ranger and turned into a Rock Crawler with an Auxiliary Gearbox. I bought and recently paid off my house, that I'm currently in the process of renovating to make it something unique to me. I tagged my first elk last winter and I went on my first Ram Hunt the year before. I taught myself how to solo rock climb. I have bulked up tremendously. I'm obviously learning Spanish, and I'm looking into take horseback riding classes.

But all of these things, they feel like they mean nothing. Every hill I overcome, every skill I develop, every new experience I indulge in, it feels like there is no one in my life to share them with. I feel like I'm on an Oldschool RuneScape Server, surrounded by bots with no one to talk to.

And that's why I piss an ungodly amount of money into socializing my hobbies. Even if I don't ever befriend anyone I meet in these settings, at least it gives me someone to talk to. Because the last year, it was rough. I was remortaring and repairing the masonry outside my house because I wanted a more intricate design, and I spent two months in blazing heat chilling out bricks and replacing them, and by the time I was done, I was just leaning up against my fence, sitting on the ground, drinking a beer, listening to the chickens, and admiring all my hard work... Completely alone.

I'm hoping things will change with time, but I'm scared they won't. I new because of the life I lived I was going to have to be comfortable with some solitude and isolation, but I never expected to feel this alone in the world.",2,1769873945.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False

I recently ran a trial content strategy for a local coffee chain in my area (brick-and-mortar, drive-thru style). This was my first client, and the goal wasn’t to pitch services — it was to test whether the same content system I use for my own personal brand would work in a completely different niche.

Timeframe: \~5 months

Ad spend: Essentially none (almost all organic)

	•	It could work for a local, physical business

	•	The results were repeatable

Now they want to continue, and I’m trying to figure out what a fair monthly retainer would be going forward.

1qs5f87,https://www.reddit.com/r/Shuukura/comments/1qs5f87/chapter_407/,Chapter 407,"We pass through the university gate where we took the commemorative photo and continue along at an easy pace.



After a short while, the booth run by Mio-san’s Classical Music Research Club comes into view, and I end up reading out loud exactly what’s written on the sign.



“……Beetho-ben?”



“Shiori-chan. Look at the sign more carefully.”



Following her words, I step closer to the booth so I can see the sign properly. Maika, who follows along with with a curious look on her face, reads aloud the part Mio-san clearly wanted me to notice.

“‘Branch No. 9.’”

“That’s right. Beetho-ben, Branch No. 9. It’s an amazing bento shop. Very Classical Music Research Club-like, right?”



Mio-san says cheerfully, her smile never fading.



Two questions pop into my head at what I’ve just heard, and I voice one of them.



“If it’s the Ninth Branch, does that mean there’s a main branch?”



“Nope. I just thought calling it a branch would give it that kind of vibe. By the way, that was my idea.”



Mio-san answers casually, and Sendai-san speaks up with exasperation.

“It really feels like a name Mio would come up with. You’re always so careless about this kind of thing. And calling it ‘Beetho-ben’ as a pun on Beethoven and bento—isn’t that way too obvious?”



“Well, sure, it’s the kind of thing you see a lot. But stuff like this is all about the spirit.”



“I think it’s funny and a good idea. Very Mio-like.”



Maika’s bright voice rings out, and Mio-san’s face—already gazing at the sign with satisfaction—lights up even more.



“As expected of Maika-chan. You get it!”

“Mio-san, aren’t you going to perform here and let people listen to music?”



I throw out my other question.



“Our club specializes in listening, so we don’t perform. That’s why, for the festival, we let the bento ingredients listen to classical music instead.”



“Eh? The bento ingredients?”



“Yep, the bento ingredients.”



“Oh! That’s the kind of thing that makes food taste better, right?”



Maika blurts it out energetically and stares intently at Mio-san.



“That’s it! They say vegetables grow better if you let them listen to Mozart, right? So if we use ingredients that listened to classical music, wouldn't the bento taste better?”



Mio-san smiles gently and places an order. “Four servings of yakisoba, please.” Then she continues, “And for drinks—” only to be cut off by Sendai-san.



“Wait a second, Mio. Yakisoba?”



Sendai-san asks with a serious face, and I turn my eyes to the booth’s menu.



Yakisoba.

Barley tea, oolong tea, coffee.



It’s a menu you often see at festival booths, and it’s hardly what you call a bento. I can’t help thinking that the Beethoven whose name they’re borrowing might be crying in his grave.



“Yep, yakisoba.”

“That’s not a bento.”

“Well, yeah. We actually wanted to make proper bentos, but getting all the permissions was too much of a hassle, so it didn’t work out. That’s why we didn’t write ‘bento’ on the sign either. This kind of thing is all about how you feel, so let’s just agree that in everyone’s hearts it’s a bento shop, okay? 



Besides, this is the Ninth Branch, not the main one, so cut us some slack. Anyway, what do you want to drink? Oh—and we let the drinks listen to classical music too, so they’re also delicious.”



As Mio-san asked with a mischievous grin, we order our drinks. Before long, the yakisoba—which Mio-san insists counts as a bento—is ready, and we sit down in the eating area provided by Beetho-bento, Branch No. 9.



“People don’t usually listen to classical music unless there’s a reason, right? So I thought if we said it’s yakisoba made with ingredients that listened to classical music, it might spark a little interest. That’s why—go ahead and scan the QR code.”



As she says this, Mio-san —sitting diagonally in front of me—scans the QR code stuck on her bottle of oolong tea with her phone and smiles.



“My oolong tea is delicious. It listened to Beethoven’s Symphony No. 1.""



“Oh, so with the QR code, you can see which pieces the ingredients and drinks listened to.”



Maika says excitedly, and Mio-san answers with a cheerful, “Exactly.”



“Sounds interesting.”



I say what I honestly think.



I don’t know what Symphony No. 1 sounds like, but I’m curious about the music the food and drinks I’m about to consume listened to.



I pull out my phone and try to scan the QR code printed on the paper I was given with my yakisoba. Just then, Maika’s voice comes from beside me.



“It says the yakisoba was made from noodles that listened to Beethoven’s Symphony No. 6, Pastoral. And it says Beethoven was born in 1770—a German composer and pianist. I can’t really picture Pastoral, though.”



“Pastoral sounds kind of like this.”



Mio-san hums a tune, filling the area with a melody that feels vaguely familiar—or maybe not—and then smiles at me.



“What about you, Shiori-chan? Which piece did yours listen to? We made sure everything listened to Beethoven, in keeping with Beetho-ben, Branch No. 9.”



“It says the cabbage listened to Piano Sonata No. 23, Appassionata.”



On the phone screen, in addition to the title, there’s a small note: ‘One of the representative works of Beethoven’s middle-period piano sonatas.’



“Classical music feels like each piece is really long. Did you let each ingredient listen all the way through?”



When I voice this new question, Mio-san clears her throat and begins speaking in an oddly formal tone.



“Well, about that— due to time constraints, we’ve established a rule that as long as it listens even a little, it counts. For example, the noodles listened to the music playing outside the refrigerator… from inside the refrigerator.”



“That kind of feels like cheating.”



“Come on, Shiori-chan. Don’t sweat the small stuff. Anyway, how about you, Hazuki?”



“It says my barley tea listened to Piano Sonata No. 17, Tempest… but doesn’t tempest mean storm? Isn’t that a bit violent for barley tea?”



Across from me, Sendai-san deliberately makes a troubled face and flicks the QR code stuck to her bottle with her finger.



“It’s fine. It’s dramatic. And it’s not actually that violent a piece.”

“I feel like it'll give me a stomach ache.”

“It won’t.”



Mio-san declares firmly, and beside me Maika raises her voice.



“My oolong tea seems like a winner!”



“Winner? What do you mean, Maika?”



I ask, and she replies, “It listened to Symphony No. 9. That’s the Ninth, right?”



“Maika-chan, that’s correct. Since this is the Ninth Branch, that’s a jackpot!”



“Yay!”



Amid the cheerful voices, I scan my own QR code.

Even though I didn’t mean to match her, it turns out the barley tea I chose—the same as Sendai-san’s—also listened to Tempest, so I tell her, “It was a stomach-ache-inducing piece.”



“So Miyagi got Tempest too? If you get a stomach ache, I’ll take care of you.”



Sendai-san says something stupid with a happy grin, and I lightly tap her foot under the table with my toe.



“You don't have to.”

“What a shame. Okay then, let’s eat now.”



Sendai-san says this while looking at Mio-san, and Maika chimes in with, “I agree!”



“Let’s eat.”



As we say the phrase we always say before meals, our voices overlap and we end up laughing for no particular reason. I pick up my chopsticks and take a bite of cabbage that listened to Piano Sonata No. 23 together with noodles that listened to Symphony No. 6, Pastoral.



“…Delicious.”



When I mutter my impression to myself, Mio-san looks at me happily.



“Right? Right?”



The yakisoba from the food stall isn't anything elaborate.



It’s only as good as what students can make for a school festival—but somehow, it tastes especially good.



“Mio-san, even the dangerous barley tea tastes good.”

“The yakisoba tastes like the countryside. Mio-san, what did the other ingredients listen to besides the cabbage?”

“If you get another QR code, you can find out. I made a bunch because I wanted everyone to have fun comparing which pieces they got.”



Mio-san answers Maika brightly.



She looks like she's having so much fun, and while I do have complicated feelings about Sendai-san sitting next to her, seeing Mio-san in such high spirits makes me feel ashamed about the feelings sitting quietly in the corner of my heart—feelings I shouldn’t voice.



To begin with, even if Sendai-san is sitting next to me, I’d normally want to complain that Maika and Mio-san are the ones looking at her, or that I can’t see Sendai-san’s face very well from where I am.



So this is fine.



This place, where I can watch Sendai-san eating yakisoba with obvious enjoyment, is the best place to be.



Thinking that way, I feel like the Beethoven-listening yakisoba should taste even better.



“Mio, is it okay for you not to help out at the booth today?”



Sendai-san stops her chopsticks after eating about half her yakisoba.



""I was in charge of playing music for the ingredients, and I'll be working the stall later, so it's fine.""



Even hearing all this talk about the Classical Music Research Club, I still couldn't associate Mio-san with classical music in my mind.



And yet, while eating yakisoba, she talks about Beethoven’s greatness, names several composers, and passionately explains what makes classical music good. Then, once she’s about halfway through her yakisoba, she suddenly points her phone at Maika and me and takes a picture.



“Let me take a cute picture of you two.”

“You already did.”



When I complain about the mismatch between her words and actions, Sendai-san laughs and says, “Maybe I’ll take one too,” and starts snapping photos.



Click. Click. Click.



Unpleasant sounds echo, and Maika picks up her phone as well.



“Aren’t we shooting the wrong subjects? Wouldn’t it make more sense for me to take pictures of Sendai-san and Mio-san?”



“Then Maika-chan, you can take pictures of us while we’re taking pictures of you. And of course, Shiori-chan, you can take pictures of us too.”



Faced with her smile, I speak in a voice that’s just warm enough to avoid sounding cold.



“Thanks. But I’ll just watch. You three can take pictures of each other.”



“Eh? Shiori, you should take some too.”



Maika points her phone at me and snaps a photo.



Across from me, Sendai-san and Mio-san are pointing their phones 

at me as well, and my brow furrows.



“That frown is nice. Very cute, Shiori-chan.”



Mio-san says something random while taking a photo, and Sendai-san laughs.



“Miyagi, you’re cute.”



So annoying.



But I can’t say it’s annoying, and I can’t keep frowning forever.



I press my index finger to the space between my brows, then look at the three of them with an expression that isn’t quite a smile, but as gentle as I can manage.



“I’m going to eat my yakisoba.”



I declare this in a voice as soft as my expression and start eating again. The three of them laugh and resume eating too. The yakisoba, flavored by Beethoven’s music, disappears in no time, and we walk around chatting happily as a group of four, enjoying the school festival.



So many booths.



Eating donuts, eating popcorn.



Music and laughter drifting from somewhere.



Watching a light music club’s live performance, listening to rakugo.



The noise, the cheers, the break from everyday life.



At Sendai-san’s university, which I’ve entered for the first time, an event far removed from ordinary university life—the school festival—is taking place. I don’t know what kind of student life Sendai-san leads here. But this is undeniably a place she comes to every day, a place where there are sides of her I don’t know.



Proof of that comes when many people call out to her—“Sendai-san,” “Hazuki.” Watching Sendai-san respond familiarly to those voices alongside Mio-san, who’s being called out even more often, my heart, which had been calmed by the delicious yakisoba is stirred into waves, and my chest tightens.



Her face right now is her public face.



It’s a face I knew well in the past—and one I don’t particularly like.



I almost reach out and grab the clothes of the Sendai-san walking beside me, then stop.



No matter what face she’s wearing, Sendai-san belongs to me, and she won’t become anyone else’s. What she feels about me—



No. This isn’t something to be thinking about here.



I pull out my phone and take a picture of the scenery Sendai-san sees every day. But the scene captured on my screen is nothing but extraordinary, and I can’t find even a fragment of Sendai-san in it.



“Miyagi, what are you taking pictures of?”



Sendai-san calls out to me in her usual voice, despite the unfamiliar expression on her face.



“The school festival scenery.”

“Take one with me too.”



Her formal face gives way to her usual smile, and before I can think, my finger taps the screen.



Click.



A smiling Sendai-san is captured on my phone.



“Did it turn out nice?”

“I don’t know.”

“I’ll judge for myself, so show me.”



No way.



If I say that, the atmosphere will become awkward.



But I don’t want to show her.



I hesitate for three seconds about what to do.



Then Mio-san’s voice rings out.



“Oh—Maika-chan. Endo-kun from that mixer texted me, asking me to come see his dance. Want to go?”

“I kind of do. What about you two?”



Reacting happily to a name I don’t recognize, Maika looks at me and Sendai-san.



“Hm. I don’t know Endo-kun, so is it fine if I just wander around with Miyagi?”



Without checking my feelings, Sendai-san says it like it’s nothing.



“Okay. Then let’s split up for a bit. Let's meet back here in thirty minutes.”



A decisive voice echoes in my ears.



“See you later.”



Maika, who had been beside me, is led away by Mio-san and disappears from view.



Which means I’m alone with Sendai-san.

1qs5ex6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelTrotters/comments/1qs5ex6/sick_of_tourist_traps_heres_how_i_spent_10_days/,"Sick of tourist traps? Here's how I spent 10 days in [Country] for under $600, focusing on local food and public transport. 🌍","I’d had enough. Last year, in a famously bustling capital city, I paid $12 for a *single* small bottle of water from a souvenir stand because I was parched and desperate after wandering too close to a major attraction. It was flat-out highway robbery, and it kicked off a new mission for me: travel smarter, deeper, and without funding someone else’s overinflated 'authentic experience.'

My last big trip was 10 days in an incredible country – think vibrant street life, ancient temples, and food that will make your taste buds sing – all for just under $600. No fancy tours, no tourist-trap restaurants. Just me, a backpack, and a real desire to see how people actually live. Here's how it went down:

### The Game Plan: Local Living on a Budget

My goal wasn't just to save money, but to actively participate in the local scene. That meant:

*   **Accommodation:** Ditching hotels for guesthouses or family-run homestays, often a few blocks off the main drag.
*   **Food:** Street food stalls, morning markets, and small, nondescript eateries packed with locals.
*   **Transport:** Public buses, trains, and my own two feet.
*   **Activities:** Focus on free or low-cost experiences – wandering, people-watching, non-ticketed temples, natural beauty.

### The Breakdown: How My $600 Vanished (Slowly)

Here's a rough idea of what I spent, and how I did it:

*   **Flights:** *Not included in the $600, as flight costs vary wildly by origin and season.* My budget focused purely on ground expenses once I landed.
*   **Accommodation (9 nights): ~$160**
    *   I averaged about $18 a night for private rooms in clean, basic guesthouses. I used Booking.com's ""guesthouse"" filter and sometimes just walked into places that looked good and negotiated a bit. My favorite was a place near a local university campus, buzzing with life but quiet at night.
*   **Food (10 days): ~$130**
    *   This was the best part. Breakfast was usually a bowl of noodles or a local pastry from a street vendor for $2-3.
    *   Lunch and dinner were similar: fantastic curries, rice dishes, or skewers for $3-5 a meal.
    *   *My rule:* If locals were lining up, I was joining them. I avoided any place with a menu in six languages and pictures of the food.
    *   **Total Daily Food Average: $13.** You can definitely eat for less if you're super strict.
*   **Local Transport (10 days): ~$70**
    *   The public bus system there was incredible and dirt cheap. Most local rides were under $1.
    *   I took a 5-hour intercity bus ride for about $6, and a slightly faster 3-hour train ride for $8. I just bought tickets at the station on the day of travel.
    *   Walked *everywhere* I could.
*   **Activities & Misc (10 days): ~$180**
    *   Most of my ""sightseeing"" was free: exploring local markets, visiting temples that didn't charge entrance fees, hanging out in parks, or just observing daily life.
    *   I did splurge a little on a few things:
        *   An excellent half-day cooking class (including a market tour and all ingredients) for $25. Highly recommend.
        *   Entry to one major historical site that cost $10.
        *   A couple of locally brewed beers and fresh juices, usually $1-2 each.
        *   Souvenirs: mostly small, handmade items from local artisans, maybe $30-40 total.
        *   A few cups of excellent local coffee.

**Grand Total for 10 Days on the Ground: ~$540.** Well under budget!

### The Real Talk: It Wasn't Always Glamorous

*   **Language Barrier:** English isn't universally spoken once you're off the main tourist circuit. Google Translate became my best friend for deciphering menus and asking for directions. A few basic phrases in the local language go a long way.
*   **Comfort Levels:** Expect basic. Beds can be harder, showers sometimes aren't hot, and air conditioning isn't a given in the cheapest rooms. If you need plush towels and room service, this isn't the way to travel.
*   **Getting Around:** Public transport can be crowded, and navigating it requires a bit more patience and attention than just hailing a taxi. Sometimes buses were late, sometimes I missed my stop. It's part of the adventure.
*   **Food Safety:** While I never got seriously ill, street food always carries a minor risk. Stick to places with high turnover, good hygiene (where visible), and trust your gut. Carrying hand sanitizer is a must.
*   **Weather:** I went during the shoulder season, which meant fewer crowds but also some unpredictable rain showers. Always check the climate for your travel dates.

This trip was a reminder that you don't need to spend a fortune to have an incredible travel experience. In fact, cutting costs often pushes you towards the most authentic, memorable parts of a destination. It's about trading convenience for curiosity, and tourist gloss for genuine human connection.

For a grinder, I got the Eureka Mignon Zero 55s, which works great for me. I didn't want to spend much more than €1k on the machine and grinder combined.

Sunday after the beach hike with Liz and Torres 

The sun is high and forgiving today here in Newtown , turning the beach into a postcard of blue water and white sand. Kids chase each other in and out of the shallows, their laughter mixing with the crash of waves and the occasional triumphant yell when a volleyball spikes clean over the net. A little girl nearby pats down the sides of a sandcastle with serious focus, adding a twig flag that immediately topples. Rachel von Winterbourne watches it all from her table at the diner, the striped umbrella casting moving shadows across her paper.

The coffee’s the usual diner variety—dark, a touch acrid, nothing like the Black Rifle blend Elizabeth hoards like treasure. Rachel doesn’t mind; it keeps her grounded. 

Ping 

Looking at her Data pad reading girl you at your hab 

Rachel types beach just writing  send 

Elizabeth seeing the return message typing see you in 30 

I’ll bring my thermos. Send 

Ping Rachel seeing the message and smiles no return needed or Elizabeth will keep replying , Well she’s like a young sister even though we are only a couple year apart and I’ve known her for such a short time now 

She dips the old fountain pen into the inkwell again, the nib scratching softly as she writes.

Dearest Liz,

You’d roll your eyes at this—another letter, ink on paper, like we’re living in some dusty romance novel instead of the thousands of years in the future (or whatever century it is out here among the stars). But you know me: some things don’t translate to text pings or holo-calls. They need the slow drag of a pen, the small mistakes you can’t delete. This is one of them.

I’ve been thinking about what you said yesterday on the way back ,  how I never really say much about my past before the rescues and the new start here OB Haego You called me out on it, gently, the way only you do. Like sisters, you said just yesterday. (And yeah, that stuck. More than you know.) we my family go back thousands of years to old earth England . Dad made me memorize everything . I was handed a data chit and he said study it I’ll test you .

Liz I miss his test,  sitting on his  lap when I was young 

More like a game. It was our time after my mom died 

So here it is:

This is my  roots of the Winterbourne family, back on old Earth. Dad had me dig into it right before he passed, about a year ago now. I was 21, fresh out of college on New Geneva with my accounting degree, thinking the future was ledgers and quiet forests. He handed me the archives and said, “Trace it back, Rach. Know where the name came from.” So I did.

Our surname Winterbourne shows all the way back to a place called Gloucestershire, “ maybe those walnut tress can be traced there as well “ England—parishes and manors , 

 There was a manor house there from ancient times, One of the first recorded was Henry de Winterburna, popping up in the Pipe Rolls of 1175 in Dorset and Somerset—tax records, basically. Practical stuff. Fitting for us. “ see accountants write down everything “. 

The same goes for a ship’s manifest 

It is all for accountability 

Sorry rambling again 

Then there’s Walter Winterbourne (around 1225–1305), a big name in the family lore. Born in a place called Salisbury, probably took the name from one of the many Winterbourne villages clustered around there. He became a Dominican friar, later working  under  King Edward 

Liz a Winterbourne whispering in a king’s ear. 

And later I right here on this very beach you and I playing games with Clara Astor a princess .

Back to writing 

Walter well He was an orator, poet, philosopher,  Sharp mind, steady hand. Dad loved that part: proof the blood ran thoughtful, not just tough.

There are at least nine parishes scattered across Britain with “Winterbourne” in the name—Winterbourne Bassett in Wiltshire, Winterbourne Houghton, Strickland, Zelston in Dorset—Some tied directly to families holding the estates. The name means “winter stream,” from the Old English—cold water running through the land. 

Dad said it felt right: enduring, quiet, cutting its own path even in hard seasons.

That’s how far back it goes on Earth, 

Liz. Centuries before the stars opened up, before James Raven and Wilford kept the fleet supplied   . Dad wanted me to see we weren’t just some noble house that popped up in the void—we had roots deep in dirt and stone and history. He died seven weeks after I came home to Macha. 

My brother Angus disowned me not long after the funeral. I left at 21 with nothing but what fit in a bag and just a small amount of credits to help start a new life . But I carried that research with me. Still do.

And now I share part of it with you 

You get why I’m telling you this now. You’re the one person who never makes me feel like the past is a burden or a brag. You just listen. Like family. Like the sister I never had  . 

A shadow blocking the sun looking up seeing  Liz with a smile her red hair tried back and that same hat in her head Clara had given us . 

Liz-,Rach dump that coffee out I have the good stuff 

Rachel -Liz how much of that is left . She smiles Rach when the people across the principality started sending us gifts . The black Rifle company sent 2 sealed crates with 2 tones total We have enough for a lifetime . Airtight sealed 

Rach - where is it as I know everyone has been trying to find it 

Liz - winking 

Under a tarp next to my ATV and my bug out gear . 

Rach- what’s bug out gear 

Liz-everything two women would need if they had to leave in a hurry 

Smiling. 

Rach I keep forgetting you were raised by a man in the military ,Liz what was your dads job

Liz - special forces smiling 

Liz another pen and ink  is it dry yet and can I read it 

Rach -handing Liz the letter. 

Lizabeth reading the letter looking at Rachel 

We are absolutely going to the walnut grove this coming Saturday 

Handing Rach back the letter 

Rach no it’s yours Writing is my therapy . 

Liz well then here give it back to me later . Say when-we head back so not to damage it ok

Rachel accepting the letter back 

Liz looking at Rach may I share this with our close group

Rach yes 

 Liz Aino will like it and maybe he can send it in the report to Wyatt

Rach after a long pause. Yes go ahead and. He needs to know more about his accountant

I am learning now that due to my years of trauma, I have been in a constant state of fight or flight, I’m hyper vigilant and cannot sit still. My worth is based on how many chores I get done a day, and how much I can exhaust myself by taking care of everyone else’s needs but my own. How do I actually calm my nervous system and try to heal myself? I am on medication, 10mg Lexapro and 60mg Vyvanse. It helps but I’m still out of control. This morning I had a meltdown. My toddler spilled the dog water (his favorite thing to do) and it got me on edge. I was in the middle of paying a bill, went to grab my coffee and I dropped my mug right on our iPad and now the iPad has a broken screen and won’t turn on. I imagine it’s done for. I move too fast and it is impossible for me to actually slow down and regulate. The Vyvanse actually does help make me slow down and regulate my emotions, but the meds hadn’t kicked in yet at that moment. Now I’m in a rumination spiral of shame and hate myself, wish I wasn’t alive and that my family deserves a better mom. Meanwhile, my toddlers are fine. My fiancé is bummed about the iPad but knows it was an accident, he is more upset about my extremely negative attitude and self hatred. How do I stop doing this? How can anyone with a 1.5 and 3.5 year old actually take a deep breath and calm the fuck down? My life is so chaotic. I have 4 dogs and 6 cats (all rescued prior to children), I WFH and have no childcare and no village to help me, just myself and my fiancé. I have no idea how to ask for help, I just push myself until I’m about to explode and get reactive when I have had enough of cleaning and not having help. Sorry for my rant. 

How have you tried to heal your nervous system? My psychiatrist believes I have OCD and postpartum rage, which was the need for Lexapro. My ADHD symptoms came out of the woodwork once my Lexapro started to work, and she thought Vyvanse would be a good fit. It does help my executive function disorder, and my annoying traits, but I’m still… broken. And I think I have to do inner work and healing to break this cycle I have got stuck into. Like… what can I do? What should I do? I need help and guidance and have nobody to ask who understands what it’s like being a mom to young kids, WFH, and is neurodivergent with kids who are just like her. I just wish I was good enough for this life. I have so much to be grateful for and I’m still just a miserable, negative asshole. Thank you for reading. I really just need a hug.

**EVOLUTION**

It was half past nine. The lab was silent, save for the hum of the servers and the rhythmic, mocking blinking of the monitor.

**Red.**

He slammed his fist against the desk.

""Not again.""

Everyone else had already gone home. They had given up—not only on the night, but on the project itself. Five years of work, millions in funding, and it had all dwindled to this: a dark room, a cold cup of coffee, and a failure rate that refused to budge.

A bead of sweat traced a path down his cheek. He didn’t look away from the screen. He couldn't. He had sacrificed everything for this project. Failure was not an option—not after all he had lost.

He stood up, his chair scraping violently against the floor, and walked to the window.

Below the facility, the ocean crashed against the shore, the moon casting a silver path across the water. It was peaceful. It was infuriating.

His eyes landed on a young couple walking hand in hand along the shore. They were laughing, oblivious to the fact that they were dying, second by second.

That could have been his life—if he had chosen differently. For a moment, a sharp ache caught him off guard. He could walk away. He could go home.

But he had no home.

His mind drifted back to the slums. The smell of rot. The coughing of children who never made it past six. Survival there had been a miracle. His mother had resented him for it; his father had been swallowed by the violence of loan sharks. He had learned young that the universe was cruel, and that the only escape was knowledge.

He looked at the couple again. They were fragile. Finite.

*No,* he thought, his grip tightening on the windowsill. *I am not going back to being helpless.*

He turned back to the desk. The humiliation of defeat was the only thing keeping him upright. He could practically hear the investors laughing—those small-minded vermin who cared more about quarterly profits than the evolution of the human species. He would not let them win.

A knock at the door jolted him.

He spun around to find a young technician standing there. Matthew. Mid-twenties, pale skin, exhaustion in every movement.

""Matthew and I are leaving now, sir,"" the young man murmured.

""I thought everyone was gone,"" he replied, his voice raspy.

""Any luck with the code?""

""Not yet."" He forced a thin, painful smile. ""But I haven’t lost hope.""

It was a lie. He had lost hope hours ago.

Matthew nodded slowly and slipped away down the corridor.

He was alone again. The only sound was the ticking clock. He sat back down, his mind running in an unfamiliar rhythm—faster, sharper, almost electric. He looked at the failure on the screen. He looked at the helix structure.

Something was missing. Some elusive link.

He reached for his coffee mug, eyes fixed on the red text.

*Wait.*

It wasn't a coding error. It was a redundancy. The cells weren't dying; they were fighting the regeneration cycle.

**Click.**

The mug slipped from his hand and shattered on the floor. Brown liquid splashed across his shoes, but he didn't flinch. He didn't breathe.

A smile, small and disbelieving, crept across his face.

""This is it.""

With trembling hands, he began typing. His heartbeat roared in his ears. Euphoria surged through him, but he forced himself to stay focused. One wrong keystroke could ruin everything.

He finished. He reviewed the draft. Once. Twice.

This was his last attempt. If it failed, he would walk away from not only the project but also his life.

He pressed **Enter**.

The screen went black. Then: **LOADING...**

Thirty minutes. Thirty long, unforgiving minutes.

He stared at the screen without blinking, lost in a haze of adrenaline. He had plans—grand ones. If this worked, nothing would ever be the same.

The screen blinked.

**Green.**

He froze. For a moment, it felt like a hallucination. A cruel trick of the light.

But the green glow remained, illuminating the dark lab.

A shout burst out of him, ragged and raw.

""I DID IT!""

The echo bounced off the empty walls.

""I DID IT!""

He raced outside, breathless, stumbling toward the railing. The sea stretched out before him—moonlit, endless, alive. The stars glittered overhead, cold and unreachable, but they didn't look so far away anymore.

He took a long, deep breath, tasting the salt in the air.

He had done it. Science had won.

For the first time in his life, he wasn't afraid of running out of time. Now, he could do this for all of eternity.

For he had just discovered the secret of immortality.

After the break up I was in a delicate place emotionally and not ready to date again.
Three weeks after the break up I met this guy who was intensely interested in me. Like he kept asking me out on dates even though I told him no a bunch of times, or when I agreed, I would end up cancelling last minute and not showing up because I would get a bad feeling. He wouldn't take no for an answer and would text me everyday non stop, telling me how much he liked me, how beautiful I was,ect.. Honestly I should have blocked him earlier on, but I didn't because after my ex breaking up with me, I enjoyed the attention I was getting from this guy, also he was very attractive. I eventually agreed to go on a date with him, and it was a disaster. He was really intense about wanting to be in a relationship with me, and I just viewed it as a casual date. After that date I tried to break it off with him again, but he kept trying to pursue me. I told my friends about it , and they said that why don't I try being friends with benefits with him. This was a complete mistake. I brought it up to him, and he agreed but still kept trying to push us having a relationship. So I cancelled the whole friends with benefits thing with him because I felt it was unfair to his feeling and he got really angry, but agreed to still be friends. During Christmas he kept talking as friends and hung out to get coffee. However we ended up kissing and he convinced me to try dating him. We went on a third date and his personality completely changed, instead of being wholesome with me like before, he started acting pretentious. Also he started belittling and humiliating me on purpose. As well as, he used specific insecurities I told him against me. All of this on only our third date, which was like 2 months after he intensely pursued me. I was really in shock, then we agreed to take the relationship slow, but he started pressuring me to get into a serious commitment with me. We also tried to be intimate together, but I felt so uncomfortable I started crying and we stopped. After the third date and him pressuring me into a serious commitment, I couldn't take it anymore and started crying in front of him and broke up with due to the pressure he was putting on me. Then everything was left up in the air and he started texting me less. I felt relieved, confused  but weirdly enough I started missing him. I felt like I was going crazy. After three weeks he texted me to hangout and get drinks together at night. I told him it wasn't a good idea because of the situation and that I've grown emotionally attached to him. He asked me if I genuinely wanted to start a relationship with him. And I said yes, because I really felt like in the moment that I truely did develop feelings for him. (They he caused because he spent almost three months trying to convince me to date him). At first he seemed open to it, until I asked for an exclusive relationship. He said that his feeling for me had faded over time and that he doesn't have feelings for me anymore. That he understands that it sucks to develop feelings for someone right when the other person's feelings have faded away. In that moment I felt like I was going to murder him. I ended up not seeing him that night, and telling him that I'm tired of the games he's playing, and blocking him on all social media platforms. Like I feel almost depressed after all of this, like we was playing me the whole entire time. I can't sleep or eat.  He also did some other shading things like use specific words I told him when I rejected at first, when he rejected me. Like I told him :""I need to focus on myself"", and he said the exact same sentence. Like he started using my own words against me. He also started begging for us to stay friends and was telling me things like; you still mean a lot to me. My friends are also very important to me too. I care so much about you... I want you to be in my life even as my friend. BLA BLA BLA. But last minute before I blocked him, he said something really ambiguous that could be interpreted as still having feelings for me. I just couldn't take it anymore and I blocked him. He also accused me of trying to pressure him into a relationship, staking him and me wanting him to date me out of pitty. Which honestly were things that he did at first. I just don't understand this situation and I distanced myself from him for my mental health. I was literally struggling to do my job because of this.

Earlier this month I switched to a OP 15, model CPH2749. I bought the phone in cash directly from OnePlus. I am in the USA. I use dual SIM, one Verizon one TMobile. There was an update available that I had not installed yet. 

I've had a OnePlus phone for forever it seems like; first was a OP 7, then a OP 9, then a OP Open, now this one. Been a big fan of the phones and they've always been rock solid for me and my use cases. Every 1+ I've had I bought directly online from the 1+ store. I absolutely hate Samsung phones with a passion. I always get rid of bloatware or apps I don't need or use on all of my phones. I'm pretty savvy with Android phones, used to be fairly active on XDA when it was still fun to use custom kernels, but haven't been there in a few years now. 

Since I got the 15, I have used the charger and cable that the 15 came with, or the charger from the 1+ Open and one of the long cables bought directly from the 1+ store exclusively (except in the car, where I'll just use the USB port in the car and the original cable from the Open). Put another way, I have only charged the 15 with official chargers and cables from OnePlus. I've had zero problems with Supervooc fast charging, and come to think of it, I've had zero issues with the 15 at all until now.

Last night I had let the phone drain a bit, it was down to 9% battery. I put it face down on the coffee table to watch some TV and it sat there for about 30 minutes, which absolutely isn't enough time for the phone to have burned down to 0% charge. Matter of fact there have been a couple nights where the phone was below 10% when I went to bed and it was still on without charging in the morning.

No liquids have ever been spilled on the phone. It's never gotten any moisture on it at all. 

Anyway last night when I picked it back up off the coffee table the phone was dead. It won't charge and it won't turn back on.

Here's what I've tried. 

1. Tried charging for  30-60 minutes on the charger and cable it came with.  
2. Tried charging for 30-60  minutes using various combinations of other OnePlus branded chargers and OnePlus branded cables from all the previous 1+ phones I've had.   
3. tried holding down the power button for 20 seconds or more, and tried doing that 5 times in a row.  
4. tried holding down various combinations of the other buttons + power button for various lengths of time. There are 3 other buttons beside the power button: the volume buttons and the ""do not disturb"" button on the other side of the phone.   
5. tried cleaning out the USB port on the phone with a small swab and some isopropyl.   
6. Tried letting the phone sit in a sealed container with a couple of large desiccant packs for several hours.   
7. Verified that all charger and charging cable combinations were properly functioning by using each to charge one of the other phones. No issues.   
8. Tried pulling the SIM cards out and charging with them removed.  
8. The phone sat on the charger/cable it came with overnight. 

Phone is still dead. It's Saturday and all OnePlus customer services are all closed.

They walk into a room and everyone's eyes are on them. Meanwhile, you're doing the work, putting in the effort, but somehow getting ignored like yesterday's leftovers.

Here's the kicker, it's not always about being better or doing more. A lot of it comes down to contrast. And no, I'm not talking about some fake ""just be yourself"" advice. I'm talking about a legit psychological phenomenon that's been studied to death. Strategic positioning, environmental framing, and social comparison theory all play into how people perceive you. I dove deep into research, books, podcasts, everything, and what I found changed how I think about attractiveness entirely.

The wild part? Most people are working their asses off trying to upgrade themselves when they could just shift the context around them and instantly appear more impressive. Let me break this down.

 Step 1: Understand the Psychology of Contrast

Here's what most people don't get. Your brain doesn't evaluate things in a vacuum. It compares. Always. When you see a gray square on a white background versus a black background, the gray looks totally different even though it's the exact same color. That's contrast effect in action.

The same thing happens with people. You're not judged based on some objective scale of awesomeness. You're judged relative to your surroundings. Stand next to someone who's super lazy and disorganized? You look like a productivity god. Hang out with high achievers who are crushing it 24/7? Suddenly you're the slacker.

Dr. Robert Cialdini talks about this in Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion (dude's a legend in social psychology, won awards, has research cited thousands of times). He breaks down how contrast affects everything from sales tactics to dating. The book's packed with examples of how people manipulate perception using this exact principle. Insanely good read if you want to understand how your brain gets tricked daily.

The point is, your attractiveness, competence, whatever, is partially determined by who and what you're next to.

 Step 2: Choose Your Environment Strategically

If you want to appear more impressive, you need to be mindful of your environment. This isn't about faking it or being someone you're not. It's about putting yourself in situations where your strengths naturally shine brighter.

Let's say you're decent at public speaking. If you're in a room full of professional speakers and TED talk veterans, you're gonna look average. But put yourself in a setting where most people are terrified to speak up? Boom. You're the confident leader everyone respects.

This applies to literally everything:

 Social settings: Hang out in groups where your skills are above average, not below.  

 Work environments: Position yourself in teams where your expertise stands out.  

 Dating: Choose venues or activities where you have a natural advantage (sporty? suggest hiking. Good conversationalist? pick intimate coffee dates over loud clubs).

The app Ash actually has some solid coaching modules on this. It's like having a relationship and social dynamics coach in your pocket. They break down how environmental context affects attraction and give practical frameworks for positioning yourself better in social situations. Worth checking out if you're serious about upping your game.

For those wanting to go deeper into attraction psychology without committing hours to reading, there's BeFreed, a personalized learning app built by Columbia University alumni and AI experts from Google. You can set specific goals like ""become more magnetic as an introvert"" or ""master social positioning,"" and it pulls from psychology books, research papers, and expert insights on attraction and social dynamics to create custom audio podcasts. You control the depth, from 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's even a smoky, conversational style that makes complex psychology feel like chatting with a friend. It's been useful for turning commute time into actual skill-building instead of mindless scrolling.

 Step 3: Control the Baseline Comparison

Here's a sneaky one. You can actually set the baseline that people compare you against. How? By controlling what information they get first.

Example: You're meeting someone new for a project. Don't lead with your biggest accomplishments. Start with something modest or even slightly self deprecating. ""Yeah I've been messing around with design for a bit."" Then, when they see your actual work, the contrast between their low expectation and your real skill makes you look way more impressive.

This is called anchoring in behavioral economics. The first piece of info someone gets becomes their reference point for everything else. If you set a low anchor, then reveal more, you benefit from positive contrast. If you brag upfront and then fail to deliver, negative contrast destroys you.

The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel talks about this in the context of wealth and perception. Housel's a Wall Street Journal columnist, and this book was a massive bestseller. He breaks down how people's perception of success is almost entirely relative and comparison based. It'll make you rethink everything about how you present yourself and your achievements. Best personal finance psychology book I've ever read, hands down.

 Step 4: Surround Yourself with the Right People

This is gonna sound harsh, but your friends and social circle are either boosting or tanking your perceived value. If everyone around you is aimless, unmotivated, or stuck, you'll naturally look better by comparison. But here's the trap, you also won't grow much.

The move is to strategically balance your social circles:

 Peer group for growth: Surround yourself with people slightly ahead of you so you're pushed to level up.  

 Peer group for confidence: Maintain connections with people where you're the experienced one, the mentor figure.

When you're in that second group, your confidence naturally shoots up because you're the person people come to for advice. That confidence bleeds into how you carry yourself everywhere else.

 Step 5: Leverage Situational Strengths

You don't need to be the best at everything. You just need to be the best in the room for specific things at specific times. This is about playing to your strengths in the right contexts.

Know you're great at storytelling? Steer conversations toward topics where you can share compelling stories. Good at problem solving under pressure? Volunteer for challenging situations where others are freaking out. Your calmness and competence will stand out sharply against their panic.

The book So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport digs into this. Newport's a computer science professor at Georgetown and his research on skill development is top tier. He argues that instead of trying to be well rounded, you should focus on developing rare and valuable skills, then position yourself where those skills matter most. This book will make you question everything you think you know about career success and personal branding.

 Step 6: Use Visual and Social Anchors

People are visual creatures. How you present yourself relative to your environment matters more than you think. Dress slightly better than everyone else in the room, not absurdly overdressed, just one notch above. The contrast makes you look more put together and serious.

Same with body language. If everyone's slouching and distracted, stand tall and maintain eye contact. The contrast alone makes you appear more confident and attractive.

Social proof works here too. If you're seen talking to impressive people, others assume you're impressive by association. It's dumb but it works. Your brain shortcuts and goes, ""They're friends with that successful person, so they must be valuable too.""

 Step 7: Don't Compete Where You Can't Win

Here's the uncomfortable truth. If you're constantly putting yourself in environments where you're outclassed, you're shooting yourself in the foot. Yeah, it might push you to grow long term, but in the short term, you're damaging how others perceive you.

Know when to step back from situations where the contrast will work against you. This isn't about avoiding challenges. It's about being smart with where you invest your energy and attention.

If you're at a networking event full of CEOs and you're just starting out, maybe don't try to dominate conversations about business strategy. Instead, position yourself as someone eager to learn, which creates a different kind of positive contrast, humility and potential versus arrogance and overreach.

 Step 8: Reframe Your Narrative

The stories you tell about yourself matter. A lot. You can take the exact same life experiences and frame them in ways that create positive or negative contrast.

Struggling entrepreneur versus resilient founder learning from failures. Unemployed versus taking time to find the right opportunity. The facts are the same. The contrast in perception is massive.

Podcast recommendation here, The Tim Ferriss Show. Ferriss is a master at reframing narratives. He interviews world class performers and breaks down how they position their stories. You'll learn how successful people talk about their setbacks and wins in ways that maximize positive perception. Game changing stuff.

 Step 9: Create Distance from Negative Comparisons

If you're stuck in an environment where the contrast is working against you, create distance. Literally and figuratively. Change jobs, switch friend groups, move cities if you have to.

Sometimes the fastest way to appear more attractive isn't changing yourself. It's changing your surroundings so the comparison works in your favor. This isn't running away. It's strategic repositioning.

 Final Word

Look, you don't need to become a completely different person to be more attractive or impressive. You just need to understand how perception works and position yourself smartly. Contrast is a tool. Use it. Your skills, personality, and value don't exist in a vacuum. They're always being judged relative to something else.

Stop grinding yourself into the ground trying to be perfect. Start thinking about context. Where do you naturally shine? What environments amplify your strengths? Who are you standing next to?

Master contrast, and you'll appear more impressive without changing a damn thing about who you are.",1,1769871964.0,Buildingmyfutureself,0,1.0,False

One of the toughest places to heal from is the feeling of being **undefined**. When we don't consciously set our personal boundaries, our lives often become like an empty glass—we automatically fill the space for everyone else's needs, demands, or definitions of who we *should* be. You become a supporting character in your own story, simply because the lead role was left vacant.

This is where we reclaim our definition.

### The Practical Tip: Create Your 'Inner Contract'

If the idea of setting boundaries feels overwhelming, start with micro-definitions. We are going to establish 3 **Core Non-Negotiables**. These are actions, protections, or commitments that you uphold fiercely for the next seven days, regardless of external pressure or guilt.

**How to Do It:**

1.  **Identify the Vacuum:** What area of your life consistently gets sacrificed when stress hits? (Usually rest, quiet time, or personal passions.)
2.  **Choose 3 Boundaries:** These must be concrete and measurable, defining your immediate relationship with yourself.
    *   *Example 1 (Energy):* I will log off all work communications by 6 PM. This 6 PM line is defined and protected.
    *   *Example 2 (Mental Space):* I will spend 15 minutes alone with my journal/coffee before checking any social media or news. This is my protected mental territory.
    *   *Example 3 (Self-Care):* I will say 'No' to one non-essential social obligation this week to protect my rest.

**The Power of Protection:**

These 3 items become your 'definition starter kit.' When you successfully protect even these small areas, you are actively retraining your brain that *you* are the primary authority in your life. You are moving from 'undefined' to 'defined' one conscious decision at a time.

Start small. Define fiercely. Your life is waiting for you to sign the contract.",1,1769871628.0,Empowish,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone. I know this will sound crazy, but It's honestly been really tough finding support or anyone who will walk through this with me - The med team I don't think is very receptive to my concerns, and it's quite possible I'm just not very well informed.

This is what I posted earlier this morning in another sub. Thanks for listening:

40 Male, 5' 9"", 210 lbs, Iowa, no medications, don't smoke or drink (on special occasions, not regularly at all), good health bloodwork is good with slightly elevated cholesterol...

So, they're suggesting that I get an endoscopy to see what going on inside - I've had sour stomach and indigestion and pain on the left side of my abdomen for some time now. The only thing is - I am TERRIFIED of anesthesia, and they want to use Propofal on me. I did the endoscopy once years ago without any sedative and my gag reflex was pretty bad, so this guy won't do it for me unless I go under. They say it's not a complete sedation, I get that, but you're still losing brain cells, am I right?

Maybe I should try and find another gastro who's willing to do it for me unsedated?? Is there any way to find out what's going on inside my stomach other than an endoscopy? A blood test or whatever - I'm mainly worried about infection/ ulcers and stuff, but ya know... I'm not a doctor - I don't really know what I should've or shouldn't be worried about/ looking for... Someone I know is telling me it's h- pylori??

Also, I'll add that I was doing really good with some acupuncture until recently when I drank what was apparently WAY too much kefir - I'm feeling pains in my stomach that I haven't felt in ten years now, and it hasn't gone away for 5-6 days - and of course it brought along a bunch more acid...

I'm sure a lot of this is stress induced, as well. I had a relaxing night out yesterday and symptoms completely disappeared. I was stunned honestly, but as soon as I walked in the door symptoms came ROARING back. Ha. I actually remember the moment this all came on ten years ago... Anyway, I'm rambling now...

Something crazy, too, is that water makes it WORSE!!! Omg - I have no idea why... Yesterday, I had a cup of black coffee and finally got some relief. lol. This condition is WILD - whatever it is that I have going on...

1qs4hq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qs4hq0/hr_the_perils_of_talking_to_strangers/,[HR] The Perils of Talking to Strangers,"I read once that a stranger is just a friend you haven’t met yet. Using that logic, a stranger is also someone you haven’t been murdered by yet. I only really have two people I like, and there were 714 murders in the UK in 1993 alone, so the odds aren’t exactly in friendship’s favour.

That’s why the number one rule is: do not speak to strangers. Sally and Jessie say it’s for my own good. I would joke and say, in a spooky voice, “The perils of talking to strangers.” They’d never laugh. It made me a little happy for a bit, so I kept saying it. 

Apparently, I am very important to some people, and they are out there looking for me. They could be anyone.

It’s a pretty easy rule for me to follow. Talking to strangers was never really at the top of my to-do list. It would be like instructing someone that, no matter what they do, they mustn’t deliberately bang their toe on the coffee table.

“What are your plans for the day?” Sally asked me at the dinner table one morning.

She acted like she did it because she was interested in me, but I knew why she was really asking. It was one of her endless ways of keeping tabs on me. I don’t mind. I never have plans to do anything I shouldn’t.

“Just off to the library again,” I replied with a smile. I liked the library. It was quiet. No one expected you to talk. My communication by notepad was well received there.

“They’ll be happy to see the greatest follower of library etiquette that ever lived,” chuckled Jessie. She always made that joke, and they always both laughed far too loudly at it.

I didn’t find it funny. My library etiquette is one of the things I’m most proud of. Some kids in that place are feral. I want so badly to yell at them to shut up, but a child is still a stranger. There’s no age restriction on it. So I express my disgust with my eyes, and with sassy remarks written on a notepad that I keep to myself.

“Have you read anything interesting lately?” Sally asked. Again, not because she cared about my reading habits, but just another way of making sure I’m staying in the straight and narrow.

“Always,” I smiled. “I found a book on Breton folklore.”

Both Sally and Jessie looked at me as if they wanted more. I was happy to oblige. Once I left the house, I wouldn’t be able to utter a word. Might as well get as many out whilst I can.

“Well, Brittany was settled by Brittonic Celts. They’re closely related to the Welsh and Cornish.” I stopped and tapped my nose. That’s my way of saying sorry in the outside world. I apologise a lot, so sometimes it’s just muscle memory.

I was saying sorry because I have a tendency to info-dump at the breakfast table. By the time I actually get to what I wanted to talk about, everyone has to go. Get on with their lives.

I looked at the clock. I had four minutes. Six if I followed them from the kitchen to the front door. Spoke until they both walked out.

“Basically, Breton folklore is Celtic, but not the same as Irish or Scottish myth. Less heroic. More inevitable,” I said, as quickly as possible, trying to squeeze it all in. I was still doing too much. Just the relevant information.

“So, there’s this thing called the Ankou,” I said, straight to the point. “It’s kind of like Death personified. The Ankou calls names at night. If you hear your name and you answer, you’re screwed.”

I took a big bite of my cereal for dramatic effect and continued with my mouth full of Coco Pops.

“No chase. No violence. Just recognition.” I smiled. “The Ankou doesn’t kill. It announces.”

Sally and Jessie looked at one another, concern written clearly on both their faces. They worry my interests might be too violent.

I spent the last four minutes telling them other stories from Breton folklore. Ones that were a lot less scary, to put their minds at ease.

**\*\*\***

My journey to the library takes me along back streets and alleyways. It adds thirteen minutes to the trip, but it’s worth it for the solitude. I can’t be tempted to chat if there’s no one to chat to. Ironically, seclusion is my only companion. A necessary, platonic evil.

Sorry, before I continue, I should probably tell you about myself. I’ve never really chatted before, so I’m not very good at it.

My name is Logan, and I’m twenty years old. I’m just like any normal guy who isn’t allowed to talk to anyone other than the two women he lives with.

I spend the majority of my muted life at the library. I read everything I can. Recently, I’ve been getting into myths and folklore. When you read stories passed down across generations and empires, you start to notice the same ones being told again and again.

A good example is the classic child taken at night story. A nocturnal figure who comes for children while adults sleep.

Ancient Mesopotamia had Lamashtu, a demoness who stole infants. Ancient Greece had Mormo, a child-devouring female monster. Medieval Europe had the Night Hag. Victorian England warned children about Spring-Heeled Jack. Hollywood, modern folklore, gave us Freddy Krueger. A monster who haunts children in their dreams.

The same story, formed as separate thoughts across time and space.

Empires change.

Technology does too.

Human fear doesn’t.

Just as I finished that last thought, someone dragged me back to reality.

“Oi, mate!”

I looked up. Three boys, no older than fourteen, staring at me.

I stared back. Not to be intimidating. I just didn’t know what else to do. Once I realised the accidental menace, I dropped my gaze.

“Are you deaf, mate?” asked the tallest of the three.

He looked like a box-standard teenage boy. 

However, his eyes looked decrepit. All of their eyes did. Like they had lived four times longer than the faces they sat in.

I shook my head and pointed to my mouth. I hoped it would convey all the information they needed not to beat me up.

“Is this dickhead broken?” asked the shortest of the gang, bringing absolute delight to the other two.

I was fairly confident now that this was going to end extremely badly for me. Any attempt at recovery felt like a hopeless endeavour.

I pulled out my notepad and pen, ready to write what would need to be the greatest thing ever penned.

“Look, guys,” the tall one said, pointing both index fingers at me, “he wants an autograph!”

The alley filled with sniggering. It was sharp, and it poked me in the eyes. To be fair, it was pretty quick-witted for something that looked like a prepubescent pensioner.

I showed them my scribbled note. One of them read it out loud. Perhaps the other two were unable to read. What a great friend.

“I am mute. I’m sorry for the inconvenience.”

He let out a huge sigh afterwards. It seemed to really take it out of him.

The not-the-tallest-not-the-shortest one looked at me like I’d just told him exactly what his mum’s toilet seat tasted of.

“Mute?” he said, as if questioning the entire existence of the concept. “What, like you had your tongue cut out?”

He looked genuinely interested. And extremely serious.

“Like they do to pedos?”

They all looked absolutely repulsed, and extremely excited by this new revelation.

I was pretty convinced that wasn’t true. Tongues were cut out for many reasons. Blasphemy. Snitching. No one cut the tongues out of paedophiles.

I tried my hardest to write this explanation down, but I didn’t even know where to start.

“Are you a pedo?” the tall one asked.

I shook my head.

“Answer him then,” the short one demanded. “Are you a pedo?”

Before even someone with the luxury of speech could have replied, they asked again.

“Are you a pedo?”

And again.

“Are you a pedo?”

I frantically scribbled no on the paper, over and over again. They either didn’t see it, or didn’t care.

They moved towards me.

My body burned with an anxious fire, the smoke making it hard to breathe.

I showed them the notepad again. The tall one knocked it away.

I backed up until my shoulders pressed against the brick wall. It was starting to feel like my tomb.

I had nowhere to go.

They smiled. Looked at one another. Waiting for someone to finish me off.

The small one stepped forward.

“Are you a pedo?”

My skin burned. My blood tore through my body. There was a pain in my stomach, like pins stabbing me from the inside. Something was happening. I felt full. Like I was going to burst.

“No,” I whispered. Barely loud enough for them to hear.

I tried to scrape the word back into my mouth. Make it so it didn’t happen.

They froze. Staring at everything and nothing.

Maybe I could leave.

I walked away slowly.

They followed.

I stopped. They stopped.

I moved again. So did they.

They weren’t chasing me.

They were following me.

I ran. They ran after me.

I kept running. So did they.

I saw a bus and jumped on just as the doors were closing.

I smiled at the driver and tapped my nose. He wasn’t as keen to smile back.

I saw one of the boys approaching the bus too quickly.

My inner voice was screaming at the driver to go. I was relieved it wasn’t out loud.

We drove off.

The boys kept running as they grew smaller and smaller.

\*\*\*

As I sat on the bus trying to catch my breath, replaying the bizarre scenes that had just unfolded, a memory forced its way to the front of my mind, as if it were of utmost importance that I paid attention to it.

I was about twelve. I’d just made, and subsequently spilled, a pot noodle on the rug in Sally’s office. I wasn’t even allowed in there. I didn’t even have a reason to be, despite not being allowed to be. I have no idea why I thought eating a sloppy, messy snack in a designated no-go area was such a wise move. Turns out my decision-making skills were at the same level as my ability to hold hot plastic things.

I needed to clean it up before they got back. As I pulled the rug aside to check nothing had soaked through, I saw something written in black on the wooden floor.

When I pulled the entire rug back, I saw the whole space was scrawled with the same eight words, over and over again:

**Þū ne scalt bēodan. Wē ne sculon fylgian.**

I didn’t know it at the time, but I later found out it was written in Old English. Specifically, West Saxon. It translates as:

**You shall not command. We shall not follow.**

I’d never been sure what that message had to do with me. Now, having just been followed by three boys, it really did slap me in the face with an open palm of relevance.

I never asked Sally or Jessie about it. Their default answer was always the same. They couldn’t tell me more than I already knew, but it was for my own good.

All I knew was that scary, important people wanted me, and that any use of my voice outside the house would alert them to my whereabouts.

A cavalcade of myths and folklore began to churn through my brain. Any that felt even vaguely relevant to whatever the hell was going on were mentally highlighted for further research at the library.

Then something pulled me back from my internal research papers.

I could feel eyes on me.

I looked up, expecting to see Tall, Medium, and Small standing there.

They weren’t.

Instead, three school kids, one boy and two girls, were all looking in my direction. I’m not sure they even realised they were staring. It didn’t feel like staring at all.

It felt like waiting.

Like they were expecting an instruction from me.

I stared straight forward for the rest of the journey.

I got off at the stop closest to the library. Thankfully, the school kids didn’t follow me. I could still feel their eyes as I stepped onto the pavement. They were asking something of me. Demanding it.

I had no idea what it was about, but I can guarantee it was all linked. If it wasn’t, that would be mental.

\*\*\*

As I approached the library, I could hear laboured breathing behind me. I turned and saw Tall, Medium, and Large. Red-faced and uncomfortably out of breath, but still giving everything they had left to keep following me.

When they reached me, they stopped.

Waiting.

I needed answers. I’d already spoken to them once. I could do it once more. Get all the information I possibly could.

“Why are you following me?” I whispered, loud enough for only them to hear.

They didn’t answer. They just stared through me.

A shuffle to my left caught my attention. I hadn’t noticed them before, but two girls, around thirteen, were sitting on a bench just behind me. I’m not sure if they heard my voice, or if they just knew I’d spoken, but they stood and joined the three boys.

I now had five young teenagers following me. This did little to dispel the recent rumours about me.

I cursed my stupidity inwardly, making sure no sound slipped past my lips.

I walked into the library.

So did they.

As I passed the librarian’s desk, she looked up and said, “Look at you, like the Pied Piper.”

Internally, I screamed, you don’t know the half of it. But in the madness of it all, a muffled scoff escaped my tightly shut mouth.

That noise was enough.

Every child enjoying a quiet afternoon in the library turned towards me.

Kids ranging from seven to sixteen began moving closer. They surrounded me, a fortress of adolescence.

“What’s going on?” the librarian yelled. “Everyone, go sit back down.”

No one moved. No one even turned to face her. They all just stared at me.

Some parents tried to reach their children, but were pushed back by the wall of school kids. They screamed names and surged forward, only to be held at bay by the shifting mass of minors.

I kept walking towards the folklore section.

So did they.

I grabbed a stack of books and sat down. The children closed in around me. No one broke ranks. There must have been thirty of them on all sides.

If I was looking for a silver lining, it was good to see so many children appreciating books.

No one could reach me inside this youth bubble. It was the safest I had ever felt.

The most loved.

I tore through the books, searching for something I was sure I remembered.

The noise beyond my living walls was muffled, but it felt frantic. People shouting. Possibly people getting hurt.

Then I found it.

Psychopomp.

A being who leads souls away from the living world.

There are plenty of examples. The Pied Piper being the obvious one. The Greeks had Hermes. The Egyptians called theirs Anubis. In Germanic folklore, the Wild Huntsman led children away with horns, hounds, and shouting.

With each one, sound is both warning and summons.

Mercury. Valkyries. Willy Wonka. Pennywise.

The list keeps growing.

None of them kidnap. They are followed willingly. The method isn’t coercion so much as recognition. They hear something meant for them.

I thought about Sally and Jessie. My heart sank. The swarm tightened around me. They had kept this from me, not because they wanted to help me, but because they were scared of me.

It was never love.

It was fear.

This was love.

Maybe I’m not one of them.

Maybe I’m all of them.

The thing that inspired the stories.

I needed answers. Sally and Jessie knew more than these books.

I stood up.

My living armour rose with me.

Outside, a crowd had gathered. Four or five police cars. Officers shouting. All trying to stop me.

I needed more.

I opened the window and shouted to the world, “Excuse me, can I get a little help?”

Among cries of disbelief and nervous laughter, the crowd began to shift. Children emerged from between adults. All turning towards me.

All listening.

They heard something meant for them.

They heard me.

I’m a 29M working in IT and staying in Powai. I’ve been working from home since the lockdown and was thinking of switching things up by working from a co-working space like WeWork.

Before joining, I wanted to check if anyone here would be interested in working together sometimes. Could be a nice way to meet new people, understand what others are working on, and have some company during the workday.

Nothing too formal - just working, coffee breaks, and general conversations.

If you’re around Powai or nearby and this sounds interesting, feel free to comment.",1,1769871490.0,powai,0,1.0,False

Starbucks is a global premium coffeehouse retailer with three main profit engines:

* North America (primary earnings driver)**:** company-operated stores (high revenue, high labor intensity) plus licensed stores. In Q1 FY26, North America generated $7.28B revenue and $867M operating income (operating margin 11.9%).
* International (growth + mix benefits, but structurally more volatile): a blend of company-operated and licensed; China is a key swing market. Q1 FY26 International revenue $2.06B, operating income $283M, margin 13.7%.
* Channel Development (CPG/RTD + partnerships): packaged coffee/ready-to-drink, including the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé. Smaller revenue base but very high segment margin (still subject to product cost/mix). Q1 FY26 revenue $523M, operating income $216M, margin 41.3%.

What's important to remember here is that the key operating KPI for the market is “comp sales” (same-store sales), driven by transactions (traffic) and ticket (price/mix). Starbucks’ moat is brand + convenience + store density + digital/loyalty. How strong is it? That's questionable. I'm European so I can't say much about US coffee culture, but from what I've seen here and heard about over there - there's a lot of specialty and value players keeping pressure on Starbucks' traffic. Still, everybody knows Starbucks and, surprisingly, even the Italians I know enjoy Starbucks' coffee so there is something to the company.

# Recent news

What changed coming out of the latest print (Q1 FY26 ended Dec 28, 2025):

* “Back to Starbucks” is improving the top line (traffic is back, boys!): Global comparable sales +4%, driven by transactions +3% and ticket +1%. U.S./North America comps also +4% with transactions +3% - notable because traffic had been the weak spot.
* China structure change: Starbucks agreed to form a JV with Boyu Capital to operate China retail; Boyu to acquire up to 60%, Starbucks retains 40% and continues to own/license the brand/IP. Closing targeted spring, subject to approvals. IMO, that's good positioning for the long-term since China is obviously a big market, plus. 
* Leadership/tech push: Anand Varadarajan appointed CTO (effective Jan 19, 2026), but it remains to see what his impact will be.
* Investor Day timing: hosted Jan 29, 2026 (one day after earnings) to frame the multi-year plan.

# Financials (for Q1 FY26)

**P&L snapshot (Q1 FY26)**

* Net revenues: $9.9B (+\~6%).
* GAAP operating margin: 9.0% (down 290 bps YoY), blamed on labor investments + inflation, “largely driven by elevated coffee pricing and tariffs.”
* EPS: GAAP $0.26 vs $0.69 prior year; Non-GAAP $0.56 (down 19%).
* Tax distortion: GAAP effective tax rate was an eye-watering 61.7% (vs 23.6%)—driven largely by tax impacts from changing “indefinite reinvestment” assertions tied to China being held for sale.

**A few notes:**

* Good**:** traffic-led comp recovery across NA and China - people are going back to Starbucks! Plus, international operating margin expanded.
* Bad: 1) North America margin compression is severe (from 16.7% down to 11.9%), and 2) Channel margin also fell from 47.7% down to 41.3%.

Basically*:* Starbucks is spending (labor + operational changes) to get traffic back, while also eating cost inflation - so earnings lag the revenue improvement.

**Cash flow & balance sheet (risk reality)**

* Operating cash flow: $1.598B for the quarter; capex \~$324M meaning a rough quarterly FCF \~$1.27B (before lease economics).
* Dividends declared: $0.62/share (cash outlay $706M for the quarter).
* Share repurchases: none in Q1; 29.8M shares still authorized. 
* Leverage / equity: Starbucks has a shareholders’ deficit (negative equity) thanks to its aggressive buyback history, but it makes the company more vulnerable in a downturn.

**Management guidance (the forward-looking anchor)**

For FY2026, Starbucks guided to:

* Global & U.S. comparable sales growth ≥3%
* Net revenues growth similar (\~3%+)
* Non-GAAP operating margin slightly up YoY
* Non-GAAP EPS $2.15–$2.40

Not a massive growth guidance, but the good thing here is the same-store recovery! FY2024 and FY2025 same-store sales were down 2% and 1% respectively so it's good to see change in positive direction.

# Valuation

Right now, given the current price of $91.95 and FY26 non-GAAP EPS guide of **$2.15–$2.40**, the forward PE is 38 to 43. That's a lot and it's telling me that investors are banking on a turnaround (meaning we could see a massive drop if it doesn't materialise).

Basically, we're looking for more growth, better margins and optimistic guidance. We haven't seen it yet, but we're slowly going in that direction if the labor/ops spend continues to normalize and traffic stays positive.

Analysts are forecasting 28.18% EPS growth in 2027 and 20.3% in 2028 so a lot is banking on future earnings recovery. The problem is that there's basically no margin of safety so take everything about SBUX with a very big grain of salt. It could go either way especially if we see a recession, worsening consumer economics or drop in same-store sales next quarter. SBUX's 5yr average forward PE has been 30.8-31.4 so a quick reversion to the mean would lead to a 20% plunge down easily.

**Technical**

A quick look at the technical indicators shows that we've got a good resistance at \~$87-88:

* 50D MA \~87.83
* 200D MA \~87.34
* RSI \~52 (neutral)

If the stock drop below that, we could enter nasty territory. 

# Dividend

* Quarterly dividend: $0.62/share (annualized $2.48).
* Yield at \~$91.95: \~2.7% ($2.48 payout).
* Next ex-div date: payable Feb 27, 2026 to holders of record Feb 13, 2026.

The dividend looks serviceable because cash flow still covers it, but the payout ratio on GAAP earnings looks ugly this year due to the tax distortion and restructuring items.

# Potential risks or catalysts

**Near-term catalysts (next 4 weeks)**

* Dividend record date (Feb 13) + pay date (Feb 27): mild technical support, but not thesis-changing.
* Post–Investor Day digestion**:** if the market decides FY26 guide is conservative and the reset is “ahead of schedule,” multiple can stay elevated; if not, you can get multiple compression quickly.

Key risks

* Margin recovery risk**:** US margin contraction is real, and management explicitly cites labor investments and coffee/tariff inflation. If costs stay elevated longer, EPS rebound gets delayed, meaning investors get impatient and start dropping the shares, leading to pain for bagholders.
* China execution/regulatory risk**:** the JV (held-for-sale accounting/tax impacts) adds complexity to the mix. It's expected to close in the spring, we'll see how that will be valued and reflected in the price.
* Credit/financial flexibility**:** S&P assigned BBB+ on an issue which is not ideal. Still investment grade, but barely. Fitch previously affirmed BBB, but withdrew coverage in 2022. Moody’s has flagged pressure from weaker profitability/credit metrics and their outlook is negative as of 2025.
* Valuation risk**:** with a \~40× forward P/E on FY26 guide, the stock is priced for a turnaround. If we don't see that, there could be massive drops. Like I mentioned above, the mean FWD PE is \~31, that'll be a 20% drop, but stocks usually overshoot on the negative when that happens so it could be more and that's if EPS remains the same. If it goes negative for whatever reason... there will be blood in the streets. On the bright side, that would be a great time to buy.

# Conclusion

* The good part is that traffic is back (U.S. comps +4% led by transactions), revenue is growing, and FY26 guidance is steady (EPS $2.15–$2.40).
* The bad part is that  margins are still compressing hard and the stock is not cheap on forward earnings with implied \~38-43 FWD PE so there's no margin of safety.

I sold out of the stock at $88, I could've held a bit longer, but I honestly expected them to drop again. If they fall down to $70-75, I'd buy a bit. I'd buy hard at the $60s level, but I doubt we'll see that, they do have a strong name and presence.

Right now, they're too risky for me and with everything going on in the US, it's hard to bet strong on Starbucks. There are simply way better options, but I'm keeping an eye because there is potential here.",1,1769871445.0,investingforbeginners,1,1.0,False

# How a solo developer made a very beloved blind-accessible cozy café game

## Who am I

Hi! My name is Asaf (or YofiAsi). I am the creator of ‘[Barista](https://yofiasi.itch.io/barista)’, which got to second place in last year’s jam.

I’m a 28 year old programmer from Israel. Video games have held a special place in my heart since I was a little kid. My recent favorite games are Sekiro, Hollow Knight, Satisfactory, Metal: Hellsinger, and the list keeps going…

I started making my own games a bit more than a year ago, just doing lots of game jams.

## Before The Jam

The ‘Games for blind gamers’ Jam was my 4th jam, and I joined it for the challenge. I knew nothing about accessibility and had no idea that blind people played video games. That’s why I wanted to explore this unknown territory.


Thanks to the jam discord server, it was easy to find lots of information about accessibility in games. I learned that an accessible game doesn’t mean that the game has no visuals. Lots of games are accessible through settings and modifications. But all this new information got me dizzy. That’s why, when thinking of an idea for a game, it was easier for me to limit myself to one that uses zero visuals. I thought to myself, if I can make a good game with only sound, it will automatically fit the jam. Eventually, I did add some minimal visuals to the game, but it was after the core game mechanics were done.

## Making The Game

The jam is a month long, but it took me almost two weeks to make up my mind on an idea I liked. It came to me while making coffee at home, thinking about the ceremonial and relaxing feeling of making the same sequence of actions over and over again (I got a professional coffee machine at home thanks to my coffee-lover roommate).

That’s when I started prototyping, and the development of the game went pretty smoothly.

Honestly, It’s been a year since I made this game, and a lot happened this year, so I don’t remember much of the development process. But I do remember that I barely play-tested the game, which was a mistake. Fortunately, the jam allows changes during the voting period, so I got a lot of feedback from players and made changes and fixes in this time window.
In the next jam I will try to use the great community of the jam to get some feedback during the jam, especially blind play-testers.

The most important feedback points I got were being able to listen to the order again, being able to save the progress of the game, and skipping the tutorial (for a second playthrough).

The vision for the game was way bigger than what it eventually turned out to be. And the game was submitted unfinished because of several unexpected hazards. Surprisingly (to me), I got a lot of love and positive feedback from the players and community, which really warmed my heart. That was a good lesson for me - that it’s okay when things don’t turn out perfect or exactly as I planned them.

My best advice for this jam would probably be:

* Use the wonderful community for help.

* Do your best in sound design. 99% of my SFX were found on “freesound.org”, but I did lots of mixing, editing, and tweaking in order to make them fit the vibe I wanted.

* Play the game yourself without any visuals. I added a debug key to toggle it on and off, and it helped me understand better what needs improving.

I really enjoyed participating in the jam. It made me think of games from a different point of view. No doubt that it made me a better game developer.
So if you are a game dev and thinking about taking part in it, I 100% recommend it. 

Not long ago I decided that I want to create a complete version of the game with the vision I had for it at the beginning, which includes more mechanics and stories of customers that the player experiences through the point of view of a barista. I created a small team with a musician and a writer, and soon we’ll release a new demo for the game for you to try out :)

Thank you for reading <3

Not inspired, just tired. My reality looked a lot more like 20 minutes of actual focused work, 10 minutes of ""just checking"" email, 5 minutes of doom-scrolling, then another 15 minutes trying to remember what I was doing. I was busy, but definitely not productive.

For a long time, I beat myself up about it. I tried every ""hack"" – the strict Pomodoro timers, the ""no distractions"" apps that just made me resent my phone, the ""just power through"" mindset. What did I get? Burnout, a feeling of inadequacy, and a mountain of half-finished tasks. It felt like everyone else had this ""focus muscle"" I just didn't possess.

My goal wasn't to work 12 hours a day. It was simpler: I wanted to consistently get *one or two blocks* of truly deep, uninterrupted work done, and not feel completely drained afterward. So, I stopped looking for miracle cures and started my own messy, slow-burn experiment.

Here's what I've learned and what's actually started to stick over the past few months:

*   **Ditching the ""Heroic"" Deep Work Fantasy (Months 1-2):**
    *   **What I tried (and failed at):** Aiming for 2-3 hour ""flow state"" sessions from day one. I'd sit down, get overwhelmed, and quit after 45 minutes, feeling like a failure.
    *   **The honest pivot:** I started with **Micro-Deep Work sessions: a maximum of 40 minutes, twice a day.** Non-negotiable, pre-planned tasks only. If I hit 30 minutes and felt my focus waver, I'd end it. The key was consistency, not duration.
    *   **Tools:** A simple physical notebook for *one* pre-selected task per session. I used the Forest app (or just a regular kitchen timer) to keep track of time.
    *   **Investment:** 80 minutes of intentional focus daily.
    *   **Result:** For the first 6 weeks, I averaged around 60-70 minutes of *actual* deep work per day across those two slots. It wasn't groundbreaking, but it was *consistent* – I hit my target sessions about 80% of the time, something I'd never done before. I wasn't dreading it.

*   **Tuning into My Energy, Not Just the Clock (Months 3-4):**
    *   **Observation:** I noticed my focus wasn't linear. Mornings (after coffee, before email chaos) were great. Late afternoons were a struggle.
    *   **Adjustment:** I shifted my first Micro-Deep Work block to 9:00 AM and the second to 2:30 PM. I also started protecting these times like a hawk, literally putting ""Deep Work"" on my calendar. I learned that sometimes, a 20-minute power nap or a walk was *more* productive than forcing another focused session.
    *   **Environment:** Invested in decent noise-canceling headphones. Even if there's no music, the quiet signals to my brain it's focus time.
    *   **Result:** The *quality* of my focus improved dramatically. I was now getting about 75-80 minutes of truly engaged work in each 40-minute block on average. The mental strain felt significantly lower.

*   **Sustainable Iteration, Not Perfection (Months 5-Present - 87+ Days Strong):**
    *   **Method refinement:** The 40-minute block is still my default, but I'm flexible. Some days it's 30, some days it's 60. The ""rule"" became: *start the session*. The duration will sort itself out. If I miss a day (which happens!), I just pick it up the next. No guilt.
    *   **""Accountability"" (informal):** I started telling a friend (who's also working on focus) what my ""deep work tasks"" were for the day. No formal check-ins, just the act of stating my intention made a difference.
    *   **Current Metrics:** I'm consistently getting 1.5 to 2 hours of truly deep, focused work done each day. This is up from a very sporadic 20-30 minutes before, and crucially, I'm not ending the day feeling mentally fried. This isn't about grinding 24/7; it's about intentional, high-quality focus that allows for better rest and enjoyment of the rest of my day.
    *   **Limitation/Realistic Expectation:** This isn't a ""you'll never be distracted again"" plan. Distractions still happen. The difference is I now have a reliable system to *return* to focus, and I've built the resilience to not let a minor derailment completely send me off the rails for the rest of the day.

This slow, iterative process, focused on realistic minimums and energy management, has been the only thing that's truly stuck for me. It's messy, it's not always perfect, but it's *mine* and it's working.

* Non-GAAP EPS $2.15–$2.40

Not a massive growth guidance, but the good thing here is the same-store recovery! FY2024 and FY2025 same-store sales were down 2% and 1% respectively so it's good to see change in positive direction.

# Valuation

Right now, given the current price of $91.95 and FY26 non-GAAP EPS guide of **$2.15–$2.40**, the forward PE is 38 to 43. That's a lot and it's telling me that investors are banking on a turnaround (meaning we could see a massive drop if it doesn't materialise).

Basically, we're looking for more growth, better margins and optimistic guidance. We haven't seen it yet, but we're slowly going in that direction if the labor/ops spend continues to normalize and traffic stays positive.

Analysts are forecasting 28.18% EPS growth in 2027 and 20.3% in 2028 so a lot is banking on future earnings recovery. The problem is that there's basically no margin of safety so take everything about SBUX with a very big grain of salt. It could go either way especially if we see a recession, worsening consumer economics or drop in same-store sales next quarter. SBUX's 5yr average forward PE has been 30.8-31.4 so a quick reversion to the mean would lead to a 20% plunge down easily.

**Technical**

A quick look at the technical indicators shows that we've got a good resistance at \~$87-88:

* 50D MA \~87.83
* 200D MA \~87.34
* RSI \~52 (neutral)

If the stock drop below that, we could enter nasty territory. Having said that, the 52W low is at $75.5 so that will probably act as the next support level.

# Dividend

* Quarterly dividend: $0.62/share (annualized $2.48).
* Yield at \~$91.95: \~2.7% ($2.48 payout).
* Next ex-div date: payable Feb 27, 2026 to holders of record Feb 13, 2026.

The dividend looks serviceable because cash flow still covers it, but the payout ratio on GAAP earnings looks ugly this year due to the tax distortion and restructuring items.

# Potential risks or catalysts

**Near-term catalysts (next 4 weeks)**

* Dividend record date (Feb 13) + pay date (Feb 27): mild technical support, but not thesis-changing.
* Post–Investor Day digestion: if the market decides FY26 guide is conservative and the reset is “ahead of schedule,” multiple can stay elevated; if not, you can get multiple compression quickly.

Key risks

* Margin recovery risk: US margin contraction is real, and management explicitly cites labor investments and coffee/tariff inflation. If costs stay elevated longer, EPS rebound gets delayed, meaning investors get impatient and start dropping the shares, leading to pain for bagholders.
* China execution/regulatory risk: the JV (held-for-sale accounting/tax impacts) adds complexity to the mix. It's expected to close in the spring, we'll see how that will be valued and reflected in the price.
* Credit/financial flexibility: S&P assigned BBB+ on an issue which is not ideal. Still investment grade, but barely. Fitch previously affirmed BBB, but withdrew coverage in 2022. Moody’s has flagged pressure from weaker profitability/credit metrics and their outlook is negative as of 2025.
* Valuation risk: with a \~40× forward P/E on FY26 guide, the stock is priced for a turnaround. If we don't see that, there could be massive drops. Like I mentioned above, the mean FWD PE is \~31, that'll be a 20% drop, but stocks usually overshoot on the negative when that happens so it could be more and that's if EPS remains the same. If it goes negative for whatever reason... there will be blood in the streets. On the bright side, that would be a great time to buy.

# Conclusion

* The good part is that traffic is back (U.S. comps +4% led by transactions), revenue is growing, and FY26 guidance is steady (EPS $2.15–$2.40).
* The bad part is that  margins are still compressing hard and the stock is not cheap on forward earnings with implied \~38-43 FWD PE so there's no margin of safety.

I sold out of the stock at $88, I could've held a bit longer, but I honestly expected them to drop again. If they fall down to $70-75, I'd buy a bit. I'd buy hard at the $60s level, but I doubt we'll see that, they do have a strong name and presence.

Right now, they're too risky for me and with everything going on in the US, it's hard to bet strong on Starbucks. There are simply way better options, but I'm keeping an eye because there is potential here.",2,1769871067.0,dividendclub,2,1.0,False

1qs46q4,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1qs46q4/inlaws_visits_and_health_crises/,In-laws visits and health crises,"I’m posting here in part to vent but also to hear about other people’s experiences with this kind of behavior. So, I gave birth to my first child around 2.5 months ago. It was a difficult delivery but didn’t need instruments or an emergency section or anything, but still. Baby was quite big and labor was long and really intense. I was surprised — i feel foolish for this now honestly — at just how not-normal i felt for weeks after. I also have an autoimmune illness for which i take, and took during pregnancy, a medication that can suppress the immune system. I was also hospitalized twice during this pregnancy for flares related to this condition. For that reason i had already fielded my in-laws very early planning of visits (including their plans for a family Christmas at our place, a month after my due date, etc) by explaining that we/the medical community weren’t  sure of this baby’s immune state in the first couple months after birth (what with my treatment during pregnancy, and being born during flu season on top of that) and that we didn’t want visitors in those early weeks and potentially until his first vaccination. I explained that I’d rather be too careful than not careful enough, plus there was my own immune compromise to take into account in post partum and the possibility that my illness might flare after that hormone crash. They tried to argue but I stood firm — this was all over the summer, when I was around 5 months pregnant. For the rest of my pregnancy when we saw them intermittently they regularly joked about needing to find out what hospital I’d be delivering at, made comments about my weight gain, etc. All this when my condition put me and baby at risk of low birthweight and/or being born pre-ter, and I had been honestly concerningly thin before getting pregnant. 

Once baby was born i sent them some photos once my partner had told them the news (maybe 2 days post partum as we had genuinely been concerned they’d show up uninvited if they knew I was in labor). Five minutes later they were on the phone with SO asking to come see us the day we got home. I got on the phone and once again explained my health concerns, that i would be convalescing for a few weeks and the delivery had gone well but was hard, as was breastfeeding. We’d already talked about this I said, politely, to which they responded that they’d forgotten. When we got home from the hospital, they called again demanding to come visit a few days later. They kept arguing with SO on the phone, and this time I asked to speak to them and flew off the handle in a way I don’t regret. I explained point blank that their presence was stressful, they’d demonstrated negligible concern for my health during pregnancy and were doing the same in post partum. I said the more they tried to push the boundary, the longer they would be waiting. That’s when MIL explained she’d talked about (the very little she knew of) my medical history to her gynecologist (not the relevant speciality) and her doctor apparently said I was being excessive. 

A couple weeks later my condition flared as I had feared and I got a very serious infection requiring numerous hospitalisations and surgeries. I’ve now been to the OR four times in the last month, a fifth and hopefully last go is scheduled next week. My mother flew out urgently from the country she lives in and, incidentally, met the baby, but had of course come to be with me on the hospital and help my partner at home. The in-laws meanwhile say they hope I feel better soon, etc., but spent these weeks angling to come have coffee with my mother, whom they haven’t met and who they were « curious » about they said (and with whom they wouldn’t have been able communicate due to language barriers), while I hadn’t even been discharged yet. My SO said he didn’t think it was a good idea/the right time, they pushed him to — quote — test the waters on it anyway. My mother of course had no interest and I told them off again. Now I’m awaiting surgery again next week, hopefully the last, and today MIL sent SO a « I need to talk to you » text, only to go on about how hard it is for them not to have met the baby yet, regardless of the condition I’ve been in. I’ve told them and my SO that I don’t want to see them but I won’t block them organizing a meeting (lol) with the baby while I keep a low profile. The timeline for meeting that we discussed has progressed and baby is vaccinated. But at this point they’ve been so flippant about my serious health problems in post partum that my SO doesn’t want to see them either. 

Part of me feels like I’ve driven a wedge between family members with my insistance early on on protecting my potentially fragile newborn’s immune system and my own health, but I asked time and time again how he felt about it all and he always has told me he agrees with this prudent approach. I also can’t help but feel that my health is consistently brushed off by these people in a way that is triggering for me honestly, and makes me not trust them. Their pushing has compounded boundary issues that already existed between my SO and his family. It’s clear or seems clear that they really do not care about what an outrageously difficult hand this period has dealt both myself and my SO, along with the literal pain and suffering I’m hopefully reaching the end of soon. I was literally trying to write a letter to my baby in the hospital in case I died a few weeks ago. Angling for a social visit with my mother out of « curiosity » at that time, when I was still in the hospital felt like a crystallization of either how ignorant they are, or how totally superfluous I am as the mother of their grandson. Its jarring, we didn’t expect this when we moved (a bit) closer to them from the capital where we used to live.

I can’t imagine ever being totally over and cool with their attitude toward my health, but am I taking this too personally/main-character-y on my own end ? Does anyone else have stories of the in laws being super flippant about your health ? How did that worked out in the scheme of family ties more widely ?",1,1769870749.0,beyondthebump,1,1.0,False

Nettle's Notes Day 14: After a much-needed break after Whitney's Gym, we took our time going around the land picking Apricorns and making it to Ecruteak City. We weren't there long, however, as we went right past it to pick up some more Pokemon. Specifically, Sherb caught a Meowth and brought him back to the Daycare to hang out with Trixie. After enough time had passed, they laid some eggs and out came a bunch of smaller Aipoms. One of those Aipoms, Teanie, was chosen by Sherb to be our next team member. Seems a bit unfair to Trixie and Trinity that they won't be permanent team members, but I know they'll be cheering Teanie on the whole way. Welcome to the team, Teanie.  
  
Agate's Album Day 13: Finally, we have a new team member on our side, and it's another girl. Teanie the Aipom is her name, and she is just the cutest. Trixie and a Meowth went to the Daycare and laid a bunch of eggs. It's a bit strange that those two were that compatible seeing as they didn't like each other at first, but that's beside the point. A new member of Team Nettle has joined the fray.

Trixie: Yeah, and a certain somebody better pay child support.  
Adam: I can make money appear out of thin air, so don't you worry one bit, honey.  
Nettle: **looks at Teanie** We're counting on you, Teanie. I know you'll do great things for us.  
Agate: We'll have your back the whole way through. You're going to be a star.  
Teanie: **looks at Agate** ... Mama?  
Trixie: WHAT, I'm your mama!

Lapis: Y-Yes? It's just so beautiful. **kneels down to meet Teanie's eyes** Hey there, how are you?  
Teanie: ... Mama!  
Nettle: You'd better train her quickly, Trixie.  
Trixie: Yup. **takes Teanie back from Agate** Give us until tomorrow and she should be able to form sentences.  
Trinity: You should also bring us some coffee, too. We might be at this for a while.

Emile: Well joke's on you because Agate just evolved! Agate: Graveler! Tim: Okay then. Still not holding back. Claire: Best of luck to both of you. Let's begin. Emile: So I've always wondered how each different Pokemon dates a totally other Pokemon and makes a baby that's not otherwise their child or the fact that make a different Pokemon that has nothing to do with how the two look and also has different quirks based on the family it came from. Claire: I don't know the best answer for you there. Tim: It might have to do with the fact that the child might end up being who don't expect them to be. Emile: Like it's their child and they treat it like it's a normal part of Pokemon life. Tim: Probably best if that question doesn't get answered. Looks over to see Miltank fainted Aw, dang it. Emile: Haha! I knew you couldn't resist casual conversation! Claire: And the winner is... Emile! Emile: Alright, where to next? Tim: Ecruteak City, I believe. Emile: Okay, but first...

There was a house lizard on the wall today and there was a bucket full of cleaning fluid (my mother makes her own, Idk why) right below it. I went into the kitchen to make coffee and maybe that scared the lizard, it slipped and fell right in it...


He struggled and did his best to come out and I just stood there and watched... I did nothing. I wanted to do something and my mind was screaming, telling my body to move but I just couldn't... I just watched. I was able to muster some courage and was about to grab a paper or something but by the time I could think of something... It was already dead. 

I feel very shitty about this. I could have prevented its death but I was nothing but a useless coward. In my eyes all lifes are equal, I'd like to think the value of humans and any living things are the same. I'm not vegan or anything tho, I may eat a living animal and when I die I'll return to soil and become food for plants, so I guess it's fine.

 However, I don't like useless deaths, killing animals for sport or just fun... I don't think that's good. Today, I was responsible for the lizards death, I scared it and it slipped in the cleaning supplies, I had every chance to save it but I was just too scared to move. I just keep thinking... What if this happened to my dog? Would I still have reacted the same way? I don't know.

It’s one of those head-scratching moments that can make you feel like you've done everything right—yet nothing connects. But here’s the good news: most VPN key issues are caused by simple mistakes that are easy to fix once you know what to look for. Whether you're using a phone, laptop, or tablet, these quick checks and fixes will get you back online and secure in no time.

**1. Double-Check the VPN Key**

Sounds basic, but it’s the number one issue. A mistyped character, extra space, or missing symbol can break the connection instantly. Always copy and paste the key if possible, and double-check for hidden characters—especially on mobile devices where autocorrect loves to jump in.

**2. Make Sure the Key Matches the Protocol**

VPNs use different protocols (like OpenVPN, IKEv2, WireGuard, etc.). If you're trying to use a key for the wrong protocol, it won't work. Ensure your settings and the key are aligned with the correct VPN type.

**3. Outdated VPN App or OS**

Sometimes the issue isn’t the key—it’s the app or device. An outdated VPN app or operating system may not support the latest key formats. A quick update can often solve the problem instantly.

**4. Network or Firewall Blocking the Connection**

Some Wi-Fi networks, especially public ones (coffee shops, schools, etc.), block VPN traffic. Try switching to mobile data or a different network. Also, check if your device firewall is interfering and add an exception if needed.

**5. Time and Date Settings Are Off**

If your device’s date and time aren’t accurate, your VPN might fail to validate the key. This is more common than people think, especially after switching time zones or daylight saving changes.

**6. Device-Specific Configuration Errors**

Each OS has its quirks. iOS might need a profile installed, Android might need a specific app setting changed, and Windows might be stuck due to registry issues. Look up device-specific steps and ensure you're following them correctly.

**7. Reboot and Reconnect**

Yes, the old “turn it off and on again” trick works more often than not. Restart your device and the VPN app. It flushes out minor bugs and can reset the VPN tunnel successfully.

When in doubt, start simple. VPN key issues usually boil down to small oversights, not major failures. With a few quick checks, you’ll be browsing privately and securely again in no time.",1,1769870670.0,ThePureContent,0,1.0,False

1qs3ysk,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qs3ysk/hr_my_neighbour_never_looks_the_same/,[HR] My Neighbour Never Looks The Same,"It’s the classic thing they all say in the documentaries, “He was just a normal guy who kept to himself. No one could have known”. Fuck that. This guy was weird from the day he moved next door. I went and knocked on the door a few days after he moved in, with a loaf of banana bread to welcome him as I assume a good neighbour would (and my girlfriend made me take it). His whole house was shrouded in darkness, curtains closed over all the visible windows and the view through the obscured glass of his front door displayed near pitch darkness. There was no movement, no hint of him approaching the door through the glass, but perhaps that was due to the dim nature of his house.  So I was mildly startled when without warning the door opened to reveal the mousy little man who lived behind it. 

 

Normally, I would be opposed to such unflattering descriptions for fear of being unnecessarily mean, but knowing now what he is, I don’t care. The best word to describe him was moist. From his greasy, thinning hair to his drab grey blazer and the patchy light-blue shirt clinging to his skeletal frame. All of it was soaked through and sopping with what one would assume to be sweat. He was an unusually short man with a wiry brown moustache and a fogged-up pair of round glasses that, whether or not inadvertently, hid his eyes behind the misty white moisture on the lenses. He inspected me up and down before smiling, a thin-lipped, almost pained smile.

 

“Uhmm… Hi,” I nervously cleared my throat, before starting again, “I’m uh Nathan. I live next door, at number 15, with my girlfriend Kate. You know, easy to remember, Nate and Kate.” I chuckled, though quickly tailed off when he didn’t so much as blink. “I just wanted to stop by and give you this to welcome you to the neighbourhood and just say *hi* from me and Kate and uhh… yeah…”

“Oh, how…” he stopped, looking me up and down again, “nice… I’m uhhh… Michael. Yeah, Michael. O-or you can call me Mike.” 

He extended a pale, clammy hand for me to shake, but I nodded towards both my hands holding the plate of banana bread as an excuse not to. 

“Yeah so, this is for you and yeah.. swing by sometime for a drink or something. I’m sure Kate would love to meet you too.”

With shaking hands, and a wistful, “yeah that’d be… nice.” He took the plate and shuffled back behind the threshold of his front door, slowly closing it behind him. 

 

We didn’t see him, or our plate back for a good month. Kate kept telling me to go knock on the door and ask for it back, but I really didn’t want to have to talk to him again and was consistently finding any excuse not to. In the end, Kate decided to go herself. She was gone for maybe 20 minutes before she returned with an unprecedented smile on her face. 

“What are you grinning about?” I asked, already on edge. 

“You!” She laughed, “you’ve been fucking with me. Admit it!” She shot me a triumphant smirk as she conspicuously passed me with the plate to put it in the sink, “He seems like a lovely guy. Charming, funny, kinda cute.”

“Mhm, very funny. Seriously, what was he like?”

“I am being serious!” She laughed, “I thought you were messing with *me*. Like, what were you going on about? You made him sound like some sweaty Reddit mod.” 

“That’s… that’s what he was. I don’t know what to tell you, I guess.”“Yeah well, now I get to prove you wrong.” Kate turned to face me from the kitchen counter, “He’s invited us over for a drink this afternoon.”

“Oh no, I-“

“I know you’ve got nothing on today. Come on, it’ll be fun!”

She looked so happy about it. I guess she always was the extrovert between the two of us, but I couldn’t help feeling trepidation at the thought of it. But *what the heck*, I thought, *first impressions can be deceiving*, maybe I was wrong about him. It seemed like it when he opened the door, a big smile on his face as he ushered us inside.

 

Honestly, you could hardly tell he was the same guy, black hair flowing down to his now unhunched shoulders, and the warmest smile he could muster stretched across his once pallid face. He must’ve grown at least a foot, if not more, now almost level with my eyeline. I smiled back as I stepped across the threshold, though I’m sure mine was far less convincing. 

“Nate, how have you been! It’s been a while.” He laughed and patted me on the back as I stepped past him.“Yeah… good, good. You know the usual, same old whatever. You look like you’re doing well. I mean, I hardly recognised you.” “Hey, yeah, well, I got my eyes lasered, so yeah. It’s like I’ve got new eyes, no more glasses I suppose.”

“That must be it…” I lied. He laughed again, “Please, come in, come in. Just leave your shoes by that cabinet just there. Kitchen is that way.” 

I followed Kate into the house, Mike following closely at my heels. I didn’t dare look back at him, but from the heat radiating through my clothes and onto my skin, I could’ve sworn it felt like he was only a fraction of an inch away from being pressed against my back as he pursued us. 

 

As we rounded the corner to his kitchen, he slithered past me in order to get ahead of us as he asked, “Can I get either of you a drink? I’ve got a couple of different wines, soft drinks...”“Ooh, do you have rose?” Kate said, following him to the fridge. 

“I’ve got a few.”

“Provencé?”

“Ah, a woman of taste. I most certainly do, my dear.” With a sickening laugh, he produced a bottle from behind the fridge door. “Nate? Anything for you?”“Oh, uhm do you have like a Coke or something?”“Hmm, Looks like I only have diet, is that alright?”Before I had a chance to answer, Kate turned and glared at me, anticipating my response. With a grimace I nodded to her before replying, “Yeah, that’s great, thanks.” 

 

With an overemphasised gesture, he directed us round a corner into a new room. I followed behind Kate, and immediately tensed when I heard her gasp as she entered the room, preparing myself for whatever horror may lay ahead. Close behind, I stepped into to what appeared to be a living room, though it looked like it had never been lived in.  The whole thing was stale and lifeless, like some sort of pamphlet showroom. The curtains and sofas existed without a single crease and there was a large TV on one of the walls, still with the plastic film over the screen. The carpet sat under the coffee table in the middle of the room but appeared completely unused as every single fibre was perfectly combed in the same direction as its neighbours. 

I followed Kate to the sofa and sat beside her, as Mike delicately perched himself on a chair opposite us, staring unblinkingly between the two of us. 

 

I sat and nursed my Diet Coke for hours, feigning interest in the conversation as I slowly transitioned into zoning out completely. At some point the conversation moved onto Mikes career, which would have been interesting if he hadn’t made that weird too. Apparently he worked in practical effects and makeup for tv and movies. Sounds interesting on the surface right? I thought so too until he disappeared round the corner and came back with a picture frame with hair in it. Different rows of hair, black, brown, blonde, nicely combed and organised. I don’t know about you, or people in his line of work but I think that’s pretty fucking weird.

 

Words can’t describe how relieved I was when we finally got up to leave. He kept offering Kate more and more wine and trying to get me to join. And he made a joke, I’m assuming, about having his guest room available if we need it. But he kept saying it, like we don’t live ten fucking yards away. Regardless, we managed to escape a few hours later as a sober me guided my now wobbly partner back to our front door after an irritatingly long goodbye. And finally it was over. 

 

Weeks passed and then months, and I had cast Mike out of my mind completely. You know how it is with neighbours, yeah you live next to each other but you only really see them or interact a few times a year. And I was quite happy to keep it that way too, but Kate was less happy to stay disconnected than I.

 

She burst into the kitchen one evening after work, practically buzzing with her own excitement.

“Nate, Nate, You won’t believe this!”

“Oh god, what’s happened?”

“I just saw Mike,” She leant forwards, both hands planted firmly on the table, “With a girl!

“Really? I kinda thought he was gay.”

“I know right! I’m pretty sure though. They were just walking down the road and like holding hands and everything.” 

“Damn, well good for him I guess.”

“Yeah, She was cute too. Blue haired girl, that kinda vibe you know? Who’d’ve thought.”

 

She always was a bit of a gossip, or as she calls it *taking an interest* but I never related. You know how it is, I’m not really interested in the subject. But she likes telling me about stuff, and unlike listening to her get excited, even if the topic doesn’t interest me. Usually her gossip was relatively unimportant, or at least to me, but this piece was particularly boring, so I shelved it in the back of my mind to never think of or engage with until she next brings it up. It wasn’t her that reminded me though. 

 

The following week, I happened to see Mike from our bedroom window. He was in his back yard, mowing the lawn in a tank top and a pair of shorts. He saw me staring from the window and looked up, with a big smile and a wave before continuing with his own matters. But somehow, and for some reason all of his hair was blue. I don’t mean like he’d dyed his *hair* blue. He’d dyed all of it. Everything from his arm hair to his legs, chest and facial hair was a bright neon blue. I honestly didn’t know how to react, so I just stared at him incredulously as I struggled to decide between laughing or recoiling in disgust. 

 

He didn’t stay like that for long though. The next time I saw him, maybe a month later, he was back to his regular old black hair, though it was longer again. His face had changed too, his once round jaw was becoming straighter and more defined. He was taller now, noticeably so. The day I had met him he stood at around 4ft, but now he was far past 6ft and close to having to crouch to enter his own front door. Just a fundamentally different person. 

 

His hair was always the easiest tell. He was ginger for a little while, then blonde, then back to black again. He was constantly getting taller, though he never seemed to gain weight. Much like stretching a rubber band, as he got taller he only appeared to get thinner. 

 

I brought it up a few times to Kate but she never seemed to notice or pay much mind to it. “Some people just like to change their look up every now and again.” It was like the his rainbow palette of hair colours was the only thing she would notice. But then again she saw him much more often than I. Constantly bumping into him on the street or in the shops. I guess if he was changing gradually, it’s harder to notice when you see him more often. And every time she saw him she continued to *take an interest*. It was through her inquiries and observations that we found out that he seemed to have multiple partners. A steady stream of people returning to his house with him. Mostly women, sometimes men, though it was never the same person twice. 

 

I got suspicious. Maybe he was a pimp, or a dealer or something. Who knows but it seemed so suspicious, at least to me. But I never did anything about it. I mean, there was no way of being sure, right? On the other hand maybe it was work related, or he was dating around, who knows. But I could never shake the feeling of suspicion that clawed its way back into my mind every time I saw him.

 

There was one time, I remember, where I woke up in the middle of the night. Our bedroom was near silent, save for Kate’s faint breathing beside me. Silent enough to hear next door. I could hear a woman screaming. It was muffled behind the wall that separated our houses, but it was unmistakably there. Just the sound turned my blood cold. After ten minutes of tossing, turning and wondering if I should do something, I gently shook Kate awake.

 

She rolled over to face me with a quiet, “hmm?” as she blinked the sleep from her eyes. 

“Do you hear that?” I whispered. 

“Hear what?”

“It’s like a woman screaming or something…”

She propped herself up on her hand and stared at me for a second. Even in the near pitch darkness of our bedroom, I could still see the judgment on her face. 

“Nate, it’s like 2am right now, and Mike has a guest over. I’m sure you can do the math on that one.” 

“No, you don’t think-“ I stopped, considering her words. As always, I had no proof, and really, no reason to suspect the words. 

“I do, now can we go back to bed…” she yawned, settling back under the covers and giving my arm a gentle tug. I conceded and lay back down as she pulled herself in a little closer with a whispered *goodnight*. Within seconds, she was back asleep, but I couldn’t do the same with my mind still racing. The screaming continued for minutes till there was a heavy thud against the wall. Only silence followed. 

When I brought it up again the next morning, she suggested that if I was really that uncomfortable with it, I should go over and tell him to keep it down or something. As if that wouldn’t be uncomfortable enough on a normal occasion, considering it involved interacting with Mike, made it that much less enticing. So of course, I didn’t, and I just left it at that. The next five times I overheard screaming in the middle of the night, I just decided not to mention it to Kate. 

 

She came to me one night, at this point over a year since he first entertained us. It was December and she said he wanted us to go over and celebrate the season or whatever. Of course I didn’t want to go, I think we’ve established that at this point. 

“It might be fun.” She said, “You sure you can’t be tempted?”

“I don’t know, Kate, I just don’t like the guy.”

“I thought you’d say that.” She laughed, “That’s fine. Not everyone likes everyone you know. But I like Mike so I’m gonna go say hi and catch up. And I’ll be right around the corner. Yeah?”

“If you’re sure. I’ll wait up yeah? And just text me or keep me updated or whatever.”

“Sure thing. I’ll be back by like, ten or eleven-ish.” She stood up grabbing her bag and keys. 

“Ok. Have fun, I love you.”

“I know you do.” She grinned at me as she shut the door behind her. 

 

She texted me at around 11 saying she was going to be back soon. Come midnight she still wasn’t home I’d been texting and getting no responses. Finally o was sick of it. I threw a hoodie on and headed next door. 

 

As always, his house was pitch black. As I was knocking, I was watching through the glass to spot any sign of movement, and as before the shadows hid it all. When the door opened, I wasn’t prepared for  the new Mike. He had now far outgrown his own door, to the point where I couldn’t see his face till he stepped back from the threshold. His smile sickened me, more than usual as he warmly started with, “Oh hi Nate!”

Fuck pleasantries, I just wanted to get to the point. “Kate’s not come home. Is she here?”

“Kate? No, she left hours ago.” He continued smiling, feigning bewilderment. 

“Well, she’s not come home, and I get the feeling she didn’t get lost on her way back, so… you mind if I come have a look?”

“Oh, Nathan, it’s late, I was just getting ready for bed. I’d rather not…”

I didn’t let him finish. I shouldered forward, pushing him aside as I barged my way in. Following the corridor round, I found my way back into to his *living room*. It still looked identical, polished and smooth furniture, perfectly prim and proper combed rug, and a nearly full glass of provence. I ignored his called to “ignore the mess” as I circled the first floor and headed straight for the stairs. As Mike rounded the corner, he blocked the way with one of his oversized, bony arms.

“Nate, I’d really rather you don’t go upstairs.”

“Then why don’t you tell me what the fuck you’ve done with my girlfriend.” I glared up at him, trying as hard as I could to look intimidating whilst standing a good foot and a half below him.

 

“I’ve not done anything, Nate? She left hours ago. Why are you being like this?”

“Don’t fucking lie to me.” I pushed him, hard. To my surprise, he was both dense felt as though he barely weighed anything at all, like his whole body was made of memory foam. He toppled backwards, as his skinny legs struggled to support him and he came crashing down.

With a spongy thud he landed, his body on the floor and his head wrenched at a 90 degree angle upon the foot of his front door cabinet. He cried out, maybe in pain, maybe in surprise, I didn’t care. He was alive and he’d be up soon, I couldn’t waste my time. I bolted for the stairs.

 

As I ascended the steps, the whole house seemed to disappear around me, or I should say *home* rather. There was no furniture or wallpaper or any sense of life above the top step. Moulding, empty walls with open electrical cables dangling out of open cavities. Peeling remnants of where wallpaper used to be, covered in water stains and black splotches. All the finished, perfect vision of the house disappears upon the threshold at the top of the stairs. All of it was gone, just far enough for it to be invisible to anyone who happened to look from downstairs.

 

I knew where his bedroom was; it shared a wall with ours, so I went straight for it as I heard Mike clambering to his feet downstairs. The door looked somehow older than the rest of the house. It looked like the burnt remains of a house fire, cracked and charred, and simultaneously rotted and moulded by an abundance of moisture. The doorknob was almost entirely brown with age and corrosion, and refused to turn without excessive force.

 

As the bedroom door finally swung open, I was immediately punched in the face by the pungent smell of stale water and rotting flesh. It was near pitch black in there, the windows covered in multiple layers of black fabric so that not even the forgiveness of the moon could cast any means of visibility. Though I couldn’t see the room, I knew I wasn’t alone, as the laboured sound of breathing greeted me from the far corner. I fished around in my pockets for a second. Keys… change… no phone. *Shit*.  But I had my grandad’s old Zippo, it’d have to do. I flicked it on, and there, barely conscious and crumpled on the floor, in the corner of the room, was Kate. Half clothed, with large patches of hair and skin missing and in a pool of presumably her own blood, but alive. I was at her side in an instant. Leaving the lighter lit on the floor beside us, I gently but urgently tried to pull her away from the wall, trying all the while not to touch any of her large patches of missing skin. Her whole body was slick and wet with a viscous sticky fluid that stank of rat piss. And, as I went to pull her towards me, it only stuck harder, clinging onto both her and the wall. It steadfastly refused to let her budge and all the while making a sickening sound like an old man sucking his teeth as I desperately tried to tear her away. As the sound of footsteps sounded up the stairs, Kate finally pulled away in my arms, only revealing a massive circle of missing flesh from her shoulder blades to her lower back, slowly seeping what little blood her body had left to give. 

 

“The game is up then?”

Mike appeared in the doorway, his head now dangling down from the stump of his neck onto his shoulder. Like a sun-dried tomato, his skin had pulled and wrinkled at the point where it stretched to accommodate his new cranial position. His veins bulged and writhed and twisted with every movement, as though a family of spiders might be trapped under his skin, desperately seeking any means of escape. Despite this, he still had to crouch as he entered the door, closing it behind him and smiling at me. I guess he was still happy.

 

“What have you… What are you?” 

“You’re hard to fool, you know that?” He placed an enormous hand on the top corner of the door and forced it shut. “But you should have just gone home when I gave you the chance.”

He stood upright, or more upright. I think more accurately, he grew again, his shoulders flexing as they almost brushed the black, stained ceiling. His shirt swelled as his ribcage began to force its way out of his thin t-shirt. He dropped to his knees as he gripped his head, holding it in place above what used to be his neck. As an indeterminate, nobbled object slid under the skin of his neck he let go of his head, only for it to stay in position as it would have if it had never been detached. Even on his knees, he was still taller than me. His shirt finally gave way, tearing open at the force exerted from his widening torso. His ribcage, or where his ribcage should have been was bulging out from his body. His ribs were covered in linear scars. All of them perfectly straight, like a surgical wound that would never fully heal. 

 

His legs began to bend and break with a sharp, moist crunching. They grew behind him, impossibly long with too many knees protruding at odd angles. His legs, much like his arms only got thinner and thinner, the skin becoming vacuum sealed to his incorrectly shaped bones. 

 

The scarred skin around his exposed chest began to rip, as it stretched open on weak fibres. He tore his shirt off as it began to pull against his widening shoulders, only to reveal his entire stomach, chest, neck and back were all covered in similar surgical scars. All of them joined shortly after, tearing open to reveal the creature underneath.

 

Its limbs were black, and uncomfortably sticky looking. Two narrow, serrated, insectile arms extended from the torn skin at his ribcage as his neck continued extending. He tried to stand on his two hind legs, but the room was too short and his legs couldn’t support him, so he clambered onto its four other limbs and began to slink his way towards Kate and I. 

 

On my own unsteady limbs, I crawled backwards, pinning Kate to wall behind me whilst trying to gain some distance. I used to work as a bouncer to a bar for a few years, and thought I had learnt that if push comes to shove, my fight or flight response trusts me enough to do the former. But confronted by whatever the fuck this thing was, I couldn’t seem to do either. I would’ve taken flight if my only means of exit wasn’t on the other end of the room, behind Mike. And as much as I would have wanted to fight, my body wouldn’t move. All I could do, was reach behind me and take Kate’s hand in mine. It was limp, and cold, and she barely had the strength to close her fingers. She was barely clinging onto consciousness at all. 

 

He took his time, enjoying his slow approach. He always looked happy, but to me it always looked fake. An act he put on to come across as friendly. But not this time. Written across his tearing, deformed face was the purest delight I’m sure he’d ever displayed. 

 

The skin of his face slipped away to reveal a mass of slimy grey flesh, covered in thinning black hairlike appendages, each slowly moving of its own accord. His mouth was sunken back in his face and invisible, but I knew it was there from the yellow saliva that was dripping down his malformed chin. The rest of it was dried and caked across his cheeks like dog. His body barely moved but his ever elongating neck did most of the work for him, pressing as close to me as he could get before I recoiled at the stench. His body soon caught up though, scuttling over to me so that his front arms could reach out and caress my face. 

 

“I love your hair.” He sang, his spider like hands slowly moving up to my head. One of his hands alone was enough to grip my entire head if he desired, though he never chose to. He leant in closer, his suspended head gliding back in again for a closer look. 

 

As soon as he was close enough, I punched him, as hard as I could. He grunted and recoiled for a second. As soon as he did, I grabbed one of his zig-zag arms, and cracked it over my  crouching knee. It tore easily, like a freshly cooked crab. But the remnants looked hardly edible, as a gooey, hair filled black liquid spewed from the flailing stump. 

 

He stumbled back again, as I stood to run at him, but he gathered himself quicker. He stood up taller, towering over me in the little room as he grabbed my by the throat.  As he raised me up off my feet, he sliced down across my face with one of his serrated forearms. I cried out as the world turned dark for a second. 

The next thing I knew I was on the floor in the dark room. My whole face was both on fire and numb. He placed one of his hands on my chest, holding me down as one of his other hands slid over my face.

“Shhh it’s ok, it’s ok!” He cooed as he continued. 

I screamed as I felt his massive fingers sliding into my eye socket. That’s about all I could do. They curled around the soft flesh and began to pull. The wet sounds of shifting flesh as the ball exited my skull filled the room for a second, only to be followed by my screaming once more. I couldn’t breathe, or think, or move. I could feel my head lift off the ground as he tried to pull my eye away, only to be confronted by my optic nerve desperately trying to cling on to its owner. Another one of his hands gripped my face, forcing it back down onto the ground as he began to pull harder. The cord gave way and he finally pulled his treasure up to his facefor inspection. 

He laughed. “You know, it’s so funny. I’ve always wanted green eyes!” 

 

I couldn’t see, with my one remaining eye, the pain was too intense and the least I could do was keep both my eyelids shut. My arms flailed as I writhed on the ground in pain, only to be confronted by a sharp sting on my right knuckle. I felt for the source only to find the same intense sensation on my fingertips. *My lighter?*

I kicked on the floor, unsure of where Mike was or what he was doing but hoping it would be enough to shift my position just enough to grab my lighter. 

 

I forced my eyes open, only to find his face inches from mine, smiling down at me. Of course he was smiling. When wasn’t he. 

His long, greasy, bloodstained hair was dangling between us like a curtain around both our faces, blocking everything out of my peripherals. 

 

I grabbed the lighter and pushed it up under his hair and watched as the strands caught fire and shot all the way up to his face. Within seconds, he was in a blaze. Like a dying insect, he writhed on the ground as he screamed every frequency at once. Every voice he’d stolen crying out in a haunting harmony. I took my chance and lifted Kate off the ground. Throwing the lighter at him, I ran for the door and down the stairs, bouncing off both the walls and the bannister on the edge of my own consciousness. Out the front door and finally into our own house. I set Kate down on the stairs and retrieved the home phone, dialling for an ambulance. The rest is a blur. I made a call, but I don’t remember any of it. Eyes closed, fading in and out of consciousness, running on the fumes of my own energy. 

 

I awoke in a hospital bed. I'm fine, and Kate’s fine, kind of. Thank god. There’s not much that can be done about my eye, but I can’t complain, I didn’t get the worst of it. Somehow Kate’s follicles are missing, and her hair isn’t gonna grow back. Same with her nails. I’m missing most of my left cheek, and Kate is missing a lot of her everywhere. I might need a skin graft, a Kate definitely will. Ironic, I know. She woke up a few days ago, but she hasn’t said much. I don’t blame her. I spoke to the cops on behalf of both of us. They went and checked Mike’s house out. It was about a week after it happened, and his front door was still open. There was blood in the bedroom, but having tested it, apparently, there’s DNA from at least a dozen people, if not more. Worst of all, Mike, or the thing that he became, has not been seen. The house is empty, and despite checking local security footage from surrounding houses, he was never seen leaving the house or in and around the neighbourhood. It’s all just a bit fucked, to be honest. I don’t know how long till we’re officially past this, but Kate’s not gonna be out of the hospital for a while, at the very least. I got discharged today and finally got to return home. The house next door was all boarded up and closed down after the investigation. “Good”, I thought. It’s over and done with, and we can all slowly *try* to forget about it. 

 

Our house looked like a crime scene, too. The stairs were covered in dried blood that I had to spend a good hour cleaning. *No more reminders*. I knew I was gonna sleep well. *Finally*, *a chance to be reunited with my own bed*. I dragged myself through the house, up the freshly cleaned stairs and along the hallway. I dragged myself straight to our bedroom, straight to my bed, straight to my grandad's lighter that was awaiting me on my pillow.",1,1769870206.0,shortstories,1,0.67,False

Things are alright between us and we do well financially but honestly I am so bored.

 Our weekly routine:

- Wake up go to work mon - Friday
- I run my own business and usually finish work a lot earlier than that so I have to go home and take care of our dogs and clean the house (bc he just won't) 
- I have to wait for him to come home from work before dinner is made (by me) 
- Then its TV and bed 

Our weekend routine - 

- I get up at 9am usually (sometimes I have 2/3 hours of work to do, but not every weekend) 
- He gets up usually 2pm 
- Have something to eat at home and then watch tv 
- He usually falls back asleep 4pm until like 9pm 
- I cannot go anywhere otherwise he's calling me 100 times and asking where I am and why I didn't ask him to come even though he was asleep

I am so bored. Before this relationship I was going out with my dogs on the weekend, going for 2 / 3 hour hikes. Getting myself a small lunch or coffee somewhere. Things like that. 

I ask even if he wants to go out for lunch or a smaller walk (doesn't have to be a hike) and he doesn't want to because that means he has to take a shower and get dressed. 

How on earth am I supposed to live like this? Its making me so depressed. 

May I add we are on the phone all day during work because he wants to know what im doing all day. 

Is it worth continuing this relationship? Is there any encouragement I can make for change or is there no point?

Thank you

(Sorry US folks, maybe some day....) and its a bit older article (December 2025) but might still be relevant;

Also being in the US, I have never seen perfume at my local Aldi's  (I have seen a few things in Trader Joe's however) so no frame of reference about how good they are but admittedly, I'm intrigued.  

I do get my coffee there though.

>Aldi is introducing new additions to its fragrance line with perfumes that it says rival designer brands. Landing in stores December 7 Aldi shoppers will find various lines of men’s and women’s fragrances from its own health and beauty range, Lacura.

OK then....from the article:

>The new Astralis Eau De Parfum is described as ""cosmic inspired fragrance"" Aldi has compared the fragrance to Alien by Mugler

❤️

>Described as a ""botanical"" scent, Lacura's Floral Love Eau de Parfum (£6.99, 100ml) is said to offer notes of rose, freesia, and African orange flower, complemented by darker, woody aromas of bergamot, musk, patchouli and creamy vanilla.  


>Aldi has likened it to the Flower bomb perfume from Dutch designer brand, Viktor and Rolf which sells for £155/100ml.

❤️

>A perfume that is said to be delicate and light, is the Lacura Prism Eau de Parfum (£6.99, 100ml).  


>It is said to have gentle notes of orange blossom, neroli and jasmine with warm undertones of bourbon vanilla, white musk and amber with a rich bergamot and tangerine freshness on the finish.  


>Aldi has compared it to the Prada Paradoxe fragrance which is £140/90ml.

This particular brand appears to be just another Aldi's arm/brand for beauty so, thats interesting, and while there's a site  [https://thelacura.com/lacura-perfume/](https://thelacura.com/lacura-perfume/)  you can't buy these online.

My now ex partner (39M) just broke up with me suddenly today. I’d like to say I’m sad but to be honest… I’m relieved… I initially felt a lot of guilt towards leaving his kids until late this evening… 

So on Friday just gone my son (13M) was due to fly the state over to visit his uncle and aunt and spend the weekend. We had a massive blow up fight because I was child free for the weekend and he tried pushing his two kids (8F and 10M) onto me to babysit yet AGAIN so he could go out with his mates and have fun. I’ve been putting up with this for nearly 3 years. Yes I’ve talked to him numerous times about not putting his parental load on me all the time. Yes I’ve asked him to please be considerate of me. Yes, I’ve had ALL the talks. To put it bluntly, this man did not care. He only cared about his comfort, his freedom and his ease of life

After I had already made plans to see my best friend (who has cancer :( and see my other group of friends for coffee) he demanded I drop one of the Friday’s or Saturday’s so HE could go out with his mates. I refused and said look I’m sorry I’m fully booked out, I can’t watch your kids this weekend. He flipped his shit and gave me the silent treatment for two days. I didn’t give in. I stuck to my guns. I told him they were HIS kids, HIS responsibility. He didn’t like that… . 

We had a lay it all on the table fight today. I asked him why did he get in a relationship with me. He said he needed help with the kids… he asked me why I got into one and I said, I agreed to be with a man who just so happened to have kids. I didn’t agree to take on his 50-50 parenting responsibilities. 

For quick clarification, I do the drop offs to school (he couldn’t find work “supposedly 🙄” because of the kids. So I took on school lunches, breakfast, getting the kids ready etc and dropping them off, so he could work. I came home from MY full time job to cook and clean up after the kids. Paid 50-50 on bills. Babysat them from Friday night through to Sunday when he went out with his mates, gym, errands… whatever he felt like doing!! I was stuck doing it all and I never signed up for this!! He didn’t have to deal with them much aside from a few hours after school and he barely interacted with them. I parented them ontop of everything else because he was a Disney dad! 

After I seen that he just wouldn’t get through his head that these kids were HIS responsibility alone and not mine to bear the burden of I gave up. The level of entitlement from this bloke was astounding. He just refused to take responsibility. I argued that I don’t plan anything on my custody time because I have my son and it’s my job to be a good mum and be present for him. He told me well that’s my choice and my fault. 

I went upstairs and sat in bed. He came up shortly after and told me it’s over. I shrugged and said whatever. I didn’t care. I was exhausted. Done. Done with it all. But then he did the dumbest thing… he dragged his kids down immediately and told them… they started crying asking questions. Where am I gonna go… what about my son… why were we breaking up… he gave short age inappropriate answers. Didn’t give closure. It was more of a fuck you OP it’s done. 

So fast forward, I take myself to my GF house and have a wine. Lament about the last near three years. I get a txt at 11pm. It’s my son. He’s frantically texting me. I pick up my phone and discover my ex son has told MY son that us breaking up was all HIS fault!!!!!! He said my ex was taking all our belongings and kicking us out onto the street. My poor son was frantic! Beside himself! Inconsolable. 

I was furious. Beyond furious. I rang my ex and started screaming over the phone to get his rachet ass son away from my son. I called him a brainless troglodyte and a fool for jumping the gun and exposing the kids soo soon without a plan in place. 

I had to quickly make up some BS to my son about why we were breaking up. I said it was a logistics thing. His kids were moving away for school and I didn’t want to leave him so the only logical thing to do was seperate. I spared everyone the details. 

This absolute fuck head went in cold blooded and didn’t think about anyone but himself. 

It really is true. Most single dads don’t date to find a partner. They want a slave. Some one to share the burden… without ever asking us if that’s ok… it’s just expected of us… because we are women. They exploit our kindness towards others and take us for granted. 

I’m so sorry this post is all over the place. My mind is in defence mode and I’m scrambling to pick up the pieces of his mess he made. Fuck him. Fuck his kids. I’m done. They can all PO.

I used it to get to and from my work on. But as I’m approaching 40 I’m really keen to get a little bike again. I’m self employed with a works van and we also have a family car. 

I’ve been looking at the new Honda CBF 125 as I like the reliability of them and the little digital screen. 

The bike is purely for having a Sunday morning ride out 20 miles away for a coffee and coming back home. Maybe a few more adventures but nothing crazy. 

I’m not sure whether to go down the second hand route and pay around £1800 for a used 125cc like a YBR or a CBF or just get the 2026 CBF for £3200.

I’m presuming if I buy brand new that while I will lose £500 off it straight away riding it off the forecourt, that then will be the only real loss and if in a years time I decide it’s not for me I can probably sell the bike back to the shop for £2200 having had a years worth of fun riding it. Also no MOT and warranty so I don’t have to worry while I do have the bike. 

Or I could buy a 3 year old 125 with maybe 5000 miles on it for £1800 but have to deal with MOT and no warranty. I then may only lose £300 in a year and sell it for £1500 if I was to get rid.

This is a bit of a mid life crisis for me and  really not interested in a bigger bike as I just want something to poodle around on as I approach 40. Maybe if the bug really bites I would look at doing full license. 

So any suggestions? Brand new? Second hand? Thoughts ?

1qs3s54,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poetry/comments/1qs3s54/roast_me_re_the_first_18_lines_of_the_wasteland/,Roast me re: the first 18 lines of The Wasteland [OPINION],"I'm waiting for the Weston book to come in, so I took a crack without any secondary sources based mostly on the publication date (the idea that this had something directly to do with The Great War).

I read lines 1 - 4 as describing the trenches of April 1915 (the death of Eliot's friend Verdenal at Gallipoli, Ypres, the first use of Poison Gas, etc. when the war got very real, generally, and very real, specifically for Eliot), the lilacs are soldiers coming out of the trenches going over the top, ending with ""spring rain"", which is not the regular kind of rain in my reading. I have no doubt that there are other associations, but I'm reading Eliot as assuming that readers of the day would intuit these associations at least.

Imagine the first four lines as being shouted by a British sergeant major to troops in the trenches as a grim and surrealistic pep talk as the one minute alert counts down and then the whistle blows.

Lines 5-7, starting with the non-sequitur ""Winter kept us warm"", recall the previous winter, when there was a Christmas truce in 1914 (""feeding a little life with dried tubers"", potato pie was a favorite at the front, food was shared during the armistice) with the ""forgetful snow"" hiding the carnage from view for a minute or two.

Now Lines 8 - 18,



Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee

With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,

And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,

And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.

Bin gar keine Russin, stamm’ aus Litauen, echt deutsch.

And when we were children, staying at the archduke’s,

My cousin’s, he took me out on a sled,

And I was frightened. He said, Marie,

Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.

In the mountains, there you feel free.

I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.



\*“I'm not Russian at all, I come from Lithuania, pure German.”

I was a little lost here (in terms of my admittedly idiosyncratic, maybe idiotic, reading). Are we still in the war or what? Well, I think we're at the start of the war, in the summer of 1914.

From Wikipedia: ""According to historian Zbyněk Zeman, in Vienna ""the event \[assassination of Franz Ferdinand) almost failed to make any impression whatsoever. On 28 and 29 June, the crowds listened to music and drank wine, as if nothing had happened.""\[39\] Nevertheless, the impact of the murder of the heir to the throne was significant, and has been described by historian Christopher Clark as a ""9/11 effect, a terrorist event charged with historic meaning, transforming the political chemistry in Vienna"".\[40\]""

We can take the archduke as being alluded to in line 13 (I'm aware that there's a more literal archduke alluded to). So we're moving backwards in time from April 1915, to the Christmas of 1914, and now summer of 1914. They were drinking coffee, sledding in the mountains, staying up reading ""much of the night"" (does that mean reading ""a large part of the night"" or reading ""a whole lot about the night""? Did he have forebodings?) and BOOM! ... down they went.

One other thing, you can read this as there being at least three nationalities, an ethnic German, an Austrian (the archduke), and Marie, who I take to be French (again, I'm aware that there's a more literal Marie). They're at least friends, and some are actually related. And then, all of the sudden, they're not friends or family anymore. At all.

So the picture is a contemplation of the war after the fact, from the standpoint of the average joe (or even a sophisticated character like T.S. Eliot), asking what the hell just happened? You can talk about Thucydides traps and the shifting balance of power and so forth. I don't think anyone really saw what was coming. Maybe I'm wrong about that (not like I'm a Great War historian).

Finally, I'm not suggesting that the first 18 lines are ""really"" about the war. I'm reading the the poem as representing the horror of the war to say something about the nature of life. So, a) the horror of the war is transmuted into symbols of growth and life, and then b) he wants you to read the symbols of growth and life in light of the war.

Just having something to squeeze during work calls or while watching TV supposedly helps. I bought one. Then another because I liked having different textures. Then a few more because they were cute and cheap.

Fast forward to now and I have 23 of these things. Twenty-three. They’re all over my apartment. On my desk, in my bag, on the coffee table, by my bed. It’s become a problem but also I’m not entirely sure I want to stop?

They do actually help when I’m feeling anxious. But I think I’ve crossed the line from helpful coping mechanism into weird collection obsession. My friends make jokes about it. My mom asked if I was okay when she visited and saw them everywhere.

I keep browsing for new ones online, checking different styles on sites like Alibaba. There are so many variations and I keep thinking just one more won’t hurt. But I said that seventeen squishies ago. Has anyone else developed a strange collection because of anxiety or stress?

1qs3or1,https://www.reddit.com/r/spooky_stories/comments/1qs3or1/echoes_of_innocence/,Echoes of Innocence,"Chapter 1: The Silence of the Village

Leonardo was seven years old and did not cry.

In Vila da Serra, narrow streets pressed against each other, with uneven stones, peeling houses, and fences covered in moss. The wind carried the scent of damp earth and rotting wood, and the creak of old doors seemed to whisper.

In the yard, his father argued with neighbors. Leonardo simply watched. There was no fear, only attention—he learned gestures, tone of voice, the effect each word had on others.

When the cat disappeared, his mother cried. Leonardo felt curiosity, not loss. He spent days imagining where the animal could be, if it felt pain, for how long its body would react. He found a dead rat behind the shed. He took it to his room, observed it until the smell became unbearable. The discomfort was interesting; the control was fascinating.

Chapter 2: Learning to Observe

At school, narrow corridors and rusty lockers made every step echo. The playground was small, with dark corners that hid silence.

Leonardo was bullied. Classmates pushed him, hid his materials, mocked him. He did not react. He watched, studied, memorized patterns.

Small objects began to disappear and reappear in strange ways. A dead frog in a backpack, a crushed bird in a locker.

No one could prove it was him. But the sense of fear near him was palpable. Silence became a weapon more powerful than any scream.

Chapter 3: Dark Adolescence

At fourteen, Leonardo’s room was too organized. Stuffed animals, newspaper clippings, drawings of people in agony. Everything cataloged. He studied human behavior. Who startled easily, who remained silent.

The neighborhood provided perfect laboratories: narrow alleys, empty buildings, gates that creaked too loudly. Fear could be studied, manipulated, perfected.

He did not feel superior, but like a scientist of terror, attentive to flaws and details. Small mistakes, like an unexpected noise or someone’s distraction, only increased his fascination.

Chapter 4: First Human Crimes

At seventeen, Leonardo chose his first human victim. Not out of anger, but for absolute control.

The location: an old warehouse, peeling walls, broken windows. The floor creaked. The smell of rust and dampness seemed to suffocate every sound.

The murder was not explicitly violent. It was calculated, silent. Leonardo observed the reaction, studied the fear, and left without leaving a trace. He felt confirmation, not pleasure.

Chapter 5: Marcos Loses Control

Detective Marcos Valente began sleeping poorly.

The small office, hot, smelling of old coffee and paper, accumulated folders and photos. Maps with pins connecting disappearances. Nothing screamed “serial killer,” and that was worse.

At home, Marcos distanced himself from his wife. Ignored his children. Every noise at night made his heart race. He started reviewing routes repeatedly, avoiding dark streets. Fear became physical: insomnia, sweating, muscle tension.

At work, superiors praised his dedication, but no one understood that the case was consuming his sanity.

Chapter 6: The City Learned to Fear Him

At twenty-one, Leonardo was patient. He knew schedules, routes, how to appear invisible. His crimes were not explosive; they were absences. People disappeared, houses fell silent.

The warehouse on the outskirts smelled of mold and stagnant water. Every step resonated. Every sliver of light cast manipulable shadows.

The population began to feel fear. Empty streets at night, locked doors, children avoiding alleys. Small everyday changes created a constant oppression, even without knowing why.

Marcos felt the touch of fear every day. He walked with nerves on edge, avoiding places he once considered normal. His marriage ended. Friends disappeared. The case consumed everything.

Chapter 7: Final Confrontation

The abandoned theater was in ruins. Torn seats, moldy curtains, dust floating in the moonlight beams. Every step Marcos took echoed. Every shadow seemed to move.

Leonardo was there before being seen. Small signs: a creak, a different smell, the breeze carrying a hint of rust.

The confrontation was not epic. It was suffocating. One wrong move, one hesitation, heavy silence. The sound of his own heartbeat seemed deafening.

When Leonardo was handcuffed, there was no hatred. No defeat. Only satisfied curiosity.

Marcos fell to his knees. Heart racing. Body exhausted. Marriage destroyed. Children distant. Life in ruins. The terror persisted, even with the criminal captured.

Epilogue: Echoes That Do Not Fade

Leonardo was convicted. Vila da Serra tried to forget, but the streets remained too silent.

Marcos changed positions but never recovered his sanity. He slept with the lights on, avoided alleys, dark streets, absolute silence. Every shadow reminded him of what had grown and observed in silence.

True terror did not end with the prison sentence. It continues to live in the minds of survivors, and in the suffocating silence of Vila da Serra",1,1769869506.0,spooky_stories,0,1.0,False
1qs3oij,https://www.reddit.com/r/exploringinside/comments/1qs3oij/the_100_billion_trade/,The $100 Billion Trade,"Imagine a scenario. You are sitting in a coffee shop. A man walks in. He is 90 years old. He is frail, walking with a cane, surrounded by nurses. He sits down opposite you. You recognize him. He is one of the wealthiest men in history. Worth $100 Billion.

He looks you in the eyes and makes you an offer: ""I will write you a check for my entire fortune right now. $100 Billion. It is all yours.""

The cafe goes silent. You can’t believe it. You are about to be the richest person on earth. ""But,"" he adds, ""there is one condition.""

""We have to switch bodies.""

""You get the money. You get the private jets. You get the empire. But you become 90 years old. Your body hurts. You can't run. You can't eat sugar. You don't know if you will wake up tomorrow. And I get to be You. I get your health. I get your energy. I get your future.""

The Question: Do you take the trade?

The Answer: No. Not for a billion. Not for a trillion. You wouldn't even hesitate.

The Awakening: Do you realize what this means? It means that what you have right now is more valuable than what you are chasing.

You are walking around stressed, anxious, and feeling ""behind"" in life. You think you are broke because your bank account isn't full. But in the currency that actually matters, you are already the Billionaire.

You possess the one asset that the richest people in the graveyard would give everything to buy back: Time.

The Tragedy: We are ""Time Billionaires"" acting like we are poor. We squander this fortune on:

* Anger at a coworker.
* Worrying about an email.
* Replaying a mistake from 2018.

We burn our most precious capital on Drama instead of investing it in Joy.

The Shift: Stop chasing the wealth you don't have. Start enjoying the wealth you are.

I was scrolling on my phone, half listening to the door open and close, when a stranger walked up to me. He introduced himself as someone promoting a gym nearby and said, “Hi, we’re offering free trial classes. You look like you work out. Want to hear about it?”

I didn’t want to be rude, so I asked what kind of class it was. He started explaining. My name got called, I grabbed my coffee, and I tried to leave. He followed me out, still talking, matching my pace. Then he asked if I wanted to leave my phone number.

I stopped, turned around, and said, polite but flat, “No thank you. Please don’t follow me.” I expected that to be the end of it. It wasn’t. He kept walking behind me, still talking like nothing had changed.

At that point, my focus narrowed. I could hear my own heartbeat. I didn’t want to escalate it. I just wanted out. I opened my phone, called an Uber, and stood there pretending everything was fine until the car arrived. I got in and left. Only then did my shoulders drop.

Later that night, I was at a family dinner and mentioned it casually. Not dramatic. Just telling the story. My brother laughed and said, “Well, you were probably dressed too revealing. That’s why he noticed you.”

I felt it hit before I fully understood why. I put my cup down and said, louder than I meant to, “Why does what I wear suddenly explain someone else not respecting a no? Why does this turn into something I did wrong?”

Thank you, now do it like this, I changed my mind!”","Been a while since I posted here, but here I am. This happened the other day, but I’m thinking about it still and it reminds me of how much I hate how some people treat service workers.

I work in a local sports bar as a server, host, and expo, and this occurred during a serving shift.

It wasn’t that busy of an afternoon because of all the snow still sticking around, but that was also normal for a Thursday afternoon anyways. So when these two people came in and wanted to be served at a table but only make a to go order instead of going through the host for a to go order, it wasn’t that big of a deal. The host didn’t really care that much anyways, and they’re at a table so I served them.

One of them made their to go order and paid fast, but not long after I brought their bag a man came in and sat with them.

I’ll preface this by saying I unfortunately have a resting bitch voice, but after working at the bar for 4 years I’ve gotten to a point where it’s surprising for customers and regulars that think my voice is always high-pitched and peppy. My coworkers think it’s hilarious when I talk like that while answering the phones but then immediately switch back to my actual voice that’s much deeper once the call ends. However, with all the cold going around I’m not sick in any way but it has made my voice rough, so it’s harder for me to change it for work. I’m doing my best, but I can’t force it to go anything past a slight lilt without it sounding gravely and cracked.

I asked him in as nice a voice as I could, “hey, how are you? What can I get for you?”

He responds in this kind of voice that comes off as condescending but I’m hoping he wasn’t meaning to: “I’d like to put in an order, if that’s fine with you.”

I say, “yeah, that’s fine! What would you like?”

And still, in that same voice: “Are you sure it’s fine? You sound kinda reluctant.”

I stopped for a second and realized I probably still didn’t sound good enough, but there’s nothing I can do to fix it right now without sounding worse, so I just smiled and said, “No, it’s fine, that’s just my voice!”

“Hm. Okay. Well, I would like this sandwich to go, please.”

I put in his to go order and check on them now and then. When I bring his to go order, he smiles at me.

Man: “Is this my food?”

Me: “Sure is! It’s this sandwich.”

Man: “And you made it to go?”

Me, finding that a weird question since it’s directly in front of him: “Yep, that’s the order.”

Man: “Alright, thank you. I’d like it for here now, so go do that for me?”

….Listen, I get asked sometimes by sit-in to go people to make it for here instead, and regular to go people who do that, it’s not a big deal. Kinda weird sometimes, and can be wasteful with the to go materials used since they’ll usually want it removed from the bag and boxes and put on plates instead, so that stuff gets thrown away, but not a big deal, I get. But why are we going through this whole conversation and then ending it with you telling me to go do something for you like that?

I took it back and got it for him, asked if he wanted anything else, he said he was fine. I checked on the table now and then, and once he finished I grabbed his plate and asked again if he wanted anything else.

Man: “No, I’m fine now, I’ll take my check.”

Me: “Alright! I’ll go get that for you.”

He then stopped me.

Man: “Actually, I want a coffee.”

I get that for him and ask, again, do you need anything else?

Man: “No, this is fine, I’ll take the check.”

He then stopped me while I was leaving him to get the check, again.

Man: “Actually, I also want a refill on this tea too.”

I get that for him, and when I bring it back he asks for the check again and this time he doesn’t stop me and pays after. This whole time he never stopped doing something that was halfway a smile and with the same almost condescending seeming tone.

It should have a freezer under the bed that is taken out as a shelf to work as a table too. So a mechwarrior could cook inside the cockpit with the same equipment for a camping day.  Also, I can imagine a cup holder and a coffee maker.  All this made with military grade quality to withstand mech falls and impacts.

I also imagine that places where mechwarriors go would need a shower and a toilet for mechwarrior use.

So I was dropping off a friend when someone I know suddenly came up to me. Kilala ko. INC. There was no real conversation before it. No context, no warning. She just went straight to asking, “Katno ka ngay ag-Doktrina?” (When are you going to start Doctrine?) I answered honestly and calmly, “Not sure, ante.” She pressed on with, “Apayya, ante?” (Why, ante?) Then she said, “Tapno makissayan panaginom mo.” (So your drinking will lessen.) That part really threw me off. How on earth would she even know if I drink? We barely see each other. We do not talk when we bump into one another, just small smiles and that is it. There is no catching up, no conversations, nothing that would give her any idea about my personal life. And even if I did drink, why would it concern her so much? For context, I do not even go out much. Most days I am just at home because I am busy with my own responsibilities. If I do go out, it is usually just to run errands or grab coffee with friends. That is it. So the assumption felt completely baseless. So I answered back, “Apay ngay ajay sabali ti bagaan yo ta INC dan before siak ta nakarkaro da ngem siak.” (Why don’t you tell that to your own members since kaanib niyo naman na sila and mas malala pa sila?) After that, I left. I knew that if I stayed, I would say things I knew I'regret saying and I did not want to escalate the situation. I kept my composure on the outside, but inside my head it was already like, wtfn fck. What really bothers me is this. I do not understand why some churchgoers, not all but some, speak in ways that are completely out of place. Instead of approaching people with understanding, they judge. Instead of choosing their words carefully, they assume. It is especially ironic because these are the same people who preach about faith, discipline, and moral living, yet forget empathy and respect when dealing with others. If you are going to represent a church or any belief system, your words should reflect what you are preaching. And to be clear, I get the intention behind what she was saying. In a general sense, concern for someone’s well being is not a bad thing. But there is a huge difference between genuine care and unsolicited judgment. Faith should never sound like an attack, and it should never make someone feel like they are being talked down to. ABYG?

Everything was above and beyond except for dinner service and I’m trying to diagnose what the problem might have been. We didn’t exactly have bad service, but we never really had any sort of rapport with our servers like we’ve generally had whenever we’ve cruised. On previous cruises I remember the servers doing magic tricks with us or offering coffee with dessert, and us really getting to know them. On this cruise we barely saw our servers, especially the assistant server and we often had empty water glasses or needed to ask for refills multiple times. The servers were clearly busy the entire time so it’s not like they were slacking or anything. But I’m trying to figure out what could be contributing to the problem-

Is this a function of being on a larger ship? I’ve only ever sailed on the 4 “smaller” ships

Is it because we had the first dinner service with young children?  My previous cruises were mostly when I was a teenager/young adult and didn’t have kids. 

Was it just bad luck?

Have they changed the experience of dinner and the dinner shows is more Disneys priority versus the dinner experience?

If I has any insights I works love to hear them! We had a great time and it was one of my best cruises with Disney, but I was just surprised by the lower quality dinner service.
