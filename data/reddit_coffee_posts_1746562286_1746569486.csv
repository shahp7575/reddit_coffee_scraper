Simplified it for you 😀","Got a great idea and only $10 to spare? That’s more than enough to get started. You don’t need fancy software, ads, or a big following to make your first $500 selling an ebook. You just need a plan, hustle, and a little creativity.

Here’s how to do it—step by step


1. Create a High-Value Ebook (Free Tools Only)

Pick a problem and solve it. Your ebook should help people do something better or faster: think “How to Meal Prep for Beginners” or “Freelancer’s Guide to Getting Clients.”

Write it in Google Docs. Free, clean, and easy to use.

Export it as a PDF. Done.

Design a cover on Canva (free version). Make it simple but clean use their templates.


2. Set the Right Price

Start with $10–$15. That means just 34–50 sales = $500.

Use the “pay what you want” option with a minimum of $10 some people will pay more to support you.

Make the value clear: what will people get from this ebook?


3. Spend Your $10 Wisely

Here’s how to stretch that $10:

$5 for a simple Fiverr gig – maybe a quick edit or feedback on your cover or copy.

$5 for a small Facebook/Instagram ad to a super targeted audience (optional—only if you have an ad-ready post and some experience).


Totally okay to skip ads and keep the $10 for coffee. The real growth comes from word of mouth and smart promo.


4. Launch Like You Mean It (For Free)

Promotion is where you win. Here’s how to go big without spending big:

Post on your socials and don’t just say “I wrote an ebook.” Say:

“Just launched a guide that helped me [ex: loose 10kg in a month] I turned it into a short ebook if anyone wants to do the same!”


Make 1–2 short videos (Instagram Reels, TikToks, Stories). People love quick tips, and then you drop: “I go deeper in my ebook—link in bio.”

DM 20 people you know who would benefit or support you. Not spam—just genuine messages.

Share a behind-the-scenes look. Your writing process, your excitement, your first sale.


5. Keep Momentum All Week

Post daily with fresh angles: tips from the book, reviews, screenshots, wins.

Offer a free bonus for early buyers: a worksheet, checklist, or mini Q&A session.

Ask buyers to share it or tag you social proof builds fast.


You’re $500 Away From Proof That You Can Do This

You don’t need a team, a budget, or a big brand. You need:

A good idea

A simple PDF

The drive to talk about it like it matters—because it does


Bonus: Want Help Launching Your First Ebook?

1kgh4mx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kgh4mx,Serena the Zangoose,"(Artist is Grimmhoundz on discord. I am the commissioner and the characters are mine.)

Once every thousand years seven Pokémon are granted a most marvelous ability... to channel one of the seven heavenly virtues and the blessings that came with it. Serena is one of these blessed mons. She looked complete normal aside from a blue tipped ear. Serena was born into a group of Zangoose that were in an eternal feud with a group of Seviper. It was these fights for survival and territory where Serena learned to fight. 

She was a very capable fighter, in times her power flashed, dealing critical blows to rival Sevipers. Her tribe viewed her power as a gift that would eradicate their enemies. Despite this, Serena's heart wasn't in it, she found these fights pointlessly violent and eventually left for the big city. Leaving family and friends behind, Serena restarted her life and tried out different occupations. She grew a fondness for sports and was very athletic... but there were too many choices! 

Every week she tried a different sport. Her powers would kick in at key moments that swayed her teams favor. This frustrated the Zangoose and rival players. Feeling dejected Serena stopped playing sports to avoid giving any team an unfair advantage and went to a cafe to think about her next move. With few funds and no career Serena took a sip of the coffee she was drinking and was amazed! It was so good! She went to talk to the cafe owner, a sweet older Kangaskhan who was looking to retire soon. Serena swiftly became her apprentice and soon enough was making better coffee than her mentor, she loved testing flavors and twerking things till they were perfect. It was the most she had ever focused and finally she felt like she had control of her life. Eventually the Kangaskhan retired, leaving the cafe to Serena.

While Serena was doing a fine job it was a lot of work for one mon. Fate would soon pair her up with a Seviper of all things who was down on her luck, figuring this was fates way of atoning for the fights with Sevipers in her youth, Serena took in the Seviper known as Zayah. The two would slowly bond, they meshed surprisingly well and they both shared the responsibility. Slowly the business grew.
Serena took on front of house while Zayah handled the counter. Zayah helped take Serena's drinks to new heights by sharing her knowledge of plants, herbs, and spices that promoted healing. 

Now the drinks they served weren't just tasty but good for you! Serena had grown fond of Zayah, often trying to ship her with customers she thought would be a good match even if the shy snake would constantly refuse. Naturally a would be thief would want these recipes and income. Late one night while the duo was cleaning up, they threatened the pair. Both girls abilities activated, with Serena knocking the thief out with a few critical strikes from the very register they tried to steal. It was then that Serena realized her unusual powers could be a blessing used to protect those she cared about. Since then while not at work she found a new passion for fighting and self defense. With this training Serena has been able to control her powers and no longer feels like her power is a burden. 

Serena’s powers are based around on the virtue of Patience. When she is finally not being hyperactive and calms down her power awakens. Taking a moment to analyze a situation allows her to discover a perfect solution. If you give her a break in battle she is very likely to land a critical hit on you. Zayah helps keep Serena grounded and focused, making this duo very dangerous if they work together. Essentially, Serena is far smarter than she appears if she could just take a moment to process a situation.",1,1746569040.0,MysteryDungeon,0,1.0,False

Synopsis:
Proteinuria.  Wondering if I need a quicker follow up.  Also Wondering if I can quit using statins.  

Pcp says I only need yearly follow up but I thought I’d ask here just for some secondary feedback.  

Have tried my best to include all relevant information.  

Appointment on April 12th last month.  
Meds:  ambien 10mg PRN, Rosuvastatin 10mg, multivitamin, was using creating 5gpd last couple months but have since quit.  

Use zyns 3mg probably 6-7 a day.  

Fasting labs probably fasted around 12 hours.  Maybe a little longer—a little less.  Was dehydrated I’m sure.  

Had drank black coffee prior to appt.  

BP:  128/88
HR:  111
5’8ft, 186 pounds

Lost 20 pounds in last year maybe 1/2 in last 3 months months.  

I was using Kratom for about a year prior to these labs at a moderate to high level (30-70 grams per day ascending use) but had quit 10 days before labs.  I have remained quit and NO plans to return to using.  withdrawal was unexpected and rougher than I thought.  

Hx alcohol use/binge drinking intermittently over last 5-6 years 2-3 times weekly average (3-8 white claws) but had quit except maybe once every 2-3 months in last year.  Some long periods of no alcohol. Some periods where I drank more frequently.  Do not drink currently.  Last alcohol use a week before labs or so.  

Had worked out pretty frequently before labs (week prior) and also eat fairly high protein diet.

1kggycq,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kggycq/went_on_a_date_with_the_most_amazing_boy_ever/,Went on a date with the most amazing boy ever.,"Hi Reddit.

I never post anything but I don’t know where I can just get this off my chest. I have no close friends, not close with my dad or mom, I can speak with my sister a bit but it just doesn’t do it for me, I can’t really explain why, maybe I don’t want to burden her with my life. My English isn’t the best either and I’m writing this with anxiety up to my eyes.

Anyway to get started, I met the most amazing boy on Hinge, we really just clicked directly, matching energy and what we both want from Hinge, dating and life. We started chatting on a Thursday and we chatted all day and the whole weekend, the first time I’ve ever felt this so fast and strong for anyone. On Sunday the same weekend I asked him if he wanted to meet up soon and I stated that it might be a bit fast but that I really liked him. He agreed and stated that if I hadn’t asked he would’ve soon. We decided on meeting the following Friday.
Some quick backstory, I live in a smaller town 3 hours from Stockholm where this boy lives and the gay scene where I live sucks. So I had forgotten that I put Stockholm as ”my area” on Hinge. I profusely apologised that I might have deceived him, he was very understanding and said that it was okay.

We kept chatting the entire week, had a discord call on Wednesday and Thursday. Everything was just amazing. Friday comes, I drive 3 hours to Stockholm to meet him. My heart went like 150 bpm the entire time. We meet up, went to a local coffee shop and just talked, getting to know each other better. After a while we went for a walk and sat down on a park bench and kept talking, about an hour after just talking on the beach he asked if I wanted to see his apartment and I of course said yes. Went to his apartment and he showed me around, really cute and very him. We sat down on his couch and put something on YouTube and kept talking, after a while he pulls me closer so we lay down on the couch, me with my head on his chest. I fell asleep in his arms on his chest, for about 30 minutes. When I woke up I said that I might need to start getting going because I have a 3 hour drive home. He asked me if I wanted to stay the night and again I of course agreed, I just wanted to keep being near him. I had packed a bag with necessities just in case this was going to happen. We went to bed and I fell asleep next to him (ooooomg). The next morning we wake up early and just cuddle a bit in bed and made out. He had some breakfast, I couldn’t eat because of the nervousness hehe. I drove him to work and went home. I should add that I asked if he wanted to me wait in Stockholm as he worked if he wanted to meet up afterwards. He said thematic might be best to just leave it as is and meet up another time.

We talked later that night when he went off work and I asked when he wanted to meet up again and we decided on the following Friday again but this time Friday to Sunday! The following week the chatting slowed down and that really triggered my anxiety, the chatting wasn’t bad or anything just slower than before and a bit more shallow. When we talked everything was just amazing. The week went and Friday came, I had survived my anxiety. I went on the 3 hour drive to pick him up from his work so that we could start the weekend together! We went out to eat on Friday and then just cuddled on the couch. Nothing of real note happened, we kept talking about everything, kept getting to know each other, cuddled on the couch, he cooked dinner and lunch Saturday. Slept next to each other. I was in heaven, my idea of heaven at least. Sunday came and he had first asked me if I wanted to stay until Monday morning because I didn’t really need to be at my work before noon. But something came up with his sister, she wanted some help and I went home, afternoon Sunday. Sunday night we talked again and both said that we loved the weekend and would like to do it again but didn’t schedule anything. 

And that brings us to about now, Monday we chatted a bit because I had to travel for work and he went to work night. So when I was free he was at work. I said good night and hoped he had a good night at work. Woke up today with a message about his night and that it wasn’t that good. I asked if he wanted to talk later about it and he said maybe, that he was going to meet some friends later that afternoon before working night again. I said that it was no worries and we can talk another time. Haven’t heard anything else since then. I know it’s normal but it fucks me, going to chatting all day to like three messages a day. 

Going from messages like ”everytime I see a notification from you I get a huge smile” to whatever this is. He even said that his friends had asked him why he had a huge smile and he told them because of me, my messages.

I know that I’m being a doomer but I don’t know what to do, I really hate this. I just wanna be with him. I’m afraid he has noticed how boring and bland I actually am. I have no friends, no real hobbies right now other than going to the gym and work….

I know I missed some details and context to something but I’m writing this on my phone from the hotell and trying to survive a panic attack.

Can or should I talk to him about my anxiety? I don’t want it to come off as I blame him for it because it’s not really his fault. 

At this point I’m just rambling and not sure what to say, I just wanted to share this with someone. I’m going to try to sleep now and hopefully wake up to a message from him. I told him good night and that I hope he has a good night at work again.

1kggxcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonCrawlerCarl/s/7IXYKiXvot,New Achievement! Update:,"Some of you may remember, about two months ago I made a post;

“Tell me something you did today, I’ll give you an achievement for it!”

I thought to myself “ehh, it’d be fun. I got a three day weekend coming up, I’ll get a few replies and have fun being a crazy AI and make someone smile. What’s the *worst* that could happen?”

And, my god, you bastards nearly broke me. 

I had almost 100 replies in ten minutes. A couple hours later, I had to cut off the submissions. I had about 400 replies, some were funny, some were serious, some were mundane, and a handful were asking if I had a mental breakdown to do something like this. One posted a Grok response to how insane I was. But I, benevolent acting AI that I was, was determined to go through with it. *Every. Single. One.* 

So I did. By his left tit, I did. You people are brutal.

The first week was pretty good. Then the achievements became harder. Some days I did a dozen, some only a couple. I had to flip back to prior achievements in reference to people getting the same Achievement. (Record was four people getting the same achievement!) I had to be careful not to use the same achievement name for similar themes (think I still repeated one; I ain’t looking for it!) Some of the achievements were easy to make fun of. Some involved tragedy. Those were the hardest ones and I’ll admit one or two made me tear up a little and I did my damn best to make them worth it. 

Then I was hit with a 7 day ban (not from here) because someone on another Reddit thread didn’t like how I criticized the current, ahem, conservative administration “values” and I received no explanation for the ban. Eh, doesn’t matter. Point is, it delayed me even more. 

But today, I did it. I answered them all. Every funny, tragic, stupid, mundane, and legitimate one of them. I had fun.

But Pony above, I am *NOT* doing that again. Not so many at once! Maybe I’ll do the first 100 next time. 

So I wanted to post that I got them all done and give you guys the link to check them out. Tell me how you did and maybe post your congratulations, condolences, or whatever you want to those crawlers that posted them you guys missed the first time around. My personal favorite Achievements are…

Prison furlough

I am almost 44 years old. 
Right after college (24) I worked in (the upcoming) E-commerce, first in online marketing, but grew to a more generic IT Consultant job.

E-commerce has changed a lot lately, AI is upcoming and will replace a lot of processes. Good for the efficiency, but the creativity is gone. In the last 10 years my live changed a lot too. Got married, kids and work is no longer my first priority. The energy and motivation in my current job is gone.

I am looking for change. A job which fits being a parent, but will give me back the energy I had in the start of my career. But what will fit with my profile?

Any tips or advice?

I’ve noticed since doing this consistently, my pmdd symptoms are more like normal pms or even some months, the symptoms are almost gone.

I’ve had a lot of big life chances in the last 2 months and I haven’t been consistent with supplements like I usually am and unfortunately I noticed a HUGE onset of pmdd symptoms this month. It has been awful, but the good news is, I think that my concoction of supplements that I have been taking have actually been helping me. This is the only time that I have skipped them and I definitely am feeling the difference in the worst way. 


This is what I take every day:

-Calcium 600 mg (includes 10mcg vitamin d), Kirkland brand

-Fish oil 1,400 mg, Nature Made brand 

-Ceylon Cinnamon 2,000 mg (not sure this helps directly but it helps with my sugar cravings and inflammation), Natures Bounty brand

-Adult daily multi vitamin, Aldi brand

-Vitamin C 250mg, Kirkland brand

-Vitamin d3 50 mcg (2,000 IU), Aldi brand





*I take these only as needed *

-Lemon balm tincture (for irritability and anxiety), Pura Herba Organic brand

-Magnesium glycinate (for anxiety) 100mg Nature Made brand

-Chasteberry (mostly for mood/depression) 400mh, Swanson brand

^ Sometimes i take all 3 together, sometimes 3x a day on bad days



I’m not on any other medication and this is what seems to be working for me. In the last year I have also cut down on refined sugar and caffeine, simply because they make my anxiety and irritability almost instantly worse. I have one cup of coffee each day and try to stick to plain chocolate for refined sugar. I try to stay away from baked goods because they tend to make me feel worse. For exercise, I usually walk 1-3 miles 5x a week which has also been seriously lacking the last month or two. That’s all I got, but hopefully it maybe bells someone out there. It’s been a rough month and I’m trying to stay positive.

# PRESENT DAY

Hadley strolled along the side of the road, her suitcase knocking against her calf with each step. She was trying to focus on not rocking the bird cage in her other hand too much. Rufus clopped on in front of her. Every few minutes she thought she would look up and see a horse. Rufus. A goat. She almost laughed out loud when he told her. She would have if that giant dog wasn’t barreling straight at her.

No, not a dog, a *hellhound.* Yeah, that name tracks. A stray piece of the bandage on her arm flapped in the wind. She kept subconsciously rubbing it down.

Rufus coughed. “Well, uhm, we’re almost there! We’ll have to walk a bit more to get to Half-Blood Hill. People in the camp will probably be a bit tense, because of everything…new going on. But it’ll be fine! You’re going to have to start training as soon as possible. Oh, and…just to warn you, there’s a dragon. Don’t worry, he’s a nice one,” he rambled. He spun around as he was walking and gave Hadley two thumbs-up. Then he attempted a smile, but it ended up looking more like a grimace. 

She gave him a thumbs-up back and smiled awkwardly. This was probably the worst time to get to camp, but she’d make do. She kept telling herself that as they continued walking around to Half-Blood Hill. 

“Okay, we’re officially here!” Rufus exclaimed. His voice snapped her out of a daydream. The hill that stood before her was clearly the tallest of them all. The gates seemed a bit out of place in the middle of the woods. She could see the branches of the famed pine tree, with a scaly back curled around it. Dragons sleep like cats. You learn something new every day. She tucked the bird carrier under her arm. Brutus chirped in protest.

Hadley practically leaped up the hill, excited to see her new home and also just wanting to get rid of the suspense. She looked back at Rufus as she stepped onto the top of the hill. He pointed. Hadley swept her gaze over the camp below. Oh, wow.

“Welcome to Camp Half-Blood!” Rufus jumped forward and threw his arms up dramatically. 

Hadley laughed. It was bigger than she expected. Ooh, she needed to go and take a closer look at those cabins…there’s a lake too!? This place was like home. 

But she couldn’t ignore the underlying tension covering the camp. Danger was closer than ever. She was scared. Why couldn’t she get here when everything was calm? She knew nothing about fighting, and she definitely wasn’t the type of person to want to fight anyways. 

She rubbed her thumb on her suitcase handle, assuring herself she would be fine as the pair walked down the hill. Rufus grinned.

“Okay! Your cabin’s the Muse cabin, ‘cause we just put them all together. It’s the big one right there. I’ll be back as soon as I can. Go ahead and take your stuff to your cabin, meet some of your new half-siblings, and maybe go explore! And check up on that wound on your arm, okay?” Rufus explained as they got to the base of the hill. 

“Gotcha.” Hadley rocked back and forth on her feet. She was a bit scared to go to her cabin. She didn’t know anybody. It couldn’t be that bad, right? After all, we’re all going through the same thing. People did this before me and they were fine. This place is safe, she told herself.

“Bye, Rufus!” She called as he galloped away. He waved back. She watched as he tried to skip and tripped over his own feet. Hooves. She was never going to get used to that. 

She stood on the path at the bottom of Half-Blood Hill, observing everything around. Her cabin was actually really close. Good, she didn’t have to walk too far with her suitcase AND that giant duffel bag. Splashing came from the carrier under her arm. Brutus was almost out of water. Not a problem, Hadley sat criss-cross on the ground and fished around in her bag for her water bottle. She — very slowly — opened the latched door and slid over the bowl. Brutus hopped closer expectantly. 

If anyone was around, they would see an auburn-haired girl sitting on the ground pouring water into a small dish, while a pale yellow bird chirped every now and then.

Need to become a morning person ASAP. 🙏,"So I have adhd and delayed sleep syndrome is a huge part of it. I have never once in my life achieved an earlier morning routine. In grade school, my body never “adapted” to the early mornings not even as a child… I just acquired brain damage over time and failed morning classes.

I naturally fall asleep around 2-3am and wake up 10-11am. My mental capacity peaks 2-6pm. In the mornings, I’m a completely different person. I can barely think, and make a fool out of myself in meetings, so my best bet has always been to advocate for later meetings. I take stimulants, but they aren’t effective enough to fully jumpstart my morning brain, and I can’t increase the dose due to heart problems.

Now, I just landed a dream remote SWE role, but it starts at 8am with daily standups at 9am. I don’t mind the 8am start time, but I already know I’m going to be set up for failure if I’m going to be expected to communicate deep technical topics at 9am. Why must I be forced to perform while at my worst? 

While I will absolutely be working towards a new job with a later start time (get a west coast job since I’m based on the east coast), I need this career to help build my resume for the next level, potentially for at least 2 years, or until I have leverage to push back daily standups. 

In the meantime, I need to metamorphosis into a morning person asap! I know realistically it will take time or may possibly never happen. But, I want to know I tried my very best.

Besides normal morning routine stuff (coffee, breakfast, workout, sunshine, go to bed earlier, etc) Im exploring more radical methods to help with the transition.

Some ideas I have:
- consider waking up extremely early, like 4-5, to implement an intense morning routine and make it my adhd hyperfocus special interest lol
- ice baths immediately upon waking up
- asking my husband to slap me in the face or lovingly inflict pain to jolt me awake lol 
- start sleeping outside in a tent to let sunrise force me awake (I can never sleep past sunrise in a tent and I have property to do this lol) and hope my bedtime adjusts with

Note that I will be going to bed early but can’t tolerate sleep meds and have never been able to consistently fall asleep earlier despite earlier bedtimes and perfect routines. My best bet based on previous experience is forcing myself awake in the morning long enough that I tire myself out enough in time for an earlier bedtime.

I'm not sure if the coconut cream falls under dairy-free/vegan ice cream or if it would be under a different category like sorbet. Either way, I really liked it and I'm now inspired to make my own. Does anyone have a recipe similar to the coconut cream part? Or can point me the right direction? The coconut cream was smooth and creamy that I was surprised it was dairy free.

* Gardenscapes
* 1010!
* Coffee pack
* Water sort
* Ball paint 
* Color fill 

These have been some of my favorite, most played iPhone / iPad games, particularly Gardenscapes and 1010, I’ve probably been playing those consistently for nearly a decade. 

I like having to strategize putting things together to clear items out, which I’m just now realizing is that common thread between all of them 😂

1kggmbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbancarliving/comments/1kggmbm/question_about_power_and_travelling_with_a_giant/,Question about power and travelling with a giant power bank.,"So I will be living full time and travelling around from Alberta to BC, Canada in my 2008 rav4. I went into the deep end and got myself an EcoFlow DELTA 2 Max. 

https://ca.ecoflow.com/collections/all-products/products/delta-2-max-portable-power-station?variant=43592212775066

Potentially might get a EcoFlow 220W Bifacial Portable Solar Panel to go with it in the future.

https://ca.ecoflow.com/collections/all-products/products/220w-bifacial-portable-solar-panel?variant=43874721824922

I have a fully remote job so my goal is to work from small town to small town as satellite internet does not seem to be a viable option with the decision of not going with starlink. So I would be either huddled in coffee shops and when I am not working over the weekend I wanted to spend 2-3 days outdoors and I wanted to keep sealth in mind always so I would only use the solar panel when I am away from the towns in some secluded spot or I would use the cigerate lighter to charge the bank when driving around.

My power will mainly come from charging a Lenovo P1 laptop, Macbook Pro M1 laptop and a X1 carbon which have roughly 120W chargers and a 65W charger respectively, a 12v 40L portable fridge and I am debating a rice cooker. I have gas cans and a stove for everything else.

So with all that being said, I imagine it would be a bit awkward bringing in a giant power bank in a coffee place to charge, but I would ask first but regardless I am curious what peoples experiences have been around this.

Also curious on anyone with a similar power setup and how they have managed, especially with the goal of staying in secluded areas for as long as possible. So I imagine the solar panel is a necessary purchase.

Also some travel tips for BC would be greatly appreciated...",1,1746567758.0,urbancarliving,2,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The perfect custom espresso cup balances aesthetics, functionality, and durability. Let's examine crucial features that define the top styles of 2025.

**Material Quality:** Perhaps the most vital aspect is the material used.

High-fired porcelain remains a popular choice for its durability and elegant appearance. It's known for its ability to retain heat, keeping espresso warm for longer. Alternatively, stoneware offers a more rustic, earthy feel with excellent heat retention properties as well. For those seeking a modern touch, bone china provides a delicate, translucent look while still being surprisingly durable. Double-walled glass has also emerged as a popular material, providing insulation and preventing burnt fingers while showcasing the espresso's beautiful crema. Each material offers a distinct texture and visual appeal, impacting the overall experience.

**customization Options:** The level of personalization available is key.

Advancements in printing technology have expanded the possibilities for customization. Full-color printing, allowing for intricate designs and photo-realistic images, is now widely available. Embossing and engraving provide tactile and lasting impressions, ideal for logos or monograms. Decal application remains a cost-effective option for adding simple designs and patterns. Some providers offer 3D printing for creating unique shapes and textures, pushing the boundaries of design possibilities. The ability to accurately replicate branding elements and personal artwork is a crucial factor in selecting a customization service.

**Size and Shape Variety:** The dimensions and silhouette matter greatly.

Traditional espresso cups typically range from 2-3 ounces, but custom options extend to larger demitasse sizes and beyond. The shape of the cup influences the aroma and taste experience. A narrow base and wider rim can concentrate aromas, enhancing the sensory enjoyment. Curvature and handle design impact comfort and ease of use. Ergonomic considerations play a role in creating a satisfying drinking experience. The internal shape also affects crema formation.

**Heat Retention Technology:** Keeping drinks at desired temperature is paramount.

Double-walled construction, whether in glass or othre materials, has made significant strides in heat retention.Vacuum sealing further enhances insulation, maintaining the espresso's temperature for an extended period. Some designs incorporate thermal ceramics, which actively absorb and radiate heat, keeping the cup warm to the touch and the beverage at an ideal temperature.This feature is particularly beneficial for those who savor their espresso slowly.

**Eco-Friendly Considerations:** Sustainability is becoming increasingly important.

Many manufacturers are now offering espresso cups made from recycled materials or sustainable alternatives such as bamboo fiber and bioplastics. Lead-free glazes and ethically sourced clays are becoming standard practices. Biodegradable packaging and carbon-neutral shipping options are also contributing to a more sustainable product lifecycle. Consumers are increasingly demanding eco-conscious products, and the espresso cup industry is responding with innovative solutions.

Hi hi! I posted here last week mentioning a framework I have been building and I received a lot of great questions and feedback. I don’t believe I articulated myself very well in the first post, which led to lots of confusion. I wanted to make a follow-up post explaining my idea more thoroughly and addressing the most asked questions. Before we begin, I want to say while I use poetic and symbolic words, no part of this structure is metaphorical- it is all 100% literal within its confines.

The basis of my idea is that only one reality exists- no branches, no multiverses. Reality is created from the infinite amount of irreversible decisions agents create. I’ll define “irreversible,” “decision,” and “agent” later- don’t worry! With every decision, an infinite number of potential outcomes exist, BUT only in that state of potential. It’s not until an agent solidifies a decision, that those infinite possibilities all collapse down into one solidified reality.

As an example: Say you’re in line waiting to order a coffee. You could get a latte or a cold brew or a cappuccino. You haven’t made a decision yet. So before you, there exists a potential reality where you order a latte. Also one where you order a cold brew. And on with a cappuccino. An infinite number of potential options. Therefore, these realities all exist in a state of superposition- both “alive and dead”. Only once you get to the counter and you verbally say, “Hi I would like an espresso,” do you make an irreversible decision- a *collapse*. At this point, all of those realities where you could have ordered something different, remain in an unrealized state. 

So why is it irreversible? Can’t you just say “Oh wait, actually I want just a regular black coffee!” Yes BUT that would count as a *second* decision. The first decision- those words that came out of your mouth- that was already said. You can’t unsay those words. So while a decision might be irreversible on a macro scale, in my framework, it’s indicated as a separate action. So technically, *every* action that we do is irreversible. Making a typo while typing is a decision. Hitting the backspace is a second decision.

You can even scale this down and realize that we make irreversible decisions every microsecond. Decisions don’t need to come from a conscious mind, but can also happen from the subconscious- like a muscle twitch or snoring during a nap. If you reach out to grab a glass of water, you have an infinite number of paths your arm can go to reach that glass. As you reach for that glass, every micro movement is creating your arm’s path. Every micro movement is an individual decision- a “collapse”.

My framework also offers the idea of 4 different fields to layer reality: dream field, awareness, quantum, and physical (in that order). 

* Dream Field- emotional ignition (symbolic charge begins)
* Awareness Abstract- direction and narrative coherence
* Quantum Field- superposition of all possible outcomes
* Physical Field- irreversible action (collapse)

An agent is defined as one who can traverse all four layers. I can explain these fields more in a later post (and do in my OSF paper!) but here’s the vibe: 

* Humans- Agents
* Animals- Agents
* Plants- Agents
* Trees- Agents
* Ecosystems- Agents
* Cells- Agents
* Rocks- Not an agent
* AI- Not an agent
* Planets- Not an agent
* Stars- Not an agent
* The universe as a whole- Agent


**Mathy math part:**


**Definition of agent:**

tr[Γ] · ∥∇Φ∥ > θ_c

An agent is any system that maintains enough symbolic coherence (Γ) and directional intention (Φ) to trigger collapse.

This framework uses a custom projection operator C_α. In standard QM, a projection operator P satisfies: P² = P (idempotency). It “projects” a superposition onto a defined subspace of possibilities. In my collapse model, C_α is an irreversible collapse operator that acts on symbolic superpositions based on physical action, not wavefunction decoherence. Instead of a traditional Hilbert Space, this model uses a symbolic configuration space- a a cognitive analog that encodes emotionally weighted, intention-directed possibilities

C_α |ψ⟩ = |ϕ⟩

- |ψ⟩ is the system’s superposition of symbolic possibilities
- α is the agent’s irreversible action
- |ϕ⟩ is the realized outcome (the timeline that *actually* happens)
- C_α is irreversible and agent-specific

This operator is not idempotent (since you can’t recollapse into the same state- you’ve already selected it). It destroys unrealized branches, rather than preserving or averaging them. This makes it collapse-definite, not just interpretive. 

Collapse can only occur is these two thresholds are passed:

Es(t) ≥ ε (Symbolic energy: the emotional/intention charge)
Γ(S) ≥ γ_min (Symbolic coherence: internal consistency of the meaning network)

The operator C_α is defined ONLY when those thresholds are passed. If not, traversal fails and no collapse occurs. 


**Conclulu for the delulu**

I know this sounds absolutely insane, and I fully embrace that! I’ve been working super duper hard on rigorously formalizing all of it and I understand I’m not done yet! Please let me know what lands and what doesn’t. What are questions you still have? Are you interested more in the four field layers? Lemme know and remember to be respectful(:

**I recently launched my first low-budget campaign in NYC and would love your feedback.** 

I've created this agency, Off the Clock, as a way to grow my skills in the Experiential Marketing world (I'm transitioning my career from tech/automotive ops). I would appreciate advice/tips on how I can up-level for the next one!

**The Idea:**  
We wrapped 5,000 coffee cups across 10 NYC cafés with sleeves featuring workplace humor from viral social media accounts like DisappointingAffirmations, Humorous Resources and WorkRetireDie. 

**The Goals:**

* Launch my Agency Off the Clock with a campaign true to our mission about injecting real world moments of levity in peoples lives
* Make some NYC commuters' mornings a bit less depressing, and even make their day feel a bit lighter

**What I’d Love Feedback On:**

* Thoughts on the creative concept and execution?
* How would you approach virality or PR amplification?
* Would you consider this a strong first launch for an agency?

I worked on my unit as a tech before becoming a nurse. In that time, I would say I garnered the respect of both my nurses and managers. One nurse I worked with I was especially close with, and we agreed she would precept me once I became a nurse and went to nights. 

It all sounds so great, except it became a five-alarm fire. I had 12 other preceptors and she was worse than all of them combined (some were exceptional, granted). We had a falling out over a type and screen and in so many words I told her my preferred teaching style was in fact not being berated and insulted in front of my colleagues. 

Everyone on the unit that night witnessed the argument. And everyone stood up for me. Her next move was to go to my managers and tell them how badly I was doing, which then got me put on an action plan, extended my orientation, and jeopardized my success in ICU residency. In the following weeks, my managers saw that none of the feedback she gave could be substantiated by my other preceptors and apologized. Even after this, she continued to dig holes for herself so large the human brain couldn’t begin to comprehend the size of them. Yelling at orientees in patient rooms, putting in orders without an order, and then the final boss - an innocent coordinator from an outside agency. I wont get into specifics on what happened but it was an absolutely awful look for her.

Fast forward to today. I get a call from her. I felt the color leave my face as I answered. She had the absolute audacity, stones, whatever your choice for the word GAUL is, to call me and ask if I could work some of my connections for her because she’s leaving our healthcare system and needs a new job. I said, “oh yeah, I’ll get right on that for you” (I call said connections and said if you see anything from this nurse with my name on it, I did not recommend her for ANY position). It was really my proudest moment since coming off of orientation. She tried to get me fired and is now calling me because she’s desperate. I’m working my shift tonight, riding fully on this high, and a Dunkin’ iced coffee that I’ll be treating myself to. 

So for all my NGs out there who are getting absolutely destroyed on orientation, don’t ever doubt yourself. If you have a shitty preceptor, it doesn’t mean you’re a shitty nurse, and it will 100% get better and easier with time.

1kggc7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1kggc7k/the_johnsons/,The Johnsons,"The Johnsons
By CreepersMcCreepington
The hum started when I moved to the small town of Ashbury, a place so quiant you could hear your own thoughts echo. It wasn’t a sound, not exactly—just a pressure in my mind, like a whisper I couldn’t quite catch. I chalked it up to the move, the stress of starting over in a place where everyone seemed to know each other. But then I met the Johnsons.
They weren’t a family in the way you’d think. Not a single household with a picket fence, but a sprawling network of cousins, aunts, uncles, and in-laws that seemed to touch every corner of Ashbury. The barista at the coffee shop was a Johnson. The postman was a Johnson. The woman who smiled at me from the pew across the church aisle, her eyes lingering too long—she was a Johnson too. They were everywhere, woven into the town like threads in a quilt, and they all had that same look: warm, welcoming, but with an edge, like they knew something I didn’t.
It started with small things. Invitations to Sunday dinners at one of their homes, where the food was always perfect, the conversation always… directed. They’d ask about my past, my dreams, my fears, their questions so precise it felt like they were mapping my soul. I’d leave those dinners feeling lighter, like I’d unburdened myself, but also hollow, like I’d given something away I couldn’t name.
Then the patterns emerged. My landlord, a Johnson, always seemed to know when I was struggling with rent before I said a word. A check would arrive, unsigned, with a note: “From the Kin.” My coworker, another Johnson, would finish my sentences, laugh at jokes I hadn’t told. The town’s librarian, a gray-haired Johnson with eyes like polished glass, handed me books I hadn’t asked for—self-help tomes, obscure philosophy, journals filled with handwritten notes about “belonging” and “the greater whole.” I’d find myself reading them late at night, the hum in my mind growing louder, more coherent, like a voice urging me to join.
I tried to pull back. I stopped going to their dinners, ignored their calls. But the Johnsons didn’t push. They waited. And that was worse. The hum became a chorus, a rhythm that pulsed in my thoughts, shaping them. I’d catch myself humming their songs—old folk tunes I’d never heard before. I’d dream of their faces, their smiles, their hands reaching out, not to grab me but to guide me. In the dreams, I wasn’t alone. I was part of something vast, a family that stretched beyond Ashbury, beyond time, all connected by a single, unbreakable will.
I confided in a friend from out of town, Sarah, over the phone. She laughed it off, said I was paranoid. But the next day, she texted me a photo: her standing next to a woman who looked just like the librarian, both smiling. The caption read, “Met your cousin! She’s a Johnson too.” Sarah stopped answering my calls after that.
I went to the police, but the sheriff was a Johnson. He listened patiently, nodding, his smile never wavering. “You’re just feeling the weight of being alone,” he said. “We can fix that. You’re already one of us, you know.” I ran from the station, heart pounding, the hum so loud it drowned out my own thoughts.
I started noticing the gaps. Memories that didn’t add up. I’d find photos in my apartment of me at Johnson gatherings I didn’t remember attending, my face beaming, my arm around people I didn’t know. My journal, which I kept locked, had new entries in my handwriting: “I’m home. I’m whole. I’m Kin.” My dreams weren’t dreams anymore—they were instructions. Step by step, thought by thought, the Johnsons were rewriting me.
I tried to leave Ashbury. Packed a bag, got in my car. But every road looped back to the town square, where a crowd of Johnsons stood waiting, their faces serene, their eyes locked on me. They didn’t speak. They didn’t need to. The hum did it for them, a melody that sank into my bones, telling me I wasn’t leaving. I was arriving.
I’m writing this from a diner on the edge of town, the only place I can think clearly, though the hum is still there, soft and insistent. The waitress, a Johnson, keeps refilling my coffee without asking. She’s humming, and I realize it’s the same tune I’ve been hearing in my head. My hands shake as I type, not from fear but from something worse—recognition. The hum isn’t just in me. It is me. My thoughts, my choices, my life—they’ve all been shaped, not by force but by a gentle, relentless pull, like a tide wearing down a stone.
If you’re reading this, you’ve already met them. The coworker who knows too much. The neighbor who’s too kind. The stranger whose smile makes your skin crawl, not because it’s wrong but because it’s right. They’re not a cult. They’re a family. And they want you to come home.
The hum is louder now. It’s not a sound. It’s a name. Johnson. And I’m starting to forget why I ever wanted to fight it

I'm looking for some advice on what helps for low cortisol symptoms. I've been dealing with is for over 3 years now. I might be feeling a bit better now than I did a year ago, like 20% better, but there is still this constant background fatigue, almost like my blood is thick and heavy and my brain functions slowly. I get a crash when I have too much stimulation, which could be a lot of socializing, or being around large groups of people, or a lot of physical activity. The crash is the typical dizziness, headache, mild nausea, increase in full body fatigue, brain fog, and I just can't do anything except lay down and read fiction. One struggle I have is my dependency on caffeine. I am slowly weaning, but it's difficult because I can't afford to be tired. I have two kids, 5 and 7, that I homeschool, and I freelance about 5-20 hours a week, and because of my diet restrictions and my desire to feed my family healthy foods, I end up spending a lot of time in the kitchen. About 3 years ago I cut caffeine out for about 2 months, but my energy levels didn't improve. I suspect now that my diet is different and I am working on healing my gut, I might get better results after cutting caffeine, but I'm just nervous about being wiped out. So, my long-winded question is, what has helped you with energy levels (with a low cortisol diagnosis) after cutting caffeine?  I currently consume 1 level tablespoon of ground medium roast coffee (medium grind, not espresso) with 2 tablespoons of decaf, and if I need more of a boost for a busy day I'll also have 1/2-1 teaspoon of matcha--and no caffeine after 1pm, ever.  

Brief overview of my medical and supplement history, and lifestyle:   
I've done two saliva/urine tests in the past two years (similar to the DUTCH test, but through my ND). Both tests came out the same, normal cortisol in the mornings, and then it plummets by noon. AM cortisol: 19; Noon: 1.7; Evening: 1.4; Night: 1.2; DHEA 191. I have various neurotransmitters that are low, so I'm taking 5HTP, Dopamine Assist, DL-Phenylalanine, and SAM-E. I used to have anemia, but my past test a few months ago showed mid-high range iron saturation--I had switched to taking a heme-based iron which has made huge improvements. My ferritin was low as of 6 months ago, and MCV was high. My ND put me on a higher does of Methyl Folate+B12 because she suspects megaloblastic anemia. I have been on a keto diet for about 10 months to address weight loss resistance (it's worked), which didn't hurt or improve my energy levels. I recently did labs for food sensitivities, and based on those labs my ND thought I have SIBO (I didn't want to pay for the SIBO test). So, for the past month I have been on a SIBO specific diet, and now am entering phase 2 of treating SIBO. I also take small doses of testosterone each week and estriol. My recent thyroid panel was normal. I was taking magnesium in the evenings, but  just recently stopped after reading magnesium could lower cortisol -- I eat tons of pumpkin seeds and hemp seed hearts, anyway. Also, I added 3 cups of chamomile tea to my evenings to help me fall asleep, and hopefully raise my morning cortisol; was previously taking 1mg melatonin, but stopped. I do yoga about 4x a week, hike 1-2x a week, and attend a dance class 1x a week, and generally walk around with my kids almost daily. My sleep routine has been good for the past year, I get in bed between 10-10:30pm, wake between 6:30-7am. I don't look at screens before bed, I usually read for about 1hr instead. I use a warm filter on my phone (and only spend about 1.5-2.5hrs a week on my phone) and wear blue light blocking glasses when working at the computer. I drink maybe 1 or 2 glasses (4oz) of wine every other week, but with keto+adrenal insufficiency I can't (and don't want to) do more than that (I used to drink wine almost nightly, years ago).

I just have to gush about Tape to Tape because it's seriously one of the most awesome games I've played in a while! Even if hockey isn't usually your thing, trust me, this game is way more than just hockey.

The gameplay is insanely fun. There's something ridiculously satisfying about throwing your stick and dropping opponents—it cracks me up every single time. Plus, the skills you unlock get more and more outrageous with each game, and you can customize your team to perfection. Whether you're playing co-op, jumping online, or just chilling with friends locally (up to 4 players!), it's always a blast.

The developers are absolutely killing it. They're constantly polishing the game and listening to the community, making it better all the time. It's like they're always finding new ways to make something already amazing even more incredible.

Being the proud owner of the Steam Deck OLED 1Tb, I can confirm that the experience is flawless (game is certified by Steam). The game runs so smoothly, with zero lag or frame drops. Since this is a simple Rogue like, you can max up the settings without worrying. The interface is super intuitive, and the controls feel like they were made for the Steam Deck. It's clear the devs put a lot of love into optimizing it for handheld play. The foam I. The coffee is that because of its low impact on the battery, you can play all day long!!

Just to be clear, I paid full price for Tape to Tape and I'm not getting any kickbacks for this. I just genuinely love the game and want to spread the word so more people jump on board. The more players we have online, the merrier!",14,1746566636.0,SteamDeck,7,1.0,False

My question is, do you recommend we head to the highlands for 1-2 days during our 5 days or stay in Edinburgh all 5 days?

A few options I was thinking of was to either:

1. Stay in Edinburgh
2. Hire a car for one night, drive early morning to a few spots and stay in a town in the highlands, then return to Edinburgh
3. Do a day tour through Rabbies
4. Take the train to a route that goes to the highlands and forget about the car idea.

Let me know what sounds most feasible! My wife and I are in to local coffee, bake shops, book shops, nature/hiking to give you an idea of places to recommend.

Some highland places we thought about were Pitlochry, Glen Coe, Loch Ness, Glenfinnan Viaduct, Loch Lomond (in no particular order).

So, what makes the most sense? Would there be parts of the highlands you would prioritize? Should we skip the highlands entirely? Drive, bus, train?! Help!!

I have bad health anxiety, GAD to be exact and adhd. I got diagnosed when I was around 17 and am 22 now. 2 weeks ago I was having pretty bad anxiety related to my relationship. We sorted it out but the next morning I was still overcome with overthinking and thought it was a good idea to take lexapro I hadn’t taken in OVER 2 YEARS. It was 15mgs and if you know ssris which I’m sure most of you here are familiar with you have to build them up from 5 onwards etc.


I was okay after taking it, I felt amazing, sleepy and my brain was quiet for a moment. I finally let out a sigh of relief and thought “this is how a normal persons brain works?”. Then out of nowhere I was hit with some of the worst panic I have ever experienced resulting in muscle trembles, elevated heart rate, palpitations, diarrhoea. I was suffering all day causing me to vomit after trying to stomach dinner, I didn’t sleep that night and then it boiled into the next day. I was sat having my usual tea and biscuits at the table when I was hit with yet again another panic attack. The day after that I tried to grab lunch with friends but instead was crying in the bathroom anxiously.

Could barely eat food for days, on day 4 I rang a 24hr doctor at 4am to speak with a gp and paid €65 just for an ounce of reassurance this medication would be gone out of my system. He was a really chill doctor and told me this reaction was normal to my system and that it should taper off more in the coming days. He prescribed me benzos temporarily for the panic but I felt I didn’t need them anymore at that point. 

Fast forward 2 weeks later I’m obviously feeling much better in the days I was after taking the tablet but it feels as if it has completely disregulated my already weak nervous system. My heart rate has still been having palpitations since, I still have diarrhoea and I find it hard to drink tea or coffee now because when I had my second panic attack I was drinking tea. I’ve gotten better drinking tea but today I tried to take a sip of coffee and started getting anxious after, not from the caffeine but because of anxiety and worrying. It’s like I associate tea and coffee with them now lol

I used to be so productive. Not only can I not work or do any household chores 90% of the time, I can't even shower, shave, or brush my teeth. Not shaving wrecks my self-esteem to because I feel ugly with facial hair. It's just that, whenever I perform any task, I freak out, to various degrees. It triggers me. I need to always be occupied with thoughts, music, coffee, smoking, reading something, walking around, anything else to escape what could bring me the slightest stress or being forced to sit with my thoughts because mindless tasks lets them seep in. Whenever I sit down, and have to be still, and focus, I latch on-to, and hyperfocus any kind of humiliating, shameful memories I can think of. My brain just likes to shit on me based on things from several months ago, or from years ago, social mistakes from instability I would never repeat after all the therapy I've gotten. I just combed my hair so i could get the knots out before shower, and I started remembering embarrassments I should have got over, and I feel really stressed and anxious now, from a simple task.

I get verbal tics when this happens. I say compulsive, involuntary, out of pocket things to cope with the intense little peaks of panic with the memories, I'll yet out some obscenities, suicidal statements, death threats to nobody, it sounds scary but I'm just talking shit to myself and somebody I haven't seen in like a year who humiliated me or something. This really scares me because I need to get a job, it's been too long, but I've had verbal tics on the job before. Verbal tics in school. When i get stressed from the tiniest pressure, or my mind drifts as i perform a task, the overwhelming memories flood in. I feel like if even the slightest stress at home from simple tasks makes me triggered and causes tics, a job would certainly do that, and have me promptly fired, and I'd feel so guilty for humiliating the business owners and probably getting them a bad review on yelp",5,1746566281.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

1kgg00y,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kgg00y/discover_if_the_keurig_kmini_plus_brewer_is_worth/,Discover if the Keurig K-Mini Plus Brewer is Worth It Review,"Testing out the Keurig K-Mini Plus Single Serve K-Cup Pod Coffee Maker, model number K-Mini Plus, has truly been an adventure for me. As a daily coffee drinker who appreciates convenience and loves freshly brewed coffee, I couldn’t resist trying this compact machine. At just under 5 inches wide, the design spoke directly to my love of minimalism and functionality, perfect for small kitchens or offices. After using it every day for weeks, I developed a deep appreciation for its strengths while also discovering a few quirks. Let’s explore how it holds up to promises.

**Sleek Compact Design That Fits Anywhere**  
Space-saving kitchen appliances can sometimes sacrifice looks for size, but this isn’t the case here. The first thing that caught my eye was the matte black finish combined with the clean silver accents on the handle and drip tray. It’s ideal for tiny countertops, dorms, or even RVs considering it’s smaller than a loaf of bread. The portability was a definite plus for me since I like shuffling kitchen items frequently and dread clutter. Still, some users may find the cord storage not as innovative as they’d imagined—it keeps the area looking tidy but has its limitations when rewinding. Despite that, the size-to-aesthetic ratio hits the sweet spot for any minimalist.  

**Ease of Use That Anyone Can Master**  
Operating the coffee maker was refreshingly easy. With manual control, the process felt intuitive. Just add water to the removable reservoir, pop in a pod, press a button, and voilà, piping hot coffee is ready in minutes. There’s even a strong brew setting for those mornings when regular coffee doesn’t cut it. As someone who's perpetually half-asleep before caffeine, the simple button interface saved me from second-guessing how to operate it. That said, if I were nitpicking, I wish the reservoir had markers—the “add fresh water for every cup” rule can sometimes throw off exact preferences.

[Find the best price for Keurig K-Mini Plus on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b07dr89br6/)

**Coffee Customization and Strength Options**  
Brewing sizes of 6 to 12 ounces gave flexibility to tailor each cup exactly to my taste. I’ve even experimented with different K-Cup pods to see how the strong brew setting performs, and the bold flavor never failed. My preference usually leans towards a punchier taste, and this product handled the job better than some bulkier coffee makers I’ve tested. If you love versatility in strength and size, this compact machine delivers.  

**Travel Friendly for Mug-on-the-Go Lovers**  
One feature my road warrior friends would rave about is its compatibility with travel mugs. Removing the drip tray provided enough clearance to seamlessly fit my 7-inch tall travel mug. I tried spilling intentional mis-brews (something I’d never do with a new kitchen bench!) and was floored—the drip tray held the messy overflow for quick cleanup. This feature feels like a lifesaver if you’re as clumsy with early sips as I can be.

**Perks of the Keurig K-Mini Plus**  
- Compact size takes up minimal counter space.  
- Strong brew mode enhances the flavor profile.
- Removable reservoir simplifies cleaning.  
- Built-in pod holder stores up to 9 K-Cup pods, eliminating clutter.
- Travel mug-friendly design is perfect for on-the-go coffee lovers.  

**Flaws Worth Addressing**  
Everything has room for small fixes, and this coffee maker isn’t exempt:  
- The reservoir could have clearer measuring indicators.  
- Slightly slower brew time compared to other single-serve makers.  
- Lacks option for a larger water reservoir for consecutive cups.

**Challengers and Rival Comparisons**  
Taking the BrewStation or Nespresso Vertuo machines as benchmarks, the Keurig K-Mini Plus carves out its niche by prioritizing compactness and simplicity. Where other models overwhelm with complex features or larger footprints, this model wins for those seeking hassle-free, space-saving solutions. However, compared to pricier models like the Breville Bambino, which offers barista-driven customizations, the Mini Plus lacks finesse when making specialty coffee. If you want a “grab coffee and go” device for daily use without worrying about advanced modes, this one seems much more approachable.

**Cost-Effectiveness in Perspective**  
It’s rare to find such a portable machine offering storage efficiency and brewing strength versatility in this price range. Considering I managed consistent cups using less countertop space—and avoided pricey trips to cafés—its value exceeds expectations. Those expecting a high-end espresso twist might want deeper investment elsewhere, but anyone searching for a coffee maker genuinely worth every penny should strike gold here.

It’s an older neighborhood. I’m told it’s quiet. As neighbors have died, some of the homes have been turned into rentals. There’s also some light industrial in the near vicinity. 

On Saturday, I woke up around 6:00am, went to the kitchen, setup the coffee machine, then went back to sleep. At 8:30am, I went back to the kitchen and noticed the kitchen door was open a few feet, but the storm door was closed. These doors lead to a patio that has a privacy fence around it. The latch on the gate of the privacy fence is broken so my finance’s elderly relative has been securing it with a bungee cord. I thought maybe the elderly relative had gotten up and opened the door for some reason. 

I approached the door and saw that the locking door knob on the inside looked loose, with some of the screws pushed a little forward, angling down. I could see a bit of the raw unpainted door around the door knob rosette. The exterior door knob was also loose. The strike plate was very loose. There is also a dead bolt. The thumb turn was noticeably more loose and wobbly, but I could still turn the lock. I then checked the locking storm door. The handle was a little out of position and the lock did not work. Glancing through the storm door, I noticed the bungee cord on the gate was hanging down, not wrapped around it.

Well, we called the police. One officer came. The elderly relative was not really helpful, claiming to not remember whether or not they got up early and opened the door, or if they wrapped the bungee cord around the gate like always. None of us had heard anything unusual. 

The policeman told us he didn’t think we had anything to worry about. He said it’s a quiet neighborhood and they never have any trouble. I asked why these things happening to both doors and the gate all at once was not an indicator of a break-in. The officer said ‘there’s nothing anyone can do from the outside of the door to cause the inside handle and inside thumb turn to loosen like that. He then asked if we had a Phillips screwdriver and proceeded to tighten the screws on the door knob and fixed the storm door lock. He told the elderly relative to call a carpenter and get the gate latch fixed. 

We feel pretty uncomfortable about all of this, but after speaking to the officer, we’re not sure what to think.

1kgfxxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1kgfxxn/should_i_confront_my_toxic_friend_or_just_let/,should i confront my toxic friend or just let things fade away?,"hey everyone i’m an 18 year old latina nursing student and i’ve been dealing with this super heavy situation lately that’s got my head all over the place. i’m really stuck on what to do about a toxic friendship i’ve been in for a while now and i’d love to hear how any of you have handled stuff like this. i’m torn between wanting to spill everything i’ve been feeling to this person and just keeping my mouth shut so i don’t make things messier than they already are. thanks for taking the time to read this, i just need some outside perspective cause i’m so lost right now.

so here’s the deal, i’ve been friends with this person since like middle school and we’ve had some amazing memories over the years, like late-night chats and dumb inside jokes that still make me laugh sometimes when i think about them. but over the past year or so things have shifted in a bad way. i started noticing how they’re always putting me down in little sneaky ways, like making snarky comments about my looks or my grades, or acting like my problems don’t matter whenever i open up. it’s not just one-off stuff either, it’s like a pattern where i always leave our hangouts feeling drained or kinda worthless instead of hyped up like a real friend should make you feel. they’ve also got this habit of flaking on plans last minute but then getting super mad if i can’t drop everything for them, and it’s exhausting trying to keep up with their double standards. i’ve been realizing how much this friendship is taking a toll on my mental space, especially since i’m already juggling school stress and personal stuff like a rough breakup from a while back that left me feeling pretty low.

for the last couple of months i’ve been taking steps to pull back a bit, like not texting as much, making excuses when they wanna hang out, and just keeping our convos short and surface-level so i don’t get sucked into that negative energy. i figured i’d just let the friendship kinda fizzle out on its own without any big drama cause i’m not really the confrontational type. i’m super shy in person even if i can be playful online, so the idea of a big intense talk makes my stomach twist. but now they’re hitting me up again asking to catch up soon, saying they miss me and wanna grab coffee or something to see how i’ve been. it’s got me second-guessing everything cause part of me feels guilty for ghosting them sorta, like maybe i owe them an explanation for why i’ve been distant. i wonder if i should just lay it all out, tell them how their behavior has been making me feel crummy for so long, and say i need space for my own sake. but then i worry that’ll just blow up into a huge fight or they’ll twist it around to make me feel like the bad guy, which has happened before when i’ve tried to bring up smaller issues with them.

i’m also kinda scared that if i don’t say anything and just keep dodging their invites, they’ll confront me anyway and it’ll be even more awkward. but letting it fade out feels safer in a way cause i don’t wanna stir the pot or deal with the emotional fallout of a big convo. i just want peace honestly, but i keep overthinking if i’m being unfair by not giving them a chance to hear me out or fix things. at the same time i don’t even know if they’d wanna change or if it’s worth the energy to try explaining myself when i’m already checked out of this friendship deep down. it’s such a weird spot to be in cause i still care about the good times we had, but i know staying close to them is just gonna keep dragging me down if i don’t set some kinda boundary soon.

i’m curious to know how any of you have dealt with ending a toxic friendship before. did you sit down and have a straight-up talk with them about why you needed to step away, even if it risked drama? or did you just let things drift apart naturally without saying much, even if it meant dodging their attempts to reconnect? i’d love to hear what worked for you or if there’s a way to balance being honest without turning it into a total mess. i’m in texas if timezone matters for replies or anything, but really i just wanna hear your stories or thoughts on how to handle this without feeling like i’m losing my mind over it. thanks so much for listening to me ramble, i’ve been bottling this up for weeks and needed to get it out somewhere safe like this sub.

So here it is, the ""dream"" I've had since about 5th grade in various forms (about 20 years now!): a members-only book and coffee shop. The main draw would be the ambiance. Im thinking magical Victorian-era English cottage meets modernity. Candle sticks, cozy reading nooks, plants, tea and coffee served in tasteful mugs and teacups. Ideally we would be located in an area with decent walkability, sort of in a European manner.  Perhaps we could even have formal high afternoon tea on the regular? 
The books are free on an honors system of ""take one, leave one"". Have as much tea or coffee as you'd like. Hang out during operating hours. There will not be any wifi, because this place is meant to be a slow down and escape the world respite. You don't have to wash up your own dishes but please do tidy up after yourself.

So I went to the urgent care where they directed me to go to the hospital because I was either having a stroke or I had an auto immune disease. After getting to the hospital, they did an MRI. To my surprise, I was having a stroke. My local hospital sent me to UC Davis Medical Center. Where they did a test called cerebral angiogram. That’s when I was diagnosed with Moya Moya. I had never heard of it before so I had to look it up on Google. To say I was devastated is an understatement! I was told I needed brain surgery to help my brain get blood. My surgeon told me that the left side was stage 5 and the right side was stage 1. Even though I was having the stroke on the right side… they also saw two old strokes on the scans.

My name is Sezen. I am a girl who grew up in a small town by the sea. And I've seen it all. Poverty, hunger, mental illness, abuse, loss. I was 10 when i realized i had to leave my abusive mom's home. I was 16 when i started to work. I was 20 when i started uni and actually did manage to leave. I'm 24 now. I finally have a place to call home. A non-stable but ""puts the food on the table"" kinda job. 2 beautiful cats that I've rescued and a degree on the way. And if you're going to judge me for anything further down the story, i want you to know that i consider myself a survivor and not a victim. Not in the past, not now. 


My boyfriend is 36 and we've met 2 years ago. When i was 22 and he was 34. My dating life was wild back then. 3 ongoing situationships, a girl who eventually chose her fbuddy over me, a boy who eventually had to move overseas, another one who was too in love with me to even respond to my texts, lol. I saw these people in different times while recovering from being cheated on. But it was honestly taking a toll on my mental health so i stopped answering their calls and decided to focus on myself and do something I'd been putting off and i started to take guitar lessons. One of my students back then was luckily teaching guitar, -i teach English- , and i started taking lessons from him. Now he was the teacher. This went on for six months. On the fifth month of my guitar lessons, around June 2023 I've decided to give dating another chance and went out with a rich engineer guy for two weeks. I broke up with him on the grounds we had nothing in common and he'd not even buy me a drink at all while eating the food i made and sleep in my apartment for free. Next night i invited the guitar teacher / english student out to a concert and kissed him there. He took me to the lakeside to return the favor. Then i suggested we'd go watching the meteor shower. Before i knew it i was in love and so was he and so far, it is and has been better than any other crumbs of love I had experienced before him. It is unethical to date your ""students"" and obviously there is the huge age gap but neither of us done those before and my highschool sweetheart was only three years older than me and he stepped on the windowsill threatening to off himself when i wanted out and in a perfect world maybe i would say no to dating a student, a 34 year old at that, altough i loved him ""because it's wrong"" but the world isn't perfect and neither am i and there's that so maybe back off. 


Anyways. My living situation had always been shaky until January this year as my former roommate was only looking for another roommate ""because he was broke"" but he actually ""hated sharing his living space"" so altough i thought we had become real solid friends in the two years we shared in that apartment, he kicked me out the first thing his daddy increased his monthly allowance and spread false rumors behind my back like ""Sezen had been planning to leave without telling me, so i had to act quickly."" Makes me sick to my stomach, that sneaky lil- whatever it's in the past now but i am still bitter. That's how you know you should have listened to your therapist when she tells you ""Sezen you need to set firmer boundaries or people/ esp. your roommate will take advantage of your soft nature."" I suck at that, did I tell you? It's my mom's gift. She raised me to cry when someone frowns at me. Always the perfect doormat, at 'yer service! Well.


So the problem is, in those two years the economy went to (even more) shit in my country. Look up ""What happened to Turkish economy"" if you're reading this from somewhere like Norway and lack some political drama in your day. When i moved in with my former roommate, i was fully capable of affording rent on my own. By the time i moved out, it was impossible. So i had two options: 

> Find another roommate, start it all over

> Move in with bf.


I went with the latter. 


And it has been dreamy.

So that's a ton of appointments), i haven't cleaned the cat litter once since we've moved in together. He says he enjoys it, making up for the years he spent without being their dad. My cats' dad. We play music together. He taught me to play the drums and he plays his electro. We hit the gym. Save up and buy fancy things for our apartment like an air purifier. My family adores him. His family adores me. It's all perfect. Except one thing.


I am falling out of love.


My home didn't use to be perfect. I lived in mold ridden apartments that i had to pour my heart out to make them look somewhat less ugly. I never had a stable and healthy relationship, usually seen with guys who didn't respect me or girls who knew i was way too inexperienced to sleep with. Never had a body this healthy. Never been this peaceful. And secure. And still, ironically, i don't feel okay. This doesn't feel like me. Maybe the transition was too fast. I don't know. All i know is it was too early in our relationship to have moved in together. Now it feels more like a rushed ""happy ending"" than a slow burn romance. And not when I'm sober but when I've drunk, which is very rarely, i want to go out and flirt with a stranger. I want to be random and spontaneous again. And at first it was only a ""drunk thought"" but now it's slowly bleeding into my sober life. I remember how miserable i used to be yet in retrospect it feels like how i was supposed to be living.


So the problem is me.

I'm sure it has it's frustrations (namely parking/driving - I cannot EXPRESS the fathom of ability you people have), but I was sad to go and can't wait to go back...

My sister is moving up to WA, and kinda did a PCH tour. We have a mutual friend in SF, so I took an impromptu plane there Saturday morning, left Sunday afternoon. Our friend picked me up and gave us an amazing curated tour, here were the highlights in the rough order of how we did them:

Lands end - just amazing, all of it. Sensory overload for someone from AZ.

Point Lobos Ave beach.... this was very special. It's the only living memory I have of the ocean. It was terrifying and beautiful. Got my feet wet, felt the sand collapse under me, fought the wind, smelled the salt, all of it...

Ate Dim Sum overlooking Alcatraz. I can't remember exactly where, but it felt like it was kinda close to Land's End and we were next to old navy base houses.

Castro Street - enough said. The menageries.... The ""everything"" store(s), the food, the art, the kind people. Too much to literally even remember, it was a flash of color.

Haight and Ashbury Area - having parent who were full on hippies frolicking around here in the 60s/70s, this was very special. We got hungry and ate Hot Slice Pizza and Ben n Jerry's. I just loved seeing all the art...

Downtown and Chinatown - our friend drove us through both. Didn't stop for long, but still very cool to see. The Capital Building is a work of art... Some very cool murals too. 

Fisherman's Warf - we didn't walk every pier, but saw a good chunk of it. I was amazed by the sheer shipping/receiving infrastructure for how dorky that is... Would have loved to try some great seafood but we were too full!

Treasure Island - basically took the bay bridge over to see the sunset and get a better look at the GG bridge. Short but breathtaking, ""when the lights - go down, in the city... and the sun shines on, the bay....""

""Make out Point"" - I don't remember what it's actually called, but our friend drove us up that small mountain that overlooks basically the whole city, the one next to that uncomfortably tall radio tower. (I'm deathly afraid of heights lol). I got one panorama then went back to the car lol.

The Mint Karaoke - myself, my sister, and our friend all LIVE for karaoke so this was a dream. I'm a bigger guy with a deep voice, so I practiced kind of a ""lounge/big band"" version of Pink Pony Club in the car for weeks. I got the bubble gun and everyone was dancing!!! My only regret is it was so busy we only got to sing one song, but I wouldn't change it for the world. Everyone just uplifted each other.... it made everyone comfortable and created such a feedback loop of positive energy.

Stanyan Park Hotel - this was kind of a gift between my friend and my wife for my sister and I. I've BARELY traveled in life... they wanted to make it special. It was amazing. For what it is - a historical experience in one of the best locations, is was perfect. Buyer beware, however, the room did not have AC, coffee maker, fridge, etc. It did have the shower soaps and stuff. I get that's not why you go there and I'll never not recommend it. Got to see a live street chase with the largest law enforcement response I've ever seen in my life on Stanyan St. before going to bed, so that was kinda fun lol. 

The next morning.....

Golden Gate Park - didn't do everything, but a huge chunk including riding the carousel. It's officially my most favorite urban destination of all time. The flowers... and we didn't even see the Botanical Garden or Japanese Tea garden! (I'm just now seeing on google maps lol dang it).

Rainbow Coop - coops are a nostalgic thing for my family and I. If anyone lived in/around Tempe and remembers the coop on Mill Ave in the 90s/early 00s you'd know why. My sister is kind of making a career out of working in coops, and so she was very excited. We got the Lesbian Feta - best feta in the world. That made a girl-lunch for us along with THE biggest strawberries, Irish cheddar, sesame pasta salad, and three kinds of bread.  

 After that, is was very near time to go. Our friend lives slightly outside of town so we bummed around the area of Stanyan for a little. Saw Amoeba records, a super fun little old school arcade (I forgot the name). Friend showed up and took me to the airport.

Final thoughts - if I could pick ONE word to describe SF, it's beautiful. The architecture, the environment, the culture, the people - beautiful. It's also a city of ""nooks and crannies,"" which I have an almost spiritual affinity for. Seeing those street level garages under those beautiful town homes was a trip. Some old surfer working on his Camaro in one, a lesbian couple doing better woodworking than I could in another, yet another is a speak easy wine bar - and here's an art gallery! Etc.

I think our house may have mold. Some symptoms I have ""exclusively"" at home are

* Fatigue
* Feeling constantly hungry / thirsty (even hours after I ate a full / ""balanced"" meal)
* Increased anxiety / nervousness across the board (increased by like 10x)
* Short of breath
* Waking up feeling like I didn't sleep 7-8 (when in reality I did)
* Acidic like smell / earthy smell in the room (during summer)

The only thing that seems to really help me are: drinking coffee to offset the fatigue, opening my windows to breathe better. I have a ""small"" dehumidifier but I don't know if it works, and a HEPA air filter that I doubt works. I try to go for walks a lot, or spend most of my time at work, or outside. The problem is we have  home owners insurance but my family refuses to use it, or is in denial we don't have ""mold"".

These problems suddenly dissipate when I'm spending time out or sleeping at others friends / family members' houses.

I don't see any visible mold around our house but I'm wondering if it's underneath the floors or in the walls?

I'm still in my mid 20s as a college student still living with family, and have a year left until graduation.

1kgfoce,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_faybrownxx/comments/1kgfoce/family_sus_death/,Family sus death,"So my uncle ended his own life a couple of months ago, never had any known mental health, never a mention of anything like that. He was the most funniest, laid back type of guy, never took anything too seriously (I get this CAN be common for suicide for it to not be known it’s coming).

For context, he was a caretaker at a primary school. For a while before they were making his life a misery as I think they wanted the house him and my auntie and cousin lived in, or the council wanted it, so it seemed like the school were on a mission to get him out so they could have the building. He worked there for 19 years and always had a really good relationship with the head teacher and everyone else.

Long story short with the school side of it, the head teacher and business manager were who we believe were the suspects of all of this. The headteacher was giving him unfair disciplinaries which came from nowhere (gave him a last warning when he hadn’t even had a first?), said things to him like ‘oh you didn’t do this and that’ and he said it wasn’t his job to, like book meetings, he said he doesn’t mind attending things but that wasn’t on him. At one point he was kind of unwell and had a problem with his stomach and sometimes would have to nip home to use the loo, they knew this and would say to him ‘you left site blablabla’ and he had to explain every time it was literally to use the toilet. He wasn’t one to take the piss either, he loved what he did, he always went above and beyond. Went it was snowing he’d always be in earlier doing things on the grounds he wasn’t even required to do, earlier than he was supposed to be, and didn’t ever say or ask for anything. He did loads of jobs for the school that were not in his contract to do, but he’d never call a contractor to do, he’d do it himself (what he could manage). You get the gist.

The business manager was closely involved too. I think she was the one who actively made things worse for him verbally, but the headteacher knew what was going on and overlooked everything, as a headteacher does….

Just to add in that my auntie also used to work at the school, as a dinner lady supervisor and cleaner, and they started saying things and making her life abit of a nightmare too.

My uncle would message my mum all the time, light heartedly, but say the school were doing his head in and would fill my mum in what was happening so she knew. He’d had meetings with the union, and a guy who was dealing with him told him incorrect information, and apparently ended up getting sacked, and someone higher said they’d be taking a look into it, and taking over everything, but didn’t get chance to. My mum told him in the end to go off sick due to it and it would give him chance to maybe have a break from everything, so he did. He went to the doctors and ended up being signed off with work related stress. Even after this, the headteacher rung him twice (not sure why, don’t think he answered) but he’d told my mum this, and she said they should NOT be ringing you, they know this.

He didn’t drive and with living on site, he obviously still saw the teachers parking outside his house etc. He had been off on work related stress for maybe about 5/6 weeks?? So not long really… before ending his own life in his home. He get on with his family, didn’t have many friends to have any issues with, was a stay at home with the dogs type of guy, didn’t have any financial problems, and his health wasn’t bad really. He had his stomach issues sorted and it was being managed so apart from that, it was only the odd thing like his shoulder or back going, which is fair enough with him being constantly on the move at work. He had a son who he adored, and everything at home was fine.

He wrote a note which he’d left in the bedroom with him basically saying that work had ‘worn him down’ and he was fed up with always having something wrong with his body, said it’s not family etc- I just find it bizarre. My auntie had said to him that they could literally just find somewhere else to live, and get different jobs. And that’s what they could’ve done as a family just to get out of there and start again. There was so many options…

What’s weird is that my auntie and cousin (aged 24) don’t seemed beside themself. Obviously they seem upset but have just been carrying on as normal. My cousin went back to work after a week, my auntie was going out shopping and getting her nails done still. I get everyone deals with it in their own way, and some people want that normality, but I just find it abit soon, personally.

My auntie has since basically said ‘it wasn’t really the headteachers fault or school fault’ and the family are thinking EH???? How was it not? And has been saying ‘they’ve been really supportive’, I mean they’re going to be aren’t they because they’re probably shitting themselves… she was also fine for the headteacher to go to the funeral if she wanted to. My mum wasn’t fine with this and ended up writing a letter to the school telling them they’re not welcome which I completely agree with. My auntie ended up kicking off saying my mum had no right to do this and if she wanted to go she could. She hasn’t seen any wrong in the school at all, yet knew everything that was going on as she lived and worked with him, and was involved too?

My mum also asked her if she’d be taking it further and she basically said she doesn’t see why she would and I just think, do you not want any justice for him? You just want to get used to him not being here and that’s it? You want to carry on like it’s fine? HE TOOK HIS OWN LIFE!? She is also annoyed at my mum that my mum has asked her this and basically stated ‘if me and my son decide to then we will’ so has basically pushed my mum out of the picture and she was his sister, that clearly means nothing to her. She has been pushed out with everything since he passed, and also knows nothing. Every time my mum would ask her something to try get some answers (as obviously my auntie knows the most) and was the one who found him, she doesn’t answer anything at all. They agreed to go for a coffee (was actually my auntie who asked my mum) so she thought oh maybe she’s realised and might open up and talk about stuff with her, and they met and my uncle didn’t even get brought up… how can it not!?

1kgfo0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kgfo0p/its_in_the_water/,It's in the water.,"I don’t know how much time I have before the reception goes out again, so I’m typing as fast as I can. If you’re reading this and you work for the EPA or FEMA, or hell, even the CDC, you need to send someone else out here.

For context, my name’s Daniel. I’m a compliance tech for an environmental lab out of Boston, Massachusetts. Most of the time, it’s boring. Just paperwork, field kits, writing the occasional stern email about arsenic levels in somebody’s backyard well. Until this week, the weirdest thing I’d dealt with on the job was a raccoon nesting in a chlorination pump.

Then I got sent to Bellwater, Louisiana.

All I know is someone submitted a water sample to the state lab. There’s no paperwork, no contact info, just a test vial in a padded envelope labelled ""Bellwater, LA"". When the lab results came back, the report looked like a prank. Thallium. Cadmium. Lead. Goddamn perchlorates.

I still don’t really know why a compliance tech from Boston got sent to handle it. The official explanation was that the state kicked it to their regional office, who passed it to the environmental services contractor they use for out-of-bounds cases. That contractor flagged my lab, and my lab flagged me. I guess I was the only one with an open travel window and the certifications to handle toxic material on-site. Congratulations, Daniel. Enjoy the swamp.

The trip down here was uneventful. Flew into Baton Rouge, rented a truck, loaded up my field kit, and drove the five hours south. The road into Bellwater stopped being a road somewhere around hour three where it became a strip of asphalt barely wide enough for my tires, half-swallowed by swamp on both sides. I passed exactly one other vehicle the whole drive, and it was an overturned boat trailer that looked like it had been there awhile.

When I finally hit the town limits, I almost missed the sign. It was nailed to a rotted fencepost leaning at a 45 degree angle reading *""WELCOME TO BELLWATER – POP ???""*

I don’t even know how to describe Bellwater.

There aren’t streets so much as ruts in the ground, some half-paved, others just gravel and tire tracks between rotting buildings. One house is missing a wall entirely. Just open to the elements, with an armchair still facing a TV that has no screen. And the air here is thicker than I was ready for. Not just hot but *wet*. I could feel the sweat on the back of my knees before I even parked.

I checked into the *Driftwood Inn*. I use the word “inn” generously. It’s a cinderblock box with eight rooms, all numbered out of order, and a faded coke machine out front. The woman behind the counter didn’t ask for ID. Didn’t ask for anything. She just looked at me, smiled, and slid over a key.

“Enjoy your stay.”

The first thing I noticed when I got to my room was the damp. Even with the AC on full blast, the walls are wet, and the whole room smells like mildew. When I first opened the bathroom door to take a piss I found a roach floating belly-up in the toilet. A good omen, I guess.

After that, I didn’t bother unpacking. Just took the field kit and set out to get some initial samples from the water treatment plant before sunset.

Except there wasn’t one.

Google Maps had it located about a quarter mile past the church, near what apparently used to be a shipping yard, but when I followed the path down there, all I found was a chainlink fence wrapped in vines and a rusty sign that said *“NO TRESPASSING"".* Behind it was a concrete structure half submerged in the swamp.

It clearly hadn’t been operational in decades, so I gave up and walked back into town, hoping someone could point me toward whatever they were using now for water treatment. That’s when I found the diner.

When I pushed open the door, everyone inside looked up at once. Full stop. Forks mid-air, chewing paused, eyes locked on me like I’d just burst in holding a gun and wearing a ski mask. Even the ceiling fan seemed to slow down.

Then, just as fast, it all resumed. Chewing, murmuring. One man tipped his hat. Another muttered, “Evening.”

A waitress approached with a notepad.

“Don’t get many visitors this time of year,” she said. “Or… any time of year.”

She smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes.

I ordered coffee, mostly out of awkwardness, and asked if there was someone I could talk to about the town’s water system. She raised an eyebrow.

“We keep it local.”

“Right… but is there a plant, or some kind of filtration…?”

“Clyde takes care of it.”

“Clyde?”

She nodded toward a man at the counter wearing a John Deere hat.

I asked if I could speak to him. She hesitated.

“He don’t talk much. But you can try.”

When I approached, he didn’t look up from his plate.

“Heard you do water treatment?” I said.

“Sometimes.”

“I’m here to do a compliance check. Just need to know where the town gets its drinking water now.”

He finally looked at me. His eyes were the color of silt. Not quite brown, not quite gray… and cloudy.

“We pump it from the well,” he said after a long pause. His voice was low and thick, like it hadn’t been used in a while. “Got a natural aquifer under the ridge. Real deep.”

“No filtration?”

“We boil it when it needs boiling.”

“Do you do regular testing?”

He scratched his chin. His fingernails were cracked and rimmed with something dark.

“Nah. No need. Water’s clean. Always has been.”

That was all he gave me. Then he turned back to his plate and started eating like I’d never spoken.

I returned to my table, where the coffee I’d ordered was already waiting for me.

I took a sip and nearly gagged.

It tasted like it had been left to stew in a thermos full of pennies. I set it down, fighting the instinct to recoil, and forced my expression back into something neutral. The last thing I wanted was to stand out more than I already did.

I pulled out my phone to double check the information I’d been given, but the reception was shit. Just one flickering bar, enough to tease me with loading screens that never finished.

Out of habit, or nerves, or maybe just needing something to do with my hands, I took another sip of coffee.

Same metallic tang.

Looking back, I feel like an idiot for swallowing any of it at all, but at the time, it was automatic. That weird social pressure to blend in. So swallowed it down without thinking, trying to look like I belonged.

It took ten full minutes for me to reload the satellite view of Bellwater, but finally I found a building labelled “*Bellwater Municipal Building*.” I figured if there was any documentation at all, it’d be there. Unfortunately, by then I’d finished the coffee. I left a five on the table and walked.

I found the municipal building at the end of a dirt road that sloped slightly downhill. It was a squat brick square and the paint was peeling in long, curled strips. The American flag out front had faded to pink.

As I approached, the door creaked open and a woman stepped out. Mid-forties maybe, in a button-up blouse. She stopped when she saw me, her smile flickering to life.

“Well, hey there,” she said cheerily. “You’re not from around here.”

I smiled thinly. “Just here on a compliance check. Water safety.”

“Oh, of course!” she said, as if we were old friends. “Well it’s been a while since we had a visit. Years, maybe!”

She hadn’t blinked yet. Not once.

“So… you work here?” I asked.

“Mmmhm,” she nodded. “I help keep things tidy. Records, forms, y'know. Bellwater’s not a big place, so we all wear a few hats.”

Her face caught the fading light as she turned slightly, and I stopped short. Her skin was gray. Not all over, but in patches, spreading up her neck like bruises under the skin.

She noticed me looking, and her smile got tighter. “Long day,” she said. “Humidity gets to you. Makes everything feel heavier, doesn’t it?”

“Yeah,” I nodded quickly. “It does.”

“I was just about to lock up, actually,” she continued. “Ready to enjoy my weekend.”

“Right, well I uh, I just need to look at any documentation you’ve got on water treatment,” I told her. “Records, complaints, maintenance logs. Anything.”

She hesitated just long enough to make me think she was weighing something behind her cloudy eyes.

“Oh, sure,” she said, her voice turning syrupy again. “Well, if you want to check the archives, the basement’s your best bet. Through the back. Just let yourself in. Door sticks a little.”

“You’re okay with me just…?”

“Oh, go right ahead! Ain't got nothin’ to hide. Water’s clean. Always has been.”

She smiled again before she turned and walked off toward the lot. I stood there a moment, watching her go. The back of her blouse was damp. Soaked, actually.

I waited until she was gone before I walked around to the back of the building. She hadn’t been lying about the door sticking. I had to shoulder it open, and when it finally gave, the musty air that hit me was like a punch in the face. Damp paper. Mold. Something chemical underneath it all.

I used my phone as a flashlight. The basement was a maze of warped shelves, rusted filing cabinets, and damp boxes. After some wandering, I found a cabinet labeled *PUBLIC WORKS*. It shrieked when I pulled it open. Most of the documents inside were the usual nonsense. Repair logs, notes about cracked pipes, bills for chlorine deliveries that stopped after 2003. All exactly the kind of boring municipal record keeping I’d seen a hundred times before.

But tucked in the very back of the drawer was a black binder with no label. Inside, most of the pages were blacked out. Not redacted with marker though, these had been photocopied that way. Whole paragraphs scrubbed into oblivion.

I thumbed through it slowly.

One of the pages was a scanned letter from Louisiana State Public Health, dated August 1998. What I could read said:

*“…following the incident at Bellwater Elementary, further testing is strongly recommended. Hair loss, skin lesions, and behavioral shifts in affected minors cannot be ruled as coincidental…”*

Behind it was a newspaper clipping from the *Bellwater Weekly*, same year.

*“Third Drowning in Two Weeks: Locals Mourn Another Loss”*

I turned the page to find a letter addressed to Mayor T.H. Ennis, written in looping cursive on yellowing lined paper.

*“I understand your desire to keep this quiet, but something is wrong with the water. The smell’s getting stronger and it burns my skin when I wash. My boy’s teeth are coming in wrong. He hasn’t been right since the school reopened. Please. I know what they told you. I know what they paid you. But if you don’t shut it off, more kids are gonna end up in the swamp.”*

I stood there with the binder in my hands, the taste of rust creeping back into my mouth.

This wasn’t just poor filtration. It wasn’t just neglect. There was something wrong here, something that had been wrong for decades. There was a reason the water treatment plant had been abandoned. A reason the records were blacked out. A reason someone had sent that test vial to the state lab without a name.

This was a goddamn coverup and I was standing in the middle of it.

That’s when I heard the footsteps. *Wet* footsteps. Slow. Heavy. Coming from above me.

I killed my light and backed into the corner between two collapsed shelves.

“…shouldn’t have let him in,” a low voice muttered. Clyde.

“Oh, hush,” said a woman. Bright and cheery. The clerk from earlier. “It’s not like there’s anything left to see. Everything’s been taken.”

“We don’t know what he’s been told,” Clyde snapped.

There was a long silence. Then the unmistakable sound of metal scraping against metal. I held my breath as the basement door creaked open, every hair on my body standing up at once.

Their footsteps hit the floor, slow and deliberate, squelching with each step. A flashlight beam cut through the dark, sweeping across the floor. I pressed myself deeper into the shadows,

They started talking again, but now their voices were low. I couldn’t make out a word of it. Then I heard Clyde.

“…he finished the whole damn mug.”

The woman laughed softly.

My stomach turned. I felt the coffee crawl back up my throat like it was trying to escape. The taste was still there in my gums, under my tongue, slick against the back of my throat. That acidic, metallic tang.

I nearly vomited right then and there.

Their footsteps circled closer. I could hear Clyde muttering again.

“He’s not here.""

“Then we’d best get back,” the woman said. “It’s almost dark.”

The footsteps retreated, back up the stairs. The door creaked. Then closed.

I didn’t move for a solid two minutes. Even then, I waited until I couldn’t hear anything, not even the scuttling of whatever lived in the corners of that basement.

Only then did I crawl out and make a break for the door.

By the time I made it back to the inn, the taste of rust and copper in my mouth was unbearable, like I’d been chewing on an old pipe. I was desperate for something to wash it out, anything *not* from the tap.

I made a beeline for the Coke machine out front. Fed a crumpled bill into the machine. Nothing happened. I pressed the button again. Nothing.

I leaned closer, squinting through the cloudy glass to see if there was anything inside, and that’s when I nearly jumped out of my skin.

The front desk woman was standing right behind me. I hadn’t heard her come out. Didn’t even hear the door open.

She smiled. “Out of order. But there’s complimentary tea and coffee in your room. Instant. Real nice.”

I nodded slowly. Didn’t say a word. Just turned and walked back to my room.

Once inside, I locked the door. Then I pushed the dresser in front of it for good measure.

I tried to log into my work system using the VPN on my phone to see if I could access any documentation, internal memos, *anything.* But the portal wouldn’t load. The browser just spun and spun. When it timed out, I switched to chrome and tried googling Bellwater.

Nothing.

Well not *nothing*, but nothing *right*. A few towns by that name in other states. One in Florida, one in Georgia. No images. No wiki. No population data. Just the google maps pin.

I tried calling my supervisor back at the lab but got no answer. Tried the state line, the regional EPA desk, FEMA’s automated reporting line. Nothing. Everyone’s out of office and it’s Friday, which means I won’t hear back from *anyone* until Monday at the earliest.

I tried calling 911. It didn’t even ring.

My throat’s sore now. Dry and raw like the burn that comes right before a fever hits.

I wanted to share a success story of enabling Secure Boot on Linux Mint 22.1 while dual booting with Windows 24H2 and all the TPM 2.0 bells and whistles enabled.

Most times anyone asks about this, they are told ""turn off secure boot.""

I've worked in security for almost three decades, and I can tell you secure boot is not an evil scheme to lock out Linux users.

I dual boot on my primary gaming system with Secure Boot disabled, but after reading this article

[https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/03/how-riot-games-is-fighting-the-war-against-video-game-hackers/](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/03/how-riot-games-is-fighting-the-war-against-video-game-hackers/)

I realized that's not going to be possible at some point in the future. I don't play games with kernel anti-cheat but I could see overall security becoming tied to Secure Boot.

So, on an old 2018 Dell gaming laptop, I installed Win 24H2 with TPM and SB and everything enabled on one drive, and Linux Mint 22.1 on the second drive.

This was the choice that made the difference. During installation, this appeared:

At this screen I created a password and remembered it.

I finished the installation and rebooted. I then got this scary screen as documented here:

Avoiding the replies to just disable SB, I followed the advice by SMG (thank you!) and selected Enroll MOK. I entered the password I used previously, and was able to boot into Linux Mint!

I even had the option to upgrade my Nvidia drivers to 570.133, which I did not realize is currently available in vanilla LM.

As you can see, everything is working.

TLDR; don't be afraid of SB. It appears to work if you create a key during the installation and enroll it when booting. I might get brave and enable SB on my main PC and see what happens.

When I was younger I couldnt stomach any Milk, may it be icecream or youghurt, during the years it weakened and nowadays I can drink it normally when I pay attention to not overdoing it.
Now my question... These last years I noticed that during my period my allergic reaction to Milk is a lot more severe, so that even one coffee is enough to give me a reaction and so fast too. Has anyone else experienced this before? 
My mom, whom I got the allergy from, has also this crazy reaction to Milk, she's got no period anymore tho so it's normal for her.  I thought I grew out of it (can you outgrow an allergy?) But my reactions during my period clearly shows not.. 
Even more during my period I am more sensitive to Milk, its enough is there's Milk in sauce, it'll give me a reaction and fast. 
Now it's nothing death threatening but im still curious if anyone else experiences this or if im alone or maybe even imagining it? ( which clearly not I see the difference) ",1,1746565229.0,Allergies,0,1.0,False

Once it ended, I happened to walk out of the lecture room around the same time as this other girl. She was a few steps ahead of me. 

By coincidence, we both end up walking out the same 1st floor MC door, and then toward DC past the chem building. I was omw to tims to get coffee and then to farahs. I noticed I was behind the same person for a few mins but obviously didn't think anything of it, it wasn't anything uncommon... yet. Pretty sure she looked back toward me at least once at this point though, so she would have been aware of me as well.

We both walked into DC, and then ig we both had decided to get something from Tims, ofc. I entered the line behind her, and I see her look over her shoulder again, and my anxiety spikes a bit. You know that feeling when you think someone in front of you might think ur following them, and you dont wanna look like a creep? I doubted she thought that but I decided to make sure we split ways after tims by just lingering for an extra few seconds.

She actually just ended up getting some cookie or donut, so I didn't even need to do all that. She's gone by the time I finish ordering, and by the time I picked up my coffee I forgot abt her.

And then I start walking toward the exit (the one facing the M4 construction) and she just APPEARS from the left from behind the circular room, coming from the washrooms. She def saw me, I was easily visible to her right, and to nobodys surprise she turns left and walks toward the same fucking exit I'm walking towards. I just keep walking cause its not like i was actually following her, but I'm praying we split paths soon.

This continues all the way to the station. I was concerned at this point cause like I prolly looked hella sus after DC, so I slowed my pace down so she could get ahead. Regardless, to my utter fucking dismay, she walks toward plaza, same as me, (turning right at the ion rails and walking in front of e7), and I just end up following her but from further behind. I didn't want to just deviate my entire route cause like I thought that would be a bit too excessive since she might not have even noticed (she definitely did).

I got to plaza like 20 seconds after she did so thankfully we lost sight of eachother after she walked around the corner at the pho place, and I walked the rest of the way to the farahs without seeing her. 

I pick up some chocolate, walk out of farahs, turn left toward rez one (where i live). I walk for like 5 seconds and then (you wouldn't guess it), she walks out of harveys RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME (I'm like 2 stores away) with a milkshake in her hands.

She sees me and we make brief eye contact, and im pretty sure she jumped a bit, like what ppl do when they see a spider LMAO. Then she just stood near the entrance and looked at her phone as I walked past her. I'm pretty sure she waited for me to walk away, so I happily obliged and walked past as if I had never noticed anything was awry.

We are a couple 10 years into our relationship, we are currently living together and have been since four years now. 

My gf has always liked roleplaying (not in a sexual way, more like in a Jane Austen fictional way) with different people through groups that she used to have on Twitter for example, but now that she discovered that Chatgpt is the perfect roleplaying companion she has becone addicted to it. 

To be honest, she is in a rough patch right now with work and life, so at the beginning I let this slide (that was three months ago) and I told her I'd support her until she gets better. The thing is that she's always on the phone, all day even while working sometimes, totally unaware of the world or the needs of the apartment and/or myself, and even herself...

I have already talked to her about this more than once but she gets either defensive or says sorry in a ""I dont care really"" way, one time she acknowledged all of this and said that she knew she was at fault, but she hasn't done anything about it. She changed so much so fast since we first started living together 4yrs ago and it is taking a toll on me to carry work, study and all the house duties.

I don't know what to do, I try to get her to do things, to go outside at least for a coffee but it's impossible, and even if I manage to convince her you can see in her eyes that she only want to keep chatting. I've seen her being two whole days just glued to the screen, even when eating (when I knew her she would get mad if I did this) 

I'm trying to see if I can wait for a year and see if she gets better... but my anxiety has ramped up a lot recently, I started a Master that she knew about since more than a year ago and I was hoping she would support me but I feel really lonely and can't tell how long I'll last like this.

We also moved to her country and I told her that if we moved she would be all I had at least for the first years, I'm starting to resent her and I feel like she's being egotistical. 

She is seeing a psychologist but I can't tell if She's being honest with them, I don't think she's mentioning all of this. What can I do? Being alone in this country, I have nowhere to go, and not enough savings yet to do something drastic, which I don't want to do either.

TL,DR: My gf changed a lot because she's probably depressed, but she's channeling it through an unhealthy addiction to AI roleplaying. How can I get her to snap out of it?

She looked up, saw him, and smiled—but waited. She knew better than to run to him. She’d done her part.

He stepped closer. No hesitation.

“I’m not the same as I was,” he said. “But I ain’t fixed either.”

Kira leaned against the glass. “Good. I don’t need fixed. I need real.”

“I wrote something,” he said, pulling his phone from his pocket. “You wanna hear it?”

She nodded once.

And he played it.

His voice came through—raw, honest, vulnerable over soft piano and drums:

“She don’t want a throne, just a corner of peace / And I ain’t a king, but she made the war in me cease...”

Kira didn’t say anything right away.

But when the track ended, she walked up to him, stood close, and whispered—

“Now that’s a kiss I’m ready for.”


Final Chapter: Real Recognize Real

A week passed.

They didn’t rush into titles. No “boyfriend.” No “girlfriend.” No claiming. Just moments.

Kira still flirted with the girl who delivered pastries to the café on Thursdays. Asiam noticed. She didn’t hide it. But she never made him feel like second place—just a different lane. A lane she still chose to ride in some days.

And for once, that didn’t shake him.

Because what they had wasn’t about ownership—it was about energy.


---

One afternoon, they sat on the hood of Kira’s car, sun dipping low behind the trees, sharing a mango smoothie and trading verses off a beat Asiam had made the night before.

“You know,” Kira said between sips, “you still surprise me.”

He raised a brow. “Yeah? How?”

“You haven’t tried to control me. Not once. Most men either wanna cage me or fix me. You just... let me be.”

“I don’t want a project,” he said, shrugging. “I want peace. And you? You bring chaos and calm.”

She laughed, tilting her head against his shoulder.

“Even if I got a girl one day?” she asked.

He paused, then nodded. “As long as I still get you in some way that’s real... I ain’t threatened by your truth.”

Kira looked up at him, eyes soft but sharp. “That’s grown.”

“Tryna be,” he said.

She leaned in—not to kiss, not to seduce—but to rest her forehead against his. A still moment. No fire, no smoke. Just breath. Just them.

By terrible020
It started with a curious conversation. It was just a conversation, at a coffee shop with some friends. We were laughing, trading stories about work, bad dates, the usual stuff. But then, mid-sentence, I realized I had nothing left to say. Nothing. My mind went blank, like a radio losing signal. Flatlined. I tried to grab onto a thought—any thought—but there was nothing. Just static. And nothing.
I smiled, nodded, and sipped my coffee to cover it up. My friends didn’t notice. They kept chatting, their voices blending into a dull hum. I stared at the table, at the grain of the wood, and felt myself… slip. Not physically, but like my mind was a kite cut loose, drifting away. I was still there, but I wasn’t. I was zoning out, further than I’d ever gone before. Panicking.
That was the first time.
It kept on happening. At work, I’d sit in meetings, watching lips move, hearing words but not processing anything. I’d try to speak, to contribute, but my thoughts were empty. I’d stare at my computer screen, the cursor blinking, mocking me, laughing at me. Emails went unanswered. My boss asked if I was okay, and I said, “Yeah, just tired.” But I wasn’t tired. I was gone.
At home, things got worse. I’d sit on the couch, TV on, but the screen was just colors and noise. I’d scroll my phone, but the posts, the memes, the news—they meant nothing. I’d open my mouth to call a friend, to say something, but no words came. It was like my voice had been stolen, not by force, but by absence. Like it had slipped into the same void where my thoughts went.
One night, I looked in the mirror, and I didn’t recognize myself. Not my face—it was still me, same eyes, same nose. But the spark was gone. My eyes were empty, like windows to a house no one lived in. I tried to say my name, to anchor myself, but my lips wouldn’t move. The silence was heavy, pressing against my chest, filling the room.
That’s when I heard it. A whisper, not from outside, but from inside my head. It wasn’t words, not exactly—just a low, constant murmur, like a crowd talking too far away to make out. It wasn’t threatening, but it wasn’t friendly either. It was… indifferent. Like it didn’t care if I listened or not. But it was there, always, filling the space where my thoughts used to be.
I stopped going out. Friends texted, called, left voicemails. “Where are you? You okay?” I wanted to answer, but my fingers wouldn’t type, my voice wouldn’t come. The texts piled up, unread. The world kept moving, but I was stuck, sinking deeper into the silence.
One night, I sat in my apartment, lights off, staring at the wall. The murmur in my head was louder now, not words but a presence, like something was sitting in the room with me. I felt it watching, not with eyes, but with attention. I tried to scream, to break the silence, but my throat was dry, my voice gone. The air felt thick, like it was pressing me down, swallowing me.
I don’t know when it happened, but at some point, I wasn’t in my apartment anymore. I was nowhere. Not a place, not a void—just… nothing. I could still see, still think, but it wasn’t me doing it. It was like I was a passenger in my own body, watching from far away. My hands moved, but I wasn’t moving them. My mouth spoke, but I wasn’t speaking. Someone—or something—was living my life, wearing my skin.
I saw it through my own eyes, like a movie I couldn’t turn off. It went to my job, smiled at my coworkers, answered emails. It met my friends, laughed at their jokes, told stories I didn’t remember living. They didn’t notice anything wrong. To them, it was me. But I was gone, trapped in the silence, watching from the void.
Sometimes, I try to fight, to claw my way back. I scream, but no one hears. I reach for my thoughts, but they slip through my fingers like smoke. The murmur is always there, louder now, drowning out what’s left of me. It’s not cruel, not kind—it just is. And every day, I feel myself fade a little more, like a signal growing weaker.
I don’t know what it wants. I don’t know if it’s a thing, a force, or just… what happens when you run out of things to say. But I know this: it’s not just me. I see it in others now, in the empty eyes of strangers on the street, in the hollow laughs at crowded bars. They’re zoning out, slipping away, and something else is stepping in.
If you’re reading this, listen. If you ever feel your words dry up, your thoughts go quiet, don’t let it take you. Fight. Say something, anything, even if it’s nonsense. Hold onto your voice, your spark, because once it’s gone, you’re not just silent. You’re erased.
And the silence is hungry.

I feel like I've pressed the restart button on life and can't believe I put it off so long. I was terrified of what others would think, so I spent the better part of my 20s dealing with debt like scooping water out of the ocean with a coffee mug. 

I know it's said so many times in this group, but I know there are lurkers like I was. If you're dancing on the line... JUST DO IT! My life did not fall apart; if anything, it freed me. 

My biggest holdback was fear that my partner would not want to be with me if I filed. Funny enough, their response was along the lines of, ""Did you think I was with you for your money??"". Now post-bankruptcy, I now know that I want to marry this person and can't wait to propose near the end of the year (with a plastic ring for now, lol). 

Looking to the future, I do want to get 1 credit card for now for emergencies/to rebuild my credit (any suggestions would be awesome), and I have been able to build a decent savings account for buying a house in two years.

1kgfeld,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1kgfeld/the_enterprise_where_i_work_almost_killed_me/,The Enterprise Where I Work Almost Killed Me,"I never gave a damn about the monsters in the region, just because I had never seen any of them, even though this is the city with the highest number of occurrences in the world. We're living in a time when these events are becoming common. We don't even know their origin. Their behavior gives nightmares to the greatest specialist in exotic creatures in the world. They don’t follow any pattern, so it’s almost impossible to locate their burrows. I’ve never seen a report from a survivor — almost as if there weren’t any.

That’s why I’m writing this report. This is my story with one of those terrifying creatures.

It was a Monday. Gray clouds were covering the sky, and it was cold. I didn't care. I changed my clothes and started making a cup of coffee to fully wake up. Everything was fine. I put on an overcoat, grabbed my umbrella, suitcase, and lucky fountain pen (it's a long story, which is not important now), and placed my hat on my head. Only then did I head to work.

When I arrived at BioCorps, I immediately noticed that something was off. The building was completely empty, and the air was filled with a horrible smell. Normally, it would be bustling with people at that hour. “Or am I late?” I checked my watch. It was really dark inside of the building, but I could see it was 7 a.m. Some lights were flickering. I looked at a wall. A dark liquid was smeared across it. “Is it…”, I thought, connecting the dots with the smell, “Is it… blood?"" I ran through Corridor 13 of Sector A, where my office is located, but before I could enter, I noticed something strange: my supervisor’s door was open.

It was unusual to see Dr. Smith’s door open. He was very reserved with his employees. Over the past month, he’d been showing up to work really messy — hair uncombed, suit wrinkled, and a haunted expression on his face. My natural curiosity overcame my fear. I had to know what was going on.

I stepped inside his office.

“It’s rare to see anyone passing by,” said my colleague and best friend, Walter, who was hiding under the desk and staring at Dr. Smith’s chalkboard. “Good to see you’re alive, Gregory.”Something was off about him. He was unnervingly calm — too calm. I think he was traumatized.

""Walter, are you okay? Are you hurt? I saw blood on the walls, and—"" I began, but Walter slowly raised his index finger to his lips, signaling for silence, and pointed behind me.

I felt a chill run through my body as something sniffed the back of my neck. Slowly, I turned around.

That’s when I saw a terrifying pair of eyes. Fuck, I can’t forget those eyes.

They belonged to a giant red-scaled lizard, with shreds of flesh hanging from its bloody jaws. It had threatening wings like a bat. As it sniffed, it exhaled smoke through its nostrils. I could hear it smelling. When it turned its head and saw us, it roared — unleashing a blast of pure fire.

Only then did I realize it was the source of both the smell and the silence. I wanted to scream, to cry, but I was frozen.

“He can hear us,” Walter gestured silently. I was so deceiving I barely noticed I had crouched under the desk beside him.

Then I looked at the chalkboard. Genetic sequences covered it. Tables tracked numbers of “failures” and “successes,” with questions like “wrong sequence?” and “wrong machines?”

But that wasn’t what caught my attention. Repeated over and over again were the words:

“I WOULD HAVE THE NOBEL.”

Horrified, I watched as the creature left the room. After I was certain it was far away, I said:

“We need to get out of here, Walter!”

“What? Are you nuts?” he nearly shouted. “That monster will kill us both if we leave this room! We’re safer here!”

“That’s exactly why we need to get out—”

The creature suddenly appeared.

For a few horrifying moments, the silence nearly killed me. Then, the creature left again.

“‘Secure,’ huh?” I muttered. “Look, if you want to stay, stay. I won’t stop you. But I’m leaving.”

“Good luck,” he said, looking at me.

I nodded back at him.

I ran through all of Sector A until I reached the reception door.

The door to my freedom.

Of course, I had to run to it—but the scaled freak appeared again, stopping me in my tracks. It didn’t move. It just stared at me. Unblinking. Minutes passed.

Then it approached.

Its tail stood erect, its medium-length arms extended toward me. Down the metal corridor, the creature’s low growls echoed. And I, like a complete idiot, just listened—frozen, unreactive.

Then, it started walking.

But the monster’s nose appeared just behind my neck. It opened its mouth, revealing rows of sharp, glistening teeth. At that moment, I had nothing to gain and everything to lose.

I slammed the button.

A blaring, ear-piercing alarm echoed through the corridor, distracting the creature. It worked — the monster turned away, trying to locate the source of the terrible, deafening melody. And that same noise announced something else: it was my chance to escape.

I ran down the corridor with everything I had.

But it saw me.

Those terrible, piercing red eyes locked onto mine and froze me in place. I realized then — this could be the end.

Think about it: would a six-foot-tall man stand a chance in a fight against an eight-foot-tall monster that literally breathes fire?

No? You’re absolutely right.

I was hurled against the wall and blacked out for a few seconds.

When I came to, I felt a deep cut in my abdomen and saw blood smeared on the wall beside me. My lucky fountain pen was lying on the floor. I needed a plan B.

I grabbed the pen, stood up, and ran straight at the monster — despite the excruciating pain in my side. Then, I stabbed his left red-orange eye with the pen. The monster yelled, and threw up a lot of fire. It was struggling from pain, and I lost my pen in the restless head of it.

The next thing I saw was terrifying. I saw the BioCorps's logo tattooed on the creature’s scaled neck.

Now everything makes sense.

It was Dr. Smith to command the creation of the monsters. He was trying to perform the creation of a creature, and he has been creating all of the monsters. That’s why we never saw a burrow of them, just because there isn't. The creatures are created in the labs and they are killed briefly after being born. Dr. Smith failed most of the time, so he went crazy. That’s why he left his door closed, to cover his secrets, and…

BLAM!

I didn't notice its claw, big enough to keep me on the ground. It growled. I was stuck. The creature lifted me with its claw and launched me across the corridor. I blacked out for a minute, I think.

The only eye remaining in the creature’s head looked at me. I knew I was fucked up. I tried to get up with all my strength. No success. My abdomen was severely hurt.

""ARGH"", I yelled from pain, ""Help!""

The monster approached. 

""Help!""

""Hey, you freak!"", it was... Walter? ""I bet you taste like chicken!"", if you looked at him, you could see he was taken by the fear.

RAAAAR!, the monster turned to Walter, who was holding a curtain holster.

""Walter."", my voice was so weak, and I was bleeding. I was losing consciousness.

The last thing I remember was that they started to fight. Walter was hurled against the wall and the monster started eating his intestines. I heard the sound of sirens from out of the building. After that, darkness.

I woke up in an ambulance. I gasped.

""Help...""

""Hey, hey, calm down."", a paramedic put a inhaler in my face and I went out.

When I woke up again, I was in a hospital room. A medic was administering morphine for me.

""Where... Where is Walter?"", I asked.

""Walter?"", he didn't understand. 

""The other guy, who was fighting the creature.""

The medic's face became dark.

""Huh... The police killed that reptile... We could save you, but the other mas didn't have this luck. We tried to save him, but he was fatally harmed by the creature.""

I think I was pale at this moment.

""But, hey..."", he tried to smile, ""You're alive. This is good news, a survivor of these attacks. Maybe you could help to end this cycle. Do you know the origin of this monster?""

""It was BioCorps."", I said.

His face was dark again.

""What?""
""Biocorps created the monsters. It had the BioCorps's logo on its neck.""

The doctor smiled.

""Have some rest. This story is over.""

He didn't believe in me. Probably, he thought I was having some hallucination, or PTSD. I don’t know and don’t give a fuck.

This is the truth. The painful truth.

Walter was my best friend. Biocorps, the enterprise where we worked, killed him and gave me scars forever. My supervisor's obsession caused it. Speaking about the devil, he is missing. But, now, I know my mission. I'll find him.

I'll have my revenge.

1kgfddo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amiibomb/comments/1kgfddo/just_got_an_allmiibo/,Just Got An Allmiibo,"So far I think it's great with just one issue. I got my Allmiibo pre-loaded so I didn't have to update it. I tried a lot of different amiibos with Animal Crossing New Horizons and they all work perfectly. I even tried a few on my WiiU and they all worked except one. Mario Kart 8 didn't accept the Pikmin amiibo for some reason. I tried a few other games and they all worked fine. My only issue is the lack of documentation. It's hard to find out any information online about how to use it. I figured it out on my own, but I can see how some people might struggle with it. Not every amiibo was listed, but there's a search function that let me find the ones I was looking for. Other than that, I'm quite happy with it. I stayed up way too late last night inviting villagers to the Roost for coffee. I missed Gracie and Katie. It was nice seeing them again. All the villagers and npcs are there and if I were to try to purchase the whole set of amiibo cards, it would cost at least $3000. Probably more. It even has a fully powered up Wolf Link amiibo. Breath Of The Wild fans know how important that is.

So if you're thinking of getting one, I say go for it. Just make sure that it's pre-loaded. 

One other thing: it's small! It's only an inch and a half long and just over an inch wide. Not that it matters. I just wanted to point it out. ",4,1746564638.0,Amiibomb,0,1.0,False

1kgfdah,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kgfdah/uncover_if_the_gaggia_magenta_plus_is_the/,Uncover if the Gaggia Magenta Plus is the ultimate espresso machine review,"The Gaggia RI8700/46 Magenta Plus Super-Automatic Espresso Machine, touted for its sleek design and advanced features, piqued my curiosity as a coffee enthusiast. Being someone who treasures a quality homebrew espresso, I incorporated this machine into my daily routines for an extended period to see if it lives up to its claims. This review is a product of my experiences, with all its merits and nuances.

**The Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, the craftsmanship stood out. The black metallic exterior gives it a modern, high-end kitchen appliance vibe that seamlessly fits into my countertop setup. Its compact dimensions of 17.1""D x 8.8""W x 14""H ensure it doesn’t dominate kitchen space, which is helpful in tight areas. Despite its relatively small footprint, it has a removable 60-ounce water tank which often lasted me a few days of espresso indulgence before requiring a refill. The design also incorporates a tall spout that accommodates cups up to 6 inches high, so my favorite oversized mugs fit perfectly without any awkward spills.

**The Full-Color Display**  
One of the winning points of this espresso machine is its full-color display. This feature brings an interactive element to the brewing process that I haven’t encountered before. Navigation is straightforward, with text, icons, and colors making it easy to program your brews. I enjoyed tweaking espresso settings mid-brew to experiment with different flavors, which enhanced my overall experience of customizing drinks to my taste.

**Commercial Steam Wand for Milk Frothing**  
As someone who loves a creamy latte or cappuccino, the commercial steam wand provided endless opportunities to explore milk frothing. Unlike other similar machines, this steam wand gives fine control over the texture. I had fun experimenting, creating silky lattes for myself in the morning and frothy cappuccinos for friends on the weekends. For those who frequently entertain guests or simply adore milk-based coffee beverages, this steam wand feels like a game-changer.

**On-the-Fly Programming**  
The ability to program the machine as it brews felt innovative. Once I found the ideal balance of grind size, brewing temperature, and strength, saving these settings ensured I could replicate the perfect espresso every morning. With just one press, the machine reproduces customized drinks without the need to fiddle with settings daily—saving time (and my pre-coffee grumpiness!).

**Positives**  
This espresso machine offers a long list of favorable attributes that make it a hit:  
- Compact design with a sleek appearance and small countertop footprint.  
- Easy-to-use full-color interface with accessible text and icons.  
- Powerful steam wand capable of creating various milk textures for lattes or cappuccinos.  
- Programmable drink settings to personalize the morning coffee experience.

**Downsides**  
Not everything about this product is flawless, and it's important to acknowledge areas where it can improve:  
- The drip tray fills quickly, and I had to empty it more often than anticipated.  
- While compact, it occasionally needed clearing of air bubbles in the system, which added an unnecessary step to maintenance after extended idle periods.  
- Medium noise levels might be disruptive in quieter households during early mornings or late nights.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
Comparing this product to other rivals, the Gaggia Magenta Plus demonstrates clear strengths, particularly in its customization options. However, competitors like the Breville Barista Express trade some automation for enhanced manual control—ideal for purists who relish hands-on brewing. Meanwhile, Jura E8 offers a more extensive array of preprogrammed drink options but at a far heftier price tag. The price-quality ratio here puts Magenta Plus in an excellent middle ground, offering a balance of user-friendly operation at a moderate cost without skimping on premium features.  

**Quality for Price**  
The Gaggia Magenta Plus appealed to me primarily for its blend of affordability and premium performance. Although competitors offer additional features, few strike such a balance of customization and ease of use in this price range. For anyone seeking a reliable, semi-luxurious super-automatic espresso machine for daily use, this model feels worth the investment. Despite smaller critiques around maintenance quirks, its capabilities justify the cost for coffee enthusiasts.

This drink has worked really well for me, but everyone’s body is different. I’m 6’2” and around 187 pounds, so ingredients like magnesium are dosed in a way that suits my size and needs. If you’re smaller, larger, a different gender, or have different nutritional needs, you may want to adjust some ingredients. 

Also, the drink contains spicy ingredients like cayenne, ginger, and turmeric. If you’re sensitive to heat or have digestive issues, that might be too intense. It can also affect digestion — in my case, in a really good way — but start small if you’re unsure.

I lost about 50 pounds over the past couple of years, but I was stuck around 195 for months—no matter what I did, the scale wouldn’t budge. Since about two and a half weeks ago when I started drinking this daily, I’ve dropped down to 187. I can’t say for sure it was only the drink, but I strongly suspect it helped me break that plateau. It seems to help manage my appetite and reduce cravings throughout the day, especially in a calorie deficit. It just makes me feel more balanced.

I’ve been experimenting with a homemade health drink for a while now, and I feel like I finally nailed a version that just works for me. It’s helped with digestion, energy, hydration, and just feeling more balanced overall.

Before this, I used to only go to the bathroom maybe once every few days. Now I go once a day, consistently — smooth, soft, and clean. My gut feels healthier than ever, and I know that’s not a fun thing to talk about, but it makes a massive difference.

I also don’t feel dehydrated anymore, even when I’m drinking coffee (which I also have daily, black). Between the minerals, electrolytes, fiber, and anti-inflammatory ingredients, I think this drink has just hit the right balance for my body. I’m more regular, my energy is steadier, and I genuinely enjoy the taste, especially the spice kick.

Some ingredients are a bit pricey (Full price breakdown at the bottom) but many are affordable, and it only takes 20 minutes to prep. I just wanted to share this in case someone else might benefit from it like I have.

For context we are college students, and we go to different schools but are nearby. Last week I was dumped by my girlfriend. Everything was, to my knowledge up to this point, fine. I thought we created a safe and understanding space to talk about our feelings without a sense of judgement. We met twice a week, 1 midweek homework session, and 1 weekend date night out. We have our own friends, but we all get along, no matter which mix of people are with us.

What happened: I was performing at a show, and she came to see with a few of her friends. After I was done, I chatted with her friends for a little bit, then gave her a hug. She said she was going to grab some things from her room and then come over to my place after the show, then gave me a kiss and said see you in a bit. I got the “can we talk” text 30 minutes later.

Reasons for the breakup:
She said didn’t know what she wants or who she is, and I seem to know what I want, and I deserve someone who’s not wishy washy all the time. She also said the classic ‘I love you but I’m not sure I’m feeling what I should be feeling to be IN love with you”. That she doesn’t think that we’re meant to be together. She said she needs to be alone to figure herself out, and that she and I would never date again. She DID say, however, that ‘once we’ve both healed from this, we can meet for coffee or something’.

I was crushed. She has had mental health struggles in the past, and still does to this day, but is in therapy and seemed to have a healthy way of sorting things out. She and I both talked about the future and how we would be in each other’s lives for a long time. This was completely out of the blue. We never fought and had similar moral values and direction in life. She has had bad romantic and familial experiences in the past, and all of her family and friends were saying I was the first cool person she’s dated (their words, not mine). I loved them all. I loved her, her friends, her current parents and siblings. I still think she loved me, but now I’m starting to doubt it a little.

I think she got scared by how much she liked me, but also associated infatuation with being “in love”. Looking back through the texts, we were pretty consistently flirting with each other until she sent that last text (not constantly, but at least once a day there would be a wink and an ‘I love you’ exchanged). Even the day she broke up with me, there was clear reciprocation. She didn’t even gradually pull away, it was all at once. We’d even made breakfast plans for the day after she broke up with me.

I feel for her and I hope she grows and finds what she truly wants, but I also want her back. Not tomorrow, but in a few months when she’s healed whatever she needed to in order to be in a healthy relationship again. I told her I would not block her, but I will also not reach out, so if she wants to hear from me, she can reach out.

Does this sound like the behavior of someone with avoidant attachment issues on her part? Or does it sound like she just never actually liked me to begin with? What do I do moving forward?",1,1746564133.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

3. **How will I reward myself after?** (I’ll make a good coffee and take a 10 minute chill break)

Going to a work conference next week. Does anyone have tips on how to set boundaries on physical limitations and expectations to drink with people who don't understand POTS and reduce it to anxiety or being dramatic? 



So, I've had dysautonomia since childhood and was diagnosed with POTS in Feb after passing out at work a few months prior. I got really really lucky with finding a cardiologist that immediately pinpointed POTS. Bless him.  

Meds have helped beyond imagine (although slightly less so recently. Cardio appointment this week to address.) 

**What has me most concerned is some travel for work I have coming up next week (conference)**. We plan waaaay far ahead for it, and honestly it didn't cross my mind until this week and the reality of it sunk in. The sitting for hours, the standing, the walking, the absolute dysregulation being constantly on the go from sunrise to well past sunset without the ability to crash into my own bed in my home with all the water and salty snacks and food and blankets and pillows I could ask for. 

I don't know what's going to happen. I am a ""drastically worsened after covid"" POTS person and I haven't had to do much more than work an at-home desk job since last November. On the rare occasion I have to go into the office, I have to take an Uber and make sure I have the next day to recover. Sitting in a meeting longer than an hour and a half without the ability to put my feet up puts me in pre-syncope. So what the hell am I supposed to do at a 3 day conference where morning ""coffee"" is a meeting, then panels, then a lunch meeting, followed by more panels, and more side meetings, and finally dinner, which is also a meeting. **And then there's the immense expectation to drink**. If you say ""none for me, thanks"" the peer pressure is unbearable. I haven't drank since 2021, with the exception being this stupid conference in prior years. And every year it's ""oh come on you can have another one"". But this year? I have no idea. I haven't had anything to drink since before the POTS came on with a vengeance. 

Does anyone have any words of comfort, ideas on what to say when I have to set boundaries with people who have repeatedly reduced POTS to ""having anxiety"", not understanding that POTS doesn't go away, or making ""oh she's being so dramatic"" faces if I tell them my daily symptoms would send most people to the ER?

Does anyone have any tips on how to prepare for the worst in large crowds? ",6,1746564081.0,POTS,8,1.0,False

# Stylish Curved​ Sofas: Top 2025 Picks & Reviews

Curved sofas have emerged as a notable trend ⁣in interior‍ design,adding a touch of elegance,sophistication,and a unique focal​ point to any living space. These sofas offer a softer, more inviting choice to traditional straight-lined ​designs, fostering a sense of conversation and community.Perfect for both expansive living rooms and cozy apartments,curved sofas are versatile pieces that can transform the ambiance of your home. In this article, we will explore some​ of the best curved sofas expected to ⁢dominate the market in 2025, ⁢providing detailed reviews and insights to help you make an informed decision.

[[Explore Top rated curved sofa on Amazon.]](https://itsallgarden.com/home-thinking/?kw=curved sofa)

## ‌Key​ Features Analysis

The appeal of a curved ⁢sofa lies not only in its aesthetic design but also in the features that ⁣contribute to its comfort, durability and functionality. Evaluating these⁣ aspects will ensure you choose a sofa that​ meets your specific ‌needs⁤ and preferences.

**Ergonomic Design and Support:**

A well-designed curved sofa should prioritize ergonomic ‌comfort. The curve should cradle the body, providing optimal​ support for the back and shoulders. ⁢Look for models⁢ with a‍ high backrest and adequate lumbar support to promote proper posture and prevent discomfort during extended periods⁢ of ‍sitting.Seating depth should also be considered, ensuring‍ that‌ you can comfortably sit back without feeling strained.

**High-Quality Upholstery Materials:**

The upholstery material significantly ⁢impacts​ the sofa's‌ longevity and overall ⁣look. Premium options‌ include durable ⁣fabrics⁣ like velvet, linen, and ‍performance blends, which are resistant to stains ⁣and wear. Leather provides a luxurious‍ feel but requires more maintenance. For eco-conscious buyers, recycled or organic fabrics are increasingly available.Always ‌consider the‍ fabric’s texture, colorfastness, and cleaning requirements before making a decision.

**Sturdy Frame Construction:**

The frame is the backbone of⁣ any sofa,‍ and a robust ‌construction is crucial⁢ for ensuring its⁣ longevity. Kiln-dried hardwood frames ‍are considered the gold standard, offering superior strength and resistance to warping. Avoid sofas with frames⁢ made from particleboard or softwood, ⁢as thay are likely ⁣to sag and‍ fail over time. Check for reinforced joints and corner blocks ⁣for added stability.

**Comfortable Cushion Filling:**

The cushion filling determines the comfort level of the⁣ sofa. High-density foam provides a firm and supportive feel, while feather-down blends offer⁣ a softer, more luxurious experience. A combination of foam‌ and feather is frequently enough the best​ compromise, providing a balance of comfort and support. Look for cushions with removable covers for ​easy cleaning and maintenance.

**Modular Design Options:**

Modular curved sofas offer versatility in arranging your living space. These sofas consist of individual sections that can be configured in various ways to suit your needs. This is particularly useful for adapting to⁢ different room sizes or⁢ layouts. Ensure ​that the modular components are easy to connect and disconnect, and that the connectors are durable and secure.

## Core⁢ Benefits

Choosing a curved sofa provides⁤ numerous ⁢benefits that enhance your living space and ​lifestyle.

**Enhanced Social Interaction:**

Curved sofas naturally​ facilitate conversation and interaction ‍among people. The curve​ creates a more intimate setting, encouraging face-to-face interaction and a sense of togetherness.⁢ This is particularly beneficial⁢ for families or those who frequently entertain guests.‍ The design promotes⁢ inclusivity, making ‍everyone feel part of the conversation.

**Unique Aesthetic Appeal:**

A curved sofa adds a⁣ touch of sophistication⁣ and⁤ uniqueness to‌ any room. Its organic shape contrasts⁤ with the sharp lines of traditional furniture, creating a visually striking focal point. This can elevate the overall ‍design of your living‌ space, giving it a more curated and stylish look. The distinctive silhouette also ⁤makes it an instant conversation starter.

**Space Optimization:**

While it may ‌seem ⁢counterintuitive, a curved sofa can actually optimize space in certain situations. Its rounded form can soften the corners of ‌a room,​ making it feel less⁣ boxy.It can also be strategically⁤ placed to create a natural flow within the space, guiding traffic and defining different zones. this‌ is ⁣especially useful in open-concept living⁢ areas.

**Improved Comfort and Relaxation:**

The ergonomic design of a curved‌ sofa can‍ enhance comfort and relaxation. The gentle curve supports the body's natural contours, providing a more comfortable seating experience than a straight-lined sofa. This can be particularly beneficial for people with back problems or those who simply want to unwind after a long ‍day.

## FAQs Section

**Are ⁤curved sofas suitable​ for small spaces?**

Curved⁢ sofas can work ‌in smaller spaces, but careful planning is necessary. Opt for a‍ smaller-scale curved sofa or a modular design ⁣that can be⁢ configured to fit the available space. Avoid overly bulky models that might overwhelm ‌the room.‌ Consider the overall layout of the space and ensure that the sofa doesn't obstruct traffic flow.**How do I style a curved sofa?**

Styling a curved⁤ sofa involves choosing complementary furniture and accessories that enhance its ⁣unique ‍shape. Round or organically shaped coffee tables work well,​ as they‌ echo the sofa's curves. Add textured throw ⁤pillows and blankets for comfort and‍ visual interest. Consider incorporating a rug that ⁣unifies the ⁣seating area.⁣ Experiment​ with different arrangements to find the most harmonious balance.

**What is the average lifespan of a curved sofa?**

The lifespan of a curved ​sofa⁢ depends on various factors, including the⁣ quality of materials, construction, and usage. With⁤ proper care and maintenance, a high-quality curved sofa can last for 10-15 years or even longer. Regular cleaning,⁢ avoiding excessive wear and tear, and addressing ‍any minor issues promptly can significantly extend its lifespan.

**Can I reupholster a curved sofa?**

Reupholstering a curved sofa is possible, but it can be more complex and costly ⁢than reupholstering⁣ a traditional sofa. The ‌curved shape requires more ⁢precision and skill. Consult with a‌ qualified upholsterer to assess ​the feasibility and cost involved. Reupholstering can be a worthwhile option if you want to update the​ sofa's look or repair damaged‌ upholstery.

Alright, let’s talk about something that’s on all our minds as we inch closer to the golden years—**Medicare Part B costs in 2025!** Yes, the numbers can be a bit daunting, but stick with me. I promise we’ll break it down together like two friends over coffee (or a nice glass of lemonade)!

Imagine this: you’ve finally retired and are planning that well-deserved trip to Hawaii, but then it hits you—**Medicare costs!** 🏖️ How much are you going to need to budget for when it comes to premiums and deductibles? 

Here’s the scoop, nice and simple:

**1. Premiums**  
- **Base premium:** In 2025, the standard Medicare Part B premium is expected to be around **$174 or so** a month. Not too shabby, right?  
- **Income-related adjustments:** If you’re earning a bit more (like over $97K for individuals or $194K for couples), you might have to pay more—up to **$500/month**! Yes, your monthly premium can be tiered. Remember to factor that in, or you might just do a double-take when the bill shows up!

**2. Deductibles**  
- For 2025, the deductible is likely going to be **about $226**. That means you’ll pay out of pocket until you hit that amount before Medicare kicks in.  
- And let’s face it, that can feel like a bit of a punch, but hey, at least it’s not like trying to balance your checkbook after an unexpected car repair!

**3. Budgeting Tips**  
Here’s how to make sense of budgeting for this:  
- **Set aside a healthcare fund**: Put aside a little each month just for healthcare costs—maybe the average value of those lattes you don’t have to buy anymore? ☕  
- **Review your plan yearly**: Medicare can change its rules, prices, and plans yearly. It’s a bit like those surprise twists in a good Netflix series—keep your eyes peeled!  

But here’s the good news: With proper planning and some smart strategies, you can make Medicare work for you rather than the other way around. 🌟 

So, let’s pivot a bit! How do you feel about navigating the Medicare maze? Do you have any tips or stories about surprises you’ve encountered on this journey? Or maybe you’re feeling overwhelmed and want to share that too?

I started a pseudo-diary about my MD surgery and the first few months of recovery - everything went stupid easy and was uneventful, so I hope if you’re doom scrolling pre-surgery, this might help calm any fears. As of a few days ago, I’m five months out. Going into it, my only goal was to be out of the life-halting pain and be able to return to work/life, and instead (spoiler alert) I’m better than I have been in years, possibly ever? I had initially planned on a single post, but it got \*long\* so I split it up. 

Me: early 30s, female, desk job. I wouldn't describe myself as someone who exercises, but I am lightly active - think dog walks, light hikes, etc. A little overweight, but not concerningly so.

[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Microdiscectomy/comments/1kg6a3f/my_microdiscectomy_diary_part_2/)

**Things that made life easier:**

 \-grabber: used before and after surgery to prevent bending. I actually love this thing, it’s so convenient. 

\-maternity pillow: also used before and after surgery to help with sleep posture. I’ve always been a side sleeper, so I’m going to keep it around because it’s so comfortable. 

\-elevated dining/writing area: I stacked a few plastic totes on top of each other to use as a makeshift dining area, place to write, etc. so that I could do so without any bending or sitting. 

\-back brace: I tried one with firm lumbar support and one with just stiff boning and I far preferred the one with just the boning as it didn’t press directly on my incision area. This is my top recommendation, it was a lifesaver post-surgery and I wore it for quite a while. 

\-Gabapentin: originally prescribed by my GP, stupidly high dose. It was the only thing that stopped the nerve pain prior to surgery and I’m positive that it made a difference with pain-levels post-surgery. 

\-sneakers: I have great supportive loafers that I typically wear, but I ended up buying a pair of slip-on sneakers that I lived in during recovery. 

\-self-inflating lumbar pillow: while deflated it’s small enough to tuck in my purse and it’s a godsend. I use it everywhere, most notably restaurants and theaters. The best part, it inflates on its own so you don’t look like an idiot blowing it up in public! 

\-duck/bean-style boots: historically, I’m a very clumsy person, and the sturdy, grippy sole and ankle support made me feel far more secure with my nature-reintroduction. I’m currently on the hunt for a summer-equivalent of them, drop a suggestion if you have one! 

\-guest room: we’re privileged enough to have a guest room, and I immediately moved in there following the ER visits and stayed through week 8 of recovery. Having a bed to myself, without a husband or a pushy dog was a lifesaver when I couldn’t stand (and therefore couldn’t shower) for weeks and while I was tender post-surgery. 

\-therapy: obviously physical therapy, but also regular therapy helped for me. Like, you’ve made it to basically the end of this. My period of severe pain was only two months, I had a fantastic doctor, an easy surgery, and a great recovery, so objectively everything should have been a-okay. I don’t know what happened, but obviously my brain found a problem with it. I’ve never been at peak mental health but I previously managed, and when I realized how much I was struggling after a few months of recovery, it was the final push I needed to seek out a therapist.  

\-a support system: we had so many meals dropped off on our porch, friends offering rides, people picking up groceries. People love you, let them help.

**Things that didn’t help:** 

\-wearable lumbar ice pack: I’m not an ice pack person, but I tried it a few times and it was just meh. Obviously your experience may vary. 

\-hydrocodone: I’ve been prescribed hydrocodone previously and it had no effect. Which, surprise, also didn’t feel anything from it this time. I ended up not needing anything stronger than Ibuprofen, but if I had, I should have advocated for a different narcotic. 

\-lumbar pillow for the car: maybe I just didn’t find the right one. It provides great support, but my body doesn’t love it.

**Overall thoughts:** For me, the scariest part was the MRI. I know I’m mildly claustrophobic, but I decided to turn down any offer of meds and tough it out - and ended up spending the entire time barely fighting off a panic attack. Big mistake, take any meds they offer if you think you might need them. And the only time I got nervous to the point of nausea was for my two week post-op appointment - who knows why, but listening to both my coworker and my husband tell me I was being an idiot and would be fine helped calm me down. I think by the time it was decided that I needed surgery, I was so fucking *angry* about the pain and being stuck in bed that I was *ready* to just get it over with.

One thing that really helped me day to day: once I woke up, got ready for the day, and had a reasonable amount of coffee in me, I’d stand in a neutral position and do a quick body assessment. I’d make a mental note of anywhere that hurt or was uncomfortable, and mainly monitor the level of numbness in my left leg. I found it helped to start the day with a win (no pain!) or to keep sane (like reminding myself that just a specific spot on my lower right back hurts, not everything) and it allowed me to be more actively aware of myself and the body I inhabit. 

Post-surgery, the wrist of the IV hand *hurt*. It felt like a bad sprain. My wrist was painful to move, to the point that I was cradling it at times, and the vein felt like a cord. The pain decreased each day and fully disappeared just shy of the 2 week mark. Honestly, this may have been the most painful part of recovery.

If I have to do the MD again, I’d probably wait until the two-week mark to go back to work. Not for pain reasons, but I had just spent two months at home with a midday nap and I think I could have benefitted from a bit more of a reintroduction to the world before just jumping back in. And for my mental state - obviously I’m terrified of re-herniating, so maybe waiting until the two week post-op appointment to get the “everything looks great!” from the surgeon would have helped me feel more at ease. Everyone in my life treated this as a **Big Deal** \- it probably was. I compartmentalized it down into “this was easy, I was able to bounce back quickly” and really avoided addressing any of the **Big Deal** thoughts and feelings. It helped in the short-term, but I’m currently unpacking it in therapy.

ANYWAY. There’s a bunch of stories of MDs going poorly on here. Mine went fine. One expects BACK SURGERY to be painful, wildly invasive, and have a long recovery time, but that’s not at all what I experienced. Granted, I’m in my early 30s, not in terrible shape, started PT prior to surgery to learn the best ways to move post-surgery and resumed sessions at 6 weeks post-op. 

So yeah, this is my rambling, overly-detailed, over-sharing summary of my MD in case you need to read an account of everything going smoothly.

She looked up when he stepped out, but said nothing.

“I thought we was keeping this... chill,” he said.

She smirked. “You’re the one pretending this ain’t heat. I’m just here to stop lying to myself.”

Asiam stuffed his hands into his pockets. The cold didn’t bother him. Her honesty did.

“I’m not good at this,” he said finally. “I don’t know how to want something without messing it up.”

Kira’s expression softened. “Then don’t call it want. Call it peace. ‘Cause when I’m around you—when you’re not playing scared—it feels like peace.”

She stepped closer, not pressing, just enough for him to feel her presence fully.

“I don’t need promises,” she whispered. “Just truth.”

Asiam looked at her for a long time—long enough for her to wonder if he’d speak.

Then he just nodded.

And for the first time, instead of tension, the air between them softened.

They didn’t kiss.

Not yet.

But the space for it was made.


Chapter: The Edge of Something

The coffee shop was closed, but neither of them had left.

Kira sat on the counter, legs swinging slightly, sipping on a half-warm chai she didn’t even like. Asiam leaned against the sink, arms crossed, just watching her like she might disappear if he blinked too slow.

“You ever just… not know how to stop feeling something?” she asked, her voice quiet in the still shop.

“Every day,” he replied.

Kira met his gaze. “Then why do you try so hard to?”

He didn’t answer right away. Just shifted, like his body carried more weight than his words could explain.

“’Cause feeling something,” he finally said, “means I might have to do something about it. And doing something means losing something.”

Kira nodded slowly, setting the cup down. “Then maybe you’re already losing it, just slower.”

That hit. He looked at her—not just her mouth or the curves under the dim lights—but her. The woman who saw through the act. The one who wasn’t afraid of his chaos.

She jumped down from the counter, stepping close. “I’m not asking you to choose tonight.”

Her fingers brushed his. A touch that lingered.

“But if you ever do... don’t do it outta guilt. Do it ‘cause you want me, loud and clear.”

Then she leaned up—kissed his cheek.

Not his lips.

But the message landed like thunder.

Before he could reply, she pulled away, grabbed her keys, and walked out the back door.

This time, Asiam didn’t stay frozen.

He followed her to the door.

He watched her leave.

And for the first time—he wanted to chase.

1kgero4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kgero4,How to make Friends in Korea - Carrot market app,"Let me explain how foreigners use (Danggeun) carrot market as one of the ways to make friends in Korea. Carrot market is a region-based secondhand trading app, but it can also be useful for making new friends by connecting with local residents.


1. Local Community Utilization: Carrot Market has a tab called ""Neighborhood Life."" Here, you can talk to your neighbors about a variety of topics. Post a topic or question that you are interested in, and you can meet locals who can answer or empathize with it.


2. Organize a Meeting: Host a meeting that recruits people to share a certain hobby or activity. For example, you can interact with people with similar interests in person by posting messages such as ""Who wants to hike together!"" and ""Who wants to talk over a cup of coffee!""


3. Language Exchange Gathering: Language exchange gatherings are popular in areas where many foreigners live. Find people with the language you want to learn, teach them each other's languages, and have time to learn.


4. Join Local Events: Join various local events or gatherings on the local life bulletin board. This can be a great opportunity to experience the local culture and meet new people.


5. Maintain a Regular Meeting: Stay in touch with people you've met once. For example, you could meet up on a certain day of the week to have a regular meeting, such as exercising or having a meal together.


Through these methods, foreigners can make their lives in Korea more enjoyable and abundant, and they can deeply understand Korean culture and make new friends through exchanges with local people. I hope you can strengthen your connection with the local community by using Carrot Market and gain rich experiences by meeting various people.

1kgeri1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCGHAYYJs5w,I Made a Spec Commercial with my Friends,"**Submission Statement:**

I created this spec commercial to showcase the kind of commercial work I’d like to do with more time and resources. I wrote, directed, shot, and edited the piece myself. It was filmed on the Sony Venice (which I’ve been considering buying used) paired with the Atlas Mercury anamorphics (which I love).

**Lighting Approach:**

Since we filmed all four locations in a single day, our lighting package was intentionally small and the shoot leaned run-and-gun. Our two most involved setups were:

* **Movie Theater:** Aputure 600d on a spotlight mount created the flickering projector effect; a 1200d through magic cloth simulated the screen. We added some atmosphere by shaking out a rug for particles.
* **Coffee Shop:** A 1200d through the window acted as a key-side rim and pushed daylight onto the wall. We wrapped the key with an Aputure F22c. The rest of the lighting consisted of a 4x bounce, 4x neg, and the F22c running off a battery.

**What I’d Love Feedback On:**

I’m looking for honest feedback on the spot as a whole. What could have been improved? I was hoping to make an ad that would look believable in my portfolio (as opposed to something like Nike or another really famous brand), did I achieve that?",5,1746563151.0,Filmmakers,0,1.0,False

Apparently, I need to bring gifts.. lots of them.

What are some decent and smaller sized gift ideas? I got a regular size US domestic carry-on luggage (willing to upgrade to larger if necessary), and don't really know much about my relatives' hobbies, likes, and whatnot. Most of them, I've only seen once in the last 3 decades!

I'd love to bring unique roasted coffee beans from my local area since I'm into coffee and I know some of them are, too, but I would have to know about their coffee setup before buying whole vs roasted, etc. I'm wondering if I should just ask what they need since I'd have to ask anyway if I were to bring coffee. I did prepare some Trader Joe's tote bags since they are cute and cheap just to add on top of main gifts.

Kira leaned against the counter, apron loosened, hair pulled into a messy bun. Asiam wiped down tables with one hand, the other casually tucked into his hoodie pocket.

“You ever think about what you’d be doing if life went differently?” she asked, not looking at him.

He paused mid-wipe, glanced over. “Every day.”

Kira nodded slowly. “Me too.”

They didn’t say much after that, but the silence between them wasn’t awkward—it was thick. Like steam just before it boils.


---

A Week Later – After Closing

It started simple. Just her car wouldn’t start. Rain had been coming down in lazy sheets all day, and the lot was slick and empty.

“Hop in. I’ll take you home,” Asiam said, tossing his hoodie over his head and jogging to her passenger door.

She hesitated for half a second—then got in.

Inside the car, heat blasting, Kira reached over and turned the dial on the radio. A slow, soul-drenched groove filled the space between them.

“You like this?” she asked, smiling as her shoulders swayed slightly.

“It’s a vibe,” he said, watching her from the corner of his eye.

Her lip gloss was subtle tonight, but her smile still glowed.

The song melted into the background. The rain tapped soft rhythms on the roof.

Kira turned to him, her voice lower now. “You ever write about me?”

Asiam’s gaze flicked to her lips, then back to the road ahead—even though the car was parked.

“Nah,” he said.

But in the back of his mind, lines haunted him:

“Her laugh like a lighter flick, sparkin’ me up / I ain’t touched her, but she live in my touch...”

He hadn’t shown anyone that page. Not even himself since he wrote it.

Kira leaned in slightly, not rushing it. Her hand brushed his wrist. He didn’t move.

“You always this chill?” she whispered.

He turned toward her, really looked this time. Her eyes held questions she wasn’t asking. Her mouth was inches from his.

He wanted to kiss her.

But the thought of Lily slammed into his chest like cold water—seven years, fights and all. Familiarity. Obligation. Guilt.

He pulled back, not harsh—just enough.

Kira blinked, a flicker of something crossing her face. She leaned away, lips tight.

“Yeah... I should go.”

She opened the door without waiting. Rain painted streaks across the windshield, blurring her figure as she walked away.

Asiam sat there, jaw tight, grip on the wheel like he could strangle the feeling out of himself.

Almost.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OR6ZPwuZEM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OR6ZPwuZEM)

And the craziest part? It understands how to use applications better than most humans do.

# Why AI Super Agents Are Game-Changers For Business Owners

AI super agents are different from anything you've seen before.

This isn't just another ChatGPT window. This is AI that can actually control your entire Mac.

I've tested dozens of AI tools, but this new AI super agent called Vy just blew my mind.

It can:

* Write full SEO articles while you do nothing
* Create presentations in Keynote automatically
* Have conversations with ChatGPT on your behalf
* Operate apps you've never even used before

For busy entrepreneurs, this means reclaiming hours of your day.

The average business owner spends 3-4 hours daily on tasks that this AI super agent can now automate for free.

# What Makes An AI Super Agent Different From Regular AI?

Regular AI tools like ChatGPT sit in their own window and wait for you to ask questions.

An AI super agent like Vy actually interacts with your entire computer - clicking buttons, typing text, and operating applications just like a human would.

The key difference is that this AI super agent can:

1. See your entire screen
2. Understand what's on the screen
3. Interact with any application
4. Remember the steps it takes
5. Record everything it does for you to review later

Think of it like having a virtual assistant who sits at your computer and does work while you watch.

Except this assistant knows how to use applications better than most humans do. Even apps you've never touched before.

That's why I call this AGI-level intelligence - it can figure out interfaces and workflows that would take humans hours to learn.

# Real Examples: What I've Automated With My AI Super Agent

I've spent days testing what this AI super agent can do. Here are the impressive results:

# Writing SEO Articles Automatically

I simply told the AI super agent: ""Open up Pages and write the best possible SEO optimized article about SEO training.""

Without me touching my mouse once, it:

* Opened Pages
* Created a new document
* Wrote a 929-word SEO article
* Formatted it perfectly with headings and paragraphs
* Saved the document

Total time: 1 minute 18 seconds.

That's almost 1,000 words of content created in less time than it takes to make coffee.

# Having AI-to-AI Conversations

This one shocked me. I asked the AI super agent to: ""Open up ChatGPT and have a conversation about how AI could take over the world with autonomous AI super agents.""

Without me touching anything, it:

* Opened ChatGPT
* Started a new conversation
* Wrote prompts to ChatGPT
* Read ChatGPT's responses
* Asked follow-up questions
* Even had ChatGPT generate images

The conversation was more detailed than what I normally get when talking to ChatGPT myself.

When AI talks to AI, you get different results than when humans talk to AI. The prompts are more precise and the responses are often better.

# Automated Content Creation In Specialized Apps

I also tested the AI super agent with dscript (a specialized audio content creation app).

I said: ""Go to dscript, open a new project, and generate audio for it.""

The AI super agent:

* Opened dscript
* Navigated through the interface
* Created a new project
* Selected the AI speech option
* Started writing a script for audio generation

If you've ever tried to learn a new content creation tool, you know it can take hours just to figure out the basics. This AI did it in seconds.

# Where The AI Super Agent Struggled (Important Limitations)

No technology is perfect, and you deserve to know where this AI super agent has problems:

# 1. Google Chrome Is A Challenge

The AI super agent doesn't work well with Google Chrome. It seems to perform much better with native Mac applications than web-based tools.

When trying to use it with Chrome, it often got confused or couldn't interact properly with web elements.

# 2. Spreadsheets Cause Problems

When I asked it to ""open up Numbers and create an SEO website tracker,"" it completely failed.

It opened Numbers but couldn't effectively create or manipulate spreadsheets. It got stuck trying to create a useful tracking document.

# 3. Some Tasks Are Too Complex

The AI super agent sometimes gets stuck on complex tasks or fails to complete multi-step processes.

For example, when I asked it to ""generate a short podcast script about SEO,"" it started outlining the script but then got stuck and couldn't finish.

These limitations show it's not ready to completely replace humans yet. I'd give it 6-12 months before these issues are fixed.

1. Go to [vercept.com](http://vercept.com)
2. Download Vy for Mac (currently only available for Mac)
3. Install the application
4. Open it and start giving it commands

No coding required. No technical skills needed. Just download, install, and start automating.

# Security Concerns You Must Know About

Because this AI super agent takes control of your entire computer, there are important security considerations:

* Don't install it on computers with sensitive documents
* Be aware that it can access anything on your screen
* Consider using it on a separate device for work tasks
* Remember it's recording your screen while it works

This is the trade-off for powerful automation - giving AI access to your system means being careful about what it can see and control.

I recommend using this tool on a work-specific computer rather than your personal device with sensitive information.

# How To Make AI Super Agents Work 10X Better

After extensive testing, I discovered these tips make the AI super agent much more effective:

1. Open applications yourself before asking the AI to use them
2. Create blank documents/projects first, then let the AI write in them
3. Use simple, clear commands
4. Be specific about exactly what you want
5. Watch the recording afterward to learn how it works

Following these tips will dramatically improve your results and avoid frustration.

# The Future Impact Of AI Super Agents On Business

As an entrepreneur who's built a successful SEO agency, I see enormous potential in AI super agents.

Think about your average workday. How much time do you spend on:

* Writing content
* Creating presentations
* Responding to messages
* Setting up tools and software
* Managing your calendar

AI super agents can potentially eliminate 30-50% of this busywork.

When that happens, entrepreneurs can focus on high-level strategy, client relationships, and business growth - the things AI can't do.

The businesses that adopt these tools first will have a significant competitive advantage. They'll produce more content, move faster, and operate with lower costs.

# Why Most People Will Miss This Opportunity

Despite the game-changing potential, most people will miss out on AI super agents because:

1. They're afraid of new technology
2. They don't want to learn new systems
3. They're concerned about security
4. They don't see the immediate benefit

This creates a massive opportunity for entrepreneurs who are willing to adopt early.

While others are still doing everything manually, you could be automating 30-50% of your daily tasks.

# Quality Control Is Still Essential

Even with this impressive AI super agent, quality control remains critical.

Always review what the AI creates. While it can produce content quickly, you'll still need to check for:

* Factual accuracy
* Brand voice consistency
* SEO optimization
* Content quality

This isn't a ""set it and forget it"" solution - it's a powerful tool that still needs human oversight.

# FAQs About AI Super Agents

# Is this AI super agent only available for Mac?

Yes, currently Vy is only available for Mac computers. Windows versions may come in the future.

# How much does it cost?

Right now, it's completely free. This may change as it develops further.

# Is it safe to use?

You should be careful about giving any tool control of your computer. Don't use it on systems with sensitive information.

# Can it work with any application?

It works best with native Mac applications. It struggles with Google Chrome and some specialized software.

# Will this replace my job?

For some repetitive tasks, yes. But human oversight, strategy, and creativity remain essential.

# Community And Support For AI Super Agent Users

If you're excited about AI super agents but don't know who to talk to about it, I've got good news.

The AI Profit Boardroom community has 630+ members all interested in AI automation. You'll find:

* Weekly live Q&A calls

# Final Thoughts: The Beginning Of A New Era

We're witnessing the early days of a revolution in how we work with computers.

Instead of us learning software, AI is learning to use software for us.

This removes the technical barriers that slow down so many entrepreneurs and businesses.

While tools like Vy have limitations today, they show where we're headed - a world where AI handles the busywork so humans can focus on creativity, strategy, and growth.

I like italian style espresso. That usually means around 80% arabica, 20% robusta, medium or medium - dark roast. Thick, sirupy, chocolaty, nuty, no acidity, espresso. 

There are plenty of big supermarket roasters (Illy, Kimbo, Lavazza,...) but you can't get them fresh. Most are 6+ months old if you are lucky. But mostly age is even 1 year or more. 

There are plenty available on espresso international online shop (La Genovese, di Giampaolo, Dersut,...) where roasting dates are better, from 1 month to 6 months. You get what you get and i don't know the companies? Are they good? How old is still good enough? In plan to buy couple kg, freeze whole bag and sepparate one into single dosing jars (also freeze). 

I also asked Musetti (I've read they are very good) how to get freshest roast and they basically said they roast certain batch in one go, store it and sell it. When it runs out, they roast again. They don't know when will that be and they don't provide roasting dates on their site. Last batch of certain coffee i was interested in was roasted in january and they are still selling it.

I also wrote to Saka but got no answer yet. 

So where in EU can i get really good italian style beans/roast on regular basis (always fresh)? There are so many roasters with nice online shops but all are 3rd wave speciality, single origin kind of deal. I want 2nd wave classic but fresh. ",2,1746562322.0,espresso,7,1.0,False
