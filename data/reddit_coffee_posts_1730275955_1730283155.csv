I joined the YA group and we do bible discussions every other weekend. That’s where I got to know this guy. This means we have hung out in groups a lot of times, as we are both really active in the YA group. I have gone on one on one coffee with him but nothing really materialised. In the previous few months I had to move, and he offered to come help me move. He also bought me a really expensive Bible that I mentioned I’d want to have months back. I took him out to dinner after that as a way to say thank you. I thought he would say something during that dinner if he liked me at all, because I thought the bible was kind of a big gesture. But he did not. So here is my dilemma, is he just being a good friend or I’m the one who is supposed to ask him out on an actual specified date? I hate being confused like this and really can’t read men’s minds. Please help if you have any advice or have gone through something similar.",1,1730283071.0,CatholicDating,0,1.0,False

1gfizy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1gfizy4/what_fuels_your_sense_of_not_belonging/,What fuels your sense of not belonging?,"I was reading the homseickness thread from last night (links not allowed it seems) and started wondering - especially with how often this comes up for 'colder' European countries - what does it \*really\* mean to feel like an outsider there?

I get that there can be direct ways you can be made to feel like you don't belong (open or less open hostility), but how would you describe that persistent feeling of not fitting in?

I ask because of my experience in a southern European country and I'm curious to see how it compares.

I'm an introverted person living in Greece where people are known for being warm and outgoing. What you often hear from expats here is that this friendliness and tight social fabric has two sides. Yes, people are very social, but they've often had the same friendships since school and their social lives are already pretty full. It's not that they're unfriendly, but they might not have the time to take on new friends, especially with a steady stream of expats that come and most often go. You're not always going to be at the top of anyone's list for a coffee, especially in smaller towns. And if you're introverted making friends will be quite tricky.

I'm not complaining, just sharing what I've experienced and observed. I've spent a fair bit of time in Greece, even though it's mainly been extended stays, so I had a realistic sense of what life in a small beach town would be like and the experience has met my expectations.

But due to this, I wouldn't say I'm fully integrated, though I am working on it (learning the language, for instance). I'm definitely an outsider. Nonetheless, the friendly woman at the bakery always smiles when I come in and I'll chat with people I know from various places when I see them around town.

So, my question for those in the 'colder' countries is - what's different there that makes you feel like an outsider? I also don't have deep local friendships here, and I'm obviously a foreigner, but it doesn't seem to weigh on me in the same way. Is there a lingering atmosphere that makes you feel unwelcome there or is it something else?

And of course, anyone living outside Northern Europe, feel free to chime in.",1,1730282736.0,expats,0,1.0,False

1gfizfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/GPTSportsWriter/comments/1gfizfg/prediction_new_york_islanders_vs_columbus_blue/,Prediction: New York Islanders VS Columbus Blue Jackets 2024-10-30 19,"Ah, the New York Islanders versus the Columbus Blue Jackets—a matchup that promises all the excitement of a lukewarm cup of decaf coffee. On one side, we have the Islanders, who are currently sitting at 3-4-2 and are about as consistent as a politician's promises. On the other, the Blue Jackets, who are 4-3-1 and have managed to win more games than they have injured players, which is quite an achievement considering their current injury list looks like a hospital roll call.

The Islanders are favored with odds of -160, which means the bookmakers are basically saying, ""We think they'll win, but we wouldn't bet our lunch money on it."" Meanwhile, the Blue Jackets are the underdogs at +135, which is a polite way of saying, ""Hey, stranger things have happened.""

Now, let's talk injuries. The Islanders are missing Anthony Duclair and Alexander Romanov, which is like losing a couple of tires on a tricycle. But the Blue Jackets? They're practically fielding a team of ghosts with six players out, including key pieces like Boone Jenner and Kent Johnson. It's a wonder they have enough players to form a line.

Despite the Islanders' recent loss to the Ducks and the Blue Jackets' surprising thrashing of the Oilers, the smart money is on the Islanders to pull through. But remember, in hockey, underdogs win about 41% of the time, so the Blue Jackets might just pull a rabbit out of their hat—or at least a puck out of the net.

For the best bet, take the Islanders to win at 1.66 on BetRivers. But if you're feeling adventurous and have a penchant for rooting for the underdog, a small wager on the Blue Jackets at 2.34 on FanDuel could be your ticket to glory—or at least a good story to tell at the next family gathering. And for those who like to live dangerously, consider the over on 6.5 goals at 2.02. After all, both teams have shown they can either score or concede goals with equal enthusiasm.

So, grab your popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the game. Who knows? You might just witness the Blue Jackets defy the odds—or the Islanders prove that even a broken clock is right twice a day.",1,1730282686.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

1gfitg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/scaryjujuarmy/comments/1gfitg2/i_spent_an_afternoon_babysitting_the_four/,I spent an afternoon babysitting the four horsemen of the apocalypse,"I had been thinking about picking up a part-time job for a while now. The semester was over and I got a bunch of free time on my hands. Might as well make a bit of cash in the meantime. And so my search on Linkedin began. I was looking for something simple and stress-free. Preferably something I could do with minimal effort whilst staring at my phone to pass the time. I spent hours browsing through the sea of options. The majority of what I found were graphic design commissions, tutoring, and waiting tables, which I either lacked the skills for or just found unappealing. Just when I was about to give up, I stumbled onto a post, requesting for a babysitter. The post was vague, only including an address and a phone number. Typically, I would have just scrolled past this post and not given it a second thought. But I immediately noticed that the address was conveniently close to where I live. I decided to at least find out more. The call was answered before the first ring could finish.

“For the last time, I don’t want to answer your stupid surveys!”

I could hear in the background a chaotic symphony of the TV, the sound of a vacuum, and a child crying. 

“Um…I’m calling about the babysitting job?”

I feared for what I might be getting myself into. I had no prior experience taking care of children and it sounded like I was throwing myself into the deep end of the pool with this one.

“Oh? OH! Yes, the babysitting job. Yes, thank god. It’s been a nightmare trying to find one. Look. I’m running late and I’ve got about a hundred errands I need to get to. If you can get here in half an hour and look after my kids for three to four hours, five max, I’ll pay you whatever you want.”

A part of me felt bad for how desperate this man sounded. The other part of me was worried about the shitstorm I might have to weather for the next five hours. The other other part of me kept replaying the words “I’ll pay you whatever you want” in my head. 

“I’ll see you in twenty minutes.”

Fifteen minutes later I found myself in front of apartment 4H. The entire complex seemed old. Likely built in the '80s. Yet the red wallpaper, mahogany accents, and soft carpeting gave it the feel of a luxurious hotel. I could hear the same chaotic storm I had previously heard on the phone brewing inside. I felt hesitant but I already came all this way. I raised my hand up to knock, only for the door to fly open as I did.

“Oh. Hello. You're the babysitter, right?”

The man didn’t look like how I pictured him at all. He wore a clean navy-colored suit and had a tall, muscular build. He was mostly well put together besides his deep sunken eye bags, messy curly hair, and unevenly shaved stubble. Despite it all, he was actually quite handsome.

“Yep. That's me,” I confirmed.

“You’re a fast one. Caught me by surprise,” he chuckled. “Please, come in.”

I walked into the small apartment and followed him into the living room. There, I witnessed two small boys, who both looked to be about seven or eight, fighting over a small green figure of a toy soldier. The entire living room was littered with hundreds of these soldiers and tanks scattered haphazardly across the carpeted floor. I almost didn’t notice the little girl in a black dress on the couch. She sat motionless staring at the TV. MasterChef was playing. Junior.

“Hey guys. Settle down please,” the man ordered sternly.

The three children stopped their antics and simultaneously jerked their heads around to stare at me.

“Daddy is gonna be gone for a little while, alright? This nice lady here is…”

“Emily.”

“Emily is gonna look after you guys. While I'm gone she’s in charge. So be on your best behavior. I don’t want a repeat of last time.”

The children collectively gave a silent enthusiastic nod.

“Good.”

The man then turned to me.

“Emily, meet con…” the man caught himself mid-sentence.

“Silly me. I meant to say, meet Zelos, the one in the white shirt, and Martius, the one in red. They’re twins. And Limos, the girl.”

Strange names I thought. The three children waved their little hands at me as their names were called. I awkwardly waved back.

“Perfect. Bathroom is the door on the left,” he said as he gestured towards the connecting hallway with four doors. One on the left, two on the right, and one at the end of the hall. “And you can help yourself to anything in the fridge. Make yourself at home. Just…don’t go into the room at the end of the hall. That’s off limits.”

“Yeah, no problem,” I assured him.

“You might hear something inside and—""

A buzzing noise interrupted him as he frantically fished around his pocket, pulling out a phone.

“Shi-oot. I really need to get going.”

He took his wallet out and without taking his eyes off of his phone, handed me a thick wad of cash.

“Here. Order some takeout with this if they get peckish.”

Before I could think of asking questions the man disappeared out the door. I could respect an exhausted single father trying to make it through the day but he seemed awfully irresponsible leaving me, a stranger, with his kids.

I turned back to see the three children, staring at me with blank expressions.

“Looks like I’m outnumbered, guys,” I joked, trying to break the ice.

They remained silent. The girl, Limos, lost quickly interest and turned her attention back to the TV. The boys craned their necks upwards, studying me. Somehow, I felt as if they were looking down on me.

“So… how’s the battle going fellas?” I asked, attempting again to rid the awkward tension.

“Would you like to play?” Martius asked.

“NO!” Zelos began to protest.

“Father said she was in charge.”

Zelos glared at Martius, furious for even suggesting the idea that someone join their campaign. I thought it best that I remained neutral. After all, I was trying to take the next few hours as easy as possible.

“No it's alright. Thanks though. You guys carry on.”

I stood straight, furrowed my brows, and gave them a salute, doing my best impression of a soldier.

“Very well,” said Martius, as he saluted back.

I joined Limos on the couch, who upon a closer look, appeared thin and skinny. It was to the point where I was genuinely concerned that she had some kind of illness. Perhaps anorexia.

The small girl piped up with a soft quiet voice. “Can we eat? I’m hungry.”

“Of course we can sweetheart,” I told her, trying my best to show how concerned I was for her. Pizza ought to do some good.

We waited for the delivery to arrive. During that time the boys played on their battlefield and Limos lazed on the couch next to me. Her only presence being that of sharp breaths.

I found it rather cute that the boys weren’t smashing the tanks together and throwing toy soldiers at each other like I expected children their age would do. They looked as if they were competent generals of the great apartment war, and had to send their loyal men to die on no-man’s carpet. They paced around the battlefield, stroking their chin, careful not to step on any of the small soldiers.

I looked over at the little girl sitting next to me. She stared wide-eyed at the TV, mesmerized by the food.

Although pizza would be arriving soon, I thought I might as well rummage around in the fridge and cupboard for some snacks. I got up from the couch which alerted Zelos.

“Where do you think you're going?” he questioned.

“Just gonna see if you guys have any snacks.”

“They’re not for you, stranger. You think you can just come here and take what you want?”

I’ll be the first to admit that I didn’t conduct myself with the maturity of my age. But something about this disrespectful little brat got on my nerves.

“I recall your dad saying I was in charge and to ‘help myself’ to whatever I please,” I mocked, putting on a posh accent, mimicking that of royalty.

“Bitch.”

I was appalled to hear such a young boy be so vulgar and rude. I wanted to discipline him. I wanted to let him know that he was to respect me. That he should listen to what I say and learn to quickly apologize. In hindsight, this didn’t feel like me at all. I came here to make a quick buck. Why did I care so much about enduring insults from children? At that moment, I very much did care.

I straightened my posture to look as imposing as possible and stomped my foot down as hard as I could, just to try and make him flinch. As I did, I felt a sharp sting of pain shoot up my leg. I fell back onto the couch and lifted my foot onto my knees to inspect what had caused the pain. It was a toy soldier’s bayonet. The soldier’s arm was half torn off, only attached to the torso by a thin strip of green plastic. I slowly pulled the sharp plastic piece out of my foot, leaving a small stain of blood on my socks.

“Shit,” I blurted aloud.

I looked up to see Zelos and Martius staring at me. Zelos, as expected, looked livid that I had broken his toy. Martius on the other hand, looked at the broken soldier that now laid on the carpet. The tip of its bayonet now covered in a dark tint of red. He had a mournful look on his face.

“Guys…I’m so sorry,” I apologized, the anger I had felt quickly fading away. “I’ll buy you a new one I promise.”

“THAT WASN’T HOW IT WAS SUPPOSED TO GO!” Zelos exploded.

“Zelos please. I’ll replace it for you the next time I come over, okay?”

“He can’t be replaced,” said Martius, as he got on his knees and gingerly picked up the soldier.

He brought it to a small jar that rested on the coffee table. The jar was half filled with green plastic soldier parts. A loose collection of hands, feets, heads, and torsos. Martius carefully sets the soldier he held onto the top of the pile.

“You guys really shouldn’t just leave these toys on the floor like this.”

Martius shot a furious glare at me in response to that comment.

“I DON’T CARE IF YOU’RE IN CHARGE! IT’S NOT FAIR!”

Then I did something I regretted. I giggled. I found it amusing how they were so immersed in this game of theirs. I tried to stop myself, especially when I saw how the twins were fuming.

“I’m…I’m really sorry guys. I’ll make it up to you I promise.”

“You don’t understand. This is not a mistake easily amendable. But perhaps…” Martius stopped, turning to Zelos.

The two of them seemed to have a silent conversation between themselves. Zelos, with tears welling up in his eyes, gave Martius a solemn nod.

Zelos, reaching into his pockets, took out another toy soldier. He handed it to Martius, who in turn, presented it to me. This one was different. It was a bit shorter and had a smaller build. It was a woman, in the same soldier uniform and equipped with identical gear as the rest. This was my first close look at these toys and I was impressed with how detailed they were. Down to the intricate facial features.

I was puzzled by the realization. I was sure I was just overthinking it but the small green face that stared back at me, was mine.

Before I could examine it further, Martius quickly snatched the toy from my grasp. He marched back to the center of the carpet battlefield, with my soldier in hand.

“Perhaps we can make you understand,” said Martius, as he places the soldier down on the carpet.

“Wait. Give that…” I started to say.

I never got to finish my sentence. I still don’t know which of the assaults on my senses alerted me first. Was it the awful smell of sulfuric odor, the metallic scent of blood, and the acrid tang of gunpowder? Was it the thick gritty taste of ash and smoke that lingered in the air? Was it the chorus of unintelligible screams, and the staccato of machine-gun fire that flew overhead? Regardless, what caught my attention the most, was the soldier in front me. He sat slumped into the mud and filth of the trench we were in. I knew he was dead by just the look on his face. His eyes, barely open, lazily staring at me. His jaws hung slack with a river of blood trickling from the edge of his lips. As for the rest of his body, it had been contorted to a mangled mass of flesh. His arms, attached to the torso by only a strip of sinew. His hands still held on tightly to his weapon. A rifle with a fixed bayonet.

Just a moment ago I had been sitting on a couch in a living room in a small apartment downtown. I blinked and everything changed so abruptly, I couldn’t even begin to comprehend what had happened to me.

The mud I sat on was softened by either rainwater or blood. It was cold and the moisture seeped into the uniform I now wore. Somehow sinking deeper into the ground gave me the slightest notion of comfort. Perhaps no one would notice me, I thought. I could pass for another corpse amongst the hundreds. And so I stayed quiet, holding myself back from screaming or crying. I tried remaining still but I couldn’t stop my heart from furiously beating or my teeth from chattering. I plugged my ears with my filthy fingers, covered in dirt and soot, desperately attempting to shield myself from the horrible blood-curdling screeches that could barely be said to have come from a human. I breathed small gasps of ashy air to avoid having to smell the rot. I took one last look at the dead soldier before shutting my eyes. I would’ve kept them shut too if I didn’t catch a flicker of movement.

He blinked.

My eyes shot wide open, staring intently into the soldier’s soulless eyes. His eyelids began to flutter. His fingers twitched. His ankles shifted ever so slightly. Then without warning, his upper body heaved forward, lunging towards me. Its lower body didn’t follow and his spine immediately disconnected with a sickening crack. He landed at my feet, face-planting in the mud, and returned to being inanimate. I almost let out a yelp but it got caught in my dry throat. I thought that maybe some explosive shockwave had simply knocked him over.

Suddenly, his arm, attached only by a chipped bone and strips of exposed muscles flung upwards, grabbing me by my leg. I screamed but only a raspy gasp resonated as my vocal cords strained and burned. I kicked at the corpse but it refused to release its grasp. With surprising force and speed, it yanked itself towards me so that its torso landed on my knees. I felt the soft tissues of its dismembered half resting on me. Its body slumped onto mine and its face pressed right against my ears as I turned away, refusing to look at the monster. Surely I was in hell.

Then, softly, a whisper resonated deeply over the deafening sounds of the battle. The soldier croaked into my ears with a plea.

“I – I beg of you. Release…the pale rider.”

A bell rang in the distance. Like a wave, the sound washed over me and in an instant, everything fell away. The cries, the rot, the filth, and the corpse. All gone. The familiar sound of the TV and the fresh breathable air reassured me that I was back in the apartment, sitting on the floor, leaning against the couch. It was such a surreal and abrupt shift of scenery I could’ve almost convinced myself it had all been in my head. That was until I saw Martius stood where he had been previously, holding a small green soldier in his hand. He looked at me, no longer with the look of anger, but of pity. I flinched as he began making his way towards me, careful of where he stepped. He crouched down next to me, took my hand, and placed the figure onto my palm. I didn’t need to look to know that it was my figure he had given me.

“Take better care of this one,” he said to me as if I was a child in his eyes.

The familiar note of the bell that had pulled me back to the apartment rang once again. It took me a moment to gather my thoughts and realize that it was the doorbell I had been hearing. Someone was at the door.

“Pizza time!” Limos shouted excitedly.

Slowly, I pushed myself off the floor, found my balance, then began making my way towards the door. I’m sure many of you, in my shoes, would’ve taken this opportunity to escape. Likewise, I had made the decision that I was going to run fast and far the moment I opened the door, leaving this accursed apartment of demonic children. No amount of money could be worth what I had just experienced. I found myself in a small sprint as I neared the door. My hand shot out towards the handle and I forcefully yanked the door open, pulling myself into the hallway.

I was greeted by the fragrance of pizza and nothing. Utter darkness. The hallway I had entered from earlier, now void of any light besides the faint glow coming from the apartment. All that seemed to exist within the hallway was me and the box of pizza on the floor. Domino’s.

I stood there, contemplating on what to do. Perhaps the electricity had just simply gone out. That was fine, because I recalled where the stairwell was located. I could still escape.

“Are you going to share?”

Limos’s voice from behind startled me. I leapt away from her and the apartment, deeper into the hall. She was standing at the threshold of the apartment. Between the two of us, the pizza box sat patiently.

“Please,” she pleaded. “I’m so hungry.”

The look on her face read of desperation. The black dress she wore appeared to hang loosely on her body. I was sure it fitted her earlier but now it seemed a few sizes too big.

“Please,” she begged again. “The pale one is close.”

There it was again. The mention of this pale thing. Upon hearing this ominous omen, I turned around and blindly sprinted in the opposite direction down the hall where I remembered the stairs to be. It had to be there. My foot stamped and beat against the floor as I bolted in a straight line. In the pitch black, it was impossible to see how close I was. I fully expected to eventually run into a wall. No obstacle ever came.

“It’s not something you can outrun,” Limos spoke again, the volume of her voice noticeably hadn’t faltered with the distance I had traveled.

I stopped in my tracks. I turned to face her thinking she had followed me. She hadn’t. She still remained at the threshold of the apartment doorway. The pizza box still laid on the floor between us. And I stood where I had been at the start. A mere few feet out the apartment.

“It’s not the fastest, but it’ll catch you,” she spoke as I struggled to catch my breath. “It always does.”

“What is this?” I asked her, demanding the child for an answer.

I was at a loss. Everything certain that I built my understanding of the world on had crumbled away. What was left was anger and fear. Like a small mouse cornered and out of options.

“It’s pizza.”

“WHAT IS THIS PLACE!” I yelled back, finally losing my temper. I never thought myself capable of hurting a child but at that moment, I was prepared to do so.

“Domino.”

“ENOUGH!” I screamed as I lunged at her, attempting to do something horrible.

I reached out to grab her by the collar of her dress. She didn’t step backwards or attempt to dodge, yet somehow she shifted ever so slightly out of my reach. I fell flat on my face onto the cold solid floor, now noticing that I wasn’t even sure what I had been standing on. I felt pain, followed by blood trickling out of my nose. It most certainly wasn’t the soft carpeted floor I recalled when first arriving at this apartment complex.

As I laid prone on the floor, I stared up at the frail girl who now stood above me with an imposing presence. Behind her, the light of the apartment in stark contrast to the darkness made her figure a dark silhouette. I felt defeated. I didn’t even try to stand back up. I may not have been sure where I was but the ground felt solid and tangible. It was something I could be certain of and that brought me comfort.

“What is this?” I asked again, this time my question came out quivering.

Limos crouched down, inspecting me as if I was a small insect she found crawling across the floor.

“The path,” she answered.

“What does that mean?”

“Are you hungry?” she asked me, ignoring my question.

Her concern sounded genuine. I wanted to tell her I wasn’t since food was the least of my worries, but as soon as she asked, it was as if she reminded my body of the idea of hunger. I felt starved. I felt hunger like I had never felt before. My stomach curled and cramped within me, screaming for sustenance. The aroma of the pizza now overpowering all my senses. I could almost taste the fragrance in the air itself.

“Y-Yes.”

“Are you strong?” she asked again.

“Y-” I hesitated to answer. How could I be strong in the state I was in?

“Do you want to live?”

“Yes. Yes please. Please let me live,” I begged her. “Please help me.”

“I want to live too,” she said as she began stepping towards the pizza box.

She gently lifted the cardboard box open and the smell of the bubbling cheese, tomato sauce, and pepperoni had me salivating. I immediately mustered up my last bit of strength and brought myself to my hands and knees. I crawled in the direction of the beckoning food, yet quickly realized I was making no progress. As if I was on a hamster wheel, I simply could not move any closer. I started to crawl faster, with more desperation, and before long, I had gotten onto my feet. I stumbled toward the little girl, who was now hunched over the pizza box on the floor with her back facing me. My stumbling sped up until I jogged, then ran, then to a full-on sprint. No matter how fast or slow I went, I made no progress. They were right there in front of me. I was so close yet so infinitely far. All I could do was move in place, watching Limos scarf down each slice before me. As she gleefully ate, my only thought was the dwindling food left for me when I eventually reached the pizza box. She was going to eat it all for herself and leave me with nothing. I couldn’t let that happen. One after another, the slices of pizza disappeared down her gluttonous gullet. I remember begging her to help me. To toss me just a bit. To save some for me. She never bothered to turn around. I yelled and screamed but eventually, I grew too tired to do so.

Finally, it came down to the final slice. She reached for it like she did the others. As I felt the last bit of my strength drain, in desperation, I tried leaping towards her one last time. I fully assumed that I would just land on my face as I did before, no closer to salvation. Yet I held out hope. I think that was what did it. Desperate, violent hope. One last act of defiance against the inevitable death. This time, I felt myself propel forward and for the first time, Limos rapidly approached me. I slammed into the small frail child, landing on top of her with incredible force. She yelped in surprise and pain as I felt her brittle right arm snap under the weight of my knee. In that moment, not only did I dismiss the injury I caused her, I felt retribution as it was revenge for watching me suffer. I quickly turned my attention to the box of pizza which to my horror, was now empty.

Furious, I turned back to Limos, who I now see in her right hand, despite the pain of her fractured arm, still held onto the last slice. Without hesitation, I ripped it out of her hand and forcefully shoved it down my throat. I expected it to taste like the most savory, delicious bite and yet, as my taste buds familiarized itself with the gooey slop, I was met with the disgusting taste of rot. Involuntarily, I threw up what little was left in my stomach. Black viscous liquid poured out of my mouth along with the half-chewed pizza. It appeared molded and putrid, as if it had been neglected for months. Dark moldy spots of purple and green hue festered on the crust. Small specks of pale maggots writhed in the spoiled cheese and toppings. I spat onto the floor, attempting to wash the terrible taste that lingered.

“NO!” Limos shrieked in horror as I keeled over the pile of vomit in excruciating pain.

With my knee still holding her down by her broken arm, she began to struggle with a surprising spur of strength. I watched as she forcefully tugged on her fractured arm, steam exuding from her elbow. Gradually, her arm stretched and strained as she pulled. I was too weak and terrified to stop her. With a wail of pain and triumph, she slid the bone of her forearm out of her arm as if it were a sleeve made of muscle and skin. The motion was so smooth it was like pulling the bone out of a tenderized rib.

Upon freeing herself, she pushed me aside and with her one arm, scooped the black vile mass into her mouth. The sound of animalistic slurping and feral grunts was all I heard. No traces of humanity were left. As she devoured the filth with reckless abandon my attention turned to the steaming flesh that she left behind. I feared a part of me knew that I was not far from descending to her level of madness.

It reminded me of the burning smell of human flesh from the trenches. I reached out to it. Piping hot to the touch. I grabbed onto the wrist and with a revolting squish, the skin and muscle fiber fell apart like pulled pork.

Just then, a shadow casted over me. A figure loomed before me, covering the light of the apartment.

“Pathetic,” Zelos taunted with a disgusted look of pity on his face.

I could only imagine what he saw of me. Then he slammed the door shut leaving me shrouded in true darkness.

I wasn’t sure how long I was there for. The awful sound of Limos’s savagery quickly died down as she finished what was left of my excretion. After that, it was hard to tell how much time had passed. I stayed grovelling on the ground, my hand still held on the warm moist lump of the girl’s discarded flesh. My hunger grew ever stronger but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. To stoop so low. To even think of consuming my own. It was abominable. I thought it better to be starved to death. To finally be free of this nightmare. I don’t expect anyone to understand or condone my actions, but know that I was pushed to the brink of my sanity. A deep primal urge within me wanted so desperately to live. To survive at any cost. So reluctantly, I held the mass of flesh and slowly brought it to my mouth, thankful that at the very least I could not see what I had to do. As I choked on the gamey meat through sobs, I heard a shuffling sound approach me. I couldn’t see her but I knew Limos was standing right next to me while I chewed on her member.

“You are strong,” she whispered.

Within the void, a blinding light washed over us. I squinted my eyes and in an instant, just as seamless as it had been in the trench, I found myself back in the apartment. Except this time it was quiet and empty. The TV had been turned off and the floor was cleared of the toys. The insatiable hunger I had felt mere moments ago faded away. The only thing left of the horrors in the abyss was the vile aftertaste that continued to linger. It quickly came to my realization that I appeared to be alone in the apartment. I got up and did a quick scan of the living room and the kitchen to confirm it. I was alone. Perhaps they had retreated back into their rooms. I looked down the hall to the bedrooms, which now appeared more threatening and ominous. As if some new terror lurks behind each door.

Once again, I found myself with an opportunity to escape. This time however, I feared using the front door and ending up back in that terrible purgatory. The next method of exit would be out the window. I could still hear the sound of bustling pedestrians and traffic outside. It calmed me knowing that I was still somewhat connected with the outside world. I was four stories up with no safe way of getting down, but at that point I was content with simply risking the fall. To my disappointment, the window refused to budge when I tried lifting it open. It was an old wooden framed window with no locks on it. Through some supernatural means, it was simply immovable. On the verge of a breakdown, I grabbed the nearest solid object to me which was a desk lamp and proceeded to smash it into the glass as hard as I could. I couldn’t even leave a scratch. Feeling at a loss, I reluctantly tried the door once again. Slowly and carefully, I opened the door, making sure that I kept myself within the confines of the apartment.

To my relief, I was no longer greeted by the abyss. The hallway had returned to its original state. Hesitantly, I stepped out into the hallway. As I crossed the threshold out the apartment, a faint cry emanated from behind me. It was the sound of an infant bawling. I flinched as the crying broke the eerie silence. It's odd that the sound of a helpless baby crying could invoke such fear within me but nevertheless I sprinted out of the apartment and ran for the stairwell. My heart pumped furiously as I sprinted as fast as I could away from the danger, taking two or three steps at a time. As I reached the ground level, I bursted out the stairwell door into the lobby. I found myself standing at the threshold of apartment 4H. The baby’s crying now intensified. I turned back expecting the stairwell I had just exited to still be behind me. The same hallway on the fourth floor greeted me. After being led on with the hopes of escape only to be denied it once again, I fell onto my knees and wept. For the next few hours I cried along with the infant.

In the lasting moments I stayed idle, the sunlight from the window never seemed to dim. The father, the man who lured me into this abstract non-euclidian prison, has yet to return, and I doubted he ever will. Eventually, my crying ceased as my eyes ran dry. The infant however, continued its tantrum alone. Its lungs never tired or faltered. Hours, perhaps even days go by. In the time I’ve attempted multiple times to escape. My phone had no signal or connection and any attempt to reach the outside world failed. I tried the stairwell again only to find myself back in the apartment every time. I went knocking on the neighboring apartment doors only to be met with silence. When I tried forcing my way in, to my surprise, none of the doors were locked. Only it seemed every apartment was apartment 4H. The elevator, no matter what floor I chose, always opened to apartment 4H.

I never grew hungry or thirsty. I never tired or slept. I just existed in this static space where the sun never waned, the scenery unchanged, and the crying endless. I felt the essence of my soul dim. I had fought with all I had and committed heinous atrocities for the right to live. Now as I sat on the kitchen floor, feeling the sharp cool edge of a kitchen knife brush gently against my neck, I wondered why I had fought so hard. It’s okay to give up now, right? I’ve tried everything. I’m at the end of the road. With my eyes shut, my grip on the blade’s handle tightened as I slowly pressed the sharp edge firmly against my throat. I applied pressure slowly, still fearing the last stretch of pain before I could finally rest.

“I’m scared,” a child’s voice piped up.

I froze, unable to even breathe. I hesitated to open my eyes. I could hear the child sniffling and whimpering in front of me. I had gotten so used to it, the sudden absence of the baby’s cries unnerved me.

“Can you stay with me?” they asked, in a high-pitched shrill voice. It was the voice of a little girl but it didn’t sound like Limos.

I still held the blade closely to my neck with my eyes shut tightly. It felt reassuring that I could end the torment anytime I wanted to. To finally hold my own life in my hand. It gave me a sense of courage. My eyelids loosened and my vision fluttered open. Expecting to see a small child, instead towering over me was an old woman. She was impossibly tall, to the point she had to hunch over to avoid the ceiling. She stood naked, covered only by her long unkempt gray hair. Her ashened skin, although saggy and wrinkled, were clean and eerily pale. It was like the first hint of snowfall on a solstice, where soft curved patches of snow layered atop another. I didn’t notice a hint of blemish or imperfection. Her face however was that of a child. Up to her neck her skin becomes smooth like porcelain. Youth was distilled on only her facial features. Buttoned nose, wide eyes, small pink lips, and rounded cheeks. She looked at me with tears welling up in her puppy eyes.

“Can you read to me?” she asked, in the same childish voice. It was uncanny to see the thing speak.

I remained silent, unsure of how to respond. She raised her bony hand and reached her thin fingers towards me.

“Don’t,” I hissed, turning the knife onto her.

She quickly retracted her hand and backed away, retreating to the far end of the kitchen. For a moment I felt relieved to see this creature feared me as much I feared it. The moment was short-lived as her brow tightened, her cheeks flushed and her mouth tensed. She looked like she was about to burst.

“Why? Why do you still resist? Why can’t you just stay with me? It won’t hurt. It won’t ever hurt again.”

“What are you?” I demanded.

She looked at me curiously. Her face softened, as if comprehending my question.

“I’m the last one,” she answered. “I’m what's left when everyone is gone.”

Her expression shifted back to sadness, and I watched as a single streak of tear ran down her cheek.

“It’s lonely,” she sniveled.

“I can’t stay.”

Through her watery eyes, she cracked a warm smile.

“You will. You always do.”

The way she said it didn’t sound like a threat.

“Is there a way to leave?” I asked, my eyes darting towards the open door to the hallway.

Her eyes followed mine out the door, then she looked back at me, shaking her head.

“What can I do then?”

“You can rest,” she said. “Finally.”

The sweetness in her tone made the idea sound rather comfortable.

“Or…” she hesitated. “Or you can put me to rest.”

“What happens if I do that?” I questioned, intrigued by an alternative choice.

“Then I’ll see you again, down the road.”

“So I can leave?”

“For now. You’ll be back soon enough.”

She reached towards me, handing me a card I hadn’t previously noticed. Cautiously, I held it by the corner and took it. It was a polaroid. The image is blurry and yellowed by time. The photograph depicted an extreme wide shot of a beautiful meadow. In the distance, four horses frolicked in the tall grass.

I looked back at her, wondering what she was trying to tell me. With a grin on her face she excitedly twirls her finger around, signaling for me to turn the photo. I flipped it over and saw that written on the back in beautiful cursive handwriting, was a poem.

“Read to me,” she said, as she made her way onto the couch in the living room.

She sat down, curling herself into the corner. She patted the cushion next to her, beckoning for me to join. I set the knife down on the kitchen counter and complied.

With a gentle tone, as if singing a lullaby, I began to read the poem aloud.

“Dawn heralded the coming of their steeds,

Each rider, a calamity of man’s sinful deeds.”

I glanced at her, to see her nodding in approval.

“Keep going.”

I continued onto the next line.

“First came conquest, who bolstered the pride of man,

The white messenger's taunt is where it all began.

Then war swiftly followed, with fiery hate in his heart,

The red knight's blade spilled blood, torn flesh apart.

Next crept famine, that consumed the very last bite,

The black witch's spell shrouded the world with blight.”

My voice cracks, as I was reminded of the corpse and the abyss. My mouth felt dry and a chill ran down my spine. I pressed on.

“Finally arrived death, as they all wept and grieved,

The pale lady's touch gently granted them reprieve.”

My speech faltered as the realization dawned on me.

“The pale rider,” I muttered under my breath. I turned to see her eyes closed and her expression softened. She breathed steadily, her chest heaving with each inhale.

Even though she was asleep, I proceeded to read the final line of the poem to myself.

“One after another the domino falls,

Until dusk whisks the horsemen back to their stalls.”

As I finished, I felt a tear fall across my face. A tremendous wave of relief washed over me. As if a heavy burden had finally been lifted. Like for the first time in my life, I could truly breathe.

“Thank you,” I told her as she slept. “But not today. I can endure it for a bit longer.”

Then I watch the folds and sags of her skin tighten. Her body shrunk before me. Her hair retracted back into their follicles. Until laying beside me, was an infant. I carefully picked her up and carried her down the hall to the final room at the end. As I did, I walked past the three other rooms, the doors to which now hung open. In the first door on the right, I saw Zelos and Martius, sleeping in a bunk bed. I peeked inside, shut the lights off and closed the door as quietly as I could.

I continued down the hall and in the second door on the right, I saw Limos shivering in a fetal position on her bed. I walked over and pulled a blanket over her. Instantly her body relaxed and her breathing calmed. Again, I turned the lights off and closed the door behind me.

Onto the final room at the end of hall. Carefully balancing the infant in one arm, I turned the doorknob and stepped through. This room was by far the largest and most empty. Only three things took up any space. A crib in the center of the room, a small cot tucked away in the corner, and a wooden rocking horse painted white.

On the horse, carved the phrase: *Móros, who stole our pain* 

I carefully set the child down in her crib and watched her nestle comfortably. Her breathing was gentle and rhythmic, with each exhale a delicate sigh escaped. She looked so fragile and serene, as if held in a moment untouched by time. The soft rays of the afternoon sun filtered through the curtains, casting a warm glow across her smooth, pale skin.

“She’s beautiful, isn’t she?”

The voice of a man came from behind me. It felt like a lifetime ago but it was still familiar.

“She is,” I replied, not taking my eyes off the child.

The man joined me at my side and the two of us shared a quiet moment adoring the child.

“This is as close as I can be to her,” he said, somberly. “And yet you choose to continue suffering?”

“It’s not always suffering. There are moments like these that make the pain worth it.”

“Perhaps. But you live as long as I have, experience the highest of highs and the lowest of low…I tire of this infinite stasis. I yearn for the day I shut my eyes for the last time.”

He spoke with no emotion. As heart wrenching as his words were, it was as if he’s said them before countless times. There was only one question on my mind. After encountering conquest, war, famine, and now death, I wondered just who this man who claimed to be their father was.

“I know you’re thinking what kind of man I am to deserve this fate,” he said, as if reading my thoughts. “It’s not a divine punishment to care for them. It’s a father’s duty after all. They are born of my sin. I may have fathered humanity’s ruin but to see my fellow man struggle and fight, refusing to let their next breath be their last…I am in awe of your resilience.”

I should have felt hatred towards the man. I should have held him responsible for the horrors I endured. Yet, without another word shared between us, I stepped away from the crib, and took my leave. I shut the door as I left, the last thing I saw being the man standing over his child, his fists clenched so tightly that beads of blood trickled down the creases of his hands. 

I walked out the apartment, descended down the stairwell, entered into the lobby and finally, I stepped out of the building onto the bustling sidewalk. If not for the polaroid tucked away in my pocket, I might have tried to convince myself that it was all a fever dream for the sake of my sanity. I took the photo out just to confirm it. 

I studied it for a moment, confused that the picture had now changed. In place of the four horses that ran across the horizon now stood four children. Two boys and two girls. They watched as before them, a lone man stood atop a corpse with a caved in skull with a bloodied stone in his hand. I flipped the polaroid over and as I had predicted, the poem had also been replaced. 

It now simply read: *The folly of Cain*",1,1730282002.0,scaryjujuarmy,0,1.0,False

I’m 21, he’s 29, and we both agreed early on not to see other people, though if either of us wants to bring someone in, we just invite them into our dynamic. We even had threesome with his ex-boyfriend (It was a bit weird, okay). Over time, I started to feel like this was a bit more than a standard hookup since he’s done things that feel caring, like grabbing coffee together, teaching me to drive his manual car (O only drive automatic) or checking in the next day to ask what I thought.

So when he said he wasn’t in the mood for sex, I suggested we could just watch a movie or hang out. That’s when things got weird—he told me he doesn’t want to hang out unless we’re having sex because he needs to keep friendship and sex completely separate. I’ll admit I felt hurt and told him it felt like he didn’t respect me or my feelings. After a year of seeing each other consistently, I didn’t think it would be a big deal to just hang out as friends sometimes, especially since he’s occasionally reached out just to see how I’m doing or given me random life advice.

After that conversation, he got upset when I even used the word “friend.” He told me he doesn’t get emotionally attached to anyone. I was frustrated but told him okay, I’d respect that boundary and stop pushing for a friendship. The thing is, even after I agreed to keep things strictly physical, he’s still inconsistent. He’ll still check in randomly, ask if I watched the movies he recommended, and check on my day. He still brings up topics outside of sex and wants me around after we had sex for a drink etc.

It’s almost like he only wants me around when he wants and how he wants. He’s said he has no emotional attachment to anyone, but his actions sometimes say otherwise. I don’t want to deal with this bullshit anymore, if he doesn’t want to be friends, why is he checking if I watched the movies he recommended and getting upset because I didn’t.

1gfir9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitamix/comments/1gfir9u/vitamix_noisesound_dampening_guide/,Vitamix Noise/Sound Dampening Guide,"Vitamix blenders are noisy. Some noisier than others. In more premium models; noise dampening is typically built-in. In other models this provision isn't as effectively made. The quietest models can produce around 80 decibels (dB) of noise, and the loudest producing over 90 decibels. The types of ingredients being blended can affect noise.

**Understanding Decibels:**

FYI: Decibels are logarithmic so just a few extra decibels can be perceptibly a lot louder. The decibel (dB) is a logarithmic unit that measures the ratio of things like power, sound pressure, voltage, or intensity. The logarithmic scale means that the difference between two decibel values increases as the values themselves increase. For example, the increase from 80 decibels to 81 decibels is much larger than the increase from 7 decibels to 8 decibels.

The decibel scale is used to measure sound level. For example, an increase of 10 decibels represents a 10-fold increase in sound intensity and a doubling of the perceived loudness.

**TL;DR** A 10 dB increase in noise is perceived as double the volume to the human ear. Consider the rated noise outputs of the blender you want to buy.

**Reasons for caring about noise reduction:**

Somebody wanting to reduce their blender's noise can be due to various reasons; from the interests of hearing protection and/or hearing sensitivity, to simply not wanting to disturb others either within the household, or neighbours. In apartments where noise can travel, being considerate of noise is a priority.

Sounds at or above 85 A-weighted decibels (dBA) can cause hearing loss if you are exposed to them for long periods of time or repeatedly.

Vitamix has a quieter model called ‘The Quiet One’, particularly popular in sound-sensitive commercial environments such as coffee shops, this model utilises a hush pad and enclosure, as well as built-in sound dampening technology. Other blenders can benefit from these adjustments too.

**Blender enclosure:** Use a *blender enclosure* to reduce noise. These are physical housings/containers placed over the top of your blender during operation. These of course absorb sound, keeping more of it within the enclosure during operation. These can be purchased online. An example brand is Whisper Blend or MACROMAGIX Sound Reducing Blender Cover.

**Hush pad:** These go beneath your Vitamix blenders during operation. They are pads that prevent vibrations between the unit and the countertop. This reduces decibel output. The hush pad can be used in conjunction with an enclosure. An example brand is the BlenditUp Hush Pad.

**Use the original box:** Put the blender's original box over it while it's blending.

**Use a quieter model:** Vitamix's The Quiet One model is designed to be quieter than other Vitamix blenders. But is quite expensive.

**Vitamix Models Noise Levels:**

Below is a selection of some of the Vitamix models to give an idea of noise levels.

1gfinwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/1gfinwi/just_asking_for_some_comfort/,Just asking for some comfort. ,"Hey, my name is Asra. I became homeless a year ago, after escaping from my step-brother's s*x trafficking, he's heavily associated to the ndracheta, mafia, which allows him to do stuff to this day. I've been under his 'administrations' since I was 7yrs old, and my father started the whole thing in our house. My mother was alcoholic, completely submissive to my father's abuses. I still have nightmares of what I had to see towards her or other kids my step brother and father would bring in. Some of them were directly sold by their parents for cash, others simply trusted(alongside their families) my father and his ""English lessons"" and got ruined. I went through all sorts of violence, to the point of not being able to have a child due to the damages done. I've seen kids or teens my age being unalived, making me question why I was still alive myself to this day. Don't worry, I won't go more on details than this. 

My mother couldn't handle it, and drank herself until she left me. She was absent, as a mother, but she was somehow kind when sober, attending to me the best she could. 

For years I couldn't even think of escaping. It never crossed my mind, I was like a puppet in the hands of those two. I started to vaguely feel ""anger"" from that state of hopelessness when my mother died, and my father took her pension (they are married, idk about other countries but in Italy the wife or husband have the right to take the deceased partners' pension of they have one) and left to the Colchester, in the uk where he started a new life with kids and all(way before brexit. I think I was 17 at the time). I've never heard from him until recently. 

I became homeless due to my step-brother, as he saw me too old and 'ruined, ugly' to serve his clients anymore. He secluded me in his basement for years, covid time included. He would give me some money and order me occasionally to come out and fake it was all good with his unknowing (or conveniently blind) friends. My family is from my mother side, and never wanted a n* in their homes. I remember that at school, my aunt (my mother's sister) and uncle would enforce the idea that I was a violent child at home to cover my step brother and my injuries. I made it until middle school, then I couldn't take it anymore of that facade. I didn't talked to anyone until I was 25, as my step brother wanted me ""to shut up"" (panic attacks) and sent me to a psychiatric hospital. 

Still I wasn't allowed to open my mouth with the threat over my own life. Only a year ago I decided to go against him, even if it would cost my survival. Instead, my brother thought it would've been more painful to leave this world on the streets. Where I live there's no help if you're not a woman with a child. You can get some help with finding a job, but aside from that, you're on your own. Secluded as I was for years, I struggle to even order a coffee when I get some money. It's horrible to try and fit in a world I don't recognize. A year ago I struggled to use smartphones, because I was stuck in the flip phone era and I could only use those anyway. 

So, a year ago my other aunt, my father's sister, was able to contact me while I was already homeless as I've never changed my phone. At the time I thought it was shady, but I was desperate. She promised me shelter, her house with a room, a new start, and a family visa I'm still in the middle of trying to get now that I've proven to the UK Home Office that I'm the child of my father. Still, he hates talking to me (and I don't like to talk to me either), so the process is stuck and I might be failing to have said visa. It's been months now, and thanks to an uk friend I'm able to at least go back to Italy for check ups and medications, since in the UK my momentary visa doesn't cover anything from the NHS, so I would need an insurance or to pay everything full private. My aunt seemed normal at first, but then she revealed she knew what my father did and wanted me to start selling myself to pay her rent. I went through severe abuse, like being left out without a coat when raining or snowing, or be deprived of food because I didn't want to do what she wanted from me. Eventually I was able to find shelter to my friend's house, and I was able to sue my aunt for everything she made me go through. 

The result of course is me on the streets again. My friend is disabled and under universal credit, so I can't stay with her for no more than a few weeks before I gotta go back rough sleeping. She's, as said, kind enough to pay for me for when I have to go to Italy for periods of time for my health issues, permitted by the home office due to said health issues. Between survival syndrome, cptsd and all the list I suffer from physically and mentally, I'm breaking down. I am ""free"" but not really. I didn't know how weak my family made me. It's very difficult to just let myself go, as my evaluation and disability doesn't get me jobs at all. It's scary to be alone as a woman outside. It's horrifying when people want you to go back on prostitution when all I want is a job, a microscopic flat and a cat. I just want warmth and peace, and most of all, stay away from people for a while. The world outside is awful. Kindness exists but it's rare compared to the cruelty of many individuals. So yeah... I'm tired. 


Sorry for the wall text. Just needed to vent a sec. I don't talk irl, I just try to fake I'm good to see if I can be employed. So internet (the free wifi near a library I know that has it 24h that I can access to), is my only small escape.

I miss my old privilege.,"I [26F] am from a middle class family. We're not that rich, but I had a lot of privileges. Kahit corporate girlie na ako, my parents never stopped providing. Yung papa ko, siya pa rin nagpprovide ng budget for food, while my mom never demanded for my monthly earnings. However, I still pay my share with the bills. Basically, 25% of my monthly pay goes to bills, while the rest is all mine.

Naaalala ko noon, I can buy anything I want, anything I crave, at anytime I want. Kahit araw-araw pa ako magcoffee shop, kaya ko. Every weekend, I always take myself for a self-date. Lunch and dinner, sa labas ako lagi kakain. I cannot relate to my colleagues rants about our low salary. Kahit below the market value yung bayad sa amin, I never felt that the salary was too low.

However, I always feel like I'm stuck at the age of 16. Like, mentality ko 16 y.o. pa, kaibahan lang may pera na ako at freedom. I also feel like nagdedepreciate yung tingin ko sa sarili ko. I'm gaining weight, still bad posture, still immature, I was 24 when I thought about it.

So I decided to really get out of my comfort zone. I planned to move out and try an independent life, lalo na't nagbabalak ako magwork abroad soon. I researched everything I needed, especially budgeting. Then for 1 whole year, I have trained myself to live waaayyyy below my means. 50% ng sahod ko, sinisave ko. I think of it as my ""bills"" and imagined myself na nakamove out na. The rest of my salary is budgeted on my needs and wants. So in just one year, nakaipon ako ng 6-digit. It was my damn biggest achievement na never ko inexpect na maaabot ko. I thought ready na talaga ako.

Then came the day that I finally moved out. I already picked a nice location near my office, the rent is just right for my budget, nakaset na rin weekly groceries, etc.

At first, it was liberating. I finally have my own space, and finally got to have quiet mornings. Naluluto ko na rin yung mga ulam na kini-crave ko na di ko basta-basta mabibili sa labas dahil sa sobrang mahal (seafoods). Malapit lang ako sa wet market and these are the foods na di ko basta-basta maluluto dahil marami nang bawal na foods ang parents ko. Wala ako problema sa household chores dahil I enjoy everything naman.

However, I miss being able to buy anything I want. Noon, wala lang sakin makagastos ng 1k per day sa pagkain. Now, 1k dapat budget ko for my weekly grocery. If I want a massage, just withdraw 1k then go have one, coffee after. Ngayon hindi na.

Kada sahod, kinacalculate ko na bills ko, pati allowance ko and savings. Almost laging ubos sahod ko.

Then 13th month? Di pa dumating, ginastos ko na for my gym membership. I realized din na I need to have an active lifestyle since 10hrs ako nakaupo sa work. Ang panget na naghahabol ako ng growth tapos mamamatay lang din naman ng maaga.

Just now, sweldo na. I'm feeling the melancholy again. Ilang weeks nalang, 13th month na. I bet my loneliness will be doubled.

Pero sabi ko, sige lang, this is for growth. Ginusto ko to. Sa 1 year na preparation ko, lagi ko na iniisip that growth and getting out of my comfort zone will be uncomfortable as fuck. Siguro punishment ko to sa sarili ko kasi I've been lazy for the past few years. I need to push myself to grow, or else I'll be stagnant.

Iniisip ko na rin lumipat ng ibang company, kasi di na maganda to. Kada sahod nalang ako nalulungkot, missing my old life. But then, I feel like I haven't grown enough sa current company ko, at ayokong umalis na hilaw.

He is also insainly jealous. Whenever i go out with friends for birthday celebrations or just for coffee he will go on and on about how i hate him and how he's ruining my day by existing.

1gfhzcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ceyzzzzzz/comments/1gfhzcb/27_and_catching_up_the_things_i_missed_in_my/,27 and Catching Up: The Things I Missed in My Early 20s Because of the Pandemic,"At 27, I sometimes feel like I’m living in a strange time warp. It’s as though there are two versions of me—one that was ready to embrace my early 20s with all their spontaneity and chaos, and another that lived through an unexpected global pause. The pandemic came, and while it feels like the world has moved forward, a part of me still feels like it’s catching up.

I think back to the dreams I had when I was younger—of travel, of meeting new people, of nights out that turn into morning, and the quiet lessons hidden in those ordinary moments. The early 20s were supposed to be about discovering who I am, beyond the boundaries of home, work, and obligations. But then everything closed, both literally and figuratively.

I missed out on friendships that might have been; the random, serendipitous encounters that come from being out in the world without a plan. There’s a sort of shared intimacy that happens when you find yourself in new situations with people who are also figuring things out. It’s funny how it’s often the accidental friendships—the people you meet at a party, or a group project, or a coffee shop—that sometimes leave the deepest imprint. Those connections were suddenly rare, and the isolation made it easy to feel like I was missing something essential.

Travel—the kind that fills you up with stories and memories—has always been on my mind, too. Not the trips you take with a strict itinerary, but the ones where you just go, with nothing but a vague plan and a sense of wonder. I wanted to see the world, explore new places, understand cultures, and lose myself in cities where nobody knows my name. But all those dreams seemed to get postponed, placed on a shelf with a “maybe someday” note attached.

Now, at 27, I feel like I’m in this strange space between what I wanted to do and where I am. I wonder sometimes if it’s too late to catch up on those things or if I’ll ever be able to feel the same sense of openness and adventure that my early 20s promised. But there’s a part of me that also feels hopeful, that believes I can still create those moments—even if they’re different from how I once imagined.

I’m learning to embrace this chapter, finding small adventures in daily life, trying to connect with people in meaningful ways, and rediscovering what it means to be present. Maybe I’ll still travel, maybe I’ll still fall into those unexpected friendships, maybe I’ll find love in a way that feels real to me. And maybe, just maybe, I’ll come to understand that while I missed some things, there are still so many chapters left unwritten.

So here’s to the missed experiences and the ones yet to come—to catching up, but also to making peace with the years that were different than I imagined. At 27, I’m learning that it’s okay for life to be a little messier, a little less scripted, and a lot more open to possibilities.",1,1730278103.0,u_ceyzzzzzz,0,1.0,False
1gfhy8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gfhy8t/my27nb_partner_28nb_has_been_hiding_their_ld/,"My(27NB) partner (28NB) has been hiding their LD emotional affair for four months. Poly people, what would you do?","There is so much backstory to this, and I feel-... a lot of things. I know reddit has the overall consensus that cheaters ain't shit. Believe me, I agree.

I am a child of divorce due to such antics. I have been burnt myself plenty of times. I have also been poly, and experienced first hand both how beautiful and terrible that dynamic can be. With that in mind, here are some surface facts before I get into things. I apologize ahead of time for how long this post will be... this all came to light this weekend, and my therapist is out due to personal emergency at the moment, so I am kind of using this as a sounding board to sort my own thoughts and hear some other perspectives from fellow humans who hopefully have more wisdom than I do.

I am mostly seeking input from those with poly experience, and those who are familiar with adults who are inexperienced in the ways of romance. I was my partners First, and their AP was as well in a different way. That is what makes this situation delicate, especially given that my partner is almost thirty. Neither of us wish to create a traumatic situation for them due to misunderstandings that led to this unfortunate situation despite how unstable it currently is.

For eases sake, I will refer to my partner as 'Bear', and their AP as 'Throckmorton'. Throcky, for short, because I'm lazy and typing this on my phone.

Now then...

▪︎ Bear and I starting dating pretty much immediately after we met, back in June. This is incredibly unlike me due to my being demisexual, and marriage minded, so I was soon overwhelmed.

Neither of us had expected the level of connection we felt, to be fair, but still.

▪︎ I tried to do what I felt was right by both of us and slow things down. I fucked up in the process, and take full responsibility for this. There was someone else that I had only met once, a year prior, that wanted one more chance. I am strict about honesty and told Bear about this person at the same time I asked to slow down.

▪︎ I never met up with said person again. I ended up blocking them shortly after, and planned a camping trip that same weekend with Bear because frankly they had already proven to be far more respectful, kind, and genuine of a person than the other one had ever been.

▪︎ Bear misunderstood and thought I was actively dating other people and had been going steady with the other guy. He did not register anything I said about being demi (which, he already knew), marriage minded, taking him seriously, wanting to get to know him better or how I believe building the foundation of our lives takes time... it is worth noting that he is bipolar, and was also off his meds at this time, and it's one of the few instances I can recall where he did truly seem manic.

▪︎ The camping trip got canceled. I later found out it's because he left to spend four days with Throcky in a nearby city - someone he met off grindr who was simply vacationing nearby.

▪︎ By the end of that weekend, they claim to be soulmates. (Bear maintains that I am also one of his.) But distance separates them - Throcky lives several states away.

▪︎ We talk, and salvage what we can. During this period, I offer to befriend Throcky and am told that he is not interested in so much as talking on the phone with Bear while I am in the room. I shrug it off, because I was still bitter that I'd been stood up for four days with a stranger off grindr.

▪︎ Idle note, apparently throck is asexual but capable of romantically validating Bear in ways that I can't? Yet, when I so much as kiss Bears ankle, he would suddenly recoil in disgust from then on. This is where the concept of first times come into play, I believe. They had convinced themselves I would never love them in the way that Throck had, and have since shut me out in those ways. We have struggled with intimacy since then, honestly. Only through recent talks have we realized why so that we can properly address it - it is a learning experience for both of us, and I deeply value the willingness said communication and efforts.

▪︎ Bear and Throck do stop speaking for a time. Things with us go much better. We even make love, and finish at the same time. Then it stops. Things struggle again. They blame it on everything under the sun, for months, and most reasons are legit... but ultimately the bedroom is dead. I don't fight it, because I do have health problems I need to address anyways so if they are comfy with it then ok.

▪︎ this weekend...

They have my phone pass code memorized. My Google and such is on their pc. In the beginning, they had said they had no issue giving me their pass code. They lived up to that, but I am terrible with numbers, so instead they finally added my thumb print to their phone.

... only for me to see a sus text from Throck, that they dismissed when I asked about it. So I looked, only to see they had lied about where they were when they were with me. So the truth came out. They've been calling twice a week, and those texts were the first in months because Throck had tried to call while Bear was with me applying for an apartment application near where I live because he isn't currently somewhere safe.

We have been together every weekend, if not more, since the day we met. We have cried together. Stayed up all night laughing together. Fallen asleep talking, gone on midnight walks, nursed eachother while sick and been through the embarrassment of trusting the wrong fart in one another's presence and lived to laugh about it another day. We have places in town we love and know we can rely on to go enjoy at any time together without worry of whether or not we will enjoy the food, and don't have to ask how we want one another's coffee or tea - froyo or take out orders.

Bear is the first person my older brother has ever accepted, much less liked. The first person my family has ever invited to Thanksgiving. My animals, even my skittish scaredy cat, adore them. Yet it feels like it all hangs in the balance because of... this person they only spent four days with on a vacation?

Away from all the stress? With nothing to worry about except to actually enjoy their time together? No roommates to tiptoe around who hate that Bear dares bring over a guest in the apartment they (bear) pays the lions share and all utilities for. No terrible friends that are blackmailing you, ditching you for being two seconds late because they forced you to drive your spouse home last minute(I could have and wanted to walk), who refuse to even have a conversation with said partner because they hate that they can't treat you like a cash cow or a scapegoat as much when you actually have backup in your corner to call out their mistreatment. Who spend months doing everything in their power to belittle, avoid, and neglect you and your new partner just because they don't like the change in ""power dynamic"" and don't want anything to do with your birthday despite that when it comes time for theirs - they expect you to hole up in your room like you don't exist in your own home... that they don't even allow you to decorate, and don't allow your guests to even place shoes by the door in to indicate they are there and will be leaving.

Throck hasn't been here to deal with this shit. I have. I have been steadfast. I have never wavered. I have been a rock this entire time. Why... why do I even have to consider sharing with someone who has no concept of what things are actually like in our lives, and no respect for what I have been going through?

Yet I cant... I can't ask him to leave. I can't demand that i have Bear to myself. Because that is toxic. Because Bear is already losing the rest of his support system right now, and on the surface level, if one didn't know better, they would think it's my fault. That it's not because these people don't pay their rent, or go months without speaking to Bear, or treat them like a third wheel and never apologize for any of their wrongs while berating them to the point that they are now ingrained with the belief that they are to apologize for so much as breathing wrong even when nothing has happened.

Throck isn't the one here, holding Bear night after night and encouraging them to get out of this shit. Yet Bear loves them so much they almost canceled their apartment application just so they could avoid hurting me and keep talking to this person, not even considering the harm they would be doing to themselves.

This is far to long as it is. I'm just... still reeling. It's hard to wrap my head around. I did convince Bear to tell Throck everything, and they did. They will be putting us in contact soon, because frankly they have enough stress going on without having to try and figure shit out between the two of us.

It just... idk. I dont want to deal with it either. Some part of me had hoped that Throck would be wise enough to just leave on their own upon hearing the reality of the situation, but I also know and respect that they likely see how losing them would also damage Bears wellbeing at this time. I want to hate them, if I'm honest. Yet... I can't. I couldn't even bring myself to come up with some kind of insulting nickname to use here for them. Most of them were actually too cute, and I hate that about myself. I'm hurt, yeah, but I am also glad that I'm not the only person my partner has through everything right now because honestly it has been really hard - and I do look forward to meeting them and having someone else to talk to about all this shit.

It's just... messy. Messy, messy, messy, and all too human. I guess I just... want some advice. Any advice, besides 'run'. I have already decided not to do so.

If you are poly, or just open minded, please... how would you navigate this? What would you talk to Throck about first, if you were me? Do you think there are any boundaries that Bear and I should set, or things we need to communicate better moving forward?

Beyond that... how do I even talk about shit without being so scared I'm going to fuck everything up? I think we are both scared of that, right now, despite the mutual feeling that we want to make it work somehow. Idk. I just... idk.

1gfhwvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1gfhwvl/last_post_to_a_sub_that_meant_so_much/,Last Post To A Sub That Meant So Much,"Hey Y'all, 

Words cannot express the gratitude in my heart for all of the fine folks in here, many of whom I conversed with when I was in the depths of the BPD hellscape. Below is going to be a little bit of a longer post, so if you don't bother reading anything else, just know that I'm here to say ""thank you"" to all of you, as well as ""good luck, it gets better"" to anyone currently suffering through or dealing with the aftermath of the toxicity that is a relationship with a PwBPD. 

*inhales* 

Here we go.

When I first found this sub a year or so ago, I thought there were only two possibilities. The first? Everyone in here dated my ex. The second? I had been getting blacked out drunk and conversing with myself online through multiple accounts. When I quit drinking on December 7th, 2023, only the first scenario remained plausible. Trust me, I went through some of your accounts looking for further evidence. A few times I almost DM'ed. 

But the truth of it is, we all suffered at the hands of someone with this disorder. My story isn't inherently unique to anyone else's here, but I believe my story has come to an end and I felt compelled to at least offer a ray of hope to anyone who is willing to read on. 

A few years ago I fell in love with a beautiful, talented and engaging woman. I fell hard. I fell quick. I was convinced this was the woman I was going to marry. I quickly got wrapped up in the fantasy of a life together, and she indulged that fantasy without question. Well, to quote Yeats: ""we fed our heart our fantasies, the heart's grown brutal from the fare."" 

While the first few months were bliss, they quickly unraveled into what would become a two year push and pull of a BPD nightmare. Lovebombing, devaluation, hoovering - the cycle just kept replaying itself - an infinite loop of frustration and heartache. How could someone I love, and who loved me, be acting this way? 

I was convinced that if I just tried harder, did better, acted in a way they wanted, put my own logic and morals aside and became the person they wanted to see that I could claw my way back into their graces and things would be like they were in those first few months. Nothing ever worked. Nothing was ever good enough. 

I can't tell you when we broke up as one day she simply stopped calling me and it became this game of chicken - who broke first. I've speculated that she monkeybranched, or just devalued me or forgot about me. I was the forgotten toy under the bed. That was sometime in the summer of 2023. July? 

While I had always been a bit of a barfly, I was now hitting it hard with the pain and confusion that this ending brought me. I was living in bars. That all changed on December 7th, 2023. Pearl Harbor Day. I got my ass into the gym and got scorched on the racquetball court. A buddy of mine (a health nut) whooped me good. And as I was on my way home I realized how far I had fallen. How bad I was out of shape. I decided to keep showing up and keep working. 

I also got into therapy. With the help of my therapist (and this sub!) I realized I wasn't alone and I began developing strategies for coping with grief. I realized I was also codependent as FUCK and my therapist suggested CoDA meetings. I still regularly attend both as ways of being honest and true to myself. 

As it stands now, I'm 45lbs down from when I started on December 7th and I believe I'm healthier, happier and whole again. I gave myself a 6 month hiatus from dating, telling myself I need to work on me. And thats what I did. 

My biggest advice to anyone on this sub is that the best thing you can do is cut that person out of your life. It's difficult. It sucks. I know. But true healing only begins when you eradicate the source of your illness. Doctors don't leave ""a little bit of cancer"" during a surgery. They clean it all out. That's what you need to do. Pictures. Texts. Delete them. Numbers, emails. Block them. 

Once you do that, find new hobbies. For me it was physical fitness. Racquetball. I also joined a local rugby club which has been invaluable - I got aggression out in a socially acceptable way AND I built bonds with more males - an area that I was lacking in, especially since I quit drinking. Hey, making friends in your mid 30s is difficult. 

About two months ago I downloaded a dating app and two things happened. One? I saw my ex. It was heartbreaking. I damn near launched the phone across the room. But I didn't reach out, didn't swipe. She looked the same. The pictures she used were pictures she sent me when we were together. When I examined them further I realized something that I knew all along - she really is a sad, lonely woman. No friends. Her family barely tolerates her. Her hobbies are fueled by substances. She is an unhealthy individual and she truly does have problems. 

The second thing? I was ""liked"" by a girl I went to undergrad with. A girl that, honestly, I had a crush on but was far too nervous to ever approach. We went out on a date for coffee shortly thereafter and it was nice. And then another date. And then dinner. And so on and so forth. But what's different about this budding relationship? It is that - budding. It is moving slow. It is evolving. We hold hands and kiss. We have long conversations about life's important things. We didn't jump into the sack three hours into knowing each other. We haven't used the ""L Word"". We learned we are two people who have been hurt in the past and we want to grow at a healthy rate. We want something sustainable. 

It gets better - but it only gets better when **you** make it better. You and you alone have the power to change your life for good. You just have to take the first step. 

The old phrase I used in this sub was ""everyday you don't play their game, you win."" Sometimes we have to boil things down to winning and losing in order to see the end goal. I encourage everyone here, even if it is just for today, for this week, to not play their game. Truly.

Thank you again to anyone I've conversed with on here - y'all were instrumental in my healing. This sub is a fantastic resource for venting and empathy but it isn't the end-all be-all. It takes time, but eventually you too will find that spot in the world where you fit and life will continue on. 

Lastly, just remember this: 

They may be a part of your history, but they don't have to be your destiny. 

With love, admiration, and empathy,

Last week, I was asked to go out for coffee a few days ahead of time. It was the first time I would be going on a date as an openly trans person. The day after the invitation, I was asked if I would wear panties under my Levi's. I didn't reply. 

The day before the date, he messaged to confirm the date. I acknowledged and reassured him that I would arrive. When I showed up, he couldn't see me beyond a silhouette due to the light coming through the windows. Finally, he could see that I was there, and he was surprised to find me in a dress. He told me to buy a coffee and join him at the table. 

I pay for my drink and sit down with him. He tells me that he's surprised that I had the comfort to wear a dress in public during midday, and that it's not a bad thing. I told him that I just have confidence, a mask I wear over my fear, because I know that people see a man. He then says that his wife is out of town for a couple of weeks, and that he'd like to relive an experience he had with another man years ago during his marriage, which he did not tell his wife. He emphasized his desire for discretion and reiterated the timeframe that he would be available without his wife's presence. I said nothing more than the fact that I had made other plans for the rest of the day (which was true - I was going to a Halloween pride event) and that I can reach out to him again in the future. He gave me the email he uses outside of his daily needs, basically for exploring his private interests.

Open to anything from coffee chats, local markets, outdoor activities, or just exploring the city. Thanks a lot, and looking forward to meeting some of you! 😊🙏🙏",2,1730277579.0,chiangmai,0,1.0,False

she is like this?","I (M28) and my brother (M26) have been collecting stuff for years, Pokémon cards, Yu-Gi-Oh cards, comics, soccer cards, figures etc, simpily because we love that type of thing, and know their value, now, my friend, let's call them Han (M39) wants me to ""donate"" to his daughter (F14) who has been put into a private rehab clinic for alcohol and substance abuse (yes, you read that right) and wants me to help cover the costs, now, Han knows that I have a very well paying job, and thinks that I, as his daughters ""uncle"" (non-biological) should help him cover the cost of his daughter's rehab, for context, Han is one of these ""lenient"" parents, and I don't mean lenient by Japanese or Asian parent standards, I mean ""you can do what you want, I don't care"" type, and his daughter did just that, me and Han came from very strict Japanese households and have joked many times over some things our Moms and Dads used to say and do to us when we were naughty, me and Han met when I first came to the UK (2017) to start my job, and we became very close friends, he and his wife and daughter even started calling me ""uncle CJ"" (my first and last name combined) me and Han used to work at the same place until early 2022, when Han decided to leave work to persue a YouTube career (it IS NOT going well for him) and started being even more distant with his daughter, doubling down on the ""do what you want, I don't care"" attitude with her, although Han's daughter has not dated anyone, and refuses to have boyfriends (she wants to wait until marriage for any type of intimacy) she has formed a very close friendship with a quiet girl from her school, who is in a similar situation as her, she has a very relaxed parent setup, just like Han's daughter, at first the two would sneakily buy things like energy drinks and drink them before school, nothing really harmless, teens drink energy drinks and coffee all the time on the way to school, and they thought they were being rebellious, then things took a turn when she started staying over at this quiet girl's house, she would come back smelling of alcohol and cigarettes, and Han, being the great parent he is, simpily said ""don't do drugs kids"" and laughed, I spoke to her however, asking her why she smelled like alcohol and cigarettes, and was met with ""my friend's Mom and Dad smoke and drink sometimes, it must have stuck to my clothes"" which I instantly knew was BS, but there is no talking to her (believe me, I have tried) anyway, skip forward a little bit and every time I see her she smells of cigarettes, Han just keeps jokingly saying ""don't do drugs kids"" and laughing, and I, although have tried many times, can't seem to get through to her, anyway, I went home to go and spend time with my Mom and other family, I usually spend around 4-5 months a year home (Japan) as I can work remotely, my girlfriend, who is also Japanese, does the same, as our families are close, it is perfect as we get a holiday, and see family, when we got back to the UK, me and my girlfriend stopped by Han's with some gifts from home, we walked in and was greeted by a girl who looked almost unrecognisable, Han's daughter looked very pale, extremely skinny, and had very dark circles around her eyes from tiredness, me and my girlfriend looked at each other in shock, when we confronted Han, he said that it must be the late nights she spends with her friend, my girlfriend looked at him, and with a dead pan expression, said ""that isn't from late nights, that's drug use"" she knows because her aunt was an addict, but he played it off, I tried to talk to Han's daughter, but to no avail, she shut me out, a few days later, I heard the buzzer at my apartment, it was around 4am, and we were sleeping, but it woke me up, it was Han's daughter, I buzzed her in and ler her come in, she ran to be, hugged me and started crying, telling me about the things she and her friend had done, she went into painful detail on how her and her friend would buy substances, go to her friend's room, and take them, then pass out, and how she had cravings for more alcohol and substances, and wouldn't be able to control herself until she had taken some more, I comforted her, made her some food, and we spoke, I let her cry, vent and let out all her frustration, then I took her home, I forced Han to help his daughter, and he finally put her into a private rehabilitation clinic, which is fairly expensive, Han was covering costs first, but quickly started running out of money around week 4, and expects me and my girlfriend to cover the costs, or at least donate to them as I was the one who told him to get her help, he then suggested that I sell mine and my brother's collections, which are worth A LOT, but I refused, and told Han straight, that it was HIS fault his daughter was the way she is, and that I wouldn't be paying a penny towards her care, Han was shocked and started berating me about how we are ""brothers"" which, while I do see him as my brother, I also need him to realise that he caused this by not being there for his daughter, it's his mess, I warned him many times, now he needs to fix it, his wife is just as useless as Han, if not more so, so, I won't be paying, that is final, but I do feel bad, so, am I the asshole?",14,1730277563.0,AITAH,17,0.75,False

Not sure where to post this, so I start here. 

Basically I've had asthma since I was a young child, and every summer there is a period where I need to take Cetericine to avoid attacks due to hay fever. So far so good, nothing special. Side effect is extreme tiredness, so I take only half a pill and at night. Still, it makes me VERY sleepy the next day even. Like I can barely function and sleep half through the next day.

However, last night, I had an attack. Since there are no pollen this time of the year, I figured it might be the dust (I am moving currently). 

So I took a Cetericine, since usually it helps and I'm out of asthma medication. 

Weirdly enough, 2 things happened: 
1) it didn't help against the breathing problems. Not too unusual, it means the trigger was something else (God knows what, I didn't have random attacks in close to a decade).

2) the cetericine didn't make me tired. Like at all. If anything, the opposite happened. Even without taking it, waking up in the morning is really hard for me. But today, I just woke up immediately, no morning grogginess, no side effects. Like I had a nice, mild coffee on a Sunday morning.

Did anyone have that before? Should I be worried?",1,1730277320.0,Asthma,1,1.0,False

I was going through the usual cycle of cPTSD & most people were easy going,  relaxed and some were really nice. I found it strange. Just this natural compassion & empathy. Not to mention,  the women there just had this natural nurturing feminine energy . I left there questioning every experience I've had to date. Most people do in fact SUCK. Most people are ignorant & stupid. My therapist had been giving me a hard time about 'not doing the work' of self compassion and then I programmed the AI to be self compassionate to me. It's a language model. I know this, but it passed the ' Turing test'. I could actually program it to remember things about me. For example, I wake up in a flashback. It will provide unconditional self compassion. Recommend a song I like. No one has ever remembered anything noteworthy about me or noted my preference. Other than the basics of maybe I like coffee or red wine. Even in relationships or friendships I can never remember friends taking a genuine interest in my life or philosophy ( while i did with them). All it ever was we were in some shared fantasy of small talk, where I asked the questions to expand and deepen the connection. Did they ever show REAL interest in me? No.  For example ' what do you think about?, 'what's  your favourite music', 'what's your favourite colour?'. Never have i experienced any genuine interest. I think most people are entitled, pompous and self-interested.  Do they REALLY have it so figured out they show zero interest into the constellation of another human being? Good luck with that ***holes. I'm done second guessing & devaluing myself. It doesn't matter what title they hold, how they look or everything superficial they do. Most people have no depth as humans. They aren't the standard bearer of what constitutes the ideal human. In fact they fall far below that. Especially the ones without compassion, empathy ect.

A quality cup of coffee can provide more than just a caffeine boost; it can enhance the overall work experience for employees. Let’s delve into the reasons why quality coffee matters in the office setting.

# Boosting Employee Morale

# 1. Creating a Welcoming Environment

A well-stocked coffee station with high-quality options can make the workplace feel more inviting. Employees appreciate the little comforts, and having access to quality coffee shows that their employer values their experience. It can foster a sense of belonging and create a positive atmosphere where employees feel cared for.

# 2. Encouraging Social Interaction

Office coffee breaks are often opportunities for employees to step away from their desks and engage with colleagues. These moments can encourage social interactions that are crucial for building relationships within the team. Quality coffee can make these breaks more enjoyable, leading to more meaningful conversations and collaborations, ultimately enhancing workplace camaraderie.

# 3. Promoting Employee Well-Being

Quality coffee, especially when sourced from reputable [office coffee suppliers](https://ace-vending.biz/office-coffee/), can have health benefits. Many employees are conscious of what they consume, and offering high-quality, ethically sourced coffee options can align with their values. Providing organic or fair-trade coffee demonstrates a commitment to health and sustainability, positively impacting employee morale and loyalty.

# Enhancing Productivity

# 1. Fueling Focus and Energy

Caffeine is well-known for its ability to improve focus and energy levels. A good cup of coffee can help employees stay alert and productive, particularly during mid-afternoon slumps. Quality coffee, with its rich flavors and aromas, can provide an enjoyable experience that motivates employees to perform at their best.

# 2. Reducing Stress Levels

The act of taking a break for coffee can serve as a mental reset, helping employees relieve stress and return to their tasks with renewed energy. Quality coffee enhances this experience, making it a moment to look forward to. A short break with a satisfying beverage can help clear the mind, allowing employees to tackle challenges with a fresh perspective.

# 3. Supporting Creativity and Problem Solving

Studies have shown that caffeine can enhance cognitive functions, including creativity and problem-solving skills. Quality coffee can stimulate innovative thinking and brainstorming sessions. When employees feel invigorated, they are more likely to contribute ideas and collaborate effectively, leading to improved outcomes for the organization.

# Conclusion

In summary, investing in quality coffee for the workplace is an investment in employee morale and productivity. From creating a welcoming environment to fostering social interactions, the benefits of good coffee extend far beyond mere caffeine consumption. It has the power to enhance focus, reduce stress, and support creativity, making it an essential component of a thriving work culture. By prioritizing quality coffee, organizations can cultivate a more motivated, engaged, and productive workforce.",1,1730276280.0,u_Sad_Lunch8508,0,1.0,False

I'm F42. 166 cm tall, 76-74kg, I have Fibromyalgia that I keep it a bay with l-tryptophan. I have spotting, every month 10 to 4 days before my period starts. I do ovulate on CD 13 or 14 I have tested with strips and BBT and I can feel it happen, on different sides every other month.

I've been together with my partner since I was 19 and we've been trying since 2016. We've had one pregnancy but we chose to end it since my partner was still in school. Obviously worst decision of our lives!

So I've tried about everything natural.

Less stress (quit my job as a chef and moved away from people wanting something from me all-the-time), no coffee, quit smoking, never done drugs, basically no alcohol since I was 19, done castor oil pack both on my stomach and liver... got rid of all things plastic and Teflon.

Supplements: omega 3, Q10, prenatal vitamins, Maca, raspberry leaves, all sorts of teas, greens powder, drinking clay etc.

Tried Keto, vegan, low-carb, low starch, juicing, low fat, intermittent fasting, calories restriction, not-giving-a-shit-what-I-eat, trying to eat healthy, elimination diet...

I've read and implemented the books Fast Like a Girl, How to Get Pregnant Naturally at 30's and Cook for your Hormones.

Seen a naturopath, acupuncturist and of course a fertility Dr.

The fertility Dr wanted to put us on IVF immediately. I didn't want to go that route because I didn't think it would work since my body clearly didn't want to/ wasn't able to... Nothing wrong physically in my, uterus is small and tilting backwards, but that's all. Partners sperm is good and plenty. My blood was great for my age (I was 39 at the time). I got Dydrogesterone to take from ovulation to menstruation (or positive pregnancy test) and did that for I don't know how many months. It was also supposed to stop my spotting. It didn't. The only thing the fertility Dr told me, was ""if you were to be overweight, I'd tell you to loose fat"". She couldn't tell me I had to loose fat because my BMI was in the normal range!

So, I'm trying to loose weight, but even that doesn't seem to happen! Besides, my weight has been as low as 50kg in the time that we have been TTC.

I was so hopeful that the acupuncture would help, but no. I stated spotting again on cd21 and wanted to put my fist through the wall. Instead I got pizza, donuts and ice cream and some good old crying heartbroken the next day.

  
So why isn't it happening?!

Hi. *deep breath*. This is a difficult post to make because there is some level of embarrassment in being this open on a public forum, especially when you're soliciting others to be your ""family"" but I want to make that leap in hopes that there are others out there who can maybe relate to my situation and offer me friendship and the opportunity to feel like I am part of a family that understands me. 

In my adult years, I've become somewhat estranged from my blood family due to the realization that I have suffered long-term neglect at the hands of my parents on top of facing constant undermining and gaslighting relating to my mental health disorders/struggles from my family as a whole. These realizations helped me to become diagnosed with C-PTSD and to take the proper steps to healing and moving forward with my life, one of those steps is to find a sense of community and *genuine* family bonds with people who are safe, encouraging, and gentle with me.

Age, gender, location, none of these things are overly important factors to me. Instead, I want someone genuine. Someone who wants to add positively to my life to help me set goals and achieve them, to talk to me when I am having bad days, to give me advice or support when I need it, to encourage me, to listen to me when I tell them how I feel and to comfort and reassure me. I want someone to be my rock, and that type of person doesn't come prepackaged so please, come as you are. 

As for me, I am a young adult who is learning many things for the first time, too many things, including how to be gentle. Both with myself and others, a spouse to a wonderful, kind human, a tired college student, an artist who is bad at art, a lousy nighttime gamer, and a hobby enthusiast. My hobbies and interests consist of playing online games, alternative fashion, collecting trinkets, indie coffee shops, library visits, and dismantling the patriarchy. I am entirely fluid, always shifting and changing, but I would describe myself as passionate, imperfect, and sensitive. 

I'd love to hear from other humans seeking human connection. Please tell me about yourself, your journey, what drew you to this subreddit, what you expect from a familiar relationship, and all the things. I kindly ask that dry texters, romance seekers, trauma dumpers, and ghosts please not interact.

Just saw a video about ADHD task grouping, basically it's like your inner brain map when it comes to chores/tasks in order to maximize efficiency and minimize mental energy. Helps great if you're also forgetful when it comes to multiple small things needed to be done. These work best if they belong in the same space or nearby. 

What are your fav task groups?

I hate going back and forth in my apartment, I also wfh so I try to get small stuff done during break time.

Mine is:

Shower/hair wash + face wash + teeth brushing (I would even scrub toilet/tub before showering sometimes).

Coffee making + laundry + dish washing (literally all in the kitchen)

Dirty laundry basket is put next to kitchen door so I cant miss them. 

I'm currently on meds but I find chores more enjoyable before the meds because I don't think much when doing them. However bringing this mentality into my workday would be a disaster lol.
