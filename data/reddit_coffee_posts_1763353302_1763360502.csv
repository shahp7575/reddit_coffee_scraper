I don’t usually make posts like this, but I’m really hoping to meet some new people around my age (17–22)!

I’m from Ireland! I love music and concerts, and I play guitar. I’m pretty shy at first, but I swear I warm up quickly once I’m comfortable! I’m way more of a TV series person than a movie person, but my boyfriend (19M) has been showing me all his favourites so I’m slowly getting into movies too!

I’d honestly just love a couple of new people to chat with :) just nice conversations, sharing music and experiences , talking about random life things, all that good stuff. And if you’re in Ireland, I’d be happy to hang out or grab a coffee sometime!

I remember the exact moment. 3:17 AM, floor of my tiny apartment, cold coffee forgotten on the table. My phone screen glowed with $97.43. Rent due in three days. I’d just shut down another dead-end Shopify store—$1,200 vanished in ads, not a single sale. Before that, print-on-demand dragged on for six weeks and netted $64. Amazon FBA? $3,100 in fees for a warehouse full of dust. I was out of moves, out of cash, and staring down the barrel of going back to a job I hated.
A few months before, I’d scraped together enough for a cheap flight to China—just to get out of my head. Wandered into Shenzhen’s electronics markets, those endless rows of stalls buzzing with deals. That’s when I stumbled on it: a product that looked too good, felt too real. The seller handed me a sample. I tested it right there—plugged into my phone, pop-up animation flawless, noise cancel that cut through the market chaos, sound that tracked my head turns. Serial checked out clean, full coverage. I bought one to bring home, spent nights tearing it apart, comparing every detail. It was 1:1 quality, no question. And the price? $10 a unit straight from the source. The idea hit like a brick: Buy 100, flip locally. Simple. Low risk. Real math.
Back home, with $97 staring me down, I finally bet on it. Wired $1,000—my last dollar, plus $400 from my sister (who believed in me when I didn’t). Hands shaking, I hit send. Didn’t sleep for days, refreshing tracking like my life depended on it. When the box arrived, I ripped it open. Tested the first unit. Perfect. No issues.
Posted one basic listing that afternoon: “Lightly used, need cash fast—$49 meetup.” First reply in 11 minutes. By night, nine gone, $441 in my pocket. The messages kept coming—WhatsApp groups, campus chats, IG DMs. A week later, the full 100 sold out. That $1,000 became $3,900 profit. A month in, $12,000. Ninety days? $47,000. Now I’ve got a small spot in Shenzhen, suppliers who text me first, and coffee that doesn’t taste like regret.
I don’t need another $42 from you. I’ve built enough to chase bigger things—AI for supply chains, maybe my own line. But I haven’t forgotten that $97.43 glow, the knot in your stomach when everything’s on the line. The endless guessing, the fear that this will be the failure that breaks you.
That’s why I packed it all into one file—the contact, the market details, the quality checks I did, the listing that started the snowball. Not a course. Not hype. Just what pulled me out, so you don’t have to stumble like I did.

1oz8smf,https://www.reddit.com/r/whiskey/comments/1oz8smf/keepers_heart_stout_finished/,Keeper’s Heart Stout Finished,"I have been on the whiskey journey for about a year and half now, but haven’t left a review yet.

This is probably one of the bottles I have enjoyed the most so figured I would give it a go.

55% - 110 proof. Irish and American Blend finished in stout barrels. The bottle is typically $60 I think, I believe I had a discount code for $10. This is a limited release although I think you can still get it.

Nose - Smells similar to Jameson stout finished (only stout finish I’ve had until now) but stronger flavors. There is a strong pleasant flavor I can’t pinpoint, Jameson has it but much weaker. Maybe chocolate or malty and a biscuit note. A slight coffee note. The nose really is great.

Palate - Sweet but not overly sweet. Alcohol def punches you a lil cuz the proof is 110. Maybe just maybe there is some oak in there?? Its all Irish on the palate to me until the end with some rye spice. Coffee, biscuits, cream. Maybe some vanilla as well. Not thin by any means, but rich.

Finish - finish is medium length, but that’s where the American part of the blend comes out. Some baking spice and rye tingling going on to finish. Wanna say it gets a lil dry at the end

I like it a lot, this is similar to the Jameson stout due to the finish but better more intense flavor and more complex with the spicey finish, blend combination, and the extra proof.

7.5 out of 10

Everything is getting more expensive - way more than CPI increases ever reflects. My rent keeps jumping by amounts completely disconnected from how much wages index each year, groceries are insanely, utilities keep creeping up, and every time I look at my budget it feels like I’m paying more, more, more just to exist. 

I even got a promotion recently, which I should be excited about… but honestly? It feels like it’s barely improving my quality of life because the cost of everything has risen so fast. The raise is nice on paper, but the real-world effect feels tiny.

And now that working from the office is being pushed harder again, it’s just extra money bleeding out for commuting, the coffee runs you kinda have to go on if you want to be a ""team player"", clothes, and all those little accidental expenses. When I was WFH full-time, I saved so much without even trying. Now it feels like I’m paying a “just to show up” tax.

On top of all that, I really want to take an overseas holiday. I've only been overseas once and that was in 2016 when I was still at Uni. It would be something to look forward to, something fun, something to break up the grind but saving for it is getting so much harder. Every time I think I can start putting real money aside, another bill goes up or groceries jump again, and suddenly the holiday savings have to be sacrificed. 

I keep cutting little treats and non-essentials just to keep up with the basics: food, rent, bills. It’s exhausting constantly tightening the belt while everything around me gets more expensive. I’m honestly so tired of feeling like I need to sacrifice all joy just to survive.

Is anyone else feeling this resentment building up? How are you coping with that weird feeling of “I’m doing everything right, but life keeps getting pricier anyway”?",38,1763359083.0,AusFinance,1,0.88,False

1oz8llz,https://i.redd.it/8bi5dmxubr1g1.jpeg,Someone convince me not to buy the dumbest motherboard,"So I was scrolling eBay, participating in my favorite hobby- specing more coffee lake storage servers. Coffee lake, and the coffee lake refresh, intels 8th&9th gen core series and Xeon series processors, are my favorite. They were the perfection of the 14nm process- particularly the 9th gen refresh and Xeon e22xx series chips. They approach modern performance with 4.8+ghz boost and have a reputation for reliability. The Intel iGPU- the UHD630 is a nice little 1080p transcode monster. The best part is the price, you can find 8 core CPUs for under $100, or get ECC support on a i3-9100 for under $20 per chip. I have regularly ran these systems at under 20w idle before HDDs- another strength of the coffee lake lineup. 

Now this is claimed to be  a DUAL CPU C246 chipset. To my understanding, the c246 was never offered in a dual scalable package as it was marketed at office pc’s, enthusiast gamers, and workstations. It also hosts a 3 DIMM per socket memory configuration that seems… irregular, and an alleged 2.5gig connection. Then weirdly enough, it has fewer SATA ports than other popular c246 systems from Asus and Asrock. The PCIE bandwidth is also a curiosity with a 16/8/8/8/1 physical layout that is similar to my Asus c246ace pro. So maybe all the PCIE is from one cpu+chipset?

I still remember the young days of our government, I was merely an observer for the presidencies of FlowBerryFizzler and HourEmployment. Pouring out a morning cup of coffee and reading through the then small subreddit. It was all fun and games in my eyes then, just a small sub that'd be dying soon as does many small political subreddits.

But then.. it didn't, I saw it survive so much chaos and drama in such a short period that I convinced myself to finally join in on the politics of the sub. Coincidentally, soon after I fully joined politics under the Spartakusbund; Woodlands was collecting members of parties to form the first constitutional convention. Due to one of our friends unfortunately being unable to join, and practically me being the only person with more than ample free time (during the period, I was VERY free haha) I was sent as the Spartakusbund representative to the Convention.

That's where I met some of the people I'm closest to on the sub. Slavic, Delanorix, Coco and so on and so forth. Alongside some of our fellow delegates, we founded the Independent Judiciary Commission and started writing the constitution. I remember the hours long arguments we had about any part of the Judiciary branch. I find the courts oh so dear to me as it's the branch that I've spent the most time on. During most of the convention Slavic and Prince spent hours long on writing and discussing the very floor we dance on. It'd be unbecoming of me to not acknowledge the vast amounts of effort they put towards this country.

One day, after being elected to the courts, I woke up to.. well being a GM. I was the only European on the court at the time (iirc) so I was more or less unaware of Woodlands' decision on making me one of the GMs that had been mentioned to us before.

And now I stand here, the DoR bigger than ever and our politics flourishing. 

I'm glad I clicked that ""Join„ button on that faithful day. Although many things happened, and some people I was fond of had terrible experiences here; I, perhaps naively, believe that this place can make a change for the better and that we'll be a more welcoming place at the end of the road.

1oz8hdy,https://www.reddit.com/r/PSSD/comments/1oz8hdy/pssd_update_and_caffeine_cessation/,PSSD Update and Caffeine Cessation,"Hello, PSSD Subreddit. A few weeks ago, I posted an update about my PSSD experience. I’m considering making weekly or bi-weekly posts just to keep people interested in the loop. 

On my last post, I talked about how caffeine exacerbated my symptoms; and, by ceasing the consumption of caffeinated products (coffee, chocolate, tea), I was able to experience windows where sexual pleasure returned in my (29M) penis. 

Since that last post, I learned that white chocolate has no caffeine in it; and, since it doesn’t, I started eating it. Unfortunately, and unbeknownst to me, the white chocolate caused my window to close. After I stopped eating it, my window reopened. I find this phenomenon very strange and confusing. I have never had any reaction to any kind of chocolate before PSSD. It could be a different food; however, I’m hesitant to start eating white chocolate again because I’m scared of my window closing.

Despite the aforementioned fear, I’ve been experimenting, a little, in eating small amounts of dark chocolate that come in my favorite brand of mint chip ice cream. Also, I had a small bite of coffee-flavored ice cream the other night and felt completely okay. All of this to say that, a little bit of caffeine might be okay for me, but I don’t know what the threshold is. Decaffeinated coffee is apparently too much for my system.

I’m hoping that, with time, my body will just reset and I’ll be able to have coffee again. Until then, I’m stuck with partial sensitivity, a weak pelvic floor, and weak morning wood only sometimes. I also don’t feel depression or sadness as strongly as I used to, but can probably live with those two diminished. ",2,1763358661.0,PSSD,1,1.0,False

I have been working in a cafe for the past 5 months. 

It’s hard to explain but there is no management. Some people are more experienced than others but we are formally all ‘staff’ no one is ‘manager’. Don’t ask me how, it’s too long to explain lol


Anyway, I am going to provide some context about me, not because I want to play victim but because it’s related to my performance.

I have been in the last year in an abusive relationship, and on top of that I have anxiety, depression and probably I am autistic/ADHD. 


There were times I went to work so upset that I had to go to the bathroom and cry. At times I underperformed a lot and I am ashamed of it, but I was really struggling. Although just recently I broke up and I am taking medications so I am feeling much better and doing much better.


In general tho I do try my best, I can be very good sometimes, and other times I get lost in my thoughts and I am a bit distracted and again, I am ashamed of it, however despite being new I learned how to make coffees, steam milk etc which are not hard tasks but other people being there for longer never learned, so I am showing initiative.


There is one guy who takes this job too seriously, in my opinion. He’s a great worker and even colleague, however he is too much of a perfectionist and he has a lot of anxiety in regards to work or getting things right. He gets super flustered about being busy when it’s just 3 people. He wants to be ‘prepared’ for when it gets busy but the way he acts about it just really too much in my opinion. Anyway, he is also a control freak in the sense that, especially when it’s busy, he’s constantly telling everyone what to do etc. I understand sometimes doing that, but I find that sometimes it’s just a control and micromanaging issue. Once he told me, verbatum, ‘slow the fuck down’ (in reference to steaming milk) in a tone that felt a bit harsh. I took the feedback because I understood what he meant, but amongst other things, it didn’t sit right with me that he used that language.


I usually really appreciate his constructive feedback because I learn a lot, but sometimes it’s not appropriate. Also, he told me off once for keeping the station messy which I NEVER done again after he told me - i swear I am super clean. But this other colleague who is pretty much his friend since she worked there for 2 years, is the messiest person ever. I swear she leaves stuff everywhere, yet she doesn’t get told off.


One day we were talking about a colleague who is diagnosed neurodivergent and is very young. He said jokingly ‘never listens to what she says, she’s not great at her job’. I think she’s pretty good. Sometimes she gets lost in her thoughts and gets overwhelmed and I think she calms down by doing the dishes instead of serving, but I overall like her. He’s also very chatty to her so it really upset me to hear he was saying these things about her. And I realised he’s probably saying these about me too.


Anyway long story short today I told him he’s too much sometimes and that I don’t like how he talks to me and that he’s micromanaging and I know it’s because he doesn’t trust me or other people to do their job. I told him that it’s ok if he thinks he knows better than me, but then he should put systems in place instead of constantly micromanaging. At first he accepted it, then started to essentially say I am dumb lol he didn’t use these words but he literally said ‘if you can’t even do X then how can I expect you to do anything else?’. I said ‘fine if you think I am dumb but maybe tell me why so I can resolve this or maybe we find out you are the dumb one’.

X was something stupid which he built up in his head in my opinion. It's a cafe we are not saving lifes. But I want to respect her knows more than me and maybe I'm genuinely too dumb but it's still insane he said that lol

I said ‘if you have a problem with me it’s your responsibility to tell me. I am uncomfortable working with you because I know you’re silently judging me and are annoyed at me. You either manage your emotions so they don’t influence me or we put systems in place so that we do the work the way you expect it to be done,’


I feel like maybe I was too direct, and I am worried I created drama now. My intention wasn’t to create drama. It was just for him to stop making me feel uncomfortable by micromanaging and having a weird vibe where I know he’s hating me deep down.


Be completely honest, was I wrong to escalate the thing this way? Did I overreact?



TLDR; Colleague micromanages me (everyone) and it pisses me off. So I confronted him. I also know he essentially thinks I am dumb, and he pretty much told me to my face. Now I am not sure if I overreacted or not.

1oz8d1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1oz8d1i/i_lost_my_greatest_love/,I lost my greatest love,"(I used AI to help me fix my grammar so it’s easier for you guys to read, but everything here is fully my own words and my own story.)

Hi, it’s my first time posting here. First of all, I’m really happy that I get to read posts here knowing that I’m not alone, and a lot of people are going through the same thing. I lost my first love last September. It was one of the heaviest and most painful experiences I’ve ever encountered. We’d been together for almost 6 years and God knows how much we loved each other.

During those 6 years, we were long distance for almost 2 years, but before that we were almost inseparable — we were together most of the time. We were perfect. My family adores her and her family didn’t have any problems with us. I would even take care of her grandparents when she wasn’t around. I was there for her as she was always there for me. We were each other’s best friends. We shared secrets. We had this version of ourselves that no one else knew, not even our parents.

But when she moved out of the country to study and eventually settle there, that’s when things started. She started earning a lot, which I was very happy for, but during those times I was having the hardest time maintaining my business. For months, I didn’t earn anything, not even break even. We almost broke up that time because she told me she fell out of love with me and that she outgrew me — which was true. After I begged and asked for compromises, things got better.

Fast forward to January: I decided to move out and work for my sister on an island where I could establish myself. I started earning enough money to somehow pay my loans and save money to move with her. That was my deal with my sister — that I’d only move to the island so I could save and find a career that could help me go to her country.

I’m not gonna lie, at first I was having the best time of my life. I’m in my 20s and I was on an island people from around the world would travel to. I met people from everywhere, but I never cheated on her. I was just distracted from my goal. Partying after work, hanging out with friends, but I always found time for her. I always called her and made sure I spent time with her every day.

We were okay with our setup… or so I thought.

During that long-distance period, her love language suddenly changed. She said she found it hard to be sweet anymore and all we had was our routine. She was supposed to go home last August but her grandfather passed away, so she went home in July. I quickly went back too because I wanted to be there for her during her lowest.

When I first saw her again, it was amazing. I was out of words. I couldn’t even kiss her. She was so beautiful, I even asked myself if she was really my girlfriend. I was with her for 2 weeks, almost inseparable — but the thing is we had a lot of fights.

When I checked her phone, I found out she downloaded Bumble and Hinge before, during the time she said she fell out of love with me. When I saw it, my heart sank and I was lost for words. I confronted her calmly and asked why she did that. She said it was a one-time thing and she didn’t talk to anyone. I believed her because the last thing she needed was a fight with me while she was grieving.

Some days later, I still couldn’t shake off the feeling, so I checked her phone again. I found out she reinstalled it again after some months, and I also saw screenshots of guys talking to her. I didn’t say anything. My tears just fell, and she saw me. I didn’t blame her. I just told her I was going home and she wouldn’t see me anymore. She cried and begged for forgiveness. I forgave her again because I didn’t want to lose her.

Don’t get me wrong, she also checked my phone.

After that, things were okay. I forgave her but I couldn’t forget. Sometimes she’d catch me just staring, lost in thought.

After some days, I was using her phone to scroll on TikTok. That’s when I saw she unblocked her ex on Facebook and Instagram, and one of the guys she talked to on Hinge — they started talking on Snapchat. We were supposed to grab coffee with her family, but because I confronted her about that, we spent an hour crying and talking. She knows one of my biggest insecurities is her ex because she messaged him twice before without me knowing. But because I loved her so much, I still forgave her. I even asked her mom for forgiveness for not going, and she lashed out at me. I just cried and apologized without saying anything, because I wanted to protect my girlfriend.

Fast forward to September. We had a talk because she was very excited for her brother to move in with her. I asked why she didn’t feel that way when I was trying to move in with her. I asked her why she thought we were still together — was it because we’d been together so long, or out of comfort?

Then she told me that sometimes she asked herself that too. She said she wanted a man with authority, a bigger man. She said she didn’t see my efforts anymore.

I’m not gonna lie, this was when my emotions got the best of me. I told her she needed to let me go, that I was preventing her from reaching her full potential. I pushed her away, but she insisted she didn’t want to break up. I pushed harder. We said things we didn’t mean. We hurt each other. In the end she agreed to let me go.

A few hours later, I called her again. Told her it was just my emotions and asked her to get back together. But she didn’t want to anymore.

For the first time in my life, I lost the love of my life. It was the hardest feeling.

Even so, we still kept in touch as she promised to wait for me there. I did everything I could to make it possible. I quit drinking, focused on my traineeship to be a developer, gym 5 days a week, side hustles to save more. She was happy with my progress. We were chatting again, video calling every day, but she became distant and cold. At first I was okay with it — I understood she was protecting herself — but there were days when we talked about what happened, and even though it was hard, we knew it was necessary.

There was one time when she told me that if she exposed herself, she might find someone she found attractive — unlikely, but still possible. She asked me the same question and I told her I didn’t see myself doing that. I was focused on my goal to be with her.

After some weeks, she was still cold and distant. I told her how I felt. I was being vulnerable, thinking she’d understand. I told her I didn’t like our setup and it wasn’t healthy for me. Even though I was the one who initiated the breakup, I regretted it and have been trying to get her back. I told her I didn’t deserve everything that happened. I told her I’d give her time to heal so she could figure things out.

But she said she would now let me go. She thanked me for everything and said I’m free. I told her I didn’t accept it. I told her I would still wait for her.

Two days later, she deleted all our pictures on Instagram — like I just vanished from her life. I asked her why she did that, asked if she was really sure about her decision and what about her promise. She told me it was selfish of me to say I didn’t deserve what happened, and she wished she never agreed to stay in touch with me after the breakup because I was playing with her feelings.

And the worst part — she said, “Just because we’ve been together for 5 years doesn’t mean you’re gonna settle down with me. You shouldn’t settle for less.”

It broke me.

I know it was wrong, but I blocked her on everything. Then a few hours later, I unblocked her and messaged her saying I wasn’t settling for less, that she was the best thing that ever happened to me, and it wasn’t just 5 years — it was the most amazing 5 years of my life.

But she told me to stop messaging her and blocked me.

For the first time in my life, I finally lost her.

I had severe panic attacks for the next days. I lost my only dream in life — to be with her. To be her partner.

After I calmed down, I emailed her telling her this might be the last time she hears from me. I called her crying, telling her everything. She was supposed to come home next year, and it broke me because I was going to propose. I already had everything planned. I was crying the whole time. I told her I still love her, but if my absence would bring her peace and healing, then I’ll finally let her go. I told her this would be the last time I’d message her.

And after everything, the only thing she said was she’s not coming back.

That’s how I lost the only woman I ever loved.
My greatest first love.

1oz8aby,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1oz8aby/i_am_a_paranormal_research_agent_this_is_my_story/,"I am a Paranormal Research Agent, this is my story. Case #006 ""Night Shift at the compound""","The compound isn’t really a compound; that’s just what we call these branches of the organisation. From the outside, it looks like a regular office building, but once you step inside, it becomes clear it’s anything but.

Each compound follows the same layout.

The first floor is for research offices, where I spend most of my time.

The second floor belongs to the hunters, gyms, training rooms, and a handful of desks.

The third floor is for research testing: lots of lab coats and very little fun.

Then there are the underground levels.

Floor A holds the archives.

Floor B, the vault, stores cursed or otherwise preternatural objects.

Floor C, Containment, houses anything or anyone considered dangerous to society, our realm, or reality itself.

No matter which branch you’re assigned to, stepping into the elevator from the lobby always takes you to one of these floors. I’m not convinced they even exist in our universe anymore; that’s just a theory, though. There are no windows down there, and no one I know has clearance to access anything above or below the floors we use. At least the elevator reliably drops you at the right place.

Lily and I pressed the button for the first floor, and a moment later the doors opened into a large room filled with desks. The blue lighting and white furniture do nothing for the mood, but after long enough, you stop noticing it.

“You get Broussard and meet me in one of the conference rooms,” I said before stepping out of the elevator.

“Alright, but you owe me a coffee. I hate the locker room.” Lily shuddered jokingly. The locker room is what she calls the second floor, which isn’t horribly inaccurate.

I walked over to the small kitchenette closest to my cubicle, which is thankfully near a set of conference rooms. I don’t envy the people who have to walk more than a few minutes to get to their desk, but I guess I never really see them.

“Hey, Aarna,” I said while passing a woman wearing far too many jumpers. Aarna Chopra had been my cubicle neighbour for the past few months. She’s nice and very talkative, something I can’t relate to but I like her. It’s good having a friend actually in my branch of the organisation.

“WHAT?” she yelped as I walked past her toward the coffee machine.

“Oh, Elijah, it’s just you. You’re way too quiet; I need to get you a bell or something,” she said playfully, though still breathing heavily from the fright.

“Not really a bell person. Do you want a coffee? I’m brewing a few,” I asked.

“Ooo, yes please. Who are the other ones for?” she asked with a smile. She leaned back on the counter, fiddling with something in her hand that I couldn’t see.

“Lily and Richard B are having a secret meeting about an entity that may or may not want to kill me,” I said casually.

“Oh,” she said nervously. “Can I join?”



A few minutes later, Richard and Lily entered the small conference room I’d claimed. Aarna sat at the table, using the sleeves of her yellow jumper to hold her coffee cup.

“Yo, Aaron, welcome to the secret club,” Richard said confidently.

“My name is actually Aarna,” she corrected. He cursed under his breath and tried again.

“Shit, sorry, chère. Well, I welcome you to the team, Aarna; the more the merrier,” he said with a large, genuine smile before taking his seat. Lily didn’t say anything but gave me an odd smile when she sat down.

Once everyone was settled, I went over the story of what happened when I was a child, Stalborn, the disappearing kids, Imani, and how he told me William Grey was free, though admittedly in a less emotionally vulnerable way.

After I finished, they sat in silence for a few minutes. I expected questions, not silence.

“So,” I started awkwardly, “what are we all thinking?”

“It’s just a lot to take in, Elijah,” Aarna said, and I saw Richard nodding.

“I’m sorry if this is rude to ask, but… why didn’t it kill you when you were in the car? No one was around, and you didn’t have any protection,” Aarna continued.

My stomach tightened, and blood rushed to my head.

“It is a creature of habit and routine; it has hunting rituals, and you didn’t fit those requirements, not at that point,” Richard jumped in.

“Do you want my advice, or do you want my expert opinion?” he asked before taking a sip of coffee.

I hadn’t even thought about that. I’d been trying to figure out what William Grey was without consulting an actual hunter.

“Well, you are the hunter here. Have you ever hunted something like this?” Lily asked impatiently. Richard smiled.

“Nope, but I am excited to—”

The lights suddenly shut off, and everyone vanished in a wave of fog.

“Woah ho, I honestly wasn’t sure that would work, Mr. Wiltburrow. I’ve only done it a few times over the years, but goddamn am I happy it did,” a familiar husky voice said from all around me. I spun in every direction, and when I turned back toward the table, he was sitting at the end of it.

“Imani, what have you done to me?” I said, panicked and confused.

“Simple. Well, simple for me. I took your consciousness out of the realm of the living and brought you to the dream realm. Thought we should have a chat,” he said, planting both hands on the table.

“This is honestly the worst time, Imani. You’ve had the past few days to talk to me. Why now?” I asked, losing patience.

“Just thought I’d give my favourite research agent a little heads-up: the compound, this little slice of bureaucracy outside of where danger could find you, is currently under attack,” he said with a smile.

“What have you done!” I shouted, but he shook his head.

“Not from me, and not from him.” He lifted his hand and pointed at the glass doors. Standing outside was a tall, pale man, breathing heavily and smiling.

“You know his dreams aren’t particularly fun; a lot to do with you nowadays,” Imani said. William Grey’s eyes were locked on me. His desperation felt real. I wanted to believe he was just a figment of Imani’s fog, but part of me knew this was William Grey and somehow, we were in his dream.

“Anywho,” Imani said, waving Grey away as he dissolved into fog, “just thought I’d let you know that it’s almost here, and it’s looking for something powerful in that vault of yours.”

He waved his hand playfully like a cat batting at a mouse. Suddenly I shot up off the floor. The lights were on. Lily was crouched over me; Aarna was on one side, and Richard stood above them.

I’d forgotten where I was for a moment before adrenaline flushed everything back. Sweat built quickly.

“How long was I out?” I said.

“A few minutes, four or five,” Lily answered. “Elijah, are you okay?”

“No. It was Imani. He said something is coming, and it’s heading for the vault,” I said, trying and failing to stand.

“You think something can get in here?” Richard said skeptically.

The lights shifted to red, and sirens blared.

“All personnel, please evacuate to the evacuation zones on your respective floors. Please stay away from the elevator and do not confront the foreign entity. I repeat…”

“Did you guys even know they had speakers in here? Or alarms?” Richard said.

I ran for the door, but his hand grabbed my wrist. I slipped out easily, but Lily wasn’t as easy to escape. She threw her hand out, and I felt myself yanked back, slamming my tailbone against the edge of the table.

“Where do you think you’re going, Elijah?” Lily asked, almost accusatory.

I considered lying, saying I was going to the evacuation zone, but these people, Aarna, Richard, Lily, were my friends.

“The elevator. Imani warned me that something is breaking into the vault to steal something powerful,” I confessed.

“And you alone were going to stop it,” she said sarcastically. “I have so many things I want to say right now,” she added, lowering her arm. The weight lifted and I stood.

“Okay, I think I know what you want to say. Can we please talk on the way?” I urged.

“Shouldn’t we go to the evacuation zones?” Aarna asked.

“Aarna, in all the time you’ve worked here, have you ever seen an evacuation zone? Any of you? Or heard an alarm?” I asked. They all shook their heads.

“Maybe… I don’t know. It is pretty weird,” Aarna said.

“The hunters would be on the move,” Richard muttered. “Shit. Most of them are in the field. It’s only me and a handful of others.”

“We should meet up with them,” Lily said.

“We can meet them in the vault. Please we need to move,” I begged.

“I don’t know, Elijah; this all feels really weird,” Aarna said, tucking her hands into her sleeves.

“Alright, I trust you. Let’s move,” Lily said. “Aarna, no one will blame you if you go to the evacuation zone, but if Elijah thinks something’s up, then I’m going with him.”

The doors opened to the vault: a long, dark, metallic hallway. The lights were off, the air cold. Familiar somehow, but I couldn’t place it.

The vault is a large metallic maze with small enclosures for each paranormal artefact, almost like a zoo. It’s easy to get turned around.

We made our way in slowly. Richard and Lily led with camping lamps; Aarna and I followed with flashlights.

“So, what are we looking for exactly?” Richard whispered.

“I don’t know. Imani just said it was powerful,” I said.

“I don’t think I like this dream man,” Lily added.

“I can’t help but agree; I’m not a fan of him dragging me around whenever he wants,” I replied.

“You think he can be killed?” Richard asked. I didn’t get the chance to answer.

A scream rang through the vault, bouncing off metal.

Aarna squealed and fell into me. I dropped my flashlight, and it shattered.

“Oh God, I’m so sorry, Elijah—” Aarna started, but I raised my hand.

“It’s okay. Really.”

“Here, take mine. I can see pretty well in the dark,” Richard said, handing me his lamp. He pulled a large machete from his pants and swung it effortlessly.

“How long have you had that in there?” Lily asked, amused despite the situation.

“Every hunter is prepared for anything,” he replied confidently.

“Even accidental cuts on your dick?” Lily shot back.

Under any other circumstances, that would’ve earned a laugh but tonight, silence. Except for another scream.

“Everyone stay close,” Richard said, and we huddled together.

We moved forward until Richard held up a hand.

“Hold up the hallway branches.”

“Wait, that doesn’t make sense. I’ve been down here before. I thought things seemed different, but this is completely changed,” Aarna said.

“Are you sure? Can this floor change?” Lily asked.

“She’s right, Lily. I’ve been down here a few times. It’s not like this.” My heart pounded.

“We should split up,” I said.

“Are you serious? Splitting up is a horrible idea,” Aarna said.

“I know, but we can’t let whatever’s down here get what it’s looking for and since we don’t know what that is, we need to cover more ground,” I said. They stared.

“What?” I asked.

“Nothing you’ve just taken more to fieldwork than I expected,” Lily said. “Aarna, go with Richard. He’s the most likely to survive, so you’ll have pretty great odds. Elijah and I will go left, you two go right.”



“So, you know Aarna definitely has a thing for you, right?” Lily said as we walked.

“What are you talking about?” I said, genuinely surprised. She always makes small talk during tense situations, but this caught me off guard.

“Don’t act like you don’t see it. You’re dumb, but you’re the smart type of dumb.”

“Ouch,” I muttered.

Before she could continue, a screeching noise rang out ahead. Lily closed her eyes briefly, reached a hand forward, and whispered, “Oh God,” before sprinting into the dark. I followed.

What we found was something I wish I hadn’t seen.

A hunter lay on the ground her lower half missing, organs dragged along behind her upper body. Barbed wire wrapped around and pierced through her. A soft, piercing screech escaped her slightly open mouth, like a final scream looping forever.

Dear God. Her face was unrecognisable. A hook pierced her right eye, attached to a cable stretching into the dark. It was pulling her toward something. We both knew we had to stop it.

I looked away instinctively. This was the worst thing I’d ever seen. Lily took a few steps back and gagged.

“Jesus fuck,” she choked.

I forced myself to focus on anything else and saw a revolver clutched in the corpse’s hand. Likely organisation-issued silver bullets. Shielding my eyes, I unpeeled her still-warm fingers and took the weapon.

I felt suspended between overwhelming emotion and complete numbness. Ever since remembering Stalborn, death has taken on new meaning.

“Let’s keep moving,” Lily said once she steadied herself.

“Alright,” I said, holding the revolver out. I had no experience with firearms, but in a hallway, it wouldn’t matter.

We followed the metal wire deeper. Neither of us spoke.

My thoughts drifted to Aarna. Richard could handle himself, but Aarna had never done fieldwork. What had I pressured her into?

Gunshots suddenly exploded ahead. I flinched hard.

“Shit, that was ahead of us,” I said.

We ran. The hallway opened into a tall room lined with enclosures. Scaffolding climbed the right wall toward catwalks crossing multiple levels.

“We have to go up,” Lily said.

“Are you sure—”

A man wearing a hunter’s vest fell from above and hit the floor with a wet, heavy splat.

We climbed. The higher we went, the more flesh hung from above like meat in a slaughterhouse.

The smell was overwhelming. I felt myself slipping toward shock.

At the top, we saw two figures. One hunter swung an axe at another hunter except the second had jagged metal pieces jutting from his neck and face.

The axe-wielder swung hard. The other stepped aside and thrust his hand out. Metal cables burst from his wrist and forearm, digging into the axe-wielder and yanking her off the railing. As she fell, the cables wrapped around the railing, suspending her body midair.

The creature looked at us. Its eyes glowed orange like headlights through fog.

“HYAH!” Lily grunted, thrusting her hands out. Cables shot toward us from under its skin, but she flung the creature off the scaffolding.

I ran toward where it fell. My footsteps echoed like thunder. I found an enclosure with only a lectern. On it sat a pocket watch. I tried the door, it was locked. I fired at the glass. The bullet did nothing.

Of course. It was the vault. Why would the glass break?

Metallic booms erupted behind me. I turned to see large metallic arms, wires wrapped together, dig into the scaffolding. The creature was climbing back up, arms protruding from its back like broken wings.

I aimed at it, but my hands shook violently. Panic overwhelmed me. I fired once completely missing and dropped the gun.

“Lily!” I screamed. She stood on the staircase, trying to force the thing back down, but it wasn’t working. The creature aimed at her and shot a metal wire. As it neared her, it slowed. She was holding it back, but it shook violently.

“Hey dickhead!” I yelled. It turned its offhand toward me, and I ripped the cable out of its palm. I dove, but not fast enough, the cable grazed my thigh, slicing it open. Pain exploded through me.

“ELINAH!” Lily screamed. The cable she’d been holding slipped past her defence and plunged into her shoulder. She screamed and nearly went limp, dragged toward the creature.

Fear hit something deep inside me.

I crawled to the railing and pulled myself up. The creature reeled Lily closer. Suddenly, an axe spun through the air and embedded itself in the creature’s back.

It screeched a mixture of a man’s scream and an inhuman growl.

I saw Richard and Aarna on the far side. They were unharmed. Relief flooded me.

The cable slid out of Lily’s shoulder and retreated into the creature’s arm. She collapsed against the railing, unconscious.

“Don’t let it impale you!” I yelled.

“Wasn’t my plan!?” Richard shouted. He held a machete in one hand and another throwing axe in the other, both silver.

Aarna ran toward me. She knelt and looked at my torn pants, torn skin.

Without thinking, she took off her yellow jumper, revealing the green one beneath, and tied the yellow one around my wound. She put my arm around her shoulder.

“We have to move,” she said, stuttering with fear but still helping.

I tried to see Richard fighting the creature, but my vision blurred with adrenaline and pain.

Another screech. The catwalk shook. Aarna lost her footing, and we both fell onto the metal.

“Ahhh, dammit,” I groaned.

“Aarna, are you okay?” I said through clenched teeth.

“Yeah. I’m okay, Elijah,” she said, though her tone wasn’t convincing.

I looked across the catwalk and saw Richard crouched over an exhausted but conscious Lily. He held his machete in one hand and an adrenaline syringe in the other.

The creature began to rise again. Richard injected Lily, and she roared back to life.

Richard launched himself forward, stepping onto the railing before leaping. Lily thrust her arms out, psychically pushing him harder toward the creature.

Richard flew into the creature’s upper body. He angled his machete so it drove straight into its skull and down its spine.

The creature spun violently, its eyes flickering with light before returning to a normal human colour.

Then it went still.

Richard tumbled onto the catwalk as the creature fell off the railing, crashing to the floor below.

A few hours later, a large squad of hunters arrived and locked down the area. We were separated and underwent individual tests.

Lily spent the most time in isolation; the higher-ups heard she’d been pierced by the cable. She was the only survivor of that specific injury, so they needed to ensure she wasn’t infected like the hunter the creature took over.


“I don’t think I want to do fieldwork,” Aarna said with a nervous chuckle.

Aarna and I talked in my cubicle like normal. I sat at my desk while she leaned against the wall.

“Trust me, most of the time it’s chasing myths that are just that. This was… something else,” I said while drinking coffee.

She smiled at me. I smiled back. Aarna was a good person.

“I’ll be back in just a minute,” I said, getting up and heading to the bathroom. As I washed my hands, the water shifted—not in temperature, but texture. Something about it felt wrong. Superficial.

I looked at my reflection. Black fog lingered around the bathroom.

“Imani, are you serious? Can’t I even piss in peace?” I snapped.

Why should I expect anything else from him? He respects no timing, so why would he respect the ancient law of the bathroom: do not disturb?

A toilet flushed, and a stall door opened. Imani walked out in a fine suit. He strode casually to the sink beside me and washed his hands.

“My, my, Elijah, you have outdone yourself; you stopped that wiry parasite from getting what it wanted,” he said cheerfully.

“Yeah, I guess we did. Can you at least tell me what it wanted? Why was the stopwatch so special?” I asked.

“Not for you to know, my friend. The important thing is that you stopped it from being stolen,” he said.

He moved to the hand dryer and used it far longer than necessary.

“Okay, if you aren’t going to tell me what it does, can you at least tell me why you didn’t want it stolen?” I asked.

“Simple. It wasn’t his to steal; it’s mine. Or, more plainly… it’s yours,” he said, looking over his shoulder at me.

I've seen similar posts from u/VennTeaCoffee, u/sennaro93, u/Better-Factor1953, and u/Dank_Boi_619 \- this might help you too.

  
**System Information**

* **Model:** ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 (2021)
* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 9 4900HS
* **Dedicated GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 Max-Q



# Issue Summary

My laptop was experiencing a critical failure whenever I connected the AC power adapter. About 30 seconds after plugging it in, the screen would go black, system fans would ramp up to maximum speed, and connected I/O devices (e.g., mouse, keyboard) would disconnect. Although everything worked fine when I ran on battery power alone.

I eventually isolated the problem to the integrated AMD graphics driver. The crash only happened when I had the AMD display driver enabled while connected to AC power.



# What I Did to Troubleshoot

1. **Initial Incident:** I first noticed this problem when I tried upgrading to Windows 11. The installation would fail every time, giving me a black screen with fans at full blast, forcing me to roll back to Windows 10.
2. **Operating System Reinstalls:** Thinking it might be software corruption, I performed multiple clean OS installations:
   * I reinstalled Windows 10 three times.
   * I reinstalled Windows 11 four times.
3. **Driver Installation and Crash Trigger:** On Day 1, after a fresh Windows 10 installation, my system was stable until I installed drivers. The crashing started immediately after I installed the AMD and NVIDIA graphics drivers while Windows updates were also running in the background.
4. **Problem Isolation:** Through methodical testing, I identified the trigger. When I disabled the ""AMD Radeon(TM) Graphics"" adapter in Device Manager, my system stayed stable with the AC adapter connected. But the moment I re-enabled this device, the system would crash again when on AC power.
5. **Professional Diagnosis and Further Testing:**
   * I took my laptop to an official ASUS service center, where technicians reinstalled the original factory OS image.
   * After their diagnostics, they told me the integrated AMD graphics card was faulty and that I needed to replace the entire CPU/iGPU assembly. They quoted me 92,000 INR for a new motherboard or 58,000 INR to replace the component on my current one.
   * After leaving the service center, I installed Pop!\_OS (a Linux distribution) to see if this was Windows-specific. The same crashing happened, which seemed to confirm a hardware or firmware problem.



# Software & Driver Details

* **Operating Systems Tested:** Windows 10, Windows 11, Pop!\_OS (Linux).
* **AMD Drivers Attempted:**
   * Official ASUS-provided chipset and graphics drivers from the support website.
   * Generic AMD Software Adrenalin Edition (Version 25.9.1) from AMD's official website.
* **NVIDIA Driver Installed:**
   * Game Ready Driver Version 581.42.
* **Resources Used for Downloads:**
   * **ASUS Support:** [`https://rog.asus.com/laptops/rog-zephyrus/2021-rog-zephyrus-g14-series/helpdesk_download/`](https://rog.asus.com/laptops/rog-zephyrus/2021-rog-zephyrus-g14-series/helpdesk_download/)
   * **ASUS Product Details:** [`https://account.asus.com/us/myproductedit.aspx?rowguid=82ad3e9a-f3e0-42e4-8de9-ee8ffd2758d0`](https://account.asus.com/us/myproductedit.aspx?rowguid=82ad3e9a-f3e0-42e4-8de9-ee8ffd2758d0)
   * **AMD Support:** [`https://www.amd.com/en/support/download/drivers.html`](https://www.amd.com/en/support/download/drivers.html)



# How I Accidentally Fixed It

After the service center visit, I installed Windows 10 again Then I accidentally fixed the issue by following a specific driver reinstallation procedure:

1. In **Device Manager**, under **Display adapters**, I selected the ""AMD Radeon(TM) Graphics"" adapter.
2. I clicked ""Uninstall device"".
3. In the confirmation pop-up, I left the ""Delete the driver software for this device"" checkbox **unchecked**. I used to remove the driver software entirely prior to this attempt.
4. When I confirmed the uninstall, the driver was removed and then immediately reinstalled itself.

https://preview.redd.it/5gzln4iu7r1g1.png?width=338&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0f6d95a5b0065c2313b9e3398ffa2b509de7c7a

**My Theory:** The issue wasn't actually a catastrophic hardware failure, but rather a deep-level software conflict or corrupted driver state. This specific uninstall method, which kept the base driver files while forcing a re-initialization, seems to have reset the communication between the iGPU, dGPU and power management system.

**Stability:** Since I did this procedure, my laptop has been perfectly stable for 31 days with zero crashes or issues.



# Current Status: Resolved and Optimized

My laptop is now fully functional and stable. What the service center diagnosed as a hardware fault appears to have been a complex software driver conflict, which I've now resolved. I have the integrated AMD graphics adapter enabled, and my system is stable on both battery and AC power.

**Performance Optimization:** I also realized a significant performance boost by switching how I connect my external display,from the iGPU-linked HDMI port to the dGPU-linked USB-C port.

* **What I Used Before:** HDMI (connected to the iGPU), which gave me 90-130 FPS in Valorant.
* **What I Use Now:** A USB-C to DisplayPort adapter ([amazon.in/dp/B09G9HB5TQ](http://amazon.in/dp/B09G9HB5TQ)), which connects directly to my NVIDIA dGPU.
* **Result:** This switch has reduced system heat and significantly boosted my performance. I now get 150-180 FPS in Valorant at 2560x1440 resolution.

So… me and my friends, all final-year MBBS students, were going through constant caffeine crash cycles. The jitters, the anxiety, the uncomfortable dip after coffee or energy drinks.

We started experimenting with different things that could help. That’s how we discovered matcha. It’s actually great, but honestly… we really couldn’t get used to the taste, and getting clean-label matcha in India isn’t easy.

Currently, we’re researching caffeine and L-theanine along with our institute’s pharma faculty. Maybe, if the writing turns out well, we might even publish a small paper since it’s our first research project. We tried L-theanine with coffee in proper, scientifically established ratios (lots of research already shows their synergy and alpha wave effects, but I won’t go deep here or this post will become too long).
But surprisingly… it worked. A lot.
We made our friends try it too, and they felt the same effects.

Around the same time a mental health survey team came to our campus. After interacting with them, we realised how common mental fatigue really is among us and far more than we expected.

So guys…
We’ve been thinking. Maybe we can’t eliminate mental fatigue fully, but one major reason behind it is definitely high uncontrolled caffeine intake and the crashes that follow. That part we can address.

We’re thinking of building something genuinely helpful, maybe even a brand, but a community driven one. Everyone studies differently, everyone’s brain works differently, so the needs of the community should be shaped by the community itself.

We’ve been formulating for the past three months, and honestly, finding the right proportions is tough. We don’t want to rely on artificial stuff. So we’re using natural ingredients only, like real fruit or flavour powders, because at the end of the day, non-maleficence is a principle we can’t ignore.
Alongside that, we’re reaching out to manufacturers, asking for caffeine analysis reports, talking to an L-theanine supplier (Suntheanine), and trying to understand the cleanest possible way to do this.
At the end of the day, we’re medicos, still learning.
All I know is that in colleges and offices, caffeine crashes are real and common.

We want to keep things minimal. No gimmicks like ashwagandha or focus herbs that take days to weeks to show effect. Just evidence-based stuff with full transparency and lab reports.

I'm really sorry if this got long, but I wanted to share what’s been going on.

So, for the past 3 years parang at least once or twice a month nawawala yung internet namin. Ewan ko ba bakit pero minsan napansin ko pag may inaayos na connection din dito samin ay kami yung nawawalan at yung mga kapitbahay naman nag ookay ang internet. Madaming beses na din nakitaan ng issues at na-aayos naman. Sobrang bagal din madalas ngayon kahit kaka upgrade lang namin at mataas pa din palagi ping sa online games at sa work naman ay di nawawala nag rereconnecting yung sa mga calls lalo pagka nag pepresent. Nag eexpect na din ako every month na mawawala nanaman at kokontak nanaman sa support nila kaya meron na din ako template sa notes ko ng mga sagot ko sa mga agent nila. Last Month October lang din meron technician pinadala dito to repair.

So ito na nga, as usual today nawala nanaman internet and nag chat ako sa pldt cares nila na page sa messenger. Pero sa sobrang bagal ng data ko e naka “sending” lang yung reply ko ng ilang seconds pero nasesend naman sya. Nagulat lang din ako kanina kasi first time ko na pinutol yung chat session kasi wala na daw ako sa linya? Sinabihan ko din yung agent na sorry kung may delay onti yung replies kasi nga naka mobile data lang at ambagal. 12:07pm hiningi sakin yung details ko for the repair request at ayun na nga naka sending lang muna yung reply ko at yung actual sent time ay 12:10pm tapos pagka send ng reply na yun ay may nag pop up lang din agad na mga message na naputol na pala nila yung session kasi wala daw akong reply? Haha gets naman din 3 mins ata lumipas before nag ok yung data ko at nasend yung reply ko pero wala man lang silang patawad o pasensya at end kung end hahahaha ako pa nag sosorry at alam kong agent lang sila di naman tlga nila kontrol serbisyo ng connection ni pldt. Kelangan ko tuloy mag antay ng 30-40mins ulit sa queue to raise the concern.

Now, since I think na last straw ko na yung customer service experience kanina, I am thinking of changing my ISP to Globe since I heard some good things about them recently lalo daw yung customer service? Mabilis daw mga troubleshooting or repair? How true po kaya ito? Na try ko din sa pinsan ko na naka Globe fiber na okay sya pang work kasi stable at yung ping sa games ok din—maayos sa gaming din tlga at stable around 40ms usually compared sa 56-80ms ng pldt na napaka unstable with packet loss.

Naisip ko kasi na lahat naman ng isp sa pinas bulok at nawawalan tlga ng internet itong mga to from time to time so sana at least avail ko nalang yung may pinaka stable at maayos na customer service para kahit papaano kampante ako na may sasagot naman na pambawing tulong para doon sa mga expected na bulok service nila. At sana yung walang mga shady na practice yung mga technician na kung saan ililipat lang sa box yung mga wiring para maayos yung connection nong isa pero putol naman dun sa kabila. Hindi ko na ata ever ma rerecommend  tong PLDT  lalo yung gamers natin dyan, avoid nlng pldt since bulok tlga ping  and packet loss at kahit sa work lagi reconnecting sa mga calls ko haha ewan ko ba dito.

Kamusta experience nyo lately with your ISP? Getting better ba or worse din?

Also, some context, naka wfh ako and kapatid ko nag oonline classes now so super important may internet kami and ngayon nganga kami parehas at need ata gumastos sa lumabas mag hanap ng co-working space or coffee shop haha.

Hey everyone,

Ever feel like you're stuck on a hamster wheel? You're doing all the ""things,"" but you're not actually getting anywhere. You want more joy, better focus, and a sense of calm, but it all feels so... out of reach.

I've been there. The idea of ""optimizing your life"" can sound like a massive, exhausting project. But I’ve learned it's not about a total overhaul. It's about small, almost invisible shifts that compound over time.

Here are a few daily hacks that have genuinely changed the game for me, broken down by what matters most.

**BOOSTING HAPPINESS 😊**

It's not about finding a pot of gold. It's about noticing the gold coins scattered all around you.

*   **The 3-Win Gratitude List:** Before you check your phone in the morning, name three *specific* things you're grateful for. Not just ""my family,"" but ""the way my dog rested his head on my foot last night."" Specificity is key.
*   **Create a 'Joy List':** What *actually* makes you happy? Not what you think *should* make you happy. Is it a specific song? A 10-minute walk without your phone? A good cup of tea? Make a list and intentionally sprinkle one of these into your day, every day.
*   **Celebrate the Micro-Wins:** Did you finally send that awkward email? Unload the dishwasher? Drink a glass of water? **Acknowledge it.** Give yourself a mental high-five. Momentum is built on small victories.

**BOOSTING PRODUCTIVITY 🚀**

This isn't about hustle culture or burnout. It's about creating more time and mental space for the things you love.

*   **The 2-Minute Rule:** If a task takes less than two minutes, do it immediately. Replying to a text, putting a dish in the dishwasher, taking out the trash. This stops the buildup of ""mental clutter"" and saves you from a massive to-do list later.
*   **Monotask Like a Pro:** Multitasking is a myth. It’s just switching between tasks poorly. Try the Pomodoro technique: 25 minutes of intense, single-minded focus on ONE thing, followed by a 5-minute break. You’ll be shocked at what you can accomplish.
*   **Plan Tomorrow, Tonight:** Spend 5 minutes before bed deciding on your top 1-3 priorities for the next day. You'll wake up with a clear mission instead of a sense of overwhelming dread.

**BOOSTING PEACE 🌱**

You can't control the chaos of the world, but you can create pockets of inner calm.

*   **Mindful Sips:** The next time you have a coffee or tea, just for the first two minutes, do nothing else. No phone, no TV, no thinking about work. Just notice the warmth of the mug, the smell, the taste. It's a mini-meditation.
*   **""Digital Sunset"":** Pick a time each night to put your phone away for good. For me, it's 9 PM. Your brain needs time to disconnect from the constant stream of information to actually rest.

Look, I know reading a list of hacks can feel overwhelming in itself, especially if you're feeling stuck or your emotional well-being is taking a hit. It's tough to build new systems when your foundation feels shaky. For anyone who needs a more structured plan to tackle the emotional side of things, I've personally found **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)** to be incredibly helpful for building that emotional resilience.

The goal isn't to be a perfect, optimized robot. It's to intentionally build a life that feels **good**. One that has more room for joy, focus, and calm, one tiny step at a time.

So, what about you all? What's one tiny hack you've implemented that's made a surprisingly BIG difference in your day-to-day?",1,1763357093.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Hey there peoples! Whos having a good weekend? What’s everyone up to today!? 

How do you like your coffee? What process do you prefer? Me personally, I always start the day off with drip coffee. Then I’ll make a good espresso around noon. Sometimes finishing the day with a nightcap! 

Also, I have two doggos, they’re basically the main character of my life at this point. So if you come for the dog tax, I got you covered! 

I started getting back into gaming, so I play for an hour or two each night. I play a bit of everything but always looking for recommendations and people to game with! 

I’m an outdoors person, I’m usually out camping, hunting, hiking, backpacking, off-roading or at the beach with the dogs. I work basically 24/7, well I’m on call all hours of the day when I’m not actually at work. So that’s a thing.

Anyways; looking to find someone to chat with and break the monotony. Let’s chat!

I’m looking to make some new online friends, adults only (18+), because I more interested in sharing experiences with people around my age.

A bit about me: I live with five cats who clearly think they pay the rent. 😂 However, I adore all animals and believe each one is beautiful in its own chaotic way. I’d love to have a dog someday, but right now, cats suit my lifestyle way better.

I play football (soccer) almost every evening, it’s my daily dose of cardio. I’m big into fitness too, and working out is basically my cheap therapy. I also love cooking, especially healthy stuff that tricks my brain into thinking I'm a responsible adult. If you’re into fitness, we might just be accountability buddies and can hype each other up 💪

I’ve recently fallen down the skincare rabbit hole. At this point, my face has become an experiment ground but glow goals xD 😌

I’m a huge history nerd. Give me ancient legends, epic battles, or ghost stories and I’m hooked. Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones are my comfort shows. I game too Red Dead Redemption 2 is my favourite 

I’m a full-time software engineer. But no matter how busy life gets, I always make time for a good conversation. So if anything here sounds remotely relatable or just mildly interesting drop a message. ☺️I don’t bite (but one of my cats might). 😺 ",1,1763356841.0,InternetFriends,0,1.0,False

I showed up at the coffee shop, told them in Vietnamese that I had coffee there yesterday at 1PM and showed them a picture of a charger (no idea how to say this in Vietnamese), said that I forgot it and they started talking to each other, told me to wait a bit, made a phone call and a few minutes afterward a female employee showed up with my charger and cable!

Starting Valganciclovir now. Nicotine patch + electrolytes + strict pacing have helped most.

\----

Hi fellow long haulers. I’ve been quietly reading this sub for over a year now, and I’ve found reading these stories really helpful to try to find new things to try so I thought I’d share my story. I’m 13+ months into Long COVID and still looking for answers.

**Background**  
My most recent COVID infection was Sept 4, 2024, which was my 4th time getting covid. I was extremely active before this (working out \~2+ hours/day - jogging my dog, cycling, yoga). I was really sick for about 2 weeks, thought it was just the flu, but went to urgent care and tested positive for covid. I was too late for Paxlovid, so they just told me to rest. Two weeks later I started to feel better and tried a *very* easy 20-minute Peloton ride. Five hours later, I got hit with a horrific sore throat. By the next morning, my throat had closed up, I lost my voice, and had horrible congestion. Urgent care said it wasn’t COVID, flu, or strep. Steroids helped the acute flare but after that, I never got better. 

**Main Symptoms**

My main symptoms today are: crushing fatigue, 7-8/10 headache constantly, and intense PEM. For the first 4 months of LC, I also had shortness of breath and more serious POTS symptoms. My shortness of breath slowly got better, but I still have some autonomic dysfunction. I am a woman, and symptoms are way worse day 22 to day 3 of my cycle (I have a regular 28 day cycle). Functionally, I am \~95% housebound. 

**The Journey**

I’ve been to more doctors, and had more blood tests, than I can count. But for completeness, I’ve been to: Stanford Long Covid Clinic, Pulmonology (normal imaging and testing), Cardiology (14-day Holter monitor, echocardiogram, ultrasound of my heart), Neurology (brain MRI), Naturopathic physicians, Functional Medicine doctors, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Acupuncture, Infectious diseases, multiple PCP’s, and alternative practitioners. 

Initially, it was tons of testing (which came back normal), resting, and trying different things to help. I’ve tried basically all the **supplements** you can read about that help with LC (nattokwinase, glutathione, NAC, CoQ10, Thiamin, Quercetin, PQQ, Omega 3, Vitamin D3+K2, Aceyl-L-Carnitine, Magnesium, etc). Nothing worked of note, besides Athletic Greens kind of helped my general energy in the morning, so I’m still taking that. 

Once I went to the **Long Covid Clinic at Stanford**, it was a huge letdown. They told me to pace, to rest, and to try Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN). When I tried it, I had horrible migraines and histamine response, so bad that I had to stop after 3 days (was on 0.5mg to start). I cried after this appointment, because they gave me little hope of recovery and made me feel like a total idiot for the Peloton ride early on, like I’d brought this on myself. I felt terrible. 

After that, I went to a functional medicine doctor who was convinced I had **CIRS** (Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome), which to be fair I (and probably many of us) match the description for. That doctor found that I had high levels of Mold IGG levels in my blood, so I started on a detox for mold. We did huge environmental remediation of our home to try to make the environment safe. We didn’t find much or anything through that process. We added air filtration throughout the house with AirDoctor air purifiers. I was on Cholestyramine (CSM - a strong binder), Itraconzaole (nasal spray - anti fungal), and VIP nasal spray. I spent time at my parent’s house (desert climate, definitely no mold). The binders caused constipation, so I was also having to do coffee enemas. It was not pretty. I was also doing infrared sauna 4x/week for 30min to try to detox through sweat because I can’t work out. This lasted 5 months and honestly made me feel worse. Follow-up testing showed no improvement. I realized this wasn’t my root cause and ended the protocol. Stopping actually helped, because I stopped putting massive stress on an already overwhelmed system. 

This practitioner also suggested LMNT **Electrolytes**, which I do 2x/day and really helps. Around this time I also started some peptides, specifically: KPV, BPC-157, and Thymosin-Alpha 1. This actually helped me quite a bit, probably improved my baseline by about 10%. I hated the sub-q injections but kept with this for about 3 months before taking a break. I’ve also tried NAD+ IVs, but that didn’t help me (and was wildly expensive).

I was hearing about somatic therapy and brain retraining, so I got the **Truvaga Vagal Nerve Stimulator** and tried that (didn’t work), tried brain retraining YouTube (good for mindfulness but didn’t change symptoms - still doing this though just in case, figure it’s free and can’t hurt). 

I tried the **Nicotine Patch** \- which I’m still doing. This really helps with my dysautonomia symptoms. I do 7mg patch with 24 hour release, and have been doing this for 2+ months. This has been the clearest thing that has helped me.

I then did an [InfectoLab](https://i-labs.us/patient-testing-menu/) blood test per the recommendation of another doctor, the **Long Haul Viral Panel.** That came back really interesting: it showed I still have active T-Cell replication for SARS (covid virus - this was IFN-y interferon gamma levels), had tons of SARS spike proteins, and reactivated **Epstein Barr Virus** (both latent, and lytic IFN-y) 0 the active (lytic) levels at super high levels. Because of this, I got myself some Paxlovid and did a 15 day trial of that. I felt pretty good while on it - but regressed once off it. I took a week off, did blood labs, and then now am just starting on Valgancylovir (Valtrex, antiviral), to try to target the EBV. I am considering adding Celebrex into the mix per a recent study from Bateman Horne. 

**What’s Helped & What’s Next**

Nicotine Patch, LMNT Electrolytes, Strict Pacing, maybe Stealth Pathogen Protocol.

As mentioned, I’m starting anti-virals and will see how those go. I’ll aim to give this sub an update in a few months once I see if they’re working or not. I’m also very curious about IVIG for the high spike proteins I have in my blood.

Really recommend using the RTHM AI chat. They have all the recent studies and articles and they explain it in simple terms, and how it relates to your case. You do need to upload your labs and information, which I am fine with if it will help me get better. This was what helped put together a study from Bateman Horne on Long Covid + EBV reactivation for me, with the autoantibodies, which is where I think I may have a clue of what's happening or at least a potential path forward?

This has been, by far, the hardest thing I’ve ever gone through in my life. It is so isolating, so frustrating, and so sad. The roller-coaster of hope and despair is maddening. The constant uncertainty of if I’ll ever get better, the ‘you look great though’ well-intentioned comments when I feel absolutely horrible is infuriating. I recognize my privilege to have access to trying as much as I do to try to get better. I’m thankful for this community and for reddit making me feel a little less lonely on this journey. For any of you with my similar symptoms, or story, please feel free to DM me. I see you and am with you.",12,1763356322.0,covidlonghaulers,2,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Netherlands vs. Lithuania: A Dutch Masterclass or a Lithuanian Miracle?**

Ah, the FIFA World Cup qualifiers—where nations clash, underdogs dream, and the Netherlands casually stroll into a match like they’re late for a coffee. On November 17, 2025, the Netherlands faces Lithuania in a qualifier that’s less of a contest and more of a Dutch team’s midweek nap. Let’s dissect the odds, news, and why this game might be the most one-sided since a toddler tried to play chess against a grandmaster.

### Parsing the Odds: The Math of a Foregone Conclusion

The bookmakers have spoken, and they’ve spoken *loudly*. The Netherlands is priced at **1.01 to 1.04**, which translates to an **implied probability of 96-99%** to win. Lithuania? A laughable **1.8-2.2%** chance (odds of 41-56). That’s the statistical equivalent of betting on a squirrel to beat Usain Bolt in a sprint. Even the “Draw” line is a 6-10% shot, which is about the same odds of me finally learning how to parallel park.

The total goals market? The “Under 3.5” is priced at 2.3, while the “Over” is 1.56. Given the Netherlands’ likely conservative approach, expect a low-scoring affair. Think of it as a Dutch oven (pun intended) simmering on low—efficient, predictable, and with zero surprises.

### Digesting the News: Kluivert Out, Netherlands Out of the Frying Pan

The Netherlands has already secured qualification, so this is a “let’s not break a sweat” game. But here’s the kicker: **Justin Kluivert is out** with an injury sustained during a match against Poland. The Dutch team, already a well-oiled machine, now loses a forward who’s more reliable than a Swiss watch… if the Swiss watch only has one gear.

Lithuania, meanwhile, is playing their final qualifier. They’ve g

In the early 1900s, the boll weevil swept into the American South from Mexico, destroying cotton crops everywhere it went. Enterprise, like most of Coffee County, depended almost entirely on cotton. When the weevil arrived around 1915, it devastated the local economy, wiping out the region’s primary source of income.

But instead of collapsing permanently, Enterprise was forced to diversify its agriculture. Farmers planted peanuts and other crops to survive. This shift actually made the area much more prosperous than it had ever been on cotton alone. By 1917–1919, Coffee County became one of the top peanut-growing regions in America.

I (M18) am spiteful and irritated by it because I feel like they dont trust me at all to basically take care of myself to a certain degree


Hello, I apologize if this is the wrong sub to ask this question, and I will remove it if asked to do so. Its just, this one has been bugging my mind for quite some time now and I have no idea where or who to ask

For context, my parents both came from a family oriented culture, family always comes first before anything and anyone. Now, I do understand the importance of family supporting each other, its just, often times I get irritated by how my parents view this sometimes. My parents seem to think that it is their job to protect us and prevent us from making mistakes and therefore they often try to involve themselves in our lives to a point where it feels like they are either too attached, micro managing us, or both

For instance, I remember one night when me and my mom were coming home from getting some groceries, she was telling me about the importance of letting them know where we are or who were with at all times, even when we are adults. Basically saying that ""if something happens to us"" they know our last known location or who to speak to. Many times when I came home late at night from the gym, or to hang out with a friend I often got scolded by my parents who kept telling me how I was gonna get kidnapped, mugged or beaten by some bum on the street. If im going somewhere they want to know the exact address or the names of who im going out with or they get really irritated if I dont tell them much about it. If im going to catch a trainbearly in the morning, my parents have to know about or they will worry too much. If im going to catch an Uber, my mom will watch me like a hawk and won't leave until I get in. Just the other night, I heard my parents arguing with my sister (she is 25 years old) who lives in another country for not letting them know where she was all night and it came to a point where they had to text her friend where she was, then proceeded to give her a lecture about how dangerous some areas in the city could be and why she has to let them know where she is when they ask her. (From what I got out of that argument, she was studying in a coffee shop with friends for an exam, and later went to have a sleep over at their house).

Another irritating for me is when they tell me they have a right to get involved in my decision making ""and guide me to make the right choice"". Now, im only 18 years old, and given I dont know much about the world I think there is a level validity to this thought process. Its just, the way conversations like this normally goes is that, if im  not making a decision that they like or can accept, im automatically wrong. My first time making a major decision for myself was when I decided I am going to enlist in the military, when I first tried to have a real conversation with them it didn't take long before I got called crazy and stupid. Despite me doing all my research, connecting with veterans and reading about their experiences, and taking my time to weigh the pros and cons they told me that none of that mattered because I was still ""a kid"" and ""too young"" to make decisions for myself. That because they were my parents, they knew more than me because they had more life experience, they were right and I was wrong even if I had done more research than them. I was called disrespectful, inconsiderate of their feelings, the reason they would die early, ignorant, and at one point they started discussing if they should schedule me to see a therapist to make sure that I dont have Any psychological issues that is making me ""choose suicide"", which really pissed me off. Their excuse for saying all this when I confronted them about it? ""They love me and care for me, so its natural for them to worry""

Now, im only 18 and dont have a lot of world experiences. I dont understand what its like to be a parent, and im probably willfully ignorant, spiteful, irrational and immature to a certain degree regarding this topic. I also have to admit that I am probably being unfair to how I represented my parents in this post as they are good people and I can see they really love me and my siblings and want the best for us, and I myself have been incredibly rude and disrespectful to them at times. Its just, their views on making sure that that I am safe at all times, making sure that they ""guide me to the right path"" at all times, makes me feel insulted. It makes me feel that they don't trust me to be independent to a certain degree, that they dont trust me to think for myself  and make some good decisions, that they don't trust me to take care of myself, and that all they can see in me is a small fragile boy that is in need of their protection and guidance 24/7. I am spiteful of it because in my opinion, their protective mentality has left me underdeveloped socially compared to a lot of people my age, and their inability to understand that combined with their protectivenedd has made me lose trust and comfort in opening up to them about anything at all

But hey, maybe im missing something, maybe I just don't understand something and maybe im too close minded. What do you guys think? Im open to hear your thoughts and criticism on whether or not im justified and thinking and feeling this way",3,1763356019.0,Parenting,6,0.8,False
1oz7p2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNow/comments/1oz7p2h/stop_saying_regret_does_anyone_have_a_link_for/,Stop Saying Regret -does anyone have a link for this,"The day after Nina Powell's brother, Isaac Powell, attended her lavish birthday party, scandalous photos of Paulina Larsen—the noble heiress of New York—flooded the internet.

Paulina swore it was Isaac who leaked them. She brought her people, shattered every bone in Isaac's body, and tossed him into the ocean to feed the sharks.

Nina filed a lawsuit against the tyrannical Paulina, but it was immediately crushed—because the man pulling strings behind the scenes was Lloyd Foust, the most powerful kingpin in the city.

He was also Nina's husband of six years, a man who had once loved her.

""Baby, your brother bullied Paulie first. He got what he deserved. Stop making trouble,"" Lloyd said, siding with Paulina. He believed her story. But Nina didn't.

Dressed in mourning black, Nina clung to Isaac's photo and livestreamed for 99 days straight, stirring up public outrage. With the weight of public opinion behind her, she petitioned the court to release the yacht's surveillance footage from that day.

Lloyd locked her in the basement for seven days straight, making sure she missed the court date.

When she was finally freed, Nina immediately prepared to file her third appeal.

That night, Lloyd dug up Isaac's ashes, set them over the fire, and threatened Nina to sign the settlement.

He shoved her toward the flames, the urn teetering on its rack.

""Baby, you've pushed this slander against Paulie too far. Keep going, and your brother won't have anything left.""

He tossed his expensive cigar carelessly to the floor, his long fingers tracing her chin with a gentle touch. His eyes were soft.

But every word he spoke cut like a knife, leaving her bleeding inside.

Nina stared at him, refusing to look away. ""Why? Have you forgotten Isaac saved your life?""

During a disastrous international deal, Isaac had shielded Lloyd from 50 stab wounds, then spent three years in a coma.

Lloyd spent millions tracking down the culprit, tearing him apart piece by piece. He once said that anyone who hurt Isaac was his enemy.

But now, Lloyd's patience had run out. ""Paulie saved my life. Anyone who messes with her is my enemy—including you and Isaac.""

Nina bit her lip so hard she nearly drew blood. She couldn't understand how things had come to this.

This was a man who had once loved her with everything he had.

Six years ago, if not for Lloyd, she would have died in a remote mountain town.

Her parents died when she was born, and Isaac raised her on his own.

To make ends meet, Isaac dropped out of school and moved to New York for work. Thanks to his imposing figure, he was hired as Lloyd's bodyguard.

After taking the knife for Lloyd, Isaac begged him to bring his little sister to New York.

So Lloyd led a team deep into the impoverished mountains and met 18-year-old Nina—a girl so pure and beautiful that, for the first time, the hardened man felt his heart skip a beat.

He fell for her instantly and confessed his feelings right there.

Nina, shy and timid, didn't dare respond.

Lloyd decided to bring her back and let their relationship grow. But then, the townsfolk came with knives to stop him.

Women were scarce in the mountains. Nina's beauty had been coveted for years. They planned to use her in turns, then sell her for a hefty price.

The two groups fought for a whole day. Lloyd took 30 knife wounds but managed to rescue Nina, barely alive and still comforting her, ""It's okay, sweetheart. You're safe now.""

That one gentle word was all it took—Nina was lost to him.

After Lloyd recovered, they got married.

He taught her how to use knives and guns, how to survive, how to have dignity and self-respect—slowly transforming her from a timid girl into a confident woman.

Lloyd gave her the best of everything. When it came to Nina, he was always there.

Nina loved New York. She thought she'd always be happy with Lloyd and Isaac.

But dreams are fragile.

Lloyd's cold voice shattered her memories from above. ""Stop stalling. Your brother doesn't have time.""

Still, Nina clung to hope, wondering if Lloyd had any love left for her. ""If I don't sign, will you really burn Isaac's ashes?""

Lloyd didn't bother with a real answer, simply clicking his tongue in arrogant impatience.

""Baby, Paulie took a fatal knife for me. I promised her a year by my side. Didn't I tell you? She's my bottom line. Everyone has to accommodate her. Why do you insist on going against her?""

Paulina and Lloyd had grown up together—she'd chased after him for ten years. But he'd married Nina in a whirlwind, and Paulina hated Nina for it, having her kidnapped and tortured for ten days straight.

Nina would never forget the whips that lashed her skin, the toothpicks shoved under her nails, the steel needles piercing her flesh... Paulina even took away her first child.

For that, Lloyd broke ties with the Larsen family, using every trick to send Paulina to prison for three years.

Nina thought Paulina would vanish like the nightmares from the mountain town. But a year ago, Lloyd brought her back, declaring before all his men, ""For the next year, Paulie will also be your boss. Her power will surpass everyone's.""

He'd forgotten everything Paulina had done to Nina.

Nina sobbed, demanding answers, but Lloyd didn't care. ""Loyalty is everything in our world. I'm just repaying a debt, Baby. She won't affect you.""

Nina fell silent, knowing she had no right to refuse. She could only wait for Lloyd's debt to be repaid. Instead, she received news of Isaac's death.

She swallowed her bitterness. ""I'll sign. Just let Isaac go.""

Lloyd patted her head. ""That's my good girl.""

He picked up the urn, and Nina sighed in relief, reaching out for it.

But in the next instant, Lloyd flicked his wrist—the ashes spilled into the fire.

""No—!""

Nina screamed in despair, lunging for the flames, but the bodyguards held her back.

Lloyd looked down at her, cold and merciless. ""Baby, you crossed my line. This is your punishment.""

Nina glared at him through tear-filled eyes, her heart trembling with pain. ""Lloyd, I'm leaving you...""

Just now, whatever love she had left for him burned away with Isaac's ashes.

In that moment, Lloyd's smile vanished, his expression turning terrifyingly cold. ""You think you can leave? There's a tracker implanted in you. Even if you run to the ends of the earth, I'll find you.

""So just be good, won't you?""

Nina shivered to her core.

He'd implanted the tracker to protect her from enemies. But now, it had become his weapon to hurt her without restraint.

After Lloyd left, Nina sat by the fire all night, clutching the ashes. At dawn, she dialed the only number Lloyd couldn't monitor.

""Mr. Granholm, can you help me fake my death and escape?""

Leaving Lloyd alive was impossible. Faking her death and starting over was her only chance.

Marco Granholm didn't hesitate. ""Isaac did more for me than anyone. I'd risk my life to get you out!""

Once Lloyd's right-hand man, Marco had split off for reasons unknown, building his own empire overseas.

With Marco's help, her chances doubled.

""But Mrs. Foust, the tracker inside you is complicated. I'll need a month to make a duplicate.""

As long as she could get away, Nina would wait—not just a month, but a year if she had to.

Chapter 2

Nina set up an empty tomb for Isaac. She bought a bottle of bourbon and picked a few wildflowers by the roadside to place before the grave.

By the time she got home, dusk had settled in.

Suddenly, Paulina's laughter rang out, sharp and unexpected. ""Mr. Foust, easy now, you're hurting me.""

She was wearing a micro-mini slip dress, her chest covered with kiss marks.

Lloyd gripped her chin, about to kiss her, but stopped abruptly when he caught sight of Nina.

Nina didn't spare them a glance, heading straight upstairs.

But Lloyd's cold voice stopped her. ""Freeze! Get over here!""

Nina hesitated for two seconds, then obediently walked over.

Lloyd had run with the underworld long enough to expect absolute obedience. He hated anyone who defied him. Before leaving, Nina didn't want to stir up trouble, so she swallowed her pride and approached him.

But the next moment, Lloyd ordered, ""Apologize to Paulie!""

Nina bit her lip so hard she tasted blood. He was actually asking her to apologize to the woman who killed Isaac.

She couldn't do it.

Lloyd stood, anger flaring, but Paulina tugged his sleeve. ""Enough, Mr. Foust. I don't blame Mrs. Foust. Don't force her.""

He brushed a kiss across Paulina's lips, his voice hoarse. ""Paulie always knows how to behave.""

Then, he pressed her closer, deepening the kiss, his hands wandering under her clothes—utterly indifferent to the humiliation of his own wife standing nearby.

Even though she'd already decided to leave, Nina's heart twisted in pain.

She tried to go upstairs to rest, but the housekeeper blocked her way. ""I'm sorry, Mrs. Foust. Mr. Foust says Ms. Larsen was frightened by your accusations and needs to stay here for a few days. She's chosen the primary bedroom. Please move to the basement for now.""

Nina smiled faintly. It didn't matter anymore.

She didn't care about a bedroom. She didn't even want Lloyd anymore.

In the middle of the night, Nina was jolted awake by a scream.

She recognized it instantly—it was her dog. ""Teddy!"" Nina burst out of her room, frantic.

In the living room, Paulina was directing her friends, who were slashing at Teddy with knives.

The malice in Paulina's eyes brought back every nightmare Nina had ever had.

Just because Lloyd had once complimented Nina's piano playing, Paulina had taken a knife and sliced her fingers—one thousand times—ensuring she could never play again.

Nina trembled uncontrollably, trauma flooding back. Teddy let out another agonized yelp.

Forcing herself past her fear of Paulina, Nina rushed forward, shoving Paulina aside and gathering Teddy's bleeding body into her arms.

Paulina hadn't expected Nina to fight back. Her pretty face twisted with rage. ""You bitch! How dare you touch me! Teach her a lesson!""

Bang!

Someone grabbed a bottle and smashed it over Nina's head.

Blood poured down her face, but she clung to Teddy, using her body as a shield.

The bottle came down a second time, harder than before.

Nina's vision blurred, but she bit her tongue, refusing to collapse.

A third blow was about to fall when a cold male voice rang out from the doorway. ""Who dares hit my wife? Are you out of your mind?""

Lloyd strode in, gun raised, aiming at the attacker's head.

Paulina instantly threw herself in front of him, sobbing theatrically. ""Mr. Foust, Mrs. Foust set her dog on me. My friends were just standing up for me. It's all my fault—I shouldn't have stayed here and upset Mrs. Foust. I'll leave...""

She took a step, but Lloyd yanked her back.

""You're my savior. No one has the right to send you away. Paulie, I'll make sure you get justice for this.""

Lloyd walked over, his gaze icy as he stared at Teddy.

In that moment, Nina understood what he was about to do. She shook her head desperately. ""Loy, Teddy didn't bite her! Check the security cameras—there's proof!""

But Lloyd ignored her, his lips curling into a cruel smile. ""Baby, mistakes have consequences.""

He snatched Teddy from her arms and slammed it to the ground.

Teddy whimpered, coughed up a mouthful of blood, and died.

""No!"" Nina screamed, crawling over to cradle Teddy's lifeless body, her eyes blazing at Lloyd. ""You killed our child! I hate you!""

Years ago, after Paulina had caused her to lose her first child, Nina had fallen into depression. Lloyd had bought Teddy to cheer her up, and with Teddy's companionship, she'd slowly healed.

Lloyd had once said, ""Teddy is our child. I'll love him forever.""

But now, just because of Paulina's accusation, he'd killed the dog they'd raised for six years, without even checking the facts.

With trembling hands, Nina closed Teddy's eyes.

The moment Teddy died, her heart for Lloyd died too.

Chapter 3

Nina cried until she was completely spent, her sobs wracking her body. For a moment, Lloyd felt a pang of guilt and stepped forward instinctively to help her up. ""Come on, sweetheart, let me get you cleaned up.""

But she pushed him away, her face expressionless.

Irritation flickered across Lloyd's face; he wanted to say more.

Nina didn't even glance at him. She cradled Teddy's lifeless body and walked outside, heading straight for the sycamore—Teddy's favorite spot to lounge in the shade.

With her bare hands, Nina dug a shallow grave, gently placed her dog inside, and covered it with earth.

""Teddy, rest easy...""

She pulled out a lighter and tossed it onto the wooden doghouse.

Lloyd had built that doghouse himself six years ago, sanding and polishing every plank, working on it for ten months before it was finished.

Now, flames consumed it, turning it to ash—just like the dream she'd held onto for six years.

Next, Nina grabbed an axe and swung at the sycamore. Lloyd had planted it for her, saying sycamores symbolized longevity, a love that would never fade.

But now, his love felt like nothing but a cruel joke.

With the final blow, the sycamore split and crashed to the ground. In that moment, Nina severed the last of her attachment.

""Lloyd, from this day forward, I don't love you anymore!"" she said inwardly.

All it took was Paulina claiming she'd been frightened, and Lloyd canceled multimillion-dollar deals just to stay home with her. He tied her apron, held her on his lap, spoon-fed her at every meal, and gently wiped her mouth afterward—doing everything he used to do for Nina.

For seven days, their shameless flirtation was on full display, but Nina didn't care. She spent every day kneeling on a prayer mat, saying prayers so Teddy's soul could find peace.

On the seventh day after Teddy's death, Nina finished her final prayer. The basement door opened.

Lloyd walked in with Paulina in his arms. His voice was cool. ""Take off your wedding ring and give it to Paulie.""

Nina froze, staring at him in disbelief. ""Lloyd, do you even know what you're saying?""

He barely blinked. ""Paulie saved my life. If she wants something and I can afford it, she'll have it.""

Nina clenched her fists so tight her nails dug into her palms.

How absurd. The diamond ring on her finger was custom-made by Lloyd—one of a kind. When he slipped it on her hand, he'd smiled indulgently, ""Baby, you're my one and only. As long as we love each other, you're never allowed to take it off.""

Nina had obeyed. For six years, even when her finger was injured and bandaged, she never removed it.

She thought their love would last forever. She thought she'd never have to take it off.

But now, to please another woman, he was forcing her to give up her wedding ring.

Suddenly, Nina laughed—a bitter, hollow sound. She laughed at how short Lloyd's promises were, at how quickly his love had vanished.

""Fine,"" she said quietly.

Lloyd was taken aback, not expecting her to agree so easily. His throat tightened, and he tried to stop her. ""Baby, wait—""

But Nina slipped off the ring and tossed it to the floor. ""If she wants secondhand goods, let her pick it up herself.""

Without another word, she turned and walked away.

She hadn't made it to the front gates of the Foust's residence before the guards forced her to her knees.

Lloyd's voice rang out behind her, cold and menacing. ""I've spoiled you too much, let you get away with everything, and now you dare defy me right in front of my face.""

The butler handed him a wooden rod covered in spikes—the kind used to punish disobedient staff. Lloyd raised the stick, his tone icy. ""Apologize! I told you, everyone must respect Paulie. You're no exception.""

Nina's body shook. She couldn't believe Lloyd's favoritism for Paulina had gone this far. Tears burned in her eyes as she stared him down, stubborn to the end. ""I did nothing wrong. I won't apologize.""

Paulina clung to Lloyd's arm, sobbing. ""Mr. Foust, Mrs. Foust is just upset about how well you treat me. She didn't mean to go against you. Please don't be angry with her.""

Her words only made things worse—Lloyd hated being defied.

Sure enough, the next moment, the rod—thick as a man's arm—came crashing down on Nina's back.

The first blow made her cough up blood. Dazed, she remembered the day she first met Lloyd, when he picked wildflowers from the roadside and knelt before her. ""Little girl, I like you. Be my girlfriend.""

Back then, his eyes were so sincere.

The second blow sent darkness swimming before her eyes, pain nearly making her faint. She remembered five years ago, when an enemy had kidnapped her and threatened Lloyd, demanding he break his own legs. He didn't hesitate—he swung the knife at himself.

He'd loved her so fiercely.

The third blow finally made her lose consciousness. As she slipped into oblivion, she thought she saw Lloyd at their wedding, tears of joy streaming down his face as he swore, ""Baby, I'll treat you well for the rest of my life.""

But he'd broken his promise. He'd broken every promise.

For another woman, he beat her until she was battered and broken.

Nina lay in bed for seven days before she could even stand.

The first time she managed to walk into the yard, Paulina strode over, her face smug with triumph. She flaunted the wedding ring on her finger. ""Now both Mr. Foust's body and heart belong to me.""

Nina's face was unreadable. ""If you want him, he's yours.""

Paulina was startled, then slapped Nina hard across the face. ""You bitch! Mr. Foust was always mine. You seduced him away from me.""

Nina's calm only made Paulina angrier. She raised her hand again, but caught sight of Lloyd approaching. Quickly, she snatched off the ring and flung it into the water.

Then she threw herself into Lloyd's arms, sobbing. ""Mr. Foust, Mrs. Foust bullied me. She threw away the ring you gave me. She said I'm not worthy...""

Instantly, Lloyd's eyes blazed with anger. ""Nina, do you have anything to say for yourself?""

Nina met his gaze, her voice flat. ""Would you believe me if I did?""

Lloyd's lips curled into a cold smile. ""No. I only believe Paulie.""

Nina was shoved into the water to retrieve the ring.

Darkness and cold swallowed her whole.

As a child, the townsfolk used to dunk her in water for fun, leaving her with a crippling fear of it. Lloyd had drained every pond at the villa for her—until last year, when Paulina wanted to grow lotus flowers, and he relented.

Now, Nina was on the verge of drowning. She fought desperately to reach the surface, finally dragging herself onto the bank—only to hear Paulina's cries. ""Mr. Foust, Mrs. Foust doesn't seem willing...""

""She doesn't get a choice."" Lloyd's voice was merciless. He ordered the guards to beat her with bamboo poles whenever she surfaced.

Every time Nina tried to rise, she was struck back down.

The wounds on her back split open again, the icy water numbing her body.

But none of it hurt as much as her shattered heart.

""Lloyd, I regret ever loving you. I regret it so much.""

Chapter 4

Nina was unconscious for three days before she finally woke up.

The housekeeper tending to her breathed a sigh of relief. ""Mrs. Foust, you're awake at last. After you sank to the bottom three days ago, Mr. Foust was terrified. He held a gun to the doctor's head and swore that if you couldn't be saved, we'd all die with you.""

The housekeeper went on about how worried Lloyd had been, how much he loved her.

But Nina would never believe it again.

If he truly loved her, he wouldn't have brought that bully home for everyone to see.

If he truly loved her, he wouldn't have killed the dog that had been her emotional lifeline.

If he truly loved her, he wouldn't have forced her, knowing her fear of water, to be beaten into it over and over.

""Lloyd, stop lying to me!"" Nina thought bitterly.

Once the housekeeper was gone, Nina began writing her ""farewell letter.""

""Lloyd, by the time you open this letter, I'll probably be gone...""

She and Lloyd had promised to write each other love letters every year and open them together on their anniversary.

They'd kept that tradition for five years. But ever since Paulina saved his life last year, Lloyd hadn't written a single letter. Nina had written many letters, and he hadn't read a single one.

Nina placed her finished ""farewell letter"" in a box, then began burning the love letters, one by one.

By the time she reached the last letter, Lloyd burst into the room, his pupils contracting as he lunged for the fire, but he was too late.

""Baby, why are you burning the love letters?""

Looking at the blisters forming on his hand, Nina spoke calmly. ""They're old. I wrote new ones.""

Lloyd let out a breath, pushing down the unease in his chest, and reached for the box.

Nina stopped him. ""Wait for our anniversary.""

The anniversary was just three days after she planned to fake her death.

Their seventh wedding anniversary—Nina was going to give Lloyd a gift he'd never forget.

She'd heard that Isaac's spent bullet casing would be up for auction tonight. Taking her black card, she hurried to the event. As soon as she sat down, Lloyd arrived with Paulina and took the seats beside her.

He brushed Paulina's hair from her face, his gentle gaze no different than the way he used to look at Nina.

Their lips drew closer, about to meet in a kiss, when Nina cleared her throat. Lloyd froze, finally realizing Nina was sitting right there.

His expression flickered awkwardly, and he instinctively reached for her hand, but Nina pulled away.

Now, Lloyd's heart and mind were filled with Paulina—he barely saw Nina at all.

The first auction item was Isaac's bullet casing.

Paulina shot Nina a provocative look and cooed to Lloyd, ""Mr. Foust, I want it.""

Lloyd didn't hesitate. ""Of course, Paulie. Whatever you want, I'll buy it for you.""

Nina dug her nails into her palm, fighting back a surge of emotion, and pleaded softly, ""Loy, that's my brother's keepsake. Could you please—""

Before she could finish, Lloyd cut her off coldly. ""Baby, you're acting up again. How many times do I have to tell you? Paulie saved my life. I'm going to fulfill all her wishes this year.""

""But..."" Nina tried again.

His tone grew impatient. ""Enough. Don't make a scene.""

The auctioneer began the bidding. Lloyd immediately raised his paddle. ""One million dollars.""

Nina's palm was almost raw from gripping so tightly, her eyes blazing with determination. In the next instant, she stood and made a bold gesture—raising her hand high to signal the ultimate bid.

At this auction, that gesture meant she was going all in, no matter the cost. She would take the item, whatever the price, with no limit.

Paulina's face paled. ""Mr. Foust, I really want that...""

Lloyd shot Nina an annoyed look. ""Don't talk big, Nina. If you can't pay, don't embarrass yourself.""

Nina ignored him, stepping onto the stage and swiping her card for the transaction.

Lloyd sat up straighter, suddenly remembering he'd once given her an unlimited black card.

His eyes narrowed dangerously.

Just after Nina finished her ritual for Isaac, a notification popped up on her phone.

""Mr. Foust's little wife's 999 private photos will be auctioned as the grand finale tonight!""

Nina's blood ran cold.

Only Lloyd had those photos.

Was this his revenge?

She rushed back to the auction hall, and the moment she looked up, she saw Lloyd sitting on the platform, casually smiling down at her.

""Mr. Foust, you're really something. You once gouged out a man's eyes for looking at Mrs. Foust, but tonight you're putting her private photos up for everyone to see.""

Lloyd's smile was cruel. ""She made Paulie cry. This is her punishment.""

It felt as if a steel blade was twisting in Nina's heart, the pain nearly suffocating her.

Just because of Paulina, he was willing to let every man see her most private photos.

He'd always been possessive—if any man so much as looked at her, he'd lock her away, claiming her for himself, whispering again and again, ""Baby, you're mine. Your body is only for me.""

Nina bit her lip hard, forcing her tears back. Numb, she walked inside and, under the men's leering stares, pressed the auction button again and again.

With every press, her heart grew colder—until, at last, the part of her that had once loved Lloyd died completely.

She walked up to him, her face expressionless. ""Are you satisfied now?""

Lloyd glanced at her pale face and gave a mocking smile. ""Sorry, not yet.""

Nina soon understood what he meant.

He had frozen her card.

She couldn't pay, and her private photos would be released for anyone to see.

In disbelief, she looked at Lloyd, her eyes full of despair. He just sneered, ""Baby, if you don't learn the consequences of defying me, how will you ever behave?""

Nina's heart was dead, and she closed her eyes in agony.

She thought it was finally over, but it was only the beginning.

Lloyd even posted every shameful detail of her past in the poor mountain town online!

Chapter 5

Nina grew up in a remote mountain town infamous for human trafficking. She and her mother had been abducted there together. Nina witnessed, with her own eyes, her mother being humiliated to death by the townsfolk.

After coming to New York, Lloyd had hired countless therapists to help her heal.

It took six years for Nina to finally crawl out of the shadows of her past—only for her own husband, the man who claimed to love her, to rip open her deepest wounds and put them on display for the world to see.

Nina's PTSD hit her like a freight train. She collapsed to her knees, gasping for air, her entire body shaking uncontrollably.

The gossip about her grew uglier by the minute.

""Ms. Powell actually grew up in a place like that? She's probably been passed around by every man in town. No wonder she got Mr. Foust hooked. She must be incredible in bed.""

Some people even threw money at her, asking how much she charged for a night.

Lloyd saw it all. He glanced at her with icy indifference, then walked away hand in hand with Paulina, letting the crowd humiliate Nina without once looking back.

Nina didn't even know how she made it home. She collapsed on her bed, her eyes blank and lifeless.

Her depression gnawed at her body, and for a moment, she wished she could just end it all.

Her phone rang several times before she finally answered. ""Mrs. Foust, your fake corpse is ready. Once the tracker is finished in two weeks, you can leave.""

Marco's assurance helped steady her nerves.

Staring at the ceiling, Nina's resolve hardened.

No. She was going to survive this.

She wouldn't die for a scumbag like Lloyd—he wasn't worth it.

The butler informed her that there was a charity gala she had to attend.

The moment she arrived, a man approached her, sleazily and boldly. ""Mrs. Foust, I've seen all your private photos. Ms. Larsen said you're cheap—20 dollars for the whole night.""

Nina trembled. ""Get lost!""

But the man grabbed her, dragging her toward the stairwell.

Nina struggled, her clothes torn by rough hands. Just then, Lloyd's furious voice cut through the chaos. ""What the hell are you doing?""

The man dropped to his knees. ""Mr. Foust, your wife seduced me! She said if you can have Ms. Larsen, she should be allowed to have men too. She begged me to sleep with her, just to piss you off.

""Mr. Foust, I swear I'm not lying. Mrs. Foust has been with plenty of men before me—I'm her 100th.""

Paulina lowered her eyes, a flash of malice passing through them—Nina caught it in an instant. Suddenly, she understood, this was Paulina's trap.

""Loy, it's Paulina! She set me up!""

But before she could say another word, a sharp pain shot through her belly—Lloyd had kicked her down the stairs. ""Nina, you're getting bolder by the day.""

He was smiling, but his eyes were murderously cold.

Paulina gasped, ""Mr. Foust, Mrs. Foust is bleeding! What if she's pregnant with someone else's child?""

Lloyd's smile twisted, his jaw clenched so tight it looked like he might snap his own teeth.

Nina was dragged back home.

The doctor examined her, hands trembling. After half an hour, he barely managed to speak. ""Mr. Foust, Mrs. Foust is indeed pregnant.""

Lloyd kicked the coffee table aside, grabbed Nina by the chin, and snarled, ""Whose is it?""

Nina was just as shocked. Facing Lloyd's predatory stare, she knew she had to be clear. ""It's yours. It must be from that night in the garden, three months ago.""

No sooner had she spoken than his hand crashed across her face.

The blow was brutal—her lip split and bled.

He seized her by the throat. ""Still lying to me? After we slept together, I made sure you got birth control shots. How could you possibly be pregnant with my child?""

What?

Nina was stunned.

Paulina spoke up. ""Mr. Foust promised me that while he was with me, he wouldn't let you get pregnant. So, Mrs. Foust, your baby can't possibly be his.""

Nina felt all the strength drain from her body. ""Lloyd... he actually agreed to something like that for Paulina?

""Lloyd, is this really just gratitude?""

He ordered his men to tie Nina to a wooden bench and began beating her stomach.

The stick landed again and again, the pain so fierce it nearly tore her apart. But Nina stopped fighting.

She knew—no matter what she said, Lloyd would never believe her.

By the 200th blow, her dress was soaked in blood, but she couldn't feel the pain anymore. When your heart dies, nothing else hurts.

Lloyd watched her the whole time. Seeing her hollow expression, he felt an inexplicable ache deep inside.

Suddenly, he shouted, ""Enough! Stop!""

He strode over to Nina.

Just then, Paulina cried out, ""Mr. Foust, I get faint at the sight of blood...""

She promptly collapsed.

Without hesitation, Lloyd scooped her up and rushed out.

As soon as he left, Nina collapsed to the floor, blood gushing from her lower body.

Agony crashed over her, her belly twisting in pain.

She begged the housekeeper to take her to the hospital, but without Lloyd's orders, no one dared help.

Nina bit down hard. No—she couldn't die today. Just two more weeks and she could escape!

She crawled out of the villa, leaving a trail of blood behind.

In the end, it was a stranger who called 911 for her.

""I'm sorry, Ms. Powell. Your uterus is destroyed—we have to remove it. If you'd come even a minute earlier, we could have saved it...""

Nina lay on the operating table, the harsh white lights stinging her eyes.

After a long, long time, she finally smiled.

It didn't matter—she never planned to marry again. Uterus or not, it was all the same.

From now on, she would live for herself.

Chapter 6

One week after Nina was discharged from the hospital, she was surrounded by a group of people in tattered clothing.

""Mrs. Foust, you promised you'd support us for life. Why did you sell the foundation?""

Nina had wanted to help people from disadvantaged backgrounds like herself, so Lloyd had set up a fund for her—the Nini Love Foundation.

She called Lloyd. ""Did you sell the Nini Love Foundation?""

He sounded utterly unconcerned. ""Paulie wanted a dress, and the seller specifically asked for the Nini Love Foundation. Baby, don't be so stingy.""

Nina pressed, ""Do you even remember what the foundation means?""

""It's just a fund, isn't it?"" Lloyd was clearly impatient. ""Only one more week and my year with Paulie is up. I'll buy it back for you then...""

Nina couldn't listen anymore.

She would never forget how, six years ago, Lloyd had solemnly promised her, ""The Nini Love Foundation is our pride and joy, like our child. Even if I go bankrupt, I'll never sell it.""

But now?

He'd killed their dog, then their unborn child, and now, for Paulina, he'd sold their other 'child'—the Nini Love Foundation.

""Lloyd, Lloyd... you're the one who's severed every last tie between us.

""From this moment on, there's nothing left between you and me!"" Nina thought.

Three days later was Nina's birthday. Maybe sensing her mood, Lloyd insisted on throwing her a grand party.

On her birthday, Lloyd arranged a drone show, covered the venue in rose petals, and stacked luxury handbags and designer clothes into mountains...

Nina didn't even glance at any of it.

He wrapped his arms around her waist from behind. ""Baby, stop thinking about that bastard. Cheer up. Once my year with Paulie is over, we'll have a child together.""

Lloyd didn't know—the child he'd killed was his own flesh and blood.

Nina had gotten a paternity test and paid the doctor a hefty sum to send the report to the Foust family after her death.

""Lloyd, if you ever learn the truth, will you regret it?"" she wondered.

Lloyd was about to say something else when a business partner called him away.

He'd barely left when Paulina approached, wine glass in hand.

""Nina, I bribed the doctor to switch out your birth control shots, then got a man to frame you for cheating. I had a whole list of tricks ready, but Mr. Foust believed me so easily. You know what that means? It means you're trash in his eyes!""

Nina's fingers trembled. Just yesterday, Marco had sent her a button camera, which she'd worn today.

Paulina thought she'd struck a nerve and grew even more smug. ""Weren't you always trying to find out what happened to your brother? Let me tell you—the photo scandal was my setup. That day, I broke every bone in his body. Blood covered the deck, his brain spilled out, and he was still calling your name.

""So before I threw him overboard, I told him, I'll be sending you after him soon.""

No sooner had she spoken than Paulina slapped herself, and Lloyd's cold voice sounded from behind.

""Nina, you're bullying Paulie again!""

""I didn't!""

""I saw everything!"" Lloyd ordered his men to hold Nina down, his eyes dangerous. ""Didn't I tell you? She's my bottom line. If you touch her again, I'll pay you back a hundredfold.""

Before Nina could react, the bodyguard's hand was already raised—

Smack!

The first slap landed, burning hot.

Then the second, the third...

Nina struggled desperately, her voice hoarse. ""Lloyd, you're blind and heartless!""

Lloyd was busy tending to Paulina's bruised cheek, his tone icy as he ordered, ""Keep going. Don't stop.""

Smack! Smack! Smack!

The bodyguard's grip was like iron, and Nina couldn't escape, no matter how she tried.

One slap after another rained down, faster than a storm.

Her ears rang, her face felt like it was on fire, but she bit down hard, refusing to make a sound.

When Lloyd finished applying medicine to Paulina's face, he asked casually, ""How many?""

""Ninety-nine.""

Lloyd narrowed his eyes, smiling. ""Let's make it an even hundred.""

The last slap knocked Nina to the floor, where she coughed up a mouthful of blood.

Her cheeks were swollen, her lips split, her face streaked with tears—she looked utterly miserable.

But she was smiling.",2,1763355994.0,NovelNow,0,1.0,False

FKW  AI and the Future of Franchising | Reddit Insight Post 2026 

 

A few years ago, choosing a franchise location meant intuition, experience, and a little luck. Now, every pitch deck screams: “Our AI predicts your next profitable city!” From real-estate platforms to franchise portals, predictive franchising analytics has become the new buzzword. These tools promise to tell investors exactly where to expand, which cities have high ROI potential, and how fast a market will saturate. 

Sounds smart, right? But here’s the uncomfortable truth: AI might know data, but it doesn’t know your street. 

What Predictive Franchising Actually Means 

Predictive franchising uses algorithms to analyze huge datasets, demographics, income levels, spending habits, even delivery-app usage  to forecast which regions are “ready” for a brand. 

A platform might tell you: 

* “Patna is ready for 5 more premium cafés.” 
* “Nagpur has untapped EV demand.” 
* “Indore’s female wellness market will grow 28% next year.” 

It feels futuristic  but the catch is, these predictions are only as good as the data they’re trained on. 

The Promise: Why Everyone’s Falling for the Hype 

AI has real strengths, no doubt. 

* Speed: It can process what would take a human months  in seconds. 
* Scale: It can analyze entire states, not just a few pin codes. 
* Objectivity: It removes emotional bias (the “I like this city” effect). 
* Visualization: Dashboards make complex market data look easy to digest. 

For large chains like Domino’s, KFC, and Tanishq, predictive analytics is already saving crores by optimizing store locations and inventory. 

But for small investors or new franchisees, the line between insight and illusion is blurry. 

The Data Dilemma - Garbage In, Garbage Out 

Most predictive tools in India rely on: 

* Census data (often outdated), 
* Delivery and transaction patterns (from limited metros), 
* Google mobility and keyword trends. 

The problem? Semi-urban India is still a mystery to the algorithm. 

When the AI says “Jhansi is ready for a spa,” it doesn’t know the nearest mall’s parking has been under renovation for a year, or that local cultural norms make weekend spa visits rare. 

The ground reality that seasoned entrepreneurs sense in five minutes AI still can’t measure. 

The Over-Automation Trap 

Entrepreneurs are starting to treat AI reports as gospel. That’s dangerous. 

One investor I spoke to literally said, “The heat map said Surat is green so we invested.” Six months later, their outlet was struggling because the competition map didn’t show unregistered local players. 

AI isn’t lying; it’s blindly confident. 

When we stop questioning predictions, we outsource not just analysis, but accountability. 

The Hybrid Approach -  Humans + Machines 

The smartest franchise investors I’ve seen use AI tools like a compass, not a GPS. 

They let data narrow the field  then rely on human intelligence to walk the terrain. 

A good system looks like this: 

* AI filters [top 10 potential cities](http://www.franchisebazar.com/) based on income and demand. 
* Human research checks logistics, culture, and spending habits. 
*  Pilot launch tests customer response before full rollout. 

It’s collaboration, not substitution. 

AI predicts; humans interpret. 

Inside the New Tools - What’s Out There in 2026 

Some of the top predictive franchising tools in India right now include: 

* FranchiseIQ: Uses AI-driven location scoring and competitor density mapping. 
* RetailPulse.ai: Integrates POS and consumer mobility data. 
* Maplytics: Offers demographic heatmaps for Tier-2 and Tier-3 expansion. 
* FranchiseBazar’s internal FKW Engine: Combines brand history and ROI models to suggest compatible territories. 

These tools work beautifully if you already understand the market; they magnify insight, not replace it. 

Why Investors Still Need Gut Instinct 

AI can’t feel human patterns  the way a city’s rhythm changes after 6 PM, the difference between a “shopping crowd” and a “buying crowd.” 

* You still need instinct to read: 
* Local festivals that boost footfall. 
* Family spending psychology. 
* The social proof that turns walk-ins into loyal customers. 

Data predicts averages; business lives in exceptions. 

*  Common AI-Driven Mistakes New Franchisees Make 
* Ignoring Offline Data: No algorithm can account for municipal projects, road closures, or hyper-local traffic shifts. 
*  Over-relying on Historical Trends: Markets evolve faster than datasets. 
* Confusing “Interest” with “Intent”: A thousand Google searches don’t equal a thousand buyers. 
* Forgetting Seasonality: Algorithms treat every month equally; humans know wedding or festival seasons change everything. 
* Skipping Pilot Validation: Data without real testing is just theory with good graphics. 

What Good Predictive Franchising Actually Looks Like 

A genuine AI-assisted decision involves three layers of verification 

* Macro Check: Does demographic and income data justify demand? 
* Micro Check: What’s the exact street-level competition and accessibility? 
* Behavioral Check: Are consumers emotionally ready for the product category? 

Only when all three align does a franchise truly find its sweet spot. 

The Ethical Question - Who Owns the Prediction? 

Here’s something rarely discussed: when an AI tool recommends a city and the outlet fails, who’s responsible? 

The brand? The platform? The investor? 

Right now, nobody knows  because India’s predictive franchise contracts are still evolving. 

Some franchisors quietly use AI data to justify franchise fees without guaranteeing outcomes. It’s why investors need to read the fine print twice and ask: 

“Is this prediction advice or a performance claim?” 

The difference determines your liability. 

The Psychological Trap - Data Comfort vs. [Business Chaos](http://www.sparkleminds.com/) 

Data gives comfort. Charts make us feel in control. But business remains messy. 

AI can tell you where potential exists; it can’t tell you how patient you’ll be when sales fluctuate. 

The illusion of certainty can make investors underestimate real-world hustle. The truth is, data never removes risk, it only refines it. 

Predictive franchising can make your plan smarter, but only you can make it work. 

The Future - AI Will Get Better, But So Must We 

By 2030, predictive models will evolve. 

They’ll track live POS data, weather patterns, cultural events, even emotional sentiment from local social media. 

But until then, human fieldwork will stay irreplaceable. 

The next phase of franchise success belongs to those who blend AI’s precision with intuition’s depth. 

The winners won’t be the ones who have the best algorithm, they'll be the ones who ask the best questions. 

Lessons for 2026 Franchise Investors 

If you’re eyeing franchise expansion this year, remember these ground rules: 

* Use AI to shortlist, not decide. 
* Validate every prediction with local experts. 
* Negotiate flexible territory clauses markets evolve faster than models. 
* Build a human network of mentors, suppliers, and managers who see what data can’t. 
* Track your own data once the outlet opens; your numbers will beat any external model. 

Predictive tools are helpful assistants, not business oracles. 

The Real ROI -  Intelligence, Not Just Information 

The real value of predictive franchising isn’t in the maps or dashboards, it's in what you learn while analyzing them. 

They force you to understand your audience better, think strategically about territory, and use numbers to support intuition. 

That learning is the true ROI, not just the projected profit. 

Bonus Insight  Why AI Still Can’t Replace the “Local Genius” 

Let’s be honest: some of the best franchise owners in India didn’t need an algorithm to find success. They had something that AI can't download from the local genius. 

That’s the guy who knows that people in Jaipur buy sweets after gold purchases, so he opens a bakery near a jewelry store. Or the woman in Coimbatore who realized that after-work gym traffic peaks near IT parks, not in main markets, and built her wellness franchise right next to a co-working hub. 

These instincts don’t come from data dashboards, they come from living inside a community. 

AI tools, no matter how advanced, still lack contextual depth. They see numbers but not nuance. 

For example: 

An algorithm might flag Patna as “high potential for café franchises” because youth spending on food is rising. But what it can’t tell is that local tea stalls have deep-rooted emotional loyalty. You can’t disrupt that just by selling cold brew. 

It might say Kanpur is “ready for EV showrooms,” ignoring the fact that charging infrastructure is inconsistent across districts. 

Every successful franchise story I’ve heard had one thing in common: someone on the ground who understood emotions, not just economics. 

AI gives you where and when. People give you why. 

Even the smartest predictive models often miss soft data things like customer hesitation, unspoken habits, or social perception. You’ll never find that in a CSV file. 

And that’s where local genius wins. It’s that emotional radar that helps you adapt. Maybe your franchise café doesn’t click because of pricing, but because your city still prefers filter coffee over cappuccinos. 

In 2026, the best investors won’t be the ones who fight AI, they'll be the ones who teach it. They’ll feed local learnings back into the model, making the data smarter over time. That’s how predictive franchising will truly evolve not as a tool that replaces us, but one that learns from us. 

So yes, trust AI  but verify it with chai. Talk to shopkeepers, walk through the neighborhood, and visit your competitors’ outlets. Data doesn’t breathe, but people do. 

At the end of the day, no algorithm can sense the smell of an evening market, the laughter of college students outside your store, or the rhythm of a festival rush. Those are the invisible signals that make or break a franchise. 

Because franchising just like AI  is ultimately about pattern recognition. But the best patterns are the ones you can feel, not just calculate. 

Final Takeaway -  AI Can Point the Way, But You Drive the Car 

AI has changed how we look at expansion. 

It’s smarter, faster, and more accessible than ever but it still lacks one essential factor: judgment. 

So yes, use predictive tools. Learn from them. But don’t hand over your steering wheel. 

Because franchising, at its heart, is still about people, their habits, their hopes, and their hometowns. 

And no algorithm can feel that pulse better than you. 

Data can predict the path but only experience can choose the right turn.

## **A. Public Space Saturation**

*When a space is already full of regular life, hate groups become background furniture.*

* **Early birds take the seats:** Book clubs, knitting circles, journaling groups, chess players. Ordinary people doing ordinary things.
* **Bench saturation:** Elders on benches, teens on skateboards, workers on lunch. Nothing dramatic — just no empty corners left.
* **Dog-walk loops:** Rotating dog-walkers passing through every ten minutes. A living timer that keeps extremist groups from settling in.
* **Park blanket grid:** Families, picnics, frisbee. A cheerful sea of small talk and snacks leaves no room for posturing.
* **Bus-stop bustle:** Intentionally choosing busy transit hubs so extremists can’t stand around unnoticed.
* **Stroller traffic:** Parents gathering for coffee strolls. Hard to radicalize when surrounded by Goldfish crackers and juice boxes.

---

## **B. Restaurant & Café Density Moves**

*Legal. Polite. Annoying in the way an overbooked brunch is annoying.*

* **Mass reservations:** A legitimate reunion, club meeting, or birthday gathering takes every table legally available.
* **Lingering orders:** Tea refills, dessert rounds, slow conversations. Perfectly permissible; very effective.
* **Window-seat takeover:** Groups choosing seats that extremists hope to use for visibility. Nothing left but the awkward corner.
* **Patio occupancy:** Full patios mean fewer places for speeches and “casual recruitment.”
* **Take-out line surge:** Ordinary customers ordering normally. The line simply ceases to move as quickly.

---

## **C. Parking Lot Neutralization**

*Everything here is legal, mundane, and deeply irritating to people who want discreet arrivals.*

* **Full-lot effect:** Community events, swap-meets, yard-sale days, or car-pool meetups take up the available spaces first.
* **Bike-rack swarms:** Cyclists chaining their bikes early remove visual dominance from vehicle-heavy groups.
* **Family parking dominance:** When families arrive early, spots closest to the venue fill fast.
* **Car club meetups:** Classic-car enthusiasts, EV meetups, detailers’ gatherings. Loud? Sometimes. Illegal? No.

---

## **D. Noise Without Confrontation**

*Sound carries. Hate messaging does not.*

* **Busker clusters:** Musicians, drum circles, fiddlers. Legal if following local noise bylaws.
* **Storytime spillover:** Outdoor reading circles for kids. Wholesome volume.
* **Language tables:** Groups practicing Japanese, ASL, Arabic, French — a soft wall of conversational hum.
* **Friendly dogs:** Happy barking. Not aggressive, just loud in a community way.

---

## **E. Line Occupation & Flow Disruption**

*Community presence slows extremists down without touching them.*

* **Volunteer sign-ups:** Community orgs tabling nearby naturally generate queues.
* **Farm-gate stands:** A pop-up table for local apples or crafts pulls foot traffic into key pathways.
* **Tourist bottlenecks:** Groups photographing murals or statues create polite, legal slowdowns.

---

## **F. Legal Event-Stacking**

*If extremists show up somewhere public, it is no one’s fault the calendar is busy.*

* **Public yoga:** Mat circles take space quickly.
* **Bird-watch walks:** People with binoculars pausing unpredictably.
* **Heritage strolls:** First Nations history walks, immigrant-story walks, Chinatown tours.
* **Community gardening starts:** Seed swaps draw crowds at unpredictable hours.
* **Local festival micro-events:** Spontaneous but permissible gatherings in parks.

---

## **G. Visibility Walls**

*The more people around, the less extremists can control the narrative.*

* **Photographers everywhere:** People taking shots of sunsets, pets, food, murals. Nothing illegal.
* **Sketchbook meetups:** Artists capturing scenery, people, shadows.
* **Journalists doing actual journalism:** Community reporters interviewing locals on unrelated topics.
* **Seniors with binoculars:** Bird watchers are legally allowed to look at birds. Birds happen to be wherever extremists are standing.

---

## **H. Seating Denial by Seating Abundance**

*The most passive form of resistance: not leaving chairs empty.*

* **Game nights:** Cards, dominoes, board games.
* **Study groups:** Students with laptops, chargers everywhere.
* **Craft corners:** Knitting, beadwork, quilling.
* **Language circles:** Multi-lingual chatter builds natural buffer zones.

---

## **I. Activity Overload**

*When a place feels alive, hate looks small.*

* **Dance-pop-ups:** Salsa or swing practice.
* **Meditation groups:** Quiet bodies take physical space.
* **Open-mic warmups:** Poets and musicians testing sound.
* **Walking clubs:** People orbiting the area every few minutes.

---

## **J. Extreme Normalcy**

*Nothing neutralizes extremism like public indifference backed by numbers.*

* **People studying:** Laptops, coffee, headphones.
* **Picnics:** Families with snacks.
* **Teens doing nothing in clusters:** A West Coast classic.
* **Elders chatting:** The soft power of gossip and thermoses.
* **Newcomer meetups:** Refugee, immigrant, and language networks holding open gatherings.",18,1763355634.0,nanaimo,6,0.7,False

Let’s be honest—home 🏠 is where the laundry stares at you 👀, and work 💻 is where emails breed like rabbits 🐇. Enter the *third space*: your escape hatch from adulting! 🚪 It’s that magical zone where you can sip coffee ☕ without a side of spreadsheets 📊, or laugh 😂 without worrying about whose turn it is to do the dishes 🍽️.

Picture this😇; a cozy café ☕ where the Wi-Fi is strong 📶 but your will to check emails is weak 💤. Or a park bench 🌳 where squirrels 🐿️ are your only coworkers (and they’re way less demanding). Maybe it’s a funky bookstore 📚 where you pretend to read but really just Instagram the aesthetic shelves 📸. Whatever it is, your third space is where you recharge 🔋, reconnect 🤝, and occasionally eat dessert 🍰 before dinner—because why not?

It’s not home, nor the school/college/ the workplace, but something better! It’s the place where conversations flow 🗣️, creativity sparks 💡, and you remember that life isn’t just meetings and chores. So go find your third space. Claim it. Own it. And if they serve snacks? Even better. 🍪

Today I got fed up and cussed him out.,"New guy probably in his 60’s moved in a few months ago. Occasionally he’d hit my floor even if I’m just walking or doing mundane home activities like cooking, cleaning, running washer etc. This morning was just having my coffee sitting down and I notice the neighbors next to me sound like they might be moving furniture or something, mind you they have kids as well and sometimes even I can hear the noise, clearly it doesn’t bother me. Anyway, he hit my floor repeatedly for a minute which really set me off so I went down and knocked on his door and asked what his deal was? I told him that I’m just sitting down and before I could explain the neighbors he says “Get the fuck out of here” This is when I flipped and I said “Fuck you. You get out. Why don’t you buy a fucking house if you want total silence?” “Stop pounding my god damn floor” Anyway he felt bad and apologized whatever. Anyway since then he keeps peaking out of his blinds everytime I come downstairs, or when I come outside he’ll come outside and stand by his door. It’s fucking weird.

Are you, like me, completely obsessed with everything AI right now? Watching every new tool drop, tinkering with prompts, and generally geeking out? I know I am! But here's the thing: is it just a hobby, or could it be... more?

Seriously, think about all that AI knowledge you're accumulating. It's basically becoming a superpower, right? And what do we do with superpowers? We use them for GOOD…and maybe a little profit. 😉

So, are you ready to **stop just playing with AI and start actually making some real money with it**? I'm talking this week.

Here's the thing: the opportunity is *now*. Let’s break it down:

*   **The AI Gold Rush is ON:** Seriously. It's like the early days of the internet. Everyone's scrambling to figure things out, and early adopters are going to be the ones who strike it rich. You're already ahead of the curve just by being interested!
*   **Your AI Skillset = Valuable:** Think about the stuff you've learned. Prompt engineering? Image generation? Automating tasks? These are HIGH-DEMAND skills right now. People are willing to pay good money for them.
*   **Don't Overthink It:** You don't need to be a coding wizard or a data scientist. There are tons of ways to monetize your AI knowledge, even if you're just a beginner.

Okay, so how do we get started *this week*? Think simple:

*   **Freelance gigs:** Upwork, Fiverr – they're FLOODED with AI-related requests. Think content creation, image editing, data analysis... even just teaching someone how to use ChatGPT!
*   **Automated Reselling:** This is where the real passive income potential lies. Find a niche, use AI to analyze product trends, and automate the whole darn process. I know it sounds intimidating, but trust me, it doesn’t have to be!
*   **Digital Products:** Turn your AI knowledge into ebooks, courses, or templates. Share your secrets with the world (for a fee, of course!).

And if you're thinking, ""This sounds great, but where do I even begin with the automated reselling part?"". Well...

1oz7e6f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oz7e6f,"My Bestie Stole My Man? LOL, She Can Keep the Trash. I Own the Empire Now.","Five years post-divorce, I ran into ex Derek Vaughn at Prada.


I was buying a tie for my husband when he walked in. The sales girl perked right up.


""Mr. Vaughn! Your wife's suit is ready.""


He glanced at the tie in my hand.


""Add hers to my tab.""


I dropped cash on the counter. ""I'm good.""


He sighed like I'd wounded him.


""Sienna... you still hate me after all this time.""


I smiled.


Hate him? Please. I'd moved on.


Funny—he seemed stuck on it.


---


I shoved the bag into my canvas tote—already stuffed with groceries—and headed out.


By the time I made it to the bus stop near Wicker Park, wind had my hair plastered across my face. Couldn't see a thing.


When I finally brushed it away, Derek's car sat right there. Blocking the curb.


He saw my red eyes, frowned.


""Get in. I'll drive you.""


""Nah, I'm good. Bus works.""


He looked me up and down. Paused at my beat-up canvas bag.


Then, real careful—like he thought I'd lose it—


""You been okay? These past few years?""


""Yeah. I'm good.""


He didn't buy it.


""Just let me drive you. Come on.""


The bus behind him kept honking. Yet he didn't move.


Everyone was staring. Whatever. I got in.


""Englewood. Near Garfield and Halsted.""


He went quiet for a second.


Then his voice came out rough.


""You live there? That area's been rough for years. And you're alone, plus...""


He stopped.


I knew what he wanted to say.


That's where my mom died. Ten years ago today, she wouldn't come to my wedding. Went up to the roof—ten stories—and stepped off.


The backseat was roomy but the heat was cranked way too high. I cracked the window.


""You'll get sick. Close it—I'll turn it down.""


I shook my head, half-smiled.


""Not anymore. Do whatever.""


He went quiet. Then his phone rang.


""Babe, you get the clothes? Where are you?""


The voice through the speakers was familiar—but it had this flirty warmth I'd never heard before.


""Yeah, got 'em. Ran into Sienna. Giving her a ride.""


Pause.


""Wait, Sienna's back? Oh my God, it's been forever. Why didn't you tell me? You're hanging out without me?""


I'd known Paige Hartley for over ten years. Never heard her talk like that.


She used to be quiet. Shy. All about her paintings. When some girl stole her spot in a competition, Paige just hid in the bathroom and cried.


I was the one who grabbed a baseball bat and smashed that girl's canvas in front of everyone. Wrote letters exposing the whole rigged system. Spent three days in juvie to get her justice.


Guess it's true—when someone loves you hard enough, you grow a spine.


""It's just a coincidence. She's busy. I'll be home soon.""


""Come on, we ran into each other—that's fate! What's wrong with grabbing dinner with an old friend?""


""Paige. Don't.""


The line went dead.


Derek always knew how to be gentle when he wanted something. But once he made up his mind? No one could change it.


Paige knew that better than anyone.


The call dropped right as we pulled up to my building.


""Thanks.""


I nodded and got out.


He glanced around the rundown complex. Then called after me.


""Sienna... who'd you buy that tie for?""


""My husband.""


He pressed his palm to his forehead, laughed—bitter, broken.


""Same brand. Same style. You bought me these all the time five years ago.""


""So?""


I looked right at him. Didn't blink.


""You don't gotta act tough with me. After everything, I just want you to be okay. Not... like this.""


Like what?


I caught my reflection in the glass door—


Joggers. Hoodie. Sneakers. Canvas bag full of vegetables.


Looked like every other broke twenty-something in Chicago.


But for someone who used to live in Chanel and Cartier? This was just fine.


I smiled. Wasn't even mad.


""I'm okay.""


His face did something weird. Couldn't tell what.


""Sienna... you've changed.""


""Yeah. I know.""


With that, I turned and walked inside. Didn't look back.


I climbed five flights of stairs and unlocked the door.


Everything looked the same as last year. Same peeling wallpaper, same cracked linoleum.


Mom's photo sat next to the ancient TV in a dollar-store frame. The candle in front of her had burned out.


I lit a fresh one, tied on an apron, and went to the kitchen.


Made roast chicken, mashed potatoes, and green beans. Her favorites.


Set a plate across from mine at the table. Empty chair. Untouched food. I barely ate.


""Mom, I ran into Derek today.""


Waited. Like she might actually answer.


""I know, I know. But he can't mess with me anymore. I'm not that girl you remember.""


Nothing but silence.


Lost my appetite. Left everything on the table and went to the bedroom. Pulled an old photo album out from under the bed.


""Let's look at the good pictures, yeah? I'm sick of staring at that funeral portrait.""


Before I could open it, a photo slipped out. Hit the floor.


I picked it up.


Derek. Me. Paige.


Three dumb kids grinning at the camera.


I stood in the middle, arms hooked through theirs, laughing the hardest.


Chapter 2


Back then, debt collectors stormed Derek's place, yelling, threatening to break bones. None of the neighbors helped. Not even my parents.


But I did.


The punch meant for his face landed on mine instead.


Tooth shattered. Face stayed swollen for two weeks.


Mom felt terrible. Told me to stay away from the Vaughns.


But Derek's mom—crippled, broken—dragged herself to our door on her knees. Kept bowing, crying, thanking my parents over and over.


So Mom caved.


For almost ten years after that, there was always an extra plate at dinner for Derek. Every Christmas, we bought him new clothes.


When Mom wasn't working, she'd help Mrs. Vaughn run her street cart. If anyone gave her crap, Mom would tear into them so hard they'd never come back.


They called each other sisters.


But no one expected the quiet, stammering ""little sister"" would end up screwing her ""big sister's"" husband.


When I got home that day, everything was smashed. Plates. Chairs. Picture frames.


Mom stood in the middle of the wreckage, sobbing so hard she couldn't breathe. Red handprint across her cheek—sharp, cruel. Dad stood there with another woman in his arms, holding her tight.


""Let's divorce. You can have everything. I just want Sandra.""


Derek, standing next to me, panicked. Tried to grab Sandra Reeves' hand.


But Mom slapped him. Twice. Hard.


I shoved her back.


She hit the ground. Stared at me like she didn't know who I was.


I was crying too. But what came out was worse than any slap.


""Mom, what gives you the right to hit him?""


Memories tangled, froze on that little photo in my hand.


When Derek and I split, I burned everything. Guess this one slipped through.


Before I could toss the photo, someone knocked.


Thought it was Mrs. Garcia from next door—she always comes by this time of year.


I opened without checking.


Paige Hartley stood there, arm-in-arm with Derek.


She had this big fake smile on.


""Sienna! Oh my God, it's been forever! You haven't changed a bit!""


""I dragged Derek here—hope we're not interrupting?""


I stared at them.


""I'm not letting you in. What do you want?""


Paige's smile wobbled. She looked up at Derek, eyes going all puppy-dog hurt.


""She just wanted to see you. Brought you a gift. That's it.""


With that, Derek set a box on the table by the door. Didn't wait for permission.


Paige jumped in, voice all chirpy.


""This skincare set is my favorite right now. Had an extra at home and thought of you. We used to share stuff all the time, remember?""


I glanced down. Same brand my housekeeper uses.


""That photo...""


Paige's eyes went shiny. Tears building.


""Sienna... you still haven't let go, have you?""


I crumpled the photo in my fist and tossed it in the trash by the door.


""Not really.""


She reached out like she wanted to hold my hand. But stopped halfway.


""Look, I know you're still upset with me. Today would've been your anniversary, right? If you and Derek were still together.""


She waited. I said nothing.


""About what happened... I mean, back then... I didn't have a choice. But if you're really over it, let us buy you dinner. Seriously. If you need anything—money, help, whatever—just tell us. We're old friends, right?""


Was about to say no.


Then the candle by Mom's photo popped. Loud.


I smiled.


""Sure. Why not.""


Paige talked way more than she used to.


And her hands were all over him.


Went on about their trip to Santorini last month while dabbing lip balm on Derek's mouth at a red light.


""Every winter. You always forget till I tell you."" She dabbed at his mouth. ""Last time you kissed me so hard I bled. When are you gonna remember?""


He grabbed her wrist. ""Stop it.""


""Oh shoot—"" She glanced back at me, fake smile plastered on. ""Sorry, Sienna. You're cool with this, right? Derek and I—we're just like this.""


I cut her off.


""I'm fine.""


Beat of silence.


""I walked in on you two before. This is nothing.""


Nobody said anything after that.


The car went silent.


Finally. Peace.


I stared out the window, thinking how shocked Mom would be if she could see how much Lincoln Park had changed.


Back then, Dad was hell-bent on leaving her for Sandra Reeves. Nearly destroyed her.


And when she found out Derek and I got married in secret? That's what killed her.


At first, I only hated Dad and Sandra.


They betrayed Mom. Turned her from this unstoppable force into a paranoid wreck who fell apart over every little thing.


Time drained her faster than anyone else. Sucked the life right out.


Later? I hated myself.


After Mom's funeral, I left. Should've been on my honeymoon. Instead, I went down to Florida alone. Stayed a month.


During that time, I never hated Derek.


Not once.


He was just a kid. Trapped. Born into hell with no way out.


Before I left, I asked Paige to look after him.


She did great. In the apartment Derek and I were supposed to share as newlyweds, she moved around the kitchen like she owned it.


I thanked her. Meant it.


That year, the three of us were closer than ever.


Derek treated me better than he ever had.


Used every cent of his first profit to buy me this gemstone bracelet I'd been eyeing.


On my birthday, lit up fireworks across downtown.


Every month when I got my period, he'd cancel all his meetings and work from home just to be with me.


I never doubted him.


Thought he loved me. Really loved me.


Until I showed up at his office unannounced.


Chapter 3


Behind the half-open door to his private lounge—soft moans. Breathless.


I pushed it open.


Two naked bodies. Tangled together.


Couldn't unsee it.


I screamed.


He moved fast. Shielded the woman under him.


""Who the hell let you in?!""


""GET OUT!""


I grabbed everything I could reach. Hurled it at them.


Lamp. Books. Coffee mug.


Blood trickled down Derek's forehead. He never stopped protecting her.


I smashed everything in that room.


But couldn't make myself go near them.


They used to be the two people I loved most.


Fear sank deep. My teeth chattered. Tried to stay calm.


Paige's face was red, soaked with tears. Wrapped in a sheet, she dropped to her knees.


""Sienna, I'm so sorry.""


""Derek and I... we shouldn't have. But we can't stop. We're in love.""


""Please. Let us be together.""


She looked just like she did years ago—


Cornered in that alley. Crying while those girls circled her.


That same year, I became the school psycho just to protect her. Pissed off the wrong crowd. Couldn't walk certain streets for months.


I was the one who handed her my wedding bouquet.


Told her she'd find her own happiness someday.


But now she was in my husband's arms, begging me to let her keep him.


Tears rolled down my face. Voice came out barely a whisper.


""When did it start?""


Her lips shook. Couldn't say it.


Someone else did.


""Does it matter? You done? This is my office. Not your house.""


""Are you SERIOUS right now?! Derek! Does that mean NOTHING to you?!""


I screamed at him.


He stood there. Naked. Shameless. Eyes cold.


""Fine. You wanna know?""


""March last year. You took off to Florida and left me here. That's when it started.""


""I wasn't trying to hide it. Your mom just died—I didn't wanna hurt you more. So I let you keep pretending we had a marriage.""


""Paige has been through enough. I'm done watching her suffer because of me. Was gonna wait till after your mom's anniversary to ask for a divorce.""


""But since you know now, let's just say it.""


""Divorce me. Take whatever you want. I just want Paige.""


That's when it hit me.


That shove I gave Mom all those years ago—when I picked Derek's side over hers—


It was heavier than I ever knew.


Before the divorce, I made sure to burn it all down first.


Snapped photos of them in bed. Printed hundreds. Passed them out to every single person at his company.


Strung up banners outside his office building. Big block letters: CHEATER. HOMEWRECKER.


Reported Paige to her school for ""misconduct.""


Her college forum exploded. Vicious posts everywhere.


At her graduation, I hired someone to loop videos of the three of us—laughing, smiling, happy—on the big screen in front of everyone.


Every memory I used to treasure became a weapon.


But Derek still protected her.


She graduated from one of the top art schools without a scratch.


Was about to debut her own gallery show.


To keep Paige's dream alive, Derek finally looked me in the eye.


""Her exhibition's about to open. This has nothing to do with us. Don't ruin it.""


I was past reason by then.


""Ruin it? Oh, I've got plenty ready. Everyone at that gallery's gonna love what I prepared.""


He slammed papers on the table in front of me.


""You want your mom's grave left alone? Behave. Sign the papers. Stay away from me and Paige.""


When Mom was buried, I was too wrecked to handle anything. Derek took care of it all—including buying the plot.


Turns out even the dead are dealing with real estate drama now. Plots get bought and sold.


Long as Derek signed one document, Mom wouldn't even rest in peace.


I threw coffee in his face.


That night, I slept at Mom's grave. Cried till I passed out.


Next day, I showed up at the courthouse anyway.


Wasn't what I expected though—Derek only gave me one thing. His family's old house.


""You reported my company for tax fraud. Most of my accounts are frozen. This is all I can give you.""


""If Paige hadn't begged me, you'd get nothing.""


I couldn't win against Derek. Never could.


Not since we were kids.


He was smart. Calculated. Used strategy and power to get what he wanted.


I just charged in headfirst. Hurt everyone around me, including myself.


So I shut up.


Sold the house. But before I left for the Florida, went to Paige's gallery opening one last time.

## **Last Week in L.A.**

### *The Cull*

The city was still golden, as if nothing had gone wrong, as if the sun could burn away your mistakes like a lazy oven. But the crew knew better.

Wheels was gone.  
Literally. Disappeared.  
No note, no blood, no burned apartment — just a locked front door and a faint smell of Mountain Dew and regret.

Valdez called the disappearance “an accident waiting to happen,” but his tone suggested he wasn’t entirely sure which accident he meant.
Elena wasn’t laughing. Her storage unit had been broken into.
Nothing taken — except for a single drive, blinking innocently in the corner.

Ray, predictably, was missing again.  
His office was stripped bare except for a sticky note:  
**“Patience, idiots. Or something worse happens.”**

---

Paranoia sharpened into performance.  
The crew started imagining dangers in the most mundane details.  
A taxi horn? Hit men.  
A pigeon on a fire escape? Surveillance.  
The ice machine at the diner? Poison.

They began to *accidentally* eliminate each other.

It started small.  
Elena, carrying a box of drives up the stairs, tripped over Valdez’s duffel and smashed her knee. “Accident,” she said, hobbling away.  
Valdez locked himself out of his trailer after a night of whiskey and rage.  
He swore the door handle moved on its own.

Then came the first real cull.  
Wheels’ laptop reappeared — sitting on the curb outside Ray’s old motel. Someone had plugged it into the city’s electrical grid. Sparks flew. A fireball erupted. Wheels’ unholy grin burned into the memory of anyone who’d cared to watch.

---  

The drives had a life of their own.  
Or, at least, the people who wanted them did.  
Text messages, calls, even smoke signals (or so Valdez insisted) started hinting at unseen observers.  
Every decision became a calculus of survival versus greed.

Elena was the first to articulate it.  
“You know, maybe Ray was right. Maybe we should just… sit on our thumbs for a bit.”

Valdez snorted. “Thumbs are dangerous.”

---

By mid-week, the crew was reduced to whispers, furtive glances, and constant relocation.  
They swapped apartments, changed phones, and even dressed like tourists in Venice Beach — oversized sunglasses, hats pulled low, loud Hawaiian shirts.
It didn’t work.

The cull had begun.  
It wasn’t Ray.  
It wasn’t the syndicate.  
It was themselves.

Wheels had fallen victim to an overzealous city street cleaning machine. One second he was staring at the thumb drives, the next he was tangled in a pneumatic broom with his coffee spilling like blood over asphalt.  
Valdez, convinced the city itself was a sentient enemy, tried to outrun a jogger and twisted his ankle into a fractured symphony of pain.  
Elena barricaded herself in her storage unit, only to realize she was locked in with her own air-conditioning system slowly pumping carbon monoxide.

And through it all, the **bitlocke** drives remained.  
Silent, blinking, utterly indifferent.  

---  

By the end of the week, only Ray remained — ghostlike, smoking like a man who had no lungs left to burn.
He stood atop a parking structure, looking at the city below, and whispered:

“Patience, idiots. Always patience. Until next week.”

A car horn honked. A pigeon cooed.  
Somewhere, a new thumb drive began to blink.  
The city hummed. The cull had done its work.

And in the distance, the city waited.

1oz78k3,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/1oz78k3/art_project_concept/,Art project concept,"Decided to start an art project to help me develop my skills as a character designer. The idea is that I create an training fan digimon that evolves from a cannon Fresh digimon and then split it into two different rookie digimon. Afterwards, I have to create full lines for them all the way to mega. Thought I'd share the concept notes for the first half to see what people might think and get some suggestions.

Rules: Have to follow a specific and thematic theme with each line. Every line has to have a rookie and mega version. I can switch up the basic color pallet but I need to keep the digimon consistent.

I had to drive to his school to pick him up and then go get my wife at her friend's. 
As I always drive barefoot, I didn't care to take shoes or flip-flops or anything (as I didn't expect to leave the car). 
I picked up my son but at the time I reached my wife's friend's house, she texted me asking to go inside. I said I was barefoot but she said her friend didn't care. 
So I parked the car and got into the house with my son. Her friend welcomed me also being barefoot. Such as her husband. They said they are always barefoot inside their house. That felt so overwhelming. 
After we left, my wife said she wanted to get some things at the supermarket. I said ""ok, but as you know, I don't have any shore with me right now"". She said no problem. 
So there I was, buying groceries barefoot. It felt really good, especially as people didn't give me weird looks. 
I plan on doing that more, now, as I gained confidence. I'll start jogging barefoot and go to places like the supermarket and so on. Being barefoot where I live is not something particularly common or socially acceptable. But also, it's not like the end of the world. I live in a small city in Brazil, which makes it easier to try.

A few months ago, I felt all over the place too many plans, too many expectations, and honestly no real sense of direction. One morning I sat down with a cup of coffee and asked myself what I actually wanted from my days… not in a dramatic “life makeover” way, just in a real, human, tired-but-trying kind of way.

That’s when I started setting tiny, honest goals. Not the big, scary ones. Just simple things: waking up 20 minutes earlier, drinking more water, going for a walk when my head felt heavy, finishing tasks instead of starting new ones, even learning to say no without guilt. And slowly, those little commitments began to feel like anchors. Every day I kept even one of them, I felt like I was showing up for myself a bit more. 

There were days I slipped. Days I did nothing right. Days I questioned why I even bother. But the funny thing is, those small goals didn’t judge me back they were just there waiting for me when I was ready to try again. That consistency made me feel more grounded than any big achievement ever has. The most surprising part? I started feeling more calm, more focused, and more in control of my routine. And somewhere in this journey, using she med gave me an unexpected boost of clarity and steadiness, making those daily goals feel a little easier to stick with.

I’m still learning, still adjusting, still figuring things out. But if you’re in that same messy phase, trust me start small. One goal. One choice. One day at a time. It really does add up.",3,1763354056.0,lifegoals,0,1.0,False

Last summer, I had reconstructive surgery on my wrist and was put on crazy heavy drugs the day of my surgery, including fentanyl, xanax, and a nerve blocker for my entire right arm. 
When I went home from surgery, I was so exhausted but also extremely anxious from how “high” I felt. I kept trying to go to sleep, but every time would just jolt awake in a confused panic as I dozed off, almost like I was scared of being unconscious. This went on for 12 hours and was complete and utter hell.
It’s been over a year now and the drugs have obviously been long gone out of my system, but this exact feeling is now a nightly occurrence. I will fall asleep for MAYBE 20 minutes, but then I wake up feeling super delirious, anxious, confused, and still unconscious enough that I can’t rationalize with myself. My anxious thoughts are almost like a dream state and make no sense, like the other day I was panicking about being a nurse (I work at a coffee shop), so I can’t talk myself down form the anxiety because I’m practically delirious. This cycle continues all night long, only sleeping for 20 minutes to an hour at a time and then panicking as if I’m on the drugs again. 
It’s gotten so bad that I have had to cut every single substance out of my life, from alcohol to even just Benadryl, because being anything that alters my consciousness (even sleep) makes me panic.  I have no clue what to do or if this is normal, any advice or wisdom or just even a “hey that sucks” helps.

Where to start with cold brew large batches? I would say she isn't very picky with coffee and she does sweeten it up. She's happy with most chain coffee cold drink type of drink

1) she drinks about 8-12 ounces a day about 5 days a week.  How long would a batch stay good for in a fridge?
2) I see some simple pitchers with mesh filters in them with capacity of 64 or 128 oz.  Would anyone recommend these? A gallon would be convenient but would probably take w weeks to finish.  Would it still be drinkable?

As the title says, I've been working on fulfilling a dream of mine by writing a cozy mystery novel with a male sleuth tentatively titled *Double Decker Murder*. I've been working on it on and off since May. Here's the back cover blurb I've written for it to give you an idea of what it's all about:  


**Welcome to the Twin Sails Diner, where the coffee’s hot, the burgers are juicy, and murder is never on the menu…**

After a promising career as a police detective fizzled out, Jake Whittaker returned to his hometown of Whisper Lake, Michigan in search of the quiet life. For the last few years he’s owned the Twin Sails Diner, a cozy eatery loved by locals and tourists alike, and where there’s always enough gossip to fill a coffee kettle.

But everything changes one snowy night when a beloved community leader is killed in a single-car crash on Lakeside Drive. At first glance, it looks like a tragic accident. But a photograph in the local paper and Jake’s unsettling vision gift suggest it was anything but.

The police already have a suspect: the victim’s shady business partner from Detroit. Everyone in town wants to believe the case is closed. Everyone but Jake. He knows the man is innocent, and that the real killer is still walking free.

As Jake digs into the victim’s past, the darker the picture becomes. The victim wasn’t the kind-hearted philanthropist people remember, but a man with a healthy supply of enemies: betrayed employees, ruined families, and the victim of a messy divorce. Among them is a murderer, and if Jake isn’t careful, he could be their next victim.

**Double Decker Murder** is the first book in the *Twin Sails Diner Mysteries*, a cozy mystery series teeming with small-town charm, suspenseful twists, and heart. Perfect for fans of Agatha Christie and classic whodunits.  


Natasha Sass's book *How To Write A Cozy Mystery Step-By-Step* has been monumentally helpful to me, and I've been following that framework as closely as possible while writing the book.

I'm on Chapter 15 (of 20), after Jake (with the help of his waitress sidekick Sandra) has come to the realization that he has been going down the wrong path to find the murderer. In this chapter, with the help of his vision gift, he embarks on the new path and is hopeful he can find the killer. However, I am completely stumped as to how to write it. I'm beyond frustrated as I'm most of the way through the book and progress has come to a screeching halt.

I hope somebody here can help me. It's occurred to me that one might have to see what I've written to be of any help, and I'll provide that if need be.",3,1763353738.0,CozyMystery,3,0.81,False

Hey. For those who care about the specifics, I’m 29 years old, AFAB, and pansexual. 

Lately, it’s felt nearly impossible to make new friends my age. Most of my older friends have long gone and burrowed into their new comfy lives with kids, families, and newfound marriages. Which, don’t get me wrong, I’m incredibly happy for them. But it’s left me feeling pretty beside myself. 

All of that and more has made it harder to find anyone nearby who shares my interests. So I figured I might as well see who is out there on Reddit.

As a general disclaimer, I am not looking to make a bunch of friends. I’d honestly even be happy just finding one person I connect with. 

Now with the generalities aside, let’s get a little bit more specific… 

A little about me. I lean pretty alternative, have a handful of piercings, no tattoos yet, and I fall somewhere in the genderqueer, androgynous area of things.

As for music, I usually drift toward shoegaze, dream pop, indie, folk, jazz, and other alternative stuff. A few favorites are Ethel Cain, Nothing, Whirr, Slow Crush, Cigarettes After S*x, Sufjan Stevens, and Chelsea Days for a few.

I really love reading literary fiction. Genre fiction has never clicked for me. (Sorry sci-fi lovers, I just can’t get into it). I am more drawn to writing that dives deep into the human experience in strange or interesting ways. Think Joy Williams, Raymond Carver, or Clarice Lispector. I especially love short story collections and often read those when I’m out on a hammock or up early drinking coffee.

Outside of reading and writing, I have been trying to get back into knitting, making music, and painting. It’s been a while, but I miss having creative outlets.

I was also very into philosophy club in college, so I am always down to wander into long conversations about whatever strange or thoughtful idea comes up.

I would love to meet someone with similar interests who enjoys deep talks and would maybe be open to hanging out one day. Late night coffee, a smoke, hiking at state parks, and conversations about life sound pretty ideal to me. I am not looking for quick or temporary friendships. I want something genuine.

“Yeah, no shit.” I said to nobody in particular.  



 I parked in the handicapped spot and killed the engine.  The orange lot light through the moonroof stained the interior with a fuckin’ pumpkin spice filter.  I checked my sides, the blood had soaked through.  Gingerly I put on a hoodie, put my phone in my pocket and left the car.



The automatic doors opened, generic music a step above white noise coated the interior.  The clerk jerkily refilled cigarette racks behind the counter.



“Welcome in!” he said, pausing long enough to scratch his neck.



“Yeah, top of the fuckin’ morning my guy,” I said.



Fuck it, I thought, I had to piss.  I remember getting hit in the kidneys when I was playing football in high school, I pissed blood for two days.  The bathroom was empty, so I helped myself to the handicapped stall.  I unzipped and expected the worst, but my stream was fine.  Strong, and clear, not bragging, just saying.  



I finished, zipped up, and left to wash my hands.  I don’t flush public toilets.  Listen, I’ve worked in restaurants my whole life and cleaned enough shitters that I’ve seen the horrible shit guests do to the bathroom in the middle of the night, and I know the quality of staff tasked with cleaning it.  Something told me tweaker boy up front wasn’t exactly Felix Unger over here.



Pausing in front of the mirror I lifted my hoodie and shirt and took my first long look at my left side.  The incision was about six inches long, vertical, blood weeping through black threads.  I dabbed it with a paper towel, soaking up some of the fresh blood, and felt something hard, just under the skin.  Gritting my teeth, I pressed it, exploring, something about 3 inches, narrow, foreign.  I pressed harder and saw stars from the pain.  Fuck, something was in there.  What the fuck had these dolts done to me?



I look on the other side, same deal with the paper towels, same six inch incision, but this one had a longer, thicker string sticking out, not just stitches.  I gave it a pull and felt something move under my skin, the pain nearly bringing me to my knees.  I caught myself on the sink, very aware to not let any part of my pants touch this floor.  



I spent a few moments catching my breath and the pain subsided.  My mind regained its perfectly honed instincts.  I looked at my face in the mirror, a little stubble, chicks dig that, but I was mostly looking at my skin.  Shouldn’t I be turning yellow or some shit?  Or maybe that was liver disease.  In the white fluorescent light I looked a little pale, but otherwise just as heartbreaking as usual.  



I gingerly felt the skinny object on my left side again.  What the fuck was that?  What the fuck was sticking out on the other side?  Maybe it’s drugs.  I’d heard the kids are into Fentanyl these days, whatever the fuck that is.  My bear trap of a brain kicked into overdrive.



What had the robot lady said I had to do here?



My phone buzzed, a text message.



*$5,000 in Best Buy Gift Cards.  Do not contact the police.”*



Well that’s fucking convenient.



I tried to unlock the message to reply but it still wouldn’t let me.



Fine.  I gave one more look at my sides, washed my hands again, and left the can.  The clerk had transitioned from restocking cigarettes to restocking dip behind the counter.



“Hey buddy, you guys got any gift cards?”



He turned, smiled with a mouth full of empty spaces.  He had the weird leathery look of a guy who recently did time, and lots of it.



“Yes sir!  How many you need?”



“A shitload, can I get 5k on Best Buy?”



His smile wiped away like bugs under a squeegee.



“I ugh, can’t do that much, I’m sorry.  That’s beyond the limit.”



“Well you can, come on, what’s the fuckin’ limit?”



“It’s a 1,000 per card, but…like are you in trouble?  Did someone tell you to do this?”



“No, it’s my fuckin’ wife’s birthday today and I forgot, can you help me out?  Just give me five cards and I’ll hit the bricks.”



“Man, I think you’re getting scammed,” he looked at my waist, “and you’re bleeding sir.”



“Thanks for the update Kitboda, I’m a fuckin’ professional over here, not some dipshit bingo hall broad.  Just do it, I’ll throw 100 on the Cheesecake Factory for your trouble.”



“No, I’d get fired,” he paused, shuffled his feet back and forth, shrugged, then walked to the gift card section.  He took five Best Buy cards and started ringing them up.



“It has to be one at a time, and you have to buy other shit in between or it triggers the system.”



My man, I thought.



“Yeah, get yourself something nice,” I said, “But keep it reasonable over here.”



My money clip contained three things:  My debit card, my drivers license, and my company credit card.  I didn’t have enough on the debit to cover five or six grand or whatever the fuck this was going to cost, but my company card could cover it easy.  And this would be an easy one to  put on the card, tell HR the mob or some shit had stolen my kidneys, and they’d do a chargeback.  Everybody thinks they’re a wiseguy until they fuck with Visa’s money.



He loaded the first card, I tapped the company card.  He rang up a couple packs of USA Golds and I tapped my debit card, and we wordlessly continued, just two dudes doing financial crimes in the middle of the night.



My eyes drifted to the parking lot, in the harsh white light of the pumps I saw three shabby figures on foot.  My stomach dropped.



“Say pal, you wanna hurry the fuck up?  I’m on a schedule.”



“It takes a while.”



Four cards down, he had trouble scanning a case of Faygo. 



“Listen, just ring the last fucking card up my guy.  I gotta fuckin’ go.”



One of the figures caught sight of my car, did the puppy dog head tilt, and the other three followed suit.  They picked up their pace, walking in a motion too smooth to be natural toward the door.



“...tap your card man,” the guy said.



I tapped, did the electric signature gimmick, and snatched the last card from the counter by the time two of the goombas walked in the sliding door.



“Call the cops!” I said



“Now?”



One of the bums saw me, eyes turned red, and they both bolted in my direction, one the outside of the counter, the other inside, brushing the clerk away with a forearm.  I ran for the door on the other side of the counter, only to be met by the original one in the dopey hat blocking my way.  



Fuck.



I turned and ran for the back exit, but feinted to the right and turned left through the chips toward the coffee section.  My trick worked, and got myself some extra time, but not much, one of the fuckers was still on my heels.  I grabbed a full coffee pot and gave it an overhand toss onto the bum’s face.  



Glass and hot coffee smashed against red eyes and a surprisingly smooth face.  The guy didn’t seem to notice.  Shouts at the front of the store.



I turned and ran again, taking the only opening I could find past the thing.  Passing him I felt a jerk on my neck, my head and body stopped but my feet kept going.  The fucking guy had a hold of the hood on my hoodie, and he yanked me down.



“Hands up!” a voice toward the front of the store, the shirtless guy from earlier.  



Mechanical sound of a shotgun pump.



“I said hands fucking up!  Let him go!”



The guy holding me didn’t let him, meaning me, go, opting instead to drag me toward the front door, I grabbed aisle and held on, but the fucker was strong.



A blast, the sound of my struggle disappeared into ringing ears, bits of shit rained down on top of my head.  The bum didn't stop moving, and I wiggled out of the hoodie and scooted my ass away.  



The shirtless guy pumped the shotgun and blasted the bum again, straight to the fucking dome.  But nothing happened.  He just stood there, didn’t even adjust his footing, just fucking stood there holding my hoodie.



The two other bums turned on their heels and jogged toward the shirtless guy.  He pumped the shotgun and fired into the closest one, direct hit to the bum's chest.  Bits of jacket and sweatshirt ripped away, but the bum didn’t stop.  No Shirt fired again, but it didn’t slow him down.



They converged on No Shirt from both sides.  He held the shotgun up in a defensive posture, one of the bums snatched it from his hand and threw it away.  The other bum grabbed his head.  No Shirt punched, his fist connecting, then opening, shaking in pain.  The bum’s hand closed on No Shirt's head and it collapsed like a watermelon at the Gallagher show.



I knew my moment when I saw it and booked, ignoring the pain in my side I sprinted to my car.  I hit the engine start button and was peeling rubber out of the parking lot before the three things had left the store.



My phone rang and the car answered without me.  Same female smiling TikTok bullshit AI voice.



“Follow the navigation screen.  Obey the speed limit.  Do not get pulled over.  You have less than an hour.”



“Eat a dick!”  I began, but the call ended.  



I look at the navigation screen.  It was telling me to get on the interstate and head to the old outlet mall on the opposite side of the valley, about 30 minutes.  I wiggled in the seat trying to get comfy, more aware now that the pain in my side was something poking me from the inside.



“Be careful of the interstate, there was a tumult downtown earlier, and a larger than normal police presence in the city.”



Who the fuck said that?  Man’s voice, or lady’s voice.  Fuckin’ just a voice. Felt more than heard, Dolby fuckin’ surround sound.  In a panic I turned to the backseat, nobody there.



“The fuck said that?” I asked nonchalantly.



“I did,” the voice said again.  “And please stop wiggling, it takes time to build the proper connections.  Thank you for carrying me, my presence will likely cause you no long-term harm.”



“Oh gimme a fuckin’ break,” I said.

# JOURNAL ENTRY, July 19th, 11:42 PM

I don’t know how much more of this Ellie can take. How much more can I take? I told myself I’d keep writing until I had answers, but I think I’m just keeping record now because I’m terrified something will wipe me away, my memory, my body, my place in the world, and this will be all that’s left. The mirror came back again. We threw it away, and it came back. We smashed it, and it came back. Now it’s in Ellie’s apartment. I feel like whatever is inside of it is learning me, studying me. Maybe it thinks it can do a better job of being me than I can. If I die, and someone finds this: Please. Please don’t trust what looks like me. I’m leaving this entry open. I’m afraid that if I close the journal, I’ll never write again. — N.



Ellie grabs my wrist like the hallway floor is about to give out beneath us. “Nora,” she whispers, her voice trembling, thin, “we threw it out. We threw it *out*. How is it, how is it in here?” The mirror stands against the far wall of her living room, directly across from her balcony doors. Moonlight washes over it in a thin silver sheet. The glass looks darker than before, like an unlit doorway instead of a surface. And in the reflection, we're not standing where we should be. In the real room, Ellie is beside me. In the reflection, she’s a step behind. Tiny things. Off by inches. Off by intention. “I don’t want it here,” Ellie breathes. “I don’t want, Nora, I don’t want this in my home.” Her voice cracks. “We have to, we have to break it. Really break it this time.” I swallow, but my throat feels lined with dust. “We’ll do it together.” We move as if approaching an animal we know is already mid-lunging. Ellie goes to her kitchen and returns with the hammer she uses to assemble furniture. I find her cast-iron doorstop, the heavy one shaped like a sleeping cat. Our reflections do not move in sync. Mine lags by a half-second, like a skipped frame in a corrupted video. Ellie doesn’t see. I don’t tell her. We stand before the mirror. The room feels weighted, pressurized, like the air before a thunderstorm. “One,” Ellie says, raising her hammer. “Two,” I whisper, lifting the iron cat. “Three.” We swing. The blows hit the glass with a force that shivers up my bones. Instead of shattering into chaotic shards, the mirror cracks in perfect spiderweb lines, thin fractures, symmetrical, converging to a single point in the center as if cultivated rather than accidental. Then, The cracks begin to *close*. The glass knits itself back together like healing skin. “Oh my God,” Ellie gasps, stumbling backward. “No. No, no, no, Nora, Nora, it’s fixing itself.” A low, soft creaking rises from the mirror, like something bending a door from the other side. I grab her arm. “We have to go.” We run across the hall to her bedroom, slam the door, and shove her dresser in front of it. Ellie is shaking so hard her teeth chatter. “It’s not going to stay in there. It’s not going to stay anywhere.” I pull her into a hug. “It won’t come in here. Not right now. We need to wait it out.” I’m not sure if that’s true. But her panic is thick and contagious, and I have to control at least *one* of us. After a long while, the noises stop. No creaking. No shifting. Just silence and our breath. Eventually, exhaustion pulls us both down. Ellie falls asleep first, her body curled toward the wall, as if she wants to fold herself into it and disappear. I stay awake longer, listening to every tick of her old electric clock. I don’t sleep until nearly dawn. I wake to the soft sound of Ellie’s voice. She’s in the living room. Speaking calmly. Too calmly. Like she’s holding a conversation that requires careful politeness. I sit up, heart beating hard against my ribs. She isn’t on the phone, I can tell by the rhythm of her speech. It’s too steady. Too measured. Like someone responding to a person standing in front of her. My blood chills. “Ellie?” I call. She doesn’t answer. I slide out of bed and cross the apartment, bare feet silent on the carpet. When I turn into the living room.  Ellie is standing face-to-face with *me*. Except it’s not me. The figure is my exact height, my hair, my posture, but wrong. Unsmiling in a way that feels like it’s waiting for permission to smile. Its face is too smooth, its spine too straight, like someone poured me into a mold and let the excess harden. I freeze. Ellie doesn’t see me. She’s staring at *it* with an expression soft and confused, like she’s listening to a quiet voice I can’t hear. “Ellie!” I shout. “Get away from it!” She whips toward me, just as the creature slowly turns. The smile hits first. A long, widening crescent. My mouth stretched far beyond human limits, curling like it’s being pulled upward by invisible hooks. Then the skin starts to *slip*. Like wax under a flame, the face melts downward in thick, drooping folds, sliding off its cheekbones and exposing a dark, wet underlayer that pulses like something freshly born. A sound erupts from it,  a shriek so high, so sharp, it seems to splinter the air itself. Ellie drops to her knees, hands pressed to her ears, crying out in agony. I grab her under the arms. “Ellie, Ellie, get up, GET UP!” The entity jerks toward us. Not walking. Skipping forward in one sudden, lurching frame like a corrupted GIF. I drag Ellie into the hallway, nearly carrying her, and slam her apartment door behind us. The shriek reverberates through the wood, vibrating the hinges. We run across the hall. I can barely get my key into the lock; my hands are shaking so violently that the metal keeps missing the slot. Behind Ellie’s door, something taps, once, twice, three times, like fingernails knocking on a windowpane. I want to throw up. When my door finally opens, we stumble inside and I slam it shut. Then I cover every mirror I own, every reflective surface, with towels, blankets, clothing, anything I can find. Ellie sinks onto my couch, still shaking. Her ears are bright red. Her eyes were wet and wide. I kneel in front of her. “Ellie,” I whisper, “I told you it wasn’t me.” She nods, small and terrified. “I know. I know now. Nora, what is happening?” I want to answer. I want to give her something steady to stand on. But I have nothing. Not even myself.



# JOURNAL ENTRY, July 20th, 2:17 AM

We tried to destroy it. It won’t die. It followed us to Ellie’s apartment. Ellie saw it tonight. She can’t pretend anymore. Neither can I. I don’t know what it wants. But I think it’s getting braver. And it looks more like me every time. — Nora

  
  


# PART SIX

**Journal Entry, August 3rd, 1:12 A.M.**

I should be asleep. Ellie’s on my couch and keeps murmuring in her dreams, little stuttered breaths, like she’s trying to outrun something even while unconscious. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what any of this means. All I know is the mirror is back. Again. It showed up tonight, just as it never left. We shattered it. I watched the glass explode like a star collapsing in on itself. But it came back, whole and serene, leaned against my bedroom wall. Waiting. Ellie said not to write about it, that putting it on paper might make it “more real.” But I have to. If I don’t record all of this, every detail, then maybe I’ll start believing the thing that looks like me. I can’t sleep. The walls feel too thin. The air feels watched. And every time I close my eyes, I swear I hear the soft scrape of long fingers brushing the other side of the glass. — Nora

  
  


Ellie wakes first. I know this because I hear her whisper my name before my eyes even open, a tiny, shaking, “Nora?” like she’s checking whether she’s dreaming again. I sit up slowly, every muscle stiff. The living room is washed in the cloudy gray of Oregon morning, the kind of light that makes everything look underwater. Ellie’s already in the kitchen, hands wrapped around a mug she hasn’t even filled yet. She looks fragile, pale in a way I’ve never seen before. “You okay?” I ask. She shakes her head without speaking. Then, finally: “I keep seeing its face when I blink.” I swallow. Hard. “Yeah,” I whisper. “Me too.” We stand in silence until the kettle clicks off. Even the faint metal ping makes Ellie flinch. “I think…” She starts, then stops. “I think we need help.” “From who?” I ask. “The cops? A priest? A therapist? Who the hell do we even tell that a mirror keeps following us around like a stray cat with a grudge?” Her eyes dart to the hallway leading to my bedroom. “Have you checked if it’s still there?” The question lands like a weight. Heavy. I realize neither of us wants to know, but not knowing feels worse. I motion for Ellie to stay put. She doesn’t argue. As I walk down the hallway, the floorboards shift beneath my feet like they’re breathing. The closer I get, the colder the air turns. It’s subtle, but it’s there, like stepping into a freezer with the door left cracked. I push the bedroom door open with the tips of my fingers. There it is. Perfect. Clean. Harmless-looking, the same way a venomous snake can look beautiful until it moves. The mirror stands exactly where it stood the first day I brought it home, angled just slightly toward my bed, as if it had turned itself while we slept. My reflection looks back at me. Normal. Still. Too still. My breath fogs the air, but the reflection’s breath doesn’t. I slam the door shut. Ellie jumps when I re-enter the living room. “It’s there?” “It’s there,” I confirm, voice thin. “And it’s… awake.” “What does that mean?” she asks. I don’t know how to explain it, not really. “It felt like it was waiting for me.” Ellie presses her hands over her face. “Oh my god.” “We need to figure out what it wants,” I say, though the words don’t feel like they belong to me. They sound borrowed, like the mirror whispered them into my mouth. Ellie stares at me, concerned. “Nora, are you sure you’re okay?” I blink. “I think so.” But I’m not. Because, as I said, I felt a faint tug behind my ribs. As if something inside me had already agreed before I did. A few hours later, after too much coffee and not enough courage, Ellie suggests, “Maybe we should talk to someone who actually studies this stuff.” “You want to call a paranormal investigator?” I ask, raising an eyebrow. “I don’t know! Maybe!” “We’ll get laughed at.” “At least we’ll be laughed at by someone alive,” she mutters. Fair point. However, the truth is that explaining any of this out loud feels impossible. As soon as I try, the facts will collapse into nonsense. A mirror that relocates itself. A reflection that lags. A thing that peels itself out of the glass like wet paper. A creature that becomes me. Who would believe that? Ellie sits on the couch, hugging her knees. “Do you think it can hear us?” Everything in me says yes. I don’t say that. “I don’t know,” I lie. A soft tap echoes down the hallway. We both go rigid. Tap. Tap. Tap. The sound of a fingernail on glass. Ellie whispers, “It’s doing it during the day now.” I move toward the hallway without thinking, but Ellie grabs my wrist. “Don’t.” “It’s already here,” I say, voice shaking. “Not looking doesn’t make it leave.” We inch forward together this time. When I push the door open a crack, the tapping stops. Not gradually, instantly. Like the creature inside the mirror heard the hinges and froze. But the room is quiet. Too quiet. My reflection stands a little closer to the glass than I remember. “Nora,” Ellie breathes, “your reflection, look at its hands.” I don’t want to. I have to. My reflection’s arms hang at its sides, perfectly still, but the fingers… the fingers twitch in tiny insect-like spasms. Not matching my movements. Not mimicking anything. Just… working. As if limbering up. “I hate this,” Ellie whispers, voice trembling. “Yeah,” I breathe. We close the door softly. That night we slept in the living room again, if you can call it sleep. Ellie keeps the lamp on, claiming it’s for reading, but her book stays closed on her lap for hours. Several times, I think I hear footsteps in the hallway. Not loud ones. Soft, hesitant ones. As if something is trying to mimic the rhythm of human walking but hasn’t perfected it yet. At one point, Ellie whispers, “Nora? Are you awake?” “Yes.” “…If it can look like you… How do I know the real you is the one sitting beside me?” I feel something cold ripple down my spine. “You’d know,” I say. “How?” I open my mouth. But nothing comes out. She waits. “Nora?” “I…” My throat tightens. “I don’t know.” Ellie’s eyes fill with tears, but she nods. “Okay. Okay. Then we figure it out. Together.” We sat closer after that. Not touching, just leaning enough that if one of us disappears, the absence will be unmistakable.

  
  


# Journal Entry, August 4th, 12:41 A.M.

Something is changing. The air feels different. Thicker. Like the walls are soaked with breath that isn’t mine. Ellie is trying so hard to stay strong. I don’t think she wants me to know how scared she really is, but I can see it, her hands shaking, the way she avoids looking toward the hallway, how she jumps when I speak too suddenly. I keep wondering what the entity wants. Does it want out? Does it want me? Or does it want to replace me entirely? The mirror hasn’t moved again. But that doesn’t make me feel better. It feels like it’s waiting for something. For the next step. For permission. I’m afraid I already gave it that. Not in words, but in fear. Fear feels like an invitation. I don’t know how much longer we can stay here. But where else can we go? It follows. It always follows. I think it's like that I’m writing. It likes that I’m thinking about it. It likes the attention. I’m so tired. I don’t know how this ends. — Nora

1oz6ueo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nocontact/comments/1oz6ueo/two_years_tomorrow/,Two years tomorrow.,"Two years ago I (M 30s) lost patience with a friend (M 30s) I’ve known for 25+ years. Unfortunately, it was about inane US political/culture war bullshit and it was over text. I told him to knock it off and he said he’d comply by never bothering me again. I told him no, I had just had it with the BS and he could text me about anything else: But, for once, I left it at that.


Two years have passed and neither of us have contacted each other. No calls, texts or acknowledgments. I’ve thought about him, and this predicament, every day. But I’ve had a lot of time and space to think about what this relationship was even running on. Turns out, a whole lot of fond memories and attempts to honor the years of friendship but not much by way of our current life or values.


We had some great times together. I think he has good in him but I’ve also learned that he’s never satisfied and has a really alarming way of lashing out on the few people he lets get close to him. Over the years I’ve extended considerable grace to this person. He’s just on his own and it’s not up to me how he lives his life. 


At this point in my life I’m lucky to have a number of cherished friendships new and old, with a spouse I love dearly. He’s an angry loner. I have tried and tried to give him human connection. I can only brush off abrasive and alienating behavior for so long. Guy needs help. Will he take it? Who knows….


I wonder if someday we’ll meet over coffee and just wrap this thing up in a nice little package. Wishful thinking. Would it go well? Would we just bicker? Would he toss his coffee in my face? The idle time wasted wondering.


But two years later I can safely say that I feel good about my decision to leave him be. It’s kind of strange though: how he sort of threw it out there as protest to me being candid about how his attitude made me feel. 


Anyway, if you’re in a predicament wondering if you have the fortitude to keep your distance… my life has had considerable peace since walking away. Sure, he could reach out tomorrow and kick off another dysfunctional chapter in this long running friendship. I don’t think that’s something I am seeking though. It becomes so strange when you love a person but no longer like them.
