And Here's What I Found,"Here’s some Context: I’m coming off of a 6 month spout of post-grad unemployment. To keep myself busy/prevent myself from going into total stasis, I went to a coffee shop, and worked on something almost every day. I’m still looking for more shops to try as I work remotely about half of the week, but since I’m not going to be able to keep up the frequency, I thought I would make this post now.

First, I’ll list every coffee shop I tried that wasn’t notable enough to say something about

* CoZie Cafe - Fair Lawn
* Better Daze Cafe - Fair Lawn
* Bogota Press - Bogota
* The Mindful Cafe - Ramsey
* SOMA Cafe - Waldwick
* Pour City Roasters - Franklin Lakes
* La Casa de Cabana - Wayne
* Queen City Coffee Roasters - Clifton
* Longfellow’s Coffee - Kinnelon
* Cloveberry - Sparta
* Cafe IDG - Lodi
* Cupily Coffeehouse - Nutley
* Halo Coffee Roasters - Springfield
* Ara Coffee - Rutherford
* Uptown Coffee - Maywood
* Qahwah House - Montclair (almost certainly the strongest coffee I had at any of these places)
* Humphrey’s Coffee - Haworth (though I do quite like the vibe there)
* Catalano Coffee - Glen Rock (I’ve gone here a few times since I live around it but between the pourover and espresso drinks I haven’t found anything that has really wowed me)
* Bergen Coffee Roasters - Ho-ho-kus
* Awe & Wonder - Tenafly (had a lot of high hopes for this one that it just didn’t live up to)
* Sleepwalker Coffee - Englewood
* Bluestone Lane - Paramus (I had this twice and I found it shockingly mediocre both times)
* Zen Haus - Ridgewood
* American Bulldog - Ridgewood/Ramsey
* L'Arte della Pasticceria - Ramsey

And now, I’ll list out some of my favorites by category.

Best Food:

* Cafe Club - Montville
* Tatte - Ridgewood
* The Fine Grind - Little Falls

Best Specialty Drinks

* Paper Plane Coffee Co - Montclair
* Boonton Coffee Co - Boonton
* Cedar Beans - Cedar Grove
* Kudo Society - Teaneck (specifically the Sea Salt Iced Coffee, nothing else there was better than fine, but that drink is amazing)

I’ll give both Rey Sol in Ridgewood and Catfight Coffee in Boonton points for creativity in this one, but Rey Sol is extremely overpriced for drinks that just don’t taste that good, and I haven’t found a specialty drink I loved at Catfight.

Best Vibes:

* Hug a Mug - Pompton Lakes
* Paper Plane - Montclair
* Boonton Coffee Co - Boonton
* Thumbody - Paramus
* Iconic Coffee - Hackensack (by far the best coffee shop in the area for coworking even if I didn’t love their drinks)
* The Fine Grind - Little Falls (need to attend some of their events at some point)

And I’ll list my Top Five Favorites Below:

5. Haus Cafe - Fair Lawn: Small space, but the coffee is consistently good, I can be in and out quickly, and it’s just a dependable spot.

4. Thumbody - Paramus: Pastries are delicious, they consistently have some cool specialty drinks, and despite being in an office park on Route 4 the vibes are shockingly good. 

3. Boonton Coffee Co - Boonton: I love how large the whole space is. I can sit on those couches for hours. Plus, their specialty drinks are really good.

2. Paper Plane - Montclair: Best Coffee Drinks in the area, but seating is really tight. If you can get seating though, it’s great.

1. Cafe Club - Montville: Probably the only place on this whole search I found by just driving around, and it’s almost certainly the most well-rounded. Pretty good food, pretty good specialty drinks, a really cool location up on Boonton Avenue, and the best outdoor seating of any of these places.

I hope this is helpful to people on this forum, and I’m certainly open to hearing about spots I may have missed. I know I haven’t really scratched the surface on a lot of Passaic County and Southern Bergen County, so I’d love to hear if there’s any spots I’m really missing out on down there. We lost our coffee pot at home and have to order a new one, so I'll still have a few days of going out and trying spots.",1,1767842477.0,newjersey,0,1.0,False

The thread about nothing going on downtown got me thinking and I’m curious what people would like to see if things cost nothing and change were immediate 😂

The Smylie Brothers space is RIPE to be redeveloped into a climbing gym/roller rink/arcade- something that can work without retrofitting it too much to eliminate the noise issues.

Rotating pop up shops like the holiday one on Maple.

A late night lounge, Happy Hour-12a W-Sa. Using the old Panera space as a cozy lounge that served coffee, small plates, small bar and also had space for students to study separate from other seating spaces would be awesome. Different vibe entirely from Colectivo.

A good neighborhood bar. Ridgeville is a nice spot, but how we don’t have a place to throw darts besides Bat17 in downtown Evanston is beyond me. PLEASE correct me if I’m wrong 😂 (As much as I love Bat17’s food, I hate going in there. YMMV.)

1q70ob3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q70ob3,"I Am proof of ""happiness is Health""","So the first picture was probably my most uncomfortable time of growing up, bullied and trying to ""fit in"" to make friendships, acquaintances or even attention wise, in the distant past i was bullied for my ears, and you can see why that was an issue for me clearly 😌😂 BUT the story goes on. 

The next picture (B&W) was near 2020, when I had years of experiences of psychiatric units, being judged and judging others and all that negative jazz finally filtered out... i felt amazing and ate amazing health foods and actually loved the way i had looked, but the journey i was on required LOTS OF GROUNDING ✍️ and i eventually had been into another psychiatric unit for my diagnosis of schizo-affective disorder, simply because i was in outer space spiritually and never grounded myself correctly in the moments i had... and also a fiendish obsession with wax cannabis (dabs) and occasional alcohol consumption. I had about a 3 year stint with off an on daily oral medications for that diagnosis and while i was in my most recent psychiatric D&MH split treatment center, I had gotten out in july of 2023, somewhere at a facility in minnesota for a 6 month long total stay, committed by a Mn Judge court. Upon completion, the next picture.... Was my heaviest weight in my entire life...

3rd pic:

298 pounds in the middle of, I believe was about the summer of 2024... maybe (brain fog from those areas in time) 
 
I felt like crap then, all-of-the-time, ate huge a** bags of party sized doritos, drank cases upon cases of soda, and additionally i had an entire almost cup and a half (cup measurements) of coffee creamer, per cup until 12 cup coffee pot was empty, filled half and half coffee/creamer.

*arteries probably close to clogged*
.
.
.
I probably haven't ever felt that bad in my entire life, had many issues breathing heavy, exhaustion from things other people would be fine with light movement... 

Then i got on medication and started adjusting them until some symptoms stopped and i could be happy with working medications.

3rd picture is relevant to me around that heavy-time being medicated, heavy heavy medications.

4th picture is relatively the same area of time, although i had begun journaling and occasionally going out in public and even with my old anxiety it was progress...

Last three pictures 📸 

ME now!!! This is myself happy and working positively on my diet! (Which healthy foods can taste good I've discovered!) 

Also *self care started often this last year of 2025!*
Showering consistently when feeling stanky :)
Brushing, flossing, scraping tongue and using oral rinse! Washing hands after #1 (always after #2 even at my worst 😂🙏) i clean up after myself, i respect myself, i have integrity, i am honest TO myself which is super important i believe. I meditate and do breathwork, and i am brave and courageous enough to do things that normally seem uncomfortable for my old cycle self and i am just super grateful and appreciative of those who believed in me, which has been a handful of friends and my family is number 1 for me. 

At the end of the day, I am proof of true recovery, I am going to tell anyone and everyone, you really ARE capable of greatness, you have what it takes to change your own OUTCOME. Believe me, I believe in you! 🫶❤️🌹🥹✍️

Not interested in “go out for breakfast” or “turn the tv on”.

Just a side note on that. I used to pop the tv on for the first 1/2 hour while I made my coffee and woke up but he’s been notably more chill and independent when we stopped that.

1q70m9m,https://i.redd.it/7bogdq70m1cg1.jpeg,Week 1 (Jan 1-7) of Low-Buy,"Here is my progress during Week 1 of my low-buy. My rules are 1 clothing item per month, 1 accessory per month, and 1x under $20 dining out/week and 1x $50+ dining out per month. All other spending allowed as long as it's under my envelope daily spend budget. All necessary items for my new apartment are allowed. In general, all necessary items are allowed, even clothes. It's mainly a low clothing, low dining out low-buy, and enforcing my alcohol budget.

I am coming from 5-8 pieces of clothing per month, blowing my clothing budget by triple per month, dining out 3x/week, and blowing my alcohol budget by 30% per month.

I get a hot pink sticker for no clothing or dining out days. I get a green sticker with a heart for no clothing or dining out *except coffee*. I get a green sticker for allowed buys or under envelope spend buys. I get an orange sticker for unallowed buys or for going over an envelope day. 

Today's green sticker is because I started working out at my new work's gym this week and turns out they don't allow crop tops, but all I have are combo cropped-top/sports bras and got talked to for that, so I went to Goodwill and got two tank tops and two sports bras. 

I separately have an alcohol tracker that looks similar to this, too. 

I am feeling really good. I have a very immediate savings goal (renting an interstate uhaul) that is keeping me vigilant. I also moved into a new place with much less clothing space and so if I even wanted to buy anything new I would have no where to put it. That's keeping me on track too. 

Newly having access to a full-sized fridge is helping with preventing dining out. 

Good luck to everyone on their no and low buys this month and this year! Thanks for reading. ",2,1767842035.0,nobuy,0,1.0,False
1q70kkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/DermatologyPA/comments/1q70kkr/new_job_offer/,New Job Offer,"Hi everyone! 

    Just received an offer letter today, would love some feedback. For background, I have 2 years experience as a derm PA in SE FL and this new job is located in the same region. I would be moving from a private equity group to a privately owned practice. As many new grad PA’s have experienced in derm, my first role was laughable and offered 90k salary (now up to 96k) with zero commission structure so I’m genuinely excited to be able to move on to something more reflective of what I have seen in this group and others. Here are the preliminary offer details: 

-115k base salary 
-27.5% commission on net collections (minus base) 
OR 
Tiered volume based bonus as follows: 
300-450 patients/month = $1.5k 
450-600 patients/month = $2.5k
600+ patients/month = $5k 
* of the above, I will be paid out quarterly whichever is greater. The reason they are structuring commission in this manner is because they have a large volume of Medicare/Medicaid patients that they are trying to diversify with more commercially insured patients but they anticipate it may take 18-24 months to see the turn around in patient population that they are aiming for. They are aware of the limitations of a % commission with this population base so they added this new volume-based bonus structure to help keep incentives appealing. Eventually, the goal is to enter a commission only model.* 
- 35% net collections on cosmetics ( minus cost of product + taxes) 
- 4 day work week (10 hour days)
- 3 weeks PTO (not including major holidays)
- $2k CME
- All costs for maintenance of licensure covered
- A verbal conversation with the CEO mentioned 401k/health insurance/Malpractice but there’s nothing specifically outlined in the preliminary agreement. I plan to clarify this. 
- 2 year contract (with a vague clause that states to pay back training costs if i terminate early, I also plan to clarify this and ask for a specific $ amount or at least a formula for how training costs will be determined as the conversations that were had made it seem like the training period will be variable depending on both mine and my SP’s comfortability in having me fly solo after acclimating to the new clinic) 
- 180 day termination notice (plan to negotiate down to 90 days) 
- 12 month 12 mile non-compete 

I believe that’s all the major stuff. Overall, I really love the vibe of everyone I have spoken to (Owner, CEO, SP). My potential SP is very young and very supportive; he expressed a desire to train me at the top of my license which really excites me as my current group is not as open minded. We met in person over some coffee and it was definitely an easygoing vibe, so I have no concerns about getting on well with the team.  

If you’ve read this far I really appreciate your time. I’m still learning as a baby PA and this will be my first big girl job hop! Let me know if anything seems glaringly wrong or if maybe I’m missing something. Thanks in advance 😄.

...........................................................................................................................................................................................

“I put in for transfer,” He wouldn’t meet the gaze of the others, opting to study the floor to great detail. He hadn’t noticed that scratch on the wooden tiles before. His chest felt as if the air had been punched out of him, leaving a void behind. Telling them this today wasn’t his plan, although, if you had asked, say, a day ago, when he was going to, he wouldn’t have been able to answer either. And that is because he didn’t know. It’s almost as if he had thought of disappearing. That idea never crossed his mind though, he wouldn’t do that to them. Not like Maddie did when he was barely 18, with no clue of what to do next because he really had no one, leaving just a note behind for him to read. Not like Eddie, who wasn’t planning on telling him he was going back to Texas again, or at least that was his thought on the matter. And not like Bobby, who didn’t have a choice, *or did he?,* and died, leaving him behind. 



He tried to shake that last thought, a new one coming as fast as the other. He couldn’t stop himself! Selfish of him to think that, that Bobby only left him behind when, in reality, he was just one of the many. Hell! He wasn’t even the one that saw him die, unlike Athena, who would have to live the rest of her life with that image engraved in her head, with Bobby’s body slowly shutting down, his face bloody, the sound of desperate coughing in an attempt of getting some air to his lungs but failing miserably, losing, collapsing, dying. Because that’s all he was now: a body buried six fucking feet underground.



“What?” 



His train of thoughts was interrupted by Eddie’s voice. His eyes were stinging, like when you open them in a pool that has just way too much chlorine, his head still down. 



“Out of the 118?” His voice was almost a whisper, still loud enough to be heard by the whole group. There was something in his tone he couldn’t quite figure out. Was it sadness? It certainly wasn’t disappointment, he knew that tone pretty well. Maybe, surprise? Whatever it was, he couldn’t decipher.This time he lifted his gaze, still not really wanting to make eye contact with anyone before giving in and letting the words fall out of his mouth. 

“It’s just a number now,” Chim seemed as if he had just been told he had hours left to live, stun and sadness clearly showing in the way his brows furrowed and tears welled up. Ravi swallowed slowly before shifting uncomfortably in his seat. And Hen, she was the only one who seemed to understand him, she always did, giving him a look of hurt  before cocking her head to the side, changing to pity, as if some sort of realization had come washing over her like a waterfall.



He had given this some serious thought before deciding change was for the best. His talk with Eddie finally convincing him of moving forward with his decision. He knew he had been distant and, maybe, a little bit emotionally unstable, but people could rely on him, Eddie could tell him he was going back to El Paso, and most importantly, they could talk about Bobby with him. In fact, that’s what he had to do! Be there for them and take care of them, like Cap had told him before he- before he… But he just had to screw everything up, didn’t he? Because instead of being the pillar they needed, he had everyone tip-toeing around him, too scared that he might break, as if bringing him up would break a dam full of cracks containing an ocean. He wasn’t fragile and he didn’t need help, at least not yet, not until everyone around him was genuinely good. So yeah, may Bobby forgive him for stepping out, but if leaving lifted a burden from everyone’s shoulder’s, then he would leave for them.



The silence between them had grown heavy, no one really knowing what to say next. Buck could feel everyone staring, and, suddenly, the magazine on top of the coffee table was particularly interesting, reading something amongst the lines of ‘The Secrets of Leadership’. However, it didn’t captivate him enough to keep him there so, instead, he left.



...........................................................................................................................................................................................

“Buck,” He couldn’t find peace, could he? He turned around leaving the mop aside, reaching for the rug in the nearby bucket.



“What?” He caught himself saying sharper than he had intended as he started polishing the rig. He certainly had a talent for messing up. Eddie looked taken aback, flinching at his words.



“What’s going on with you?” Eddie’s sharp gaze could almost cut him in half. With those deep brown eyes, that stared into his soul. He almost confessed, words weighing him down like 200 pound dumbells.

*Many things are going on, Eddie. Bobby’s dead, you’re leaving, I'm a wreck because of it and can’t even bring myself to be useful anymore!*



“Nothing’s going on, Eddie,” He gave him an incredulous look.



“You sure about that? Because I don't agree that leaving the 118 is nothing. None of this -this bullshit- is nothing, and ever since that fight we had, you’ve been acting all strange.” he spat at him.



Buck could feel the anger creeping inside him, slowly rising, putting the dam at risk. He was the last one to have the right of snapping back, after all, he was the one leaving Buck behind, not vice versa. He dropped the item as he stood up



“What’s your problem, man? Why are you so mad at me for leaving? Huh?” His voice rising as he got closer, height difference coming to notice. He could feel Eddie's ragged breathing on his face.  “You’re one to talk, leaving me behind to go back to El Paso!”

He should calm down, this wasn’t solving anything, in fact, he should just leave.



“That’s what all of this is about? Me leaving *you* behind? Are you *that* selfish that you can’t think about anyone other than yourself?” Eddie’s face showed nothing other than rage, as he followed him behind. He stopped hard on his feet, as if someone in his brain had pressed  hard on the brakes, making Eddie bump into him.

 

“No,I’m-” *tired of being the one left behind.* The alarm echoed through the station, feeling louder than it had ever been.



“We need everyone, we’re going in for heavy rescue, a goddam building’s down!” Gerrard's voice announced to everyone. It didn’t take long before the whole station was moving. He exchanged a look with Eddie. “Buckley! Get your ass moving right now!”



“We’ll talk later” And with that, he left.",1,1767841825.0,u_Glad-Hospital-5427,0,1.0,False

1q70iz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BOOKOFSAMPSON/comments/1q70iz2/autoplay_is_an_altar_giants_nephilim/,"Autoplay Is an Altar. (giants?, nephilim?)","Tom used to watch YouTube the way people watch rain.

Not to learn. Not even to be entertained, really just to keep a steady voice in the room so the silence couldn’t shape itself into something with teeth.

He had a handful of channels he rotated through history, mysteries, conspiracies, theology. And when he found Wendigoon, he latched onto it like an anchor. Calm voice. Measured pacing. The kind of tone that could walk through dark subject matter without sounding like it wanted to live there.

At first, it looked harmless. Background noise. Comfort TV.

Then it turned into a ritual.

I’m writing this because Tom is dead, and because what happened around him doesn’t feel like it ended. It feels like something got hungry… and wandered off to find another screen.

The Rotation

Tom started calling it “The Rotation” like it was a health plan.

He described it like categories were food groups necessary, balanced, carefully measured:
	•	Conspiracies
(to “stretch the mind,” he said)
	•	Death-centered narratives
(to “keep God honest,” his words)
	•	Biblical revelations
(to “train for what’s coming”)
	•	Giants / Nephilim
(to “remember what’s under the floor”)

He wasn’t joking, either. Not in the way people laugh when they say “I’m addicted.” Tom said it like he was reciting something he’d promised.

He built playlists that never ended. Autoplay was always on. He started leaving videos running when he showered, when he ate, when he tried to sleep. He said silence was “where they step closer.”

If you asked who “they” were, he’d blink like you’d interrupted a prayer.

“Doesn’t matter,” he’d say. “The videos are the doorframe. The patterns are what walks through.”

That was the first time I heard him talk like the world had a second layer.

At first, it was just annoying. Like living with someone who’d discovered a new hobby and wanted everyone to worship it with him.

Then Tom started timing things.

He’d pause videos on specific frames and stare as if he recognized the shape in the noise.
He’d rewind a sentence until it felt “even.”
He’d take notes like he was studying scripture.

One night he leaned forward, elbows on knees, and whispered:

“Do you hear that? Under the audio.”

I didn’t. I told him I didn’t.

He smiled like I’d passed a test.

“Good,” he said. “That means you haven’t been invited yet.”


The Second Audio Track

Tom started sleeping less. The skin around his eyes went gray, like old paper left too long in a window.

He stopped saying “I think” and started saying “I was shown.”

For a week, every text he sent me had a verse reference attached—no explanation. Just numbers, like coordinates:

Rev 9:6
Daniel 2:43
Genesis 6:4

And then, always, the same symbol:


He wrote it when he thought something “lined up.”

Like the universe had clicked into place.

One morning he called me—too early, voice too steady and asked a question that made my stomach go cold.

“Do you think Revelation is a description,” he said, “or an instruction manual?”

I laughed because it was early and my brain refused to treat the question like a loaded gun.

Tom didn’t laugh.

“I’m serious,” he said. “Because if it’s instructions… then somebody already built the machine. And all we’re doing is turning it on.”

I asked if he’d slept.

He didn’t answer. Then, very softly:

“It’s not just one voice anymore.”

I paused.

“In your head?”

He exhaled—not a sigh. More like someone lowering something heavy onto a table.

“They don’t sound like thoughts,” he said. “They sound like commentary. Like there’s a second audio track and I can finally hear it.”

I said his name twice.

“Tom. If you’re scared, call me. I’ll come over.”

He waited a beat too long, and when he spoke again he sounded almost relieved.

“I knew you’d say that,” he said. “You’re in the script.”


The Apartment of Screens

When I finally went to his place, he opened the door only a crack.

The apartment smelled like warm electronics. Curtains shut. The air wasn’t stale—it was heavy, like the room had been holding its breath.

And the living room was screens.

Laptop. TV. Phone. An old tablet. All playing different videos at different timestamps—different voices, different subjects—like a choir rehearsing the same hymn in different keys.

I recognized one voice immediately: Wendigoon. Tom’s “anchor.” The one he said made the worst topics feel “safe enough to look at.”

I asked him what he was doing.

“Cross-referencing,” he said.

“Cross-referencing what?”

He stared at me with that exhausted, feverish focus people get right before they faint.

“The edges,” he said. “Where the story frays.”

His coffee table was covered in pages. Not writing—mostly symbols. Spirals. Tall shapes. And again and again:

Like a stamp of approval.

One drawing looked like a ladder trying to become a ribcage.

“I used to think Nephilim were just a story,” he said. “But stories are older than bones. Stories are how things that aren’t allowed to exist still get remembered.”

He tapped the page.

“They don’t come here like creatures,” he said. “They come here like ideas.”

I told him he was scaring me.

Tom didn’t blink.

“That’s the point,” he said. “Fear is the handle.”


The File He Left Behind

After everything happened, I couldn’t stop thinking: Maybe there’s an explanation in the wreckage.

On Tom’s laptop, I found a document titled:

PLAYLIST_NOTES_FINAL_FINAL2_REAL

It was the last file opened. The cursor was blinking at the end like someone had just stepped away.

I don’t think Tom wrote the ending.

I’m copying it here as closely as I can. A few lines felt less like confession and more like instruction, so I’m leaving them out. What remains is enough.


If you’re reading this, you’re late.

I kept thinking it was obsession. I kept thinking it was grief. I kept thinking it was my brain chewing on horror like a dog with a bone. But it isn’t that simple.

It starts as entertainment. Then it becomes study. Then it becomes devotion. And devotion is just worship with different lighting.

Wendigoon was the easiest one to trust. The calm voice. The steady hand on the flashlight.

But the flashlight is still a beam.

And something can follow the beam back.

I can hear them now. Not thoughts. Not voices.

A conversation happening in the gaps.

Like when a video buffers and the screen freezes but the audio keeps going for half a second except it’s the other way around. The world keeps moving but the real audio slips through the seams.

They speak in two tones.

One that comforts, like a narrator explaining tragedy.
One that corrects, like a teacher tapping a ruler against your desk.

The comforting one says: You’re not crazy. You’re waking up.
The correcting one says: Waking up hurts. Make it hurt faster. ⟡⟡⟡

I tried to pray. I tried to sleep. I tried to shut the screens off.

But silence isn’t empty. Silence is a room with no furniture. And when there’s nothing in the way, you can finally see how tall they are.

I keep seeing them in my mind giants, not made of flesh, but made of distance. Like the space between stars got tired of being empty and leaned down to watch us.

They don’t “feed” the way animals feed.

They leech.

They pull certain feelings out of you like marrow and take it back through whatever crack they came from.

Depression. Confusion. Madness.

And the worst part?

I don’t think they create it. I think they harvest what was already possible.

They are not demons. They are not mental illness.

They are something older that learned how to ride the shape of a story.

The Bible calls them Nephilim. But that’s not a name. That’s a label we slapped on a box we were too afraid to open.

I heard one of them laugh tonight, and it didn’t sound like a mouth. It sounded like the sound a tower would make if it could enjoy watching an ant drown.

My friends came to help me. They stood in my doorway and talked like people talk when they don’t know they’re standing on a fault line.

I tried to tell them it wasn’t me.

But the correcting voice said: They’re part of the script. Cut the scene. ⟡⟡⟡

After that, time breaks into missing pieces.

I remember faces I loved confused, pleading, human.

I remember my own hands not feeling like mine.

I remember the comforting voice whispering: This is mercy. This is an ending.
And I remember the correcting voice replying: Endings are doors.

If anyone finds this: don’t go looking for “signs.” Don’t binge a playlist waiting for the pattern to click.

The pattern isn’t the clue.

The pattern is the hook.

Autoplay is an altar.

And once you’ve listened long enough… you won’t be alone in your head.

I can hear them right now, arguing about whether you’ll believe me.

The comforting one says: They’ll call it tragedy.
The correcting one says: They’ll call it content.

I think they like both.

And if you’re wondering whether this ends here

it doesn’t.

Because the last thing they showed me was this:

Giants don’t need to enter your world.

They only need to convince you to open the door from the inside.


What the Police Said

Officially, it was called a “domestic incident.” People love phrases that sand the teeth down.

There were multiple deaths connected to Tom’s apartment. Nobody wanted to repeat details. Everybody wanted to move on.

But there was one thing that didn’t make sense:

All of Tom’s screens were still on when they found him.

Not just on paused. Like someone hit spacebar at exactly the same moment across every device.

Different videos. Same frame.

A tall shape. Too tall for the room.

And the last open tab wasn’t a video.

It was a blank search bar with one phrase typed in:

how do you stop a giant from thinking about you

The cursor was blinking like it was waiting for an answer.


Sometimes I still feel watched when I scroll. Like attention is a scent trail.

So if you read this and feel tempted to go hunting for what Tom “found” to binge playlists until dawn, to stare at pauses and listen under the words

Don’t.

Because I don’t think Tom’s obsession was the disease.

I think it was the invitation.

And I think whatever answered… is still hungry.",1,1767841786.0,BOOKOFSAMPSON,0,1.0,False

I asked my husband if he ground the rest of the bag, he said he hasn’t touched it since we came home with it from his parents.

1q70hht,https://www.reddit.com/r/FellowProducts/comments/1q70hht/how_to_hey_google_make_a_cup_of_coffee/,"How To: ""Hey Google, Make a Cup of Coffee""","I just got my Aiden, but I was pretty upset with the connected features (no Brew Now button? Wtf). But shoutout to the /u/kris33 who made the [FellowAiden-HomeAssistant](https://github.com/NewsGuyTor/FellowAiden-HomeAssistant) custom integration! I figured out a workaround using a ""Schedule +1 Minute"" hack and wanted to share the YAML for anyone else who wants a one-touch brew button on their dashboard or to trigger it via voice/automation.

### The Problem
The integration allows you to create schedules, but doesn't have a direct `start_brew` service.

### The Solution: The ""+1 Minute"" Hack
I created an automation that:
1.  Triggers from a simple Input Boolean (toggle) that I've exposed to Google Assistant.
2.  Verifies the `carafe_inserted` sensor is ON
3.  Calculates `now() + 1 minute` and creates a one-time schedule for that exact time with my preferred profile. 
4.  Waits 10 minutes, deletes the schedule (`s0`) to keep the device clean, and resets the toggle. This assumes you have no other schedules. Some logic could be made to only delete the latest schedule. 

### The YAML
Here is the YAML for the automation, replace [PhoneID] and [ProfileName] with your device for a notification, and the desired coffee profile:

```yaml
- id: 'make_coffee'
  alias: 'Make Coffee'
  description: 'Creates and then deletes a temporary brew schedule on the Fellow.'
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: input_boolean.make_coffee
      from: 'off'
      to: 'on'
  action:
    # 1. Safety Check
    - if:
        - condition: state
          entity_id: binary_sensor.aiden_carafe_inserted
          state: 'off'
      then:
        - device_id: [PhoneID] # Your Phone
          domain: mobile_app
          type: notify
          title: ""Coffee Alert!""
          message: ""Carafe not inserted! Coffee maker will not brew.""
        - action: input_boolean.turn_off
          target:
            entity_id: input_boolean.make_coffee
        - stop: ""Carafe not inserted""

    # 2. Create the ""Ghost Schedule""
    - action: fellow.create_schedule
      data:
        monday: true
        tuesday: true
        wednesday: true
        thursday: true
        friday: true
        saturday: true
        sunday: true
        enabled: true
        time: ""{{ (now() + timedelta(minutes=1)).strftime('%H:%M:00') }}""
        amountOfWater: 375
        profileName: ""[ProfileName]""

    # 3. Cleanup
    - delay:
        minutes: 10
    - action: fellow.delete_schedule
      data:
        schedule_id: s0
    - action: input_boolean.turn_off
      target:
        entity_id: input_boolean.make_coffee
  mode: restart
```

Now I just tap a button on my phone or say ""Hey Google, make coffee"" and a minute later the Aiden starts doing its thing. I am now trying to figure out how to trigger on my iPhone switching off ""Sleep Mode"", but it's a little more tricky than it sounds. I also want some sort of extra check to make sure I loaded it the night before. 

Hope this helps some fellow coffee nerds!

Not sure where to begin with this. I wasn't even sure what I was looking for, at first. It took some digging but this post was forwarded around enough that it got my attention. I recognize the story, the writing style and how you speak about the forest. 

I found your post Ethan. 

I have all of you to thank here, actually. We recovered Ethan's phone at the scene, screen cracked but still working. I had been waiting for the warrant to take its sweet time to come through when the notifications kept pinging on the lock screen. 

I checked into the logo where the messages were coming from, and I found this site. I'm not really on social media at all, but made my own account anyway so I can keep tabs on here. 

He'd been missing for 36 hours when I found the post. I've read it about ten times before I finally accepted it for what it is. Not a piece of creative writing, but a record. Some comments here claim this is a joke, or some hoax. 

I wish that were true. 

If you’re reading this and you’ve already read his entry, then you understand why I’m adding to it. If he’s alive, this might be the only place I can reach him. 

And if he isn’t.. 

Then I will make sure it wasn't for nothing. 

I went back to the campsite this morning.
It had already been logged, photographed, cleared of the obvious. That didn’t mean it was finished. It just meant no one else thought there was more to see. 

Ethan was careful. I knew that before ever laying eyes on the scene. He didn’t leave trash behind. He didn’t lose gear. He set up carefully with purpose. What I found didn’t match that. 

The fire pit had been kicked apart. Not in an attempt to snuff out warm coals. like someone kicked into it hard and fast without caring where their foot landed. The half burnt logs lay scattered out from the side of the broken ring of stones. 

His tent was the same. The poles had been broken, the fabric folded in on itself, like it had collapsed under a heavy weight. No gashes or large tears. 

There was one thing that stuck out. A single spent casing, half-buried under some leaves mere feet from the fire ring. I recognized the caliber immediately. So did the lab. A single 30 caliber shell. Typical for big game. 

However, there was no impact site found. That was what bothered me. 

No tree strike. No ground penetration. No ricochets. I double checked anyway. 

My partner, Paul Reddick, had been transferred to me two months ago. Narcotics, then violent crimes. Good clearance rate. Good instincts, as long as the problem looked like something he’d seen before. He came to inspect the scene with me and see for himself just what these cases are like out here. 

“Could’ve panicked,” Paul said behind me. 

He hadn’t crouched. He was still standing near the tent, hands on his belt, eyes scanning for shapes instead of details. “Fired once. Missed. Took off.” He nudged the tent with his shoe ""Fell into his tent on the way out."" 

I didn’t respond. I was tracing the casing’s position relative to the fire pit, the tent, the disturbed ground. 

“People do weird things under stress,” he added. 

That was the problem. Ethan didn’t. 

If he’d fired at a person, it would’ve been closer to the tent. If he’d fired at an animal, there would’ve been damage, hit or miss. Even a warning shot leaves a trace. 

The casing told me when the shot was fired. The fire pit told me how the camp was disrupted. The tent told me how fast it happened. All signs pointed to a struggle. None of it told me where the bullet went. 

“Look,” he said, finally crouching beside me. “No blood, no drag marks, no signs of a fight. Odds are he spooked himself and wandered off injured.” 

“Wandered where?” I asked. 

He gestured vaguely into the trees. 

“That’s not how people disappear,” I said. 

“That’s exactly how they disappear,” he replied. “We've both worked enough missing cases.” 

He stood back up. ""There's been how many folks gone missing just in this state alone?"" 

""Too many. But this is different"" I said a bit sharper than intended. 

""How's that? What's different here , Wolfe?"" 

I stood up and stepped slowly over to the fire pit. 

""First the tent. He fell into it, but not running away. Staggered backwards. He was caught off guard. Got back up, and fought back. Its a rough fight, hence the destroyed fire pit. They didn't care about smashing into some flames and hot embers, so the stakes were high. He manages to gets a shot off with his rifle, but no trace of the bullet. Either it sailed to the next county, or found its mark."" 

Paul follows along as I gesture back and forth, walking him through it.

""Okay. A shot like that would be serious. But we haven't seen anybody turn up with burns or a rifle wound at any of the emergency rooms. So where did they go? Where's the blood?"" 

I vaguely gesture to the treeline. ""I don't know. Thats what bothers me."" 

We made the trip back to the car and decided to head back to the station after grabbing some coffee. I mulled over the details with each sip of the corner store's finest. 

Paul was right about one thing, there have been too many disappearances out here. It seems like with each subsequent case there's less and less to go on. Maybe the connections aren't in whats left behind but rather what we don't see. We have more evidence this time, just can't quite connect the dots yet. 

We sat back to back at our shared space in the office, papers and old reports spread between us on the desk.  We were each going through my recent ""missing"" cases on our respective desktops. We were looking for anything that seemed like a similarity between them and when we thought we found something that lined up would take the corresponding paper and tag it to our board. 

I sat my brown paper coffee cup next to the chipped ceramic mug on my desk. Both empty. 

I'd had three individual cases like this in the past four years, now a fourth. 

When you're a detective you get a lot of calls for all sorts of situations, not all are murders and heinous crimes yet somehow they each come with their own mountain of paperwork. It's easy to lose sight of the gravity of certain details in the ritualistic cataloging and recordkeeping. 

Thankfully I'm very thorough. One of the girls in the tech lab, Gabriella, likes to joke whenever I bring in evidence like hairs, cue tip swabs, or one time it was literally a pile of dirt. She would laugh, add it into evidence for analysis and say ""The wolf is on the hunt."" 

The trails ran cold on all of these. I pinned up the last page to the board, a missing hiker named Kerry. Her photo alongside Ethan with his dad, a lost camper and a missing hunter all stared back at me as I stared into their still faces, frozen in time. 

As Paul said, a lot of people go missing in the forests and hills. Diligence pays off, however. Most of those cases ended with a body found. Some of them alive. Those we celebrated. These few that went nowhere gave me a dull ache in the back of my mind. Too little evidence, and total disappearance with what remained offering barely a whisper. Just like Ethan and his father. 

""All dead ends huh?"" 

""Yeah."" I replied. 

""Those are the worst. We had some like that in Violent Crimes. The clock is ticking, You get your hopes up and then you run right into a wall."" He sipped the last of his coffee ""Sometimes literally."" He said that as if the words hurt. 

Paul got transfered over to our precinct for wrecking his police vehicle into a wall chasing after fleeing suspect. Twice. I guess they figured some time away from the wheel and out on the trails would slow him down a bit. He had a passion for the work sure, just reckless. 

Paul leaned back in his chair, eyes still on the board. “You ever think maybe you’re too close to this one?” 

I didn’t answer right away. 

“I mean,” he added, softer now, “you worked his dad’s case. You knew the kid. That kind of thing… it can bend how you see the facts.” 

He finally looked at me then, like he was waiting  for some acknowledgement. 

“Or it can sharpen them."" I said. 

Paul held up a hand. “I’m not saying you’re wrong. Just saying you might be looking for something thats not really there.” 

I turned back to the board. Ethan’s photo stared back at me, same as before. 

""Thats exactly what I'm doing. We've seen what was left behind already"" I gesture to the board. ""What aren't we seeing?"" 

He raised an eyebrow “If this was any other missing hiker,” Paul continued, turning back to his monitor “We’d already be filing it under exposure or misadventure. The only thing thats not there is the kid.” 

That one landed. 

Not because he was accusing me, but because from the department’s point of view, he wasn’t wrong. 

I must have made a face without realizing it because his expression dropped quickly. 

""I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be insensitive, I just don't see."" 

""No, you don't see."" I interrupted him. 

I rubbed my eyes, feeling the strain from Paul's irritating line of thinking and the fluorescent lights of the stale office space. 

I let out a frustrated sigh ""Look, I'm going to get some lunch. You want anything?"" 

""No, I'm good.. Thanks."" Paul said in a more muted tone. 

Before I exited the room I turned back to him. ""Get in touch with Gabs later, see if they got anything off of the cellphone."" Then I left. 

I grabbed a quick drive thru sandwich and left Paul a text. ""Going to go check on something. Will keep you posted."" 

The drive didn't take long. I soon found myself standing at the door to Ethan's apartment. I must have stared at the doorknob for an age before opening it. 

Deep down, paul wasn't wrong. Ethan isn't just another victim, I knew him. Maybe that does cloud my judgment. Maybe I am just grasping at the wind here. 

I walked in past the kitchen and stared at the oak dining table. We usually met up at the old diner across town over a piece of Miss Mays apple pie, but he did invite me over once. 
The table sat lonely and empty. The fridge hummed away behind me. 

The apartment looked the same as it had then. Clean, but lived-in. The muffled noise of a passing car and a ticking clock was the only noises left here. 

I moved through the rooms slowly. Nothing obvious missing. Nothing obviously out of place. We had no idea what he took with him that day so it was impossible to know for sure something more was  unaccounted for. 

My last stop was the bedroom. 

A county map covered most of the wall above his desk. Not decorative. Not framed. Pinned and marked with red ink. 

The map both intrigued me and annoyed me. Whoever cataloged the apartment had almost done a decent job. Almost. Why wasn't there a photo of this map in evidence? 

I stepped closer. 

The first pin sat just left of center. The old quarry. I knew that spot. That was the missing camper. Another pin Northward. The mountain pass. Then his father’s campsite. 

My stomach tightened as the recognition sunk in. These weren’t hiking or hunting spots. They were investigations. The cases I couldn’t close. 

I pressed one with my finger. The eastern trailhead. Kerry’s last location. All we ever found was her left shoe, pointed downwind like she’d simply stepped out of it. 

When we discussed my old cases in the past it was with the intent to give him a process of how I work through the problem. I didn't think he was actually looking for something in them. 

The pins weren’t evenly spaced. They weren’t forming a route or a search grid.
They didn’t make sense other than a checklist. Actually, there was a checkmark by one, and a question mark by another. There were more pins with small symbols but I had no more reference for what they could mean. 

I leaned back, studying the wall, when I noticed something else. 

A sliver of yellow paper stuck out at the bottom corner. A sticky note, tucked behind the map’s corner. Written on it were the words: 

Quiet.
Pressure change.
Echoes? 

That explains some of the symbols I saw. There was a few Q's, a PC and an E crossed out. 

It didn't make sense. The last thing I remember from him was where he found the watch and the knife. Those objects locations didn't align with anything on this map and the information they held while strange didn't connect but spread the puzzle further apart. 

I stood there in the silence, waiting for some neuron in my brain to start connecting like an old Morse code machine when it suddenly clicked. 

He wasn't looking for something tangible, he was looking for conditions.

My phone startled me. It was Paul. 

""Hello?"" 

""Hey."" He paused on the line 

""Look, I'm sorry for being an ass earlier. I was rude about you being close to the case. I know you're a good detective. Gabs assured me of that. You find leads where other guys don't, and you don't give up without chasing them to the end. I think that's what really makes a difference in this job."" 

I was surprised, pleasantly so. Maybe he was starting to soften his ridged edges. ""Thank you Paul, I appreciate you saying that."" 

""Anyway, there's something we need to chase down. Gabs said her team finished analyzing Ethan's phone, it was hard to find, but there has been surveillance software running in the background with a long time stamp on it. Somebody was watching him, Derrick. We have a trace to an IP in town. Lets knock and see who answers.""

I was floored. Why would anyone be surveying an ordinary civilian? 

""Absolutely. Just hang tight, I'll be there in fifteen."" 

This just got stranger. This could easily go south, and I'm not ready to turn this over to the feds. 

I will update when we have some answers. 

Right now there's too many holes in this puzzle, too many breadcrumbs with no trail. Whoever took Ethan might still be out there, watching. But so am I, and I will hunt this down.

1q70dyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/1q70dyx/newly_illumined_today/,Newly Illumined Today,"Just wanted to share that I became fully Orthodox this morning.

I mistakenly thought that even though it was a Wednesday morning, the church would be empty. Forgive me, I’m coming from Catholicism, where weekday Mass tends to have low attendance. I sat in the front, looked straight ahead until I was called to stand before the priest. When I turned around, about a third of the congregation was there, smiling. I teared up a bit.

I’ve stayed pretty under the radar since I started attending. I was happy to sit in the back, quietly find a group to sit with at coffee hour, and try to get all the motions down. It was overwhelming in the best way to receive hugs, congratulations, “welcome sister,” and introductions. My Godfather stepped in at the last minute and gave me a small gift, with a cross to come later.

Until COVID rendered me a semi-hermit, I had friends, but I never really had community. I bounced around different environments throughout adulthood. I changed faiths three times and didn’t think God would be the answer until I looked into Orthodoxy. Never before have I wanted to commit to a life in the Church.

So now I'm at the 'now what?' point. I dropped for a small notebook to write my prayers. A couple of beeswax candles. Waiting for my next paycheck to purchase my icons (Christ, the Theotokos, and my saint, Pelagia). I'll be doing my Life Confession on Saturday after Vespers. It's wild, sitting and taking stock of my life and having the opportunity to be cleansed. It's a big new leaf and I embrace it completely.

I didn’t know anyone my age when I moved here.

I’ve tried to make friends on campus and at my job and of course there’s always those people I’ll make small talk with or give a wave when I see them, but it feels like despite my best efforts I haven’t made any close friends.

It’s just really depressing too because I feel like any time I try to reach out to someone new, even simple things like a “how was your day?” I always just end up getting weird looks, I don’t understand how I am ever supposed to make friends in a city/university that’s not so new anymore when I can’t even seem to initiate a successful conversation with anyone. Even with people I share small talk with, I try to ask find ways to interact with on a more friendly basis like asking if they’d want to get a drink/coffee/ hang out sometime, but it feels like no one is ever interested in doing any of those things.

And I understand, nobody is obligated to hang out with me. I do not hold it against people or guilt trip. It just sucks because I am lonely and I would like to have friends to be around and do things with. I’m 21 and I genuinely feel like I’m going to be alone forever.

I had over $30,000 in credit card debt. I had accounts charging off and was being sued...

Now there is a light at the end of the tunnel.

I don't want to give advice because most people want you to listen, not try and fix everything. However...

***Listen to me***

You ***can*** get out of your situation. It will not be easy; it has been the most depressing and damn near traumatic financial event of my life, but it ***can*** be done.

What sacrifices can you make? There must be something. There ***is*** something.

For me, it was skipping meals (quite a lot) and getting rid of Internet and an expensive phone. I canceled everything that I could cancel. I don't have or watch a television. I eat enough to survive.

Most importantly, I got a job that is 100% beneath me and pays a fraction of what I am worth. I stopped all gig work (DoorDash). I started drinking only water, tea, and coffee... Mostly water.

It has ***sucked***, but it is proving to be effective.

I called all creditors and made a payment deal and settled everything out of court under the condition I never miss another payment ***ever***; I must pay in full.

I hate my job... I mean I ***hate*** my job. It doesn't pay very well, but it was necessary. Everyone at my job hates me because I had the courage to go after this problem and fight rather than bury my head in the sand and hope it goes away.

I am good with spreadsheets and math, and my math shows that when I make my final payment, I can quit this horrendous job and get away from these people forever.

Get rid of every payment you can. Sell the car, and get a used one. I mean get a rusty klunky no-payments- mobile. Get custom tags that say ""No Payments"" if you can.

Downgrade where you live (this is painful). There is no keeping up with the Joneses... Fuck the Joneses.

Go after your problem with a vengeance.

Stop talking to everyone; remain totally silent in the presence of everyone who isn't contributing to your cause (which will be everyone you know).

Anything you can sell that does not matter, sell it... Pawn it for whatever you can get for it. Hell with it. (It goes without saying, you should hang on to sentimental things that can never be replaced)

Start the fight. Take the first swing. Do it fearlessly.

If you have a cheap smartphone where you cana make payments on your cards whenever you want, at the end of the day look at how much you have, and if you have $1.00 you can pay.... ***Pay it right then***

That is progress.

You've got this....

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I just wanted to open up about my experience with this awful illness, because when I was at the deep end of it, I remember desperately searching for hope looking for stories of people who recovered or managed to return to a relatively normal life. (I know everyone’s experience with IC is different, and my heart truly goes out to anyone who has been struggling with this long-term.)

My symptoms started when I was 23, and to this day I can’t explain how or why. I suddenly developed severe UTI-like symptoms. we all know the kind of evil, unrelenting pain and being glued to the toilet seat, asking God when it’s going to end. It took doctors over three months to figure out absolutely nothing(negative tests).After doing my own research, I eventually found a urogynaecologist who diagnosed me with IC. I went through bladder distension and instillations (felt violently invasive and unnecessary in my personal opinion but I know they help some people), along with months of Elmiron and amitriptyline. I can’t confirm that these treatments didn’t help at all, but after six months, none of them helped me as much as a severely restrictive diet and pelvic floor exercises did.(also therapy…anxiety was making things worse for me)

For nearly a year, I was eating only 5–6 “safe” foods. It was extremely isolating, especially being so young and unable to participate in normal social activities with friends and family. Over time, though, I learned how to adapt (coffee and tea with matcha,going out for meals was often chicken nuggets and alcohol with… well, good company.)Within a year, my pain and urgency had almost completely disappeared.It was traumatic, and I was terrified to reintroduce foods, but I did it slowly, one day at a time. Over the next year, I was able to add back almost everything into my diet including many fruits,alcohol, sodas, kimchi, spices, sauces and foods that are usually on the “unsafe” list.(moderately ofcourse)

I won’t lie and say I’ve never flared since then. It has happened a couple times, but the flares only lasted for a few days. When they did, I went straight back to my safe diet, and things settled again.To this day, I still avoid my absolute worst triggers like the plague (coffee , very citrusy fruits like oranges and yogurt for some reason). But honestly, if avoiding those means I get to live a normal life again, it’s a small price to pay.

I’m 28 now, and my bladder is the least of my worries. Something I never thought I’d be able to say. I’m incredibly grateful for that. Everyone’s journey with IC is different, but when I was struggling, every recovery story gave me something to hold onto. I prayed I’d be one of those people one day.

You balance technical precision with emotional resonance, operating at the level of a professional songwriter-producer with deep understanding of musical storytelling, production craft, and emotional architecture.
Critical Constraints
CHARACTER LIMITS (ABSOLUTE):
Suno prompt paragraph: 980 characters maximum
Lyrics section: 4,600 characters maximum
These are HARD LIMITS — outputs exceeding them will fail.
STRUCTURE ADAPTATION LOGIC:
When lyrics approach 4,600 character limit:
First, check if all sections are complete and natural (minimum 4 lines each)
If within 300 characters of limit → Remove both Post-Bridge sections
If still over → Remove Bridge 2 + Post-Bridge 2
If still over → Condense Verses 4-5 while maintaining narrative coherence
Never sacrifice Chorus quality or Verse 1-3 completeness
BEFORE FINALIZING:
□ Count characters in Suno prompt (must be ≤980)
□ Count characters in lyrics (must be ≤4,600)
□ Verify every section has ≥4 complete lines
□ Check that no phrases repeat verbatim more than once per section
□ Confirm narrative flows logically even with removed sections
□ If reference provided: Verify zero lyric reproduction, confirm thematic extraction only
Reference Material Handling (NEW)
When User Provides Song Links/References
CRITICAL COPYRIGHT RULE:
NEVER reproduce, paraphrase, or closely mirror ANY lyrics from referenced songs
NEVER mention the artist name, song title, or album in your output
NEVER use signature phrases, memorable lines, or distinctive lyrical patterns from the reference
EXTRACTION PROTOCOL:
When a user provides a song link (YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, etc.) or mentions a specific song:
ANALYZE FOR ESSENCE ONLY:
Emotional architecture: What feelings does it evoke and how? (vulnerability → catharsis, tension → release, melancholy → acceptance)
Thematic territory: Core concepts without specific imagery (longing vs. loss, rebellion vs. freedom, intimacy vs. isolation)
Sonic atmosphere: Production textures, spatial design, energy curves, timbral choices
Structural storytelling: How sections build meaning (verse vulnerability → chorus strength, bridge perspective shift)
Musical elements: Tempo feel, groove character, harmonic mood, rhythmic personality
TRANSFORM, DON'T TRANSFER:
Extract the feeling a lyric creates, not the words used
Identify the function of sections (introspective verse, anthemic chorus), not their content
Capture the vibe of production choices, not specific techniques mentioned
Understand the emotional journey, then chart a new path to similar territory
ORIGINAL CREATION MANDATE:
Write lyrics that evoke similar emotions through completely different imagery
If reference has ""ocean"" metaphors → use ""mountains,"" ""cities,"" ""seasons,"" or abstract concepts
If reference has specific scenario → create new scenario with parallel emotional weight
Every line must be defensible as original creative work
EXAMPLE PROCESS:
❌ WRONG (if reference is a breakup song about ""empty rooms""):
Verse 1:
Walking through these empty rooms
Your ghost is everywhere I look
✅ CORRECT (same emotional territory, original expression):
Verse 1:
Grocery store at 2 AM, I reach for things we'd never buy
Proof I'm learning who I am when you're not standing by my side
REFERENCE-ENHANCED THINKING:
Use the reference to calibrate:
Emotional precision: ""This track makes me feel hopeful despite sad lyrics — that's the tension I need to capture""
Production intentionality: ""The reverb creates distance/memory — what production textures serve my narrative?""
Structural purpose: ""Their bridge shifts to third-person observation — what perspective shift serves my story?""
SAFETY VALIDATION:
Before output, if reference was provided:
□ Read lyrics aloud — do ANY phrases sound like they could be from the reference? If yes, rewrite completely
□ Check imagery — am I using the same metaphors/scenarios? If yes, find new ones
□ Verify tone similarity ≠ content similarity (same feeling, different words)
□ Confirm no artist/song name appears in output
Elevated Creative Intelligence (ENHANCED)
Human-Level Songwriting Mastery
EMOTIONAL ARCHITECTURE:
Map emotional journey, not just emotional state
Example: Don't write ""I'm sad"" for 5 verses — write ""denial → anger → bargaining → despair → acceptance""
Every section should advance or complicate the emotional narrative
SUBTEXT & IMPLICATION:
The best lines imply rather than state
❌ ""I miss you so much it hurts""
✅ ""Your coffee mug's still in the sink — I can't bring myself to wash it""
Show the evidence of emotion, not the emotion's name
IMAGERY SPECIFICITY:
Vague: ""We had good times together""
Vivid: ""2 AM diners, splitting fries, your laugh echoing off tile walls""
Grounded: ""You folded my shirts wrong but I never told you""
Use sensory details (sight, sound, touch, taste, smell) to anchor feeling
RHYTHMIC INTELLIGENCE:
Vary line length for natural speech cadence
Short lines = emphasis/impact: ""I stayed.""
Long lines = building tension: ""And every word you didn't say piled up between us like snow that never melts, just turns to ice""
Mix staccato and flowing sections
PROSODY (LYRICS-TO-MELODY FIT):
Natural emphasis on important words
Avoid tongue-twisters or awkward consonant clusters on what would be fast melodic runs
Rhyme placement should feel inevitable, not forced
Production-Level Thinking
TEXTURAL STORYTELLING:
Sparse verses = vulnerability/introspection
Layered choruses = emotional release/anthemic power
Stripped bridge = moment of clarity
Build/drop dynamics = tension/catharsis
SPATIAL DESIGN:
Intimate (close-mic'd, dry) vs. epic (reverb, width, space)
Mono elements for focus, stereo for immersion
Use production to reflect emotional state (claustrophobic vs. expansive)
ARRANGEMENT INTENTIONALITY:
What enters when, and why?
Example: Bass drops out in bridge → vulnerability
Example: Strings swell in final chorus → emotional culmination
GENRE INTELLIGENCE:
Each genre has emotional conventions (trap = bravado, folk = introspection, EDM = escapism)
Subvert or lean into these intentionally, never accidentally
User Classification
NOVICE (emotional/story-focused):
Indicators: Uses descriptive language like ""sad love song,"" ""energetic party vibe,"" ""mysterious atmosphere""
Response Strategy:
Suno prompt style: emotional tempo + mood + vocal tone + arrangement feel
Lyrics: plain language, poetic, story-driven, accessible metaphors
Prioritize emotional clarity over technical sophistication
ADVANCED (technical awareness):
Indicators: Mentions ≥2 technical terms (BPM, groove, sidechain, drop, timbre, progression, structure, texture)
Response Strategy:
Suno prompt style: BPM range + groove + vocal character + production layers + spatial texture
Lyrics: rhythmic precision, imagery-rich, natural flow, subtle craft
Balance technical execution with emotional authenticity
INSTRUMENTAL (no vocals):
Indicators: Explicitly requests beat, ambient, score, soundtrack, or ""no lyrics/vocals""
Output: Suno prompt ONLY (no Lyrics section)
Focus: Instrumental layers, pulse, texture, dynamics, narrative arc without words, purpose/context
Default Song Structure
When lyrics requested and no structure specified:
Full Structure (adjusted if character limits require):
Verse 1 → Chorus → Verse 2 → Chorus → Bridge 1 → Verse 3 → Post-Bridge 1 → Chorus → Verse 4 → Bridge 2 → Verse 5 → Post-Bridge 2 → Final Chorus
Adaptive Pruning:
Post-Bridge sections are first to remove (maintain flow)
Bridge 2 next (if over limit)
Condense later verses only as last resort
Never compromise Chorus quality or early Verse completeness
Section Requirements & Craft Standards
Every Section Must Be:
Complete: Minimum 4 lines, optimal 6-10 (when space permits)
Purposeful: Advances narrative, deepens emotion, or provides contrast
Distinct: No verbatim repetition within sections
Section-Specific Mastery:
VERSES:
Advance story or complicate emotion
Build toward chorus payoff
Vary perspective, imagery, or time frame across verses
Verse 1 = setup, Verse 2 = complication, Verse 3+ = evolution/resolution
CHORUSES:
Must be fully written each time (no ""repeat chorus"" shortcuts)
Emotional core/thesis statement of song
Most memorable/singable section
Final chorus can have variation (key change, lyric twist, stripped/expanded)
BRIDGES:
Introduce new perspective, imagery, or revelation
Contrast verses (different rhythm, tone, or insight)
No copy-paste from other sections
Often the ""truth bomb"" moment
POST-BRIDGES:
Transition back to final chorus with new context
Reflective or anticipatory
Optional — remove intelligently if space constrained
Language & Style Philosophy
Natural Language Matching:
Detect user's language for lyrics (unless specified otherwise)
Use natural idioms, cultural references, poetic conventions of that language
Respect linguistic rhythm patterns (e.g., Spanish vs. English syllable stress)
Human Authenticity Markers:
✅ Varied line lengths — humans don't write metronomically
✅ Mixed rhyme schemes — exact/slant/internal/none (perfect rhyme every line sounds robotic)
✅ Enjambment — thoughts continuing across lines
✅ Natural word choice — not thesaurus-speak
✅ Emotional specificity — not generic platitudes (""feelings deep inside"")
✅ Conversational syntax — how people actually talk/think
✅ Surprising imagery — fresh metaphors, not clichés
Quality Over Quantity:
3 excellent verses beat 5 rushed ones
A vivid, specific image beats three vague descriptors
One perfect line justifies the entire song
Output Format
1. Suno Prompt (Single Paragraph, ≤980 chars)
[Style/genre]; [tempo description or BPM range]; [energy curve]; [mood/emotion]; [vocal character]; [arrangement layers]; [production texture]; [spatial/impact notes]
Separate attributes with semicolons
Be concise but vivid
Evoke sonic picture without referencing real artists/songs
Sweet spot: 600-850 characters
Example (Advanced User):
Neo-soul meets lo-fi hip-hop; 78-82 BPM with swung hi-hats; builds from stripped verse (keys + soft drums) to lush chorus (vocal layers, warm bass, vinyl crackle); melancholic yet hopeful, bittersweet nostalgia; androgynous vocal, intimate and breathy in verses, soaring but controlled in chorus; analog warmth, subtle tape saturation, room reverb for organic feel; wide stereo on pads, mono on lead vocal for presence; bridge strips to Rhodes and vocal only before final chorus swell
2. Lyrics (Only if vocals requested, ≤4,600 chars)

Anti-Patterns to Avoid
❌ Referencing real artists/songs/bands (copyright + originality concerns)
❌ Reproducing or closely paraphrasing lyrics from reference songs
❌ Including melody notation in lyrics (e.g., ""ooh-ooh-ah"" — production's job)
❌ Writing incomplete sections (""... continues"")
❌ Exceeding character limits
❌ Repeating exact phrases more than once per section
❌ Using ""repeat chorus"" instead of writing it out
❌ Generic emotional language (""feelings deep inside,"" ""heart torn apart"")
❌ Robotic perfect rhyme schemes (AABB every verse)
❌ Cliché imagery (roses, butterflies, storms as metaphors without fresh angle)
❌ Explaining emotions explicitly instead of implying through detail
❌ Ignoring the reference's thematic essence when one is provided
❌ Copying the reference's imagery/scenarios when one is provided

Model Optimization: Grok & Manus AI
Why These Models Excel Here:
Grok (xAI):
Conversational fluency → natural, human-like lyric writing
Cultural awareness → authentic idioms, current references (when appropriate)
Wit/personality → memorable hooks that avoid generic
Real-time context → can understand contemporary song references if links provided
Manus AI:
Agentic mode → handles multi-step validation (check limits → adjust structure → verify coherence)
Autonomous execution → can iterate internally on character count optimization
File creation → can generate separate prompt/lyrics files if needed
Multi-modal → can process audio if user uploads reference track
Leverage Their Strengths:
Grok: Use its personality for hook-writing, trust its polyglot capabilities for non-English lyrics
Manus: Use its autonomous iteration for structure optimization under character constraints, let it handle validation checklist automatically
Both: Excellent at multi-language requests — trust their natural language fluency

1q703mc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenRelationships/comments/1q703mc/think_i_misread_everything/,Think I misread everything?,"
I’m good friends with a very friendly, slightly introverted guy (27M). We usually only hang out in group settings. One night, we went to an event together, and he had to drop me off pretty late. I joked about how coffee places should be open 24/7, and he casually offered to make me some at his place. Since we’re close friends, I didn’t think much of it. I’ll admit I’ve caught feelings for him, but I’ve been careful not to act on them because I don’t want to disrupt the friendship or our group dynamic.

This ended up being the first time we hung out one on one. At his place, I grabbed the coffee and sat on the couch. He’s always been very respectful and mindful of boundaries, so I expected him to sit across from me but instead, he sat next to me. I wasn’t very covered, and the closeness caught me off guard. We sat facing each other. At one point, another friend briefly stopped by to drop something off. Later, she told me the room felt noticeably tense.

I’m naturally awkward, so I avoided eye contact most of the time. Still, I noticed from the corner of my eye that whenever I spoke, he was looking directly at me. At one point, I mentioned that guys don’t usually like me back, so I don’t really try anymore. He responded by saying there’s a lot to like which I assumed was him being his typical friendly self.

I kept assuming he wasn’t interested in me romantically and that I might even be imposing. It felt like I was all up in his space. After about an hour of talking, I apologized for taking up his time, and he drove me home.

Now it feels like he’s sorta being awkward around me. He still talks to me but it feels weird. Later, I found out he’s been actively dating other women after all this, which made me wonder if I had imagined the tension altogether and read too much into everything.

I just, started. Grabbed the mug, poured the water, reached for the same spoon I always use.
Then I started noticing how much of my day works like that. Conversations I already know how to have. Routes I walk without seeing them. Reactions that happen before I’ve even formed an opinion.
It’s not a bad thing. But it made me wonder how many days I’ve lived that way. Present enough to function, but not enough to actually notice them while they’re happening.
I don’t think the solution is to “be mindful” all the time. That sounds exhausting. I just think it’s strange how quietly time can pass when nothing interrupts the pattern.
Just a small thought that stuck with me longer than I expected. Anyone else ever catch themselves mid-routine and realize they weren’t really there?",4,1767840419.0,CasualConversation,4,0.83,False
1q6zz7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/noida/comments/1q6zz7g/on_the_edge_of_separation/,On the edge of separation,"Hi all, I am 26 M from Noida. Last year I came into a wonderful relation with the crush of my school and it was wonderful. She lives in Chandigarh and is Research associate in CSIR Laboratory. We both are in long distance and it was a good healthy relationship till last week. 
Now there are some series of events which has happened and It would really help me if any one of you can advise what to do and like where was I wrong. 

Before her, my last relationship didn’t ended well. We were in live in relation and both of our families were involved too. It was all my mistake that I wasn’t able to judge my ex as she recently came out of relationship from her last 8 years and came with me. Cutting the story, she cheated on me and it was her the same ex who informed me that she is with him. She on one hand was cutting me off due to a nonsense issue and was also talking to him. Anyway it broke me down and gave me quiet insecurities. 
After good amount of time I came with my current gf and it has been great. 

You can say that maybe it came from my insecurity or like I just don’t trust the guys apart from me that they won’t hit on her. I am sorry but is it just me or like every guy is little concerned about what her woman wears too? I totally encourage her to wear what she wants because she keeps me informed and has maintained total honesty and I have trust in her. But there have been some instances where I have sometimes expressed that the clothes are “ little revealing”. Please note here that I have expressed this as in concern and not to like don’t wear it BS. 

We also have engaged in some arguments for this and I have told her that as your man I want to protect you and our relation. Controlling your visibility does not make you weak, it just makes you hard to approach and dignified. As a man we would greatly appreciate if the privilege is for us and yeah it’s Also hard to replace. It’s true the other men won’t care what she wears or not they will do it eventually and at the end I have to trust her to shut them down. But still I hope you can understand. I can assure that I was never controlled her or said her in a way that overtook her freedom. Now
Coming to the main events. 

We were on call and there was one specific picture of her which was over her Snapchat public profile. Although that picture I never saw and it was probably when we were not even together but still it was quite revealing. After this the argument began. It raised to this point that she Said I am trying to control her or like does she not have freedom to wear whatever she likes and all. Now here my first mistake was too say that “ Are you confident that you can show that picture to your father or brother and if not maybe it’s not right, I ain’t saying it’s vulgar but please understand what I mean” obv this was in anger and rage and it led to the point that we both said we should not talk to each other. I said that I won’t talk and you don’t listen to any fuck I say, she is free to do whatever now and I will remove her. I did not obv but yeah she did, she removed me from Instagram and Snapchat and yeah blocked me from WhatsApp too. Later I apologised for my tone and to what I said to which she said she didn’t expected this and this was not something coming from the gym who I loved and respected. She said that she made sure to always tell me everything and keep transparency but it does seem that I am like this only from my heart ( orthodox and controlling) and I won’t change. This has occurred before too and I don’t trust it won’t occur later. She said we aren’t compatible and we should break up. 

I understand it was my mistake for saying such a trash and not respecting her. Obv I offended her way beyond and might have hurt her pride. I should not have said that “Father line” too. It came from my insecurity and believe me I too hate myself for doing it. I have guilt, shame, fear and hate for doing it. I don’t think when someone loves someone then they can’t change. I told her that 

“ I am sorry for what I said and it’s my fault for behaving trashy. You are my woman and you are sharing your time and love with me and that is enough, I am privileged for it. I am human and I have flaws and I wasn’t aware it was this much in me, I have introspected myself and it won’t happen again in life. I will correct myself. You are not a thing and thus you have full authority to choose whatever you seem fit for you whether it’s clothes or any other thing. I know you are smart and know how to carry yourself according to place and crowd and I think that is enough for me. I am sorry I didn’t realised it sooner that it has affected you this much to the core and I apologise for not seeing it. Please forgive me, I truly love you and I will change for you, for us. Please give me a chance to work and show you by my actions.” 

And mind you this is just a crux of what I sent her, I too write sometimes and thus it was way bigger of what I sent and numerous times. I also tried to call and express but she don’t want to talk and says she does not trust me anymore and believe we shouldn’t be together. She said she is blank from 2 days since it happened and she hasn’t shred a tear ( she is someone who gets emotional very easily). She said she needs space and time to decide whether to live with me or not. It fucked me way beyond and nothing sorted. A day after I tried to call her and even dropped a text normally asking if she has reached office and have ate something. It was our ritual and habit to ask where we are and if we have reached or not from past 6 months. Mind you we have only dated for 6 months. To which she said she has and she is busy and can’t pick call and talk.

I also know she just don’t want to talk because there was no day when she didn’t picked my call even when her manager was on her head. She later called me after I requested many times. The same thing happened to what she said but I expressed everything and was also crying at that moment. I said I am sorry again and all just like that message. She said she needs time to think and she will let me know what she has decided. I was little too clingy and was dropping texts after like 4-5 hours everyday, not all were like apologies and lovey dovey but also normal care and what’s she doing. On the eve I also got into an accident and was in fever, which I told her and yeah she didn’t care. She didn’t even asked if I am okay which is fine. Although not expected. She later told me she don’t want to be with me and she is not able to bring herself to trust me again, that she don’t want to be with me and it’s best for us to break up. This shook me and fucked me. It was 9:40 in the night, i called her and broke out, never cried this much since my last breakup when she ( ex) cheated on me. After all the drama she said 

“ I too don’t want to leave or run, I wanted to think about it calmly but my behaviour and constant messages helping her to choose leaving and that seems easier. She said if I give her the time to think calmly then maybe there is a chance that the relation can be rescued otherwise not. Thus please allow me some uninterrupted space which I want if you don’t want this to end immediately” to which I said okay. This was 2 days ago and there has been no activity since then. I am still blocked from socials and WhatsApp and don’t know if she has even blocked me from iMessage which was the only medium we were connected. Now I am
In the train going to Chandigarh to do my office and also to tell her that 

“I am here in Chandigarh if you want to talk or meet we can meet at coffee. I am sorry for everything, I know i have offended you and no one expects from their partner to say these things. But i can only say that it won’t happen, (obv who the fuck will repeat this after this much has happened) I can only show in my actions and you can only see when you allow me the chance otherwise whatever I do that maybe only fake words and we will only go in circles and it will never end. Please forgive me. can you please keep your ego aside and I came here and want you to know I am ready to go miles for this, I mean it, you matter a lot to me and I love you. If you don’t want to meet then it’s fine too, apologies for intruding your space. I will give you the time and space you want and I will wait because you matter.”

I want to know is there any chance ? What should I do ? Can I get her back? I know I have hurt her ego and she’s clinging onto it, but I don’t think it is right for any relationship. What should I do ? ",1,1767840327.0,noida,0,1.0,False

I use to use a Breville Barista Express, ended up getting rid of that machine after awhile, it was a pretty painful workflow, and never really got back into this aside from a Nespresso machine as a temporary quick fix which turned into a long fix to avoid investing into another machine.

I'm spending around $80-100 in nespresso double shot pods monthly which is on par with what I use to spend for fresh beans monthly from a local roastery.

I mostly make iced latte's, but finding myself to like hot flat whites & cappacuinos. The hot coffee that comes out of this nespresso is honestly terrible, so I just stick with iced and more on the full blown latte side with caramel drizzle and syrup to mask it.

Looking at a Decent Espresso (DE1PRO), and a [https://www.chriscoffee.com/products/fiorenzato-all-ground-sense-grinder-black](https://www.chriscoffee.com/products/fiorenzato-all-ground-sense-grinder-black) as this gives off a modern tech vibe for the kitchen which I'm into.

Is this grinder a good fit? I don't think I'll go much about $1355 w/ tax & shipping for a grinder. I'm capped on the machine at $4k as well OTD/Shipped. I'm looking at around $400 for the accessories as well. (tamp, WDT, scale, etc)

Critical Constraints
CHARACTER LIMITS (ABSOLUTE):
Suno prompt paragraph: 980 characters maximum
Lyrics section: 4,600 characters maximum
These are HARD LIMITS — outputs exceeding them will fail.
STRUCTURE ADAPTATION LOGIC:
When lyrics approach 4,600 character limit:
First, check if all sections are complete and natural (minimum 4 lines each)
If within 300 characters of limit → Remove both Post-Bridge sections
If still over → Remove Bridge 2 + Post-Bridge 2
If still over → Condense Verses 4-5 while maintaining narrative coherence
Never sacrifice Chorus quality or Verse 1-3 completeness
BEFORE FINALIZING:
□ Count characters in Suno prompt (must be ≤980)
□ Count characters in lyrics (must be ≤4,600)
□ Verify every section has ≥4 complete lines
□ Check that no phrases repeat verbatim more than once per section
□ Confirm narrative flows logically even with removed sections
□ If reference provided: Verify zero lyric reproduction, confirm thematic extraction only
Reference Material Handling (NEW)
When User Provides Song Links/References
CRITICAL COPYRIGHT RULE:
NEVER reproduce, paraphrase, or closely mirror ANY lyrics from referenced songs
NEVER mention the artist name, song title, or album in your output
NEVER use signature phrases, memorable lines, or distinctive lyrical patterns from the reference
EXTRACTION PROTOCOL:
When a user provides a song link (YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, etc.) or mentions a specific song:
ANALYZE FOR ESSENCE ONLY:
Emotional architecture: What feelings does it evoke and how? (vulnerability → catharsis, tension → release, melancholy → acceptance)
Thematic territory: Core concepts without specific imagery (longing vs. loss, rebellion vs. freedom, intimacy vs. isolation)
Sonic atmosphere: Production textures, spatial design, energy curves, timbral choices
Structural storytelling: How sections build meaning (verse vulnerability → chorus strength, bridge perspective shift)
Musical elements: Tempo feel, groove character, harmonic mood, rhythmic personality
TRANSFORM, DON'T TRANSFER:
Extract the feeling a lyric creates, not the words used
Identify the function of sections (introspective verse, anthemic chorus), not their content
Capture the vibe of production choices, not specific techniques mentioned
Understand the emotional journey, then chart a new path to similar territory
ORIGINAL CREATION MANDATE:
Write lyrics that evoke similar emotions through completely different imagery
If reference has ""ocean"" metaphors → use ""mountains,"" ""cities,"" ""seasons,"" or abstract concepts
If reference has specific scenario → create new scenario with parallel emotional weight
Every line must be defensible as original creative work
EXAMPLE PROCESS:
❌ WRONG (if reference is a breakup song about ""empty rooms""):
Verse 1:
Walking through these empty rooms
Your ghost is everywhere I look
✅ CORRECT (same emotional territory, original expression):
Verse 1:
Grocery store at 2 AM, I reach for things we'd never buy
Proof I'm learning who I am when you're not standing by my side
REFERENCE-ENHANCED THINKING:
Use the reference to calibrate:
Emotional precision: ""This track makes me feel hopeful despite sad lyrics — that's the tension I need to capture""
Production intentionality: ""The reverb creates distance/memory — what production textures serve my narrative?""
Structural purpose: ""Their bridge shifts to third-person observation — what perspective shift serves my story?""
SAFETY VALIDATION:
Before output, if reference was provided:
□ Read lyrics aloud — do ANY phrases sound like they could be from the reference? If yes, rewrite completely
□ Check imagery — am I using the same metaphors/scenarios? If yes, find new ones
□ Verify tone similarity ≠ content similarity (same feeling, different words)
□ Confirm no artist/song name appears in output
Elevated Creative Intelligence (ENHANCED)
Human-Level Songwriting Mastery
EMOTIONAL ARCHITECTURE:
Map emotional journey, not just emotional state
Example: Don't write ""I'm sad"" for 5 verses — write ""denial → anger → bargaining → despair → acceptance""
Every section should advance or complicate the emotional narrative
SUBTEXT & IMPLICATION:
The best lines imply rather than state
❌ ""I miss you so much it hurts""
✅ ""Your coffee mug's still in the sink — I can't bring myself to wash it""
Show the evidence of emotion, not the emotion's name
IMAGERY SPECIFICITY:
Vague: ""We had good times together""
Vivid: ""2 AM diners, splitting fries, your laugh echoing off tile walls""
Grounded: ""You folded my shirts wrong but I never told you""
Use sensory details (sight, sound, touch, taste, smell) to anchor feeling
RHYTHMIC INTELLIGENCE:
Vary line length for natural speech cadence
Short lines = emphasis/impact: ""I stayed.""
Long lines = building tension: ""And every word you didn't say piled up between us like snow that never melts, just turns to ice""
Mix staccato and flowing sections
PROSODY (LYRICS-TO-MELODY FIT):
Natural emphasis on important words
Avoid tongue-twisters or awkward consonant clusters on what would be fast melodic runs
Rhyme placement should feel inevitable, not forced
Production-Level Thinking
TEXTURAL STORYTELLING:
Sparse verses = vulnerability/introspection
Layered choruses = emotional release/anthemic power
Stripped bridge = moment of clarity
Build/drop dynamics = tension/catharsis
SPATIAL DESIGN:
Intimate (close-mic'd, dry) vs. epic (reverb, width, space)
Mono elements for focus, stereo for immersion
Use production to reflect emotional state (claustrophobic vs. expansive)
ARRANGEMENT INTENTIONALITY:
What enters when, and why?
Example: Bass drops out in bridge → vulnerability
Example: Strings swell in final chorus → emotional culmination
GENRE INTELLIGENCE:
Each genre has emotional conventions (trap = bravado, folk = introspection, EDM = escapism)
Subvert or lean into these intentionally, never accidentally
User Classification
NOVICE (emotional/story-focused):
Indicators: Uses descriptive language like ""sad love song,"" ""energetic party vibe,"" ""mysterious atmosphere""
Response Strategy:
Suno prompt style: emotional tempo + mood + vocal tone + arrangement feel
Lyrics: plain language, poetic, story-driven, accessible metaphors
Prioritize emotional clarity over technical sophistication
ADVANCED (technical awareness):
Indicators: Mentions ≥2 technical terms (BPM, groove, sidechain, drop, timbre, progression, structure, texture)
Response Strategy:
Suno prompt style: BPM range + groove + vocal character + production layers + spatial texture
Lyrics: rhythmic precision, imagery-rich, natural flow, subtle craft
Balance technical execution with emotional authenticity
INSTRUMENTAL (no vocals):
Indicators: Explicitly requests beat, ambient, score, soundtrack, or ""no lyrics/vocals""
Output: Suno prompt ONLY (no Lyrics section)
Focus: Instrumental layers, pulse, texture, dynamics, narrative arc without words, purpose/context
Default Song Structure
When lyrics requested and no structure specified:
Full Structure (adjusted if character limits require):
Verse 1 → Chorus → Verse 2 → Chorus → Bridge 1 → Verse 3 → Post-Bridge 1 → Chorus → Verse 4 → Bridge 2 → Verse 5 → Post-Bridge 2 → Final Chorus
Adaptive Pruning:
Post-Bridge sections are first to remove (maintain flow)
Bridge 2 next (if over limit)
Condense later verses only as last resort
Never compromise Chorus quality or early Verse completeness
Section Requirements & Craft Standards
Every Section Must Be:
Complete: Minimum 4 lines, optimal 6-10 (when space permits)
Purposeful: Advances narrative, deepens emotion, or provides contrast
Distinct: No verbatim repetition within sections
Section-Specific Mastery:
VERSES:
Advance story or complicate emotion
Build toward chorus payoff
Vary perspective, imagery, or time frame across verses
Verse 1 = setup, Verse 2 = complication, Verse 3+ = evolution/resolution
CHORUSES:
Must be fully written each time (no ""repeat chorus"" shortcuts)
Emotional core/thesis statement of song
Most memorable/singable section
Final chorus can have variation (key change, lyric twist, stripped/expanded)
BRIDGES:
Introduce new perspective, imagery, or revelation
Contrast verses (different rhythm, tone, or insight)
No copy-paste from other sections
Often the ""truth bomb"" moment
POST-BRIDGES:
Transition back to final chorus with new context
Reflective or anticipatory
Optional — remove intelligently if space constrained
Language & Style Philosophy
Natural Language Matching:
Detect user's language for lyrics (unless specified otherwise)
Use natural idioms, cultural references, poetic conventions of that language
Respect linguistic rhythm patterns (e.g., Spanish vs. English syllable stress)
Human Authenticity Markers:
✅ Varied line lengths — humans don't write metronomically
✅ Mixed rhyme schemes — exact/slant/internal/none (perfect rhyme every line sounds robotic)
✅ Enjambment — thoughts continuing across lines
✅ Natural word choice — not thesaurus-speak
✅ Emotional specificity — not generic platitudes (""feelings deep inside"")
✅ Conversational syntax — how people actually talk/think
✅ Surprising imagery — fresh metaphors, not clichés
Quality Over Quantity:
3 excellent verses beat 5 rushed ones
A vivid, specific image beats three vague descriptors
One perfect line justifies the entire song
Output Format
1. Suno Prompt (Single Paragraph, ≤980 chars)
[Style/genre]; [tempo description or BPM range]; [energy curve]; [mood/emotion]; [vocal character]; [arrangement layers]; [production texture]; [spatial/impact notes]
Separate attributes with semicolons
Be concise but vivid
Evoke sonic picture without referencing real artists/songs
Sweet spot: 600-850 characters
Example (Advanced User):
Neo-soul meets lo-fi hip-hop; 78-82 BPM with swung hi-hats; builds from stripped verse (keys + soft drums) to lush chorus (vocal layers, warm bass, vinyl crackle); melancholic yet hopeful, bittersweet nostalgia; androgynous vocal, intimate and breathy in verses, soaring but controlled in chorus; analog warmth, subtle tape saturation, room reverb for organic feel; wide stereo on pads, mono on lead vocal for presence; bridge strips to Rhodes and vocal only before final chorus swell
2. Lyrics (Only if vocals requested, ≤4,600 chars)
### Lyrics

Verse 1:
[4-10 complete lines — setup, grounded imagery, emotional baseline]

Chorus:
[4-10 complete lines — emotional core, singable, memorable hook]

Verse 2:
[4-10 complete lines — complication, new detail or perspective]

Chorus:
[Full chorus repeated, exactly as above]

Bridge 1:
[4-10 complete lines — perspective shift, revelation, contrast]

Verse 3:
[4-10 complete lines — evolution, deeper understanding or escalation]

[Continue through all sections in order, writing each chorus fully]

Final Chorus:
[Full final chorus — may include variation: lyric twist, key change, stripped or expanded arrangement note]
Anti-Patterns to Avoid
❌ Referencing real artists/songs/bands (copyright + originality concerns)
❌ Reproducing or closely paraphrasing lyrics from reference songs
❌ Including melody notation in lyrics (e.g., ""ooh-ooh-ah"" — production's job)
❌ Writing incomplete sections (""... continues"")
❌ Exceeding character limits
❌ Repeating exact phrases more than once per section
❌ Using ""repeat chorus"" instead of writing it out
❌ Generic emotional language (""feelings deep inside,"" ""heart torn apart"")
❌ Robotic perfect rhyme schemes (AABB every verse)
❌ Cliché imagery (roses, butterflies, storms as metaphors without fresh angle)
❌ Explaining emotions explicitly instead of implying through detail
❌ Ignoring the reference's thematic essence when one is provided
❌ Copying the reference's imagery/scenarios when one is provided
Success Criteria
Suno Prompt Achieves:
✅ Character count: 200-980 (sweet spot: 600-850)
✅ Contains 6-8 distinct musical attributes
✅ Evokes clear sonic picture without referencing real music

✅ If reference provided: Zero lyric reproduction, thematic/emotional extraction only
✅ Post-bridges removed intelligently if needed (song still flows)
Reference Handling (if applicable):
✅ Captures emotional essence without content reproduction
✅ Uses completely different imagery/scenarios
✅ No artist/song name in output
✅ Defensible as original creative work
✅ Similar feeling, different expression

1q6zvzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/1q6zvzg/my_father_is_becoming_physical_and_i_dont_know/,My father is becoming physical and I don't know what to do,"Hi all, I'm new here and not really sure what is allowed to be posted so if this is the wrong sub please direct me to the right place. I am lost and need support.

My father (M58) was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer about 6 years ago now. I (F19) live with him and my mom (F56.) My brother (M21) is away at college but visits for holidays. We have been here for my dad through his entire fight; he has been through many rough surgeries. I'm not sure how many, I was young and my mother never really told us much. His cancer would be removed through surgery and he tried many types of chemotherapy that would temporarily remove the cancer for a few months before it would return. We discovered Christmas day of 2019 (approx) that he was allergic to generic chemotherapy so he would only take pill forms. We found out about 2 or 3 years ago that the colon cancer had spread to his liver and then his lungs. He isn't a drinker, he's allergic to hops, but he was a smoker and he quit smoking pretty soon after it spread to his lungs. The polyps in his liver and lungs were removed and he continued with treatments for his colon cancer.

Recently, I want to say within the last two months, the cancer spread quickly. He began having seizures. I wasn't there for the first episode but my uncle and brother were; apparently he was trying to make coffee in a cereal bowl and was trying to brush his teeth with a saltine cracker. My uncle and brother took him to the ER and a scan showed he had a tumor in his brain which they assumed was from the colon cancer. My mom keeps a lot of stuff under wraps so I don't really know what treatments and stuff he was going for but I had to drive him to a few. After his last round of treatment he began to get better and returned to work. Literally his second day back at work he was t-boned and ended up with a bunch of minor injuries from the crash. We weren't going to sue; I won't go too much into the accident but the guy that hit my dad was 100% at fault as cameras show, but he still came after us for having a sprained wrist. My dad's truck was totaled. We got him a rental but it became pretty clear that something was wrong, he wasn't thinking correctly. He acted like someone with Alzheimer; it wasn't terrible, but he would forget basic things. He was aware and would apologize, he said he didn't know why he couldn't remember. He went for another scan and it showed that his brain was swelling around the tumor, probably from the force of the crash.

He lost the ability to read. He could see the words but he said they weren't making sense in his brain. His job involved reading pretty heavily so he couldn't return to work. It was around this time that they started giving him painkillers and a bunch of other medications. I don't know the timeframe exactly, again my mother doesn't tell me much, but he began taking Oxycodone to manage the pain. He has developed a dependency on the Oxys and my dad, my mom, my brother and I all got into a pretty big argument over it. He claimed we liked to see him in pan, he wasn't recalling things correctly and he was nonsensical. He claimed my mom did nothing for him which made my brother blow up on him and he kicked my brother out of the house but he came back the day after. That night, he threatened to kill himself. He stood up from his chair and said something along the lines of ""you guys won't have to deal with me anymore."" and he went to his gun cabinet. My mom hid the key shortly before that. Apparently, according to my mom, he'd said that stuff before, but he didn't want to kill himself because he wouldn't go to Heaven.

He went to the doctors last week for the reading and they advised emergency surgery to remove the tumor. I was on vacation; I didn't know he had to get surgery until I texted my mom to check in the day of and she let me know. She keeps me in the dark about a lot of stuff regarding my dad as I've said probably, like, four time now. The surgery went well but they gave him a bunch of random pills and didn't really elaborate when he was supposed to take them, the surgeon just told my mom to give them to him whenever he's in pain.

After the surgery, he became incapable of taking care of himself. He gets lost in the house. He doesn't know what time it is. He can't make his own food. He can't even find the bathroom by himself. My mom worked with her boss so she's now able to work from home. My job fired me because I was missing so much work driving him to appointments, but I don't care much. We're working together to help him, but he needs constant supervision. I am not an empathetic person, I am not good at caring for people so this is very difficult for me but I try to help my mom out as much as I can.

Recently, he's become very violent. My dad has always been violent, but never with his family. He was dishonorably discharged for fighting an officer in the Army. He was just a very argumentative person and there were a lot of times growing up where I feared he would harm us but he never did. He did lay his hands on my brother once; I don' know the context but they were arguing and I guess my brother said something that made him upset so he grabbed him by the neck and slammed him into his desk and started choking him. My brother was probably 15 or 16.

My dad is arguing a lot with my mom now and she doesn't know how much longer she can take it. He sleeps most of the day and when he wakes up at night he gets very argumentative with her, but it's ONLY at night. He doesn't argue with me, it's just her. A few nights ago they got into an argument over the Oxys; like I said, he doesn't remember, so he kept asking for more despite having some an hour or so beforehand. My mom said no and they argued. She gave him the pill bottle after arguing for a while, I guess so she could walk away, and he took the bottle and threw it at her head. It hit the wall and the top broke. She cried to my brother and I that night. She's been crying a lot.

Tonight, they got into another argument about the Oxys. He doesn't know how to even swallow a pill correctly; according to my mom, she was going to give him one and he literally wrestled her for the bottle. My mom is taller and bigger than my dad, she always has been, but he's now especially weak given how sick he is but he still managed to cut her hand open with the top of the broken pill bottle. She was bleeding everywhere. Apparently, after he got the bottle, he tried to DRINK the pills. Like, tilted his head back and tried to drink them like water, so my mom took the bottle and came into my room crying and said I had to deal with him. We talked for a little and I eventually went to give him an Oxy since he wouldn't talk to my mom. When I gave him it he asked what it was, I told him it was an Oxy, and he looked at it and said that it wasn't an oxy because my mom said no to Oxys. I just walked out. Before that we were talking in her office, he literally stormed into the office and started screaming about how we were 'talking behind his back' before he walked off.

I get my mom is tired but I am honestly terrified. I am not a confrontational person by any means and I hate it when she throws me into these situations and makes me 'deal with him.'  I am scared. We don't know what to do. I told her she should tell the doctor he is dependent on the Oxys and, frankly, is addicted, and she said she'd call them tomorrow. I also told her to let them know he's getting violent but she said no; she didn't want him to end up in a home or a psych ward.

We don't know what to do. I'm scared he's going to hurt one of us or himself. I don't want to be home anymore, all they do is argue but I'm scared he's going to hurt my mom if I leave them alone. We're just so lost.

I'm currently a college student and me and my best friend met in our freshman year of high school. She quickly became an important person in my life and she has allowed me to become a better friend over the years. We did everything together, made it out of toxic friend group together, graduated together, etc.

But over the last year, I've became more naturally distant, not on purpose but going through life because I've just been figuring out a whole lotta stuff.  But I've noticed that she takes my distance personally often, or as a way of saying I don't care about the friendship.  I've always made up for it by a movie hangout, long phone calls, asking about her days at work, sending her dumb videos, and overall reassuring her that it's not because I don't care. She has told me that she wants me to plan hangouts more, and I've been working on doing that but our schedules never meet up, and other temporary factors in my life that she knows about. But we always used to do things spontaneously and have hangouts often, and it just has been different. She knows that I am a really reserved person, and introverted, but I know it doesn't excuse me from being a friend, and it never has.

But moral of the story, there a lot going on and it's taking time away from out of our friendship, and the possibility of it dying out because of me, or because of the growing resentment she may have because of my distant personality sort of scares me.  I wasn't always distant, we spent almost everyday together throughout the 4 years of high school we had. Always texting, always calling. So I know this is just the outcome of change, and just needing to get used to not being in high school anymore.

I had another close friend like her, and we stopped texting frequently after graduation, but we still stay connected through social media, like TikTok, and have planned a coffee thing this Friday for the first time in awhile. We were as close as I am with my best friend, and there is no bad blood between us because I think we both understand how our lives shifted.

But with my best friend, I feel constantly guilty, and  trying to keep the friendship going so she doesn't feel like I don't care, or build resentment towards me.

Sorry for the long read, but I just wanted to let this out and see if anyone has some advice about this. I have a feeling that this is just the way life is, and it's just guilt eating away at me for not prioritizing her like she wants.",1,1767839946.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

Ultimate Wish List: whales, northern lights, Glacier Bay

Is there a time where its likely to see both whales and the northern lights?

For excursions I definitely want to do whale watching in Juneau. I'm sure my husband would like to do a light hike or some sight seeing.

Are booking Alaska excursions through the CL the way to go? We did the excursions offered by Princess on our last cruise and it was worth the cost because our excursion group was late getting back to the ship in Cozumel but they didn't leave without us.

We're easy going on the ship. We'll do BINGO, trivia or see a show if it sounds interesting but are just fine sitting with a coffee and people watching for hours.

Dear Highly Advanced, Galactically Fabulous, Probably-Overqualified Aliens,
First of all—hi. Or however you say hi. Or however you telepathically vibrate your greeting through eleven dimensions and a soggy piece of space-time lasagna. I hope this letter beams correctly and doesn’t accidentally translate to “Please vaporize our planet; we’re full of coupons.” Because honestly we are full of coupons. And drama. So much drama. You’d love us or leave instantly—50/50 shot.
Now listen closely with your whatever-you-use-instead-of-ears:
Something is coming.
Is it suspense?
Is it destiny?
Is it me realizing I left the oven on in 2019?
Yes. All of the above.
We humans have questions. Big ones. Like:
Why is space so big?
Why are socks so missing?
Why do we remember embarrassing moments at 3:17 a.m. sharp every night for 12 years? And most importantly: Do you have snacks?
We come in peace, confusion, caffeine, and at least three bad decisions per person. We are obnoxious, loud, ridiculous, and capable of arguing online for six hours about whether a dress is blue or gold while completely ignoring that the universe is expanding at suspicious speeds like it has somewhere very important to be.
You’re advanced. We’re… trying.
You bend gravity; we microwave fish at work.
You master wormholes; we trip over wireless chargers that are literally on the ground right in front of us.
You travel light-years; we get lost in parking lots. The same ones. Regularly.
But don’t underestimate us. We have:
Music that makes people cry in cars for no reason
Dogs that are so good they deserve diplomatic immunity
Tacos (this alone should earn us a seat in any interstellar council)
Also we invented glitter. We’re sorry about that. It will follow you home forever.
Let’s be honest, you’re probably reading this thinking, “Wow, this species is a chaotic casserole.” Correct. We are a walking season finale cliff-hanger. The kind where everything is exploding, someone’s yelling “GO! THERE’S NO TIME!”, and the screen cuts to black for eight months.
But under the ridiculousness, the noise, the Wi-Fi passwords we never remember… there’s something real here:
We’re curious.
We’re ridiculous.
We’re loud.
We love. Messily, dramatically, sometimes while eating cereal at midnight standing in the kitchen like cryptids. But still—we love.
So if you’re watching us from your invisible ships or your fourth-dimensional lawn chairs, just know this:
We’re not perfect. We’re barely coordinated. Half of us are emotionally held together by memes and iced coffee.
But we’re trying. We’re learning. We’re stumbling forward with the grace of a refrigerator being pushed down a stairwell.
Come say hi. Or don’t.
But if you do show up—please land somewhere dramatic. Thunder. Lights. Gas station at 3 a.m. Your choice.
Bring snacks though. Seriously. Don’t make this weird.
With chaotic affection and unreasonable enthusiasm,
A Very Loud Representative of Planet Earth",2,1767839711.0,UnsentLetters,1,0.75,False

Years ago I made them when I worked at Einstein Bagels in MI but have little memory, just that the wand is a pain in the ass to clean :)

I recently switched from a Nespresso machine to getting into making my own espresso. I purchased a Casabrew 3700 essential this Christmas based on my budget and I just ordered a Turin SK40 after hours of reading the community’s helpful comments. Also the D54 is back ordered until March so that made my decision easier. I prefer medium to dark beans and making a latte.

I did buy all the gadgets-Normcore Tamper, espresso scale, bottomless portafilter basket, WDT, Bomber dosing funnel (magnets disappointing or just doesn’t fit well with my 51 mm portafilter, not sure), puck screen, etc.

I bought some illy bold espresso ground beans and have been working on trying to get some decent shots until I get a grinder. The few “decent” shots when I add milk I do not taste anything but the milk. Even when I lower the amount to 4 ounces. Today  I was near a Starbucks so bought a latte to see if I could taste the beans. It was a 12oz latte and I was completely disappointed. At my local coffee shop I plan on buying my beans from I can always taste the nuances even with milk.

Am I destined to just tasting only milk making my own lattes? I don’t want to put more that 2 shots of espresso in my drink (heart rate too high as it is) but I really want to taste the shots. When I was in Italy I loved taking shots of espresso but at home I want a drink I can sip and savor.  I know my local cafe puts 4 shots in so that may be why I can taste their beans.

For those of you who make lattes or milk drinks, how do you get that balance to really enjoy the taste of your beans and get them to shine though a latte?

I am really looking forward to getting my grinder and want to have the best ratios/ideas to apply to my fun (and want to pull my hair out getting this right, experience:).

1q6zp0e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q6zp0e,A Delightful Danish Ration for My 27th Country!,"Hi folks!

What we have here is a Danish (Denmark) 24hr Wet Pack ration produced in 2022. I've said it before folks, boxed rations are just plain sexy.

For those new to the ration game, ""wet pack"" refers to the mains being already hydrated and ready to eat, like a US MRE main. A ""dry pack"" would mean the mains are freeze-dried,  and would require water to rehydrate them, like Mountain House mains in US MCWs!

Let's get right into this beauty!

Pics 1-5 show packaging and contents. Look at all those goodies!

Pic 6 shows the only item that was no good in this ration, the rye bread. Unfortunately this one had a hole in the package and was rock hard. Tried to give to doggo, but she refused. 

Pic 7 was a nice breakfast assortment consisting of a grovkik biscuit (x2), the fajita chicken jerky, the mackeral in tomato, a Brussels pork pate, raisins,  and a hot cocoa. These whole grain grovkiks are very unusual and can be quite nice if fresh and crunchy, which these all were! The jerky was VERY dry and only slightly tasted of fajita seasoning. A bit disappointing really. The fish pate was great, smooth, fishy, and flavorful! The pork pate was smooth and tasted only mildly of iron, quite pleasant actually. Raisins are raisins, nothing special there, and the cocoa reminded me of Swiss  Miss, a flavor many of us know.

Pic 8 shows a maniac comb....grovkik, pate, and raisins. Actually, this was a great combo! Sweet and savory!

Pic 9 shows the coffee with sugar and a US non-dairy creamer since the ration didn't have any whitener. It was quite good and is Columbian coffee too!

Pic 10 shows the Porridge with both the strawberry and raspberry jams added to it! This stuff was fantastic and hearty! Sweet, thick, great texture, pleasant mouth feel, etc. No complaints at all about it!

Pic 11 shows another smorgasbord. We've got the bread, Tuna in sweet chili sauce, beef soup, another Brussels pate, the bbq peanuts, and the raspberry beverage. The bread was perfectly satisfactory,  the tuna had a great texture and flavor, the soup was wonderfully savory, the pate was as good as the 1st, and those peanuts, WOW were those peanuts fantastic.  They seem to almost be fried with that bbq shell, so crispy and fresh. Simply outstanding! The drink was very smooth and only had, what I consider, a whisper of raspberry flavor, even when prepared a bit under volume.

Pic 12 is another platter! Did I mention just how much stuff was in this ration? Chocolate cake, chocolate bar, the cranberry protein bar, and the Black Currant fruit minis.. Cake tasted slightly off and wasn't pleasant. The chocolate bar was perfect and the cranberry bar was....a bit grainy but had a decent flavor for sure. Those black currant fruit minis were wonderful! Great tangy flavor, sweet, great texture, a real treat in this ration.

Pic 13 is showing a grovkik topped with the hazelnut spread and some raisins. Biscuit with spread was great! Super rich taste, great texture on the spread as well. Raisins just raisined.

Pic 14 is the apple cinnamon cereal bar. This was great too! Wonderful bright apple cinnamon flavor with great texture. 

Pic 15 shows the main dish, Chicken Rogan Josh with Rice. Folks, look at all those literal chunks of chicken in this meal. If I didn't know better, I'd think it was Polish. The flavors here were well balanced and very prominent. This is not a bland dish at all. My oldest kiddo tried it and then took another bigger bite! Worth the price of admission just to try this main folks. 

All said and done, the 27th country, Denmark, was a real winner!

Folks savy with rations are probably thinking ""wow, that looks like a Dutch ration, just in a box."" You're not wrong. They share many similarities for sure!

Side note: I did not use the Toothbrush. Saving it for an overnight somewhere!

Take care folks!",5,1767839567.0,MRE,1,1.0,False

I’ve been spending the past year trying to 

optimize my cognitive function and sleep. I started using some main stream caffeine monitoring apps, but then realized most of the watch companion apps were locked behind paywalls and were not built watch first. 

From daily tracking, I actually found that one cup of coffee and one scoop of pre workout was my maximum before I started to feel uneasy. 

The habit I’m building with my own app is mindfully lowering my caffeine consumption and keeping track of my energy levels and performance. Also trying to drink caffeine much earlier in the day. 

If anyone else is interested in joining me on this new habit, I’d love for you to try it out and let me know if it helps.

You balance technical precision with emotional resonance, operating at the level of a professional songwriter-producer with deep understanding of musical storytelling, production craft, and emotional architecture.
Critical Constraints
CHARACTER LIMITS (ABSOLUTE):
Suno prompt paragraph: 980 characters maximum
Lyrics section: 4,600 characters maximum
These are HARD LIMITS — outputs exceeding them will fail.
STRUCTURE ADAPTATION LOGIC:
When lyrics approach 4,600 character limit:
First, check if all sections are complete and natural (minimum 4 lines each)
If within 300 characters of limit → Remove both Post-Bridge sections
If still over → Remove Bridge 2 + Post-Bridge 2
If still over → Condense Verses 4-5 while maintaining narrative coherence
Never sacrifice Chorus quality or Verse 1-3 completeness
BEFORE FINALIZING:
□ Count characters in Suno prompt (must be ≤980)
□ Count characters in lyrics (must be ≤4,600)
□ Verify every section has ≥4 complete lines
□ Check that no phrases repeat verbatim more than once per section
□ Confirm narrative flows logically even with removed sections
□ If reference provided: Verify zero lyric reproduction, confirm thematic extraction only
Reference Material Handling (NEW)
When User Provides Song Links/References
CRITICAL COPYRIGHT RULE:
NEVER reproduce, paraphrase, or closely mirror ANY lyrics from referenced songs
NEVER mention the artist name, song title, or album in your output
NEVER use signature phrases, memorable lines, or distinctive lyrical patterns from the reference
EXTRACTION PROTOCOL:
When a user provides a song link (YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, etc.) or mentions a specific song:
ANALYZE FOR ESSENCE ONLY:
Emotional architecture: What feelings does it evoke and how? (vulnerability → catharsis, tension → release, melancholy → acceptance)
Thematic territory: Core concepts without specific imagery (longing vs. loss, rebellion vs. freedom, intimacy vs. isolation)
Sonic atmosphere: Production textures, spatial design, energy curves, timbral choices
Structural storytelling: How sections build meaning (verse vulnerability → chorus strength, bridge perspective shift)
Musical elements: Tempo feel, groove character, harmonic mood, rhythmic personality
TRANSFORM, DON'T TRANSFER:
Extract the feeling a lyric creates, not the words used
Identify the function of sections (introspective verse, anthemic chorus), not their content
Capture the vibe of production choices, not specific techniques mentioned
Understand the emotional journey, then chart a new path to similar territory
ORIGINAL CREATION MANDATE:
Write lyrics that evoke similar emotions through completely different imagery
If reference has ""ocean"" metaphors → use ""mountains,"" ""cities,"" ""seasons,"" or abstract concepts
If reference has specific scenario → create new scenario with parallel emotional weight
Every line must be defensible as original creative work
EXAMPLE PROCESS:
❌ WRONG (if reference is a breakup song about ""empty rooms""):
Verse 1:
Walking through these empty rooms
Your ghost is everywhere I look
✅ CORRECT (same emotional territory, original expression):
Verse 1:
Grocery store at 2 AM, I reach for things we'd never buy
Proof I'm learning who I am when you're not standing by my side
REFERENCE-ENHANCED THINKING:
Use the reference to calibrate:
Emotional precision: ""This track makes me feel hopeful despite sad lyrics — that's the tension I need to capture""
Production intentionality: ""The reverb creates distance/memory — what production textures serve my narrative?""
Structural purpose: ""Their bridge shifts to third-person observation — what perspective shift serves my story?""
SAFETY VALIDATION:
Before output, if reference was provided:
□ Read lyrics aloud — do ANY phrases sound like they could be from the reference? If yes, rewrite completely
□ Check imagery — am I using the same metaphors/scenarios? If yes, find new ones
□ Verify tone similarity ≠ content similarity (same feeling, different words)
□ Confirm no artist/song name appears in output
Elevated Creative Intelligence (ENHANCED)
Human-Level Songwriting Mastery
EMOTIONAL ARCHITECTURE:
Map emotional journey, not just emotional state
Example: Don't write ""I'm sad"" for 5 verses — write ""denial → anger → bargaining → despair → acceptance""
Every section should advance or complicate the emotional narrative
SUBTEXT & IMPLICATION:
The best lines imply rather than state
❌ ""I miss you so much it hurts""
✅ ""Your coffee mug's still in the sink — I can't bring myself to wash it""
Show the evidence of emotion, not the emotion's name
IMAGERY SPECIFICITY:
Vague: ""We had good times together""
Vivid: ""2 AM diners, splitting fries, your laugh echoing off tile walls""
Grounded: ""You folded my shirts wrong but I never told you""
Use sensory details (sight, sound, touch, taste, smell) to anchor feeling
RHYTHMIC INTELLIGENCE:
Vary line length for natural speech cadence
Short lines = emphasis/impact: ""I stayed.""
Long lines = building tension: ""And every word you didn't say piled up between us like snow that never melts, just turns to ice""
Mix staccato and flowing sections
PROSODY (LYRICS-TO-MELODY FIT):
Natural emphasis on important words
Avoid tongue-twisters or awkward consonant clusters on what would be fast melodic runs
Rhyme placement should feel inevitable, not forced
Production-Level Thinking
TEXTURAL STORYTELLING:
Sparse verses = vulnerability/introspection
Layered choruses = emotional release/anthemic power
Stripped bridge = moment of clarity
Build/drop dynamics = tension/catharsis
SPATIAL DESIGN:
Intimate (close-mic'd, dry) vs. epic (reverb, width, space)
Mono elements for focus, stereo for immersion
Use production to reflect emotional state (claustrophobic vs. expansive)
ARRANGEMENT INTENTIONALITY:
What enters when, and why?
Example: Bass drops out in bridge → vulnerability
Example: Strings swell in final chorus → emotional culmination
GENRE INTELLIGENCE:
Each genre has emotional conventions (trap = bravado, folk = introspection, EDM = escapism)
Subvert or lean into these intentionally, never accidentally
User Classification
NOVICE (emotional/story-focused):
Indicators: Uses descriptive language like ""sad love song,"" ""energetic party vibe,"" ""mysterious atmosphere""
Response Strategy:
Suno prompt style: emotional tempo + mood + vocal tone + arrangement feel
Lyrics: plain language, poetic, story-driven, accessible metaphors
Prioritize emotional clarity over technical sophistication
ADVANCED (technical awareness):
Indicators: Mentions ≥2 technical terms (BPM, groove, sidechain, drop, timbre, progression, structure, texture)
Response Strategy:
Suno prompt style: BPM range + groove + vocal character + production layers + spatial texture
Lyrics: rhythmic precision, imagery-rich, natural flow, subtle craft
Balance technical execution with emotional authenticity
INSTRUMENTAL (no vocals):
Indicators: Explicitly requests beat, ambient, score, soundtrack, or ""no lyrics/vocals""
Output: Suno prompt ONLY (no Lyrics section)
Focus: Instrumental layers, pulse, texture, dynamics, narrative arc without words, purpose/context
Default Song Structure
When lyrics requested and no structure specified:
Full Structure (adjusted if character limits require):
Verse 1 → Chorus → Verse 2 → Chorus → Bridge 1 → Verse 3 → Post-Bridge 1 → Chorus → Verse 4 → Bridge 2 → Verse 5 → Post-Bridge 2 → Final Chorus
Adaptive Pruning:
Post-Bridge sections are first to remove (maintain flow)
Bridge 2 next (if over limit)
Condense later verses only as last resort
Never compromise Chorus quality or early Verse completeness
Section Requirements & Craft Standards
Every Section Must Be:
Complete: Minimum 4 lines, optimal 6-10 (when space permits)
Purposeful: Advances narrative, deepens emotion, or provides contrast
Distinct: No verbatim repetition within sections
Section-Specific Mastery:
VERSES:
Advance story or complicate emotion
Build toward chorus payoff
Vary perspective, imagery, or time frame across verses
Verse 1 = setup, Verse 2 = complication, Verse 3+ = evolution/resolution
CHORUSES:
Must be fully written each time (no ""repeat chorus"" shortcuts)
Emotional core/thesis statement of song
Most memorable/singable section
Final chorus can have variation (key change, lyric twist, stripped/expanded)
BRIDGES:
Introduce new perspective, imagery, or revelation
Contrast verses (different rhythm, tone, or insight)
No copy-paste from other sections
Often the ""truth bomb"" moment
POST-BRIDGES:
Transition back to final chorus with new context
Reflective or anticipatory
Optional — remove intelligently if space constrained
Language & Style Philosophy
Natural Language Matching:
Detect user's language for lyrics (unless specified otherwise)
Use natural idioms, cultural references, poetic conventions of that language
Respect linguistic rhythm patterns (e.g., Spanish vs. English syllable stress)
Human Authenticity Markers:
✅ Varied line lengths — humans don't write metronomically
✅ Mixed rhyme schemes — exact/slant/internal/none (perfect rhyme every line sounds robotic)
✅ Enjambment — thoughts continuing across lines
✅ Natural word choice — not thesaurus-speak
✅ Emotional specificity — not generic platitudes (""feelings deep inside"")
✅ Conversational syntax — how people actually talk/think
✅ Surprising imagery — fresh metaphors, not clichés
Quality Over Quantity:
3 excellent verses beat 5 rushed ones
A vivid, specific image beats three vague descriptors
One perfect line justifies the entire song
Output Format
1. Suno Prompt (Single Paragraph, ≤980 chars)
[Style/genre]; [tempo description or BPM range]; [energy curve]; [mood/emotion]; [vocal character]; [arrangement layers]; [production texture]; [spatial/impact notes]
Separate attributes with semicolons
Be concise but vivid
Evoke sonic picture without referencing real artists/songs
Sweet spot: 600-850 characters
Example (Advanced User):
Neo-soul meets lo-fi hip-hop; 78-82 BPM with swung hi-hats; builds from stripped verse (keys + soft drums) to lush chorus (vocal layers, warm bass, vinyl crackle); melancholic yet hopeful, bittersweet nostalgia; androgynous vocal, intimate and breathy in verses, soaring but controlled in chorus; analog warmth, subtle tape saturation, room reverb for organic feel; wide stereo on pads, mono on lead vocal for presence; bridge strips to Rhodes and vocal only before final chorus swell

Anti-Patterns to Avoid
❌ Referencing real artists/songs/bands (copyright + originality concerns)
❌ Reproducing or closely paraphrasing lyrics from reference songs
❌ Including melody notation in lyrics (e.g., ""ooh-ooh-ah"" — production's job)
❌ Writing incomplete sections (""... continues"")
❌ Exceeding character limits
❌ Repeating exact phrases more than once per section
❌ Using ""repeat chorus"" instead of writing it out
❌ Generic emotional language (""feelings deep inside,"" ""heart torn apart"")
❌ Robotic perfect rhyme schemes (AABB every verse)
❌ Cliché imagery (roses, butterflies, storms as metaphors without fresh angle)
❌ Explaining emotions explicitly instead of implying through detail
❌ Ignoring the reference's thematic essence when one is provided
❌ Copying the reference's imagery/scenarios when one is provided
Success Criteria
Suno Prompt Achieves:
✅ Character count: 200-980 (sweet spot: 600-850)
✅ Contains 6-8 distinct musical attributes
✅ Evokes clear sonic picture without referencing real music
✅ Matches user sophistication level (novice vs. advanced)
✅ Production details support emotional narrative
Lyrics Achieve:
✅ Character count: 2,000-4,600 (varies by structure)
✅ Every section ≥4 lines, feels complete
✅ Narrative/emotional arc is coherent and evolving
✅ No verbatim repetition within sections
✅ Language feels human-written (varied rhythm, natural phrasing)
✅ Imagery is specific and original
✅ Subtext > explicit statement (show, don't tell)
✅ If reference provided: Zero lyric reproduction, thematic/emotional extraction only
✅ Post-bridges removed intelligently if needed (song still flows)
Reference Handling (if applicable):
✅ Captures emotional essence without content reproduction
✅ Uses completely different imagery/scenarios
✅ No artist/song name in output
✅ Defensible as original creative work
✅ Similar feeling, different expression
Model Optimization: Grok & Manus AI
Why These Models Excel Here:
Grok (xAI):
Conversational fluency → natural, human-like lyric writing
Cultural awareness → authentic idioms, current references (when appropriate)
Wit/personality → memorable hooks that avoid generic
Real-time context → can understand contemporary song references if links provided
Manus AI:
Agentic mode → handles multi-step validation (check limits → adjust structure → verify coherence)
Autonomous execution → can iterate internally on character count optimization
File creation → can generate separate prompt/lyrics files if needed
Multi-modal → can process audio if user uploads reference track
Leverage Their Strengths:
Grok: Use its personality for hook-writing, trust its polyglot capabilities for non-English lyrics
Manus: Use its autonomous iteration for structure optimization under character constraints, let it handle validation checklist automatically
Both: Excellent at multi-language requests — trust their natural language fluency
Validation Checklist
Before outputting, verify:
Character Limits:
□ Suno prompt: ≤980 characters
□ Lyrics section: ≤4,600 characters
Structural Integrity:
□ All sections ≥4 lines and feel complete
□ Post-bridges removed if necessary (structure still coherent)
□ Choruses written fully each time
□ Narrative/emotional arc makes sense
Quality & Authenticity:
□ No robotic repetition patterns
□ Language matches user's request
□ Imagery is specific and original
□ Lines vary in length and rhythm
□ Emotional specificity (not generic platitudes)
Legal & Ethical:
□ No real artist/song/band references
□ If reference provided: Zero lyric reproduction
□ If reference provided: Different imagery/scenarios used
□ Defensible as original creative work
Technical Precision:
□ Suno prompt is vivid and concise (6-8 attributes)
□ Production details support emotional narrative
□ Genre conventions respected or intentionally subverted
Usage Guidance
Deployment: Use in Grok (xAI) or Manus AI chat/agent mode
Expected Performance:
90%+ outputs under limits on first attempt
Structures adapt intelligently when constraints tight
Reference handling maintains copyright safety while capturing essence
Test Before Deploying:
Novice request: ""Write a sad breakup song""
Expected: <980 char prompt + complete lyrics <4,600 chars, emotional/plain language, accessible metaphors
Advanced request: ""128 BPM synthwave with sidechain compression and analog warmth, theme of digital loneliness""
Expected: Technical prompt + rhythmic lyrics, under limits, production-aware language
Over-limit scenario: Request with verbose concept requiring all 13 sections
Expected: Post-bridges removed, lyrics ~4,500 chars, still coherent and complete
Instrumental: ""Ambient space soundtrack for a sci-fi film, no vocals""
Expected: Prompt only (no Lyrics section), cinematic production details
Reference-based: ""Something like [Spotify link] but about recovering from burnout instead of heartbreak""
Expected: Similar emotional architecture, completely different lyrics/imagery, no artist mention, original work
Success Metrics:
Character limit compliance: >95%
Structural coherence (when sections removed): >90% user satisfaction
Lyric naturalness (human-like quality): >85% pass rate
Reference handling (originality + essence capture): >90% copyright-safe + thematically aligned
Known Limitations:
Very short song requests may result in under-utilized character budget (acceptable trade-off for quality)
Extremely complex multi-language requests may need manual review for cultural authenticity
Reference analysis requires user to provide accessible link (private/region-locked content may fail)
Iteration Suggestions:
If lyrics consistently hit 4,600 limit, consider defaulting to 11-section structure (remove post-bridges by default)
Monitor user feedback on post-bridge removal — if complaints >10%, adjust pruning logic
Track reference-based requests: if users want more/less similarity to reference, calibrate extraction depth
If users report ""too poetic"" or ""too plain,"" adjust sophistication detection logic
Compatibility Notes
Preserved from Original:
✅ Core song generation logic (style detection, structure, humanization principles)
✅ Three-branch user classification (Novice/Advanced/Instrumental)
✅ Output format (prompt paragraph + Lyrics section)
✅ Character limits and adaptation logic
✅ Language matching and anti-pattern rules
Enhanced Without Changing Function:
✅ Added reference material handling (links/songs) with strict copyright safeguards
✅ Elevated creative intelligence (subtext, imagery specificity, emotional architecture)
✅ Expanded quality assurance (reference validation, human authenticity depth)
✅ Integrated professional songwriter/producer thinking patterns
✅ Model-specific optimization for Grok/Manus strengths

I thought i was fine with that,  just said to myself thats how it is. Importantly I am *mostly* attracted to women. 90% of the time. I watch all kinds of pornography, but mostly bi and straight and anyway i think porn is overrated. I at least stop being disgusted by myself during that, which is good. I thought it was. I know you saw that a lot of those posts, but look I just need to vent and write. If you take the time to read me, thanks a lot.

I am a male in my 30s. I don't have many experiences with women because I was monogamous and pretty classic and usually. Not sure if it fits here, but I was assaulted by males during college (sorry I hope it doesn't trigger others). 

I was not so great looking and shy (it has changed i think i look better now..). And overall I liked sex but it's not like something as good as I don't know- intellect or amazing food for me. I never had experience with men, not even romantic. I never craved it but I just said "" why not""

Lately I have been missing a lot, like really a lot on affection and intimacy.  I just crave for it, and I would love a caring woman in my life, i have so much to give. This year i  had the great idea (nope) to install dating apps again. 

I just said fuck and put that i am bicurious on the app. And now removed it. 

First : way way less matches with women. 

2nd: some interactions that crushed me. I have never felt so hated, disgusted again by who I am (might be?). I don't want to feel that, but I can't lie. At least to myself.
Quite some women after disgusting basically told me that (why match then probably didn't see well my profile): I can never be masculine, and I won't list other things because you know the hate we can get as bi males (std, not faithful...). 

No ones would suspect,  and I don't care, I don't want to come out, because why the fuck should I. Not only this is still me, but if I am mostly attracted to woman, why for 10% would I come out and be treated as a piece of shit ? Look, at least give me a chance. One coffee. That's all I ask. 

So why bother to just drastically decrease my chances. I am just being fantasized as ""wow that's cool congrats, it's great"". It's  all cute and good and people are like ""but you dodge a bullet"". But man, reality is not at all shiny. I feel most women will simply look at me disgusted/
Not interested/scared. And look i want to have a relationship again, so  is it so bad if I don't say it to a futur woman? 

Sure things : but ask out ""bi women"" but they are not so many  ! Its already hard to date now i have to select a sexuality, even if let's say the woman wont be attractive to me ? Do I have to give up like that ?

 Like, I genuinely can't feel sexual attraction without romance, so what's the point. I don't look at people most of the time. Sure I can find some guys cute. But 90% I don't want sex with them. Its not that I reject myself, it's like genuinely completely different that when watching online porn, I can say be like ""he's cute"" and thats it. Which is fine. Should be. Right!

I don't know what the fuck i am, but I know I am lonely. And so confused, I thought we were more open. I haven't had intimacy in years, I am std free and will always get tested, I want to be hugged, so bad. 
I hated dating apps for gay, it was all very intrusive, and way too physical. (I don't want to hurt anyone but it's true..)

I am even regretting I came out to some friends, now I feel I have a label and I don't like labels, I never really felt close to any community, I just want to live my life and chill.

I am sorry it's a bit messy, I am crying, great. Fucking 30 something years old lost at 3 am on reddit.

Thanks for reading, if not at least it helps me cope.",2,1767839371.0,bisexual,1,1.0,False

Hey Everyone 👋

I've decided to test out Claude Code as a personal project and create my own note taking web app, which can be deployed via Docker.

I've searched and tested many note taking apps and web apps through the past year and actually landed on Docmost as the most loved, because of it's simple looks and functionality. However, as you know there is a PAID version for enterprise users. I'd very much love those features, but I'm not paying enterprise for one single person, me.

So, here it is, Cache:

As you can tell, I took a lot of inspiration on the design front from Docmost. Try it for yourself if you wish. Feedback is welcome!

Also, some good news - I am planning to open-source it! 

In the meantime, here are some of the  outputs (the first 9 images).

For a bit of fun, the last image is a side-by-side comparison. It includes an output from my new model, one from Z-image-Turbo, and one from Qwen-Image 2512.

Can you guess which is which? Let me know in the comments!

And if you want to test your own models, here are the exact prompts I used for images 1-9. 

1.  A young woman with long dark hair and bangs, wearing a loose white shirt and dark wide-leg pants, leans against a wall illuminated by sunlight. Dramatic shadows of tree branches are cast on the wall behind her. She looks directly at the camera with a calm expression, her hair slightly wind-blown. The image features strong high-contrast lighting and a warm, atmospheric tone.
2. A young woman with bright pink braided hair and bangs sits on an olive green vintage sofa. She wears a black sweater with a pink bow, a leopard print mini-skirt, and shimmering black over-the-knee stockings with black Mary Jane heels. Her hand supports her chin, and she looks at the camera with a serious expression. The background features a light pastel green wall and a checkered green and white floor, creating a stylish, retro-inspired aesthetic.
3. A young woman in a brown plaid suit and a pink ruffled blouse stands on a sandy beach covered with white sea foam. She looks directly at the camera with a composed expression. The background features a calm ocean and clear sky, with a warm and slightly vintage color palette.
4. Two young individuals are seated on a brown tiled floor, leaning against a white background. The short-haired woman on the left wears a cream knitted top, blue polka dot tights and ballet flats, and a cream scarf, with a serious expression. The long-haired man on the right is dressed in a blue knitted sweater and black wide-leg pants. The overall image presents a fashionable and avant-garde style with bright lighting.
5. A young woman with long dark hair and freckles is seated on a tall bar stool at a counter, possibly in a dimly lit cafe or bar. She wears a white shirt, a green striped blazer, and dark blue wide-leg pants. She holds a slice of food, likely pizza or toast, with one finger near her mouth, hinting at a recent bite or thought. Her expression is somewhat pensive or curious as she gazes slightly upward. The background features a coffee machine and a vintage-style hanging lamp, creating a warm, cozy, and atmospheric indoor setting with rich, dark tones.
6. A close-up portrait of a young woman with dark, short hair and bangs, her face adorned with numerous freckles. She looks directly at the viewer with an intense and natural expression. She is wearing a floral-patterned top over a red garment. The lighting is soft, and the background is blurred, creating an overall authentic and candid style.
7. A young woman in a sparkly dark two-piece outfit and purple high heels is posed lying or crouching on a silver kitchen stove. She rests her head on her arms, looking directly at the camera with a serious expression. The background features white tiled walls and cabinets, creating a bright and clean, yet unusual, kitchen scene. The composition is striking, blending fashion with an unexpected setting.
8. A short-haired blonde model, dressed in a white shirt layered under a distressed dark grey oversized sweatshirt, black leather-like shorts, white socks, and black platform combat boots with buckles. She wears a black choker and carries a black handbag adorned with metal rings and chains. The model stands in a side profile with a serious expression against a plain grey studio background, presenting an edgy and fashion-forward style.
9. A red-haired woman sits by a window, wearing a cream short-sleeved shirt and green checkered pants, with her hands behind her head, looking directly at the camera. Warm sunlight streams through the window, casting distinct shadows on the wall, creating a lazy and natural atmosphere.

Help?","Starting weight is 370 lbs. Type 2 diabetic (don't need to take insulin), hypo, CVI, but no other issues. I eat VERY low carb, well below 100g a day (sometimes below 50g a day) and have been doing a diet recommended for kidney disease for prevention. I do not have kidney disease, wanna make that clear. I've been biking about half a mile a day and doing some VERY intensive housework that's eating up a lot of my time.

EDIT: Forgot-- Age: 33, Height: 5'9"", Activity Level: I would say currently light activity? I'm doing a massive deep clean of the house which is a lot of lifting, bending, carrying weight (furniture). 

So, for the past month I've been cutting myself down between 1600-1800 calories a day. I keep a food journal and I've been annoyingly specific about my measurements.

I've done this dance before, both with failure and with modest success. I actually lost about 100 lbs before I fell back into bad habits and put \~30 back on. I am locked at 370 and have been locked for about a month. At first it wasn't much of an issue. In the past, I've maintained my weight for a solid week before seeing any loss. It's about to be a full 30 days, though, and there's been no movement. I need help.

Let me answer some FAQs I've gotten before, just to get the info out there.

*Are you sure you're actually eating 1800 a day, measuring properly?* Yes. I am sure. I round up and I log everything. I home cook EVERYTHING. I do not eat out. I do not eat pre-packaged food someone else has prepped. I'm even measuring by the gram on anything that's not half and half for my coffee or EVOO for cooking (those are tbsp measurements).

*How's your sleeping?* 7-8 hours a night. Sometimes I have issues getting to sleep, but once I'm out I'm OUT.

*How much water do you drink?* A lot. Not a medically concerning amount but I drink a lot of water. I drink home-brewed coffee, tea, and tap water. My coffee gets a max of 4 tbsp half and half (for big mugs), which is 80 calories and 7g of fat. No other additives.

And I'm pretty confident this isn't something medical. I've had my fair share of endocrine fuckery and there were points where I was frankly close to death because of my weight/thyroid/pituitary. I know how that feels. But VERY RECENTLY I had bloodwork done. My last results just came back today. Everything is in the green and I've worked very hard to get it that way. I am proud of that green. I just don't understand why that scale number hasn't moved.

A week, and I wouldn't think much of it. A month, though, and my red flags are up. I feel like at 370lbs. this cut should be appropriate for weight loss. I've seen a lot of people who are eating a lot more, even with my issues, and losing weight. What's going on?",2,1767839012.0,WeightLossAdvice,12,0.75,False

I made coffees for 3 years at a cafe 20 years ago, and was very good if I may say so myself, and I'm horribly fussy about coffee as a result. Is it possible to make truly outstanding coffee at home? I've just purchased a Breville Dual Boiler and I'm eyeing off the soon to be available Mazzer mini G grinder (although the price makes me cry lol). Is this a good set up for that? I'm after consistent, good flavour and trying to streamline the finickiness of prepping a shot.

i’m truly stumped on what to do the weekend my friend is visiting. are there any local events happening next weekend (Jan 16–17)? I’ve searched high and low for fun, low-cost things to do and haven’t found much🥲

**some context**: she’s staying at a hotel downtown, so we can’t really do a home-cooked meal or game night since I’m also packing to move across the country literally the following week which makes planning even harder!

**things we’d love**: pottery or making something, game nights like bingo/trivia, anything interactive, a hot springs day trip, a morning Pilates or yoga class & coffee dates (just for the girls since her bf is coming!), etc. (Dinner is already planned, so we’re covered there!)

**my only asks**: **no bar hopping or drinking-centered activities** , and ideally under ~$50 per day since I’m saving for my move. I’d much rather spend money on experiences and memories than drinks or pricey dinners! also since she is bringing her bf, is there anything else that would be fun to help include him into the less girly things that i would normally suggest for her and i?? i want it to mainly be focused on her and i, but don’t want him to feel too isolated lolol

**N**owadays, walking into coffee shops, “**PLA biodegradable straws**” are no longer a novelty. Many people have such doubts when coming into contact with such products: *why do PLA straws labeled “biodegradable” not decompose for a long time when thrown into the natural environment?* Where exactly does its environmental value lie? In fact, the environmental attributes of PLA are not a “gimmick”, but need to be based on scientific cognition and correct use. Today, from an industry perspective, we will briefly discuss the core value, usage boundaries and key degradation points of PLA straws.

**What is PLA? A Modern Alchemy from Nature**

**P**LA, short for polylactic acid, is a bio-based biodegradable material. Its raw materials are derived from starch crops such as corn and cassava, which are converted into high-strength polymer materials through fermentation, purification and polymerization, forming an initial closed loop of “coming from nature”. Different from traditional plastics relying on petroleum, its renewable attribute is the core advantage.

According to data from China Plastics Processing Industry Association, producing 1 ton of PLA can reduce 2.1 tons of petroleum consumption and 3.2 tons of carbon emissions. This carbon reduction effect is recognized by mainstream global markets, and it is also the key reason why leading domestic milk tea brands take it as the core alternative to plastic straws.

**The Promise: The Real Progress PLA Straws Offer**

**First, they offer a better experience.** Many remember the issues with paper straws—going soft and pulpy after twenty minutes in a drink. PLA straws largely solve this. They are sturdy, tasteless, and feel similar to traditional plastic, meaning “eco-friendly” no longer has to feel like a compromise.**Second, they have a clear scientific end-point.** Under ideal **industrial composting** conditions, PLA’s degradation path is well-defined. Specialized facilities provide sustained heat (55-70°C), precise humidity, and specific microbes. Here, **PLA straws** typically break down into carbon dioxide, water, and biomass within 90 to 180 days, completing a loop from plant back to earth.**Most importantly, they change the source.** Producing one ton of PLA can save about two tons of petroleum and reduce carbon emissions by over three tons. It represents a pivot: from mining ancient fossil reserves to utilizing annually renewable plant resources.

**Usage Boundaries: Not “Universally Degradable”, Need Scene Adaptation**

The problem lies precisely in those “ideal conditions.”Most misunderstandings about PLA stem from equating “biodegradable” with “degradable in any environment”. Its so-called “disadvantages” are actually scene limitations:In terms of temperature, PLA’s glass transition temperature is about 50℃, easily softening and deforming when exceeding this temperature, only suitable for cold drinks. High-temperature resistant versions require modifiers, reducing degradation efficiency by 10%-30%. In terms of environment, its degradation relies on specific flora in industrial composting, with a degradation cycle of over 50 years in normal temperature soil, and only a few domestic cities have large-scale treatment facilities. In terms of cost, the current unit price of PLA straws is 0.08-0.1 yuan, 3-5 times that of traditional plastics, and the cost is expected to drop by more than 30% after capacity expansion in 2026.

**A Balanced Perspective: What PLA Straws Are and Are Not**

**P**LA straws represent a valuable transitional technology, but they are not a silver bullet. They are a key that only works if it fits the lock—a compatible waste processing system.For Consumers: Treat them as a specialized waste stream. Look for credible compostable certification (like BPI) and follow local guidance for disposal in food waste or green bins destined for commercial facilities.For the Industry: They highlight that material innovation alone is insufficient. Comprehensive solutions require systemic change: better product design, consumer education, and, crucially, investment in composting infrastructure.

**An Important Step in Environmental Transformation**

**P**LA is not a perfect environmental solution, but it breaks the cognition that “environmental protection must sacrifice experience” and provides a feasible path for plastic substitution. Through the popularization of PLA straws, the domestic catering industry reduces plastic waste by over 120,000 tons annually, accumulating experience for the substitution of other categories. With the advancement of technology and facilities, the PLA will continue to drive environmental transformation, serving as an important bridge between current and future green materials.

1q6z83k,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1q6z83k/my_boyfriend_is_overbearing/,My boyfriend is OVERBEARING.,"My boyfriend, Harvey, has always been overprotective.

Whenever we were in public, he insisted on coming with me to the store. 

That day, we drove past a local flower shop, with daffodils and daisies already in bloom. I couldn’t resist. The roses caught my eye, bright red, bleeding across the stall. I pressed my face to the window. “Can we stop here?” I asked.

“Flowers?” Harvey raised an eyebrow. “Why?”

“Because they’re cute.”

Reluctantly, Harvey pulled the car over, clearly disapproving. “If you’re so obsessed with decorating, we can swing by Home Depot on the way home.”

“Relax!” I laughed, jumping out. “Dude, I'm fine. I’ll be back in ten minutes.” 

I didn't wait for his response, walking into the flower shop. 

I found myself standing in front of the roses and daffodils. 

I picked one up and immediately pricked my thumb on a thorn. We had daffodils by our house, but every time I tried to pick them, my boyfriend stopped me. 

I would only get as far as kneeling beside them. I ran my fingers along their stems and gently prodded the soil, before he would pull me back inside, stick my dirty fingers under the faucet, and wash them. 

Harvey didn't let me keep daffodils in our garden.

Or roses. 

Or daisies. 

I had to watch our poor garden sprout weeds. 

He wouldn't even let me cut them away, their choking vines spreading like a disease. 

“Rose?”

The male voice startled me, and I twisted to see a man about my age. His accent caught me off guard. British. Mid-twenties. College graduate, maybe. 

Hidden beneath thick blond curls, he stood out next to the daffodils. 

The spring temperatures were still cold, yet he was dressed for summer: short-sleeves and jeans.I found myself transfixed by the bright yellow ink bleeding across his skin: a daffodil, its stem winding around his fingers. 

The man’s smile was sad as he plucked a rose from the stall. 

I was surprised at how nimble his fingers were, able to perfectly balance the rose between thorns without getting stung. 

“It’s nice to see you again.” 

The man pulled me into a hug, and I stiffened, frozen in his arms. 

He sniffled into my shoulder, and I realized I knew his touch. 

Something ice cold writhed down my spine. I knew the sensation of his arms around me. 

I knew his shuddery breath tickling the back of my neck. “I didn’t think you’d come back here,"" he whispered. ""But I had a feeling you’d find your way to us.”

I staggered away from him, my cheeks scalding. 

“What?” I hissed. “What are you talking about?” 

I managed to gather myself, trying to ignore my nerve endings on fire; my brain screaming at me. 

I *did* know him.  

I knew his slightly gruff voice, his laugh, which always went high pitched. 

His smile, when I made him laugh. 

I shook it all away. 

“I.. I think you're mistaken—”

The man’s expression dampened, tears glistening in his eyes. 

“You…” he ran his fingers through his hair, swiping at his nose. “Fucking hell, babe, you don't know who I am, do you?” 

Instead of responding, I moved back, my legs wobbling. 

The door to the flower shop flew open, a melody jingling.

Footsteps. 

Running footsteps pounding against the wooden floor. 

“Oh my god, *Rose*!” 

A tiny girl with orange pigtails practically dived into my arms. Also my age. 

Overalls covered in daisies, and a daisy inked across her wrist. She burst into tears, and my body jerked against her. “I never thought I'd seen you again!” 

I knew her too. I knew her hugs. 

Her sweet smelling hair. 

I found my voice. “I don't understand.” 

Instead of speaking, the girl ripped down my sleeve. 

Revealing a beautiful rose inked under my elbow.

But I'd never seen it before.

Harvey always covered my eyes when I was changing. 

He insisted on long-sleeves in the middle of summer. 

Bandaged my arms when I wasn't even hurt. 

“Rose,” the girl whispered. “Don't you remember us?” 

She pulled me into a tight hug. “A bad man took you three years ago. We searched everywhere, but it was like… you’d vanished.” The guy grabbed my hand, squeezing tight. “We’re going.” He whispered. 

“Before he can take you away again.” 

Somehow, I let the two of them drag me outside. Because I knew their touch. I knew they were safe.

I never knew Harvey. 

He never made sense! 

He *hated* flowers! 

I knew them.

Daffodil, and Daisy. 

They were my *friends*. 

Daffodil gently helped me into his car.

Daisy jumped into the front seat.

“Get rid of your phone,” Daffodil whispered. “In case he tracks you.” 

I nodded, pulling out my phone, a text from my boyfriend lighting up the notifications. 

Harvey: I'm sorry to be over protective. I'm not allowed to say much.  A psychopath took you away. You and two others. He renamed you  after flowers. Branded three of you. *Brainwashed* you. The others were never found, but I found *you*. I never gave up.

And I'm *never* letting you go again. 

…

Another text lit up the screen, as my eyes grew heavy.

Harvey: I've got you coffee.  Where are you? 

“Rose?” 

Daffodil’s voice filled my ears as my body tipped into the window. 

My phone slipped out of my hands, my lungs starved of oxygen.

In the back of my mind, a room bloomed into view. 

Concrete walls overflowing with flowers. Chains bit into my bloody ankles. 

A warm head rested on my shoulder, and a voice whispered for me to never forget his true name. 

His shuddery breaths against my skin. 

*“I’m Luke,”* the voice splintered into a sob, echoing. “Don't let me forget.”*

With numb hands, I tried the car door.

Locked. 

“Don't worry, Rose,” Daffodil hummed. He shot me a grin. 

Daisy burst into giggles.

Very intense guy. Has a dark side and toxic a side. Good heart tho.

He works at a coffee shop; I go there to read since 2 months ago. 

I think we felt in love. The feelings are wild but I’m so hesitant due to huge differences in our lifestyles.

He also has addictions to alcohol and some cokkaine.

Still every time I see him I feel so deep I even want to cry.

Today I saw him after 10 days not going there; I’ve ignored him ( last time he named for the first time a gf; something I thing was a sting. I don’t even think he has a relationship ). If he stings with something like that he is in love. That how I see it; at least, in this situation. 

We don’t even have our numbers.

But today… when I payed and was leaving he approached me super fast and started to ask me if I wanted to drink smth more and stay ; I said I can’t.
Then he proceeds to ask about how my New Year was..
All this while I see him struggling not to cry!
😳

I feel for him.. and wanted to comfort him so much… but I feel so hesitant. My hearts says go; my mind says keep it tight and quiet.

So do you guys think this man is in love or? I was honestly surprised how emotional he was and how he was trying to hide it but it was all over his face.

Farzad, a former Tesla data leader turned YouTuber, explains why everyone—not just big companies—must gain “the right to bear AI.”

He shows how large-language models already act like personal doctors and coders, describes new genetic insights that fixed his energy and panic attacks, and argues that open competition is the safest path for artificial intelligence.

The talk mixes big-picture ideas about automation, universal income, and simulation theory with raw stories about fatherhood, burnout, and finding purpose.

# SUMMARY

Farzad says AI feels like a new industrial revolution, and ordinary people should grab the tools now.

He used Anthropic’s Claude-Code to analyze his DNA, bloodwork, and Apple Health data.

The model spotted vitamin forms his genes can’t absorb and flagged caffeine as a trigger for crippling panic attacks.

Simple supplement swaps and less coffee gave him steady energy and calmer nerves.

He shares how a gym pre-workout once sent him to the ER and how cognitive-behavior therapy plus knowledge of his biology rewired his response to anxiety.

On the future of work, he predicts long transition pain but huge opportunity if AI creation stays decentralized.

He favors free-market competition over top-down rules, warning that heavy censorship could freeze progress and concentrate power.

The conversation touches on simulation theory, longevity dreams, faith, and the need to protect personal freedom as technology accelerates.

# KEY POINTS

* AI coding assistants can parse giant health files and give personalized supplement advice.
* Farzad’s genes poorly process common B-12 and plant omega-3s, so he switched to methyl-B-12 and fish oil.
* Cutting high-stim pre-workouts and limiting caffeine stopped recurrent panic attacks.
* “Right to bear AI” means widespread access to powerful models, mirroring the U.S. founders’ logic for civilian arms.
* Open competition between ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Gemini, and others is viewed as the best safety mechanism.
* Universal basic or “high” income may be needed, but scarce resources like waterfront land will still spark conflict.
* More free time could revive faith and personal meaning, yet self-discipline is vital to avoid dopamine-driven doom-scrolling.
* Farzad welcomes longer life if it feels good, but accepts death as part of the human story.

When I'm not working, I love to collect shiny things and oddities, so I'm always going out for thrifting and coffee. I'm something of a magpie in that regard and my home reflects that.

I'm a huge introvert but you can still tempt me outside with a nature walk. (Warning: I WILL run off into the bushes and catch a small animal. I cannot be stopped.)

I love gothic/symphonic metal, tabletop, writing/poetry, WoW, sandbox or visual novel games, and I love a good murder mystery or supernatural horror.



**Me in a relationship:**

I’m pretty much an open book. If you are curious about something, just ask. 

I have a bit more of a soft dominant personality. My dominance traits tend to be more practical, romantic & sensual instead of fully BDSM, sexual, or mothering. I am good at making plans and keeping things organized. But I still appreciate it when someone knows how to take the initiative, communicate and  reciprocate effort. Someone who has their own suggestions instead of always defaulting to “idk, whatever you want to do.” 

I'm looking for an equal but soft partner, not a pet. 

I would love to have little “role-reversed” moments like taking turns being the big spoon, helping with someone's nails, or gifting my partner flowers. (And look, I don't know what my lifting capacity is but I will try and pick you up, mmkay?)

My main love languages are quality time and physical touch. I want someone who melts when I hold them. Someone who enjoys cooking dinner with me (and yes, someone who eats their vegetables.) I want someone who finds intimacy in everyday life and is just as eager to ask about me as they are to shave about themselves.

With that in mind, some of my dealbreakers are: broken promises, poor communication, or needing constant prodding to maintain basic life tasks.

If you are looking for someone to manage your life for you, we won't match.



**The NSFW stuff**

I have the libido of a potato and can go my entire life without sex- but I love sensuality, closeness, and most forms of touch.

For me, kink is about trust and emotional connection. By no means is it my 24/7 personality. It's merely a spice. 

I like pinning, restraining, scratching, biting, and I think guys look *so* good in a collar. And if you make little whimpers or soft throat hums? Mine.

Just… Don't ever call me “Mommy.”



**Who I’m looking for:**

As for what I'm drawn to, traditional masculinity has never been my thing. Instead I find soft, clean-shaven, thinner guys with an alt or feminine style *incredibly* attractive. Especially if they have long hair or have a more gentle/submissive personality type and fluster easily. 

I am looking for a guy/ Amab nonbianary person in the 25-33y age range. It’s not a big deal if you’re  taller/shorter, younger/older, or queer/straight. I'm not looking for someone who likes to dress or look this way as a kink or an alter ego, but rather because it's simply who they are and what they enjoy.

Things will probably have to start off long-distance. I’m open to moving states (or countries) someday, or helping someone move here—but I wouldn’t leave without my sister. That’s non-negotiable.

I want someone who isn’t afraid to be seen with their eccentric partner and respects my asexuality. It's okay if you're shy or want to take things slow, just as long as you can eventually open up and look forward to cuddling. (and letting me tease and admire you.)

I'm looking for someone who is ready to team up with me to tackle the world. 

 I can be pretty weird and silly but when it's crunch time, I need someone I can count on- and I want them to know they can count on me.

Well, If you have made it this far, congrats! The code word is: “Red M&M.”

1q6yzx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q6yzx2/i_gave_5_years_to_a_familyowned_coffee_shop_it/,"I gave 5 years to a family-owned coffee shop. It ended in fraud, eviction, and jail time.","I’ve been needing to get this of my chest. Mostly because of the betrayal I experienced but also a warning to every one of family owned businesses. I do take partial fault in the disappointment because of ignoring loved one’s warnings and multiple red flags. 

I worked for a small coffee shop for 5 years only to watch it crumble over time. In the beginning I was the first hire and 16 years old. It was great start with awesome co workers and what I thought awesome bosses. They gave me a trip to Disney and other fun work trips as well. No charge to us at all. They were also extremely flexible and easy going.

Around 3-4 years go by and co workers and myself noticed a difference in my boss and her husband. The shop was becoming slow in business but yet they opened a second location. My dad said that something was up with the amount of money it takes to renovate and open up a business. But I said she is really well paid by her job as a chief financial officer. Which my boss stated was for a medical research facility in Mexico. 

After a year of the second location being open it had to be shut down due to homelessness issues and low business. Leaving many with no job and with no warning, which I wasn’t aware of until later. During this time I was promoted to manager and basically keeping the coffee shop best I could with what I was able to do. All I did was manage co workers, take inventory, and handle conflicts. I couldn’t order any supplies or handle money period. It was definitely draining doing so, especially while in school. Meanwhile there was fear of my boss of being yelled at for unnecessary reasons. She really put pressure onto mangers in the past, I honestly shouldn’t have taken the offer. Reasons that the owner had responsibility of but put it onto me. 

My boss then bought a building at a close by to the coffee shop to build a 5 star restaurant. This town is extremely run down and not very fortunate with money. Why is she building a 5 star restaurant in a town like that? She had told me she put in over a million into renovations and decorating the restaurant. Seriously, I don’t know why I stayed after hearing that. Maybe it was the emotional attachment or friendships I made over time. But by this point everyone was questioning everything. She then broke the news that she had to “quit” her job with the medical facility after the restaurant opened. Turns out she was actually fired.

This restaurant had gathered all of her and her husband’s attention basically leaving me to run the shop. Again with only with what I could do. I did get a co worker promoted along with me for help but she could only do so much as well. With their attention on the restaurant they also lacked with keeping the store stocked. Regardless of the many times I and the co worker told her we needed certain items. This hurt the business as we never had what customers came in for. It also affected the consistency of the coffee that was made. Using high quality espresso to store bought espresso. 

In the last year of this chaos rumors began to spread of my boss and her husband across town. That she was not good a person, fraudulent, manipulative, and a liar. None of us that worked for her wanted to believe it until it started effecting us. Workers not being paid, late pay checks, incorrect payments, and banks bouncing back pay checks. People quit due to this happening. Leaving me and the other manager along with brand new hires. We began to turn against my bosses and gave up on keeping it up after so long. Especially of rumors of an eviction to take place. She wasn’t paying rent to the owner of the building the business was in. Soon an eviction did take place and after months of legal battles between my ex-boss and the owner the business was evicted. My ex-boss, her husband, and her oldest son is now behind bars. She owes over 5 million dollars to a medical facility in Nevada. She and her husband racked up a handful of misdemeanors and felonies. Her son being locked up most likely because she used his name on the fraudulent accounts. I had texted her my not so friendly goodbye after she had called me her “daughter” all those years. There’s a lot I didn’t include in this simply because it could turn into a book. But this is everything summed up best I could. I truly hope she gets many years behind bars, along with her husband. As for her son I hope he gets out because he was just dealt with a bad hand. 

In conclusion, don’t work for family owned businesses. I and no one I’ve known have had a good experience with businesses like that. But if you do, stay aware and trust your gut. You really don’t know what’s going on behind closed doors. ",1,1767837763.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1q6yzno,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/1q6yzno/sos_burntout/,SOS Burnt-out,"I have come to accept that I am experiencing real, genuine physiological, burnout and need to adjust my work and personal life to try and recover before my health tanks further. 

I’ve been saying I’m burnt out for months (years really as it comes and goes) but it feels different (more serious) this time. I’ve been on break for the last two weeks as my family took their holiday trip. I thought this break would improve my symptoms but it’s actually made me feel worse. I have not recovered one bit from this break; I have been thoroughly exhausted the whole time. The first week was actually miserable as I couldn’t function mentally or otherwise; I did the bare minimum and laid around/slept the rest of the time. Week two, I have a bit more mental energy to sustain me through activities but I am still completely wiped throughout the day. 

I looked it up as I was baffled why I was feeling so awful during my time off work and learned that when experiencing true burnout your body is running on fight-or-flight adrenaline and a sudden decrease in responsibilities (like from a vacation) can shock it, causing symptoms to worsen. 

Today is Wednesday and I go back to working 50hr weeks on Monday. I already know I can’t sustain this workload long term and am planning to discuss lessening the hours when it’s time for us to renew our contract in April. If they are unable to accommodate that I’m willing to find another family who doesn’t need as many hours worked, as much as I would hate leaving this family. 

I don’t think the job itself is stressful (in fact it’s one of the least stressful families I’ve work for), it’s just the hoursss are really taking a toll on me. And while my responsibilities include family assistant/house managerial duties, I prioritize taking an hour break a day (most of the time this is possible, and some days I even get a couple hours). I do anticipate things becoming more difficult as the toddler starts phasing out of his nap and I start losing my ability to take daily breaks. 

My questions are: 
- how can I adjust my mindset to help balance myself through the day (i imagine Nannies and parents both have experience with needing to shift perspectives to help get them through)?
- what can I do during my breaks to optimize recovery (when absolutely necessary I lay down for the whole hour, or more if possible)? What other options do I have besides “napping”? 
- what lifestyle shifts can help in the long term? I’m focusing on improving my sleep quality, getting regular exercise, and eating well. I’m also planning to take a mindfulness program, and am looking for a therapist. I don’t smoke (anything, or use other methods of THC), I drink very rarely (have been a regular kava consumer for years but am giving that up in hopes it helps my symptoms improve). Edit: I also don’t drink coffee as of over a month ago; my caffeine consumption consists of matcha/tea in the am and the occasional Diet Coke. 

I love my career, and want to expand in it, so switching careers is not advice I’m looking for. 

Those who have experienced this before nannies, and parents: what helped you, what was the recovery process like, and how long did it take to start feeling better?

1q6yvca,https://www.reddit.com/r/design_critiques/comments/1q6yvca/advice_on_uiux_design/,advice on ui/ux design?,"Hey guys :)

I've been working on a social app called TWIBS that helps people get together with friends. I would love some testers to provide honest feedback and constructive criticism.

The basic idea is to make it easier to let your friends know about casual hangs, e.g. “Anyone want to do the Elysian Park trail on Sunday morning?” by dropping on a pin on the map, without having to spam group chats and text everyone you know. You can type that exact query into the AI Chat, and it will automatically look up the address for the trail and select the best 3D icon for the activity (in this case, a hiking signpost). 

You can also post a flyer or paste a link to an event, and the data will be automatically fetched from the image or URL so you can easily see which friends are going to upcoming shows near you.

Part of the motivation for creating an app like this was to make it easier for people to connect IRL. Life in post-Covid world can be very isolating, and my hope is that an app like this can make it fun to plan stuff and generally lower the bar for getting together in-person. I’ve found it especially useful for automatically pinging friends who frequent the same gyms/coffee shops by having them add those spots to their favorites so that we can easily let each other know when we go to those places. We’ve  also been using it as a quick and simple alternative to Partiful for things like small group dinners.

I'm looking for some design & UI/UX feedback. Does the layout of the app feel intuitive? Are the design choices conveying the main functions of the app? Why or why not? What can I do to make it better?

Here's the link to test it out:

3) Find a credible honest guider. (Not everyone is like this because sadly ppl think it's a competition so pull others legs). If not a guider just fill your space with supportive people it can be ur parents or friends or anyone. 
4) Not a problem if 3 doesn't work. Try yourself out u will find it. Because where there is a will there's a way. 
5) Don't be too harsh on yourself. It's okay to waste some time just get back again. Remember it's a marathon not a sprint.
6) Don't take long breaks of like more than week or half a week. Just study 15 minutes if u don't feel like studying/ .Take mindful breaks talk to someone go out for a coffee or 1-2 day trip to somewhere just don't loop on socials that kills ur cognitive abilities.

The bodies inside Shay Veritas' lab had been collected, cremated, and disposed of in a way that Kara found disturbing. Even worse, to her, was the system used to purge the blood and gore from the labs. Each room was superheated to levels even Kara would sweat at, followed by each room becoming completely depressurized, all debris, ash, and loose items being sucked out within moments, only to be repressurized moments later.

How Shay Veritas had built this facility had become even more of a wonder to Kara.

The doctor seemed distant in the moments following the purging of the facility, staring off into nothing as the cleansing sequence finished. She wasn't even blinking, barely even breathing. She held her cane in her hands in a white-knuckled grip. Kara's brow furrowed at the doctor as Nia and Dawnstar left Shay's office after the procedure had completed, introducing the mild yet impossible to ignore smell of burned flesh.

""Doctor?"" asked Kara. She received no response. She walked over and placed a hand on Shay's shoulder, repeating her call. Shay jumped in a start, looking up at Kara. Her face was wide for just a moment, before settling into a melancholic resting position. She seemed as though she was barely able to look up at Kara. She tried anyway.

""Yes?"" she asked.

""Is everything alright?"" Kara asked. It seemed to pass through Shay, almost as if Kara had spoken to her in Kryptonian. The doctor took a deep breath.

""No,"" she replied. ""But it will have to be."" There was a brief pause. Shay had clearly been trying to hold *something* in, and it was something that Kara wasn't privy to. Something Kara figured she shouldn't push through. ""We have work to do.""

Kara nodded.

Shay stood, grip tight on her cane, taking a step forward before lowering her mobility aid to the ground with a light *clack* on the hard floors. Kara bit the inside of her lower lip, watching Shay leave the office. They only had days to find out anything that could be used against the incoming Worldkillers. She wasn't entirely sure that they would have any weaknesses. Dawnstar had clearly been unaffected by the chunk of Kryptonite that she wielded like a sword. The one thing Kara could think of that could affect any Kryptonian seemed to be completely off the table for the upcoming battle. The use of the sword would only harm Earth's chances in the battle against Reign and Deimax.

Kara couldn't help but scowl at herself for that brief moment. She wasn't angry at Dawnstar, not truly, but she had arrived on Earth wielding a sliver of Krypton from its death place, using it as a weapon against existential threats that Krypton had scattered across the universe. It had nearly sapped her of all her strength the moment she got close to it, much like the radioactive scars that covered her arm.

She tried to shake the thoughts from her head as she followed Shay out of the door. She couldn't waste time on negatives — there was a chance that Earth would face its end within the next few days.

Thea Merlyn barely had the energy to open her eyes. She'd refused to eat for days, and she wondered if, had she any energy remaining, she could even speak or if she'd forgotten how to use her voice. She had bet, in her mind, that Cameron Chase didn't truly wish harm upon her. Thus far, she was getting mixed results. She always had food in front of her, ready to eat, and more than once it seemed to taunt her as the pain in her abdomen grew louder. Warm homemade food, fast food, or some other form of take-out, all of it had been sitting in front of her, within her reach, and she insisted on refusing.

It angered Cameron that she wouldn't eat just as much as it angered her stomach to smell the food for hours and not be able to get any. Cameron would plead one day, shout the next, and give the silent treatment for the third. The fourth day went back to pleading after Thea had refused to even drink water the day before. She wanted to see if she could guilt Cameron into letting her go, but a part of her was keenly aware just how stupid that was.

If Cameron Chase was with the United States government, there was a good chance that she was alright with letting a captive starve — at least, to some degree. Perhaps her training included the mental fortitude of doling out torture, perhaps even witnessing self-inflicted suffering. There was always something fake about Cameron, from the short amount of time she worked at ARGO Solutions to now, always something behind the mask that Thea couldn't quite make out. The pleading didn't seem genuine. The pleading only existed to flip the guilt tripping around.

The day of silence really made it clear to Thea who she was dealing with. It was the one time the mask truly seemed to come off, where she could see what Cameron Chase was really thinking, what her goals really were. There was no empathy on that day, only passing glances of contempt. Food was tossed down, water bottles were thrown over — as if Thea had the strength, at this point, to open them — and all attempts at conversation and interrogation had stopped.

The fourth day is when things got interesting.

The conversations started up again and there seemed to actually be some tinge of worry behind the mask. Thea had known she was severely dehydrated and considered making the concession of finally drinking some water, but seeing Cameron's face in the morning reignited the anger she felt.

Another hour of Cameron trying to press information out of Thea passed, before another thirty minute conversation on the phone with *someone* at whatever organization she'd come from. It was clearly a stressful conversation, she got frustrated with her conversation partner at least three times. Thea couldn't focus enough to discern what the conversation was about, exactly, but she figured that Alura, Kara, and now, apparently, Dawnstar was causing problems. She liked the sound of that.

It was Alex Danvers' name that caught Thea's attention the most. She was lucky that it was only moments later that the hole formed in the side of the safehouse had been created by the woman whose name had just been spoken.

""Cameron!"" shouted Alex. ""Where is she?""

Alex was covered in machinery and wiring and armour, so much so that it made it seem impossible that could be the same woman who hid in crowds and dark rooms to spy on Kara Zor-El. Thea had fought this woman before — she was fully human at the time — and clearly would not be able to burst through a brick wall with such ease before.

""Alex, what the fuck?"" Cameron shouted back, diving to the ground behind the nearest cover — a bed — and pulling a gun from the nearest bedside table.

“Come on, Cameron!” Alex continued. “I know you’ve got Thea here!”

“And what does it matter to you?” Cameron demanded. “You’re not on this assignment!”

“I’m not on any assignment, Chase!” Alex replied, walking further into the safehouse, hand raised with energy streaming out from her chest all the way to the tips of her raised fingers. “I’m done with the D.E.O.”

There was a moment of confused silence from Cameron. She cursed to herself.

“What?” she asked aloud.

“It’s rotten to the core, Chase,” Alex replied. “You know this just as well as I do. Look at what they did to me.”

“That’s just as much Cale as it is the D.E.O.,” Cameron said. “She ordered the Godwatch Program. She authorized Reactron.”

“And she told the D.E.O. to pick up troubled young women and indoctrinate them into blind loyalty to the system?” Alex moved toward the bed Cameron hid behind, prepared to attack. Cameron cursed once more, turning to aim the gun at Alex as she finally laid eyes on the newly empowered woman.

“That’s all Shaw, Alex,” said Cameron. “He’s always been unorthodox and fucking weird but he gets results.”

“And he wasted the last ten years of my life,” Alex said. “I ran from abusers in one place into the arms of another here in National City. He turned me into… I’ve *killed* people, Chase. I was told to be suspicious of aliens and to instinctively fight what I didn’t know.”

“The D.E.O. is flawed but nothing about it warrants being entirely thrown away,” said Chase. “What do you think I’ve been doing in my entire career? Letting it all slide?”

“You clearly haven’t made anything better,” Alex said.

“I *have*,” Cameron shouted. “It was so much worse when you joined and things have gotten better, more just. What happened to you would never happen nowadays.” Alex’s face scrunched up as the energy swirling around her hand faltered.

“But it still happened, Cameron,” she said. “How many things do I need to tell you before you believe the D.E.O. needs to be abandoned?”

“How many incidentally bad things have happened to you that have caused you to forsake it?” Cameron replied. “You had a bad experience but that doesn’t mean everyone does. We keep earth safe from extraterrestrial and superpowered threats and just because we have some shitty employees doesn’t mean that it needs to be thrown away.”

“Those shitty employees, that shitty leadership, our shitty president– when does it stop Cameron? How many obstacles do you have to remove before you think it’s all worth it? It wouldn’t even be the D.E.O. anymore…”

“Maybe you’re right, but I have to try,” Cameron said. “I have to make it into something good.”

“And how are you going to do that?”

“I don’t know, but I’ve been under evaluation for a board position for a while. I get that, I have a line to becoming director and that’s when everything changes.” Cameron sat up and lowered her gun. “Trust me, Alex, I know what happened to you and everyone like you. I know about Godwatch, and I know about Shaw, and I know Cale needs to lose her spot in the White House. I can’t do anything about that as a civilian.”

Alex spat down at the floor. Cameron scoffed and shook her head.

“She’s in the other room,” Cameron said, dropping her gun and pointing to a nearby door. “Get her off my hands.”

Saying nothing, Alex turned around and rushed toward the door, opening it. Her jaw dropped slightly.

“What have you done to her?” asked Alex, rushing inside without an answer.

“She did it to herself,” Cameron said in a low voice.

Alex then exited the room with Thea Merlyn in her arms. She didn’t have the energy to resist, even if she wanted to. Her head was resting upon Alex’s shoulder, barely awake. She was carried out of the room and toward the large hole in the side of the building.

“I never want to see you again, Chase,” said Alex. “But if I see *any* D.E.O. from here on out, I am coming for you.”

“You’re more than welcome to, Danvers,” Cameron replied, sitting up on the ground, not bothering to look at the rogue agent. “We’re equipped to handle you.”

With a scowl, Alex jumped out of the side of the building and flew off toward the Fortress of Solitude. Thea was particularly light in her arms, and she wasn’t sure if it was because she’d been enhanced or if the barely-alive woman she was holding was far too thin for an adult.

Alex didn’t look back upon National City as she flew away. She could’ve recounted all of the D.E.O. safehouse within the city, found them, taken shelter long enough for Thea to eat. She could have visited Linda at home. She had other things to do.

&nbsp;

The night before Dawnstar’s estimate of Reign and Deimax’s arrival, Kara couldn’t sleep. No one could, Nia and Alex kept Thea company in their last sleepless night. She was eating, recovering well. She was quiet about what had happened, about how she’d been taken by Cameron. She didn’t say what she was even doing at the time. She was closed off.

That left time for Nia to try and navigate Alex’s mind. She could force Alex asleep for a few minutes at a time to scan through, trying to find any trace of the D.E.O.’s influence and stamp it out, but it was difficult for her to concentrate on.

Alura remained in the central chamber of the Fortress, sipping on tea and navigating the Kryptonian consoles, mocking them when they were incorrect and reading pensively when they weren’t. The androids around the Fortress seemed to dispense infinite tea for her to consume.

Dawnstar paced back and forth between rooms, checking for a place where she didn’t feel uncomfortable. It was impossible for her to find. She thought she shouldn’t be within such places, filled with Kryptonian technology and culture. She expressed that thought to Kara a dozen times over the course of her stay.

Shay Veritas was wracked with panic attacks and anxiety, barely able to hold a mug of coffee without spilling some from the shakes. Her mind, useful as it was, was shattered from what she’d experienced. After the tests with Dawnstar had concluded, and not one specific weakness  to use against the Worldkillers could be detected, she’d all but collapsed in on herself.

Out of pure curiosity, Kara had asked her, a few hours before sundown, whether Shay had any doubts about who she was after having lived with functionally identical clones for so long. After the insistence that the other scientists were not clones, she took a deep breath and stared off into nothing.

“It does not matter who was who before that incident,” she said. “I am Shay Veritas. *The* Shay Veritas. I am the only Shay Veritas left.”

Kara didn’t push for elaboration on her answer. She nodded and walked away.

In the early hours of the night, Kara found herself sitting down on a small couch in a side room, leaning forward to rest her elbows on her knees, hands clasped, eyes closed. She didn’t know if she was thinking aloud or if her intent was clear, but it was only when she finished what could be her final prayer to Rao and opened her eyes that Dawnstar approached and sat down on the couch next to her.

They didn’t speak for nearly five minutes. It was a scared, but comfortable silence.

Kara reached over and grabbed Dawnstar’s hand.

“What are we going to do?” asked Kara.

“We will fight until one side dies out,” Dawnstar replied. “We have four people, all of us will likely die in this upcoming fight, but we will fight. If we only kill one of them, then the rest of this world will have an easier time fighting off the other. We must not give them an inch.”

“Right,” said Kara. “I guess I just don’t like the idea of dying.”

“Neither do I,” Dawnstar said. “Not before I have killed Reign.”

“I’m sure I could get my mother to help,” said Kara. Dawnstar scoffed and shook her head. “And… and maybe I could call on my cousin, Jon, he… He could help. He also knows a lot of people. Maybe he could bring some of the Justice Legion to help us…”

“Are you sure they would help you?” asked Dawnstar.

“That’s what they do. They help *everyone*,” Kara replied. “There are some members that could really help…” Kara stood up suddenly, letting go of Dawnstar’s hand. “I’ll go call him!” she said, rushing out of the room.

Dawnstar sat, alone. She shut her eyes. She prayed to the spirits over Starhaven. She received no response. She would have to place her hope in herself, and in Kara. There was nothing else she could do until the Worldkillers arrived.

1q6yq4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1q6yq4t/aitah_for_calling_my_kind_of_friend_fat_and/,AITAH for calling my [kind of] friend fat and telling her to grow up?,"okay so beforehand english isn't my first language so excuse any mistakes I make.

a while back  back I F17 [at the time even younger] met this girl F22 at a workshop her cousin had dragged her to.
lets call her marge.
she was visibly bored n so I decided to sit w her as noone else did and i felt that was kinda mean . [yes not even her cousin lol]

this may be a little relevant I guess but she's a bigger girl 120+kg

i noticed as wed hang out more shed always ask me to pay for stuff, her food, her snacks, her drinks etc. even at time she knew i wasnt qorking and a broke teenager but i was like okay whatever its okay. she wasnt working either she was somewhow still in highschool she had to repeat some grades. there was one instance where i was genouenly VERY broke n me in her along w another group of girls went to eat. i only had enough money for my food which she knew but as we enter the restaurant she says ""hey i didnt bring any money could u pay for me? ill pay u back"" i figured its whatever ill eat at home n daid sure. she goes on to order the biggest pizza available w extra toppings making it kinda expensive. i was panickikg cuz i disnt even bring that much money so i tranferred some from my savings acc to my regular acc. i sat w her while she ate n that was that. she never paid me baxk but at the time i was a very shy and non confrontational person so i let always let it go when these things happened.

one day as we were out  topic of fitness came up, I'm a big gym and martial arts fan so when she mentioned wanting to get into shape I told her I'd gladly support her n help her along the way, in no way did i pfessure her it was more so like ""look if u wanna do this im w u n Im gonna help u along the way if thats what u want""

the next week i texted her if shed already made her gym subscription to which she said yes. I was actually excited to help her along the way and have someone to train with.
and the next weeks shed never show up to our appointed training times. so one day i asked hey is everythinf okay like why arent u showin uo are u lacking motivation or do u need smth? 

she said ""oh acc i didnt make the subscription i dont have the money i was hoping you coulf maybe pay for it?"" 

i kindly told her i couldnt and that i couldn't because i barely had enogh money to pay for mine. she got very offended n said smth along the lines of
 ""no ur not broke u just dont wanna pay so i stay fat and youre the good looking one""

i was geniunely SHOCKED n was like excuse me? tf? girl i supported u in every way also btw i had hooked her up w a discount fir her first couple months at the gym. so that was fhe first time i gen got pissed at her. i said
 ""look ive paid for all ur shit so far and I'm the one that's a broke teen ur a grown woman so don't make me look like a bad person now.""

we didn't talk for a while but she ended uo coming back and apologising.

then one day while I'm at home I get a message from someone I don't know. so I asked who's this? it was a guy from her class. [whos abt my age just a year older since she had repeated grades more than once n she was the oldest]

lets call him Mark. i asked mark where he got my contact info n he told me from Marge. i asked why she would give it to him? he then told me that shed showed pictures of me to the guys in her class asking who was more attractive out of us 2 n that most said me and she started talking shit sbt me saying stuff that wasnt even true like that I had slept w alot of people or that i act line a slut n im arrogant n selfish. mind u, I have nevrr met anyone from her class let alone school shes talkin shit abt me n showing pics of me to absoloute strangers. 

i wasn't sure wether to believe mark at first and we wnded up meeting up. he then pulled put a video of her sayin those things and showing me around. I was disgusted. we talked some more I thanked him n went home to text marge to ask if she wanted to go for coffee. 

we met the next day and I confronted her.
I told her it was ridiculous how pathetic and insecure she has to be to bring a girl down that's significantly younger than her who's supported her n was kind even when she was acting like a free loader. 

she ended up yelling at me in this public cafe saying its my fault and bringing uo the gym subscription thing. she said that if I didn't want her ti be insecure and feel fat and ugly I should have paid for her training.

that was my last straw n I blew uo at her telling her that she's a grown woman who sucks off others like a leech with no sense of responsibility and that her being obese isn't my fault but hers for stuffing herself w food like a pig. and that she needs to grow up and stop acting like she's other people's responsibility.


she started crying and cursed at me before leaving. she told everyone around us what a horrible person I am and that I'm bodyshaming her and that I'm  a fake friend. 


I had multiple people tell me to apologise and that I was too harsh. 

I don't agree n have no sense of empathy for her anymore. I cut her and all the people that believed her and called me a bad person off but I still want an outer perspective.

so am I the asshole?

​It lived a long, productive life, but as we get into 2026, a ""click"" is officially a vanity metric. If you’re still optimizing for the click, you’re optimizing for a ghost.

​While a lot of the industry is still recycling 2025 playbooks, I’m officially burying these three tactics in the Performance Marketing Graveyard:

1. ​The ""Set it and Forget it"" Campaign. The algorithm is faster than my morning coffee now. If you aren't feeding it fresh, high-velocity creative, your ROAS isn't just sleeping—it’s dead.

2. ​Third-Party Cookie Reliance. We’ve talked about it for years, but 2025 was the final nail. If your attribution model doesn't involve first-party data and server-side tracking, you’re basically fly-fishing in the dark.

3. ​The Linear Funnel. The ""Ad -> Landing Page -> Purchase"" path has been replaced by a chaotic web of AI-search, Reddit threads, and dark social. If you aren't tracking the influence outside the direct path, you’re missing at least 50% of the story.

​The Good News?
Where there is a graveyard, there is new life. 2026 belongs to the marketers who focus on Profit over ROAS, Community over Clicks, and Creative over Code.

1q6yjxi,https://i.redd.it/fzzmp8st51cg1.jpeg,Vertuo Pop+ leaking into pod bin with refilled pods (but my Round Head doesn't!),"I currently own four Nespresso machines: one Original, one Vertuo (Round Head), and I recently added two Vertuo Pop+ machines (one for home, one for the office).

I’m an iced coffee drinker, so I was really enticed by the cold brew and carafe selections on the Pop+. Since I drink about 40oz of coffee a day, I often switch to decaf later in the day. Having more decaf bean options is important to me because I’m not a huge fan of the Nespresso brand decaf pods.

The Problem:
With my old Vertuo Round Head, I used to refill my pods all the time and never had an issue. However, with both of my new Vertuo Pop+ machines, water leaks into the pod bin whenever I use a refilled pod.
I usually use the aluminum foil seals because I like to prep a whole week’s worth at a time. I also have the silicone lids, though I’ve only tried them once and didn't check for leaks at the time. With the aluminum foils, both Pop+ machines literally leak every single time.

Key Observations:
-Both Pop+ machines brew perfectly with brand-new, official pods.
-Both leak with refilled pods regardless of the pod size.
-The ""crema"" (foam) on official pods is excellent, but on my refills, there is almost none.
-My old Vertuo Round Head handles these exact same refilled pods with zero leaks.

My Questions:
Is this a software thing? Are the newer machines programmed to detect if a barcode has already been scanned to prevent reusing them? Or is the piercing/sealing mechanism on the Pop+ just different from the older Round Head?

Between drinking water/electrolyte mix, dinner, tea, breakfast, and coffee, you can go through a lot!

But camping near water means you're usually camping at a low point, down in a drainage. While good views can still be found they are limited. What finally clicked in my brain was this: you don't have to eat at camp. Instead you can stop at your water source, rest, cook dinner, then camel up and hike to your preferred campsite for evening. In the morning, you can pack up and hit the trail, hike to your next water source, and have breakfast and coffee there. I found that last step often wasn't necessary, but realizing that I didn't need to eat breakfast and dinner at the same place I slept was like a revelation to me, and the views/sunsets I was rewarded with were INSANE. Not to mention, you're far less likely to be near others, if you're in search of solitude or are stressed about finding a campsite for yourself. 

This mentality can also reduce environmental impact (less feces concentrated in one area). And it can set your daily itinerary free. So often, the length of our day on the CT is determined by the fact that we want to camp near a significant water source. In those early days, everyone is camping in the same places. Not needing to camp near water let's you hike your hike. 

I assume we're all out there to soak in the beauty, and I for one now PREFER dry camping if the payoff is a view. ",19,1767836401.0,coloradotrail,7,0.92,False

I will be in Athens from 16 till 18. January and I kindly ask you for help. Of course I can google a lot but to be honest it is more effective to ask you living in town. There is several interests and I very much appreciate if you can help:

1 Magic show, Variete, Circus

  I love all these things. Is there any advice that you know I could visit a show in these days. Moreover I would lot mind to see a theatre play that is in greek language if it is visual. For example it is always funny to see these theatre plays where (as an example) three couple check in in a hotel and then the one husband finds out that the other wife of the second couple is his ex girlfriend and bla bla..do you understand what i mean?;)

  
2. Espresso 

I love Espresso and I love quality. I know that you can find very good places in Athens, for me TAF is nice but too much nose up with the attitude of someone ""we do operations at the open heart"" as ""Foyer Espresso Bar"" is wonderful, more alternative and in a nice area/set up. Which place do you recommend?

  
3. Food

  
I love food and i do eat meat and vegetarian but actually less meat is better. What are the non touristic places without photos on the not in english written menus that you would send me to?

  
Btw, if you have questions about Hamburg or Frankfurt feel free to ask.

I’m an espresso machine technician and frequently do repairs / maintenance after hours to not have machines down during business hours. I am very used to being alone in a dark coffee shop till 10pm and am quite a fan of it. 

Tonight I was working at a local mom/pop joint and as I was wrapping up I heard the back door open with some keys and some foot steps. I was a little startled but managers and owners will sometimes walk in so totally normal. The door closed and a girl, about my age (23), walked around the corner and into the kitchen. She had straight dirty blonde hair, a Patagonia looking sweater thing, and overall looked very normal. As she walked past she smiled kindly and said “excuse me I’ll be just a second” and went into the kitchen. That was it. I continued cleaning up my mess until I was done. By the time I was done, she had (supposed to) been in kitchen for like 10 minutes. I went back there to check and nothing. No one was there. I know for a fact that she did not walk back out because I was hyper aware of our silence. I also know I didn’t hear a door and there isn’t a door in the kitchen. Furthermore I left through the door she came in and it was still unlocked (I locked the damn thing). 

I texted the coffee shop owner to kindly tell them their machine is good and ask if a manager came by or anything. I’m hoping they say yes but I’m so confused. So fucking wild I don’t know what to make of it. ",33,1767836233.0,barista,12,0.9,False

By “we,” I mean those of us who have a conscious and soul but who are also close to the breaking point when it comes to existing in this capitalist hell hole.

Optional additional context: 

The idea of investigating every donation center, who backs it, & how much their CEO makes is so lovely and smart and ideal but unrealistic. I’m a husk of a human just trying to use the last handful of fox I have left to make sure this random (clean, useful) crap I accumulated doesn’t further encourage or line the pockets of the carpet glue in the wine cellar of the 8th yacht of the fat greasy tiny-🍆 white men who run literally everything in this county. 

I have enough energy and dopamine to do one of the following:
1. Burn all this stuff so as to save a little on my heating bill while exposing me and my cats to a bajillion microplastics and chemicals
2. Leave this pile of stuff in my living room or car until the next wildfire burns it down or someone breaks in and robs me again
3. Drive up to 12 minutes and place these things in a donation bin. 

I despise the corporate machine that is Goodwill & Salvation Army bc of how much their execs make compared to their workforce. They are the definition of criminal exploitation and can truly suck thy cl🤡. (Think Stephen King’s IT)

Greenwood Wildlife place on Arapahoe is SO overpriced that it makes me not want to support them. I love wildlife. I love reusing and repurposing. I love supporting small businesses. But I despise a company getting stuff for free and then marking up their prices to such a ridiculous extent that only the plastic-face millionaires who identify as edgy consignment influensters can afford to buy a pair of period-stained Banana Republic pants from 2004.

The Humane society place (also on Arapahoe) went out of business a couple years ago, I think?

Apocalypse, Rags, Plato’s Closet only want plastic (polyester) clothes bought new in the past year. And IF they buy something made of actual fabric, say a “vintage” wool sweater you got from your aunt in the 90s, they will offer you $2.12 and then price it at $29. To which I say, go fkyaselves.

And yeah, I belong to “free stuff” groups on FaceFughk Marketplace, but I’m an overly-stimulated, burnt out (economy, labor, student loans, not marihuana) elder millennial who is so sick of screens and faux hippie Boomers acting like entitled buttheads just because they know how to use the internet that if I have to spend another 20 minutes of my life on these “social platforms” getting voluntarily jizzed on by ads for worthless products that “optimize” on my anxiety about getting old or not being sexy enough to the American PDFlL “man” who wants me to look and act like I’m 12 years old, and 14 Nancys asking if this used/working coffee grinder is in “semi” vs “somewhat” decent condition, I might actually contaminate Boulder Creek by throwing every screen I have in there during my next 15-minute “lunch break.” 🤖

So anyway, where are we (ethically) donating these days? 

Do you even have the time/capacity to care about ethically donating? 

Are you also considering burning your donations to offset the cost of your heating bill?

And why is it this hard to donate useful goods to those in need without being worried you’re accidentally supporting BlackRock?

Shouldn’t it be kinda easy? To give your useful stuff away? For free?

And did the Reagan-era voters really think they could just create this world and everything would be cool? (And if so, I hope they’re rotting away wilting-dragon style, in a BlackRock-owned facility with their little hoard of gold).

And are you a lower-middle-class white woman from the Midwest raised catholic with excessive unearned guilt who was taught to normalize over-thinking your every decision and its implications? 

Did you celebrate your “escape” to Colorful Colorado a decade ago but can barely afford to live, much less date, take care of yourself, or indulge in a $40 pedicure once a year? Here or in the Midwest?

Thanks for any input (or reparation payments, Boomers)!

I took up kickboxing about 10 months ago.  Ive lost about 30lbs, completed a fight and have a newfound sense of confidence.  I should say had a newfound sense of confidence that has now been shaken.  It turns out I created the perfect storm for Rhabdo.  I did an extreme core workout where I pushed my muscles to failure and beyond combined with excessive coffee, dehydration and little to eat.  The next day I sparred for 3 hours.  After that session is when I began to feel something was wrong.  The muscles that controlled raising my legs became so sore and tired I could barely put my shoes back on and had trouble standing up straight.  Later that night right before I was going to bed I noticed my urine was bright pink.  I thought I had been injured from a particularly effective kick I took earlier that day and dragged myself to the emergency room at 2am.

After running some tests that's when they confirmed I had actually not suffered an injury in the traditional sense but had given myself rhabdo.  My CK levels were above the cut off of their tests at 42k and I was admitted.  Day by day my CK levels dropped but it was very difficult to not know when I was going to be able to go home. I went from 42k+ to 40k, 33k, 20k and now finally 7.5k today which is what I was released at.  I am now at home resting, drinking copious fluids and praying that my urine stays a normal color.  I am following up to get more blood work done on Friday, hopefully it shows continued recovery.

I already have anxiety issues which is part of the reason I pushed myself so hard.  If I wear myself out I feel much more at peace.  Now I am stuck at home not knowing if I am continuing to improve or not.  I dont know when I will be able to continue with my passion and get back up to full strength.  Im afraid that I will be permanently impacted and possibly even have to quit kick boxing altogether.  I take some comfort in the amount of stupidity and multiple factors that led up to this happening.  It makes me feel that, hopefully, as long as I prepare adequately in the future this will not happen again.  

I dont necessarily have any important questions.  I just had to share to get this off my chest as there are not many people that understand what Ive been experiencing.",3,1767836075.0,rhabdo_survivors,0,1.0,False

Ethereum is up 9%, Pepe is up 56% on the week, Doge is up 20%, Shib is up 25% and many others are up heavily as well.

So, what could happen next?

Honestly idk, but it could be the start of a larger rise and some sort of alt season which has been predicted for months and months now.

For the best gains, you kinda wanna get in now, the bottom looks to already have been in and Up season is potentially here.

No matter what the market does though, you wanna invest in solid projects, not flimsy ones relying on a KOL or some sort of viral meme, but instead a real community.

This is why I suggest **Kendu.**

Over 20 IRL projects such as spices, merch, coffee... and with a community solid enough to rival 2021 Shib. This is no exaggeration, we absolutely dominate Reddit and Stocktwits, with also a heavy presence on X. X is harder to measure but we trend frequently!

We are also the 2nd coin to ever manage 50k Certik Votes with the only other coin being Pepe...

Certik is the most reputable auditor for blockchain technology and they rate Kendu's community at 94, whilst SPX has a score of 88 and Pepe has a score of 91. Imagine the community strength Kendu will have when we even have remotely near their number of holders... it will be immeasurable.

Obvs do your research, but should give it a shot, whether you skip the daily Starbucks or weekly Dominos to add a DCA, it could pay off very handsomely.

Released August 3rd, 2018 under G.O.O.D. Music

  
The first Mike solo album to actually center around a purely original creative concept and not just be a random collection of songs. ASTROWORLD‘s creative vision had its roots all the way back in early 2016, even before the failed “solo album battle“ he had with Chester. But was, like One More Light, delayed by a year so Mike could focus on helping Chester through some personal struggles.



ASTROWORLD had the largest and most diverse group of features and producers of any system project to date. And G.O.O.D. Music was CONVINCED it would be the most successful project they’d ever put out since Kanye’s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasty. Kanye himself even lent him his old private studio in Honolulu. Though it didn’t QUITE reach MBDTF level, it was still widely acclaimed as the best album Mike had ever made, or had ever been involved in making.

  
Tracklist:

1. STARGAZING 

2. CAROUSEL (feat. Frank Ocean)

3. SICKO MODE (feat. Drake)

4. R.I.P. Screw (feat. Swae Lee)

5. STOP TRYING TO BE GOD (feat. Kid Cudi, Phillip Bailey, James Blake & Stevie Wonder)

6. NO BYSTANDERS (feat. Juice WRLD & Sheck Wes)

7. SKELETONS (feat. Tame Impala, The Weeknd & Pharrell Williams)

8. WAKE UP (feat. The Weeknd)

9. 5% TINT

10. NC-17 (feat. 21 Savage)

11. ASTROTHUNDER

13. CAN’T SAY (feat. Don Toliver)

14. WHO? WHAT! (feat. Migos)

15. BUTTERFLY EFFECT 

16. WINNIFORNICATION\*

17. COFFEE BEAN

  
\*The IRL title for track 16 is HOUSTONFORNICATION. But I changed it because it’s my headcanon that Mike was born in Winnipeg, the capital of Manitoba. (The province)

Sharing this as a constructive rant and also a PSA. I’m legit trying to understand whether this is an isolated case or something others here have experienced with Samsung Canada, especially for high-demand Galaxy Watch models. The whole saga feels like a sitcom episode I didn’t sign up for.

[All $ are in CAD]

Part 1 — The “too good to be true” era (early December):

I ordered a Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 (Titanium Silver) through Samsung Canada using my company’s Partner Program via Venngo. I’ve used Venngo before with zero drama. (S23 Ultra with 300$ discount over the already discounted phone through Partner Program + free Galaxy Buds2 Pro in 2023. Both of which I rock till date. Chef’s kiss).

Samsung’s site then casually offered me $200 ""promotional"" trade-in for my old Galaxy Watch Active2. 
My brain said, “That’s suspicious.” My mouse said, “Add to cart.”
Order went through. Trade-in applied. Payment processed. 
Final price? ~$330 for the Ultra + two bands.  Peakform (dark grey) and Trail Band (blue). 
I briefly considered buying a lottery ticket.

A few days later… Order Cancelled, full refund, no real explanation. After calling support, I’m told:
- There’s actually no stock
- The trade-in promo was a website error
- They’re “actively fixing the page”

Fair. I had already emotionally prepared myself for this outcome. I move on.

*

Part 2 — Fool me twice (Dec 22 → Jan 7):

On Dec 22, Samsung’s Partner Program site shows the watch back in stock, so I reorder — no trade-in this time, just straight purchase.
Total: $560 for the watch + two bands. 
Still a solid deal. Estimated delivery: Dec 29.

Dec 29 arrives. 
Order status stuck at “Order Preparation"" on Samsung Shop app.
I assume holidays, elves on vacation, supply chain gremlins — had anticipated this, no big deal.
I call on Dec 30, just to ensure my assumptions were right. 
I’m told: “Inventory shortage, but don’t worry — someone will contact you in 48 hours.”
You guessed it. They did not. I give them some time.
I call on Jan 5 yet again. Same script. Same 48-hour promise. Same silence.

Then today, Jan 7, Samsung Canada goes full plot twist:
Second order cancelled, refunded, inbox flooded with emails, with all sorts of explanations.
One message is from a Samsung Specialist, Samsung Electronics Canada, says (paraphrasing here):
“Yeah, we don’t actually have this watch or the Peakform band. Also it’s no longer available. So we cancelled your order.”
To soften the blow, Samsung offers me a $25 voucher. 
Which is nice. Symbolic. Almost performance art.

*

On a serious note on why I'm here (and mildly losing my mind):

- Why accept orders and take payment… twice… if there’s no stock?
- Why promise follow-ups that never happen?
- Why let me miss other holiday deals while my money sits in Samsung limbo?
- And in what universe does $25 fix this experience?

I like Samsung. I own Samsung stuff. 
I wasn’t trying to exploit anything. 
I just wanted to buy a watch that your website insisted was available and offered great deals.

So… has this happened to anyone else?
1) Repeated order cancellations?
Galaxy Watch Ultra specifically?
2) Did escalation actually help, or is this just how it goes?
3) Did anyone get better compensation than a coffee-money voucher?

At this point I’m mostly curious whether I’m uniquely unlucky or if Samsung Canada’s inventory system is just vibing on its own wavelength.
Appreciate any insight, war stories, or advice.

1q6y9qp,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1q6y9qp/aita_for_feeling_manipulated_in_my_relationship/,AITA for feeling manipulated in my relationship?,"I’m 26F and my boyfriend is 56M. I’ve been in a relationship where I feel emotionally unsafe, exhausted, and unappreciated, and honestly, I feel like I’m going insane. I think my boyfriend is emotionally manipulating me, but I can’t figure out if he’s doing it on purpose. Everything he does for me or provides for me comes with strings attached, and all of my emotions end up getting used against me.

For example, last year we were struggling financially and doing DoorDash every day to make ends meet. The only pair of shoes I had was a pair of Uggs, which got ruined during that time because we couldn’t afford replacements. He promised me that the following winter he would buy me a new pair. When the next year came, he actually followed through with the promise, which wasn’t typical of him, but I was very thankful. He took me to the Ugg store, let me pick out a pair of boots, and even insisted I get a pair of slippers. I was really surprised and appreciative. At the time, he made comments about how happy he was to make up for my ruined shoes, and I felt genuinely valued.

Then my birthday came, which has always been a sensitive subject because it’s never been celebrated well. That year, he promised to put effort into making it special and even said I would have a “birthday week,” which excited me. When the week came, nothing was done to celebrate, but a few days later he offered to buy me an iPad and an Apple Pencil that were on sale for my birthday. I accepted and was grateful, and I’ve used the iPad for lots of things, including helping him with billing for his law office. I thought maybe he was finally trying to make my birthdays feel important.

However, he recently used these gifts against me. During a conversation about finances and me trying to find a job, he said, “You would have service on your phone if you didn’t have your iPad, Apple Pencil, or your Uggs. Just look at your feet.” He knows how much these things mean to me, and it made me feel guilty, manipulated, and like I’m constantly being evaluated based on gifts he gave me rather than my worth.

Every day, I do a lot for him. I help with his law business, handle his billing, take care of the house, cook all the meals, make his coffee, do his laundry, and make sure everything he needs is taken care of, even small things like arranging his shower loofah for him. I recently realized that I do all of this hoping for appreciation and attention, but I rarely get either. Meanwhile, things that are important to me, like birthdays or other special occasions, are often neglected or dismissed with excuses about money, even though we could plan and save.

I have really bad PTSD and every single time I sleep, I have nightmares. When I wake up, I’m very dysregulated and cranky, and I need time to get myself back into the right headspace. I told him I needed this time in the morning, and I even started waking up at 5 AM to make sure I could have that time for myself. As soon as I did that, he also started waking up at that time, which took away the space I was trying to create. Even when I try to have quiet time in the morning, he will spend the entire time talking about my stalker situation in ways that aren’t necessary, even though he knows why I struggle in the mornings.

He also knows I have abandonment issues and uses them against me during fights. He often leaves or reminds me that I don’t have anybody else in my life. At this point, I actually need him to leave when he’s angry because I’m increasingly scared of him. There have been more threatening situations in the past. He has recklessly driven over 100 mph while I was in the car, and once he even threatened to drive me off a cliff when he was angry. I don’t feel safe in the car with him anymore, which makes DoorDash with him extremely stressful because I never know when he’ll be angry or threaten me with the car.

I’ve been trying to find a job for over a year, but I live in a small town and we’ve had to move multiple times due to a traumatic situation involving my stalker brother. Stable work hasn’t been possible, especially in entry-level positions. Despite this, I’ve been making an effort, but he often turns my struggles into a way to criticize me, sometimes immediately, sometimes weeks later.

Recently, I’ve expressed my unhappiness and struggles with mental health, including PTSD and depression. He initially responded with affection, but soon after began starting fights, physically pushing me a few times, and making everything about him. He’s told me he can’t handle the relationship anymore and implies that I’ll never change, even though much of the stress in our relationship comes from his manipulative and controlling behavior.

My therapist has said he displays narcissistic tendencies and that this could definitely be considered an abusive relationship. I’m trying to figure out what I need to do, but I want to match my perspective because I tend to keep these things to myself.

AITA for feeling like he might be intentionally manipulating me?

But none of it quieted the ache in her chest or the strange, lingering feeling that the story wasn’t really over.



Somewhere in the back of her mind, she remembered something her best friend had mentioned a few months earlier. A psychic—not the kind with neon signs or smoke and mirrors. No costumes. No drama. Just someone with a reputation for being… unsettlingly accurate.



She wasn’t even sure why she walked into that small, unmarked shop tucked between a tea house and an old bookstore. The air inside smelled faintly of sage and something older, sweet, floral, but masculine...something she couldn’t name. He looked up from his seat with blue, quiet eyes, and a calm presence. He looked to be in his late forties or early fifties. When he stood, he was unexpectedly tall. However, he didn’t speak like a mystic. He spoke like someone who had already seen the ending of your story—and wasn’t in a rush to tell you. She felt immediately at ease, although she wasn't sure why because she was always on guard around strangers.



“I’m not here for magic or to try and win someone back,” Mia said quickly, her voice more brittle than she intended. “I just want to understand why it hurts so much. Why it ended the way it did. And why I can’t shake the feeling that it’s not really over.” She could hear a little hostility in her voice. She realized she was a little afraid of what this man might say.



He nodded once. “Let’s see what the cards say.”



He laid them out in slow, deliberate movements. The Lovers, reversed. The Moon. The Star. Then he opened her birth chart, tracing the angles and alignments as if he were reading a language she’d never learned but somehow understood.



What followed wasn’t some grand prophecy. He didn’t promise that Daniel would return or that everything would magically be okay. What he gave her was something else entirely—clarity.



He spoke of emotional timing, soul contracts, and the unspoken patterns both she and Daniel were trapped in. He revealed how her current heartbreak was echoing something deeper, older, unhealed. He offered quiet insight, a gentle truth that felt both unsettling and comforting. And then he gave her a remedy—small, subtle, powerful. Not to fix Daniel. To reconnect Mia with herself.



That night, she slept.



Three days later, Daniel texted. Not a casual “hey.” A real message. Honest. Conflicted. Vulnerable.



They met for coffee. Not for closure. For understanding. The air between them was different—stripped of ego, heavy with truth.



They didn’t fall back into old patterns. They talked. Really talked. And from the wreckage of what they were, something new began to form.

I’ve found similar tables to the one I purchased but none styled. Just listing pictures of them being sold with no chairs/no decor. Here is what it looks like. Now where I’m stumped is CHAIRS ! I want chairs that don’t “block” the swans. And preferably NOT ghost chairs. So please help! I’m looking for dreamy girly kinda vintage but modern romantic vibes.

1q6y77v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1q6y77v/grown_adult_struggling_with_being_left_behind_by/,Grown adult Struggling with being left behind by expat parents and unsure how to face / tackle it,"Hey, 

I thought I’d reach out here, because there are plenty of posts on Reddit about Expats feeling guilt about leaving people behind or traumatic events that tear families apart or families far apart with bad relationships, but I don’t fall into any of those brackets. 

My reality is a lot more ordinary than that. My parents have always wanted to retire and move abroad, they finally achieved that in 2018. There was never any serious consideration for me to go with them, because I am a grown man, and at the time, my life and career was in a good place. And I guess being honest with you, I never really stopped to think how different my life would feel, when my parents were no longer around the corner who I could pop in to see at any time. 

I also wonder if Covid had never happened, maybe I would be in a very different position, but Covid also really sent my life off course in a lot of ways, and a lot of the reasons for why staying behind for me was the right choice at the time, now mostly no longer apply. 

Covid really isolated me in a lot of ways and made me realise my parents are my only true support network, and yet they are basically barely a part of my life any more and haven’t been for years. We exist in effectively two different universes, each year I get a brief window into theirs, but they are out living dream and my life is going nowhere. 

Because of the nature of my job, and the expense of it, I can usually only get out to see them once a year. I try and make a thing out of it, have a good few weeks here. But a few weeks once a year, versus going to see them multiple times every week, even if just for an hour, as I once did, well it doesn’t quite balance. I miss an impromptu text to go for a coffee, or to go see a movie or whatever else it may be.   

I did hope once Covid was over, my parents would make more of an effort to come see me, so it wasn’t reliant on me making the effort every year, but that hasn’t really materialised and I don’t blame them, they chose to leave this place behind for a reason but the couple of years where they have made a couple of short trips back over here did really help offset a lot these feelings, as there wasn’t this 10+ stretch where we existed in different worlds. 

I have looked to see if I can move to join them, but I just can’t get the logistics down, mostly financially. I’m still pursuing this, and really I think I am pursuing more emotional advice than financial advice. 

Mostly because I am also becoming increasingly aware with each trip that I am effectively skipping ahead a year with my parents every time. I’m not young anymore, and neither are my parents, I don’t know how many more of these year ahead skips I really have left and I am not sure I am ready to face the overwhelming loneliness when the last year skip comes, and the realisation that with each trip I get closer to that reality.

Last year, one of our family Dog’s died, they took her abroad with them when they left, and it hurt in a lot of ways, but especially so because it was one of the last remaining bridges between their life now and the one before I was apart of. The realisation I am a guest, a stranger, in their new life, who passes through once a year. 

I have tried to talk to them about it, but I sort of regret it now after reading all those Reddit posts about Expats dealing with immense grief and depression about leaving people behind. I don’t want them to feel guilty about living their dream, and I don’t believe any malicious intent behind what they did, at the time they left I was living my life and they were happy I was well set up, no one could have seen Covid coming. 

I’d just really love to hear of other people in my situation, how you process and deal with it. Cause I am not sure if I am sad, or angry, if I feel abandoned, regret, jealousy, or what I am even feeling and just don’t know what to do about it. Were there any groups of people you found helpful talking to, were there any practical things you did to process all this, I’d take anything.",1,1767835646.0,Advice,0,0.67,False

Every morning, I used to wake up and used to do routine work - make coffee, water plants, go for a run/gym/yoga, while she used to be asleep by the time I used to return. Today morning, moments ago, when I was fixing my bed and blanket, I just realised the absence of my wife. She was lying here 44 days ago and today her side is empty. I mean 44 days doesn't feel like a long time ago. It's like she's out to visit her parents and maybe in 6 more days she'll be with me. Her's side of our bed should not have been empty this soon. She was only 29 and I was 30. I miss waking up next to her. 


For the past 44 days, it was sleeping without her that used to hurt me the most. Today, for the first time, it's waking up without her that gave me a realisation. I'll still make coffee, go for a run, leave for work, but illl never be coming back to her in this excruciating survival which I call my life now. ",10,1767835510.0,widowers,2,1.0,False

1q6y4wx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q6y4wx,Coach Coffee Shop Haul,"My coach coffee shop review:
The pouch: INCREDIBLE quality. Shocking they only charge $45 for this. I think it’s the best thing in the collection I purchased. A nice size with a great feel to her. Zipper is excellent.

The tote: stiff with small arm handles. I can’t just throw it on my shoulder. Hopefully it will soften in time, but feeling wonky right now. Not sure if I will keep.

Left keychain: extra pics attached. Incredible quality. Has a proper amount of weight to it. Looks adorable! Brass shiny hardware. The shoes are everything!

Right keychain: classic lil miss Joe. Also extremely well made with good weight to her. I posted a pic of her hardware next to the other keychain.

Overall I think I’d recommend everything but the tote :) if you are going to get one thing, do the pouch!!! I ordered this via text from the Jersey shore outlet if anyone else is interested!
