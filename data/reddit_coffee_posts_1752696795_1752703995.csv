The girl at the front counter was super friendly and bubbly, and the two of us were chatting quite a bit, but I recognized that I was distracting her from her job because she had other patrons coming in. I didn’t want to distract her any further, but I also  thought she was really nice and it could be fun to talk with her more potentially, so I asked for a piece of paper and gave her my Instagram. Normally, I don’t make friends easily since I’m Autistic/ADHD. I also had a huge falling out with a lot of of my friend group last year, and things with them have been tense. (I was the victim of a smear campaign). I have never done anything like this before and I told my husband excitedly, but he seems to think that it was a very weird thing for me to do and that it might have creeped this girl out. 

Thinking about it now, I feel like maybe she was just trying to be professional with me, but I also am hoping she is looking for friends too.

In Trawler’s Cove, no one dares to speak about Mummering in this small town.



It's a light hearted tradition in Newfoundland that starts in December, a way to connect with others during the long and cold winter. Folk would dress up in all kinds of strange and silly ways to hide who they are when going house to house to those they knew. Old lace curtains, bras worn over coats, tea cozies on their hands, many different ways to hide who you are just for those you visit to try and fool friends and family. It was a good way to come together and share a few drinks with each other.



That's how it’s supposed to be anyway, but not here.



Not in Trawler’s Cove.



Here, Mummering is banned and frowned upon for even talking about it. We don’t even celebrate Halloween from fear of the costumes that are used. Anyone catches you wearing any sort of costume and you would be dragged away before you even get your boots untied.



The ban had been in place for so long now that not a single person remembers when it really started, but why the ban was made was very clear.



Every ten years the town of Trawler’s Cove gets consumed by a fog that runs in from the shoreline.



You can see it coming in from the distance, thick as wool and heavy as rain, swallowing everything it touches as he creeps its way over the town. There are always signs of it coming in far before then, the way the sea goes quiet and how every gull in the town seems to vanish before the fog is spotted. It’s like a scene from a horror movie every time it comes.



Trawler’s Cove lets out loud sirens to warn those unaware of its approach, sirens that are so loud that standing near them would physically hurt you if you stayed there for too long. Shops shut down, schools close up, every house gets filled with folk all around even if they didn’t live there. It was to risky to be out there the moment the fog weaves its way through every inch of the town.



The moment the fog settled in the silence is deafening when all you can do is wait



It is only then they show up.



I was only six years old the first time I saw them for the first time. I remember standing at the front window, nose nearly pressed against the glass as I watched the mist pour in before the figures started to show up, groups of six every time as group by group they started to walk down the road, each group going off into their own direction down the road we lived on.



They looked like traditional Mummer’s yet at the same time they also felt wrong, something about the way they moved or the piece of clothing they wore just did not look right the closer they got to the house. No two dressed the same as each and every one of them stood out from each other. The only detail that was the same among all of them were the white bedsheet like masks they all wore, wrapped tightly around their heads with big enough holes cut out from them to see where they were going with hats on top. The way they breathed under those masks made the sheets move in and out at a slow rate.



At the time I was too young to know any better. My six year old brain saw everyone outside all dressed up and wanted to join them, even tried to run out there to join one of the groups when mother caught me by the collar and yanked me back from the front door before quickly locking it.



She didn’t shout at me, she just kept me close to her side in the living room where the rest of my family was all gathered to, quiet and tense as we all watched the windows into the unknown world outside.



I don’t think I ever heard my parents be this quiet, even my older sister had gone completely quiet as she too watched what was going on outside.



The only sound that was made at that moment was the sound of an old Screech bottle my father had was placed on the coffee table with a small glass resting beside it yet he didn’t dare to take a drink from it, leaving it there only to join my mothers side to comfort her as she watched in horror.



I didn’t understand why, not then at least.



But now I do.



I could tell my father was scared from the way his hand shook beside him, his eyes locked on to the window looking outside, everyone was scared. Even my sister was scared, the same person who was never scared of thunderstorms that could rattle the house with each strike or face up against bullies who tried to torment me at school. Fear has a way of soaking into you even when you didn’t fully understand what you were supposed to be scared of.



It must have been maybe a half hour when the fog and Mummer’s arrived that my mother let out a sudden and painful scream while she was sitting near the window. She had watched one of the groups wander up to one of the neighbors' houses just down the road. She grabbed me and pulled me away from the window with such force I thought I was going to be thrown to the floor, but she pulled me in close to protect me from what was going on outside. I only caught a glimpse of what she had saw, the group of Mummer’s leaving the house, all of them dragging something behind them as they all came together and made their way back into the thick fog.



It was the neighbors, all five of them dead and bloodied as their limp and lifeless bodies were dragged out of the house and pulled behind the Mummer’s into the fog, leaving nothing but streaks of blood on the street behind them. I didn’t know they were bodies at first, my sister filled me in on some of the details since she too also spotted it happening.



She had nightmares for weeks before telling me this.



At the time it was unclear how many houses were visited by the Mummer’s, the ones who survived kept quiet, not wanting to speak ill of any of the families or the Mummer’s themselves with fear that they would be next with visitors in ten years, ten years they wanted to live in peace and maybe be gifted with a peaceful death before then. The ones who did speak up about it tend to differ in the count, six houses all the way up to seventeen. What was clear was how many of them survived from their visitors which was none of them, a few of them breaking one of the few rules of denying them entry into the house.



This angered the Mummer’s and would send them rushing into the house they were visiting and killing everyone inside with no mercy. You could hide if you wanted to, but no matter what crawlspace, false floor or tiny little spot you think you were safe in, they would know where you are and it never mattered in the end. They would find you and kill you like the rest of the family or even visitors in the house. Fighting them was even more useless, my father told me once about a family who took shots at one of the groups, grabbing his hunting rifle and letting it crack in the fog to fight them off. Not a drop of blood or anything, they just walked up to the house they needed to be and waited to be invited in.



""You can't be killin' what’s already gone, my love."" I remember my mother telling me once, one of the only few times she ever spoke about them which was a rarity from her.



The next time I saw the Mummer’s again I was sixteen and the sound of the town's alarm going off scared me. I was outside when it went off and I can still remember how my father ran out and grabbed, dragging me back inside. Like before it took a bit before the fog rolled in, thick as smoke as it swallowed up the whole place and only left us with a sliver of the road in front of the house or for us to see. It was the same as before, everyone in the house gathering up in the living room, my father grabbing that old bottle of Screech again and placing it on the coffee table.



What had changed this time was how scared we all were now, my sister and I knew more about this now and even I could feel a coil of fear building up inside of me, threatening to burst and make me cry from just standing there.



The only person at the time who was doing their best to keep themselves together was my father who was sitting with my mother, comforting her the best he could.



We all watched in silence, more quiet than that house could have ever been as we looked out the front living room window, our eyes scanning for those groups of six to come walking out into the open road until they finally did. They were slow but they walked with purpose, instruments in hand for some of them while others followed along like they were meant to.



We weren't sure of the first house they went to, it was right on the edge when we saw one of the groups splinter off and head off beyond what we could see, but one of the groups made their way to our neighbor, Violet and her husband Cyril who were an older couple and right away you could her Violet screaming and shouting at the Mummer’s who did not react to her. It wasn’t until she slammed the door closed that they suddenly shifted from calmly standing there to violently rushing into the house, screams from Violet and Cyril echoing out from the now wide open door and scaring all of us as well. The only thing we could see were silhouettes of the Mummer’s rushing past one of the windows with hands raised and dropped down on the couple. Just as soon as the violence started, it ended in silence.



It was only then you could hear the rhythm of footsteps going from pavement to wood, making their way up the front patio steps until they all shuffled to a stop near the front door. My father was the only one who stepped up to that front door, his hand shaking as he slowly turned the knob and opened it. All of them stood there facing my father blankly and it was only then I realized just how discolored they all were. The normal bright colors you would have expected to see from their costumes were slightly dimmed down, almost like wherever they were coming from was slowly taking it away from them, making them seem more grey and white.



My father stepped aside, inviting them in and my mother guided us to sit down as all of the Mummer’s stepped into the living room to the opposite side of us, dead eyes looking down at us. One of them looked to my father like he was projecting a silent message to him as my father zipped out of the room and returned with two folding chairs, two of them gently taking it from him and unfolding them to sit on before my father could even join us.



Having to stare down a group of people wearing mismatched clothing, white clothed masks with hats, bras and other random things would be a lot better to see if your life wasn’t on the line, but our lives were on the line.



I sat on the edge of the couch closest away from the living room window, my mother sat in the middle with my sister to the other side. My father sat near me in his own seat, a loud thump from the way he sat down like his legs gave out before he could sit down properly, or maybe he was internally giving up. We must have sat there for a good five minutes without a single one of us making a peep, eyes locking on to each other from across the room.



Four of them had instruments.



The first one had an old guitar, fairly normal yet looked older than myself with a slight warp in its form as the Mummer holding it held on to it gently. The second one had an accordion, a once vivid red now dulled down by whatever affected the Mummer’s as well, like the color had been slowly bleeding out of it since one of them picked it up.



Two others had more different styles of instruments I guess you could say, especially if you're not from Newfoundland. One had what you would call Dory Dan Spoons, two metal spoons back to back on one rod to slap against your hand or knee to the rhythm of whatever song you played. The other garnished what we call a Ugly Stick, a broom handle with nails sticking out the side of it that held bear bottle caps on to, a boot on the bottom and what was supposed to be a tin can or even wooden head on top was now replaced what looked like bone of some sort, maybe the cap of someone's skull. They would tap the ugly stick with one hand while the other had a small wooden stick to tap on it, letting off a rattle to it when used properly with a song.



The last two had nothing, they looked like they were just there for the fun but even I knew that could be right as I sat there looking at them. I could feel their eyes on us, greyed and unfocused as they went from each of us over and over again, almost familiar in a way. “Alright listen to me and listen to me carefully.” My father finally spoke up, shattering the silence between us all. “All we have to do is guess who one of them is, that's it! Guess one of them and they’ll leave.”



“How are we supposed to know who they are?” I remember asking my father, confused about the rules of this game.



“They used to be family, all of them. So think of family members, long gone family members.”



They truly were the dead coming out to test us.



They weren't just murderous Mummers, we were sharing a room with the dead coming back to test us, to make us remember who they were from how they moved to what they wore. It was all just some twisted and sickening game not to save our lives but to remind us of those we lost as well.



Before my father could explain anything else the accordion player started, a sudden and loud note that made us all jump in our seats as he held on to that note much longer than we thought before starting into playing a familiar song called: The Mummer’s Song.



One by one they all started to join in, even the two without instruments played along, clapping and stomping their feet on the floor to the rhythm of the song, yet there was something just wrong about the song itself. It was being played a touch off tune, enough to make it sound wrong and put us all on edge the more they played, but there was something to the song I didn’t think about until we really got into it.



It wasn’t just a performance.



It was a countdown.



My father never had the chance to tell us that they would only play the song three times, nothing more and nothing less. If we guessed one of them correctly they would stop and take their leave. But if we didn’t and the song ended, they would kill us.



They hit every note with an eerie precision yet it still remained off tune and wrong as my family panicked and started to guess, wild guesses from the top of their heads to try and get through this as fast as possible. “Him!” my Sister was the first to speak up, pointing to the man who was simply clapping to the song as her finger shook wildly. “That’s Pop Desmond! He knew this song by heart.”



The way he stared at my sister was like he was angered by the first wrong guess yet he didn’t stop to the rhythm of the song, they all played on.



She got it wrong.



“Aunt Bridget.” My mother spoke up next, pointing to the one playing the accordion. ""She was the only one in the family ever good at playing the accordion.”



Same as before they played on, tears streaking down my mothers face as she sat there on the couch with us. My father was trying to guess who some of them were, mumbling to himself as he looked back and forth between a few of them when the first song came to a sudden end, leaving it quiet there for only a moment before the accordion started that same long note again and right back into the song, faster than before yet even less out of tune.



I could see the blood leaving my fathers face as he stared at them, we were running out of time and he was caught up on some of the names in his head. “You have to be my great-grandfather Noa!” he shouted, nearly standing up as he pointed to the one with the ugly stick tapping on the floor.



I was frozen in place by all of this, sitting there with my heart racing as the one with the guitar was staring me down, one eye normal while the other was almost bloodshot, almost completely filled with old blood that nearly completely darkened his eye. There was something familiar about it but I just couldn’t put my finger on it.



“Jerome!” I remember my father barking at me finally, snapping me out of the moment to look at him with a mixture of anger yet pure fear in his face. “Guess Jerome, guess!”



I never heard him speak to me like that before until then, it scared me even more with thoughts that if I didn’t guess we would all be killed because of my lack of guessing. I had to guess but I couldn’t think of anyone that would hit any of them, any of them except for the guitar player who kept staring me down.



Name after name they tried yet over and over the Mummer’s seemed to reject the names, playing on as they ended the second song, more abrupt then before before starting back up again even faster, more twisted than the other two times. “Make it stop, make it stop!” I remember my mother crying out finally, a scream letting out from her as my sister broke down as well, pulling her into a final hug to keep her close before the end came to us.



My father kept firing with name after name, pointing to each of them until he finally stopped, looking at me with defeat before he pulled me into a hug, his arms wrapped around me as my eyes were still locked on to the guitar player. “I’m sorry…I'm so sorry Jerome.” He told me, choking on his words as he tried to talk to me. “I want to let you know I’m proud of you, I’ve always been proud of you. I-”



I was unfocused in the moment to hear the rest of what he was saying, my eyes locked on to the Mummer playing the guitar as he looked right back at me like he was trying to tell me who he was.



Beyond his single bloodshot eye he wore a pair of overalls with what I thought were grease or oil stains turned out to be small patches of dried up tar. It was thicker than most with what looked like small patches of blood with the color faded to it around the sides of them like he bled out from his back.



It pulled my mind back, a memory coming back to me that haunted me to this day. It was impossible yet this entire scenario was impossible as well as the name swirled up to my lips just before the song was about to end. “Uncle John?”



Every instrument came to a sudden halt the moment I spoke that name out loud, my father turning to look at the Mummer’s before letting me go, looking at me with some confusion to what I even said as his cheeks were soaked from the tears he had shed.



The Mummer with the guitar didn’t speak a word, instead he gently placed his guitar up against the wall before taking his hat off and pulling the cloth mask from his face, revealing the rugged face of my Uncle John beneath it. Seeing him even like this brought back that terrible memory of the day he died and yet I still blamed myself for it even if it wasn’t really my fault.



It was four years ago during the summer time. It was just my sister, Uncle John and myself at home that day when my Uncle was working on the roof to replace the shingles. Mom and dad were at work and it was a blistering hot day to be doing anything outside, yet he wanted to get it done since we had been pushing it off for so long. He was half way done when he asked me to throw him a bottle of water from the fridge and to this day I still think I threw it too hard.



I was on the front lawn when I threw it, tossing it with all I could up to him. I don’t know if it was the way he caught it, if he slipped or what it was, but when his hand reached out for it I remember him stumbling to catch himself before falling out of view behind the house with a loud thump. Running around to find him I screamed seeing him dead on the ground. My father told me he died instantly by smacking the back of his head on one of the few large rocks sticking out of the ground behind the house.



I blamed myself for years, I still blame myself honestly. Seeing him then it just stirred something up inside of me to go and hug him, to tell him just how sorry I was he died because of me, but my father wouldn’t let me, he couldn’t as he grabbed me and kept me there on the couch.



I watched as my Uncle stepped to the coffee table, pouring himself a glass of Screech before downing it in one go like it was nothing. He looked at me. Not with warmth, not with anger, just emptiness before slipping his mask and hat back on as he picked up his guitar and started to head to the front door, they all did.



One by one they all stepped out of the house and back onto the road, my father quickly getting up behind them to close and lock the door with a loud snap. We all pulled each other into one big hug, shaken from what we had endured only to escape it by the skin of our teeth. The only thing to reunion the moment was my sister gasping as she looked to the window, her eyes on the neighbors house as we watched the Mummer’s, now covered in splatters of blood, drag the old couple out of the house by their feet and on to the road with the Mummer’s.



They dragged them out, streaks of blood on the road until they were out of sight and deep into the fog once again. Just like that, they were gone as the fog started to pull back from the town once again.



Ten years passed when they came again and that was my tipping point after I found out my sister was at one of the houses being visited. She didn’t make it along with the rest of the family.



I tried to leave and get away from this place, I didn’t understand why no one else did until I attempted to multiple times. No matter what road you take leaving Trawler’s Cove they somehow all lead back into town, I tried multiple times to leave and the more I pushed the faster I came right back to my hometown. I even tried just following a compass, reaching the furthest I could go in my truck and just ran into the forest thinking I could break free from this place by going straight north.



I just ended back up near the front part of town the moment I broke through the tree line and just gave up. There's no way of escaping this town, I wouldn’t even be surprised if this town didn’t exist at all to the rest of the world. Luring people in and locking them here for the rest of their lives.



I’m thirsty six now and I still live in my family house. My mother and father passed away years ago and it’s just me now. The town alarms are already going off and the Mummer’s will be back soon. If they visit me again, I’ll refuse them from entering.



I understand now why some people do and hopefully they kill me quickly.



I just don’t want the idea that one of them is my Mother, my Father or even my sister.

As I lay snug and warm, she would regale me with tales of spirits who wander the forests of Bar Island. There were small ones which she called ""Fork Flyers"", and larger ones known as the ""Sledgestones"", but the biggest of them all was Yorut. He was a massive turtle with a head and face like that of a snail. Seven large horns formed a mane around his neck, preventing him from ever withdrawing into his shell. My mother would tell me that this is what led him to become the protector of the other spirits. Because Yorut could never withdraw, his only option when threatened was to fight to the end. She would weave fantastical tales of the twenty foot tall beast batting away bulldozers, and leering at corporate lawyers in a threatening manner.  I had figured out by the age of 12 that most of my mother's stories were just that, stories. She had spent her college years among the environmentalists, and that was very much reflected in the tall tales she created. I guess I had inherited a bit of that drive from her, as I elected to join the Forestry Service. It was during my career there that I learned that Yorut was very real.


Tuesday, February 9th, 1994 


It started as a day like any other, and quickly took a turn for the bizarre. I stopped in at Henry's coffee shop as I did every morning. Henry and I exchanged our usual pleasantries and he set right to work preparing my drink. By the time he turned back around to hand it to me there had been a dramatic shift in demeanor. Henry had always been amicable, even friendly, but this was different. His eyes were as wide as dinner plates. His usually charming smile was just a bit more rigid than usual. It looked as if making my coffee had electrified Henry with happiness. 


""Uh, hey man are you okay?"" I asked

""Oh you betcha, I just feel so good all of a sudden it's impossible not to smile."" Henry replied, beginning to rub his own face as if his skin were velvet. 

""Well let's hope you put some of that sunshine into my drink"" I laughed and asked Henry how much I owed him. 

""It's on the house!"" Henry shouted, before adding ""IN FACT, FREE COFFEE FOR EVERYONE"" 


Henry's grand showing of goodwill had brought light into the hearts of everybody there. It's amazing sometimes how something so small can make people so happy. I was even more amazed to see the ripple effect it had caused. As I drove out of the town on my way to work, I passed John's used car lot where he was putting up crudely made cardboard signs which read ""Zero money down? Zero money EVER!"" People were filing out of the local Walmart with cart after cart full of unpurchased goods. Everybody involved, be they customer or staff, was grinning from ear to ear. I heard people on the streets shouting greetings to one another. I watched the town mayor, Jonah Newport, climb into a car with a perfect stranger just because he had asked. For all intents and purposes it appeared to be a new revolution of love and brotherhood unfolding before my eyes. The reality of the situation was much more... complex. 


After the chaotic charity and fraternity of the morning I was excited to get out into the forest and enjoy the stillness of nature. I spent most of the day walking the trails checking for litter and signs of wildlife. By the time I had nearly finished my rounds the sun had begun to sink in the western sky. If it weren't for the encroaching darkness of the evening I may never have seen the streaks of glowing purple light darting around the trees. As I approached the area where I had seen them, I began to hear noises. Wet, popping thumps followed by small screeches. The sound of rock striking against rock, each time accompanied by a breathy ""kuh"". Another twenty feet and I could see the purple streaks a little bit better. Leathery wings held their slight frames aloft, bodies no more than two inches across at their widest, with long drifting tails which ended in a two-pronged pitchfork. My eyes widened as the implications of what I was seeing began to dawn on me. ""Flying Forks"" I thought ""no, wait. It was 'Fork Flyers'."" 


Creatures straight from my bedtime stories now danced before me, each taking its place in a great ring which made its orbit around some unseen object. I was rooted in place as I watched their silent parade. I noticed after a time that not all of the Fork Flyers were glowing with that unearthly shade of purple. The ones who had lost their shine peeled off from the rest and flew inward. In the stories my mother had told me, Fork Flyers were never mean, unless they were hungry. That little tidbit is what drove me to make the unfathomably stupid decision to try and slip past the ring. I waited, taking care to identify a portion of the ring where the Flyers glowed brightest. I surmised that the brightest of them might have been the most satiated, so I counted the seconds it took for my group to come around, and when it did I ran like hell. 


Diving under the ring of Flyers I scrambled to my feet and ran for cover as fast as I could. The foolishness of my decision loomed over me, growing in size with each passing second, until I had made it far enough to feel safe hiding once more. I moved between the trees, ears alert for any sign of hungry Forks flying my way. When I finally saw him I was stunned. It was Yorut. He was everything the stories said he was. Easily 40 feet from head to tail. His seven horns protruded high into the sky. Each leg a mighty trunk like that of a Redwood. He was magnificent. He was awe-inspiring, and he was dead. The Fork Flyers covered every inch of exposed flesh. Hundreds upon hundreds of pitchforks stabbing into Yorut's increasingly mangled body. More stood in wait, perched along each of the seven horns which crowned his head. As they fed, the tails of the flyers began pulsing with a faint light which suffused their bodies. My earlier suspicions were confirmed when a flyer, the most luminous of his cohort, flew away to rejoin the great ring. 


I could see groups of blue humanoid figures sitting in tightly knit circles. Each one had a large, rough patch on their forehead. They took turns bashing these patches against Yorut's shell, attempting to break it open. When their efforts were successful the peaceful, cooperative circles turned into violent feeding frenzies. Elbows flew with wild abandon as each of the Sledgestones fought to rip away chunks of the Grand turtle's flesh. Unlike the Fork Flyers, the Sledgestones did not seem to ever reach satiety. 


I was so engrossed in watching the beasts of my imagination devouring the hero of all my favorite stories that I had failed to hear the sound of leathery wings slipping through the night air. The Fork Flyer must have been making its way to Yorut when it spotted me and decided I might be easy prey. As it approached me the Flyer's tail stretched impossibly far, impossibly fast. The twin prongs of its tail planted themselves on both sides of my neck, narrowly missing a fatal blow. The prongs atop its head were the next to come. Another miss, with the creature's vicious face held mere inches away from me by its own tools. Teeth lined its oval mouth, gnashing and screeching in its struggle to reach me. I would love to say I took action.  That I dislodged the creature's tail to make my escape, but I didn't. I didn't even scream. I just stared at the Flyer as it snapped and screeched at me, knowing I was trapped. 


A streak of blue obliterated the winged devil before colliding with a tree in its path. The Flyer had been destroyed, but the tail remained lodged in the tree holding me still. Its severed head continued to gnaw uselessly at the distance between us. A Sledgestone, late to the party, had arrived just in time to save my life. It got up, shaking the concussion out of its head, and locked its eyes on mine. The blue giant was easily 9 feet tall. It was covered in hair, like the fur of an animal, and it was beginning its charge. I moved as much as I could manage, only just avoiding my right leg being turned to paste. The vibrations from the impact loosened the Flyer's abandoned extremities. I pushed with all the strength of desperation and I was made free, but not yet safe. The Sledgestone was recovering quickly. I ran like hell through the forest, all the while made aware of my pursuer by the thunderous slam of its skull against tree after tree. I drove straight home and didn't come out of my bedroom for two days. 


Tuesday February 10th


I had thought that isolation would be good. That it would help me sort out my thoughts, but in reality I was only spinning in circles. I had a long list of questions to answer and I had gotten stumped by the very first: How was any of this real? These were supposed to be nothing more than legends that teach kids lessons. Like the legend of Yehankaru, a shapeshifter who would lurk in the shadows of prosperous civilizations, stealing away anyone who allowed it to lure them to a secluded area. Easily the most heavy-handed metaphor for ""stranger danger"" I had ever seen. 


Wednesday, February 11th


I made my way into town for a coffee and a bit of normalcy. As he made my drink for me, I noticed that Henry's lunatic grin now needed to be frequently reapplied. Whatever ecstasy had overcome the town seemed to be fading. The signs at John's now half-empty car lot had been changed to say ""TWO DOLLARS DOWN?! Get outta town!"" The employees of the depleted Walmart shrugged at customers perusing barren shelves. The same vehicle that had picked up the mayor was now offering Harvey Potler a steak dinner if he got in the car. Harvey accepted the offer in the end. On the surface it was all still friendly, but the cracks were beginning to show. 


I arrived at the Ranger's station to find my superior, Terrence Howard (not that one), with his head in his hands. People had been going missing along trails in record numbers, and not just near our station. All across the island, men and women were failing to return from things as mundane as trips to the grocery store. I tried to tell him what I had seen in the woods, but I couldn't find the words. In the end, I only irritated him further with my stammering.


""Damn it, Brantley, either spit it out or get the hell out of my office. I don't have time to play charades when half the fucking town is missing."" He glared at me as he spat out the words. I couldn't find a way to explain without landing myself in a straitjacket. I thought maybe it would be easier if I showed him. 

""Will you come with me?"" I asked timidly, ""I can't find the words."" 

Terrence Howard's expression softened. Terrence was a good man, albeit a good man under an extreme amount of stress. He sighed. ""Fine,"" He said ""but we need to be back before noon."" 


We stared at the churning festival of consumption for what felt like days. The Flyers continued their skewering of the great beast. Sledgestones crowded in larger groups as the available real estate on Yorut's back dwindled. New species of creature had turned up to the feast. A face set in a flat area about the size of a beach ball with five appendages reaching toward the sky. They resembled human hands sprouting from the ground. Using their ""fingers"" to climb, they made their way to one of the Sledgestones' abandoned portholes before setting their rat-like faces down in the entryway. Wolves the size of moose stalked around the corpse, slipping in to tear away chunks of destroyed flesh before retreating to their pack. Their jet black fur danced with greens and blues as they ran. It was one forty five when Terrence turned to me and asked the question that had been burning in my mind since I found Yorut. 


 ""What the fuck?"" 

""...Yeah..."" was all I could offer. 

""Why didn't you say anything when you found it?"" Terrence asked. 

""Respectfully, sir, I had no idea how to explain this."" I replied. 

""That's...fair..."" he said. ""What the hell are we supposed to do about this, Brantley?"" 


I was relieved beyond measure to hear that. ""We."" If I were going to be grappling with the impossible, at least I wouldn't be doing it alone. Easy come easy go, I guess. 


We were halfway back to the station, walking together in stunned silence, when we first saw them. Dark shadows in the depths of the forest. Terrence must have noticed them first. He spoke quietly. 

""Keep your eyes trained forward and do not slow down. I don't know what they'll do if they know that we're aware of them. It's just a quarter mile to the station now."" 


The small sign signifying the first set of guest restrooms verified his words. I did as I was told. Never letting my attention wander too close to the many lights of unblinking eyes. Through my peripherals I could see that not every figure was whole. Some only had a single glowing ember set deep into the skull. Others had tiny twin stars blazing in their ocular cavities. The figures were of different sizes. Some big, some small. Some thin, some more rotund. Their unified gaze followed us all the while. Quiet. Patient. Hunters waiting for a chance to strike. 


We reached the station after fifteen minutes which each felt like seven. The feeling of elation from safely completing our journey hit me like a truck. I felt that as long as we could reach the station, everything would be alright. It wasn't until we had shut the door behind us that I remembered what we were doing. Noting had changed. We had made no progress. We were only seeking a shelter from which to wonder about what the hell was happening. We were every bit as lost as when we had set out. We sat together in total silence for an hour or two. 

""My mother used to tell me about these things."" I said. ""In stories when I was a kid. I never thought any of it was real. Half of the time she would make Yorut, that's the dead guy, into a pseudo-Captain Planet figure."" I continued, ""the ones with points at each end are called Fork Flyers. She called the blue ones 'Sledgestones'. She never mentioned the wolves or the hands."" 

""Perhaps it's related to some old folklore. Your mother had to get these stories from somewhere, right?"" Terrence Howard posited. 

I had been thinking much the same. I was ready to Google information on the town's legends when Terrence told me there was no need. 

""I keep a book of old tales in my truck."" And his face fell as if he were ashamed to say, ""I...I use the stories to scare hikers sometimes."" 


I laughed at the admission, as Terrence walked outside to retrieve the book. The mistake was revealed to me immediately. Terrence had been gone for just under a minute when the silence of the night was suddenly broke by the sound of a hundred footfalls. In the middle of the cacophony I could hear a single voice crying out. 


""Waitwaitwait NO. Brantley! Help...help...help"" the voice of my only companion in this crisis faded meekly into the distance, drowned out by the whooping cries of his captors. 


Thursday, February 12th 


I filed a missing persons report. The clerk told me that Terrence would mark the 237th person to disappear. She informed me of this with an air that said ""don't get your hopes up"". I should have taken that bit of unspoken advice. 


The air in Henry's coffee shop seemed different today. He, along with his customers, had all adopted a slight scowl. The overall mood felt...melancholic. Henry grumbled at my coffee as he poured it, and gave it to me with his other hand outstretched. 


""What, no more free coffee?"" I asked, unserious. 

""PLEASE. Just stop. I'm not in the mood for this kind of crap today."" He bristled all over as I noticed the empty glass cases which usually held a variety of food items. ""The city says I didn't have the proper permits for giving away coffee. If you ask me, they've got it out for me."" 

""Oh geez, I'm sorry to hear that."" I replied. I meant it, Henry had always been kind. The town had come to view him as a staple. After all, what is the linchpin of society if not the local coffee shop? I put a five dollar bill in the tip jar and went on my way. 

John's signs had changed once again. This time, they read: ""I like money too, yknow!"" I could see John through the window to his office. He seemed to be hard at work crafting tomorrow's message. Elizabeth Stoltz, an older woman with a fiery temper, was in a one-sided shouting match with the vehicle which had been collecting townsfolk. 

""How dare you proposition me, sir? I am a lady. I will not be getting into a car full of strange me-"" her sentence cut off as a wiry arm reached out in a flash and dragged her into the vehicle through the window. I tried to catch the car's license plate number, but the letters appeared to be shifting constantly. If anybody else on the street had noticed, they didn't give any indication. I decided I would go and try to retrieve the book Terrence had mentioned. The journey was largely uneventful. Once or twice during the drive I caught sight of people hiding (poorly) behind trees. You know that thing kids do where they hide behind something that barely obscures your vision of them? It was like that. 


The book was not worth the uneventful drive. Aside from a passing mention of Yorut, I found absolutely nothing. No Fork Flyers, no Sledgestones, nada. If my mother were still with us I could ask her directly where her old stories came from. In that moment, I missed her more than usual. I sat back, drinking in the silence of the Ranger's station, thinking of the woman who had raised me. 


Bereft of answers. Still. I found myself curious about the state of Yorut. After what had happened to Terrence, I was taking no chances. I fired up the drone we use to scout for missing hikers and sent it on its way. 


Shards of shell littered the clearing. Every inch of ground not covered by the fragments lay soaked in a viscous purple fluid. The Fork Flyers had disappeared from the immediate area,  seemingly all moving to the great ring which still made its orbit around the corpse of Yorut. The Sledgestones were standing in a massive huddle, desperately beating back the titanic wolves which had appeared. The hands had grown additional appendages which slithered their way across the bloodied ground looking to grab up anything it found. One of the hands, which had used its newfound tentacle to snatch up a Sledgestone, was pierced from within by a coalition of crimson worms. Their slender bodies tapered into points that looked sharp enough to pierce Kevlar. I turned the drone around to bring it home, only for it to be chased down and knocked out of the sky by a curious Fork. 


It seemed to me that the feast was reaching its end. There wasn't enough of Yorut left to sustain the creatures, and they had begun to turn on one another. Perhaps this problem would solve itself. If I could just wait a few days, the corpse would be fully depleted and all this craziness might finally end. 

So of course, shit hit the fan the next day. 


Friday, February 13th 


Bedlam had come to town. Henry stood outside of his coffee shop yelling at passersby. 


""MY BUSINESS IS FAILING BECAUSE YOU GREEDY FUCKS DON'T PAY FOR YOUR COFFEE"" he raged, stopping himself for a moment to say hello to me, before launching further into his tirade. I stopped in at the police station to check for any sign of Terrence, and I found more than I had bargained for. Two hundred and fifty missing persons had all shown up to the station that morning, and among them were Harvey Potler, and Terrence. I was elated. 

""TERRENCE"" I shouted, causing him to stumble slightly in surprise. ""I'm so glad you're okay, what the hell happened?""


""Huh?"" Was his initial reply, hastily adding ""Oh, that. Yeah I got loose about an hour after they took me. Ran all night. Thank goodness I found a trail. I could have died out there, Brantley."" 


""Dude, I know!"" I finally took a good look at him. Terrence looked like shit. His clothes hung loosely off his body. Occasionally a rib would show through the shirt as he moved. He was emaciated, as if he had been starving for days when no more than 36 hours had passed. In fact, all of the returning vanished looked brutally thin. I brushed it off, making a mental note to get this man a cheeseburger ASAP. 


As we drove aimlessly through town, the relationship between Terrence and I was flipped on its head. Usually I'm the one making impractical suggestions to irritate Terrence. Today, apparently, it was his turn. 


""Maybe we should go scope out the corpse again"" he said. 


""I don't see much point in that."" I replied. The scene had remained, at its core, largely the same since I had discovered it. With the feast tapering off, I didn't know what information we could possibly glean from another look. Terrence, to his credit, dropped that particular suggestion. However, it was immediately followed up with another. 


""Well, there's all these old sewer tunnels. Maybe there's something to investigate down there."" He sounded desperate. I understood exactly how that felt. I just wanted an answer. I would have gone down into those sewers, had I seen anything at all to suggest they held clues for us. 


""The sewers? Are you feeling okay, man?"" I was worried about my friend/boss. He had been abducted by creatures of the forest. Who knows what that's like, other than him? I could forgive him for being in a bit of a fog. 


""Yeah, I'm totally fine I just think we should go somewhere that nobody else goes. If there was something to see where people go, then somebody would have seen it. We should be checking the areas where there are no other peo-"" his words were cut off by the shattering of the passenger side rear window. John stood at the edge of his empty lot, shotgun in hand. He had a look on his face of bewildered animalistic rage. He racked another shell and took aim once more. The pellets punched dozens of tiny holes in the passenger side door. They tore around Terrence's legs, some even leaving holes in his pants. Miraculously, he was unharmed. I sped away as fast as the vehicle would allow. 


Everywhere we went, there was chaos. Walmart was completely engulfed in flames. People shouted obscenities at one another. Fights to the death were breaking out over every minor disagreement. Terrence and I had been watching Jane Turnbull giving Gabe Trund a beatdown over ""the good cart"" at Aldi. Suddenly, Terrence stiffened before saying ""too late"" and sprinting away into the streets. I gave chase, but he was impossibly fast. I didn't catch up until we had made it to the town square. What I saw there made my next decision extremely simple. 


The formerly missing had converged on the area. They all stood around, slack jawed and staring at the clock tower in the center of town. A straggler, who I recognized to be  Jonah Newport, arrived on the scene and it was as if a switch had been flipped. Two hundred and sixty seven bodies simultaneously disrobed. Their heads sat atop bodies devoid of flesh. Held aloft and upright by nothing more than bones which had been brutally marred. Looking closely at Terrence, who was nearest to me, I could see the marks of gnawing teeth along every inch of exposed bone. The missing climbed over top of one another until they formed a massive human pyramid. Jonah Newport climbed to its apex and proceeded to dive  directly into the mouth of Lane Pommson. As Jonah made his way toward the ground, the rest of the pyramid followed suit. Those standing on the ground were flung high into the air. The pyramid stood inverted as Jonah slid into the dry earth with a squelch. The others were pulled along, following Jonah down to the ground but not sailing through it as he had.  Instead their bodies smashed against the earth, skeletons scattering in all directions, leaving only a pile of still animated heads surrounded by thousands of bones. Each head was spewing a word salad the likes of which has never been seen. The cacophony of their pointless vocalizations was nearly as disturbing as what had led them there.


That was when I made the best decision I had made all week. I left. As my battle scarred Corolla rolled away from the town of Bar Harbor, I could just barely see a long line of purple streaks flying away from the clearing which had become Yorut's grave.",1,1752703229.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I recommend this diet and bought the book and blood typing kit for all my friends and family but they don’t believe me or maybe they’re not willing to try. I feel like I have to keep this to myself but I’m a secret blood type diet follower! Don’t knock it until you try it!!

I’ve tried to find studies behind this to support it, but I think there are too many variables to pinpoint just blood type diet food changes. Searches online come up with articles against it, but they are so vague and honestly I don’t think they’re valid.

I did hear that gut bacteria differs between blood types, so maybe that has something to do with it? https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3485159/

The basic idea of the diet is that we’ve evolved from places that had access to certain foods and consumed those foods and that’s what works best for us. Our blood types have evolved based on these places and our history. It’s our genetic code and part of that genetic code responds differently to certain foods.

For example, I am blood type o and bread and dairy don’t serve me well, causing inflammation and in turn other issues (mild but annoying for me, like bloating, ibs like symptoms, breakouts, and even anxiety). Then there are foods that my ancestors supposedly consumed and my body responds to better, like beef, walnuts, spinach.

This differs for blood type and simple recommendations for what to eat and avoid have helped me feel better than ever. Before this, I had super bad anxiety and stomach problems, but this went away after the blood type diet. It was so bad, to the point that I couldn’t go out without taking an Imodium to help calm my stomach.

Another unexpected benefit was my cramps lessened during my period and I have fewer and shorter migraines. I also noticed clearer skin and even think my hair has gotten thicker. I also feel fuller longer and don’t feel as sluggish. I used to drink 2-4 cups of coffee a day, 2 in the morning and 1-2 in the afternoon to keep me going at work.

I also think I was underweight and this helped me fill out and I feel more feminine and younger honestly. I am now mid 30s.

The food lists are online. I use the app and just pay attention to the main foods. I’m not super strict about the diet. I honestly recommend it even if it sounds crazy. https://www.4yourtype.com/blog/blood-type-diet-downloadable-shopping-lists/",0,1752703129.0,self,0,0.5,False

1m1pv7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnbiasedRedditReviews/comments/1m1pv7x/best_supplements_for_depression_reddit_mod/,Best Supplements For Depression - Reddit Mod Experience,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been struggling with depression and low motivation for a while now. Therapy and some lifestyle changes helped, but I also started experimenting with supplements over the past year. These five in particular made a real difference — not overnight fixes, but noticeable improvements in mood, energy, and mental clarity.

Here’s what worked for me:

**1.** [**NatureWise Ashwagandha for Stress**](https://amzn.to/44AICJR) 

This is the one I started with. It helped reduce my stress levels, made me less reactive emotionally, and improved sleep. I didn’t expect it to help so much with mood regulation, but after 10–14 days, I could tell I was calmer and less on edge.

**2.** [**Nordic Naturals Omega-3, Lemon Flavor**](https://amzn.to/4eSLIw9)

I added this based on research linking EPA/DHA to mood health. It’s subtle but effective. I noticed less emotional flatness, and my focus improved too. Definitely a long-term supplement, not something you feel immediately — but over a few weeks, the difference was clear.

**3.** [**Source Naturals Caffeine + L-Theanine**](https://amzn.to/4nQ33tE)

This combo gives me calm, focused energy without the caffeine jitters. I use it when I need to get things done but my brain feels foggy. Super helpful for those low-energy, can’t-get-started days. Bonus: no crash like regular coffee.

**4.** [**NOW Foods L-Tyrosine**](https://amzn.to/4kG1YBW)

This one was a surprise. It really helps on days when I feel mentally sluggish or unmotivated. L-Tyrosine supports dopamine production, and I do feel a boost in drive and mental energy when I take it in the morning. Great for getting out of that “blah” state.

**5.** [**Source Naturals L-Tryptophan**](https://amzn.to/4lWaNZp)

I take this before bed and it noticeably improves my sleep quality and morning mood. It helps with serotonin production, and I wake up feeling more emotionally stable. It also helped reduce late-night anxiety spirals for me.

**Final Thoughts:**

Obviously, none of these are miracle cures. But they genuinely helped support my mental health in different ways — from motivation to mood to sleep. Everyone’s different, so your mileage may vary. Always check with a healthcare provider before adding new supplements, especially if you’re on medication.

Hope this helps someone out there. Let me know if you’ve tried any of these or have your own stack that’s worked!",16,1752703095.0,UnbiasedRedditReviews,0,1.0,False

I don’t know what to think anymore… I feel like I’m living some strange nightmare and hoping every second to wake up in my bed…

I can hear Dad’s snoring through the walls, the constant whirring coming from the vents, the stale smell of grease that I could never get out of my clothes…

I mean- I’m sitting on some dirty old couch of a common house far away from the only world I’ve known writing in the log book of some crook bar owner with a weird accent! I’m no longer in the vault all thanks to Dad just up and leaving without even saying a word to me. Just yesterday we were talking over dinner about his patients and me telling him about the burn I got on my hand dealing with that broken coffee maker.

He just left without saying goodbye…

What did he expect to happen? We all just continue life as normal? That I just move on with my life without him? All he left behind was some shitty tape he gave to Jonas. 

Fuck… He doesn’t even know the Overseer killed Jonas. Or would he have known? 

I can’t think straight. So much has happened in the last 24 hours and I haven’t gotten the chance to process it all. 

Dad left.

Jonas is dead.

The Overseer tried to have me killed next.

Officer Gomez wanted to let me go but he must’ve been afraid of me too. I… had to kill him. I didn’t want to…

I’ve never wanted to kill anyone while escaping but they gave me no choice. What was I supposed to do?! The Overseer must’ve thought I was conspiring with Dad to put the vault in danger but I’m just as clueless as the rest! But he wanted to make me the villain? He sent a security guard on Amata! His own daughter! Now she has blood on her hands after killing the guard too because just like me, her father gave her no choice. 

I knew I had to leave and that tyrant was going to do everything in his power to stop me. I wrestled the keys from him and booked it to his office before more of the guards showed up. I found Amata crying and I wish she never had to go through that. My hands have been shaking nonstop and I haven’t had the chance to cry myself…

I wish I could’ve held her one last time. Told her how I felt before I left… but the guards came. 

So now I’m here. On the top floor of a common house in a city called Megaton? At least that’s what the unfortunate guy outside the gates told me.

Moriarty, the crook saloon guy with a weird accent, owns the place. I was given directions to ask around here by a lady who owns a supply store. I met a… ghoul. I almost shit my pants when I first saw him. But he seems alright… for the most part. I guess I didn’t seem like as much of a jerk as others because he eventually told me how to get info about my Dad. He was here. Not that long ago. 

He had time to grab a drink but not the time to tell me he was leaving. Figures…

Gob, the ghoul guy, said I’ll have to break into Moriarty’s terminal for the information but I wasn’t about to commit a crime when I haven’t even been on the surface for more than a day!

But… that changed though when I actually spoke to the owner. He told me everything Dad has been keeping from me. That we were never even from the vault. Everything he has told me was just… a lie! All my life I thought no one has ever left the vault but while I was digging through the Overseer’s computer to open the tunnel, I found out even more lies. The vault has opened before. To survey the land and to let my father and me in. No wonder the Overseer hated our guts…

I don’t know what to believe anymore. Seems like everything I knew was just wrong…

Moriarty told me everything except for where my Dad went. He wants me to find some lady named Silver and get caps? from her to pay him for directions. I’ve just went through hell all in a single day and he doesn’t have the compassion to at least tell me where Dad went?!

So I did what Gob suggested. Waited till the asshole wasn’t looking and snuck into his office to find out for myself. I hated every second of it but I’m not doing the dirty work for a crook. 

While I was sneaking out I found his log book he keeps his tabs written in. I guess people use caps for money up here. I thought it would have more information on Dad but… it didn’t. 

I never thought to write before but somehow this is the only thing keeping me sane right now. I’m not sure what I’m going to do next but… I’ll find him. He owes me answers.

The end of season carnage continues and we are beginning to feel the effects of injury attrition as people who are low on trades may be forced to field less than 23 premos. It's looking like Martin is out for the season, Xerri is out for 3 weeks (suspension), JHF is out for the season, Miller is probably out for the season, and Rozee's timeline is unclear but may only miss a week. The focus this week will be both on the general best trade in targets, but I'll also try to flag cost-appropriate trades given the key injuries in each line.


**DEFENDERS**


**Sinclair - 483K**, his scoring output over the previous few weeks has been largely dependent on the role of Wanganeen-Milera given the Saint's preference to move the ball through NWM. As teams continue to put more attention into Sinclair we should see an increase in scoring output, and Sinclair could be a good selection if you need to do a direct price swap for Martin and already have Whitfield.


**Whitfield - 489K**, after a slow start to the game last week he performed well over the final 3 quaters to finish with 105 in his return game from injury. He's got a good role and a respectable run home, and has demonstrated he's still got a good scoring capacity, so he would be my number one target in defence this week ahead of a game against ESS despite his high BE if you are forced to trade this week. If you have the luxury of waiting, then trading him in next week when he's priced ~460K may be even better timing.


**Clark - 554K**, probably priced appropriately for his scoring capacity, and continues to score well despite sharing the kick-ins with Ryan. Again if you can wait to trade until next week the timing may be better as COL are a difficult opponent and Clark historically struggles at the MCG, but if you already have Whitfield then Clark would be a reliable pick to finish up the season.


*Speculative Defence Picks*


**J Daicos - 542K**, I listed him as a speculative pick earlier in the year and he's gone on to average 102 which would be a decent output for his previously low price. Picking him up at 542K is either pure points-chasing off the back of his astounding last quarter as an inside mid last week, or is *a gamble*. There is a world (however unlikely) in which they continue to experiment with J Daicos in the midfield if N Daicos continues to get tagged / roll his ankle / get otherwise injured, and J Daicos has shown he's the goods. At best you get a POD with huge scoring potential, and at worst you get a POD with a decent floor of 90, so I don't mind the pick despite the score-chasing optics.


**MIDFIELDERS**


If you have the funds the clear targets are Bont and Butters, but they may be out of reach for most with the price of the injuried mids at the moment. 


**Brayshaw - 546K**, truly a bargain price for a player of his calibre. Teams have unfortunately persisted with tagging Serong, and Brayshaw has a decent run with CAR/WCE/PTA, so he comes highly recommended both for his average output and his capacity for a ceiling ~150 score.



**Richards - 550K**, great ceiling, great run home, reliable scorer, would be a fantastic inclusion this week and it's hard to pick between any one of the three top tier mids priced at 550K. Richards may get tagged against GWS, but otherwise the run is fantastic.



**Liberatore - 553K**, with an even easier run than Brayshaw and two great scores under his belt the previous two games, this is the week to get him before he reaches 590K+. His role has been great, and it's hard to see him dropping off giving any possible upcoming tags should go to Richards or Bont.


*Speculative Midfield Picks*


**Neale - 516K**, hasn't been hitting the same highs as years gone by, but has been scoring reasonably well in non-tag games, and the only real games of concern upcoming are SYD and maybe HAW. He's not as reliable as the players listed above, but if you need a cheap option I'd be much happier with this pick than with someone along the lines of Merrett or Cripps.


**RUCKS**


With Xerri in the naughty corner for 3 weeks, we have a really interesting situation. Those forced to hold will eat either a low (or 0) score for 3 weeks as Xerri's score won't be counted and most don't have bench cover for a ruck. The question becomes - do you go for the ruck with the clear current best form and run, or do you pick someone at a more reasonable price who will score well but perhaps not as well.


**Grundy - 737K**, as with recommendations over previous weeks, if you can afford it (in both cash and trades) then you should pick him. He is in absurd form with a 154 5-round average, he plays this week against a VFL ruck due to Xerri's suspension, and rounds out the year with games against ESS/GEE/WCE. It's an insane play to pick someone priced at 700K+, but at this stage of the year it's also an opportunity to make up significant ground in rankings.


**Gawn - 574K**, soundly beat Xerri last week and is reasonably priced for the first time in many weeks. There's a temptation here to say that given the two poor games prior to last week that he's not a clear cut above the rest, but we saw from rounds 4 - 14 that we shouldn't write-off Gawn just because of a couple of bad weeks. The difference in scoring output between Gawn and Grundy at the moment given the same matchups is probably 0, but unfortunately Gawn's run home isn't as good which gives Grundy the edge. Gawn is still an outstanding pick, especially for this price.


The next tier down has **Cameron - 571K** and **English - 578K**, and either would be a good pairing with Gawn if you can't reach Grundy. Of these two, English has the significantly better run home, but either look to be decent selections.


*Speculative Ruck Picks*


We now enter the land of uncertainty. 


**Marshall - 598K**, is expensive but has a fantastic run home (perhaps equal second with English, behind Grundy). The issue, however, is that last week he shared the ruck duties with Heath, and the discourse at the club is that this experiment may continue (perhaps preparing for the arrival of TDK). If the dual rucking continues then Marshall will likely have a drop in scoring, so it may be worth staying away from the pick for now.


**Meek - 540K**, has put together a great streak of scores and has a 121 5-round average. The run home is reasonably tricky, but he has scored well in difficult matchups recently and should continue to push for influence on the game as the Hawks fight for a top 8 spot, so he could be a POD at a reasonable price with only 5% ownership.


**Nankervis - 514K**, has a great run home inclusive of WCE/NTH/GEE, and has been playing well over the past 7 weeks. Has previously demonstrated a high ceiling, but his floor and average has been lower than other rucks this year. A cheaper alternative to Meek with a better run but worse form.


**FORWARDS**


I unfortunately need to be brief here owing to a lack of time - busy week this week. With the loss of Matin and JHF, there are three classes of player we can trade into: 1. Optimal but more expensive, 2. Equivalent but already well owned, 3. Cheaper and speculative.


1. Optimal: **Macrae - 520K**, great role, decent recent scoring, amazing run home, should be the number one target if you can afford him.


2. Equivalent: **Daniel - 464K**, not a great player but has the perfect supercoach role and has been hitting 90-110 reliably. If you traded him out now is the time to swallow your pride and bring him back. **Rankine - 492K**, role hasn't been great but he's been more accurate in front of goal and we can hope for more mid time with Peatling out.


3. Cheaper/speculative: Either of the high scoring key forwards in **Darcy - 455K**, and **Thilthorpe - 462K** look to be decent inclusions however the floor is low given the risk of being double teamed in defence. **Humphrey - 438K** could be a nice poverty pick given he may get more mid time with the loss of Miller (I'm bringing him in this week for JHF). **Cameron - 433K**, would be another poverty pick to look at, but unfortunately seems to be playing through injury or greatly out of form, which is a shame because the run home is nice, but it would be a great gamble to bring him in if it pays off. Lastly, I mentioned **Miers - 514K** in the comments last week and he has been nailing it, he doesn't have the history of scoring to back it up but his recent form has been impeccable and his run is great, if you are going for a speculative option and have the cash he would be a great inclusion.



Apologies for the delay, busy week this week for me

- a profile page

- a simple chat

- a dashboard to track your caffeine

It would be his first time with a sitter so we want to go with a close family member. So we got my mom to watch. I don’t know why but this upset my wife’s sister. She started an argument with my wife and I asking why we didn’t ask her since she lives closer to us. I told her because her brother in law is living at their house, and my mom said she’d come over to watch him anyway. 

Her sister can’t really come over right now because her husband is away and they have several pets that can’t be left alone for an extended period. Her bil, who I’ll call H, was supposed to watch the animals for 2 weeks while they were away visiting family. They came back to a destroyed house covered in piss and feces. So he can’t watch them. This is why our son would have to go to her place. 

And heres where the real problem comes into play. H. H is a 22 year old brother to my sil’s husband. He’s been staying with them for months, rent free. I have so many problems with this person. Here’s just a few things he’s done.

He grabbed my dick at a party, surrounded by family years ago. I almost knocked him out and caused a big scene. Everyone knows about this, nothing was done. He once randomly walked up, and grabbed my wife’s other sister’s phone and just started going through it, totally unprompted. He’s on 3 separate occasions almost blown up my sil’s house by leaving the stove gas on. He gave my 3 year old nephew a cup of dark roast coffee once and thought it was funny. There’s more but basically this guy is a fucking problem. 

I told my sil he’s the reason, and she told me I was overreacting and that she would be there so nothing would happen. She then put my on blast with my wife’s entire family and idk what she told them but now they’re blowing up my phone saying I’m a dick and going off about trust.

We told her to look for a job so she could get money and afford to buy her own house. She just said that she would as soon as she found a good one, but she hasn't even tried looking for one.
Thats why our parents kicked her out because she didnt have a job and wasnt even looking for one. I always just let her be but today morning was the last straw for me. Me and my husband were having breakfast in the kitchen when she came in. She was wearing a really short skirt and a tank top. And it wouldn't have been a problem but she sat next to my husband and was looking at him in a weird way. My husband cleared his throat and excused himself looking clearly weirded out by the situation. I asked her if she had found a job yet and she to my suprise said yes. I asked her when the job interview was. She said that it was today in a few hours. After a few hours she left to go to the job interview and me and mu husband were spending some time together. But not long after she left, maybe 15 minutes she came back. I asked why did she come back if she had a job interview. She told us that she cancelled it and actually just went to get coffee. I told her i was disappointed in this. She ingnored me and went to her room, but after a few minutes she came back wearing nike pro shorts and a thight tank top and its not an issue but she sat next to my husband and tried to sit in his lap. He pushed her away and told her not to do it again. She rolled her eyes and put her hand on his thigh. He told her to get off and he was clearly uncomfortable by this. I grabbed her arm and told her to get out. She told me i was the worst stepsister ever for kickin her out but i really didnt care. A few months passed and we didnt hear from her until last week she called me from her car, she told me she got fired and her landlord kicked her out because she wasnt paying rent. I felt bad for her but after all she did to me when we were children, for example made me loose all my friends, bullied me, always blew out my candels at my birthdays.

Damn it, where is that number?” she swore, scrolling through her contacts. Mom had a nasty habit of not labeling her contacts, so she usually had to recognize the number to know whose it was. I was more worried than ever now. I had never heard my mom curse before, and hearing her so put out made me even more afraid.

“Mom, how do you know about this ghost?”

“Oh, sweety, Mrs. Black isn't JUST a ghost. She's a blight, and she is something your father had to be ever on guard for. If you're going to take over for your Dad, then it's something you'll have to keep an eye out for as well. She shows up unannounced, she shows up in a group of other mourners, and you have to learn to spot her.”

“I get that,” I said, not really getting it but pretending I did, “but how do YOU know about her?”

“Like I said, she has been a thorn in your father's side for THERE!” she said suddenly, hitting the number and putting a finger to her lips. 

I could hear the phone ring once, twice, thrice, and then someone picked up, someone who sounded grumpy.

“Father Pierce, it's Malinda from the Mortuary. Yes, yes the Mortician's wife. Well, the Mortician Widow now, I suppose. Listen, we need you over here as soon as possible. It,” she quieted, nodding at whatever the man on the phone was saying, “Yes, yes, she's back again and he didn't know what to do. How long?” she looked at me, expectantly, and I told her the old woman had come in during the funeral earlier, “A few hours. No, I don't believe there are any bodies on the premises,” she looked at me again and I shook my head, “No, she doesn't have any bodies to move into. Can you come right away?”

She listened, nodding before telling whoever was on the other end that we would see him soon.

Then she hung up and turned to me.

“Father Pierce will be here in about an hour. We both stay here until then. Don't worry, Mrs. Black can't really hurt you if you're awake. Luckily, she woke you up before she could get into your dreams and attack you.”

She got up then, moving across her happy little cow kitchen, and started making coffee. The smell of Cafe Boone hit my nose and I was suddenly glad that mom knew what was going on. That had always been mom's way, dolling out bad news with a mug of cocoa and a gentle hand. My dad and I had always been close, I had followed him into the family trade for God's sake, but Mom had been a friend to all of us. She could soothe a hurt, feed a broken heart, quench a rage, and soften a blow with nothing but a cup of chocolate marshmallow water and a smile.

She glanced into the hallway as she came back with the cups, grimacing at something before setting my cup down hard enough to slosh the liquid a little.

“Hateful old cow,” she said softly, sipping her coffee and smacking her lips appreciatively.

“Why is she here?” I asked, wondering if I sounded as young to her as I sounded to myself.

“Because she likes this place for some reason. Your father told me that she had been coming back here for four or five generations and the Mortician here was usually warned to keep an eye out for her.”

“Yeah,” I said, taking a sip to wet my lips and wincing as it burned me, “Well, there's a lot that Dad didn't mention about this place.”

“Don't blame your father for that,” she confided, “That was my fault. I wanted you to have the chance to refuse, a chance he never had.”

I looked at her, shocked, “You mean...wait, you mean you knew about,” I searched for the right words but she beat me to them.

“About what? About the funerals for the half-humans? About the world that surrounded your father and his father and his line for hundreds of years? Tyler, I'm not an idiot. I'm shocked you hadn't noticed before he died, but I wanted you kept away from it. Your father was involved in the “family business” from the time he was twelve. He never had any other choice, not that it wasn't good for the family. Do you remember when your Grandpa died and you asked me why his coffin looked so funny? You were three, but you were always curious, and you noticed that your Papa's Box looked different than the ones we had in the showroom. I told you it was special, but it was made of Dragon Scales. Your Grandfather hoarded wealth like a Scrooge, and when he died he had so much of it worked into his casket that your father was left with the mortuary and about twelve hundred dollars in inheritance. Thankfully, your Dad was never like that. He was kinder than his father, more generous, and I loved him for that.”

I reached across the table and took her hand, “I wish he was here now.”

“Me too,” she said, “We thought he had time, had been ASSURED that he had time,” but she stopped there, seeming to have believed she had said too much. 

“So,” I said, trying to change the subject, “You said Mrs. Black has been coming here for a long time?”

“Generations,” Mom said, “She was actually buried by your Great Great Grandfather. She lost her husband during the Civil War, though not to war. He was a General in the Northern Army, but he came back with a bloody flux. It was probably tuberculosis, no one really knew in that day and age, but it was said she was very devout and she prayed over him night and day. He had given her no children, and she was hopeful that he could get better so that she could birth him an heir to his estates. Sadly, he passed though, and she seems to blame God for this. She remarried a year later, but her new husband contracted the same flux not long after they were wed. She prayed over him too, but he also passed. When your father told me this story, I always thought, again, that it must be tuberculosis. Some people carry it for years with no symptoms, and I couldn't help but think that she was passing it to her new husbands without even knowing.”

“Husbands?” I asked.

“Oh yes, the widow was still young and no community wants to waste those fertile years. She married five times, each husband succumbing to the flux. That was when the townspeople began to talk about how she was cursed. They called her Mrs. Black but she lost more than her husbands and her name. Mrs. Black lost her faith, and after her fifth husband died she refused to remarry. They say she would show up to weddings and funerals, unannounced and uninvited, and chastise the people. They had put their faith in God, they mourned the dead and celebrated the living, but all of it was hollow. All of life's pleasures were fleeting, and the sooner they realized that, the better. She lived a long time, until the ripe old age of ninety-four, and she died just as World War One kicked off. She was a hateful, spiteful old creature, and people said it was as if Death itself did not want her. She fell on her way to the well to get water and lay there for days until she passed. Her funeral was attended by no one, and she was buried in a grave that did not bear her name. Here Lies Mrs Black, it said, Unmourned and Unloved, and it was true. She had no children, no relatives, no friends, and no one to whom she could call a friend.”

Mom took a sip of her coffee, smiling as she tasted the sweetness.

“They say that when she went to the hereafter, she received the same. She had renounced God, and he did not want her in his kingdom. At the same time, the Devil found her to be too much even for him. It was decided that a fitting punishment would be to walk the earth she despised so much, moving between mortuaries, doomed to mourn the dead as she never had in life. She could only weep and wail, crying for the dead for all eternity. Sounds like quite a punishment, doesn't it?” Mom asked, and I shook myself as I came out of my trance.

“And Dad told you all this?”

“Like I said, Mrs. Black is a nasty piece of family lore. Your Great Great Grandfather presided over her funeral, the only one in attendance, and they think that's why she comes back to this mortuary more than any other. Most morticians know of her and will turn her away before she gets inside, but if she makes it inside, her weeping and wailing can go on and on. That's why we need,” there was a knock at the door then, and Mom stood up, smiling, “An exorcist.”

She moved into the foyer and as the door came open, I heard her talking quietly with someone on the doorstep. She invited him in, and as she returned to the kitchen, an extra from The Exorcist walked into my mom's kitchen, looking as out of place as I might have at a Planet Fitness. He wore the long black robes of his trade and a wide-brimmed hat with a round crown. He carried a wide leather bag and I was surprised to see Birkenstock sandals poking from beneath the hem of his robe. He took the hat off, revealing a bald head with just a dusting of peach fuzz on top. He was a man in the later years of life, and his smile was well-traveled and genuine.

“Good evening, who's ready for a good old fashion exorcism?”

I snorted, he sounded like someone doing nothing more interesting than announcing a sack race.

“I suppose,” I told him, “As long as it gets Mrs. Black out of my house and, by extension, my mortuary.”

“Don't you worry, young fella? When we're done here,” he said as he rolled his sleeves up, “this house will be clean.”

I grinned, I couldn't help it. Being around this fella was like basking in a warm patch of sunlight. I hadn't really been aware of it, but I had been sitting in my own fear and deeper brooding since I'd seen Mrs. Black in the fellowship hall. She had hung over this place like a fog, but Father Pierce was like the sun breaking those clouds and coming to settle over us once again. I could see the same sense of relief on my mother's face, and as he opened his bag, I saw that he had come for bear.

The bag opened like a set of burglars' tools and inside were little elastic holders for various implements. There were vials of holy water, crosses of every size, a round holder that I recognized from books and stories as a vessel for the host, and less well-known implements too. There was a dagger that looked to be made of silver, a rosary of gold, a leather bag with a label proclaiming it Witch Powder, and a veil of slightly glowing powder.

“Iron filings mixed with irradiated powder,” the priest said, noticing me noticing.

“What is that for?” I asked, giving him an odd look that he shrugged in the face of.

“Dunno never had to use it, but my mentor gave it to me and I've carried it ever since. Now then,” he said, taking a rosary from one pocket and a little black bible from the other, “Let's get this party started. I say we begin up here and work our way down. Any objections?”

My mom and I shook our heads and he set his cross in the center of his chest and began flipping pages in the battered old pocket bible.

He stood before us, looking down the hall as he shook his sleeves out, preparing for battle as he shielded us from whatever may be waiting down there.

“Be warned, Mrs. Black is devious. She may try to trick you, to appeal to your sensibilities, or to right and out take your body and use it for her own means. Know that you are in no danger while with me. I will protect you from her to the best of my abilities, and my abilities have earned me Priest of the Month at my parish for the last twelve quarters.”

“Are you kidding?” I asked, trying not to laugh.

“Nope, comes with a parking spot near the doors and everything,” he said, tossing me a wink before beginning. 

""Saint Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil.”

The shadows in the hall seemed to ungulate, the very air moving like an angry wave as Pierce began his litany.

“May God rebuke him, we humbly pray; And do thou, O Prince of the Heavenly Host,”

The darkness coalesced, taking on a solid form before shooting at the holy man like a bullet from a gun. I could see the shape of Mrs. Black in that shadowy mass, her arms spread like the wings of a bird, as she flew at him. If he saw her, he gave no indication, his jovial visage melting away as he read on.

“by the power of God, thrust into hell Satan and all evil spirits who wander through the world for the ruination of souls.” 

He extended his hand as she came within reach, the fingers glowing slightly, and as that shadow came into contact with him, it melted like cotton candy in a hard rain. That darkness began to scream and writhe as it touched that light, its edges pulsating and its density breaking apart. He sent it flying to all corners of the shadowy space, and I hadn't noticed how the nightlight and the light from the window shone a little brighter after all that darkness was gone. 

“Amen!"" he breathed, smiling as the light dissipated, “Well, let's move on, shall we?”

He walked into each of the rooms, uttering the same prayer to mixed results. Sometimes there was a swirl of angry darkness and a screech of indignation. Sometimes there was nothing but the sound of crickets from outside. Either way, Father Pierce would toss a little holy water into the corners of the room before moving on to the next one. Mrs. Black did not seem to like this, and she made that pretty clear as we came into the living room. Father Pierce, for his part, seemed to have an endless bag of tricks, and when we came into the living room, he proved just how deep his pockets were.

We followed him into the dark room, the TV sitting dark and cold in the corner as the couch slumped like a slumbering beast, and Father Pierce stopped in the doorway, his breath suddenly puffing out in a cloud of cold air.

“Gotcha,” he whispered, turning towards the bookcase as the dark figure materialized. She extended her hand and several of the paperbacks jumped off the shelf and flew toward us. They did not careen lazily, and as they picked up speed, I saw Father Pierce pull his hand out of his pocket with a round something held between his fingers. In a move that would have looked at home in a ninja flick, Pierce dove to the left, extending his arm and throwing several round, white wafers in the direction of the hunkered ghost. Two hit the wall and exploded to powder, but the third entered Mrs. Black and she screeched in real pain before falling through the floor and into the mortuary below. 

Father Pierce rose, the books falling out of midair before they could strike us, and dabbed the corners as he slid his tools into the pockets of his vestment.

“Sorry for the crumbs, Ma'am,” he said with a wink, “Can't exorcise a spirit without making a little mess, it seems.”

My mother shook her head, “Think nothing of it. I was going to vacuum in here tomorrow anyway.”

He snapped open the little holder he had for the host, counting them quickly before snapping it shut again, “I'm sure Christ will forgive me for wasting his body like that, but I'll need to be mindful before I act in haste again. Anyway, let's proceed downstairs. Mass starts at dawn and I would like to get a little sleep tonight before I have to conduct it.”

We came downstairs slowly, mindful of attacks as Pierce dabbed the walls in passing.

“Are all priests like you?” I had to ask, thinking back to Father Thomas who had sold me the crosses when I was having trouble with the succubi sisters. In comparison, Father Thomas was quite dower next to the flamboyant Father Pierce here. Pierce seemed to be three parts priest, three parts orator, and four parts ninja warrior. No one likes to see a multi-class holy man more than me, but it was certainly not what I was used to.

“Absolutely not,” Father Pierce said with a grin, “I'm one of a kind, the Vatican's favorite problem solver, and they know it. At least,” he added, some sobriety creeping into his mirth, “I was until recently.”

I wanted to ask what had happened, but I thought it might be rude.

I had heard a weird noise before the door to the showroom opened, and I prayed she wasn't wrecking my caskets. It was a thumping sound, like someone opening and closing the doors rapidly, but as we came onto the show floor I found the source of it. The casket lids were opening and closing in rapid succession, rocking on their risers and shaking back and forth as they threatened to fall on the floor. 

“Careful,” Pierce said, glowering into the shadows like he was looking for a naughty child, “She knows she's cornered. This is going to be her most desperate play.”

He took a step into the showroom, but when the casket slid across the carpet, its podium grating against the short filaments, he didn't quite see it in time. It hit him at waist level, halting the beginnings of his prayer as it pushed all the wind out of him. He was shoved by it for a few feet, side-stepping it as he let it go by, and then pulling something new out of his pocket as he took a shooter's stance and swung his gun from right to left.

A priest with a gun was a new one, but I guessed he knew what he was doing as he took aim and made ready to fire.

“Come on, you detestable creature. Show yourself, in the name of God!”

When a second casket slid toward him he turned and fired, the pistol spraying not bullets but a stream of water. She was visible for half a second, hissing like a cat as the water hit her, and as she vanished into the wall, the casket came to a halt. Pierce tucked the water gun away, nodding towards the office before dabbing the corners with the bottle from his pocket.

“But she went into the Fellowship Hall,” I said, pointing at the wall she had gone into.

“Right,” he said, “but we want to cut off her escape. If we bless these rooms then she will have nowhere to retreat to and will have no choice but to leave.”

He read the prayer as he went, blessing my office, the bathroom, and even a broom closet off the front entrance. It didn't seem to matter what the space was. Father Pierce took it all very seriously, dabbing the corners and saying the prayers as he blessed the space. I hadn't felt it as strongly upstairs, but after he finished blessing a room, I could swear I felt a sense of power radiating from the space. It was nothing I could put my finger on, but I guess the closest I could come was the feeling you got as a kid when you had a nightlight in your room. You know, on a deeper level, that it won't do any good, but it just makes you feel good.

This filled me with something like that, but I knew the biggest conflict was to come.

When Father Pierce put a hand on the door to the Fellowship Hall, he turned to look at my mother and I with a great deal of severity.

“This is where she will make her stand. I believe I can handle her, but I've never seen her quite this feisty. This may be the time she gets the best of me, but I don't believe so.”

“What happens if you can't handle her?” I asked, not liking the way he said he believed he could handle her.

“Call another priest to assist me while I try to hold her off. I believe that Father Thomas is your local parish priest. If you tell him that Father Pierce is having trouble with Mrs. Black then he will come on the run. Now then, I need you to do something for me, especially you,” he said, turning to me.

“Whatever you need,” I said, my mother nodding along.

“I need you to repeat, “You are not welcome here. Leave this place.” Mrs. Black is a spirit, a powerful one, but a spirit nonetheless. If you cast her out, she will have to leave. She will fight you, she will fight you tooth and nail, but with her energy spent fighting me, I believe she will be forced out.”

That appeared to be all the warning we would get, and as he shoved the doors open, I saw, again, the funeral I had been conducting earlier. Mr. Yin's casket sat open, the flowers and pictures back in place, and the seats were filled with mourners. One mourner, to be precise, but she filled the pews with a multitude of weeping, moaning old corpses. Her head was in her hands and she was screeching her sadness and fury to the rafters. I was a little daunted by so many of them, but if Father Pierce was impressed, he never showed it.

O Lord,” he began, and the heads of the congregation turned slightly towards him, “we beseech thee, this Habitation of thine, and remove far away from it all the snares and assaults of the Devil. Let thy Angels, Michael, Raphael, and Gabriel dwell therein, to preserve it in peace and from all unclean Spirits; and let thy blessing be always upon us.”

“You are not welcome here,” My Mother and I intoned, “Leave this place!”

Father Pierce drew forth his holy water pistol and began to douse them as he finished his prayer and began another.

“May the Holy Cross be my light. May the dragon never be my guide. Begone Satan! Never tempt me with your vanities!”

As the water hit them, the copies of Mrs. Black began to dissipate. It appeared that the shadow Blacks could not stand up under the holy water, but as he picked them apart, I saw one of them beginning to slowly move up on his blind side. Her face was still in her hand, but through her fingers, she was peaking and sneaking. Pierce hadn't seen her yet, and as his water gun ran empty, she quickened her pace as he brought a new bottle of holy water out of his pocket.

“Pierce!” I shouted, the priest turning just in time for her to wrap a scabby hand around his neck. The pistol and the bottle slipped from his hand, Mrs. Black opening her mouth as she leaned in close. I could see her inhale, dementor style, and Father Pierce began to writhe and groan as she drew something from him. She was strong for a long-dead woman, and I was moving before I could think better of it.

I stooped, grabbing the pistol before she could take notice of me. She was so invested in the priest, that she never noticed when the holy water struck her full in the face. Mrs. Black stumbled back, the water dripping between her fingers, and as Father Pierce coughed and rubbed at his throat, I got an idea. I don't know what came over me, but I grabbed the bottle and poured the remainder of the holy water onto my hands. Then, the viscous liquid sticking to them like oil, I grabbed Mrs. Black by the color of her burial dress and dragged her toward the door.

Like I said, I don't know what possessed me to do it, but I was suddenly tired of this old bitch being in my house.

“You are not welcome here,” I yelled at her as she thrashed and screeched, “Leave now,”

She tried to fight me off, she tried real hard, but between the holy water on my hands and the holy water on her face, she seemed to be having trouble focusing. 

“Father!” I cried out, holding out my free hand and he must have guessed what I was after because a small, soft something smacked into my palm as we walked between the benches.

She had regained some of her strength as we came closer to the door, but as her other hand came away from her face and she opened her mouth to scream at me, I slapped the piece of the host into her open mouth and closed her mouth with a quick upward thrust of my hand.

She couched, spraying crumbs as she screeched weakly.

I kicked the doors open with a single hard shot and shoved her roughly onto the carport.

“You are not welcome here! Leave, NOW!” I shouted.

To my surprise, she didn't disappear into a puff of smoke or melt into tar or burst into flames or anything dramatic like that.

Instead, she just turned and walked away, her hands over her face as she wept quietly.

It was a little bit underwhelming.

I closed the doors behind her, not wanting her to get any ideas, and Father Pierce came out half coughing and half laughing.

“My boy,” he said, his hand on his throat as he tried to catch his breath, “You are a wonder! How did you know that would work?”

I shrugged, “I didn't. I just kind of guessed.”

He laughed some more, pounding me on the back as we all breathed a sigh of relief.

And just like that, Mrs. Black was gone. 

 \* \* \* \* \*

Father Pierce came upstairs to pack his tools away, dipping into a bow as he secured his bag.

“I swear, I don't think you needed me here at all. I believe that with the right tools, you could have done it yourself.”

I blushed, telling him again that it had just been a fluke.

“But I still don't get it,” I said, voicing something that had been bothering me, “Why didn't she disappear like the ghosts in the movies when they get exorcised?”

Father Pierce snorted, “Well, that's because A. Those are movies and B. She can't be exorcised.”

I must have looked mystified because he elaborated.      

“Not really, not like other spirits can. When you exorcise a spirit, it returns to its point of origin, heaven or hell or purgatory This is her purgatory, and she is neither of Heaven nor Hell. She is a miserable old creature who is doomed to walk the earth forever, and mourn in death what she could not in life” 

He took his leave after that, saying that if we ever needed him again to give him a call.

We saw him out, and then Mom kissed my cheek and said she was going to bed.

“I've had quite enough excitement for one night,” she said, but she stopped in the hallway, turning back to look at me with something like pride.

“You know, I don't think even your father would have thought to grab the ghost by the scruff of the next after dousing his hands in holy water. He'd have been proud,” she said, turning then and heading into her room.

As I snuggled back into bed, after checking my room for ghosts or sexually aggressive succubi, I felt pride in the way I had handled myself tonight.

If this was how every day was when you were a Mortician for otherworldly beings, maybe I was cut out for it after all.

First time posting here - grateful for the community and transparency that everyone has with sharing their experiences. Thank you for that, seriously.

I started taking Cymbalta about 6-8 weeks ago and I quickly bumped up from 30mg to 60mg within the first week. I found it really helpful.

I’ve been really struggling with increased brain fog, fatigue and anxiety (weird?) so I got a bunch of tests done. All of my tests are normal. Decided that it might be this medication and I’ve found a benefit from all of my symptoms by dropping down to 30mg.

I’m curious, how long does the 60mg fatigue linger do you think? I never drink coffee, however I’ve been having two cups a day to get through my work/life schedule. 

Appreciate any insight into what you’ve found the fatigue lingering period to be like in length before getting your energy back at a lower dose!

I’m struggling since a long time with a really strange phenomenon regarding my hair: every time I shower in a city with hard water, my hair looks and feels amazing. The harder the water, the better the the feeling. Here’s what I experience:

- My hair has way more grip/texture

- It looks already good/ in shape after blow drying without any product  

-I need much less styling products in general 

- Even my scalp feels less itchy

Back home, though, I have very soft water—probably the softest here in 500 km area. My mom even fills up bottles from my tap to make tea and coffee because it tastes so good. The softness is really „obvious“: shampoo lathers instantly, and everything rinses super easily. But the downside is: my hair becomes too smooth, puffy, and falls flat. It completely loses structure. I’m convinced it’s the water, because nothing else changes—same shampoo, same routine etc.

I’ve tried to recreate the effect of hard water (e.g., sea salt spray), but it just makes my hair tangled and rough. Using less shampoo didn’t really help either.

Has anyone else experienced this? Do you know any tricks to mimic the effects of hard water at home? For context: I’m a men with black, thick, full, straight hair.

1m1p6lv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m1p6lv,"YSK: The secret to getting consistent, high-quality AI results is controlling its ""Temperature"" with these specific phrases - and it works in ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude.","If you've used AI for more than five minutes, you know the frustration. One minute, it’s a genius. The next, it’s a rambling poet who completely missed the point. You ask the same question tomorrow and get a totally different, worse answer.

What if I told you this inconsistency isn't random? It's a feature. And you can learn to control it.

For a long time, I thought this was just an API thing. But after many hours experimenting, I’ve realized you can manually control the single most important setting for any AI - **Temperature -** right from the  web chat. This is the skill that separates casual users from pros.

# Your Mental Control Panel: The Temperature Dial

Think of every AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) as having a hidden ""creativity dial"" or **Temperature**. This number, usually between 0 and 1, dictates the randomness of its response.

* **Dial at 0 (Low Temp): The Logician 🧠**
   * **What it is:** Purely deterministic. The AI picks the most statistically obvious next word, every single time. It's a robot that sticks to the script.
   * **Use it for:** Code generation, factual summaries, data extraction, following instructions precisely.
   * **Keywords:** `be precise`, `deterministic`, `step-by-step`, `technical`, `factual`, `no creativity`, `standard solution`.
* **Dial at 0.5-0.7 (Mid Temp): The Helpful Assistant 🤝**
   * **What it is:** The default setting. A balance between reliable and interesting. It won't go off the rails, but it won't be boring either. It tries to feel ""human.""
   * **Use it for:** General conversation, writing emails, balanced explanations, brainstorming with some constraints.
   * **Keywords:** `explain this clearly`, `summarize this`, `act as an expert`, `brainstorm a few options`.
* **Dial at 1.0+ (High Temp): The Mad Artist 🎨**
   * **What it is:** Maximum chaos. The AI is encouraged to pick less likely, more surprising words. This is where you get true novelty—and true nonsense.
   * **Use it for:** Creative writing, developing unique concepts, finding radical new angles, pure artistic expression.
   * **Keywords:** `be wildly creative`, `unexpected`, `think outside the box`, `give me a surprising take`, `use a novel analogy`.



# The Head-to-Head Challenge: See it in Action

Let's use the same base prompt across all three ""temperature settings"" and see what happens.

**Our Prompt:** *""Explain quantum computing to a 15-year-old.""*

**1. Low-Temp Prompt:** `""Explain quantum computing to a 15-year-old. Be precise, factual, and use the standard textbook analogy of bits vs. qubits. No creative embellishment.""`

>

**2. Mid-Temp Prompt (Just the base prompt):** `""Explain quantum computing to a 15-year-old.""`

>

**3. High-Temp Prompt:** `""Explain quantum computing to a 15-year-old. Be wildly creative and use a surprising, unexpected analogy that isn't about coins or light switches. Surprise me.""`

   * **Claude:** Excels at high-temperature creative and narrative tasks. It really leans into storytelling if you let it.

# For the Devs: The Real Control Panel

In the API, you have direct access. `temperature` is the main knob, but there's also `top_p` (Top-P Sampling).

* `temperature`**:** Affects the *shape* of the probability distribution. Higher = flatter (more random).
* `top_p`**:** A cutoff. `top_p=0.1` means the AI only considers tokens that make up the top 10% of the probability mass. It's the ""plausibility"" dial.

**Rule of Thumb:** Don't change both at once. For most use cases, just adjusting `temperature` is all you need.

    # OpenAI Example
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
      model=""gpt-4o"",
      messages=[{""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Write a slogan.""}],
      temperature=0.9, # The creativity dial
      top_p=1.0        # The plausibility dial (leave at 1 when using temp)
    )
    



# TL;DR: Stop letting the AI control you. You control the AI.

1. **Want Facts/Code?** Command it to be `precise`, `deterministic`, `technical`. (Low Temp 🧠)
2. **Want Creativity?** Dare it to be `wildly creative`, `unexpected`, `surprising`. (High Temp 🎨)
3. **For Pro Results:** Chain your prompts. Brainstorm with high temperature, then refine and execute with low temperature.

At some point I would like to upgrade to a better grinder, but I'm currently rocking a CUISINART DBM-8P1 and I'm having a hard time figuring out what grind setting (of 18) I should be using. I've tried 4-6 and unfortunately the coffee seems to come out a little bitter and overly strong. 

I'm using a medium roast from Costa Rica (Britt) and filtered cold water from the fridge and I wet the filter as well. 

My ratio is generally 8 cups of water to 50 grams of coffee. 55 seems a little too strong though I believe that is what is recommended by MM for 8 cups. I use the full pot setting as well. 

With this in mind, I'd appreciate any feedback regarding the grind or other tips in general given my situation. And it is worth saying that the brews still taste pretty good, but if I use my old CUISINART drip brewer I don't get the same bitterness. ",1,1752701427.0,Moccamaster,0,1.0,False

I have a ECM Synchronika that has a PID. Usually these double boiler machines come with the hot water wand. The hot water wand is tied to the steam boiler. Anytime my machine is all warmed up and maybe I want to make someone a quit tea instead of a coffee drink, I have to lower the temp on the steamer or else the water that comes out of the hot water wand is just a mix of super hot water and steam that’s waaayyyy too hot. 

It’s almost as if I’d prefer the hot water wand to come from the espresso brew boiler? Or else what I have to do is go to the PID on the steamer every time and wait either to let it cool down or after using wait to let it come back up to steam temp? 

What am I doing wrong? 

Are there any DB machines with a steam wand but don’t have the hot water wand that are worth looking at? I’ve looked at some other single boilers and like the look of the ECM Classica. That machine almost has exactly what I’m after but the workflow with purging the steam boiler and waiting for the milk steamer to heat up seems like too much of a downgrade from my current machine.

1m1p0wh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m1p0wh,Restored Vintage Longines,"TLDR; Had my grandfather’s vintage Longines restored, it was expensive but worth it for the sentimental value.

Pic one is the restored watch, pic 2 is the before. 

Story for those interested:

So the pictured watch belonged to my grandfather. When I was a kid (I’m 54 now) he wore the watch pretty much everyday as far as I can remember. At some point the crown broke, and it was given to me. I really can’t remember why, but I was pretty young at the time and suspect for novelty purposes as it couldn’t be set.

I really can’t recall when, but at some point it got tossed in a box, and as I got older it moved around with me along with some other stuff from my youth. 

My wife and I have lived in the same place for 28 years now, and until last year the watch sat in a box in the back of a closet. Last year while cleaning stuff out I ran across it and became interested in getting it fixed.  My grandfather died in 2007 and I thought it would be cool to have it work again. 

After a little research, I discovered the watch is worth about $300-$400, at most. So I wasn’t even really sure if anyone could restore it. Sent it off to the Swatch Group/Longines repair center in LA and waited.

After a few weeks they reached out and said no one in the US knew how to fix t it, so with my approval they’d send it to Switzerland for free, provide an estimate, and I could decide if I wanted it restored. So off it went. 

I waited, and waited, and waited. About 4 months after it arrived, I received a $1700 estimate to restore the watch. 

I really had to think about it. Money wasn’t really the issue as I could afford it, but seemed like spending 4x the value of the watch was a little irresponsible. 

So I asked my wife her thoughts, and her exact comment was…”why are we even discussing this, it’s you Pappa’s watch, you have to do it.” (Years ago he told me she was a keeper, now I know why, lol)

So I authorized the repair, and waited yet again. 

During the wait, I filled my cousin in on what war going on. He’s the last person that side of the family whom I’m close with, and my nephew is the last male on that side of the family. My cousin was also really close with our grandfather. As I have no kids, the watch will be handed down to him, and eventually my nephew. My cousin thought I was nuts for spending the money, but appreciated his son would be the eventual owner and promised to be a good caretaker of the watch. 

About 6 months after the authorization the watch arrived. I was a little nervous opening the box, as I wasn’t sure what to expect. Well, I’m not the most sentimental guy, but I was super close with my grandfather, he was really a second dad. I literally started crying when I saw the watch. Tons of memories of my grandfather came flooding back. 

Longines did an absolutely amazing job restoring the watch. They polished a crap load of scratches out of the case, put on a new plastic crystal, completely revived the movement, had to make new hands and indices as the old ones were rusted.   

Best $1700 I’ve ever spent in my life. And the best part is, when I’m nothing more than ashes in a coffee can, I know my cousin and nephew will have this family heirloom.

Most of our shared friends aren’t bothered, but his closest friend is definitely pissed off at me so I’m wondering if I was the asshole in this situation. 

Our friend group met through the local music scene and we all live within like ten minutes of each other. Last weekend, we all went out with a few other people (a bunch of guys who played the previous night and Taylor’s gf, Jade f26) for brunch after getting drunk the night before. This is normal for us.

Context: a few of us have eating disorders. I (m22) do, Edward (m27) does, David (m20) does and we often talk about our disorders and other people’s together. If you’ve never had an ED, you won’t know this but we’re all obsessed with our disorders. It helps us cope, I guess. All of us, including Taylor, also have pretty dark senses of humor too. We joke about each other’s drug use, David’s dead dad, my health problems (related to my ED), each other’s body issues and more. Taylor’s never had a problem with it before.

At brunch, me and Edward just got iced coffee and Jade got a diet coke, so Taylor was one of the only people at our table actually eating. Everyone else we went with at the other tables were eating a lot, so it’s not like Taylor stood out that much or anything. After a while, I started talking about some celebrity’s weight loss to David because we both heard about it online. I was just talking to David but Jade kept giving me weird looks the whole time until she left for the bathroom.

Taylor ate his food kind of fast and then said he was going out for a cigarette before leaving the diner. A few minutes later, I finished my coffee and I wanted to smoke too so I went outside and into the alley behind the restaurant. As soon as he heard me, Taylor looked up in a kind of panicked way and took his fingers out of his mouth, totally covered in vomit.

The moment was super uncomfy, since I just caught him purging, so I made a stupid kind of joke to lighten things up. I said that Edward and David each owe me twenty bucks, because Edward bet Taylor was orthorexic and David thought he wasn’t disordered at all but I was right that he was bulimic. It’s not out of place, considering our humor but Taylor looked upset and begged me not to tell Jade.

Later, Edward said what I said to Taylor was really fucked up. He’s normally really close to Taylor but now Taylor isn’t talking to him and now he’s taking it out on me. David thinks everyone knows about our EDs now so he’s upset about that. If I did do something fucked up, I think Edward is just as guilty because he’s the one who started taking bets on Taylor’s disorder. So AITA?",4,1752700836.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

I had a vitamin D deficiency last time I checked (and took supplements for it) but I didn't check in a while. I also am obese but the problems I'll cite here started even before I became obese (maybe obesity made them worse but I'm not sure)

But for as long as I can remember, I've been weak. When I was in school, I'd sleep for 10 hours a night (10 good hours, not 10 hours where you toss and turn) and still end up literally falling asleep in class and/or being very tired. I was so tired I'd sometimes call my mom begging her to let me go home.

I am so familiar with fatigue, I have a certain state I call cloudy eyes, which happens most when I go out or when I move around a lot. I suddenly become exhausted, like I'll drop any second, and my eyes feel cloudy, sometimes even my vision gets a bit blurry. I am a very smiley person but in those moments, I don't even have energy to smile.

Aside from this fatigue, I've dealt with random pains all my life. When I was a kid, I'd stay awake at night sometimes because my legs hurt so much. Sometimes, it was my arms, but that was less frequent. Migraines were also part of my routine. But the big beast was my stomach, it caused me tremendous pain, the type of pain where you can't sit or stand, just lay down. As the years passed I've taken foods out of my diet that I noticed caused pain (mostly traditional foods from my country which contain semolina) and I'm much better although I still have pain occasionally. My legs and arms also don't hurt anymore (I tried cupping therapy and it helped) but there was a time where I couldn't imagine a day passing without pain. 

I'm generally weak. Even now, 8 - 9 hours of sleep barely gets me by. At the 12 hour mark of me being awake, I crash. If the weather is too hot, I crash. If I drink coffee or eat anything that isn't dry like bread in the morning, I'm very likely to get nausea. If I walk outside in the sun, I feel like I'll collapse. My teeth are so weak that even my dentist (whom I've been going to regularly for years) gets shocked like ""when did all these cavities pop up?"". I also have urticaria which was HORRIBLE when I was kid (I'm talking can't sleep because of it until I took antihistamines) but now it calmed down and only pops up when I'm stressed out like right now lol. I also noticed I started dropping things a lot especially these last years. Even when I'm holding them firmly, my hand kinda just gives up for a second. I've broken a couple things like that.


As for family history, diabetes runs in the family and my dad had a rare autoimmune illness which took his life in his early forties. My grandfather died of a heart attack in his sixties. My grandmother died of a stroke in her seventies.


Is this level of fatigue and weakness normal? I know I don't take care of my body as I should, but why does it feel like I'm paying for it more than other people? I don't know how I'll finish my life like this if I'm already this tired at 23. I sometimes wonder if I'll even live a normal lifespan or die early cause I literally can't do anything with this body.

1m1orif,https://www.reddit.com/r/Copyediting/comments/1m1orif/freelance_editing_rates_for_newbie/,Freelance Editing Rates for Newbie,"Hey fellow editors!  
I'm an undergrad student studying linguistics and have no editing experience under my belt, but want to work in publishing. Recently, I was working at my part-time job and while there, met an author working on his first novel. He offered to let me edit it, which I was very excited about, (portfolio building!!!) and I was willing to do it for free. When we met for coffee after I had finished editing about 4 chapters, he said that he really liked my work and couldn't believe I was just starting out based on the quality editing that I was doing. He brought up payment rates and also mentioned paying me a bonus after he signed to an agent. We never worked out details - like when I would be paid, how (cash, Venmo, Paypal), etc.

Here's where it gets sticky. When we met up, he offered $10-15 per chapter, which sounded fair to me because of my  lack of experience. I've done some editing since then - 3 chapters a week since the beginning of July. I brought up payment last night. Firstly, he said that we discussed $5-10 per chapter, which is untrue, but wants to pay $10 which I'm fine with. Then, he made a joke about me expecting to be paid weekly. Is that not normal for the publishing industry, especially freelance? I've edited 7 chapters now.

Am I being used or am I just new to the industry? I really want at least ONE project on my resume, so even if he is tricking me, it would still benefit me. It would be great to have a good review on my Reedsy account, and maybe he would pass my name along to agents, other editors, authors, etc.

  
TLDR; Brand new editor, met an author who invited me to edit his book. I was willing to work for free, but then he liked my work so much he offered to pay me a rate of $10-15 per chapter a few weeks ago. Never worked out logistics, and I brought it up again after editing 7 chapters and he was surprised that I wanted weekly pay. Is that not industry standard? What should I do?",1,1752700433.0,Copyediting,9,1.0,False

I’m struggling since a long time with a really strange phenomenon regarding my hair: every time I shower in a city with hard water, my hair looks and feels amazing. The harder the water, the better the the feeling. Here’s what I experience:

- My hair has way more grip/texture

- It looks already good/ in shape after blow drying without any product  

-I need much less styling products in general 

- Even my scalp feels less itchy

Back home, though, I have very soft water—probably the softest here in 500 km area. My mom even fills up bottles from my tap to make tea and coffee because it tastes so good. The softness is really „obvious“: shampoo lathers instantly, and everything rinses super easily. But the downside is: my hair becomes too smooth, puffy, and falls flat. It completely loses structure. I’m convinced it’s the water, because nothing else changes—same shampoo, same routine etc.

I’ve tried to recreate the effect of hard water (e.g., sea salt spray), but it just makes my hair tangled and rough. Using less shampoo didn’t really help either.

Has anyone else experienced this? Do you know any tricks to mimic the effects of hard water at home? For context: I’m a men with black, thick, full, straight hair.

Thank you in advance for any help!",1,1752700340.0,AskHairstylists,0,1.0,False

1m1opho,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m1opho/i_inherited_a_mortuary_my_first_funeral_service/,I Inherited A Mortuary. My First Funeral Service (Pt. 2),"I was standing at the side of the stage, the spot most funeral home directors post up when it's time to run the service. Dad had been dead for less than a week, but it appeared that this was not the sort of work you could take on a bereavement. Well, I guess maybe you could. Where were they gonna go? Some OTHER funeral home for monster people?

My day had started with a loud knock on the back door to the mortuary. That happened to be the front door of the little house above the mortuary, and after the third knock, I decided that it wasn't a dream and got up to see who was banging on the door at six o'clock in the morning. I winced as I came down on a model plane that had fallen off its fishing line from the ceiling and decided for the hundredth time that I needed to redecorate this room. The same band posters I had hung in high school were here, as were the game maps and model planes and all the other things that had ensured I hadn't lost my virginity until I was twenty-two. Her name was Gretchen, she kinda smelled like formaldehyde and she was brilliant when it came to fixing up corpses for viewings. 

Too much information? I tend to overshare some.

Standing at the door to my home was a man who took up most of that doorway. He looked like he had just rolled out of a Humvee somewhere in Iraq and was ready to liberate some oil right under my residents. Behind him were three black town cars, each containing four other equally as scary-looking men in black suits and visible holsters. The man looked down at me, his red hair reminding me of a brindle hound we had kept for a while when I was a kid, except this guy looked like he lived under the stair stepper at Planet Fitness and ate the guys who couldn't lift more than two fifty. ""Ground their bones to make his protein shakes,"" I thought but did NOT say.

See, I can be subtle.

He tipped his sunglasses down to show me a pair of perfect scarlet eyes.

""You the Mortician?"" he asked, and I realized this wasn't Mr. Carrow.

This was the guy from the phone, Jericho.

""Uh, yeah. Where's Mr. Carrow?""

Jericho turned and told his guys to begin setting up and securing the parameter. He stepped into my mother's kitchen and I saw him curl his lip up as he looked around at the happy cows that decorated the walls and the decor. Mom had made her kitchen look like a field of cows, and Dad had indulged her a little too much in that regard. I mean, who else has a faucet that looks like a smiling cow's mouth? A ceiling fan where the lightbulbs are udders? Peel and stick flooring that's black and white? Mom had every knick-knack and bit of cow crap she could find. Short of having a real cow in the kitchen, she was stacked.

""So, what happened with Mr. Carrow?"" I asked, as Mr. Jericho took a seat at the table and made it look like dollhouse furniture. The chair creaked menacingly, and I was afraid he was going to get a look at the Funeral Floor before I let him into the building. The chair held, and I breathed a sigh of relief as he steepled his fingers and looked darkly at me.

""Emergency assignment,"" he growled, ""I dropped the price to twenty-six denari, for the trouble.""

I nodded, gulping as he continued to stare at me.

""Very good, thank you for that,"" I said.

""Payment is upfront,"" he growled, holding out a hand.

""Ah, yes, let me go get that for you,"" I said, moving back towards my bedroom.

I counted out twenty-six hundred of the weird coinds, which took more time than it should have. Holding them in my hand looked kind of lame, plus they were a little heavy, so I went to find something to put them in.. I went over to the desk and looked throug the drawers, passing up a plastic baggy and an old bag that had held Berty Bots Every Flavor Beans. I found a little Crown Royal bag and after dumping the D&D dice out of it, the coins fit pretty well inside. I put them in my pocket, then realized I was still in my pajamas.

Ten minutes later I had put on something a little more acceptable for a trip to Walmart and came out to give Mr. Jericho his money.

I froze when I smelled bacon and eggs cooking and heard my mom's voice wafting out of the kitchen.

""Do you like them scrambled or sunnyside up?""

""Really, Ma'am, you don't have to,"" Mr. Jericho began, but my mother cut him off.

""I insist. I won't send one of Tyler's friends off without a little something in his belly. Do you need more coffee? Maybe some cream?""

""Black is fine, thank you, Ma'am.""

I came back to the cow yard to find Mr. Jericho with a muffin, toast, bacon, and jelly, sipping coffee and looking at me as if he thought I could rescue him. My came bustling over and tipped eggs on his plate, seeing me and smiling, as she pointed at an empty plate on the table.

""There you are, sweety,"" she said, going back to the stove, ""I was just tending to your friend here. Have a seat and I'll have your eggs in just a second.""

I smiled at Jericho and passed him the bag of coins while Mom was busy at the stove. He raised an eyebrow at the bag and I shrugged before he pocketed it. He shoveled the eggs and bacon down fast enough to make me think his jaw might unhinge and drank down the coffee before getting up.

""Thank you for a lovely breakfast, Ma'am. Mortician, we'll be setting up outside when you get ready to open up. I want to have a look at your chapel and the entrances and exits before the service starts. Rendezvous at the front at 0730."" he nodded to my mom and left, the chair creaking happily after he'd gotten up.

""Such a nice man."" she said, ""If he one of the boys who plays Wizards and Wimsey with you or whatever it is.""

""No, Mom,"" I said, taking his muffin and savoring it, ""I don't think he's playing anything.""

\*  \*  \*  \*  \*

I made Jericho wait till 0735 because I'm an ass.

Also, I couldn't find my tie so I had to improvise.

Jericho cocked an eye at the red tie I had selected to replace it with, and I rolled my eyes.

""I know, I know, no one wears a red tie with a black suit. I'm hoping my black tie is in the office.""

""Hey, far be it for me to judge your fashion sense. I'm just the muscle.""

""Speaking of,"" I said, unlocking the mortuary, ""Why did I need so much muscle, again?""

Jericho didn't follow me in, and when I looked back he was glowering at me in disbelief.

""You're joking, right?""

""Uh, no, not so much,"" I said, wondering if I needed to invite him in. I didn't think Jericho was a vampire, but I wasn't sure what he was, honestly.

""Persians,"" Jericho intoned, ""Ever heard of them?""

""Isn't that the guy from mythology who slew the Medusa?"" I asked, Jericho finally stepping over the threshold and coming inside. His combat boots galumphed on the carpet and I tried not to notice the stains on the toe. Someone was likely short a few teeth if they were still alive.

""Persius was, yes. The Persians are a fringe group who hunt Gorgon in his name. I'm sure he's spinning like DMX in the Elisium Fields over it too. Anyway, they hunt other stuff too, like Manticore, Minotaur, and Chimera, but they LOVE Gorgons. Really gets their tridents hard, if you know what I'm saying.""

I thought about that troubling mental image as I took him around and showed him the entrances and exits to the place. 

""I mean, you guys look like you have enough firepower to take out a couple of guys with swords and reflective shields.""

Jericho laughed, ""Oh, these guys don't do that anymore. They find that shotguns and machetes work way better. These guys aren't some hick trophy hunters either. They are generational monster killers, and something like this will be too good to pass up. We've got a spotter, though, so it shouldn't be too difficult to nip this in the bud.""

We talked a little more about details, but when Jericho realized it was after eight he took his leave and said he'd be outside if we needed anything. I spent the next few hours getting everything ready and making the last of the preparations. I found my black tie in the embalming room, for some reason, and decided to use the red one as a pocket flourish. The black suit was nice, but it did need a little bit of color. 

When eleven o'clock hit, I opened the doors and waited on the first of my guests to arrive.

The sisters came first, arriving in a rented town car, and Marge and Selma were looking resplendent in their mourning attire. They had a few other Gorgons with them, ""Cousins"" Selma told me in passing, and as the Escalade pulled up I was suddenly glad I was off the main drag. A pair of cow people, and I don't mean the inclusive term for Cowboys, climbed out, their suits immaculate if not bulging oddly in places not meant to contain animal legs or joints. They shook my hand, thanking me for such a lovely service, and I tried to figure out how they had hooves on their feet but fingers on their hands? A score of pot-bellied Danny Devito types followed them in an honest-to-God wood-paneled station wagon, their horns barely contained under black ball caps and their loafers hardly containing their stubby hooves. Their dates were comely young women whose flower crowns that contrasted with their mourning dresses. They all thanked me, most asking when the eats would be served before waddling in. 

Jericho was on the front door and, I kid you not, he sniffed the air before letting any of them through. Whatever he was smelling for, he apparently didn't find it, and the groups were good to go. He growled at a couple of buff guys in togas, both having arrived on a pegasus that stood cropping grass once they hopped off, and I saw them do something I can only describe as ""Hairing up"" when they returned his growl. He unbristled as he let them in and he shook his head when I asked him what that was about.

""Strays,"" he said cryptically, ""don't know why they won't just get a job and a pack.""

I asked him what the hell that meant, and he said ""Exactly"" and refused to answer further.

The trouble didn't start until a gold Camero pulled in, almost clipping a family of Manitocore who growled and spit at it as they picked up a couple of Manticore kids who were downright adorable.

Selma had been talking to Jericho at the door, flouncing her snakes and asking about Mr. Carrow, when her eyes suddenly turned firey and she stomped towards the buff guy who had climbed out of the golden death trap.

""Oh no, not you, YOU don't get to come here. Not after what you did!""

She was walking fast towards the man, and by his Colgate smile, he seemed more amused than angry.

""Come on, Suli. You aren't still mad about that, are you?""

""I was, I am, I will be, and I would curse you to sit on the banks of Tartarus for all time if I wasn't over my limit for the year already. I could always use a new statue for my garden, however, if you'd like to push it.""

She was reaching for her veil, and since Jericho clearly had better sense than me I decided to get in the middle of it.

""Whoa whoa, let's not have a scene. Sir, I don't know who you are, but this is a,""

""You don't know who I am?"" the man said, striking a pose that would make a J Crew model swoon, ""I am Posthumorus, the demi-god of,"" 

""The demi-god of being a sleaze and a cheating asshat!"" Selma screamed, her hand still contemplating ripping off the veil and making him uncomfortably rigid.

""How was I supposed to know she was your sister?""

""You could have asked. When you came to see another Gorgon you met on MonsterMash and picked her up in your chariot FROM THE SAME DAMN CAVE!""

Selma was getting heated, and the side eye our little group was getting from the family of Manticor was decidedly bombastic.

""Suli, come on,"" the guy said, really turning on the charm, ""You know you're my one and only. That thing with Patty, it didn't mean anything. Come on, let's get some dinner and talk about it. You know you can't live without your little snake charmer,"" he said as he flexed his arms alluringly.

""Hey, pretty boy,"" Jericho said, and I jumped as I realized he was behind me, ""The lady said she don't want you here. This is a funeral, why don't you respect that unless you want yours to be the next one you attend.""

The demi-god looked at Jericho and smirked, something I'm guessing was a first for Jericho.

""Haven't you got a ball to chase, hound? Don't make me crate you and send you back to Hades.""

""Try it,"" Jericho growled, ""and I'll show you why Apollo won't fly over my house anymore. Don't be so quick to join your brother in the hereafter, punk.""

Jericho appeared to have won this little back and forth because the demi god scoffed and held up the universal sign to ""call him"" to Selma before hopping back into his car and peeling out.

""Well, that was something,"" I said, patting Jericho on the arm, ""Good job, Jericho. You more than makeup for your price tag.""

Jericho looked down at me, and I put my hand back where it belonged.

He stalked back to the door, and I realized it was almost time to get started.

Jericho put a hand out before I could go inside, whispering, ""This is going to be the dangerous part. If they attack, it'll be during the service. Be on your toes and keep the clients safe if they do.""

""How do I,""

""Just keep the doors locked, and keep everyone inside. Here,"" he said, handing me a radio, ""In case you need to get in touch with me. It shouldn't come to that, but if it does just be ready.""

I nodded, not really having any idea what he was talking about, but deciding to play it by ear.

I came in to find some of the women in flower crowns had harps set up on the stage. Since none of them had so much as a clamshell bag, I got the sneaking suspicion they had grown them. They were all softwood and delicate strings, and as they started playing in earnest, I realized it was a string rendition of Bitter Sweet Sympathy. It was beautiful, probably one of the most haunting things I had ever heard, and when they stopped, Marge mounted the stage and thanked everyone for coming.

""Petrifica was my sister and roommate for centuries. We shared so many things. Rooms, food, boyfriends, statues, nights on the couch just watching the Bachelor and eating whatever had wandered in. She was my best friend, and I miss her every day. She was taken too soon, a fate that awaits many of us. I remember the last thing she said to me.""

Marge looked into the middle distance as if trying to remember something from a lifetime ago, her eyes misting with tears.

""I'm just going out for a bite. It's nothing to lose your head over.""

Marge sniffed, laughing a little as she thought about it.

""It's...it's almost funny,"" she said, laughing and crying at the same time as she tottled off the stage.

Selma took her place, still looking surly but I thought it might be to hide the tears.

""Patrifica was my middle sister. We had our differences, we had our squabbles, but I wouldn't have wished this on her or anyone. Sometimes, when we were Gorgonlings, she would sit with me when it rained and I would braid her hair. She was afraid of the rain for some reason, and she thought it was funny how the snakes would squirm and writhe in the braids when I was done."" Selma laughed a little at the memory, her own eyes getting a little misty, ""I miss her. I miss fighting with her over clothes. I miss yelling at her for stealing my boyfriends. I miss when she would come into my room and say she was sorry and we would cry together. Who will I cry with now?"" she asked, returning to her seat as the waterworks began.

I heard something outside, the strings taking up a heart-rending version of Free Bird, but I put it out of my mind.

By the four-minute mark, apparently, the woman didn't do abridged versions, I recognized the sound as the *wump* of a high-powered rifle.

I picked up the radio, stepping off stage a little, and asking Jericho if everything was 10-4 out there. 10-4 was the width and breadth of my radio lingo, so I hope he didn't want more 10 codes. 

""Just some pests, nothing we can't take of,"" Jericho growled.

At the six-minute mark, there was chatter of automatic fire.

Some of the others had started to take notice. The minotaurs were looking nervously at the doors, the Danny Devotos were rocking a little as they sweated into the armpits of their suits, and I could see one of the Manticor kids climb into their dad's lap. Selma and Marge had noticed too, but they were clearly confident that everything was fine. I wasn't so sure, especially when something shook the building like it an explosion might have gone off somewhere nearby.

For the first time in my life, I was aware of how strange our chapel hall was. There were no stained glass windows, no windows of any sort, and the whole thing was slightly recessed into the ground, sitting about three feet into the foundation. It was unlike any other chapel I had seen, and I knew from experience that Dad had brought us here when the TV talked about a tornado warning.

""It's survived worse than a twister, son,"" he said once when I asked why we always came here, and I wondered if this was what he had meant.

As Free Bird ended, some of the others assembled came up to make small speeches.

One of the minotaur talked about how she had introduced her to her husband, and I just realized that one of them was a female, go figure. 

A couple of the Devitos came up to talk about what a good friend and lover she had been.

The Manticore talked about how she had always been a loyal friend.

This was all given with the backdrop of gunfire from outside as whatever was going on out there continued to go on. The creatures weathered it well, only wincing every now and again when something loud happened, and the ceremony came to a close on time. Selma and Marge came up together, thanking those who had come for being there, and that was when all hell broke loose.

Something hit the door very hard from the outside, and the returning chatter of gunfire was only slightly muffled. Selma told them that, as soon as they had the all clear from security, there was a reception in the fellowship hall, and when something hit the door this time, it sounded heavy.

""Jericho?"" I asked, but there was no answer.

 It hit the door three more times, and when they popped open, everyone screamed and got down below the benches. This was no mean feet for a few of them, the Minitaurs especially were mostly just getting as low as possible, and as the two men strode in, I got my first look at a Persian. Both of them were blonde, but it was clearly bottle as opposed to natural. They had machetes in belt sheathes on their hips, shotguns on their shoulders, and the lead one was stalking up the aisle like he had just found the N64 under the tree on Christmas morning. 

""Attention various monsters, hybrids, and everything in between. We are NOT interested in you today. We want the other two sisters for our trophy wall. We knew if we gave up the one head,"" he said, his boots making a grating sound on the carpet as he walked, ""We'd get the whole trifecta.""

I looked at the two sisters, both of them cowering as they hid behind the podium. Why didn't they just unveil and blast these guys? The closer they got, the more I expected it, and the less likely it seemed. Man, no wonder they killed so many of these guys. Looking at the assembled crowd, I saw all of them cowering and trying not to be noticed as these psychopaths got closer and closer to their target. The monsters I had grown up reading about were really not that impressive, and I began to wonder if the stories were being propped up by the heroes to make them sound cooler than they were.

Looking around, I found I had an idea, but I would have to be quick.

This probably wasn't going to get me any return business from the assembled creatures, but it was worth a shot.

I stumbled forward, coming close to the casket and slipping my knife out. I was a deft stitch, but my buck knife was sharp. It went through the stitches like a scalpel, and as the guys came up close to the casket, I stood up and yelled for everyone to close their eyes. The two bottle blondes turned equally dumb looks my way, but the rest of them seemed to get the idea when they saw me rise up with Patty's head in my hands. I had her gripped by the headscarf, the snakes writhing weakly against my fingers, and when I flicked the pin out of one eye, I tried to think of something really cool to yell as they caught it full in the face.

""Petrificous Totalous!"" I finally settled on, and as the two turned to stone, I turned around gingerly and put the head back in the casket, closing the lid.

""Sorry ladies, but I think the rest of this service will have to closed casket.""

To my absolute shock, the assembled creatures clapped, some of the Devitos even whistled loudly. I expected the sisters to be mad, but they both wrapped their arms around me and hugged me while laughing. All in all, the only one who was mad was Jericho.

""You had,"" he huffs, his arm hanging at his side as he came stumbling in, ""the perfect chance to say something really cool, and you yell Harry Potter lines?""

I shrugged, ""It was the best I could do on short notice! Sure me.""

He laughed along with the rest after that, and it really broke up the tension.

It appeared I had survived my first funeral.

\*  \*  \*  \*  \*

""I can't believe you're going to eat that,"" I said, turning a little green as Jericho at the raw meat on the paper plate in his hand.

The funeral guests were chowing down, many of them laughing as they told stories about Petrifica. The Devitos were munching on bugs that had been cooked on skewers, the Minotaurs slurping raw beef by the forkful, and the rest had laid into both with gusto. Selma was laughing like a loon, the wine clearly going to her head, and she sprayed cricket legs and wine on Marge without meaning to.

The whole event was back to being a grand affair, and I was glad.

""What?"" Jericho said, ""I've been wounded, I need to heal up and food is the best way to do it.""

I had been too polite to ask up until this point but decided to address the elephant in the room.

Like the fact that Jericho had sprouted big gray ears and looked like someone in a Spirit Halloween Big Bad Wolf costume.

""So...how long have you been a dog man?""

Jericho looked at me darkly, ""I am not a Dog Man. I'm a hellhound."" he said, turning back to take another bite of bloody steak. 

""Okay, how long have you been a Hellhound then?

He thought about it, chewing wetly, ""Over two thousand years, I guess.""

""So, how did you,""

""Don't go there, kid. We ain't there yet,"" he said, finishing his steak and holding out the plate for another.

The more he ate, the less noticeable his features became. 

Two steaks later, he was back to his same old muscly self.

""So, did you lose anyone today?""

Jericho shook his head, ""Short of decapitation, we're really hard to kill. The two you dealt with got the jump on me, or they wouldn't have made it that far. I've got a couple of guys who are wounded, but that's about it. Consider yourself lucky. I charge double for fatalities.""

I gulped, dully noted.

Selma came up and hugged me again, planting a kiss on my cheek as she thanked me for the beautiful ceremony and the rescue.

""Here's a little something for being so brave,"" she said, putting a little stack of denari in my pocket before patting my butt and walking off.

""Is it always like this?"" I asked Jericho, watching the partygoers get progressively more blasted.

""You're the mortician, not me. But, yeah, pretty much. When you live as long as some of us do, you take death very seriously. You mourn the dead like we did in the times of our Gods. With wine, with food, with good friends, and with good memories.""

I nodded, smiling up at Jericho as the funeral went on into the wee hours of the morning.

The hangover I had the next day was well worth it.",2,1752700299.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I traded the GTX 970 for a bunch of half corroded water-cooling parts from 2014 and got two GPU blocks, 13 white only led fans that are molex daisy chained to like 3 different chains. Got a few fittings and two GPU blocks for the 3090 I spent a stimmy check on and the CPU is a 9900k -- the fastest gaming CPU possible for the z370

I'll admit at one point this was almost the fastest gaming PC on the planet haha, now it's a relic, but not bad to play with LLMs on smaller models either due to 24gb vram. Thing has more than made its own worth back in value imo anyway 

The sound system cost me just under $650 used and repaired some stuff. It's some focal shape 65 on top of Boston cr9 which is the speakers for my coffee bar, a velodyne hgs 10 sub and a decent Denon as an AVR decoder ran off an extra HDMI out from PC that's a dead display but audio out 

The PC is literally made out of garbage scraps lol, has parts more than a decade old inside of it 👀, thing can still slap somewhat lol I'm hoping it's faster than consoles until at least  2027

1m1oftv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1m1oftv/could_mr_coffee_12cup_programmable_coffee_maker/,Could Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker Be Your Kitchen's Best Addition? Review Inside,"The **Mr. Coffee 2182809 Coffee Maker** is a reliable and feature-packed option for anyone who loves a fresh, steaming cup of coffee in the morning. I’ve been using this coffee maker daily for several weeks, and it’s quickly become an indispensable part of my kitchen. While I appreciate its many qualities, there are a few points that prospective buyers should keep in mind.

**Design and Build Quality**  

The modern design blends stainless steel and black accents, making it a sleek addition to my countertop. It doesn’t just look aesthetically pleasing—it’s also built compactly, measuring 8""D x 10""W x 14""H. It fits snugly into smaller spaces, which is great since I have limited counter real estate. The intuitive button interface feels straightforward, but I wish the button labels were slightly larger. The reusable filter is another thoughtful touch, saving me from constantly buying disposable filters. This not only saves money but also makes the machine more eco-friendly.  

**Ease of Use and Features**  

The programmable capabilities of this coffee maker had me sold from day one. On busy mornings, having the option to schedule a brew the night before is a lifesaver. This feature is especially useful when I host guests, and everyone wakes up anticipating freshly brewed coffee. The ""Grab-a-Cup Auto Pause"" is another highlight. I’m pretty impatient in the mornings, so grabbing that first cup mid-brew is a luxury I’ve come to rely on. It’s fully automatic, so even the most tech-shy individuals (looking at my partner here) can use it effortlessly.  

**Highlights**  

- Brew Selector enables Regular, Strong Brew, or Decaf coffee.  
- Delay Brew function ensures coffee is ready when you are.  
- Auto-shutoff turns it off after 4 hours—a peace-of-mind feature.  
- The cleaning setting ensures lasting coffee quality.  

[Check Mr. Coffee 2182809 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0dny9lj4m/)  

**Performance and Brewing Options**  

Every cup brewed with this machine feels like it’s tailored to my exact preferences. Between Regular, Strong Brew, and Decaf, having a customizable brew strength feature made me (and my caffeine-happy family) very happy. I love stronger brews, while others in the house prefer something milder. There’s no compromising, as one touch adjusts the brew type. The coffee’s flavor is robust, and the consistency is far superior to cheaper or simpler drip coffee makers I’ve owned in the past.  

**Drawbacks**  

Not everything is perfect. Let’s address some areas where this coffee maker stumbles.  

- The water reservoir markings can be hard to read without proper lighting.  
- Filter basket sometimes holds water even after draining, adding to cleaning time.  

**Cleaning and Maintenance**  

Maintaining this machine is straightforward. The ""Lift & Clean"" filter basket design streamlines the cleaning process—no complicated assembly to deal with. However, I noticed over time that even small water residue on the base can lead to staining. Using the auto-cleaning function every couple of weeks keeps everything fresh, which is something of a relief when juggling work and chores.  

**Product Rivals**  

Compared to other programmable coffee makers I’ve tested, this one holds its ground well. Machines like the Keurig K-Classic focus on single-serve versatility but don’t cater to larger batches like this one does. On the other hand, premium brands like Breville or Technivorm offer more refined brewing technology but at significantly higher price points. Where this coffee maker shines is balancing convenience, brewing quality, and affordability.  

**Value for Money**  

This coffee maker is precisely what I consider a good investment for the features it provides. Whether you’re brewing for one or twelve, it delivers consistently each time. Programs like Delay Brew, Auto Pause, and 4-hour Auto Shutoff justify its price point. While not a high-end device, it does an exceptional job at mimicking more expensive alternatives minus the financial sting.

TL;DR: I reconnected with a guy I casually dated. Things were going well until intimacy triggered a complete emotional shutdown. I’m trying to figure out if this was about feelings, guilt, or avoidant behavior.

I would love some insight because I’m really confused and feeling kind of discarded.

I was casually reconnecting with a guy I dated for a few months a while back. He was actively courting me. He got me flowers, little gifts, skincare, took me out to eat, spent entire days and nights with me, wanted to grab coffee and shop the next mornings. His actions genuinely felt thoughtful and intentional.

He asked me when I was leaving town as I am only here temporarily for work and I told him soon. He said the date was closer than he expected and he does not want to think about it. We agreed that we would enjoy the most of our time together casually hanging out He also talked about wanting to spend as much time as possible with me before I leave town. We had already made plans for our next outing together and talked about further plans. But every time I would gently bring up the fact that I’m leaving soon, he would immediately shut it down and ask me not to talk about it anymore.

But here’s where it gets weird.

After our last hangout 4th of July where we got intimate he suddenly panicked. Like, fully flipped a switch. He got up in the middle of everything, apologized over and over, said he needed to leave immediately, and started preaching about how we’re sinning and how he needs to repent. Telling me that he just randomly remember he has an important thing tomorrow and was saying how tomorrow is a special religious holiday he needs to abstain for. 

He also said the fireworks outside were triggering flashbacks from his home country. He was pacing, spiraling, and rushed out so fast it was like he was running from something.

I apologized that he was feeling scared and offered to sit and talk out of a sexual context about how he’s feeling. I apologized for feeling like I was tempting him and said so does this mean no more intimacy, he hesitates and says yes. I then tell him so I guess I wont hear from you again if you take out the sexual context there is not much tying in our connection. He then said well we if you do not want to talk to me anymore I respect that and do not need you in my life anymore anyways, the world is coming to an end and instead of sinning like this we should be repenting to God. He says he does not mind continuing to hangout with me even without sex as he enjoys our “dates”. He leaves almost forgets his shirt. 

I ask him if he got home safely, he then casually texted me like nothing had happened. Super light, super polite. No mention of the intense scene. It was honestly bizarre.

I reached out later asking for clarity because it all happened so fast, and he just explained that he was sorry for running out and leaving me hanging and that he wants to feel like we are in a relationship without the title even if it means not having sex anymore. Wed still spend the night, cuddle, go on dates, etc.

Has anyone experienced something like this? Is this avoidant behavior? Or is there something else going on that I’m missing? I’m genuinely trying to understand what happened. I told him it feels like he wants relationship benefits without the commitment of a relationship and that I am not okay with this dynamic anymore, as a result think its best we leave things where they are at and go out separate ways. He has begged me to allow him to make it up to me and says he wants to continue enjoying my company while I’m still in town even if its selfish on his part.",1,1752699571.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1m1oecv,https://www.reddit.com/r/bathandbodyworks/comments/1m1oecv/my_assessment_on_a_few_new_fragrances/,My assessment on a few new fragrances,"I’m on the west coast so we JUST got the new vanilla products & other stuff in stores. 

Vanilla Cafe - I like it. Smells like a mix of coffee, cream, and hazelnut. I would have preferred a stronger coffee smell, but I still like it. I’ll be buying some at the body care sale this weekend. 

Vanilla Ease - The lavender note hit me right off the bat, then the other notes came forward. It’s a nice soft smell, but the lavender has too much presence. Lavender makes me want to sleep lol. I’m going to pass on this fragrance. 

Between the two vanilla spinoffs above, I still think Vanilla Romance is the best. It just smells heavenly to me and I’ll never get tired of it. It also has more lasting power than most BBW fragrances. 

Milk - I’d never actually smelled this one before. It really does smell like milk, but also creamy. It almost reminds me of more natural smell, like a fresh clean baby. (lol weird analogy- i know).

Rich Espresso - It’s not rich at all. Not to my nose. I had high hopes for this one, but it’s so light! I could barely smell anything. If anything, it smelled like shea butter and chocolate. I couldn’t even really smell espresso. I looked at the bottle wondering what was wrong. I wanted to love it, but I could HARDLY even smell it. 

Glazed Pumpkin - Oooooo I like this one. It’s a sweet pumpkin smell and I love this for fall. Definitely gonna buy a few during the sale. 

Book Loft - I liked this better as a wallflower. The body care stuff made me smell older than I am. It’s a nice smell, but the body care didn’t sit right for me. 

I tried a few others but none were too remarkable. 
They have a whole bunch of new wallflowers and pocketbacs too. I’m excited for all the fall-smelling pumpkin and cinnamon stuff.

1m1o9tl,https://i.redd.it/428pjkyruadf1.jpeg,Herman will help me heal❤️,"I don't know if anyone will read this, but I'm mostly doing this for myself.
Today I brought home a small bumbumz plush coffee pot from a discount bin. I named him Herman. He’s odd, overlooked, and adorable in a weird way. I have tendencies toward OCD and perfectionism, and for a long time I’ve struggled to stick with things that feel “off” or not quite right. I’ve bought and swapped out a lot of plush friends in the past. Searching for the perfect one, the one that feels right. But this time, something in me was thinking:
What if I chose to stay with this one? What if it’s okay that he’s strange, that he’s a coffee pot, that he doesn’t match? So I brought him home. A little ridiculous, and somehow, maybe exactly what I need.

From today onward, I’m committing to documenting Herman’s daily life. Not because I think anyone needs to see it, but because I need to do it - as a daily act for myself of:
Showing up, practicing consistency, staying with something imperfect, and choosing connection over control.
I want to prove to myself that I can love something, and keep loving it. Even when my brain tells me I should buy a different one, and only then things can feel right again - That has never worked in the past.

So this is Day 1 of Herman’s life.
Let’s see where this strange little friendship takes us❤️

Would love any kind words, or if any of you have done something similar. Also, feel free to say hi to Herman🥰

In years past I’d always be the one organizing get togethers, inviting friends over for dinner and drinks and noticed that nobody else was caring as much as I was. I decided to take a step back and put in less effort thus I’d have less resentment when nobody else would put in zero in effort. It’s been crickets as far as anyone else taking initiative for actual plans in person.

My friends still send me reels often (even some about how hard it is to schedule friendship visits in your 30s and 40s)I also get the odd text about a tv show or when there’s something going on in their lives but not much else. I’m always everyone’s biggest cheerleader, inquire about their kids, their trips and I’m always their sound board when they need to vent about family issues or work drama etc. I also remember their kids on their birthdays and Christmas and make sure to find unique small gifts for them. That’s genuinely how I’m wired. When it comes to me, the friends I think are the closest to me rarely like my posts, they don’t ask about trips or my life. It almost seems like they make a point to NOT ask. My best friend and I could be travelling in the same month and I ask all about her trip, she tells me all the details but doesn’t ask about mine. I can be there for her through family stresses and check in three times a week and when I mention I have a family issue she doesn’t even say a word.

The issue I’m having right now is that I know everyone’s busy but it seems like I’m the only one who cares or values time and relationships. I feel like swinging by for a quick coffee isn’t something that needs to be planned weeks out nor should it feel like pulling teeth. I’ve looked inward to see if maybe I’m just not liked anymore however as mentioned, my friends send me reels, share pictures and vent to me all too often. It seems I’m there for them but nobody cares to DO happy, fun, positive things like actually visiting. 

One of my best friends always tells me to post pictures whenever I’m travelling and when I do she’s the first to view but never likes them. A few months ago I went to Europe and she asked me to post many pictures. She didn’t comment on any of them or hit like however she sent a PM to let me know she had the same dress as me in one of the photos. It seems like I’m the only person who cares about human connection and time going by fast and face to face visits.

Is anyone else noticing this? I live in a smaller city and wonder if this is a geographic thing where it’s harder to make NEW friends. I find myself clinging to old friendships even though they’ve become really hard and it seems like I’m the only one who cares I also live in a family friendly neighborhood so I find the Moms stick together as they have more in common with their kids being in the same classes and after school activities. Everyone is super nice to me but I’m childfree and the youngest homeowner and feel a little out of sorts with my neighbor friends. 

Is anyone else noticing things like this in their 30s? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

My name is Ander Webb, I attended a smaller public university in Louisiana, and it was my junior year. At the time I was a contracted cadet in ROTC (Reserved Officer Training Corps). My best friend and roommate Jin Schultz and I would take the freshmen under our wings and mentor them in military, personal, and academic matters. As a pair of currently enlisted Infantrymen, we felt it was our responsibility to look after the new cadets in the program. That fall we had a core group of mentee freshmen, Jake Gilbert, his new girlfriend Harley Caffery, Big Billy(we called him that as he was 6’2” 250-pound guy and a true gentle giant and I cannot remember his last name), and Barry Karnes.

Thursday October 29^(th).

ROTC leadership lab was winding down. Training was complete not that most of these cadets needed to know how to conduct the knockout a bunker battle drill, but maybe logistics officers and nurses would if guys like Jin and I were already dead, I guess.  The cadets were still laughing and commenting on the costumes from the battalion fun run that morning. A Hispanic cadet had painted intricate sugar skull on her face in honor of Día de los Muertos, one ginger cadet came as a fairy princess with tutu, wings, and a pink crown, who am I to judge, Big Billy came as an African warlord, borrowing my maroon Airborne beret to give a “Beasts of no Nation” vibe with the M81 field jacket he borrowed from Jin. Jake came as a famous Tennis player and oddly his girlfriend did not coordinate. Harley came as what looked like a witch drawing symbols on herself and being dressed in black robes. This led Senior Cadet Sarabeth Walker to talk to her off to the side, Walker was very concerned due to her deep Christian faith. Jin and I came as Raiden and Scorpion respectfully from Mortal Kombat as we played as them in our ROTC tournaments and I spammed the teleport move when we’d play Injustice. As the last squads finished their period of instruction, we fell into formation for the weekend safety brief. Cadet Battalion Commander Peason told us she loved the creativity from the costume run and was happy we took to her idea so enthusiastically. For the safety portion of the safety brief, she reminded us that even though majority of the cadets were civilians still, they should not get into trouble this weekend as that could bar them from contracting as a future officer in the Army.

“Don’t add or subtract from the local population, there done.” Whispered Jin next to me in formation loud enough our squad could hear but Cadet Pearson up front could not with 3 ranks between us and her. A handful of snorts of laughter responded from our squad and the squad in front of us as the cadets attempted to maintain military bearing.

“Or just don’t get caught.” I replied just for Jin’s ears.

We broke formation after the command to dismiss was given. Jin pulled our mentees aside as I stood next to him.

“Now we don’t care what y’all do this weekend but be safe and smart about it.” Jin started with a caring and authoritative tone.

“Stay with friends and keep a battle buddy, just cause y’all are under the age doesn’t mean we are under the illusion that you won’t be drinking, especially you Karnes, I know your frat has a costume party Saturday.” I said providing my observations of our Cadets’ social lives. Karnes gave a look of fain shock at the insinuation that he was drinking at 18.

Kwan jumped in as if we rehearsed this, we had not, we just spent so much time together we knew when to continue sentences. “If at any point you are in trouble and need a QRF to come save your asses, call me or Webb and we will be there in 7 minutes to anywhere in town or on Campus.”

“Other than that, have a good Halloween this Saturday and see y’all Monday morning for PT.” I concluded just in time as Cadet Walker came over.

“Cadet Webb, Cadet Schultz, Mr. Clark asked me to have you two maintenance and hook up the new propane tank to the grill behind the armory.” She asked in her firm polite way when she would hide her meek nature.

“Of course, he asked for us.” I laughed. “Jin and I always get the ‘hey you tasks’.”

“You two are probably the most reliable and capable cadets we have on campus Ander.” She said dropping the formality to the caring way that reminded me when we were close.

Jin turned to us after our mentees left and headed to their cars, “Hey Walker, do you care if Webb comes over Saturday when Annalee and I hang out?”

“Of course not, we can all hang out and watch some scary movies.” If she had any objections to me coming over, she did not show it. Jin was dating Sarabeth’s older sister Annalee. Sarabeth and I had dated at the end of the previous semester. I had spent the past months getting over being sent back to the friendzone by her before our summer apart due to military training. I knew it was over, she was dating a guy 12 years older than us from the city an hour north of campus that was an overly charismatic Christian that made my lukewarm faith look like more heathen than any form of holy. But the continued texting and overly friendly contact for 5 months since break up made me want to be a better man. Mixed signals are an understatement.

Sarabeth left the armory while Jin and I cleaned the grill and installed the new propane tank to the old gas grill behind the armory that had been in disrepair since we started attending school two years before. Gave it a good test fire with my zippo to ensure it was working too for good measure, the next home game for the football team was in two weeks and we did not want our work to be in vain when the program would be feeding the cadets and veterans at the upcoming Veterans Day game. We jabbed each other with jokes about everything under the sun as we drove to our apartment across from the campus before cracking open a few Yuengling’s and fired up our Xbox’s for a late night of COD Black Ops II Zombies, and Battlefield 4.

Thus Thursday night went.

Friday October 30^(th).

Friday, I had a couple of classes Roman, and Medieval history and Jin’s Engineering program after which another night of drinking and gaming, as Jin texted Annalee and I just tried to enjoy the night.

Saturday October 31^(st).

The day was about as normal as Halloween in a Louisiana college town could be, 75 degrees and 100% humidity. Jin and I went to Walmart across town to get some food to bring to the Walker sister’s house and liquor to relax with. We were checking out when we saw Harley checking out with what looked like a cutting board some craft supplies.

“I can’t believe you tried to sleep with her bro.” I jabbed at Jin.

“I can’t either, I wasn’t thinking with my head.” Jin retorted as he bagged the bottle of Jameson from the casher, the “good stuff” our meager Sergeants pay would allow.

“You were, just the wrong one.” I chided back. Jin gave a hearty chuckle at that.

Later that evening we drove my 1997 Ford Explorer over to the Walkers house, a small weathered white house on cinderblocks. Jin and Annalee embraced while Sarabeth and I took the food and drinks to the kitchen in the back.

The evening was enjoyable, played some Settlers of Catan, the flirtation between Jin and Annalee was hilarious. Sarabeth was on the phone with her boyfriend for most of the evening, while she did that and the happy couple cleaned the dishes together I took the trash to the curb. I considered grabbing my small pocket Bible out of the center console of my car to appear more pious but decided that was a hollow useless thing to do. After Sarabeth finishing her phone call, she suggested that we watch Sleepy Hallow with Johnny Depp. I was apparently the only person that had not seen it, the only horror movie I had seen before was The Exorcist, I did not like scary movies at the time. My male bravado told me to just suck it up as the movie begun. Looking back, I was such a little bitch for thinking Sleepy Hallow would be scary, underrated Tim Burton movie honestly. Jin and Annalee cuddled on the couch as I ceded the recliner to Sarabeth and pulled up and dining room chair. The movie was enjoyable, Casper Van Dean had just died on screen (RIP Johnny Rico) when Jin got a phone call, it was around 2200.

He stood up and responded with, “Hey Big Billy, what up bro?” as he rounded the corner of the living room into the kitchen out of earshot. Annalee paused the movie expecting that we would continue it momentarily.

All I heard over Jins pacing was “Wait what? How… what’s that sound? We are coming.”

He strode back into the living room with the grim determination that our profession beat into us, the tone was all business.

“Webb up.”

“What’s going on bud?” I responded as I stood up with the sense of urgency that was felt throughout the room.

“Big Billy called, somethings wrong at Harley’s apartment, I’ll brief you enroute.” Jin’s switch from puppy love to mission ready in a second flat, I felt that unease from the beginning of the night and something was up. He turned to Annalee and told her everything is ok and we just needed to teach the freshmen about the importance pacing themselves at Frat parties. Sarabeth offered a couple bottles of Pedialyte she had for after ruck marches.

“Its ok I don’t think its needed.” Jin responded politely. I knew he was hiding something from the girls.

I told Sarabeth bye and she grabbed my arm and said, “There is something wrong with this, please be safe.”

I felt my skin tighten as I stood in the doorway as if I was in a freezer, not in the humid night that is the American South.

“I have a weird feeling too but it’s probably just a Jake or Harley discovering Everclear, see you soon.”

Jin and I walked to my car with purpose through the still muggy night, I turned my head and could see both sisters standing in the doorway with the look of concern on their faces. Once in my rundown Explorer turned over, I firmly asked, “What are we getting into?”

Jin let a short exhale out and looked at me with a level of concern that I only saw the past summer during the Red River floods when we were activated for high water rescue.

“Head to Harley’s apartment with urgency once we make the corner and are out of sight, don’t scare the girls.”

I put the car in drive and headed to the intersection then gunned it down University Boulevard towards the side of the campus that Harley lived in.

He continued, “Big Billy is at Harley’s apartment trying to help Jake, Barry is leaving his frats party to help him but its… weird.”

“What’s weird?”

“You got your Bible?”

“Yeah, why?”

“Harley built a Ouija board after we saw her at Walmart this morning and wanted to have some fun with it and Jake thought it would be a fun way to hangout on Halloween. She’s acting strange and Jake’s freaking out and Big Billy is out of his depth.”

I knew this was not a joke. On school breaks and between National Guard training and natural disasters during the summers I worked at Target stocking shelves. There the infamous Ouija boards are sold for ages 8 and up. They would be found in the morning having fallen off the shelf and routinely throughout the day laying on the ground. Both Jin and I were raised by Christian families that instilled in us an understanding of how things like that could open a door that could not be easily closed. Both of us might have lived a heathen lifestyle as young grunts but our upbringing still held, and his Korean mother taught him to avoid the supernatural as one’s soul is easy to lose to other worldly forces.

“What was the weird noise on the phone?” I inquired.

“I don't know.” Jin responded with grim determination.

As we were speeding across campus Jin scanned locations Campus Police were known to sit and wait. I silently hoped they were busy at Greek row and not over by the dorms.

We parked in the first open spot we could find inside the gated dorms 500 feet from Harley’s. I grabbed my Bible from the car putting it in my back pocket and followed Jin to Harley’s Dorm which was on the second floor and closest to the stairs that access the floor. As we approached, we could hear screaming, we looked at each other with hesitance. We were trained to charge into combat but the screams of a girl and the possibility of an God knows what gave us pause, then we knocked.

The screaming stopped. We knocked again, and heard footsteps approach from behind the door and Big Billy opened it looking exhausted and color drained from his face.

“Guys you’re here, she just stopped fucking screaming and…” Billy rambled off without a breath.

“When, where, and how did this start.” I interrupted.

He pointed at the coffee table that was covered with a handful of crosses and crucifixes. “Harley wanted to summon a ghost and Jake, and I played along with it. That was 30 minutes before I called y’all. Nothing happened until she drew symbols on her arm like she did for the costume run on Thursday. After that, the room got cold, and Harley started acting weird…”

 “Weird how, details Billy.” Interrupted Jin.

I could hear Jake in the bedroom talking to Harley with no responses.

“Umm she started to shake then eyes rolled for a couple seconds,” Billy gathered his thoughts, “she then stood up and took the board outside and we did not see where she went. Then she came back and fucking freaked out, she started screaming and muttering some shit Jake and couldn’t understand. She then hit Jake and started to look for something in the kitchen.”

“Jin go check the room with Jake.” I commanded, Jin moved immediately. “Why are there crosses on the table?”

“Jake told me to grab whatever I could to repel whatever was summoned since that’s where it happened.” Billy responded.

A loud scream and impact came from the bedroom; I rushed in with Billy behind me to see Jake standing in the corner with terror on his face and Jin slumped against the wall as if he just got hit by a linebacker. Harley stood next to her bed all 5’1” and 98 pounds of her recoiling after what looked like a shotput throw.

“Harley where is the board?” I asked in a calm authoritative voice.

“*None of your concern*.” She responded with an unnatural tone compared to her normal docile voice.

Thinking quickly as Jin stood back up, seeing Harleys keys in her right sweatpants pocket, I took a chance asking, “Is it in your car?”

She turned her attention directly to me with a rage in her eyes that confirmed my hunch. Jin saw this too and we knew what came next. Under normal circumstances Jin and my 6’3” 200-pound physiques would easily overpower Harley, but as Jin already found out she was stronger than her body should be, she failed every event on the physical fitness test we had taken a month ago which we were helping her improve on. This was going to hurt.

“We need her keys, don’t try to hurt her.” I ordered the men in the room with me, and they understood as Big Billy and Jin lunged at Harley taking an arm each, that was before she tossed Billy off like he was a discarded towel, Jin’s attempt found purchase as he had grasped her left arm, the arm with the strange markings. Jake followed in Billys wake jumping over him as he clung to her right arm. I moved quickly, covering the 8 feet between myself and Harley to body check her into the bed to give us the advantage in this most bizarre struggle. Thinking the upper hand was gained I felt two feet plant on my chest and before I could comprehend what she was doing I was airborne and flew 6 feet landing feet, ass, head on the dorm room’s cheap carpet that did little to soften the uncontrolled fall. Billy, already up rushing past me to achieve control of her legs as I recovered. There was something else at work here. I pushed between Jake and Billy and plunged my hand into her right pants pocket gripping hold of the car keys.

“Got them!” I bellowed, and Jin immediately let go of her arm and we rushed for the door out. Behind us I heard two loud collisions, one against a wall and one I saw the result of, Big Billy once again thrown to the ground. I tossed Harley’s keys to Jin as he passed me in the doorway with him giving me a nod of understanding. He was halfway down the stairs when I vaulted myself over the railing to make up any lost time as I could hear the screams coming for us. Landing as I was trained to as a paratrooper feet, thigh, back and with a roll to keep the momentum I saw Harley coming for me like an predator that was to overwhelm its prey. The atmosphere was no longer still, the trees were being whipped by high winds and the howling was audible like in a thunderstorm. In fully sprint with her gaining I caught sight of Barry coming around the Dorm buildings corner.

“What the fucks going on I was hitting it off with a...” He called with an annoyed tone. He must’ve not been given the situation from Big Billy.

“Fucking run!” I bellowed back as I approached him.

He saw Harley giving chase and caught on as he attempted to catch up to me.

“Double back to her apartment help the guys.” I ordered as we were almost to my car. He split off as Harley stopped 20 feet from me as I slid into my driver’s seat. She screamed a throaty and gut-wrenching bellow that made me wish I had more than a pocketknife on me. She turned and took off in the direction Jin took towards what I assessed to be her car and the infernal Ouija board. I pulled out of the parking space driving parallel to her new direction of pursuit. There was a block of apartment style dorms between us, but I was betting on Jin taking an obscured route back to my car for exfil. I was right our mutual base level instincts brought him directly to me. I stopped and Jin carrying what to any casual observer looked to be a cutting board quickly jumped in the passenger seat.

“Fucking drive bro!” He yelled mere feet from my face as I looked past him and saw the petite figure was 40 feet behind him in relentless pursuit bellowing the same primal roar as before. We took off and whatever being was watching over us must have had some pity on us as the gate was open allowing us to get out of the confined parting lot and on to the street.

“What the fuck was that about? This can’t be what I think it is.” Jin said between labored breaths.

“I am scared it is exactly that, but I am having a really hard time believing it.” I said in response between my own attempts at catching my breath. “Call the Walkers, ask if we can come back and if they have an idea of what to do with this thing, they go to church way more than us.”

Jin dialed Annalee and she picked up on the second ring, “Hey, all’s good.” He lied. “Do y’all mind if we come back over, we have a Ouija board that needs to be destroyed.”

I could hear the shock and rejection of that proposal without the phone being on speaker. Jin tried to argue with what sounded like both sisters as I drove around campus waiting on a plan to form.

“Ok, yeah prayers would be great, and I think we can do that, thanks bye baby.” Jin said finishing the call. “Well, they don’t want this shit anywhere near them and said their only knowledge of the matter is to burn it and bury the ashes.”

I turned on the next street I saw and without saying a word headed to the ROTC armory.

“Ding”

“Great Harley’s texting me.” Jin said sarcastically opening his phone. “It says ‘*Do not destroy it, bring it back, you cannot stop what we started.*’ Well that’s concerning.”

I nodded to the phone, “She’s talking in plural now?”

Jin replied with a puzzled reaction reading the latest text, “’*I will not be banished by you, she’s mine.’* Bro what fucked up Supernatural episode are we in?”

“I don’t know bud.” I replied as I pulled sloppily into the lower parking lot of the ROTC Armory.

We rushed up the stairs that connected the parking lot to the porch with the grill. Jin pulled the cover off and tossed me the lighter fluid and I started spraying it on the board.

“Bro there’s no lighter, and she’s calling.” Jin lamented, the pressure was getting to him, I was on edge too.

“Don’t answer her. I’ve got mine in the car.” I responded as I ran down the hill to retrieve my Zippo.

The cacophony of text message notifications and phone call rings could be heard both up and down the hill as the desperation could be felt from whatever Harley had become to get the board back. Jin had placed the board on the grill rack, I could smell the lighter fluid, and he crouched down ready to turn on the gas as I flicked the lighter and held the flame next to the board.

It did not light.

“What to ever loving fuck!” Jin shouted in disbelief. He looked at his phone and read. “*I see you.*” We turned to our west and we could see her dorm a half a mile away across the cross-country track and we realized we had minutes from her arriving if she headed this way.

“Call the guys and tell them keep her distracted.” I told Jin as I gathered pine straw off the ground. He did so and reported, “They see her, and they will keep her from the gate on this side of the dorms, hopefully she can’t jump 15-foot fences.”

With my improvised torch of pine straw, I lit it protecting it from the wind and the flame started, Jin turned the knob on the grill and the propane lite.

The broad still wouldn’t light.

“Ander,” Jin said in frustration barely above a whisper the wind nearly drowned out, “how?”

We stared at the unburnt board, and I pulled out my Bible that was now covered in sweat to and moist to the touch after being in my jeans for the past 15 minutes of chaos and flipped through it blindly for something I did not know what. I landed seemingly at random on Matthew 6:9.

I opened my mouth seeing the red text, “Our Father…”

Immediately with the rage of a wildfire the board erupted into flame. Jin threw the grills lid closed singeing some arm hair in the process.

With a reaction that displayed exhaustion, surprise, and relief he told me, “Keep reading.”

So, I read the rest of the Lords Prayer, the Beatitudes, Psalm 23, and anything with red text that caught my eye over the sound of the hollowing wind.

After two minutes we opened the lid.

The wood that was the board was charcoal and the vinyl letters that had been glued on melted away, except for the bottom portion that was still perfectly in place but just as blackened and cracked as the rest of the wood, it read “*GOODBYE*.”

I took my knife out, striking downward with the butt of my knife, the board shattered into ash.

“Ding”

Jin looked down at his phone as the wind died down to the calm the night was less than 30 minutes ago. “Harley texted and said, ‘thanks for destroying it.’ How does she know that you just destroyed it?”

“No clue.” I shrugged not wanting to say what I believed in my soul it really was.

We gathered the ashes and buried them in the roots of a tree that fell over during the last hurricane. Called Big Billy after Barry and Jake had not answered, he happily reported Jake was asleep on the couch in their dorm and Harley passed out after the wind stopped and they put her in her own bed and tucked a cross next to her for good measure. Barry apparently went back to his frat party and might be drunk. The Walker sisters were glad we were ok as we left most of the details out. We drove back to our apartment while telling them goodnight over the phone. We got into the apartment and Jin collapsed on to the couch while I walked over to the counter and grabbed the bottle of Jameson, which Jin upon seeing that reached his hand out in a “bring it here” motion. He opened it and took a long swig as I sunk into the couch next to him. He handed me the bottle, and I took my own deep chug of whiskey.

“Dude I do not know what just happened, lets just forget all of it.” Jin said all energy drained from his voice and demeanor.

“I think it was something very bad.” I responded.

“This shit only happens in horror movies, not in reality.”

“We just saw all that and you’re saying we didn’t experience it?”

The bottle was being passed back and forth like a reverse talking stick.

 “Either way I am going to get drunk and forget about this night.” Jin responded.

“Well I’ll join you in that endeavor brother. Also I think I’m Sam and your Dean.”

“Bet.” Jin replied with his characteristic mischievous nature finally returning.

We finished the bottle and passed out into our separate rooms. From that night nobody talked about it or remembered the details of the night. The Walker sisters did not pry into what we did or what happened to cause an impromptu burning of a Ouija board. Jake and Harley continued dating, why we did not know, but we made plenty of crazy girl jokes as to that. But they never revisited the events of that Halloween night. Jin, to the last day we ever talked in 2020 denied the events of that night ever happened.

This period of time that only I recall makes me more concerned and suspicious regarding the nature of what came through the door that was opened that night.

My name is Ander Webb, I attended a smaller public university in Louisiana, and it was my junior year. At the time I was a contracted cadet in ROTC (Reserved Officer Training Corps). My best friend and roommate Jin Schultz and I would take the freshmen under our wings and mentor them in military, personal, and academic matters. As a pair of currently enlisted Infantrymen, we felt it was our responsibility to look after the new cadets in the program. That fall we had a core group of mentee freshmen, Jake Gilbert, his new girlfriend Harley Caffery, Big Billy(we called him that as he was 6’2” 250-pound guy and a true gentle giant and I cannot remember his last name), and Barry Karnes.

Thursday October 29^(th).

ROTC leadership lab was winding down. Training was complete not that most of these cadets needed to know how to conduct the knockout a bunker battle drill, but maybe logistics officers and nurses would if guys like Jin and I were already dead, I guess.  The cadets were still laughing and commenting on the costumes from the battalion fun run that morning. A Hispanic cadet had painted intricate sugar skull on her face in honor of Día de los Muertos, one ginger cadet came as a fairy princess with tutu, wings, and a pink crown, who am I to judge, Big Billy came as an African warlord, borrowing my maroon Airborne beret to give a “Beasts of no Nation” vibe with the M81 field jacket he borrowed from Jin. Jake came as a famous Tennis player and oddly his girlfriend did not coordinate. Harley came as what looked like a witch drawing symbols on herself and being dressed in black robes. This led Senior Cadet Sarabeth Walker to talk to her off to the side, Walker was very concerned due to her deep Christian faith. Jin and I came as Raiden and Scorpion respectfully from Mortal Kombat as we played as them in our ROTC tournaments and I spammed the teleport move when we’d play Injustice. As the last squads finished their period of instruction, we fell into formation for the weekend safety brief. Cadet Battalion Commander Peason told us she loved the creativity from the costume run and was happy we took to her idea so enthusiastically. For the safety portion of the safety brief, she reminded us that even though majority of the cadets were civilians still, they should not get into trouble this weekend as that could bar them from contracting as a future officer in the Army.

“Don’t add or subtract from the local population, there done.” Whispered Jin next to me in formation loud enough our squad could hear but Cadet Pearson up front could not with 3 ranks between us and her. A handful of snorts of laughter responded from our squad and the squad in front of us as the cadets attempted to maintain military bearing.

“Or just don’t get caught.” I replied just for Jin’s ears.

We broke formation after the command to dismiss was given. Jin pulled our mentees aside as I stood next to him.

“Now we don’t care what y’all do this weekend but be safe and smart about it.” Jin started with a caring and authoritative tone.

“Stay with friends and keep a battle buddy, just cause y’all are under the age doesn’t mean we are under the illusion that you won’t be drinking, especially you Karnes, I know your frat has a costume party Saturday.” I said providing my observations of our Cadets’ social lives. Karnes gave a look of fain shock at the insinuation that he was drinking at 18.

Kwan jumped in as if we rehearsed this, we had not, we just spent so much time together we knew when to continue sentences. “If at any point you are in trouble and need a QRF to come save your asses, call me or Webb and we will be there in 7 minutes to anywhere in town or on Campus.”

“Other than that, have a good Halloween this Saturday and see y’all Monday morning for PT.” I concluded just in time as Cadet Walker came over.

“Cadet Webb, Cadet Schultz, Mr. Clark asked me to have you two maintenance and hook up the new propane tank to the grill behind the armory.” She asked in her firm polite way when she would hide her meek nature.

“Of course, he asked for us.” I laughed. “Jin and I always get the ‘hey you tasks’.”

“You two are probably the most reliable and capable cadets we have on campus Ander.” She said dropping the formality to the caring way that reminded me when we were close.

Jin turned to us after our mentees left and headed to their cars, “Hey Walker, do you care if Webb comes over Saturday when Annalee and I hang out?”

“Of course not, we can all hang out and watch some scary movies.” If she had any objections to me coming over, she did not show it. Jin was dating Sarabeth’s older sister Annalee. Sarabeth and I had dated at the end of the previous semester. I had spent the past months getting over being sent back to the friendzone by her before our summer apart due to military training. I knew it was over, she was dating a guy 12 years older than us from the city an hour north of campus that was an overly charismatic Christian that made my lukewarm faith look like more heathen than any form of holy. But the continued texting and overly friendly contact for 5 months since break up made me want to be a better man. Mixed signals are an understatement.

Sarabeth left the armory while Jin and I cleaned the grill and installed the new propane tank to the old gas grill behind the armory that had been in disrepair since we started attending school two years before. Gave it a good test fire with my zippo to ensure it was working too for good measure, the next home game for the football team was in two weeks and we did not want our work to be in vain when the program would be feeding the cadets and veterans at the upcoming Veterans Day game. We jabbed each other with jokes about everything under the sun as we drove to our apartment across from the campus before cracking open a few Yuengling’s and fired up our Xbox’s for a late night of COD Black Ops II Zombies, and Battlefield 4.

Thus Thursday night went.

Friday October 30^(th).

Friday, I had a couple of classes Roman, and Medieval history and Jin’s Engineering program after which another night of drinking and gaming, as Jin texted Annalee and I just tried to enjoy the night.

Saturday October 31^(st).

The day was about as normal as Halloween in a Louisiana college town could be, 75 degrees and 100% humidity. Jin and I went to Walmart across town to get some food to bring to the Walker sister’s house and liquor to relax with. We were checking out when we saw Harley checking out with what looked like a cutting board some craft supplies.

“I can’t believe you tried to sleep with her bro.” I jabbed at Jin.

“I can’t either, I wasn’t thinking with my head.” Jin retorted as he bagged the bottle of Jameson from the casher, the “good stuff” our meager Sergeants pay would allow.

“You were, just the wrong one.” I chided back. Jin gave a hearty chuckle at that.

Later that evening we drove my 1997 Ford Explorer over to the Walkers house, a small weathered white house on cinderblocks. Jin and Annalee embraced while Sarabeth and I took the food and drinks to the kitchen in the back.

My male bravado told me to just suck it up as the movie begun. Looking back, I was such a little bitch for thinking Sleepy Hallow would be scary, underrated Tim Burton movie honestly. Jin and Annalee cuddled on the couch as I ceded the recliner to Sarabeth and pulled up and dining room chair. The movie was enjoyable, Casper Van Dean had just died on screen (RIP Johnny Rico) when Jin got a phone call, it was around 2200.

He stood up and responded with, “Hey Big Billy, what up bro?” as he rounded the corner of the living room into the kitchen out of earshot. Annalee paused the movie expecting that we would continue it momentarily.

All I heard over Jins pacing was “Wait what? How… what’s that sound? We are coming.”

He strode back into the living room with the grim determination that our profession beat into us, the tone was all business.

“Webb up.”

“What’s going on bud?” I responded as I stood up with the sense of urgency that was felt throughout the room.

“Big Billy called, somethings wrong at Harley’s apartment, I’ll brief you enroute.” Jin’s switch from puppy love to mission ready in a second flat, I felt that unease from the beginning of the night and something was up. He turned to Annalee and told her everything is ok and we just needed to teach the freshmen about the importance pacing themselves at Frat parties. Sarabeth offered a couple bottles of Pedialyte she had for after ruck marches.

I put the car in drive and headed to the intersection then gunned it down University Boulevard towards the side of the campus that Harley lived in.

He continued, “Big Billy is at Harley’s apartment trying to help Jake, Barry is leaving his frats party to help him but its… weird.”

“What’s weird?”

“You got your Bible?”

“Yeah, why?”

“Harley built a Ouija board after we saw her at Walmart this morning and wanted to have some fun with it and Jake thought it would be a fun way to hangout on Halloween. She’s acting strange and Jake’s freaking out and Big Billy is out of his depth.”

I knew this was not a joke. On school breaks and between National Guard training and natural disasters during the summers I worked at Target stocking shelves.

Thinking the upper hand was gained I felt two feet plant on my chest and before I could comprehend what she was doing I was airborne and flew 6 feet landing feet, ass, head on the dorm room’s cheap carpet that did little to soften the uncontrolled fall. Billy, already up rushing past me to achieve control of her legs as I recovered. There was something else at work here. I pushed between Jake and Billy and plunged my hand into her right pants pocket gripping hold of the car keys.

“Got them!” I bellowed, and Jin immediately let go of her arm and we rushed for the door out. Behind us I heard two loud collisions, one against a wall and one I saw the result of, Big Billy once again thrown to the ground. I tossed Harley’s keys to Jin as he passed me in the doorway with him giving me a nod of understanding. He was halfway down the stairs when I vaulted myself over the railing to make up any lost time as I could hear the screams coming for us. Landing as I was trained to as a paratrooper feet, thigh, back and with a roll to keep the momentum I saw Harley coming for me like an predator that was to overwhelm its prey. The atmosphere was no longer still, the trees were being whipped by high winds and the howling was audible like in a thunderstorm. In fully sprint with her gaining I caught sight of Barry coming around the Dorm buildings corner.

“What the fucks going on I was hitting it off with a...” He called with an annoyed tone. He must’ve not been given the situation from Big Billy.

“Fucking run!” I bellowed back as I approached him.

He saw Harley giving chase and caught on as he attempted to catch up to me.

“Double back to her apartment help the guys.” I ordered as we were almost to my car. He split off as Harley stopped 20 feet from me as I slid into my driver’s seat. She screamed a throaty and gut-wrenching bellow that made me wish I had more than a pocketknife on me. She turned and took off in the direction Jin took towards what I assessed to be her car and the infernal Ouija board. I pulled out of the parking space driving parallel to her new direction of pursuit. There was a block of apartment style dorms between us, but I was betting on Jin taking an obscured route back to my car for exfil. I was right our mutual base level instincts brought him directly to me. I stopped and Jin carrying what to any casual observer looked to be a cutting board quickly jumped in the passenger seat.

“Fucking drive bro!” He yelled mere feet from my face as I looked past him and saw the petite figure was 40 feet behind him in relentless pursuit bellowing the same primal roar as before. We took off and whatever being was watching over us must have had some pity on us as the gate was open allowing us to get out of the confined parting lot and on to the street.

“What the fuck was that about? This can’t be what I think it is.” Jin said between labored breaths.

“I am scared it is exactly that, but I am having a really hard time believing it.” I said in response between my own attempts at catching my breath. “Call the Walkers, ask if we can come back and if they have an idea of what to do with this thing, they go to church way more than us.”

Jin dialed Annalee and she picked up on the second ring, “Hey, all’s good.” He lied. “Do y’all mind if we come back over, we have a Ouija board that needs to be destroyed.”

I could hear the shock and rejection of that proposal without the phone being on speaker. Jin tried to argue with what sounded like both sisters as I drove around campus waiting on a plan to form.

“Ok, yeah prayers would be great, and I think we can do that, thanks bye baby.” Jin said finishing the call. “Well, they don’t want this shit anywhere near them and said their only knowledge of the matter is to burn it and bury the ashes.”

I turned on the next street I saw and without saying a word headed to the ROTC armory.

“Ding”

“Great Harley’s texting me.” Jin said sarcastically opening his phone. “It says ‘*Do not destroy it, bring it back, you cannot stop what we started.*’ Well that’s concerning.”

I nodded to the phone, “She’s talking in plural now?”

Jin replied with a puzzled reaction reading the latest text, “’*I will not be banished by you, she’s mine.’* Bro what fucked up Supernatural episode are we in?”

“I don’t know bud.” I replied as I pulled sloppily into the lower parking lot of the ROTC Armory.

We rushed up the stairs that connected the parking lot to the porch with the grill. Jin pulled the cover off and tossed me the lighter fluid and I started spraying it on the board.

“Bro there’s no lighter, and she’s calling.” Jin lamented, the pressure was getting to him, I was on edge too.

“Don’t answer her. I’ve got mine in the car.” I responded as I ran down the hill to retrieve my Zippo.

The cacophony of text message notifications and phone call rings could be heard both up and down the hill as the desperation could be felt from whatever Harley had become to get the board back. Jin had placed the board on the grill rack, I could smell the lighter fluid, and he crouched down ready to turn on the gas as I flicked the lighter and held the flame next to the board.

It did not light.

“What to ever loving fuck!” Jin shouted in disbelief. He looked at his phone and read. “*I see you.*” We turned to our west and we could see her dorm a half a mile away across the cross-country track and we realized we had minutes from her arriving if she headed this way.

“Call the guys and tell them keep her distracted.” I told Jin as I gathered pine straw off the ground. He did so and reported, “They see her, and they will keep her from the gate on this side of the dorms, hopefully she can’t jump 15-foot fences.”

With my improvised torch of pine straw, I lit it protecting it from the wind and the flame started, Jin turned the knob on the grill and the propane lite.

The broad still wouldn’t light.

“Ander,” Jin said in frustration barely above a whisper the wind nearly drowned out, “how?”

We stared at the unburnt board, and I pulled out my Bible that was now covered in sweat to and moist to the touch after being in my jeans for the past 15 minutes of chaos and flipped through it blindly for something I did not know what. I landed seemingly at random on Matthew 6:9.

I opened my mouth seeing the red text, “Our Father…”

Immediately with the rage of a wildfire the board erupted into flame. Jin threw the grills lid closed singeing some arm hair in the process.

With a reaction that displayed exhaustion, surprise, and relief he told me, “Keep reading.”

So, I read the rest of the Lords Prayer, the Beatitudes, Psalm 23, and anything with red text that caught my eye over the sound of the hollowing wind.

After two minutes we opened the lid.

The wood that was the board was charcoal and the vinyl letters that had been glued on melted away, except for the bottom portion that was still perfectly in place but just as blackened and cracked as the rest of the wood, it read “*GOODBYE*.”

I took my knife out, striking downward with the butt of my knife, the board shattered into ash.

“Ding”

Jin looked down at his phone as the wind died down to the calm the night was less than 30 minutes ago. “Harley texted and said, ‘thanks for destroying it.’ How does she know that you just destroyed it?”

“No clue.” I shrugged not wanting to say what I believed in my soul it really was.

We gathered the ashes and buried them in the roots of a tree that fell over during the last hurricane. Called Big Billy after Barry and Jake had not answered, he happily reported Jake was asleep on the couch in their dorm and Harley passed out after the wind stopped and they put her in her own bed and tucked a cross next to her for good measure. Barry apparently went back to his frat party and might be drunk. The Walker sisters were glad we were ok as we left most of the details out. We drove back to our apartment while telling them goodnight over the phone. We got into the apartment and Jin collapsed on to the couch while I walked over to the counter and grabbed the bottle of Jameson, which Jin upon seeing that reached his hand out in a “bring it here” motion. He opened it and took a long swig as I sunk into the couch next to him. He handed me the bottle, and I took my own deep chug of whiskey.

“Dude I do not know what just happened, lets just forget all of it.” Jin said all energy drained from his voice and demeanor.

“I think it was something very bad.” I responded.

“This shit only happens in horror movies, not in reality.”

“We just saw all that and you’re saying we didn’t experience it?”

The bottle was being passed back and forth like a reverse talking stick.

 “Either way I am going to get drunk and forget about this night.” Jin responded.

“Well I’ll join you in that endeavor brother. Also I think I’m Sam and your Dean.”

“Bet.” Jin replied with his characteristic mischievous nature finally returning.

We finished the bottle and passed out into our separate rooms. From that night nobody talked about it or remembered the details of the night. The Walker sisters did not pry into what we did or what happened to cause an impromptu burning of a Ouija board. Jake and Harley continued dating, why we did not know, but we made plenty of crazy girl jokes as to that. But they never revisited the events of that Halloween night. Jin, to the last day we ever talked in 2020 denied the events of that night ever happened.

This period of time that only I recall makes me more concerned and suspicious regarding the nature of what came through the door that was opened that night.

I’ve always believed in the motto “if it ain’t permanent, I don’t want it at all”, so I skipped the whole relationship phase during college. Been focusing on life, career, etc., a year ago I was browsing through an arranged marriage app.

I came across a profile that genuinely caught my attention felt like an interesting connectio — something just clicked. Did the usual search online (don’t judge lol), and it turns out she was actually a junior at my college, same field.

I sent her a follow request on Insta, but it wasn’t accepted. I don’t blame her — my profile’s private, profile pic is some random sports person, although we had few mutuals. Plus, I don’t recall us ever really interacting in college.

Now, here’s where I need advice. There's a event coming up soon where she might also be present again. I’m considering striking up a conversation — something casual like “Hey, you look familiar, were you in XYZ college?” Just to keep it chill and not let the stalker vibes show lol.

But I’m torn after that.

She seems to come from a fairly traditional family (Swaminarayan, modest background etc but not too strict I assume), so I'm wondering:
Should I just try to establish a basic connection and maybe suggest something like coffee or a quick meet-up if she seems open to it?

OR

Should I not risk coming off as too forward, and instead ask my parents to approach hers via the arranged marriage route — especially given her (assumed) traditional family setup?

**\~+\~+\~CHAPTER SUMMARIES\~+\~+\~**

**CHAPTER 6 - THE THROWING NETS:**  After an hour of walking around London, Lyra stops at a cart for a cup of coffee and a sandwich.  A man offers to pay and also to put brandy in her coffee.  For warmth. *(Yep, we totally believe you, dude.)*  Smartly, Lyra makes up a lie about meeting her dad before scampering away.  

**Creepy Dude:**  Hi, little girl, want some liquor?

**Lyra**: I'm just waiting for my dad. He's a murderer.

**CD:** You're funny! Want to get in my van? I have candy!

**L:**  There's dear old dad, covered in blood like usual. I should go help him do the laundry before those stains set. 

**CD:**  Rats! If it wasn't for that pesky kid and her dæmon…

Down near the canal, Lyra is almost captured by two *other* men who have a throwing net. *(London, you have a major kidnapping problem on your hands. Someone should maybe look into all the strange men lurking in the shadows.)* She is rescued by the Costas, a gyptian family she knows from Oxford!  They kill the men who netted her, cut her free, and escape on their canal boat.  Ma Costa comforts and cares for Lyra.  The next morning, Tony (the recently-abducted-Billy's brother) and Lyra exchange information.  She tells him everything she knows (except about the alethiometer) and he fills her in about the gyptians and the menaces of the North. The gyptians are planning to rescue the children who have been kidnapped, and Lyra wants to help so she can rescue Roger. (And also her uncle, who is a prisoner of the armored bears.)

**CHAPTER 7 - JOHN FAA:**  Lyra is being hunted down, so the Costa family keep her hidden until they reach the Zaal, where all the gyptian families meet.  In the main hall, the heads of the six gyptian families and John Faa, the leader of the western gyptians, gather on the stage along with Farder Coram, an elderly [seer](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seers).  John Faa announces that the gyptians will continue to protect Lyra.  They are asking families to collect a tax to fund the rescue mission, and they will set free the non-gyptian captives as well.  Then, Lyra meets with John Faa and Farder Coram.  She tells them everything she remembers, and John Faa explains her actual family history.  Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter are her real parents, but Mrs. Coulter was married to someone else when Lyra was born, so Lyra was given to a gyptian woman to be cared for.  This turns out to be Ma Costa!  Mrs. Coulter's husband discovered the truth and Lord Asriel fought with him and killed him.  The courts got involved and placed Lyra with nuns, which angered Lord Asriel.  He moved Lyra to Jordan College and forbade her mother from ever seeing her.  This arrangement held for over ten years until things got too complicated.  Lord Asriel’s work with Dust has been causing controversy, the Church has been exerting stronger influence, and Mrs. Coulter has gained equal power through the Oblation Board.   The Master may have tried to poison Lord Asriel to protect Jordan College from repercussions over the Dust controversy or even to protect *everyone* from the fallout.  John Faa and Farder Coram believe that giving Lyra the alethiometer - and warning her not to trust Mrs. Coulter with it - was the only recourse the Master had left. They tell Lyra that the gyptians had been keeping an eye on her this whole time and are committed to keeping her safe.  Farder Coram knows the basics of how to read the alethiometer:  each symbol has up to a dozen levels of meaning and the reader holds the meanings of three symbols in mind while setting the three short hands to those pictures, then allows the long hand to move itself to the answer. Unfortunately, with over 1,000 meanings he would need a book to interpret it properly.  

**CHAPTER 8 - FRUSTRATION:** For the next three days, Lyra enjoys hearing from Ma Costa the story of her birth and rescue, as well as entertaining the local children with fantastical tales of her brave father and his near poisoning.  (It involved [switched wine glasses and a Turkish ambassador who clearly couldn't drink the wine in front of him](https://youtu.be/dzaL8wiSjnM?si=OROAuuwWpWPEOgow).) Then it is time for another roping (the gyptian meeting).  Families come forward to present their gold and pledge how many men will go North, as well as to ask questions.  There is brief quibbling over whether protecting Lyra is worth the trouble being brought to gyptian communities, but John Faa reminds his people what a friend Lord Asriel has been to the gyptians and points out the shame of betraying a child for personal comfort.  People are also wondering if men and money will be put towards rescuing Lord Asriel or exacting revenge on the kidnappers, especially if the rumors of mutilation are true.  John Faa assures them that rescuing the children is their only goal and they will focus on that first, with any other actions undertaken only if feasible. He reminds the crowd that they believe the children are being used in a theological experiment, but they don't yet know if they're being harmed.  However, they are prepared to fight.  Women ask to go along in case they are needed in the rescue or care of the children, which John Faa promises to consider.  The heads of the families withdraw to make plans and Lyra follows so she can make her case for coming North.  John Faa refuses to put her in danger by bringing her North, but Lyra whispers to Pan that they’ll find a way to go! 

**CHAPTER 9 - THE SPIES:**  Lyra attempts to make plans for sneaking aboard the ship the gyptians will take North, but fears if she travels to the coast alone she'll stow away on the wrong boat and end up [hiding in a lifeboat bound for Darkest Peru](https://youtu.be/t95Zwch09wQ?feature=shared) High Brazil.  Instead, she sticks close to Farder Coram.  He observes her as she practices with the alethiometer.  One day, Lyra asks it how the gyptian spies are doing and the answer she receives points to death.  This confuses her until a badly wounded spy returns to report that several of them were killed while breaking into the Ministry of Theology.  This leaves Lyra unsettled because she worries the alethiometer may have a spirit inside, but Pan thinks it could be “elementary particles”, Mrs. Coulter's word for Dust.  Memories of a photomill at Gabriel College confirm this could be true: it was a precious theological instrument, kept under black velvet like her alethiometer, with dusty light surrounding it when illuminated by the sun.  John Faa hears of Lyra's ability to read the alethiometer and reverses his decision about taking her North.  On the journey to the coast, Lyra must stay hidden the entire time because the search for her has intensified and there are dark rumors circulating about her identity and nature.  Farder Coram has Lyra ask the alethiometer what Mrs. Coulter is up to, and she gets an answer with symbols for *angry*, *child*, and a few mysterious animals she cannot quite interpret (partially due to his distracting questions).  Farder Coram decides to allow her a break in fresh air, but no sooner does she get on deck then Pan, flying above as a seagull, is attacked by two flying clockwork objects.  They manage to save Pan and catch one of the attackers, which turns out to be a spy device with a demon spirit inside that would go after Lyra if released.  The other spy device flew away to report a Lyra sighting.  Lyra then realizes that the animals, which mean *Africa* and *air*, were meant as warnings about these devices which come from Morocco.  At the docks, John Faa announces that several gyptians were killed and captured on the journey, but the rest of the group is ready to set out.  They board the ship and sail North.  Lyra’s excitement is quelled by Pan's seasickness.  

**PART TWO: BOLVANGAR**

**CHAPTER 10 - THE CONSUL AND THE BEAR:** Lyra takes to life at sea like ~~a duck to water~~ Pan does to being a dolphin. Despite occasional seasickness, she enjoys exploring the ship and learning from the crew.  She discusses with Farder Coram how dæmons settle into one form when their people become adults and know who they really are, but Lyra feels she [won't grow up](https://youtu.be/nydUgAr3xek?si=doW1QcyoUCZXu3ga). Finally, they arrive in the port city of Trollesund.  The first order of business is to meet with the Consul of Witches, Dr. Martin Lanselius to ask for information.  Farder Coram has a good relationship with witches since aiding Serafina Pekkala years ago.  She is too far away to exchange messages, but Dr. Lanselius listens to their story and answers their questions.  He is very interested in Lyra’s ability to read the alethiometer and when she is out of the room, Dr. Lanselius tells Farder Coram that Lyra is a child the witches have known about for centuries.  She has an important destiny that could save everyone, but she mustn't be guided at all in her actions even if she makes mistakes.  This is connected to the people across the many universes, he says, although Farder Coram does not really understand.  Dr. Lanselius acknowledges that the witches are aware of child smuggling in the area but generally stay out of these things to preserve a positive relationship with the locals.  He advises them to seek out Iorek Byrnison, an armored bear employed in town as a metalworker in exchange for food and liquor.  While most panserbjørne are employed by the General Oblation Board, Iorek is one of the few who is not, and he may be of help to them.  When Farder Coram and Lyra seek Iorek out later, he reveals that the men in town got him drunk and stole his armor, leaving him unable to support himself by fighting like other panserbjørne.  He will fight with the gyptians if they can get his armor back.  Meanwhile, John Faa has secured the assistance of an aeronaut with a balloon that can help them travel and navigate the North.  [*Avengers, assemble!*](https://youtu.be/afhf2-Rk4d8?si=ftRnLzuU6R1oYQN7)  

**CHAPTER 11 -  ARMOR:**  Lyra can see the city from another universe as she admires the [Aurora](https://www.space.com/15139-northern-lights-auroras-earth-facts-sdcmp.html).  Serafina Pekkala’s dæmon arrives to speak with Farder Coram.  The goose dæmon tells them how getting involved with the fight against the Oblation Board would be very politically fraught for the witches, some of whom are allied to the Dust hunters, as the witches call them.  They are holding the children in a fortified building in Bolvanger which is guarded by Tartars and armored bears.  Lord Asriel is a prisoner because he plans to use Dust to create a bridge between universes, which scares many groups and would cause war over who controls the bridge.  When Lyra points out that they have the help of a bear who doesn't support the Oblation Board, John Faa says Iorek is indentured due to the harm he caused when his armor was taken, so he cannot leave with them.  Lyra insists this is slavery and he must be helped.  The goose dæmon gives the men directions to Bolvanger, while Lyra falls asleep dreaming of rescuing her father and helping him build the bridge.  

The next day, Lee Scoresby arrives and causes a distraction by challenging the gyptians to a game of cards, while his dæmon tells Pan and Lyra to go help Ioric Byrnison get his armor back. Meanwhile, John Faa and Farder Coram plead Ioric’s case for release with the [sysselman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%BDsluma%C3%B0ur).  Lyra is too scared to approach Ioric but Pan forces her to move forward by stretching their bond, a physically and emotionally painful act of moving farther apart than they should ever be.  When Lyra finally gives in and rushes to join Pan, they tell Ioric which house the armor is hidden in, and he runs off to retrieve it with a promise to only fight if the townspeople act first.  Armed police shoot at Ioric and he bursts out of the house with his armor on, ready to kill one of them.  Lyra convinces him to walk away without bloodshed. His armor has been ill-cared-for so Lee Scoresby guards it while Ioric kills a seal for blubber to lubricate the rusty joints.  At gunpoint, the sysselman lets Ioric leave with the gyptians on the condition that he never return to their town.  Ioric dons his armor again, the group packs up, and everyone heads off towards Bolvanger.  As Lyra and Pan fall asleep on Farder Coram’s sledge, Pan is vaguely aware that they are being followed by something that swings like a monkey. *(That's not suspicious at all; I'm sure there are lots of monkeys up North.

Hey everyone! I’ve just started publishing my dark fantasy web novel on Royal Road, and I’m looking for readers who’d be willing to give it a shot and even offer some honest feedback or critique.

The story follows a young writer who finds himself in a world shaped by emotion-based magic, where reality is a living “Tapestry” he can rewrite but doing so costs him memories and pieces of himself. The power system is inspired by Lord of the Mysteries, with unique emotional Paths (like sorrow-fueled illusionists or rage-powered warriors). It explores themes of grief, identity, and what it means to create or destroy meaning.

If you enjoy stories with emotional stakes, broken gods, or morally gray characters, I’d love for you to give it a try.

I’m open to all feedback, story structure, pacing, prose, character depth, whatever you think might help improve it.

I’ve already posted 2–5 chapters on Royal Road if you enjoy it and want to continue:


Below is Chapter 1 
Thanks in advance to anyone who checks it out!




Chapter 1

Where Ink Meets Flesh



Most people say I’m normal.

A quiet student, a bit of a loner, always scribbling in the corner of some classroom.

 

But inside my head?

Worlds.

Worlds with crumbling skies, immortal tyrants, and cursed bloodlines.

I build kingdoms out of pain and myth. I carve gods from grief.

 

My name is Aki, and I have one dream:

To tell stories that feel more real than this reality ever did.

 

Since my mother died, writing has been the only thing I could turn to. It filled the silence. It dulled the ache. When I wrote, I felt seen by the characters I created if no one else.

And sometimes, I wonder…

If I poured too much of myself into those characters.

If I fed them too much of my soul.




 

Day 1

Where Ink Meets Flesh

 

BEEP—BEEP—BEEP—

 

“Crap!”

 

I snapped awake to the shriek of my alarm and the weight of déjà vu. I was late, again.

 

My room was chaos: shelves sagging under paperbacks, books stacked like teetering ruins, and drawings scattered like autumn leaves across the floor. The air smelled faintly of pencil graphite and dust. I scrambled to pack up the rough drafts I’d stayed up all night sketching panels of the next chapter of my webcomic and stuffed them into my bag.

 

I skipped breakfast, chewing on a piece of stale bread while checking my phone.

 

Reya: “I’m already at campus. Where the hell are you? Not waiting again.”

 

I almost smiled.

 

That was Reya, impatient, sharp, honest to a fault. She never sugarcoated anything. But underneath the sarcasm, there was someone who genuinely cared, in ways I never expected.

 

We’d met in middle school.

Back then, I was just the quiet kid who spent lunch in the library, sketching monsters in the margins of my notebooks. Reya was loud, bold, and popular. She found me during a group project, saw my notebook full of hand-drawn creatures and characters.

 

Instead of mocking me like the others, she leaned over and asked,

“Is this for a manga or a game or something?”

 

I didn’t know what to say.

 

The next day, she brought snacks and sat beside me. She didn’t ask if I wanted company. She just gave it. That was how she was. Full of energy and life, with long ash-brown hair that always shimmered in the sun, eyes the color of old amber, bright, curious, and sharp. She dressed in layers that always looked unintentional but effortlessly stylish, like she walked out of some coming-of-age movie.

 

We were opposites in every sense she, social and outspoken; me, quiet and anxious.

But somehow, we clicked.

She became the first person I ever shared my stories with.

 

The train ride was suffocating.

 

I stood pressed between two salarymen, their suits smelling of sweat and stale cologne. The floor vibrated under my shoes, and the ceiling lights flickered with each turn. I stared at the reflections in the train window. Everyone looked half-asleep, dulled by routine. Just moving bodies in motion.

 

Needing a distraction, I opened my bag to glance at the sketches I’d packed earlier.

But they were gone.

My folder usually stuffed with half-finished panels, character sheets, notes was filled with blank paper. Clean. Untouched.

The exact same paper I had drawn on just last night.

A sinking feeling bloomed in my chest. I fumbled through my bag again, faster this time. Nothing. Not a single sketch survived.

 

What the hell…?

 

When I arrived at school, Reya was waiting at the gates with her arms crossed and eyebrows furrowed. She looked at me like she was about to throw her phone at my head.

 

But then she saw my face and her expression shifted.

 

“Aki,” she said slowly, “I just checked your webcomic.”

 

I blinked. “Yeah?”

 

“It’s gone.”

 

“What do you mean ‘gone’?”

 

“I mean gone. All of it. The chapters, the panels, even your account. There’s nothing there.”

 

My mouth went dry. “Let me see.”

 

She handed me her phone, and I scrolled.

 

Blank. No user. No content. Just a 404 error.

 

“That doesn’t make sense. Even if it was banned, I would’ve gotten a notification,” I murmured.

 

“You didn’t?”

 

“No… nothing.”

 

I stared at the screen, numb. I could barely feel my fingers.

 

And as if that wasn’t enough, I whispered, “My sketches are gone too.”

 

Reya turned sharply. “What?”

 

“In my bag. All my rough drafts. Just… gone. Like they were never there.”

 

We both stood frozen for a long moment.

 

Then I said, more to myself than her, “I’ll contact the site. Maybe it’s a glitch…”

 

Reya nodded slowly, but I could tell she didn’t believe it either.

Classes felt like background noise.

The whiteboard was full of equations, but my mind was elsewhere. My pencil hovered uselessly over my notes. Reya occasionally glanced at me from her seat, brows furrowed in concern.

 

No one else noticed. No one else cared.

To everyone else, it was just another normal day.

When lunch arrived, Reya nudged me silently, and we headed behind the campus to our usual spot.

 

It wasn’t much. Just a forgotten courtyard near the old gym building. Half of it was overgrown with wild ivy, and a gnarled tree stood at the edge like a silent sentinel. The rusted bench creaked whenever we sat on it. Cracked pavement gave way to patches of moss and brittle weeds. You could hear the distant echo of PE classes from the other field, but it always felt… separate. Quieter. Like the world paused here.

 

Reya handed me a drink without saying anything. Some canned coffee.

 

“Thought you could use it,” she said.

 

I gave her a small smile. “Thanks.”

 

We sat there, sipping in silence. The sky was a dull gray, the wind dry and restless.

 

And then my phone buzzed.

 

A notification.

 

I stared at it. Reya leaned in.

 

“SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE. WE MADE A MISTAKE.

FILTERING BOT COMICS—COMPUTER GENERATED CONTENT.

CLICK HERE TO REGAIN ACCESS TO YOUR STORY.”

 

“Oh,” Reya said. “Maybe it really was a glitch.”

 

“Guess so…”

 

She nudged me. “Click it. It might expire.”

 

I hesitated, but then tapped the link.

 

Another screen opened.

 

“YOU WILL GAIN FULL ACCESS TO YOUR COMIC AND TAKE COMPLETE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR CREATION.

DO YOU ACCEPT?”

 

I frowned.

 

“What’s that supposed to mean?”

 

Reya leaned closer. “Weird phrasing…”

 

I shrugged, nervous but too tired to think.

“Whatever. Of course I accept.”

 

I clicked.

 

“THANK YOU FOR ACCEPTING.

YOU ARE NOW A CREATOR.

YOU ARE NOW A GOD.”

 

“…Huh?”

 

I blinked at the screen.

 

Reya was quiet.

 

“…Um. Aki?” she whispered. “I think… something just moved.”

 

“What?”

 

“I’m serious. Over there. Near the tree.”

 

I followed her gaze.

 

A ripple of movement.

no, not wind. Not light.

 

A shape. A distortion.

 

I squinted.

 

And then—

something moved again.

 

Not walked.

Shifted.

Like a shadow detaching from reality. Wrong. Crooked. Hungry.

 

The air turned cold.

The hairs on my arms stood up.

 

“…Maybe it’s just a trick of the light,” I muttered, trying to laugh it off. “Or maybe you’re just stressed—”

 

“AKI!”

 

Reya’s scream shattered the moment.

 

I turned—

 

And the world fractured.

 

A black, warped figure was towering behind her.

 

It had no face. No eyes. Just a mass of shifting shadow, leaking into the air like smoke.

 

Its arm, clawed, skeletal, like it had been drawn in with blood rose.

 

And in a blink—

SLASH.

 

A spray of red.

 

Reya’s head—

Gone.

 

Her body collapsed like a puppet with its strings cut.

 

The can she gave me rolled across the cracked pavement, hissing open, coffee pooling at my feet.

I froze.

My brain refused to understand what I just saw.

What I just lost.

My breath caught in my throat.

No scream.

No tears.

Just silence.

 

The thing turned toward me.

 

And I understood one thing—

This wasn’t a story anymore.

 

This was real.

i’ve been dealing with really bad anxiety and depression, and it honestly feels like it’s just been getting worse. my mom has schizophrenia and depression too, so i’m not sure if that’s connected. last night i had a horrible panic attack after drinking a large iced coffee and smoking weed (i know, that was terrible of me to do).

i’ve had health + social anxiety for as long as i can remember. my parents were pretty neglectful and never got me any real help growing up. when i mentioned anxiety at 15 when i finally got the courage to visit a doctor, the nurse completely disregarded it.

i’m 19 (turned in february) and started vaping recently. nicotine made me super nauseous so i switched to weed, and while it *usually* calms me, it also leaves me with this heavy anxious feeling i can’t shake.

i found a small, non-painful egg-shaped lump on the lower left side of my neck a few days ago and it’s been worrying me. i keep spiraling and googling symptoms. it’s worse when i get on tiktok and suddenly it shows me videos about cancer or health stuff and it makes me panic even more.

i’ve also been feeling lethargic down lately. it’s summer, i barely have any friends, i don’t get much exercise or eat well. i’ve always worried i might have undiagnosed type 2 diabetes, especially with my bad eating habits and weight (i’m 4’10 and 145lbs so managing my weight is harder for me)

i’ve been thinking about seeing a doctor, but my social anxiety makes it hard to even make the appointment. i wake up early, get ready for class, do my hair and makeup — but then i can’t gain the courage to step foot out of my apartment door. i don’t even have a job or a source of income even though i crave for human interaction.

i went to the ER about 3 weeks ago for the worst tension headache ever — i was convinced i was having a stroke. my dad got mad for waking him up and i just feel like no one in my family gets what i’m going through. my mom voluntarily left the united states to move back to mexico and i haven’t seen her in about 6 years. i haven’t told her about what i’m going through because i don’t want to worry her.

i had a huge crying fit this morning because everything just feels like too much. and i feel dumb for being this stressed when i don’t even have a job or “real” responsibilities. i know i need to try to change things but it feels like i’m stuck in the same loop. it’s exhausting. i haven’t been interested in anything like i used to be last year and when i am having a good time, i get a wave of an impending doom feeling. 

if anyone else feels like anxiety is taking over or just wants to share, i’d love to hear from you <3

1m1nuqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/noburp/comments/1m1nuqt/living_and_coping_with_rcpd_a_postbotox/,Living and coping with R-CPD: a post-botox perspective,"I suffered from R-CPD for the last 40 years of my 60+ years life, until I had botox in February and again in May.

What follows are things I worked out before botox and things I realised afterwards. It specifically addresses dealing with some R-CPD symptoms — especially at night — and is further informed by my post-botox journey.

When you have R-CPD (you don’t burp) and have been upright all day, you have two large pockets of gas inside you: one at the top of your **stomach** and the other at the top of your colon — in your **transverse colon**. They hang around in those two spots because the gas rises to the top of the other contents. You also have smaller pockets of air throughout your intestines. The two large pockets of gas cause pressure that leads to the pain at the top of your abdomen. You may also have acid reflux (caused by the long-term pressure of the gas on your lower oesophageal sphincter), and if this is untreated it will also cause pain in that area.

This causes major problems when trying to sleep at night, due to the pain and discomfort.

**What can you do to help you sleep?**

**Re the gas in your stomach:** Your oesophagus comes out of your stomach diagonally, pointing up towards your right shoulder. If you *can* burp, then lying down at the beginning of the night on your *left* side will allow the burps to come up and out more easily. (Additionally, taking simethicone can facilitate this by consolidating all the small bubbles into one big more-burpable bubble.) If you *can’t* burp, then lying on the left might still help a bit, because the gas in your stomach can at least gurgle up into your oesophagus — which acts as a sort of overflow area — and it can take some of the pressure off your stomach (though it might feel worse in your chest/throat). When I couldn’t burp, and even now that I can, I lay/lie on my left side at the beginning of the night.

Eventually, all the food in your stomach will get moved down into the small intestine, the pressure will be reduced, and the gas will eventually follow it down.

**Re the gas in your transverse colon:** Your transverse colon is shown on simple diagrams as being horizontal, but in reality it’s more like a piece of rope held in two places — dipping down a lot in the middle — so when you are upright, all the gas in your transverse colon has to go diagonally up (and back) towards your left shoulder and then down your descending colon (on your left side) to be farted out.

Astute readers will note that this diagonal is in the *opposite* direction to the exit route for stomach gas. So to facilitate getting the intestinal gas out, you need to be lying on your *right* side.

In practice, years of experience taught me to sleep on my left at the beginning of the night and on my right in the middle of the night. Eventually I would fart the gas out and be able to sleep. I always knew that my “best” and soundest sleep was in the morning, but I never realised that it was because the majority of the gas had been farted out by that point and its movement through my intestines had thus slowed down.

I took sleep meds for 20 years. Pre-botox, even with sleep meds, my all-time record was eventually falling asleep 9 hours after going to bed, despite being exhausted. Post-botox, I’m off the sleep meds and I’m falling asleep in about 20-40 minutes.

Note that other people have reported different preferences for sleeping on their left or right. I think it all depends where the majority of your gas happens to be — stomach or colon.

**Once in the colon, it gets worse…** My R-CPD caused a diagnosis of “irritable bowel syndrome”. This is a standard diagnosis given to many people with R-CPD. It’s a sort of “We don’t know WTF’s wrong with you, so we’ll just call it irritable bowel, even though it’s meaningless”. It’s a term that I hope will eventually disappear, once people are cured of R-CPD. It used to be called “spastic colon”, which is a term that I find much more descriptive of what’s often happening. In the 90s, I had x-rays (with barium) showing my descending colon in spasm, which was my colon’s reaction when the air was pumped in for the imaging. I was given no anaesthetic (1990s; good times! 🙄). I was in shouting-out-loud agony and what I was specifically shouting out was “*Aaarrgh! That’s it! That’s the exact pain I feel every evening! What’s that???*” The x-rays pics show the colon in a really tight spasm.

I think of the intestines as a slurry pump. Any engineer knows that if you send air (compressible) through a pump designed for liquids (non-compressible), you will break the pump. This is the same.

So in addition to having the pocket of gas in your transverse colon, your descending colon can also go into spasm, causing it to be trapped up there. And with more gas constantly arriving, it gets backed-up leading to more and more pain. Nightmare.

**What can you do to reduce the gas and pain?**

With all the above in mind, your main aim should be to reduce the amount of gas getting into your system in the first place and keep the gas that did get in moving, especially for when you go to bed at night. This will reduce the pressure and pain.

1) If you are at all overweight, eating less will help — both in terms of reducing the contents of your stomach/intestines and eventually reducing the additional pressure caused by the folds of fat.

Unfortunately, when you don’t sleep because of the pain, you crave carbs to give you energy and the whole thing is a downward spiral you can’t get out of (I’ve been in it for most of my 60+ years).

Pre-botox, I rarely managed to lose weight. All the gas and pressure meant that I never knew if I was full or hungry. I just ate what I felt was the right amount at set mealtimes. Post-botox, I know when I do and don’t need food and I have lost 10% of my body weight without trying.

Unfortunately, many R-CPD sufferers can be beset by nausea when eating, so losing weight or eating less is not an option and is actually a symptom for them 😞

2) Eating dinner at least 4 hours before bedtime always helped my R-CPD and still helps my reflux. Pre-botox, socialising made this 4-hour rule impossible, so eating out meant a guaranteed sleepless night. Post-recent-botox, my burping has not yet reached the socially-acceptable point 😁 but I’m hoping it will do so soon.

3) Absolutely avoid fizzy drinks or anything that can cause you to take in extra air. For example, using a straw may cause you to suck up a whole load of air in the straw before the liquid arrives and then you gulp it all down, air included. So ditch the straws.

Also: I‘ve always found that holding my breath while drinking a big glass of water helps me gulp down less air.

4) As well as during drinking, you also take in lots of air while you’re eating. Some foods may actually contain the air that you’re about to swallow. Examples: lettuce (the air is inside), rice (the air is between the grains), bread, mousses etc. They’re fine to eat, but there are techniques to deal with them: chew really well and try to expel the air from your mouth before swallowing.

5) Your intestines also produce gas as the food ferments and is processed by the gut bacteria. The amount of gas produced this way is a drop in the ocean compared to what you take in while eating, as anyone who’s had botox can confirm: the farting is minimal post-botox. That said, anything that generates extra gas is still going to add to the pressure and is worth reducing. You may find that advice from others to eat more fibre or to eat lots of fruit (or whatever is the latest fad) may need to be tempered by your experience with how they affect you. I once felt I was going to explode after a combination of watermelon and bran flakes. I was eating huge amounts of fibre (on the advice of gastroenterologists) before I realised it made things way, way worse. The academic research on the subject — showing that fibre makes things worse for some people — came out many years later, but that info still hasn’t reached some middle-aged GI specialists, who still recommend fibre as a cure-all.

6) If you’re constipated — because of R-CPD, or because of anti-reflux meds, or whatever — do everything you can to fix it. Constipation will not help the gas move through your system. My personal choice is to take magnesium citrate. I only need a dose that is half the daily requirement of magnesium (occasionally doubling up to a full daily dose). Find the dose that works for you. Whatever you do, never, ever get to the point where you need to strain: getting up to pee several times a night because of rectal prolapse later in life will not improve your quality of life. Trust me on this.

Having a pre-botox crap with R-CPD is never going to be as functional as it is for burpers, because you’ll tend to have a small stool followed by gas and then you need to wait for the next stool to come down. With magnesium, pre-botox, this can make bathroom visits explosive, so work out the right dose gradually. Post-botox, I was ecstatic to have the whole column come out at once. It was a sort of  [mother panda moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4rfQSgkZOE) 😁

Also, pre-botox: farting = totally normal; what’s new? 🥱 Post-botox: farting = you need to go to the bathroom, because a crap is on the way. Being post-botox liberates you from so many bathroom woes simply because you know when you need to go.

7) I’m amazed I ever worked this one out before I even understood what was going on, but I got there by trial and error, around 30 years ago:

All the gas in my transverse colon caused my descending colon to go into spasm every afternoon (see “irritable bowel” above) giving me excruciating pain from the early evening until after dinner, when the farts started to help me release some of the pressure. I worked out that having a snack late afternoon — a banana and some milk or a small pastry and a milky coffee — relaxed my colon and helped me fart before I got to that crisis point.

What I didn’t know then is that this was the [gastrocolic reflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrocolic_reflex) in action. Basically, when you eat something, your intestines kick into action to make room for what’s about to come through. This peristalsis (the wave-like movement that pushes food through) helps move the gas along and helps you to fart some of it out.

So having a small snack in the afternoon may help you reduce the amount of gas you will have to deal with later on.

8) This one’s easy these days, but it was unacceptable in my early work years: Wear elasticated skirts / trousers / whatever. With all the pressure that you have inside, the last thing you need is more pressure from outside. Those tight jeans may look good, but they won’t help your R-CPD.

9) People with mobility issues may have a problem with this one — as I do, unfortunately: Exercise can often help get the gas moving. It can also be excruciatingly painful and impossible to do when you’re bloated. Try to move around as much and as often as you are able to.

10) Last and most importantly: Get botox if you can.

If you can’t get botox yet, then map out how you are going to get there. It may take you a while, but you will get there eventually.

Your local R-CPD-treating specialist may have a two-step approach where you have a consultation first and then you see them later for the botox. If so, and if you can afford it,  think about just taking the first step by having the consultation. Just getting a formal diagnosis is an enormous relief. It validates your pain, explains any anxiety you might have, and it may help other people — parents, friends — take your condition more seriously. If you are relying on parents to get through this, but can’t convince them you need botox, try to convince them to allow you at least to have a consultation with an R-CPD-treating specialist.

If a doctor’s referral is what’s stopping you getting treatment, but you’re not being believed by your doctor, check out: [How I convinced my doctor to take R-CPD seriously](https://www.reddit.com/r/noburp/comments/1ironwq/how_i_convinced_my_doctor_to_take_rcpd_seriously/)

While you are waiting, follow the tips above and … then begin practicing burping. I know, I know — you can’t burp yet. But there’s definitely a proportion of noburpers who are able to self-cure and you may be one of them. Some people seem to be *almost* there. Look up some of the exercises others have used ( u/Little-Badger-123 has some tips [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/noburp/comments/1m0xkmh/comment/n3d7gz5/?context=3) ) and check out [Dr Bastian’s video on how to burp post-botox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSuEafl4lnI), because some of those techniques might just help you anyway. I know that in the lead-up to my first injection, my new-found knowledge of R-CPD was enough to make me have 3 or 4 really-tiny involuntary microburps. Just being mindful of the sensations and having an understanding of what’s going on may help you get started.

Whatever approach you take, I hope you manage to burp before long and continue to do so.",5,1752698292.0,noburp,4,0.86,False

1m1npwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenRelationships/comments/1m1npwv/why_do_guys_ghost/,Why Do Guys Ghost?,"For some backstory, I (23F) have never had a serious boyfriend. It's not because I'm not open to it or that I'm not putting myself out there. I have been on hundreds of dates, especially throughout college and post grad. I have had probably 15 talking stages in the last few years that don't turn into anything. It's like these guys I'm dating are so romantic, kind, fun, and overall great guys until I give them what they want and then they disappear.

Ghosting is actually the craziest thing I've ever experienced in my life, because what do you mean I was at your house last night and you dropped me off this afternoon after like one of the most romantic weekends of my life and you never talk to me again. 

For instance, this last weekend I went on a date with this guy I had been talking to for a few weeks. We were so compatible. We spent a full 24 hours together, started off with drinks that kept going until like 3am and then I stayed over (probably shouldn't have done that looking back, but we're adults - who cares) There wasn't a moment during the time we were together that there was any awkward tension either. It's not that vibes were weird at the end either. He wanted the date to keep going! He wanted to get coffee and hang out longer the next morning. Plus, he texted me after and said he had a great time and wanted to see me again soon, with which I agreed. 

Fast forward to now, it's been 5 days of radio silence. Like not even a hi or hello. I texted him yesterday with like a little inside joke thing, and he was so dry. To be fair, we really haven't talked much over text ever. Maybe since we slept together, I'm overthinking it. I haven't heard anything since that text though, and it's been almost a full day. Maybe I'm being dramatic, but if he actually liked me, we would have set up another date at this point, right? And he would definitely be talking to me at least a LITTLE bit. It's just such bull. We talked about some deep things. Both of us did. Both of us had a good time, I'm not delusional.

I guess I'm asking for any insight or advice that would be helpful - especially from a guy who can maybe explain where his brain is at. Like why???? Am I bad in bed??? I mean, he seemed to be having fun. Or maybe we jumped into bed too fast?? I don't understand why that would matter either though, we both wanted to do it and it felt right. If he was open and honest with me about what he actually wanted, I would've been cool with it - and honestly, the outcome probably would have been the same, except I wouldn't have the expectations that we would see each other again. If he just wanted to hook up, just say so. I needed a hookup too, but good god, don't get super personal and talk about deep things then. It's misleading.

This isn't the first time I've experienced this either, so my question is - what is wrong with me???? what am I doing wrong.

From the moment I opened the package, I knew this product was tailored for convenience and eco-conscious consumers like me. These little laundry detergent sheets deliver a lot in their compact design, but there’s definitely more to unravel here.

**Travel-Friendly Efficiency**

Packing for road trips or vacations used to be stressful, especially when it came to lugging around heavy detergent bottles or worrying about messy spills. The detergent sheets are nifty and dissolve easily in water, making them a lifesaver for travel. Their compact packaging slides into a suitcase without taking up much room. I tested them during a weekend getaway, and having clean clothes without the hassle of traditional liquid detergents was undeniably convenient.

[Check HOMERHYME HR-30DS100ST-U price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b0ch7p1pcb/)

**Gentle on Skin Yet Remarkably Effective**

With kids and family members prone to skin sensitivities, finding a laundry product that doesn’t irritate delicate skin can be tricky. These unscented detergent sheets stood out. While gentle and free of harsh chemicals like dyes, parabens, and bleach, they still packed a punch against stains. Spilled coffee and stubborn grease stains disappeared after a single wash, which amazed me. Even my coworker, who borrowed a couple of sheets for their tough gym clothes, was equally impressed!

**Sustainable Packaging and Design**

One of the standout highlights, in my opinion, is the sustainable design. Plastic jugs and liquid detergent tubs have always felt wasteful, but these biodegradable laundry sheets are a breath of fresh air. The fact that the packaging isn’t contributing to the endless plastic waste problem makes using them all the more rewarding. It’s like an environmental double win—clean clothes and a cleaner planet.

**Performance Across Different Scenarios**

What surprised me further was their versatility. Whether I used these sheets for a normal load at home, hand washing delicates, or running a quick cold water cycle, they dissolved effortlessly and cleaned to near perfection. Plus, they worked seamlessly with my HE washing machine too. Interestingly, a neighbor of mine gave it a try for her delicate baby clothes and was all praises for the soft yet thorough cleaning power.

**Innovative Cleaning Technology That Impresses**

I geeked out a little exploring the science behind these detergent sheets. Unlike traditional detergents loaded with unnecessary chemicals and water, these strips are concentrated cleaning powerhouses. Their ability to completely dissolve without residue ensures no soap streaks on clothes or unnecessary buildup in machines. It's technology that feels modern and responsible.

**Upsides**

- Convenient and lightweight, especially for travel.  
- Unscented and kind to sensitive skin.  
- Biodegradable and plastic-free, great for sustainability.  

**Critiques**

- Struggles with extremely heavy-duty stains (might need supplemental stain remover).  
- Price point could feel steep when compared to bulky store-brand detergents.  

**Competing Brands**

While brands like Tru Earth or Earth Breeze offer similar detergent sheets, HOMERHYME’s compact design and focus on skin gentleness outshines many competitors. Tru Earth, for example, has similar sustainability goals but doesn’t always deliver the same stain-fighting capability. On the flip side, Earth Breeze often comes out slightly more cost-effective per use. However, results vary based on individual preferences for features like unscented options or packaging design.

**Affordable Quality**

Though these sheets lean pricier than traditional liquid detergents, their value becomes evident when you factor in the waste reduction, storage convenience, and health benefits. I personally feel the eco-friendly focus and reduced hassle justify spending a little more for this product. Plus, they’re designed for up to 200 loads, which goes a long way in household settings.

Hey, guys! So basically I’m (22f)  gonna ask this guy out (college) and I have a few different versions. From the pov of a guy which is better: 

“Hi! I thought you were really cute and sweet. If you’re single, would you want to go get coffee or something sometime?” 

“Hi! I thought you were really funny and sweet. If you’re single, would you want to go get coffee or something sometime?” 

“Hi! Are you single?” 

Do any of these sound too pushy or come on too strong? 

I have a friend that says not to include the cute part because she thinks guys thinking you’re “chasing” them or their ego will get inflated. Any advice is appreciated!

Obviously, y'all are familiar with the 6-month sub coffees and brewers. But I also bought some Pepe Jijon Sydra and my very first Geisha coffee, both from Apollon's Gold. Just watched Lance Hedrick's recent video where he had on Pepe and his son, Jose - so I'm pretty excited to try his stuff. DD the Goat also threw in a bag of Colorfull Typica-A, which was my absolute favorite from my first Coffee Rotation order.

I wasn't ready to break into the AG coffees or the other new ones, so I brewed up some Kurasu Brazilian light roast that I had opened, which is great btw. Needed another pick-me-up this afternoon, so I ended up breaking into the Hex - pink bourbon

Brewed it with the D27 and followed a kind of vague recipe I saw on Aramse, where, after a 30-gram, minute-long bloom, you pretty much just do multiple small pours until you reach the final water weight. Makes a good, well-rounded cup. Might try a different recipe with this coffee, even tho the final cup was pretty damn good. It's almost impossible to brew a bad cup with the d27 - they may not all be perfect, but they usually turn out tasty. Btw, DM me if you don't have a D27 - I already had one so now have an extra and happy to give it away.

I don’t do that lightly, I really value the friendship but I was under a lot of stress and had to deal with something that came up unexpectedly, that was very time sensitive. 

I thought it was a casual thing (meet up in the park), but he had planned bringing a picnic, which made me think it wasn’t very casual?

He’s not responded to my last message for hours, nothing to say “that’s ok, let’s meet another time”, or anything like that. I don’t know if what I did was really horrible? I’m afraid I’ve hurt his feelings. But I don’t know what else I could have done.

Let’s take a bit of a break and see what’s been going on and will be going on in the Sol system. Thought you all might enjoy having the perspective of someone not at the top of the chain, but a bit lower. Totally not like either of these characters will matter. Right?

Side note: If anybody likes the setting and wants to play around in it, I’d be happy to help however I can. Also if any of you have suggestions of what kind of vibe a terminally ill Federation species might ask Bran for as far as music goes, I’ve got a few ideas but need help finishing the next chapter.

I couldn't believe it. I changed the channel again and again. On every news channel, the same story. Aliens. There are really aliens. I shouldn't be surprised, there are plenty of sapient species between Earth and CMN, but *hundreds* of aliens. ‘My work helped us meet them!’ I set my salad down on the table to watch. I picked it up on the way home because there was no way I was cooking after the day I had. ‘The higher-ups were acting weird today, and they had all of us artificers do mandatory overtime working on the generators, but I didn't think it could be this. I'm even a member of the Peacekeepers, and they didn't give me a hint!’

I watch the anchor pale and swallow nervously. They look sick, but I have no idea why. ""We warn our viewers, the next segment is not for the faint of heart. We've been requested to air it, unedited and uncensored, by the UN, with an exception granted for broadcasting rules. It contains violent material not suited for anyone. This footage is from one of the alien species, the Arxur, who have been warring against the others for generations and post footage like this on Federation networks regularly..."" They pause. ""Take it from me, you don't want to see this. It..."" They take a breath. ""Your device will confirm that you want to watch. If you don't, then once the footage has finished, the program will continue. We will explain the content, so do not feel forced to watch to understand. This footage is not safe for anyone.""

A countdown appeared with a warning about violent content, gore, child abuse, torture, death, and anthropophagy. Nervously, I confirm and wait for the countdown to finish. ‘I might not be a combatant, but I am a Peacekeeper. If we might be fighting these aliens, I have a duty to know why.’ Soon, I'm retching into the sink and barely catch the end of the explanation. ‘Monsters. There are monsters among the stars.’ I watch, numbly, not listening until... until the anchor starts to... ""Why! Why would they kill us for just existing!?!"" I shout at the screen.

""Now we know all of that is... a lot, but there's a message from Governor Tarva of Venlil Prime for all of Earth. We ask that you at least listen to her words with an open mind.""

The screen changes to show one of the sheep aliens in an office, their ears are pretty orange and their eyes are a bit glassy. ""H-hello. I'm Governor Tarva, the leader of not only Venlil Prime but all of the planets in our section of space. A space that includes Earth, so in a sense, it’s my duty to help you as well. Your astronauts just left to return to Earth and don't know I'm sending this message, but I felt the need to address your people. I understand that you might have reservations about us. I believe you have good reason to be wary, the entire Federation voted to destroy you when you were discovered \[two hundred years\] ago. We had reservations about your astronauts, in fact, we were terrified of them thinking they came... we believed them to be no different than predators we’ve been at war with for \[three hundred years\] and sent out a distress signal. In less than a claw \[four hours\], they convinced me, without knowing they were doing it, that your people were nothing like the Arxur. I was able to hide their presence from the ship that responded, ensuring that Earth is safe for now, but… if the Federation knew they’d treat you like we had mistakenly voted to long ago, not the kind people that your astronauts showed me you are. I-I'm not going to ask you to come to our aid, I can't. It would mean revealing yourselves. I would like for our peoples to become friends, but I want even more for you to be safe. I pray that if we do go forward into the future together, we’ll have a good harvest. It might take work, but as one herd we can till any field.""

The screen shifts back to the news anchor. ""There will be ongoing discussion of these revelations and the information released to the public, but we do have a message from the UN.""

The screen now shows the Secretary-General. ""To all citizens of Earth and CMN, the UN will be following the will of the people in our next steps with our neighbors in the galaxy. If the public would have us intervene and stop the Arxur then we will, if you would rather we take things slow to start and build relationships with the Venlil and perhaps other species while reserving the option to come to their defense then that is the path we will walk, if instead the preference is to attempt to avoid notice and focus only on our defenses then we will strive to make Sol impregnable all the sooner. Regardless, we ask any willing to volunteer to aid efforts. We need every artificer and enchanter we can get for the production of ley-fusion generators. We need able hands to further the construction of ships, stations, and defenses for Sol. And we need volunteers for the Peacekeepers. Everyone can do their part, read up on the situation, and make their voices heard.""

I laugh, tonight had so much emotional whiplash that the only other option is a mental breakdown. From elation to horror to dread to care and finally determination. ‘Humanity didn't shy back from mythological species; metahumanity can’t leave the Venlil in harm's way now.’

Everybody at work is abuzz, the brass didn't even make a fuss about us having news on the alien situation playing constantly over portable TVs and speakers people brought in. The support for trying to make friends with the Venlil is overwhelming. The poll hasn't even closed, but there are rumors of an exchange between us and the Venlil. ‘I hope my job won't keep me from being able to sign up. Maybe I could become a technician on the station or help familiarize the Venlil with our tech?’ I didn't care how it happened, but I wanted to meet the people that the generator I helped construct brought us to; I felt responsible for whatever happened. ~~’Plus, the Venlil were cute.’~~

We all try to ignore the visitors who are brought in, observing us through the process of making a functional LF generator. From the looks of them, they're going to be helping to instruct others on the process. I see a few that are definitely from CMN and can't help but remember what my grandparents used to say about the planes. To think that they're responding in days is... is unheard of. They're normally so slow to act and uncaring about what happens on Earth so long as it doesn't affect them, though I guess Earth being glassed would probably screw things up for them too.

The vote is all but over, and there's no way that hiding could win. In fact, it's so certain that the UN is already making plans for exchanges with the Venlil public! They're looking for experts and mages of all kinds for a teaching exchange, but that's not what drew me, even if the ads requesting ecologists, zoologists, animal control experts, law enforcement personnel, anthropologists, archaeologists, psychologists, and psychiatrists were inescapable. The one-on-one exchange for civilians and members of the Peacekeepers. I eagerly read through everything as I fill out the form. It'll start out as just text but potentially become voice or even video calls before the trip to the exchange station. The aliens will have required media consumption as homework, pretty cool. Communication will be monitored to make sure we aren't discussing anything off limits, annoying, but fine since the Venlil are so sensitive and we *really* don't want them telling the Federation about us. A warning against signing up for any with sensitive primal magic due to the potential for visiting Venlil Prime. ‘Odd, is their homeworld heavily polluted or something?’

‘Ugh... this questionnaire is long. I get that they're trying to match personalities, but this is overkill. Almost feels like I’m signing up for one of those AI matchmakers. Hopefully, the military exchange will be easier on the censorship. If my partner asks anything about where my family comes from in CMN, it'll be hard to explain if the censor is too sensitive. Probably the case for basically any mythologicals, I guess. I really should learn a bit more about the others if I'm going to be doing this, although trying to learn about *every* culture on Earth... Never mind, I'm busy enough making generators to protect the planet. Whoever I get assigned, better cut me some slack.’

Alright, form filled out. Now I need to wait. Maybe I should see if there's any news? Oh! A review of notable content we sent to the Venlil! Huh, that's odd. Why'd the data dump we sent them include an ecological sim game?

“It'll be fine, they said,” I grumble, “there's probably only bacteria out there, they said. Maybe there'll be some animals, they said. There's hundreds of blasted species that would see us dead in an instant! Hel take the fools that insisted Sol didn't need to be a hold. Hel take the bastards that only decided to get involved *after* they found out Earth was in danger! If you don't defend your home until an army is marching, then you might as well put out a welcome mat, and now we have too many hands to organize.”

I tug on my beard as I look through the reports on ley-fusion generator production. We were tooled up for *maybe* two, two and a half class twos a month, the size of the one in the *Odyssey*. Class twos are perfect for everything from survey and scout craft to corvettes to frigates and landing craft. It even works for freighters and civilian transports. In a pinch, we could even supplement reactors dedicated to shields and weapons, so it could power a light cruiser. Link up a few and they'd power larger craft, sure, they may burn out like batteries, but at least we were tooled for them instead of having to adapt to constantly shifting tooling and train people! Instead, every day we're getting ten class ones sized for fighters and other smallcraft, three class twos sized for general purpose, one and a half class threes for cruisers and carriers, one class four that'll work in anything from a heavy cruiser to a battleship, and things are still ramping up! At least the bastards made sure that the production lines could scale the size of the generators up or down, and I'm not the unlucky sod stuck with figuring out what to do with the class 3 ley engines anymore. Nearly ran out of places to use the things on the *Odyssey*, and production increased by at least two orders of magnitude. I'm just glad Bran agreed the scout should be a Q-ship armed heavily enough to make a cruiser think twice, so long as you had a powerful enough mage aboard, plus it helped solve the problem of waste energy from other systems. With what we know about the ship designs out there, it might even bloody the nose of a capital ship.

""Where's the new staff we were promised? I was told I'd have three hundred new builders today, but I'm still down twenty from last week! They’ve added twelve civilian craft to the list just today, and the number is still growing!"" I grouch at my second in command. ‘Say what you will about aos si, greater and lesser, and the fae, Derec might as well have been born to a hold instead of a people that might as well be the alfar. Just one in Edinburgh instead of somewhere proper like Copenhagen or Minneapolis…’

""Trainin', still. Heard things got held up efter a few eejits tried tae tak' their helmets aff while on a spacewalk. Peacekeepers are muckin’ about wi’ how it's aw workin’, but they said they’d come through wi' a brigade's worth o’ NCF. If they're keepin’ them in the stars, they really should be helpin’ tae put them there in the first place.""

I grumble and wave Derec off. The boy gets right back to work, and I'm certain that I'm dragging him by the family hold when things calm down. We didn't get where we are by letting talent slip away. ‘By the end of the year, that boy's either becoming an honorary member or he's on his way to marrying in. I'd bet my beard on it.’ Much as I hate the stereotypes, I feel wrong without the damn thing, plus my wife’d have me on the couch ‘til it grows back. ‘Derec did mention that he was about to give up on those apps a month ago. Haven’t heard a peep since, and he’d say if he found somebody, unless he was trying to hide it. Pretty sure Ingrid’s still single too. Wouldn’t mind Derec as a son-in-law.’

‘Oh... this isn't going to be good. I mean it might be, but... Geirrsson isn't going to be happy. And poor John, he might get court-martialed over this. Or worse... promoted given that he's doing his best to take notes.’ He was just supposed to give a tour to a group of VIPs without being told who they'd be. Then they turned out to be a bunch of gods and not just any gods but *crafters*. ‘What were any of us supposed to do when a bunch of gods on a tour got into an argument over who could make generators the best?’

I slowly backed away with the rest of the artificers; most of us might be mages, but the lot of us couldn't take on a god unarmed, let alone the six that are set on this. I winced as Vulcan abused the delicate machinery, clearly untrained, if vaguely aware of how to work it. Nothing would break, yet, but at best, it would all need to go down for maintenance tomorrow. That's definitely better than what some of the others do. I clamp my hands over my mouth to stop from screaming out as one rips a machine off its tracks and another pulls a hammer from nowhere and starts to use it as an anvil. ‘This is bad. This is so bad.’

""You mean you'll move up. Nobody here’s below him *but you* and he's been here three months less than you."" Responded Janet, the cambion, having to put up with Chet's borderline discrimination more than me. ‘I bet even his HF buddies hate him.’

""I don't know if I should be proud or toss them out an airlock.

""She kept it from the both of us for a month! My own daughter! Thought I'd be upset that she was hiding being my daughter to find somebody who wants *her*, not the clan. That I'd have issue with her dating outside the species. I could understand her being nervous if it was over occupation, no child of mine would be caught dating civil or industrial engineers, but species?!? I'd think my Ingrid would know me better than that. She didn't even tell me that she was assigned to the project, let alone as the lead for the new team!

""And then Derec! Hid it cause he was worried I’d think she was trying to get to me! First thing the fool boy thinks is that it means he has to quit the project! She's his equal, and I'm her father! Course, they're not going to care if the two are dating as long as it’s not in the way. And now I've got to make sure he knows the fraternization rules because I'm not going to have him fired over having messed up an approval form.

""Ah, well, at least they won't butt heads as team leads. With the new workers, we might actually be able to keep up with production."" I finish ranting to Mingze when there's a knock. ‘Always more work.’ An aide comes in to hand over a report, and I wait for him to read it.

If I had to deal with all the scut work and managing the construction, I'd go mad, and we'd still be months from finishing the *Odyssey*. Instead, the human general is handling that side of things while I can get what the paperwork is supposed to support instead of hinder done. ""Well? Please tell me it's not more bad news.""

Mingze sighs. ""Depends on how you look at it, Egil. Apparently a few divinities decided to get involved in making the LF generators, and then things got out of hand when they got competitive. We have ten class fives now alongside fifteen class fours.""

‘The bastards damaged the production lines! Should have known that people who haven't advanced past the classical age couldn't handle a modern assembly line. At least the damage is minor, with how much we're expanding production.

‘I take back everything I've ever said about civil engineers. They aren't lazy, they're too bogged down in red tape to move. We have completely finished plans. We have asteroids selected for additional materials. We have most of the materials we need. The parts are finished, and things just need to be assembled. None of that matters because the stations are meant for civilian occupation too, so there's enough red tape to break orbit! We didn't even have this problem with the ships meant to move civilians!

‘We got three teams of civil engineers last week, and they're a gift from the gods. We'll actually get one of them done in time to be towed for the exchange program. The others should take a few years unless there's a sudden need, according to the civvies, then it’ll take as long as it does for us to slap it together. The wonder of fast-tracking paperwork.

I sipped my coffee, watching out a viewscreen in the L4 shipyard station as the fleet with the exchange station left the system. Two frigates, a handful of assorted smaller craft, and a full contingent of our Mark 1 fighters alongside a handful of bombers, lighters, and refitted *Odyssey*\-class ships housed in the station itself. Nothing to match the *Odyssey* itself, but they also weren't meant for deep space exploration. There’s even the materials for the refit of the *Odyssey*. Five years of work that we've almost matched in a month and a half, once Earth and CMN got off their asses. Even now, things are speeding up as experimental technology is put into practice. The construction drone swarms work on assembling a ship in an intricate ballet. You'd think that might make things easier, no. We just have more to get done in a day to make up for it. Technically, I'm currently working, unfortunately, that work is trying not to get a headache from the petty mind games two spooks are trying to play on each other. The sooner these spy drones get finished, the better. The design is simple and elegant, but the people in charge... Maybe I shouldn't have befriended Mingze, then I might actually be scared of General Jones. I sigh. At least the fox makes sure that her actions only affect Jones, while Jones has wasted almost twenty minutes of my time in this SCIF.

While the job wasn’t nearly as relevant to my major as I hoped it would be, it still feels terrible to be terminated. If you wonder why I did it, they were the first ones to accept me when I applied, so I went with that one to avoid spending more time in school doing interview prep.

They cited lack of engagement over the past few weeks as reason to terminate my employment. I think I see where they are coming from, because I have had issues with staying awake throughout the day. Strategies like drinking water, eating snacks, eating bigger meals, coffee, or hoping for walks did little to help. My career coach told me about it early last week as part of some feedback she got. I don’t know if that virtual day I requested and was given approval for made people think I just wasn’t showing up.

Another thing is maybe they didn’t think I was proactive enough. They didn’t schedule me for any project sects for over five weeks, and while kept myself busy with trainings and then did reach out before that and was working with two staff members, they probably didn’t see it because it wasn’t on the schedule. And since the one who was on the schedule never got back to me, I think I got confused on what I was working on.

I helped them with a tracker, which meant filling out an Excel sheet and emailing dozens of employees. Maybe they saw me using my work laptop and regular laptop at the same time and got suspicious, since I tend to split between both to make work easier.

I finally got a real project this week that I was enjoying, and I spent a lot of time networking with the other staff members around the office, and I received positive feedback from one of the staff members I worked with, but I guess that wasn’t enough, especially when you comprehend it to all the other interns. I always knew I didn’t deserve to be in the same space as people like them. I’m not sure if anyone caught me cutting my arm with scissors that time, either, or if it has something to do with me telling my caterer coach I’m neurodivergent and deciding to go back on using those resources.

Anyway, I’m still being compensated. And while I did dislike working there, it’s terrible to know I’m just as much worse than normal people as I always thought I was. I wish I could go back to working with children again.

1m1nfey,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1m1nfey/does_the_stanley_classic_stay_hot_french_press/,Does the Stanley Classic Stay Hot French Press Truly Keep Coffee Warm?,"The Stanley Classic Stay-Hot French Press, model 10-0288800, caught my attention, promising to combine rugged functionality with the joys of coffee brewing. With a green, insulated stainless steel body and a 48-ounce capacity, it seemed poised to deliver a solid brewing experience whether at home, on a camping trip, or in the office. After using it for a while, here’s what I’ve uncovered about this product—both the good and not-so-good sides of it.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This French Press immediately gives off a rugged and durable vibe with its Hammertone Green exterior finish. I’ve knocked it against countertops and accidentally dropped it (just imagine the chaos of camping mornings), yet it remains unfazed. Made from double-wall 18/8 stainless steel, it feels like it could survive a nuclear apocalypse. The finish is tasteful and gives off a vibe that balances rustic charm with modern edginess. The insulation capabilities are top-notch, as it keeps liquids warm for up to 4 hours and cold drinks icy for 9 hours. Whether you'd use it by a lakeside or just at your kitchen table, it adds character to your coffee rituals. Admittedly, its weight—2.49 pounds—is noticeable when traveling, though not deal-breaking.

**Brewing Performance**  
Being manual and straightforward, the brewing process is refreshingly simple. Adding coarsely ground coffee, boiled water, and pressing the steel plunger after 5 minutes feels just old-school enough while staying effective. My mornings with this press have been pretty consistent; it delivers a robust and full-bodied brew that coffee aficionados would appreciate. The reusable mesh filter works beautifully for keeping grounds out of your cup, which has made producing an enjoyable brew surprisingly foolproof. Just make sure to experiment with grind sizes for the perfect cup—you don’t want overly fine grounds clogging the mesh.

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
Unlike some French Press models I’ve tried in the past, this one is relatively simple to clean. All the components come apart effortlessly, and each piece is dishwasher-safe. During busy mornings, just rinsing it under running water has done the trick for me. The manual operation feels almost meditative, and there’s something deeply satisfying about pressing the plunger down, knowing there’s a tasty cup of coffee brewing beneath.

**Key Benefits**  
- Long-lasting double vacuum insulation keeps drinks warm or cold far longer than expected.  
- Durable, 18/8 BPA-free stainless steel body stands up to rough use.  
- Mesh plunger finely filters grounds, leaving no residues in your coffee.  
- Impressively easy to clean, even during hectic days.  

**Shortcomings**  
Every product has its flaws, and this one isn’t exempt. While the insulation and rugged build are impressive, the weight can make it less convenient for minimalist camping trips or hikers seeking lighter options. Additionally, it lacks a measurement indicator inside. This isn’t a major issue, but eyeballing the coffee-to-water ratio isn’t as precise as I’d like. Finally, I noticed the lid sometimes traps slight moisture, which might not bother everyone but could be annoying for some.  
- Heavier weight isn’t ideal for ultra-light travelers.  
- Missing internal measurements for precise brewing.  
- Minor moisture retention in the lid post-cleaning.  

**Product Alternatives**  
Comparing this French Press to similar products paints a clear picture of where it shines and where it stumbles. The Bodum Chambord French Press is a popular competitor, offering a sleek glass-and-steel aesthetic; however, it lacks Stanley's insulation prowess. Even more portable options like the Aeropress may appeal to lightweight travelers, but they don’t bring anywhere near the same heat-retention capabilities. If durability and all-day warmth matter to you, Stanley’s product outmatches its rivals, especially in outdoor scenarios.

**Quality for Price**  
Is it worth the investment? Absolutely, if you’re someone looking for a combination of durability, insulation, and simple operation. While it’s priced at a premium compared to basic French Press models, its performance and ability to keep coffee hot for extended periods put it leagues above basic alternatives. For those willing to pay for these strengths, it’s a solid contender. However, if all you need is a basic French Press without insulation perks, you might find less expensive options elsewhere.

I've got a DF54, which I enjoy but it does produce quite a few fines. I can't decide whether I should go to the opposite end of the spectrum and get the ZP6 and lose out on the ability to do espresso, or buy the slightly more all round K-ultra, which would give me a 2nd grinder for espresso too (and also be consistently good for a variety of beans, compared to the ZP6 which doesn't work well with some). I mostly drink funky, fruity, heavily processed coffees. any help would be appreciated.

One more thing to note is that I could also buy DF54 brew burrs, but I don't know how these fare in terms of clarity vs body (if anyone has tried them, I'dlove to hear how you found them!), and there aren't many reviews out for it - which makes me doubtful of it's quality. However, I could buy the brew burrs and the ZP6 to get a wide spread of options for less than the cost of the K-ultra.",0,1752697232.0,pourover,3,0.5,False

1m1ncch,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m1ncch/killers_anonymous/,Killers Anonymous,"When I found a post tucked away in the dark corners of the internet, my interest was piqued. It was titled: Killers Anonymous.

At first, I thought it was a joke made to scare or morbidly amuse people, but I was wrong.  It was a support group created for people like me. When I was about 18, I began to loathe life, and I couldn’t stand seeing my peers enjoying theirs. I would spend hours alone, but it grew into days of no contact. The drugs and alcohol I had been using started flooding my mind with unsavory things. I started fantasizing about death, and I imagined becoming the one who dishes it out. I would relish in thinning about the high I could achieve through such an act. A high that no drug could provide me. A high that I would never come down from. I knew it was wrong to think that way, but I couldn’t help but take pleasure from it.


After thoroughly reading the post, I was hesitant to apply. What if this were some new way for law enforcement to collect information on potentially dangerous people? I thought. I applied regardless, and after about a week, I finally received the confirmation email. The email contained almost all of the same information as the post. I scrolled down to the bottom, which contained their meeting schedule. “Hmm, next Friday?” I said. After I had passed the idea around in my head for several days, I decided to go. I was still nervous, but also excited. I was finally going to get the chance to speak about these urges, and not have someone shame me for them. At least I hoped I wouldn’t be. I had never told anyone about them before, but could you blame me? This isn’t exactly a problem everyone struggles with.


Friday came quickly, and as I stood outside the house I was told to meet at, anxiety began to build. Once again, what if all this was a setup? I thought. I swallowed my fears and made my way to the front door. I gave a few firm knocks, and a woman opened and greeted me. She was a cute brunette, and she looked to be in her late twenties.


“Oh hello, are you here for the group?” She said with a cheerfulness about her.


“Yes, yes I am,” I said as I reached out to shake her hand.


“Good to meet you,” she said while returning my gesture,” please come in and make yourself at home. We will be starting soon, but first, which group are you in?”


I paused and was confused by her question. “I thought it was just the one group?” I asked.


“Oh no, there are actually four groups,” she said, “one group wouldn’t be big enough. You would be surprised by how many people we get. Group 4 has fewer people if you would like to start with a smaller group.”


“I’ll be in group four then,” I said before walking inside.

Greeting me were two large living rooms to the right and left. Each room had chairs placed in a circular pattern. There was also a staircase leading into what looked like another large space.


“Your group is in the left room,” the woman explained, ”you made the right choice coming here, and I hope we can help.”


“Thank you,” I said before taking my seat.

After about thirty minutes of waiting, both of the bottom rooms now looked full of people. An older man in our circle, probably about sixty, stood from his chair and introduced himself.


“Hello everyone, my name is Troy Baker, and I’ll be mediating tonight. I would like to start by saying how proud I am that you’re all here tonight. I know all of you are probably nervous and hesitant, but I want you all to know you’re safe here. Now, I see that we have some new faces here tonight. Would anyone like to introduce themselves?” 


After a few seconds of silence, another man in the group broke the tension.

“I would,” he said, “My name is Mike.”


“Nice to meet you, Mike,” Troy responded, “Would you like to tell the group a bit about yourself and maybe why you’re here?”


“Umm sure,” Mike said with an unsure tone, “I was just a young boy when it started. It was small with just some thoughts, images, and fantasies. But after a few years, I started to experiment with dissecting animals. Mostly small ones like birds, rodents, and the occasional cat. Taking away the lives of animals brought a sense of comfort. I would strangle, stab, drown, electrocute, and then dismember them to finish. I felt in complete control, and my mind would become free and clear again. But the older I got, and the harder life got, I needed to do it more and more often.  Recently, it hasn’t been helping at all.


Mike went silent before Troy responded, “That was very brave of you son. Not a lot of people can open up about their thoughts and actions like that.”


Mike’s story fascinated me. I too had considered killing animals for pleasure, but I didn’t think it would provide enough satisfaction to satiate me. Besides, I actually liked and respected animals. It was people I had a vendetta against.


Troy turned his gaze towards me, “How about you son? Would you feel comfortable introducing yourself to the group?”


I nodded in agreement and told them about my disgust for people. About how I hated my own life, and explained my feelings towards how others enjoyed theirs. After I was done, I scanned the room. Everyone looked visibly uncomfortable with what I was saying. I took a deep breath before finishing, “but now I’m here, and looking for help.”


Troy stood again, “Thank you, Eli.” He said before giving me the same comforting message that he gave Mike.


After Troy sat back down, another woman raised her hand before saying she wanted to go next. She told the group about how she hated her parents and wanted to kill them. After she explained herself, she broke down in tears. Troy began to comfort her before calling the meeting to a close. After the group stood and exchanged pleasantries, I made my way over to Mike who was standing on the porch.


“Hey, it’s Mike right?” I said while tapping him on the shoulder.


“Yeah, What’s up?” He asked.


“I don’t have a whole lot of people who I can talk to about these sort of things, so I was wondering if you would like to get some lunch? I asked. 


“Umm, sure, why not?” He said with a sign of hesitation.


“Great! How does Jen’s Diner sound?” 


“Sounds good.” He said before giving a slight smile.


After a few-mile drive, I pulled into the diner parking lot. Mike pulled in right after. We walked inside and were approached by an attractive young waitress. 


“How many?” She asked.


“Two,” I answered, “and can we get a booth?”


“Sure can! Right this way.”


She guided us to our booth before asking, “So what can I start you two off with to drink?”


“I’ll take a water.” Said Mike.


“Sure thing, and you sir?” 


I looked deep into her eyes. She looked so sweet and innocent. “I’ll have the same,” I said with a smile.


“Okay, I’ll have those waters out to y’all shortly.” She said before walking off.


“So Eli, what made you want to join the… well…you know… the group?” Mike asked while seeming a bit fidgety.


“I guess I finally felt like it was time to get some help. Though, I don’t remember you ever saying what you wanted out of the group?” I asked.


“Well, I guess you could say I want help, but I also kinda don’t.” Mike said while looking down and avoiding eye contact.


“Same,” I said with a chuckle, “I want help, but I still really wanna try it at least once.”


His eyes looked up with a glimpse of curiosity curiosity in his eyes. “You know I was-“ Mike said before being cut off.


“Here are those waters,” said the waitress, “are y’all ready, or do you need a few more minutes?”


I looked at Mike and gestured to confirm before responding, “Yeah, we’re ready. I’ll take the club house sandwich and chips.”


“All righty, and what will you have?” She said while looking at Mike.


“I’ll have the working man’s burger with fries and no mayo please,” Mike said while looking more comfortable and open.


“Sure thing, I’ll be back with y’all’s orders as soon as it’s ready.” She said before once again, heading back to the kitchen.”


“Back to what I was saying,” Mike said after taking a sip of water, “I had an idea. What if just once, we follow through with our urges? You know… just to see if we truly have it in us or not.”


I felt it was a great idea before saying, “I don’t know, are you sure that’s something you want to do?”


“Yes,” he said with confidence, “I’ve been sure for a long time.”


When he said that, I could hear the seriousness in his tone.I reached out my hand to meet his. It felt like two partners agreeing on a business deal. After a few minutes went by, the waitress returned with our food.


“Here you are. One clubhouse sandwich with chips, and one working man’s burger with fries with no mayo. Enjoy!” 


We both thanked her before returning to our conversation. “So, do you have anyone in mind?” I said.


I saw him peer over my shoulder to the kitchen window. He looked like a hungry predator who had just caught sight of a plump hog. “How about her,” he said, “I think she would work.”


I turned to look back while having a good idea who he was referring to. It was at our gorgeous waitress. “Don’t you think she would be a bit risky? Especially, since she looks young and is probably known by a lot of customers? Wouldn’t people notice if she went missing?” I asked.


“Of course,” he said, “but there isn’t anyone going to suspect us. We’re nobodies to her with no connections.”


“Ok, we’ll do it,” I said hoping he was right.


A few more minutes went by, and we finished our meals. The waitress came and gave us our bills.


“Here you both are. Will you be needing anything else?” She asked.



“No,” Mike responded, “I think we’re good.”


As the waitress walked back to the kitchen, Mike was eyeballing her up and down. We made are way back to our vehicles. 


“Meet me here tomorrow, and we can start planning,” Mike said.


“Got it.” I agreed before shaking his hand once more.


I sat in my car while I watched Mike drive off in his truck. Soon after, I headed back home. I lived in a little apartment located in a more run-down part of town. It was all I could barely afford while working as a bookkeeper for a small local shop. Later that night while lying in bed and staring up at the ceiling, the feeling of losing control, which I was all too familiar with had returned to me. I thought long and hard trying to cling to the idea Mike and I had. I was hoping to be comforted by it, and it soon proved I was right. The next day, I met up with Mike at the diner at around seven o’clock in the evening just as we had planned. We had parked in the abandoned parking garage across the street to help get a better view. I got out of my car to hop into Mike older pick up truck.


“There she is,” Mike said while looking through a pair of binoculars, “hello gorgeous.”


“So what’s the plan here Mike?” I asked him.


“I think we should just follow her home to start. See if she lives with other people or not.” He responded.


After about two hours went by, the diner looked to be closing for the night. We sat a while longer and waited for the waitress to come out. About thirty minutes later, we saw her getting into her car. Mike started the engine, and we made our way to the garage exit. We followed her for what felt like thirty minutes out of town. She led us out into the country, which wasn’t a shock since we lived in a small rural town in Georgia. She pulled off onto a dirt road. We followed a bit longer before she pulled into what looked like a driveway. We crept up in front of her home with our headlights off. Mike pulled out his binoculars again.


“Should we just do it now?” I asked.


“No,” he answered sternly, “we don’t even know if she lives alone or not yet. Besides, I wanna take her back to my place. I live in a nice, quiet, and deserted place like this.”


“Your place?” I asked him.


“Yeah, my place. If I’m gonna do this, I want to do it right.” He said sounding like a tradesman talking about his craft.


“Okay,” I said not wanting to upset him.


He didn’t respond, and instead just kept watching her. She pulled out her keys, unlocked the front door, and went inside.


“Huh, she turned on the porch light. Maybe she is giving us the go-ahead to come on in.” Mike said while chuckling.


I laughed with him before he pressed on the gas pedal. After we hit paved road again, he asked me, “You wanna come over to my place? I’ll show you what I got prepped.”


Curious, I answered, “Sure, why not?”


“Great!” He said sounding excited, “I think you’ll love it, and I think it’ll help give you more confidence in our plan.”


He drove us back to his place, and he was right. It was in the middle of nowhere. A small mobile home on a piece of land that had a big barn In The back. We got out and walked around back to the barn.


“This is it,” he said sounding proud, “this is where we’re gonna do it.”


It looked old while littered with cobwebs and hay. The left wall when walking through the entrance, was covered in saws, hatchets, machetes, rakes, and even had a clever. It looked like a scene pulled right out of a slasher film. The right wall had metal rings, with what looked like chains and cuffs looped through them. They were lined up in a row leading all the way to the back, and it looked like a dungeon. Lastly, In the center was a large rectangular concrete slab, which looked to be about four feet high, seven feet in length, and another four feet in width. It too had metal loops drilled into it, and I could see leather straps lying on top.


“Wow, this is pretty impressive Mike. Are you sure you haven’t done this before?” I asked while laughing.


“No,” he said while grinning and laughing, “but I’ve been planning and thinking about it for years. I just haven’t had the gumption to finally commit to it, but now thanks to you, I do.”


“Well after getting a good look at this place, I think everything is gonna go great,” I said.


“Hey, do you wanna come in for a beer?” He asked.


“Sure, why not,” I said after checking my watch, “It’s only midnight. I’ll have one before we head back to my car”


We stepped back out through the large barn doors, and Mike locked them back before making our way to his mobile home. We walked inside with Mike leading the way, and I could hear Mike fumbling around while trying to find the light switch. Finally, the lights came on, and Mike went to the kitchen to fetch us a couple of beers.


“So do you live alone here, or do your folks live here too?” I asked.


“I got this place all to myself. My parents passed a few years back, and since I’m an only child, it all got left to me.” He said before handing me a beer. 


“What happened to them?” I asked hoping not to upset him.


“Died right in there,” Mike said while pointing to what looked like a master bedroom, “ I woke one day and found them still in bed. Cold to the touch and not moving. You know I buried them out back. Momma always hated the idea of being buried in a place full of strangers, so figured home would be more comfortable for her.”


“And what about your dad, is he buried here too?” I asked, very curious to know more.


“Technically,” Mike said before letting out a loud laugh, “as long as you consider being turn into pig shit being buried. Even that is probably too good for him.”


Not wanting to push the subject further, I kept silent and nodded. We continued talking for a bit longer while we finished our beers. As I stood up from his couch ready to head back, I started feeling nauseous and could barely hold my footing.


“Can’t handle one beer?” He said before I finally stumbled to the floor. 


“Ice water,” I said while trying to hold back vomit. Mike nodded before bringing me a glass. I poured some on my face, but it didn’t help. I was in and out of consciousness for many hours, but I do remember feeling rocks and sticks rubbing against my back like I was being dragged. Next, I could hear chains rattling, and soon after, metal cuffs clamped shut around my wrists. I felt the metal dig tightly into my skin. After that, I didn’t come to until a stinging beam of sunlight pierced my eye lids from a hole in the barn wall. I looked around still feeling the lingering effects from whatever was in my drink. It was hot and humid, and my clothes were drenched in sweat. My hands were numb from being in the cuffs for so long. Mike was nowhere in sight, and I couldn’t  hear much of anything outside. I tried wiggling the chains loose, but I had no luck. As the day went by, and the lingering effects went away, so did the sunlight. The sun was setting, and the barn was soon plunged into darkness. Headlights shot through cracks in the walls and lit up the barn. Soon after, I heard the sound of crunching pine straw coming towards the barn. The sound of the barn doors opening sent chills up my spine, I started hyperventilating, and my stomach turned from the thought of what he was gonna do to me.


“Breathe Eli,” said Mike after turning on the bright overhead lights, “I haven’t even started yet.”


“Wha… why are you doing this? I thought we were a team?” I said after catching my breath.


“No Eli. We weren’t a team. I do like you though, so I’m sorry I have to do this. If I had the strength to not give in to my temptations, I would.” He said in a dead monotone voice that I had yet heard from him.


“What are you going to do to me?” I asked while trying to control my breath.


“Eli, I’m gonna be honest with you. It’s not gonna be good for you. I have temptations and compulsions that go beyond just killing.” He said before filling a syringe. 


My stomach and chest burned with fear, and I feel my body wanting to convulse. He walked over to me before sticking me in the arm with the needle. I was begging him to stop, but he just told me to hush. It didn’t take long for the effects to take hold, and I was out like a light again. After I returned to what I assumed was going to be a brief time back in the land of the living, I found myself lying on the concrete slab. My legs, arms, torso, and neck had leather straps tethering me to it. After many hours of being restricted from using the restroom, I could smell my soiled clothes. I felt like an animal locked in a pen and ready for the slaughter. As I laid there marinating in my own waste, I could hear whistling approaching the barn. Once again, the loud noise from the barn doors opening filled the air.


“Good lord man, it smells like fucking piss and shit in here,” he said while chuckling, “perhaps I should have put you in some diapers.”


I didn’t say anything in response. I didn’t have anything left to say to Mike that wasn’t already said. He then grabbed the cleaver that was hanging on the wall before walking over to me. He rubbed my legs down with what smelled like alcohol. After he had wiped down my legs, he grabbed my left leg to hold it still, and then raised his right arm holding the cleaver. He looked like a butcher ready to get to work. His arm swung down in full force, and I heard the bones in my leg crunch. A sharp pain rang loud through my leg. With every swing, I hear crunch after crunch. I could hear my flesh tearing and my blood gushing out. I started to blacked out from the pain.


“No, no, no,” Mike yelled after splashing ice-cold water in my face, “we’re not done yet.”


I looked down at my body, and I could see my leg. It was sitting in a gray bucket that had been set between my legs. I threw up from the gruesome sight. Mike wiped my blood from his hands and face with a cloth before grabbing my right leg.


“Almost done Eli.” He said before hacking away again. I saw my blood splash across his face once more. The pain was too severe for me to stay conscious. The next thing I remember was ice-cold water soaking my face, and once again, bringing me back.


“All done for now,” he said while patting my face, “you sewed up real nice Eli.”


I looked back down to see that the bucket was gone, but so were both of my legs. I had stitches all over the nubs where my legs once were. Everything from just below my knees was gone.


“Come on let’s get you chained back up,” Mike said while undoing the arm straps.


“No needles this time?” I asked him sarcastically.


“Planning on running away?” He asked while returning the same sarcastic tone before letting out a sickening laugh. He then picked me up, and tossed me over his shoulder. As he was walking me back over to the chains, I saw that he had an old pocket knife tucked in his back pocket. I reached for it, and luckily my arms were just long enough. I managed to grab it and drive it into the back of Mike's neck. I fell and hit the ground hard after Mike dropped me. He stumbled for a second before finally hitting the ground as well. His clothes were soaked in blood, and I couldn’t tell how much was mine or his. Mike leaned up against the concrete slab before showing me his eyes, which were now filled with rage.


“Fuck you!” He yelled in between spitting up blood. Eventually, his words became nothing more than bloody gurgling, and then his body went limp. I crawled to the barn doors and was barely able to get one of them open. I managed to make it to the mobile home before finding my cellphone in his nightstand. I called the police and told them the address, which I found off a piece of mail sitting on the coffee table. I sat on the floor in his room until the police finally busted down the front door. Two officers rushed in and lifted me up before carrying me outside. Two paramedics met them, and they took care of me from there. The whole ride in the back of the ambulance, all I could think about was what would happen if Mike had some evidence of what we were planning together. After they got me to the hospital, they cleaned my wounds and redid the stitches. A few hours went by and an officer walked into my room.


“How are you doing son?” The officer asked.


“I could be better,” I said before letting out a grown from the pain.


“I’m sorry for asking. Anyway, I’m Detective Harrington,” he responded, “and I wanted to ask you about the man who did this while your memory is still fresh.”


I was reluctant, but I knew he was probably right. “Sure, what do you need to know?”


“Do you remember what happened when he abducted you?”


“It was while I was walking out to my car a few days ago.” I lied hoping he would buy it.


“And do you remember where this happened?” He asked.


“No,” I lied again, “I don’t remember much of what happened before waking up in the barn. He stuck me in the neck with something and I was out.”


“Okay, okay and did the perpetrator ever mention anything about his parents, or maybe a woman by the name of Emily Baker. Detective Harrington asked.


“He told me they died a few years back, but not much else, and I don’t know an Emily Baker. Who is she?” I asked.


He scratched his beard and finished writing in his notes before saying, “We think she was who he was targeting next. She’s just some waitress at a local diner, but you don’t need to worry about those details.”


“You sure?”


“I’m positive son. You just get some rest. We’ll we can continue after you get a little better” He said before stepping back out.


After a few days in the hospital, the doctors saw me fit to go home and I was wheeled out to my father’s car. He thanked the nurse for wheeling me out before he loaded me into his car. On the way home, he tried talking to me and asked me questions about what had happened, but I didn’t answer. I stared out the window not saying a word. After he figured out I wasn’t up for talking, we finished the ride in silence. When we pulled into the driveway, he helped me inside and laid me down in the guest bedroom. While lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling not blinking or uttering a word. I could feel pain in my legs that weren’t there. I hated the bastard for what he did to me. I felt betrayed by someone who I thought was becoming my friend. By someone just like me. I guess it’s for the best though. Now nobody has to worry about what I could do anymore.",3,1752697080.0,creepcast,0,0.81,False

I’d love to find people who are also open to meeting in person eventually, whether it’s for coffee, gigs, gaming, or just hanging out.

Who I’m Hoping to Connect With:

Aged 18-25 (a little older is okay if you're genuinely friendship-minded)

Based in the UK - ideally London or nearby

Interested in eventually meeting up and building a real connection

Comfortable with chatting regularly, gaming, or the occasional voice call

A Bit About Me:

⚽ I play football weekly & a big fan of the sport

🤘 Into rock & metal, and always up for gigs

🎮 Gamer (mostly single-player, story-driven stuff)

🎢 Huge fan of theme parks, go-karting, and adrenaline-filled days out

🎬 Into Marvel and all things nerdy

🧠 Neurodivergent, emotionally self-aware, and always happy to listen

What I’m Not Looking For:

One-word replies or ghosting after a day

People just messaging out of boredom

Surface-level convos with no real intention behind them

What I Am Looking For:

Effort, consistency, and actual interest in getting to know each other

People who want to build a connection that could lead to hanging out IRL

Ideally you're into the same interests, but not required

If this sounds like something you’d be up for, feel free to message and just let me know your age, gender, location, and a bit about you, so I know you’ve read this.

Looking forward to meeting a few people who are also tired of flaky chats and actually want something real.",1,1752696923.0,MakeFriendsUK,0,1.0,False

I’ve been hearing so much about VPNs, especially with all the random ads I keep getting on YouTube. But I didn’t really want to pay for one right away, since I’m just testing things out and seeing what I even need it for.

I downloaded a couple free VPNs for PC, like one called Betternet and another one I’d never even heard of before. They worked... kinda. One kept disconnecting every 10 minutes and the other had super slow speeds that made YouTube buffer like it was 2008 again. Also I’m kinda paranoid about the whole “free but at what cost” thing, like I don’t want my data being sold or anything weird running in the background.

I'm not looking to torrent or anything intense, just basic protection for browsing, maybe streaming shows when I travel. Has anyone actually used a free VPN that felt solid, safe, and didn’t annoy you every 5 seconds to upgrade to premium? I’m not against upgrading later, just not yet. Would love to hear what worked for you.",1,1752696887.0,ComputerHardware,1,1.0,False

1m1n8q6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m1n8q6,What do you think about mine?,"Here are my 4 tattoos. They were done in 2 different shops by 3  artists. I will give you guys the context and ideas behind each one 

1) caffeine molecule - done 11 years ago, left forearm. I am addicted to coffee and, being a chemical engineer (studying at the time), I thought this was a cool minimalistic idea for my first tattoo

 2) four lines wrapping around my arm with Morse code letters - done 6 years ago, right forearm. This tattoo is a tribute to my late grandparents. The letters are the initials of the nicknames I called them by: T, A, N, T. A and N being symmetrical, I think it worked pretty well. I plan to do the same thing for my parents once they pass away (hopefully a long way down the road) in my left arm

3) right forearm, done 1 month ago - as I said I am a chemical engineer, and so his my wife whom I met while we were in college. We got married and had a baby boy in November 2023. I always wanted to have a tattoo representing him, so, given that background, I thought a symbolic way to do that was to have a chemical element representation of him, with his initial, date of birth, time of birth, weight and size

4) left calf, done 4 years ago - this one combines the omega from God of War (one of my favourite video games) and a lion (drawn by myself) which represents my favorite animal and the football team I  support.

Simple hi’s and bye’s have developed into more casual chitchat, and we’ve recently even gone out to get coffee together in between class. Twice now I’ve invited her to study together in the library and she’s shown up on both occasions with no hesitation. She doesn’t really talk to many people in class outside of those she knew in undergrad and she’s even pretty sassy towards me sometimes. Downside is that she rarely initiates conversations over text or even IRL but if we’re being honest she isn’t super chatty anyway and from what I’ve noticed just eats solo during our lunch breaks. I’ve been trying to get a read on her but just can’t. How can I progress this without crossing a boundary or lead to a miscommunication? ",1,1752696823.0,self,2,1.0,False

I eat a couple eggs with butter and cheese slices every morning. I have meat for lunch and dinner. I have full fat yogurt and/or sour cream for snacks. I have well under 20 grams of low carb vegetables per day (one cup broccoli -  6 grams carbs…). I have a T butter as a snack a couple times per day. 

I honestly felt great the first couple weeks. This is especially true after loosely following the vegan diet for years. I’m concerned about the racing heart and the insomnia. 

I read your guidelines about electrolytes. Please advise. I’m taking 1/4 teaspoon sea salt, 105mg potassium chloride capsules, 1000 mg magnesium malate tablets. I bought them on Amazon. Is that not enough potassium?  Too much of anything else?  I drink a minimum of 16oz of water when I take these. I drink water (coffee in the morning) throughout the day.
