On the back of a coffee stained progressive insert, he jotted a couple ‚Äúhappy‚Äù memories which weren‚Äôt even his own memories. They were memories of me and my grandmother she told often. 

It‚Äôs so strange. The memories evoke happy nostalgia. But he wasn‚Äôt there for them. So why? Piggy back on a happy memory in hopes I‚Äôll associate them with him?

Also sad that he doesn‚Äôt have his own damn memories of me little. So focused on himself, only the memory repeated 100s of times by my grandmother is what he thinks is my childhood.

1nax7lc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Naples_FL/comments/1nax7lc/relocating_from_london_to_naples_with_young/,Relocating from London to Naples with young family - seeking advice and local perspectives,"Hi folks. I'm researching US towns to move to. Currently, we reside in Hampstead (a somewhat affluent area of North London, UK). We're Eastern Europeans, not English. I'm in my 30s, and I'll be moving with my wife and toddler. Our motivation for the move is safety and economic prospects. Sadly, London has become quite unsafe ‚Äî to the point where my wife isn't comfortable being outside by herself after 7pm. Meanwhile, in terms of taxes and cost of living, it's more expensive than Naples. Basically, it's turning into San Francisco, where I lived in the (brighter) past :)

I'll be in town on a scoping mission during the week of September 22nd. I've scheduled tours at CSN and Seacrest. I tried reaching out to recent graduates from these schools on Instagram, but very few people responded. I suspect my outreach came across as suspicious by American standards.

How would you recommend I spend a week in Naples to get a sense of what living there would be like? Also, if there are events where I could meet locals, I'd appreciate any suggestions. I'm open to meeting for a cup of coffee as well.
We're also considering Highland Park, TX, so if you have a brutally honest opinion comparing Florida and Texas, I'd love to hear it.

1nax7ih,https://i.redd.it/sbx3mfz7ornf1.jpeg,Build a $2 dev tool - 14 paying user in 24 hr (Animated icons library for lifetime use),"Hey folks üëã
I launched a tiny SaaS - http:// animojiapp.vercel.app as a side project last week basically a library of animated icons for developers. I priced it at $2 one-time for lifetime use. 

Honestly thought nobody would pay, but within the first 24 hrs I got 14 paying users üéâ

Here‚Äôs what actually worked vs. what was a waste:

‚úÖ What worked:
Kept pricing super low-friction (less than coffee = no-brainer).
Shipped a barebones MVP fast instead of polishing forever.
Shared the build story people engaged more with the journey than the product.

‚ùå What didn‚Äôt:
Overbuilding UI (nobody cared yet).
SEO/blog posts (0 traffic early).
Cold DMs ‚Üí total waste.

It‚Äôs still super early, but this was my first time seeing Stripe emails hit, and it felt real. 

I‚Äôm planning to add more icons + a cleaner UI over time so it can grow into a proper dev resource.

Going to take about a week to gather and cover everything.

811 came out and marked everything, and I discovered our irrigation system runs right through the middle of the plot! We can hook up a drip irrigation system directly when we‚Äôre ready with little effort.

A neighbor contributed a black compost bin, I built a pallet palace myself from pallets destined for a landfill.

The neighbors are starting to participate!

Test plot of lettuce, arugula, and broccoli are sprouting!

Signing up for a chip drop this week/next to cover the area.

I‚Äôve been pulling a trash bag full of grocery store scraps daily and adding to the compost pile‚Ä¶ running out of browns!  The two Starbucks within one block have been unending sources of coffee grounds.

I‚Äôm seriously contemplating composting the entire area after the chip drop‚Ä¶ but the neighbors might not take kindly to a big ass pile of rot. Maybe I‚Äôll just keep adding copious  amounts of coffee grounds to the wood chips and see what happens.


Wish me luck!

I attended a small meetup at Phoenix Mall ‚Äì it was 2 guys and 2 girls. The guys honestly gave off total chapri vibes, and the girls were insisting we all go to a specific club in Viman Nagar. Personally, I felt it was too much for a first-time meetup, so I suggested we just grab a coffee and chill. But the boys instantly agreed to the club plan just because the girls said so, which felt a bit off to me. I decided not to join them.

So now I‚Äôm wondering ‚Äì are there any normal girls here who are genuinely up for simple meetups in public places (like Phoenix Mall, coffee shops, etc.) rather than straight clubbing? Or maybe any mixed friend groups in Pune who meet casually without such pressure?

1nax4zd,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundChecked/comments/1nax4zd/explore_the_best_electric_kettle_kitchenaid/,Explore the Best Electric Kettle KitchenAid KEK1222 Worth Buying?,"It‚Äôs been a few weeks since I got my hands on the KitchenAid KEK1222PT, and it's almost too charming to describe. This petite pistachio-colored electric kettle has become a staple in my kitchen routine. There's something oddly satisfying about this compact beauty, from its compact footprint to its functionality. Although it's not entirely perfect, it offers a lot to appreciate for tea and coffee enthusiasts like myself. Over time, I‚Äôve noticed its strengths, along with some quirks worth mentioning, and I‚Äôll cover them all in this review.  

**Design and Aesthetics**  
The first thing that immediately grabs attention is the retro-inspired design. It's like a cute vintage prop you‚Äôd imagine in a pastel diner from the ‚Äò50s. Thanks to its pistachio finish and smooth aluminum handle, the kettle doubles as both a functional appliance and a decor piece on my kitchen counter. The stainless steel body not only adds durability but elevates the overall elegance of this product. Its compact size ensures it doesn‚Äôt take up valuable space, which is particularly great for smaller counter spaces or apartment kitchens.  

**Ease of Use**  
This electric kettle couldn‚Äôt be simpler to operate. The LED on/off switch is as straightforward as it gets‚Äîno fancy dials or settings, just one click and it‚Äôs on. An indicator light that shows when the kettle is heating keeps everything guess-free. This was a relief for my perpetually distracted mornings, where I‚Äôve been guilty of forgetting if I‚Äôd begun heating water or not. The removable lid allows me to fill it up easily without a spill in sight, which is a big win for someone who struggles with pouring large kettles into a narrow opening.  

[Check KitchenAid KEK1222PT price on Amazon.](https://ultimodule.com/p/b012wf88qs/)  

**Performance and Efficiency**  
Performance-wise, this small but mighty kettle isn‚Äôt the quickest to boil water compared to larger models, but it‚Äôs no slouch either. The 1.25L capacity makes it an ideal fit for personal use or small household settings. Whether I want to make two cups of tea or prepare my French press coffee in the morning, the size feels just right. The base's cord storage is a game-changer for keeping my counter organized, though the cord itself is quite short, limiting placement options.  

The pouring spout is well-designed for precision, and any worries about limescale interfering have been addressed with the inclusion of a removable filter. This feature is especially handy if you live in an area with hard water. As someone who's had way too many kettles with stubborn lime buildup, this detail truly stands out.  

**Pluses**  
- Aesthetic design that fits well in small, stylish kitchens.  
- Easy-to-use LED indicator and straightforward controls.  
- Compact size saves counter space.  
- Sleek pouring spout with removable limescale filter for clean, smooth pours.  
- Removable lid and cord storage provide daily convenience.  

**Downsides**  
- Slightly slow boil speed compared to higher-wattage models.  
- Limited capacity may not satisfy larger households.  
- Short power cord could limit placement flexibility.

**Competing Products**  
While this electric kettle nails the design and ease of use, there are alternatives in the category worth considering. For instance, the Cuisinart PerfecTemp offers adjustable temperature settings, catering to specific tea or coffee brewing preferences‚Äîgreat for enthusiasts who want precision but less stylish compared to this KitchenAid kettle. On the more budget-friendly end, the AmazonBasics Stainless Steel kettle lacks the same aesthetic appeal but tends to boil water a little quicker due to its higher wattage. On the other hand, the SMEG retro kettle, a direct rival in terms of looks, offers a prettier but bulkier option, often at a noticeably higher price.  

**Worth Every Penny**  
While it's not the cheapest on the market, this kettle stands out in the value-for-money category. The KitchenAid KEK1222PT strikes a sweet spot between functionality, aesthetics, and reliability. Unlike basic electric kettles, it feels like a little luxury item you‚Äôll love to leave displayed. If you're someone who enjoys morning routines with a touch of style, this investment might make you smile.

1nax4t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Syncope/comments/1nax4t2/fainted_for_the_first_time_headache_and/,Fainted for the first time - headache and off-balance two days later,"I fainted for the first time ever while at a restaurant on Friday. Luckily, my wife caught me and brought me to the ground softly. I was out for ~10 seconds. When I came to, I was able to sit up, chat, and recover generally quickly.

Paramedics checked glucose, BP, and oxygen - they said numbers showed nothing that required immediate attention. BP was a bit high (150/90), but they said that was normal after recovering from a fainting spell.

After talking through my day with them, their best guess was dehydration. I did go out the previous night and had some drinks. Then had two cups of coffee, ran a few miles, and spent some time in the hot tub throughout the day Friday. Not setting myself up for success exactly‚Ä¶ 

All that said, two days later, I have what feels like a pressure headache and I‚Äôm still out of it - slightly off balance, a bit foggy, etc. Normally run/bike every day, but I haven‚Äôt because I‚Äôm worried how my body will react.

I have a follow-up appointing with my GP in a week (soonest appointment they had), but I‚Äôm wondering if these ongoing symptoms require a trip to the ER to get checked sooner.

Any advice from those who have fainted before would be greatly appreciated. This is all new and very scary to me. ",1,1757261184.0,Syncope,0,1.0,False
1nax2sa,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatelygranolamoms/comments/1nax2sa/feeling_incredibly_guilty_at_8_months_pregnant/,Feeling incredibly guilty at 8 months pregnant,"Before falling pregnant I was extremely health focused, especially because we did IVF as well. Eating healthy, working out, managed my intake of high glycemic foods, tried to eat organic or at least stay away from the dirty dozen, swapped nearly everything in our house for low tox alternatives, etc. 

Fast forward to pregnancy and I was extremely sick for the first 20 weeks, with bouts of nausea. I‚Äôve been craving connivence foods, and ordering a lot of take out while bed rotting. I‚Äôm 34 weeks now and while I have been making more of an effort to get back into eating organic and healthy home cooked meals, I don‚Äôt always succeed. I have McDonald‚Äôs breakfast or lunch here and there. I‚Äôve ordered some coffees in plastic cups instead of my take along stainless steel, and I‚Äôve also ordered stuff like ramen soup that comes in plastic.

1nax1ri,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Working-Hawk-1982/comments/1nax1ri/the_best_handheld_vacuums/,The Best Handheld Vacuums,"Handheld vacuums have come a long way since the old dustbusters I remember growing up with. These days they‚Äôre actually pretty powerful little tools and way more useful than just picking up a couple crumbs. I‚Äôve tested a few around the house and in my car, and it‚Äôs honestly surprising how much time they save when you don‚Äôt feel like dragging out a big vacuum for small messes.

I‚Äôve had to deal with everything from pet hair on the couch to spilled cereal in the kitchen, and having a good handheld makes those little cleanups less of a hassle. Below are the ones that I think are the best:

## üèÜ Best Overall Option: [Ryobi 18V One+ Performance](https://productbible.com/blog/best-handheld-vacuums#ryobi-18v-one)

I picked up the Ryobi 18V One+ Performance because I already have a couple of Ryobi tools and batteries, and it turned out to be a great decision. The suction is no joke, when I tested it with random kitchen messes like flour and dry cereal, it pulled everything up in seconds. It only has one mode, but that single setting feels just as strong as the ‚Äúboost‚Äù option on other handheld vacuums I‚Äôve used, and the battery doesn‚Äôt die instantly like some of those do.

The attachments have been super handy too. The crevice tool actually fits perfectly into the corners of my car seats, and the pivoting brush does a good job of getting dog hair off the couch cushions. The brush‚Äôs rotating design means I don‚Äôt have to bend my wrist into weird angles, which is something I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd appreciate until I started using it.

The runtime has also impressed me. I usually get a solid 15‚Äì18 minutes out of it, which is more than enough to clean up the spots I need. Plus, the dustbin is huge compared to other handheld vacuums I‚Äôve tried, I don‚Äôt have to stop and empty it constantly. If you‚Äôre already in the Ryobi ecosystem, this thing is a no-brainer. The only downside is it‚Äôs a little bulky, and the neon green design isn‚Äôt subtle, but I‚Äôll take function over looks any day.

## üí∏ Best Budget Option: [BLACK+DECKER Dustbuster Blast](https://productbible.com/blog/best-handheld-vacuums#blackdecker-dustbuster)

I‚Äôve owned a few of these little BLACK+DECKER vacuums over the years, and the Dustbuster Blast is exactly what I‚Äôd expect from them: simple, lightweight, and cheap. I keep mine in the kitchen mostly for quick stuff like sweeping up crumbs or spilled coffee grounds, and it‚Äôs perfect for that. I even used it on window sills after noticing a layer of dust, and it worked without much effort.

One thing I really like is how light it feels. At just over two pounds, it‚Äôs something I can grab with one hand and move around quickly without feeling weighed down. The trigger-style switch is nice too because you can just tap it for quick bursts instead of running it nonstop. The fold-over brush surprised me, it‚Äôs actually useful for loosening up dirt on softer surfaces like cushions in my car.

Of course, this isn‚Äôt a deep-cleaning machine. It‚Äôs not great for pet hair or anything stuck into fabric, but that‚Äôs not what I bought it for. For the price, it does its job well, and it‚Äôs the kind of thing you don‚Äôt feel bad about keeping tucked in a closet for the occasional mess. If you just want something small and convenient without dropping a ton of cash, it‚Äôs hard to go wrong here.

## üíé Best Upgrade Option: [Dyson Car + Boat](https://productbible.com/blog/best-handheld-vacuums#dyson-car-boat)

The Dyson Car+Boat is kind of in its own category. I borrowed one from a friend before deciding if I wanted to spend the money, and I have to admit it‚Äôs ridiculously powerful. It feels like a downsized full-size vacuum, especially when using the motorized brush tool, it pulled sand and pet hair out of my car mats that other handhelds didn‚Äôt even touch.

The set of tools it comes with are super convenient. The extension hose is a lifesaver for getting into awkward spots between the seats, and the crevice tool works well for narrow gaps. I also appreciated the hygienic bin emptying system since I hate dealing with dusty filters and messy bins. Its nice not having to touch whatever nasty stuff it picks up.

That said, it‚Äôs definitely not the grab-and-go kind of handheld vacuum. It‚Äôs heavier than the budget options and more expensive, and the non-removable battery means you have to stop and recharge instead of swapping in a fresh one. But if you really want something with power and you clean your car or boat regularly, it‚Äôs worth it. Honestly, if I had a boat or more pets, I‚Äôd probably own one myself. For now, I‚Äôll stick with my Ryobi, but this one is a beast for anyone who needs the extra performance.",1,1757260986.0,u_Working-Hawk-1982,0,1.0,False

1nawxhp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wonsulting/comments/1nawxhp/the_30minute_playbook_for_the_perfect_coffee_chat/,The 30-minute playbook for the perfect coffee chat (that can lead to referrals & jobs),"Most people treat coffee chats like random small talk‚Ä¶ that is NOT the move (let me explain).

The best ones are structured, feel natural, and end with real opportunities (aka job referrals or opportunities).

Here‚Äôs a 30-min playbook you can copy for yours that I personally used:
‚Äî
Minute 0‚Äì5: Intro & Icebreaker

- Thank them for making time.
- Quick intro (school, role, interest, etc)
- Break the ice with something real if they ask ‚Äúhow are you?‚Äù (Ex: ‚ÄúI just made myself breakfast with eggs and bacon, now I‚Äôm excited to chat! How about you?‚Äù)
‚Äî
Minute 5‚Äì25: Their Story & Strategic Questions

Spend most of the time asking about them. Listen more than you talk.. you‚Äôll learn much more than you doing all the thinking, and then you‚Äôll find ways to provide value to the person.

Examples:
- ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs something you‚Äôve learned in your role that you didn‚Äôt expect?‚Äù Ôøº
- ‚ÄúIf you could restart in this role, what would you do differently?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúI‚Äôve read that the culture at [company] was [XYZ], but how would you describe the culture at [company]?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs been the biggest learning for you in the past year?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWhat do you like doing outside of work?‚Äù

Follow up on what they say. Keep it a conversation as much as you can!
‚Äî
Minute 25‚Äì30: The Ask

Only after rapport is built:
- ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been really interested in [specific role] at [company]. I saw the opening for [Job ID or title]. Based on my background in [X], how can I get an interview?‚Äù Ôøº-> in many instances, they will give you a referral
- If they just give advice, you can follow with: ‚ÄúWould you happen to know someone I could connect with or even refer me for this role?‚Äù Ôøº

Keep it light. If they say no, thank them anyway. If yes, follow up with your resume and the job ID right away!
‚Äî
After the Chat
- Send a thank you email/LinkedIn note. Call out something specific they said.
- If they referred you, keep them in the loop on progress Ôøº.

TLDR:
- 30-min coffee chat = 5 min intro, 20 min their story, 5 min referral ask.
- The key isn‚Äôt to simply read of a script; it‚Äôs making them feel heard, then asking the right way. Go crush it!

1nawv1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1nawv1a/you_probably_couldnt_last_three_months_homeless/,You Probably Couldn't Last Three Months Homeless Without Becoming a Deranged Drug Addict.,"I doubt if many of you reading this could last three months homeless without becoming a lunatic and a druggie. 

If you steam clean an old car, problems which were hidden by the dirt come to the surface. So it is with people when they become homeless. The character quirks become more prominent. Character flaws become bigger. Neurosis become uncontrollable.  Resentments replace morality. 

The reason? Being homeless means being stressed every single moment. It's a life of isolation, loneliness, self hatred and despair. For most homeless people, it's a downward spiral with more problems compounding the situation. 

Live in your car with everything you own? Now your car broke down and you have no way to fix it or move it. Now your car has been towed. You have nothing. You find blankets and learn to push a shopping cart. You feel the stares and the contempt of all who see you.

You sleep in the bushes and wake up on a mission to find a way to get clean. Every single morning, it's the same desperate search for a shower. If you are ever going to get a job, you have to be presentable. The smart people find the money to join a gym and rent a storage unit. Not everybody is able to do that. And where are you going to park your shopping cart?

You figure out where there is free coffee. You learn to keep track of when and where there are free meals provided by churches and social service. That becomes your new schedule. You also keep track of when businesses throw food in dumpsters. Dumpster diving becomes a daily occurrence. The greatest joy of your life is when you make a good score from a trash bin. More often, you find half spoiled food.

Everyone who sees you has contempt for you. What they don't know is that you hate yourself more than they every will. You learn to beg for money while you eventually hate the entire world. Instead of Good Samaritans, you are accosted by preachers who are happy to condemn you. You're a loser and you can't deny it. You envy dogs who dress better than you do.

You hang out with other homeless. Usually, it's a homeless veteran who will show you a few tricks to survive. A lot of homeless veterans have survivor's guilt and are punishing themselves.

Then comes the day when you break down crying. You can't help it or even articulate your overwhelming despair. You say ""fuck it"" and buy some booze. As the alcohol enters your system, you feel the first sense of relief you've had since this crisis began. The alcohol calms you. The stress is gone for a few hours.

So of course, you drink more. 

Now you're caught in the cycle of addiction. People now write you off as a drunk. And when you open your mouth, they consider you insane. They are happy to preach to you ""if you would only get sober..."" One night you go to bed in the bushes and are found days later dead. You're taken to the morgue and cremated. 

It's as if you never existed.

But your place in the bushes will soon be taken by somebody else who lived one paycheck away from homelessness and lost their job. The people homeless today are not the same people who were homeless a few years ago. All of those people died. The homeless population is continually being restocked.

In January 2024, there were approximately 771,480 people experiencing homelessness in the United States, a record-high number according to Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) data from their annual point-in-time count.

There but for the grace of God, go you.

In the summer of 2024 we had spaghetti leftovers and the sauce was kept separate from the noodles.  My husband had made himself a full large plate with the noodles and sauce on top.  I think the noodles are the most boring part by far and I realized buttered toast with the sauce is absolutely delicious.  My husband had just microwaved his big full plate and went to do something else.  While he was away for a couple minutes I decided to take his plate out and I popped a small mug filled with only sauce in there to heat up to go on toast.  When he returned he was angry and said I just ‚Äúhad‚Äù to ‚Äúget ahead‚Äù of him.  He literally spelled out this entire story of what I should have done instead.  According to him I should have shown myself to be a caring wife by testing the heat of his food with my finger and putting it back in the microwave when I saw it wasn‚Äôt hot enough.  Now in all the history of trying to anticipate anyone‚Äôs desires I would never have thought sticking your fingers in somebody‚Äôs food would be at the top.  My thinking was when the timer had stopped on the microwave it wasn‚Äôt in use during those minutes and it didn‚Äôt hurt for me to benefit from it.

The other day I made a pot of what is essentially lasagna without noodles substituting zucchini instead and I heated it in the crock pot.  Then last night I cooked steak with cheesy garlic potatoes and spinach.  One of the pieces of steak was very large and my husband had eaten a piece of it.  He said that specific piece was really good.  So I wanted to cut myself a piece and see what he was talking about.  This morning I took time to wake myself up with coffee and did have some drinkable yogurt before getting some real filling food.  My husband pulled out the pot of lasagna to heat up and then I cut myself some of the good steak and put some of the potatoes and spinach to heat up when he was done with the microwave.  We had an argument because I wasn‚Äôt done cutting the pieces of steak I wanted and he was trying to get some when I wasn‚Äôt done preparing my plate.  He repeated the old accusation and said I had been awake for plenty of hours to prepare food for myself and that I was just choosing this time to try to get ahead of him to make sure he couldn‚Äôt get to certain foods.  He had also been awake for hours waking himself up with coffee first, just not as long as I had been.

I didn‚Äôt think me preparing food on my own plate and waiting for him to finish using the microwave was getting in his way.  Also it‚Äôs weird to need to put a small piece of steak on a plate that‚Äôs already full with lasagna which is made with ground beef.",3,1757260477.0,NarcissisticSpouses,2,1.0,False
1nawtlj,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nawtlj/had_a_secret_experience_on_a_beach/,Had a secret experience on a beach,"I (43f) a really unusual experience on vacation and I‚Äôm trying to sort it out. 

My family and I return to the same vacation spot on a beach every summer. Seven days in a remote location, a chance to recharge. Every morning  take my coffee and a book to the same spot at sunrise, my solo time to start the day. 

On the first day of this visit I went to my beach spot as the sun was about to come up. There was a man swimming nearby, which was unusual (this beach is always deserted at sunrise). After about a minute I realize he was swimming completely naked. 

I felt like I had intruded, but at the same time nudity is not allowed on the beach. It was kind of a funny surprise, and he eventually left.  

The next day I showed up, same thing, same naked guy already there. The third day he wasn‚Äôt there when I arrived but he did show up and undress and swim.

I‚Äôm 9w+5d today. Unplanned but very welcomed! My husband and I were going to start ‚Äútrying‚Äù next year but SURPRISE! Thanks to my insurance for changing my BC to a crappy off-brand. I was even thinking to myself ‚ÄúI wonder if this will be less effective than my normal brand, but maybe that‚Äôs not the end of the world.‚Äù But honestly I LOVE the serendipitous spontaneity of it all. Wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. 


Before I took a pregnancy test, I thought I was having a mental health crisis. In some ways, it definitely still feels like that lol. But WAY more manageable now that I know what‚Äôs going on! I‚Äôve cut out coffee entirely (I‚Äôm very sensitive to substances) and switched to relaxing music (I‚Äôm usually a dubstep edm fan lol) and that has really helped keep my anxiety and heart rate come down. 


I have trouble sleeping - getting to sleep but also staying asleep. I feel WIRED all the time and the morning sickness/constantly needing to snack keeps me up late almost every night. Then there‚Äôs the intense TMJ, I‚Äôm waking up with such bad headaches. Apparently a surge of a particular hormone affects joints, including that one! It also doesn‚Äôt help that I can‚Äôt have weed either, which is how I usually get the ‚Äòstaying asleep‚Äô part to stick. 


But when I spoke with my OB she suggested Unisom for the morning sickness (also a sleep aid) and that I get back on my SSRI Lexopro in the meantime to manage the anxiety; that it has been rigorously tested in pregnancy and is even recommended for addressing PPD. Now I just have to find a psychiatrist all over again! Oi vey. 


I‚Äôve also had to change everything about my diet. In the before-times I was eating healthy and working towards fitness goals. Now I am testing different foods to avoid the shaky nauseous feeling that comes with morning sickness. So far, I‚Äôve found that FATS make my stomach feel settled better than other macros. Particularly butter is REALLY saving the day. If I eat a breakfast sandwich on sourdough, I‚Äôm set for hours. Some vitamins actually NEED fat for absorption, so I wonder if that is related?


I‚Äôm still working out with my trainer but we‚Äôve significantly dropped weight on most exercises, switched almost exclusively to dumbbells (instead of barbell) and eliminated all power moves requiring explosive strength. I‚Äôve also been continuing/slightly extending time on low impact cardio (incline walking and recumbent bike). 


We had to wait 3 weeks between finding out we were pregnant to getting in at my OB office for our first ultrasound, but what an amazing experience that was!! The ultrasound tech is so impressive these days - we felt like we could see so much! They were wiggling around a LOT in there and the tech said that the heartbeat was strong. 


My husband in and out of town during the summer for work, and due to some rescheduling, he was actually able to attend the first appointment!!!


I was so glad he was there, he remembered alllll the questions we had for the doctor - I was still riding the high from seeing our little squirming gummy bear and forgot all about the fears that had come up in the last several weeks. And then when I almost passed out from getting blood drawn, I was glad he could drive us home. 


Bless this man, he has truly been my rock through all of it. Truly, I couldn‚Äôt imagine doing this without him. I count myself among the lucky ones, I know even other seemingly good men are totally clueless and helpless once pregnancy starts. But (we‚Äôll call him) Nelson has been so amazing - he holds my bag when we go out, he has completely taken over chores around the house (I have to remind him that I live here too and am not so pregnant yet that I can‚Äôt help with dishes), he‚Äôs curious about my experiences and wants to help remedy any discomfort, he makes me food all the time or orders DoorDash from his account if there‚Äôs something particular I need. I don‚Äôt even know if I can remember all the amazing things that he has done for me and our little gummy bear during this time. Just all around an absolute winner of a husband, I sometimes just cry my eyes out thinking about how amazing he will be as a father when the baby comes. 


It makes me wonder if this is actually the B universe where we‚Äôre gender flipped and in the A universe he‚Äôs the pregnant one and I‚Äôm one of those totally clueless husbands! But I hope in that one that I can be at least half as good a partner as he has been to me for the last month. 


Our ultrasound was on Friday and once we saw that it was viable and healthy, I wanted to start telling my family. My parents were obviously really excited (my mom has been a total drama queen about WHEN will there be kids since Nelson and I got married). One of my sisters is unmarried and will be the cutest Disney auntie to our little squirt. 


My other sister, who I shared a room with for more than half of my adolescent life, broke out into tears immediately and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just so happy for you‚Äù. Which touched my heart and then I started crying. It was also somewhat unexpected since she‚Äôs not usually all that of an emotional person and has claimed that she doesn‚Äôt want to have kids herself (adoption, yes tho!). At this point, given her reaction, I wonder if she‚Äôs just scared. Of pregnancy, labor, and even passing down certain traits that she finds unfavorable. But I hope to talk to her more to show her that we have control over some of those things, and really there have been significant medical improvements in the last 3 decades since we were born! She is married and her husband also feels the way she does, but is very loving and supportive of her either way. SHE is the willful one, no doubt. 


We‚Äôre waiting to tell Nelson‚Äôs family until his summer work thing is over (just 1 more week!) so that he can answer all their questions. I‚Äôm going to tell my employer on Monday since there will be a lot of doctor‚Äôs appointments and I‚Äôm already almost to my second trimester, so they‚Äôre bound to find out sooner or later. One of my coworkers has already made a comment about my breakfast sandwich not being macro-friendly (I am usually very into the diet piece of fitness and talk about it ALLLL the time). 


All in all, we‚Äôre trying to do things as best we can. There will be mistakes along the way (and I know I‚Äôve already made a bunch in my weeks before finding out + going to see the OB), but we‚Äôre giving ourselves grace and trying not to stress too much about it. 


Reading the posts in this community helped me through those 3 weeks, searching to see if what I‚Äôm experiencing was normal (it was), and seeing what new experiences I can look forward to. I‚Äôm SO excited to be on this journey with all of you!!

Like the kind pigs roll in, only worse because this slop dares to have lighting that is not 100% physically accurate.

Now I dedicate my entire life to protecting humanity from this menace. My daily routine:

1.	Wake up.

2.    Pour coffee.

3.	Spend 8 to 12 hours combing through every art subreddit imaginable.

4.	Whenever I see a piece of art, any art, I zoom in like a forensic investigator. If a single muscle is even slightly autonomically incorrect (whatever that means), I smash my keyboard and type ‚Äúsoulless slop.‚Äù It does not matter if it is oil paint, a child‚Äôs drawing, or Michelangelo‚Äôs David. If the deltoid is not perfectly aligned, slop.

Sometimes people try to push back, like ‚ÄúHey, that‚Äôs a watercolor of my grandma‚Äôs cat, can you not?‚Äù but they do not understand. I am on a sacred mission. If you do not agree with me, then you too are a slop defender.

Remember, real art is flawless. Every shadow must obey the laws of physics. Every tooth must exist in the correct number. Every hand must contain exactly five fingers. The moment there is any deviation, it is proof the artist or machine or whoever has no soul.

This is the hill I have chosen to die on. My therapist says I am unwell, but what does she know? She probably thinks AI is a ‚Äútool‚Äù or some other corporate buzzword.

I really do appreciate boundaries and clarity, but this wasn‚Äôt warm or welcoming - it was a cold, corporate-style manual. It was LONG. I felt like I had just studied for an exam after reading it. Absolutely no stone was left unturned- There were multiple lengthy attachments covering everything from ‚Äúhelping before baby‚Äù to ‚Äúrules for visiting postpartum.‚Äù With all the documents included plus the email itself it had to have been at LEAST 40-50 pages. I‚Äôm just doing my best to convey the highlights. 

It started out reasonable with expected boundaries: no kissing the baby, wash your hands, don‚Äôt visit if you‚Äôre sick. Totally fine. But then it went way beyond:
	‚Ä¢	Advice clause: ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôve not asked for advice, keep your comments to yourself.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Baby prep help: A sign-up sheet with tasks that were mostly just home renovation projects - landscaping, rebuilding parts of the yard, even electrical work. The list was LONG. My husband and I were cracking up- especially because these people are loaded. Get professionals to help! 
	‚Ä¢	Meal prep binder: A 20+ page document with strict dietary rules, photos from cookbooks, specific recipes, and detailed instructions for how to act in their kitchen during a ‚Äúmeal prep party.‚Äù I just sent an Uber Eats gift card and tapped out.
	‚Ä¢	Notifications spreadsheet: If you wanted to be told when the baby arrived, you had to sign up and agree to a list of what would/wouldn‚Äôt be disclosed and what you could/couldn‚Äôt ask.
	‚Ä¢	Meeting baby: Required booking through a professional scheduling link. Personally, I wanted some flexibility postpartum, but hey. 
	‚Ä¢	Overnight visits: A separate link with rules about how to ‚Äúbook this‚Äù, instructions for remaking the bed when you leave, and an agreement that overnight guests must bottle-feed but can‚Äôt change diapers (you must wake up parents for this throughout the night since no one but parents are allowed to do so).
	‚Ä¢	Chores: excessive instructions for laundry (exact pumps of detergent, scoop measurements, machine settings), dishes, errands, pet care, etc. Plus: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask us to get up. Don‚Äôt ask us to show you anything. Don‚Äôt use our dishes, bring your own water bottle.‚Äù LOL. They even included their Peet‚Äôs coffee orders.

Some highlights that stuck with me:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúClear the room and find something else to do if mom is breastfeeding.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt raise conflict with us about anything until at least 6 months postpartum.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúAsk for consent before bringing gifts - no toys, no stuffed animals. We are not accepting gifts at this time.‚Äù 
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get offended if we ask you not to hold the baby. Only people we deem to be in good vision/ overall health are allowed to hold the baby.‚Äù 

I had been planning to drop by for a visit, but after reading this, I no longer feel comfortable. My husband joked we should just bring our own toilet paper and use the bathroom in the yard to avoid breaking a rule.

My takeaways:
	1.	The people who actually overstep boundaries and need micromanaging probably won‚Äôt read 4+ attachments/ links anyway.
	2.	Everyone else who‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù just ends up feeling put off. I‚Äôve heard from multiple family members that this email was super off-putting. 
	3.	With this many rigid expectations, resentment feels inevitable.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I respect boundaries - I think they‚Äôre healthy. But this wasn‚Äôt just boundaries; it was micromanagement in the form of a policy manual. And it made us, as family, feel more like employees than loved ones.",50,1757259752.0,BabyBumps,30,0.95,False

I abruptly stopped playing and began wading into the lake, totally bewitched by the beast‚Äôs movement.  Her grip was strong. She must be into asphyxiation was my initial thought.

1nawg2o,https://i.redd.it/kxctdyfyirnf1.jpeg,Results from blind tasting ceramic mug...,"After reading about different experiences with dura sip and why it MIGHT be preferable to regular steel I picked one up. 

I've been doing blind taste tests with light, medium, and dark roasts drinking with and without the lid.

Keep in mind these are my results and yours might vary. 

Does ceramic taste ""cleaner"" or different? IMO no it's not actually the taste or flavor. Can I tell the difference? YES! With blind tasting every pot with this cup and two other steel ramblers, I was able to identify when I used to ceramic everytime. The thing about it was not the taste but rather the FEEL. The way the coffee seemed to move in the cup was something that felt different when I took my sips. Is it so different that I it's not relegating all my old cups to the Goodwill? No, it's got pronounced enough that I would notice on a everyday basis. But if I really look for it and focus I was able to spot the difference everytime (ran the test over 9x. 

So TLDR, is ceramic noticeably better? SLIGHTLY but not for the actual taste more the feel.",4,1757259587.0,YetiCoolers,1,0.83,False

A long time ago, [Hana](https://www.youtube.com/@h-a-n-a-audios) filled the first script on her YT channel. Some people asked her for a part 2. If memory serves, Hana responded to one of them with something along the lines of- she probably wouldn't fill part 2 even if I wrote it, because much of what's good about the first script is its ambiguous ending.

I bring this up now, because I'm inclined to agree with her. I had no plans to write a sequel. It ended where it ended. But then someone - who wishes to remain anonymous- commissioned me a couple of weeks ago to write a sequel. I was going to decline. I put it off for a while. And then I agreed.

Part of the reason for my reluctance, is I wasn't sure if I could do justice to what I'd written earlier. But you know what I do when I'm filled with doubt?

I just write.

**SCRIPT:**

*(SFX: Faint synth-driven party music. Distant rumbling of thunder.)*

(Giggling) No, it won‚Äôt rain tonight. Now get into the pool already, helmet!

You‚Äôre just fine standing there at the edge? Come, now. Surely you aren‚Äôt going to let your boss swim all by herself?

Surely you aren‚Äôt going to let your loving *girlfriend* swim all by herself?

Baaaabe! Pleeeaaase! The water‚Äôs just the right temperature, and the pool isn‚Äôt deep. And it‚Äôs an infinity pool, and we‚Äôre at the top of an 80 storeyed building, so the skyline from here looks pretty cool. And you know what else is pretty cool?

The water. So get in already!

(A longer pause)

(Sighing) You‚Äôre still so shy. Is it all the people at this party? Is it the lights? The music, the atmosphere? If you‚Äôre feeling uneasy, we don‚Äôt have to stay. We can go somewhere else. Anywhere you want.

Are you sure, honey? You‚Äôre not just saying that to make me happy, are you?

Alright. Guess you can sit down on the pool chair then. Just stay close to the edge. Stay close to me. I don‚Äôt want you getting lost in the crowd again.

(Smirking) Good boy.

(Giggling) Whaaat?! You like it when I call you that! It‚Äôs a reward, for being *such* *a* *good boy.* (Smiling fondly) My sweet helmet.

I really wanted to bring you here. The Six Realms Rooftop Hotel is one of my favourite buildings in the city. Not only is the view from up here simply breath-taking, but it‚Äôs the very....the very *vibe* of this place, you know?

Yeah. It seems to fill you with this strange energy. This hope, that you‚Äôve only just begun your journey, and there are seemingly infinite paths before you. Each choice takes you down a different lane, but it‚Äôs possible to go back to the start.

It is. I mean- you and I are still here. (Smiling) Together.

I‚Äôm really glad you accepted my offer, helmet. You fit in so well at your new job! Even if I call you into my office one too many times each day.....sorry about that, by the way.

Yeah okay. I‚Äôm not sorry. At all. (Giggling) I mean, I want to spend as much time with you as I can. I have a photo of you on my desk, but it only makes me miss you more.

I was lonely for a long time before I ran into you again, and then I only felt it more acutely. What I‚Äôd missed, what I couldn‚Äôt have, what I....I needed, from the bottom of my heart.

I don‚Äôt just want you. I need you, helmet. I can never fully apologize for how I treated you in the past. All I can do, is show you through my actions in the present, that I really do love you.

I always did. I‚Äôm sorry it took me so long to say it to you. I have waited such a long time, to see that look on your face again. To see your eyes, filled with softness and longing. With love. For me. Despite everything.

You really are kind, helmet. Do you know what happens to kind souls?

They get yanked into the pool. *(SFX: Splashing of water)*

(Giggling joyfully) Hey hey, you‚Äôre fine! Relax. Told you the water wasn‚Äôt deep. You‚Äôre just fine, and soaking wet. (More giggling)

Oh, darling. Don‚Äôt look at me like that! It‚Äôs your fault for being so trusting. Your leg was within yanking distance. You let down your guard. I said I‚Äôd never force you, but I didn‚Äôt mention anything about not tricking you.

Come now, babe. You snooze, you lose! You get wet, there‚Äôs no point being up*set*! (Silly giggling)

(Smug) Well, it‚Äôs not very nice to make your girlfriend swim alone in a big pool by herself. I wanted you in the water with me, and I always get what I want.

Hey, stop! Who said you could get out of the pool?!

*(More splashing of water, and laughter)*

Nuh uh. I‚Äôll wrestle you into the depths of the pool if I must. You‚Äôre not going anywhere, mister. (Low, silky) Not going anywhere, but into my arms. (Whispering) Into me.

(Kissing in the water)

I like it when your hair gets all drenched. Reminds me of when you were walking home alone in the rain. After school. After I, uh....(almost pained) after I broke your bike.

(A longer pause)

Yes. I asked the valet to stop my car, and I offered you a ride. But you refused. I asked again, more insistently, and you only backed away. With more shyness. So I got out of the car, and asked the valet to drive home without me. I had an umbrella with me, you see. And so....that was that. I ruffled the water droplets out of your hair- *(SFX: brief hair brushing)*\- and I walked you home.

That was the first time we shared an umbrella. And that....was also the first time I held your hand.

No, helmet. I had no right to do that. I did feel like I needed to be nicer to you, but it was more than that. I....I‚Äôve always felt a certain way about you. (Murmuring faintly) I wish I‚Äôd been honest with myself. And you.

(Brightening) But enough of this! From now on, I‚Äôll not hide anything from you in the dark recesses of my heart. Lovers don‚Äôt hide things from each other.

*(SFX: Trudging water)*

Come on, helmet. Let‚Äôs go somewhere a little quieter to dry off.

Uh huh. Take my hand. Come along, babe.

Hm? Yeah, there are quite a few people in attendance tonight. Corporate sharks, celebrities, teenage kids of corporate sharks and celebrities. The affluent of upper west end love coming to this place.

(Laughing softly) Oh, there‚Äôs no reason to party. There‚Äôs a party here every night. People just do it for the sake of it.

Yeah. I won‚Äôt deny some illicit activities take place in certain quiet corners, but that‚Äôs a part of the picture too. There‚Äôs degeneracy and debauchery, but at its very core, it‚Äôs a reminder.

A reminder, that good times will always come around. You don‚Äôt need a reason to celebrate, darling.

*(Music grows fainter, and fainter)*

You know, helmet, it‚Äôs here- on this walk towards the deserted, dimly lit hallway- that I‚Äôm reminded there are six stages to a relationship.

Yes. Six. The first is innocence- an almost childish crush you have on someone, because you‚Äôre attracted to her. Love is born in the eyes- it‚Äôs the other person‚Äôs face, their style, their outward appearance that you notice at first.

The second‚Äôs longing, because you wish for her to notice you. To spend more time with her. Being on your own suddenly doesn‚Äôt feel so great anymore.

The third is trepidation- you know you have to talk to her, make a move, do *something.* But you‚Äôre anxious, worried, afraid. You don‚Äôt want your heart to get broken. And yet.....

You go to the fourth stage anyway. The plunge. You lay bare your feelings, in any number of ways. It can be as simple as asking her out for coffee, or as grand as....I don‚Äôt know, going swimming in an infinity pool at the top of a skyscraper after work (laughing softly). It can be anything, but you do it all the same. And then-

The fifth‚Äôs the fire. Her personality, her wit, her eyes, her laugh- *she* changes your world. The world takes on new colours. You start listening to sounds you didn‚Äôt even know existed. Everything is awash in excitement, glowing with joy and nervous anticipation. Part of you is worried you‚Äôll mess it up, but you‚Äôre drawn to the fire anyway. You dance with the flames, and embrace every new experience. And finally.....

The sixth, is serenity. Everything slides into place, and the fire from earlier feels like sunlight in winter. Warm, not scorching. Comforting. Blissful. And the two of you walk hand in hand, just like this.

It‚Äôs clich√©d, I know. And the thing with generalizations- they‚Äôre not universal. But I think you and I did go through the six stages.

Yes. We did. Do dry yourself off with those soft towels. The staff at this hotel are always so thoughtful.

What is this place? Hmnn....really, it‚Äôs just a silent, ornate hallway in between worlds. Between the world of never-ending revelry that we just left, and the world of silk sheets and cuddles and midnight ice-cream that we‚Äôll return home to.

It‚Äôs almost like a place out of dreams, isn‚Äôt it? The spiralling pillars, the frescoed ceiling, the shadows in the hallway interrupted only by the dim chandeliers overhead. And the moon, shining her light through that small expanse of glass. There‚Äôs no one here, but you and me. (Whispering) Just as things should be.

Will you give me your wrist, helmet?

Awww, I love how you don‚Äôt even hesitate anymore. For all you know, I could be a vampire about to sink my fangs into your vulnerable arm. (Sighing) Zero survival instincts.

Yeah okay, I‚Äôm not a vampire. I‚Äôd have whisked you away all to myself a very long time ago, had I the power to hypnotize you with supernatural charms. (Low, sultry) And I‚Äôd not have done it just for your blood, my sweet little pet.

But I- (sighing) I‚Äôm getting distracted again. What I wanted to do, was put this watch around your wrist.

Yeah. It *is* a Rolex. Do you like it?

Oh, come now. You‚Äôre my boyfriend. Who else am I supposed to spoil with the little luxuries in life?

I loved this watch when I first saw it. It was yesterday, when I was passing by a watch boutique. This one caught my eye. I kept imagining how lovely it‚Äôd look around my darling‚Äôs wrist.

Hm? Does the back of the watch have writing engraved on it?

(Coyly) Huh. What could it say, I wonder....?

(A longer pause)

Ah, so that‚Äôs what it says! ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs search together for our lost time.‚Äù

Yeah, I- I did have something like that inscribed. Um, yeah. Hope it‚Äôs not too cheesy or anything.

Helmet....? Is everything alright?

Are you sure? If there‚Äôs anything at all that‚Äôs troubling you, please, just tell me. I can- I-

....You love the watch?

(Smiling) Oh, helmet. Thank you! I‚Äôm so glad to hear that. And would you look at that?

It really does look lovely on your wrist. Will you wear it for me?

Yes?

(Kissing him)

Then I hope this watch will remind you to never again be late for our dates (giggling softly).

I hope it‚Äôll remind you of me.

Hey, helmet.

I want to dance. Let‚Äôs dance.

Yes. Right now. Put your arms around my waist. We still have faint traces of music from the poolside. And we have the silence of the shadows, the effulgence of the chandeliers. And the moon. We....we have all we need.

Do you remember when we used to dance?

*(SFX: Soft rainfall outside, and faint, lingering traces of music from earlier)*

Yeah. It was one of the most memorable nights of my life, you know? Despite how everything ended at the fall dance, I....I‚Äôd still find myself often thinking about the time we danced. Not a care in the world. Just staring into each other‚Äôs eyes. Instinctively following each other‚Äôs moves. Just us. It was....it was magical.

I was grateful for the time we got to spend together. Time....is something we never seem to have enough of.

(Smiling faintly) Yeah. Not anymore. Now, we have all the time in the world. I....I‚Äôm not going to lose you again.

I love you too. *Helmet.*

Oh? Did I say it wasn‚Äôt going to rain tonight?

Ah well, that‚Äôs a shame. But hey, at least we‚Äôre inside, right? Dancing away like it‚Äôs high school again.

(Sighing) I know, I know. You don‚Äôt have such great memories from high school. And that‚Äôs kind of my fault. I‚Äôm sorry.

Teenage me was a bitch. (Faintly) But she still cared about you.

Hey. Helmet.

What‚Äôs the most important thing in the world?

Come on. Tell me!

What? No, that‚Äôs not it. The most important thing in the world, silly, is *you*. Boop. (Silly giggling)

Well, you certainly are the most important thing in *my* world. (Whispering) You‚Äôre my treasure.

If I were a dragon, I‚Äôd never let you out of my sight. Out of worry that someone might steal you. Or touch you. Or flirt with you. (Pouting) I‚Äôd burn the rest of the world to ash and cinder, just for you.

What? (Muttering quietly) I think it‚Äôs romantic.....

(Sighing) But I‚Äôm not a dragon. Or a vampire. I‚Äôm just me. Your former bully. Now your boss, and girlfriend. And your one true love. Isn‚Äôt that right?

Awwww! Good boy.

I feel like I‚Äôm forgetting something though. Something about our bond.

Ah, yes. The six stages. (Sighing softly) I was drawn to you the first time I saw you, but it would take me a long time to realize. It did begin as something innocent, before the....(quietly) before all the teasing and name-calling.

I longed for your attention- didn‚Äôt care if it was good or bad. I just wanted to be around you. And I was full of trepidation. I was so convinced if I told you how I felt, you‚Äôd just turn me down. And you‚Äôd have every right and every reason to do that.

I took the plunge only recently, when I came clean. And then- when you agreed to be my date to my sister‚Äôs wedding, I- I was absolutely overjoyed! Jubilant, exhilarated! It was like you‚Äôd lit a fire inside my heart again.

And now....now, is bliss and serenity. The satisfaction of a perfect evening, spent in each other‚Äôs company. Now....(smiling ever so softly) we finally have our happily ever after.

I‚Äôm not going to let you go. I am *never* going to let you out of my arms. You can‚Äôt leave me. And you wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. Isn‚Äôt that right.....helmet?

*(The music fades away)*

*(Lingering silence. It keeps raining.)*

....

Helmet? It looks like the rains won‚Äôt let up anytime soon. Maybe we should both take the day off tomorrow. Stay right here, eating waffles and watching your favourite sitcoms from the 90s. What do you say?

Darling. Did you fall asleep already?

(Sighing)

*(SFX: Gentle rustling of blankets)*

Whatever am I going to do with you, hm?

Here I was, hoping we could talk until both of us drifted off into dreams, but no. You fell asleep the moment your head hit the pillow, didn‚Äôt you?

Silly boy. (Pecking him)

It‚Äôs nice, you know? Not having to sleep in an empty bed anymore. You really do warm up the sheets. (Whispering) And me.

Huh. No reaction? (Pouting) Guess you really are out cold.

My sis thinks you‚Äôre the best boyfriend I‚Äôve ever had, you know? And I think she may be onto something.

One day....I‚Äôd love for you to become part of my family. (Whispering) Hopefully, it‚Äôll be someday soon.

Helmet. Do you....do you think you‚Äôd be okay with- you know....?

(Faint, almost vulnerable) Will you marry me someday? Would that- would it be alright?

Helmet. Did you just.....snore at me?

(Sighing, pouting) How rude! You‚Äôre so mean, my love. Not even giving me the faith of an honest response.

(Muttering faintly) Jerk. Heartbreaker. Mouth breather. (Stifling a laugh)

I think it‚Äôd be nice. Getting married one day.

(Whispering) I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd want anyone else to be my husband. Not when I have you.

You.....are my everything, helmet. (Kissing his cheek)

Thank you for accepting me. I hope, in time, I can make you as happy as you make me. I will try my best, alright?

My dear pet. My darling. I‚Äôve got you. You can feel my arms around you, my hair brushing against your face. My cheek resting on yours. You know I‚Äôm here, and I always will be.

Don‚Äôt you worry, helmet. I‚Äôm never letting go of you.

It‚Äôs a promise.

......

*(A long stretch of silence. It keeps raining.)*

*(The sound of rain gradually grows louder.)*

*(SFX: Puddles in the earth)*

Helmet.

Hey. Helmet! Are you alright?

(A longer pause)

Lost in thought? Well- I appreciate you meeting me here. This won‚Äôt take very long.

You did a good job at the wedding. It was- it was really nice. And I appreciate you coming with me as my date. I had a lot of fun. It wasn‚Äôt until the very end that I realized- you didn‚Äôt want to be there.

No. Please. It‚Äôs not your fault. It‚Äôs mine, for....for *still* failing to recognise when you‚Äôre uncomfortable. I just pressured you into doing what I wanted. I thought everything would work out, and- and I could convince you of how I feel, but that- (sighing, muttering quietly) what was I even thinking?

(Whispering) This isn‚Äôt the movies.

It‚Äôs really strange, you know? The more you want something, the more you seem to scare it away. But if I didn‚Äôt even try, then- then that would be worse, right?

(A longer pause)

Hey....helmet.

I wanted to give you this. My family gave gifts to all the staff members for their service, but given our history, I wanted to personally give this to you.

Yeah. It‚Äôs a Rolex. I thought it might look nice on your wrist. Thought it might remind you that.....that you still have time.

Time, to do anything you want.

(Lingering silence)

Do you not like it?

Then- then what is it?

Please, helmet. It‚Äôs not expensive. Not to me. I want you to have it. Please, just take it.

Helmet....

(Sighing) It‚Äôs fine. It- it‚Äôs alright. I told myself I wouldn‚Äôt force you again. I should‚Äôve known you‚Äôd be uncomfortable accepting a gift like this. I will just return it to the boutique.

Yeah.

Well, if you‚Äôre not going to take this, then....can I give you something else instead?

(Kissing him)

(Whispering) For good luck.

Thanks, helmet. For being my friend when I needed you. Thank you, for always having my back. I‚Äôm sorry for not giving you the love and affection you deserved.

If I had a time machine, I‚Äôd go back in time and change things. But time machines aren‚Äôt real. Only regret is. And guilt.

Yeah. I know. You already told me, my sweet. (Smiling) You really did forgive me for everything I‚Äôve done, didn‚Äôt you?

You did forgive me....(whispering) even if you can‚Äôt accept me.

You really are kind, helmet. Do you know what happens to kind souls?

Now that‚Äôs a funny thing to say. Why would they get yanked into the pool? There are no pools around here. Well- there is one at the very top of that building over there. It‚Äôs called the-

The Six Realms, yes. But it‚Äôs closed for renovations tonight. (Sighing) What a shame.

(A longer pause)

Kind souls have a guardian angel watching over them. That is what I was going to say.

Of course you have one too. (Pouting....?) But you have to let her into your life at some point, you know?

You‚Äôll think about it?

Fair, fair. So um, what are your plans after this?

Oh? You‚Äôre not sure? But there must be something you want, right?

Huh.

No, it- it‚Äôs not stupid. Not really. Having no clue what you‚Äôre going to do is....honestly, it sounds kinda refreshing.

Well, I have my whole life planned out, you see. I know exactly what I have to do. And much of it isn‚Äôt even in my control. It‚Äôs just what my family or shareholders or consumers need me to do. And I‚Äôm not complaining, because I‚Äôm rich and all (a little laugh). I have security. Freedom, though....

Yeah. Guess I can‚Äôt have my cake and eat it too. And that sucks, because I really like cake.

(Smiling faintly) I‚Äôve always had a weakness for sweet things.

Helmet. Are you sure I can‚Äôt convince you to stay?

(Quiet, fragile) Must you walk away from me again?

(A longer pause)

Please. Don‚Äôt apologize. You‚Äôre not the villain in this story. You‚Äôre my hero. (Smiling, almost tearfully) You‚Äôve always been my hero.

I wish you the best, really. I wanted things to have turned out differently. I really did. But sometimes.....you end up hurting someone so much, that the only thing you can do to fix your mistakes, is leave them.

(Sighing, staring off into space) If I could, then I‚Äôd choose to be somebody else.

You take care of yourself now, alright? I will never stop caring for you. If you ever need something- anything- please, promise me you‚Äôll reach out to me.

Thank you, helmet. I....I‚Äôm going to miss you.

Have a good night.

*(SFX: Footsteps on damp earth, slowly walking away)*

(Faintly, to herself) There are six stages of romance. The first is innocence. The second, longing. The third is trepidation.

The fourth is the fall. Why did I have to do it? Why couldn‚Äôt I have just left him alone?

The fifth....is the ice. All the mistakes of the past, piling up. Like water pressure in the depths of a cold ocean. I can‚Äôt move, I can‚Äôt think, I can‚Äôt breathe. And....(closing her eyes, drawing a shaky breath)

The sixth, is senescence. Everything dies. Everything is gone. Only love remains, like a festering wound, eating away at your heart.

*(Footsteps stop)*

And there you go, leaving me alone again. Walking out of my life, after I finally found you so many years later.

Are you not going to pause? Are you not going to turn around, and look at me one last time? Am I never going to see your smile again, helmet?

(Whispering, ever so faintly) Don‚Äôt go. Please don‚Äôt leave me.

Don‚Äôt leave me in the rain. Please.

What am I going to do without you, helmet?

I....I can‚Äôt let go of you. I won‚Äôt let you go. ‚ÄúLoving someone, means letting them go‚Äù- that‚Äôs such bullshit. My gosh. If you really, really love someone- then you would *never* let them go.

I won‚Äôt let you go. I won‚Äôt. But then, why am I-

Why am I just standing here? You‚Äôre already so far away.

Helmet. Please, tell me. What-

(Whispering) What should I do?

1nawcyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1nawcyc/sevilla_granada_cordoba_a_bit_of_madrid/,"Sevilla, Granada, Cordoba (+ a bit of Madrid) itinerary‚Äîoffering up my working doc & asking for advice :)","Hi¬†[r/travel](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/)! I see a lot of questions asking about where to find itineraries (not just recommendation lists) and I thought I might share my working list for a quick December¬†**25-31**¬†solo trip to¬†**Sevilla, Granada, and Cordoba**, with a last 3/4 day in Madrid, where I've already been.

One of my favorite things about traveling is the thrill of gathering a bunch of spots that I want to visit, and then puzzling them into a (very rough + usually overfull) itinerary (shoutout¬†[u/GoWanderlog](https://www.reddit.com/user/GoWanderlog/)¬†for making that so much easier‚Äîlove the map integration and multi-modal travel time features). I go into a trip knowing I'll probably only make it to about half the spots I list, with hotel/transit reservations and a few tentpole ticketed sites/reservations that I won't miss (ex. the Alhambra!).

Wanted to offer up my working doc to fellow travelers in the hopes that someone might find it helpful, and inquire to see if I have any glaring omissions or things I don't really need to see/do. Feel free to PM me if you want the properly formatted Wanderlog doc or the listings for the shared lodgings I booked for Granada & Madrid :)

1naw9ic,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1naw9ic/the_thought_that_ill_never_experience_friendship/,The thought that I'll never experience friendship or intimacy again is killing me inside and outside,"After a challenging week, I'd love nothing more than to have a coffee with a close friend and chat about our week this Sunday morning. I'd love to tell this friend that I am planning a new international trip that I am excited about (and also anxious that my work won't let me take the time off). A few months ago, I went on a road trip through Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, and it was incredible. I'd love to do something similar again. And before we part ways after our coffee chat, we could share a big hug! I like hugs. 

Alas, this person exists only in my imagination. No such person exists in the real world. I am unable to form social connections with other people. 

I am autistic (diagnosed in childhood), which, almost by definition, means I struggle in social situations. There are even studies that show people with autism are almost instantly disliked. 

If that weren't enough, I also suffer from an expressive and receptive language disorder and a speech impairment. Talking is incredibly challenging for me because I struggle with a lot of syllables and sounds. Listening is also difficult because I struggle to distinguish all the sounds and understand the words (Auditory/Language Processing Disorder, baby!). Small talk is a Herculean challenge for me. I can talk and understand speech, but I need people to be incredibly patient with me, which most aren't. 

And if that weren't enough, for more than 20 years, I have struggled with self-harm. Most of my body is heavily scarred and disfigured from self-harm, so much so that I had to change gyms this year because management told me I can't show my scars because it makes other gym-goers uncomfortable. I love being body shamed at a GYM of all places. 

I'm a mid-30s, autistic, speech-disabled man with self-harm scars. I'm basically a walking red flag everywhere I go. If people aren't put off instantly by my stimming and other autistic behaviour, wait until they hear me struggle to talk! And if that's not enough to put them off, let's see how they react to me when I wear a t-shirt and show off all my hypertrophic and keloid scars. 

Unfortunately, there is too much broken and wrong about me for people to see past that. The looks I get, the comments, the ostracism, the social rejection, most people are scared of me or have no idea what to think or how to react to me. This applies equally to random strangers as it does to people who share the same hobbies and interests. The standard neurotypical advice of ""find people with similar interests"" or ""volunteer"" doesn't work. Just because someone else goes to the gym, drives a Jeep, likes to read, or volunteers, it doesn't change how people react to me. This may work for neurotypical people, but not for me. Among the worst social experiences I've ever had have been at the gym, while volunteering, attending Meetups, or with people with similar interests. 

I can't spend the rest of my life alone, without someone to talk to, hang out with, be hugged, or be intimate with. Hobbies and interests aren't enough for me. Other people may find great satisfaction and contentment in their hobbies and interests, but for me, they become dull and uninteresting when I'm always alone. No hobby or interest will replace my desire for a hug or to have someone to talk to.

...Alllrighty then, breakdown time... let's see how much of nitpicky bitch I am... (lol)

**Some Quick stuff about you(?), Answer Confidently, Yes's Only to all Questions:** 

- **Are you a natural-born female women seeking a natural-born male man?**    
-- Are you confident that your answer to the previous question will not change? 
- ***You don't have Photosensitive epilepsy?***     
-- As mentioned in the linked from TL;DR, essentially all the entertainment I enjoy uses fast, patterned lights.
- **Are you childless and want biological kids? Do you want to (eventually) be a mother?**
- **Are you between the ages of 27-42?** (Or maybe^+ 26/43) ^(+You'll need to match the rest up wild sharp though.)
- **Are you 5'7"" (1.7 meters) or taller?** (Or maybe^+ 5'6"")
- Are you capable of empathy?
- Are you a person of forgiveness?    
-- It is not who you are to; Hold grudges, prolong jealousy, or want harm upon others.
- Are you educated?     
-- Do you understand and concur with; *""The Scientific Method is the best method we have to interrogate reality.""*
- Are you, and the personality that defines you, more than just your religious or non-religious background?
- Are you your thoughts, not your ritual?
- Are you healthy? Do you take care of your self?
- Are you in your natural form, without cosmetic modifications? (no lip injections, cosmetic plastic surgery, ect. Just real you.)
- Are you *not* a Horror movie fan? (Note: I am willing to potentially mulligan this.)
- You arn't White **with** Black hair. (Note: Long Story. Not fair, but there. I am willing to potentially mulligan this.)
- Can you confidently wear a sundress or rave gear in public, or... should such be, in our first in-person date, meet confidently with no makeup, in just a white or black t-shirt and jeans? 

And that's it! You still here? Hmmm....

- You don't care about a big wedding? What matters is being with someone true, whom you can love for whatever days may come?

How about now?

Hold up... you're still here?! All (or otherwise^+ ) of the above applies to you?? Yes's to all?! Really!!? Wow, um... some of those usually really throw folks off. Hmm. Well, just to be sure, before continuing on I'll just declare it here, which I say without offense intended nor implied; I expect mutual honesty and respect. I value truth above all and am very forgiving on honesty, but I have next to zero tolerance for lies. These points are not here by random chance, there is purpose in each and I own what I ask. Shall I trust you do too?

---
*Rhetorical(?) Questions*: Why are you here? What do you seek? Are you willing to learn? Can you be honest and communicate your needs and ideas, clearly? Can you do this while being respectful of those around you? How do you balance confidence with humility? Are you confident in your self, but yet understand that there are other perspectives that you might not have been, nor able to, consider? Are you open to change? Who are you at rest? Can you listen to a person across from you without any kind of preconceptions on how things are going to turn out? When you make a choice, which is more important; authenticity or expectation? What created or altered your taste in men? What did you ""want to be"" and why? How do you make mistakes? What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow? Do you know how to just BE in a moment? What are the virtues?

**Music.**
-
 You gotta be able to [jive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwPB9FrhqjI), babe! Music is **HUGE** for me, and I am unapologetically set in my ways for this. Your taste *has* to match mine, or we're just not going to work. That means no country music, or white noise gurgling metal among others. It simply *has* to be among some of the music here, since... I mean there's a chance we may or may not *on occasion* be dancing naked* to it. Or you're to hear it in the background as I work on whatever I'm working on. Music is a tangible mood babe, and you either vibe or you don't. 
    
>*That isn't a euphemism by the way, I mean in fact, quite literally dancing naked, wild and free. Nothing like coming out of the shower shimmying around care free to music. Dancing in the dark and shaking your self around sweaty to... I don't know, a melodic set by [Armin Van Buuren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CafY1nZLKvI). This is my casual cardio, and I've always done it (forever)alone. Ain't no fear of the healthy human body with me.

Each Link is to Youtube. FYI: If you were to check every one of these end to end, it will be just a little over two hours and fifteen minutes. But hey, if you enjoy it, right? That said... I'm not expecting y'all to check everything, just enough so you know that by all odds you'll be enjoying the music I play as much as I do! :D

#Tall, Silent, and Very Mysterious

Ok, so at this point, you've passed through some hurdles which were majorly about you, from me. Now it's only right that I speak of myself. May they surpass your hopes... or at least be pleasantly surprising, anyway.

**Some Quick Stuff about Me:**

- **How tall am I?** Tall enough that it doesn't matter, I'm taller.   
-- If in the rare event this is not true... well then I'll just have to keep reaching for your *heart*. *AWWWWWWWWWWWW* lol
- I am an ""old soul"".
- I am 50/50 a Luddite. Other half is all things computer, go fig!
- I've never liked ""modern"" ties. It's a W.I.P, but... Cravat or Ascot for me. ...did I mention I'm an old soul? Heh.
- I wear a fedora hat, unironically. Have for decades now. 
- I have on fair reason to conclude that I'll possibly be one of those men who ages like fine wine. But who knows... maybe you'll be part of the reason with that. :D
- I have lived my life learning all the everything I can. This is still true.   

> Addendum: I disagree with this next point, but I've been called it enough throughout my life that I would be remiss not to at least include it, as it's a common enough perception.  

> - ""Brilliant"". Though honestly if anything I'm erudite at occasional most.

- I am, full stop, a straight-edge lifestyle. No tattoos. I don't smoke anything nor do I drink booze nor coffee, and I hardly even drink soda anymore... I'm just a pure straight edge taking on life as I can.
- I'm dirt poor, but that's ok for now, because *what you seek money can not buy*.
- I am both parts earnest, and a goofball. But the latter emerges with trust and/or ease, not on command.
- I am a life long hugger, and it's only become, well... *more*, as I got bigger and bigger. Think big embracing, wrapped, almost cradling hugs. If you want loveing arms around ya hon', I got 'chu.
- I don't gossip, I solve and I ask questions
- I HATE driving, and I *HATE* traffic more than that. This affects my lifestyle.   
-- No, Horse and buggy would not be an improvement. There is a limit to my first point. Sheesh. :) 
- I like nice things. I despise ostentatious. I love eloquence and poise. Tact, and class. I scorn prudishness, selfishness, and arrogance.    
-- In other words, I'm a real sucker for elegance when combined with genuine humility.
- I enjoy reinforcing the strengths and virtues of others as they share them, while also embracing my own humanity and imperfections. It's part of how I've built myself. 
- I'm not lost in that ""manliness"" trap.     
-- I know expressing feelings, even if tears, are not a weakness. It is just a part of being human. ...    
-- I am not afraid of my [humanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cueva_de_las_Manos).
- I value truly a real and honest connection, few as they may be.
- Fine with most pets, provided they aren't dumb as dirt, or sentient clouds that molt on everything.  
-- Currently prefer cats over dogs. 1 or 2 pets at most.
- I am picky with my entertainment. Full stop, I'm a ""Ratatouille - Anton Ego"" quality snob, A.K.A Quality over quantity. Anime, Movies, Videogames, whatever. If it's been made with love, competence, and craft... odds are I'm in. (Plus the occasional junk-food of ""but it's cool"".)

...I was going to make some examples here but... lawd this is so stupid long already...

...And as far as I'm concerned, the Starwars ""Sequels"" shall be essentially banned from our household.

So how about that? I can tell ya this much, for the right person life won't be boring. Though, then again, as I look around the world... seems we won't have a chance for such anyway. So then, if you're going to stand, might as well be with someone who can (quite likely) literately lift you higher. :) 

And reach the top shelf, because I'm a show-off like that. :P

**Overview & Looks:** 

 ***Wow***, uh... it usually really doesn't get this far... at all. Holy shit we're getting kinda real over here... hmmmm. Well! If you've gotten this far, we've discovered something remarkable; you either have exacting taste, or are as mad of a hatter as I am. Since you've made it through my musical gauntlet and apparently don't mind tall children who want to be parents, lets try the superficial stuff... you know, the warning that I'm **ugly** like a [barnacle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbpqQgiD6kk) or whatever. Out in the open... on the internet.

- Bald! (Shock.) 
- Seborrheic Dermatitis! (Like an Ogre.)
- Crooked nose courtesy of childhood injury! (It builds character!)
- Nose bridge & cheek sun damage! (Not the face again!) 
- *Mild* ""skinny fat and/or dad-bod"" ectomorph and...

...and... eh, mmm... I have a beard (on and off). So, clearly I'm horribly disfigured. Let's see... How about now? You still here? :D

Wait. You, you don't care? ...you don't care, hmmm.

Well... if you've honestly gone down this list, *which make no mistake is* ***crucial***, well then I guess... I guess I better get a little more serious now from here on out. And poetry... man do I write some poetry. If I can't weird you out with sudden poetry then... ooo gurrrl!

Forever Alone:
-

At the very least, most stateside millennials made the same mistake taught to us, where life was somehow a script. To trust that society would care, as it seemingly did for those before us. That in life there was a process of goal points and stolid common roles leading to a next step. In my interpretation of this, my mistake came in the form of time, and selflessness.

The ""time"" one is a given, mostly, and I still mentally feel I am far younger than I am, despite the maturity long held and cultivated within me that declares otherwise. This is made all the more extreme because of that script in my head, that lie long ingrained, as since I haven't ""passed"" certain arbitrary societal goal posts... ugh.

The selflessness though? Well, that's the fun one, and I'll have to greatly simplify. I have had women, some darn fine ones might I add, thinking of me. They laughed at whatever I say, couldn't stop smiling, bites her lips... you know the deal. But I didn't take the opportunity. Why? (As I can not speak for they.)

Because of that script, I held my self back. Because I didn't have money of my own, how could I dare ask for another when I only could afford myself? Because I didn't have a car nor my own home where we could have the autonomy, a place to learn who we each could be living alongside one another. Because with my passion, and oh man, in my 20's? I knew that if I had someone to be with, whom I loved and trusted and whom reciprocated back as much, odds were that at some-point the rubber would break, as it always does. And then suddenly... things are more expensive. And I wanted to be better than that. So I held my self back, because I wanted to be able to afford to love a family properly.

I just wanted to do the right, responsible thing. And now practically all my youth is gone from me.

**A Note for Those Reading This From Exotic Distances: ** 

So this post says 'Anywhere' because... well, honestly, who knows where you are? Quebec? New Zealand? Prague? Milan? Tokyo? That coffee shop in S√£o Paulo with the good wifi? Some corner Scandinavia under the northern lights? In Poland, enjoying pierogi? Where ever your screen may be your window, where ever that far or closer may be to mine known home... know that I'm tragically monolingual, fluent as I may be. While I'd love to promise I'll learn your language... I endeavor hard to keep my promises. So then, you should know that in all odds I'll just enthusiastically butcher it instead. I'll probably mispronounce your hometown and mix up your cultural holidays, not to mention some measures of culture shock. A big 'ol ""foreigner"" oaf. 

Though I confess, with that said, I must say certain personalities make those mispronunciations worth it. Nordic stoicism? Western Slavic... um, hopefulness? Brazilian warmth when mixed with Japanese precision? That particular Scottish growl? Though, for that last one, if this happens, our kids will likely be allergic to, I don't know... THE SUN! But, from wherever you may be from, while my brain might short-circuit, I'll enthusiastically try my darnedest to still form complete sentences.

Because, underneath the tapestry of the land and lives around us... we're just... human. You know?

**My Hopes for you:** You are someone who brings with you a full and edifying wealth of intellect worth living a lifetime alongside, and an eloquent heart which melts those scholarly edges. That when life inevitably tests us... because it will, of that have no doubt... that we face it as teammates finding solutions, not adversaries attacking problems. That we can master our communication, both in word, and a look. That beneath all these carefully considered compatibilities, there exists too that ineffable pull which makes conversation trail off mid-sentence, and makes ordinary moments electric. A smile. A kiss. Maybe... just a few more. Oh.

 That your family is sane... for a family. That your father is not afraid to cry, or your mother is not afraid to be support as needed (and vice versa). That your siblings (should there be), while... well, siblings, are an ally to you. That among it all... you have known love, unconditional, and that you are your own person. You know when to lead or follow when needed, as needed. That you are not afraid of yourself, and, in time... not afraid of me.

The hope is, someday... I can find someone for whom in the right ways I am not. Who just understands without need of anything more. My very best friend, my teammate, my mentor, my lover... and someone for whom I admire. My hope for you is all this made the same. And among it all you understand; you are not MINE, and I am not YOURS, we just ARE, because it always should have been.

Is that you? ^(Do you understand?)

***Of text below, my last chance to have you reconsider. That a cerebral fool like me is not worth your time.***    
So look... this is terrible. THIS. Being here. A little over 4000 words have you passed through, all just to know of me and the ""if"" upon the worth of your time. Yet... all of this is but a raindrop to the ocean of me, and I've promulgated myself trying to pour even this much out. Here I am, exposing hopes I've collected among age, foolish enough that I think I know exactly what I want... but I don't know. I can only hope. All untested theories from someone who despises - DESPISES - having to advertise his very self like this. This abomination imposed by modernity systematic and politic. 

The idea that when asked ""how did you two meet"" and the answer being reddit honestly curdles my blood. This...*ugh*, it should be organic! But my sanguine youth gave that up! We should be meeting through shared joy, not this! This just creates an artificial ""dating"" pressure, like some performance in a circus... and not even the cool vaudeville kind! This creates a frame! An impossible perfectionism! ALL THESE FUCKING WORDS FOR WHAT! AND I'M!... expecting a human for this?! But here I am, ^(doing the stupid thing, ^because)...

Do you understand? If this seems simple nonsense, then even after all this, I am not who you seek.

 **If you feel seen among all this...or know someone who likely shall, and among it all do match where it statedly matters, here's how to reach out:**
Provided your account is older than 30 days, start your message with: ""I came across your post on r/ForeverAloneDating, and I think I match [your word or phrase for how much]..."" Then tell me about yourself. Not questions, but who you are and why you think we might work. Everything you need to know is either in these words or between them. If you think I haven't answered something, check again... answers come in many forms.

Fair warning: I'll be responding slowly, and especially if there are many of you. It's going to take time to figure out the best way to commit to all this, as this is outside my comfort zone. Therefor, as things start out expect weekends only, and even then I might skip among every other. Cause... Silent, remember? And in fact, the only way I can see us to be speaking every day is if we're in person. But then again... life can be quite unexpected. I might even, oh... enjoy it?! Eh. And if, perchance, your message shows you didn't actually read this... I'll find myself unable to respond. This isn't rudeness, but a respect in turn... after all I've freely given just over 4000 words to work off of, with plenty more if you know where to look; show me you've understood them. Show me you understand them all.

I implore you: Do not use ""AI""! I am here to meet YOU. Lead with what you have to bring, or else you shall waste us both among time.

For any of those whom took their time among curiosity to read this, despite having metrics which are too young, too old, too short, or too into the idea of stability in your life to have kids... I wish you all well in your search. May you find the happiness you need.

Among the rest whom have a pending speech for me, I must too ask you to forgive me if I in my start come off blunt or singular, depending on the day. Because honestly, all this is exhausting and I just...this isn't my natural mode. It had to be done, we must do as we must. Please understand. Silent by nature, forced to shout into the void. ...

2. Are the filters a proprietary size or is it a size I can get anywhere?
3. It doesn't appear so (it appears as if it's made to make cups at a time) but I assume only cup sized things fit under there. But by chance would a chemex carafe fit under there?
4. How does it work with coffee not purchased through them? With all the settings it seems geared towards always having various specific blends purchased from them. We wouldn't be doing this. We would be using this with coffee we buy locally.

1naw2wq,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1naw2wq/sp_pale_imitations/,[SP] Pale Imitations,"Two hours before dawn, I stopped dead in my tracks and locked eyes with myself. He looked back at me from his plastic seat under the bus shelter, smiled, and hauled himself to his feet.

‚ÄúMorning.‚Äù

We were alone on a quiet street near the centre of the city, the roads mostly empty apart from the occasional taxi and motorbike delivery. I‚Äôd been awake for twenty hours at this point, drinking for the last nine of them, and my head had already been spinning *before* coming face to face with an apparent doppelganger.

Except, he wasn‚Äôt a doppelganger. I wasn‚Äôt quite sure how I knew it was me, his face was similar, his stature as well, but he must have been twenty years older. After my initial certainty, I had a sudden flash of doubt, worried I was now just staring at a random man waiting for a bus, but the way he was looking at me told me that wasn‚Äôt the case. He had been waiting for me, he was expecting me, he knew me. There was something about him, something I couldn‚Äôt put into words, a familiarity I had never felt before when I locked eyes with someone. Maybe I was losing my mind, maybe I was just very, very drunk, but he was me, an older me, I was sure of it.

‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù I said back hesitantly, wondering if I was just far more inebriated than I‚Äôd first realised. Maybe something I‚Äôd drunk had been spiked with a little something extra, maybe I was vividly hallucinating. Maybe I was currently passed out on the tiles of a bathroom floor, having some kind of fever-dream.

‚ÄúNice night, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù he looked up into the clear, pallid sky of early April. He was dressed better for the temperature than I was, in a thick jacket that he had buried his hands in the pockets of, boots. It was a very nice jacket, similar to a few of mine, the kind of thing I could imagine myself wearing. ‚ÄúTonight was Owen‚Äôs birthday party, right? The 22nd?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs right.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. Good, I got it right.‚Äù

He stepped out from under the bus shelter and started a few steps down the street. He then paused and waited for me to follow. ‚ÄúCome on, let‚Äôs walk. It‚Äôll sober you up.‚Äù

I was beginning to feel distinctly sick, though again, the cause of that was uncertain.

‚ÄúWhy are you-‚Äù

‚ÄúLook, I shouldn‚Äôt be doing this,‚Äù he turned his body back to face me and made a sort of awkward, impatient bob with a bend of his knees. ‚ÄúAnd this only works if you take this secret to your grave, understand?‚Äù

I nodded shakily.

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù he said again. ‚ÄúWalk with me. We‚Äôve got a lot of ground to cover.‚Äù

We walked with purpose, like we were headed somewhere in particular rather than just out for a stroll. I found myself transfixed by him, his gait, his mannerisms, the way he spoke, realising this must be how I presented from the outside. The way I glanced left, right, then left again at every road, the way I winged by elbows pack when I put my hands in my pockets, the way my hair looked from the back. I compared the way I moved to the way he did and found them disconcertingly identical. I kept falling into the same step as him, and had to purposely throw my rhythm.

‚ÄúNow, I know what you‚Äôre thinking,‚Äù the city was quiet enough that we didn‚Äôt have to wait for green lights to cross the roads, just a quick glance left and right and left again, pausing for the occasional taxi or delivery bike. ‚Äúand I‚Äôm very, very, sorry to disappoint you but you‚Ä¶we‚Ä¶do not invent time travel. What is discovered though - again, not by us, unfortunately - is *interdimensional* travel. The whole multiverse theory, every action undertaken by free will causing another branch of reality, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on, and a very small handful of people are allowed the privilege of travelling between branches.‚Äù

A woman jogged past us, clad in lycra, and he paused until she was gone. ‚ÄúNow, I‚Äôm not supposed to be here, I‚Äôm supposed to be a couple millions Variations away taking data readings,‚Äù

I spent a moment thinking about how I could confirm the man I was sitting across from was really a version of myself. I had a small scar on my wrist from a few years ago where I‚Äôd caught myself with a saw.

‚ÄúBut I just couldn‚Äôt help myself,‚Äù the man pulled back his sleeve, unbuckled his watch, and held out his wrist to show me the scar before I‚Äôd even asked.

He clearly knew the city well. He pointed out a few spots to me, a few of them I already knew well, some that were some of my favourite places, but there were a few that I wasn‚Äôt familiar with.

‚ÄúNext year, that place will do excellent ice cream,‚Äù he told me, pointing a thumb at a small shop that had been shut for several weeks, a ‚Äúfor lease‚Äù sign in the window.

‚ÄúAnd that,‚Äù he said two streets over, ‚Äúis an excellent restaurant for a date.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry, is this‚Ä¶ this isn‚Äôt why you‚Äôre here, is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get to that,‚Äù he assured me. ‚ÄúUntil then, isn‚Äôt it just interesting for us to meet one another?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow old are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúForty five.‚Äù

I did a little mental maths, which took me embarrassingly long, my bloodstream still heavy with pollutants. ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs‚Ä¶2049 like?‚Äù

He shot me a look that I didn‚Äôt like, a slightly disdainful one, like he was a little disappointed in me. ‚ÄúCome on, I can‚Äôt tell you anything like that. For your own good, really, you don‚Äôt want anybody realising I met with you. This whole thing is pretty carefully regulated, you‚Äôll find yourself snatched up in the night.‚Äù

We walked a little more. If he couldn‚Äôt tell me anything, I wondered why he was here.

‚ÄúSo remind me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs life like for you about now?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶tell me about your week. The last couple of weeks.‚Äù

I took a moment to collect my thoughts, then talked him through the last two months or so; my exams, my outings with Owen and my other friends, a trip up to London we had made in the Easter break. He listened with interest, his face shifting back and forth between an odd expression of fondness and another look, at particular moments, when I mentioned particular things or people, that it took me a moment to place.

Eventually, I realised what it was and thought to address it.

‚ÄúWhy do you keep looking at me like that?‚Äù

‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù

‚ÄúWith‚Ä¶sympathy.‚Äù

He let out a tiny laugh, a small exhalation through his nose. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, don‚Äôt let it worry you. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶you‚Äôre doing this blind. I feel bad, that you don‚Äôt have my hindsight. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd find this all a lot easier if you did.‚Äù

He pointed out another shop - a book shop. ‚ÄúThat place closes this summer, I really regret not going more often. Come on, tell me more. No detail too small.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you going to tell me why you‚Äôre here? Are you just using me to go down memory lane?‚Äù

He paused, sighed, checked his surroundings. ‚ÄúChrist, we were a little entitled at this age, weren‚Äôt we? Do you know how many people would kill just to talk to a version of themselves?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt have a retort to this. It was a fair criticism.

I watched myself pause, rub his face, let out a heavy sigh.

‚ÄúSorry. Sorry, I‚Äôm just a little on edge. What I‚Äôm doing here, what I‚Äôve been doing, it‚Äôs enough to get me disencorporated.‚Äù

He paused again, not looking at me, resuming his walk through the city.

‚ÄúI had a wife. I lost her. I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know, I guess the last few weeks I‚Äôve been feeling nostalgic.‚Äù

I hesitated, trying to figure out the right thing to say.

‚ÄúWhat was she like?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, she was amazing,‚Äù his voice had taken on a tautness to it, a tension. His eyes seemed fixed, now, in the middle distance. ‚ÄúConfident, loud, stubborn as anything. She dragged me to a whole bunch of things I really didn‚Äôt want to do and then was really glad I‚Äôd done. She supported me for years, she‚Äôs the only reason I made it as far as I did through my career. She was the cornerstone of my whole life.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow did you meet her?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tell you that. Come on, what‚Äôs wrong with a little delayed gratification?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo this \*is\* just a nostalgia trip? You‚Äôre not here to tell me anything, give me anything?‚Äù  
  
He chuckled a little. ‚ÄúI forgot how greedy we were at your age. Trust me, with the benefit of hindsight, you won‚Äôt feel short-changed from this experience.‚Äù  
  
There was another pause where he stammered for the right words. I suddenly saw myself clearer than ever, struggling to articulate myself, worried I wasn‚Äôt coming across as I wanted to. It was interesting that I hadn‚Äôt grown out of that.  
  
We came to another bus stop, along a line that saw buses infrequently and was only really used if you lived in a particular housing estate.  
  
The man stopped walking at this stop. He sat down on a cheap plastic chair and I sat down next to him.  
  
‚ÄúHow are you feeling? Sobered up a little?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYeah, a little.‚Äù  
  
He dug in his coat pocket and produced a small bottle of water. He handed it to me, and I polished the thing off entirely.  
  
The headlights of a bus came around the corner up the road, lumbering along in the early hours of the morning. The man nodded toward it.

‚ÄúThis is your bus,‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt ready for this to be over. There were so many questions I wanted to try and persuade him to tell me the answers to. I shook my head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just get the next one.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, trust me, this is your bus. Sit near the front.‚Äù

He stepped to the curb and flagged it down for me. Despite not wanting to get on it, I found myself standing up in mimicry.¬†

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt bring her back. Not mine. But, through variations like you, I can‚Ä¶I can imitate what she and I had. A homage, of sorts.‚Äù

The bus pulled up and stopped, the doors opened, and my doppelganger placed a firm hand between my shoulderblades and pushed me to the doorway.

‚ÄúSit near the front,"" he repeated.

I got on, paid, and took a seat as instructed. I looked at my Doppel through the glass as the vehicle pulled away. He raised two fingers to his temple and flicked a small, jovial salute my way, taking off back the way we‚Äôd come. The bus was quiet, only half a dozen people on it. My head was spinning. I was starting to sober up, a thick brain-fog clogging my skull, slowing down every thought as I tried to keep myself in my sights, craning my head and turning in my seat to look down the bus as we pulled away.

‚ÄúRhys?‚Äù

It took me a second to realise I was being addressed. In turning to look behind me, I had turned to face a girl two rows back from me, my age, with copper-brown hair tied up at the back of her head and a hoodie over a button-down shirt. She was looking right at me, and when I made eye contact she grinned and shot me a small wave. She got out of her seat and came up the bus to sit next to me.

‚ÄúOh my God, Rhys, it‚Äôs so good to see you! What are the chances?‚Äù

I was still trying to keep the version of myself in my sight, but the bus had moved too far and he‚Äôd set off walking in the other direction. I conceded and turned to give Olivia my attention, struggling to straighten out my train of thought from the insanity of what had just happened.

I hadn‚Äôt seen Olivia since leaving secondary school. We‚Äôd sat next to each other for a year when we were both fifteen, going sixteen, in the back corner of Mrs Baker‚Äôs maths classes. We‚Äôd lost touch when we‚Äôd gone to different colleges for our A-Levels. I‚Äôd always thought it a tremendous shame, we‚Äôd gotten on incredibly well.

‚ÄúOlivia, hi,‚Äù I tried to shake images of myself out of my head and engage with her like I hadn‚Äôt just seen a ghost. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôve you been?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been good! What are you doing out this early?‚Äù

I had to take a second to remember where I‚Äôd been only a few hours ago. It felt like days had passed. ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm just heading home from a party. You?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm on placement at the hospital. I‚Äôm doing nursing. Now that I‚Äôm in second year, they‚Äôve got me there three days a week, starting at the crack of dawn.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds rough.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs not the nicest. Much easier now that the weather is improving, though.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even realise we were at the same university.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I know! We should catch up, get a coffee or something.‚Äù

It was one of my significant regrets of my time at school, that I had failed to keep in touch with ‚Äòliv. We‚Äôd gotten on incredibly well, and sometimes, on nights I was feeling particularly sorry for myself, I had wondered how things might have gone differently.

The penny finally dropped inside my skull with deafening clarity. I should have realised sooner, but I was approaching twenty-two hours without sleep, and I was still a little drunk.¬†

1navzfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1navzfk/are_sumex_charcoal_water_filters_the_best_choice/,Are SUMEX charcoal water filters the best choice for coffee makers review?,"Testing out the SUMEX B085VS1R12 charcoal water filters for my Cuisinart coffee maker turned into a bit of an adventure. As someone who firmly believes that coffee is life, finding the right filter to ensure a consistently great cup was essential. I decided to give this 12-pack of charcoal filters a go, and after a few weeks, I‚Äôm happy to share the ups and downs I experienced. If you're like me and demand quality coffee every morning, you'll want to hear this.

**Design that Blends Functionality with Simplicity**  
The design of these charcoal filters was surprisingly effective. Each filter is compact, measuring just 6.06""D x 1.06""W x 4.57""H and weighing a lightweight 2.88 ounces. I appreciated how their slim profile made them easy to insert into my Cuisinart machine without any fuss. The micromesh material really caught my eye. It ensures the charcoal stays tightly packed inside the filter, which is a relief because clogging is the bane of many filters. Over the last month, I‚Äôve never had issues with loose charcoal messing with my coffee maker.

**Effectiveness You Can Taste**  
The coffee quality undeniably improved the moment I started using these filters. With ultra fine-grain charcoal designed for maximum water filtration, impurities like calcium and chlorine were effectively reduced. I could taste the difference ‚Äì my espresso had a cleaner, richer flavor that wasn't overpowered by odd taste notes from unfiltered tap water. Filtering out odors and other impurities really made my morning cup feel like a coffee shop experience at home.

**Compatibility That Covers All Bases**  
One of the standout features is that these filters work with all Cuisinart coffee makers, whether you‚Äôre using an older model that‚Äôs been a kitchen workhorse or one of the fancy new ones with all the bells and whistles. I have an older Cuisinart that‚Äôs seen better days, but these filters slid right in like they were bespoke. My coworker has a newer model and noted the same hassle-free fit.

**Advantages**  
- Ultra fine-grain charcoal offers highly efficient filtration.  
- Fits a wide array of Cuisinart coffee makers seamlessly.  
- Improves coffee flavor by removing impurities, chlorine, and odors.  

**Environmental and Packaging Insights**  
I can‚Äôt ignore how eco-conscious the product felt. The packaging was minimal but sturdy, which I appreciated because over-packaged products just add unnecessary waste. Each filter was individually sealed, so I didn‚Äôt have to worry about them losing effectiveness over time.  

**Areas of Concern**  
Let‚Äôs be real: not everything is perfect.  
- Filters don‚Äôt come with clear instructions or diagrams, which might confuse first-timers.  
- If you‚Äôre using extremely hard water, one filter may not last as long as it should.  
- Sometimes the fit isn‚Äôt as snug for non-Cuisinart machines (a friend‚Äôs experience).  

**Using Alternative Offerings**  
While I enjoyed my time with this product, I have to say there‚Äôs stiff competition. Products from major brands like Keurig also offer replacement charcoal filters, but their packs are typically smaller and pricier. Companies like GoldTone provide a similar filtration level, but the charcoal granule size is slightly coarser, which doesn‚Äôt filter with as much finesse. Compared to Keurig‚Äôs filters, SUMEX stood out for the value it provides in a single pack and its extended lifespan per filter. That said, if you‚Äôve got non-Cuisinart devices, other alternatives might offer a better fit.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
For what you get in this 12-pack, the value is undeniable. Most other filter brands offer six-packs or smaller and don‚Äôt feature the micromesh design that prevents clogging. It‚Äôs not the cheapest option out there, but when you taste the difference day in and day out, the investment feels justified. Over time, these filters save you from spending more on fixing a coffee maker plagued by poor water quality.

1navyxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CleanSweepers/comments/1navyxz/explore_if_clorox_ecoclean_allpurpose_cleaner/,Explore if Clorox EcoClean All-Purpose Cleaner Truly Delivers,"Testing out the Clorox CloroxPro EcoClean All-Purpose Cleaner Spray Bottle has genuinely been an interesting experience over the past few weeks. From the moment I pulled this 32-fluid-ounce bottle out of the cabinet and started wiping down everything from my kitchen counters to bathroom sinks, I noticed both the product‚Äôs strengths and areas that could improve. This multi-surface cleaner wasn‚Äôt just another household item; it proved to be a mainstay for anyone‚Äîespecially someone like me who‚Äôs juggling a busy household and a mess-prone workspace.

**Design and Usability**

The spray bottle design is sleek and functional, making it straightforward to use. I find sprayers like these are hit or miss‚Äîsometimes you end up squeezing forever with little payoff, but this one offered a steady, even mist. The clear labeling ensures no mix-ups with other sprays stashed in the cabinet, which I‚Äôll admit has occasionally happened in my life. I also appreciated the sturdy build of the bottle, which feels durable enough to survive being accidentally knocked off counters (as happened when my dog tail-swept it onto the floor).

**Eco-Friendly Nature**

One of the things that initially drew me to this product was its sustainable edge. Being formulated with 99% biobased ingredients, it aligns with my growing effort to switch to more environmentally conscious household supplies. Knowing that this cleaner meets both the US EPA Safer Choice Product standards and is USDA Certified Biobased offers real peace of mind. It‚Äôs reassuring to feel like I‚Äôm doing a small bit for the planet while scrubbing down greasy stove tops.

**Performance on Various Surfaces**

I tested this cleaner on almost every safe surface I could think of, and its versatility didn‚Äôt disappoint. Its compatibility with counters, appliances, stainless steel, and even sealed granite placed it on par with some of the more expensive cleaners I‚Äôve used in the past. Bathroom cleaning‚Äîtypically a less enjoyable task for me‚Äîbecame easier, with soap scum vanishing quickly and chrome fixtures sparkling to their original shine. While this is promoted as safe for food-contact surfaces, I double-checked by wiping counter areas with a damp cloth post-cleaning, more out of habit than necessity.

**Highlights**

- Made with 99% biobased and safer-for-the-environment ingredients.
- Successfully eliminates grease, soap scum, and grime without leftovers.
- Free from harsh chemicals like parabens, phthalates, and petroleum solvents.
- Suitable for a broad range of household surfaces, making it a one-stop solution.

**Drawbacks**

- The absence of bleach, although great for safety, can leave tougher stains (think food coloring or coffee spills) needing extra scrubbing power.
- While largely odor-neutral, I did notice a faint chemical trace after heavy usage, which might bother sensitive noses.
- It‚Äôs effective but might not replace traditional, heavy-duty cleaning sprays for commercial or high-impact messes.

**Competing Products**

Compared to other all-purpose sprays I‚Äôve tried, such as Method All-Purpose Cleaner and Mrs. Meyer‚Äôs Clean Day, the Clorox version holds its own because of its eco-friendly emphasis. However, where Method wins points is its range of natural fragrances that leave the room smelling super fresh, while Mrs. Meyer‚Äôs seems to handle grease slightly faster. Both of these competitors, though, fall short in terms of versatility when applied to surfaces like sealed granite and stainless steel. Clorox EcoClean efficiently bridges that gap and comes across as a more balanced alternative for everyday cleaning.

**Cost Efficiency**

This product fares well in the affordability department, given its multifaceted nature. Buying individual cleaners for bathroom, kitchen, and stainless steel appliances would cost a lot more in the long run. Its environmentally conscious formula adds extra value, making it worth considering over less eco-friendly mainstream sprays. The price-quality ratio works out in its favor, especially for those trying to consolidate their cleaning arsenal into a single bottle.

Perhaps you can explain to me what is happening with my body so that I can get some tests done and get an official diagnosis. English is not my first language, so I apologize for any mistakes. I am a 20-year-old woman, 164 cm tall, weighing about 70 kg. I'll describe how my day goes:

I wake up at around 8 a.m. and immediately go to eat. I wouldn't say I really want to do it: it's just a habit, because without breakfast I can't go to the toilet. I eat: I usually try to eat fatty foods because I suspect I have insulin resistance. I rarely eat gluten and sugar, and only in minimal amounts. Nevertheless, breakfast ends up being high in calories. I always drink coffee with cream. After that, the first difficulties begin: I usually can't have a bowel movement for a very long time, even though I feel discomfort in my intestines and stomach. In the end, I manage to go, but (sorry for the details) the stool is hard and there's not much of it.

Despite the discomfort, I go for a walk with the dog, usually covering 5-6 thousand steps. I come back and eat again. Because I don't feel any energy and I think I'm hungry, both physically and emotionally. This usually happens at 12 p.m. Here I eat more carbohydrate-rich food. The calorie count is again high. My brain thinks that if I eat this, I'll become energetic, but... I don't feel any energy. But I don't feel sleepy either. I just don't want to do anything. The easiest way out is to sit and scroll through Reels.

I wanted to try intermittent fasting, but I usually eat one more time in the evening, after 6 p.m. And only in the evening am I able to do anything; only in the evening do I get some energy. So, if you notice, I only start living after 6-7 p.m.

I always wake up at 3 a.m. This started after one month on keto; I stopped it because I would wake up every night in a sweat from nightmares, my heart pounding like crazy. I still haven't been able to fix this.

This is how every day goes for me. I think it's all because of my diet. All my meals are chaotic and very high in calories. On particularly bad days, I have to sleep for one hour during the day and drink a second cup of coffee just to function. This is all very hard for me.

Other pages I cannot remember as clearly, but when I think about the book, for some reason I think of electrical plugs (UK type), colourful buttons, jelly beans, and toy cars. I seem to recall one page had a load of jelly beans (or buttons?) with toy cars and other items embedded in it.

Kansen voor Nederlandse IT-organisaties

De integratie van AI en CPaaS biedt Nederlandse IT-organisaties en MSP‚Äôs aanzienlijke kansen. Door slimme communicatieoplossingen te implementeren, kunnen bedrijven hun klantenservice optimaliseren, processen automatiseren en de operationele effici√´ntie verbeteren.

De toenemende vraag naar gepersonaliseerde communicatie en selfservice-opties cre√´ert een groeimarkt voor MSP‚Äôs die deze technologie√´n kunnen integreren en beheren.

Toekomst van CPaaS en AI integratie

De convergentie van AI en CPaaS zal de komende jaren alleen maar intensiveren.  MSP‚Äôs die proactief investeren in kennis en expertise op dit gebied,  zullen een sterke positie verwerven in de markt.  Het vermogen om  innovatieve, AI-gedreven communicatieoplossingen te ontwikkelen en te implementeren,  zal bepalen wie de  winnaars  zijn in dit snel evoluerende landschap. De focus moet liggen op het cre√´ren van toegevoegde waarde voor klanten door middel van slimme,  effici√´nte en gepersonaliseerde communicatie.

Hey everyone,

For once in my life I‚Äôm actually ahead of schedule. Usually I‚Äôm still frantically sticking labels on jars at the last second, but right now I get to share the menu before I even have the photos or videos done. That feels kind of surreal.

This will likely be my only September restock, and it is called **Please Buy My Bread.**¬†I think it might be one of my most impressive collections so far. Not the most meaningful (I literally just overbought an absurd amount of artisan bread fragrance oil and had to do something with it), but definitely one of the most fun. The scents and textures are on point on this one, and I‚Äôm honestly so excited to finally talk about it.

The heart of the collection is **Bread** itself‚Äîa fluffy slime that smells exactly like warm bread. It‚Äôs comforting and cozy, really similar in feel to **Regulation Blanket 451** if you tried that one before. Bread will be available in a 6oz, a 2oz, or a pack of three 2oz minis.

But then I thought, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs bread without spreads?‚Äù and that spiraled into eight accompaniments‚Äîjellies, butters, teas, coffees‚Äîall designed to mix and match with Bread. They‚Äôre available in 1oz and 2oz sizes (and you *can* buy them on their own, but they cost a bit more that way). I also made a single 6oz jar of each accompaniment (except **Apple Compote**, for various reasons), for the people who just really want a full-size of one of them. Those will be first come, first serve. I‚Äôd appreciate it if people stick to one 6oz accompaniment per order so more folks get a chance, but I‚Äôm probably not going to enforce it.

Personal favorites? For scents, definitely **Sweet Pecan Butter, Local Jelly, and Citrus Marmalade.** For textures, **Sweet Pecan Butter, Strawberry Basil Cream, and Bread.** This collection also has my very first jelly slimes (**Mixed Berry Jam** and **Local Jelly**) and they turned out way better than I expected. And I finally got to use a charm I‚Äôve been sitting on forever, waiting for the right project. It fits perfectly here. (Also‚Ä¶ making this collection made me *so* hungry the entire time.)

One difference this time: there isn‚Äôt a dedicated Mystery Slime for this collection like usual. But every order still comes with a bonus slime‚Äîthat part hasn‚Äôt changed.

In addition, I am adding new¬†Secret Slimes. I‚Äôm ridiculously proud of these. They‚Äôll be up for purchase, and they‚Äôll also slip into Dark Memory Bags. Every bag will have at least one, but some people will end up with two, maybe all three. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll say much more, but maybe I‚Äôll cave and show a preview Friday morning.¬†¬†

For those who are confused by my wording, you're absolutely right.¬† Things started one way and ended up another, so as it stands, here is what I mean by the following: **Secret Slime** is a slime you can purchase with unknown details;¬†**Mystery Slime**¬†is the extra slime that I typically make with every collection that is not available for purchase, but given out with orders as supplies last;¬†**Bonus Slime**¬†refers to the extra, unordered slime that I include with every order‚Äîusually, this is the Mystery Slime, but if there isn't one for the collection or I've run out, you will still get a free slime; **Random Slime** just means no rules, give me a slime‚Äîtypically this is just a checkbox to add a mini slime for a nominal cost.

And I just want to say thanks to everyone who grabbed something from the *All My Emo Friends* collection last week. That drop meant a lot to me, and it‚Äôs been amazing seeing all the new Emo BFFs show up. I‚Äôm really proud of this next one, and I can‚Äôt wait to start sharing the preview videos over the week.

Restock is **Friday, Sept 12 at 5PM CST.**  
IG: **emoslimeco**, TikTok: **emo.slimes3** if you want to see everything as I post it. I probably won‚Äôt be back here with final photos on Sunday (self-promo rules and all that), but maybe I‚Äôll sneak them in.

1navqbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1navqbj/justnomil_mean_to_kids/,JustNoMIL Mean to Kids,"I‚Äôm NC with my MIL and FIL (see prior post for context). My husband still texts and calls them, and he and our kids still see them twice a year, even though it always makes my husband really stressed out to be around them.

MIL made wildly inappropriate comments about my SIL to my husband, but I feel that is my SIL‚Äôs story to tell, and too private for me to share here. It reinforced my desire (and my SIL‚Äôs) to remain NC.

During the most recent visit, MIL and FIL were both cruel to our 13yo son, H: they kept losing things (her fan, his phone, his hat), and then accused our son of stealing and hiding them, which he absolutely did not.

Now, our 13yo is absentminded, but never malicious. Early on in the trip, H had been playing with his 11yo brother M‚Äôs fidget toy, stuck it in his pocket, and forgot he did it. M went looking for the toy, and eventually found it in H‚Äôs laundry bag. H apologized, and that should have been the end of it. H and M get along great.

Then, FIL lost his phone and couldn‚Äôt find it anywhere. He went around blustering about it. 13yo H saw the phone right on the coffee table, picked it up, and laughingly said, ‚ÄúUh, is this it?‚Äù (H was laughing bc the phone was right in plain sight.) FIL then got angry at H for stealing the phone, despite H‚Äôs protests, and even after my husband told him to cut it out. They refused to believe H that he had not done it.

Later, when MIL misplaced her fan, and FIL misplaced his hat, they were both absolutely convinced that 13yo H had stolen the items and was hiding them from them, and got angry at him again. 13yo H and 15yo T laughed a couple times during the accusations, since the situation was so absurd. There are only so many times H could explain that it wasn‚Äôt him.

They just would not drop it, for days, to the point that my husband yelled at them to cut it out and left the dinner table to cool off.

When the kids came back home, 13yo H told me, ‚ÄúThat was the first time an adult has not believed me, and thought I did something bad when I didn‚Äôt.‚Äù I could tell he felt really bad that his grandparents didn‚Äôt trust him and had repeatedly gotten angry at him for things he didn‚Äôt do.

About a week after the trip, MIL sent 13yo H a text, saying she ‚Äúknew‚Äù he had taken and hidden their things, and that it would mean a lot to her if he would text FIL and apologize.

We discussed with H potential responses (‚ÄúI can‚Äôt apologize for something I didn‚Äôt do,‚Äù ‚ÄúIt hurts my feelings that you don‚Äôt trust me,‚Äù or just silence). H ended up deciding to just not respond to the text. Poor kid.

We talked to H about it, trying to make him feel better. We reassured him that they do really love him, and they are getting older and clearly a bit paranoid and are not as logical as they used to be.

‚Ä¶The truth is, though, my husband told me privately that they seem just as mentally with it as ever. I guess they are just illogical and paranoid people.

So sad that they made their own grandson feel this way. At least he is old enough, and has enough close and extended family members who treat him well, that it colors his relationship with them but doesn‚Äôt touch his sense of self.

Now they have invited themselves for Thanksgiving. I am going to check into a hotel for Thursday and Friday nights, and then we will have our family Thanksgiving meal on Saturday without them there. (They always stay at a hotel when they visit, we don‚Äôt have space for guests.) Husband warned them that they could not see him or the kids that night, so they are prepared for that. Hopefully they either apologize to H, or at least have the good sense not to bring it up again.

Edit: This is only the 4th time in 17 years that their bad behavior has involved one of the kids. 1st: FIL wouldn‚Äôt stop speeding and taking wrong lane in mountain drive when I was 7 months pregnant, although husband and I both asked and told him to stop. That is the last time he has driven with any of us in the car. 2nd: MIL and FIL kept holding our first baby‚Äôs face in direct sunlight for pictures, even after I asked them to stop, causing the baby to get his first sunburn. We are not such pushovers now, and wouldn‚Äôt let anything like that happen again. 3rd: MIL gave our son the silent treatment when he asked her to go look at the stars with him, bc she was mad at the adults. This was the 4th. Their bad behavior does not usually target the kids, in other words - and we have taken steps to ensure the kids‚Äô safety.",36,1757257918.0,JUSTNOMIL,27,0.98,False

1navl26,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1navl26/food_chain_magnate_ketchup_expansion_trainer/,Food Chain Magnate Ketchup Expansion Trainer Opening,"I've played FCM a whole bunch, and got the expansion about a year and a half ago, and just wanted to share some thoughts on opening with Trainer, and get some ideas from other people. Generally *love* the expansion, loads of new avenues for making money and alternative directions to discount wars, but of the three openings nobody has been able to be competitive with a Trainer opening. I tried last game, and had a lot of fun and did better than other trainer games we've played, but still ended on 250 compared to the 500 or so the winner had.

When looking at opening milestones there doesn't seem to be any comparison. Marketeer gets the -2 distance, $5 for everything marketed, free kitchen trainee & errand boy and the lemonade milestone of training on the job. This sets them up immediately for all other food selling milestones, and the ability to grow their company with reliable on the job training and assured money from marketing and selling food.

Recruiting Girl gets the immediate massive company, can easily go into waitresses and coffee (and luxury manager) to secure money for training, or follow marketeer to pick up the other food milestones (being careful of marketeers lemonade training and reduced distance). They can get night shift manager before anyone else.

Trainer gets an extra trainer and doesn't fire people when broke. The second seems very strong, but the other two openings simply won't go broke. Marketeers will be getting marketing money from round two, and reliable sales from 3 onwards. Recruiters will have waitresses for costs or coffee shops setup from round two as well as the night manager. The first Trainer bonus is just an extra hire that actually restricts your next turn to get the most out of it- to use the extra trainer you want two people to train, but if you wanted to go straight into business developer for the necessary new house milestone for example, you have to either wait a turn or lose the usefulness of an extra train. Whoever you train round 2 needs to stay at the beach round 3 for the 2nd trainer to be used.

If trainer is on their own island or far enough away from marketeer they can get unclaimed sales milestones, but this plays out like a worse recruiter. Instead we tend to go new business developer for the house bonus and ether coach, guru or night shift manager (if left in a 4p game) to hire and promote people to the top spot straight away, build a team for the big payday.

The issue is, the fast pace of the expansion game means the bank busts twice before trainer can have their mega turns. The trainer has to develop both their management structure which the recruiter has, and get a food and marketing team in place which the marketeer has. Not only that, but as soon as they start to make their money, the second part of their bonus becomes moot.

Now I've read enough plays of this to know Trainer opening is generally regarded as significantly weaker than the other two, but was wondering about a couple of changes and was curious if people had tried them out:

* Removing the ""remove on turn 2"" marker, so either recruiter or marketeer could still jump on this. I don't think marketeer would bother, so it might just fore recruiters hand, but I actually don't think recruiter needs it.
* Swap the ""extra trainer"" perk with lemonade's ""train on the job"" perk.

Also, just to reiterate, I do really like the expansion, I just wish there were three competitive openings which I'm not sure there are.",6,1757257579.0,boardgames,0,1.0,False

I encountered randomly an issue with certain productions that do not collect their input goods.

Two examples I found so far. Rebuilding, moving, pausing and continuing the production, no electricity, removing and buildings streets etc. does not help.

Wine (Wholesome Hacienda Mod):

In this case the all wine cellars are affected. The grapes storage is full, a Warehouse is nearby and obviously it produced wine beforehand as it shows 9% production (still decreasing). The production yells that grapes are missing. After some time, the dude just gets a few tonnes of grapes, starts the production until all collected grapes are made to wine and then stops again for a while.

¬† Ayden, One Year Later  
  
¬† I had my computer open and was working on something for my biochem class. My roommate Cora was sitting on the couch in the living room painting her nails a startling neon green before she left for work, when the door to the bedroom at the back of the house opened. I pushed the glasses I was wearing up on my nose and gave Cora the look. She swiveled around on the couch, so that her arms were dangling over the cushions.  
  
¬† We waited and we watched.  
  
¬† This had become our ritual over the last three months, since Jet had come to live with us. At least two to three times a week, we subjected whichever random chick he had brought home with him the night before to a (humiliating for them, hilarious for us) walk of shame.  
  
¬† Cora and I had taken to ranking them on a scale of one to ten depending on how thoroughly worked over they looked the next day. So far, Jet was coming in with solid sevens or eights, but a couple of the girls had left so pissed-off at his lack of interest in a repeat performance, that we had to give them fours and fives. The one who had locked herself in the bathroom and refused to leave until Cora threatened to mace her got a one.  
  
¬† This one today was pretty good.  
  
¬† She was a blonde and was all big boobs and long legs. Yesterday‚Äôs makeup didn‚Äôt look so hot running down her face now, but she had a nice whisker-burn going on under her chin and she had that dreamy, lovesick look that most of them wore when they came wandering out of that room.  
  
¬† I automatically upped her score because, instead of wearing her bra, she was clutching it in one hand like a lifeline. I was pretty sure her silky top was on inside-out. Her gaze shot from Cora to me and back again, and an embarrassed blush heated her face.  
  
¬† I couldn‚Äôt figure out why Jet never told these girls he had female roommates. I assumed it was because he was a sick bastard and liked the fact they had to run this gauntlet when he was done with them, but he never confirmed or denied it when I asked him about it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUh, hey. ‚Äù The poor thing stammered out an awkward greeting, which had Cora grinning like a lunatic. Cora was mouthy and loud on a good day; give her ammunition or show her a weakness, and she was like a piranha that smelled blood in the water.  
  
¬† My roommate looked like a pint-size fairy princess; well, a princess gone punk rock  
for the day. Cora‚Äôs diminutive size often left the poor things that trekked through the living room unprepared for the attack she was just waiting to launch. This one was all blissed out on a postorgasmic high, and I knew it was only a matter of time before Cora unleashed all of her East Coast sass and brass.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDid you have a good night?‚Äù  
  
¬† It was an innocent enough question, but coming from the feisty blonde with the two different-colored eyes, I knew it was anything but.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSure. I‚Äôll just, uh, be going now. Tell Jet I left my number on the dresser. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Cora waved a hand around in front of her. ‚ÄúSure, because he is so totally calling you again. Right, Ayd? He won‚Äôt want to lose that number. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt like it when she tried to draw me into her verbal games, so I just shrugged and lifted my coffee mug up to my face to hide a reluctant grin. It was like watching a car accident happen in front of my eyes.  
  
¬† Cora waved her arms around in a dramatic sweeping gesture and told the bewildered blonde, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure he called the redhead that left yesterday morning. I‚Äôm sure he called the brunette that stayed the entire weekend, and I‚Äôm absolutely sure he‚Äôs probably going to call you. Right, Ayd?‚Äù  
  
¬† She rolled her eyes and flopped back on the couch, as if she hadn‚Äôt just demolished this poor girl‚Äôs romantic hopes and dreams.  
  
¬† The girl looked at me and then back to Cora. I saw her mouth tighten before she uttered ‚Äúbitch‚Äù and stomped out our front door. I upped her points even more when I saw she had her panties from the night before sticking out of her back pocket.  
  
¬† Without looking up, Cora held her hands up over her head and extended seven fingers in the air. ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt even have any fight in her. I would‚Äôve given her at least an eight if she had told me to fuck off or get bent. Anything. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I shook my head. ‚ÄúYou were kind of a bitch. ‚Äù  
  
¬† She snickered. ‚ÄúGotta find my fun somewhere. What do you give her?‚Äù  
  
¬† I was about to answer when another figure came out of the room. You‚Äôd think that after three months of running into him coming in and out of the bathroom we shared, or catching him running around without a shirt on while he was getting ready to go out, or even watching him dance around half naked onstage I would have built up an immunity to seeing Jet Keller‚Äôs bare chest.  
  
¬† But as he made his way down the hall, pulling on a plain black T-shirt, I forgot every single thought as my mind blanked, just like it always did.  
  
¬† After the disastrous incident outside my apartment last winter, we had developed an odd sort of friendship. I knew what boundaries I had to keep Jet within, and he treated me like I was some kind of virginal goddess he wasn‚Äôt allowed to mess up. That was working for us, sort of.  
  
¬† When Shaw had ultimately decided to go live with Rule and Nash, Cora and I had worried about who was going to take up her share of the rent. Luckily, the girl Jet had been living with went bat-shit crazy, and dumped all of his stuff on the lawn while he was on his last tour, not mention she found someone else to take his place when she got lonely. He ended up homeless and in need of a place to crash, so here he was. I saw him every day and spent plenty of time just hanging out with him.  
But still, the sight of those abs, the ink that covered them and the twin hoops through his nipples turned all my good intentions and strictly marshaled thoughts to all things sexy and naughty, where they clearly didn‚Äôt need to be. When I looked at him I had a hard time remembering the rejection and what I should be doing and instead let his wicked grin ruin all my self-control.  
  
¬† I averted my gaze and ordered myself not to inhale when he leaned over me to snag the other half of my untouched bagel. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to go around sniffing him, even if he smelled like temptation and rock and roll.  
  
¬† He lifted a dark eyebrow in my direction and motioned toward Cora with the bagel.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat kind of havoc are you two wreaking in here? I heard the front door slam all the way from the back of the house. ‚Äù He stretched his long legs, clad in supertight black jeans, out in front of me and I wondered again how he got into them. I had never seen a guy wear such tight pants, but they worked for him. I spent an obscene amount of time wondering how to get them off of him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCora was just wishing your latest conquest a safe trip home. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He paused before biting into the bagel and focused his eyes at the back of Cora‚Äôs head. ‚ÄúWhat did you really say to her?‚Äù  
  
¬† We could see Cora‚Äôs shoulders shaking with silent laughter, but she didn‚Äôt turn her head around. ‚ÄúNothing. Well, nothing that wasn‚Äôt true. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He took a big bite out of the breakfast treat and narrowed his eyes. They were so dark it was hard to tell where the iris and the pupil met.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre just pissed Miley Cyrus copied your haircut and you‚Äôre taking it out on innocent girls across the land. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Surprised laughter shot out of me as Cora jumped to her feet and hurled the nail polish bottle she had been using at Jet‚Äôs head. Luckily, he had good reflexes and caught it in the air before it smacked him in the face or broke all over the wood floors.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had this hair forever! It‚Äôs not my fault she decided to be rock and roll all of a sudden. ‚Äù She huffed out of the room and I shared a grin with Jet.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs sensitive about that. Be nice. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not nice that you two have a sliding scale for every girl I bring home, either, but you don‚Äôt hear me complaining, do you?‚Äù  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt have an answer for that so I turned back to my computer screen.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOne of these days there‚Äôs going to be a ten and you‚Äôre not going to know what to do with yourselves. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I was surprised he was aware of what we were doing. That didn‚Äôt speak too highly of his respect for the girls he brought home with him on a regular basis.  
  
¬† I tucked the ends of my hair, which was now styled in a short, sleek bob, behind one ear and looked at him over the top of my glasses. I wasn‚Äôt sure how I felt about it now that I knew he was in on the game.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you say something, if you knew what we were doing? ‚Äù  
  
¬† He lifted a shoulder in a shrug and I watched as his mouth turned down in a frown on one side. Jet had an expressive face. I think it came from trying to project his every feeling, his every passion, to a crowd of people while he was onstage. I knew the half frown well‚Äîit meant he was thinking about something he didn‚Äôt particularly want to talk about. I always wondered what put it there.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey get what they come for and then they go home satisfied. If they have to tangle with you two knuckleheads on the way out, I just figure that is part of the price of admission. ‚Äù He cut his look back up to me and frowned for real. ‚ÄúWhere were you last night? Everyone came to Cerberus and hung out for a few hours. Shaw said you were supposed to meet us there, but you never showed. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I cleared my throat and fiddled with the handle on my coffee mug. ‚ÄúI was on a date with Adam. He didn‚Äôt want to go, so I just had him drop me off here and I did some homework I‚Äôve been putting off. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I saw his eyes widen and the gold rings flashed bright and clear. Jet wasn‚Äôt a fan of Adam, and Adam hated that I lived with Jet with every fiber of his being. I tried to keep the two of them apart, a task that was getting harder and harder now that Adam was pushing for us to be more than casual dating partners. We had been seeing each other for about four months, and logically I knew it was time to move one way or the other, but something always stopped me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOf course Adam didn‚Äôt want to go. When does that dude ever do anything you want to do? Geez, Ayd, how many freaking operas, ballets, and boring-ass art exhibits are you going to let that moron drag you to? Why can‚Äôt he just come and meet your friends and chill at the bar for a minute?‚Äù  
  
¬† We‚Äôd had this conversation more than once, so I just sighed.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMy friends intimidate him. Rule and Nash don‚Äôt exactly scream ‚Äòwelcoming committee‚Äô and you and Rowdy take way too much pleasure in making fun of anyone and everyone that you don‚Äôt like. It would be awkward for all of us, so I would rather avoid it altogether. Adam is a nice guy. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I told myself that at least ten times a day. Adam was a nice guy and he was far more suited to a secure future than a guy who planned to play heavy metal for a living. Not to mention Adam didn‚Äôt make we want to lose control and throw caution to the wind at every turn, not the way Jet did.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre your friends, Ayden, and Shaw is your girl. If this guy plans on sticking around, don‚Äôt you think he needs to suck it up and get used to all of us? Or are you planning on just ditching us for the upper crust as soon as you can?‚Äù  
  
¬† There was something in his tone that spoke to a deeper conversation than the one we were currently having. But as usual, before I could probe further, he decided to change the subject to something he obviously deemed safer.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBesides, if he didn‚Äôt want Rowdy and me to clown on him, he wouldn‚Äôt wear a damn sweater vest everywhere he goes. Who even owns a sweater vest anymore?‚Äù  
  
¬† I kicked him lightly under the table. ‚ÄúBe nice. Sweater vests aren‚Äôt that bad. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He made a face and climbed to his feet. I tried not to drool when he stretched his arms above his messy hair and the hem of his T-shirt rode up over the edge of his pants. It would take torture to get me to admit it, but my main goal in life was to see how far down that damn angel tattoo went, and to trace the entire thing with my tongue.  
  
¬† I cleared my throat to try to get my head out of the gutter, and noticed he was watching me closely.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the whole point; you don‚Äôt see anything wrong with dating a dude who thinks a sweater vest is badass, and I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with picking up a chick who gets ranked by my shithead roommates the morning after. Two different worlds, Ayd, two totally different worlds. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He ruffled my hair, getting several of the longer strands stuck in his rings as he walked away. I watched him solemnly until he disappeared in his room, before releasing the breath I had been holding. It took a minute for me to unclench my fingers from the coffee mug.  
  
¬† Jet had no idea what I was really like under all the polish and primer I had slapped on before moving to Colorado with nothing but the clothes on my back. No one really did. I had talked to Shaw about it briefly and vaguely, but even my bestie had no clue about the kind of life I had lived before starting college three years ago.  
  
¬† I was only twenty-two, but felt like I had lived a hundred lifetimes in this short amount of time. The good girl, the girl who Jet saw as so untouchable and so different from him, was all an illusion I fought on a daily basis to maintain. Having him so close and so present put my desire to leave the old Ayden buried in the rolling hills of Kentucky to the test, every minute of every day.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey!‚Äù I sputtered indignantly as a dish towel suddenly slapped across my face. Cora plopped down in the chair Jet had just vacated and gave me a knowing look.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI thought you might want that for the slobber on your chin. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I narrowed my eyes at her. ‚ÄúKnock it off. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhatever. Every time, Ayd‚Äîit‚Äôs like you‚Äôre in heat or something. I don‚Äôt know how you guys ignore all the snap, crackle, and pop that happens w  
henever you get within breathing distance of each other, but I‚Äôm telling you it‚Äôs exhausting to watch. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I opened my mouth to tell her, in no uncertain terms, that we were not attracted to each other, but she held up a hand and lasered a pointed glare at me before I got one word out.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt give me that bull about just being friends. I have guy friends. In fact, I have more guy friends than I do girlfriends and I do not look at a single one of them like I want to have hair-pulling, bite mark‚Äìleaving, bed-breaking sex with them. When you look at him when he‚Äôs not paying attention, Ayd‚Äù‚Äîshe made a big production of fanning herself down with the towel she reclaimed‚Äî‚ÄúI feel like I need a cold shower. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt know what to say to that so, I stuck with what I knew.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre friends. We aren‚Äôt each other‚Äôs type and I told you what happened the one single time I let alcohol try to convince me otherwise. ‚Äù  
  
¬† She leaned back in the chair and regarded me with her crazy eyes. The dark brown one was all censure and knowing regard, and the turquoise one was all good-humored mirth and friendly compassion. It was hard to pull anything over on Cora, but that didn‚Äôt mean I ever stopped trying. In order to build the life I wanted, the life I so desperately craved, I had to convince everyone that it was what I had deserved all along. Who I was before wasn‚Äôt allowed to be a factor in who I was now, and no matter how hot Jet was or how much he made me want to wander off the path of good intentions, I just couldn‚Äôt allow it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBesides, we fundamentally want different things out of life. Once I graduate I‚Äôm going right into a master‚Äôs program. Jet has been playing at being a rock star since he was a teenager. I can‚Äôt understand not having the ambition to want something more than that, to want a secure future. We want different things all the way around. ‚Äù Not to mention the way he made me want to forget everything I already knew about the dangers of the wild side totally freaked me out.  
  
¬† She shook her head looking like a judgmental version of Tinker Bell. It was hard to fathom so much attitude packed in such a little frame.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be honest with you, babe. From the outside looking in, you and that boy want exactly the same things, only you‚Äôre both too scared of something to admit it. And FYI, nobody, and I mean nobody, looks good in a sweater vest, so you should just stop trying to sell that poor Adam guy as boyfriend material. ‚Äù She climbed to her feet and gripped the back of the chair, and in typical Cora fashion switched gears while I was trying to process the last bit of insight she had dropped on me. ‚ÄúSo you never gave me your ranking for the groupie of the day, what do you think?‚Äù  
  
¬† It bugged me every time a girl came stumbling out of that room, but I refused to acknowledge it, so I held up nine fingers and played along just like I was supposed to.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe had a seven thanks to the missing bra and inside-out shirt, but after calling you a bitch and stuffing her underwear in her back pocket, she moved up. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Cora burst into boisterous laughter and grabbed her sides. She was cackling so loud I was worried all the noise was going to bring Jet back out of his room.

They were secluded to the hallway where they have toys, they're bed, and enough room for them to play with eachother through the night but, it seems like they had knocked open the gate keeping them in there and they went wild through the house and chewed everything in sight. Also, they just cannot stop going potty in the house, no matter how long we keep them outside and walk with them, they would still go in the house, and the one is athletic enough to jump on the couch, same one they destroyed, and üí© on it.

'Di na ako masyado nagkakape. Last Friday kasi, uminom ako ng Iced Vanilla coffee ng mcdo nung umaga. Then nag-long run ako sa hapon ng 15km. Pansin ko na ang bilis tumataas ng HR ko than when usually pag di ako nagkakape. On easy pace na mababa lang talaga dapat HR ko. Maybe mataas sugar contents hung coffee ng Mcdo? Kaya ayon, I had to be even slower than my LSD easy pace hahahaha.

Some things I found out on my research naman:

\- Umiwas sa 3 in 1 coffees. Mas OK daw ang black coffee. (Question ko lang, OK lang ba 2 tsp of sugar?)

\- Nakaka-enhance naman talaga ng performance ang coffee. Even on my LSD, ramdam ko naman. It's just that nagmamaintain lang ako ng HR zone hahaha.

What I usually eat before runs ay tinapay/biscuit at energen, then hydrate na. I like coffee pero Hindi ako araw-araw umiinom. So OK ba na magkape before or after run? Or magkape on recovery/rest days?

Perhaps you can explain to me what is happening with my body so that I can get some tests done and get an official diagnosis. English is not my first language, so I apologize for any mistakes. I am a 20-year-old woman, 164 cm tall, weighing about 70 kg. I'll describe how my day goes:

I wake up at around 8 a.m. and immediately go to eat. I wouldn't say I really want to do it: it's just a habit, because without breakfast I can't go to the toilet. I eat: I usually try to eat fatty foods because I suspect I have insulin resistance. I rarely eat gluten and sugar, and only in minimal amounts. Nevertheless, breakfast ends up being high in calories. I always drink coffee with cream. After that, the first difficulties begin: I usually can't have a bowel movement for a very long time, even though I feel discomfort in my intestines and stomach. In the end, I manage to go, but (sorry for the details) the stool is hard and there's not much of it.

Despite the discomfort, I go for a walk with the dog, usually covering 5-6 thousand steps. I come back and eat again. Because I don't feel any energy and I think I'm hungry, both physically and emotionally. This usually happens at 12 p.m. Here I eat more carbohydrate-rich food. The calorie count is again high. My brain thinks that if I eat this, I'll become energetic, but... I don't feel any energy. But I don't feel sleepy either. I just don't want to do anything. The easiest way out is to sit and scroll through Reels.

I wanted to try intermittent fasting, but I usually eat one more time in the evening, after 6 p.m. And only in the evening am I able to do anything; only in the evening do I get some energy. So, if you notice, I only start living after 6-7 p.m.

I always wake up at 3 a.m. This started after one month on keto; I stopped it because I would wake up every night in a sweat from nightmares, my heart pounding like crazy. I still haven't been able to fix this.

This is how every day goes for me. I think it's all because of my diet. All my meals are chaotic and very high in calories. On particularly bad days, I have to sleep for one hour during the day and drink a second cup of coffee just to function. This is all very hard for me. Most of my summer has passed like this (I'm a student). What would you advise me to do?",2,1757257134.0,InsulinResistance,3,1.0,False

Over the past few months, I‚Äôve run my own little experiment‚Äîtesting five different services to see who actually delivers, especially for channels from the US, UK, CA, and FR. I probably drank enough coffee for an entire city, but here‚Äôs what I found out.

* * *

### 1\. [**XXIPTV**](https://xxiptv.top/)

*   **Price:** $16/month (a little less if you grab a longer-term [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Best_LPTV/wiki/index/))
    
*   **Channels:** 45,000+ live channels, 220,000+ VOD (strong US, UK, CA, FR content)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 9/10 (even during busy US sports or UK news evenings)
    
*   **My notes:** I landed here after seeing a pretty lively discussion in a Canadian **iptv reseller** group. Setup was fast, and I appreciated that my favorite Canadian news, French movies, and UK reality TV all worked without much hassle. Only a tiny bit of buffering during a thunderstorm‚Äîotherwise, super stable.
    

* * *

### 2\. [**IPTVMEZZY**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestredditIPTV/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $15/month
    
*   **Channels:** 38,000+ live, 130,000+ VOD (excellent for UK and US sports, decent FR/CA)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8.5/10 (occasional hiccup on big match nights, but VOD is quick)
    
*   **My notes:** XXIPTV‚Äôs interface is straightforward and their [**best iptv trial**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Reddit_best_IPTV_2026/wiki/index/) is actually useful‚Äîno card needed, just email. Their UK and US sports sections are stacked, and there‚Äôs a surprising amount of French films. Support was helpful when a few CA channels went down for a bit.
    

* * *

### 3\. [Aurorastreaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestZ2UIPTV/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $14/month
    
*   **Channels:** 32,000+ live, 105,000+ VOD (good variety, especially UK/FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8/10 (smooth for everyday use, had to reload a couple times during UK sports finals)
    
*   **My notes:** [Aurorastreaming](http://aurorastreaming.online/) was a recommendation from a friend in Paris who‚Äôs obsessed with French TV. The lineup is solid for both English and French content, and the VOD library is deep. Setup was easy, but I did notice a couple of news channels lagged during peak hours.
    

* * *

### 4\. [StreamFleet TV](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLPTV_SUB/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $13/month
    
*   **Channels:** 27,000+ live, 80,000+ VOD (mainly US/CA/UK, a bit less FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (movies played smoothly, but sports and live news sometimes buffered)
    
*   **My notes:** StreamFleet is the ‚Äúno-nonsense‚Äù pick. US and Canadian networks are reliable, but the French and UK selection is a little thinner. Their **iptv subscription 2025** signup was dead simple, and support replied quickly when I had device questions.
    

* * *

### 5\. [NovaEdge IPTV](https://www.reddit.com/r/XXPTV_provider/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $12/month
    
*   **Channels:** 20,000+ live, 55,000+ VOD (mostly US/UK, limited CA/FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7/10 (a bit more buffering, especially on UK/US primetime)
    
*   **My notes:** NovaEdge is a budget-friendly option. The lineup covers the basics, but don‚Äôt expect every regional niche channel. It‚Äôs fine for background TV or catching up on older shows, but not for hardcore sports fans or new-release addicts. Their **iptv reseller** info is easy to find if you‚Äôre curious about that rabbit hole.

My IPTV Takeaways for 2025

Here‚Äôs what I learned this year:

*   Always try the [**best iptv trial**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Reddit_Official_IPTV/wiki/index/) before you commit‚Äînothing beats testing with your own devices.
    
*   Don‚Äôt get seduced by the biggest channel list. Focus on the stuff you‚Äôll actually watch (for me, that‚Äôs a weird mix of UK comedy and French crime dramas).
    
*   Even the most [**top rated iptv**](https://www.reddit.com/r/XXPTV_provider/wiki/index/) providers will occasionally glitch, especially on big live event nights.
    
*   If you dip your toes into the [**iptv reseller**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Aurorastreaming/wiki/index/) world, be ready for a steady stream of tech support requests from friends and family.
    
*   And as always, use a VPN‚Äîjust to keep things simple.",0,1757257075.0,GoogleDataStudio,2,0.33,False

will keep this as straightforward as possible:

- visiting nyc in october
- looking for an eager man to eat my pussy like he‚Äôs starving, NO reciprocation aka no PIV or handjobs or blowjobs

You MUST be:
clean, ddf (much more likely to be considered if you show recent proof), respectful, do not expect receiving any pleasure and just love to service a woman and her dripping cunt

My preference for men:
White, older (30-40), bearded, dad bods üíóüíóüíó but not an absolute must! Guys on the heavier or chubbier side also welcome <3
(single/taken/married does not matter)

About me: 
Normal fun girl who has a professional career and loves to unwind in kinky ways. Love a guy spreading ny legs and rubbing my clit. Have a lot of experience being a submissive but is now more of a switch, can adjust our dynamic to your liking. We must meet in a public place first, grab a coffee or drink, then if the vibe is good we can head to my room. No guarantee but if you‚Äôre not a catfish and we have talked on here sufficiently, things should be good. Open to affection, cuddling, chatting afterwards but also would find it extremely hot if you are okay with just eating pussy and leaving.

I will host at my hotel room, I am very discreet but my friend will be next door and notified for safety reasons but she will not disturb us unless absolutely necessary. She will not know your identity except that i will be hooking up and to check in on me to make sure i‚Äôm safe. 

Bonus:
If you want a souvenir i can film you eating me out & take pictures of my bare and smooth pussy for you to keep, so you can always jerk off to the memory

Send me a message with your age/appearance, a little about yourself if you‚Äôre interested. Add a blue heart üíô emoji so i know you‚Äôve read this or else you will not be considered!! Must be willing to share an SFW photo of yourself. 

Hope i‚Äôll get to cover your face in my juices <3",1,1757257049.0,u_Euphoric_Lecture739,0,1.0,True

fall is pretty much here so it‚Äôs one season closer to my favorite - winter, i love feeling so cold that you feel like you wanna curl up and die it‚Äôs kind of a rush. plus i can wear sweaters and stockings without feelings dreadfully uncomfortable. 

i also really like creepy things, whether it‚Äôs gore style art, weird creepypasta stories, horror films, or actually interacting with an insane freaky weirdo, i love it.

Like that coffee, the finest

I ain't got no scripts written on my palm as 
 I'm trying to, you know introduce the album

I'm tryin' to write shit down in my own 
 words and make it as understandable as 
 possible, but I'on know man...

While listening to this album prepare a 
 smoke, some booze and caffeine

Do not forget a paper roll and hella napkins 
 as that ""Wank Anthem"" is bound to roll out 
 here, aight?

You'll also need that bucket for vomiting, I 
 ain't sure how's the shit called exactly
But ya' know what I mean, right?

Gazz Illy
As gross as shirtless eating of that low 
 budget chips on my couch while playing my 
 instrument with the other hand

You know?
Don't forget big titties
With hard nipples

Very hard nipples

Yas

That's that new adlib
Aight

Lemme tell ya' what this shit is about
As I'm bound, to cast some lyrics out
(Brrr) (Brrr)

Without tryin' hard, like that EP of Februar'
Hol' up where is my hashtag?
(Where is my hashtag, like...?)

No time to waste, Gazz Ille
On it again, that's that
(Ratata)
Click clack, New Age (New Age)

My name, I fear it's too late (You 'lready 
 kno') (Ha ha ha)


'Nati claims I'm showcasin' a fast growth
Black and crimson robes, Bohemian Grove
(Psssst) (Don't tell anyone I was here)

We were 'bout to get the ceremony started
Hella fires, with wifey here I see two owls
(Ha ha ha)

'Til this sill' lil' politician 'gan bitchin'
Ain't sayin' who, I'on condone snitchin'
How in here in all smells like arseny

Boy, chill it was me, I just sparked tea
(Here, you want a hit?)
(Spliff)

Shout to the Club, this ones for ya' ('Nati)
Ain't try'na throw shade, but

[Verse 2]
Welcome to my lonely world (Paraboloid)
Antarctica, a land where is only cold
(Can you hear the winds?)
(And the ice crackin'?)

Selfless, I'm try'na be
Selfish, selfish sometimes I really be
As in here it is only me
(Antarctic Sun)

But I cannot remain selfish 's long as I live
 so I'm try'na dedicate a 
 lyric or two to the ladies (Yeah, yeah)

Plati-num really does it for all the cats 
Makin' adjustments 'til I hear purrs (Purr)
Same way I do with my tracks
(Excludin' 'em jack offs)

It's too mild to say I'd only eat that ass (Yas)
Include some bites and a scratch (Scratch)
Like a fight between alley cats (Meow)

'Til my tongue sore, jaw worn eat out the 
 bitty
Then go for the kitty, predator (No kiddin')

Gazz Illy, the finest
Realest, think of me when ya' define it
(Uhuh)

You know M Deezy does some beyond rap
 when 'ven that flower boys mom got wet
To the shit I done spat out, no pun intended

Sometimes I wish for real that I remain the
 way I am 'til my dyin' day
In terms of purpose and all
In ways of my soul, you know? (Question mark)

I classify myself as that kind 
 who rarely gets to turn old
But I also classify myself as kind of my own
Not cause I wanna be cocky, yet cause 
 it gives me drive to go beyond end of the
 road

Swear sometimes, I jot some (Jot some)
Even in sleep of mine
It been like 2018, when I claimed I
 got unsquashed beef with the world

Huh, no wonder I turned out cold

[Verse 3]
Okay, so lemme just bust
Cuss your fucking speakers out

Do it without a prob', without a doubt
Spill out some blood, bet you can this ain't no 
 prop
Ambulance you better call when I pull up, but
 not for me, just like that meme (Hihi)

Long way that I went, riches from rags (Yeah)
But ya' know what I really really hate? (Do you?)
The fact those dealers of kiddos
 be ruinin' dreams of, mine

Like, now 'f I say I want a private island
 mufuckas might plot to have me lifeless (Yea, 
 like...)

See, in this life some really be hard to digest
 even worse than block of cheese   
 and hella dark chocolate (Fo' real)
Mad I am at this world, like
 is this fo' really real how this works? (Yeah) 
 (Fo' real)

All them inflations, beefs between races and 
 nations
Religions and genders, ya'
I'm wonderin' like should Iet this all go
 and resort to be one of those blob heads
 with a suit and tie? (Tell me)

But only if we talkin' politics bitties
 I'm fuckin' with government (Yea, like...)
I pick 'em up in W16, like full thro'll the shit
Fuck the environment

Yeah, life's a hoe, a trifflin' bitch (She is)
But that's my type
 so I just put in like my name Vladimir (So I just 
 put in)

Now, things are different. I start my mornings with a workout, go for walks outside, make coffee at home, and sometimes just enjoy the quiet.

I won‚Äôt lie ‚Äî I miss some parts of the old routine. But what I don‚Äôt miss is the anxiety, emptiness, and regret. Replacing gambling with healthier habits has given me a calmer Sunday night and a stronger start to my week.

So for context, I used to work in fashion and it was truly my passion. After gaining a lot of weight around 2022, I lost my confidence and started wearing big baggy clothing.

Since being on Mounjaro, I‚Äôve managed to lose 2 stone (2-3 more to go), but it‚Äôs help gain some confidence back. I brought new clothes for my holiday in July, including a few pairs of shorts - which I‚Äôve been scared of wearing before because of my legs.

Anyway, I‚Äôve felt a real change the last month with clothing and confidence, thanks to the Mounjaro. I even placed an order for some autumnal clothes yesterday which was a huge thing for me.

So today, my partner and I went into town to see the market and have a coffee. I wore a baggy band tee, a white puff/embroidered pair of shorts and some cowboy boots - I actually felt quite confident and the shorts are even getting looser on me! 

My partner said I looked nice and I started to feel a bit like my old self.

Well, we literally just got into the market and someone starts shouting. I assumed at a friend. The market is busy and we‚Äôve only recently moved to this area so we don‚Äôt know anybody. A band is playing so I can‚Äôt hear what this lady is shouting until a few minutes later and she‚Äôs shouting ‚ÄúSlut! Oi, slut! You deaf slut! You piece of mutton.‚Äù

I kept walking but whispered to my boyfriend to say ‚Äúshe‚Äôs not shouting at me is she?‚Äù And then I realised, everyone was staring at me.

My partner asked the lady what‚Äôs wrong and she said ‚Äúshe‚Äôs my problem, that slut, wearing fancy clothes like that at 2pm on a Sunday!‚Äù

My partner told her to go away and stop talking to me. I went to the side and had a brief panic and then said I wanted to go home as loads of people were looking. He said the lady shouting was clearly an addict and not mentally well so it‚Äôs nothing about me but i guess I just feel humiliated and ashamed.

I finally felt a tiny bit of my old self, weight down and I was brave enough to wear the shorts but then this happened and I feel so shocked. Also for context, I wore these shorts on holiday, to see Oasis and around my parents so I felt like they were fine, they definitely covered my bum and are so baggy  too. The tee is a vintage Beatles shirt so again super baggy. I‚Äôm just so confused. I‚Äôve also just turned 30 but often get told I looked around 25 so I‚Äôm just feeling very downtrodden and it‚Äôs probably silly but I feel a bit scared to go back into town now.",15,1757256755.0,mounjarouk,33,0.71,False

I want to sue/take them to court, whatever just so I can get out but I'm scared that the odds won't be in my favor.

You step outside to the serene sight of Phewa Lake, its crystal-clear waters perfectly mirroring the majestic Himalayas. Later, you'll soar like a bird paragliding over this incredible landscape, and enjoy a delicious, hearty meal for less than the price of a coffee back home.





This isn't a fantasy; it's a daily reality for travelers in Pokhara, Nepal. And in 2016, this incredible value was officially recognized when the world-famous magazine¬†[Forbes](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8002776676476606598/129072356758008766#)¬†named Pokhara the¬†first position¬†travel destination among the¬†20 cheapest places in the world, with estimated daily expenses of just¬†$15.84 per person.

But Pokhara is far more than just a cheap getaway. It's a place where unparalleled natural beauty, heart-pounding adventure, and deep spiritual culture converge, all accessible on a shoestring budget. This article will dive deep into why Forbes bestowed this honor upon Pokhara and how you can craft the Himalayan journey of a lifetime without breaking the bank.

# The Forbes Accolade: A Seal of Approval for Budget Travelers

When a prestigious publication like Forbes releases a list, the world takes notice. Their June 2016 report wasn't just about finding the cheapest places on Earth; it was about identifying destinations that offer immense value, rich experiences, and undeniable beauty for a shockingly low daily cost.

Topping this list put Pokhara on the map for millions of savvy travelers seeking authenticity over luxury, experience over extravagance. The calculated daily cost of¬†$15.84¬†covered the essentials: a comfortable guesthouse, three tasty local meals, and affordable transportation around the city. This headline wasn't just a statistic; it was an invitation to the world to experience one of Nepal's most beloved gems.

# Breaking Down the Myth: How to Live in Pokhara on $15 a Day

Is it really possible? Absolutely. While you might want to budget a little more for splurges like paragliding or a fancy dinner, the core experience of Pokhara remains incredibly affordable. Let's break down the Forbes budget:

# 1. Accommodation: A Room with a View (For Less)

* Budget ($3 - $8 per night):¬†Pokhara is a haven for backpackers. Numerous guesthouses and hostels in areas like Lakeside offer clean, basic rooms with shared bathrooms. For a few dollars more, you can often get a private room with an attached bathroom and sometimes even a balcony with a glimpse of the mountains.
* *Example:*¬†A cozy guesthouse a street back from the main lakefront strip can cost as little as $5-7 per night for a double room.

# 2. Food: A Culinary Adventure for Your Taste Buds and Wallet

* Budget ($5 - $8 per day):¬†This is where your money stretches the farthest.
   * Dal Bhat (The National Dish:¬†A massive plate of lentil soup, rice, vegetables, and sometimes pickles or chicken. The best part?¬†Free refills!¬†This is the ultimate fuel for trekkers and budget travelers, costing around $2-4.
   * Momo (Dumplings):¬†A Nepali staple. Steamed or fried, veg or buffalo, a plate of 10-12 momos with spicy chutney will set you back just $1-2.
   * Street Food & Local Eateries:¬†Avoid the tourist-centric restaurants on the main drag. Step into a local¬†*bhojan griha*¬†(eatery) for an authentic thali (plate of various dishes) for under $2.

# 3. Transportation & Activities: The (Mostly) Free Show

* Budget ($2 - $5 per day):¬†Pokhara's main attractions are natural and often free.
   * Walking:¬†Exploring the Lakeside area, walking along Phewa Lake, and hiking up to the World Peace Pagoda (a 1-2 hour hike) costs¬†nothing¬†and offers the best views.
   * Local Bus:¬†Need to go to the bus park or the old city? Local buses cost mere cents.
   * Boat Ride:¬†Renting a paddle boat on Phewa Lake for an hour is a blissful experience that costs around $2-3 per person.

Total Daily Cost:¬†As you can see, with a little mindful spending, hitting that¬†$15.84¬†target is not only feasible but comfortable. This leaves room in your overall travel budget for the unforgettable paid activities that make¬†[Pokhara](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8002776676476606598/129072356758008766#)¬†so special.

# Beyond the Budget: The Priceless Experiences of Pokhara

The cost is the hook, but the experience is what will capture your heart. Pokhara is the gateway to the¬†[Annapurna Circuit](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8002776676476606598/129072356758008766#)¬†and a thrilling destination in its own right.

# The Unforgettable Landscapes

* [Phewa Lake](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8002776676476606598/129072356758008766#):¬†The heart of Pokhara. Stroll along its shores, visit the Tal Barahi Temple located on an island in the middle, or simply sit at a caf√© and watch the shadow of Machhapuchhre (Fishtail Mountain) dance on the water.
* The Himalayan Panorama:¬†The sight of the Annapurna Massif, including the iconic Machhapuchhre (6,993m), dominating the northern skyline is something you will never forget. Best viewed at sunrise from Sarangkot or from the World Peace Pagoda.
* [David Falls and Gupteshwor Cave](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8002776676476606598/129072356758008766#):¬†Explore these fascinating geological sites, one a powerful waterfall and the other an intricate cave system with a sacred Hindu shrine. 

# The Adventure Capital of Nepal

* [Paragliding](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8002776676476606598/129072356758008766#):¬†Pokhara is one of the top paragliding destinations in the world. Soaring over the lake and mountains with a bird's-eye view is worth every penny of the \~$80-100 it costs.
* [Trekking](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8002776676476606598/129072356758008766#):¬†From the short 3-4 day Poon Hill trek to the epic 2-3 week Annapurna Circuit, every trekker finds their path. Pokhara is the essential pre- and post-trek hub for permits, gear, and well-deserved rest.
* Zip-Flying & Ultra-Light Flights:¬†For the ultimate adrenaline rush, try one of the world's longest and steepest zip lines or take an ultra-light flight for a truly¬†[panoramic aerial tour](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8002776676476606598/129072356758008766#).

# Culture and Spirituality

* World Peace Pagoda:¬†This beautiful white stupa built by Japanese Buddhists offers not only spiritual solace but also the single best viewpoint of Pokhara and the mountains.
* The Old Bazaar:¬†Get a taste of traditional Nepali life away from the tourist center. Explore the old shops, temples, and vibrant local market.
* Refugee Settlements:¬†Pokhara is home to a large Tibetan community. You can visit Tibetan refugee camps to learn about their culture, history, and shop for beautiful handmade crafts.

# Practical Tips for Your Budget Trip to Pokhara

* Best Time to Visit:¬†The peak seasons (October-November and March-April) offer the clearest skies but are the busiest. The shoulder seasons can be quieter and still very pleasant.
* Getting There:¬†Most travelers take a tourist bus from Kathmandu (6-7 hours, \~$10-15) or a short, spectacular 25-minute flight.
* Haggling:¬†Gentle haggling is expected for things like taxi rides (always agree on a price first) and souvenirs, but not for food in restaurants or fixed-price goods.
* Splurge Wisely:¬†Save your money on accommodation and food so you can splurge on the big-ticket adventure activities that create lifelong memories.

# Conclusion: The Value of an Experience

Forbes didn't just give Pokhara a prize for being cheap. It recognized what seasoned travelers already knew: that Pokhara offers a near-perfect balance of affordability and life-changing experience. It‚Äôs a place where your dollar stretches far, but your sense of wonder stretches even further.

The $15.84 daily budget is a testament to the accessibility of this Himalayan paradise. It proves that you don't need immense wealth to witness some of the planet's most stunning landscapes, connect with a rich culture, and push your personal boundaries through adventure.

So, pack your bags, grab your sense of adventure, and prepare to see for yourself why Pokhara, Nepal, truly deserves its title as a world-class, budget-friendly champion.

I‚Äôve been struggling with what I believe is burnout and nervous system dysfunction for at least the past two years.

I don‚Äôt think my current symptoms are mainly related to benzo withdrawal anymore ‚Äì it feels more like chronic burnout.

Here‚Äôs what I experience:

* When I use my phone or stay on screens for a while, my symptoms get worse. My head feels extremely fatigued, almost like a drowsiness, but at the same time I feel anxious.
* I live with constant daytime sleepiness and generalized anxiety.
* My eyes sometimes have slight tremors, as if my brain is overly tired.
* I drag my body through the day and rely on stimulants like coffee and Ritalin just to function.

**Sleep problems:**  
My sleep architecture feels broken. I don‚Äôt wake up refreshed even after sleeping, and the only time I seem to reach deep sleep is in the morning if I let myself fall back asleep. This started after the pandemic, when my sleep schedule got completely irregular ‚Äì going to bed very late and waking up close to noon.

**Current medications:**

* Escitalopram 10mg daily
* Pregabalin 150mg at night to help me sleep I‚Äôve tried many medications for sleep over the years, hoping that restoring deep sleep would fix things, but nothing has really changed.

At this point I feel stuck between fatigue and anxiety, and I don‚Äôt know how to reset my nervous system or recover from this. Has anyone gone through something similar, or found strategies that helped?

1nausao,https://www.reddit.com/r/montenegro/comments/1nausao/ill_be_getting_my_citizenship_by_heritage_soon/,"I'll be getting my citizenship by heritage soon for Montenegro, and am strongly considering moving their a few years (I'm a nomad already), but have conflicting feelings if I'll be happy about that decision.","First, my family is from the former Yugoslavia. Muslim's who speak Albanian, but VERY western as in, the customs are more about tradition and culture similar to say, how Jews often view Judaism - the religion is not taken seriously at all; very Americanized. Most of my family go back and forth all the time, but I've never really been tempted to go back because I identify more with my American side than anything. 

Well being in Europe I recently realized I made a bit of a mistake on my Visa and am now officially an illegal immigrant! (Don't tell Trump), so soon as I exit Europe, I'll be getting banned 1-3 years. And since I have family over in MNE I figured, I'll just jump on over there, and stay indefinitely if I like it. 

However, as beautiful as it seems, it also seems like a hard culture clash, as well as lifestyle clash. Though, I hope I'm wrong. I also kind of want to start settling down and get past the nomad lifestyle, and start dating since I'm in my mid 30s. 

If my MNE side of the family is reflection of the culture, you guys are extremely family orientated and collectivist. Like, as in, hanging out with family literally all day is the norm. When not around, my mother will literally have all her cousins and sisters on speaker phone while no one even really talks and they just watch tv/work, and everyone just sort of quietly sits on speaker phone chiming in every once in a while... Unlike me, who is totally fine talking to my siblings every now and then for 15 minutes a few times a year when I'm travelling. Again, American culture -- very independent. 

The geography seems very beautiful, which I love, but ""what's there to do"" really comes to mind as I talk to people. You guys seem to have a car centric culture, whereas my love for Europe is how I can literally just go downstairs and have a bar, cafe, restaurants, grocery stores, etc... All within walking distance. Whereas out there you definitely need a car to get around reasonably, unless you want to be taking a taxi every time you need to get dog food or a new pair of pants. It just seems like you have to drive everywhere (which I wouldn't be able to do because I have to go back to the US to renew my drivers license). 

But it also just seems in general, a much more insular culture with tight friend groups, and not a whole lot of socializing outside of drinking coffee for hours at a time. The expat scene also seems to be mostly retirees or nomads just passing through. I don't really like going to clubs much any more neither, which seems like is the only other alternatives, however, from what I hear, again, it's just tourists, gold diggers, and Russians (apparently). 

Dating also seems like it's complicated... Just basing it off my cousin's descriptions and stuff I read online, Montenegran women are very hard to get with incredibly high standards... And standards which mostly don't really overlap much with Americans. I mean, I can't really help that because I was raised with a different value system and set of priorities that are kind of hard wired at this point. My relative described it as ""They want big dicks, big banks, and big muscles, who can impress the whole family"" which I found hilarious because well, yeah, who wouldn't prefer that? But jokes aside, it does seem like the dating scene out there is NOT anything like the general European scene, but is instead really really casual and slow, with really picky cultural standards. How true is that? I'm in Budapest right now, where the while women are very beautiful and dating and meeting new people is very egalitarian with little superficiality around it. 

I dunno, just free flowing my thoughts here, because it's something that I want to do, and looks great on paper, but once I look under the covers I'm worried that there may be some significant culture clashing as well as... Boredom. Since I run my business from my laptop, I'm worried I'll just ultimately end up staying at home all day and not really find much to do that isn't just routine tourist stuff.

Review:  
Sometimes I like to sit with a cup of coffee and think about all of the good things in life. Sometimes I sit with a cup of coffee and wait for my body to get generally swept up into motion until I have to take care of everything I‚Äôve been anxiously piling up at the back of the mind.

This cup jolted me awake and reminded me of coffee‚Äôs complexity, with an appealing flavor profile that plays with your expectations. I brewed it as described below. To be completely fair, I pushed the Hario Switch 02 to its limit, exhausting its capacity with 300g of hot water and 20g of ground coffee, medium-coarse ground. I‚Äôve been using a method where I add in the coffee after adding the water, and I ended up splashing out some of the coffee grounds and water. But I didn‚Äôt give up. I had done this once before. 

So, my cup turned out alright and it could have been way better. And that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking forward to trying later this day. The resulting cup, although flavorful, had a few fine particles and a strange bitterness I couldn‚Äôt avoid. I appreciate the bean‚Äôs complexity, as I think that the stone fruit profile and general acidity really shine through, making the cup impressive to say the least.

In my notes on the cup, I mentioned six or seven aromas and only one clear tasting note, the stone fruit. I was surprised by the shift from dark chocolate, almost candy-like aromatics at first that gave way to smells of marmalade and citrus. It‚Äôs interesting how the structure of the coffee when you‚Äôre drinking it (light and syrupy) is so different than the flavor which comes across as very bright and acidic. It‚Äôs delicate, tea-like, and then you‚Äôre met with layers of cherry and chocolate. It smells like chocolate, and then it tastes like orange. It challenges your expectations, if that makes sense. Anyway, this is a great cup and I‚Äôm looking forward to the next. I am, however, biased toward Tanat‚Äôs beans.

Have battled anxiety and panic attacks since childhood, and prone to getting fixated on health issues!
 I have recently been diagnosed with Adhd, put on meds, which I have to say has been an absolute game changer. However, due to the nature of the meds, it pushed my bp to a point the doctor wanted to start amlodipine,  5 mg. 
2 weeks in, bloated, and only put 2 and 2 together that it started with the bp med.
She stopped that, and we are waiting a few weeks to allow my lifestyle changes to take effect, hugely improved diet, cut out salt  and coffee, yoga and meditation. 
I saw an earlier post singing meditations praises, and true enough, I have twice reached 109/70!
I have always been an insomniac, various meds that didn't work/ made me feel ill, I have been given 50 mcg of clonidine a night by doctor, who says it can help with blood pressure too.
Has anyone used Clonidine over an extended period of time with positive  results for bp?!
I have been taking a few nights now, and no side effects except slightly constipated,  which is a rarity! And bp pretty good when I get up in the morning. 
Any input greatly appreciated,  cheers ",1,1757255437.0,hypertension,0,1.0,False

I am seeking friendships with other women. Ideally you are someone who also takes care of yourself physically and emotionally so we can build each other up. 

We can definitely find common ground. I enjoy going to concerts, exploring cities, and traveling. I will be hitting up two more cities before the year is over, and have three trips planned in the next six months. I love camping, hiking, boating, etc. I am very alternative, and am excited to announce I will be attending my city's emo night in the next coming weekend lol! It's a total blast. I love going.

Perhaps a little more niche about me, I am a former gym rat who is remembering herself again. In my prime I was a purple headed freak of nature who was always in the gym. Right now I stay active by doing martial arts and I go for walks frequently. 

I am currently shifting my focus into sculpting my body into my lowest weight (still a healthy weight, to be clear) by feeding it whole, natural foods and exercising. I still have about 45 pounds to lose. I have lost 55 so far. By doing so I am trying to break stereotypes and challenge generalizations about PCOS and weight loss in general. I believe weight loss can be fun, healthy, and you don't need to spend a fortune on supplements and medicine to do it. This is something I am SUPER passionate about and very much fixated on! 

As a result I come across a bit health nutty, but I love talking about recipes and exercises. I find lots of fun recipes and ""skinny girl swaps"" on TikTok that I would love to share with you. I'm totally in fall girl mode and I have a pumpkin cold brew coffee that I am totally obsessed with right now from Starbucks. Plus I'm going to be trying a pumpkin cheesecake greek yogurt bowl tonight. I would love to ramble about my health victories with someone and also hear about yours if you are also interested in these things!!

2025-09-07

Roaster: Tanat  
Origin: √âthiopie ‚Äì Banko Gotiti  
Process: Washed  
Variety: Heirloom (Gedeo)  
Altitude: 2000‚Äì2100m  
Cooperative: Eva Gotiti Washing Station  
Tasting notes (bag): Yellow plum, orange zest, cane sugar  

Review:  
Sometimes I like to sit with a cup of coffee and think about all of the good things in life. Sometimes I sit with a cup of coffee and wait for my body to get generally swept up into motion until I have to take care of everything I‚Äôve been anxiously piling up at the back of the mind.

This cup jolted me awake and reminded me of coffee‚Äôs complexity, with an appealing flavor profile that plays with your expectations. I brewed it as described below. To be completely fair, I pushed the Hario Switch 02 to its limit, exhausting its capacity with 300g of hot water and 20g of ground coffee, medium-coarse ground. I‚Äôve been using a method where I add in the coffee after adding the water, and I ended up splashing out some of the coffee grounds and water. But I didn‚Äôt give up. I had done this once before. 

So, my cup turned out alright and it could have been way better. And that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking forward to trying later this day. The resulting cup, although flavorful, had a few fine particles and a strange bitterness I couldn‚Äôt avoid. I appreciate the bean‚Äôs complexity, as I think that the stone fruit profile and general acidity really shine through, making the cup impressive to say the least.

In my notes on the cup, I mentioned six or seven aromas and only one clear tasting note, the stone fruit. I was surprised by the shift from dark chocolate, almost candy-like aromatics at first that gave way to smells of marmalade and citrus. It‚Äôs interesting how the structure of the coffee when you‚Äôre drinking it (light and syrupy) is so different than the flavor which comes across as very bright and acidic. It‚Äôs delicate, tea-like, and then you‚Äôre met with layers of cherry and chocolate. It smells like chocolate, and then it tastes like orange. It challenges your expectations, if that makes sense. Anyway, this is a great cup and I‚Äôm looking forward to the next. I am, however, biased toward Tanat‚Äôs beans.

Great, this post is just gonna give you a big overview of Kendu from our immense catalogue of IRL efforts to social media efforts that mirror Pepe's.

Just to be clear, by Kendu being the next Shib I mean in terms of Shib's insane 2021 run up

**Kendu Stats:**

* 18,700 Holders
* HHI score of 27
* Certik Community score rating of 93, highly recommend people check out this and compare it to other ""cult"" coins
* 2nd coin to ever reach 50k Certik votes, only other coin to ever manage this was Pepe
* Over 18 months old
* Subreddit in top 10% in terms of size

**Kendu's Social Efforts**

Kendu has an insane Reddit presence and can be seen on the altcoin subreddits, scrolling down the feed you're gonna see Kendu everywhere with unmatched engagement, we have the strongest presence on Reddit in the game rn. On Stocktwits and X we are also insanely strong with presence almost everywhere. We keep up with the best on these 2(even those with way higher market caps, this just shows truly how strong the Kendu community is. Our Telegram activity is actually insane as well beating SPX, Mog and Giga over weekly periods!

**Why Are Social Media Efforts Important?**

Social media efforts were the reason Shib and the other memecoin hall of famers reached the incredible heights they did. Constant advertisement and people working relentlessly to run their investments up, Kendu is not ignoring the path to success that they created and is smashing social media relentlessly. Kendu's social media efforts alone will make it a massive gainer during alt season, we are outworking communities with way higher market caps and holders so just imagine when we have more holders than them...

**Kendu's IRL Efforts**

All of Kendu's IRL efforts are done by the average community member, these community efforts are actually unprecedented and I think it will be quite obvious that Kendu has revolutionised the memecoin space by becoming the first brandcoin! Shib, Doge, Pepe etc revolutionised the game in their time through community efforts, but now it is Kendu's turn to raise the bar.

Here are Kendu's current IRL efforts(I might be forgetting some too):

* Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil
* Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT
* Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it!
* Kendu Hotdog Stand in Florida
* Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far!
* Kendu games - a board game made by 2 chads
* Kendu Creator- a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online, this means you can showcase your skills whilst still remaining anonymous
* Kendu Jewellery
* Kendu Beer
* Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peaks it will be available on Steam and 15% of the profits will be used to buy Kendu for their treasury. We also have a chad called Baba working on a game and Kendu the May who works on simpler games!
* Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : )
* Murals - Spray painted art
* Kendu Entertainment, a glow in the dark pickleball tournament in India that is gaining lots of traction within the sport
* Kendu Street Team, they have visited 4 festivals. They give away Kendu Energy, merch and they also create murals! SO much more is coming soon
* Kendu Vapes
* Kendu Plushies
* Kendu Vendu - vending machines in Nashville Tennessee, but available for worldwide shipping
* Kendu Press¬†
* Kendu Hand Cream
* Kendu Discs
* Kendu Sneakers
* Kendu Spice

**Why Are IRL Efforts Important?**

In a space that has been tarnished and ravaged by bad actors real life products and events give a project a lot of trust. Retail are cautious as ever and so are many other investors, but not to worry! Kendu counteracts this through IRL efforts that show Kendu has¬†**Proof of Humanity**¬†and substance in a world dominated by AI. We are making unprecedented progress and the amount of initiatives under the Kendu umbrella is gonna get bigger and bigger, the Kendu wave continues to grow! Once the average holder has more and more money to invest in their own personal creations, there will be a tidal wave of IRL efforts

**Kendu is paving a new way and setting a new standard for the space.** 

As JFK said -¬†**""The old ways will not do""**

**Join the future, join Kendu**

In our country, we often hear ‚Äúyour network is your net worth‚Äù and it‚Äôs true. Whether it‚Äôs in business, career growth, or even personal development, putting yourself out there and connecting with the right people can open doors you didn‚Äôt even know existed.
Networking doesn‚Äôt always have to look like a formal event with business cards. Sometimes it‚Äôs as simple as grabbing a coffee with someone new, having a meaningful conversation, or building a friendship that eventually grows into collaboration.
It can feel uncomfortable to step outside of our comfort zones, but if you want to get further in life, sometimes the biggest breakthroughs come from the people you meet and the connections you nurture. Zambia is full of brilliant, driven, and inspiring people but you have to be intentional about finding them.

On that note (and slightly off-topic üòÖ), if there are any ladies here between 25‚Äì30 who‚Äôd like to hang out, connect, and maybe even build a little network of our own, I‚Äôd be happy to link up.

So I‚Äôll try and be brief
met hubby 11 years ago, I lived SW Scotland wth my parents, he lived Central Scotland, his parents lived E Scotland 
I was close with my parents, he wasn‚Äôt close with his and rarely spoke to them. Not out of dislike but just not close.
I was hubbys first gf (he‚Äôs firmly on the spectrum but won‚Äôt admit it) but I‚Äôd had plenty serious relationships so I led ours.
When I met hubby I tended to go to him because he didn‚Äôt drive, I met his parents who it seemed were okay. His mum had the beginnings of dementia so convo was mostly with his dad 
When we got up to leave, his dad went to give me a hug. Ok I‚Äôm a hugger so accepted it. Then he gave me a big wet kiss - I thought it was going to be on the cheek so accepted it (I‚Äôm of the age when you‚Äôre extra polite to prospective in-laws). However he twisted at the last minute and landed his lips on mine. I twisted the other way but his lips made contact briefly. I backed away from him and was so shocked i didn‚Äôt say anything. He didn‚Äôt say anything either and hubby didn‚Äôt see properly. I‚Äôd said oh your dad kissed me but hubby was like oh I dunno I didn‚Äôt see it and sort of brushed it aside
His dad didn‚Äôt spend much time with us so that was fine, I thought oh I‚Äôll just avoid him because I‚Äôd fallen in love with hubby. 
When we got engaged we felt our parents should meet, so FIL and MIL met us at hubbys house and we all drove down to my hometown (my mum was disabled and so was my aunt. By this time we‚Äôd moved to a place north of my hometown which was near where hubby socialised.) When we were nearly there I got a call from my dad to say he wasn‚Äôt feeling well, my mum was ready to go though so could I just get her instead of dad walking her to the restaurant. I said to FIL, with apologies, and he just said ok (i didn‚Äôt go into detail about why my dad felt ill but was gastric related). He stops near the house and just as I‚Äôm saying I‚Äôll be back in a minute (mum and dad lived by the restaurant) he interjects and says in not so many words ‚ÄòI‚Äôm coming to meet your dad, he‚Äôs old and this might be the last chance I get‚Äô. I try to say I don‚Äôt think that would be a good idea etc but he ignores me so I let him in. My poor dad was sat there with a basin full of vomit feeling and looking awful but had to ‚Äòreceive‚Äô FIL and greet him, if I‚Äôd have done that and seen someone was so obviously ill I‚Äôd have been mortified but he wasn‚Äôt. My dad was maybe 15 years older than FIL

Hubby and I rush our wedding because dad‚Äôs diagnosed with a brain tumour.
Our venue was gorgeous with a big sweeping staircase down to the ballroom where we say our vows, before we go down, I‚Äôm stood with my dad and FIL comes along and offers to walk me down the aisle because he knows my dads ill. Ok nice gesture but my dad was determined so I decline. FIL then says well I‚Äôll walk behind you then in case you need help. I don‚Äôt have it in me to argue, was concentrating on dad and making sure he was happy and safe. So FIL trots behind us, most photos I have of my dad walking me down the stairs have my FIL in them.
Later that day FIL insists on ordering bottles of red wine for him and MIL, hubby ends up taking his car keys from him (FIL was going to drive to the nearest town as there wasn‚Äôt an accessible room for him)

Cut to the honeymoon (weekend away in Edinburgh because I was afraid of leaving my dad too long) and I continue calling my dad like I did since he got ill (hubby was ok with this). I go for a bath and FIL calls hubby, I encourage him to answer because it‚Äôs only fair imho. Huby answers and FIL says can I talk to MRS xxx hubby says no she‚Äôs in the bath, FIL says what‚Äôs she doing in the bath ü§Øü§Ø

All my family and my MIL have now passed, I‚Äôve been cognisant of the fact that FIL is now alone so encourage hubby to call him often especially as FIL doesn‚Äôt have friends. FIL is also poorly (hernia but too overweight to get anything done, can‚Äôt exercise because he‚Äôs always needing the toilet and won‚Äôt use incontinence aids - toilet issue is likely because hernia is pressing on bladder etc) also his diet is poor - usual meat stew type foods cooked in slow cooker on a Monday and he eats it out the slow cooker throughout the week. He doesn‚Äôt drink though and hubby didn‚Äôt think he had a drinking problem (likely overexcited and showing off at the wedding). 

Fast forward to November 2022, I fell very ill after a medical malpractice and became disabled due to neurological damage causing me to have very poor balance, spent 2023 and most of 2024 in bed/a wheelchair but decided to fight tooth and nail to get better. My speech as well as my balance has been affected (basically I seem drunk all the time).
Hubbys been my carer up until February this year.

Now hubbys never been good at housework, he says I‚Äôm mentally ill because if there‚Äôs stuff on the floor I‚Äôll pick it up or clean it, my flaw is I shop too much (relevant). Not hoarder level but I don‚Äôt like binning useful things - now my dad would keep a pen if there was a tiny bit of ink left. Plus I shopped for aspirational things ie oh il buy a case of wine because we‚Äôll have dinner parties. Neither hubby nor I drink much if at all. He‚Äôll do very basic things like if there‚Äôs dirty dishes or clothes he‚Äôll clean them eventually but not mop floors etc. we had two cats and dog so needs done regularly. 
I told hubby to invite FIL for Xmas 2024 because I was feeling a little bit better, I‚Äôd managed to do stuff in the house and it was like ‚ÄòI want to get back to normal‚Äô. Plus again was thinking FIL Is on his own etc
House looked great, even though I had to crawl to clean stuff I‚Äôd done it. 
Hubby went to go collect FIL on the 23rd, he was getting stuff out the car and FIL strode in the door and said ‚Äòhi, I‚Äôd forgotten how bad it was in here‚Äô. Now FILs house is dirty, he has a cleaner but he has so much tat everywhere (hoarder level that he gives to us and we have to bin it) he can‚Äôt shower to the extent he‚Äôs had a constant leg infection. Like his shower is, to him, an extra storage space. 
I stammered a bit and burst into tears. Hubby came in and I spoke to him, he said ‚ÄòI told him (FIL) not to say anything about the house‚Äô. But my anger is why say to the ill disabled person when there‚Äôs an able bodied man there who doesn‚Äôt work (in fact hasn‚Äôt worked since before we got married because we lived off my parents estates). At that point I was angry because hubby kept saying oh no I don‚Äôt need to do anything else, it‚Äôs fine

Got worse from there
So we ate dinner , at bedtime I went up early (hubby and I have separate bedrooms) and halfway through the night I woke to hear heavy breathing outside my closed door. I don‚Äôt think he was doing anything other than just standing there but still ü§¢ i have no doubt that if the bedroom door was open he‚Äôd have poked his head in to chat. I asked hubby to ask him the next bedtime if he needed anything because I was a very light sleeper and was getting woken up with him walking around. He had a tv in there, blankets, the option to take a flask etc

Xmas day was ‚Äòok‚Äô, our friend came over for dinner and would chat with anyone but was regaled with stories of FIL and his exploits in the TA - ie that he was in it not that he was wandering around exotic locales - or that he was a baggage handler in Heathrow. Now our friend is super nice but he‚Äôs very very well travelled and intelligent and used to be an archaeologist so super interesting. Our friend spent the whole of Xmas day just listening to FIL‚Ä¶..as in if you offer him tea he says il have it xyz because that‚Äôs how we had it in the TA‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ or oh in the airport.
Anyway the next day he says can he go home it‚Äôs his first time staying away and he misses home. Fair enough he doesn‚Äôt travel and just goes to the supermarket or for appointments usually. Hubby says ok but we say can we talk first. And it‚Äôs about he needs to shower etc and eat properly etc etc. I also interject that he can‚Äôt say our house is messy and full of stuff then try to give us his old stuff, he has a car if he doesn‚Äôt want it then it can go to the tip.
Halfway through I need to go to the toilet so I get hubbys help. Hubby was sat on the arm of the chair facing FIL, I turn my back to FIL (tight gap but only way to get past) hold hubbys hands to sidestep past. Fine, on way back though I do the same because I had a lowish cut long dress on and didn‚Äôt want to give him an eyeful. This time he puts his hands on my waist, I‚Äôm so busy concentrating because I keep thinking I can‚Äôt fall on FIL, he THEN slides his hands over my hips to cup my buttocks 
Part of my condition is like a coordination issue - I can stay balanced but if there‚Äôs noises my brain can‚Äôt zone them out so I get over stimulated almost and get wobbly, ofc I‚Äôm terrified I‚Äôm going to fall onto FIL, if I whirl round to confront him I‚Äôll fall so I‚Äôm stuck really.
I manage to get past and tbh I‚Äôm so in shock I flop onto the sofa mute.
My brains still processing this and it‚Äôs time to take FIL home, I sit in the back seat and pretend to sleep because I‚Äôm so shaken. We get back to the east coast and FIL says bye and gets out I‚Äôm still pretending to be asleep. When he goes into the house I get out and go to the front seat, he sees me, comes rushing out the house and hugs me and kisses me on the lips. I push him off and hubbys just says daaaaaaad and rolls his eyes like Kevin The Teenager
We get home and I try to tell hubby about the groping but whether he‚Äôs not understanding my speech condition, choosing not to understand or what,  he just says I told him to stop - referring to the kiss. No matter what I say he doesn‚Äôt hear that it‚Äôs a different instance. So he‚Äôs hearing me say I‚Äôm upset and he thinks I‚Äôm angry at him instead of his dad
This goes on - I‚Äôve told friends who are horrified and tell me to tell hubby but I can‚Äôt get it through to him. I try repeatedly. Stupidly at first I kept thinking what if he does it to someone else and they have to go through it, I‚Äôd feel awful if they had to go through it when he thinks it‚Äôs ok to do it 

Other things happen- I‚Äôve got marked as mentally stable (had enacted power of Attorney when badly ill but to get it removed I had to prove I‚Äôm able to deal with it myself) and got back driving. Part of me pushing so hard to get better is because I‚Äôve been r‚Äôd before but i wasn‚Äôt as scared and feeling as defenceless as I did then. My stubbornness has pushed me to fight past it

In MARCH I basically have a meltdown because i saw a police programme where they‚Äôre called for a customer doing that to a barmaid - I have a freakout scream what his dad did and somehow hubby gets it. But then says well I don‚Äôt know what to do about it. 
I said call him now and speak to him because if you don‚Äôt I will.
He ums and ahs and says it‚Äôs not the sort of thing you say over the phone, I have to say it in person.
So I say go get in the car now. 
He ends up going the next day and his dad says I don‚Äôt remember ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è hubby then says (at my request) she doesn‚Äôt want to see or speak to you anymore and that‚Äôs that. Any time I speak to hubby about it he goes ‚Äòbut I spoke to him about it‚Äô again it‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm blaming hubby but a) I need to deal with it and b) maybe I want an apology from hubby for brushing it aside for so long, maybe if he‚Äôd spoke to FIL sooner he wouldn‚Äôt have been able to use the excuse ‚Äòoh I don‚Äôt remember‚Äô üôÑüôÑ

I feel better mentally BUT hubby (although he‚Äôs now working) still gets gifts of money from his dad as he did before, so I think if he‚Äôs not going to refuse it, the least he can do is to check he‚Äôs ok. So I remind him to call.
The other day he says (after I‚Äôve said to be polite I hope your dad‚Äôs well) dad says he‚Äôs hoping you‚Äôre okay and he misses saying hi etc. hubby did say it grudgingly because he was unsure if he should say it
Now I‚Äôve been pushing myself really hard and and a lot better than I was, I can speak a little better and my mobility is better and improving. 
I‚Äôve said to hubby I want us all to go for a coffee but I don‚Äôt want the subject brought up. I want this I think because I‚Äôm doing things MY way IYCWIM, if I‚Äôm afraid of something I tackle it straight on now, and I‚Äôm refusing to be afraid of him. I don‚Äôt want to hear his excuses or more likely blame (hel maybe say oh your bum landed on my hands or something stupid) and I want to feel strong. I‚Äôm not into arguing i wouldn‚Äôt start a fight or mention it myself, I want him to see 
Hubby says no.
What do I do? Who‚Äôs in the right?

1naugfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1naugfk/online_dating_date_being_too_touchy_on_first/,Online dating date being too touchy on first coffee date,"Hi Reddit,

I‚Äôm 25F and I have never been on a date before. Decided to try Hinge to see how it would go and got matched with this guy. He is much older (31M). He asked me out on a coffee date right away so we met up for 1 hour ish. He was really touchy (tried to touch my thighs, held my hands, hugged me from behind, and kissed my face). I told him that this is my first date ever and would like to take it slow but he continued on. It never got that bad because I said kiss on the lips is off limits but am wondering if first date is usually this touchy feely. Maybe it‚Äôs because he is older? I‚Äôm scared to think if I want another date because I‚Äôm interested in him as a person (his work and hobbies) but he went on about trying to press my limits so I would think of him. Please advise on what you would do

Edit: my friend wants me to also point out that he skipped the small talk and asked me out on a coffee date on the app right after we matched",25,1757254895.0,dating_advice,60,0.82,False

1nauekr,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenExplorers/comments/1nauekr/discover_if_the_blackdecker_3in1_waffle_maker/,Discover if the Black+Decker 3-in-1 waffle maker deserves your kitchen review.,"The **Black+Decker WM2000SD 3-in-1 Waffle Maker, Grill & Sandwich Maker Compact Design**, combined with the **Black+Decker Rice Cooker 3 Cups Cooked**, promised to revolutionize my kitchen game. I've used these products for several weeks now, putting them through a variety of tests‚Äîpreparing everything from waffles and grilled sandwiches to perfectly steamed rice. While these appliances certainly delivered some winning points, there were moments that had my inner culinary critic raising an eyebrow.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed upon unboxing was the compact and sleek black and silver design of the waffle maker and the white, sturdy finish of the rice cooker. Both appliances are perfect for those who don‚Äôt have a lot of counter space. The waffle/grill/sandwich maker fits neatly in a cabinet, even with its interchangeable plates, and the rice cooker is lightweight enough to tuck into a corner or cupboard. The cool-touch handles on the 3-in-1 device were a highlight; not once did I feel the need to grab a mitten while flipping waffles or removing sandwiches. I also have weak wrists, so the manageable weight of these appliances was a blessing. However, while the design prioritized functionality, the rice cooker lid felt somewhat flimsy, which gave me slight doubts about its long-term durability.

**Ease of Use**  
Ease of use was undoubtedly a high point for me. My mornings are chaotic‚Äîspilled coffee, half-burnt toast, and kids rushing out the door‚Äîbut I found myself genuinely appreciating how intuitive these appliances were. The waffle maker‚Äôs indicator light, which turns on when the plates are preheated, became my silent hero in ensuring everything cooked evenly and perfectly. Switching the plates between the grill, waffle, and sandwich setups? A breeze. On the flip side, the rice cooker also stood out with its ‚Äúkeep warm‚Äù function, which automatically kicked in once the rice was ready. But, if I‚Äôm being honest, I did have to squint at the 1-3 cup markings on the measuring cup; they weren‚Äôt as clear as I had hoped.

**Cooking Performance**  
The 3-in-1 device did a commendable job of delivering beautifully golden waffles, crispy sandwiches, and evenly grilled veggies. Since I‚Äôm also very calorie-conscious, I loved the grease run-off channels. They kept my food light and less oily without sacrificing flavor. With the rice cooker, I tested its versatility by preparing not only white rice but also quinoa, risotto, and even oatmeal. It cooked each type well, though the oatmeal required a bit of stirring midway to avoid sticking at the bottom. The steaming basket was a surprise favorite‚Äîsteamed carrots and broccoli came out fresh and vibrant. That said, while the waffle plates heated evenly, the grill plates occasionally left one corner slightly cooler than others, resulting in uneven grilling for larger batches.

**Strengths**  
- Compact and sleek design, ideal for smaller kitchens.  
- 3-in-1 versatility with interchangeable plates for waffles, sandwiches, and grilling.  
- Rice cooker‚Äôs ‚Äúkeep warm‚Äù function ensures no reheating needed for hours.  
- Nonstick removable plates and dishwasher-safe rice pot make cleaning simple.  
- Cool-touch handles are a lifesaver during busy cooking moments.  

**Critiques**  
- Rice cooker lid feels slightly fragile for everyday heavy use.  
- One corner of the grill plate occasionally doesn‚Äôt heat as consistently.  
- Rice cooker measuring markings could have been more prominent.  

**Product Alternatives**  
While the Black+Decker combo is a solid contender in its category, I couldn‚Äôt help but compare it to a few alternatives in the market. A popular rival is the Cuisinart Griddler, which is slightly larger and offers a higher temperature range for grilling tasks. However, the Cuisinart lacks the waffle-making functionality, which makes the 3-in-1 product more versatile for breakfast enthusiasts. On the rice cooker side, the Zojirushi 3-Cup Rice Cooker edges ahead in the texture department, producing fluffier rice in smaller batches, though at nearly double the price. Ultimately, the Black+Decker set offers a practical balance of features without breaking the bank.

**Value for Money**  
Considering the pairing of two appliances‚Äîeach designed to fulfill multiple roles‚Äîthe price performance of this duo is incredibly strong. On its own, the 3-in-1 device competes with even pricier waffle makers while delivering added grilling and sandwich-making capabilities. Similarly, the rice cooker, while modest in technical features, is sufficient for small households or anyone approaching cooking in a minimalist manner. For budget-conscious individuals seeking reliable kitchen appliances that don‚Äôt compromise versatility, this combo provides great bang for your buck.
