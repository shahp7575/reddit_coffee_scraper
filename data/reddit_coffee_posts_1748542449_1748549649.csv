An escape room does none of these things. The other person is literally trapped with you and forced to interact.  If things go bad, it is very awkward to stop, and that will likely scare people away from a date.

I had a panic attack earlier today and I didn‚Äôt have anyone to talk to about it. I‚Äôve been feeling incredibly isolated lately and it hasn‚Äôt helped I‚Äôve had to deal with a lot. Most of the time, I‚Äôm on my own with my thoughts. I used to have a support system but over the past couple of years things have slowly fallen apart. I‚Äôve lost all my friends, don‚Äôt have any family support, have had to give up on uni because of my depression, so it feels like everything‚Äôs crumbling apart and what little I had to look forward to is gone. I had to give up on the one career goal/dream I had, which required my degree. 

Right now I‚Äôm going through a lot and dealing with it all on my own. There‚Äôs the stress of potentially being kicked out by my family because of not finishing uni and them going on about how I wasted all the opportunities they gave me, money worries and just this constant feeling that I‚Äôm losing everything bit by bit. I did have a counsellor but I can‚Äôt carry on cause of the cost and I need to save up as much as I can as when I get kicked out. I won‚Äôt have anyone I can go to and will need to find my own place. I try to keep busy and hold it together, especially at work but when I‚Äôm off or alone it really hits me how empty things feel. I haven‚Äôt attempted for a while and have dealt with suicidal thoughts in the background throughout all this but today my head has taken me back to the point of figuring what would work and what I‚Äôd need to get if I needed the option. 

I‚Äôm applying for jobs I‚Äôm not even interested in and don‚Äôt really have any other choice just so I have an income for now but keep getting rejected, I‚Äôve tried retail, supermarkets, admin and any other type of job that I can do. The issue is that most decent jobs require degrees and the ones that don‚Äôt, I know will have a tonne of applications so the chances of progressing with the applications are even slimmer. 

I don‚Äôt want to be a burden on anyone but days like today feel unbearable without anyone to reach out to. I just wish things felt a bit less heavy and that I didn‚Äôt feel so invisible. I wish I actually mattered to people. I‚Äôve come to realise that people often don‚Äôt reciprocate the efforts and energy put into friendships and will give different amounts, but it feels like I‚Äôve always been the one to give more and now that I can‚Äôt it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm no use to anyone. I have one person I can talk to about this stuff but don‚Äôt want to drain her of her energy and she can‚Äôt always be there and has a stressful and busy enough job without me adding to the mix. It‚Äôs times like this I just wish I had someone to chat to, not even about the heavy stuff, but for a distraction so I could stop thinking about how bad things have gotten. Someone I could share TikToks or go for walks or a coffee with but it‚Äôs so hard making new friends and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm interesting enough for people anymore.

Betty Virgin scuffed her crystal slipper on the gritty linoleum beneath her table and thought about how wildly that guy -- what was his name again? -- had fucked her. When Betty had sat down an hour earlier and ordered a coffee, she had been terrified, sure all the other patrons of this New York City diner knew exactly what kind of dirty words she'd screamed when she was bouncing on that guy's dick, riding him cowgirl style as if there were no tomorrow -- that the word ""slut"" was shining all over her in flashing neon. But as time continued to pass without any pastor approaching and ranting about how much she'd disappointed her parents, her teachers, and Lord Jesus, and how she was going to get pregnant, get AIDS, die of the aforementioned AIDS, and burn in Hell for eternity, Betty's more rational mind prevailed.

She didn't look like a non-virgin after all. Her eyes didn't have a lustful squint. Sperm wasn't tricking out of her sparkly skirt down her legs (she'd wiped herself clean before leaving that guy's place). Then there was the matter of her clothes, which were those one would expect a well-raised girl to wear, not revealing much skin, let alone underwea...

1kykqpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1kykqpy/ive_had_a_formal_complaint_against_my_coworker/,I've had a formal complaint against my coworker for over a year and I'm his 'superior' and he just won't listen,"The main body of this story happened over a year ago but it's important to the current issue so bear with me. There's a TLDR at the end though because this got longer than anticipated 

I (25NB) work in a relatively large small company in a comparitively small town. I started off there when I was 22 out of uni.
After a few months in the job, and having friends there now, my manager found out that outside of work I use they/them pronouns (I had never mentioned or insisted on it in work say job isn't particularly social and it doesn't hurt/offend me to be referred to at she/her). My manager, with the best intention (though admittedly misguided) briefed to this to the team. 

While most of the team adapted or at least tried to one member, Dane (50s M) suddenly had a problem with me. Constantly referred to me in feminine terms, with feminine adjectives etc. and while this didn't offend me in and of itself, I knew the intention was to offend me and that was irritating. It was manageable though. I told my manager it was happening so it was noted and went about my days. 

Next, out of nowhere my birth name came out of his mouth. Now, Ive gone by the same name since I was 18 and the reason for the change had nothing to do with gender. My OG name was gender neutral  (think Alex, Cameron etc), I changed it for some personal reasons. 

So hearing it from my random coworker was a little concerning. I asked him how he knew that and he acted like he was Sherlock fucking Holmes when, long story short, he found my family through my FB and went back in thier timeline to before I was 18 to see if I was referred to differently. I was. Which is less detective work than creepy. 

When he refused to stop calling me it, I spoke to my manager again. She spoke to Dane. Nothing changed. 

I tried to ignore it. 

Next was the homophobia, I was single at the time though I was going on dates. I'm bi so the dates varied in gender. Dane often made comments about WLW relationships being sexy but how I would ultimately end with a man which is 'how it should be'. 
Again I reported it to my manager. Who reported it to her manager nothing happened. 

Next he approached me while I was talking to my friend Rachel (19 at the time) who is, importantly, not white. He made a comment or two about 'her kind' and insinuated she wasn't there legally. I defended Rachel pretty aggressively, more so than I had ever defended myself. And somehow Dane still managed to end this conversation by suggesting a three way. 

Again I reported it to my manager. Who went to her manager. Who went to her Boss (Dan). By this point getting very frustrated. 

Finally there was a week of nonstop hate thrown at me including but not limited to telling me LGBT people didn't deserve rights, stating that being gay is 'a fashion choice', stating that me and Rachel would make a very 'exotic' night for him and finally (after trying unsuccessfully to involve another older man in his hateful speech) tells to 'get back in the kitchen where [I] belong and make [Him] a coffee""

At this point, having given up on chain of command, I went to HR personally and spoke about it. They were (to my surprise) unaware of Dane. I had been assured on all my other occasions talking to leadership roles that they had alerted HR as to his behaviour. 

HR spoke to Dan who, suddenly, thought this was very serious and had a meeting with me and HR where I chose to file a formal complaint. Dan asked if I would accept an apology from Dane. I said no. At this point I had experienced nearly a year of hate and harassment. I didn't want an ingenious apology 

Dane was suspended for 2 weeks pending investigation where they spoke to my manager and Rachel and other witnesses. 

At the end of the 2 weeks Dan pulled me aside. Said that Dane had received an informal warning  and had apologised to Dan, who believed he was sincere and Dan had accepted it
This sent me insane. 
What did he mean an informal warning to my formal complaint after they had (by their own admission) decided that I had told the truth and it was unambiguously hateful. And even more so, how dare Dan accept an apology on MY behalf?!

Anyway, I took some time off after this and when I came back had a very stern, formal meeting with Dan about HIS behaviour to the situation 

It's been about a year and a half since this and having worked my way up the company since I'm now in a position  in which it is my job to monitor and audit the work the work of a group of employees. I'm not a manager, I'm not thier boss, I simply make sure their paperwork is in order and thier behaviour is within the legal/moral guidelines to any client. 

Dane is one of the employees in my group.

Until this week, in my role, I'd had no cause to interact with him but, well, Dane isn't very good at his job (the same job he's been doing since before I started) and had come to the room I work in to ask a question. 
Generally speaking, you should direct questions to the person responsible for you (so me) but we all help whoever has a question. Dane approached and I was the only person available. 

I asked how I could help and... nothing. Didn't even acknowledge me. I asked again, he looked at me and then away. I ask AGAIN and finally he asks his question. 

While I'm answering he turns and starts talking to a person walking past about music. Then asks me the question again. While I'm answering he interrupts me with a very rude ""you could have just said no"" 
Like yes the answer was no, you can't do that, but I was explaining why and how to instead approach the problem, within regulation. 
So I try to answer again, he turns and walks away, turns back to call me useless. 

It just feels like it's starting again

TLDR; my coworker was incredibly hateful to me, I raised a complaint, my company are basically useless and told me not to interact  and now that my position involves monitoring him I HAVE to interact with him and things have not improved ",1,1748549202.0,coworkerstories,0,1.0,False

I'm a 23-year-old boy, weight: 78 kg, height:183 cm and I need help identifying a condition I've been struggling with for about a while.
Sometimes, different parts of my body start to feel a tingling sensation‚Äîlike pins and needles‚Äîbut it also feels itchy at the same time. Imagine a weird combination of tingling and itching happening simultaneously. Occasionally, this sensation spreads like a wave, similar to a ‚ÄúMexican wave,‚Äù moving across multiple areas of my body.
The main areas affected are: from my chest upward, including my neck, the back of my neck, upper back, scalp, the roots of my hair, my face, my beard area, and my arms from the elbows up. These episodes can last for several minutes and are extremely uncomfortable. The moment I try to scratch one spot, several others start tingling at the same time. It feels impossible to get relief.
After a few minutes, the areas where the tingling and itching occurred turn red and inflamed. The redness usually fades once the episode is over and my skin returns to normal.
When does this happen?
It tends to occur when the weather is slightly warm, when I drink hot beverages like tea or coffee (although I once even had a mild reaction from drinking cold water), when I get angry (even if I don‚Äôt show it outwardly‚Äîjust feeling slightly irritated internally can trigger it), when I have nightmares while sleeping (this one‚Äôs rare, but I‚Äôve noticed it), when I physically exert myself and sweat (like running), or when I feel anxiety or stress. In short, the triggers are unpredictable‚Äîalmost anything can set it off.
Imagine you're talking to a friend, a relative, or even a professor, and suddenly your body starts tingling, your face turns red, and they think you're just shy or embarrassed‚Äîwhen in reality, you're suffering through something very different. It‚Äôs honestly a horrible and distressing experience.
I've seen doctors about this. Since I heard that itching and skin inflammation can be linked to liver problems, I did an abdominal ultrasound and blood tests to check for fatty liver, but everything came back normal‚Äîmy liver enzymes are also within the normal range.
I also saw a dermatologist (I have rosacea and dandruff too), and I tried a few medications, but none of them worked.
Has anyone here experienced something similar? Does anyone know what this could be or what I should do?

Hey Light Travelers üåå

During yesterday‚Äôs online Lightbath Coffee Talk, we explored a powerful protocol designed to support out-of-body experiences using neurovisual light sessions.

It starts simply: you imagine moving your fingers, then your limbs, gradually progressing to full-body walking‚Äîwithout physically moving at all. Under the influence of flickering light from [LIBA](https://www.lightbath.co.uk/product-page/liba-magnify) or [LOOM](http://lightbath.co.uk/loom), this inner kinetic visualization helps loosen the body's spatial tether. The result? Many report states of expansion, floatation, or slipping into altered planes of awareness.

We also ventured into Rupert Sheldrake‚Äôs theory of morphic resonance and the extended paradigm of biological systems‚Äîhow memory and consciousness might extend beyond the individual mind:
üì∫ Morphic Resonance: [what is it? by Rupert Sheldrake](https://youtu.be/d_RGEpJSr6s?si=mHrA3Md_qQKwy3A3)
üì∫ Extended documentary: [The UK's most controversial scientist](https://youtu.be/67Y5dRyX4mM?si=laI9qaf8Rsq2gZ1d)

From there, we flowed into how art and film mirror these liminal thresholds of consciousness. For example:
üé¨ ""Filmstudie: 1920 Silet Short by Hans Richter‚Äì [Watch here](https://youtu.be/ZXrjrr6ifME?si=m__Be5PvhlzOym5e)
üé¨ Jean Cocteau's ""Testament of Orpheus"" 1960 [Watch here](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6z4mdr)

üìöFor those of you diving deeper, the Book of Highs by Edward Rosenfeld catalogs 250+ techniques for altering consciousness‚Äîmany of which echo what we‚Äôre now rediscovering through light, sound, and intent.

One thread that stood out was about telepathic phenomena in nonverbal children, particularly how entering dominant Delta brainwave states seems to unlock cognitive abilities many would call extraordinary. In some documented cases (see: [Telepathy Tapes](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6lsUJdGLFx7OGLRQCQfHQPWcMDPc5Ey7&si=kcdlh4mmQGf8md5O)), children accessed shared awareness, deep empathy, and even nonverbal communication beyond conventional channels‚Äîsometimes including spontaneous OBEs.

All this seems to weave into a larger field of entrainment, neuroplastic potential, and shared morphic connectivity.

Curious if anyone here has experimented with Delta-based protocols, or wants to dive further into the intersection between biofield science, art, and neurovisual light practices.

1kyko9g,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1kyko9g/coworker_tried_to_stop_me_from_getting_sterilized/,Coworker tried to stop me from getting sterilized,"I'm almost three weeks post op now but I'm still thinking about this so I wanted to share.

I had a bilateral salpingectomy and it took me about 6 months from scheduling the initial consultation to actually getting surgery even though I'm in a blue state. I notified my job in November that I would be needing to have surgery but due to getting run around in circles over medical clearance I didn't actually get my official surgery date until April. Unfortunately I had to state which surgery I was having when pressed for information.

I found coverage for my shifts and requested for two shifts to be covered; the day of my surgery on a Friday, and the following Monday. I wasn't scheduled to work that weekend and so I was planning on having those four days off work in a row to recover. I put my time off on the calendar and wrote down who would be covering.

The coworker who makes the schedule texted me several days later before a shift that I was going to need to choose to have my surgery on a different day because she was going on vacation and ""had her time off requested well in advance"" and ""we can't take the same days off"". She also said she had run this by our manager and she was ""so sorry but you can always try for next month!"" She also said the people who agreed to cover my shift could not because they work in a different department even though when we call out sick they often cover for us.

If I couldn't have my surgery on May 9th the soonest available for me according to my surgeon's office was September.

I freaked out and called my manager and explained that I needed to have this surgery and could not just pick a different day and he had no clue what I was talking about because my coworker had lied about talking to him about this. He said I could have the time off for surgery and we would make it work.

I am 100% certain this is because she objected to it for religious reasons. A year ago I offered to get coffee outside of work since we were friendly and she told me that ""now she can't because she spends a lot of time at church""

I got my time off approved and paid for with my sick leave, she now no longer talks to me and makes a point to not make eye contact unless she texts me something about the schedule. 

I'm currently job hunting so this won't be something that I will have to continue to deal with for much longer hopefully, but this whole situation has been so bizarre to me.",7,1748549037.0,childfree,3,1.0,False

This Monday my coworker (m26) messaged me to ask me to switch shifts with him, my open for his close, so he could see a movie premiere. I said no because I simply didn‚Äôt want to and I wanted to work with my opening coworker because she was my friend.

Well this morning he called out because he was ‚Äúsick‚Äù. He sent me a message saying he told the manager he called out as a ‚Äúheads up‚Äù to me.

Normally this isn‚Äôt my business but when it was time for the other closer(F31, not sure if relevant) to come in she said she considered calling out because she had a fever but didn‚Äôt. I said she needed to go home if she was ill but there was no one to close and my friend coworker was on her 30 so it was just me in the full coffee shop. Our manager was supposed to cover for the called out coworker but was taking forever to come in so I had to work with her for a while.

She said she should go take a Covid test just in case and grabbed one and disappeared. When she came back she said it was positive and simply stood around in the back and break room which is close to where I make drinks and wouldn‚Äôt leave because the manager and called out coworker weren‚Äôt there.

I told her I have an autoimmune disease and am immuno-compromised and to please go but she didn‚Äôt.

If my coworker didn‚Äôt call out this probably wouldn‚Äôt have happened as bad as it did. And I feel extra angry about it because he regularly calls out for stupid reasons and regularly talks about how much he hates this job and wants to quit. People are also always calling out on nights which sick coworker works which is why she felt obligated to come in.

I asked my friend opener when she came back what she thought and she told me it would be kiss-assy and not my business to snitch but I think he deserves it as his selfish choice was a part of endangering my health. I also think if he wanted to see the movie and didn‚Äôt find cover he could simply go on a different day or time as that‚Äôs the adult thing to do.

And the staff calling out when not sick so often makes it hard for the staff that don‚Äôt call out. And trust me, I know for certain because the staff all talk about it in a group chat. Lol. It annoys the hell out of me but I bite my tongue because I don‚Äôt want to get bullied.

Regardless in my opinion I think this crossed the line so I want to tell the owner.

This is the text I typed to her:

‚Äú(Owner), I'm sorry to text you please let me know if this is something I need to submit to HR instead but (friend coworker) and I's health was compromised today and I feel like this is a serious issue but (called out coworker) called out to literally just see a movie today. If he hadn't done so (sick coworker) wouldn't have stayed on the clock so long, she even said she considered calling out but felt she couldn't. She wouldn't even leave the floor for a while because there was no one there to take her spot which isn't really any one's fault but (sick coworker‚Äôs). (Sick coworker) tested positive for Covid when she came in. I am immuno-compromised and have systemic sclerosis and this doesn't cause an issue and it's my responsibility to protect myself but in an instance like this it's really kind of crazy. When I was sick with Covid I was afraid I was going to die I had become so gravely ill. I really don't care that this makes me look like a snitch but this is a genuine and recurrent problem and it usually isn't my business but our health was jeopardized because of it today.‚Äù

His parents both passed when he was fairly young and he was taken in by my Uncle (his dads brother). They moved to the UK (from Asia) in the 70's and my dad followed along with them, he was rebelious as a child and started smoking young, didnt go to school etc

When he got into his teens he decided on his own that he wanted to return to asia as he wasn't enjoying the UK, his uncle allowed him as he was now old enough to make his own choices. He went back and was doing things like dish-washing in restaurants, stayed in cramped places that housed like 5 guys in 1 bedroom, just living and getting by essentially, he was also hanging around in the bad crowds and getting into street trouble.

My grandmother (my mum's mum) knew of my dad from a young age, as they were all neighbours when his parents were still alive. Naturally she always felt sorry for him, so  she persuaded my mum to marry my dad and a small part of the reason for doing so was also because she wanted her daughter to be able to get out of asia and into the UK (via my dad) because at the time it was seen as a very prestigious place to be and better chances to make a good life, my grandmother wanted the best for both.

fast forward to them having 3 kids, me being the middle child and the only 'boy'.

In the olden day tradition's there was always some sort of bias towards having a 'boy', back in asia there are rules about only being able to grant family land to 'boys', boys also were the hope to bring families out of poverty etc we all know this has changed now but this was a very common (and might still be) in some area's of the world.

My dad was somewhat the opposite, he has also self-admitted this to me over the course of growing up, my sister's both went to private school's, the eldest was seen somewhat as a golden child, the youngest was treated as the 'baby' and although I would never say that I was even treated 'bad' or as an outcast etc. He just made it pretty clear that he liked his daughters more, and this was evident to all his friends, our wider family.

He was (now that I found out as an adult), abusive to my mother (I never witnessed physical, but I definetly heard the vocal parts). That is why she left him nearly 10 years ago now but they are still on speaking terms but she said she just could not deal with him as a person any longer and only stayed this long together until we (the kids) were self-sufficient and had left the nest.

He is a chain-smoker and has been since he was around 14 years old, he went through a brief alcohol phase, he has never looked after his body ever, never seen him drink anything other than coke, red-bull or coffee with 5 spoons of sugar, have only ever seen him eat maybe a handful of the same dishes/food in my entire life, he essentially has never had to answer to anybody other than himself and hence he just does whatever he wants, whenever he wants. Everybody when he was growing up and even up till the age he is now has essentially said they wouldn't cross/question my dad because 1. he has a temper and 2. they felt sorry for his situation growing up

As a dad he I would say definetly spoiled us, even myself. The businesses that he started up did ok so we were always rewarded with money rather than time, I did have the newest games consoles and gadgets growing up, I got a car when I pass my driving test, we were never unfed, I could and would never even complain about our 'living standards' because they were for sure above average. 

But the amount of time we would actually see them (including my mum) would be maybe an hour or so in passing each day. Never asked me about any of my school work, at parents evenings I would hang around waiting with my friends and hanging around with their parents, they would always ask me where are mine ""too busy"" etc and it just became the norm.

The reason why my mum wasn't able to attend was because she doesn't speak english, my dad is fluent in english and it became his main language before he even had kids so things to do with any after-school activies (which I never went to) or any events he could have dealt with but majority of the time was busy doing his own thing.

When we were in our late 20's and had already had some decent means to support ourselves he was offered a good amount of money for his last remaining business, he could have essentially retired from this amount but he said no, his reasoning (which he never told us, and we found out from others) was that he was still financially supporting us (kids) but he wasn't. He kept the business around to himself because he needed somewhere where he was still 'the boss', he had no hobbies to do if/when he retired so it just became a burden he put unto himself because when the business started to obviously falter he never even cared, he just carried on doing the same old thing and even business managers advised to do things differently etc and he just said he's done it this way for x long and he knows best. Either way that business had eventually crumbled and he got nothing in return for it at the end.

Now that he's been retired for a good few years we thought that this might then give him more time to persue anything other than what he has been doing, the first year or so he essentially from what I have heard was just out 'partying' and paying for peoples tabs, drinks etc. He wasted alot of money during that period and even over his lifetime, he needed to always come across as the 'big guy' who will sort xyz out or be a saviour of some sort.

But my main memories of him are that as a kid he would chain-smoke in the car and not allow the windows to be opened because he doesnt like the cold air, so we just got used to the 2nd hand smoke I guess? He is heavily into watching sports (supports 1 team religiously) and yet never once introduced me to any of the sports he watched, has never said the word 'love' in any afflication, and many similar moments of where I felt with my own child now that Imagine if I didn't do any of this with my own child, i'd feel guilt.

Present day and he is 65 but with the body/mobility of an 85 year old, even after multiple hospital trips where the doctors said you need to do more of X and less of Y, nothing has changed, he's not going to do any of it and we have accepted that as a family, but what has now made me put out this post is that now i'm the 'son'.

He's my dad, but I can't say that he was a father-figure to me. But any issues that now arise its somewhat said that ""but, you're 'the son', it is your duty"". My siblings live within the same town as him (less than 5 minutes drive) and I live a good 2.5 hours away and although I don't have to do everything, there are times when he has even said to me that there are certain things 'the son' does. Even though I am also essentially doing pretty much everything for my mother also since she doesnt speak english, all her admin, doc's appointments, travel, banks etc. My siblings dont really have to do it because I am essentially 'the most resourceful' and I can sort things out faster.

My friends parents of similar ages once coming to retirement have taken active roles in their grandkids lives, they want to see them, they want to know how they are doing etc. My dad calls when he needs something and only then asks towards the end of the call if my kid is doing ok. Even when my kids was growing up I could never have left my child with him because his place is extremely unhygenic, he would 100% have smoked around them and I just can't trust him to not have a bad influence (multiple instances which will be too lengthy to mention).

All in all its just become a thing in my mind that I cant get over how now it's convienient to tell me that I should be doing a 'sons' duty for this and that, in asian culture a lot of it is based on 'face'. My son is a doctor, my daughter graduated from Oxford, my son takes care of xyz. 

So I understand that there is alot of comparison involved but for those children to have gotten to Oxford/Cambridge/LSE etc, the ones that I have personally known, their parents were very actively involved in instilling certain values in them, showing them the path and even at least some sort of guidance. Whereas my dad in my eyes has done the complete opposite in those terms and yet still expects the same treatment from a 'model son'. I just feel more resentment towards him the more he expects and I know that path just 100% does not good for anybody because he's not going to change now at all but its a feeling I just cannot shake mentally.

After pressing start he would walk away and then KABOOM! That microwave exploded and hurled a spoon at Jesse and would impale him into his very brain from behind the back of his head! 

However, the spoon carried microwaves from the microwave and when the spoon impaled jesse in the deepest reaches of his brain through the back of his skull, instead of being dead those microwaves would transmite into that deepest reaches of his brain and alter his very DNA, transforming this salty tempered night auditor into SPOON MAN!

He doesn't fight crime and still goes to his crappy job that he both fears and hates.

**1) A water treatment system?**

Which one is recommended for the Bianca? I saw a guide for plumbing in the machine, and the guy said ""RO water is a no-no for this machine"". I've seen others on this sub swear by it, so I am a bit lost.

**2) Running a water line from under the sink to the wall?**

My buddy suggested putting a pipe going from the sink that terminates in the backsplash, and running the pipe for the Bianca and the water machine through that. Is this the optimal solution? How thick would such a pipe need to be for the Bianca's line and 1/4"" pipe together?

**3) Designing the coffee niche in a certain way?**

I am currently looking at a 62cm wide by 80 cm tall open niche to accommodate the Bianca and a water machine. Is this sufficient?

1kyk6vf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1kyk6vf/help_with_mia_producer/,help with MIA producer,"Hi all,

Around this time last year I got connected with a producer who‚Äôd read some stuff of mine and asked to meet in the hopes that I‚Äôd written a script in a particular genre they were looking for. I didn‚Äôt have anything, but I pitched some ideas and they loved one in particular. We immediately started bouncing ideas off each other. This was pretty exciting as they‚Äôre producing partners with a pretty big star who also loved the idea.¬†

They encouraged me to keep going with it, so I asked about money. They said their production company had no money for development, but that if I wrote it they‚Äôd take it out to pitch. They‚Äôd been having meetings with places who were all looking for this specific genre, so there would be guaranteed interest. I wasn‚Äôt convinced, but some friends encouraged me to go for it‚Äî since hardly anyone was getting paid for work at that time anyway, I might as well take the risk with the star.¬†

So we start developing and the producer is very enthusiastic/involved. Whenever I send an idea or an outline they immediately get back to me with detailed thoughts. We email, we meet for coffee, we talk on the phone, etc. I don‚Äôt agree with a lot of their notes but I work extremely hard to incorporate them into the script anyway cause we're in this together.

I finish the script and send to some screenwriter friends who have basically zero criticism. It may not be their favorite script ever but they all agree it‚Äôs very well crafted and professional. I‚Äôve done my job by writing a solid script based on the extremely detailed outline the producers loved.

I send the first draft to the producer at the beginning of January and they don‚Äôt respond. I follow up a week later to ask what‚Äôs up. They apologize‚Äîthey‚Äôre housing friends after the LA fires so things are chaotic, but they‚Äôll get to it later that week. Around this same time they also sold a movie that they had to write, so I know they‚Äôre busy. But after about 5 more weeks of silence I follow up and receive  no response. I wait and follow up. Ignored. I email again. Nothing. I text. Nothing. For several months I‚Äôm flat-out ignored by the same person who‚Äôd previously call me the same day I emailed. At the beginning of April they finally send a one-sentence email saying they‚Äôre on a deadline for the movie they sold. They have to finish it in the next few weeks, then they‚Äôll focus on mine.¬†I‚Äôve heard absolutely nothing since. I emailed again two weeks ago with no response.¬†

At this point it‚Äôs been five months, which is generally speaking not an egregious amount of time to wait for a producer to read. However, given this person‚Äôs previous level of dedication‚Äîand the fact that they can‚Äôt be bothered to write an email or text with an update‚ÄîI'm extremely frustrated and confused. This script has their fingerprints all over it. I spent months and months crafting it to fit their vision even when I didn't agree with their vision. I never would have written it if not for their promise to pitch it when completed!

To make matters worse, I left my manager before the strike and haven‚Äôt found someone I click with since, so I don't exactly have tons of options of people to send it to.¬†Does anyone have thoughts/suggestions for?

Now my problem is that every time I decide on a pair, I want there to be something that doesn't sit right with me, or I find a new pair.

For context, I am a grad student who has always used AirPods Pro 2, and am buying headphones for the first time. I'm by no means an audiophile(but I was able to understand the Sennheiser M4 and b&w px5s3 have way superior sound quality than the other pairs I have mentioned).

Coming to what's important for me in headphones:

1. anc(need to be able to block subway and coffee shop sounds)/sound quality(if its any help: i think airpods pro 2 sound just as good)
2. multi-device connectivity and automatic switching between my devices, I use an iPhone, a Mac, and an iPad. While I understand it might not be as seamless as AirPods, I would not want to go into the app to switch my device, or the other issues that I read about in threads on some of these devices(like M4 needing not recognizing mac or automatically preferring the mac when iPhone has the audio playing etc)
3. battery life - a good 30-hour battery life would be good(considering I take long 14-hour flights).
4. Comfort - I expect to wear them for 5-6 hrs straight for normal usage on a daily basis.

1kyjz45,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSCCruises/comments/1kyjz45/msc_world_america_yacht_club_thoughts_based_on_my/,MSC World America Yacht Club thoughts based on my May 2025 sailing,"MSC World America Yacht Club Experience - May 2025

My thoughts after sailing on the MSC World America in Yacht Club in May of 2025. This contains my opinion and info I gathered from being on the ship as a paid passenger in YC. I have no affiliation with MSC other than as a paying guest.

Quick review - I really liked the ship. I loved the crew‚Äôs enthusiasm. The Captain and YC Director were very approachable and really fun to chat with. Great knowing crew from other YC ships - really made it feel welcoming.¬†

I have sailed many cruise lines. I have sailed MSC several times in Yacht Club but I make sure to explore all areas of the ship to get a realistic feel for other experience levels.

Embarkation at Miami Terminal AA: the new terminal is massive. Uber dropped me off right at the YC tent. Unfortunately there was no attendant at the luggage tent. Bags were piled there. After about 5 minutes an attendant started processing luggage. He explained that they were short a person. Bags were tagged and then no Butler. I saw one leave a few minutes before so just followed where they were headed. A few minutes later a Butler was about to pass me and I asked where I should go. He took me inside the actual building, thru the scan and security. Handed me off to the Butler in the large open terminal waiting area where the wristbands and cards are given. At this time there is no YC waiting area, just a roped off section with a shelf of drinks. Waited for about 3 minutes and a butler was there to escort onto the ship. The Butler brushes politely past the non-YC guests and I followed. I wish there was a better way for this boarding as it always feels rude to push past people - but for now this is how MSC does it. Once onboard I am ushered to the muster check-in and then to the Top Sail Lounge where drinks are very readily available. Warm greetings from all staff. Sit for a bit and enjoy the beautiful space with a view of the RCCL Icon. Suites were available very quickly. Met my Jr Butler and my Butler - both incredible people who helped make my trip. I felt very lucky to have two great people as my go-tos on this cruise. YC Concierge was also excellent - very impressed.

Top Sail Lounge is on Deck 19. The lounge is accessed via a slightly offset entrance near the YC Elevator & Stairs, cabin corridors and a staircase from the dining room. It is similar, but not identical, to the Top Sail lounge on the Seascape. The space feels big, bright and luxurious. The bar seating area is much shorter with only about 8 stools. There is no walk up snack/buffet area. The sofas and chairs are very deep so sitting upright to play a card game or eat snacks is difficult for all but long-legged guests. The seating appears comfortable, but may not be practical. There is an outside forward area that has seating and is perfect for a short night stroll. I did not order many fancy drinks but they were able to make coffee drinks and other drinks not on the menu. FYI a print menu is available if you ask and that includes info on the small bites they have on offer. The food options are severely limited and this lounge does not have the same fun dessert items found on other ships which was very disappointing. There are nightly musical performances. The Captain‚Äôs reception is held here as is a once per cruise afternoon tea. Each evening there is a special punch of the day made from a cart - highly recommend trying each. They can also be ordered from the menu if you like a specific drink. Service in YC Top Sail was incredible. The entire World America crew that I encountered were outstanding, far surpassing any other cruise I have been on.¬†

YC Restaurant is on deck 20 and is accessible via a door on the same deck or the crystal staircase from the Top Sail Lounge. This is the only crystal staircase on this ship. The restaurant has great forward ocean views and overlooks the lounge. Great table set ups for all different travel groups - 2 people tables were available as well as for larger groups. Service was on point - friendly, but not over the top as found in some main dining rooms (no singing or begging for ratings). The Sous Chef came to each table to discuss the meal. A very knowledgeable Sommelier was also in the dining room to assist with wine choices. I‚Äôll touch on food later. The dining room serves breakfast, lunch and dinner with hours posted. Menus for the day area available within the App or on the dining room reception desk.

YC Bar & Grill is located outside on deck 21. This deck is accessible via an elevator, inside stairs and forward/aft stairs the starboard side cabin corridor. Unlike other YC outdoor dining spaces, the YC Bar & Grill is a table service eatery. There is no buffet. There is no bar seating. All food items are from a printed menu (cheap paper photocopy which was odd). The food items can be modified to some extent. Meals served are: Breakfast, Lunch. There are some lunch items that can be ordered from a server on the pool deck on 22. Service was very quick. The space feels like a high-end resort pool restaurant. There is minimal shade despite the glass being tinted. On hot days, when the ship is not moving, the space is very warm. Great views are somewhat lessened by the tinted glass, but the tinting probably helps keep down the temp a bit. There are about 5 tables that are under cover so if shade is needed, get there early. The Bar & Grill feels more like a restaurant than a bar. Never had the bar vibe which I think it needs to encourage more social interaction for those wanting it. Staff always great.

YC Sundeck & Pool is located on deck 22. This deck is accessible via an elevator or exterior steps from YC Bar & Grill or the YC Lanai. At first glance this pool looks small. According to staff, the pool is the same size as the one on the Seascape but it is lacking the surround area so it appears smaller. The hot tub is probably the smallest hot tub on the ship (not including suite hot tubs). Despite my original concern about the pool deck, I found it all to be perfectly sized. There were covered loungers, full-sun loungers, the pool was never full. The main problem on this pool deck is there is no bar. Guests must walk down to deck 21 or wait for a server. I found that I did not want to order a drink that required a server to walk the stairs so I went and got my own drinks. I am not complaining, this was my choice. I felt for the servers having to do the stairs. There was a bar cart that would make rounds with some of the more popular drinks. Also ice cream was served in the afternoon - a really nice surprise. Overall I really enjoyed the pool deck on World America when I had thought it would be the weakest aspect of YC.

YC Lanai is on deck 21. Accessible via: steps from the YC Pool deck; card gated steps from the Top 20 deck; via card doors off the main forward elevator bank; YC corridor doors on port and starboard sides. It is an open space that overlooks the main ship pool. This area is sparse with only loungers and 4 tables. No bar. A counter with water. Servers are supposed to check this area but I cannot confirm this. Almost no one was on this deck during my sailing. Best place to get away from everyone if that is your thing. Very hot during the day. I mostly used it to get from down to the main pool area via the steps thru Top 20.

Top 20 is on deck 20 and is specified as for Aurea and YC guests. This is one of the best outdoor spaces on the ship. It is accessible from YC via card reading gated stairs. Also can get to it from the terraces portion of the main pool. The Top 20 has a HUGE covered bar with stools, many tables, loungers that are standard ship loungers, towel service, and TWO HUGE cantilever hot tubs. I would rate this Top 20/19 area as best in the fleet (matched by World Europa I expect). Only on sea days was this area busy, but not overloaded. The YC takes over Top 20 for the Starlight event - a nighttime party with dancing, drinks and sad small snack bowls.¬†

YC La Brasserie is on deck 19. During dinner hours, this buffet location is converted into a YC only family dining restaurant. Speculation is that this dining venue was added to take some of the pressure off the YC Dining Room - I cannot confirm this. What I will confirm is that this dining area is GREAT. The menu includes a variety of appetizers from Baked Goat Cheese to hummus to delicious Mac & Cheese, and entrees that are meant to be shared but are not too huge for one. This concept turned out to be one of my favorite additions to YC. Casual. Delicious. A warm dining room space that doesn‚Äôt feel like you are eating in a buffet area. The rest of the buffet is closed so this is only for YC. Service was perfection. The food service crew also works in the YC Bar & Grill during the day so you will see familiar friendly faces. Highly recommend eating here - I ate there 3 times on a 7 day cruise, it was that good. Some praise the views during Miami sail away. I prefer the 2nd night which is much quieter. Also a great place to eat on gala night if you don‚Äôt want to dress up. Reservations are required.¬†

World Theater on deck 7 with a dedicated YC seating area. There are two rows of roped off seats for YC guests. A Butler will be posted on each side of the seats before the show begins. I personally do not care for the YC seating in the theater on any of the ships I have sailed. The rows are very far back. And once the Butler leaves other guests will move in to take any empty seats. I expect some appreciate this perk to YC, and it certainly can help those who do not plan and arrive a moment before the show starts. This is the only theater space that has YC reserved seating.

The YC Elevator services all YC floors from 15 to 22. It is a single elevator that has a touch screen inside, unlike the other elevators on the ship. Never waited more than a minute but your results may vary. There is a staircase next to the elevator for those who want to burn off some calories. At each elevator stop there is a small lobby with seating which is almost never used by guests.

Disembarkation from YC was easy. Like most cruises, you can put your luggage out the night before for pick-up OR walk off with your luggage. Check out of the suites was 7:30am. Breakfast was served in the YC Dining Room. Drinks are served in the YC Top Sail Lounge. You can leave your suite and have breakfast and then hang out in the lounge until you choose to leave. 10am was the latest they were allowing guests to remain. Butlers escort guests down to the security area which bypasses the main line of guests exiting the ship. Once off the gangway, YC guests are mixed in with other guests as expected. YC Luggage is picked up in the designated YC part of the main baggage claim area. It was all pretty smooth considering how many passengers there were.

Thoughts on the other YC Guests during my sailing: 98% of the guest were super friendly and mellow with no attitude. There was about 2% of YC guests on my sailing that were acting entitled. Examples of entitlement: disregard for a SCREAMING child in the dining room (not just crying, top of the lungs screaming thru the meals; reserving YC loungers in the best spots for entire day despite not using them; high-jacking the elevator with their YC card so other guests were left on the wrong floor and unsure what happened; AND even YC guests (2 times) using their override elevator card to cancel floors of fellow YC guests in the elevator. Fortunately most of the guests were very mellow or friendly with little attitude. Some wonderful people.

How would I rate the YC on MSC World America? I would rate it a 9 out of 10. The only reasons I would not give it a 10 is related to the furnishings and design.

The Top Sail lounge needs couches that are not so deep, needs some tables for playing cards/games, needs some sort of display of snacks available or bring in a rolling cart with treats. The bar needs to be longer with more stools. 8 stools for such a huge space is not enough.

The Bar & Grill needs more food variety (this change is in the works thankfully). The bar should have been designed with stools - everyone loves a pool bar! There needs to be more shaded tables.

Pool deck has no bar and the Bar & Grill discourages hanging out by not having any stools.

Some food at the YC restaurants appeared and tasted just like that found at the buffet - talking about waffles, pancakes, hash browns, oatmeal, french fries. I don‚Äôt recall thinking this on previous MSC cruises.

The GREAT: The food at all of the YC locations was mostly very good. There were several slip ups on my orders, but all were corrected without fuss which showed me how much they cared. All drink service was excellent. I gladly praised the staff to the YC Director and Captain. The MSC World America YC Director is outstanding - listens, informs, such a pleasure to get to know. All ship areas were spotlessly clean. Staff around the ship were helpful, friendly and on the top of their game. Bravo. I can‚Äôt wait to sail again.

These are only my opinions. You may disagree, but please do not argue with me. We all experience things differently. Probably most importantly‚Ä¶ I paid for my cruise. LOL. And I‚Äôll do it again. Thanks. Hope it‚Äôs a great day.

Im planning on painting the walls to a white graying color. Ive been stewing on a few options on how to shift the living room around:

Option 1: Leave the tv there and maybe perhaps install a floating shelf underneath as well as adding a floating shelf under the tv to block off most of the void. I do plan on buying a new sofa and coffee table soon. However the kitchen is right there so im limited on the size of the couch.

Option 2: Remove the tv and place the couch facing me. Right now my couch is turned away from the door and I never liked having a couch in the middle of the room, I prefer my back to the wall. If i do this, what could I use to block off the hole? Banners/flags are kind of tacky so maybe an accent?

**Roadmap**

**Terlingua ‚Äì January 15**

The sun was just waking up.  
And you thought I was sleeping.  
Wrapped tight in your blanket  
you clung to your coffee like hope.  
I watched you play with birds.

You crept behind cover like you wouldn‚Äôt be seen.  
They kept you a bush away,  
close enough to keep you chasing.  
So you did.

In that moment I saw you for you.  
Before I knew your depths.  
That morning I knew I would love you.

**Salt Flat ‚Äì February 23**

We drove all day,  
but it felt like an instant.  
We talked about everything‚Äînothing.  
Subtle glances,  
grazing touches.  
Our comfort told us we were onto something.  
Neither of us had to say it.

When we got to our camp the sky was on fire.  
We knew it was performing.  
Mirroring what it saw in us  
like we put it there ourselves.  
We hadn‚Äôt said it yet  
but our eyes knew the words.

**Santa Rosa Beach ‚Äì May 4**

Handshakes and smiles.  
Talking about my job.  
Four generations together.  
My first time meeting most of them.  
My time to shine.

But really,  
seeing your role, your peace, your glow.  
Daughter, sister, mother, rock.  
Watching your smile fill the room.  
Your warmth filled my heart.

The three of us shared a room that night.  
We made love while¬†>!NAME\*!<¬†slept.  
Silent, but on fire.  
I held you so tight.  
You always fit like you were made for me.  
You surrendered.

It made us stronger.

**Gila Hot Springs ‚Äì May 26**

Who gets this far away just to run and look at stars with someone they love?

What do we see here that we don‚Äôt see at home?

I see you.  
At peace. Decompressed.  
Curious. Soft.  
Your touches, your words,  
I‚Äôm in awe of your poise.

Are we finding our stride?  
Is this comfort safe?

We share the same love,  
for each other, in life.  
We don‚Äôt take it for granted.  
Like air or a date circled on the calendar,  
we don‚Äôt have to talk about it,  
but we know it‚Äôs there.

In this moment we are eternal.

**Cuchara ‚Äì July 4**

Our first two bedroom cabin.  
Our first family trip.

Taking turns.  
Building trust.

Walkie talkies, shoulder rides, and beaver dams.  
Stomach born laughter.

She was perfect.  
And you were happy.

Our corner of heaven,  
It was all we needed.

**Crestone ‚Äì October 12**

Fall in Colorado feels different.  
The sun never makes it all the way up in the sky,  
and the cold from the night before never really burns off.

We read all about Crestone before we made it there.  
A strange town with its own energy,  
but I think we brought this one with us.

A subtle shift.  
Not worth talking about,  
but something that can‚Äôt go without noticing.

It‚Äôs not to say that the empire is falling,  
or that we‚Äôre at some point of no return,  
but a peace is missing.

Your voice used to be higher when you talked to me,  
and you used to tell me sweet things that would just trail off  
like you weren‚Äôt sure if you should keep going or if you‚Äôd already said enough.

You came back to me at night,  
but I felt your distance during the day.  
I feel a change.

You used to always touch me when you walked by;  
finger taps on my shoulder,  
a kiss on my head.

Now I long for it,  
but I‚Äôm left waiting.  
I know I‚Äôm reacting to this.

**Jemez Springs ‚Äì February 14**

We ran through the mountains together.  
Not for the first time,  
but I never would have guessed it would be our last.

7,000‚Äô.  
It was snowing, we didn‚Äôt hesitate.  
We never did when it came to running.

Later I asked for your hand,  
and told you I‚Äôd give you my life  
if you just said yes.

(I thought) the answer came easy.  
Things always did if we didn‚Äôt fight it.  
‚ÄúIt shouldn‚Äôt be this hard.‚Äù

Now I look back at this trip,  
and I can‚Äôt remember the details.  
Am I protecting myself or are you already a fading memory?

**Home Depot Parking Lot ‚Äì May 20**

I was five minutes early.  
You were ten minutes late.

You used to tell me I overthink things,  
but I know it means something this time.

We both had our notes ready.  
The first ones we've written that aren't about our love.

Yours was polished and folded neatly.  
You always focused on the small details.

I know mine was messy.  
Why does my writing always get worse at the bottom of the page?

Before I left my house that morning I read the one where you wrote that I was the love of your life.  
Are you still breathing?

1kyjpyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1kyjpyu/i_want_to_talk_about_how_the_writing_failed/,I want to talk about how the writing failed Ellie‚Äîbut it‚Äôs so hard to have that conversation right now,"I think the critics of Ellie mostly split into two big groups: **people watching with the game in mind, and people who aren't**. From what I‚Äôve seen, a lot of frustration seems to come from a deep, almost subconscious resistance to change.

When you‚Äôve already experienced a story in such a vivid way by playing the game, it becomes your ‚Äúcanon.‚Äù So even if you didn‚Äôt love every part of the game when it came out, **once the adaptation shifts it, your brain perceives it as wrong.** It feels like something's been taken away or violated.

This is also why I think a lot of the discussion around Ellie not being ‚Äúviolent‚Äù or ‚Äúvengeful‚Äù enough compared to the game (and the comparisons between Bella and Ashley) completely misses the point. It‚Äôs really just revealing that they‚Äôre reacting to a mismatch with the version of Ellie that already exists in their heads.

If this were a brand-new HBO original show, with no game behind it, I still think people would find her character confusing. From Season 1 to now, Ellie‚Äôs behavior and emotional tone have shifted in ways that don‚Äôt feel earned. The issue isn‚Äôt deviation from canon‚Äîit‚Äôs lack of internal coherence.

I‚Äôve played the game, but I‚Äôm not someone who demands a frame-by-frame remake. That said, I fully acknowledge I have a strong mental image of Ellie that‚Äôs shaped by the game. I can‚Äôt claim to be completely unaffected by that, but I try to stay self-aware and not let it cloud my judgment. 

Even if I tried to wipe my memory of the game entirely, I found Season 2 Ellie‚Äôs arc really disappointing. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1kwb4xr/the_writing_made_defending_bella_ramsey_so_much/) articulates a lot of what I‚Äôve been thinking. There are just too many inconsistent moments. IMO, they tried to create these lighter, goofy moments to portray teenage love‚Äîbut it not only makes Ellie feel dumbed down, it also fragments the emotional tone, narrative flow, and her core motivation. 

I'm not saying grief can't coexist with joy‚Äîromance under pressure can absolutely work. We saw it with Ellie and Riley in the mall: their kiss is sweet, but instantly followed by ‚ÄúSo what do we do now?‚Äù It‚Äôs joyful, but grounded in fear and reality. Same with Bill and Frank‚Äîthe strawberry scene is tender and meaningful, showing how even small pleasures hit differently in a ruined world.

But with Ellie and Dina, that emotional layering is gone. They barely acknowledge the trauma Ellie‚Äôs carrying. The tonal whiplash leaves her arc feeling completely disconnected. The show keeps telling us there's depth (mostly through the podcast), but rarely shows it. That‚Äôs where it starts to fall apart.

Another example: the shift in intensity between her confronting Nora and then Owen/Mel felt like two different characters. Both times she‚Äôs pointing a gun, asking ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Abby,‚Äù but the energy, her demeanor‚Äîit‚Äôs so inconsistent. The Nora scene suggests she‚Äôs tapping into a Joel-like violent instinct. But suddenly, with Owen and Mel, her tone is completely dialed down, and we‚Äôre left with no clear emotional trajectory.

And again, it‚Äôs not complex‚Äîit‚Äôs inconsistent.

Some critics have said Bella didn‚Äôt pull it off‚Äîbut as a huge fan of theirs, I don‚Äôt believe for a sec it‚Äôs an issue of acting ability. They‚Äôve proven they can portray deep, complex emotions: the ‚ÄúFuture Days‚Äù moment, the quiet grief in Joel‚Äôs house, the subtle expression when scattering the coffee beans at his grave, the NORA SCENE‚Äîall incredibly nuanced and powerful.

I‚Äôve also tried to take off my fan filter and seriously consider the critiques. I‚Äôve asked myself: could Bella have approached those stupid goofy Seattle scenes differently? Could a shift in tone or delivery have helped? But the more I think about it, the more I feel like the real issue is the writing. **Even if you transplanted Game Ellie into this version, it wouldn‚Äôt fix the problem**‚Äîbecause the foundation just isn‚Äôt there.

All of this speaks to a larger structural issue: Ellie is the protagonist of Season 2. She's supposed to carry the emotional weight of the story. But to do that, a character needs a clear arc‚Äîsomething that answers the basic questions: What does she want? What is she trying to achieve? How is she changing over time?

Ironically, we do get that with Joel in Episode 6. In just one episode, his emotional arc is clearly defined, beautifully executed, and lands with impact. But with Ellie, even up until the moment she‚Äôs begging Abby not to shoot and crying ‚ÄúNo, no, no, no!!!‚Äù, I still couldn‚Äôt tell you what‚Äôs going on in her head.

Good storytelling lets you *feel* a character changing‚Äîthrough their actions, decisions, and how they carry themselves. With Ellie, it‚Äôs all just a blur. ",38,1748546733.0,thelastofus,26,0.77,False

we no longer have him since we got him with accompanying me everywhere in mind, due to my work not allowing him and him eventually washing out, my mom and I no longer had time to keep up with his energy and it led to him being stressed, anxious, and lonely all the time. 

however, while he was still in training before he was ready to go into non pet friendly places, i got a note from my doctor and gave it to my boss, he went to the higher ups and they said our lobby was ‚Äútoo small‚Äù which, it isn‚Äôt. our lobby is huge. like, bigger than most in our city.

1kyjin0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrobiomeHelp/comments/1kyjin0/l_reuteri_yogurt_dos_and_donts_dr_william_davis/,L reuteri Yogurt: Do's and Don'ts - Dr. William Davis,"Making¬†*L. reuteri*¬†yogurt is really a simple process, but it still trips up some people. Or they don‚Äôt understand what we are trying to achieve here, even believing that the benefits we seek can be achieved with conventional yogurt‚Äîno, not even close. Or that methods such as prolonged fermentation are unnecessary. So let‚Äôs list some of the tripping points to help avoid ending up with a liquid mess that fails to yield all the wonderful benefits of this microbe when restored to your microbiome.

I say ‚Äúrestored‚Äù because 96% of people have lost this microbe for a variety of reasons. (Take a look at your bowel flora analysis from Ombre, GI Map, or Gut Zoomer, for instance, to see whether you have¬†*L. reuteri*‚Äîyou likely do not before consuming the yogurt.) Perhaps your mom lost this microbe and was thereby unable to provide it to you via passage through the birth canal and/or breastfeeding, or perhaps you were delivered by C-section and bottle-fed with little opportunity to obtain it. Or perhaps you took a course‚Äîor 5‚Äîof antibiotics for ear infections as a kid. Or you have been exposed to glyphosate that, while an herbicide, is also a potent¬†[antibiotic](https://drdavisinfinitehealth.com/2020/06/glyphosate-the-antibiotic/)¬†that kills off healthy microbial species. There are¬†[many reasons](https://drdavisinfinitehealth.com/2016/12/are-there-raccoons-in-your-garden/)¬†that the modern microbiome has been disrupted in the majority, perhaps all of us.

Recall that we ferment for an extended period of time: 36 hours, not the 6-12 hours of conventional yogurt making.¬†*L. reuteri*¬†doubles (1 microbe becomes 2, 2 becomes 4, 4 becomes 8, etc.) every 3 hours at 100 degrees F. Fermenting for 36 hours therefore permits 12 doublings, rather than the handful of doublings permitted by brief conventional fermentation. This is why we obtain greater than 300 billion CFUs (bacterial counts) per 1/2-cup (120 ml) serving. We also add prebiotic fibers to the fermenting mix to both ensure greater microbial numbers, as well as thicken the end-result.

I have made well over 100 batches without a single failure, so I know that you can do it, too. And, if you join the discussions in our¬†[Undoctored Inner Circle](http://innercircle.undoctored.com/)¬†website, you can add a number of other interesting fermentation projects that achieve effects such as shrinking your waist, deepening sleep, heightening your immune response, accelerating recovery after strenuous exercise, and reducing arthritis pain. You can also find additional ideas and recipes for using other unique microbes in my¬†[*Super Gut*](https://www.amazon.com/Super-Gut-Four-Week-Reprogram-Microbiome/dp/0306846977/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&dib_tag=se&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.tINQMSjuRWD4kiVpliGpCgak3fjRoN6eAdmFi7-tpOee2m46sltIDTuo9W_tNc5aRtb35_VoOwAd9d5UlNuG0d4fLh66bDwX90bgBR7XaZKqq7lvrJPdfKWxj6qYYW0LYDJe0YE6FgJTUUTuG877AGDOYZamZ_utYUKkbzEnd-Or2lvicjum8MqAJginF0SYmtnLm9qTzx0RYW6r3wfBgn7FU9_Vyij1x5CYuPwVzhk.twry7rwTpslqbph2ze908iF1dqeLNDXlLMyZYOjXLos&qid=1735330163&sr=8-1)¬†book.

***L. reuteri***¬†**yogurt-making ‚ÄúDo‚Äôs‚Äù:**¬†

* Do choose dairy with no added ingredients, i.e., no added gellan gum, xanthan gum, carrageenan, etc. as this will cause too much separation into curds and whey.
* Do clean your utensils and jars/bowls with hot soapy water to minimize contaminants. Some people even heat their materials, e.g., in the oven, to kill any contaminants.
* Do begin by making a slurry of a couple tablespoons of yogurt from a prior batch or other source of bacteria (e.g, contents of one¬†[MyReuteri](https://www.oxiceutics.com/products/myreuteri?rfsn=8317336.73404f)¬†or¬†[Gut to Glow](https://www.oxiceutics.com/products/gut-to-glow)¬†capsule), a couple tablespoons of half-and-half or other liquid, 1-2 tablespoons prebiotic fiber; mix well. Only then add the remaining half-and-half. This prevents clumping of the prebiotic fiber.
* Do indeed ferment for 36 hours‚Äîno more, no less. The last 3 hours, for example, doubles the number of microbes, e.g., 150 billion becomes 300 billion‚Äîa considerable jump. Don‚Äôt listen to conventional yogurt makers who confuse what we are doing here with conventional yogurt-making: two very different things. (We are not actually making ‚Äúyogurt‚Äù by the standard FDA definition; we are simply fermenting dairy‚Äîbut it looks and tastes like yogurt so we call it ‚Äúyogurt‚Äù even though it is much more powerful.) Ferment longer than 36 hours and the rate of microbial death begins to exceed the numbers obtained via doublings (likely due to competition for resources) and you can actually obtain¬†*fewer*¬†bacteria. Prolonged fermentation also maximally converts the lactose to lactic acid; people with lactose intolerance can typically eat the yogurt without any adverse effect. The drop in pH to 3.5, not the 10-fold less acidic pH of 4.5 of conventional yogurt, means that the casein beta A1 is at least partially denatured, disabling some of its immune-stimulating potential.
* Do verify the temperature of whatever device you are using to maintain the fermenting temperature, as not all devices are accurate. Also, some devices are pre-set for yogurt making but are set too high; if the device heats to 112 degrees F, for instance, it can kill¬†*L. reuteri*. Ideally, choose a fermenting device (yogurt maker, sous vide device, Instant Pot, etc.) that allows you to vary the temperature, as well as the time.
* Do store your yogurt in the refrigerator where it is generally fine for up to 4 weeks. You can also freeze the yogurt without killing the microbes. (It actually makes a delicious frozen yogurt; here‚Äôs a simple¬†[recipe](https://drdavisinfinitehealth.com/2017/10/chocolate-frozen-yogurt/)¬†for a Chocolate Frozen Yogurt, as shown in the photo above.)
* Do cover your yogurt lightly during fermentation to minimize fungal contamination, e.g., plastic wrap or a loosely-fitting lid.

***L. reuteri***¬†**yogurt-making ‚ÄúDon‚Äôts‚Äù:**

* Don‚Äôt pre-heat. If you choose a pasteurized dairy product, there is no need for pre-heating. Conventional yogurt-makers pre-heat because they typically start with a reduced fat milk and pre-heating improves the texture and mouthfeel of the end-result. We start with half-and-half with around 18% milk fat that yields a wonderful texture and mouthfeel‚Äîno need to pre-heat. The only other time that pre-heating can be helpful is when you obtain a foul and/or severely separated end-result; this suggests that a contaminant has been introduced from the inulin or other prebiotic fiber you used. Pre-heating will therefore kill most contaminating microbes.
* Don‚Äôt be disappointed if the first batch made from probiotic separates; this is typical, something we call the ‚Äúfirst-batch effect.‚Äù It‚Äôs the second and subsequent batches made from some of a prior batch that is more likely to be thick and rich.
* Don‚Äôt stir the mixture while it is fermenting, as this increases separation.
* Don‚Äôt use a blender with your yogurt, as this kills the living microbes. While you may still obtain the oxytocin-provoking effect, you lose¬†*L. reuteri‚Äôs*¬†probiotic properties.
* Don‚Äôt put your fermentation setup near an air vent, as the high volume of air will cause fungal contamination.
* Don‚Äôt heat your end-result, i.e., don‚Äôt heat on a stove or stir into a hot mixture, as this kills the microbes.

I like to pour off the liquid whey after removing some of the curds, as this reduces whey‚Äôs potential to trigger insulin. Even better, filter through a coffee filter or cheesecloth placed into a colander; place the setup into a large bowl or pan and allow the whey to drip out over 4-6 hours, lightly covered. This yields a thicker Greek-style yogurt.

hi. hoping i can get some advice from this sub. i am a 33 year old female, i have been a vegetarian that eats a high fiber diet for almost 20 years. i dont really drink alcohol, no smoking, weigh 120 lbs. i drink at least 120 oz of water daily. yesterday i went to urgent care because i have been having severe cramping around my belly button and under in my stomach. i already know i am constipated. my doctor said i could take miralax daily which i have been for about a month and i am able to have a usually large BM daily. before meeting with my doctor i would take fiber, probiotics, eat prunes, drink prune juice, take stool softeners and senna tabs (didn‚Äôt take consistently due to not wanting to be dependent) and i wouldn‚Äôt have a BM everyday. miralax seemed to work. on saturday i upped my miralax to 1.5 caps, doctor said i could be doing 2 caps a day. I think i was already dehydrated because i was at a concert and then sunday i woke up with the cramping pain. i‚Äôve had gas pain before that is usually in my lower stomach but this felt different and it lasted for 4 days. i kept taking 1 cap of miralax and drinking water but it hurt to eat or drink. i let this ride out a couple days then figured maybe the miralax pulling water from my intestine to help pass stool is dehydrating me or i am not drinking enough especially after doing the 1.5 cap saturday evening. meanwhile i was still having normal not painful BM. so i stopped miralax monday but still having the bad cramping. i went to urgent care yesterday thinking i just needed fluids. they sent me to ER for possible appendicitis ( i knew it wasn‚Äôt). ER offered me morphine and zofran ( i declined knowing both of these cause constipation). i got CT, bloodwork, urine and all they found was stool backed up colon and rectum and fecalization within loops of small bowel no obstruction. since i got home i tried an enema for the first time. i‚Äôm sure it cleared out the rectum but nothing more.  i am back to feeling constipated without the miralax but afraid it will cause that severe cramping? it has since subsided some but honestly think it was to the IV. the ER told me to take senna tabs (already have) and following up with a GI next tuesday but i am not sure what else i can try here or why i would be so constipated in the first place given my diet, water intake, lifestyle and laxative intake. and feeling hopeless how am i ever going to get this out of me. i just took my first dose of linzess today.  hoping it helps, this isn‚Äôt something that will go away with an iced coffee or chia seeds lol. ty in advance.

The early hours of May 29, 2025, saw a flurry of activity in the food sector, with significant developments ranging from consumer trends to price fluctuations on popular appliances. Here's a comprehensive look at the most important happenings.

**Focus on Home Coffee Consumption and Price Sensitivity**

A prominent theme emerging from the food news revolves around the evolving landscape of home coffee consumption and consumer price sensitivity. Online deals are playing a significant role. As evidenced by the Gizmodo Deals segment, a central trend is the increasing interest in high-quality home coffee preparation, driven by both financial and time-saving considerations.

One of the key motivators for consumers is the escalating cost of buying coffee from cafes. The article highlights the significant annual expenses associated with regular barista-made coffee, suggesting that the cumulative cost can be surprisingly high, potentially causing financial discomfort for consumers. This economic pressure is driving consumers to actively explore alternatives.

The primary solution presented by the articles is the purchase of home espresso machines. The fact that the article mentions the Breville espresso machine being on sale at Amazon at a discount below Black Friday price indicates that the demand for home coffee appliances has increased. This suggests a shift in consumer behavior toward a more self-sufficient approach to coffee consumption. The availability of such deals further reinforces the attractiveness of the home-brewing option.

**The Appeal of Home Brewing: Savings, Convenience, and Quality**

The news strongly suggests that consumers are motivated by the promise of significant financial savings. The primary benefit of home brewing is presented as the potential to save ""hundreds a year."" This economic appeal is coupled with the added convenience of preparing coffee at home, which further promotes the adoption of home coffee machines.

The quality aspect of home brewing is implicit in the article‚Äôs discussion of ""coffee from the hands of a barista."" While acknowledging the perceived superiority of barista-made coffee, the article subtly implies that the gap in quality is diminishing with the advent of high-quality home machines. The focus is on the home brewing apparatus, which points to the possibility of replicating professional-grade coffee beverages within the convenience of one‚Äôs own home.

**Economic Factors Driving the Trend**

The news indicates an underlying economic context that is influencing consumer decisions. The rise of at-home coffee preparation can be understood as a response to escalating costs, particularly in the food and beverage sector. The availability of deals indicates an intense competition.

**Concluding Thoughts: A Shift in Coffee Consumption Habits**

The early morning of May 29, 2025, is characterized by a notable trend toward home coffee consumption. The interplay of economic considerations, desire for convenience, and the increasing availability of affordable, high-quality coffee-making appliances is reshaping consumer behavior in the food sector. The articles are an indication that the home coffee machine market is robust. This shift signals a broader consumer movement toward greater control over both their expenses and their daily routines.

For context, I‚Äôve been working on designing and refining a fully 3D printable film camera you can build yourself. It‚Äôs been a long process of testing mechanisms, tweaking the design, and just figuring it out. But it‚Äôs starting to really come together.

I have went back and forth with my managers and here‚Äôs the things

1. This happens every year for a week and they claim that the health department is aware (they have to shut down the steamers for repairs)
2. They are using warm water to clean the dishes (being brewed through large coffee machines and mixing with cold water)
3. They claim that cold water cleans hands just fine.
4. I asked if they were actively telling people that this was going on and they said no.
5. I asked if they‚Äôd personally eat here knowing these things and they hesitated before brushing off the question.

- Queer As Faust XVII Cabaret at House of Music. *The Mickee Faust Club is an arts/activist Community Theater for the Weird Community of Tallahassee, Florida. Chief among those are people with disabilities, crips with attitude, LGBTQ+, Seniors, and those in reduced economic circumstance. The name ‚ÄúMickee Faust‚Äù is a riff on a certain unctuous rodent living in Orlando and Goethe‚Äôs good German doctor whose struggles with the devil mirror the group‚Äôs own. The leader of the Club is Mickee Faust itself, a foul-mouthed, cigar-comping, gender-fluid, sewer rat. In real life, Mickee is played by our founder and artistic director- a deaf, lesbian, performance artist and author, Terry Galloway. For the many decades of its existence, Faust has provided the people of Tallahassee with a non-traditional performance group shaped by the Ethic of Accommodation, an ethic which allows those who are not just under served but overlooked to develop their own artistic voices. Throughout the year, novices and professionals work side-by-side in free, on-going workshops to create original cabarets, theater, radio, video as well as protest and celebratory events. Faust has always been open to anyone in the community who‚Äôd like to participate. Together, the members of the Club promote the presence of their alternative creative voice locally, regionally, nationally and internationally. Many of you may have heard that tornadoes tore off our Clubhouse roof in 2024. But fear not! They haven‚Äôt stopped our creativity. We will still be bringing low brow queer and political humor to various locations through the Capital city. See you in the Sewer!* For show times and registration: https://www.mickeefaust.com/show-list/

1kyj4bi,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1kyj4bi/idk_if_im_about_to_crash_out_or_quit_or_both/,Idk if I‚Äôm about to crash out or quit or both (grande size rant),"My store is one of the busiest ones in my city debatable in my district, but because it‚Äôs the busiest we have a lot to prep and make before our peak and our rushes after peak before 2pm when night shift comes in. Night shift only helps with whip creams and sweet creams bc it‚Äôs all they can handle with cleaning the machines which is 50/50 it‚Äôs not gonna get done, I work opening shifts so I work 4am-12pm/1pm ish I do everything else and I mean everything else. When we open I‚Äôm in charge of calibrating the espresso machines and vertica as well and making sure the espresso machines, cold bar, and food bar have all the equipment they need, after/while I‚Äôm doing that I start making the iced coffees, iced teas, mocha, and chai. By the time I‚Äôm done with all that it‚Äôs time for us to open at 4:30 which usually I have to take all the chairs down and get the head sets ready for the workers clocked in at the moment then unlock the doors and grab the sanitizers for the bars and such. Once we‚Äôre officially open I start working on preps I rotate the whip creams and sweet creams and make sure they‚Äôre in date disposing of the out of date one and making more if needed, then I prep lemonades, refresher bases (which are those big 3.5 gal containers for 4 different liquids), frappe roast, caramel drizzles, and cleaning any of the containers that have gone out of date to refill them as needed. By the time I‚Äôm done with that out 5am worker is there and she usually spends a good 25-30 mins talking to our shift or doing jack shit on top of being 10-15 mins late constantly, she‚Äôs not going to help me so I don‚Äôt bother asking bc every time I did in the past I ‚Äòhad an attitude with her‚Äô so ‚Äòit feels like I‚Äôm talking down to her,‚Äô regardless I‚Äôm used to it so I move on and work on my next set of tasks which is cold brew and restocking the fridges (occasionally this also consists of me having to restock cups and lids and ice bc ‚Äòno one can lift the ice atm‚Äô or ‚Äòthey‚Äôre too busy making drinks‚Äô). Cold brew I love doing problem is, no one cleans in or does it but me so I have to usually clean cold brew before I can even make more most of the time and I make 4-6 cubes each set we make bc we go through at least 3-6 kegs a day, by the time I have started the water for cold brew everything else is done and it‚Äôs just getting the water and starting the 20hr brewing cycle for it, our 6am workers come in usually 1 shift and 1 barista. Bc our tens haven‚Äôt been taken yet I get yelled at for wasting time, for further context I‚Äôm not a shift I‚Äôm a barista the 5am lady is a shift most of the time, so I try to finish the cold brew quickly before I get further yelled at mostly finishing it while taking my 10 min break, once I come back from my 10 I have to restock my food bar, from the bags, oatmeal, pastries, cold food, etc etc. I have brought up to several people that I‚Äôm not doing to greatest and need help occasionally at not only work but with keeping my stability safe bc I‚Äôm stressed out from constantly being the only person to be blamed for everything not done only to mostly either be told I‚Äôm joking, be yelled at, and very rarely (by like 2 or 3 ppl max) actually get help in calming down. Most of my coworkers have personal and medical stuff going on and I understand that better than most of anyone else up there, I‚Äôm going through both myself between personal relationships and situations flipping on me constantly to my body being in chronic pain I have to take medicine to help me function sometimes, I‚Äôm just not sure what to do anymore. I can‚Äôt quit bc I need the insurance and the money, I just want to put myself into an isolation for a little bit and reset everything so it‚Äôs not as bad anymore. And they want the 5am girl to start opening more which is fine I‚Äôm okay with that but if I stop opening then a lot of stuff just isn‚Äôt going to get done and if that‚Äôs what they want then sow what you wish to reap I guess 

Thank you for reading and wasting your time with me I‚Äôve only been at Starbucks for two years and maybe it‚Äôs just my town but man do I wish to go to a different area lol I feel crazy typing all of this out ",2,1748545311.0,starbucksbaristas,0,1.0,False
1kyj3zj,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1kyj3zj/mf_off_the_clock/,[MF] Off the Clock,"The bell jingled as two guys came in‚Äîone in an oversized basketball jersey, the other with his hood half-up, sneakers dragging, eyes wide and restless. That shuffle said either high or looking to be. I gave them a nod and turned back to the counter. Behind me, the slushy machine gave another low, sputtering groan, like it was trying to die and failing. The lights flickered once. Then steadied. No blackout. Just the slow bleed of time.

The guy in the jersey grabbed a Budweiser and a pack of gum. Slapped them down on the counter hard enough to make the glass rattle. He pulled a crumpled five from his pocket and flattened it, like pressure might make it worth more.

I rang it up. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre short,‚Äù I said.

He blinked, like I‚Äôd accused him of something. He didn‚Äôt argue. Just stood there, twitchy, waiting.

I canceled the sale. Bagged the beer and gum anyway. Pushed them across.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it.‚Äù

He looked up, confused. ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, tapping the plastic. ‚ÄúOn the house.‚Äù

He grinned‚Äîrelief more than gratitude. They turned to leave. At the door, Jersey looked back once. ‚ÄúWhen you off?‚Äù

‚ÄúSoon,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúAight.‚Äù He nodded and walked out.

I watched them cross the lot, slipping into a dented Ford Taurus parked crooked near the edge. The engine coughed once, headlights flared, then both died. They didn‚Äôt drive off. Just sat there in the dark, still figures behind the glass.

The clock on the wall ticked forward. The Taurus didn‚Äôt move.

The store settled again. Buzzing lights. The faint click of the cooler cycling. I picked up the rag from beside the register and started wiping the counter‚Äînot because it was dirty, but because it gave my hands something to do.

I‚Äôd done the same thing months back. Hank was with me then. He had his own rag, working the same motion, over the same stretch of glass. Neither of us talked for a long time. There hadn‚Äôt been a customer in over an hour.

He stopped wiping first. Stared down at the counter like it had something worth seeing.

‚ÄúYou ever feel like this is the last place that‚Äôll have you?‚Äù he said.

He wasn‚Äôt looking at me. Just standing there, fists loose around the cloth, voice low and flat.

I didn‚Äôt know how to answer. I shrugged. ‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù

That was it. No follow-up. No smirk or joke. We just stood there, wiping glass that didn‚Äôt need it.

The bell above the door shrieked like it was in pain. Hank.

‚ÄúYoooo, Jay-man,‚Äù he called, dragging it out like he was announcing himself to a crowd. ‚ÄúStill grinding. Look at you. Guy never sleeps.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt look up. Didn‚Äôt need to. I could feel him‚Äîloud, clinging to the air like fryer grease.

He moved behind the counter even though he wasn‚Äôt clocked in. Wore the same sleeveless hoodie with **Rise & Grind** across the front. A Jambox speaker dangled from his hand, still sputtering out music‚Äîtinny, sharp, always just a little too loud.

He tore open a Slim Jim with his teeth, let the wrapper fall somewhere behind the counter. ‚ÄúSmells like ass in here,‚Äù he said, chewing. ‚ÄúCooler leak again? You tell Paul?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt answer.

He leaned a little over the counter, looked past me toward the glass. ‚ÄúYou see that car out there?‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúTaurus. Been parked there a while. Lights off.‚Äù

Hank squinted through the window, gave a lazy shrug. ‚ÄúProbably just sleeping it off. Lotta weirdos out here.‚Äù

He slapped the counter like he was sealing a deal. ‚ÄúMy girl‚Äôs swinging by later. You should see her‚Äîway outta my league. Got a knife tattoo on her thigh. Real classy.‚Äù

I kept my eyes on the door.

The bell chimed again, softer this time.

An older man stepped inside. Coat hanging off him like wet laundry. Hands shaking. He moved slow, steady, straight toward the coffee machine.

He poured himself a cup like it mattered‚Äîlike getting the level right meant something.

Hank watched him with the same tone he used for traffic updates. ‚ÄúBro,‚Äù he said, leaning in a little, ‚Äúyou gotta work hard to crash that hard.‚Äù

I ignored him.

The man shuffled up to the counter. One hand on the cup, the other fishing into a pocket. He set a few coins down, one at a time. Not enough. He knew it.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I think I‚Äôm a little short,‚Äù he said.

I reached for the drawer. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù

Before I could slide it open, Hank stepped in. ‚ÄúStore rules, man. Gotta pay or put it back.‚Äù

The old guy looked at the cup, then at the counter, then down. Didn‚Äôt argue. Just gathered his change and walked out.

The door eased shut behind him.

Hank grabbed the coffee and dumped it in the trash. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt serve it after he touched it,‚Äù he said, wiping his hands on his jeans.

I looked at the cup sinking into the bin. ‚ÄúIt was still good.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúYou let one slide, next guy thinks he‚Äôs owed.‚Äù

The cooler kicked back on with a sharp buzz, and just like that, I was somewhere else.

Months ago. Same store. Different night.

Power had cut out all at once. Lights, register, hum of machines‚Äîgone. The silence hit thick, like someone had closed a door behind us.

We found candles in the back. Lit a couple. Their flicker danced across the counters and coolers, casting shadows that moved when we didn‚Äôt.

Hank dragged out two chairs, sat behind the register like we were kids hiding out after school. Cracked open a Budweiser he hadn‚Äôt paid for.

We didn‚Äôt talk much. Just listened to the soft hiss of melting wax and the low groan of the building adjusting to the dark.

Then, after a long silence: ‚ÄúI used to think I‚Äôd be a vet.‚Äù

He peeled the label off the can in strips. ‚ÄúAnimals. Figured they‚Äôd be easier than people.‚Äù

He almost laughed. ‚ÄúFlunked out my first year. Then my girl got pregnant. Thought that‚Äôd fix it.‚Äù

His fingers tensed. The can collapsed a little in his grip.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt work,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúShe left. Took the kid. I don‚Äôt even know where they are now.‚Äù

He looked at me. Not asking for anything. Just wanted the words to land somewhere.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a bad guy,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ ran outta time.‚Äù

He said it like he‚Äôd rehearsed it. Like he needed it to be true.

I didn‚Äôt say anything. He didn‚Äôt need me to.

Then the lights came buzzing back, hard and bright, like the world remembered we were here.

Hank stood up loud, like the moment never happened.

Hank was back at the cooler, phone in one hand, Monster in the other. He rattled a few cans, let out a laugh‚Äîone of those self-satisfied ones you only do when no one‚Äôs really listening.

Out in the lot, the Taurus shifted again. A door opened. Closed. The shape inside moved, barely.

There was still time.

‚ÄúThree girls blowing up my phone tonight,‚Äù Hank said, pacing as he talked. ‚ÄúGym chick, Speedway cashier, that Tinder one‚Äîfuckin‚Äô uh, full buffet lineup.‚Äù

He chuckled, shook his head like he couldn‚Äôt believe his own luck.

And that was it. Something in me buckled.

‚ÄúJesus Christ, Hank.‚Äù

He stopped. Looked up, not used to being interrupted.

‚ÄúDo you ever shut the fuck up?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúDo you ever stop pretending this is something to be proud of?‚Äù

His grin twitched. Then dropped.

‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôre better than me?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said, voice quiet. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm tired.‚Äù

He squared his shoulders. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just another graveyard lifer. You don‚Äôt even fuckin‚Äô try.‚Äù

‚ÄúBetter than pretending to win.‚Äù

The can in his hand crumpled slightly under his grip.

‚ÄúFuck you,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúClock out and fuck off.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt reply. Just reached under the counter, tapped out on the screen, and peeled my name tag off. Dropped it in the drawer.

No ceremony. Just done.

I grabbed my coat. The zipper caught halfway, like it always did. I didn‚Äôt bother with it.

Didn‚Äôt look at Hank. Didn‚Äôt mention what waited outside. What might already be happening.

I pushed through the door. The bell gave a weak little ding, like it didn‚Äôt want to be responsible.

Cold hit me on the way out‚Äîdidn‚Äôt bite, didn‚Äôt sting. Just settled. A quiet kind of cold.

I crossed the lot. Not fast. Not slow. Just moving.

My breath hung in front of me. Familiar. This was how it had started.

Back during my first week, I‚Äôd stepped out after a long night. Leaned against the brick wall near the entrance. Lighter cupped from the wind.

A minute later, the door opened and Hank came out too. He wasn‚Äôt loud then. Just a guy I barely knew, training me that week.

We stood there, jackets zipped to the chin, our breaths curling in the dark. The lot behind us empty. The highway beyond it humming low.

I offered him a cigarette.

He waved it off. Said he didn‚Äôt smoke.

For a while, neither of us spoke. Then, out of nowhere: ‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt mean the rest of the shift. He meant everything after.

I didn‚Äôt answer. Just took a drag. Let the smoke rise. Then shrugged.

Hank breathed out‚Äîsomething between a sigh and a laugh. He stomped his feet like it might matter. Shoved his hands deeper into his hoodie.

‚ÄúSee you around,‚Äù he said, and walked off toward his car.

I stayed leaning against the wall. Watched the tip of the cigarette burn down to nothing.

That was our first real conversation. If it even counted.

I blinked. The memory dropped away.

My hand was on the car door. Cold metal against my skin. I opened it and slid in. The seat groaned under me.

I didn‚Äôt start the engine.

Through the windshield, the store‚Äôs fluorescent light reached across the lot. Pale and steady.

Inside, Hank moved behind the counter. One hand on his phone. The other rubbing his temple.

The Taurus hadn‚Äôt moved.

I let my shoulders settle. Leaned into the seat. Closed my eyes.

The air in the car held still.

1kyj2od,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1kyj2od/some_advice_that_even_pro_screenwriters_should/,Some advice that even pro screenwriters should heed,"So here's a tip that will make life easier for you, your producers, and the crew on your film/TV show if you're lucky enough to get into production: **LEARN ABOUT CLEARANCES.**

In short, for those of you that don't know, everything that you write, everything that gets created for a production, everything that gets shot, has to go through a Clearance department that makes sure that companies/people/artists/etc aren't going to sue the production for unauthorized use of something. That can be a person's name, a business name, a piece of art, a font... all manner of things. 

So when you write a scene that takes place in your favorite LA coffee shop, with your protagonist dumping an espresso shot into his Diet Pepsi... you've just created work for a bunch of people. Locations now has to see if they can shoot at that coffee shop and use its name/signage. If that's not feasible, production now has to see if the coffee shop will allow them to shoot somewhere else but set it in their coffee shop and allow the Art Dept to recreate their signage. Meanwhile, product placement needs to reach out to see if Pepsi will provide permission/product... if they do, that means that Art Dept and Locations now need to make sure there are no Coke products (or other competitors) visible anywhere else.... 

And all of that is fine if those things are IMPORTANT to your story. But if you just plopped them in there for some specificity and neither matters, then you're better off to just use generic terms. 

Bonus Advice: Give your characters first AND last names. But do a quick google search to make sure someone with that same name and profession doesn't live where your film is set... that disclaimer at the end of the credits only goes so far. If Dr. Rachel Bailey is a Chicago cardiologist that steals organs, you'd better hope that there's not really a real cardiologist named Rachel Bailey in Chicago. Clearance will catch this so it won't be a problem, but it helps to try to stay ahead of it. And if you've only given a character a first name but they work at a lab and will have an ID badge, then Props will need their last name to put on that badge. Or Dr. Bailey will have diplomas and stuff on her wall so if she doesn't have a first name, then the Art Dept will be reaching out to get that name from you (which will then need to go to clearance). Best to just get a jump on these things. 

So that's my advice from 10 years of working in film and dealing with these issues. Happy writing!",28,1748545213.0,Screenwriting,8,0.74,False

I‚Äôm a 27M, originally from India but currently living in the Netherlands, and I‚Äôll be visiting Tirana and Berat from the morning of May 30 to the morning of June 3.

I‚Äôm solo travelling, and for me, the beauty of travel lies in understanding a country‚Äôs culture, not just ticking off sightseeing spots. I love learning about everyday life, food, history, traditions.. what really makes a place what it is.

Wherever I travel, I always wish I had a local friend to show me around or simply talk to over coffee. I don‚Äôt know anyone from Albania (yet!), but I‚Äôve heard such warm things about the people and the hospitality that I booked the trip anyway.

So, if any local has some free time and feels like meeting a curious traveller, I‚Äôd absolutely love to meet up! We could explore, hang out, or just have a nice cultural exchange (you can tell me everything about Albania, and I can share all about Indian and Dutch culture too).

The only plan I‚Äôve made so far is to spend some time in Berat and check out the Osum Canyon. The rest of my trip is flexible and open to ideas.

Even if you can‚Äôt meet up, I‚Äôd truly appreciate any insider tips, food recommendations, hidden gems, or experiences you‚Äôd suggest. It would mean a lot and make my trip even more special!

Thanks in advance and excited to see your beautiful country!",3,1748545190.0,tirana,0,1.0,False

I also work as a delivery driver mon-fri. Here‚Äôs where my problem is, I get muscle cramps and twitches at night on days where I lift heavy at work. Boxes that weight around 60-150lbs each.

Today, I decided to go back to work and try to act like everything was normal. I even stopped by a coffee shop on the way to grab a drink. I thought I was doing okay ‚Äî I wasn‚Äôt crying or anything.
But the woman at the counter looked at me and asked, ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù I said yes. Then she looked at me again and said, ‚ÄúSeriously, are you okay? Do you need help?‚Äù
That‚Äôs when I broke. I left and just started crying.

People I work with often socialize. But she started acting awkward, and another coworker said she had asked for advice about asking someone out - romantically, that is. I had previously indicated to her that I don‚Äôt date women, so I was confused. I decided to go to coffee and leave it at that.

We had coffee and I kept the conversation superficial. If she‚Äôd tried to take things to a more intimate level I‚Äôd have shut it down then. She didn‚Äôt, and I assumed that either I wasn‚Äôt the person she was asking for advice about courting, or she‚Äôd picked up on my disinterest.

But a couple weeks later she started texting me randomly. Just chitchat kinds of things but it felt a bit off. So I answered briefly and never initiated a conversation. Finally I stopped responding.

The next time I saw her at work she looked sad and I feel badly about that, but I‚Äôm not sure how to handle this tactfully.

She seems a little socially awkward and I have sympathy for that, but I don‚Äôt really want to get hit on at work.

Am I being presumptuous here? How would you handle this?",0,1748544975.0,socialskills,3,0.33,False

Who are you...
Youve made your experience, you know who you are, you know what you like and what you need. You crave good communication and its your first step in trying to solve something. You aint a Party person because it doesnt appeal to you, the loud noice, your friends with who youd like to talk to but your voice aint able to scream over the music. The unwanted touches while moving to the beat.

You are able to enjoy the little things more then the biggest suprises. The ready cup of coffee, the Look at you while he things you wouldnt notice. The Grass on your toes. Being able to sit in silence engaged in your own Hobby but still trying to move even an inch closer to each other, finding each other across the room without needing a Word to know that you are enough.

I want us both to be honest, blunt maybe, i want to know you, see you, for that i also want you to know me and see me. I want US to carry each other through sunshine and heavy storms.

Who am I ?
Someone unperfect but maybe the puzzle piece that fits.

1kyiwmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kyiwmf/need_advicehope_onmoving_on_from_a_breakup_read/,need advice/hope on‚Äúmoving on‚Äù from a breakup? read this. (kind of long but things that were helpful to me),"my ex broke up with me after over a year of us being together. i remember thinking why me, i can‚Äôt believe this is happening, how can he do this to me, etc. i felt like there were no signs he was going to do this. we were happy and spent as much time as possible together. i was so integrated into his life and family. how could he do this to me?

but it‚Äôs been a little over 4 weeks since then and honestly it was needed and the best thing to happen to me. i am obviously am still working through my sadness and grief but i can tell this is the best thing for me.

1. BE SAD, experience all your emotions. i cried for a full day the first day and would periodically break out into tears throughout the first week. when i spoke to him again weeks later i cried a whole day at work. think about what happened to you and how you‚Äôre feeling. don‚Äôt worry on trying to feel better yet.
2. LEAN ON YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY. all i did was rant and cry to my friends for 2 weeks straight. i kept asking myself why?? and these why questions are the downfall tbh. your friends will help you make new memories and help you work through things when you‚Äôre sad. it‚Äôs nice to know there‚Äôs people around (your significant other was not the only person in your life)
3. DELETE!! box up their things immediately, it‚Äôll make you sad (lean on a friend/family to help). mute/restrict them on instagram and other social networks. minimally remove their contact photo and location. eventually delete their conversations and contact (it will take time i needed a lot of support for this one). delete photos of them together, if you ever get back together (don‚Äôt hold on to that hope) you‚Äôll make new memories and photos who cares about the old ones. removing him from my life was the biggest thing in helping me heal. focus on yourself and your friends and family. who cares what your significant other is doing!! it‚Äôs hard but this is one of the most necessary and biggest steps. it‚Äôs also super hard to do alone but it helps when friends are around.
4. when you‚Äôre ready, LISTEN TO PODCASTS. podcasts helped me work through my thoughts and emotions (as many of my friends are in committed long term relationships). they can help you find clarity and peace in the situation. i also know it‚Äôs so hard to be in your thoughts right now, podcasts are a great and productive distraction. podcasts i recommend: mel robbin‚Äôs (how to get over a breakup & the truth about relationships especially), jay shetty, emma chamberlain, diary of a ceo
5. GO OUT, DO THINGS! going out with friends and doing things on your own help you rewire your nervous system and replace the time that you would‚Äôve been spending with your significant other. my friends were always down to keep me occupied and when they couldn‚Äôt i went to a coffee shop and did work and even acted as a model for an esthetician class!! it made me find love in the world around me when i felt sad i was losing love. my friends love me and are here for me. the random people i met were so nice and filled with love.
6. DON‚ÄôT BEAT YOURSELF UP FOR BEING SAD & FEELING EMOTIONAL. the emotions come in waves, i am sad for a bit and happy for a while then it goes back to being sad and the cycle starts over again. it‚Äôs ok to be sad. i would beat myself up, why am i not healing yet?? your body is just going through grief and losing someone and rewriting your life to be without them. give yourself grace, feel the sadness and happiness and anger and gratefulness. it‚Äôs better to go through the emotions now then suppress them down and go through them months later.
7. ITS OK TO WANT CLOSURE. it‚Äôs ok to want closure, but know that most likely whatever closure you‚Äôre hoping for won‚Äôt be enough. i wanted closure and weeks later i received it. it made me feel 3% better. your closure will eventually come from within through the self reflection.
8. MAKE NEW OR REMEMBER CONNECTIONS/MEMORIES (that don‚Äôt involve your ex). this was a hard one for me. he was everywhere in my life. music, driving, food, tik tok, reels, i wanted to send anything and everything to him. i wanted to talk to him. that‚Äôs what your friends are for or even journaling. make those new connections. even remember old ones. before your significant other you turned to other people for these things. you have great memories with friends at the same froyo place. go back to those memories and people or make new connections at these places!

these are the things i can think of right now and i hope it can give you hope and direction towards your own healing. this is also a reminder to myself of how far i‚Äôve come!! i‚Äôm still working towards the light at the end of the tunnel but i know it‚Äôs there. if you need support, comment and i‚Äôll try to help. if you need other post break up advice, i want to try to help. i remember feeling so lost and sad and upset. i want to help everyone feel hopeful that you will heal and it‚Äôll pass!!! 

i hope this was helpful to at least one person :)

1kyit7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kyit7j/aitah_for_calling_out_my_grandma_for_destroying/,AITAH for calling out my grandma for destroying my garden for the third time,"Alright so a quick background. about 2-3 ish years ago around the time when me and my family had recently moved into our new house (I was like 16 at the time and our grandma had moved into with us) I had really wanted to make a food garden in our back yard and the patio was pretty decent sized, enough to have a good amount of vegetables. My mom was on board with the idea and let me go ahead and invest in the project. With the help of my dad, I spent a lot of money and hard work on building a patio garden with about 10-15 different types of fruits and vegetables. within some months I was getting consistent harvests and producing a good amount of food. There was a ton of trial and error of course, but, considering the fact that I didn‚Äôt have prior experience at the time it was decent, and I was really proud of it. It became a hobby that I loved and could tend to all the time because I‚Äôm homeschooled anyways.

So here‚Äôs where the problem began. My grandma really liked the garden too. She would pick stuff before it was ready to harvest and over water things sometimes. I didn‚Äôt say anything or make too much of a big deal about it because the garden was fine. She had offered to buy more things for the garden so we could upgrade it together, there were fruits and vegetables she wanted to add on so I didn‚Äôt see a problem at all! She took me to the store and we worked on planting new seedlings, rotating other plants around, transferring the plants to new pots, etc.. well she ended up paying a pretty penny on all of that stuff so I had to go ahead and share the garden with her and it was both of ours at this point, which I didn‚Äôt mind. 

Over time my garden got worse and worse. She would see those AI facebook videos saying bs like ‚Äúput a banana peel and peanut butter in the soil for a bountiful tomato harvest‚Äù or something crazy like that. She would do things like dump cinnamon and cayenne pepper EVERYWHERE thinking it was some sort of fertilizer. I would come outside and see moldy strawberries, carrot shavings, instant coffee, egg shells, banana peels, and all kinds of stuff right on top of and underneath the soil of all my plants. If she ate an apple she‚Äôd put the core in the pot same with literally almost everything she ate. She also over watered EVERYTHING and picked all of my fruits and vegetables before they were even close to being ready to come off the vine. Eventually the garden was infested with bugs and mold. She refused to throw anything away, even if a plant was dead and had root rot she‚Äôd flip out if I tried to toss it, also using the infested soil to plant new seedlings.

And god forbid I said anything or took the crap out the pots, then I was being disrespectful, ungrateful and rude according to my parents. I couldn‚Äôt say anything because technically it was both of our and she paid a lot for it. I wasn‚Äôt always there to monitor it because i started dual enrollment at this time. eventually the garden started looking a mess and i lost hope in trying to get through to her. My parents even started to see how bad she was ruining the garden. She‚Äôd have plants in her room and put the old food in it, eventually causing a black mold problem but that‚Äôs a whole other story. The problem is I wasn‚Äôt allowed to say ANYTHING. I couldn‚Äôt express any discontent or even try to reorganize the garden because they said I was being disrespectful every single time. My mom eventually got mad at me because out patio had turned into a tacky mess and my grandma blamed it on the weather or whatever. She threatened to not allow me to tent to the garden any longer if I didn‚Äôt make it look better.

 So I spent around 200 ish dollars trying my best to salvage the garden and buy new shelves, storage, supplies, and replace what plants I was allowed. I spent hours power washing and scrubbing the mold off the patio and repotting what I could. By this time the garden wasn‚Äôt producing much of anything anymore, but when I fixed it up it looked very nice actually, and I was able to revive some plants and start producing fruit again. Well that was useless because the same thing happened TWO MORE TIMES!! she ruined the garden, my mom got pissed, I paid money to fix it, she ruins it again. Well now today I‚Äôm 18 and about to leave for college and I‚Äôve been given up on the garden. She refuses to throw away the old plants still and never even waters it. When the tomato plant looks like it might start flowering again she picks it off while it‚Äôs small and green and lets it rot on the kitchen counter. 

Well I guess my dad felt bad so he got me a small greenhouse and said I could start over if I liked and he‚Äôd toss the old plants. Of course my grandma saw and now she wanted to take over the green house and plant more stuff. Long story short I called her out for destroying my garden every time and she got pissed so did my mom for opening my mouth now my mom is telling my dad to use my green house to put the old dead plants in to appease my grandma. I get the whole respect your elders thing because they‚Äôre extremely adamant about that to the point where they‚Äôll walk on eggshells to appease their parents and just tell me to suck it up.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Edit: nope she doesn‚Äôt have any mental illness or anything like that she‚Äôs actually pretty young to be a grandparent since my family has this thing of having kids superrr young. She‚Äôs just like that idk why at this point",3,1748544586.0,AITAH,3,0.8,False

Some notable plot points and summary:

* The employee of the coffee shop is a non-binary person, whose original gender was female but they present as male
* The owner of the coffee shop is a handsome guy who is quiet and has some mental issues because he feels like he's missing something in life
* There's other characters but they all end up hanging out at the coffee shop most of the time
* The coffee shop owner ends going backpacking and finds his twin/clone living in a mountain cave and he tries to bring them home with him
* At the end, the owner ends up dying because he was trying to save his twin or commit s\*\*cide (I can't remember why and how but something along those lines)

Hey! I‚Äôm 26 years old. You must be over 18 to message me. I write equally in 1st person and 3rd person so it‚Äôs up to you for which POV you want to write in. I am in the CST timezone. I don‚Äôt mind what timezone you are in, I just know that some people like knowing. I try to get a few replies per day in. My writing length can vary from 1 long paragraph to 5 medium length paragraphs depending on what‚Äôs needed at that time. I‚Äôve been roleplaying since the pandemic so about 5 years now. I have a few prompts down below that I hope you‚Äôre intrigued by! If you reach out, just lmk which prompt you like the best. I‚Äôm also willing to make changes to the prompts or hear any prompts you may have!

Tennis player x influencer
She is used to the social media fame and glory. Everything that comes with millions of followers and brand deals. Having every aspect of her life dissected online. That‚Äôs what happens when you‚Äôre a 20 something year old female influencer online. He isused to none of that. He is a tennis star, sure. But he doesn‚Äôt even have any social media to be online looking at what people are saying about him. The closest he has is watching the ESPN type shows when they get around to tennis. His whole life is practice courts, early mornings, and trying to stay out of the spotlight outside of his play on the court. They seem to be very happy. That is until the paparazzi catches them going to a fancy restaurant together and dating rumors start.

Hockey player x basketball player
She is the rookie of the year in the WNBA. He has played a few years in the NHL. They both play for the same city. This culminates in them meeting court-side at one of her games. As the face of each of their teams, they were bound to meet at some point. They exchanged phone numbers. This leads to late night phone calls, and texts throughout the day. Neither of them expected it to turn as serious as it did as quickly as it did. They are the face of sports in their city.

Country Singer x pop singer
They grew up together in a small town. They played music whenever they could: in one of their bedrooms, at festivals, at school, etc. she was the girl with a massive voice. She always performed at talent shows and dreamt of playing in front of big crowds in the big city. He was the guy with the guitar writing and singing songs about their small towns and his truck. But life pulled them in opposite directions. He stayed in their town to pursue a career in country music. She left for a career in pop music. They naturally drifted apart until years later, they didn‚Äôt talk to each other at all. They both still missed each other. That was until she heard a song of his on the radio about her.

Tennis player x singer
They had been friends since they met in kindergarten. He could always be found with a tennis ball in his hand. She with her notebook. They knew what they wanted in terms of their interests. They fully supported each other‚Äôs dreams. They were inseparable. Most people knew that if they saw one of them, the other wouldn‚Äôt be far behind. A few years ago, they went from friends to lovers when they were each other‚Äôs New Year‚Äôs Eve kiss. A moment so magical they knew they couldn‚Äôt return to just being friends. Now that they were dating, they realized it came with ups and downs. Their schedules didn‚Äôt always line up. When they were together, there were times that they were thinking about other things.

Sports Medicine Doctor x Pro Athlete
He‚Äôs a star tennis player coming off a career-threatening injury. She‚Äôs the new sports therapist on his team‚Äîcalm, collected, and unwilling to get personally involved with clients. But as the sessions pile up and she sees him fight for his comeback, lines begin to blur. Both are guarded. Both have secrets. And both start to realize healing can come in more forms than one.

YouTuber x Tiktoker
He‚Äôs a laid-back YouTuber who reviews outdoor hockey rinks‚Äîponds, parks, backyard setups‚Äîkeeping it real and all about the game. She‚Äôs a big-time TikToker known for lifestyle content: coffee montages, outfit hauls, relatable humor. They meet by chance at a small-town rink‚Äîhe‚Äôs filming a review, she‚Äôs there for a winter aesthetic vlog. At first, they clash: she‚Äôs never watched a hockey game, and he doesn‚Äôt get TikTok trends. But their accidental collab goes viral, and fans love the banter. Now they‚Äôre skating into each other‚Äôs worlds‚Äîand maybe into something real.

I work as a research scientist, so I can work when I have free time but my boundaries are; don't bother me tuesdays and thursdays ( she works m/w/f/s ). We have 2 kids 3M/4F and I'm not even mad that I can spend every day with them. Every day I teach them to read/write/colour, go on trail walks, go kayaking, play sports, coach their soccer team, take them to get coffee/juice, teach them about animals, trees, watch bill nye and mickey mouse. For me, I always sneak in an hour of work when they nap or watch an afternoon movie, but generally, I redirect their energy pretty well and all is good. When mom comes home, its always  complete chaos and axiety projection. Before the wife leaves in the morning, she can never leave without there being an issue, won't swap vehicles, always forgets something and always gets ready last minute. Like I said, Tue/Thur are my get shit done days, yet after I leave, I get bombarded with texts and calls, something always breaks, doesnt work etc. Today, for some reason my son yanked the curtain rod, the tape on the dryer vent pipe stopped sticking etc. I've gotten to the point where I've removed her from all social media/ call / text because when she's overwhelemd, it gets excessive( 20 + calls and texts). I could WFH, but when I do, the problems balloon. I told her, she has to be more self reliant and little screws/ quick fixes and tidying the house should not be an issue. Since I finished my work a bit early, I picked up repair supplies, came home and started fixing shit. While I'm fixing things, shes talking my ear off about how I'm useless, do nothing, don't work and shouldn't be home and that I'm not allowed to work at home ( we have an office at home ). I step off the ladder, and i guess, she left a dirty diaper on the ground ( when she changes diapers she just lets them sit on the ground sometimes up to 3 days if I dont notice), and I look around and theres nothing but toys everywhere, the table is filthy etc. I get having kids the house wont be clean, but... AITH for telling her to be a better mom, redirect their energy and to treat me with a bit more respect? -- It seems women always come up with excuses not to be accountable when they know they have someone they can rely on. Like hell, when she's at work I don't call, text or anything. I do dinner, laundry put toys away and make her a plate and say nothing. Also, out of a given week, she always has to call her unemployed adult child 450 lb sister that eats everything( That we both hate bc shes a terrible influence) to help her for the 1/2 of the days. I feel its a bit unfair/ un needed for a mom to require help for 1/2 days a week, when the classic ""baby sitting dad"" can do it all the other 5 days by myself (1 of the 2 kids is paraplegic)....

Note: I'm a scientest that does expeditions and conferences 2-4 times a year(obivously I pay for extended child care, grand parents etc..I dont ditch her), and she always seems to be better when I return from work trips. Its like me being half a planet away makes her not have me at her beck and call.... Should I just toss my phone at this point lol?",0,1748544401.0,AITH,109,0.45,False

The Kelowna to Toronto flight was scheduled to depart at 11:30 pm but we got a text at 6:30 pm telling us the flight was canceled due to unscheduled maintenance and rebooked for 24 hours later. We were automatically sent $120 in food vouchers and the option to choose a nearby hotel overnight.

We called Westjet but were put on hold so we decided to go to the airport. When we talked to the Westjet counter at the airport, we were told they were 3rd party employees so could not assist with booking. As we considered our options, we finally connected with Westjet on the phone; the time was 8:05 pm. We asked to fly to Vancouver tonight so we can catch a flight from Vancouver to Cancun next morning. The agent said the only flight available departs at 8:45 pm so we really need to run, and boy did we run. We checked in, got our boarding passes, passed through security, and arrived at the gate by 8:25 pm. The incredible Westjet employee stayed on the phone with us the whole time to make sure we caught our flight.

Once we got to YVR, we went to the Westjet counter to request a hotel room for the night according to CTA rules. The friendly Westjet employee at YVR gave us a room and more meal vouchers without difficulty. She even confirmed that the hotel offers free shuttles or else she would give us taxi vouchers. Next morning we caught our flight to Cancun, but not before spending $60 on 2 avocado toasts and buying other people coffee and food with our vouchers.

We were booked on premium round trip. Even with the shenanigans, we still got to fly premium albeit in the swoop planes. We got $100 automatically in credits into our account. The service on board was excellent. The flight attendant on our return flight from Cancun to Vancouver was especially awesome. She was lighthearted and friendly... a perfect end to our trip even thought the beginning was stressful.

Westjet employees are often on the receiving end of people's frustration even though they had nothing to do with delays/cancelations. Thank you to the people we encountered for staying friendly, positive, and helpful. ",12,1748544270.0,westjet,1,1.0,False

1kyinry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1kyinry/i_had_the_more_mysterious_and_confuse_dream_in_my/,I had the more mysterious and confuse dream in my life,"**Warning : self depractation, suicide.**  
  
I've tried all the day to thing about my dream and what it might mean, and I don't have a clue, usually when it's happen, i just brush the dream off, but this one feels too strangely specific and with elements that seems  possible to analyse, but I wasn't able to do it, so i'm here to ask for help.  
Before talking about the dream I guess I should talk about me, i'm not very good at it but I will try my best.

I'm a French boy of 18yo, I live with my mother and two of my sisters in a village. I'm not close at all of my sisters, we nearly not talk outside of lunch, but I don't hate them neither, even if both of them are often pretty annoying. I'm at the twelfth grade, about to be pass my exam before getting graduated. I have a long distance girlfriend since a year and half, and everything going more or less good, I feel like there is problem but maybe not, you will understand at the end of this part i'm sorry. I have few friends, two I would say,  also all in long distance.  
Recently i'm stressed because of the college (i think it's how you talk about greater school after graduation) , i initially wanted to just not go to it, but it just feels unavoidable. I don't have any passion or job i would like to do so it's even harder to choose anything, and I know it will not be for me at all since I have an motivation issue with nearly everything. Less recently but still relevant, my parents got divorced like two or three years ago, it's why i live with just my mother now, and I don't see my father anymore (he was a manipulative bastard in short).   
I've been wanting to kill myself for ten years (it's relevant for the dream, i promise) with the only year of interruption in this time being the first years with my gf. I recently make a plan for it that involve jumping but i've got stopped by a friend who told me that if i do it, she will do it too.   
the more recent event that is relevant for the dream, is that I was talking with one of my friend, who is also the best friend of my gf, and she told me that I don't understand human interaction and meaning behind other words or actions (in the context it was explicitly about my gf) and I overthink it as a confirmation that I'm the only problem in my relationship with my gf, that everything was in my head, and that i'm an human error. I always told myself that but it hit hard to have someone telling it to front face, and the night before my dream I was crying on it once more (it's been like two weeks and a half).

  
  
So now the context of my dream it self (it's short i promise)   
My mother was taking my sister at a scout camp, they needed to go at 5 am, so I wake up at the same time. Around 8am i was on my phone, lying on my bed and suddenly the dream happen, it's not the first time I fall asleep during the day but usually I yawn before or feel it, this time no sign.

So now, my dream :

The dream start and I'm in the same position as before sleeping. Lying on my bed with my phone in my hands. 

During two or three cycles, I can just move my fingers enough to push the screen on my phone against the bed or turn it off, those cycles cut by me closing my eyes long enough, like if I was falling asleep once more.

Then strange things start, I finaly know what my room look likes without having to look at it, but only part of it. The wall which the head of my bed is against, on the right of it, have, on it's left, a big hole. I'm not able to see (or whatever it's called) through it unfortunately. On the bottom on the wall, in a sort of band there is word written in blue of different size. They are kinda written like tag on the street, I can just remember than one of them start with an Y and is rather short, like 5 to 8 letters. During this cycle, i'm able to know that my phone show 0h00 but I knew it's not possible since it's 8am the last time I checked, for some reason I don't understand it's a dream and is thinking to myself if I shall ask a friend that have already had hallucination if it's one of them, I think i'm still not able to move.

Then on the next cycle,there is a voice saying that pain growls are divinity and we should worship it too, not just moans, during this time, i feel like i'm trying to crawl out of my bed but the cycle cut before i'm able to.

On this cycle, i'm standing, I don't even know if I'm somewhere, i just remember my father's parents (i don't know how to talk about my grandparents from my father family branch in another way, i'm sorry) telling to us ( i don't know who was with me, probably my sisters) that we did the good choice to choose him, because his boss told him to work but there is already Paul (i don't know any Paul) who do it. I don't have the time to think about it because this cycle cut instantly

In this cycle, i feel like I begin in the room in which I was lying on the bed before, but i'm being quickly teleported to an unknown room in which my mother is sleeping on a big mattress, at her feet there is 3 gift packed in gift wrap exactly the same. In front of me there is a door. I feel like i can control myself and go to the door and open here. I don't remember walking, but it don't feels like I've been teleported, rather like if I've lost memory of walking and opening the door.   
On the other side of the door I can see on my right my younger sister sleeping and on my left a window. I  feel like the only way out of the dream is to jump from the window, which make some sense. As I decide to walk to the window, i'm once more already there, but this time as I climb the window ledge, I see myself from a third pov, like if since the beginning i'm not the one controlling myself like I was thinking. Oh and the window disappear, like i don't need to open or break it.   
The moment I jump I can see two things. First my dad against the wall, on a little ledge like link in wind waker hd game, and the second thing it the arm of someone who definitively don't look like my dad or my sister, coming from the room to catch my leg. The room is totally dark now so i can't see it, but it miss me.   
The Fall is quite long, I'm able to move my head first to be sure to die and close my eyes. As i close my eyes, I see or imagine, me falling on the ground and some liquid as yellow as the yellow of eggs, flowing from my head as I touch the ground and a crow passing above it, or on the ground next to my body, pecking the ground, i don't remember but i know it's there. All this little scene is in black, except from the liquid and the eye of the crow, it's iris is in black too, I can also see some empty chairs and table typical of coffee around where I imagine my fall.   
As I see all that, a second later, everything go dark and I'm pretty sure it means I touched the ground and died. A dozen of seconds pass by before I wake up irl in an inspiration of surprise/panic ?   
As I look at the clock of the phone who is in my hands like at the beginning of my dream, I've slept only 20 minutes.

1kyinqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1kyinqi/need_advicehope_onmoving_on_read_this_kind_of/,need advice/hope on‚Äúmoving on‚Äù? read this. (kind of long but things that were helpful to me),"my ex broke up with me after over a year of us being together. i remember thinking why me, i can‚Äôt believe this is happening, how can he do this to me, etc. i felt like there were no signs he was going to do this. we were happy and spent as much time as possible together. i was so integrated into his life and family. how could he do this to me?

but it‚Äôs been a little over 4 weeks since then and honestly it was needed and the best thing to happen to me. i am obviously am still working through my sadness and grief but i can tell this is the best thing for me.

1. BE SAD, experience all your emotions. i cried for a full day the first day and would periodically break out into tears throughout the first week. when i spoke to him again weeks later i cried a whole day at work. think about what happened to you and how you‚Äôre feeling. don‚Äôt worry on trying to feel better yet.
2. LEAN ON YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY. all i did was rant and cry to my friends for 2 weeks straight. i kept asking myself why?? and these why questions are the downfall tbh. your friends will help you make new memories and help you work through things when you‚Äôre sad. it‚Äôs nice to know there‚Äôs people around (your significant other was not the only person in your life)
3. DELETE!! box up their things immediately, it‚Äôll make you sad (lean on a friend/family to help). mute/restrict them on instagram and other social networks. minimally remove their contact photo and location. eventually delete their conversations and contact (it will take time i needed a lot of support for this one). delete photos of them together, if you ever get back together (don‚Äôt hold on to that hope) you‚Äôll make new memories and photos who cares about the old ones. removing him from my life was the biggest thing in helping me heal. focus on yourself and your friends and family. who cares what your significant other is doing!! it‚Äôs hard but this is one of the most necessary and biggest steps. it‚Äôs also super hard to do alone but it helps when friends are around.
4. when you‚Äôre ready, LISTEN TO PODCASTS. podcasts helped me work through my thoughts and emotions (as many of my friends are in committed long term relationships). they can help you find clarity and peace in the situation. i also know it‚Äôs so hard to be in your thoughts right now, podcasts are a great and productive distraction. podcasts i recommend: mel robbin‚Äôs (how to get over a breakup & the truth about relationships especially), jay shetty, emma chamberlain, diary of a ceo
5. GO OUT, DO THINGS! going out with friends and doing things on your own help you rewire your nervous system and replace the time that you would‚Äôve been spending with your significant other. my friends were always down to keep me occupied and when they couldn‚Äôt i went to a coffee shop and did work and even acted as a model for an esthetician class!! it made me find love in the world around me when i felt sad i was losing love. my friends love me and are here for me. the random people i met were so nice and filled with love.
6. DON‚ÄôT BEAT YOURSELF UP FOR BEING SAD & FEELING EMOTIONAL. the emotions come in waves, i am sad for a bit and happy for a while then it goes back to being sad and the cycle starts over again. it‚Äôs ok to be sad. i would beat myself up, why am i not healing yet?? your body is just going through grief and losing someone and rewriting your life to be without them. give yourself grace, feel the sadness and happiness and anger and gratefulness. it‚Äôs better to go through the emotions now then suppress them down and go through them months later.
7. ITS OK TO WANT CLOSURE. it‚Äôs ok to want closure, but know that most likely whatever closure you‚Äôre hoping for won‚Äôt be enough. i wanted closure and weeks later i received it. it made me feel 3% better. your closure will eventually come from within through the self reflection.
8. MAKE NEW OR REMEMBER CONNECTIONS/MEMORIES (that don‚Äôt involve your ex). this was a hard one for me. he was everywhere in my life. music, driving, food, tik tok, reels, i wanted to send anything and everything to him. i wanted to talk to him. that‚Äôs what your friends are for or even journaling. make those new connections. even remember old ones. before your significant other you turned to other people for these things. you have great memories with friends at the same froyo place. go back to those memories and people or make new connections at these places!

these are the things i can think of right now and i hope it can give you hope and direction towards your own healing. this is also a reminder to myself of how far i‚Äôve come!! i‚Äôm still working towards the light at the end of the tunnel but i know it‚Äôs there. if you need support, comment and i‚Äôll try to help. if you need other post break up advice, i want to try to help. i remember feeling so lost and sad and upset. i want to help everyone feel hopeful that you will heal and it‚Äôll pass!!! 

i hope this was helpful to at least one person :)

It‚Äôs about my dad. He wasn't a man of many words, but his presence was a constant. A quiet strength, a comforting silence. We had our routines ‚Äì Saturday morning coffee, tinkering in the garage, watching cricket matches where neither of us said much, but we understood each other.
Then life got busy, as it always does. Work, relationships, moving to another city. The calls became shorter, the visits less frequent. I told myself it was fine, we'd always have time. There'd always be another weekend, another holiday.
The last time I saw him, it was a quick stop. I was rushing to catch a flight, just popped in to say a hurried goodbye. He was sitting in his armchair, reading the newspaper, a half-smile on his face as I walked in. I remember vaguely saying something about calling him when I landed, giving him a quick, almost dismissive pat on the shoulder. I was already halfway out the door, my mind on my travel plans.
He just nodded, a slight tilt of his head, and that familiar, soft ""Okay, son. Drive safe.""
Those were his last words to me.
He passed away unexpectedly a few days later. A sudden heart attack. I got the call in the middle of the night, thousands of miles away. The world just‚Ä¶ stopped.
And now, every single day, that moment replays in my head. That fleeting, rushed goodbye. The fact that I didn‚Äôt stop for another five minutes. That I didn‚Äôt hug him properly, look him in the eye, or tell him I loved him. That I prioritized a flight over what would be our final interaction.
The ""what ifs"" are a constant ache. What if I had lingered a little longer? What if I had truly connected with him in that moment? What if I had given him the goodbye he deserved, and I deserved?
It‚Äôs the deepest regret of my life, a wound that refuses to heal. The silence of his absence is deafening, filled only by the echo of that unsaid farewell.

I hope someone can help me understand and maybe even give me advice on how to deal with my partner's sister.

I 42F have been with my partner 53M for almost 20 years. During this time his sister51F/family have not warmed up to me. It has been a struggle that has resulted in mostly distance/excluding me/boundaries. It's is far from ideal, but we try to make it work. I would like my partner to have a better relationship with his family, but I have, over the years also grown to accept that they are not interested in that to include me. So, I have learned stand up for myself and explain to him that I want to feel supported too, so we are working together now on boundaries and hard limits for his family. In that regard, we've had another stern conversation with his sister, during which I learned a few things that have just left me baffled, and which I hope someone can help me understand.

My partner has had 2 relationships before we met, aka he has had a life. The second(!) relationship, the one before we met, got quite serious, ended in a divorce after barely being married for a 1.5 years. When we met, his family struggled with his divorce, explaining it as his failure, although the b cheated on him and was already pregnant with that affair partner just a few months after breaking up.

That ex2 was the reason for our last sit down with SIL. The ex2 had, through her kids, come back into the life of SIL and her kids. Kids went to the same school and even became friends and visit each other at home. SIL had not bothered to tell us about it for 3 years!!! It was only told recently, to my partner, casually in a restaurant, with the kids present. The sister claims to dislike the ex2 now, but does mention that they have chit chat conversations which are apparently friendly enough that the ex2 asked the sister to go for coffee. I personally would not ask anyone to go for something as simple as coffee even, if there wasn't enough friendliness in the conversation. But she thinks this is about her feelings for the ex, not about her lack of feelings for her own brother and his life partner.

I'm not writing this because SIL's lack of compassion towards me troubles me, frankly I'm totally over trying to get his sister to have a loving relationship with me. After all this time, I'm really only in this thing for him. We mainly had the sit down with her to try and establish some boundaries and to get her to finally, after all these years, understand that we, both my partner and me, want to feel secure about dealings with the ex2. SIL felt a 3 year omission is not lying, we did not even get around to the insensitivity of the way my partner eventually did get informed. And she of course thought we were making a mountain out of a molehill. But with her lack of consideration, who is to say that we do not end up without warning sitting next to ex2 at the birthday of one of his nephews, we also do not care to have his nephews be put in the middle by ex2 or to have ex2 get updates about our personal lives through them or SIL. It has already proven to be uncomfortable, as ex2 has asked his nephews explicitly about their uncle and one of his nephews (who is now aware of the divorce) now has striken up conversations about his ex2, unexpectedly and definitely unwanted (they have parted ways for over 20 years ago, before those kids even existed and my partner does not care to relive the hurt it caused him).

It is beyond me that this is something we even need to explain... which we have for close to 20 years with a lot of push back, so much so that we are still needing to talk about it 20 years later... It can't be that weird that we want to finally feel her support.

I thought it was normal that as a family you choose your family and you axe the ex, unless there would be kids involved. Since they had no kids, they were married only briefly, they were young and obviously not well matched, there is no reason to be more than polite.

Okay, so maybe it was just because the SIL kids and the ex kids are now friends... but... Aside SIL's history of being very distant towards me as the 'new' partner and extremely inconsiderate about the whole ex2 situations since we began dating... during this last conversation, I actually learned that this has not been the first time.

The first(!) relationship my partner had was during his teenage years. They dated for a few years. She also cheated on him and they broke up... but SIL remained friends with that ex1, so much so that SIL had planned to be a bridesmaid for that ex1. The family or groom of ex1 ended up feeling awkward about it so SIL got demoted to regular wedding guest. But the demotion was not due to any awkward feelings on her part. And no SIL was not friends with ex1 before my partner and ex1 got together.

SIL claims that it was during ex1's wedding that she learned that Ex1's relationship with my partner and her affair with whom ex1 was now getting married had overlapped. Supposedly, that was the point where she stopped being friends with ex1. Not the fact that the relationship had ended, not the years after, not the fact that being a bridesmaid to ex1 would be weird, not the fact that her brother was not made of stone and just because he did not speak about it, did not mean he had no hurt feelings.

In other words, long story short, SIL seems to have a pattern of staying friends with/befriending my partner's exes. Even though they have treated him badly. I would not even stay friends with the ex of a friend, especially not when it has ended badly. There's too many other people in the world to need to be friends with that one particular person. Both partner and SIL say that she never was very close with both exes. So why on earth is she doing this?

My partner is the kind that does not show what hurts him, he'll avoid and go low contact. SIL has never expressed any sympathy for him or his situation. As mentioned, the departure of ex2 was even put on his not working hard enough on the relationship, even though she was cheating on him, she was pregnant with that guy's kid, and she bled my partner dry for every penny she could long after.

Initially I was unpleasantly surprised by the lack of support from his family, and so much of it got directed at me. His family, including SIL, have multiple times blamed me for him going LC. Which is so far from the truth. I don't demand credit, I do stuff for him, not for them, so I support him, but they don't always know what indirect effort I do put in, but even when they do know they ignore it.

I have NC with my own family, I would not wish that on anyone, especially not the love of my life, so it is beyond ridiculous. Having been with him during the post-divorce period, I know that it was their responses and lack of support that made him go in a different direction. His relationship with his SIL is always a bit of a one way street, but this whole ex-thing feels like a basic thing of love and respect.

And he really is not the reason for that break up. I know he tries so hard to make everyone happy, especially the person he loves. He's as close to perfection as possible. So they really don't have any cause to hold him responsible for the divorce.

For 20 years I've been working at this like there's something wrong with me, I realize now its not on me, but I'm still so confused as to why his SIL be like this. Someone please explain it to me, like I'm a child, cause clearly I need it.",1,1748543993.0,relationship_advice,1,0.99,False

Sugar substitutes are everywhere‚Äîfrom that packet of sweetener you drop into your coffee to the ""zero sugar"" sodas at your local store. They‚Äôve become a staple for people looking to reduce calories, manage health conditions like diabetes, or merely cut back on sugar intake. But are these substitutes as good (or bad) as people claim?

# What Are Sugar Substitutes?

Before debunking misconceptions, it‚Äôs essential to understand what sugar substitutes are. They are ingredients used to replace sugar in food and drinks while still providing sweetness. These substitutes can fall into two categories:

1. **Artificial Sweeteners** like aspartame, saccharin, and sucralose.

1. **Natural Sweeteners** like stevia, monk fruit extract, and erythritol.

Many sugar substitutes are intensely sweeter than regular sugar, making it possible to use smaller quantities to achieve the same sweetness.

# The Top Sugar Substitute Myths, Debunked

**Myth 1: Sugar Substitutes Are Dangerous**

There‚Äôs a widely held belief that all sugar substitutes are harmful to your health. This claim often surrounds artificial sweeteners like aspartame or sucralose, citing risks such as cancer or other long-term diseases.

**The Facts**

Scientific studies conducted over several decades have consistently found that sugar substitutes approved by the FDA are safe for consumption. For example:

* **Aspartame** has been declared safe by over 90 regulatory agencies, including the FDA, WHO, and EFSA. Still, individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU) should avoid aspartame as they cannot metabolize it.

* **Sucralose** is approved by the FDA and has undergone over 110 safety studies without showing causation for serious health conditions.

Verdict? Sugar substitutes aren't harmful when consumed within recommended levels.

**Myth 2: Natural Sweeteners Are Always Better**

A common assumption is that natural alternatives to artificial sweeteners are inherently safer or healthier. After all, ""natural"" sounds better, right?

**The Facts**

Not all natural sweeteners are created equal. While some, like stevia and monk fruit extract, come with added antioxidant benefits, others like agave syrup can be just as high in fructose as regular sugar, contributing to weight gain and liver issues when overconsumed.

Don‚Äôt fall for the ""natural equals healthy"" bias. It‚Äôs more important to check how any sweetener affects your overall caloric intake and personal health.

**Myth 3: Sugar Substitutes Cause Weight Gain**

Some skeptics argue that sugar substitutes trick your body into craving more sweet, calorie-dense foods, ultimately leading to overeating and weight gain.

**The Facts**

While early animal studies found potential links between sugar substitutes and increased appetite, more recent human studies refute this. For instance:

* A 2020 meta-analysis published in *Obesity Reviews* found no conclusive evidence linking sugar substitutes to weight gain.

* On the contrary, they can support weight management by reducing overall calorie consumption when used as a replacement for regular sugar.

That said, moderation remains key. A diet loaded with ""sugar-free"" processed foods isn‚Äôt ideal, regardless of how many calories you‚Äôre saving.

**Myth 4: Sugar Substitutes Are Unnatural and Overly Processed**

Many people avoid sugar substitutes because they‚Äôre perceived as synthetic chemicals created in a lab.

**The Facts**

It‚Äôs true that many sugar substitutes, particularly artificial ones, are crafted through chemical processes. However, natural sweeteners like stevia and monk fruit are extracted from plants, refined, and then powdered for convenience.

It‚Äôs also worth considering that table sugar itself undergoes significant processing before reaching your kitchen. The idea that artificial equals harmful or unnatural equals healthy is overly simplistic.

**Myth 5: Sugar Substitutes Don‚Äôt Have Any Downsides**

On the flip side, some see sugar substitutes as miracle products with no consequences‚Äîbut this isn‚Äôt entirely accurate either.

**The Facts**

Though FDA-approved sugar substitutes are generally safe, certain individuals might experience mild reported side effects such as:

* Gastrointestinal discomfort from sugar alcohols like erythritol and xylitol.

* A slightly bitter aftertaste with stevia products (though this is improving with advancements in formulations).

What‚Äôs more, relying on sugar substitutes can perpetuate a preference for overly sweet tastes, making it harder to enjoy naturally sweet foods like fruits.

Wala rin siyang ibang hobby maliban sa pag-scroll sa phone. Inaya ko na siya sa iba‚Äôt ibang activities; minsan lang siya sasama, tapos wala na ulit. Ako kasi active ‚Äî into fitness, running, reading, and self-improvement.

Tinanong ko siya minsan kung anong nakikita niya sa future: sabi niya gusto lang maging asawa, magka-business (na never pa niya sinimulan for years), at ayaw na magtrabaho.

In 2013, our 24-year-old babysitter, Andrea, moved into our house with my mom, dad, brother, and me. She had her own little apartment setup downstairs. Not long after, my dad started finding love notes Andrea was leaving for my mom (43F). At first, my mom claimed she was just ‚Äúfalling asleep‚Äù in Andrea‚Äôs room at night ‚Äî but then she just moved out of the master bedroom to stay with Andrea full-time while my

Eventually, my dad left the house. Andrea slid right into his place ‚Äî moved upstairs, got cozy, and started acting like she ran everything.

When I hit my teenage years, Andrea‚Äôs behavior turned on me. She took away the coffee maker (literally moved it into her bedroom so I couldn‚Äôt use it), hid the TV remote, took over my bedroom for her ‚Äúoffice,‚Äù and shoved me into the cold, gross basement (cockroaches, leaks)‚Äî her old room. She even claimed the only mini fridge downstairs so I had no place to keep food or drinks. I am no perfect person, I probably wasn‚Äôt exactly happy with dealing with a person who was just a babysitter tell me that I had to listen to her. It was hard, it was frustrating, it was definitely difficult. I may have been a bit bratty as a teen, I get it. But I don‚Äôt get the remarks about what I can and cannot wear, which my father said was completely fine, but she thought was too slutty and made me feel uncomfortable. I was in a home that didn‚Äôt resort to yelling or raised voices, which started happening daily. I‚Äôm sure her childhood was not good, I am sorry for her in that sense. But she needed to deal with her trauma without deflecting it on others, especially children whose family she worked for.

But the worst part? She completely turned my mom against me. She acted like I was the problem, like I was the bad kid causing tension ‚Äî and my mom bought into it. I am aware there was tension. She caused some of it. She would compare me to my mom, and tell me I was only 1/2 as good as her. She would criticize my father in front of me. She would act out in front of my grandmother. When I would tell my mom she would say that I was probably just being dramatic. So, one day I was making a video of myself and she came into my room, another event of yelling at me. When I told my mom she said she didn‚Äôt want to hear it. She just wanted to believe everything was fine, even when she truly must have known. She would go on to disrespect my partner as a means to get at me when she was upset. When I tried to talk to her about wanting to fix this, she would brush me off. She made me feel bad about staying at home while in college, and yet my parents let her live with us during her college because rent was too expensive. I was grateful that I had the priviledge to stay at home during my studies. Andrea moved my family 2 hours away and rented out the top half of the house, and told me I could stay downstairs in the basement, which had it‚Äôs own private entrance. Without much notice, they moved and I was alone in the basement (2 bedroom), and unbeknownst to me Andrea was still going to be spending the weekends there (without my mom). I told my mom with all the conflict we had previously had and that I fwlt uncomfortable being alone with her, and my mom argued with me. She made it seem like it was outrageous for me to not want her ALONE with me all weekend, given her history. My mom became upset telling me that Andrea would not want me. This was not what I intended AT ALL. Andrea continued to come and go as she pleased, sometimes kicking me out for the whole day, even though she and my mom already moved. After all that was going on eventually, they kicked me out of the house entirely, but will still deny this.

Fast forward: Andrea and my mom got married two years ago ‚Äî and yeah, I wasn‚Äôt even invited. When she told me she and Andrea had been in a relationshio for 6 years behind my back I was honestly hurt, but I accepted it. I was happy that she found someone to make her happy. I just wished the person she chose was someone who accepted her whole family. My mom invited me to the wedding initially, which was supposed to be a small get together. I told her I wanted to get a cake for them. It was set for a Thursday. On that same week Tuesday (2 days prior), I get a call from my dad. My brother had called him and told him that ‚ÄúMom got married‚Äù. My dad was heartbroken, but I wasn‚Äôt even told. I was still in disbelief as this didn‚Äôt seem like something my mom would spontaneously do. When I asked her, she said she thought I wouldn‚Äôt want to come, when I had already previously expressed that I absolutely would.

Fast forward, I was getting ready for my own wedding, my mom refused to go check out venues, cake tastings, food tastings, etc. with me. Granted she was quite busy, and yet I still made time for her. I pre-set a date months in advance for a dress try on and fitting for my wedding dress. I had everyone on the guest list to come with us. Three days before the date of the fitting, I had an intuition to message my mom to remind her. When she called me, she told me to please change it as Andrea‚Äôs family was coming in and staying with them that weekend. Honestly, maybe a bit dramatic, but I felt soooo hurt. She once again chose her over me. I changed it. She made it this time, which made me feel a bit better. At my wedding, we were all getting photos taken. I had not spoken about what specific photos they wanted/who in them as I still was not on good terms with my step-mother. Apparently I had not taken photos with Andrea and Andrea was really upset by it. My mother later expressed to me that she ‚Äòhad‚Äô to manage Andrea during the wedding and take her into a separate room for 30 minutes during cocktail hour. To me, this is absolutely batshit. She cannot treat me the way she did and then be upset with me when I don‚Äôt want a relationship with her. You can‚Äôt have it both ways. Sorry.

When I was planning the wedding, they were not initially married. With that in mind and given our conflict going on, I wanted Andrea to not be seated up front at the wedding, yeah it‚Äôs harsh, but I also had my dad sitting up there. I thought it would be completely disrespectful to the family as well as to me given the way she treated me. I simply didn‚Äôt see her as family as she didn‚Äôt treat me as such.

AITA for not wanting my mom in my life and choosing to go no contact with her when she consistently chooses her wife‚Äôs lies and tantrums over me?",6,1748543487.0,AITAH,9,0.8,False

I landed a job at a major grocery chain back home and for the past few years have transferred from store to store. Ive always been a pretty dilligent and maticulous worker, the type that goes the extra mile and often times does ""too much"". Ive worked since i was 12 years old in my families gold mine (yes im aware of the alaskan stereotype, the children do indeed yearn for the mines...) and as a result ive been leadership material in almost every job ive ever had. So it wasnt surprising when i started at my new city that my ""entry level"" was going to be short lived, and that id be fast tracked for leadership (im not trying to toot my own horn. I do see leadership as a burden that im unfortunately good at)

With my promotion came a new location, and from the start i was pretty well recieved. I did however make a huge mistake and started dating a coworker from a completely different department (no, it wasnt a power thing, the difference in depts means i had no authority over her, that would make me way too uncomfortable) she had a group of friends too that at the beginning got along well with me too, two of Note being Barny (24M) and Marci (23F). Its important to note that i struggled a lot at this time as i was still getting used to the specifics of the position,my place in everything, and was also undiagnosed bipolar which i have since sought treatment and am medicated for, but this growth period did land me a fair enough reputation of being unstable, but highly ambitious.

My relationship with her didnt last long, Marci turned instantly bitter, turns out she had also wanted to date but couldnt because ""girl code"" and even though it had only been 3 dates and we were never official, the girl was marcis roommate. I agreed itd be awkward. However, Marci then flipped script and began to trash talk me to anyone who would listen. Eventually i had been doxxed by Logan Paul over a recall issue with lunchly back in October '24, and Marci kicked it into overdrive both in person and online. She continues the harassment here and there but that is a seperate issue thats being handled legally.

Barney, on the other hand, maintained being neutral as i hadnt slighted him personally, or as he had stated (in his opinion) hadn't slighted the girls either. I admire that position as i try to maintain it myself so Barry and i grew to be friendly enough for him to ask me for a recommendation into my department, as its the highest paying with the most hours. As much as we all like barney, his work ethic led something to be desired as he was a bare minimum employee who spent excessive time talking. I went on to tell him ""dude, yeah, itd be awesome to have you. Ill advocate for you, but keep in mind it will be with CONDITIONS so i can save face. Ill tell them 'i want barney in the dept, but after a 2 week observation period to see if his performance would improve to show that the job requirements can be met and potentially exceeded.'"" I even layed out, in my most graceful and tactful tone, the areas needed for improvement to make his ambitions become actualized. He seemed happy, we shook hands on it (viking style, forearm to forearm, the cool way that helps you check for daggers)

Needless to say, barney worked hard for 3 days and then backslid. I felt embarassed having attached my name to a not even half-assed attempt to succeed. Growing up i was told ""failure only breaks those who expect success without effort"" and given that there was no effort, it would stand to reason barneys failure in his own ambition wouldnt hurt too badly for him, right? Wrong. Someone else gets the job and its a good long while before another opens. About 6 months.

Sure enough, Barney doesnt ask me for help this time, he goes to a newly promoted boss (üö©). I saw this as a ""oh HELL naw"" kinda moment as i passed by and overheard him explaining to the boss above both of us (the one in charge of interviewing) that he wanted barney in the dept, and that he would be a great fit. Im gunna be honest, this boss isnt the most observant boss, and is about 10 years younger than me so he makes a lot of calls that a seasoned manager wouldnt make, this being a big one.
I interject. And state ""hey, just a reminder i advocated for him 6 months ago and he didnt shape up. We cant just promote based on LIKING someone, he lacks the merit and drive and it would hamper our progress as a business. IMO? Not a good idea.""

TELL ME this new boss doesnt break protocol and TELL Barney i said this in confidence between leadership (all 3 of us are managers mind you, and such things clearly cause drama, dont think so? Stay tuned kids) So now Barny is fuming. 

Next thing i know, im eating some sushi in the break room with someone in my dept whose friends with Barney. He walks up and starts talking to ONLY the other person, snubbing me. Making remarks on how many ""HATERS"" are in the store. About three weeks following he persists to death glare me, to which id just look confused. While i get being upset you didnt get promoted, whose fault is it actually, accountability would state its your track record that inhibited you. It was at this juncture he also got reprimanded for VERY LOUDLY trash talking me to anyone who would listen. Making this now happen on two fronts as Marci was still on that train too. 
Side note: My girlfriend could see the effect of the bullying, and was constantly trying to cheer me up as between Barney, Marci, and king D-bag logan paul, i had recieved bullying on a scale that reached 8 million people. Some of whom ive never met who would approach me in the store thanks to the Doxxing. In this effirt, she showed me ""Hazbin Hotel"" and a line from Alastor struck me as superbly wise: 
     ""A smile is a valuable tool my dear, it inspires your friends, keeps your enemies guessing, and ensures no matter what comes your way, you are in control""

In my own petty way i started to take control, as around this time Charlotte Dobre taught me what a ""yellow rock"" method is. Where i was the champion of ""grey rock"" it was time to change tactic. At this point barneys anger was inconsolable, and i had no choice but to endure it and allow him to retaliate, as the referees only EVER see the retaliations. So sure enough, his death glares were now met with HUGE. SH*T-EATING. GRINS. The results of which made him so angry that he stopped. But still maintained his boiling hatred for me, mostly filled with passerby comments to his friends stating things like ""yeah, well, the biggest problem in the store is (me)"" even though i made no fuss when his girlfriend applied and got the job as she actually showed she brings something to the table with her work ethics. This has gone on for months now and has been relatively idle,. 

So barney, for months, has gone on this way, and ive incited no interactions aside from professional ones. Marci, however, gets fired (finally) and gets a job at a makeup store. My girlfriend at this point has an issue with her as she shops at that store. And marci is still making tiktoks about me, 33 at this point adding to basically a movie about how horrible i am at about 1h22m long, adding at this point im ""triangulating"" my girlfriend to try and protect myself from her while also proving the entire time they were harassing and slandering me. (Lovely when the trash takes itself out). Barney, on the other hand, relishes in my harassment and at this point is trying my own tactic of smiling at me; a short lived tactic as i immediately said ""aww its good to see you smile again barn', and that i could make it happen? A great joy in my life!"" (Someone call mastercard, That expression drop: priceless). 

A month ago, i walked into the deli to ask for a cup of water before my shift, barney was the one to serve me. And i must say, it. Was. Brilliant.
-Before we continue, in all honesty i had at first really wanted to repair this friendship, but i AM bitter for being bullied for so long and being able to do nothing about it. To quote bo burnham: like the doctor of the kenyan track team, my patients wore thin- 
Keep in mind, this is BEFORE my shift. Im not clocked in. And as a low level, non salaried manager, cant be reprimanded as i would ON shift. Barney didnt know this, and saw me and immediately huffed. Leading to the following juicy interaction:
Me: heya barney, id just like a large water, no ice
Barney: (fills water half way) there.
Me: uhh... this is only half full
Barney: you can fill the other half in the break room
Me: uhm, im injured (lower back herniated discs)... and anyway, isnt that your job anyway? You havent filled my-
Barney: im NOT filling it. You can fill it.
Me: (chuckles in disbelief) ya know barney? Maybe THIS is why you didnt get into grocery. You cant even fulfill a simple order in a professional way without throwing a pissy little attitude into everything you do. Do me, and yourself a favor, do your job, and fill the f*cking cup with water because i am thirsty and severely injured."" 
Barney: (scoffs, fills the cup) i didnt get into grocery because YOU- 
Me: gee, i wonder why. I dont care to hear it, thatnks for the water and start actually doing some work, bye loser.
Barney: hey F*CK YOU
me: haha byyyeeee loserr!

Funny enough, because i wasnt on the clock he had no right to demand i use the employee room, and had no recourse to talk to a customer that way, nor to deny their request for an order even if its ""free."" 

But even funnier, this being an incident from last month, he seems to have shaped up to a point where he has earned employee of the month for our entire store. He works hard now, pulls his weight, and is reliable and punctual. A model employee. I dont want to take any credit as it truly does belong to him and he deserves it, but i do feel that even though it was ""dickish"" it motivated him to prove me wrong, and he did so with excellence. I no longer think he's a loser and even attempted to bury the hatchet, despite his clear contempt for me still, as i got my coffee this morning. Stating that it was purely a decision i was making in the best interest of the business as a manager, and not personal in the slightest. And that i was sorry for any friction it caused. When he continued to express anger i continued to express sorrow that he chooses to continue feeling this way. There is an obvious gap in age and maturity, which is in part why i chose negative motivation to attempt to get him to fall in line the same way thats expected by anyone in our shared employment. 

In my world, men have used negative motivation as a means to achieve greatness. Positivity is thrown in when needed, but self assurance and self reliance were crucial in my upbringing as i grew up in a small village in alaska, where life or death was commonplace from the elements, wildlife, and even each other as law enforcement and emergency services had a 45 minute responce time, and my father being a full blooded marine wanted it that way for us (for some reason). My upbringing has made it difficult to adjust to certain aspects of society. So my personality can be a little grating, and i do accept responsibility for my escalating of these matters, especially as a leader. I have resolved to be better than my lesser self in that regard with a ""if you cant say something nice..."" kind of thought process. But i DO lend tremendous merit to negative motivation in a non-deep cutting way. Case and point: i had at one point taken a selfie of me lifting weights, a friend said he thought it was douchey cuz it wasnt much weight and just meant to ""show my pump"" so then i proceeded to post picture after picture of me setting new PR's in a hulkish display of unbridled spite-lifting. Shut him up REAL quick.

So, AITA for negatively motivating a coworker? He already hates me, might as well give him a reason. But i will NEVER tell him that i feel i had a hand in him finally lacing up his boots, cant let the kid lose his fire...",1,1748543152.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

It was going all good between us but one day I had to go home and to my relatives home as well. My family is kinda conservative and I dont pick any calls from my female friends at home, although texts are not any problem. A few days prior to it, I made a promise to my gf that I will surely pick up her call even if it‚Äôs at night and I will tell my mom that my friend had an anxiety attack and wanted to talk to someone, if asked about it. 

So, when I was at my relatives home, I drove the car all day as my relatives had a surgery and I was just doing my job of helping them. Througout the day my phone was on silent as it was connected to cars bluetooth and I did not want them to know that my gf is messaging me again and again. I used to squeeze out some time while parking the car or other stuff to reply to her messages. 

The night came, I asked her to have a small talk as I was exhausted and about to sleep, but she was busy with her friends and was not available. So I just went to sleep at 1am after texting her a goodnight message. I was at my relatives home that night. 

I woke up at 6 in the morning, picked up my phone and saw that there were 13 missed calls from her between 3:30 and 4 am. I was all shocked I messaged her, called her, she pick up and said she is alright and she went back to sleep. I forgot to take off my phone from silent that night. That was a mistake.

Now when I returned back to college, we had a fight over it that I said she can call me anytime but I did not pick up her call that night. She said she really needed me. 
It was my mistake, I said sorry I will not repeat it. All the fights and arguments going smooth, and then she said something. She said that his old friend ‚Äòm‚Äô used to pick up her call even at 3 am. Now this made me angry right at the moment. 

Just a cotext this person ‚Äòm‚Äô was not her ex, but he was his best friend and both of them used to have feelings for each other which were left unsaid and then they both just distanced because of some other girls. Her day used to start with his goodmorning and end at a goodnight to him. This is how strong their bond was.

Coming on to the situation, I got so angry that we kept on fighting all night. And in the morning we slept, when we woke up, she called me and said that she is going on a coffee with this ‚Äòm‚Äô. I wanted to fight again but I did not want another fight. So I said that can I join you? I also knew this guy, I have been sitting with him in lectures straight for a year, but she said no. So, I said okay, just a coffee and you will return back. I said so because it is the last days of our college and she wanted to say a goodbye to everyone with whom she had or has good connections with. 

When she came back, I was excited to meet her and then she told me that she went for coffee at some fine dine and then she drove his car and then she went to his home and met his mom and dad. 

This made me agrier 
and I ended uo fighting with her again. 


And from that day, I have never been the same with her. Our relationship is at the verge of breakup and I find this particular situation to be the cause of it. 

I am really shattered inside that she first compared me to someone whom she loved and then went out with him. 

I asked her why she did it. She simply said she wanted a break from me and nothing else.

I am ready to forgive her but I jist cant get this out of my mind that she compared me to someone and then went out the next day with him. And this fact has hit me everytime when we had sat down and talked about it and made me angry every time and hence the matter is not solved till date.

So here's a self lore first 

Let's start with that I'm a very logical person. At some point I didn't believe in gods and entities that did not have any coherent logical reason, I like mythology especially greek and Norse and see them as parts or fragments of the past. 

However! As I grew up I HATED SPIDERS. but I don't want to kill them I fear them. They always jumped scare me since I was a child, I had vivid memories that they would fall on me during times I cried in the shower, or run up the stairs chasing me when I got back home. A random spider always appearing in my room despite all my doors and windows closed and usually they be chilling close to my headboard or under my bed. I am taking a science related course and my university sits in the middle of a forest.... Not unusual to find things here right?

But big ass forest spiders. Tree spiders. I win the lottery to stumble upon them when I'm just trying to go home from the lab. Snakes appearing when I'm crossing the street and ect. Sightings of insects and wild animals aren't rare but if you asked a student how many times have they seen a chilling spider in a usually vacant tree in the middle of the park on a random Wednesday it's not 
Really supposed to exceed your fingers.

And cobwebs everywhere. I clean and dust on my good days (atleast once a week as I'm a busy person but I do throughout cleaning on  good days, unless I'm mentally unwell and I rot in my room for a month or so.)

My interest in loki got more fiery around highschool and marvel Loki despite yes being a fictional character got me hooked further as he represents  favourite Norse aesier. Then the rick Riordan books, I was interested in it especially on the Magnus chase series upon knowing that Loki is represented in it.

I also liked burning stuff. Not the arson kind but  the kind that when I  cook anything or something  sweet, i had the habit to chuck it into the fire because it felt right. 

(I'm sorry if I'm quite scatter brained I'm trying to pull out as much info as I can to help you guys understand or curate a response to my post)

Now all this came to a curious conversation this year around march. I have good friends that introduced me to diety worshiping. And one of them suggested that maybe Loki was reaching out to me this whole time. Backtracking my late mother used to tell me bedtime stories about our supposedly elders that used to be  practitioners of spiritual customs, which unfortunately was discontinued around their generation. 
After thinking about it and how my friends encouraged me to try, I tried asking, and  praying for signs. After almost a decade of turning my back to worshiping any diety as my life always felt like it was some god's sandbox, I decided to try worshipping Loki, or just actually try to ask if they're indeed calling me.

So I tried learning about my favourite god again, Loki. Reread everything that is left and are existing of their folk and history. Norse stories , and archives of what humans have found of their existence. 

Then slowly I built them a small altar in my room and lit my first candle. Researched on what people noticed they like as offerings.

The next part this is where I am confused and hope to ask guidance for 

I'm unsure of the feeling. I am a logical person but I trust my gut as it felt right at times. Additionally my dreams are most of the time so accurate it's scary (example was when I was younger I dreamt that I took a test and got wrong answers on numbers I vividly remember from the dream, the next morning I changed the answers for those questions and actually ended up with perfect scores.)

For their altar I tried to go with a gut feeling looking for a small plate for their offerings first, I was amazed when it felt like I was being lead to a shop where it only sold these small plates in an emerald green color. Then a red toy car felt like a nice touch that I saw in the shelves of the same shop. There's this kind of pull towards me on some days, like a random shopping day and suddenly I want to buy a gold pen , ect.

Food offerings; I would usually make coffee for them with cinnamon on Saturdays or share my food when it felt like ""hmm.... Does my dear god want some?"" 
Nuggets, chocolates , food I cook, ect. But yes it's always the savory and the sweet ones that felt like oh I should burn it on their offering plate.

And when I started praying to them for guidance and working through research on tiktok and other platforms (I know tiktok is not reliable most times,  but my birdbrain had to learn somewhere)
I started dabbling on prayers and sigils

tried to learn basic sigil making and spells. Trying with the extent of my knowledge on younger futhark and old Norse to make genuine prayers in form of sigils...

Ever since seeking guidance from them life has been a slight roller coaster but it didn't feel as heavy as before, the spidersssss THE SPIDERS THEY'RE GONE OR JUST SMALL BECAUSE I HOPE IT IS WHAT I THOUGHT IT IS. THE FIRST PRAYER I UTTERED TO THEM WAS TO PLEASE IF HE WANTS TO SEND A SIGNAL JUST SMALL SPIDERS.

But dear lord at one time I travelled and had to leave my place for long, the night before I left A BIG ASS SPIDER THE SIZE OF MY HAND SNEAKED INTO MY ROOM I ALMOST FAINTED. BUT I realized maybe if it was Loki's work was it their way to protect my place because I was to leave? 
(I apologise to them after returning from my trip upon realizing this, because honestly the panic attack I almost had made me slightly resent them thinking they're pulling something like a prank on me after I said no spiders)

There are days when I do cleansing spells and such when I try to feel or look for their presence I feel this mix of yearning for warmth and a feeling of warmth at the same time. It feels empty like whatever feels cold I have the need to place warmth to it with a gesture or a hug, and at the same time it feels like it is me that needs it. 

So yes... This is I guess me sharing my experience and also asking those who worship them and those who worship other deities if I'm on the right track?",0,1748542736.0,pagan,1,0.5,False

Where I live, there is absolutely nothing to do. Nothing but restaurants, fast food, gas stations, and stores. There are no places to go where I can meet new people who are around my age (early 20‚Äôs). 

I am currently on most dating sites looking for friends and dates, and not once have I ever had a real person swipe right on me. There are no social groups, clubs, or hobbies that I can partake in within 20-30 miles that put me around other people. 

The best thing I know to do is go to a mostly empty local coffee shop and read my book, or drive an insane distance to the nearest city and walk around by myself, only to be ignored by everybody. 

The few times I try to spark up a conversation with a stranger, I can immediately tell that they want to be left alone.

Favourite out of the lot is Burberry Hero: it's Piny in the top and gives a good woody dry down and lasts a whole day.

Next is the clone of Aqua Di Gio I got from Dubai. 80% close to the original, and lasts long too.

Coffee Oud Attar from Izharsons Perfume from Lucknow. A well known place. I wish to shop from there soon. Couldn't buy much as I was in a hurry. This one projects for 6hours and was worth just 400rupees.

I like the fragrance of Beardo Whisky Smoke and Tsunami. Hate others. Especially LSD. None of them last over an hour though.

I like the Zara Night Pour Homme! Sweet and get ample of compliments on dates.

Not here but would like to mention the classic Old Spice Original after shave lotion. Love the smell of it on me.

With our regular mugs, we can save that for guests but when I do work from home, I can have my corkcicle mugs. (I already have one specifically for when I go to the office. Fits in my bag and car). And plus is that it was marked 50% off regular price on the website. 

Wondering if I should keep it? Also, the deeper issue is that yes, I do find good deals but was it really necessary for me drive by there after work? No. Not excusing it but there was a major collision that pretty much shut down traveling, so when I got to the office, my schedule was affected/shifted and had to see clients later. It was all okay and everything ended up fine but I think maybe I stopped by Marshall‚Äôs for that quick fix and I always feel good when I find those good deals.

My group is visiting PEI for the first time. We are having a fantastic time so far - everyone is very kind and your island is so serene and clean. 

We have noticed a trend of which we are curious about the history: As we explore, we notice little conglomerates of shops that seem to be filled with the same names over and over - they typically contain a Boomburger, Receiver Coffee, Coastal Culture, Cows, and a few other repeating names.  They seem to be mostly oriented toward tourists but we do see locals dining at some. We haven‚Äôt noticed something quite as replicated at scale in our travels before, so we are curious as to how this came about - what is the history of it and who is powering it today? Do the companies operate independently under agreements or are they part of a larger brand? Some of the shops have different names but seem to sell the same items. We are just curious as to how this all works behind the scenes. Thanks in advance! Cheers! 

Editing to add Lone Oak and Tide Water are chains we see replicated in these conglomerates as well.  

Two examples of these shop groups - the first at the Milky Way Boardwalk roundabout west of Charlottetown, the second is downtown on the harbor. We have seen a handful across the island.
