1gn5ea1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Good_BADs/comments/1gn5ea1/erens_character_issues_and_his_inspiration/,Eren's character issues and his inspiration.,"Yes, another post on this topic, maybe you are already tired of listening, and the same arguments over and over again, but anyway, let's discuss this aspect of the ending, but with two sides. As we all know, Isayama was inspired by many works throughout the writing of the manga in this post, we will only touch on the manga called Himeanole. But unlike similar articles on this topic, for the first time in this topic we are addressing not only the manga, but also the film adaptation of this manga, filmed in 2016, and its features.

**Part 1 What is ""Himeanole""?**

Himeanoles can be divided into two parts, which depend on which of the main characters is present in this chapter, as well as the secondary characters that are related to them. One of them is a relatively normal guy named Okida, he is kind of a loser, he doesn't have many friends and no girlfriends. This changes when he goes to a local coffee shop where he meets a woman named Yuki, who later becomes his girlfriend. There are various comedic and awkward moments in this part, most of which will be a special secondary character (Ando, ​​Okada's teacher friend), but what is important for us is the second main character, whose name is Morita.

Morita is not normal. He is almost a psychopath. In fact, he has already killed in the past and is inclined to do it again (he killed a bully who was bothering them together with one of his classmates). He also blackmails his former friend to send him money while not working for 7 years and spending the money on repairing vending machines. But still, his storyline begins, oddly enough, as a secondary character whose goal is to help his 'friend' kill her husband on the orders of his wife (insurance money) unfortunately the plan failed, and the 'friend' plans to escape because he is afraid of being arrested, but suddenly something unexpected happens and Morito simply kills him.

Later he calls his friend Wagusi, who he extorts money from, and asks him to help him with a case (he doesn't know about the murders) which leads to this dialogue.

https://preview.redd.it/2ffbudr82uzd1.png?width=1461&format=png&auto=webp&s=e630084e607b59fb1af72a5c81518845fe11f8c5

And yes, it seems he doesn't feel any self-loathing or pity for other people, he also directly states his main goals (killing Yuki and tormenting her) several times throughout the manga and his number one goal never changes. Later the plot shifts from killing Yuki to killing Okade when Morito finds out that they are dating and that Okade can become a 'threat' and tries to get rid of him, he even hires a homeless person who has a license to help him if Wagusi can't (at the same time he lies that he wants to teach Okade a lesson as a bad person who offends his 'girlfriend' Yuki). However, this event becomes the last straw for Wagusi, he plans to turn himself in to stop Morito and his future murders, but his girlfriend suggests to just kill him, and he agrees to this, unfortunately, the plan fails, and they die at the hands of Morito. Now Morito uses the homeless man to get rid of the bodies (while threatening him that if he does not help, he will kill him) and also burns down his house to delay the police in investigating the missing people (as a result of the arson, people die). After this, several more bad things happen to him (killing a woman with cancer who took him in, killing a police officer who came to a call as a result of Morito getting a gun, killing Yuki's neighbor in an attempt to get her, as well as the man who was digging under him and who warned Okada, which caused Yuki and Okada to flee the city). As a result, in an attempt to achieve his goals, he killed 10 people and lost everything he had, but never got close to Yuki, for the first time he begins to think about himself and others and is caught by the police (knowing that he faces the death penalty).

**Part 2 Those Were Not Sunny Eyes.**  
Honestly, there's a lot to say about the adaptation, but we're focusing on the last 20 shorts of this movie, where things happen that weren't in the manga, and the first thing we'll touch on is the dialogue between Yuki and Okade in the hospital after Ando meets Morita (completely original scene)

https://preview.redd.it/0wbsgulb2uzd1.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=f166d88682c0f7d28374ee8c0de5c1acfacc145e

**(01:20:33-01:22:00)**

>Yuki: Mr. Ando will not die.

>Okade: It's all because of what I did.

>Yuki: What can I do?

>Yuki: It is not your fault.

>Okade: Of course it is.

>Yuki: Morita...came for me.

>Okade: It all started when we were dating.

>Yuki: It is not your fault.

>Yuki: Me too...did something.

>Yuki: What did you do?

>Okade: The truth is...when we got to high school...

>Okade: I became friends with Morita.

>Okade: We liked the same games.

>Okade: But when Morita...

>**Okade: Kawashima mocked him...**

>**Okade: I started keeping my distance.**

>**Okade: Then Morita...stopped coming to school.**

>**Okade: And Kawashima...there was no one to intimidate and it became boring.**

>**Okade: I forced Morita to go back to school.**

>**Okade: I told him that Kawashima ready to apologize.**

>**Okade: I lied to him.**

>**Okade: I brought Morita to school. I teamed up with the hooligans.**

>**Okade: I looked at him with contempt.**

>**Okade: I'll never forget how**

>**Okade: He looked at me.**

>**Okade: With despair.**

>**Okade: He was dying. These were not human eyes.**

And you all got it right, in the 2016 film we have a different Morito, unlike the original, where they often say that he was there from birth in the film, he's just a normal guy who was broken and who succumbed to a slight darkness and started killing. And also that all of this could have been easily avoided, that's why there are adult and child Morito in the film (this is also reflected in how the police catch him and that there was a final battle between Okade and Morita, which didn't happen, and they only talked once in the original) in the film they have 3 new dialogues, and they, unlike in the manga, feel more like friends).

**Part 3 Eren and Why It Just Doesn't Work**

So the theme we know Isayama's idea of ​​someone being ""born the way they are"" seems to mostly come from Himeanol, where Morita never managed to become a theme who could live in a normal society, and knew that there was always something wrong with him. (except in the movie, 2016) Isayama hinted at this in previous chapters. 121 is an example:

https://preview.redd.it/2464161z2uzd1.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=26a935a1122b197e85c4a2ddfdee9fb2d50f217d

https://preview.redd.it/ovlngqf03uzd1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9bd5bea611082898d5fd4903658b874b09800e3

He wished for it. He wanted it to happen.

In other words, 131 paints Eren as if he wanted to create the Rumble because he wanted to see the very world that was presented to him in Armina's book: In conclusion: Eren was born with a twisted desire for freedom, that freedom = flat earth (yes, as stupid as that may sound), and because of that, he committed the Rumble. He just wanted a clean surface and wanted to kill humanity because they were in his way.

The Himeanol check here is great. Morita, like Eren, wasn't born ""normal"" and he also had a sick and twisted desire. For his desires, it was to get pleasure by killing people. For Erena, it's a flat world that he wants to have and the only way to achieve that is to kill everyone.

https://preview.redd.it/p2mqv3a23uzd1.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8be6ae113de67104cb2131064be5d0c8a828488

**So why doesn't it just work!!!**

The difference between Himeanol and Attack on Titan is that the author of Himeanol portrayed Morita as a villain after his first kill. While you can feel sorry for him, it's hard to ever sympathize with him when you know he's doing it simply because he's an evil pervert who gets pleasure from these people.

Meanwhile, in Attack on Titan, Isayama wrote a ton of reasons why someone should root for Eren. Hell, we see Eren's mother get eaten (reveals he did it, thanks to 139 for that), which would make just about anyone angry. We see him become more calm and rational in Brawl, we see him get genuinely upset at what his father did. We also see Eren even give up his own life to save humanity in the Historia cave.

That doesn't fit a character who apparently just wants to flatten everything because of a random book. Hell, even Eren himself said that he FORGOT the dream he shared with Armin in Chapter 84:

https://preview.redd.it/eltsfr533uzd1.png?width=979&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dd6684923f895bff3d7deffba3d2607e56acce6

131 wants to tell us that ever since he was a child, Eren has been inclined to see the Earth as flat and devoid of people, and yet in Chapter 84, Eren says that he has long forgotten about that dream and that it has been replaced by a desire for revenge.

Yes, you could say he regained this dream after Armina's resurrection, but consider that Isayama also stated this in an interview:

https://preview.redd.it/83km6r663uzd1.png?width=548&format=png&auto=webp&s=55115f03f0a91c2a0202cdee94aa94b627335850

He wasn't interested in the sea, he was interested in seeing these things without being bound by any restrictions.

But then the number 131 comes up, implying that ""seeing this scenery"" was what Eren had wanted all along, ever since he was a child. There's a reason why these two panels use the image of Eren as a child:

https://preview.redd.it/zhrgib483uzd1.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=84a38ddb6fbf7b9b1695112a3702de17c8c96235

Suddenly, what he wants to achieve isn't the freedom he would get from killing his enemies, not recognizing the freedom of whatever he wants to think, but the view itself.

The implication is disturbing. In fact, even if the outside world was completely peaceful, Eren would still have caused the Rumble because he was disappointed that humanity even exists outside the walls.

He says it himself:

https://preview.redd.it/2yn3v4793uzd1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=759686cf0d6e62a53f0d21181c4465379a8a4858

So Eren wanted to do the Rumble because he wanted a flattened world, he stated this in 139, he stated in 131 that he was disappointed that everything still existed and that he wanted to wipe it with his face. ground. He also stated that it was primarily because the world was not like the one in Armina's book.

But how does this fit with the same guy who himself previously stated that he forgot about this dream? How could something that Armina's book told him be taken to make him want to destroy the world?

Isayama couldn't answer any of these questions. He took only one part of Morito's character and ignored all the others or replaced them with something that never seemed part of originality or even contradictory to him. Morito is honest with himself, he knows what he wants and what he will do (get rid of any threat that could motivate him to catch Yuki) for the sake of his dream, in the movies he almost achieved this goal, and we see what could have happened to Yuki. Morito cheated, killed the people who lived in the houses he killed, and they are not needed to justify his actions, because he knows why he did it and most of the time he killed without remorse, so he was from the beginning to the last chapter.

And what's funny is that when the desire for conscience appeared, woke up and asked about the killed, he again said only to himself that we should believe that Eren was born in a flat world, but we also saw him state that he forgot about his dream. In essence, we had Isayama himself state that Eren does not care what the outside world looks like, but that he cares about being free to see it.

According to the High School Caste, even AU!Eren needed to be disrupted:

https://preview.redd.it/0j2jqzsa3uzd1.png?width=569&format=png&auto=webp&s=2af117a4b3f3073719df862f1ff5abe983b7a1b3

And yes, the high school castes are concerned about the basic style, it's (sort of) canon, and the characters live in different countries.

flattery, but according to Isayama, they have the same personality.

So yeah, Eren's character becomes messy because Isayama got too inspired by a work that was created too late and implemented it in a bad and rushed manner, which hardly makes any sense.

**TL;DR**

**The ending was messy and confusing, Isayama shouldn't have tried to force the ""born this way"" theme that he read about in Himeanole and also add new features that were not typical of the original and contradicted.**

**P.S.**

**Although it is also worth noting that besides Isayama, there are two more fans of this work when reading the thoughts of the first fan, you ask questions when reading the thoughts of the other, you ask yourself terrible questions, to which I definitely don't want to know the answers, but maybe I'll write about it someday**",1,1731139761.0,u_Good_BADs,0,0.99,False

1gn5bm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/interiordecorating/comments/1gn5bm3/simple_tricks_to_make_your_home_feel_more/,Simple Tricks to Make Your Home Feel More Luxurious,"**Introduction: The Art of Affordable Luxury**

Creating a home that exudes luxury doesn’t require a total overhaul or sky-high budgets. It’s about carefully choosing elements that enhance the elegance and sophistication of your space. With a few simple tricks, anyone can transform their home into a refined sanctuary without breaking the bank.

**Embrace a Minimalist Approach**

A clutter-free environment breathes calm into any space, giving it a spacious and opulent feel. By reducing clutter and prioritizing fewer, higher-quality items, you allow each piece to stand out. Minimalism isn’t just about having less—it’s about elevating what you choose to keep.

**Elevate with a Cohesive Color Scheme**

A cohesive color scheme can instantly make any room feel more polished. Opt for a palette of neutrals and warm tones, which provide an elegant, understated foundation. Adding pops of color in artwork, pillows, or accent pieces creates a striking yet balanced look that enhances sophistication.

**Play with Texture and Layering**

Luxury is often found in the details of texture and layering. By mixing textures like leather, velvet, and faux fur, you add depth to your space. Try layering a plush throw over a textured sofa or placing a soft rug under a sleek coffee table. These layers add an inviting warmth and tactile appeal.

**Upgrade Your Lighting Fixtures**

Lighting is one of the most impactful upgrades you can make. Choose statement chandeliers or pendant lights that draw attention. Layer lighting with warm lamps and sconces to create a cozy and inviting ambiance. Good lighting not only illuminates but also enhances the style of a room.

**Enhance Walls with Art and Mirrors**

Mirrors can transform any room by creating the illusion of more space and reflecting light. Large statement mirrors or an artful gallery wall brings life to plain walls. Art pieces add character and can serve as conversation starters, contributing to a luxurious aesthetic.

**Invest in Quality Fabrics and Materials**

Luxurious fabrics like velvet, silk, and linen add a sense of opulence. Natural materials, such as wood and marble, bring an earthy richness. These materials age beautifully, making your home feel timeless and grounded.

**Incorporate Sophisticated Accent Pieces**

Choosing sophisticated accent pieces like statement vases or sculptures elevates your decor. Timeless pieces don’t have to be expensive; focus on items with clean lines or unique shapes that exude understated elegance.

**Use Area Rugs to Define Spaces**

A rich-patterned or colored area rug can ground a room and add a sense of coziness. Layering rugs is another trick that creates a sense of depth and sophistication.

**Introduce Greenery and Floral Arrangements**

Indoor plants breathe life into a room, while floral arrangements add a touch of nature’s elegance. Choose elegant plants like fiddle leaf figs or arrange flowers in beautiful vases to add organic luxury.

**Install Elegant Window Treatments**

Floor-length drapes in luxurious fabrics like linen or velvet create a refined, flowing look. Opt for neutral or metallic tones that add to the room’s elegance without overpowering the decor.

**Update Cabinet Hardware and Fixtures**

Upgrading handles, knobs, and faucets to brass or matte black instantly modernizes and adds elegance to any space. These small details may seem minor, but they make a big difference in how finished a room feels.

**Create a Cozy Reading Nook**

A well-styled reading nook with a comfortable armchair, a throw, and a floor lamp can become an inviting space. Add a small table to complete the look, making it a luxurious retreat within your home.

**Add Personal Touches in a Refined Manner**

Personal photos, souvenirs, and art from travels can enrich a room’s atmosphere. Display them in chic frames or tasteful arrangements, blending personal warmth with sophisticated decor.

**Create Symmetry in Your Layouts**

Symmetry in a room’s layout creates a sense of balance and order. Matching lamps, chairs, or decor items in pairs makes any room feel more thoughtfully designed and luxurious.

**Display Elegant Books and Magazines**

Curate a selection of coffee table books that add style and interest to your living space. A stack of beautiful books or well-chosen magazines becomes an extension of your home’s elegance.

**Organize Open Shelves for Visual Appeal**

Use baskets, boxes, and artful arrangements to keep open shelves looking intentional and tidy. Layer items to create depth, and blend functional pieces with decorative items.

**Add Scent to Enhance the Atmosphere**

A beautifully scented home is both inviting and luxurious. Scented candles, diffusers, or essential oils can transform a room, creating an atmosphere that suits every season or occasion.

**Use Metallic Accents Strategically**

Strategic use of metallic accents like gold, silver, or copper can add just the right touch of glamour. Mix metals carefully to avoid clashing and aim for balance.

this bring us to now. i shortened my work load because i knew it was too much on me, so i have some random shifts throughout the week. to start, even without caffeine, i CANNOT even begin to sleep until atleast 3am. i have tried everything. no screens, warm milk, warm baths/showers, whatever you’d think. i have now found that anytime i luckily get anything over 6 hours of sleep, i am absolutely miserable throughout the day, completely irritable, and more tired than before i went to sleep. with these symptoms, if i try to sleep, my body just wont let me. also, i have SO much trouble getting up with ‘good sleep.’ (the long sleeps come randomly..like once every week if not less) if i somehow sleep very early, (if i ever have a long sleeping time, its more common i fall asleep very early, like 4-5pm,) its near impossible for me to wake up when needed (likely around 8am.) if i dont have an alarm set, i normally sleep for 13 hours or so, but i still have the same exhausted feeling. more sleep if anything makes the tiredness worse. however, when i seem to get around two hours of sleep, or less, i feel great. no tiredness throughout the day or lack of concentration. 

as i write this post, im on probably four hours of sleep (two and two per night) in the last sixty, and i am not tired AT ALL (its almost 12am) i have tried to set a consistent schedule and i feel like take all the normal ordinary advice i always get, but nothing works. what can i do to fix this??

On Aug 26, 2024 I started having very dull pain on upper stomach area. (4 weeks prior to this i had some acidity episodes..otherwise I had no other gut problems. BUT 1 week before Aug 26 I had serious irritation in my mouth and tongue, never had this kind of situation; I thought this could be allergy due to change in toothpaste). Until sep 2 2024, I ignored this dull pain but Sep 2nd I visited Gastro specialist. He examined and diagnosed it could be dyspepsia or peptic ulcer. Asked me to take PPI  for 15 days.

After 1 week of PPI, I didn't find any relief. The pain was dull and disturbing my peace of mind.  The doctor did an endoscopy on Sep 10 and did RUT. It came as positive for HPylori. He also said there is redness on lower stomach walls. He prescribed triple therapy with probiotics.

I took 14 days of triple therapy with strict diet. No coffee or tea. Mostly white rice with yogurt  and lentil soup.  After 14 days, I continued with PPI for another 14 days. By the end of 10th day on antibiotics, I started to see some improvements in dull pain. And there after it gradually improved. 

6 weeks after I stopped Antibiotics (4 weeks after I stopped PPI), today, I took Helic UBT test. The test involved drinking urea solution wait 1 min rinse mouth. Then breathe by keeping a small tube in mouth for 3 min. Then again for 6 min.  The test result shows it's NEGATIVE.

This test was seriously costlier than endoscopy. I don't know if that test center robbed me; I didn't check price anywhere.  When I googled, I realised i have paid 5X more than market price. 

I hope this bacteria has gone from my stomach for now.  I would like to do UBT once again since I don't know if I took this test too soon. I am confused about what doctor had said ... is it 8 weeks after from last visit or 8 weeks after stopping antibiotic. I tried to call him yesterday; but didn't recieve reply. But this morning I just went ahead and took the test.",1,1731138725.0,HPylori,0,1.0,False

It grows in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. For hundreds of years, people have used the leaves of this tree to relieve pain and as other therapeutic agents. In recent years, the product made mainly from this plant’s leaves has been gaining international popularity for quite another reason: its reported range of benefits goes from helping relieve pain to enhancing one’s mood. Not all kratom is created equal; different strains offer different effects, and knowledge about this really can be crucial for anyone who wants to use kratom effectively.

What is Kratom?
Kratom is an evergreen tree in the coffee family. The leaves contain several compounds with relevant, pharmacologically documented properties, primarily mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, which interact with opioid receptors. This interaction typically produces analgesia and euphoria, with a low addictive potential and fewer side effects.

The Many Strains of Kratom
The color of the veins and stems of the leaf typically classifies kratom. Three primary colors are red, green, and white—each with unique properties. Kratom strains can also be defined by a name that refers to their geographic origin, like Bali, Maeng Da, or Borneo. Read further about each type and its uniqueness.

Red Vein Kratom
Red vein kratom is one of the most popular and easily accessible strains. They are well known due to their sedation, which helps with pain killing and relaxation effects. It’s a common strain that is recommended for people who seek to find relief from chronic pain, anxiety, and insomnia.

Red Bali
Origin: Indonesia
Effects: Red Bali is one of the most commonly used red strains. It is famous for its strong effect on pain relief and sedation. Users reportedly feel a sense of calm and well-being.
Uses: As a pain reliever, against stress, and for insomnia.
Red Borneo
Origin: Borneo
Effects: Red Borneo is slightly more stimulating than Red Bali, but its effects are still very potent. It also provides analgesic properties and relaxation; smaller doses can uplift moods and slightly boost energy.
Uses: Pain relief, reduction of anxiety, and mood improvement.
Red Maeng Da
Origin: Thailand (now mainly grown in Indonesia)
Effects: Red Maeng Da is highly potent. It gives high pain relief, relaxation, and a sense of euphoria. It is used mainly for severe pain or high tolerance use in other kratom varieties.
Use: Relief of long-term pain, reducing stress, and euphoriant.
Green Vein Kratom
The green vein is a bit like the ‘middle way’ effect-wise. So, delivering a mix or compromise between the red and white strains, moderate pain relief can be expected, not at all sedating, and an energy boost far from overstimulating. This makes the strain appropriate for daytime use.

Green Malay
Origin: Malaysia
Effects: Green Malay is considered chiefly long-lasting. It offers a balanced blend of energy boost, pain relief, and mood elevation, which is one reason users choose this particular strain.
Use: Pain relief, energy boost, and mood enhancement.
Green Borneo
Origin: Borneo
Effects: Green Borneo has average energizing and pain-relieving effects. Unlike Red Borneo, it is not sedative and can increase alertness and focus.
Benefits: Helps in pain management, increases focus, and gives a slight energy lift.
Green Maeng Da
Origin: Thailand (primarily grown in Indonesia)
Effects: The effect of Green Maeng Da is very strong and long-lasting. It offers excellent energetic mind balance, pain relief, and euphoria. Most users take this strain if they need a strong yet balanced strain.
Uses: Analgesic, Stimulant, Mood Enhancer.
White Vein Kratom
White Vein Kratom is widely known for its stimulating and mood-enhancing properties. Being less sedative than the red and green strains, it’s perfect for daytime use and users requiring high energy and focus levels.

White Thai
Origin: Thailand
Effects: White Thai is also a widely known powerful stimulant. It energizes, improves concentration, and enhances the overall sense of well-being. Many would use this white strain as a replacement for caffeine.
Uses: Boost of energy, increased attention, and elevated mood.
White Borneo
Origin: Borneo
Effects: White Borneo is balanced, offering a bit of stimulation and a touch of relief in pain. It enhances focus and concentration and is mildly analgesic.
Uses: For energy increase, relief from pain, and enhanced concentration.
White Maeng Da
Origin: Thailand (cultivated mainly in Indonesia)
Effects: White Maeng Da is among the strong whites. It gives most users dramatically high energy, extreme concentration, and elevation, making powerful stimulation preferable for users in need.
Uses: Increased energy, focus, and mood enhancer.
Determinants of the Effects of Kratom
Many factors might determine the effects: dosage, individual tolerance, and method of consumption.

Kratom Dosage
Low Dose (1-3 grams): The energizing effects are mild, along with stimulation and heightened alertness.
Moderate Dosage (3-5 grams): Offers a very balanced package with energy, relief, and mood enhancement.
High Dose (5-7 g): Sedative, strong pain reliever.
Very high dose (7-10 g): This will result in strong sedation with euphoria but could increase the risks of side effects.
Kratom Tolerance
If this is done constantly, it will lead to an increase in tolerance and the requirement for increased doses for normal effects. Therefore, it’s recommended that people rotate between different strains and take breaks to minimize tolerance buildup.

Methods of Consumption
Toss and Wash: In this method, powdered kratom is taken directly into the mouth then washed down with a glass of water or juice. It works well, but the stomach can sometimes be a problem.
Tea: Making kratom into tea is a more convenient form of consumption and it’s gentler on the stomach. However, it may reduce the potency of the effects.
Capsules: These are so convenient and tasteless while ingesting. Ideal for those who do not like the taste of the Kratom powder.
Extracts: These are concentrated forms of kratom. They provide much stronger effects, yet less in quantity. They are suitable for those experienced users looking for more potent effects.
Different strains and dosages lead to a wide range of effects from this herb:

Red Vein is good for pain relief and relaxation.
Green Vein is for a balance between these two feelings.
White Vein is for stimulation and better focus.
If one understands the differences in them, they can choose the right strain to meet their needs and improve on the gains of kratom.

Today, a typical example.

We (my husband, my son (who is 4) and I) went to meet another family. I thought we would just eat lunch and go, but for some reason, they booked this place you  stay for 4 hours. This is already my idea of hell because I hate sitting around eating and talking anyway, but we don't even know these people. 

Also, just to add, we live in Korea and my Korean is functional but I'm far from fluent so when we are all talking Korean, I get exhausted.

First, I go to tell the kids that they shouldn't play in this drained swimming pool that was there because there were literal planks of wood with nails in it. When I said I was going, the other mum tells me not to worry and they're fine. OK obviously I still go to tell them but every time they would go back there and every time I told them to stop, she would say they're fine. If she wants her kid to stand on a rusty nail, that's her lookout but I don't know why she thinks she can tell me what to do. (She then later told them to stop playing on a swing because it was dangerous. Yeah.)

Second. About 2 hours into this, I tell my husband I want to go. The other kid is playing too roughly and my son is starting to copy his bad behavior. My husband says ""ok we'll just drink coffee and go."" I'm like...OK? An hour later we're still there and I see my son acting worse and this other kid being a total brat (eg smacking my son's butt, splashing him with water etc of course I told him to stop each time and got my son away.) I tell my husband OK we really have to go and he says ""10 more minutes, it's awkward to just leave."" (In case you can't tell he also has boundary issues.)

We were in the middle of nowhere with one car so no option to just leave. 

In these situations, HOW do I set boundaries? Like what am I supposed to say to all involved? People always say ""set boundaries""and I just don't know how.

Please be gentle, I'm crying so much because I feel like the world's most pathetic person.

This week alone, I:
- Kept finishing the sentences of a senior executive who already doesn't think much of me. She said a few blunt things to me in a meeting, that had two colleagues remark on how rude she was. My ND brain didn't even catch the insults or understood why they were so shocked by them.
- Missed two deadlines and sent materials last minute. I was aware of both diary dates but for some reason felt like I had enough time. Last month I forgot about a presentation and had to scramble one together. 
- Rushed preparing materials which made me late because I couldn't figure out the new printer.
- Just before we were about to leave for another meeting, I spilled water all over my desk and my phone in front of my manager, who remarked on how dusty my workstation was.
- I downplayed our role in an upcoming meeting thinking the senior executive would lead it. Turns out, she had me lead this delicate meeting with anxious clients. I was in the hot seat (a position that would normally fall to my manager, but she is too new). I was also 2 minutes late because I rarely drive, had to drive a very new company car and turned off the wrong exit, much to the displeasure of the senior executive.
-I didn't write down the address of the meeting, and told my manager the wrong location. She had the foresight to call a colleague to double check.
- I left my parka at said meeting. The executive was made aware by the client and told me to drive back 40 min to get it.
- Couldn't find my nice work clothes for these meetings, on account of how messy my apartment is.
- Drove 5 hours to another client meeting with a colleague where I chatted her ear off. She nearly jumped out of the car when we got back. I forgot my nice work shoes and showed up to the meeting with dirty tennis shoes, again to the displeasure of the senior exec.
- Cracked a few jokes with the clients that did not land well. The senior executive made a comment that I was ""cringe"", but tried to backtrack. She stopped acknowledging me and focused her attention on my colleagues.
- I offered to drive back from the meeting, but when we stopped for coffee my employee insisted on taking over driving. I think my driving made her nervous.
- I overreacted to a couple things my manager said because I'm so sensitive these days.

I worked so hard this week on prepping the materials and trying to dress and look the part of a professional. I work so hard for this senior exec, only to come across as a total buffoon every time.

1gn4ur4,https://www.reddit.com/r/EconomyKitchen/comments/1gn4ur4/how_to_reduce_kitchen_cleaning_time_and_gained/,How To Reduce Kitchen Cleaning Time And Gained More Peace,"Ever find yourself stuck in the kitchen, caught up in an endless cycle of dishes and clutter? I sure did. Between preparing meals, cleaning up, and constantly running the dishwasher, I realized I was spending more time in the kitchen than with my family. And it wasn’t just the physical time—it was the mental load of constantly thinking about the mess. After some reflection (and a few moments of frustration), I realized that the key to fixing this wasn’t simply cleaning faster. It was simplifying everything. By embracing a minimalist approach to my kitchen, I’ve significantly reduced my cleaning time, gained more space, and—most importantly—spent more quality time with my loved ones. Here’s how I did it, step by step:

### 1\. Evaluate What You Actually Use

The first step in minimizing your kitchen is taking a hard look at everything you own. No, really. Pull out everything: utensils, cups, plates, gadgets, you name it. It’s time to ask yourself the tough questions: “Do I use this? When’s the last time I actually reached for this?” In my case, I had several gadgets—like a popcorn maker and a fancy avocado slicer—that I never used. While they’re fun to have, they were just taking up valuable space and collecting dust. I decided to pack them away in storage, and trust me, I haven’t missed them once. The goal is to keep only the items you actually use on a regular basis. This gives you more space to work with, reduces clutter, and ultimately saves you cleaning time since there’s less to wash.

### 2\. Cut Down by Half

Once you’ve cleared out the unnecessary items, it’s time to take things a step further. Look at what’s left and challenge yourself to reduce that by half. Do you really need 14 coffee mugs? Could you get by with just five? At first, this seemed extreme to me, but I quickly saw the benefit. The fewer items you have, the less likely you are to create a pile of dirty dishes. Why? Well, when you’ve only got a handful of forks, cups, or plates, you’ll be more likely to clean them right away instead of grabbing a new one every time. It’s all about reducing that “convenience factor” that makes it easy to let dishes pile up. Sure, I kept a few extra items for special occasions or when we have guests over. But the key here is that these are stored away and only brought out when needed.

### 3\. Set Up a Simple System

Now comes the fun part: creating a system that works for you. This doesn’t need to be complicated—it’s all about consistency. For me, I came up with a daily routine that fit seamlessly into our family’s schedule.

*   **Morning**: Unload the dishwasher first thing (3-5 minutes). Throughout the day, any dirty dishes go straight into the dishwasher or are hand-washed right away.
*   **Post-Meal**: After meals, dishes go directly into the dishwasher, and anything that can’t go in gets hand-washed and set aside (takes about 10 minutes total).
*   **End of Day**: Before bed, I do a quick wipe-down of the counters and sweep the floor (another 5 minutes).

The goal is not to spend all day cleaning but to stay on top of things by cleaning as you go. It’s a routine, but it doesn’t feel like one. And by sticking to it, I’ve managed to cut my kitchen cleaning time from an hour a day down to about 20 minutes.

### 4\. Tweak and Refine Your System

No system is perfect from day one, and you’ll likely need to tweak things as you go along. Maybe you find you need an extra set of plates for a big meal or realize you’ve been keeping too few utensils. Don’t be afraid to adjust and experiment with what works best for you. I also found that involving my kids in the process helped. We set up a “Montessori-style” cupboard where they can grab their own plates and cups and help clean up after meals. It’s been a win-win: they get to feel independent, and I get a little extra help!",1,1731137388.0,EconomyKitchen,0,1.0,False

Two days down, 28 to go.

Today didn't sting as much as it did the past few days. I still miss you. I've been looking for your trace in all the places we've gone to here. I passed by Starbucks today and it gave me a fond memory of that morning we had breakfast.

I used to hate your area. The noise, the traffic, the dirt. Not a wonder I found myself trapped in the basement of Ali Mall one morning, trying to find my way into Starbucks. It would've normally been such an irritating moment, if it weren't for that laughter you gave me when you saw my clueless face. I dunno, something about the way your eyes smile when you do, that made me find my frustration evaporating into, well, mirth, if you could call it that.

I would have loved to have treated you to your coffee, but you already had a cup in your hand. And so I ordered my drink, that Orange Espresso, which you absolutely hated.

:)

Would it have been so bad to just keep having breakfast like this? I wouldn't really want to steal time away from you and your family, but this, this is something I would hold closely in my heart, for when breakfast becomes too draining with the promise of the day's stress.

One day, maybe, you can tell me why you just chose to remove yourself from our little secret life. Maybe we can talk about it over breakfast?

For a moment I started panicking and at one point thought I was dying and my soul was leaving my body!!! Anyway, has anyone ever experienced anything similar to this?

Where do I go from here.,"My wife(28F) and I (31M) have had a few far worse arguments/fights before this one, and I really thought things had finally changed and our relationship was on the right track. 

For context, my wife has anger problems and she has hit me, shoved me, flipped over our coffee table, threw glass cups on the kitchen floor, and slammed her head into the ground multiple times (she ended up getting a concussion). She hasn’t ever actually “hurt” me physically as she is not very strong, but I do realize this is still technically abuse.

After she flipped the coffee table and broke all the glass, I sat her down the next day and told her this was unacceptable and that hitting me or throwing things out of the heat of an argument was not going to happen one more time. 

Things were much better after this for quite a while, and we ended up having a daughter who just turned one a few weeks ago.

This brings us to what just happened a few hours ago:

We were having a discussion about some relationship issues and trying to see how we can spend more quality time together and she started to get extremely emotional. It was midnight and I was exhausted. Continuing this would only escalate things and not end well, so I told her I needed to go to sleep and that we can continue talking tomorrow when we are both in a better headspace. She just stared at me, so I asked her if she still needed to brush her teeth or if she was ready for bed. She said she still needed to brush her teeth, but continued staring at me. After a few minutes, I asked her if she could please brush her teeth so that we can go to sleep. She continued to stare at me, so I turned the lights off and closed my eyes. She ignored the fact that I told her I need to go to sleep and continued arguing. I told her I am not going to continue this right now and that I am going to bed. She then walks into the bathroom, turns on the light, and begins hysterically sobbing for the next 30 minutes. By this point I am very tired and starting to fall asleep. She walks out of the bathroom, walks over me in bed, grabs our dog’s water bowl and fills it up in the bathroom. She walks out of the bathroom with the bowl full of water and says “So you’re asleep right? You won’t mind if I dump this water on you, since you’re asleep right?”. I refuse to take the bait and continue trying to go to sleep. When she realizes I am sticking to my boundary, she dumps the water all over my face. At this point, I open my eyes, sit up and wipe the water off my face. She muttered some other things, but I can’t remember what they were. I got out of bed, put on shorts, a shirt, grabbed my phone and walked downstairs. I grabbed my keys and wallet, put on my sandals and walked out the door. 

How do I move forward from this? The last thing I want to do is go through a divorce as we have a baby together. ",4,1731136754.0,Marriage,7,1.0,False

We need you, YOU to go to bars. With a couple friends, with your brother, with your mom, all by yourself. Western society has historically been centered around the bar. Revisionists will pretend that it was the local church but if you take into consideration the number of people who would have been ostracized or excommunicated from their churches for a number of what we would now consider minor infractions, then really the one place that all of society was regularly encountering each other would have been the local bar, pub, roadhouse, what have you. We hear regularly about how alienated and disenfranchised people feel from their respective communities. However, as the culture changes, more and more often people tend to stick within their respective bubbles. You hang out with yours same couple friends, maybe you foot to the club a once or twice a month. Maybe you stay home, watch your twitch stream, scroll on your phone. But none of this is actually interaction. Not with the other members of your community.  Not with people who are obviously different than you. Your local bar, the place with PBR on special and greasy fried foods that kind of make out feel like shit the next day, is a true melting pot. Go bump shoulders with that weird old guy, the one that’s probably been at the bar since before it was built. Talk to the waitress with the bad neck tattoo. Spill your drink on a cute stranger. Do fucking something to connect with your fellow human being. We all have so much more in common, so many places we can find middle ground. Just got make a new friend for fuck sake. Please for the love of god, try as best as you can, to leave your phone alone for a couple hours. I have a friend who regularly reminds me that I should “touch grass” but honestly fuck grass, touch people. Let people touch you. For those of you who don’t drink alcohol, coffee shops work too.

[i have tickets for the 22nd, but REALLY want to go the 23rd]

also seen quite a few posts and comments of people traveling from out of town for the stuffing so here's some recommendations of mine as an east atlanta local! 
late night- 
-flatiron (trophy room has a pool table upstairs) dive bar with loud metal music and bartenders that might be a little mean to you but in a way that makes you thank them. patio can be busy on weekends but super good for socializing and being around lots of people. definitely more of a tattooed alt crowd which is what i lean towards 
-97 estoria- large outside sit down patio, cheap drinks, walk-up bar, lots of graffiti and next to krog tunnel 
-octopus bar - one of my FAVORITE places in the city. it's only open from 10:30pm-2:30am with a delicious and mildly boujie daily rotating menu. where else can you get oysters and seared duck breast and a fancy salad at 2am???? 
food!
-woodys cheesesteaks- open until 4am on weekends
-ok-yaki - i always say it feels like a hip asian fusion waffle house (there's barstool seats and open flat top kitchen), try the untitled art seltzers and okonomiyaki! 
-fritti- brick oven individual pizzas, super good gluten free crust 
-java lords- coffee shop in little 5 points that's open until evenings 
-little tart - known in town to have the absolute best pastries and coffees, multiple locations 
e-ramen for the best ramen(gluten free available too), gu's dumplings in krog street market for spicy pork dumplings, whoopsies for craft cocktails and rotating menu of elevated american food, vesper for craft cocktails and game boards/ chess, joystick or virgils for an arcade bar, MJQ for a dance vibe, marys or my sisters room for a lesbian/gay bar, umai for the best takeout sushi but wagaya for dine-in sushi, little spirit for craft cocktails, lottafrutta for smoothies, manny's has darts, good bar food and the kitchens open late. muchacho and barcelona are honorable mentions. 
-pure quill superette- simple food done extremely extremely well in a vintage deli style. only serves food before 3pm
if you wanna be fancy fancy- kinjo room or gypsy kitchen 
i'd recommend a classic view from piedmont park, oakland cemetery or the aquarium if you have time!

Newbie to the cruise world so forgive any newbie quesitons. Would greatly appreciate any feedback! 

1. We recently booked a 7 day Caribbean cruise with Celebrity on their Ascent boat! We paid $2,300 all in with fees. No packages. Considering we booked this for a cruise that sails within the next 10 days, did we do ok? 

2. We opted to skip on the drink packages.. we don’t drink much and couldn’t justify the $600 per person charge. We even looked at the non-alcoholic packages and that was still close to $350 per person. Assuming we receive water, I can’t image us spending more than $100 a day on drinks. (2 coffees, 2-4 smoothie/soft drinks throughout the day, possibly 4-5 water bottles at most?) 

3. Flying in the day of. Is this stupid or ??? 

4. I have a mini dish starlink. Would be nice to bring on board. Is that possible? 

Thank you ahead of time! ",1,1731136090.0,Cruises,1,1.0,False

","After years of waiting and watching coffee reels and shorts I finally got one a few weeks before! I went to buy the cheapest model because everything else was in the professional range or just too expensive and nothing else in the, 'budget' range. 

Putting in the portafilter in the first few uses was a challenge because it was too damn tight, but a little olive oil and few uses and it got smoother. Other than that I, as a beginner to the field, really enjoyed myself and thought it was super cool. I was like the kid outside of the candy store that kept eyeing the candy inside through the glass window😭.

Now which brings me to what I wanted to ask. Since I have little idea or experience about the world of coffee enthusiasts, I want to get some input from those who are more experienced. 

Is the DeLonghi Dedica E685 a decent purchase for me as a beginner, who just likes to enjoy an espresso and a cup of beautiful cappuccino. What are it's strengths? What are the weaknesses? And what is the most I can utilize with this machine. ",7,1731135920.0,espresso,16,1.0,False

Hey everyone. I wanted to share a personal story, because maybe someone out there is in the same place I was—a place of avoiding, doubting, and feeling like genuine connections are meant for other people.

For years, I stayed in my comfort zone. It was easy, safe, and familiar. I’d tell myself things like, ""I’m just not a social person,"" or ""I’m not the type to make friends easily."" And you know what? I believed it. I thought that maybe I was just meant to coast along without the connections I saw other people forming so effortlessly. But deep down, I knew I wanted more. I wanted to feel connected, valued, and… seen. So one day, I decided to do something different.

I signed up for a local meetup event—a simple coffee gathering with people I’d never met before. Walking in was nerve-wracking. My heart was racing, and I had this urge to turn around and leave, but I forced myself to walk through those doors. I ordered a coffee, took a deep breath, and walked over to the group, feeling totally out of my element.

At first, it was rough. I was surrounded by strangers, feeling awkward and overthinking every word. But then, something happened. Someone laughed at a story I told. Someone else asked me about my favorite book. Slowly, I realized these were just people, people like me, wanting to connect, to share, to be seen. And maybe, just maybe, they were feeling just as nervous as I was.

I kept going to these meetups. Each time, it got a little easier. I didn’t become a social butterfly overnight, but I started feeling a bit more comfortable. I even joined a hiking group, something I’d always wanted to try but felt too shy to do. And on one of those hikes, I ended up having a deep conversation with someone who has since become a good friend.

Here's what I learned from my journey out of my comfort zone:

&nbsp;

**1. It’s never as scary as you think** The anticipation is always worse than the reality. Once you’re in the moment, you realize that most people are kind and open, just waiting for someone to take the first step.

&nbsp;

**2. Every small interaction builds confidence**. Even if it feels insignificant, every smile, every conversation, every “hello” chips away at that wall we build around ourselves. You’re practicing, and every attempt counts.

&nbsp;

**3. Rejection is part of the process**. Not every interaction will lead to a friendship, and that’s okay. Some people just won’t click, and it’s not a reflection of your worth. Just keep showing up, because the right connections are out there, waiting for you to find them.

&nbsp;

**4. Celebrate the small wins**. I used to think success meant having a big group of friends, but now I realize that every small connection is a victory. It’s not about quantity; it’s about finding those few people who really understand you.

&nbsp;

If you’re like I was, feeling isolated and unsure, my advice is simple: take that first step, however small. Go to that event, join that group, ask that person to coffee. It won’t be easy at first, and it won’t always go perfectly, but every attempt matters. Every step is worth it.

Let’s keep pushing ourselves out of our comfort zones and towards real connection. If I could do it, I know you can too. You’re not alone in this, and there’s a whole world of people out there just waiting to meet you.

1gn4cil,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1gn4cil/sfhm_waltz_of_hooves/,[SF][HM] Waltz of Hooves,"Not complete yet, open to feedback though:

The air from a Dave and Busters hvac can turn a man to ice. I always get sweaty when I get cold. I’m not sure why, but it was bothering me. Just one more race and I’ll be good to leave. The lights are out, but I asked a friend if I could stay late. My horse Jonathan needs my care. 

Prior to the race, I have to take Jonathan on a training course. We go over hurdles one at a time. His dark brown mane glowed in the digital sunlight. I took him to the stable and washed him. I brushed his hair and I loved him. The race began, but this time we came in fourth place. It’s okay. It’s just me and Jonathan and that’s all that matters.

I say goodnight to Jonathan and upload his save data into my paper memory bank. I get up off the bench and understand I can’t see him until tomorrow. The janitor comes by and I give him the okay to turn off the Derby Owners Club machine. 

Heading back to my car I realize it is 2 in the morning and I’m in a parking lot in Farmingdale, New york. Where did the day go? I ask myself. The cold winter air contacts my sweaty skin and sends a chill down my spine. The moon shines through the clouds and some small raindrops hit my forehead. I drove off and hit the first McDonalds I saw.

McChicken, McDouble, Large Coke, small french fry. This is my usual order. Glorietta from the drive thru asks me how Jonathan is doing. He’s great I say. I took him to the stable and washed his beautiful brown mane. “That horse is something special.” Glorietta says. I pay with cash and tell Glorietta to keep the change. 

I pulled into the parking lot to eat my food and plan for my tasks ahead for tomorrow. I need to take Jonathan to the doctor. He was running out of steam today. The paper memory bank containing Jonathan's data was safe in my back pocket. I take it out and look at it. There is a beautiful picture of him on the card. The pixels that make up this horse were nothing short of a miracle, and I felt it in my bones. I drove to the nearest Walmart parking lot, climbed into the back seat and slept until the sun came out.

I drove back to McDonalds for breakfast. Small coffee, and two bacon mcgriddles. I love those little syrup infusions they do in the pancakes. I pick up my food and smile to Gloriettas twin sister Jessica who works the day shift. Jessica is Glorietta’s identical twin, but is somehow ten times as beautiful. I stutter on my words and Jessica hands me the order.

I decided to eat my breakfast by the water. I drive down to Wantagh park and post up by the crab traps. I thought I saw a dolphin, but it was probably just a wave. A friend of mine, Angelo, keeps his boat at the Marina here and lets me crash on it sometimes. I really needed a shower, I stunk to high heaven, so I decided to do that in the bathroom sink of the boat. I keep some soap in my trunk just for the occasion.

Before the shower I put Jonathan's data bank on the kitchen table. When I came out it was gone. I panicked for a moment, but then I saw Angelo with it in the corner. “When did you get here?” I said. “About yesterday.” Angelo exclaimed. “The data in this card is worth a thousand of these boats.” “We all love Jonathan, but we need the money.”

This was not going to work. I punched Angelo right in the gut and hog tied him in the living room of the boat. (Quite a big boat I forgot to mention). Jonathan was mine and there was nothing Angelo could do. 

Angelo was there when Jonathan was created. We made him together, but I was the one that fed him and cared for him. I was the one that was there for him when he needed me the most. When his hair got dirty I cleaned him. When he needed training I trained him.

Angelo looked upset, but I duct taped his mouth shut, so I don’t know what he thinks. Me and Jonathan got back into the car and headed for the dave and busters. 

I usually show up when they open at noon, but I was late today because of Angelo. I check in at the front desk and head straight for the Derby Owners Club machine. Something wasn’t right though.

The screen was black and no one was sitting in the stands. Something happened last night. The janitor fried the motherboard. I was heartbroken. How could this be? The associate at customer service said that the machines are being phased out and there will be no more derby owners club at dave and busters.

My heart dropped and I rushed for the door. I called every dave and busters in the tri state area and they all told me the same thing. My manic episode is starting. My rage consumed me and everything went dark. All I could think of was Jonathans beautiful brown mane and the way his little legs jumped over those hurdles.

“I’ll see you again buddy” I say while clutching the memory bank. I drive to the first McDonalds I can see and order. Bacon cheeseburger, vanilla milkshake, and a filet-o-fish. I drown my sorrows in greasy burgers. 

Glorietta came out to my car and wanted to know what was wrong. I told her that Jonathan will never be able to live again. She said she knew a secret. I really wanted to know the secret so I asked, “What secret?”.

She told me her friend had transcended this world to fully engulf herself into the digital utopia of derby owners club. There is a christian science church on the corner of hempstead turnpike and Eisenhower park. I realized this might be the way to see Jonathan again.

The experiments performed here have been in the news lately, but the cops seem to leave them alone due to religious freedom. I’m jewish, but I decided to check out this church.

Upon arrival, the priest asks me where I come from. I said “You don’t wanna know, buddy.”. “I heard you've got a way to transcend this world, and upload myself to the Derby Owners Club heaven server.” “There is a way, but you must devote yourself to the teachings of Jesus Christ.”. I was desperate. Jonathan needed me, so I did what I had to.

I started going to Sunday school every week. I was the oldest person in the class by far. I learned all about Jesus and his disciples. I learned that Mary Magdalene was Jesus’s girlfriend. I learned that Jesus came back on Easter. I learned that the Virgin Mary was Jesus’s mom. I gained all the knowledge I needed to pass my final exam. I did this with flying colors. Pretty soon I was starting to feel like I was Jesus.

I was doing this for Jonathan. He was the only thing I cared about. The only thing I could set my mind to. I returned to the christian science church and showed the priest my diploma from sunday school. “You are officially one of us,” the priest exclaimed. This made me smile. I never felt like I belonged anywhere and now I finally do. The goal was Jonathan though. I needed to get to him and quick.

The priest led me to the giant crucifix in the back of the church. Jesus looked down on me disappointingly from above as he hung there by his wrists. The priest took me around the back and opened a secret door. “Step in and hold tight”. I enter the back of the crucifix and see a chair with body straps. I decide to strap myself in and a countdown begins. The ceiling opened up and I could see the stars. Jonathans data bank was in my back pocket, so I took it out and prayed. I prayed as hard as I could that I would be able to see Jonathan again. The miracle horse with the dark brown mane. I could feel my heart starting to race and suddenly the sky started to get closer. “I hope they have McDonalds where we're going Jonathan.”

I (36m) always had trouble making friends. I'm autistic and kind of a loner. I knew of this person in highschool, but never really talked to them. After highschool, I somehow rekindled (?) with them. I think we were trying to make a movie or do something, but I somehow got in touch with them. We immediately hit it off and spent the next 2 years spending a ton of time together. Basically hanging out, getting coffee together every night. We talked about EVERYTHING. life, love, schooling, future goals, past regrets, just everything you can imagine.there was just one problem. If they had a significant other, i didn't. If I had a sisignificant other, they didn't. We definitely loved each other, deeply. We slept together a time or two, but nothing came of it. Eventually, they moved to a different state, but we somewhat stayed in contact. We lost contact for a little bit, only for me to receive an email that they had a child. I was with someone who I absolutely loved, but I was excited for them. Eventually things happened and we alstarted talking more. I drove to them a time or two a year.
 The last time I saw them, I regretted it, though. We had such an amazing time. They took me to all these fantastic hikes, locations, and absolutely gorgeous places. Their parents loved me and kept asking me to stay. I, unfortunately couldn't, due to prior engagements. We made absolute passionate love the last night I saw my best friend and they begged me to stay, saying they would help with whatever they could. I had to make the choice to either stay alive or choose the unknown in a different state. I chose to stay alive. So, as soon as I returned home, I found out that my ex best friend couldn't handle it and decided to overdose. I'm starting to tear up as I write this, but I've never been able to express it before. Their parents never blamed me and I take some kind of solace in that. But fuck, do i ever miss my friend. I wish things were different. I was completely ready to spend my life with them and I was stupid enough to choose sobriety over them. 
   If anyone actually reads this, thank you. I'll never forget them and never forgive myself. I know it honestly wasn't all my fault, but i still feel 100% guilt.",1,1731135085.0,ExBestFriends,0,1.0,False

So we went home, and that was exactly what we did: have a mental health day. While Parker put his feet up with a mug of coffee, Penelope and I had a little 'us time'. We did some painting together, and while Penelope made a pretty marvellous masterpiece, I did some messy hand painting, which came in useful at one point. Later, we both had a luxurious bath with lots of bubbles - for me, it was to wash off all the paint on my body, and we just relaxed and felt the water loosen our muscles.

Would you still consider approaching one in a Cafe as intrusive or creepy as approaching one on the streets?,"I (23M) am an FA who lives in Bangalore in India but born in Siliguri in West Bengal in India(I am mentioning where I live just for a more clear context) and I never approached a random Indian woman in a Cafe or any public place and as I am studying MBA, I just meet Indian women in my University. But I have approached foreign women in Cafes who are expats in our city. Yes, Bangalore is the major IT hub(often called the Silicon Valley of India) so a lot of foreigners do come here as expats. I approached 4 such expat women so far who were complete strangers and they were all white Caucasian women but didn't ask them for a date.

There is a higher concentration of expats in this luxurious mall in our city named UB City as its one of the most upscale neighborhood in our city. Just recently about 2 weeks ago, I had a good conversation with this blonde German woman. I saw her sitting alone in the Cafe named Cafe Noir which is a French style cafe and I went there alone too so I approached her and initiated conversation with her and she was really friendly and attractive and we had a good conversation and she is an expat here but unfortunately didn't even ask her socials as I was worried she might get uncomfortable as we just met but it boosted my mood and confidence.

Almost 3 months ago, I met another expat woman in UB City itself but in a different Cafe called Third Wave Coffee and she is an American. She was working in her laptop and after ordering my cold coffee, I initiated a conversation with her and she too was friendly to me and we had an even longer conversation and talked about many topics. I even asked her Instagram but unfortunately she said she doesn't use Instagram and I didn't want to ask her number as we just met but overall it was an amazing conversation and boosted my mood and made me happy. It also made me proud as I was super shy near girls throughout high school and my undergrads unable to even keep eye contact with girls but now at 23 I am able to talk with women both in my MBA and also the expat women.

1gn3yu5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gn3yu5/i_regret_entering_the_abandoned_mansion_the/,I Regret Entering the Abandoned Mansion... The Paintings Were Watching Me.,"You might think I’m stupid for posting this, admitting to a crime. And yeah, you’re probably right. But I don’t care anymore. The person I used to be, the guy who broke into a stranger’s home for thrills and a quick payday? He’s long gone. My name doesn’t matter—you can call me whatever you want. Let’s just say this is your anonymous warning.

This all started three years ago, back when I was still pulling small-time jobs, mostly houses in affluent neighborhoods. I wasn’t a mastermind or anything, just someone with sticky fingers and a knack for finding ways inside. When I heard about the abandoned Greystone Mansion, I thought it was the perfect score. The place had been sitting empty for decades, and rumors swirled about treasures left behind by the original owners.

Of course, there were also stories about why no one stayed in the mansion for long. Ghosts, curses, people vanishing without a trace—your usual small-town nonsense. But I figured those stories kept the amateurs out, leaving more for me. I drove out one moonless night with a flashlight, a crowbar, and a backpack, ready to haul away anything that looked remotely valuable.

The mansion sat in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by overgrown trees and weeds as tall as me. The windows were mostly shattered, and ivy climbed its walls like nature was trying to reclaim the place. Inside, the air was heavy with the smell of mildew, and every step I took on the creaking floorboards echoed through the silence.

I hit the usual spots first—drawers, cabinets, anything that might hold old jewelry or forgotten cash. Found nothing but dust and rats. Still, I wasn’t ready to give up. The mansion was huge, with more rooms than I could count. There had to be something worth taking.

That’s when I saw the portraits.

They lined the walls of a long hallway on the second floor, each one larger than life and painted with unnerving detail. At first, I thought they were just your typical old-money portraits—stuffy men in suits, stern-looking women in elegant dresses. But the longer I looked, the more they unsettled me.

The faces weren’t just detailed; they were too lifelike. The paint seemed to glisten in the faint light of my flashlight, and the eyes... God, the eyes. They followed me wherever I went, their gazes drilling into my back even when I wasn’t looking at them directly.

But that wasn’t what stopped me in my tracks. No, what froze me to the spot was the last portrait in the hallway.

It was blank.

At first, I thought it was just an empty frame, but when I stepped closer, I saw faint outlines—shapes that seemed to shift and twist the longer I stared. And at the bottom of the frame, there was a small brass plaque with a single word etched into it: *“Unfinished.”*

A cold dread started creeping over me, but I shook it off. This was just a painting, I told myself. A creepy one, sure, but just a painting. I turned to leave the hallway, but something caught my eye—a small, leather-bound book sitting on a pedestal near the blank portrait.

Curiosity got the better of me. The book looked ancient, its pages yellowed and brittle. The text was handwritten in a language I didn’t recognize, though some of it looked like Latin. Near the back of the book was a crude drawing of the hallway I was standing in, complete with the portraits—and a set of instructions.

The words were written in shaky English:  
*""Stand before the Unfinished. Speak the names of the Chosen. Do not falter.""*

I should have left right then and there. Tossed the book, bolted down the stairs, and never looked back. But I didn’t.

Instead, I flipped back through the book, scanning the faded text for any mention of these ""Chosen."" There they were—names, dozens of them, written in a tight, slanted script. They were eerily familiar, though I couldn’t place where I’d heard them before.

Then, almost without thinking, I found myself standing in front of the blank portrait, the book open in my hands.

As I stared at the empty canvas, my flashlight flickered and died, plunging the hallway into darkness. The silence pressed in on me like a weight, and for a moment, I considered running. But something held me there—a morbid curiosity, maybe, or sheer stupidity.

I whispered the first name on the list.

Nothing happened.

Then the second name.

Still nothing.

But as I spoke the third, I heard it—a faint rustling, like fabric brushing against the walls. The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end as the sound grew louder, circling me, closing in.

I fumbled for my flashlight, but it wouldn’t turn on. My heart pounded as I flipped through the book, trying to figure out what I’d unleashed. That’s when I felt it—a presence behind me, so close I could feel its breath on my neck.

I spun around, but there was nothing there. Just the portraits, their eyes gleaming in the darkness.

No, not just the portraits.

They were moving.

The figures inside the frames shifted and writhed, their painted expressions twisting into something unrecognizable. Their eyes burned with a malevolent light, and one by one, they began to step out of their frames.

Panic surged through me as I dropped the book and ran, the sound of footsteps—no, *many* footsteps—chasing me down the hallway.

I didn’t stop until I was out of the mansion, my chest heaving and my hands trembling. I never went back for the book, and I’ve spent every day since trying to convince myself it was all just a bad dream.

But I know the truth.

The eyes in those portraits weren’t just paintings. They were people—real people, trapped in those frames, waiting for someone stupid enough to set them free.

And the worst part?

When I got back to my car, I caught my reflection in the window.

For just a split second, my face didn’t look like my own.

It looked like a painting.

I didn’t go back to the mansion right away. For weeks, I kept telling myself to move on, to forget. But ignoring what happened wasn’t as easy as I thought it would be.

It started small. At first, I’d feel like someone was standing behind me when I was alone. Just a faint pressure, like the air shifting. I told myself it was paranoia, the fallout of a bad break-in that shook me up.

Then things got worse.

It wasn’t just a feeling anymore. I began to notice people watching me—or at least, I thought they were. A guy sitting across from me on the bus would stare until I turned to meet his eyes. Then he’d suddenly glance away, like nothing had happened. In line at the coffee shop, a woman behind me would shift uncomfortably, her head angled slightly in my direction. When I turned, she’d be looking at the menu, her face calm and unreadable.

At first, I chalked it up to coincidence. The mind plays tricks when you’re on edge, right? But it kept happening.

It wasn’t just random strangers, either. It was everyone.

Even people I knew—friends, acquaintances, the guy at the bodega who rang me up every morning—they all started to do it. I’d catch them looking at me from the corner of my eye, their expressions blank, neutral. But when I turned my head, they’d act like nothing had happened.

And then there were the smiles.

Not big ones. Not obvious. Just the faintest curl of their lips, like they were sharing some private joke I wasn’t in on. It was subtle, almost imperceptible—but once I noticed, I couldn’t unsee it.

They all looked like they knew something.

By the end of the second month, I’d stopped sleeping. Every time I closed my eyes, I’d picture the hallway in the mansion, the way the portraits had moved, their hollow faces and grasping hands. I knew it wasn’t over. Whatever I’d set free, it was still with me.

I finally broke one night after a particularly bad encounter. I was walking home from the grocery store, arms weighed down by bags, when I passed an old man sitting on a bench. He wasn’t doing anything—just sitting there, staring straight ahead.

As I passed, I glanced at him, and his head turned to follow me.

It wasn’t a normal movement. It was too smooth, too precise. Like the way the portraits had moved.

I stopped dead in my tracks, the plastic bags digging into my hands. The old man didn’t blink.

“Can I help you?” I asked, trying to sound casual, but my voice cracked on the last word.

He didn’t answer. He just smiled. Not a warm smile, not a kind one—just that faint, knowing curl of his lips.

I staggered, the bag slipping from my grip as a few cans clattered to the ground. I didn’t stop to pick them up—I just left them behind and ran the rest of the way home.

The next morning, I packed my things. I couldn’t explain it, but I knew staying in the city wasn’t safe anymore. Maybe it was paranoia, but I didn’t care. I moved to a new town, rented a cheap room in a run-down motel, and tried to start over.

For a while, it worked.

The people here were friendly but distant. I kept my head down, took odd jobs to pay the bills, and avoided unnecessary conversations. For the first time in months, I felt almost normal again.

But it didn’t last.

One day, I was fixing a fence for a farmer on the edge of town when I felt it again—that prickle on the back of my neck. The feeling of being watched. I glanced up, and there was a woman standing at the edge of the field, half-hidden by the tall grass.

She wasn’t moving.

Her face was partially obscured, but I could tell she was staring right at me.

I called out to her, but she didn’t respond. She just turned and walked away, vanishing into the grass without a sound.

That night, I sat on the edge of my bed, staring at my hands. The scar on my palm from the night I shattered the display case in an antique shop had healed into a thin white line, but it still throbbed whenever I thought about the mansion.

I realized then that running wasn’t going to help.

Whatever this was, it wasn’t tied to a place. It was tied to me.

I guess something in me snapped that night. Maybe it was desperation, or maybe I thought destroying the mansion would sever the connection. I didn’t plan it—I just acted.

I grabbed a can of gasoline from the shed behind my motel and drove back to Greystone in the dead of night. The mansion loomed ahead, its silhouette even darker against the moonless sky. The air was heavy, suffocating, as I stepped inside.

The portraits were waiting, their painted eyes alive with something far worse than malice. I couldn’t bring myself to look too closely, afraid I’d see them move again. Their gazes followed me down the hall as I worked, splashing gasoline on the walls, the floors, and the ornate frames that held those cursed faces.

When I reached for the matchbox, my hands were trembling so badly that I dropped it. It hit the floor with a clatter, spilling matches in every direction. My heart nearly stopped as I watched the tiny sticks scatter across the soaked floorboards, a few skittering dangerously close to the gasoline.

I cursed under my breath, trying to keep my cool and avoid stepping on the gasoline—because that would be a really bad idea. Crouching low, I grabbed the nearest match that hadn’t been doused. My fingers fumbled as the oppressive silence seemed to press in, my heartbeat loud in my ears.

With shaking hands, I struck it.

The flame sputtered to life, impossibly bright in the darkness. Without a second thought, I tossed it onto the gasoline-soaked floor and scrambled back as the fire erupted in a wave of heat and light.

The fire roared to life, devouring everything in its path. The portraits twisted and warped in the heat, their colors bleeding and melting into one another.

For a moment, I thought I heard them screaming.

I didn’t stick around to find out.

I ran in a panic, the flames roaring at my heels as I sprinted toward the door. When I finally stumbled outside, the mansion was engulfed, its windows glowing like fiery eyes piercing the night. I stood there, gasping for breath, watching as the inferno devoured everything.

I went home to my apartment believing it was over—that I’d destroyed whatever evil had taken hold of that place.

I couldn’t have been more wrong.

The next morning, I went back to Greystone.

Or at least, what was left of it. The fire I’d set had gutted the mansion completely, leaving behind little more than a pile of ash and charred stone. The front steps still stood, blackened but intact, leading up to nothing but sky.

I stood there for a long time, staring at the ruins, trying to figure out what to do. Then I saw it.

Amid the rubble, something caught the light. A glint of metal.

I climbed over the crumbling remains of the doorway and picked my way through the wreckage. When I reached the spot where the hallway had been, I found it: a brass plaque, scorched but still legible.

*""Unfinished.""*

My stomach turned.

I didn’t touch it. I didn’t want to risk taking anything from this place ever again. But as I stood there, staring at the plaque, I felt something shift.

The air grew heavy, the way it does before a thunderstorm.

And then I heard it: faint at first, almost a whisper, but growing louder with every second.

Footsteps.

They were coming closer.

The footsteps echoed through the ruins of the mansion, slow and deliberate. At first, I thought they might belong to another unlucky thrill-seeker who had wandered into the wreckage, but something about them felt wrong.

They didn’t shuffle over broken debris or falter on the unstable ground. They were steady, rhythmic, like they belonged to someone who knew exactly where they were going.

I didn’t wait to see who—or what—it was.

Backing away from the plaque, I turned and scrambled over the rubble, ignoring the sharp edges scraping my hands and legs. I didn’t stop until I was outside, the morning sun barely cutting through the overcast sky.

But the footsteps didn’t stop.

They were still coming, their sound impossibly clear even though no one emerged from the wreckage. I stared at the empty doorway, my heart hammering in my chest, waiting for something to appear.

Then, I saw them.

Not in the doorway, but in the distance—figures standing along the edge of the property. There were five of them, maybe six, scattered among the overgrown grass and skeletal trees. At first, I thought they were strangers, maybe people from the nearby town curious about the mansion.

But they weren’t moving.

They just stood there, watching me.

Even though they were too far away for me to make out their faces, I knew they were staring. That same weight I’d felt for weeks was back, heavier than ever, pressing down on me like a vice.

I took a step back, and one of the figures shifted. Its head tilted slightly, as if acknowledging my movement.

Another step, and the others started to move too—not toward me, but around me, circling the ruins in perfect synchronization.

I don’t remember running to my car. One moment, I was standing there, frozen, and the next, I was behind the wheel, gripping the steering wheel so hard my knuckles turned white.

The drive back to town was a blur. My hands shook as I gripped the wheel, my eyes darting to the rearview mirror every few seconds. The road was empty, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was following me.

By the time I reached the motel, my head was pounding, and my legs felt like jelly. I locked the door behind me, shoved a chair under the handle, and collapsed onto the bed.

But the feeling didn’t go away.

I could sense them—standing just beyond the edge of my awareness, like shadows lingering in the corner of my eye. Every sound, every creak of the old building made me jump, my mind conjuring images of the figures standing outside my window, waiting for me to look.

That night, the first knock came.

I was sitting on the edge of the bed, the TV on low to drown out the silence, when I heard it—a soft, deliberate knock at the door.

Three slow raps, evenly spaced.

I froze, staring at the door. Then I remembered—the motel had no front desk, no housekeepers, and no reason for anyone to bother me at this hour.

Another knock, louder this time.

I grabbed the crowbar I’d brought back from Greystone and approached the door, my pulse racing.

“Who’s there?” I called out, my voice shaking.

No answer.

The third knock rattled the doorframe, and I almost dropped the crowbar.

I leaned in, peering through the peephole. The hallway outside was empty, but I knew better than to trust what I saw.

I stepped back, gripping the crowbar tighter, and the knock came again—this time from the window.

Spinning around, I saw nothing but the drawn curtains, but the sound was unmistakable. Someone—or something—was outside.

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe.

For what felt like hours, the room was silent. Then I heard it: the faint creak of floorboards, not outside, but inside the room.

I turned, swinging the crowbar wildly, but there was no one there. The room was empty, exactly as I’d left it, but the sound of footsteps didn’t stop. They circled me, moving just beyond the edges of the light.

And then, the whispers started.

Faint and indistinct, like voices carried on a breeze. I couldn’t make out the words, but I didn’t need to. I knew what they wanted.

The figures. The portraits. The *Unfinished.*

They weren’t gone. They’d followed me, clinging to my very existence like a curse.

And now, they were done lurking.

The whispers swelled, overlapping until they merged into a single, deafening roar. Pain shot through my skull, as if it were splitting open, and I dropped the crowbar, clutching my ears in agony.

“Stop!” I screamed, but the voices only grew louder.

In the haze of noise and pain, I saw them—shapes materializing in the corners of the room, their faces smooth and featureless. They didn’t move like people. They glided, their limbs bending unnaturally as they closed in.

I stumbled, my foot catching on loose rubble and throwing me off balance. My hand shot out instinctively, reaching for the crowbar, but instead, it closed around something cold and metallic.

The plaque.

It shouldn’t have been there. I left it at the mansion, I was sure of it, but there it was, sitting on the motel desk as if it had always been there.

The figures stopped, their blank faces turning toward the plaque in unison.

I had no idea what I was doing, but I grabbed it anyway, clutching it like a shield.

“Is... is this what you want?” I shouted, my voice trembling as the words stumbled out.

The figures froze, their heads tilting as if considering the question. Then, one by one, they began to retreat, fading into the shadows until the room was empty again.

The silence that followed was suffocating.

I stared at the plaque, the word “Unfinished” gleaming faintly in the dim light. Deep down, I understood—this wasn’t the end.

It was the start of something far worse.

I didn’t sleep that night. How could I? Every sound, every flicker of a shadow felt like one of those figures returning, lurking just out of sight in the corners of my room.

By dawn, I came to a grim conclusion: I couldn’t keep running.

Whatever this was, it wouldn’t stop until I faced it.

The plaque sat on the motel desk, its brass surface tarnished and dull, but the word etched into it—*Unfinished*—seemed to pulse faintly, like it was alive. I didn’t know what it wanted me to do, but I had a feeling the mansion held the answers. Or what was left of it.

I returned to Greystone as the sun rose higher, the ruins almost peaceful under the light. But the calm was deceptive. The air still carried that oppressive weight, like the place itself was watching me.

I walked through the rubble, my boots crunching on charred wood and shattered stone, until I reached the heart of the mansion. The plaque seemed to grow heavier in my hand the closer I got, like it was pulling me toward something.

And then I saw it: a trapdoor, partially obscured by debris. I don’t know how I’d missed it before—it looked old, the wood scorched but still intact, with a rusted iron handle.

I hesitated, every instinct screaming at me to leave, but I couldn’t ignore the pull of the plaque. I knelt and yanked the trapdoor open.

Beneath it was a set of stone stairs spiraling into darkness.

The air grew colder as I descended, the faint smell of ash giving way to something earthier—damp soil, rotting wood. My flashlight barely pierced the gloom, but the stairs went on and on, deeper than should’ve been possible.

Finally, I reached the bottom.

The room was small, the walls carved directly into the stone, and at its center was a pedestal. On it rested an object covered in a dark, tattered cloth.

I approached slowly, the plaque in my hand vibrating slightly, as if urging me forward. With a deep breath, I reached out and pulled the cloth away.

Underneath was another painting.

It was just like the others, the frame ornate and gilded, the canvas impossibly detailed. But this one wasn’t of a person. It was of a scene.

A field, overgrown and wild, with a single figure standing in the distance. It looked familiar, but I couldn’t place why—until I realized the perspective was mine.

The painting showed *me*, standing where I’d been earlier that morning, staring back at the mansion.

As I stared at the painting, the figure in it began to move, turning slowly to face me. Its features were blurred, distorted, but its posture was unmistakable.

It wasn’t just watching me. It was mimicking me.

And then it smiled.

The walls of the room trembled, dust raining from the ceiling as the figure in the painting stepped closer. My flashlight flickered, and the air grew thick, almost liquid, making it harder to breathe.

I staggered back, clutching the plaque like a lifeline. The figure reached the edge of the canvas, its distorted features pressing against the surface as if trying to break free.

I didn’t think. I just acted.

Raising the plaque, I slammed it into the painting with all my strength. The canvas tore with a sound like a scream, the edges curling and blackening as the room erupted into chaos.

The walls cracked, the floor buckled, and the pedestal crumbled into dust. A deafening roar filled the air as shadows poured from the painting, swirling around me like a storm.

I ran, scrambling back up the stairs as the room collapsed behind me. The shadows clawed at my heels, their whispers deafening, but I didn’t stop. I burst through the trapdoor just as the last of the staircase crumbled into darkness.

When I reached the surface, the ruins were still. The oppressive weight that had hung over the mansion was gone, replaced by an eerie calm.

The plaque was gone too, along with the shadows.

For the first time in months, I felt... free.

That was three years ago. I’ve tried to move on, to live a normal life, but there’s always a part of me that wonders.

The mansion’s ruins were cleared a few months after I left, the land sold to a developer. They built a row of luxury homes there, all sleek glass and polished stone. I read about it in the paper, saw photos of smiling families posing in front of their new homes.

But I can’t help wondering if they feel it too. That faint pressure, that sense of being watched.

I’ve stopped looking over my shoulder, stopped jumping at shadows. But sometimes, late at night, when I’m alone in a room, I’ll catch the faintest sound.

Footsteps.

Not close. No.

But they’re there.

They’re always there.

From Starbucks I usually get a chocolate chip mocha frappe or the cookies and crème frappe; with 1 shot of expresso and 5 shots of mocha. At my local coffee shop I get their cookies and crème frappe (the same as my Starbucks order 1/5) 

I’ve seen that they have a mocha frappe but that’s about it… I’m a chocolate person😂

I've recently started exploring the world of coffee and I'm looking for a good espresso machine. I've tried a few cups at local cafes but I want to start making my own at home.
I don't know much about the different types of espresso machines or what features to look for so I'd love some recommendations.
I'm on a budget of around $200 so anything in that range would be great.
Thanks in advance for your help!",1,1731133628.0,NeedProductHelp,0,1.0,False
1gn3xfu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gn3xfu,Since taking SSRI’s my sleep has improved dramatically. ,"Before and after pictures. 

I struggled with bad sleep and anxiety for a long time. I was only getting about 4-5 hours of sleep and relying heavily on coffee to get thru a workout. I tried all the natural remedies like medication, eating healthier  meals(which I already do) and stressing less. All that didn’t work so I went to a psychiatrist. The reason I chose a psychiatrist was that I did therapy before and it didn’t work. The psychiatrist recommended me lexapro and Xanax to improve my situation and it’s a night and day difference. I’m able to workout with a happy smile and my mood throughout the day is better. I really suggest if you’re a person like me to get checked out. ",8,1731133497.0,whoop,2,1.0,False

Though I find I still need two cups of coffee per day, and sometimes more rarely now, the occasional nap. Napping would depend on how strict I am at going to bed and waking up. The time change threw me off a lil. Usually in bed by 10:30pm and up 6:15am. I recently started smoking cigs again which I noticed helps with the jitters from cofeee but then makes me sleepy after meals in the afternoons. Minimal cannibus smoking on the other hand helps keep me awake for a couple hours when I’m feeling tired, utilizing when still is too early to go to bed. Any recommendations? What’s ur best med mgmt? I heard of a nootropic gum which I’m considering instead of coffee, cigs, n cannabis. ",1,1731133384.0,Narcolepsy,1,1.0,False

I’m going to be visiting your lovely city from out of state next week (my cousin lives near Frisco but we plan on coming into Dallas) and I’m looking for some recommendations for the following:

1. Unique gift stores. I love kitschy things. Things that are unique to Texas (yes I’ll be making a trip to a Bucees! 😂 Always make several stops as we don’t have them where I live)

2. A place that sells alternative plus size clothing (obviously not mall stores but things that could be found at Torrid) or just trendy in general. 

3. Any cool coffee shops, restaurants, things you feel are a must-see.

These don’t have to be Dallas specifically, if it’s in suburb, I’m open!
