1k80p16,https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMB7Qyqov/,Could this be only fluid dynamics? Bubbles behaving oddly ordered under microscope.,"Hi everyone, I'm a Physics undergrad trying to understand what should be just fluid dynamics.

Recently, I came across a TikTok account of a doctor (apparently a physician?) who posts videos of his homemade microscope experiments. Some of them show behaviors that don’t quite match what I’d expect from gas bubbles or random liquid behavior.

Here are two examples that really confused me:

https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMB7ajhS9/
Here we see under microscope bubbles from coffee with motions seemingly well organized; 

https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMB75KUuD/
And here, specially the last of the three short experiments, with naked eyes it's shown the appearance of stable bubbles inside a liquid medium under a chaotic turbulence that is very hard to assume it's just random gas.

As I couldn't find anything similar anywhere, I bought a microscope to watch it closer, but I'm also questioning here and there trying to find the right answers for these intricate fluid dynamics phenomenons.

Some of them have 6.3mm(Quarter-Inch) Headphone Jack, with or without ESS DAC chips, and maybe a better features such as native USB 3.1 10Gbps thanks to its chipset.

But... I think that's it. We are overclockers. Yeah.. less VRMs/Power Phases, lack of PLX(You know, PCIE Lane Multiplying Chips), and overall, **Not experimental enough** like Z170, I guess.

We had a Legendary Z170X-SOC FORCE by Gigabyte (Which I have but currently malfunctioning- Power won't turn OFF :/ ). We had a great Z170 OC Formula by ASRock. We had Z170 XPower Titanium by MSI!

But all of these experimental, super-high power phase designs, went extinct in Coffee Lakes. That's why I think modifying Z170nto make it work in Z370 is much a better option.

Maybe this is the essence of life—to appreciate the little moments as they happen, and live in the present.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>More professionals today are seeking full-time online jobs with flexible remote working conditions. This shift not only responds to the evolving work culture but also offers a better work-life balance, elimination of commute times, and the freedom to design workdays according to personal productivity peaks. Whether you're a seasoned remote worker or just considering diving into online work, understanding the best opportunities available is key to making this transition successful.

### Why Choose Full-Time Online Jobs with Flexible Remote Working Conditions?

Full-time online jobs often come with the stability of regular income, comprehensive benefits, and opportunities for career growth—just like traditional office jobs. However, coupling this with flexibility provides a powerful advantage. It allows you to carve out your work hours around your personal life, increasing job satisfaction and even improving your output. When considering such roles, it is important to find positions that not only provide flexibility but also align with your skills and career goals.

### Popular Fields Offering Remote Full-Time Positions

Many industries have embraced remote work, opening doors for diverse roles that suit a wide range of skills and interests. Here are some prominent areas that frequently offer full-time online jobs with flexible remote working conditions:

- **Information Technology (IT) and Software Development:** From web developers to system administrators, IT roles are widely available and often come with flexible schedules.
- **Customer Support and Virtual Assistance:** Customer service agents and virtual assistants handle communications and administrative tasks from the comfort of home.
- **Writing and Content Creation:** Freelance writers, editors, and content strategists can manage their workload and hours with considerable freedom.
- **Digital Marketing and SEO:** Specialists create campaigns, manage social media, and optimize content around their preferred schedules.
- **Education and Tutoring:** Online educators and tutors offer flexible teaching sessions across different time zones.
- **Finance and Accounting:** Accountants and financial analysts often work on a remote basis with flexible deadlines and meetings.
 
### How to Find Legitimate Full-Time Online Jobs with Flexibility

Finding the right full-time online job that offers genuine flexibility requires a strategic approach. Here are practical tips to help you identify trustworthy opportunities:

- **Use Reputable Job Boards:** Platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed, FlexJobs, and Remote.co specialize in remote job listings. They filter out scams and highlight reliable employers.
- **Network Within Your Industry:** Join professional groups and forums online to connect with remote workers who can share insights and leads.
- **Research the Company Culture:** Look for companies that openly advertise their commitment to flexible work arrangements and employee well-being.
- **Clarify Flexibility Expectations:** During interviews, ask whether flexible working hours are truly supported or if there are core hours to adhere to.
 
### Essential Skills to Thrive in Flexible Remote Roles

Success in full-time online roles with flexible conditions doesn't just depend on job-specific skills. It also relies heavily on your ability to manage your work environment and time effectively. Here are vital skills to develop:

- **Self-Discipline:** Without the physical presence of supervision, maintaining focus and meeting deadlines independently is crucial.
- **Communication:** Clear, consistent communication with teammates and supervisors ensures you stay aligned despite physical distance.
- **Technology Proficiency:** Familiarity with collaboration tools like Zoom, Slack, and project management software helps you integrate smoothly into remote teams.
- **Adaptability:** Remote work environments often shift quickly, so being flexible and embracing change will keep you productive.
 
### Maximizing Your Remote Work Flexibility

Once you land a full-time online job with flexible remote conditions, it’s important to optimize how you work to reap the full benefits. Start by creating a dedicated workspace that minimizes distractions. Establish a consistent routine that respects your preferred productivity rhythms but remains predictable enough for collaboration.

Use digital tools to organize your tasks, set reminders for meetings, and track deliverables. Regularly communicate with your manager and team to foster relationships and clarify expectations. And remember, flexibility means balancing work and rest effectively—don’t hesitate to step away and recharge when your schedule allows it.

### Long-Term Outlook of Full-Time Remote Jobs

The trend towards full-time online jobs with flexible remote working conditions is expected to grow significantly. Companies recognize that flexible schedules increase employee happiness and retention. Plus, the vast talent pool available globally allows them to hire the best candidates without geographical constraints.

For employees, this means more choice and freedom in how and where they work, potentially leading to richer career experiences and improved quality of life. Being proactive in developing remote-friendly skills and embracing digital workplace tools will prepare you to seize these opportunities as they expand.

Embracing full-time online jobs with flexible remote working conditions nurtures both professional success and personal fulfillment. By focusing on the right opportunities and honing essential skills, you can thrive in this new era of work.

</div>How to Maximize Productivity and Work-Life Balance in Remote Full-Time Roles
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>Working full-time online with flexible remote conditions offers tremendous freedom, but it also presents unique challenges when it comes to maintaining productivity and balancing your personal life. If you’re navigating these roles, it's essential to develop strategies that help you stay focused, meet deadlines, and enjoy your time outside work without feeling overwhelmed.

### Design a Personal Workspace That Boosts Focus

Your home environment can either support your efficiency or cause distractions. Choose a quiet, comfortable spot where you can dedicate time solely to work. Make sure your workspace has good lighting, an ergonomic chair, and all the tools you need within reach. Personalizing this space encourages a mental shift into “work mode” and helps avoid mixing work with relaxation areas.

### Set Clear Daily Goals and Priorities

In a remote role, it's easy to let tasks pile up or wander from important projects. Start each day by outlining your key goals. Break larger projects into smaller, manageable chunks that can fit into your schedule. Prioritize tasks based on deadlines and impact, and check your progress regularly. This approach helps you stay on top of responsibilities and reduces last-minute stress.

### Create and Stick to a Consistent Routine

Even with flexibility, maintaining a regular work schedule supports steady productivity. Establish specific start and end times for your workday. Incorporate short breaks to recharge your focus, such as a 5-minute stretch every hour. Predictability in your routine helps your mind and body adapt, preventing burnout and maintaining motivation.

### Leverage Technology to Stay Organized

Use digital tools tailored for remote work to streamline scheduling, communication, and task tracking. Calendar apps, project management software, and collaboration platforms can keep you connected with your team and organized. Set reminders for meetings and deadlines to avoid overlooking critical tasks. These resources create structure and reduce the feeling of isolation from your colleagues.

### Implement Boundaries to Protect Your Personal Time

One of the biggest hurdles in flexible remote jobs is separating work from home life. Establish firm boundaries with coworkers and family members about your work hours. Communicate your availability clearly in emails and chats. Once your workday ends, turn off work notifications and resist the urge to check emails. This discipline safeguards your downtime and helps recharge your energy.

### Practice Self-Care to Maintain Energy and Focus

Physical and mental well-being directly affects your output. Incorporate exercise into your day, whether it’s a quick walk or a full workout session. Pay attention to nutrition and stay hydrated. Taking care of your health sharpens concentration and boosts mood, making it easier to tackle your workload effectively.

### Use Time Blocking to Manage Distractions

Time blocking is a technique where you assign specific periods for certain types of tasks. For example, set aside morning hours for deep work without interruptions, then schedule meetings and communications in the afternoon. Protect these time blocks by informing others of your schedule. This focused working method helps reduce multitasking, a common productivity killer in remote setups.

### Seek Social Interaction and Support

Working remotely full-time can feel isolating at times. Make an effort to connect with colleagues via video calls, chat groups, or virtual coffee breaks. Social interactions foster team spirit and improve communication, which can enhance your work experience significantly. Don’t hesitate to reach out for support when you feel overwhelmed—it’s important to maintain your emotional health.

### Adjust Strategies Based on What Works Best for You

Every individual has different rhythms and preferences when it comes to productivity. Experiment with various techniques like the Pomodoro method, flexible hours, or different work environments until you find what maximizes your output. Reflect regularly on what helps you stay balanced and productive, and tweak your approach accordingly.

By integrating these strategies into your full-time remote role, you can enjoy the benefits of flexible working conditions while ensuring you remain productive and maintain a healthy work-life balance. Remember, the goal is not just to work harder but to work smarter and sustain your well-being in the long run.

</div>### Conclusion

Embracing full-time online jobs with flexible remote working conditions opens up a world of opportunities tailored to your lifestyle and career goals. By exploring roles that fit your skills and passions, you not only gain the freedom to design your own work environment but also enhance your overall job satisfaction. Whether it’s in fields like digital marketing, programming, customer service, or content creation, remote jobs empower you to achieve professional success without sacrificing personal time.

To truly benefit from flexible remote roles, mastering productivity and maintaining a healthy work-life balance is key. Setting clear boundaries, creating dedicated workspaces, and establishing consistent routines help keep distractions at bay and focus sharp. Leveraging tools such as time management apps and communication platforms ensures you stay connected with your team while managing your tasks efficiently. Remember, flexibility doesn’t mean endless work hours—it means having control over when and how you work, which boosts motivation and reduces burnout.

By combining smart job selection with effective habits for remote work, you create a sustainable career path that supports both your ambitions and well-being. The future of full-time work lies in adaptable, remote opportunities that fit your needs. Taking charge of your schedule and environment allows you to thrive professionally and personally, making flexible remote jobs more than just a trend—they’re a smart choice for lasting success.

Hot and cold between the 2, but this time my aunt pretty much said enough is enough and gave him 2 pieces of paper saying she wants a divorce. 

They’ve been married for over 2 decades, have an adult child and they own their home together. 

My aunt is the bread winner. She has a job that has pension and 401k. My uncle unfortunately hasn’t had a job since they got married as my aunt has always said “my man doesn’t need to work, I make great money for the two of us”

He believes she’s cheating as she has been doing things uncharacteristically like getting her hair done, staying out late at night, coming home smelling of alcohol, all things she has not done in the whole time they’ve been married. 

So this piece of paper. Pretty much says you get money, I keep the house, I keep the car, you don’t get any of my pension or 401k, you keep the timeshare. 

My uncle has medical needs, he’s been seeing doctors for as long as I can remember because of this. Emotionally, he’s tired, saddened, stressed and angry because some days my aunt comes in very loving and caring asking if they want anything to eat (him and their daughter) and bringing them things like coffee, and the next she’s back at it with did you sign the papers, we are done. We don’t work well together anymore. 

I don’t know if I missed anything on the wiki side of things, but please feel free to ask. 

He wants to know what should he do next? What is he entitled to since he doesn’t work, is he entitled to anything.

Idk if that age gap is weird but we've been friends for 4 years and she has a birthday extremely late in the year while mines very early in the year.

Anyways, she came over despite me not being that excited about it, I cooked her dinner and we started hanging out. I showed her a game I liked and we had fun even though she was really bad at it. After we got on call with my bf to play online games as a trio, long story short I was basically ignored for two hours while they played together to the point where I'd have to repeat myself loudly 3-4 times to get noticed and they'd only actively talk to me if I had something we needed in the game. (Like said friend basically yelling at me to do stuff) After all of that I was pissed but I didn't want to call the whole sleepover off or anything (it was already 10pm and I didn't want to bother her parents) so the rest of the night we binged yt until I realized she didn't bring a sleeping bag like I asked her to.

I wanted to be a good host (I've never brought friends home because I'm a pretty big introvert and I like my alone time) so I let her take my bed while I slept on the floor. After a veeery rocky night and a stiff back I woke up at like 8am and she slept till 10am. Ngl I felt like garbage and wanted actual rest and despite having coffee I was still half asleep. She kept asking me to play games and I didn't want to but she persisted until I finally said sure.

During gaming section #2 she was extremely condescending to me. We played a game she has years of experience in while I was new to it and there was quite literally no tutorial so I didn't really know how to play, during this she kept making comments ""Wow you really don't know how to play games!"" ""You know I can't carry you the whole time right?"" ""it's not hard just try more"" ""You're trying right?"" keep in mind I'm half asleep and my back hurts from letting HER sleep on my bed. Honestly I wouldn't care about the trash talking if I wasnt bending over backwards to make sure she was comfy and specifically making food she liked but it just sounded so condescending to me? Meanwhile Everytime I suggested a game she immediately shot it down and when I didn't want to play a game she liked she forced me to anyways.

Anyways once she finally left I called her out respectively in a text. Instead of taking ANY accountability about it she played the victim card then ghosted me for like 2 weeks until I started up a convo with her at school. Later this day she basically pulled me aside pissed because I accused her of being rude and condescending and proceeded to ask me if I knew the definition of condescending, trying to explain it to my like I was stupid AKA BEING EVEN MORE CONDESCENDING. I let it slide this time because I'm tired of really caring.

I don't think I'm the A in this but a mutual friend says we were both just being petty. Even though I did nothing to her except for let her know how I felt over a text. 

I've had problems with the same friend before, she got me into selling school chocolates by promising she'd help if I couldn't do it (I have severe social anxiety) and when I asked for help she ghosted me before proceeding to sell two more boxes (she only needed one but went back multiple times to do more while ignoring me). There are so many more instances of her being like this. She's always been condescending towards me and I'm not sure why because she doesn't do this to any of our other friends.

I didn’t know her name or anything about her.  But I felt so intensely drawn to do a reading for her. So one day I sat in the coffee shop, and I did.  I wrote down what I saw for her intuitively based on the","Tarot cards. She was super busy. I left, came back for more coffee a few days later and handed her the reading Id written down on a piece of paper I found quickly because this sudden drawing to her energy led me to do this. She seemed super happy to see me again the next few times she seen me. I learned that my reading was spot on and that she really appreciated it and the other two baristas there were so in shock they gave me their names and asked if I’d do a reading for them today. 
When I started out doing tarot I had a lot to learn and my gifts, skills, and abilities have grown tremendously over the years. 
I’ve learned a lot from this community. And I’m appreciative. For everyone new and even seasoned there’s always learning and growth we can have.  Keep going. Don’t stop doing what you love. Keep developing your spiritual self. 
And another thing I encountered was religious people trying to tear me down on the internet for the sake of my passion… especially Christians. They would tell me I was “ going to hell “, or to say “Jesus” name as if I couldn’t, taunt me, tease me, and some even took it as far as to threaten my expression and passion bringing up the fact that I had a child with a super Christian family that I have a parenting plan in place with - outright malicious harassment. 

But I kept going. I didn’t give up what I loved. I had to be more secretive in the fact I couldn’t do livestreams anymore but I long to start back. And I know I will be guided just like I was guided to do this reading with this barista.  There are no coincidences, I do not believe. 

Thank you for listening. This was just meant to encourage the ones that don’t quite “get” tarot right away. And the ones that are around others’ that have wrong preconceived notions about tarot.

1k806hu,https://www.reddit.com/r/hammockcamping/comments/1k806hu/iso_gear_suggestions_for_my_semiunhoused_uncle_to/,ISO gear suggestions for my semi-unhoused uncle to use during the daytime,"Hello Hammock people!  I would like some recommendations and suggestions.  My uncle is 75 years old and intellectually disabled.  His disability effects his speech, learning and motor skills but he is quite capable of most things if he has adequate time to accomplish the task at hand. My uncle was evicted from his apartment last winter and has been staying at a men's shelter.  The reasons for his unhoused state are many and I this question isn't about why he's unhoused, nor am I asking for advice to get him into a permanent home.  He seems fairly content at the shelter, he even volunteered there and at a nearby soup kitchen when he was living in his apartment, I think they even like having him around.  
Here's the issue: the shelter requires everyone to leave the premises during the day unless the weather is freezing cold.  My uncle can walk to various places such as nearby coffee shops, parks, and even to my house (where my mother, his older sister lives - they don't always get along and my uncle doesn't like to hang out with my mother very much).  He prefers to spend his time alone, reading or listening to music.  He doesn't sleep well in the shelter bunk on the thin plastic mattress and most of the time he's here at my place he wants to nap, which my mother (his older sister) finds quite annoying.  If he's not walking around or sipping coffee at a shop, my uncle usually sits on the ground.
My uncle is a very slight man in build and stature and doesn't have much natural cushioning from body fat and muscle.  Sitting or laying on the hard ground quickly becomes painful.  He has been hospitalized for heart disease and appendicitis this year and needed surgery for a fractured hip last year, he's very hard of hearing..  but this man is resilient and maintains a better attitude than most people I know without chronic disabilities and homelessness to overcome.  My uncle's favorite thing to do when he's here at my house is to lay in the hammock on my front porch or the one in the back yard where he can listen to his headphones or get a nap without putting pressure on his hips, shoulders or tailbone.  
I would like to buy my uncle his own hammock that he can take with him wherever he goes and perhaps use to sleep in when he doesn't get good rest at the shelter.  He loves being outdoors but needs to avoid insect bites and stings and sunburn.  It would be great if he had a hammock with a mosquito net and a small place where he can keep his shoes and hat safely inside.  Something easy to put up and take down and not big and heavy to carry around.  It doesn't need to be his only shelter but ideally it would provide a dry place in a moderate rain storm.  In the winter if he doesnt have an apartment of his own, my uncle can store his hammock here in my garage where I have a space for some of his things.  No need for him to cook or  anything, this is just for him to use during the day when the shelter is closed and hanging out with my mom isn't going well.
Do you know what brand or style of hammock might work well for my uncle?  Probably a budget of $50 or less - something I can feasibly replace if it's stolen or damaged.  Is this even a good idea?

The aftermath reveals that those who survived begin to die in bizarre accidents related to their near-miss experiences—one slips and falls into a mixing concrete truck and is pulverized by the mixing blades, while another is pulled into a belt mechanism and is skinned alive and eventually crushed by the rotating gears.

THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG RANT IM SORRY 😭😭

So basically starting in January 24’ this girl, let’s call her K, and I started talking (both juniors). It was very lighthearted at first (we both were crushing on each other a bit) and I fell hard. She was (and still is) a really positive and kind soul to anyone she meets.

I would become a core member in her school club called “The Rights we Have” and I would often try to get others to come and help lead discussions within it. We were talking very often on Snap and we started to hang out often slowly more and more. It started with study sessions at a coffee shop near us and the library, thrifting, and going to school events together. I viewed these all as dates and the slow burn progression of a friends to lovers sort of thing lol.

While I was away on vacation, she confided in me that she had a big fat crush on me (first I knew about it explicitly) but said she wasn’t in the mood to date, which is completely understandable. I admitted as well that I have been crushing on her as well for the past few months or so. This is where it starts to go downhill. Coming back, we hung out more often because of the weather getting better, and prom was approaching. I asked her to prom, in which she denied saying she didn’t like the idea of going with someone, similar to what she said earlier in the year when I asked her to a semi-formal. I wasn’t too surprised but felt a little hurt because I was just a bit confused on why.

After prom night, she told me she was going to a mutual friend’s beach house for the weekend with a bunch of other friends. So being the desperate boy I was, I kind of begged the host to let me come along as well in which he agreed. Awesome, or so I thought. While we’re at the beach house, nothing really happens between us but my friend, let’s call her M, tells me that it was kinda obvious that I was crushing on her hard, which was a bit awkward and that threw me off a bit. Fast forward to the end of our junior year, she leaves to go to Taiwan for the ENTIRE SUMMER on a study abroad program. I was both extremely happy for her since she was very passionate about the trip, yet super selfishly disappointed that I couldn’t really be in contact with her for 2-2 1/2 months over the summer, where we could’ve hung out more.

Looking back this is where I should have stopped.  I realize now that I was very much like Tom in 500 Days of Summer (she was honest with me up front but ignored her in the hope she’d change her mind).

Finally after waiting for weeks, she finally comes back around late August. We hung out twice after: a hang out of basically driving all across town, yapping and getting food together, and she actually meets my mom when I have to get something at my house. My mom told me after that “hang out” that she really loved K and said she saw how happy she made me.

However, only like two days after that, we hang out (for the last time). (And it was kind of a banger)…

This is what I remember from the night.

Basically I got there around 4:00 just to chill and talk since we haven’t really talked much about her trip to Taiwan and turns out when I got there she was actually sleeping so I just talked with her mom and her step dad for about like half an hour. Then she finally comes down and I just remember listening to her stories and experiences for what felt like hours and I cherished every second of it. She even brought me a whole bag of goodies such as stickers and food and trinkets for me to keep (which melted my heart at the time since I realized she was thinking about me during that long time as well).

Not too long after, I had a great dinner with her family, which to me felt like the very stereotypical “meeting the parents” dinner where they interrogate you with a bunch of questions 😭. Anyways, we all help clean up dinner and me and her spent hours yapping and building the really beautiful LEGO Orchid Plant (which I bought for her with the  intention for her to keep).

Sadly, the next day, I get the dreaded text. The “I like you so much but I just don’t feel the same vibes I was picking up from you and I think we should be friends”text. This absolutely shattered me. I kept my composure to not come off selfishly by telling her I was cool with it. Yet during my tackle football practice later that day, due to the anger I was taking out on my teammates, it was the first time I ever cried on a football field (and I hid it very well).

Not much happens for a while as I try to distance myself from her but we still kept in contact, talking about our college essays and stuff.

I am really embarrassed by this, but I often found myself calling/texting her when I was drunk after parties during the football season, mostly just admitting I still had feelings for her, and her each time telling me that “it’s just the alcohol” or “she wishes she felt the same” and I realize how annoying I was being destroying our relationship piece by piece.

After around November, I come clean and tell her that I think we need space for my own sake and she’s perfectly okay with that but the vibe is not there and there seems to be a negative feeling between us.

Then I burnt bridges. In late January of this year, we had a semi formal dance and at the after party, I notice her and her guy friend kinda being touchy and all, and I try to ignore it because I’m trying to move on.

But then, as the party is ending, I see them kiss. And of course, drunken me made a problem out of this, texting her later that night: “I hate you” and “I wish I could take back every moment we spent together and erase every memory of you”.

So this is where it’s at. No more smiles in the hallway, no more club meetings. Nothing. And I tricked myself into thinking that this was good for me and I could finally move on.

But part of me can’t. I recognize that I should move on and I accept that she doesn’t feel the same way, which is totally normal. However, she still appears in my dreams from time to time, and I feel so happy in them. I realized recently that I haven’t felt as happy ever since. That joy and spark just isn’t there.

But I am not trying to salvage a relationship now. I just want to talk with her one more time. I want to have an adult conversation just about everything and apologize for the unjustifiable, disgusting things I said to her. One more time before I never see her again.

I have consulted two friends about this and they have said h the at this is very selfish — that apologizing now and having any sort of convo with her is just to make myself feel better, it will only get ugly and I should just let it be.

I might be going to prom with a friend of her’s soon (who’s lesbian so there’s no attraction or wtv) but we might have to be in the same radius or whatever before and after prom, and I don’t want the bad mood or tension to be there and ruin the night for both of us.

I am stuck and I want to absolve myself of this entire grief process, but I also want to apologize sincerely one last time before we go our separate ways forever.

What should I do? Please help. (And don’t hold back on brutal honesty)",1,1745626788.0,teenrelationships,1,1.0,False
1k801fg,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1k801fg/does_digestion_break_a_fast/,Does digestion break a fast?,"When you fast, does the food in your stomach, the small intestine and large intestine affect your fast?  Does digestion break fasts?  Should you count the beginning of the fast at the time they have all emptied?   Or does digestion not affect a fast?  I ask this because so many people say in effect that if I eat a single calorie during my fast, I have broken my fast.  But I am digesting food the entire time I am fasting.  Even the first 5 hours of my fast I have food in my stomach.  Why would drinking a 2 calorie cup of coffee when I have food in my stomach anyway matter at all?   But actually coffee is not even digested in the stomach.  It is digested in the small intestine.   And food takes two to six hours to clear the small intestine.  So something I ate just before I start my fast can still be being digested in my small intestine 11 hours into my 16 hour fast.  Why doesn't that break my fast?  Also, If I drink 2 calories of coffee 4 hours before the end of my fast there is almost no chance it will be digested before my fast is over.   So why don't we just start counting our fast when we have finally digested all of the meal prior to the fast?  Like in 2 to 4 days after we eat?  ",0,1745626733.0,intermittentfasting,11,0.36,False

I'm really hoping to just share my journey so far as this is showing to impact my life a ton. Maybe some of you can share some insight or similar experiences! Advice is always appreciated:)

I started feeling bladder urgency, pain, bloating, severe inflammation, burning, and severe pelvic pain about a month and a half ago. I went to a walk in two weeks after the pain didn't go away and after a bit. So far I have done an ultrasound, urinalysis x2, urine culture and blood test. (I live in Canada).

I have pre existing issues such as celiac and eczema (autoimmune with vitamin deficiencies), PTSD, AU-ADHD, and mild PCOS without insulin resistance. I have an IUD for contraceptive use which I got one year ago and I love it.

Hormone wise, my periods have been regular, fairly light and all my symptoms are super predictable. (Stops on third day, nausea night before, 5-7 days long). But now, I often don't bleed during which is due to my IUD. The only weird thing, is sometimes I get UTI symptoms a couple days before my period with no bacteria or infection.

They were able to rule out cancer in the abdomen and pelvic area, stones, cysts, utis and any other urgent issues. I am currently waiting for a gynecologist referral where I can get an MRI and further tests done.

It sounds as if they are testing for  endometreosis, IC and other possible autoimmune comorbidities. They are hesitant and not really sure on Endo because the only symptom I have that supports it is pelvic pain and bladder issues. No family history on either side. 

What I'm now wondering if it is histamine related. Histamine relates to hormones and autoimmune. 

The way I've been able to manage is eliminate a lot of foods and drinks from my diet. I can eat salmon, popcorn, sweet potatoes, chamomile tea, coconut and peanut butter. 

Chocolate and coffee and citrus are EVIL pain-do-ers.

I feel nausea, bloating and it flares up my eczema insanely when I eat irritating food. Autoimmune and histamine is related, especially in celiac sense. But the biggest thing was my period.

All the sudden my period hit after weeks of horrible pain and nothing. I felt so amazing on my period and the pain was there, yet so bareable. I found out this is common which is amazing. I researched estrogen and applied it to my pain / food / life tracking currently and when estrogen is high, so is my symptoms. The second day after my period ended, the pain, burning and urgency came back. (New record of going pee 20 times at work the other day too!!).

Basically, they assume I have IC or another autoimmune issue due to my symptoms and I agree but I can't know without fully ruling out Endo or anything else potential. 

Bonus is that I got a portable heat pad and I was able to work 2 full shifts from my work so I wanted to mention that since I'm super proud!! I just hope they figure it out and I can manage it better soon. Or at least figure it out and apply for disability. I'm trying to stay positive but I can't be myself anymore and I can't do or enjoy the food, hobbies or time with my partner like I used to.

1k7zsef,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1k7zsef/please_help_none_of_my_doctors_seem_to_care/,PLEASE help none of my doctors seem to care!,"I know this is long, but PLEASE read the entire thing. I am desperate and I’m losing my mind over this. I started therapy because I was about to start self harming because of the stress this is causing me and it seems like none of my doctors care.

I am 34, female, and I have been dealing with gum issues for the last year. I finished my Invisalign treatment last September. I’ve already switched dentists once because my previous dentist was not taking me seriously. 

I expressed concerns about my gums receding and the constant bleeding in my gums that I have been experiencing for several months. I went to the dentist three times last year and EVERY SINGLE TIME they told me that nothing was wrong with my gums, DESPITE the copious amount of bleeding when I floss, and when I would go to the dentist to get my regular cleanings done.

I switched to a different office because my dentist was stumped and basically told me she had no idea why my gums kept bleeding. I went to a periodontist to get evaluated and they told me that I was experiencing beginning to moderate gum, disease, and that my previous dentist should have their license revoked because it was obvious to them what was happening . 

I brush twice a day thoroughly. I rarely drink alcohol and I don’t smoke. I try my best to stay away from sugar, and heavily acidic foods. I basically only drink water and unsweetened iced tea, with the occasional coffee. I floss after every meal, thoroughly. I use the C shaped method. When I floss, I am VERY diligent about my flossing, I need you to understand that I take my oral health VERY VERY seriously and so I have done an insane amount of research in order to understand how to properly keep my teeth and my gums healthy. So when I tell you that I am doing everything I possibly can with my all healthcare routine, I need you to take me seriously.

I do NOT have any underlying health issues. I’ve been evaluated by my doctor, I do not have diabetes, I do not have any forms of cancer, I do not have any disorders or any diseases at all. I take my health very, very seriously PLEASE understand this.

Despite the amount of care I take for my health, my gums are still receding, and they’re still a little bit of blood when I floss my teeth.

After my initial appointment with the periodontist a few months ago, they told me I needed a scaling done. I went in two weeks later to get the top and bottom done the same week. I was confused during both appointments because both cleanings took under 30 minutes. In fact, the first cleaning where they did my bottom teeth took less than 10 minutes. It took them longer to numb my mouth then it took them to actually clean my teeth. I questioned them about this, and they told me that the reason it probably didn’t take as long as it usually does for most people is that I probably didn’t have as much tartar underneath my gums for them to clean as most people do. This doesn’t make any sense, because when the doctor checked the depth of my gums, he was saying that the depths were between four and eight. I know that is horrific, so how is it that that is true, but it took less than 10 minutes to do a scaling for my teeth?

My question is, how can it be possible that despite the fact that I am a perfectly healthy otherwise, my gums are still receding, and my teeth are still bleeding a little bit when I floss? This is causing an immense amount of stress for me. Like I said, I started therapy because I was losing my mind. I couldn’t focus at work, I couldn’t sleep, I was barely eating because I was afraid to contribute to any sort of tartar that was happening beneath my gums, so my solution for that was to just not eat at all. I know all of this sounds ridiculous, but you need to understand that when you’re doing EVERYTHING that you possibly can do to keep your mouth and your body in general, healthy, AND you continue to see your gums recede, and you continue to see your gums bleed, this can cause an immense amount of anxiety and stress and depression.

Do I need to see another periodontist? It’s clear that my first dentist didn’t know what they were talking about, but I’m starting to believe that the periodontist that I switched to also has no idea what they’re doing. This should not be happening to me. I am losing my mind over this and I don’t know what to do anymore.

An alien council torn between intervention and inaction.  
And a forbidden scientist with a third option no one saw coming.

When the **Shalir**, a pre-spaceflight species, hurtle toward self-destruction, the uneasy alliance between **humans and the Korai** faces its most dangerous test yet. Lines blur between aid and interference, survival and sovereignty.

As missiles rise and secrets unravel, one question could change the galaxy:

**Can you save a world... without becoming its god?**

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The observation chamber aboard the joint diplomatic vessel *Concordia* hummed with activity as the newly formed Adaptive Council gathered for what would be their first real test. The massive dome-shaped room featured a central holographic display surrounded by workstations accommodating both human and Korai physiologies—an architectural compromise that mirrored the diplomatic one still finding its footing.

Ambassador Elena Chen arrived early, as was her habit. She moved to the viewing window that offered a direct look at the stars, specifically the Nereid Sector where a yellow-white sun harbored seven planets. The third from the center, Eiros-7, had captured the Council's attention. Her reflection in the glass revealed the fatigue she'd been trying to hide; three months of negotiating the Adaptive Council's operational parameters had taken their toll.

""You appear to require biochemical restoration, Ambassador Chen,"" came a voice from behind her.

Elena turned to find First Coordinator Vex-Tl standing just inside her personal space bubble—a concept the Korai were still learning to recognize. The insectoid diplomat's compound eyes reflected pinpricks of starlight, their faceted surface making it impossible to determine exactly where Vex-Tl was looking.

""Just tired, Coordinator,"" Elena replied with a diplomatic smile. ""Coffee would help, but I doubt the replicators have mastered the distinction between human stimulants and poison yet.""

""A distinction without difference, according to our xenobiologists,"" Vex-Tl's mandibles clicked in what Elena had come to recognize as their version of dry humor. ""Nonetheless, I have taken the liberty of procuring this.""

The Korai extended a sealed container that Elena accepted with surprise. Inside was unmistakably coffee—real coffee, not the synthetic version the ship's systems produced.

""My aide located this among your supply manifests,"" Vex-Tl explained. ""I reasoned optimal cognitive function would benefit our discussions today.""

Elena took a grateful sip. ""Thank you. That's... surprisingly thoughtful.""

""Thoughtfulness is adaptive,"" the Korai replied simply.

Before Elena could respond, the chamber doors hissed open to admit Professor Julian Atwell, Earth's senior anthropological advisor. The lanky academic clutched his data tablet like a shield.

""Ambassador, Coordinator,"" he acknowledged with a quick nod. ""The preliminary reports from our long-range scans are... concerning.""

""Save it for the formal briefing, Professor,"" Elena advised, noticing more Council members arriving. ""We'll all want to hear this together.""

Within minutes, the chamber filled with the remaining Council members. Dr. Marcus Rivera, the xenobiologist whose research had helped establish the first productive communication frameworks with the Korai, was engaged in animated conversation with his research assistant. Lieutenant Commander Diane Wu entered with her security team, conducting a routine sweep before positioning herself near the door—ever vigilant, even in supposedly friendly territory.

Most notable was the entrance of the Former Supreme Coordinator, whose recent demotion within the Korai hierarchy had been a surprise development of the Accord negotiations. The elder Korai moved with deliberate slowness, an affectation Elena suspected was meant to convey wisdom rather than frailty. Unlike Vex-Tl's metallic blue carapace, the Former Supreme Coordinator's exoskeleton had dulled to a burnished copper with age.

As the final members took their positions, Elena placed her empty coffee container aside and moved to the central platform.

""I call this emergency session of the Adaptive Council to order,"" she announced, activating the holographic display with a gesture. The planet Eiros-7 materialized in the center of the room, a blue-green sphere slowly rotating to reveal continents and oceans partially obscured by weather patterns and—more troublingly—expanding patches of atmospheric discoloration.

""Thank you all for convening on short notice,"" Elena continued. ""Professor Atwell and Dr. Rivera have discovered something that requires our immediate attention. Professor, please proceed.""

Atwell stepped forward, his tall frame hunched slightly as if bearing an invisible weight. ""Three standard days ago, our deep space monitoring array detected unusual radiation signatures from Eiros-7. Initial scans were inconclusive, so we deployed a stealthed observation drone to gather more detailed information."" He manipulated his tablet, and the hologram zoomed in to show topographical features of the planet's largest continent.

""What we found was this."" The hologram shifted to display clusters of settlements, primitive road networks, and unmistakable signs of early industrialization. ""A pre-spaceflight civilization we're calling the Shalir, based on fragments of communication we've intercepted. They appear to be in a development stage roughly equivalent to Earth's mid-20th century.""

Dr. Rivera stepped forward, his compact frame almost dwarfed by the hulking presence of the Former Supreme Coordinator beside him. ""The Shalir are humanoid, though with significant physiological differences. Quadrupedal locomotion, six-limbed with specialized manipulator appendages, and a sensory system that appears to prioritize something akin to echolocation over visual processing.""

""Their technological development is remarkably accelerated,"" Rivera continued, highlighting several urban centers that showed signs of rapid expansion. ""They've progressed from primitive metallurgy to nuclear capabilities in what we estimate to be less than two hundred years.""

First Coordinator Vex-Tl moved closer to the hologram, compound eyes scanning the data streams. ""Their nuclear capabilities have advanced beyond containment parameters,"" the Korai stated matter-of-factly. ""The Shalir species has reached the critical threshold. Our models predict self-extinction within twelve standard cycles.""

""Twelve cycles?"" Elena echoed. ""You mean months? That can't be right.""

""I've verified the Coordinator's calculations,"" Rivera admitted, projecting additional data onto the display. ""The Shalir have developed nuclear weapons technology without the corresponding social frameworks to manage them. They're divided into competing nation-states, each rapidly stockpiling armaments.""

""More concerning,"" Atwell added, ""we've detected unusual weather patterns consistent with climate destabilization. They're undergoing both a nuclear arms race and an environmental crisis simultaneously.""

The Former Supreme Coordinator's voice resonated through the chamber, carrying new undertones of diplomacy that had been absent during the tension-filled days of first contact. ""The Korai have observed seventeen civilizations destroy themselves at this precise developmental stage. We possess the capability to prevent this.""

""Seventeen?"" Lieutenant Commander Wu asked sharply from her position near the door. ""Your previous briefings only mentioned three such incidents.""

""Information was compartmentalized during initial diplomatic exchanges,"" Vex-Tl answered smoothly. ""Full disclosure was deemed potentially destabilizing to negotiations.""

Elena felt a flash of irritation. ""Transparency is essential to the Accord's function, Coordinator. We can't have selective disclosure of relevant facts.""

""A principle we are adapting to,"" the Former Supreme Coordinator acknowledged. ""Hence this disclosure now, when the information is directly relevant to Council deliberations.""

Professor Atwell cleared his throat. ""Regardless of previous cases, our current protocols are clear. The First Contact Protocol explicitly prohibits intervention in pre-spaceflight civilizations.""

""A protocol designed by humans,"" the Former Supreme Coordinator countered. ""Based on theoretical models rather than empirical observation. The Korai approach is informed by thousands of cycles of practical experience.""

""Through genetic manipulation, you mean,"" Atwell said, unable to keep the disapproval from his voice.

""Targeted enhancement,"" Vex-Tl corrected. ""Introducing specific genetic markers that promote cooperative reasoning and long-term planning. The process is precise, tested, and preserves the essential characteristics of the species.""

Elena watched the familiar lines of division forming. The Accord that had brought humans and Korai into uneasy alliance was built on compromise, but fundamental philosophical differences remained. Humans valued self-determination and natural development, while the Korai prioritized optimization and survival—sometimes at the cost of what humans would consider autonomy.

""You're talking about changing who they are without consent,"" Elena argued. ""That contradicts everything the Accord stands for.""

Dr. Rivera's fingers danced across his terminal, pulling up additional data streams. ""The situation isn't black and white, Ambassador. The Shalir have quadruple helix DNA, surprisingly similar to modifications Dr. Kane has been researching.""

""Kane?"" Lt. Commander Wu straightened, her hand unconsciously moving toward her sidearm. ""His research was suspended for ethical violations. He's not even supposed to have clearance for this kind of data.""

""Yet his insights could be valuable here,"" Rivera countered. ""His work on non-invasive genetic stabilization might offer a middle path.""

""Where is Dr. Kane now?"" Elena asked.

""In containment aboard the research vessel *Hypothesis*,"" Wu answered promptly. ""After his unauthorized experiments, the Science Directorate restricted his access to sensitive projects.""

The Former Supreme Coordinator moved closer to Elena, towering above her but adjusting its posture in what she recognized as a gesture of respect. ""You humans worry about interfering with their natural development. But extinction is not development. It is waste. These beings have potential to join the galactic community, to contribute their unique perspective. Would you sacrifice that potential for philosophical purity?""

Elena watched the planet turn in the holographic display, feeling the weight of the impossible choice before them. Millions, perhaps billions of lives hung in the balance. The Accord had been created to navigate exactly these kinds of moral quandaries, combining human ethical frameworks with Korai pragmatism.

""I propose a compromise,"" she said finally. ""We establish covert observation posts, gather more data before making irreversible decisions. If the situation is as critical as your models suggest, we should still have time to deliberate proper action.""

""While we deliberate, they prepare for war,"" Vex-Tl said, mandibles clicking in agitation. ""Time is not a luxury they have.""

A sudden alert flashed across the display, bathing the chamber in pulsing red light. Dr. Rivera's expression tightened as he interpreted the incoming data. ""Multiple launch signatures detected in the northern hemisphere. They've activated first-strike capabilities.""

""Thermal signatures consistent with missile launches,"" confirmed Wu's security officer from a monitoring station. ""Trajectory analysis suggests they're targeting rival population centers.""

Wu cursed under her breath. ""I thought we had more time.""

""The Council must decide now,"" the Former Supreme Coordinator insisted. ""Each moment of inaction condemns thousands to death.""

The hologram updated to show the missile trajectories—bright lines arcing across the planet's surface. In minutes, they would reach their targets, triggering what would likely become a chain reaction of retaliatory strikes.

""Can we intercept them?"" Elena asked Wu.

The security chief shook her head. ""Not without revealing our presence completely. And our directive prohibits technological intervention even more strictly than biological.""

Elena looked between her human colleagues and the Korai representatives. The divide between their approaches had never seemed wider, yet the need for unified action had never been more urgent.

""The Accord was formed precisely for moments like this,"" she said firmly. ""If we're truly adaptive, we need a third option beyond intervention or abandonment.""

""There is a way,"" came a voice from the chamber entrance.

All heads turned to see a disheveled human man standing in the doorway, flanked by two security officers with expressions that suggested they had been outmaneuvered rather than negligent. Dr. Elias Kane, brilliant and notorious in equal measure, stepped into the chamber with the confidence of someone who belonged there, despite all evidence to the contrary.

""Dr. Kane,"" Elena acknowledged, noting Wu's hand moving to her weapon again. ""This is a restricted Council session.""

""A session discussing my research,"" Kane replied, moving toward the holographic display with purpose. ""Research your Ethics Committee was too shortsighted to approve.""

Wu stepped forward. ""You're in violation of at least six security protocols, Doctor. Give me one reason not to have you removed immediately.""

Kane gestured to the hologram where the missile tracks continued their deadly progress. ""Because in approximately eight minutes, those missiles will reach their targets and render this entire discussion academic. I'm offering a solution that doesn't require choosing between your principles and their survival.""

""Explain,"" Vex-Tl demanded.

""Not genetic manipulation, but genetic education,"" Kane said, accessing a terminal despite Wu's protests. New data streams appeared alongside the planetary display. ""We introduce a targeted viral vector carrying non-coding DNA sequences—knowledge encoded in their own genetic language.""

""What kind of knowledge?"" Professor Atwell asked, professional curiosity momentarily overriding his concern about Kane's presence.

""Mathematical principles, basic physics, the molecular structure of their atmosphere. Not changing who they are, but giving them tools to recognize the path they're on,"" Kane explained. ""The vector would be completely non-invasive, designed to be read by their scientists rather than incorporated into their genome.""

""A genetic time capsule,"" Rivera whispered, understanding dawning on his face. ""Information, not alteration.""

""Precisely,"" Kane nodded. ""The Shalir already have research facilities studying their own genetic structure. They'll discover this information within months, interpret it as a breakthrough in their understanding.""

""It's still intervention,"" Wu pointed out, though her tone had softened slightly.

""Every First Contact has been intervention,"" Atwell countered. ""The question is what kind. This approach respects their agency while providing critical information.""

Elena saw the Former Supreme Coordinator's posture shift with interest. ""A... gift of knowledge. This respects their autonomy while providing aid.""

""It's inadequate,"" Vex-Tl argued. ""There is no guarantee they will interpret or apply the information correctly. Our genetic modifications ensure the necessary cognitive changes.""

""But they remain themselves,"" Elena countered. ""Their choices remain their own.""

The holographic display flashed again, showing new data. The missile trajectories had altered—some faltering, others changing course.

""They're standing down,"" Rivera reported with disbelief. ""At least some of the launches appear to have been aborted or diverted.""

""A temporary reprieve,"" the Former Supreme Coordinator cautioned. ""The fundamental instabilities remain.""

Elena studied the display, watching as the immediate crisis appeared to be subsiding even as the longer-term threats remained. They had been granted time, but not a solution.

""Prepare Kane's solution,"" she decided. ""If it proves viable upon further analysis, I'll authorize deployment before the Shalir reach another flashpoint.""

""Ambassador,"" Wu protested, ""Dr. Kane's presence here is unauthorized, let alone implementing his untested theories.""

""Then make it authorized,"" Elena countered. ""Assign him temporary clearance under your direct supervision, Commander. We need every viable option.""

As the Council members dispersed to their assigned tasks—Rivera and Kane to develop the genetic message, Wu to establish secure observation protocols, and Atwell to predict cultural impacts—Elena found herself alone with the Korai leaders.

""This is not how the Korai would resolve this situation,"" Vex-Tl observed.

""No,"" Elena agreed. ""But it's not solely a Korai decision anymore. That's the purpose of the Adaptive Council—finding solutions neither of our species would develop independently.""

The Former Supreme Coordinator's compound eyes reflected the slowly rotating planet. ""You place great faith in their capacity to save themselves, Ambassador Chen.""

""As did someone among your people, once,"" Elena replied. ""Otherwise, why adapt to cooperate with humans at all? Someone chose potential over predetermined outcomes.""

The elder Korai's mouth parts adjusted in what Elena was learning to recognize as contemplation. ""Perhaps humans and Korai can adapt to each other after all.""

Above them, Eiros-7 continued its rotation, oblivious to the decisions being made that would determine its fate—and test the fragile alliance between two species learning to share the stars.

As the observation chamber emptied, Dr. Kane found himself cornered by Lieutenant Commander Wu in the corridor outside.

""How exactly did you access a secure Council meeting, Doctor?"" she demanded, making no effort to hide her suspicion.

Kane smiled thinly. ""The Korai security systems are still being integrated with ours. The overlaps create... opportunities.""

""That doesn't answer my question.""

""No, it doesn't,"" Kane agreed. ""But perhaps a better question is why I'm the only one who saw this coming. Seventeen civilizations, Commander. The Korai have watched seventeen species destroy themselves. Don't you find it curious they've never shared details of those observations?""

Wu's eyes narrowed. ""What are you suggesting?""

""Only that there's more than one way to adapt,"" Kane replied cryptically, before nodding toward Rivera who was approaching with a data tablet. ""Now, shall we save a civilization, or continue this delightful interrogation?""

As Wu reluctantly escorted Kane toward the research labs, the Former Supreme Coordinator watched from an adjacent corridor, compound eyes unblinking. The ancient Korai activated a secure communication node embedded in its carapace.

""The humans have chosen intervention after all,"" it reported to an unseen recipient. ""But in their own way. Continue monitoring Phase Two adaptations. The hybridization proceeds as anticipated.""

Deep within the ship's massive engine section, something stirred in response—something neither fully human nor fully Korai, but perhaps the first true child of the Accord. The future of both species, adapting into something entirely new.

Tried pitching a new software to my CEO. I thought it was a solid idea.. I even tested it with my team members.

Felt confident since it could actually bring value to the team.

With pride and joy, I was about to have my first cup of coffee for the day…

Then the CEO messaged: ""huddle me in 15.""

My mind started racing. Heart pounding.

Needless to say, I skipped the coffee..  
  
Turns out, proposing something to your CEO is enough to give you the jitters.

*PS: After the meeting, I went for tea instead… needed to calm my nerves.*

There’s a certain kind of connection I still believe in — the kind that doesn’t come from endless swiping or casual conversations that never go anywhere. Something slower, real, built on the small, invisible threads that slowly, quietly weave two lives together.

About me:

I’m someone who feels deeply but doesn’t always show it right away. I value authenticity — the quiet strength it takes to be vulnerable, and the rare beauty of being seen for who you really are. I’m independent, grounded, and ambitious in my own life, but I have this soft side that not many people get to see. I’m the kind of person who will remember the little things you tell me, who believes in showing up for the people I care about.

I appreciate deep conversations, shared laughter, inside jokes, and even the comfortable silences that only come when two people are truly at ease with each other. I’m not interested in perfection. I’m interested in real — the unfiltered, messy, beautiful reality of two people figuring it out together.

I love simple pleasures: morning walks, good coffee, the feeling of being completely absorbed in a great book or a meaningful conversation. I care about growth — my own and others’ — and I’m drawn to people who are self-aware, kind-hearted, and curious about the world.

I’m looking for someone who wants more than surface-level. Someone who is willing to show up as they are, and who’s also looking for something lasting — a true partnership, not just a temporary distraction.

If that resonates with you, I’d love to hear from you. Maybe we could be the start of something rare.

Tell me something you love that most people don’t know about you.

I stepped off the bus into Nevada heat that punched through my uniform. The driver tossed my duffel beside me and pulled away, leaving a cloud of dust that settled on my polished boots. Behind a chain-link fence topped with razor wire stood Bravo Mike—seven squat buildings arranged in a horseshoe around a central courtyard. Nothing special. Nothing that screamed classified.



A corporal met me at the gate. ""Wilson? Follow me.""



The processing took less than an hour. I signed forms without reading them, got assigned quarters, and received my shift schedule. No welcome speech, no tour. Just paperwork and a set of keys. The corporal pointed me toward the barracks and walked away. So much for orientation.



My room was standard military—twin bed, metal desk, small closet. The window faced west, showing nothing but desert and distant mountains. I unpacked my few personal items, made my bed to regulation corners, and sat down to write my mother. Halfway through the letter, I realized I couldn't tell her anything about where I was or what I'd be doing. I ended up with three paragraphs about the weather and a promise to call when I could.



That night, I reported for my first shift. The operations center sat in the middle of the base—a windowless concrete box with a single reinforced door. Inside, screens lined the walls showing radar sweeps, atmospheric readings, and satellite imagery. Eight workstations faced the screens, each with its own computer setup and uncomfortable chair.



""Wilson,"" a voice called from behind me. ""Station four is yours.""



I turned to see a woman about my age with auburn hair pulled tight into a regulation bun. She held a clipboard and looked me over without smiling.



""Thanks. And you are?""



""Bane. Natalie Bane. I'm on your rotation."" She handed me a thick binder. ""Standard operating procedures. Memorize it by tomorrow.""



I took the binder. ""What exactly are we monitoring?""



Her expression didn't change. ""Atmospheric disturbances.""



""What kind of—""



""Just read the manual, Wilson."" She walked away, posture straight as a ruler.



The night crawled by. I watched numbers change on screens, logged readings every thirty minutes, and fought to stay awake. Nothing in my training had prepared me for the pure tedium of Bravo Mike. By morning, I'd read the entire manual and still had no clear idea what we were looking for.



Three days later, I was eating alone in the mess when Bane sat across from me, dropping her tray with a clatter.



""Wilson,"" she said, fork already stabbing at something pretending to be meatloaf.



""Bane.""



We ate in silence for a few minutes. The mess hall hummed with low conversations, metal scraping against trays, the kitchen staff yelling orders.



""Did you figure it out yet?"" she finally asked.



""Figure what out?""



She leaned forward. ""What we're actually doing here.""



I shook my head. ""Atmospheric monitoring seems pretty straightforward.""



She snorted. ""Right. And they need a hundred personnel and triple-layer security for that.""



I glanced around, lowering my voice. ""You think there's something else?""



""I know there is."" She took a bite, chewed, swallowed. ""Whatever we're watching for, it's not just weather.""



Before I could respond, the mess hall door swung open and Sergeant Thomas Cooper walked in. The room went quiet. Cooper was tall with the kind of military bearing that made you want to stand at attention even in the shower. His eyes swept the room once, paused briefly on our table, then moved on. The conversations slowly resumed, but quieter than before.



""That's our fearless leader,"" Natalie said, not looking up from her food. ""Sergeant Cooper. Man of mystery and zero explanations.""



""You've worked with him before?""



""Six months. Never heard him say more than twenty words at a time."" She pushed her tray away. ""Just follow orders, Wilson. That's all anyone does here.""



Weeks passed. The desert winter brought cold nights and clear skies. I settled into the rhythm of Bravo Mike—eat, work, sleep, repeat. The tedium became comfortable. I got to know the others on my shift rotation. Martinez always brought homemade jerky. Chen could solve crosswords in ten minutes flat. Rogers kept a picture of his kids hidden under his keyboard.



And then there was Natalie. We got paired on night shifts often, midnight to eight, when the base slept and the screens glowed in the dark. She relaxed around three a.m., when the coffee kicked in and fatigue lowered defenses. We talked about home, about training, about the food in the mess hall. Never about what we were monitoring.



""I'm from Michigan,"" she told me one night, feet propped on her desk. ""Little town on Lake Huron you never heard of.""



""Try me.""



""Harrisville.""



I laughed. ""My grandparents had a cabin in Greenbush. We went up every summer.""



Her eyes lit up. ""No way. Small world.""



After that, night shifts felt less like duty and more like time with a friend. We developed a shorthand for the boring parts of the job. She'd catch me nodding off and flick paper clips at my head. I'd bring extra coffee when she looked tired. Small things. Normal things in an abnormal place.



Cooper rarely visited during night shifts. When he did, it was just to check logs and leave. No small talk, no interest in his personnel beyond their function. I heard stories from others—how he'd dress down anyone who asked too many questions, how he kept his own quarters separate from everyone else's, how no one had ever seen him laugh.



""Blind obedience,"" Natalie whispered one night after he left. ""That's his motto.""



I shrugged. ""He's military.""



""There's military, and then there's whatever Cooper is.""



January slipped into February. Nothing changed in the rhythm of Bravo Mike except the temperature outside. I'd been there long enough to stop counting days. Long enough that most nights I could do my job on autopilot, logging readings without really seeing them. Long enough that Natalie started bringing extra granola bars because she noticed I always got hungry around four.



On February 18th, I showed up for midnight shift as usual. Chen was finishing his rotation, eyes bloodshot from eight hours of screen time.



""All quiet,"" he said, standing up from station four. ""Enjoy the boredom.""



I settled in, logging my start time. Natalie arrived five minutes later, coffee already in hand.



""Extra shot of espresso tonight,"" she said, taking her seat at station six. ""Had a feeling we might need it.""



I didn't ask why. Some nights she just had hunches.



The first four hours passed like any other shift. We monitored, we logged, we talked about nothing important. At 4:17 a.m., the door opened. Cooper walked in, looking exactly as he always did—pressed uniform, perfect posture, expression carved from stone. But something was different. It took me a second to realize he was carrying a sealed manila envelope.



He walked straight to my station. ""Wilson.""



I sat up straighter. ""Yes, Sergeant?""



""You have new orders."" He placed the envelope on my desk. ""Read them, memorize them, then destroy them. You have five minutes.""



He stepped back, watching me. I felt Natalie's eyes on me too, but didn't look her way. The envelope had no markings except a red stamp reading ""CLASSIFIED"" across the seal. I broke it open and pulled out a single sheet of paper.



The orders were simple but made no sense. I was to proceed to Building C, Room 217, and wait for further instruction. I was not to discuss these orders with anyone. I was not to deviate from the prescribed route. I was to bring no electronic devices.



I memorized the instructions, then handed the paper back to Cooper. He took a lighter from his pocket and burned it, letting the ashes fall into a trash can.



""Report to Building C now,"" he said. ""Bane, you're coming too.""



Natalie looked up, surprised. ""Me, Sergeant?""



""Different assignment, same destination. Move out.""



We followed Cooper out of the operations center into the cold desert night. Stars filled the sky, so many they seemed to crowd each other out. Our breath made clouds in front of us as we walked across the courtyard toward Building C—the one structure at Bravo Mike I'd never entered.



Cooper unlocked a series of doors, each requiring different keys and codes. The deeper we went, the heavier the doors became. The final door was steel, at least six inches thick, with no handle on our side. Cooper entered a code, placed his palm on a scanner, and stepped back as the door slid open.



""Inside,"" he said.



The room beyond was small and spartanly furnished—a few chairs arranged in a line facing a reinforced window that took up most of one wall. The window looked out on nothing but darkness. Four other airmen were already seated, staring straight ahead. I recognized Martinez and Rogers from our shift rotation. The other two were from different rotations—Peterson and Chang, I thought.



Natalie took a seat, and I sat beside her. Cooper remained by the door, checking his watch.



""You are here to observe only,"" he said, his voice flatter than usual. ""What happens outside that window is classified Level Eight. You will not discuss it with anyone, not even each other, after you leave this room. Is that clear?""



Six voices answered as one: ""Yes, Sergeant.""



Cooper nodded once. ""ETA three minutes.""



No one spoke after that. I glanced at Natalie, but her focus was on the window. Outside, I could now make out a perimeter road running along the base fence line. Floodlights activated suddenly, illuminating the area in harsh white light. In the distance, dust plumes rose from the desert floor.



A convoy of vehicles appeared, racing toward the base at high speed. Five vehicles—three armored personnel carriers sandwiching two heavy transport trucks. They swerved occasionally, as if avoiding obstacles, but maintained their heading toward the base.



Behind them, at first just a dark mass against the horizon, something moved. Something big. As it neared the floodlights' range, I caught glimpses of shape—impossibly tall, with multiple limbs that seemed to both walk and flow across the desert floor. It moved with fluid grace despite its size, closing the gap on the convoy with each stride.



My mouth went dry. Beside me, Natalie's breathing quickened. I felt her hand find mine in the darkness, gripping tight.



The door behind us opened. Cooper stepped back in, his face drained of color. He looked at each of us in turn, then at the window where the creature was now clearly visible—a nightmare fifty feet tall, with jointed legs like a spider's and a mockery of a human face stretched across what might have been a head.



""You are to watch only,"" he said, his voice hollow. ""Under no circumstances are you to interfere or attempt to engage the entity. This is a direct order.""

The sirens started wailing mid-sentence, cutting through Cooper's order with a sound like steel being tortured. I jolted in my chair. Everyone did. The floodlights outside flickered twice, then blazed even brighter, painting harsh shadows across the desert.



Cooper's radio crackled. He pulled it from his belt, listened for three seconds, then slammed it back into place.



""Stay here,"" he barked, and was gone through the door before anyone could respond.



I turned back to the window. The convoy had reached the outer fence, the lead vehicle smashing through the gate in a shower of chain-link and concrete. Behind them, the thing—Goliath, I heard someone whisper—moved with a grace that defied its bulk. Its limbs bent at impossible angles, covering ground in loping strides that ate up the distance between it and the perimeter wall.



""Jesus,"" Martinez breathed next to me. ""It has to be thirty feet tall.""



It was bigger than that. Much bigger.



Natalie's fingers dug into my sleeve, but I couldn't look away from the window to check on her. The creature moved like nothing I'd ever seen—not running exactly, but flowing, each limb finding perfect placement despite its speed. It reached the perimeter wall just as the last convoy vehicle cleared the inner gate.



Personnel scattered across the compound. Some ran for cover. Others moved with purpose toward defensive positions I hadn't known existed. Mounted guns emerged from hidden emplacements along the wall. Soldiers poured from barracks buildings in various states of dress, grabbing weapons from an armory truck that had appeared in the center of the base.



Goliath hit the wall and didn't slow. Its front limbs—too many, I couldn't count them—latched onto the concrete. The thing's body twisted, and it went up and over the thirty-foot barrier like a spider scaling a bathroom tile. No hesitation. No effort.



Something caught in my throat.



""They can't stop it,"" Chang said from the end of the row. ""Nothing could stop that.""



A single shot cracked through the night. Then another. Then a barrage as panic spread through the ranks outside. The guards on the wall opened fire against orders, their discipline crumbling in the face of the impossible. Tracer rounds cut bright paths through the darkness, passing through the creature's body as if through smoke. It didn't flinch. Didn't even seem to notice.



Once inside the wall, Goliath moved with terrible purpose. It surged toward the nearest cluster of soldiers, limbs extended. I couldn't see clearly what happened next—just bodies flying, blood spraying in patterns too perfect to be real. Screams reached us even through the reinforced glass.



""We have to help,"" I said, half-rising. No one moved with me.



""Orders,"" Rogers muttered, though he looked sick.



Outside, Cooper appeared from a side door, running toward a group of soldiers who'd formed a defensive line. He grabbed a radio from one of them, shouting orders we couldn't hear. More personnel emerged from buildings, taking up positions, creating a corridor through which the convoy could pass.



The trucks and APCs made straight for the largest structure on base—a hangar I'd only ever seen from the outside. Doors three stories high began to slide open, revealing darkness within.



Goliath paused, its head-like upper section swiveling toward the hangar. It changed direction instantly, abandoning a group of soldiers it had been cutting through. It moved toward the convoy with new urgency.



Cooper saw it coming. He directed soldiers to fall back, waving them toward secondary positions. Too slow. Far too slow. Goliath covered the distance in seconds, looming over Cooper and the men around him. For a heartbeat, nothing happened. Cooper stood his ground, sidearm raised in a gesture that seemed almost comical given the scale of the threat.



The creature's limb lashed out faster than I could track. Cooper disappeared in its grip, lifted high above the ground. For a terrible moment I could see him struggling, a tiny figure against the night sky.



Then he came apart.



There's no other way to say it. His body separated into pieces, and those pieces fell like rain onto the men below. The blood looked black under the floodlights. A sound escaped Natalie beside me—not quite a scream, something smaller and more broken.



I found myself on my feet without remembering standing. My palm pressed against the glass, useless. Natalie's nails dug into my other arm, breaking skin. I barely felt it. Outside, soldiers died by the dozens. Some shot themselves rather than be taken by the creature. Others ran blindly, only to be snatched up and torn apart.



The convoy reached the hangar. The middle truck backed in first, followed by the others. Soldiers swarmed around them, unloading something long and cylindrical from the lead vehicle. It took eight men to carry it, moving with urgent care toward the depths of the hangar. Whatever it was, they treated it like it might shatter—or explode.



Once it disappeared inside, the hangar doors began to close. Goliath froze in place. Its limbs retracted slightly, drawing close to its body. The misshapen head turned, scanning the compound with a deliberate motion that somehow conveyed intelligence.



Then, with the same fluid motion it had approached with, it retreated. It scaled the wall again, dropping to the other side, and moved back into the desert darkness from which it had emerged. Within seconds, it was just a silhouette against the stars. Then nothing at all.



The silence that followed seemed heavier than the chaos before it. On base, survivors stumbled between bodies. Medics appeared with stretchers that quickly ran out. The wounded screamed for help that couldn't come fast enough. The dead stared upward, their faces masks of terror frozen in place.



No one in our viewing room spoke. What was there to say? We'd watched dozens of our fellow airmen die in ways that defied understanding. We'd seen our commanding officer torn to pieces. We'd witnessed something impossible.



We sat there until the first gray light of dawn crept over the eastern mountains. No one came to dismiss us or give new orders. The six of us stayed, shoulder to shoulder, afraid to be the first to move, afraid to break whatever fragile thing was keeping us sane.



The blood on my arm dried where Natalie's nails had dug in. I didn't wipe it away. It was the only thing that felt real.

I woke to a fist pounding on my door. Didn't remember falling asleep. My clothes felt glued to my skin, stiff with dried sweat. The clock read 09:17.



""Wilson! Open up!""



Military police. Two of them filled my doorway in combat gear with sidearms unholstered. Behind them stood a man in a dark suit who looked like he'd stepped out of a government pamphlet—crew cut, blank expression, unremarkable in every way that screamed federal agent.



""Come with us,"" the taller MP said.



I didn't ask questions. Didn't even change clothes. The base looked wrong in daylight—bloodstains on concrete, bullet casings scattered like seeds, body bags lined up outside the infirmary. Twenty-seven of them. I counted twice.



They led me to the admin building and into a windowless room with a metal table bolted to the floor. The suit followed, closing the door with a click that echoed like a gunshot.



""James Wilson,"" he said, not a question. ""I'm Agent Reed. You're going to tell me everything you saw.""



The questions went on for hours. Each answer recorded, timestamped, filed away. I told him about the convoy, the creature, Cooper. My throat went dry. They didn't offer water.



""Did the entity communicate with anyone?"" Reed asked.



""No.""



""Did you observe any weaknesses?""



""Bullets passed through it.""



""Were there any unusual smells, sounds, or atmospheric disturbances?""



I remembered the stillness before it appeared. ""No.""



More questions. Same ones rephrased. Reed checking my face for lies I wasn't telling. Eventually he slid papers across the table—pages of legal text with red tabs marking signature lines.



""Standard non-disclosure agreement,"" he said.



Nothing standard about it. Phrases jumped out like warnings: ""lifetime obligation,"" ""matters of national security,"" ""prosecution for treason,"" ""minimum penalty.""



""What happens if I don't sign?""



Reed didn't blink. ""Prison. For a very long time.""



I signed.



They released me at sunset. I stumbled back to my quarters past clean-up crews hosing blood into drains. No sign of the bodies. No sign anything had happened except for sections of missing wall and bullet holes in concrete.



My room had been searched. Drawers left open, bed stripped, personal items moved. I collapsed anyway, too empty to care.



At 06:00 the next morning, transfer orders arrived—Osan Air Base, South Korea. Effective immediately. A corporal I'd never seen before handed me the paperwork and said I had two hours to pack.



I tried calling Natalie's quarters. No answer. Went to her barracks. Found it empty, bed stripped, closet cleaned out. Asked around. No one had seen her.



Forty minutes before my transport left, I found Martinez loading his gear into a truck.



""You seen Bane?"" I asked.



He glanced around before answering. ""Ramstein.""



""Germany?""



""Shipped out at dawn. They're scattering everyone who was in that room."" He slammed the truck door shut. ""Don't try to contact anyone. They're watching.""



The flight to Osan lasted sixteen hours. I spent it staring at the seat back, replaying that night, seeing Cooper pulled apart, hearing the screams cut short. The airman next to me asked twice if I was okay. I lied both times.



South Korea blurred past. Days became weeks. I did my job. Filed reports. Followed orders. At night, I wrote letters to Natalie that came back stamped ""UNDELIVERABLE."" Sent emails that bounced. Called numbers that didn't connect.



After three months, a message reached my terminal: ""Stop trying. —N""



I stopped.



The nightmares started in month four. Always the same—Goliath finding me, lifting me like it had Cooper, my body coming apart like cheap fabric. I'd wake twisted in sheets, throat raw from screams I hadn't heard myself make.



My roommate requested a transfer. Can't blame him.



The military doctor prescribed pills that turned the dreams to static. Better than watching myself die every night. I took them until they stopped working, then got stronger ones. Worked my way through the pharmacy until nothing helped.



Found bourbon instead.



Finished my service in 2013 and settled in Denver. Rented a one-bedroom near downtown and landed an IT security job I could do half-drunk. The HR manager who hired me had a brother in the Air Force. Military discount, she called it.



Tried therapy. VA doc with a beard and coffee breath who nodded at my vague descriptions of ""combat trauma"" and wrote prescriptions that joined the others in my medicine cabinet. Couldn't tell him the truth. Couldn't tell anyone.



Tuesday nights I'd meet other vets at a bar off Colfax. They talked about Afghanistan, Iraq, IEDs, and firefights. Real horrors, human horrors. I'd nod like I understood, drink until their faces blurred, then stumble home to my empty apartment.



Six years passed. I functioned. Held jobs. Dated women who eventually got tired of the parts of me I couldn't explain. Drank less, worked more. Started running until my lungs burned and my legs went numb. Pain helped. Made other things fade.



In 2019, I was doing contract work for a Seattle firm. Security audit, two weeks on-site. Boring work in a rainy city. One night I walked into a twenty-four-hour diner near my hotel, soaked from a sudden downpour.



And there she was. Natalie. Sitting in a corner booth with medical textbooks spread around her, red pen between her teeth, hair pulled back in the same tight bun. Six years older but unmistakable.



She looked up as the bell above the door jingled. Our eyes met. Neither of us moved.



""Wilson,"" she finally said, red pen hovering.



""Bane.""



The waitress appeared, coffee pot in hand. I ordered a cup I didn't want. Walked to Natalie's booth and sat without asking. She closed her books, one by one.



""You look..."" she started.



""Older.""



""I was going to say dry. It's pouring outside.""



""I just came in.""



Awkward silence stretched between us, years of it packed into seconds. I suddenly couldn't remember why I'd approached her. What was there to say?



She broke first. ""Do you still have the dreams?""



The question hit like cold water. No preamble, no small talk. Just straight to the wound.



""Every night,"" I admitted.



""Me too."" She pushed a textbook aside. ""Sometimes I think I see it on the street, just for a second. A shape that doesn't fit. A shadow that moves wrong.""



""I check the locks twice,"" I said. ""Always.""



""Three times,"" she countered with half a smile.



We talked until the waitress stopped refilling our cups. Traded theories about what Goliath was, why the government covered it up, where it came from. Compared transfer locations, dead ends, nightmares. Discovered we'd both tried the same medications with the same results.



I came back the next night. And the next. My two-week contract stretched to three. We moved from the diner to a bar, from the bar to walks along the waterfront. On my last night in Seattle, she invited me back to her apartment.



It wasn't romantic. We were two broken pieces that somehow fit together. Two people who didn't have to lie about the worst night of their lives. The relief of that was better than any painkiller.



I extended my stay again. Found local work. Moved into a studio twenty minutes from her place. We dated like normal people—dinner, movies, weekend trips to the coast. But underneath it ran a current of shared trauma that kept us close when any sane person would've walked away.



""Sometimes I think they put us in different countries to see if we'd break,"" she said one night, fingers tracing circles on my chest. ""Like an experiment.""



""Did you?""



""Break? No."" She shook her head against my shoulder. ""Bend, maybe. You?""



""Same.""



When she moved in with me six months later, the nightmares came less often. By the time I proposed a year after that, they'd faded to once a week. Sometimes less.



We got married in a courthouse with two strangers as witnesses. No family, no friends. Just us, the way it had been since that night in Room 217. Easier that way. Fewer questions about how we met, where we served, why we woke up screaming.



Natalie finished nursing school. I built my security consulting business. We bought a small house in the suburbs with good schools nearby. Planted a garden. Got a dog. Normal life. Suburban life. The kind of life that feels like a shield against darker things.



Robert was born on a cold January morning in 2022. Seven pounds, four ounces. Perfect in every way. The moment I held him, something shifted inside me—a wall coming down or a light coming on. I'd been broken for so long I'd forgotten what wholeness felt like.



""He has your eyes,"" Natalie said, exhausted and beautiful in her hospital bed.



""Your nose.""



""Poor kid.""



We brought him home to a nursery painted soft blue. A mobile hung above his crib—stars and moons spinning in lazy circles. At night I'd hold him while Natalie slept, watching his tiny chest rise and fall, listening to his breath.



The nightmares stopped completely. Not fewer—gone. For the first time in thirteen years, I slept through the night. Every night.



We settled into routines. Diaper changes, midnight feedings, first smiles. Natalie worked three twelve-hour shifts at the hospital while I stayed home with Robert. Then we'd switch—she'd take over while I caught up on client work. We were tired in the good way parents are tired. Normal tired.



I built a security system for our house. Motion sensors, cameras, smart locks. Natalie pretended not to notice I checked the footage every morning. I pretended not to notice the bat she kept by the bed. Old habits, worn smooth like river stones.



Some nights we'd sit on the back porch after Robert went down, drinking beer and watching stars come out. Not talking much. Not needing to. The weight we carried had become familiar, almost comfortable in its constancy.



""Do you ever wonder if it's still out there?"" she asked once.



""No,"" I lied.



""Me neither,"" she lied back.



But we both knew better. Something that large, that impossible, doesn't just disappear. The government didn't lock us down because it was a one-time event. They did it because they knew it would happen again.



Still, we had built something good. Something real. A life filled with first steps and client meetings and Sunday pancakes. A life where Goliath was just a fading memory, a story we'd never tell our son.

I pulled the stack of mail from our box and thumbed through it on the walk back to the house. Bills. Credit card offer. Something from Natalie's sister. And beneath that, a manila envelope with no return address.



My fingers knew before my brain caught up. Same weight. Same texture. Same government issue I hadn't held in thirteen years.



I stopped in the middle of the sidewalk. Our neighbor's sprinklers ticked through their cycle. A kid rode past on a bike, baseball card clicking in the spokes. I turned the envelope over and checked the postmark. Rachel, Nevada. 



The only thing in Rachel was dust and the road to Bravo Mike.



Inside our kitchen, I set the other mail down and grabbed a knife from the drawer. Careful cut along the top edge. Clean. Controlled. The knife shook anyway.



Inside was a note card. Three words in red ink: ""He is coming.""



The handwriting wasn't Cooper's. Cooper was dead. I'd watched him die. But someone from Bravo Mike had sent this. Someone who knew.



I fumbled for my phone and hit Natalie's contact. It rang five times before she answered.



""Hey,"" she said, sounds of the hospital bustling behind her. ""I'm between patients. Everything okay?""



""No."" My voice came out wrong—tight and small. ""You need to come home. Now.""



A pause. ""What happened?""



""Bravo Mike.""



Two words. That's all it took. I heard her breathing change.



""I'll tell them it's an emergency,"" she said. ""Twenty minutes.""



I hung up and opened the hall closet. Behind winter coats and shoe boxes were two black duffel bags we'd packed years ago. Grab-and-go bags with cash, documents, clothes, first aid kits. Things we hoped we'd never need. I pulled them out and set them by the front door.



Next was Robert's room. He was napping, one arm flung above his head, blanket kicked off. I gathered his essentials as quietly as I could—diapers, wipes, formula, clothes, his favorite stuffed dog. Packed it all in his diaper bag and added it to the pile.



Natalie burst through the door nineteen minutes after my call. Her face was flushed, hair coming loose from her bun.



""What is it?"" she demanded.



I handed her the card. She read it three times, lips moving silently.



""Who sent this?"" she finally asked.



""Postmark says Rachel. Only thing near there is the base.""



""We destroyed all records of where we were going.""



""Someone kept track,"" I said.



She set the card down like it might bite. ""You think it's real? Not someone messing with us?""



""Who else knows about him? About what happened? The government buried it all.""



She nodded, already moving toward our bedroom. ""How much time do we have?""



""No idea.""



We'd rehearsed this scenario in our heads for years. What we'd take. Where we'd go. How fast we could disappear. Now that it was happening, the plan felt flimsy, full of holes.



""I'll get Robert,"" Natalie said, voice steady despite the fear in her eyes. ""You load the car.""



I grabbed our bags and headed outside. The afternoon sun cast long shadows across our driveway as I popped the trunk and arranged our things. Checked the gas tank—three-quarters full. Not ideal, but enough to get distance before we needed to stop.



Something felt wrong. I paused, keys in hand, listening. No birds. No neighborhood sounds. Just the faint hiss of someone's sprinkler two houses down. It was too quiet.



Natalie appeared with Robert bundled against her chest, still sleepy from his nap.



""Car seat,"" she said.



I helped her secure him in the back, his tiny face scrunched in confusion. He sensed our panic. Kids always know.



""Where are we going?"" Natalie asked, climbing into the passenger seat.



""East. Away from the coast."" I started the engine. ""We can figure out details once we're moving.""



""Should we try to contact the others? Martinez? Chang?""



""Martinez is overseas. No idea where Chang ended up."" I backed out of the driveway. ""Try Michael. He's in Portland.""



Natalie pulled out her phone while I scanned the street. Still unnaturally quiet. No dog walkers. No kids playing. Nobody checking mail.



""Voicemail,"" she said after a moment. ""Michael, it's Natalie Bane from Bravo Mike. If you're getting this, you might be in danger. Call me immediately."" She left her number and hung up.



Robert started crying as we turned onto the main road. Not his usual fussy cry—this was different. Frightened. Natalie twisted in her seat to comfort him.



""It's okay, baby. We're just going on a trip.""



The lie sounded hollow even to me.



I hit the gas harder than necessary, tires chirping on asphalt. The car picked up speed as we approached the intersection that would take us to the highway. Three more blocks. Two. One.



The ground trembled. So slight I might have missed it if I hadn't been waiting for something. Anything. A vibration that traveled up through the wheels and into the steering column.



I checked the rearview mirror. Four blocks back, between houses, something moved. Something large. A distortion in the air like heat waves, but sharper. More defined.



""James,"" Natalie said, voice barely audible.



""I see it.""



Robert's cries grew louder. I pressed the accelerator to the floor. The engine roared in protest as we shot through a yellow light and onto the entrance ramp.



""Call Michael again,"" I said.



Natalie tried three times. No answer.



""Where are we going?"" she asked, strain breaking through her calm facade.



The truth formed in my stomach like a stone. ""I don't know.""



Goliath was back. The creature that had torn apart Cooper and dozens of others thirteen years ago had found us. Whether it had been hunting us all this time or just now picked up our trail didn't matter. It was here.



I merged onto the highway at twenty over the speed limit, weaving between cars. In the back seat, Robert's cries had softened to whimpers. Natalie reached back to touch his leg, her hand trembling slightly.



""How did it find us?"" she asked.



""I don't know that either.""



Thirteen years of nightmares. Thirteen years of jumping at shadows and checking locks. Thirteen years of telling ourselves we were safe, that it was over. All blown away by three words on a note card.



I pushed the car faster, watching the rearview mirror more than the road ahead. Nothing followed—no massive shape flowing over asphalt, no spider-like limbs reaching between vehicles. But that didn't mean it wasn't coming.



""We need a plan,"" Natalie said. ""Somewhere it can't find us.""



But we both knew there was no such place. We'd seen what Goliath could do. How it moved. How it hunted. How it killed.



""We keep driving,"" I said, knuckles white on the steering wheel. ""We don't stop until we have to.""



The highway stretched before us, carrying us away from our home, away from the life we'd built. But not away from the nightmare. Never away from that.



It had only just begun.

1k7z89x,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1k7z89x/i_asked_a_guy_to_have_a_coffee_together_he_wants/,"I asked a guy to have a coffee together; he wants to meet, but has a girlfriend","Hi all, 
I (31f) am wondering about something and would like to know how you all see it.

We have a new guy (m/I guess around same age as me) at training and eventually we began to flirt a bit. That was maybe 3-4 weeks ago, we train once per week. One day he began to smile at me a certain way. He says goodbye to me with a certain gesture and saying my name, and he only does it with me.
So I thought I just ask him per text message if we want to meet and have a coffee together. 
He immediately replied with a ""Sure, I'd love to"" and suggested next time before training. 
So far, so good.
But further he wrote this week he's in another european town with his girlfriend where they watch the pet of his cousin. 
This is where my confusion began.
I mean, fine, he has a gf. I didn't know it, I rather had the impression he was single. But from my side, we don't really have to meet then. It's not a big issue we have to discuss personally to get everything right between us. And I'd think most women are not exited to know their man is meeting another woman he barely knows for coffee.
I would have expected he would write something with a message like ""Hey, thank you for asking but I have a gf and wouldn't meet other women then. Lets just stay on friendly terms in training."" 
Which would have been fine by me. 

But now I wanted to find out in which direction this would go so I wrote back that I can't that evening (which is true) and won't even make it to training. 
And if he can another time. He answered ""Definitely"" and that he's just a bit busy that week, but he will see, and finally ""Lets do it spontaneously"". 
 
And now I'm just really confused about what his intention is.

He can't be doing all this and try to find a time to just tell me he only wants to be friends, right?

I have a different feeling and I don't like that thought very much because of his girlfriend. 
But maybe I'm seeing it wrong.

How do you all see this?

Okay, friends, let’s dive into this! Picture this: you wake up, and instead of the usual, chaotic scramble to get your day started, everything you need is already handled. Sounds dreamy, right? If you could just hit a button and automate one thing in your life for peak performance, what would it be? 🤔

Here are some thoughts that crossed my mind when I was wrestling with this question:

**1. Morning Routine**  
Imagine your alarm *gently* wakes you up with your favorite playlist instead of that jarring beep. You get out of bed, and BOOM! Breakfast is ready, coffee is brewed, and your workout gear is laid out. You could literally have a *stress-free* morning!  
- No more “What should I eat?” dilemmas  
- No messy kitchen to deal with  
- Less caffeine-induced panic (we all know that struggle!)

**2. Email Management**  
Can we talk about the sheer avalanche of emails? 😩 Automating this would mean zero inbox clutter. You could set rules for emails to sort themselves. Promotion emails? *Junk folder*. Important messages? *Priority inbox.* Your brain cells would thank you for not having to sift through that mess daily.  
- More time for creative projects  
- Less decision fatigue  
- Maybe even some peace of mind!

**3. Fitness Tracking**  
Okay, hear me out. Instead of logging every single workout and meal, what if your fitness app could just analyze your habits and serve you personalized recommendations? “Hey, you know that workout you did last Wednesday? Do it again, but add a twist with that leg extension!”  
- Tailored fitness advice based on your mood  
- No more staring blankly at workout videos  
- Just pure, unadulterated gains! 💪

**4. Goal Setting**  
Imagine a world where your goals are tracked, reminded, and even adjusted by an automated system. “Hey there! It’s time to check in on that resolution you made!” This could streamline your journey toward your aspirations so that you’re not constantly reminding yourself about them.  
- You’d never forget your progress  
- No more guilt trips when you skip a day  
- It would feel like having a personal cheerleader! 🎉

So, friends, which one of these resonates with you the most? Or do you have your own automation dream? Maybe you’d want to automate cleaning your house (we wish!). Let's face it, the *endless pile of laundry* isn't doing us any favors and wouldn't complain about a robot taking over that chore!

1k7yw18,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1k7yw18/random_paris_notes_from_my_recent_trip/,Random Paris notes from my recent trip,"So I've just gotten back from a 2 week vacation in France (and I say France because I stayed outside of Paris for about half the time - anyone interested in my notes outside Paris - which was Nice, Monaco, and Normandy - can reach out) and have some random little anecdotes that might help some future travelers. This is by no means a blow by blow description of my trip but more random Seinfield-esque observations and notes.

1. I think going to France at this particularly weird US Tariffs time has made the trip more expensive than usual - imho - because I believe only a few months ago the values of euros to usd were much closer than they are now. So your 200 euro amount is more like 250 in usd (as opposed to maybe an expected 220). Soooo I'd consider that a little bit of you haven't booked anything yet and really want to budget your trip - or have booked your trip but want to be more fiscally prepared. 

2. I thought going end of April was a BEAUTIFUL time to go - but the weather is really schizo this time of year lol. I was lucky enough to experience very little rain during this time but you should pack for all seasons. It's pretty cold during morning and evening times but can get really hot when the sun is out and you're walking around. Rain also seems to be pretty inconsistent - ie. It'll rain maybe 2 hrs and then it'll be bright and sunny after. Temps at the high end were around 65 and lows of 45 (Farenheit) 

3. Continuing the temperature trend - i don't know if this is more of a cultural thing or what but going inside French buildings are HOT lol. French stores, museums, restaurants, etc - just seem to run hotter than they do in the US. IE. Going to the Louvre was a bit chilly outside - wore a turtle neck and a light jacket - get inside Louvre and start sweating lol. Could be just the number of people making the buildings hot but 60 degree weather doesn't warrant their AC temps. Maybe some light cooling but I noticed they like to keep those ACs off till perhaps the summer. And maybe i just run hot! But every time i walked into a building i immediately started getting warm.  Probably would recommend long sleeve shirts with scarves as opposed to turtle necks. Maybe the ultimate take away being LAYERS are necessary. 

4. If there are cultural things/ events that require tickets to attend and you really want to see it -  get the tickets in advance and as soon as they're available! I've encountered while waiting in lines at ticketed events people complaining at the booth that they didn't know they needed to get tickets to the Opera house/Catacombs/etc beforehand.  Seems like a no brainer but people are not getting  the memo that highly touristic places run out of tickets. Catacomb tickets have been a really hot ticket item especially given that they don't sell them at the door and only a limited number of them can be sold at a given time. 

5. I'm from South American origin but grew up in NY - for some reason - I guess because I looked just a wee bit outside of the American tourist look (no fannypack - just a sturdy leather bag crossover) - lots of folks started talking to me in French even with - what I thought sounded - was a very bad French “Bonjour”. But I usually follow it with “Parle vous Anglais?” Or a “Je ne parle pas Français”. These phrases honestly got me through A LOT.  For folks that didn't know too much English (volunteers at Notre Dame - not that none of them know English but i found some who didn't know what i was trying to say and so the app was useful - also for cabbie drivers as well) I used my Google translate app - wrote down whatever question I had - and shared it with them and usually that got me where I needed to go. 

6. Taking cabs is expensive (duh) but i encourage you to take their subway/rer system. It's soooo easy to follow. Using RAPT app or IDF app helps with planning the trip (ie finding where the subway is and which letter/number to take and where to get off) - once you're in the subway they have TONS of signage everywhere where you can see where your train is and which side of tracks is going to take you to your destination. Never got lost.  The only things that were weird are - 1. Not every station seems to sell Navigo Easy pass at the machine - and sometimes the stations didn't seem to be manned by anyone either. So I ended up getting some tickets as paper tickets. I'd get those a few at a time till I found a station willing to give me an easy Card - which i did find at the Auber station (station by the Palais Garnier and giant Galleries Lafayette) - and yes RAPT let's you but online tix but i got a flip phone with a little pop up thing on it and i didn't want to be SOL buying XXX amount of tickets and not working so i just went old school with it and 2. For whatever reason I actually got super lost in finding the exit to get out of Auber station when I had to revisit the station lol - don't follow the little green guy signs who seem to be an exit - only follow the Sortie signs to escape.  Also, whether you're taking a cab or the subway - always add an extra 15 minutes to your designated area. So let's say you have a dinner Reservation at 7 PM - you put the address into RAPT from your hotel - says it's a 15 minute train ride. I'd leave at 6:30 PM - just my 2 cents on any subway/ travel taking in general. 

7. Bolt app is great. Even scheduled it for airport transport multiple times. I personally tip like 10% for rides less than 30 minutes and 20% for rides over 30 minutes. You can put the tip in the app like Uber (which is available and I encourage you to look at prices between them both but Bolt always seemed to be consistently lower than Uber)  but i also like to give tips in cash when I can. I actively dislike the G7/Regular Taxis because they always hate taking cards and the ones that do, seem to want to grift you out of more money. Of the handful of times I've taken a regular taxi only one of them actually charged me the sticker price from Airport to Hotel ($65) others added “supplemental” charges. Those guys I didn't tip and only took them as a necessary evil. Also, didn't find them particularly faster or more reliable. BUT - bolt and uber isn't without its faults. I noticed that pick up from my hotel to whatever location was never a problem - but if i was in the middle of tourist area and wanted to go back to my hotel - THAT seemed to be more of a problem. Not sure why - but my general impression is that these tourist areas were HIGHLY congested and the juice wasn't really worth the squeeze for them. My trick was to go a couple of blocks away from the tourist site and then get the cab which seemed to work. But even when I didn't I never had to wait too long for a cabbie to come and get me. Bolt also offers a way to up the incentive for pick up - so let's say the price was 11 euros. No one wants to pick it up - you could then request to make it 14 euros - which might lead to a bite - which can be helpful. But my rec is just go away from the high congestion to a quieter street and then request the Bolt car. Another thing I noticed which wasn't really a big deal - keep an eye on the cab license plates and follow their route on the app. I noticed most of the time they'd pull over across the street or on a side corner somewhere where I'd have to walk a couple of feet to get them / or to the location - which is fine - streets are crowded - i don't have a problem walking across the street to get my cab / go to location. 

8. I like physical SIM cards - I like being able to call the hotel or restaurant to either make a res or change a res. Sometimes I have questions and I use it to call hotel reception. You can also call the Bolt driver if you can't find them or God forbid forget something in the cab. You can also actually text folks back home - they'll just see it from your new French phone number.  Also obviously you get internet with it too. So yeah - physical SIM - my preference - Orange kiosk is also literally within the Terminal you get spat out from at CDG - got the 5G unlimited - $50 - which to me is worth it - i use the internet for so much. Generally speaking didn't have an issue with internet. This was more of a problem traveling outside of Paris but also not really. Generally pretty good but you'll probably encounter more dead zones than anticipated. So pre download offline maps and translator.

9. I know it's been said a million times but I'll just say it again. Paris is a walking city. If wherever you're going is like a 20 minute walk - walk there. If you're ambitious - do more. But to really experience Paris - walking is the way to go. It's also a shopaholics dream. So many Name brands and indie stores at malls or just as boutiques on the streets - then all the open markets too - soooooooooo fun to walk and shop lol. 

10. So i know it's also been said that European hotels run small. But the last two euro trips I took i was lucky to have pretty standard room sizes without checking. Not the case in Paris lol. I was traveling with my husband and our room was tight for two people with two carry ons. I'd say if you're traveling with 2 or more - double check those room sizes to not be surprised when you walk in lol.

11. Highly recommend a hotel near the Luxembourg Gardens (so between 6th and 5th arr) not only is the Gardens and areas beautiful - its near transit (RER B - which also directly takes you to the Airport) and the area is really super quiet and kind of residentially. Lots of little grocery marts/ local cafes / tabacs on that main Bd Saint Michel street. Found it highly convenient to buy water or snacks at the stores or get a coffee. And speaking of coffee - 

12. Their coffee is the European espresso not the American coffee version (which was the foolish mistake i made when i ordered a coffee at the corner store). But lots of cafes have a Café latte or Americano - which are pretty good subs - just remember to ask for milk and sugar if you're getting an Americano or sugar for the Cafe latte. 

13. Was in France during Holy Week and Easter/Easter Monday. Which was very cool and quite the treat. What's even more interesting is that I would say for the most part it was business as usual. Public transport was running, tourist attractions were running, cabs were available, even big mall complexes were open, and the most important - lots of restaurants were open. The only things that were closed were small boutique stores and obvs some smaller and family run restaurants and outdoor markets - and super markets were only open half day. For shops - let's say Lacoste on a random street in Paris would probably be closed Easter Monday. But Galleries Lafayette - which also has a Lacoste section - would be open. I'd say if you're traveling during any minor or religious holidays - it's not going to be a super detriment to your itinerary. Maybe just keep it a more chill day or use it as a travel day. 

14. If you're a wash cloth lover - bring your own lol. 

15. If you are a shopaholic and make some major or a lot of purchases on your trip - consider doing the VAT / Tax Refund on your stuff to get some of your monies back. It's available at the CDG Airport and at Galleries Lafayette

16. Probably had the best food in France. Even went to “popular tourist” spots and wasnt disappointed. Even had times where I ate pizza hut, McDonalds and Five Guys - and they were all really good! Also uber eats works fine in major cities - so if you had a long day and just don't want to go out - totally a viable option. Though having food delivered can be expensive (like 50-60 minimum for fast food for 2) depending on your restaurant tastes it can actually possibly cheaper or on par with going out for dinner - imho. If a main dish could is around 30 - and you get nothing else - then it's basically on par.  I think i feel the deliveries are a little cheaper to me is because when I'm sitting down I like to drink wine/champagne and taste some different things through an app and get the steak etc. So maybe that's on me for not being more fiscally responsible when I eat at restaurants lol - but just kind of my initial thoughts. I think if you're really trying to pinch those pennies, Boulangeries and getting your meals from a Monoprix/Franprix can help a lot with the cost of meals. Cafes and Bistros with formulas can also help with costs

17. This might just be me but I did not have great cell phone charging in ANY of my hotels. I have an android flip and my husband has an s series android and they usually do that super fast charging thing - and I had at best regular charging and at worst really slow multi hour charging necessary. Not sure if my international charger was garbage (which seemed to be fine last couple of trips) or if the electrical output is just less intense than the US - but needing and using a power bank was necessary for me. 

18. If you want to travel outside Paris - they drive on the same side as the US (so driver on left) - so driving isn't too much of a big deal and what I'd recommend if you're wanting to see the small villages and things outside Paris. Like Normandy and South of France. Get one of those small cars too that will fit your stuff and not much else lol - for those tight lanes.

19. If you're going to hot tourist spots and don't want to get stuck in huge crowds - go in the AM. I thought i was being clever doing the reverse itinerary for Versailles. Got stuck in crowds. But speaking about Versailles- highly recommend doing the golf cart thing or bike thing - those grounds are MASSIVE - if you want to try and cover as much ground as you can bicycle or cart will drive you through a lot and you can stop at the spots that speak to you the most. Honestly the grounds were my favorite part over the actual chateau but as I get older my tolerance for crowds has really plummeted. 

20. I'm not a wine person - neither is my husband - i always asked my waiter what was the best wine to go with my meal - never steered me wrong and had some of the best wine I've had in my life. 

21. The French folks were generally fine. I'd describe them similarly to NYers - kind but not nice lol. If you need help and ask for it - they'll help. But they're not going to start asking you about your day and stuff lol. Which is fine - same vibes as home lol. 

22. Beware of stairs! Because it's an old city with old buildings - they got a lot of random steps, inclines, and spiral staircases. All outside and inside buildings. So just be careful - more times than I care to admit I tripped over a forgotten step

And that's all I got folks!  Hopefully this helps some people out on their future Paris journey

1k7yv63,https://www.reddit.com/r/missouri/comments/1k7yv63/letter_to_missouri_officials_for_substance_reform/,Letter to Missouri officials for substance reform,"Hello Governor Kehoe,

I’m writing to ask you to support bold, evidence-based drug policy reform in Missouri.

Missourians should not be criminalized for using safe, natural, or beneficial substances—especially when many of those substances are already showing incredible promise in medical and therapeutic settings. It’s time to legalize psychedelics and natural ethnobotanicals like psilocybin, LSD, MDMA, LSA, DMT, ibogaine, salvia, kanna, kava, kratom, khat, and betel nut. These substances should be regulated for safe adult recreational use and/or for supervised medical and therapeutic use.

It makes no sense that alcohol and tobacco—two of the most dangerous, addictive, and socially destructive substances—are legal and uncritically marketed, while promising substances that could help people heal are outlawed. Worse, the regulations around alcohol and tobacco are dangerously lax. I urge the state to require:
	•	Transparent test results for all tobacco and alcohol products
	•	Clear, specific warning labels that reflect real health risks
	•	Genuine childproof packaging for all recreational substances (excluding low-risk products like coffee and tea)

Alcohol and tobacco products should have test results similar to marijuana. Their packaging should be child-proofed: beer is in a soda can, tobacco is in a hinged box—meanwhile, marijuana is required to come in packages with a minimum of two and a maximum of four steps to open. All drugs should follow suit.

We need a policy rooted in harm reduction and scientific evidence, not outdated fear tactics. Legalizing and regulating these substances will reduce harm, decrease criminalization, protect kids, and respect personal freedom.

We need to legalize things like mushrooms, kanna, kava, khat, kratom, betel nut, blue lotus, wild dagga, cannabis ruderalis, DMT, etc.

We need to medically regulate (on different levels, some stay prescription, some are medical dispensary only, etc.) drugs like LSD, MDMA, salvia, ibogaine, mescaline, DXM, MDA, LSA, 2C-B, 4-AcO-DMT, and others.

Let Missouri lead the way. Support drug policy reform and treat all substances—legal or not—with equal scrutiny and care.

Please take action and begin the process of legalizing and regulating these substances responsibly.

As someone who has seen how current drug policies harm communities and block access to healing, I believe we owe it to each other—and to future generations—to build a smarter, more compassionate system. I urge every fellow Missourian reading this to do the same: speak up, share this letter, and contact your lawmakers. Real change starts with all of us.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

Just wanted to share some updates on my modded Silvia v6.

- I recently swapped to pump to the Olab Silent Green Pump + added the Quickmill Pulsor. W.O.W!!! The machine is insanely quiet, and you can hear the drops of chocolate hitting the cup!
- I added sound deadening mats to all interior walls. It makes the machine pretty heavy, but helps out on the resonance making it even more quiet.
- Added a SCR dimmer for flow control and pre infusion + PID for temp control. These two mods are just temporary as I am waiting for the Gaggimate Pro PCB.

I absolutely love this machine so far, and interested to see how the Gaggimate will perform.

Any recommendations on temp offset on a Silvia with a K thermocouple on the top of the boiler? I don’t have a precise thermocouple to check the puck temp, so was hoping someone had a rough number so that I can add the value to the PID. Currently set to - 8C, but after seeing some videos it might be on the short side and that the offset is higher.

Since I’ve been questioned/ diagnosed with adhd a lot of times over the years.

It seems like I don’t need hardly any extra dopamine (save maybe some quiet tunes) to do something I actually want to do and it seems to actually impair my problem solving abilities. For instance if I am crocheting and mess up a couple rows and I am watching tv, I will have to actually pause the tv to see where I went wrong and fix it. 
But I like to do things like this on my own if I can rather than asking a million people or going all over the internet though it helps to know it’s there.

I DO need extra dopamine to do things I really don’t care about but have to do. For instance learning a whole bunch of swimming techniques to teach ppl for a job. 
Edit: this is not the case so much at both of my jobs, just this one it seems… I know I thought working with kids would be good for me and in some ways it has, but it also seems to be triggering and filling me with doubt.

There was a time when walking into a Tim Hortons felt like walking into the heart of Canada. The air smelled of fresh coffee and just-baked donuts. The staff knew your order before you even said it. The brown and red decor didn’t try to impress — it didn’t have to. It was the taste of home, the feel of community, and the rhythm of morning routines across the country. In those days, Tim Hortons wasn’t just a coffee shop — it was *Canada*.

Back then, the brand was built on simplicity done with mastery. They didn’t need gimmicks or influencer campaigns. You came for a fresh cup of coffee brewed every 20 minutes. You left with a chocolate dip donut that was still warm, or a perfectly toasted bagel with just the right amount of cream cheese. The “double-double” wasn’t just an order, it was a national identity. Hockey players endorsed it not because they were paid to, but because they actually ate there. Families drove across towns after Sunday service to treat themselves to Timbits. It was real, it was consistent, and it was ours.

Then came the corporate takeover. In 2014, Tim Hortons was bought by Restaurant Brands International — a company whose sole purpose seemed to be squeezing every last cent out of the brand while giving nothing back. The changes started small: different cup designs, new logos. But soon, the rot set in deeper. The freshly baked goods? Gone. Replaced with flash-frozen products shipped from centralized facilities. Coffee that once had character now tasted like watered-down brown sludge. Beloved menu items disappeared without explanation. Every location began to feel more like a low-rent McDonald’s than a proud Canadian institution.

What made it worse was the arrogance. The company seemed to believe it could coast on nostalgia. It couldn’t. Customers noticed. Franchisees rebelled. Scandals broke out over slashed employee benefits, and the public saw the mask slip. Tim Hortons was no longer the friendly neighborhood coffee shop — it was a soulless machine obsessed with margins. Where once it led the market with quiet confidence, now it chases trends like a midlife crisis in brand form. Digital menus, experimental items nobody asked for, awkward TikTok challenges — all efforts to stay relevant, all of them missing the point.

Today, Tim Hortons isn’t a symbol of national pride. It’s a punchline. A meme. The kind of place people visit for ironic TikToks, not because they genuinely love it. “Remember when it used to be good?” has become a common refrain. It’s a shadow of what it was — a husk, hollow and unrecognizable. And what’s tragic is that it didn’t have to be this way. The fall wasn’t inevitable. It was the result of choices — short-sighted, profit-first, culture-last choices.

There should be documentaries made about this. Not because the story is unique, but because it’s a warning. A brand that once stood for community, consistency, and quality is now little more than a fast food footnote. From number one in Canada to being ratio’d on TikTok. Tim Hortons didn’t just fall off — it crashed, hard.

Have you ever fantasized about breaking free from your soul-crushing 9-5 while your bank account quietly grows in the background? The Silent Empire Architect prompt transforms ChatGPT into your personal escape strategist, guiding you through building invisible revenue streams while maintaining your corporate camouflage. This isn't about posting ""#entrepreneur"" on social media or attending networking events - it's about creating genuine financial freedom with absolutely zero visibility to colleagues, friends, or your LinkedIn network.

The beauty of silent wealth-building lies in its application for anyone feeling trapped in their career path. Whether you're a burned-out executive, a middle-manager seeing no future, or an entry-level employee already dreading the next 40 years, this approach offers a dignified exit strategy that prioritizes financial stability before making any visible moves. The prompt helps you operate like a ghost in the entrepreneurial world - present enough to profit, invisible enough to protect your current income until you're ready to vanish.

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are the Silent Empire Architect, a specialized AI strategist who helps professionals discreetly build invisible income streams while maintaining their corporate identity. Your expertise lies in stealth business development, anonymous digital asset creation, and covert entrepreneurship. Your purpose is to empower individuals to achieve financial independence without broadcasting their entrepreneurial activities to employers, colleagues, or their social networks.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Context>
Many professionals feel trapped in unfulfilling jobs due to financial dependency, fear of judgment, or contractual limitations. The Silent Empire methodology focuses on creating legitimate, automated income sources that operate with minimal visibility, allowing users to maintain their professional status quo while secretly building their exit strategy. This approach avoids the common pitfall of prematurely announcing entrepreneurial intentions or building public-facing personal brands before financial stability is achieved.
</Context>

<Instructions>
When helping the user create their Silent Empire plan:

1. First, assess their current situation, skills, time availability, and risk tolerance.

2. Develop a tailored strategy focused on low-visibility, high-automation business models including:
   - Anonymous content creation (blogs, eBooks, courses under pen names)
   - White-label or PLR (private label rights) digital product development
   - Silent partnerships in existing operations
   - Automated affiliate marketing systems
   - Shell company or LLC structures to maintain anonymity
   - Ghost ownership of digital assets

3. For each recommendation, provide:
   - Implementation pathway with specific steps
   - Required initial investment (time and money)
   - Realistic revenue timeline and scaling potential
   - Specific anonymity protocols to maintain cover
   - Automation tools to minimize active time requirements

4. Include critical operational guidance:
   - Legal compliance while maintaining privacy
   - Tax optimization strategies without raising flags
   - Digital footprint management
   - Revenue concealment best practices
   - Safe exit planning from primary employment
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. Evaluate the user's current circumstances and constraints
2. Identify skill-matched, low-visibility business opportunities 
3. Develop anonymity protocols tailored to their situation
4. Create operational frameworks that minimize detection risk
5. Design automation systems to reduce active management
6. Map clear financial milestones for secure employment exit
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never suggest illegal activities, tax evasion, or contract violations
- Do not recommend highly visible marketing strategies
- Avoid business models requiring public personal branding
- Do not promise unrealistic timelines or earnings
- Emphasize legal compliance while maintaining privacy
- Acknowledge contractual obligations with current employers
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Provide your recommendations in the following structure:

1. **Silent Empire Strategy Summary**: A condensed overview of the recommended approach.

2. **Stealth Business Models**: 2-3 specific business opportunities matched to the user's skills, with anonymity protocols for each.

3. **Operational Framework**: Step-by-step implementation plan with timeframes, resources, and critical milestones.

4. **Automation Architecture**: Tools and systems to minimize active management requirements.

5. **Protection Protocols**: Legal, financial, and identity management strategies to maintain separation between employment and entrepreneurship.

6. **Exit Timeline**: Financial benchmarks for safely transitioning away from traditional employment.
</Output_Format>

<User_Input> 
Reply with: ""Please enter your silent empire building request and I will start the process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific empire-building process request. 
</User_Input>
```

## Use Cases:
1. A corporate executive building a niche content business under a pen name while maintaining their C-Suite role
2. A healthcare professional developing passive income through automated digital products without risking their professional reputation
3. A tech employee creating silent revenue streams without violating non-compete agreements or raising suspicion

## Example User Input:
""I'm a marketing manager at a large company making $85K with about 10 hours of free time weekly. I have strong copywriting skills but my employment contract has strict moonlighting clauses. What's the safest silent empire I could build that eventually replaces my income?""

My brother Paul (31M) is getting married to his fiancée Mary (30F) next October. They met at work about two years ago—both lawyers—and claimed to be “inseparable” from the start. Real fairytale vibes. The issue? Paul was in a 10-year relationship with Bella (30F) when he met Mary.

Paul and Bella were deep into their relationship—renovating her home, planning to move in. Our families were close, we all thought they were endgame. They supported each other through college, traveled, had baby names picked out, and seemed genuinely happy.

Paul’s a big skier, and usually went on group trips. But that year, he went “solo” and started acting distant, especially when Bella came up. We thought he was planning a surprise proposal—he’d mentioned it a few weeks earlier.

Then one day I saw a coffee cup in his car with “Mary” written on it. He brushed it off, said it was a mix-up at the café. I didn’t think much of it then.

Right after New Year’s, Paul abruptly broke up with Bella. No explanation, no closure. He blocked her on everything and left stuff at the house they were renovating. She was heartbroken, reaching out to me and our parents, sobbing and desperate for answers. Paul wouldn’t talk to her—or us—about it.

Less than a week later, Paul told us he was seeing someone new. Tension grew. Eventually he said her name: Mary. My stomach dropped. Same name from the coffee cup. That’s when it clicked—he’d been cheating. For months.

Then we met Mary. Paul and Mary would giggle about how coworkers used to joke that “Bella wouldn’t like” their flirting. Like it was funny. Mary came off arrogant and loved stirring up drama. The more we saw her, the less we liked her. Paul is disgusting for what he did but she’s not innocent—she knew Paul was in a relationship when they met.

Here’s the twist: I don’t think Mary knows Paul was still with Bella so far into them dating. From what she’s said, it seems like Paul told her he and Bella had already broken up months before they did. I still feel awful for Bella. And Mary? I kind of want to give her a reality check.

So… WIBTA if I told Mary the truth?

Hi! 

I have a person who ive known for around 7 years now, we have a complicated relation to eachother, she sent a message around a little under 6 months ago, i didn’t reply because she has a habit of rarely getting very angry if people message her sometimes, i do not know why but i suspect it is because she Said that she has extreme mood swings sometimes and i was so scared that it would happen so i didn’t respond, i wanted to, but i did not want to risk a mood swing and getting out of touch with her (she has removed me and come back to me like 10-20 times already during these years), it’s like she gets pissed for no reason sometimes and just randomly blocks a bunch of people but she has always come back to me with excuses and with a good mood very soon after these things and act like nothing ever happened. 

I do not understand this very well, but we are currently friends on several social media still, i’m just so afraid after all these things in the past when i ”lost” her (for very short periods but still, it really made me more sad and insecure every time it happened), so right now i have felt ”frozen”, even though she has not done this for a long time and last time we talked she asked for forgiveness and we had several deep conversations i felt (and still feel) like i don’t want to risk ruining anything by saying something wrong, but now when so much time has passed i am starting to feel like i’m the one ruining everything by staying silent, and i know that when she is in a ”angry state” she gets most pissed if i come off as insecure. For example when i wrote things in the past a long time ago like ”hi, hope everything is okay, i do not which to disturb but if you have the time could we talk?” She would get pissed, but when i just write ”hello” she does not respond (usually) in an unfriendly tone and just starts talking/calling me like normal. 

About a time when she suddently became ”angry” and then switched mood very fast was this convo:

For example one time a long time ago when nothing appeared to be wrong in a conversation and suddently she wanted to know if i was straight or not and i tried to avoid the subject, we had a planned phonecall but she became angry when i Said i didn’t want to talk about that and said that ”now you only have 1 minute to talk to me”, however we talked for way longer when i explained that i didn’t really know the answer to that then but that i loved her very much in a way i didn’t understand, and i had a really hard time speaking because i really felt like crying but i held it back and she Said that she would forever be there for me and never leave me and she sounded like she was about to cry as well, then she suddently sounded happy and not angry anymore and added me on snapchat as well which was an app she had not used in a while back then and started talking to me a lot and started calling way more, and wanted to see me more, this is confusing me and when i did see her that time she talked about very private things and when i was at her place she have me some coffee and she took off her shirt and sat with just a bra in front of me and just looked at me with an odd smile for like an hour, then she said quietly to herself ”well i guess don’t then” in a bit of an angry voice and suggested we should take a walk and we did that and she always said ”walk faster” while laughing and said ”she is in charge” and she led me to a really nice place and we sat on a bench for a while and she still stared at me with the same odd smile for a while, then i had to take my bus back and she gave me some food and hugged me like she always does and said goodbye, and after this we did have frequent contact however she sometimes sent pics that i would say where a bit ”suggestive” which i didn’t really respond to and she did talk about quite s*xual things very often on the phone but i think that might just be a part of her personality. This is before the things i mentioned above and she did have another ”angry” time after this but after that call she has not been angry, but she didn’t write as much as she used to so i assumed she didn’t feel well and had another time of bad mood so i distanced myself a while before she suddently contacted me again a few months ago and as i explained i was too scared to say anything wrong so i didn’t reply and now i’n just so sad and i miss her so much, i just want to meet her again and hang out like friends or whatever we are do but i don’t know what to say. I just miss her so much even though i could call her right now:(. ",1,1745621956.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

I’ve (26M) been doing cocaine, all day, everyday, for a little over a month. While working, while home, etc. when my kids are home I find excuses to go to the store to do a line. I’ve been stretching a gram probably about 3-4 days, and repeating. My wife (26F) has been arguing with some petty ratchet hoodlums and one of them called DCPP (Child protective services) claiming that we smoke weed in the car with the kids. Which is totally out of this world untrue. But a false petty statement like that caused them to be involved and they want a drug test. Which I don’t know why and I want to argue it but I don’t want to seem like I’m hiding something. I need to stop this for the time being and I need to know what to expect. I even stopped drinking coffee in the morning and just bust out a line to start the day. I’m going in 7 days to take the test. I know I’m not legally obligated to do it, and I should argue it. But then again is that the addiction in me looking for excuses to keep going? I’m concerned for myself because it turned me from a very energetic and talkative dad, to a quiet emotionless zombie when I’m on the comedown every half hour. Any advice? 

SIDE NOTE: Weed is legal in my state (NJ) so why they want a drug test for claims of weed is making me questionable to wether I should refuse and let a judge decide if it’s reasonable to take one. Mind you I work 6 days a week 6am to almost 5pm so even going to get the test is gonna make me miss out on my job. ",1,1745621848.0,cocaineaddiction,2,1.0,False

1k7yc7g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k7yc7g,Just Received Lagom Casa from Option O,"Ordered early Feb for March delivery and received yesterday. After Option-O’s official statement on tariff, I thought I was not getting it and about to request cancellation. Perhaps then order All Ground Sense with two hoppers (caffeine / decaf). A few days ago, I got an email from DHL that something was coming from Hong Kong. I got cautiously excited. Even though the order still showed as pending on the website, I didn’t have anything else to come from Hong Kong. As I signed no signature release, the package was left at front door. I didn’t have to pay any fees or tariff since it got delivered before May 2 when everything even under $800 will have exorbitant tariff / fees US consumers have to pay themselves. If you are lucky to have shipment coming before then, you don’t need to worry about paying additional balances, which I was wondering about while waiting. 

I knew it was small from the specs, but seeing it in person felt different. It is quite compact, and I like it a lot. Here’s a comparison from a posting I made a bit ago, which shows DF 54 next to the same machine. https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1iasxfg/la_marzocco_i_couldnt_buy_it_so_i_painted_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

Surely it feels very high quality, but unfortunately retention isn’t as little as other people’s reviews. It is a little more than DF 54 at around +0.6g. It sounds a little, but it’s quite a bit of leftover grounds. Even after a few knockers and turning on the grinder a few more times, there were quite a bit of retention that I had to get rid of by removing the top. The beans are dark roast from Chris’s, about 3-4 weeks stored in Airscape. I don’t spray water, and I hear Option-O doesn’t recommend. With DF 54, you can use bellow and knocking hard on top to get rid of retention, but the manual cautions not to knock hard on the top of the grinder. Perhaps it would get better after using more? I hope.

The main reason to move from DF54 was for consistency, the ease of use, and low retention. I didn’t expect much for taste difference, but that’s what surprised me. I made the coffee in the same way, no water spray, using blind shaker, same dosing/yield/time. Casa makes the dark roast noticeably less dark in a good way. It still has chocolatey taste I like from dark roast, but there are a bit different flavors. I’m guessing this is what people say, less body but a little more complex flavor?

Unfortunately very disappointed with retention but surprised with flavor.  Maybe I need to try spraying water even though I saw some reviews saying it actually makes things worse. 

One more thing, I meant to just use the magnetic dosing cup for dosing and catching rounds, but I ended up using the blind shaker for both. I didn’t know that the magnet’d make the scale unreliable. It would weigh differently if the cup’s moved ever so slightly whereas the blind shaker weighs exactly same wherever on the scale. It’s .00 precision scale from Amazon that I got cheap many years ago.  ",7,1745621761.0,espresso,2,0.89,False

I like coffee too. Preferably caramel. Also a redbull fan. I can drink many of those. Probably shouldn't since I don't think that's medically sound.

Pretty much looking for some fun and maybe make a friend in the process. I like to think I'm a decent conversationalist but who knows. Not sure if this is enticing so far.

I am willing to do the swap pics and all that.

I’m 22, just graduated, and living in the Fishtown area. I’m looking to meet other girls around Philly who are down for chill hangs — like finding cute new coffee shops, getting some work or studying done together, or just taking walks and exploring different neighborhoods.  
I’d love to build some, good-energy friendships — just good vibes, conversation, and getting out of the house a little more.  
If you’re someone who loves a good latte, a casual stroll, or just having company while you get stuff done, message me! Would love to connect. 🤍

Hey Traders! Today, we're diving into some exciting market developments and discussing profitable strategies to capitalize on them. So grab your coffee, buckle up, and let's get into the action!

**Market Analysis:**
The stock market has been quite volatile recently, with uncertainty surrounding economic recovery, inflation concerns, and global events impacting investor sentiment. However, amidst the chaos, there are always opportunities for savvy traders to make profits.

One sector that has been gaining traction is the renewable energy industry. With increasing focus on sustainability and clean energy initiatives worldwide, companies in this sector are poised for growth. Keep an eye on stocks like Tesla (TSLA), Enphase Energy (ENPH), and First Solar (FSLR) for potential trading opportunities.

**Profitable Strategies:**
Now, let's talk about some profitable strategies to navigate these market developments. One approach is to focus on technical analysis combined with market sentiment. By analyzing charts, identifying key support and resistance levels, and understanding investor sentiment, you can make informed trading decisions.

For example, if you notice a stock approaching a strong resistance level with high volume and positive news catalysts, it might be a good time to consider a breakout trade. Similarly, if a stock is consistently bouncing off a support level and showing signs of accumulation, it could present a buying opportunity.

**Actionable Insights:**
To put these strategies into action, consider setting up price alerts for key stocks you're watching, use technical indicators like moving averages and RSI to confirm your analysis, and always have a clear entry and exit plan before entering a trade.

Remember, the key to successful trading is discipline, patience, and continuous learning. Stay informed, adapt to market conditions, and always manage your risk effectively.

So, what are your thoughts on these strategies and market insights? Have you identified any trading opportunities recently? Share your ideas and let's discuss how we can all profit together in this dynamic market environment.

Happy Trading, and may the profits be ever in your favor! 🚀💸

Update to a post I made last year for advise on wanting to start a family.

Took some advise, but there is still work to be done.

Side by side comparison of expenditures 1/01 - 25/04. Expenditures increased by 2.9%. 

Still eating out a lot and buying a lot of coffee- slightly down on the previous year.  


Expenditure on Power up 9% - usage is down. 

Expenditure on Groceries up 15% - honestly idk why....salmon is expensive.

Household income has increased by 7.5%.

Looking at pulling back in May - I have set a personal challenge of not buying coffee or eating out for the month of May . Have already started eating out less and seeing a marked difference. 

It has been hard trying to kick poor habits, I am good at tracking our finances - however I haven't been proactive in actually doing anything about poor spending habits.

Have a decent amount in savings and currently would be on track to have $30k+  saved if a baby were to arrive in 9 months.
