Part 1,"I already know what ya'll are thinking....not another damn perspective of the guy role-playing as a cat online.  Just hear me out okay.  It's much worse than you thought. These people are nuts!!

It all started one day about three years ago.  I had just moved into this home that had a guy, a lady, their daughter, and a cat. I'm not the biggest fan of cats but I can deal with them.  Sometimes it's the people that you really have to worry about.  Anyways, the humans seemed okay at first. They dropped a lot of food on the floor so I'm thinking this is going to be great for me.  Well I would soon learn how wrong I was.

The first few weeks went by just fine.  I pretty much went unnoticed in the house. Only the cat knew I was there but he didn't even care.  We actually became buddies and would sometimes sunbathe together in the light coming from the window.  I think the cat was just glad to have a companion to hang out with when the humans weren't home. One day the daughter did see me as i was scavenging for lunch. She didn't get scared or freaked out or anything like that. She said hi and told me that I was a very cute mouse. After that she started leaving me leftovers from dinner on a little plate underneath the coffee bar.  A couple times a week I would get milk and cookies too. I really liked her.

Now here is where all the trouble started.  One day I came out for food and noticed that the house was very quiet.  I was about to check all my usual places when I saw the guy on his hands and knees in front of the cat bowl.  And he was eating the food!!  At first I was like ""What the hell?"" It was so strange to me to see a human eating cat food.  The lady was a great cook and there was always human food around so that made it even more confusing.  Anyways, I looked over at the cat and he was just watching the guy.  He looked just as confused as I was. The cat eventually looked over at me and he said ""I hope he is going to save some of that for me.""

The guy started eating the cat food multiple times a week but only when no one else was home.  It was still a strange thing to see but after a while I just shrugged my shoulders and thought to myself ""whatever floats your boat.""  Now one day the humans had made one of those charcuterie board things but it had accidentally gotten knocked over.  The food went everywhere!!  There was cheese all over the floor....like so many different cheeses!! It was wonderful!!  

I went back out into the kitchen for my second round of cheese when the guy caught me.  I thought for sure he was going to kick me out but I was wrong.  Instead he loudly proclaimed ""Jerry"" and started chasing me around the kitchen. I thought to myself, ""Who the hell is Jerry? My name is Gloria!!""  He started doing this every time he caught me looking for food.  Sometimes he would meow or hiss at me. He even started to refer to himself as Tom. (His name is NOT Tom.)  

This nutcase even went out and bought himself a small toy plastic hammer to chase me with.  He never actually hit me with it but there were some close calls.  After the fifth time of this cat and mouse game I was done.  I started leaving little poop droplets on his pillow while he slept.  After a whole week of waking up with turds stuck to his hair and face ""Tom"" finally stopped chasing me around the kitchen.  We had come to an understanding.  

Stay tuned for Part 2

 I've been documenting since the beginning of the school year that child's OP hasn't been administering inhaler. I always make sure to remind and ask that they give it and it's almost always not being used. I have photo proof of the chamber count not moving and child comes back with cough and nose issues. OP forgot about taking child to pulmonary appointment back in Nov and then we had to wait until Jan for the next opening. I had reminded them of upcoming appt and even had it posted on our co-parenting app. They did attend the one for Jan and OP admitted to doctor that he occasionally forgets to administer inhaler once or twice while child is in their care. Doctor told OP to ensure child gets inhaler so that we can verify its effectiveness.

Just a few weeks ago, child came back to me with a swollen and bruised dog bite. Child told me what happened and not OP. I took child to UC, was diagnosed with a hematoma but bite didn't break the skin. OP didn't take child to get bite checked and thought child was okay because they had stopped crying.

When child was recently returned to my care, inhaler was not administered at all again, even though I mentioned the bad air quality alert we got for our area. OP claimed they had been using a spare they had for the entire month. When I asked for the chamber count, the inhaler had somehow been ruined by the stove/oven when he opened the door. So there was no way to verify his claim. I noted down that I always send the inhaler that is in child's bag (that he's aware of) and he said child had only gone without inhaler on Sunday. The inhaler, in bag could've clearly been used for Sunday and Monday dosages.

  
Other noted issues (not sure if it matters):

 \-OP mentioned child had bloody, waxy ears (ear tubes are in both ears due to chronic ear infections). I asked if they were going to get child checked out at UC, they said no. I called ENT, they prescribed ear drops and reached out to OP to pick up prescription. Child was confirmed for ear infection by PED after returning to me for appt. Ear infection last around 2-3weeks with continuation of ear drops and then oral antibiotics.

\-While in OP's care, child slipped on water and fell on edge of coffee table, causing eyebrow to spilt open. Child taken to ER and had stitches placed.

My coffee is always as good as I expect a Starbucks Americano to be. Recently my Starbucks seems to have had an influx of new hires, and yesterday my Americano tasted awful. Like, burnt, and just kinda off. So I was like whatever, I need caffeine, so I drank it, and proceeded to get extra zooted from it for whatever reason. 

So today I went back to get my same drink - I literally had forgotten how gross my drink was yesterday and so when I took my first sip I was yet again surprised to taste how gross it was. Pretty frustrating. So, naturally, I drank it, cuz I need my caffeine, and proceeded to get extra zooted, yet again.

And then it got me thinking- are they making my Americano by just repulling my shots? Like, I have a nespresso at home and I’ll do this for my own shots, knowing it’ll water down a little but still get me some more espresso.

So like is that a thing? Instead of topping my espresso shots off with water, is some new person there just running my shots until my cup is full? Cuz I’m definitely getting the feeling that there was more caffeine in there than usual, and that maybe could explain how gross it tasted.

Part One: The Laundromat
A First-Hand Account by Evan Wren
 
⸻
 
I never really believed in ghosts, demons, or any of that paranormal crap. I figured most weird encounters could be chalked up to sleep deprivation, paranoia, or someone just being a plain old liar. But after what happened that Saturday, I don’t know what to believe anymore.
 
The day started off normal enough. It was my first real weekend off in weeks, and I was making the most of it—by doing absolutely nothing. I had my feet propped up on my crappy coffee table, watching reruns of some cooking show I didn’t even care about. My phone buzzed a couple of times, work emails that I ignored.
 
I work IT for a local grocery chain. Nothing glamorous—mostly just driving around from store to store fixing busted checkout machines, resetting servers, and dealing with managers who think turning something off and on is wizardry. It pays the bills, keeps me moving. But on Saturdays, I am off the clock.
 
Except, of course, for the mountain of dirty laundry staring at me from across the room.
 
I sighed, knowing I was out of socks and down to my last halfway-clean shirt. No way around it—I had to do laundry. My apartment, 305B, was on the far side of the complex, which meant I had to walk through the field that separated my building from the main office where the laundromat was. I grabbed my basket, stuffed it full of clothes, and headed out.
 
The sun was starting to dip, washing the sky in shades of orange and purple. I liked this time of day, when everything felt a little quieter. As I stepped into the field, the dry grass brushing against my legs, I got this… odd feeling. Not quite fear, but like someone had just stepped into the room behind me when I hadn’t heard the door open.
 
Then I heard the whispers.
 
At first, I thought it was the wind. The way it moved through the trees lining the far edge of the field, it could’ve easily been some trick of the air. But as I walked, the whispers grew clearer. Low, hushed voices, speaking too fast for me to understand. Not just one voice—several, overlapping, like a conversation happening just out of earshot.
 
I stopped walking.
 
The voices stopped too.
 
I glanced over my shoulder. Nothing but the empty field and the dim glow of the apartments behind me.
 
I exhaled, shaking my head. It’s nothing. Just my brain playing tricks on me, right?
 
I picked up the pace and pushed through the laundromat door, letting the familiar scent of detergent and stale air replace whatever weirdness I just imagined outside.
 
I grumbled to myself when I saw the prices had gone up again. $3.25 a wash? Seriously? I fished a couple of crumpled bills out of my pocket, stuffing them into the change machine.
 
That’s when I noticed I wasn’t alone.
 
At first, I thought it was just another tenant—a man, maybe, sitting on the plastic bench near the dryers. But something was… off. The way they sat, perfectly still. Their posture was too rigid, their hands folded neatly in their lap. Their face was turned just slightly away, obscured by the dim lighting.
 
And then they spoke.
 
“Evan Wren.”
 
I froze. I hadn’t told them my name.
 
I turned toward them, trying to get a better look, but the flickering fluorescent lights above made it hard to focus.
 
“You always forget to separate your whites and darks,” the person said. Their voice was calm, casual—like we’d been having a conversation this whole time. “You’ll regret that in about thirty minutes.”
 
I stared. “Do I… know you?”
 
A pause. The air in the room felt heavier.
 
“I know you.”
 
Something about the way they said it sent a chill crawling up my spine. I wanted to laugh it off, call them a weirdo and go about my business. But my mouth was dry. I gripped my laundry basket tighter.
 
“How do you know my name?” I asked, forcing my voice to stay even.
 
They shifted slightly, but I still couldn’t make out their features.
 
“You drive a van,” they continued. “Fix things. You were watching TV just now, thinking about getting something to eat. You heard whispers outside, but you told yourself it was nothing.”
 
That last part hit me like a punch to the gut.
 
I felt my stomach turn. “What the hell—”
 
“I’d be careful if I were you, Evan.”
 
The voice was lower now, almost amused.
 
I didn’t answer. I just grabbed my change from the machine, shoved my clothes into the nearest washer, and slammed the lid down. My hands were shaking, and I didn’t even realize I’d mixed my whites and colors until the machine started.
 
I glanced back at the bench.
 
It was empty.
 
No one there. No sound of the door opening. Nothing.
 
I stood there for a solid minute, trying to make sense of what just happened. Maybe I was tired. Maybe I’d imagined the whole thing.
 
But when I stepped back outside, the field felt darker than before.
 
I didn’t bother waiting for my laundry to finish. I just walked straight back to my apartment, locked the door, and grabbed my keys.
 
I needed food. And maybe a drink.
 
Dollar General was still open.
 
Maybe some fresh air would help clear my head.
 
Part Two: The Empty Roads
 
A First-Hand Account by Evan Wren
 
⸻
 
I don’t remember locking my apartment door. I assume I did—I mean, I always do—but my mind was running in circles, trying to rationalize what had just happened at the laundromat.
 
A prank? Maybe some neighbor screwing with me? But how would they know what I was watching on TV? Or that I heard the whispers?
 
I shook the thought off and climbed into my van.
 
I hadn’t planned on heading out this late, but the idea of just sitting in my apartment didn’t sit right with me. I needed to get out, be around people, maybe pick up something cheap and greasy to eat. Dollar General wasn’t far—maybe a ten-minute drive—but as soon as I pulled onto the main road, something felt… wrong.
 
The streets were empty.
 
Not just quiet, but dead.
 
No cars parked along the curb. No porch lights on in the houses I passed. No distant sound of dogs barking or bugs humming. It was like the whole town had just decided to pack up and leave while I was in my apartment.
 
I checked the clock. 8:42 PM. Too early for everything to be this empty.
 
My hands tightened around the wheel. I kept my eyes on the road, watching for anysign of life. A car in the distance. A jogger. Even just someone stepping outside for a smoke.
 
Nothing.
 
By the time I pulled into the Dollar General parking lot, I was gripping the steering wheel like I was expecting it to steer itself into a ditch. The parking lot was mostly empty except for a single, beat-up sedan parked near the entrance. A couple of flickering lights buzzed overhead, casting sickly yellow halos on the cracked pavement.
 
I hesitated before stepping out. Checked my mirrors. Looked behind me.
 
No one.
 
I let out a breath, shook off the nerves, and headed inside.
 
The Girl at the Counter
 
The store was the same as always—dimly lit, slightly too cold, and smelling faintly of cleaning chemicals. One of those old, staticky radios played some pop song I half-recognized near the register.
 
Behind the counter stood a girl, maybe early twenties, scrolling through her phone. She had short, dyed red hair, a nose ring, and the kind of bored expression that told me she’d rather be anywhere else.
 
She glanced up when I walked in. “Hey.”
 
I nodded back. Normal. Everything is normal.
 
I moved through the aisles, grabbing a pack of instant ramen, a bag of chips, and an energy drink. I kept looking up, eyes drifting toward the security cameras mounted in the corners of the store.
 
Every time I moved, the monitors flickered, showing distorted images for just a second too long.
 
I frowned and walked closer to the front, trying to get a better look at the monitors above the counter. The screens cycled through different views—the empty aisles, the parking lot, the back storage room.
 
And then I saw it.
 
One of the screens showed me.
 
Not live footage. Not a reflection of where I was standing. It was me, standing in the laundromat, staring at the empty bench where the stranger had been sitting.
 
I blinked. The screen flickered. It was gone.
 
I turned to the girl behind the counter.
 
“Hey, uh… do these cameras glitch a lot?”
 
She didn’t look up from scanning my items. “Huh? Oh yeah, all the time. They’re old as hell.”
 
I nodded slowly. Swallowed. “Right. Thought I saw something weird on them.”
 
She finally looked at me, raising an eyebrow. “Yeah? Like what?”
 
I hesitated. Shook my head. “Nothing.”
 
She shrugged, scanning the energy drink. “You okay, dude? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”
 
I forced out a laugh. “Just a long day.”
 
She gave me a half-smirk. “You IT guys never sleep, huh?”
 
I fumbled for my wallet, but before I could pull it out, she waved a hand. “Don’t worry about it.”
 
I blinked. “Huh?”
 
She tapped the register. “I got it. You look like you need it.”
 
I stared at her for a second. A stranger, just casually paying for my drink because I looked off.
 
I exhaled, rubbing a hand over my face. “Thanks. Uh, seriously. I appreciate it.”
 
“No problem,” she said, already looking back at her phone. “Try to get some sleep or something, yeah?”
 
I nodded and grabbed my bag, heading for the door.
 
The Stranger
 
The moment I stepped outside, I knew I wasn’t alone.
 
He was standing there, right beside my van.
 
The same figure from the laundromat—same rigid posture, hands folded neatly in front of him. Only this time, the streetlights actually let me see him.
 
I wished they hadn’t.
 
His face was… wrong. Like it was stretched too tight over his skull, too smooth, like someone had blurred out the details. His eyes were sunken, hollow pits of something that shimmered slightly, like oil on water.
 
I stopped mid-step, grip tightening around the plastic bag.
 
“You should listen carefully, Evan,” he said. His voice was the same as before—calm, measured, like we were just two old friends catching up.
 
I swallowed. “What do you want?”
 
He tilted his head slightly. “Not what I want. What you need to do.”
 
My breath came out unsteady. “What the hell are you talking about?”
 
He took a slow step forward. I didn’t move.
 
“The next forty-eight hours are going to determine whether or not you survive,” he said. “You need to prepare.”
 
A chill ran down my spine.
 
“Prepare for what?”
 
His head tilted the other way, like he was considering his words carefully.
 
“They know you now,” he said simply. “You heard them in the field. They know you’re aware.”
 
My stomach turned to ice.
 
“I—I don’t even know what I heard,” I said, my voice unsteady. “I don’t know what you’re talking about—”
 
“You do,” he interrupted. “And whether or not you want to believe it, you’re involved now.”
 
I shook my head. “Involved in what?”
 
The air between us felt too still. Like the world itself was holding its breath.
 
“You need to leave town,” he said. “Tonight.”
 
I let out a nervous laugh. “Yeah, okay. Sure. Let me just quit my job and hit the road, no big deal.”
 
He didn’t smile. Didn’t blink.
 
“This isn’t a joke.”
 
Something about the way he said it made my skin crawl.
 
I glanced over my shoulder, half-expecting the cashier to be watching through the window. But inside, the store looked normal. The girl was still at the counter, scrolling through her phone, oblivious.
 
I turned back to the stranger.
 
“What happens if I don’t leave?” I asked.
 
His hollow eyes locked onto mine.
 
“Then you’ll find out what they do to people who listen to the whispers.”
 
The bag in my hand felt heavier. My heart pounded in my chest.
 
I opened my mouth to speak—
 
But he was gone.
 
Vanished.
 
Like he was never there.
 
I stood there, frozen, staring at the empty space beside my van.
 
The world around me was too quiet.
 
I didn’t want to go home.
 
But I didn’t know where else to go.
 
Part Three: The Hunt Begins
 
A First-Hand Account by Evan Wren
 
⸻
 
By the time I pulled back into my apartment complex, the streets weren’t empty anymore.
 
People were out now—neighbors on their balconies, sitting on porches, walking their dogs. At first, I felt relieved. Maybe I’d just imagined it earlier. Maybe I was just freaking myself out.
 
But then I noticed something.
 
They weren’t just outside.
 
They were watching me.
 
A man sitting on a bench near the leasing office turned his head as my van rolled by, eyes locked on mine. A woman across the lot, mid-conversation on her phone, stopped talking and stared. On the second-floor walkway, an old man leaning against the railing turned his head just a little too slowly, tracking my movements.
 
No one smiled. No one waved.
 
Just watching.
 
I parked quickly and kept my head down, gripping my plastic bag like it was some kind of shield. Maybe I was just being paranoid. Maybe I was so worked up that I was seeing things that weren’t there.
 
I didn’t even fully shut my door before I was inside my apartment, locking it behind me.
 
I let out a breath and tried to shake the feeling off. Just make your food. Switch the laundry. Act normal.
 
The ramen took three minutes in the microwave. I ate standing up, barely tasting it. The whole time, I kept glancing at my dark TV screen, half-expecting it to turn on by itself again. It didn’t. Not yet.
 
When I went back to the laundromat to switch my clothes to the dryer, I kept my head down, refusing to look too hard at anyone. No one said anything to me, but I felt their eyes. The air was thick with it.
 
I loaded my clothes, shoved some quarters into the machine, and power-walked back to my apartment. Thirty minutes. That’s all I need. Then I can grab my clothes and figure out what the hell I’m doing next.
 
I was halfway across the field when I heard them.
 
Footsteps.
 
Behind me.
 
Not the casual, lazy steps of someone heading home. These were fast. Heavy. Getting closer.
 
I didn’t turn around. I didn’t need to. Every instinct in my body screamed RUN.
 
I bolted.
 
The laundry bag smacked against my side as I sprinted, my breath coming out in ragged gasps. The dry grass snagged at my legs. I could hear them behind me, their steps pounding the earth, closing the distance too fast.
 
My apartment was in sight. I just had to—
 
Something grabbed the back of my hoodie.
 
I yanked forward with everything I had, nearly choking myself in the process. The grip slipped, but I felt fingers scrape the back of my neck, ice-cold and too long.
 
I slammed into my door, fumbling with my keys, my vision swimming with panic. My hands were shaking too hard—
 
The footsteps stopped.
 
Silence.
 
I turned the key and practically fell inside, kicking the door shut and locking it in the same motion. My pulse was a war drum in my ears.
 
I pressed my back against the door, gasping for breath.
 
I waited. Five seconds. Ten.
 
Nothing.
 
I forced myself to move, creeping toward the peephole.
 
The field outside was empty.
 
My hands were still shaking as I grabbed a chair and wedged it under the doorknob. It wouldn’t stop someone from getting in if they really wanted to, but it made me feel better.
 
I staggered back to the couch, running a hand over my face. I can’t just stay here. I need to leave.
 
But that’s what the stranger said, right? Leave tonight.
 
If I packed up and took off, was I walking right into something worse?
 
I needed a plan.
 
I glanced around my apartment, trying to focus. I could grab my work laptop, get some cash from the ATM, maybe head—
 
My TV flickered on.
 
I jumped. The remote was on the coffee table, untouched.
 
The screen glowed white for a second before shifting to a news broadcast. A man in a suit and tie sat at a desk, reading from a teleprompter.
 
But something was wrong.
 
His skin was too smooth, like wax. His mouth moved a second after the words came out, like bad dubbing. And his eyes… his eyes were solid black.
 
I couldn’t move.
 
I couldn’t breathe.
 
The anchor smiled—too wide—and said:
 
“Good evening, Evan.”
 
The air left my lungs.
 
The man chuckled like I’d just told a joke. “You’ve had quite the night, haven’t you?”
 
I wanted to turn the TV off. But I couldn’t move.
 
“We don’t usually like to involve new players so quickly,” the anchor continued. “But you’ve made quite the impression.”
 
His head tilted. The background behind him flickered—static, static, an empty street, static, my apartment complex, static.
 
“The hunt begins soon.”
 
My stomach twisted.
 
The man smiled again, his teeth stretching too far, gums black like oil. “You should get some rest, Evan. You’ll need it.”
 
The screen cut to static.
 
I lunged forward and yanked the plug from the wall.
 
Darkness swallowed the room.
 
I stood there, heart pounding, staring at my reflection in the blank screen.
 
Then, from outside—
 
A soft knock, knock, knock at my door.
 
I stopped breathing.
 
I turned slowly, the blood draining from my face.
 
Three knocks. The same as before.
 
I didn’t move.
 
Didn’t blink.
 
Then, a voice—muffled, right outside the door.
 
“Run, Evan.”
 
(END OF CHAPTER ONE.)

The Blackout Protocol

A First-Hand Account by Evan Wren

Chapter Two: No Way Out

⸻

Part One: Run

The knock at the door wasn’t loud. It wasn’t aggressive.

But it sent a bolt of ice through my spine.

Knock, knock, knock.

The same rhythm as before. The same message.

And then—a whisper.

“Run, Evan.”

My breath caught in my throat. My hands clenched into fists. Every part of my brain screamed at me to not open that door.

Then—another knock. Softer. Urgent.

“Evan, open up. It’s me.”

The voice was… familiar.

I hesitated, then moved toward the peephole. My eye pressed to the cold glass, and—

Nia.

The cashier from the Dollar General.

She was alone, looking over her shoulder with quick, darting movements. Her body was tense, shifting on the balls of her feet like she was ready to sprint at any moment.

I hesitated, my heartbeat hammering in my ears.

Nia knocked again, harder this time. “Evan, please.”

Every instinct told me to ignore her. To stay locked in.

But something in her voice—the sheer urgency—made me reach for the lock.

The second the latch clicked back into place, she shoved the door open and nearly knocked me off my feet.

She slammed it shut behind her and spun, pressing her back against it like she expected someone to charge through any second.

Her brown eyes locked onto mine, intense, searching. “Are you real?”

“What the hell?” I shoved her back, confused and on edge. “What kind of question is that?”

She reached out and pressed two fingers hard against the pulse point on my wrist. It wasn’t gentle—it was like she was checking for something.

“Are you real?” she repeated.

I ripped my arm away. “Of course, I’m real!”

She let out a breath and took a half-step back.

I rubbed my chest where she’d pushed me. “What the hell is going on?”

Nia turned toward the door, listening. The whole apartment had gone deathly quiet. No traffic. No night bugs. No TVs muffled through the walls.

Then, the whispering began again.

It started as a murmur, slithering in from the cracks around the doorframe. Then it grew. More voices. More layers. A hushed conversation happening just outside my door.

I didn’t understand the words. I wasn’t sure they were words.

Nia sucked in a breath through her teeth. “They know I’m here.”

Her fingers dug into my wrist before I could ask what the hell that meant.

“We have to go.”

I didn’t argue.

She yanked the door open.

And they were waiting.

Not standing in the hallway. Not visible.

But the air felt thicker, pressing against us like a living thing. And the whispers—they didn’t sound distant anymore.

They sounded like they were coming from inside my walls.

Nia pulled me forward. “Don’t stop. Don’t look at them.”

I didn’t know who them was.

But I didn’t look.

We ran.

She led me down the stairs, through the parking lot, toward the maintenance gate at the back of the complex. I could hear soft footsteps following, moving in unison, just out of sight.

I made the mistake of looking back.

They were watching.

Not chasing. Not attacking.

Just standing in the open doorways of apartments. Behind cars. Peeking out from between the buildings.

A man in a suit stood under the flickering streetlight, his face smooth and unfinished, like an artist had given up halfway through sculpting him.

A woman in a nightgown was hunched behind a tree, her head tilted at an angle that shouldn’t have been possible.

My stomach turned to ice.

I faced forward and ran faster.

Nia shoved open the maintenance gate, pulling me through just as something lunged at me from the side.

I caught a glimpse of pale fingers, too many of them, reaching out from the darkness.

I didn’t scream. I just ran.

She slammed the gate shut behind us, locking them out—for now.

We didn’t stop running until we reached my van.

She snatched the keys from my pocket before I could protest, unlocked the door, and shoved me into the passenger seat.

Then she peeled out of the parking lot like the devil himself was behind us.

⸻

Part Two: The Huntkeeper’s Game

We didn’t speak for the first five minutes.

The van’s headlights cut through the darkness, but the town around us was wrong. Streetlights flickered. Houses sat dark and silent. There were no other cars.

It was like the whole town had paused.

Finally, I broke the silence.

“How do you know my name?”

Nia exhaled through her nose, keeping her eyes on the road.

“They said it.”

I blinked. “Who?”

“The Whisperers.”

The name sent an involuntary shudder through me.

She glanced at me briefly. “They whisper to each other about the players. I heard them say your name before I saw you at the store.”

A pit formed in my stomach.

I licked my lips. “And yours?”

She hesitated. “They said mine too.”

I didn’t like the way she said that. Like it meant something worse.

I swallowed hard. “So, what is this? What the hell did I get dragged into?”

Nia sighed.

“You’re in The Hunt,” she said. “And you weren’t supposed to survive this long.”

I clenched my jaw. “What does that mean?”

She drummed her fingers against the wheel. “It’s a game. A ritual. You ever wonder why people go missing and no one remembers? Why the cops don’t do anything? Why the world just moves on?”

I didn’t answer.

“It’s because of him,” she continued. “The Huntkeeper. He runs this thing. He picks the players. He sets the rules.”

I took a slow breath. “And the rules are…?”

“You survive.” She glanced at me. “For forty-eight hours.”

A weight settled in my chest.

“So I just run?”

“That’s the normal game.” She hesitated. “But… there’s someone else. Someone messing with the rules.”

I frowned. “What do you mean?”

She licked her lips. “The Huntkeeper keeps things tight. Local. Controlled. But they—” she swallowed—“they like to stretch the game out. Make players run further. Across state lines. Across borders.”

I felt my stomach sink.

“You weren’t supposed to make it out of your apartment,” she muttered. “But someone wanted you to.”

⸻

Part Three: Signal Interference

The hum of the van’s engine was the only sound between us.

The town around us still felt off. Every street we passed was either too dark or too still—like the buildings themselves were holding their breath.

I should’ve been relieved that we’d made it out of the complex. That I wasn’t standing frozen in my living room, watching my television speak directly to me. But instead, I felt like we’d only made it to the next level.

Nia was gripping the steering wheel too tight.

She had this way of not blinking long enough to make me nervous—like she was expecting something to materialize in the middle of the road at any second.

“So,” I started, my voice coming out rough. “You were gonna explain why the hell my name is on the news.”

She took a slow breath but didn’t take her eyes off the road.

“It’s not just on the news, Evan.”

I frowned. “What does that mean?”

She tapped her fingers on the steering wheel, thinking. “It means there isn’t a single person left in this town who won’t recognize your name. Or your face.”

The pit in my stomach grew.

She adjusted the rearview mirror. “They’ll be looking for you. Regular people. Cops. Cashiers. Strangers you pass on the street. Everyone.”

I shook my head. “That doesn’t make any damn sense. Why would they care?”

Nia finally glanced at me. “Because the broadcasts told them to.”

Before I could respond, the van’s radio clicked on by itself.

A sharp whine filled the air, like old dial-up internet booting up. Then—

“…Coming up next, an urgent update on Evan Wren, now considered armed and dangerous. If spotted, do not approach…”

I flinched.

The voice was smooth, sterile, that same rehearsed cadence every news anchor had. But something about it was… wrong.

Then, another voice cut in—low, distorted, unnatural.

“The frequencies shift. The puppets stir.”

My skin crawled.

Static washed over the speakers.

“They hear us. They obey. They wait for the command.”

The sound cut out.

I turned to Nia, my hands clammy. “What the hell was that?”

She clenched her jaw. “It’s worse than I thought.”

She turned onto a side road, speeding toward the highway.

I tried to keep my voice steady. “What was that supposed to be? Some kind of… hacked radio signal?”

She exhaled shakily. “Did you ever wonder why the Hunt exists?”

I stayed silent.

“The government doesn’t just allow it,” she said. “They use it.”

My throat went dry. “Use it how?”

She gripped the wheel tighter. “The radio waves. The broadcasts. They’re not just news.”

I stared at her.

“They control people, Evan.”

The words sat in the air, wrong and impossible, but my gut knew better than to dismiss them.

I let out a weak laugh. “That’s insane.”

But I didn’t sound convinced.

“Ever hear of The Blackout Protocol?” she asked.

The name sent a sharp spike of something through me.

I hadn’t heard it before. Not really. But my brain reacted like it had.

Like I’d forgotten something important.

I rubbed my temples. “What is it?”

Nia’s voice was quieter now. “It’s a way to wipe people clean. To take anyone—make them forget who they are. Then program them into something else.”

I didn’t speak.

She kept going.

“They can make you kill and not even remember doing it. Make you hunt someone down and believe it’s your idea.”

A sick feeling twisted in my stomach.

“And the Hunt?” I asked.

She swallowed. “It’s a testing ground.”

A silence fell over the van.

I couldn’t process it. Couldn’t accept it.

There were so many things that didn’t make sense, but at the same time, it explained everything.

The disappearances. The way people never seemed to notice the ones who went missing.

The Whisperers—the ones who were already taken. The ones who listened to the signals.

I gripped the seat. “So what? That means anyone listening to the broadcast could be turned into—”

“Yes.”

I felt sick.

The van’s radio crackled again.

Then, the news anchor’s voice returned—smooth, calm, waiting.

“Good evening, Evan. Seven hours have passed.”

My skin crawled.

“Forty-one remain.”

Static swallowed the transmission.

Then, outside—

Streetlights popped, one by one.

A crowd stood in the road ahead. Silent. Waiting.

Pale faces. Dark eyes.

They weren’t Whisperers.

They were something else.

Their bodies stood stiff and unnatural, like puppets held up by invisible strings.

And their heads all turned toward the van at the exact same time.

The hair on my arms rose.

A ripple moved through them—like something touched their minds all at once.

Then—they started running.

Nia swore and spun the wheel.

We crashed through a rusted fence and onto a dirt road. The van jolted violently. I gripped the door, heart hammering.

“They’re everywhere,” I gasped.

Nia floored it.

The last thing I saw before the road blurred past—

A figure, standing above the crowd. Taller. Watching.

Its arms were too long. Its face wasn’t a face at all. Just a blank void.

And then—

The TV inside a roadside gas station flickered to life as we sped past.

The news anchor smiled.

“Run faster, Evan.”

For example, I have one four year old who eats 2 zebra cakes, a can of coke, a large McDonald’s fries and a danimals all just for lunch. He eats at least 3 zebra cakes daily (400 calories each, 33 grams of sugar each). He is relatively small for his age, but I worry about diabetes or getting nutrients to grow. Another child I see is 3 years old and is overfed every day. There is a plate of food at all times in front of her to snack on, and it gets refilled with something new each time she finishes. She eats McDonald’s pancakes (3 of them) with syrup, McDonald’s chicken nuggets, and chips just for snack. She eats everything, sometimes healthy foods, but everything is in really large quantities. She has gotten so large to the point where she prefers to lay down on the couch all the time and cannot be carried at 3 years old.

Iced Coffee v1.0 https://brew.link/p/CICC

Since Aiden can’t do ratios more concentrated than 1:14, I knew there would need to be some extra steps. So I went for simplicity in that regard.

I wanted to follow Hoffman’s advice in both his iced pourover video and iced immersion video. The main takeaway was to increase extraction. 

In the immersion recipe, he recommended 2/3 brewing water and 1/3 ice, which worked perfectly for simplicity here: just halve your selected amount of water to get the amount of ice necessary.

I don’t remember the exact ratios, but a 1:10 ratio (coffee to brewing water, not total water) was somewhere in the middle of the iced pourover and iced immersion recipes. Again, that works perfectly for simplicity: simply double the recommended amount of coffee. Because of that, I don’t recommend going over ~850 as that could lead to overflowing the basket.

He recommended grinding a bit finer than your normal pourover grind size, so I went 2 clicks finer than my normal grind size for the coffee, on the ode w/gen 2 burrs.

That leaves temperature and number of pulses. Looking to increase extraction, I went with the highest temp possible for the bloom and lowered slightly to somewhat emulate kettle heat loss.

With the Aiden, increasing the number of pulses essentially increases agitation. So I went with 10 to get max agitation.

The result is a pleasant iced coffee with clear tasting notes. I brewed the switch recipe from Hoffman’s immersion video earlier today and the cups were comparable, with a slightly more acidic top note from the Aiden cup.

I think it’s at least a good jumping off point. I will definitely be using this profile again.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I'm well versed in these devices but I'm kind of at my wits end with my mum's one. She uses the same coffee i do.  In the same grinder with the same setting as mine... Everything's the same. My coffee is perfect every time however for some reason her grinder keeps getting clogged up and I'm referring to every use here...


I clean it out completely from go to whoa using pipe cleaners and brushes and everything but as soon as I begin grinding coffee it immediately clogs at the chute and then clogs at the conical burr grind part where the ground coffee then spins and spins eventually ""forcing"" the ground coffee out of the exit hole after it's been overground from being clogged up.... 


In case what I've just written makes no sense, grinder has been cleaned fully. Dismantled and brushed out entirely. Reassembled. You then grind coffee... Nothing comes out for about 10 seconds then after a while then coffee grounds start to ""drizzle"" through but it's only coming out at all because the chute has gotten so clogged that it's just falling out the bottom....

However, recent events have had me really upset, and I'm looking for some direction to move forward. I'm extremely new to dating and went on my first first date with a girl at my college (a coffee shop) last week. This week, we got dinner together and had a blast—3 hours just flew by. We talked about a lot of things, but had a discussion about previous relationships and had a long conversation about how neither of us was ready until now for various reasons. She said she hasn't dated at all in the past for personal reasons, and I said I was in the same boat and only recently came to terms with different things in my life. She was super receptive the whole time, telling me about what our next date should be, visiting her on campus, and making plans for the summer moving forward. I had my first kiss with her in the parking lot. It was slow and nice and made me feel really warm inside. It was fulfilling and made me happy I had waited for someone who made me feel safe and glad to experience that.

The next day, just a few hours after she texted first and willingly organized plans with me for the following week along with saying she had an amazing time last night, texts me a long paragraph saying she's not ready for a relationship, has some personal things to deal with, and is scared about things changing in her life. She said she thought she had it figured out but realized it's too early for her, and decided to delete Hinge (where we met). She tried her best to emphasize that it wasn't anything I did wrong, nor was there any specific moment she felt uninterested. Since this is my first time going through something like this, I'm completely devastated, as I've never felt this way about a girl before, and I was so extremely happy after my first kiss with someone I felt like I had a bit of a connection with. I've been feeling super down about this over the last 2 days and can't come to terms with rejection. I want to be as genuine as possible, and we already agreed to go our separate ways with no bad blood, but I haven't stopped thinking about it and feel as if I'm becoming overly upset about this.

If anyone is reading this thinking I got attached too early, I completely understand, but I'm very new to this and, as a result, I'm finding it a lot harder to deal with than most people would.

## Key Features to Consider When Choosing a Mobile Stand Up Desk

Now that we've examined the different audience segments, let's delve into the key features you should consider when choosing a **mobile stand up desk**:

Look for desks with smooth and easy-to-use adjustment mechanisms, such as pneumatic or electric lifts. A **pneumatic mobile standing desk** often provides smoother,easier adjustments than manual options.
*   **Desktop Size and Shape:** The size of the desktop should be sufficient to accommodate your laptop, monitor, keyboard, mouse, and any other essential items.

A **desk on wheels for laptop** might be smaller than one intended for a **dual monitor mobile stand up desk**.

*   **Mobility and Casters:** The casters should be smooth-rolling and durable. Locking mechanisms are essential to keep the desk in place when you're working. Consider the type of flooring you'll be using the desk on and choose casters that are appropriate for that surface. A **rolling laptop desk** should have easily maneuverable casters.

**INTRO** (FEEL FREE TO SKIP, I WROTE TOO MUCH): Hey all, I passed my PMP Exam yesterday, refreshed my email non-stop, finally got my results today, and so I’m doing the obligatory post cataloguing my heroic journey, as well as the tips and tricks picked up along the way. I’ll try to keep it succinct, and then also tell you why I wasn’t a fan of the exam, even though I did fairly well.

First, my background. My PM ‘experience’ barely qualifies. I’ve led projects, but in truth, it’s not formal at all. I used the right language, so I think that’s the only reason they accepted it. So, I’m probably the least experienced PMP ever lol.

My education makes up for it a bit. I have a Masters in Engineering Management, with a focus in Entrepreneurship. I have a Green Belt in Lean Six Sigma and most recently got a Google PM Certificate two years ago. So, nothing was too foreign coming into this. Most people on here have nothing good to say about the Google Cert, but to be fair, it definitely touches on the basics of all the methodologies/tools.

Now, for the stuff you might care about. I got approved to take the PMP March 9 2024. I’m a skilled procrastinator, hence why I passed with only 4 days to spare, but I got started slowly and immediately. Almost every time I went to the gym, I spent 20-30 mins on the treadmill listening to DM. First, it was the PMBOK breakdown, then the 150 PMBOK questions, then the 200 Agile questions. All that totals to about 15 hours, but I spread it out over the first \~40 weeks (Like I said, slowww).

Then, I was distracted by some other stuff and I was mad that PMI kept deleting the promo codes before I could use them, so I basically said “Screw it!” and decided that I wasn’t going to even take the exam for the next 9-10 weeks. But, I got over all that and thought if I didn’t take it now, I never would (Also, I finally got a code). So, now I had 2 weeks left before my window expired. I got my membership, paid for my test, and booked an appointment for March 5, 2025.

I’m a terrible studier, but a great test taker, so with everything I’ve already done, which is already more than I’ve done for any test/project/class, I was feeling ready. But, YOU GUYS.. THIS SUB.. I kept reading that DMs questions are much easier than the test (and that was the bulk of my studying, outside of the PM Cert from 2 years ago). So, I started doing ARs Ultra Hard questions. I got through a few, but now I was doubting myself. I saved $60 on the test with the promo code, so I invested $50 into Study Hall, with less than a week until my test, as a final bit of insurance.

 

**STUDY HALL:** With only 5 days, I couldn’t mess around. I did every mini-exam (I never could bring myself to do the full 4 hour mocks), and of course reviewed every answer, right or wrong. My initial average was 64%. I looked at the categories I was weakest in, then did only those practice questions until I felt confident. Afterwards, I reset/retook my weakest exams. I scored 80-90% on them (I think I subconsciously remembered some of them though) with a final mini-exam average of 76%, practice question average of 70% (Though I only did my weakest areas) and an average answer speed of 45 secs. Now, I was feeling good, but on the night before the test I went through all 354 flash cards (probably a poor thing to finish with tbh) and of course watched the mindset video (which is good, but overrated w/out a caveat. More on that later.).

TIP: This is the only bit of value I can add that I haven’t seen elsewhere on here. DM has a video that came out about a month ago called PMP CHEAT SHEET (only 17 minutes). That was also one of the last things I watched, and it’s a good finisher. You’re not going to learn anything too specific from it, but he goes over the exam outline and breaks down the domains. I paused on each slide to make sure I knew the gist, and looked up anything that didn’t click with me right away. Great review video!

 

**TEST CONDITIONS:** My test was scheduled in-person at 1:30 PM. I wanted to ensure I could get close to 8 hours of sleep and arrive early (Test Center is \~45 minutes away, not bad.). Center had 2 college kids running it; Pretty relaxed, but still professional. Got a locker for my stuff. Brought a coffee drink (w/ L-Theanine in it, so nice stable energy throughout) and a water, plus a couple energy bars I didn’t eat. They let me start early, gave me everything I needed, offered over-ear headphones (which I declined, since it wasn’t noisy), and they sat me in a testing room that was half full, so I had no direct neighbors. Comfy chair, comfy temperature, monitor was widescreen (unnecessary, but fine. Prob awkward if you had a neighbor, since the barricades were kind of shallow). Anyway, I was off to the races…

 

**TEST:** I did the 1st set of 60 questions in 70 mins, the 2nd set in 60, and the 3rd set 60, with 40 mins remaining (Took my 2 breaks, but came back with \~3 mins on each one). That’s a little over a minute a question, which is slower than my 45 sec on SH, but I never felt a time crunch. Despite that, I didn’t flag or go back to any question. I knew that if I couldn’t reason it out in a minute, I could only guess and move on.

1st set as a whole was the hardest, wordier (More on that later). This is different then what I was reading from others, where it sounded like the test started easy and got harder. Thankfully, the other sets were more normal. I only had the one math question. No Drag and Drop. No other formula questions. No graph questions. A decent amount of Pick 2/3s though, which I find easier than the regular MC. I was kind of disappointed; I wanted the variety and thought the SH Flash Card definitions would make the Drag N Drop a breeze. I wonder if I got an older question set or something.

I see why there are differing statements on this sub about the difficulty of the test and why people feel like they failed, then end up passing. I found the questions different than Study Hall, or DMs, or any of the questions I practiced. They were scenarios, but despite being wordy, I found them somewhat vague/ambiguous. Like, are we being tested on our PM knowledge, or on the ability to solve riddles lol. Contrast that to all the Study questions, where I had a better idea of what they were asking.

This is where the mindset can come in. No clue what the question wants? Ignore it and apply the mindset to guess an answer (NOTE: I will say though, there were at least 2 questions where the situation was painted dire, and so I disregarded the mindset and took action to cancel the project or ask the sponsor for more money. Basically, if the question already details that you did your due diligence and you’re stuck, then bother people, ask for money, do what you gotta do). The only other tip I can offer is I got A LOT of questions about teams of different cultures and I always picked the most PC, least realistic answer (These were pretty obvious, as the wrong choices were basically just discriminate against them).

All that being said, before I got my provisional pass, I had zero clue if I would pass or fail. It was just too different from all the practice questions. But, as you can see in the pics, my total average was AT even though my breakdown was T/AT/BT. (Never though I'd get BT in Business Environment...)

 

**CONCLUSION:** First, if you got this far, this is probably geared towards you: THANKS! The people that engage on this sub, providing rationale to tricky questions, providing study/exam insight to others, do a lot of good and helped put me at ease. I’ll still lurk on this sub and will try and help others when I can to give back.

Despite my complaints about the test, I’m glad I passed and I enjoy the material. I might look at the PMI-ACP next, as it seems like there’s a lot of overlap. For now, I’m going to update my resume and try to get into a job where I can get into more formal projects, get some real experience.

As far as people preparing for the exam, I would still start with DMs videos (PMBOK breakdown, 150 PMBOK questions, 200 Agile, and 100 Waterfall if you have time), then do ARs 200 Ultra-Hard questions. Then, if you aren’t doing special classes or prep courses geared towards the PMP, I would recommend the $50 Study Hall for sure. Could I have passed it without it? Maybe, but it would’ve been closer for sure and I would’ve been nervous the entire time leading up to the test. I don’t regret it (and I’m a cheapskate).

Anyway, thanks for being with me on the journey to this point, and you should get at least 10 PDUs for reading this novel.",5,1741313426.0,pmp,3,1.0,False

So I’m a bearded and tattooed guy that is also a dad. I’m married, have a fantastic job, travel a lot, and living a life most would be envious of. I guess it depends on what makes you envious. I don’t brag but I’ve been told it’s desirable, but it mostly just tears me apart.

But I’m also lonely and mostly tired.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes I travel, most times I find. But my life is basically just meetings about meetings and it’s exhausting. I play some music while working. I play guitar and piano, neither one very good but I think they’re decent at least. I read a lot which makes me write a lot. I write mostly poetry and short stories. Nothing longer has lived up to my expectations. 

I’m a coffee snob that loves concerts. If you like a band I let have already seen them live. I love it. I love to cook, and I really enjoy nerdy things like making spreadsheets for everything. Both arms are covered in ink and I plan to get many more.

You? Just be cool. I don’t have stipulations other than you at least try to have convo. I want to be seen and heard and I want someone I look forward to talking to.

I’m currently pregnant for the first time & I’ll be 20 weeks this Sunday! I have my anatomy scan next week to check on baby, but, I still feel an immense amount of guilt that something could be wrong. 

I started my pregnancy overweight and I’m failing my goals. I didn’t want to give into pregnancy cravings but now it’s all I can do. I ate pretty healthy throughout my first trimester, with the occasional vomiting up breakfast. 

In my second trimester, I’ve been drinking and eating terribly. I’ve had caffeine free soda, regular soda, decaf or half caff coffee, and minimal water. I feel like my water consumption is a lot of water on weekends, a few glasses here and there throughout the week. As for food, I’m eating fast food for breakfast and/or lunch daily (dunkin wraps/sandwiches and A LOT of chick fil a). I’ve been downing chocolate like I need it to breathe. 

So far, baby is perfectly healthy. I’m terrified my anatomy scan is going to show otherwise and it is all my fault. I feel like because of this, I’m not ready to be a mother. I feel so guilty and if anything is wrong with the baby, like I genuinely want to punish myself for it. I feel so much anguish and guilt and resentment towards myself, over stuff I could control but I suck at it. My mental health feels so low. 

I don’t know why I’m posting this. I hope it gets better, I hope I feel better, but most of all, I hope more than anything that she’s healthy. ",3,1741313298.0,BabyBumps,3,1.0,False

I have a bright future in a career that I am passionate about. I have a caring family that will always have my back and support. Although of few friends, those that I have are very close and trustworthy. However, for most of my life, there I something that I have lacked. I am not just talking about love. Rather, I am talking about having someone.

 

Someone to walk through life with. Someone to carve through the intricacies of living with. Someone to support and be supported by. Someone to talk about my day with, and who tells me about theirs in turn. Someone with whom I can share my pains and joys, and who shares their victories and defeats with me as well.

 

I am not looking for my soulmate. I am looking for a partner who will always be there for me, as I will be there for her. If any of this resonates with you, please keep reading.

 

**----- About me -----**

 

I am a 32 years-old guy from Chile. I am 185 centimeters tall, with an average bulk. I am black-haired and brown-eyed. I have been told that I have a cute face and great hands. While I do not exercise often, I keep proper care of my health. I speak both Spanish and English fluently. I am involved in the computer science field. Some of my hobbies are watching anime/series and playing video games.

 

As you can guess from those hobbies, I am mostly a homebody with nerdy interests. However, I enjoy doing several other things as well, especially if it is with the right person. Going out on walks, visiting new coffee shops, going to the cinema and any other relaxing date plans are enjoyable to me. Traveling around the world and learning about many different cultures is also something that drives me.

 

My personality type is INTJ-A. I am a naturally curious person, so expect me to inquire often about all kinds of things. I am also pretty structured and like to manage all kinds of things around me. When I am passionate about something, I give it my all. I am probably a little too honest. I take pride in being a respectful person who values equality among all people.

 

I am not fond of extreme political views from either side of the spectrum. While I was raised in a Catholic household and I strongly believe in God, nowadays I follow my faith in my own way. I do not drink or smoke.

 

Like all human beings, I am not perfect. Although I believe that I deal with it rather well, I have a shy personality. While I can be introverted and like to spend some time charging myself up sometimes, I also get rather clingy with my partner so I will be looking out for you even during those times. I also like being the one who leads in the relationship, which I understand might not be for everyone, but I believe that I should be upfront about it. I am not the kind of guy who would mistreat you, though. Just know that even while being in charge, I strongly value my partner’s opinions.

 

**----- Who I am looking for -----**

 

I am not looking for someone who fits everything that I will describe. Rather, I value someone who is aware of our differences and is willing to find a middle ground whenever we do not agree with something. Communication is what is key here. Being honest and not keeping things to ourselves is something that I consider very important.

 

I will reiterate that communication is important. I hope that my partner also values talking regularly and getting to know each other to the best of our capabilities. I will do my best to keep the conversation ongoing and I hope you will do the same. I do understand that work, studies, and other things will sometimes keep either of us busy.

 

I would prefer my partner to be a few years younger than me, but I will not provide a specific age range as what matters to me is chemistry and having similar goals. While I care more about these things and emotional attraction, I must mention that I do have a preference for leaner girls who are a little bit shorter than me. To avoid wasting each other’s time, please be willing to exchange selfies once we start talking to see if there is enough physical attraction. I am happy with any ethnicity or race. I do not mind about your religion, either. I am more than happy to learn about your culture and to find ways to close the gaps between our differences in this regard.

 

I hope that you are passionate about your path in life. You will have all my support in becoming someone successful. As for hobbies, you do not need to share the same hobbies as me, but a willingness from both of us to learn about the other’s hobbies would be nice. I would prefer if you are either a homebody or prefer more relaxing activities, as going to clubs is not too appealing to me. Going to bars from time to time is alright.

 

Please be upfront about yourself and your life situation. I am not looking for a perfect person, so I wish to learn about both your good and bad sides. While I hope to be given the lead and be relied upon to some degree, I hope just as much that you have your own opinion on all kinds of topics and talk with me about your different views on whatever comes our way.

 

**----- Logistics -----**

 

To finalize, I want to be clear that I am looking for a long-term relationship that will most likely start online, but that ultimately leads to an in-person commitment with the hopes that it will last for a lifetime. I like some traditional values, such as forming a tight, supportive family and taking the lead but, at the same time, I want my partner to feel successful and right next to me in this venture, so let us split both the chores and bills even if neither is half and half. I would like to have around two children, ideally before I am 40. I would also be happy to have a pair of cats and perhaps other pets. Please be open to eventually discussing topics like these.

 

Regarding eventual relocation, due to my career, I may be moving in the short-term future from my country, but I hope that you are also willing to relocate and find the best way for us to be together. While I will not provide a specific timeframe, perhaps meeting within 6-9 months after we decide to commit to each other is reasonable. If everything goes well, we could possibly decide about relocating within 1 and a half or 2 years. Of course, that will depend on our situation. For example, if you are studying, I can wait for you to finish your studies.

 

This is the second version of this post and I am surely still forgetting something. As you can see, I write a lot. Thank you for reading this far. Feel free to message me if you think that we would be a good match. I am posting this in several subs, so please tell me where you found it, and what caught your eye about it!

While I can be introverted and like to spend some time charging myself up sometimes, I also get rather clingy with my partner so I will be looking out for you even during those times. I also like being the one who leads in the relationship, which I understand might not be for everyone, but I believe that I should be upfront about it. I am not the kind of guy who would mistreat you, though. Just know that even while being in charge, I strongly value my partner’s opinions.

 

**----- Who I am looking for -----**

 

I am not looking for someone who fits everything that I will describe. Rather, I value someone who is aware of our differences and is willing to find a middle ground whenever we do not agree with something. Communication is what is key here. Being honest and not keeping things to ourselves is something that I consider very important.

 

I will reiterate that communication is important. I hope that my partner also values talking regularly and getting to know each other to the best of our capabilities. I will do my best to keep the conversation ongoing and I hope you will do the same. I do understand that work, studies, and other things will sometimes keep either of us busy.

 

I would prefer my partner to be a few years younger than me, but I will not provide a specific age range as what matters to me is chemistry and having similar goals. While I care more about these things and emotional attraction, I must mention that I do have a preference for leaner girls who are a little bit shorter than me. To avoid wasting each other’s time, please be willing to exchange selfies once we start talking to see if there is enough physical attraction. I am happy with any ethnicity or race. I do not mind about your religion, either. I am more than happy to learn about your culture and to find ways to close the gaps between our differences in this regard.

 

I hope that you are passionate about your path in life. You will have all my support in becoming someone successful. As for hobbies, you do not need to share the same hobbies as me, but a willingness from both of us to learn about the other’s hobbies would be nice. I would prefer if you are either a homebody or prefer more relaxing activities, as going to clubs is not too appealing to me. Going to bars from time to time is alright.

 

Please be upfront about yourself and your life situation. I am not looking for a perfect person, so I wish to learn about both your good and bad sides. While I hope to be given the lead and be relied upon to some degree, I hope just as much that you have your own opinion on all kinds of topics and talk with me about your different views on whatever comes our way.

 

**----- Logistics -----**

 

To finalize, I want to be clear that I am looking for a long-term relationship that will most likely start online, but that ultimately leads to an in-person commitment with the hopes that it will last for a lifetime. I like some traditional values, such as forming a tight, supportive family and taking the lead but, at the same time, I want my partner to feel successful and right next to me in this venture, so let us split both the chores and bills even if neither is half and half. I would like to have around two children, ideally before I am 40. I would also be happy to have a pair of cats and perhaps other pets. Please be open to eventually discussing topics like these.

 

Regarding eventual relocation, due to my career, I may be moving in the short-term future from my country, but I hope that you are also willing to relocate and find the best way for us to be together. While I will not provide a specific timeframe, perhaps meeting within 6-9 months after we decide to commit to each other is reasonable. If everything goes well, we could possibly decide about relocating within 1 and a half or 2 years. Of course, that will depend on our situation. For example, if you are studying, I can wait for you to finish your studies.

My personality type is INTJ-A. I am a naturally curious person, so expect me to inquire often about all kinds of things. I am also pretty structured and like to manage all kinds of things around me.

I don't typically get anything because I hate the taste of coffee, I just tag along.

I didn't really like this rule because I would often go with my sister to try new coffee places, but I just went along with it.

The other day she texted me about this new coffee place she went to with her friends. I was a little frustrated because I take our rule seriously and always tell people no to new coffee places. Today I asked her if our rule still applied and explained that I was checking because she went with her friends.

She was upset and said she should have leeway because she likes coffee and I don't. I said I understood but that's not fair because I can't go to any coffee place at all without her but she can do whatever. I said both of us need to have leeway or neither. She said I was too focused on it being ""fair"" and not her feelings. She claimed not everything has to be perfectly even because coffee is important to her but not to me.

I said again that I needed things to be even and that it's upsetting I've spent the last 3yrs telling my sister I couldn't tag along with her to a coffee shop when my girlfriend can just go out to a new one with her friends whenever. She stormed out. Our real conversation was much longer but I don't have the time to write that out and you all don't have the team to read it lol.

My question is, am I being unreasonable because of my autistic need for everything to be equal and fair, or is she being unreasonable by expecting a rule to apply to me with no exceptions, but not to her?",4,1741312892.0,AutisticAdults,10,0.83,False
1j5cj7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1j5cj7b/ashwagandha_adventures/,Ashwagandha Adventures,"I have massive social anxiety and generalized anxiety. I'm terrified of leaving the house and terrified of speaking to people and terrified of doing something wrong and can hardly function. I can't even have a job or drive or go to the doctor because I'm terrified of all these things. I hardly ever leave the house out of fear.

I needed to go to my storage locker today, with the help of a random stranger to haul some furniture back to my house. Which is of course, terrifying. In the morning I felt very odd and unprepared and anxious and wanted to back out. I had been planning this for months and not looking forward to it at all.

Before I left, I noticed my first bottle of ashwagandha had come in the mail. I had never taken it before but somewhat recklessly decided I would take one, in the hopes that it would help me get through this crazy day.

I also take many other supplements every day to help with chronic fatigue, and focus. I also take St John's wort for mood stabilization and L-theanine for anxiety, with these I usually wind up with some energy but still tons of anxiety.

I normally take a caffeine pill every day, and today I also had a V8 energy which has caffeine and B vitamins, which I do once in awhile for an added boost, as I have chronic fatigue, and ADHD which means I have awful brain fog without these things.

Normally the amount of energizing things I take understandably give me MORE anxiety. And having the extra caffeine and B vitamins today I would normally be jittery and anxious.

But I felt superhuman today. I had a lively talk with this stranger who was helping me move stuff the entire time we were driving, and I walked into a gas station, used the ATM, and bought a coffee, all without ANY anxiety. Normally I'd be breathing heavy and nervous as all hell and beating myself up for saying stupid things etc but I wasn't anxious AT ALL and found the whole thing very easy and natural and did not give two shits what a single person thought of me, nor did it even cross my mind, when normally I automatically assume that everyone thinks I'm weird and stupid and doing everything wrong, and can't stop focusing on it to the point I can't think straight and wind up messing up more.

Yes I'm in therapy.

Disclaimer: Ambiguous title alert. This story may cause the reader to have chills, goosebumps, or a change in perception of how the universe works.

-I would like to pose a question to those of you who believe that Human Beings are creatures of free will:

What if you saw a disturbing glimpse of your future in a dream, and no matter how hard you tried to avoid it, you ended up causing it to happen?

Well, It happened to me. And I'd like to share it with you.

First a little background:
I was just a 12 year old kid, before the advent of cell phones, streaming media, or even the internet for that matter, I didn’t know much about ‘precognition’ and things of that nature. No, my biggest pursuits were comic books, collecting Hot Wheels cars, and supporting my video game addiction over at the local arcade.
  
The year was 1978.
  
Anyway, so I got this little weekend job down at the swap meet (about two blocks from my house) helping out this old Chinese vendor named Chung. The job was simple; meet Chung at the Drive-in theater early Saturday and Sunday morning to help set up his vendor stall with merchandise consisting of knock-off Gucci bags, pocketbooks, and assorted women’s shoes, then assisting him throughout the day. At the end of the day Chung would hand me a nice crispy $10.00 bill. 
  
I was making 20 bucks a week, which in 1978 afforded me the latest issues of Mad Magazine and collectible Hot Wheels, as well as a shot at that new video game over at the arcade called ‘Space Invaders’.
  
On one Friday night I sat on the edge of my bed, reached over to my nightstand and picked up my little alarm clock to set it for work the next morning. Swap meet vendors had to be there early so that they could set up and be ready to meet the throngs of shoppers coming in at 7:00 when the ticket gates opened.
  
My alarm clock was an old vintage wind-up handed down to me from my grandmother. It had a round face and two little bells on top that would ring when the hour hand reached the third hand, (also known as the ‘alarm hand’). I set the alarm hand for 5:30, wound the clock spring, and placed it back on my nightstand. I prided myself on being on time…a characteristic that was instilled in me from the time I learned to work for my own money.
  
I was an industrious young man of morals and integrity. I had the world by the horns… or so I thought.
  
I put my pajamas on and laid my work clothes out on a chair, then tucked myself in for the night. I must have slept extremely well that night. We’re talking deep R.E.M. sleep. The kind where time seems to no longer exist. Then I had a lucid dream. A very unsettling lucid dream. It went something like this:
  
I’m walking through a door, and there, about 30 to 35 feet in front of me was my boss, Chung, squatting down in front of his vendor stall that was completely set up, with purses and handbags hanging from hooks on the shade structure. His display tables were adorned with colorful tablecloths, loaded with pocketbooks, coin purses and other accessories. 
  
He was straightening a pair of red shoes he had arranged on the tarmac up front. I had missed setup. I was suddenly flushed with the realization that I was late for work. That feeling of pure anxiety washed over me like a bucket of ice cold water.
  
I stood shocked and dumbfounded as Chung looked over his shoulder and spotted me. He nodded his head with a grin and started to speak. But the sound that came out was not that of his voice, but a loud, steady ringing sound. The sound of a bell.
  
Suddenly I was ripped from my dream, and I bolted upright in bed to the sound of my alarm clock going off. It was 5:30 and time to get ready for work. I reached over and turned it off, then rubbed my eyes, anxious with that feeling of being late that lingered with repeating visions from that stupid dream. 
  
I felt like I had just closed my eyes only to be rudely awakened again. I shrugged it off and went to the bathroom to begin my morning ritual for work. 
  
But the dream kept replaying itself over and over in my head like a 10-second video clip stuck on a loop. The finished displays. The red shoes. The grin on Chung’s face. The feeling of being late. And what the hell was he about to say just before my alarm clock jolted me out of it? I just couldn’t shake it despite the fact that I had gotten up on time and there was nothing keeping me from getting to work on time that morning. 
  
Nonetheless, I picked up my pace a little bit just to make sure that dream playing out over and over again, and that feeling of dread that comes with showing up late for work, would just go away.
  
I felt a bit silly as I donned my clothes a little quicker, and tied my old suede wallabies a little faster than I normally would. I slipped my wrist watch on and checked the time against my alarm clock for a match. “This is ludicrous”, I thought to myself. “There’s no way I can be late. If anything I’ll be super early.”
  
I cut the time I would normally spend getting ready to go to work in half by skipping breakfast, and set out on foot at 10 minutes to 6 in the chilly morning darkness toward the Drive-in theater that waited for me about a block and a half away from my house. 
  
The light of dawn wouldn’t break for another half-hour or so. And, as it has been all season, my job was to show up around 6:30 a.m., meet Chung at our usual spot, and we would knock out the setup by 7:00…just in time for the shoppers to be allowed in. 
  
But this time it would be “a little bit different” I thought to myself as I shuffled down my empty street toward the quiet four lane thoroughfare.  Ignoring the crosswalk, I jogged across the thoroughfare toward the main gate of the Drive-in theater with its landmark forty-foot screen looming in the distance. 
  
The dream quickened my pace. I scoffed and fought the urge to break into a run. 
  
It was unusually foggy that morning too. As I made my way through the shadows I couldn’t help but notice the ominous looking halos of swirling mist surrounding each street lamp. The theme song from ‘The Twilight Zone’ kept trying to seep into the cracks in my overactive imagination. 
  
And that damn dream. That dream was still fresh on my mind as I entered the gate and waved at the security guard leaning in the door frame of his guard shack. He recognized me with a nod of his head, his face half-lit by one single incandescent light bulb from within. He pulled the cigarette from his lips with thumb and forefinger and let out a puff of thick, gray smoke. “Here a little early, arencha?” 
  
I shook my head and shoved my hands in my pockets as I thought about how ridiculous it was for me to be here at this hour. There was literally no one there except for the snack bar/café crew in the center of the Drive-in  lot. I headed straight for it. I needed to get my head on straight. I needed a cup of coffee and an old-fashioned glazed donut. 
  
I walked into the café and up to the service counter. The place was completely empty  except for those bleary-eyed workers who were busy doing their morning prep for the coming rush of customers. “Their day starts a lot earlier than mine”, I reckoned as I took in the aroma of fresh coffee and baked goods. 
  
I ordered my cup of coffee and an old-fashioned glazed with a $2 bill, and got two quarters change. I grabbed an Auto Trader magazine from a rack by the entrance and scanned the area for a good place to sit.
  
Through large windows I could see a panoramic view of the outside area. I spotted a booth and sat down from where I had an unobstructed view of our spot. I wanted to see Chung the moment he arrived so I could go out to greet him early. 
  
I felt so foolish as I stirred the sugar and powdered creamer into my cup, and chuckled to myself as I thumbed through the magazine. The dream faded for now, my mind preoccupied by the taste of fresh coffee and the flavor of that old fashioned glazed delicacy. 
  
About halfway through my cup of coffee I glanced at my watch. It was 6:35 (about the time I would normally show up). By now the light of dawn was just beginning to illuminate the cloudless sky, and the fog that had invaded the early morning was gone. 
  
Vendors were rapidly arriving en masse, claiming their spots. The clinking and clanking of their shade structure poles reverberated throughout the Drive-in as the they got busy unloading their vehicles and setting up their vending stalls. 
  
Vendors began filing into the café to get their morning caffeine and sugar fix. I stared blankly at our spot. Empty. Was Chung running late? I knew that his commute was considerably longer. His old cargo van had seen better days. 
  
Something was not right. The spaces on either side of ours were already busy with vendors and their helpers skillfully fastening leg poles to corner pieces, and stretching canvas tarps with bungee cords for shade.
  
I stepped outside to use the payphone that was mounted on the wall next to the restrooms. I figured I’d call Chung at home to see if he was there. But the pay phone had an ‘Out of Order’ sign written in black marker taped across the coin slots. Go figure.
  
Back inside, I bought another cup of coffee with my last 50 cents. “Why not?” If Chung didn’t show up by the time I finished the second cup, I reasoned, then I guess he’d be considered a no-show. 
  
Heck, I could just go home and crawl back into bed for a couple more hours before the rest of my family started to rouse. Godzilla and Kung Fu reruns on Saturday morning. Yes, just what the doctor ordered. 
  
I looked over to our spot again. It was completely vacant, surrounded by a sea of shade structures, tarps, goods, with cargo vans, box trucks, and just about anything you could haul stuff in that had materialized across the tarmac of the Drive-in theater as far as the eye could see. 
  
If you’ve ever been to a swap meet you know what I’m talking about. It was now 7:00. It’s Showtime!
  
“Well, I guess that’s it”, I thought to myself as I stood up and drank the last sip from my coffee cup. Chung is a no-show. That whole dream was such a… well, it was just that…a dream. I was now free to go home and catch some shut eye, and to decompress from an otherwise stressful episode.
  
I headed for the exit on the other side of the now crowded café. Beyond it was my home less than 10 minutes away. 
  
Through the windows on that side I could see the shoppers starting to flow in from the ticket line and fan out through the isles of waiting vendors. 
  
I grabbed the doorknob and pushed it outward, and then I felt a strange rush kind of like 'deja vu' come over me. 
  
“This can’t be…”, I struggled to reason, as I walked out the door and saw…him. It was the dream. Only this time, for real.
  
I gazed in existential horror at Chung who squatted about 30 feet right in front of me. He was straightening a pair of brightly polished red pumps on display on the tarmac…and I was late.
  
My jaw went slack as my coffee cup fell from numb fingers. “Chung?”
  
Chung looked over his shoulder in my direction. He had just finished setting up his stall. Every detail was there from the hanging handbags to the accessory tables and, well…you know the rest.
  
Chung’s gaze met mine; “Oh there you are!” He said with a sheepish grin, “Sorry, I forgot to tell you…I switched spots!”

Looking for a few friends to hopefully get to know each other long term. I’m at that point where I feel 20, but closer to 40. It’s strange 😆 

I’ve met a couple cool people on here. Looking for another friend or two.

I’m pretty much looking for some virtual friends to talk and share about everything in our lives. I’m fine staying on Reddit or using something else. I’m ok with sending each other memes, gifs, pics, videos, whatever. I’ve got nothing to hide here and hoping to make a real friend or two. No we don’t have to give out real names or personally identifiable information. However I’m fine being me, a real person.

To me honesty is a big thing. Major points for that. I’m also excited about life so if you are then that’s another bonus.  I also love people who put effort into communicating. However I understand we do all get busy sometimes and don’t expect immediate responses all the time. Sometimes our schedules line up and other times it doesn’t and that’s cool. 

Some stuff I’m into…running, cycling, lifting weights, kayaking, jump rope, rollerblading, yard work, hiking, anything else outside, constructive projects/working with my hands, a little gaming, board games, coffee shops, exploring new places, cooking, learning new things, meditation and more!!

The Subtext and Savage need a little more work. But I thought I was on to something with the Savage. I started getting some sweetness on the cool down.

I am organising for a group of us from here to grab some drinks Downtown on Saturday evening. I’ve done this before a few times and have made some great friends through doing so, mostly from this sub.

Most of us are in our mid to late 30s and some late 20s, and are from countries all over the world. 

We have all found that this has been a great way to make new friends, the conversation is always flowing and we always have so much fun.

I’ve hosted quite a few of these meet ups - last summer I organised a barbecue, last October I had a potluck at my place, at Christmas I did a friends Christmas get together where I cooked dinner and everyone brought dessert & drinks, and we’ve done quite a few meet ups in bars, restaurants, cafes, and have done cinema nights as well.

If you are interested in joining this weekend (or are reading this later and would like to join in the future), message me and tell me a little about yourself. 😄

Just be a bit patient with my response, the last few times I did this my DMs were flooded and it took a while to respond to them all. 

A bit about me, I’m 38M, really into the gym, K-dramas, travelling, and coffee. Love checking out cafes as well. ",2,1741312453.0,Vancouver4Friends,1,1.0,False

1j5c7km,https://www.reddit.com/r/novelsfree/comments/1j5c7km/name_of_book_anyone/,Name of Book Anyone??,"My own mate rejected me on our wedding night.

As soon as I signed the marriage certificate and prepared to step into our new life together… he rejected me.

“I, Kaden Voss, Alpha of the Nightshade Pack, reject you, Livia Dornell, as my Luna.”

His cruel and cutting words still echo in my mind as if they were spoken just yesterday. But they weren’t—his rejection of our mate bond happened two years ago.

Time wasted…
Time spent as a Luna in name only…
Time devoted to a mate who never wanted me.

I replayed that night over and over again in my mind. What could I have done? Where did I go wrong? Every time, I came up empty. Whenever I asked him, all I received were grunts or silence. So, I stopped asking.

His complete change in character made me feel like our years together in college were nothing but a dream.

An illusion.

Our mate bond feels non-existent.
That’s a lie.
It exists, but he refuses to acknowledge it.
He avoids me, never allowing himself to be alone in a room with me, as if I repulse him.

I hate this bond.
The way my heart still races when he enters a room…
The lingering scent of charcoal and leather on the furniture…
His dark hair, his powerful Alpha frame, and those silver eyes that once captivated me…

I hate it all.

For an entire year after our wedding, Kaden barely looked at me. He buried himself in pack affairs, using them as an excuse to stay away.

But I tried.
I tried to fix whatever I thought I had broken.
I wanted to make our marriage work.

Then… I learned the truth.

Selena.

The woman he loved. The one he never let go of.
The reason he never gave our bond a chance.

I don’t know who she is or where she came from.
All I know is that she was in a coma and Kaden never moved on.

That’s when I stopped trying.
I gave up.

Because how could I ever compete with a love so powerful that it could defy the will of the Moon Goddess herself?

I haven’t seen Kaden in two weeks.

Rumors say he’s been by Selena’s bedside night and day.
Freya, the only friend I have in this pack, told me she’s showing signs of waking up.

Something inside me has felt off lately. A deep, unsettling feeling has taken root. So, when Kaden was too preoccupied to notice my absence, I secretly took a pregnancy test.

I’ve been standing in the bathroom for twenty minutes, unable to pick it up from the sink.

What if I am?

What would that mean in this sick, twisted love triangle?

""Come on, Livia. You’re not alone. We can do this together.""
My wolf urges me, trying to give me courage.

With a deep breath, I force myself to check the result.

Two lines.

My eyes widen, my hand flies to my mouth.

""Two lines… that’s good, right? That means negative?"" my wolf asks hopefully.

I check the box again.

""No… two lines means…""

""Positive.""

What am I going to do?

I kept the test by my bedside all night. I barely slept.
I checked it over and over again, hoping I had misread it.

I hate him.
But this child… this child is still his.
Still the heir to the pack.

I have to tell him.

At dawn, I make my way to the Alpha estate.

But as I approach the front garden, I see Kaden stepping out with Beta Rylan.

For some reason, I duck behind a tree.

""Why not wait until Selena wakes up to have a child?""

""We need an heir now to secure the pack’s future.""

""But what if Livia gets pregnant? And Selena wakes up?""

Kaden’s next words shatter whatever hope I had left.

""Simple. The child is mine.""

""And Livia?""

""If Selena wakes up, her kidneys will be damaged beyond repair. Livia will be the donor. She won’t have a choice. The doctors already know what to do.""

My ears ring, blocking out the rest of their conversation.

I was never his mate.
I was never meant to be his Luna.
I was just a spare organ.

I have to leave.

Selena is expected to wake up any day now.

Which means my time is up.

I had planned my escape for a few days later, but now, I can’t afford to wait.

Midnight. Under the cover of darkness, I slip away.

I avoid the guards, sticking to the shadows. But as I take a shortcut past the training field, my worst fear is realized—Kaden is there.

He’s training with a warrior.

I duck behind a tree, holding my breath.

His sharp gaze scans the area.

""Livia?"" His voice is suspicious. I feel him pushing on our mind-link.

I stay completely still.

I make it seem like I’m asleep.

After a moment, he turns back, resuming his training.

I exhale shakily and change my route.

When I finally reach the gates, I wait for the right moment to slip through.

But then…

""Where are you going?""

I whirl around. Kaden.

There’s a smirk on his face.

Did he think this was funny?

""I’m leaving,"" I say firmly. ""I won’t stay here any longer.""

He takes a step forward, but a warrior interrupts.

""Alpha, Beta Rylan says you need to return to the hospital—immediately.""

""Not now,"" Kaden snaps.

""He says… Selena is awake.""

Kaden hesitates. He glances at me for the briefest second before turning and walking away.

This is my chance.

I don’t look back.

I run.

By the time dawn breaks, I’ve reached the nearest city.

I know Kaden has already sent warriors to track me, but I manage to slip into a small café to rest.

I’m exhausted. My feet ache. My throat is dry.

I have no mate. No pack. And a baby on the way.

What do I do now?

""You’re not from around here,"" the silver-haired café owner says, refilling my coffee. ""Which pack are you from?""

""I’m looking for someone,"" I answer cautiously.

""Who?""

""The Crescent Fang Pack.""

His eyes narrow slightly. ""What business do you have there?""

""I’m trying to track someone down. Do you have a map?""

The old man doesn’t answer. Instead, I see his eyes glaze over—he’s mind-linking someone.

I don’t get a chance to ask who.

The café bell chimes.

And suddenly, the air shifts.

A scent hits me—dark spices and citrus.

My mouth goes dry. My wolf stirs.

I turn slowly…

And there he is.

A towering man with golden eyes burning into mine.

I've scaled things to the best that I can using this program, measurements may not be super accurate though. I'd like to keep the head of my bed near the window (the white line on the top wall) because sunlight in the morning helps me wake up. Though I'm aware with both the window and the door, its not the best position.

For a better description of what things are: The brown thing in between the bed and the door is a desk with a hutch. The brown thing on the top wall next to my bed is a bookshelf (its only one bookshelf but program wouldn't let me do that, but it takes up that full space). The orange block is a fridge, with a microwave and coffee maker on top. The tan part next to it is kitchen storage. The red block is a lounge chair. Also, there is an in-wall closet that takes up most of the middle space of the long wall (there's a gray and black line that indicates this). The bed probably won't fit rotated and still be able to open the door. On the door, there is also a mirror (its a part of the dorm room and I cant move it).

Any thoughts? I'd love some feedback! Thanks!

Last weekend I had occasion to go to lunch at a local coffee shop with a female friend. They had left me to do a little shopping leaving me alone at my table to enjoy the environment along with my coffee.
I noticed that the table next to mine had become occupied by a man casually but neatly dressed in his mid sixties. 
I am discrete but I love men older than myself, so mid sixties tops get my heart racing. It wasn’t a big deal but I couldn’t see a wedding ring so that set my gaydar pinging, which in turn had me glancing in his direction almost as a reflex action. No big deal.
Then to my total surprise I noticed he kept glancing back at me in acknowledgment which was a total thrill. I know that sounds rather juvenile but that eye locking moment is such a turn on.
After a few minutes he leaned over and said that I should read the book he was reading as he thought I would enjoy it.
Am I crazy here was this darling with a deep sexy voice chatting with me, maybe even flirting with me? Surely not.
Now I am not unattractive but at this stage of my life I had assumed such moments were a fantasy.
We chatted for about five minutes with me on cloud nine with me wondering where this conversation could take us.
Alas my friend returned and I had to depart, plus I suspect he must have assumed I was straight at that point and he had perhaps gotten his wires crossed. He hadn’t.
As I left he made eye contact with me one more time and bid me a lovely day. I am sure he knew what I was thinking. I have been rethinking it time and again all week.

For a while I used an Orlon filter bag with a few pre-filters inside. I would dampen them to reduce absorption of good syrup. But it would take forever; the filters would quickly clog and the syrup would cool, making the filtering go on for what felt like an eternity. 

Instead, I recommend buying two pots, one of which you will have to cut the bottom out. In the second picture you can see that I cut out perforated metal sheeting to replace the bottom. In this pot I place the Orlon fabric and pre-filters to go over it. I just recently bought a flat 36”x36” piece of Orlon from eBay for about $20. For the pre-filters I ended up just cutting out pieces from pre-filters I had laying around. The syrup is dumped into this pot, and filters into the second pot underneath. The first photo shows this setup. The other key thing here is I fitted a spout from an old coffee urn. This allows me to pour filtered syrup into bottles as the syrup is still hot, and while remaining syrup is being filtered.  Another thing to consider (though certainly not necessary) is the fitting seen pictured in the second pot. This allows me to hook up a shop vacuum; I really just use this towards the end of the process to help suck through whatever remaining syrup is trapped in the filters.

But I think the key takeaway here is filtering into a container with a flat bottom. My theory why the Orlon bag never worked well for me is the syrup is forced to filter through a small point at the bottom. Because everything is passing through a tiny area, it quickly clogs. By filtering with flat material, the syrup is more evenly distributed and therefore doesn’t clog as easily. 

There’s quite a few videos out there detailing similar setups, so I don’t want to take credit for this. Just modified it to work with materials I had around. But I will say, this method works rather well. I was able to filter and simultaneously bottle about 2 gallons of syrup in about 10 minutes. Syrup was clear, and was bottled hot, it barely lost any heat during filtration.

I’m also by no means an expert on this subject. I just wanted to share because I know how difficult the filtering process can be.",2,1741311453.0,maplesyrup,4,1.0,False

1j5c0ma,https://www.reddit.com/r/reactivedogs/comments/1j5c0ma/dog_attacking_other_dog_new_behavior/,Dog attacking other dog New Behavior,"My 5 year old husky mix was a feral street dog from Texas before we adopted her.  We've had her for 4 years and have spent a lot of money reprogramming her feralness out of her. The rescue lied to us about how feral she was. She is now 99% good dog with a little bit of unpredictability still in her.  

Around Christmas this year she started attacking my pitbull who thankfully did not retaliate as he outweighs her by 30 pounds. This was happening mostly while we were all on the couch at the end of the night.  We restricted couch time and slowly reintroduced it after a week. The behavior stopped when we put the Christmas tree away.  She had never attacked a other dog unprovoked before this. 

Flashforward to 3 days ago and she started up again. We restricted couch time for both of them (the pitbull is acting like we don't live him currently).  Today it happened twice.  I was sitting on the couch and they were on the floor hoping that they would be able to come up on the couch. Out of the blue. She attacked him. Thankfully nobody was hurt. This evening while we were eating dinner at the coffee table before my husband had to go back to work and we had finished eating, she attacked him again completely unprovoked.  We placed her in her playpen before cooling off because she was still acting out. She is now joined the general population again and is fine. 

I am not sure to do about this because the videos I've seen state  to reintroduce them in low stress areas and prevent situations that will induce this behavior. Problem is, I have no idea when this is going to happen because we're all chilling out and then she lashes out  attacks him .. I am reaching out to my trainer again but am looking for advice. 

Giving her up or anything else is not an option.

Never in my days of working nightshifts have I had such a problem staying up as I do now.

Has anyone else dealt with this? I had pretty strong coffee before I fell asleep, and I just bought 2 cases of redbull while I was ""relocating"" to an area with better signal a few minutes ago.

Long story short, I started with chest pain and all that when I was like 14, and then I started getting PVCs. I've had all the tests outside of an MRI on my heart - stress, echo, holter, etc. I was told go live my life I'm fine.

Fast forward to April 2021, I got the J&J shot and that night had like a 180bpm heart beat. Went to the hospital and said I'm just having a bad reaction. Few days later, I didn't feel right and felt like impending doom so went back to the hospital. Next thing I know i feel my heart turn on like a light switch awhile also the loudest alarms going off. They said I had a short run of NSVT and they were keeping me. Overnight, I had several runs of Supra Ventricular Tachycardia. I saw the doctor next morning and he said he couldn't find the telemetry from NSVT but likely just had SVT with aberrancy. The doctor said it seems I have dysautonomia and it's why my heart reacted the way it did to the J&J shot. He put me on a low dose beta blocker and sent me on my way.

About 8 months ago, I was in the shower after a hard work out with a Zyn in (I'm dumb, I know) and felt that lightswitch heart thing again. Lasted maybe 5 seconds. Freaked me the hell out.

Today, I had a massive chipotle bowl, drank another big cold brew coffee, was really mad about something that happened and was leaning back in my chair where I felt it again. After coughing 3 or 4 times it went away. Both times I'm guessing was NSVT

It just has me a bit freaked out when this happens. How do I regulate my dysautonomia and make it go away? How do I prevent NSVT happening again?

1j5bxhy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1j5bxhy/almost_everyone_i_know_thinks_im_lazy_and_entitled/,Almost everyone I know thinks I'm lazy and entitled,"I understand why. From an outside perspective my life looks really cushy and my behavior must make it look like I don't have a care in the world. I only work three days a week. My husband and I make enough money to easily maintain a modest lifestyle. I don't have kids and I have no family around so no real responsibilities outside of my job. I have a Master's Degree and a high earning potential. I'm relatively young and look fairly healthy. 

On workdays, I breeze in around 10:30 with a breakfast burrito and a coffee in hand. Sometimes I work a full day until 6:30 or so but usually I don't have enough work to keep me there that long. I often fall short of people's expectations at work, sometimes because of misconceptions about my profession and sometimes because I'm just the easiest person to blame. Most of the people I work with are full-time and have a specific shift they need to show up and stay for, while I just show up when I'm ready and leave when I'm done. 

On days I don't work, I sleep until 10 or 11 or sometimes later. When I wake up I stretch for a few hours, read, lay around, etc. I do 90% of the cooking and cleaning in my home so I'll give myself that. 

I don't consistently answer my family's calls/texts. I'm not there for them in a way they expect me to be. I'm aloof with my immediate community including neighbors and my husband's friends. I don't really have my own friends except for a few scattered around the country (no one within 2k miles or so).

My own truth (and it's okay if others don't accept it) is that I've been too debilitated by physical/mental health problems to properly engage with life over the last 10-ish years. I've had ""health issues"" since about 2016, including very vague, hand-wavey symptoms such as fatigue, nausea and muscle/joint pain. At first these issues were only sometimes debilitating, but over the years have increasingly limited my engagement/participation in life. I haven't been able to work fulltime since 2021ish. I was recently diagnosed with thyroid disease, which may explain a lot of my problems. But I'm well aware that, in most people's minds, having an underactive thyroid isn't enough to absolve me from years of underworking and underperforming, neglecting myself and my relationships, etc.. 

For one thing I don't look sick unless you know what you're looking for. When I look at myself I see thinning hair, huge bags and dark circles under my eyes and a swollen face/jaw/throat. I'm overweight and my skin is dry/dull/flaky. But those are also things that come from aging and hard living, so I think people generally just assume I'm older than I am or that I don't take good care of myself. I'm pushing 40 atm, so people LOVE reminding me that I'm aging, that I should expect aches/pains, that menopause is looming, etc.

I've also had mental health problems my whole life, but  just  depression/anxiety/ADHD/CPTSD, no mania/psychosis or anything like that. So there's nothing that should stop me from working or having a normal life, at least not on paper. I had what I describe as a ""complicated"" childhood. I was housed and fed and my parents attended all my dance recitals and all that. My mom had severe depression/alcoholism and so I have some issues around that, but it's not like I was abused or severely neglected. 

After all, I ended up highly educated! I think people assume I'm privileged for that but the truth is I'm just  in a TON of debt. No one helped me pay for shit, I just make bad choices lol. My coworkers love to razz me about being an over-educated egghead, and how fucking stupid it is that I spent tens of thousands of dollars on my education. I agree with them, but they keep razzin' and all I can do is be a good sport about it. 

Anyway, I know that no one owes me anything and I should just be thankful I don't have to work as hard as other people. I'm grateful that my upbringing gave me the confidence to pursue higher education, if not the financial prowess to understand what I was getting into. I'm grateful that I found a partner who is willing to take care of me through my illness/disability. My therapists tell me they're shocked by how much I've achieved in life considering the obstacles I've faced. 

Most people in my life remain unimpressed. I really do feel bad about myself and my choices in life, but I get that when people bitch at me, they're not looking for an explanation, they're just venting. It probably wouldn't make them feel any better to know how much I hate myself. They just want to vent like I'm venting. ",1,1741311006.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

* I read novels mostly in historical settings
* I play 1 computer game: Genshin Impact on daily basis for the last 2+ years. It's my comfort game, but...I cannot explain to you the deep lore

* I am learning to draw and trying to find time to practice
* I enjoy the ambient sound of rain & soft thunder, turning pages of a book, scratching pencil, or keyboard typing
* I love drinking bubble tea or milk tea or milk coffee, but does not enjoy tea/coffee/milk on its own
* While I don't have pets, I like watching videos of animals that are considered calm / low energy like panda, sloth, koala

So, I have one last summer to work from anywhere in the U.S., and I want to make it count. Ive been to the Sierras 15+ times as they my favorite mountain range so want to do as many hikes there this Spring and Summer. Ideally to pick the town based on the trails I want to do.

Typically, I bounce around the country in Airbnbs, hiking on weekends, but this time I want to fully immerse myself in hiking, including after work. I get off at 4 PM local time, so I'd a place where I can step outside (or drive max 30-40 minutes) and be on an epic trail. I think the obvious answer is Mammoth? But ideally would be a little more secluded and more in nature. Think cabin in the woods Walden Pond type.

If I had my choice, I would do a starlink setup so I could work from whenever, but thats not an option because It may be hard to work out of my Subaru Outback all day. Something ive done before is tent camp in the mountains, drive 20-30 mins to a city and work from a coworking or coffee shop, but its hard working 8 hours in a coffee shop. I once stayed just north of Anchorage, AK, and it was amazing—secluded, great hiking right outside, 10-11 PM sunsets, and weekend backpacking within a few hours’ drive. That’s the vibe I’m going for, but somewhere different this time.

I was thinking in:

**April/May**: A town on the western side. So I can hit Yosemite on the weekends. Ive driven through some of them but not familiar them and if there is nice hiking nearby in May. Some ive read are Sonora, Twin Harte, Groveland, Oakhurst, Big Trees, Sierra City, Nevada City, Etc

**Mid June-July:** Id think a town more toward the eastern side may be ideal for the bigger hikes. I think this would depend on which backpacking trips I want to do and the quality of some shorter hikes that I can do from 4-8pm on weekdays. I was thinking Tahoe or North of there but may be 3-4 hours from the weekend backpacking trips that I may want to do in the middle Sierra potentially. But I have not explored Tahoe or North of it so not sure how they compare. Also open to Sequoia and Kings canyon backcountry ones.

We have done a lot of stuff in the city together. Things we’ve done include ROM, MOCA, McMichael, numerous patios, lunches at swanky spots and dives,downtown and suburbs, coffee shop hopping, travels to Creemore, Niagara/wine area, Woodbine beach, a bunch of parks. 

I am now looking for something that can be done last minute and is somewhat fun.  The goal is to spend time together so we can speak and catch up. Basically, movies aren’t interactive enough.  Sporty things are fine but difficult to arrange sometimes. 

We may go tomorrow or Tuesday. Or after. Toronto island on a nice day would be fun, not with the current weather. That goes for most stuff outside.  

I like to learn a new skill or appreciate something that I don’t get to in my regular day to day. Spas seem nice but too hard to find anything last minute or close to being affordable. I’d be open to any suggestions.  Basically during the day only - anytime in between 10-5. We can drive, can be downtown where I am, Mississauga where she is or 1.5 in any direction.  

Looking for experiences. Not seeking instagram worthy photos. I told her I’d start planning some things and I have a lunch reservation available or may drive to Elora but I am thinking that we will want to do something else.

1j5bgzf,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SophiaShay7/comments/1j5bgzf/mast_cell_activation_syndrome_mcas/,Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS),"Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) is the most common form of systemic Mast Cell Disease and is known to cause Dysautonomia in some but not all patients.

A histamine dump happens when your body produces too much histamine that builds up in the brain. Histamine dumps often happen late at night or early in the morning. You might suddenly feel changes in body temperature, itchiness, or blood pressure changes as your histamine levels rise.

Histamine, serotonin, and dopamine are all neurotransmitters that play a role in regulating sleep-wake cycles and helping the brain transition from sleep to wakefulness. 

Have you considered Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS)?       
                                                                        
●Your allergist/Immunologist can diagnose Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) by considering a patient's symptom history, physical exam, and lab tests. A diagnosis is appropriate if symptoms are recurrent, accompanied by increased mast cell-derived chemical mediators, and responsive to treatment. 

●Blood or urine tests.                                                 
These tests can measure mast cell mediators, such as tryptase, histamine, or prostaglandins, which increase during an episode. However, tryptase levels can be elevated in other conditions, so levels alone don't indicate MCAS. A patient should be tested multiple times, both when feeling well and during an episode.                                                                      

●Other factors that may be considered include:              
○An allergy skin test or allergy blood tests to rule out other causes of symptoms.                                          
○A trial of treatment using inhibitors of mast cell mediators, such as antihistamines or other drugs that block chemicals released by mast cells.                  

>H1 and H2 histamine receptors are two main classes of histamine receptors that are involved in many different bodily functions:                                             

>●H1 histamine receptors.                                                   
These receptors are found in many tissues, including immune cells, smooth muscle, and endothelium. They play a role in regulating vasodilation, bronchoconstriction, and atrial muscle contractility. H1 receptors are also involved in cellular migration and nociception. Antihistamines that bind to H1 receptors are often used to treat allergies and allergic rhinitis, such as hives, itchy skin, itchy eyes, runny nose, and sneezing.  

>Commonly used H1 antagonists currently available in the United States are cetirizine, levocetirizine, desloratadine, loratadine, and fexofenadine.                                                   

>●H2 histamine receptors.                                                  
These receptors are mainly found in gastric parietal cells but are also present in vascular smooth muscle, neutrophils, suppressor T cells, the CNS, and the heart. H2 receptors are primarily involved in stimulating gastric acid secretion, which is closely linked to the development of peptic ulcers. H2 receptors also modify airway mucus production and vascular permeability. Antihistamines that bind to H2 receptors are often used to treat upper gastrointestinal conditions caused by excessive stomach acid, such as gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) and peptic ulcers. 

>Commonly used H2 antagonists currently available in the United States are cimetidine, famotidine
and nizatidine.

>Mast cell stabilizers are medications that can help treat a range of symptoms by limiting calcium flow across the mast cell membrane. This prevents the release of vasoactive substances and degranulation. 
Mast cell stabilizers are often prescribed in combination with histamine blockers. 

>Some examples of mast cell stabilizers include: 
●Cromolyn.                                                                         
Also known as cromoglicic acid, this is considered the prototypical mast cell stabilizer. It can be taken orally to treat gastrointestinal issues, or inhaled as a nasal spray or through a nebulizer to treat lung or nasal problems.

Some medications that can trigger Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) symptoms include: 
opioids, antibiotics, NSAIDs, such as aspirin or ibuprofen, alcohol-containing medicines, intravenous vancomycin, neuromuscular junction blocking agents, 
and local anesthetics. 

There is no cure for MCAS, but treatments can help manage symptoms. These include avoiding triggers, taking medications that block chemicals released by mast cells, managing stress levels, speaking with a mental health professional, and having self-injectable epinephrine at all times. 

If your Allergist is unable to perform the necessary tests, you may need a referral to an Immunologist.

I would research H1 and H2 histamine blockers. There are plenty that are available over the counter. It's recommended to take double the normal dose. Split these dosages to morning and evening. Many people have recommended cetirizine or Xyzol for H1 and famotidine for H2.

My symptoms didn't completely line up with MCAS either. My symptoms have continued to get worse with dry, itchy, and watery eyes and reactions to certain foods after eating. I started drinking my favorite hazelnut coffee i haven't had in nine months because I switched brands. Now I'm having MCAS symptoms. I'm itchy, sneezing, and have a runny nose after eating or drinking things that don't agree with me. I'm allergic to the fillers in my thyroid medication.
I started the MCAS protocol. I'm taking Cetirizine for H1 and Famotidine for H2. Morning and night. It worsened my tachycardia and Dysautonomia symptoms. I took one dose per day. I had to stop. I take Fluticasone and Hydroxyzine for MCAS now.

Or is it possible you have celiac or have a gluten intolerance? Ask for a referral to a rheumatologist. They'll evaluate you for autoimmune diseases. I hope you find some answers. Hugs❤️",1,1741309638.0,u_SophiaShay7,0,1.0,False

Imagine studying machine learning while trying not to ponder if those grades are secretly being curated by a digital overlord. Yes, the College of Information Sciences and Technology is leading the charge with a shiny new Bachelor of Science in Artificial Intelligence Methods and Applications (AIMA), kicking off in Fall 2025.

**Why All the AI Hype?**
AI is not just a tech trend; it's the new espresso shot for the global economy, with a mix of ethical responsibility and earth-shattering potential. Dean Andrea Tapia puts it this way: the demand for tech-savvy wizards who can navigate AI like they’re piloting the Millennium Falcon is through the roof. This program promises to mold students into AI pioneers, equipped to handle complex, real-world challenges with nothing more than a keyboard and a coffee IV.

**AITM Isn’t Just Another Acronym**
With heavy hitters like the Nittany AI Alliance and the Center for Socially Responsible Artificial Intelligence in its corner, the college isn't playing around. Almost half of IST professors are already knee-deep in AI research, maybe deciphering if AI can predict the next viral cat video or something equally world-changing.

**Joining the Heavyweights**
By introducing AIMA, Penn State isn't just keeping pace—they're racing alongside icons like Carnegie Mellon and MIT. Students will immerse in machine learning and generative AI, learning how to keep the digital revolution both exciting and ethically responsible.

**The Big Question**
So, future AI maestros, as you prepare to dive into a program designed to stir innovation, here's something to ponder: With AI becoming our digital pillow, are we really shaping its future, or is it already writing ours? Your thoughts—or conspiracy theories—are welcome in the comments. 🧐✨",1,1741309232.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

A bit about me: I’m originally from the East Coast, grew up just outside the city in Connecticut, and spent my adult years in New York City (mostly Manhattan and Queens). For the past 3 years, I’ve been in LA, living on the West Side, Los Feliz, and Highland Park. But honestly, I’ve always felt a bit drawn to Long Beach.

Out of all the places I’ve visited, Belmont Shores really stands out to me. Whenever I’m there, it just feels like my vibe. I enjoy the walkability and access to restaurants, bars, coffee shops etc… The question is: is it a good place to settle down? For those familiar with the area, will I feel too isolated living there, or does it have enough community and connection? Will being here leave me completely disconnected from the rest of LA or would it maybe be like living deep in Brooklyn or Queens? Let me know your thoughts!!

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",4,1741308725.0,longbeach,34,0.67,False
1j5b5mo,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1j5b5mo/sound_design_in_daredevil_born_again/,Sound design in Daredevil: Born Again,"I want to preface by saying I’m liking the show so far and Daredevil is by far my favorite superhero.

I just watched the first two episodes of Daredevil: Born Again. So far it’s going just fine imo, but I can’t help but notice the very weird sound design in a lot of scenes. It may appear nitpicky, but when watching with headphones it’s very notorious

The audio feels actually weird in scenes when 2 characters are having a conversation. The background noise is non existent, like when Karen and Matt have a discussion in the courthouse, when in the diner with Fisk or in the coffee shop on the first date, both trials or scenes in the street (aside from the hole scene, when you could hear people talking and cars).

Also a lot of times the voices are mixed way to loud and way to close, almost as asmr level. It’s not always, but some times. This, plus the lack of background noise, makes some scenes really awkward and off putting, breaking the immersion. The courtroom scenes felt like the room was empty for example. Compare it with court scenes from the original show. There is background noise and you can hear that there is more people, even when everyone’s mostly quiet. Or compare it with scenes from the wire (which has a really great background sound design throughout the whole show) or better call saul.

This is my only major complaint so far, aside from Matt being much less fleshed out than in the original series (at least so far), which could be attributed to the fast pace. But I kinda miss the confession scenes.

Does anyone feel this way? Or is it just me?",6,1741308698.0,marvelstudios,1,0.88,False
