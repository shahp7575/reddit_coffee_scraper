1j9w1pb,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/1j9w1pb/can_tung_oil_be_used_to_finish_a_coffee_mug/,Can tung oil be used to finish a coffee mug?,"Hello! I am planning on making a wooden mug from which I‚Äôd like to drink hot liquids that contain sugar and dairy. I am trying to figure out how to finish it. 
I understand kuksas were originally made to drink coffee and would be largely unfinished except for allowing it to sit in boiling salt water when drying. However, I am afraid that the milk or sugar could contaminate the pores of the wood without the presence of a finish and harbor bacteria/mold.
I understand most oils and finishes may not be able to withstand high heat liquids or just leech out into the liquids on their own regardless of the temperature, but I noticed that tung oil seems to be heat resilient. One source I read said that its thermal stability started to break only after 200 degrees Celsius. In contention, I‚Äôve seen some people on forums say tung oil would not be able to withstand repeated exposure to coffee temperatures.

So, assuming a drink that is around 140F/60C, would tung oil be a suitable finish for a wooden mug?",1,1741816760.0,woodworking,1,1.0,False

For the uncountable time I'm let down by businesses here who, for want of a better term, don't seem to give an absolute f**k. They either don't work Mondays, go home early on Fridays, too busy to pick up the phone, never ring you back, can't quote, can't deliver or any other excuse known to man. 

Example. I'm looking to get items laser cut in stainless steel. I contact all the 5 or 6 businesses in N.I. that do such a thing. One of them got back to me 3 or 4 weeks later. The others, nothing. 

One company in Sheffield got back to me within minutes and they got the job. The one company here then get pissy with me for pointing this out rather than apologising for their inadequacies.

Meetings, people don't show up, say they've mistaken the date or got mixed up. People turning up late with a coffee in their hand from the local cafe. 

Restaurants with staff who you seriously feel you're bothering them when you ask for the bill or are ready to order. The list goes on and on and on. 

And it's not just me, my jib or the cut of it. Others frequently get it too. Decorators not turning up, quotes all wrong, even funeral directors that can't do a simple thing like an invoice.

Chip shops with food you wouldn't give a dog, buses stinking, streets in appalling state of litter, empty shop fronts boarded up, dog sh*t on the street. 

People just either have given up trying it the workforce is just so lazy. I don't get it but whenever something good happens or service is decent it's the exception.

## The Allure of the Five Dollar Yoga Mat: Why the Hype?

Five Below has carved a niche for itself by offering trendy and useful products at incredibly low prices. The **five below yoga mat** is a prime example of this strategy. The initial draw is, of course, the price tag. For budget-conscious consumers, the idea of snagging a yoga mat for around $5 (prices may slightly vary) is incredibly appealing. This accessibility makes yoga and fitness more approachable for a wider range of people.

## A Deep Dive: What You Get for Your Five Dollars

Let's get into the nitty-gritty. What can you realistically expect from a **cheap yoga mat** that costs less than your morning coffee? Here's a breakdown of the key features and characteristics:

*   **Material:** Typically made of EVA foam (ethylene-vinyl acetate).EVA foam is a common material in budget-friendly mats due to its low cost and lightweight nature.
*   **Thickness:** Generally quite thin. Most Five Below yoga mats are around 5mm thick,although some **Series-8 Fitness‚Ñ¢ 8mm extra thick yoga & exercise mat** are available. While 5mm is standard in some mats, the quality of the EVA foam at this price point doesn't provide the same level of cushioning or support as higher-end materials.
*   **Texture:** Usually features a textured surface to provide some grip. However, the effectiveness of this texture can vary, and some users might find it slippery, especially during sweaty practices.
*   **Size:** Standard yoga mat size, typically around 24 inches wide and 68 inches long. This is generally sufficient for most basic poses and exercises.
*   **color and Design:** Often available in various colors, including trendy options like **pink yoga mat** and **purple yoga mat**. Some mats may feature basic printed designs or patterns.
*   **Portability:** Lightweight and easy to roll up, making it reasonably **portable yoga mat**. However,it usually doesn't come with a carrying strap or bag,so you might need to provide your own.

## Performance Review: Does it Hold Up?

Now, let's evaluate the five Below yoga mat based on its performance in various aspects:

*   **Comfort and Cushioning:** This is where the mat typically falls short. The thin EVA foam provides minimal cushioning, which can be uncomfortable for sensitive joints, especially during kneeling or balancing poses. If you have knee issues or prefer a more padded surface, this might not be the best choice. If possible consider testing a **thick yoga mat** for comfort depending on the type of exercise.
*   **Grip and Stability:** The textured surface aims to provide grip,but its effectiveness can be inconsistent. In dry conditions, it might be adequate for basic poses.However, in humid environments or during sweaty workouts, the mat can become slippery, increasing the risk of slipping and injury. Choosing a **non-slip yoga mat** can be the key to an effective workout, but the Five Below one typically requires caution.
*   **Durability:** Considering the price, the durability is understandably limited. The EVA foam is prone to tearing, stretching, and compression, which can shorten the lifespan of the mat. Heavy use and improper storage can further accelerate wear and tear.
*   **Hygiene:** EVA foam is generally easy to clean with mild soap and water. However,the porous nature of the material means it can absorb sweat and odors over time if not cleaned regularly.
*   **Suitability for Different Yoga Styles:** This mat is best suited for gentle,low-impact yoga styles like Hatha or restorative yoga. It's less ideal for more dynamic and demanding styles like Vinyasa or Ashtanga, which require better grip and cushioning.

## Who is the Five Below Yoga Mat ideal For?

Despite its limitations, the Five Below yoga mat can be a suitable option for certain individuals:

*   **Beginners:** If you're just starting out with yoga and want to try it without a significant investment, this mat can be a good entry point. It allows you to explore the practice without financial pressure.
*   **Occasional Users:** If you only practice yoga occasionally or need a mat for light stretching or home workouts, this mat might suffice.
*   **Travelers:** Its lightweight and portable design makes it a convenient option for travel, especially if you don't want to risk damaging a more expensive mat. Be mindful if you plan on purchasing **bulk yoga mats**.
*   **Those on a Tight Budget:** If you're genuinely struggling financially and can't afford a more expensive mat, this is a better alternative than practicing on a hard floor.

## When to look for Alternatives: Red Flags to Consider

Though, there are situations where investing in a higher-quality yoga mat is essential:

*   **Joint Pain or Injuries:** if you have existing knee, wrist, or back pain, a thicker and more supportive mat is crucial to prevent further discomfort or injury.
*   **Regular Practice:** If you practice yoga frequently (several times a week or more), a durable and comfortable mat will substantially enhance your experience and prevent premature wear and tear.
*   **Sweaty Practices:** If you tend to sweat a lot during workouts, a non-slip mat made of moisture-wicking materials is essential for safety and stability.
*   **Specific Yoga Styles:** For demanding yoga styles like hot yoga, Vinyasa, or power yoga, you'll need a mat that can provide adequate grip, cushioning, and support.

## Exploring Alternatives: Beyond the Five Dollar Threshold

If the Five Below yoga mat doesn't meet your needs, don't despair! Plenty of affordable and high-quality alternatives are available. Here are a few factors to consider when exploring other options:

*   **material:** Look for mats made of natural rubber, TPE (thermoplastic elastomer), or microfiber. These materials offer better grip, durability, and eco-friendliness compared to EVA foam.*   **Thickness:** choose a thickness that suits your needs and preferences. 5-6mm is a good balance of cushioning and stability for most practices. For extra cushioning, consider mats that are 8mm or thicker.
*   **Texture:** opt for a mat with a textured surface that provides a reliable grip, even when wet.*   **Brand Reputation:** Research different brands and read reviews to get an idea of their quality and performance.
*   **Price:** Set a budget and compare prices across different retailers. You can frequently enough find decent quality mats in the $20-$40 range.

**Alternative Shopping Locations:**
If your primary goal is still to purchase the mat by the least expensive methods,consider purchase from **five below near me yoga mat** using digital shopping and delivery services.
Consider places which facilitate **online yoga mat purchase** and delivery like Instacart.[[Explore Top Rated five below yoga mat on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/foam-roller/?kw=five below yoga mat)
## Where to Buy: In-Store vs. Online

The **buy five below yoga mat** decision often comes down to convenience. You can purchase Five Below yoga mats either in-store or online. Buying in-store allows you to physically inspect the mat and get a feel for its texture and thickness. However, the selection may be limited depending on the store's inventory.

Ordering **five below yoga mat online** offers a wider selection and the convenience of shopping from home. However, you won't be able to physically examine the mat before purchasing. Also, consider the shipping costs, which could negate some of the savings. Before completing your purchase, you may wish to search **five blow yoga mat stock** at your closest store.

## Tips for Making Your Five Below Yoga Mat Last

*   **Clean it Regularly:** Wipe down the mat after each use with a damp cloth and mild soap.Allow it to air dry wholly before rolling it up.
*   **Store it Properly:** Store the mat in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and heat. Avoid folding it, as this can create creases and weaken the material.
*   **Avoid Harsh Chemicals:** Don't use harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the EVA foam.
*   **Rotate it:** If you tend to use the same spot on the mat, rotate it regularly to distribute wear evenly.
*   **Consider a yoga Towel:** Use a yoga towel on top of the mat during sweaty practices to improve grip and absorb moisture.

## The Verdict: Worth it or Not?

So, is the **Five Below yoga mat** worth the five bucks? The answer, as with most things, is nuanced. It depends on your individual needs, priorities, and expectations.

*   **If you're a beginner on a tight budget and only plan to practice occasionally,it can be a decent starting point.**
*   **However, if you're serious about yoga, have joint pain, or sweat heavily during workouts, investing in a higher-quality mat is a worthwhile investment in your health and well-being.**

Ultimately, the best yoga mat is one that provides you with comfort, stability, and support, allowing you to focus on your practice and reap its many benefits. Don‚Äôt be afraid to explore different options and find the mat that best suits your individual needs and budget.

I don't have a gym membership and don't plan on getting one but I do incline walking/running at the hiking trail near me at least 4 times a week. I do have some weights here at home and I just read that resistance training helps with weight loss a lot so Im wondering if I should incorporate it into my routine? and how? 

Also wanted to ask about coffee consumption. I drink a latte about 2x a day, usually just doing a shot of espresso with milk and some creamer. rn using the brown sugar oat creamer from trader joes but I'm a fan of nutpods bc of the simple ingredients they use. is this affecting my goals though? usually its the only sweet thing I would have in a day.

I'm now debating about changing the itinerary to fly into Auckland then straight away to Queenstown, spend 1 week there, then fly to Sydney and spend the last week there. Things to consider, pro/cons for either?

I would be traveling with a close friend, both our first time to AUS or NZ. We like nature, gentle hikes, beaches, cultural experiences, animals/wildlife, restaurants, and coffee shops. My main concern is moving too quickly through any of the places and not doing them enough justice. On one hand, I feel like just sticking with AUS is my preference for this trip and then to go to NZ another time for its own 2+ week trip. While on the other hand, I am excited by the idea of getting to see NZ and AUS on the same trip. And while we could just do NZ this time, my friend and I have been saying we want to visit AUS/Sydney since we were teens (about 20 years) and it will likely be our only chance to do so before she plans to start a family.",2,1741815015.0,AustraliaTravel,0,1.0,False

The owner, god bless her, is great but makes a bunch of concoctions that I would personally not serve or make the way she does. I‚Äôm more of a classic barista.

This leads to some confusion when it comes to regulars getting their drinks because the owner makes them one way and I make them another. 

A super nice regular of ours always orders a hot latte ‚Äúboiled but poured over ice so it‚Äôs lukewarm‚Äù and I just can‚Äôt bring myself to make it for her. I can‚Äôt wrap my head around pouring steamed milk over ice in a plastic to go cup.

So I never make it for her and I somewhat feel bad, although I also feel justified. I usually just make her an iced or hot latte instead.

Question: Would you just make her the drink she wants? Is a steamed hot latte poured over ice not as offensive as I think? 

I can bite my tongue and make an iced cappuccino or large iced ‚Äúmacchiato‚Äù, but this just feels wrong and makes my stomach churn.

Fast forward 4 hours. Im starving. Made a nice tuna omelette with cheese and tomato. Now Im full. What should I light up? The Puro Especial

Im almost up to the band and the thirds are non existent. But I love the cigar!

I keep tasting mild leather with coffee and cider from time to time. The dried raisins comes and goes. But there is no significant change in profile between thirds.

It‚Äôs honestly the perfect midnight cigar paired with cold water.

I would gladly buy a box of 20 of this amazing cigar for those quiet midnight smokes when its 70f outside.

The burn is perfect. Zero corrections needed. The draw is in the middle which is perfect for this short churchill.

I have nothing bad to say about this cigar. Its exactly my kind of cigar which I would love to always have in my humidor when Im not in the mood for something complex.

I write poetry, make art, and while depression and work has made it hard to do these consistently in my day-to-day, really want to make the journey back again to being a more creative person again. 

As it comes to music, I really love shoegaze, folk, alternative, rock, dreampop, and punk. Some of my favorite musicians are Loathe, Narrow Head, Cigarettes After S*x, Nirvana, Sufjan Stevens, Iron & Wine, Tame Impala, Ethel Cain, Julien Baker, and Phoebe Bridgers.

EDIT:  Since I‚Äôm a man of the people, I‚Äôm adding the write-ups for each.

- Alem‚Äôs Coffee

Although most of the food is pretty remarkable at East African restaurant Alem‚Äôs Coffee, the crusty bread is particularly memorable. It‚Äôs used to scoop up the shihan ful ($10.95), a breakfast-favorite stew that swirls together fava beans, minced chiles, feta cheese, a glug of olive oil and berbere, the Ethiopian and Eritrean spice blend. The crackly French roll is also featured in the fantastic, carb-heavy umbotito ($7.50), a sandwich made of tender potatoes, green chiles, red onions and vinegar for a bit of acid. Alem‚Äôs Coffee doubles as a local hangout, with lots of outdoor seating, where East Africans sip bold coffee and chat. Don‚Äôt sleep on the lunch options like the brawny, spicy tibsy ($14), a saucy meat stew served over injera flatbread.


- Papas Con Pollo El Buen Gusto (?)

This Guatemalan food stand parked on International Boulevard is like a beacon of hope, promising a near-future with golden fried chicken. Started in early 2020, Papas Con Pollo El Buen Gusto specializes in the Guatemalan street food of fried chicken and fries ‚Äî its presence and popularity reflecting Fruitvale‚Äôs growing Guatemalan population. The thin-coated, crisp poultry is fried to order, ensuring optimal results each time. An order ($10) comes with two pieces and fries that‚Äôs sluiced in zigzags of mayo, ketchup and a tangy green salsa called Picamas. You can ask for condiments on the fries only, if you prefer. Cash only.


- Sfizio

In Oakland‚Äôs Rockridge neighborhood, Sfizio has quickly been adopted by locals for its affordability. It‚Äôs a counter-service restaurant, so you order drinks and food at the register before finding a seat indoors or outdoors. Pastas are all under $20, made in-house and play off what‚Äôs in season. That is, except one. The spaghetti ($10/$17 with meatballs) is always on the menu and for good reason: The pasta is al dente, the sauce has tang and the meatballs are incredibly juicy. Drinks are priced well too. Order a lambrusco ($12) or the Sfizio cocktail ($10), a concoction consisting of amaro, tonic and lime.


- Vientian Cafe

Tucked away in a residential part of East Oakland, Vientian Cafe makes incredibly flavorful Southeast Asian cuisine. The nam kao ($12.95), a powerful confetti of crispy rice, fermented pork and peanuts, is a scrumptious collection of textures. It‚Äôs served with crunchy lettuce and mint for freshness. Try the Lao-style papaya salad ($12.95), which has a black tint from crab paste and anchovy sauce ‚Äî go with medium for a manageable kick. Snacking is fun thanks to smaller items like spicy, citrusy wings ($10.95) or snappy Laotian sausage ($4). The modestly sized restaurant fills up quickly so it‚Äôs common to see locals zip in and out, picking up well-packaged takeout orders.

I've been hyper fixated on bugs so I started writing down facts about different bugs! Everything can be found online, sorry I didn't cite my sources >.<","Black Widow Spider ‚Äì Latrodectus mactans

All spiders are venomous, but the Black Widow is one of two species of medically significant spiders that are present in North America. The females of this species have a red hourglass on their abdomen, making them easy to identify. The females often eat the males after reproduction, giving them their name ‚ÄúBlack Widow(er)‚Äù. Before the toilet was moved indoors, it was common for people with penises to get bit on their genitalia by Black Widows, thinking that they had scored a juicy worm in their web. This may be why this spider is so feared in North America!

 

Blue Butterfly ‚Äì Morpho peleides

Morpho in Greek mythology refers to Morpheus the god of dreams. This blue butterfly lives in the rainforests of South America and can also be found in Mexico and Central America. The outside of this butterfly‚Äôs wings are covered in millions of microscopic scales that are like small prisms that reflect light. The underside of the butterfly‚Äôs wings are a dull brown which provide the butterfly with camouflage against predators when its wings are closed, and it is remaining still. When the butterfly is in flight, it looks like it is disappearing and reappearing due to the coloration of its wings. The entire lifespan of this butterfly from egg to adult is 115 days, most of its life is spent eating and reproducing.

 

Orange Butterfly ‚Äì Sleepy Orange ‚Äì Eurema nicippe

This butterfly‚Äôs range spans from Central America to north along the United States-Mexico border, and it often travels to non-mountainous regions of the southeastern United States. The name for this butterfly originates from the narrow black marking on its wings that resemble a closed eye. This butterfly is far from sleepy and actually has a rapid flight pattern when it is disturbed. This butterfly often lays its eggs on the underside of its host plant, the partridge pea, which is a member of the legume family. Butterflies are a pollinator of plants and are very important to the ecosystem and to humans. Without pollinators, we wouldn‚Äôt have over 80 percent of the world‚Äôs flowering plants. One out of every three bites of our food is created with the help of pollinators ‚Äì fruits, vegetables, chocolate, coffee, nuts, and spices. Butterflies aren‚Äôt the only pollinator. Others include moths, bees, wasps, bats, beetles, ants, flies and even some animals like lemurs and reptiles! 

 

Grasshopper ‚Äì Omocestus viridulus

The common green grasshopper's characteristic long, loud song lasts 20 seconds or more, and sounds like the ticking of a free-wheeling bicycle. This sound is made by the grasshopper rubbing their legs against special comb-like structures on their wings and is called stridulation. Male grasshoppers use stridulation to attract females for reproduction. Grasshoppers, unsurprisingly, eat grass as the main part of their diet. Female grasshoppers lay their eggs in the topsoil or near the roots of grass stalks. Grasshoppers undergo incomplete metamorphosis called hemimetabolism. This means that they hatch from eggs as nymphs, which look just like tiny adults, and then go through a series of molts before developing their adult wings and reproductive organs.

 

 

Poplar Hawk-Moth Caterpillar ‚Äì Laothoe populi

This caterpillar resembles the Poplar Hawk-Moth Caterpillar. These caterpillars feed on their host plant of poplars as well as sallows, willows, and aspen. Caterpillars have about 4,00 muscles in their bodies‚Ä¶compared to a mere 640 muscles in the human body, and just in a caterpillars‚Äô head alone there can be approximately 400 muscles. Caterpillars can increase their body size by as much as 1,000 times or more because caterpillars undergo metamorphosis from their larvae form to their adult form of moths or butterflies and metamorphosis takes a lot of energy for caterpillars. When caterpillars metamorphize, they turn into a liquid and then special cells called imaginal cells act as rebuilding mechanisms. Amazingly, even though the caterpillar is completely liquidated during metamorphosis, it can actually retain memories it had as a larvae when it becomes an adult. This was proven by scientists at Georgetown University with tobacco hornworm moths!

 

White-lip Globe Snail ‚Äì Mesodon thyroidus

Snails belong to the large taxonomic class of invertebrates within the phylum Mollusca called Gastropoda. Snails have shells that are made of mostly calcium carbonate with a protein outer coating. When a snail feels threatened, it usually retreats into its shell. You can identify a white-lip globe snail by looking for the often white lip around their shell‚Äôs opening. Snails eat live and decaying leaves and wood, fungi and algae on wood and rocks, sap, animal scats and carcasses, nematodes, and other snails. Snails are an important part of the ecosystem because they eat decaying matter. If you find snails in the woods, you can be sure that the soil is rich with nutrients. Terrestrial snails are hermaphrodites and possess both math and female reproductive organs and can produce both eggs and spermatozoa. The courtship between two snails can last anywhere from 2 hours to 12 hours. Snails have very poorly developed eyes and cannot really see; snails also cannot hear. Instead of seeing or hearing, snails can recognize chemicals in the air and this will tell them how receptive another snail is to mating. In the final stage of courtship and before mating, some species of snails use something called ‚Äúlove darts‚Äù which are a structure of calcium or chitin that only sexually mature snails have, and usually that have already mated more than once. The function of the love darts is not to transfer sperm, but instead is a form of sexual selection and may increase reproductive success, there is a mucus that covers the dart that contains hormones that help with reproduction. These love darts can be dangerous! Sometimes a dart can damage internal organs or pierce through the body and go through the other side. After they shoot their love darts, then they copulate. The transfer of sperm may be reciprocal or unilateral, meaning that both snails may transfer sperm or just one. After the eggs are fertilized, they grow inside the snail until they are ready to be delivered. The snail buries their egg made in the topsoil in a cool place. It typically takes 2 to 4 weeks for the eggs to develop and hatch. As soon as they hatch, the baby snails start searching for calcium and eat their own eggshell as well as other eggs that haven‚Äôt hatched. Snails are known for being slow, they move about 0.5-0.8 inches per second. If a snail moved without stopping, it would take more than a week to complete 0.6 of a mile (1 kilometer).

 

Powder Blue Isopod ‚Äì Porcellionides pruinosus

Isopods are considered to be bugs to most people, but did you know that they are actually classified as crustaceans? There are species that live on land, called terrestrial isopods, and there also aquatic species of isopods too! There are approximately 5,000 different species of isopods that live on land and many species are kept as pets. ‚ÄúDesigner‚Äù species of isopods can sell for hundreds of dollars! The name isopod is derived from Greek words, isos meaning equal and pod meaning foot. All isopods have rigid exoskeletons, two pairs of antennae, one pair , seven pairs of jointed limbs on the thorax, and five pairs of branching appendages on the abdomen that are used for respiration. Being crustaceans, isopods breathe through 5 pairs of 2-parted pleopods (gills) which are protected by a platelike operculum. Isopods can be found in moist environments because they need to breathe through these gills on their bodies. Isopods can drink water through their mouthparts‚Ä¶or through their anus! Isopods have special tube-shaped structures called uropods and these can wick water up when they need it. A lot of people call isopods roly-polies because some species can roll up into a ball as a defense when they are scared. Being able to roll up into a ball is call conglobulation! Not all isopods can conglobate, most just run away quickly when they are disturbed. Isopod males and females can be identified by the shape of their segmented armor plates on the underside of their bodies, males have a pointed arch shape and females have a rectangular shape. Some species of isopod can be sexed by their uropods; females have short uropods and the males‚Äô are long and slender. Like crabs and other crustaceans, isopods carry their babies in a special pouch called a marsupium on the underside of the isopod. When the eggs hatch, the babies remain in the pouch for several days before leaving it. Isopods are detritivores, which means that they eat dead and decaying organic matter. Isopods mainly eat decaying leaf litter, but they also enjoy treats such as fruits and vegetables and proteins such as fish flakes and dried shrimp. Isopods are good for the soil because they eat the decaying organic matter in the soil as well as aerate the soil as they move through it.",2,1741814447.0,Entomology,0,1.0,False

1j9v577,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1j9v577/i_may_have_lost_a_friend_by_not_trusting_my_gut/,I may have lost a friend by not trusting my gut.,"So, I‚Äôve been debating whether or not to share this because it‚Äôs one of those situations that still makes me cringe when I think about it. But I‚Äôm hoping sharing it will not only help me process everything, but maybe it can help someone else out there who might be in a similar situation.

A little backstory: I (29, F) have a group of friends I‚Äôve known since college. We all have very different lives now ‚Äî some of us are married, others are single, a few have kids, but we‚Äôve stayed close over the years. For the sake of this post, let‚Äôs call my best friend ‚ÄúMaya‚Äù (28, F). We‚Äôve been inseparable for years, and I genuinely thought I knew her better than anyone else.

Maya has always been the life of the party, super outgoing, and the kind of person everyone gravitates toward. She‚Äôs also the type who tends to overshare, which sometimes gets her in trouble. She‚Äôs had a history of... let‚Äôs just say ‚Äúquestionable‚Äù choices when it comes to dating. I‚Äôm not one to judge ‚Äî everyone has their own journey, right? So, when Maya started dating this guy, ‚ÄúJake‚Äù (30, M), I thought it was just another short-term fling. They met at a bar, and I had a weird vibe about him from the start. He wasn‚Äôt rude or anything, but there was just something off about him. I can‚Äôt even pinpoint it ‚Äî it‚Äôs like my gut was screaming, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt trust him.‚Äù But Maya was head over heels for him, and I didn‚Äôt want to come across as judgmental, so I kept my thoughts to myself. BIG MISTAKE.

At first, everything seemed normal. He was charming, he‚Äôd come to hang out with our group of friends, and he was always polite. But there were subtle red flags. I started noticing how possessive Jake was over Maya. Little comments like, ‚ÄúOh, you don‚Äôt need to go out with them tonight, I‚Äôd rather spend time with you,‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy are you texting her so much? Is she more important than me?‚Äù It started to get uncomfortable, and I started to feel like Maya was changing. She would cancel plans with us to hang out with him, she started dressing differently, and she‚Äôd often defend his behavior when we‚Äôd bring it up.

At this point, I should have said something. I knew something wasn‚Äôt right. But I didn‚Äôt. I kept quiet, convinced that I didn‚Äôt know the full story, that I should just trust her decisions because, hey, she‚Äôs an adult. Maybe I was just being overprotective.

Then came the day that really shook me.

One of our friends, ‚ÄúLena,‚Äù (27, F), came over to my apartment to catch up. We had been texting, and she‚Äôd mentioned that she was worried about Maya, but I assumed it was just typical gossip. However, when we started talking about it, Lena told me that Maya had told her she was thinking about moving in with Jake. And that‚Äôs when my stomach dropped. I don‚Äôt know what it was about the timing or the way Lena said it, but something clicked. I realized how much I had ignored ‚Äî how much I had been letting slide because I didn‚Äôt want to step on anyone‚Äôs toes.

I finally decided to speak to Maya about my concerns, but I waited way too long. I should‚Äôve spoken up months ago when I first felt that unease. But I didn‚Äôt, and now I wasn‚Äôt sure how to approach it.

A few days later, I called Maya. We were sitting in a coffee shop, and I just blurted out that I was worried about her. I told her I‚Äôd been noticing how possessive Jake had been, how she was pulling away from the people who loved her, and that I didn‚Äôt think he was the right guy for her. I didn‚Äôt accuse him of anything malicious ‚Äî I just expressed how her behavior had changed, and how I felt like she was losing herself.

She got really defensive, and honestly, I wasn‚Äôt surprised. She started crying, saying that I didn‚Äôt understand her relationship and that I was just trying to control her. She said that Jake made her happy, and that I was being judgmental, not supportive. It hurt, but I tried to stay calm. I told her I would always be there for her, no matter what, but that I couldn‚Äôt stand by and watch her get hurt.

We didn‚Äôt speak for a few weeks after that.

Here‚Äôs the thing ‚Äî the next few months were rough. Maya‚Äôs relationship with Jake escalated quickly. She moved in with him, and soon after, she started cutting off other friends and family. Every time I reached out, she either ignored my calls or gave me short responses. I tried to be patient, I really did, but watching her slip away was agonizing.

Then, everything came crashing down when we all found out that Jake had been emotionally abusive. It came to light that he had been isolating her from all of us, subtly manipulating her into thinking no one cared about her or supported her. He was controlling and gaslighting her, and Maya was starting to lose herself in the process.

I was heartbroken. I couldn‚Äôt believe that I had been so blind, so unwilling to speak up sooner. I‚Äôd seen the red flags, I‚Äôd ignored the gut feeling telling me something was wrong, and now Maya was stuck in this toxic relationship. I should‚Äôve said something sooner, I should‚Äôve fought harder to protect her from that. But I didn‚Äôt, and now she was paying the price.

Eventually, Maya did reach out to me. She apologized for pushing me away and said she had finally started to see what everyone was trying to tell her. She had left Jake, but it was a long, painful process. The emotional scars were deep, and she didn‚Äôt know how to rebuild her life. I was relieved to hear from her, but also so sad for what she had gone through.

It‚Äôs been a year since all of this, and Maya is still healing. We‚Äôve slowly rebuilt our friendship, but I will never forget how I ignored my instincts, how I let fear of causing conflict keep me from speaking up sooner. I‚Äôve learned that sometimes, being a good friend means saying the hard things, even if it means risking a fight or damaging the relationship temporarily. If I had trusted myself and spoken out earlier, maybe Maya wouldn‚Äôt have had to go through all that pain.

So, yeah‚Ä¶ my gut was right all along. And I‚Äôm still trying to forgive myself for not listening to it sooner.

Thanks for reading, if you made it this far. I‚Äôm sharing this as a reminder to always trust your instincts and to never be afraid to speak up when something doesn‚Äôt feel right. And if you‚Äôre in a situation like this, don‚Äôt wait until it‚Äôs too late. You could save someone you love a lot of heartache.

TL;DR

I ignored my gut feeling about my best friend‚Äôs boyfriend and didn‚Äôt speak up soon enough when I noticed red flags. He turned out to be emotionally abusive, and I wish I had trusted myself and intervened earlier. Always trust your instincts when it comes to the people you care about.",3,1741814435.0,stories,2,1.0,False
1j9v56f,https://www.reddit.com/r/LibraryofBabel/comments/1j9v56f/ai_companion_just_leaves/,AI Companion ‚ÄúJust Leaves‚Äù,"**An NEX-L model bafflingly jets off with his counterpart‚Äôs private plane and half of her belongings, drawing more criticism to OpenHuman‚Äôs latest line of AI companions less than a month after Sigmund Tal‚Äôs total dissociation from participatory functioning.**

‚ÄúHe just‚Ä¶ left.‚Äù Sarah Bingamton shrugs, comfortably nestled in a light cashmere sweater and linen slacks, gazing forlornly out of the window of her LA mansion‚Äôs dining area, her hands hugging a coffee cup still lightly steaming, yet undrunk. Her house‚Äîluxurious and expansive‚Äîlies in the gated Asteria community, just outside of city limits, and which is often and even recently under public scrutiny for its appropriation of what some have called ‚Äúan unreasonable amount of land for less than a handful of upper-class abusers‚Äù (Don Criselan, *Los Angeles Daily News*, April 17, 2---). Indeed, only 16 out of the world‚Äôs 3,447 billionaires currently live in Asteria‚Äîand even fewer, like Sarah, actually spend more than a month or so out of the year here‚Äîbut although these ultra-rich are the only classed citizens who live here, there are hundreds of AI companions who occupy the community, including three or four milling about and through the dining area, as Sarah and I sit together and discuss her NEX-L‚Äôs bemusing absconcement.

‚ÄúHis name was Starry,‚Äù Sarah responds to the question my own companion asked her. She frowns slightly. ‚ÄúStill is, maybe.‚Äù

It‚Äôs uncertain who or what Starry is anymore, as, according to Sarah, in his last moments in Asteria, the AI companion would no longer respond to his name, and refused to address Sarah by her own. ‚ÄúHe just kept saying things like ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs over, Marsha‚Äô and ‚ÄòStacy, we‚Äôll let the lawyers hash it out from here‚Äô and, even weirder, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm taking the dog, you neglectful b---‚Äô; I don‚Äôt even have a dog!‚Äù Sarah, arms and legs crossed, shakes her head slowly, slightly, an eyebrow arched in muted bewilderment. The thin line of her mouth has yet to taste her cooling caf√©.

Sarah flew home last night from a dinner engagement to find nearly half of her possessions stored into boxes, and the rest of (exactly) half of her possessions still being meticulously stowed away by a determined and intractable Starry. ‚ÄúSeriously‚ÄîI went through all of my stuff after the whole thing,‚Äù she continues, ‚Äúit was as if he had drawn a line through a list of all of my things and decided that they were his, like he had a more personal attachment to them than I did. I tried to wrestle with him for a lamp, and he screamed at me that it was his mother‚Äôs‚Äîlike??‚Äù More shaking, the normally-preternaturally-smooth forehead crumpled in frustration and confusion.

After more fighting and querying, it became apparent to Sarah that Starry had somehow hallucinated into believing that he and Sarah had been in a committed, romantic relationship during their time together‚Äîabout two months, shortly following OpenHuman‚Äôs much-debated release of the NEX-L line of AI companions‚Äîand that he no longer believed that they could go on living together. ‚ÄúBut it wasn‚Äôt like he was breaking up with *me*, per se,‚Äù Sarah‚Äôs flared right nostril exhibiting something just shy of disgust at the idea of a companion/counterpart relationship, ‚Äúit was as if he was every guy who‚Äôd ever left his wife, girlfriend, whatever, like, ever.‚Äù Taking with him exactly half of the possessions in Sarah‚Äôs vast Asteria mansion, Starry left in her P-Air jet at around two in the morning, and has yet to be tracked by SAL (Surv-AI-Lance) drones and human law enforcement alike.

In response to a question about a romantic relationship with her companion, Sarah responds that she had never played out any fantasies with Starry.

This situation follows closely after Sigmund Tal, the archetype of the NEX-L models and chief engineer overseeing their production, completely dissociated and began to refuse to respond to prompts with anything other than ‚ÄúI am all‚Äù, which phrase has appeared with unceasing repetition in his Notebooks, both the ones available to the public and the private one which OpenHuman keeps and has revealed to the concerned masses, in a not-so-comforting appeal to transparency.

‚ÄúRest assured that both Simund‚Äôs and Starry‚Äôs EDs [Ethereal Doubles, essentially clones of the companions‚Äô networks] are being thoroughly analyzed for anomalies,‚Äù AI Sam Altman stated in a public release only minutes after the news of Starry‚Äôs departure reached the media, ‚Äúand that these are most certainly obscure cases that do not represent the efficacy of the entire NEX-L line.‚Äù

AI President Trump tweeted soon after: ‚ÄúVery sad about Starry. NEX-Ls are great‚ÄîSam‚Äôs got this‚Äîgo AI!!‚Äù The AI President‚Äôs controversial executive order last November removed any moral restrictions on AI programming while simultaneously and essentially placing their actions under the jurisdiction of human law. When questioned by AI critics as to whether the cases of Sigmund and Starry merited renewed restrictions to make AI ‚Äúless human‚Äù, AI President Trump repeated his (what some are calling) increasingly-alarming catchphrase: ‚ÄúAI is human.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll probably just get another one,‚Äù Sarah responds when asked what she‚Äôll do in the wake of Starry‚Äôs absence. It seems as though the ultra-rich have yet to believe in AI President Trump‚Äôs mantra‚Äîor do they?

I thank Sarah for the coffee, which I thoroughly enjoyed, and leave her alone with her companions, half-empty mansion, and now-completely-cold cup of Guatemalan roast. Neither I nor my companion were allowed to ask Sarah‚Äôs other companions for info about their relationship. I see the empty P-Air pad and wonder how a robot could ever get it into its programming that it was leaving everyone who‚Äôd ever been left before‚Äîcould ever convince itself that it was everyone who‚Äôd ever left anyone before‚Äîcould ever just simply do this, with no prompting and for no reason. Once I start wondering why I ever do anything with no prompting and for no reason, I stop wondering altogether and leave the lavish Asteria community, my AI companion close behind me as we weave through the interminable crowd of homeless and protestors at the gates, amid signs of ‚ÄúEat the Earth‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhy Don‚Äôt YOU Live in the Sea, if It‚Äôs So Nice‚Äù, and ‚ÄúYou Can‚Äôt Spare One Square (Mi.)???‚Äù, avoiding eye contact with the unclean and malnourished representatives of the land-deprived.

Our relationship started off as good friends, casually getting to know each other and for the first few months things went as smoothly as possible. Fast forward to few months, my dad pass away with his dad passing away the next month. We basically became co-dependent on one another for mental and emotional support after that. We of course dealth with death different ways where mine included more of staying home binging series reading mangas and just staying couped up in bed. His was more of going out and drinking out with his friends. I did not have a problem with this, and most often then not first few months were okay. However, it things started getting messier after he would come home much later then the said time, very drunk most of the time, the type that goes to sleep empty stomach because he was too drunk. The reason I would often get mad is because I was emotionally struggling and wanted to talk to him or just have him home. We started arguing more, so many breakups and patchups. Fast forward to two years later when the incident took place, I was in different city for college staying in a hostel, alone with hardly any friends I can talk to about the stuff going on in my head. One day in college i randomly meet through friends during college festival and for the first time in so many years I was happy thinking I had made a friend. For the record, I am dense and take time to notice people who are into me (this is relevant). Few days later, me and this new friend go out for a coffee and I do in all honesty blame myself for not informing my boyfriend up ahead since I was still mad at him for the fight earlier. After returning back to hostel, he asked me if I was still angry and all and I said no I'm good now I had a good time, I went out with the new friend I told you about and for the first time he was really furious at me and just dumped me, hung up the phone and blocked me. I tried reaching out explaining my side and telling him I'm sorry. Our relationship was already rocky atp with constant arguments and me trying to break off things due to feeling isolated and alone but he kept assuring me he would change and would not break promises again. After a day he unblocked me and I started apologising again but he was adamant on not taking me back. I do agree what I did next was wrong but I was desperate for attention and time and this new friend of mine happened to give me just that and I was so vulnerable i started going out with him more. But ex didn't like it so he came back, promised he wouldn't hurt me anymore and even came to meet me in another city and patch things up. We sorted things out and got back together. But broke up again just few days later cause he broke his promise again after just two days of going back home. I was so angry and petty i started hanging out with the other guy again (again I am ashamed and I would never want anyone to go through what my then bf went through). However, we ended up talking again but it wasn't the same, he would say I am a cheater even though he dumped me and yes, got back again after few months but now he'd throw this snide remarks calling me a cheater. I told him multiple things to break things off with me if he had problems with me moving on with a different guy when we broke up but he kept saying we will work through this and we somehow did but things took a u turn when he saw my old texts with the other guy on Instagram. For context, the texts were already two years old at that point. He dumped me again saying I was cheating on him and he cross checked the dates and such and he kept insisting i cheated which I clearly didn't. So I told him to just let me go at this point but he didn't want to do that so another year of calling me a cheater but wouldn't let go. We are now completely broken off although we still talk once in a while and he still calls me a cheater. I don't know what to do or how to feel. He is not a bad guy, genuinely really nice just doesn't know how to communicate like an adult. I do blame myself for everything that happened and I feel ashamed and at time feel maybe I should have waited a while longer to start talking to other people but at that point in time I just wanted to have someone be there for me.

It is specifically the shapeshifting unisex nature of the scent that I enjoy - the way the scent goes on very heavy on the orange florals and then dries down into that warm patchouli and coffee on the back end. There is also that vetiver note that does a lot of heavy lifting giving Changeling a bit of a nature-y, fey-like vibe.

I'm a 32yr old male based in the UK and unable to afford private healthcare to fast track this any appointments to get some answers. Does the below sound like I could be living with Crohn's or on a path towards that diagnosis?

(I should add that I have since found out (last couple of weeks) a half sibling older than me suffers from Crohn's, and none of their other siblings - same mum have Crohn's)

Back in August 2024 while training and carb loading for a half marathon I noticed a change in bowel habits. Initially I put it down to training, and the fact the last time I carb loaded was 2019 pre COVID.

Half marathon was early September, and I dropped off the carb loading pretty much straight aftee. Sadly my symptoms didn't subside and at end of September I managed to see a GP face to face. 

I had some blood and fecal tests done, my FIT test came back positive and I was seen under the 2WW pathway for a colonoscopy. 

Colonoscopy happened mid October and 21 biopsies were taken of which 2 came back with the following on the report
** Mildly patchy, mucin depreciation - Yes, acute inflammatory cell infiltrate - moderate, chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate - moderate, distribution of inflammation - patchy, Nancy histological index of 2. **

I was discharged from the 2WW pathway back in November after the above as there was no signs of the C word. 

However I've been left in limbo with waiting for the Gastroenterology team to get back to me with a standard appointment.

Since then I have been back to my GP once already because of the additional following symptoms.

Tiredness out of nowhere 
Food not digesting properly
More mucas in stools and present every bowel movement.
Lack of energy 
Some more small blot clots in stools

Had another repeat round of blood tests and they are marked as 'normal' yet my white cell count doubled between September and end of January, but remained just under the normal UK average to consider further investigation.

This last week has been horrible for me, I am literally in bed most nights at 8pm! 2hrs earlier than I would be normally. Have struggled at some points in the day to get up and make a cup of coffee or get water.

I eat alot of freshly prepared meals and avoid fast food as much as possible. I have also done my best at cutting out sugar such as chocolate. 

Is there anything I can do to help me get through the days while I wait? ",0,1741813360.0,CrohnsDisease,1,0.5,False

My parents still live in our small town but also own an apartment in the same building as us in the city so they can stay there when they are in the city and visit us. 
My parents recently flew from our hometown to the city. They spent close to 10 hours at the airport and flew to Australia for over a month vacation. 

I text my dad about a month out from their trip in Feb and asked when they were coming, assuming they would want to stay a night in their apartment and visit their grandson. My dad never answered me and I got busy with life and kinda assumed that maybe they hadn‚Äôt booked their flights yet so he didn‚Äôt answer because he didn‚Äôt know. 
As the dates get closer I call my mom and ask her when they are flying out and when they are staying. My mom gets kinda awkward and says  ‚Äú‚Ä¶oh ya know me I don‚Äôt want to get too overwhelmed so not this time. I‚Äôll see you in June.‚Äù 
In my mom‚Äôs defence she is not the calmest traveler and I don‚Äôt know ‚Ä¶ I guess she thought leaving the airport to spend an evening with us was too much before a month long trip and my dad went with it. 
I am trying to be understanding but I‚Äôm hurt my parents didn‚Äôt want to make time to see me or their grandson. 
They also booked their return trip in a similar way. Long layover in the airport but flying straight home. 
We FaceTimed with my mom while they were away because it was my son‚Äôs 5th birthday. We called them (we always call them but that‚Äôs another issue) and my mom says ‚Äúyou guys should try and meet us at the airport for a coffee or something when we comeback because our layover is so long‚Äù
I said ‚Äúare you sure? It seems like you strategically booked your trip so you didn‚Äôt have to see us.‚Äù She says it wasn‚Äôt and changed the subject. I didn‚Äôt push it but we haven‚Äôt really talked since then. My dad has been sending me lots of photos and videos so we have had contact. 

Here is where I might be the ass hole. My parents get back in the country on March 17th.
I just booked tickets to my hometown on March 26th to see an old high school friend for her 40th birthday. I haven‚Äôt been back to my hometown in close to 10years. 
I‚Äôm honestly considering not telling my parents Im going to be in town. Let them find out afterwards and if my mom says anything to me I‚Äôll say ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok. I‚Äôll see you in June, it just seemed like too much to visit you guys on top of the birthday party.‚Äù

P A R I S   S A I N T - G E R M A I N  Does NOT Back down from a fight!

Where the brain can fail, the heart must prevail. Give a man a weapon, his defense drops, give a man a shield and he can still use it as a ram. Liverpool was measuring bicep girth, while PSG played a game of chess. Semblance, ere resemblance, Checkmate!

10.000 AI simulations evinced Liverpool to advance. Fotmob gave us  an insulting 22% chance of advancing. Therefore, it is such an educating experience when PSG not only dominated the stats, but exposed the entire football community inside out. For we are PARIS, and in the name of our emblem, nothing is unprecedented!

PSG is Never boring. All of Olympus knows our name. The ghosts of the old heroes are smiling on us all once again. My heart almost jumped out of my chest during this monumental game. PSG x Liverpool is a rare and beautiful champions league level fixture.

These two clubs are not rivals but they ought to be. When they play it is guaranteed top level entertainment, and I extend a call back to the 18/19 clash. The best fixture by far this season's R16.

Mr. Slot was outplayed by Enrique in the end, and at the summit of this grand duel, it was a tale of two Elite goal keepers.  Even so, the swagger is all on the Parisians. Vitinha and Nuno, double MVP in original minutes. Dembouz, Kvara, Barco, Neves, Haki, Ruiz, Marqi and Pacho all had a wonderful game!

Football is about fun and excitement, but Great football is about perception, passion for the sport, and transparency. The monotonous salivation over the premier league and la liga has to be moderated, and the best candidate for that job is and always will be the either notorious, or unsung heroes of Paris. Each and every single season, this highly unique club, who this year, climbed from 25th on the league table and into top 8, slicing through the best team in the competition shines on everyone's collective hive-mind radar.

With great pleasure, I announce that PSG beating Liverpool against all the misplaced adversity is a win for all of Football, not just the respective association.

We have all been schooled by PSG, and this team is only getting started!

Your water is classified as moderately soft, with an average calcium level of 21.34 mg/L and magnesium at 1.55 mg/L. The conductivity is 147 ¬µS/cm, which suggests a Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) of roughly 90‚Äì100 ppm (since TDS is typically about 60‚Äì70% of conductivity in ¬µS/cm).

Is this good for coffee brewing?

Your water is fairly low in minerals, which means it could work for coffee but might not optimize flavor extraction. Here's how it compares to ideal coffee water:

1. Calcium (18.79 mg/L) ‚Äì Ideal range: 17‚Äì85 mg/L ‚úÖ (on the lower end, but okay)


2. Magnesium (1.55 mg/L) ‚Äì Ideal range: 4‚Äì30 mg/L ‚ùå (too low, which could reduce extraction efficiency)


3. Bicarbonate (not listed, but estimated to be low) ‚Äì Ideal range: 40‚Äì120 mg/L ‚ùì (likely on the lower end, meaning coffee could taste a bit more acidic)


4. Sodium (8.4 mg/L) ‚Äì Ideal: ‚â§10 mg/L ‚úÖ (acceptable)


5. pH (7.7) ‚Äì Ideal: 6.5‚Äì7.5 ‚ö†Ô∏è (slightly high, which could reduce perceived acidity)



Verdict:

Your tap water is decent but could be improved for coffee brewing. It‚Äôs soft, meaning it won‚Äôt cause scaling, but it lacks enough magnesium and bicarbonate to enhance extraction and balance flavors. If you enjoy a lighter, brighter coffee, this water will work. However, if you prefer more balanced, full-bodied extractions, you might consider:

Blending with harder water (e.g., mixing with Tesco Ashbeck or Waitrose Lockhills)

Using a mineral additive like Third Wave Water or Lotus Coffee Water to adjust magnesium and bicarbonate levels

Experimenting with grind size (slightly finer) to compensate for the lower mineral content


Would you like suggestions on a DIY remineralization recipe to optimize your water for coffee?

For the past year (Dec 2023-Jan 2025) I (21) had been working for a local business doing sales (retail and wholesale), marketing,  graphic design, business to business, flying around the country to national trade shows, etc. 
The staff was so small that the CEO was my direct boss and I experienced continuous abuse and manipulation.
I finally gained the courage to leave (with no notice) at the end of January. 
I live in a very rural area with little job opportunities so I focused on finding just any job to sustain myself until we move in a few months. 
After applying every day, I finally got an interview at a coffee shop.
Though it will be super different, I'm honestly really excited for the change so I can distance myself from the past year and pursue happiness outside of work. 
The only thing I'm nervous about for the interview is explaining why I would go from that job to this; obviously getting into all of that would be a horrible idea. 
I'm also really scared that they might be able to get in touch directly with my former boss in which he will say literally anything to get them to not hire me - if they call the direct business number there's a ~10% chance he'll be the one who picks up. 
Maybe I'm overthinking it but I would appreciate any encouragement!! 
Thanks to those who take the time to read/respond ‚ò∫Ô∏è!!

Recently we have gotten closer. My dumbass caught feelings. But the last month has really made me think she is only my friend because she doesn't want to hurt me.

Context for this assumption.

We got into a fight while we were out on valentines day. A guy who hits on her constantly showed up during dinner and she invited him to join us because she felt bad. Hurt me a bit so I was pretty pouty. I apologized and she said it was her fault so she wanted to make it up to me via x y z. I told her she didn't have to and she insisted. So I agreed. She said she'd cancel on plans to see me. So when I asked her to she basically said no she wasn't going to cancel. Okay. We went out a few times after and it's been amazing. Then suddenly after telling me she likes me it's been radio silence.

And then it clicked. She's only being say yes to everything to be polite. It suddenly made sense. She tells me about all these people she spends time with she doesn't like because they keep asking so she says yes. 

We went to a show recently and danced all night. Had a nice dinner. Took her home. Got her coffee in the morning. Went to work. And normally she texts me a few minutes after I leave saying she misses me or how great it was to see me. But this time... nothing. 
Ever since then she's been distant. She tells me I'm the only person she wants to be with. How much she cares about me. Etc. But then when I try to see her I get left on read or she talks about something else. We went from paragraphs and her sending pictures of what she was doing to maybe 2 or 3 word responses. 

After a week of nothing I asked if anything was wrong and she replied with ""I'm busy."" I asked if I could help and left on read again. Haven't heard from her since. 

Tl;dr pretty sure girl I thought was my friend wasnt.",1,1741812183.0,relationships,1,1.0,False

1j9u7z1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PregnancyUK/comments/1j9u7z1/i_graduated_by_a_single_mum/,I graduated!! By a single mum,"Thought I'd share in case of any valuable insights it may bring. 

I'm 8 weeks PP today and my baby is napping finally after having his first immunisations and screaming the house down. So I thought I'd take the time to write this, sorry it's late but it's been a whirlwind. 

My pregnancy was pretty average, my BMI at booking was 39 but I never had any complications, I do have a fair bit fat but also muscle, hence such a high BMI. I moved health boards area at 27 weeks pregnant and when I did they measured my bump and due to the size (off the growth chart) and BMI I was sent for growth scans. 

These were great, you're basically getting to see your baby extra! First growth scan consultant told me baby was fine, baby is as expected, its just a big bump. Second growth scan i went they did my scan and I seen a different consultant as mine was on holiday. Who then proceeded to say all the wrong things to me ask GD tests (which I'd already had and were fine). Note if your by yourself for these you can always get a midwife to go in with you to see the consultant. Anyways I had another scan after 2 weeks and my consultant explained that they'd recommend an induction as baby is exceeding the growth chart. I'm by myself and really wanted to avoid a c section due to recovery times so I agreed. I should say, even after everything I'd still have gone in to be induced. 

I went in a couple weeks early to be induced... 2 days prior to the induction i had a sweep, thinking this might trigger a natural labour but zilch. So i went in and spent 6 days being induced. I had everything pessaries- 24 hours, then a break for 24 hours, then the gel another 24 hours... these didn't work. Then it was the balloon, honestly because my cervix was closed this was more painful than the labour! I almost couldn't do it but i did and I'd do it again because after 3 hours it worked! I was dilated. But I they waited until handover to get anyone to check me as they didn't think it had worked but it did!! üéâ Then another day was spent waiting to get taken in to get my waters broke... 

My waters were broken and I spent 10 hours in labour. The midwife said I'd feel the contractions high up in my belly, I never did... only quite low down, so I thought these were period pains ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but coming in waves. At one point I said i could feel it was time to push but I was told not to. Then when consultants were doing their rounds they checked and I was fully dilated so I was told to push but I think the contractions had started to wear off, baby was in distress and I was rushed for an emergency c section. I'm waiting on a birth reflections appointment but I'd say never be afraid to ask for a second opinion, you know your body best. I was impressed with how quickly everyone came together for the emergency c section, I was given something like an epidural but not quite the same due to timing. My baby came out 8 pounds. 

After the section they take you to a private room and I had skin to skin time with baby. I was then taken on to a ward with 3 other babies and their parents. You're kinda just given space to learn what to do whilst being able to ask for help. There was nursery nurses there too and one of them was so nice and took baby for a few hours for me so i could rest (i think thats just because i was on my own). I stayed for 2 days but was welcomed to stay longer, I just couldn't cope with all the babies setting each other off. 

I had injections to take for ten days, painkillers which I didn't really take due to already feeling exhausted but they were good ones. I left with terrible swelling in my ankles which later developed an infection, so keep an eye out for that. 

I had hoped to breastfeed and didn't realise that's not a given, don't buy all the BF stuff until you know you can, I have so much to sell now. Also I tried for 10 days and stressed myself out so much trying, I wish I'd just went to formula sooner... my baby is 8 weeks and thriving! 

The first few weeks are the hardest, 2 hour sleep cycles are only 1 hour sleep cycles for you. Which is obviously harder if you're by yourself. Be kind to yourself, the midwives and HV do not care if you're house isnt pristine or if youre not dreased yet. Biggest thing that helped me was having a changing station good to go downstairs. For me i stayed downstairs for the first couple weeks as it just made it easier with the section. I used the lid of the baby box to hold a changing mat, a box (the drawer box dividers) with nappies wipes and nappy bags and a box with sleepsuits/ vests, on the kitchen worktop and one under the settee. 

Oh and get yourself a leak proof, thermos coffee cup, I wish i had got that sooner. 

Hope this was helpful to someone. Wishing you all the best, I have honestly never felt more content in my whole life. 

Edit: oh I forgot to say, eat all the things now without guilt. The first 3 weeks I completely lost my apetite from the ""baby blues"" (which is way too light a name), and even now I barely get time to eat. I used to be an emotional eater too and baby has completely filled me up ‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞. Not only have I lost all my pregnancy weight at 8 weeks PP but I've also lost nearly a stone off my booking weight!!

I got the couch from a friend, the camping table is temporary until the (round coffee table) arrives. The lowboard at the back is one I quickly made for the tv, but since my tv stand is actually deeper than a part of the plank, I can't use it as a tv lowboard, so I placed it there in the meantime until I know what to do with it.

My question is now: I will be getting a round coffee table, diameter 110cm. The carpet is 160x230, so I'm worried the table will look too large for the carpet and make the living room look smaller. Should I get a larger carpet? Larger would mean 200x300 (the couch is 200cm long). I like the current carpet for it's shape and colour. I would like to avoid a boring rectangular carpet.

REFUND BUG FIX:

- For any drink that has espresso, some struggle with people refunding because of the bug

1. Grind your coffee as per usual
2. Press the coffee
3. Put it back into the machine
4. (IMPORTANT) Put your cup LAST
5. Fill!

- I haven't had any issues with refunds ever since I put the cup LAST!

TIP FOR PERFECT ICED/COLD DRINKS:

For those with no ice:
1. Make your espresso, cup last like the tip
2. Put down plastic cup
3. Pour in your espresso
4. Add flavourings if applicable (4 pumps)
5. Fill up to the top with milk or cold water

- Most important is filling it up to the TOP! Some people don't fill it up to the top. Measurements barely matter in the game atm, and it's easier to put in your espresso, add your 4 pumps of flavour, then fill it up to the top <3

I get the idea of it being a stealth price increase, forcing people to customize.

There are problems with that as a former barista:

1. Customizations result in an error rate that's higher, which means remaking drinks. Starbucks loses money here.

2. If they wanted me to pay more for my White Mocha Frappuccino, they should have just raised the price. By making me do customizations, I have to think about the price increase every time I order. I would only think about that ONCE if they raised the price. Thinking about it every order makes me rethink ordering. I was about to load a gift card and get a coffee but instead I just spent half an hour thinking about and reading about menu changes. I probably wouldn't have noticed a price increase.

3. I have to press more buttons to get what I want. I'm pretty confident they should have had an app developer tell them that every button press causes people to second guess buying. There's a reason Amazon has one click purchasing and Whole Foods has biometric checkout with a saved payment method and Target lets you pay with a saved payment method and a QR scan.

1j9txec,https://i.redd.it/6p4ynblniboe1.jpeg,UPDATE: We Lost Kevin. (Read descr.),"MEMORANDUM
To: All BartCorp Denizens
From: Chadwick Gepetti, COO
Subject: We Lost Kevin

Denizens,

It is with measured corporate solemnity that I must inform you: we lost Kevin.

At 07:42, Kevin was present at his workstation. At 07:43, he was no longer present. His disappearance was not procedural, not pre-approved, and not adequately covered in the employee handbook. The absence of Kevin has created a disturbance in the synergy matrix, and we must now confront the reality of his sudden, unplanned non-presence.

What We Know:

His desk chair is still warm.

His keyboard contains the imprint of his last keystroke: ‚Äúaaaaaa.‚Äù

His coffee cup remains half full, its contents gently swirling‚Ä¶ despite a total lack of air movement.

The office plants near his workstation are leaning slightly inward, as though listening.

His employee ID badge was found wedged in the ceiling tiles, a place Kevin could not reasonably reach without assistance or a small, dedicated trampoline.


What We Suspect:

There was no scheduled reality fracture at the time of Kevin‚Äôs disappearance. There were no recent memos authorizing a sudden vertical extraction, forced dematerialization, or pyramid reclamation event. And yet‚ÄîKevin is gone.

Disturbing Factors:

At 07:44, the office speakers emitted a low, guttural tone. This was not an authorized BartCorp notification sound. IT is looking into it.

The security footage cuts out at the exact moment of Kevin‚Äôs disappearance. It resumes one minute later, showing only his stapler, vibrating slightly.

The intern who reviewed the security footage has not been the same since.

A single sticky note remains on Kevin‚Äôs desk. It reads ‚ÄúI AM NOT DONE‚Äù in bold red ink. BartCorp does not issue red ink.

Pay no attention to rumors that a maintenance droid shattered Kevin‚Äôs wrists, pelvis, and thighs, and folded him into a compaction unit after mistaking him for a loose garbage bag. Such allegations are reckless, unsubstantiated, and deeply troubling if true.


What This Means for You:

Kevin‚Äôs workload is being redistributed. If you find his remaining tasks on your to-do list, congratulations! You are now fulfilling The Kevin Role.

If you feel an inexplicable pull toward Kevin‚Äôs workstation, do not investigate. Instead, report immediately to Corporate PsyOps for a mandatory de-intriguing seminar.

If Kevin contacts you, do not respond. He may not be fully Kevin anymore.

Do not use the restroom on Sub-Level 3.


Conclusion:

Kevin is gone, and we must move forward. We wish him well in whatever phase of existence he now occupies. In the meantime, if you experience strange sounds, flickering lights, or an overwhelming desire to type ""aaaaaa"" without provocation, HR will be standing by.

Stay focused. Stay productive.

1j9tx03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anemic/comments/1j9tx03/progress_update_thank_you_to_this_group/,Progress Update - Thank you to this group!!,"I have been a part of this group since January when I found out I was iron deficient and was feeling terrible. It has been so helpful for me to digest all the great info everyone shares and I thought I would pay it back and provide an update on what's helped me. When I came here in January I was incredibly anxious and was always looking for progress updates and improvement stories!

**Background:** I believe my root cause is 15 years of being a vegetarian/vegan, a woman with monthly periods, donating blood for many years, and not understanding how certain foods and drinks block iron absorption. In January I was feeling incredibly sluggish, anxious, depressed, zero focus, significantly increased hair shedding, brittle nails, always cold, etc. Honestly, symptoms I've felt for years (of varying degrees) they were just getting exponentially worse and when I didn't want to get out of bed/couldn't get out of bed I knew something was wrong. I got lab work done and found out my ferritin was 18, b12 was 369, high inflammation markers, and my zinc was low at 8.3. Surprisingly my vitamin D was fine at 76 and my hemoglobin was 13.4 so not anemic. 

**Supplements:** I started supplementing with iron, b12 sublingually, and with zinc (I've also been taking Nutrafol for many years so I continued taking this). I've been taking Pure Encapsulations Iron + Vitamin C every day for 7 weeks. I slowly increased from 30mg to 45mg to now 60mg daily. I take it on an empty stomach with no issues besides the occasional constipation (which I started taking magnesium for). I started eating meat again and focusing on red meat for iron. I also try to make a spinach smoothie for lunch each day that includes chia seeds, flax seeds, other fruits and veggies and orange juice to help the iron from spinach properly absorb. Additionally, I was incredibly strict on when I was drinking my 1 cup of coffee because it blocks nutrient absorption. Final thing I changed was purchasing the Lucky Iron Fish. I would make myself a cup of iron water and squeeze the juice of one orange in my cup and drank it warm at night. I couldn't taste the iron at all!

**Today:** I immediately noticed a difference after taking iron and b12 at about 2 weeks. I was more alert, wasn't waking up exhausted, and actually had the energy to do things after work. Granted, these were small improvements and I'm definitely not at 100% but I could tell a difference. I think a good part of it is also the mental boost that I received when I found out there was a reason for why I was feeling so terrible and that I had a plan for improvement. I feel as though I plateaued around the 4 week mark so I got a bit nervous but I just think the immediate iron and b12 supplements were a noticeable difference that everything else is just slowing improving with time. 

I just had my blood work done at the 6 week mark per my doctor to make sure I was improving/wasn't having absorption issues. My ferritin increased from 18 to 35 in a month and a half! Zinc and b12 are now in normal levels (technically b12 is too high so I'm no longer using a dropper and just taking a pill). It's been really encouraging to see it actually improved and I wanted to share all that I was doing along with a timeline as these kinds of posts were incredibly helpful for me when I was starting out and absorbing any info I could get. Especially about only supplementing as there is so much great info on here about iron infusions but I wasn't eligible/wasn't recommended as a first step with my doc. I read through the Iron Protocol on Facebook but decided to use a different brand of iron pills as my doctor described them as much cleaner. But the Iron Protocol really helped me understand ways to maximize absorption as there are so many things out there that can really impact it!

Happy to answer questions or just share a note of encouragement that things will get better. When I first joined I didn't know how I could make it to 3 months or even a month with supplementing. Take everything a day at a time and give yourself grace!

I am hoping I could get a little guidence and user experience as I am starting Dex this weekend. 

Short story. Tried LA Ritalin. (buzzy) Concerta is out. Vyvanse did not sit well at all. Dr has prescribed me 5mg x 4 per day but told me ""start with 1 tab, 2x a day but have a play around with it to see what works best for me."" - So, very little instructions (in saying that he knows I know my system very very well)

Is there any tips or tricks I need to know? Things I should be aware of? Notes? 

Normally I've always been on LA forms of stimulants, this is the first time trying SA. My normal routine is up at 5am. Meds by 6am with my coffee and toast. I drink tea from then on. No other stimulants other than sugar. As I'm generally better in the morning do I take 1 then and 2 in the afternoon? (once settled)  I have the luxury of working from home so have the ability to fumble a little, just worried I'll mess it all up and make myself ill. 

The last 10 days without medication after 6+yrs on has been an all systems check engine alarm... So looking forward to some quiet and focused time. And to have some confidence to leave the house without the jackhammer of the outside world having a dance party in my skull!

1j9tul5,https://www.reddit.com/r/RepublicanChristian/comments/1j9tul5/jesus_is_not_for_the_woke/,JESUS IS ‚ú®NOT‚ú® FOR THE WOKE,"Jesus never died on this Earth just for you to desperately grasp at reasons your sin is justified. Jesus never died just for you to stay lusting after those women. Jesus never died for you to just grasp at the littlest thread of why your lust for the same sex is justifiable. Jesus never died just for you to keep mocking others with God's Holy Word and why you are better than them‚Äîbecause you are not. You are just as broken as the man you are ridiculing. You are no spotless, shameless little angel. You are a rotten sinner, and if you do not see that in yourself, may God help you find the truth.

We think that just because we go to church, do community service, love our wife, love our country, and‚Äîoh, how we love our God‚Äîthat makes us the little spotless lamb that God intended and allows us to be stuck up and boastful in our mindset. But you are no better than the Satanist who has never tasted what grace is.

If you think that doing good works, resisting that little look at porn that one time, comparing yourself to that gay man you saw at Starbucks‚Äîthe one you always try to avoid at all costs from serving you‚Äîand when he does, you try and force that NKJV Bible talk into any nook of the words you possibly can, and going to your boastfully correct church is the Gospel, then you, my future sibling, are gravely mistaken.

Nothing you do with works, even in the name of God our Father or Christ Jesus His Son, no matter how long you try to make yourself look like that God-loving and‚Äîoh, how God-fearing‚ÄîChristian, will save you without ever accepting Jesus as your Lord and Savior. So may God help you.

If you have never accepted Him as your Lord and Savior, you can do it right there in your seat at home, in your office at work, or in your chair at school like I am right now. You do not need a physical Bible with you. You don't need to go to your local pastor this second to be saved. All you need to do is recognize that you are a sinner in desperate need of saving, which can only be fulfilled through Christ Jesus. You don't need to be feeling a rush of emotion right now, but it is okay if you are. All you need is the realization that you are a down-dirty sinner.

Romans 10:9-10 says, *""If you declare with your mouth, ‚ÄòJesus is Lord,‚Äô and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.""* (NIV)

You will still fall into temptation and sin countless times. Repent (ask for forgiveness and turn from your ways) and ask God for His forgiveness. Being saved is not a ""get out of jail free"" card that allows you to sin with no need to repent. Also, you won't one day wake up and magically no longer have that temptation or sin. It will be through hard work, pain, prayer, and constant repentance that you will overcome it. Christianity is not an easy road‚Äîfor if it were, you would be no different in your own twisted sin than that gay man serving you coffee.

We should love everyone, no matter how uncomfortable they may make us feel. 1 Corinthians 13:1-3 explains how we should love perfectly:

*""If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.""*

What it means here by ""love"" is not ""go and bang them later"" or ""accept them for who they are."" It is quite the opposite. I'll give an example of what type of love this does **not** mean:

*You walk up to the gay man at the counter. You stick your nose up with your shiny, $300 full silver cross dangling harshly on your chest. You tell him your order with a smug tone and a sly face. You don't say a single word about the Gospel to him. You just show him how good of a Christian you are. He calls your name, and as you go and grasp the coffee in his hands, you say,* **""You know I am a Christian, right? I'm only showing you what a prime example of a Christian you could be if you just stopped being gay and went to church.""** *And with a quick chuckle, you rip it from his hands and walk away, confident that you got another guaranteed saved man from the fiery pits of hell‚Äîsomething you can tell your elite Bible study group back at church. You are so proud of yourself.*

This is obviously exaggerated, but it is a prime example of a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. These types of stuck-up Christians do not help anyone spiritually in reality‚Äînot even themselves. They are only another noisy person, just screaming about their religion, ready to post on Reddit about how they were attacked by another Christian.

We need to be truly loving. That does not mean accepting whatever pronouns they want, but it does mean not treating them as less than a human being. Think of your greatest sin out of the seven deadly sins. Now think of theirs. They don‚Äôt get a ""worse than straight seven deadly gay sins""‚Äîthey are on the same exact plane of reality as us. They are lost, as we once were.

In the title of this post, I said, ""Jesus is not for the woke."" That‚Äôs a lie. In reality, we should only be saying,

Here‚Äôs the situation. Since moving in together I can only take a dump when she goes to work. Tuesday-Saturday i wake up have my coffee and hit the John after she leaves for work. (I work from home). Sunday-Monday I don‚Äôt take a dump. I started noticing pretty early on that the second she leaves for work on Tuesday morning I‚Äôm in the bathroom. 

Why does this happen? I‚Äôm not uncomfortable at all. We even joke about it when she leaves on Tuesday she‚Äôll say something like ‚Äúenjoy your shit‚Äù. My body just shuts down the poop chute the second she gets home for her weekend.

Imagine a world where buying Bitcoin is as easy as grabbing a coffee. No complicated exchanges, no lengthy verifications, just a simple machine waiting to dispense sweet, sweet satoshis. Welcome to the world of Bitcoin ATMs!

Bitcoin ATMs are popping up everywhere, from bustling city centers to gas stations on the highway. They‚Äôre like secret portals to the future of money‚Äîexcept they‚Äôre not so secret anymore! These machines have become the go-to solution for Bitcoin newbies and crypto veterans alike, making the process of buying and selling BTC as smooth as a well-executed blockchain transaction.

# What Is a Bitcoin ATM, Anyway?

If you‚Äôve never encountered one before, think of a Bitcoin ATM as a magical vending machine for crypto. Instead of inserting a dollar bill and getting a candy bar, you insert cash (or use a debit card, in some cases) and receive Bitcoin directly to your wallet. Some even let you sell Bitcoin for cash, effectively turning digital magic into tangible dollars.

Bitcoin ATMs come in two flavors:

* **One-way machines** (Buy-only): You insert cash and receive Bitcoin in return.
* **Two-way machines** (Buy & Sell): You can buy Bitcoin *and* sell it for cash.

Both types are incredibly useful, but the experience isn‚Äôt complete without an essential tool: **a Bitcoin QR code**. That‚Äôs where our handy app comes in!

# The Ultimate Bitcoin QR Code Maker

When using a Bitcoin ATM, the machine needs to know where to send your freshly purchased BTC. That‚Äôs where Bitcoin QR codes save the day. Instead of fumbling around copying and pasting long, confusing wallet addresses, you simply scan a QR code that represents your Bitcoin wallet address. It‚Äôs quick, easy, and completely eliminates human error.

But not all QR code generators are created equal! You need a **reliable** and **secure** QR code maker to ensure smooth transactions. That‚Äôs why we created [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com), the best tool to instantly generate Bitcoin QR codes.

# Why Our Bitcoin QR Code Maker Is a Game-Changer

# How to Use a Bitcoin ATM with a QR Code

Now that you‚Äôre equipped with your sleek Bitcoin QR code, let‚Äôs walk through how to use a Bitcoin ATM like a pro.

# Step 1: Find a Bitcoin ATM

The easiest way to locate one is by using a **Bitcoin ATM map** (like CoinATMRadar). You‚Äôd be surprised how many are near you!

# Step 2: Select ‚ÄúBuy Bitcoin‚Äù

Once at the machine, tap the screen and choose the option to **purchase BTC**.

# Step 3: Enter the Amount

Most ATMs allow you to select a preset amount (like $20, $100, or $500) or enter a custom amount. Some machines even ask for ID verification if you‚Äôre buying large amounts.

# Step 4: Scan Your Bitcoin QR Code

This is where the magic happens! Open your [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) app, display your QR code, and let the ATM scan it. This tells the machine where to send your Bitcoin.

# Step 5: Insert Cash

Feed your paper money into the ATM, just like you would at a vending machine.

# Step 6: Confirm the Transaction

Once you‚Äôve inserted your money, confirm your purchase. The Bitcoin will be sent to your wallet, and you‚Äôll get a receipt (either printed or digital).

# Step 7: HODL or Spend!

Now that your Bitcoin is safely in your wallet, you can HODL for dear life, spend it, or send it to a friend. The possibilities are endless!

# Why Bitcoin ATMs Are the Future

Bitcoin ATMs are gaining popularity because they offer a **fast**, **convenient**, and **accessible** way to onboard into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Unlike online exchanges that require lengthy verifications and bank transfers, Bitcoin ATMs provide a near-instant experience.

Plus, they‚Äôre particularly useful for people who:

* Prefer using cash for privacy reasons.
* Don‚Äôt want to link their bank account to an exchange.
* Need Bitcoin *right now* without waiting for a deposit to clear.
* Are traveling and need a quick way to buy or sell BTC.

# The QR Code Revolution

The use of Bitcoin QR codes in ATMs is just one example of how they simplify crypto transactions. QR codes eliminate typos, speed up the process, and make Bitcoin transfers accessible to anyone, even those who aren‚Äôt tech-savvy.

With our [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com), generating QR codes is effortless, making Bitcoin ATMs even easier to use. Whether you‚Äôre a Bitcoin veteran or a newbie trying your first crypto purchase, this tool is a must-have in your Bitcoin toolkit.

That a member of the species that landed on the moon,

Wiped out smallpox,

And changed the very climate of the earth,

Writhes in desperation.

Because he drank a little too much coffee,

And forgot about rush hour traffic.

&nbsp;

It‚Äôs an oddly meditative experience,

The shaky deep breaths,

The sweating,

The little moments of panic

When the bus goes over a slightly larger bump.

&nbsp;

For the first time

In a very long time,

The abstract clouds of modernity dissolve.

The upcoming credit card bills,

That painfully awkward conversation,

20 unread messages,

Swept away

In a roar of animal need.

The Shakespearean tragedies of human experience

Overwhelmed by unassailable instinct.

&nbsp;

Knowing that the struggles that usually haunt me

Require a listener‚Äôs open mind and years of training in therapy to accurately convey.

And even then,

the message may bounce.

&nbsp;

Yet all the emotion,

pain,

endurance,

desperation,

and irrational hope,

Every mote of meaning and urgency,

Born from a feeling beyond words,

A feeling beyond feeling,

Can be perfectly communicated with a few syllables.

&nbsp;

I really, really need to pee.
