Why you should leave:

Cons:
Constant fighting. Zero accountability.
Hard to get her to say sorry. Disrespect.
Crossing boundaries. Doing things on purpose that she knew annoyed me. Being petty.
Always having to comfort her depression and validate her feelings.
Belittling my feelings and making it all about her.
Using my porn addiction against me in arguments, even though it's a sensitive topic.
Never asking how I’m doing. It’s always her, her, her.

Pros:
She’s funny. We play together and have stupid fun, even though I’ve always had that with other people too.
The sex is good, though it usually is regardless, since I’m the active one.
She’s beautiful, I mean very, but it isn’t enough.
Physical attraction is there, or not. I’m confused.

Everything just fucking sucks.
I feel like shit. I feel like an asshole.
I can’t fake being with her anymore. It’s draining. Everything is draining.

I love Amendail (the cat), but he’s so fucking annoying sometimes. Constant clinginess and playing, even though he’s very affectionate. I do have fun with him, but he can drive me crazy.

I feel like I’m drowning in my own abyss.
As someone said in one of the comments:
“Don’t burn yourself to keep someone else warm.”
I feel like I’m losing myself. I feel lost. I feel miserable.

Is it normal to feel this way?
Am I crazy?
Do I need therapy?
Probably.

I have no one in my life besides my mom.
I can’t trust people.
I guess it’s from childhood trauma. I don’t know.

You cannot stay. You can’t.

You feel like a mess?
You’re scared to move apartments? Is it because of money?
Don’t you value your own sanity?

Even better: Do you even want to be with her?

Too many things to consider, but I feel it’s not worth it at all.
I feel numb.

“The lemon isn’t worth the squeeze.”
Stupid saying, haha, but it’s a good one.


---

Fear of her sleeping with other men:
It’s a bad feeling but a necessary one.
Remember how you always thought about this in past relationships?
It passed.
So will this.

Why do I even feel unsatisfied in relationships?
Is it to fill the void inside myself? I’m not sure.
Probably is.

I fucking hate writing this.
It’s annoying honestly, but I need to let it out.

Her goddamn birthday is soon.
And her mom is sick.
I feel like a fucking asshole for breaking up.

But should I break up?
Yes. It’s necessary.
For your own sanity.
For your own peace of mind.

Remember how you came to the big city to have a new chapter, alone?
Single?
Did you have doubts or depression?
You don’t remember any.
There was zero drama.
Your own place.
It was peaceful.


---

Dude, I’m fucking scared shitless.

Will she be violent?
Will she understand?
Will she cry?

What about my pain?

As someone said:
“You cannot zero your own pain for hers.”

You cannot satisfy her needs if yours aren’t being met.
I feel incomplete inside.
I feel like relationships are too hard for me.

But why?

Why can’t I fathom the idea of someone loving me and me loving them back?

I felt disrespected and shattered, multiple times.
Remember when you were crying late at night?
Alone?

Is that how a relationship is supposed to feel?
I don’t know.


---

Day 2:

I broke up with my girlfriend.
She cried.
It was weird.

It’s not like I wanted her to cry or be sad, but I feel nothing.

I mean, I was sad to break up with her because her birthday is soon and the thing with her mom, but I don’t feel sad for us.

Is this normal?
Or like someone said, maybe it hasn’t hit me yet.

Yet my brain is typing this. Kind of funny.
It’s kind of weird.
I remember our memories, but I mostly remember the bad ones.
I don’t understand why.

Right now I’m drinking coffee, feeling nothing toward her.

Should I be prepared for some of her pettiness?
To see her all dressed up?
Going on dates?

Do I even care anymore?

And her perfume is too sweet.
It kind of makes me a bit sick.

1ltolb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ltolb8/am_i_overreacting_for_how_uncomfortable_i_feel/,Am I overreacting for how uncomfortable I feel about his ex girlfriend?,"My partner and I have been dating for almost a year now (he’s 33 and I’m 28F) and our relationship had a rocky start since he only recently got out of a relationship. I should’ve known then that this was going to be difficult.

He was complaining to me about his ex on a lot of occasions but randomly reminisced about something she was good at. She cheated on him multiple times and talked to his sister about breaking up with him on his birthday and then broke up with him in a public spa. 

He had to get stuff back from her and he also gave her stuff back, where she asked him to stay friends which he declined. 

I talked to him about the frequency he talked about his ex and eventually he saw that some topics are inappropriate and when you date someone new, you focus on the present. 

A few weeks ago I saw that his ex was on my Instagram profile and started liking stories of my partner. I saw her account and saw that she still had couple pics of her and my partner and highlights of him being super drunk (he told me he didn’t want exes to keep pics of him, especially not of him being drunk and he didn’t know about the photos and didn’t like that that was public). Also suddenly her account was private. 
I told him about it and said I found this weird. He said it’s completely normal, that she just wants to know what he’s doing. I decided to block her and make my account private. I know if you have a public profile anyone can access your stuff, I just never had to worry about someone else’s ex looking me up online. I get being curious but this just seemed so…stupid?
He texted his ex to stop doing that (he offered to do it since he saw I was feeling odd about it) and her response was something like “ Oh I saw your sister follows her and I was just curious 🙈 I’m not gonna do that again. “ and I thought oh okay then. 

But then she apparently wrote a whole essay of asking him to be friends again, that they should meet up for coffee and spend more time together. 
For some reason she also wants to get to know me and she said she wants everyone to get along when my partner’s sister has a baby and we can all be there without drama. 
I was just thinking uhhh his sister just got her degree, why is this even relevant? It seemed like his ex had this whole detailed plan and it made me feel incredibly weird. She also said she bought coffee for my partner and that she could send it to him via mail. She also hoped him and I had a nice vacation which she could only know by looking at everything I posted. He never told her about a vacation or anything. It personally creeps me out but he keeps saying how it’s normal, how he knew she keeps wanting to be friends with him. 
I said that it makes me uncomfortable that someone who cheated and broke up with him would be so adamant to stay friends when he told her he doesn’t want any contact with her. 

We had a long discussion about it. Before he used to say he would never want to be friends with her and now he says he only currently can’t see himself being friends with her but maybe in the future. I told him that I have a bad feeling about this, she seems him with a new partner and after being told to stay way she thinks it’s okay to ask for friendship? I feel like the odd one out. As if I’m making it all up. He says my reaction to what she does is the bad thing, not what his ex is doing.

He asked me what if he wanted to be friends with her and I told him that he was a wreck when she ended it with him and he can’t expect me to see her in a positive light because of what he told me. He said I only know 1% about her and started listing things he loved about her and I was like I don’t need to know these things. It’s weird to me how you think about what could be between your ex and you in the future, when you should be thinking about our future. I know ultimatums aren’t good but I said “ If you want to be friends with your ex, do that. It’s not my place to decide that for you, I don’t want to control you or tell you what to do. What I can do is that I can leave. You have the free choice to be friends with your ex and I have the choice to end this relationship and be with someone who isn’t hung up on their ex like that. “

He said I was blackmailing him and forcing him to do things and I said no, I just can’t emotionally go through this, I’m putting myself first here. 
Eventually he wrote his ex that he doesn’t want any contact with her because it’s not good for him and then he blocked her. He said this might not be the last time she would try to reach out, since his ex reached out to his mum when him and I start dating to ask how he’s doing and what he’s doing.

He also keeps mentioning a friend of his who is friends with his ex and how it works out, only to say that when his friend got married to his now wife, the wife understandingly didn’t want his ex to be there and there was a whole lot of drama from the ex. 

Exes can 100% be friends but the way this is going, it just seems like it’s going to be a disaster. 

His ex is friends with my partner’s sister and that’s fine, it’s none of my business. I just feel like something weird is going on here but I am made to feel like I am overreacting.

I’ve been made feel guilty and like I am just jealous and insecure and it makes me really sad.

TLDR: my boyfriends ex keeps reaching out to him and it makes me uncomfortable and I am portrayed as reading too much into it

1ltokm2,https://i.redd.it/x6752erkuebf1.jpeg,Beware of the TGL Co. scam,"I recently ordered my first V60 dripper from Amazon after specifically searching for the Hario V60. The product listing clearly mentioned “Hario V60” in the title and included images of the original Hario product. The seller was TGL Co., and based on the listing, I expected to receive an authentic Hario product.

However, upon delivery, I received a TGL Co.-branded V60 dripper instead. It’s not the Hario product I paid for. Additionally, the measuring spoon included appears to be used, raising concerns that this might be a returned or previously handled item.

Even if the dripper functions similarly, I paid for a Hario product, not a substitute. The misleading listing and bait-and-switch tactics have left me feeling cheated and distrustful of the seller. If they’re willing to misrepresent the product, I can’t be confident in the safety or quality of materials used in their version.

To make matters worse, Amazon only shows an option to “replace with the same product,” and I’m unable to connect with a customer support agent to explain the issue.

I’ve had sweet-and-savoury combos before (think Royce’s chocolate-covered potato chips), so I knew I had to try this.

Having previously munched on their more out there flavours like Yusheng chips, I came in with some expectations; and honestly? It didn’t disappoint 😂

Appearance:
Just your standard potato chips dusted with coffee-flavoured powder. The coating was a bit uneven though 🙃 some chips were super powdery, others barely had anything on them.

Taste:
It’s basically plain potato chips sprinkled with what tastes like creamy 3-in-1 kopi powder. Surprisingly accurate to the kopi flavour!

Overall experience:
First bite? Wow. Super novel and fun. But the more I ate, the more the coffee flavour kinda faded into the background… by the end, it just felt like I was snacking on regular chips with a hint of something sweet.

Would I get it again?
Yeah, I think I would. Not mind-blowing but definitely a fun one to share with friends or bring to a party.

1ltojxb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ltojxb,Ashiq Ali Rahmani: A minstrel and hero.,"The minstrel, whose real name is Ali Çırçır, was born on February 17, 1942 in Erzurum. His father's name is Mustafa and his mother's name is Gülsüm. He completed primary school in Erzurum and had to leave after attending secondary school for one year. The poet, who was exempted from military service due to epilepsy, married in 1965.

Ali Çırçır, who did not have a specific profession in his youth, tried to make a living as a petitioner, kerosene seller and greengrocer for a while. In the meantime, he writes epics in which he expresses some current events and religious issues and distributes them in local printing houses. In 1973, he started working as a laborer at Atatürk University and retired on disability in 1982.

On September 25, 1978, Ali Çırçır was one of the founding members of the Folk Poets Culture Association, and between 1979 and 1981, together with Nuri Çıraği, he ran a minstrel coffee house in Erzurum's Mahallebaşı neighborhood. In late 1981, he opened a business on Congress Street under the name Kıbrıs Palas Hotel and Aşıklar Kahvesi and continued this business until 1989.

He also participates in festivals and competitions, most of which are organized by Atatürk University and the Folk Poets Culture Association. In the competitions he participated in, he was generally awarded in the branches of lebdeğmez and encounter. The minstrel, who participated for the first time in 1977 in the Konya Minstrels Festival, was last able to take part in this program in 1992. 

On October 25, 1993, Aşık Ali Rahmani, who was on his way to participate in the Konya Aşıklar Festival, was martyred by PKK terrorists in Sansa Creek on the Erzincan - Erzurum highway. The bus carrying Rahmani arrived at Sansa Creek at 19.30 in the evening. The road is blocked by PKK terrorists. Three buses and many vehicles are waiting. The bus Rahmani was on was stopped. When the terrorists climbed on the bus and started to take down the passengers with the butts of their guns, Aşık Ali Rahmani said, ""Don't be afraid of death. If death has come, we cannot escape. Don't beg these marauders,"" he shouts. When it was Ali Rahmani's turn, the minstrel struck the terrorist in the face with his staff. Surprised, the terrorist kicks him off the bus with the butt of his gun after hitting the lover's chin with all his might. The jaw and knee of the old and crippled minstrel Ali Rahmani were broken. When PKK terrorists learn that two women among the passengers are teachers, they want to kidnap them. Angered by the terrorists who wanted to drag the two young female teachers away with them, Aşık Ali Rahmani walks towards the terrorists with his cane and starts hitting them. He turns around and shouts ""run"". The passengers then started to flee. The PKK terrorists responded with a volley of gunfire; bullets hit Ali Rahmani in the head, left chest and right groin. Rahmani was martyred here after saying salāwat. As a result of the fire opened by PKK terrorists, 4 civilians, including Âşık Ali Rahmani, lost their lives.

Thanks to this heroism shown by Aşık Ali Rahmani, dozens of people and 2 young female teachers who wanted to be kidnapped were saved from the terrorists.

Ömer Tokgöz, who survived the massacre, says the following:

""I was traveling from Erzurum to Ankara by bus. When we came to Sansa Creek between Erzurum and Erzincan, we saw terrorists blocking the road. The driver wanted to hijack the bus but he failed. The terrorists came in with long-barreled weapons and took us all down. Everyone was scared and crying. Meanwhile, Aşık Ali Rahmani said, 'Don't be afraid of death. If death has come, we cannot escape. Don't beg these marauders,' he shouted. This speech encouraged everyone. The terrorists found out that two women among the passengers were teachers and wanted to take them away. Angered by the women being taken away, Rahmani started hitting the terrorists with his cane and turned to us and said 'run'. The passengers of the bus then started to flee. The terrorists opened volley fire. Ashik Ali Rahmani and two passengers were martyred there. But the lives of the teachers and other passengers on the bus were saved.""

Chapter 1

By the fifth year of our marriage, my pilot husband had been with every flight attendant around. After I was hospitalized to secure my pregnancy, he managed to insult the head of security at a promotion party due to his ongoing affair with Delilah Porter, a flight attendant. Desperate to save his career, Quinn Scott demanded that I drink coffee, urging me to beg for forgiveness on their behalf.

I looked at him in disbelief. ""I'm carrying your child. How can I drink coffee? What if something goes wrong—""

He interrupted, his voice cold with a hint of contempt. ""It's just coffee. Stop being melodramatic.""

He tightened his grip on my jaw, forcing the mug to my lips until it was empty.

Soon after, a warm sensation spread through my body, staining my white Victorian-style dress red. Delilah, tucked under his arm, turned her face away in disgust.

""Can't even hold coffee in down there?"" she mocked.

That night, I was rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment, and we lost the baby. Meanwhile, news of Quinn and Delilah checking into a hotel that evening made the headlines.

What he didn't realize was that I wasn't merely an orphan. My father had been a fighter pilot who died honorably in battle. I submitted my father's medal of honor along with the divorce papers. ""Quinn Scott's infidelity is undeniable. Can I leave now?""

\---

""Mavis, it's Quinn who's hurt you and the child. Can you give him another chance?""

Under the sterile, white lights of the hospital room, Celeste, my mother-in-law, cradled the child lost to the hospital's actions, trembling as she covered the tiny body with a blanket.

I couldn't bear it any longer. I yanked the IV from my hand and stood, blood droplets scattering on the floor. Struggling to the door, I saw Quinn holding Delilah at the nurse's station, his hand gently resting on her waist, while a doctor gave careful instructions.

""Ms. Porter is just two months along; she needs plenty of rest and regular medication,"" the doctor advised.

Delilah glanced at me from the corner of her eye, flashing a smug smile, as if to say, ""I'm not the only one who can give the Scotts a child.""

I turned to leave, but Quinn's soft voice stopped me in my tracks. ""The baby is small now, but it's worth it. The Scott family will take good care of you.""

I still had to leave behind 2 cases of farm fresh eggs, 3 boxes of tomatoes, almost all the yogurt, tons of produce,pre cheese, and a case of bolgona. I only use a grabber and didn't even climb inside for this.

I had just got a new outdoor fridge to consolidate all my mini fridges, and had to plug all the mini fridges back in. Really this is a situation where I need to give away as much as possible as quick as possible, but also it wouldn't hurt to buy a freezer when this happens. My regular fridge and chest freezer are already full and not even pictured here. 

Did I mention I am single and it's just me? One of the last pictures was an immediate purge of extra produce and other stuff I set out near one of the areas homeless people frequent. I also got 7 bags of dog and cat food tonight, and then skipped all my other spots after this hauldi. 

Last picture was bonus points from the other night when they threw out an 8k portable a/c unit. ",5,1751874984.0,DumpsterDiving,3,1.0,False

Even though I don’t bring that much stuff with me, I find that most EDC bags are too small for my liking. I think I just prefer a roomier bag with plenty of spare space, and I also feel like most water bottle pockets are way too small which is a big must for me. Right now I am between these 3 bags (all are either the X-Pac or Ultra variants): A19 Evade 1.5, Aer City Pack Pro 2, Evergoods CTB26. The problem with 2 of them is that they are sold out currently lol but I’m not in a big rush so I’m ok with signing up for restock notifications. But if I needed one today that puts Evergoods at the top since it is in stock . I like the bag overall, my only gripes being the side loading laptop pouch and the crazy $380 price tag, with the other 2 being like $100 cheaper. The potential problem with the other 2 is the water bottle pockets and just overall size. At all times I’m carrying a 26 oz yeti rambler water bottle and a 20 oz yeti tumbler and from what I’ve seen they would be a tight fit. Would love to hear from people who have 1 or more of these bags, what you like and don’t like, your use case, gear you carry, or any potential alternatives. One other option I’ve considered is the ULA dragonfly 30 but tbh it’s my least favorite in terms of looks. 

Things I carry daily: 
- iPad Pro 13 inch M4 in an ESR case 
- Kobo Libra Color (and sometimes a physical book as well)
- Rain jacket 
- Fleece jacket 
- Various chargers
- Water bottle and coffee cup I mentioned prior 
- small battery bank 
- 2 yeti coasters for 12 oz and 16 oz drink (these will probably be swapped for a Frostbuddy that I leave at work) 
- folder with documents

I had some time after work, about 1:30 in the morning. There were some places that looked like they would be interesting to go and Wood Sheesha Lounge in Kitakyushu was top on the list. 

It's on the fifth floor of a very slender building. It's a relatively small space, but it's warmth and friendliness we're perfect. The staff were very nice but they only speak Japanese. As I was fumbling to tell them what I was interested in, I guess who spoke English helped me out! He invited me to his table where I got to enjoy spending time with him and his friends. 

The staff were very hesitant to mix grape and mint for me. One of my favorites, as is strawberry mint, blueberry mint, and a few other combinations that they wouldn't make. That night, I learned that Japanese tastes are very different from many others. The folks I was spending time with wanted things that tasted like bread and coffee and sweet milk. I finally managed to get passionfruit and mint, and they did a great job! The clouds were fat and the flavor lasted for hours.

My new friends tried out the flavor but we're disgusted by it! They told me it tasted like toothpaste. Holy crap, I laughed my ass off at that.

In October 1909, a Seattle woman named Mrs. Mather began to have a recurring nightmare that her sister, Mary Short, who lived in Topeka, Kansas, was murdered by a man who poisoned her. Mary Short was a widow who lived alone.
Mary responded to her sister’s worried letters and assured her she was fine. Mrs. Mather, unconvinced, sent some money to her sister. The same day, she got a telegram from Topeka. Mary Short was dead. 
Mrs. Mather rushed to Topeka. The doctors insisted her sister died of a bad heart but Mrs. Mather knew better. A little investigation uncovered that there was a man in Mary Short’s life, a man named Fred Fanning. 
At Mrs Mather’s insistence, Fanning was questioned and admitted taking some of Mary Short’s valuables, which were recovered. Mrs. Mather was allowed to question the suspect and Fanning soon wilted under her demands that he confess. He said he put arsenic in her coffee in the form of a pest control called Rough on Rats. Fred confessed fully to the crime and even named an accomplice. It was, Mrs. Mather declared, exactly as she had foreseen it in her dreams.

Had a brief online thing with a Libra woman a while back which ended on both sides. Years later, she still watches my social media (I travel for work, so I imagine it’s because of that). 

She also just coincidentally started working at the coffee shop I always go to. 
We haven’t spoken, but she seems very tuned in. Whenever I interact with anyone in the shop (a worker, friends, etc), she’s constantly looking up/over at me as if I loudly got her attention somehow. 

Last time, I was standing in front of the counter and she called my name for my order without looking at me. I walked over and made a point to thank her directly—she just made eye contact and held it for a moment before turning away and continuing to work. 

Is this typical Libra behavior? Awkward shyness? Seriousness?

The day I turned sixteen, my childhood friend, the one who had promised to claim me as his mate the moment we both came of age, stood before the entire Griffin Pack and declared Jenna Dean as his chosen Luna. Jenna, the pretentious heiress of the Lycan Kingdom, with her golden hair and perfect smile, was everything I wasn’t. And there I stood, in the shadow of her radiance, feeling the weight of my own inadequacy.

But then, Axton Griffin, the Alpha of the Griffin Pack—a man revered for his wisdom and strength—stepped forward. His towering frame, muscles rippling beneath his tailored suit, commanded the attention of everyone in the grand hall. He looked at me, his dark eyes filled with something I couldn’t quite place, and confessed his love with a grandeur that left me breathless.

For five years, he treated me with a tenderness that felt almost too good to be true. His touch was gentle, his words sweet, and his devotion unwavering. I believed him. I believed in us. Until the day I overheard a conversation between him and his Beta, Emerie.

“Alpha,” Emerie said, her voice low but clear, “now that Jenna’s become the Lycan Princess, do you still need to keep up the charade with Sylvia?”

Axton’s response was cold, detached. “Since I can’t have Jenna, it doesn’t matter anymore. Plus, as long as I’m here, Sylvia won’t disrupt Jenna’s happiness.”

The words hit me like a blow to the chest. I stumbled back, my heart pounding in my ears. My wolf whimpered in the back of my mind, a sound of pure anguish. I had been a fool. A pawn in his game to protect Jenna.

I retreated to our chambers, my hands trembling as I opened the sacred texts Axton always kept by his side. Each page was inscribed with Jenna’s name, prayers and blessings meant for her, not me.

“May Jenna be freed from obsession; may her soul be at peace.”

“May Jenna attain all she desires, and may her love be unwavering.”

...

“Jenna, though fate hasn’t united us in this life, may I hold your hand in the next.”

The illusion of our marriage shattered in that instant. I couldn’t stay. I wouldn’t. I devised a plan, a false identity, and a staged disappearance. From now on, we wouldn’t have to meet again for an eternity.

Once the final arrangements were set for the faked death, I hung up the phone. In two more days, I would vanish forever as they wished. At that moment, a faint scent of coffee wafted in from outside. I instinctively looked up to find Axton standing in the doorway.

He crossed the room in a few strides, his presence overwhelming as always. He embraced me gently, his voice soft, “Who were you just talking to?”

“Nothing important, just something about the gallery,” I replied, trying to sound casual.

The prison gate slowly creaked open, and the harsh sunlight fell on Camila Jackson's gaunt, yellowed face.

The clothes she had worn when she entered prison now hung loosely on her frame. She had spent five dark, hopeless years behind bars, and today, she was finally walking out—her sentence served.

Dragging her leg, she limped slowly from the prison. It wasn't that she wanted to walk slowly, but that she simply couldn't manage any faster.

A black Bentley was parked by the roadside. The window rolled down, revealing a man's cold, sharp face. His eyes briefly scanned her leg before he scoffed, his disdain unmistakable. ""Five years in prison, and you're still pretending.""

Camila's heart unexpectedly gave a painful twist, and her eyes burned. He was Harry Jackson, her older brother.

Since she was fifteen and had been taken in by the Jackson family from the orphanage, she had tried everything to earn his affection.

But for the sake of his adopted sister Agnes Jackson—who shared no blood with him—he had fabricated evidence to pin a charge of attempted murder on her.

Five years later, he was still as sharp-tongued as ever, still as cold and dismissive toward her. Camila forced herself to push down the pain, pretending not to see him as she limped away.

Harry froze, thinking, 'She has actually ignored me.' In his memory, Camila would always be the one to approach him first, eager to please him in any way she could.

When he came home, she would offer him his slippers. When he was tired, she'd give him a shoulder rub. When he had trouble sleeping, she'd brew him soup to help him relax.

If he was too busy to come home for dinner, she'd wait for him, rain or shine, with a thermos at the office building.

In the three years she lived with them, his chronic stomach issues had gotten better. But ever since she went to prison, he had often woken up in pain during the night.

When he found out she was being released today, he felt an unexpected sense of relief and even canceled a multinational meeting just to pick her up.

He thought she'd be thrilled to see him, ready to tell him everything she'd suffered over the years. He never imagined she would completely ignore him, her once adoring gaze replaced with cold indifference.

The strange emptiness that grew in his chest only fueled his frustration. He gripped the steering wheel so tightly that his knuckles went white. His voice came out sharper than he intended. ""Get in the car.""

Immediately, he regretted his words. Frowning, he softened his tone. ""Mom and Dad know you're out today. They've arranged a welcome dinner for you.""

Camila thought, 'Mom and Dad?' The words felt so familiar, yet so distant. When she was at the orphanage, she'd often imagined what it would be like to have parents—she dreamed of being a pampered little princess.

She had longed for that for fifteen years. And after all those years, her wish had finally come true. She had a mom and dad now, and a tall, handsome older brother who was a powerful CEO.

But that beloved little princess wasn't her—it was their adopted daughter, Agnes, whom they had raised since childhood. Those people weren't her parents. They were Harry's and Agnes's parents.

Camila couldn't help but bitterly laugh at herself. During the three years she spent in that house, she had suffered through countless slights and cold treatment. Knowing she was unwanted, she thought, 'Why would I go back to face more misery?'

Her steps, though slow, never wavered. Her cold attitude and the stubbornness in her back were like a sharp thorn in Harry's side.

A surge of anger welled up in his chest as he slammed the car door open, quickly catching up to her with long strides. Grabbing her wrist, he yanked her toward him, his voice dripping with frustration. ""Haven't you caused enough trouble?""

Camila lost her balance and crashed heavily to the ground. A sharp, searing pain shot through her broken leg, and her face went ashen.

Harry's anger flared. ""Enjoy playing the fragile act, don't you?

""Don't forget, five years ago it was you who pushed Emily down the stairs, turning her into a vegetable. You even tried to frame Agnes for it. After five years in prison, you still haven't learned your lesson. Seems like the system hasn't done its job!""

With that, he roughly pulled Camila up from the ground, showing no pity. ""Don't think that five years in prison means you've paid for your sins. As long as Emily is unconscious, you'll never be free of guilt.

""And you still owe Agnes an apology. Get in the car. Don't make me say it again.""

Camila could only feel bitter irony at his words. She had explained countless times that it wasn't her who pushed Emily Connor—it was Agnes. But no one believed her. They all chose to stand by Agnes.

She was the real, blood-related daughter of the Jackson family, yet the entire family believed Agnes's side of the story.

Yes, she was guilty—but her crime was foolishly trying to return to that family, hoping for love and affection that wasn't hers to begin with. She knew she was wrong. She thought, 'I would change!'

She walked away, far from them, determined never to compete for her parents' or Harry's affection again. She would never be an eyesore to them again. She wondered, 'Why can't Harry accept that?'

She silently broke free from his grasp, stepping back to put some distance between them.

Her deliberate coldness only made Harry more frustrated, his chest tightening with anger. All he could think about was how she used to cling to him like a shadow, always seeking his approval.

He tried to rein in his anger, softening his tone as much as he could. ""Come home with me.""

Camila kept her eyes lowered, her expression blank, as if she couldn't care less to look at him.

Her feigned indifference only made Harry's fury burn brighter. He thought, 'Five years in prison haven't taught her much, but it has certainly made her more defiant.'

Just as he was about to snap, a voice, soft as a spring breeze, interrupted his thoughts. ""Camila.""

Camila froze. In that instant, her heart tightened painfully.

Even though it had been five years since she last heard that voice, she recognized it instantly. It belonged to her childhood friend, Owen Wilson.

She looked up to see a pair of polished leather shoes, and then heard his deep, soothing voice from above. ""Camila, congratulations on your release.""

If anyone else had said it, she would have politely thanked them. But hearing it from Owen made it sound almost mocking.

Her most trusted childhood friend, Owen—the renowned lawyer who, after graduation, took on his first case as the defense attorney for Agnes and helped convict her.

Before the trial, he had said to her, ""Camila, Agnes has never been through hardship. She won't be able to handle life in prison. Will you take the fall for her?""

Camila had thought, 'Agnes can't handle it, but I can? Just because I am used to suffering, it is my responsibility to bear the blame for Agnes's crime?'

By sending Camila to prison, he became famous in Sancho. Five years ago, he had just graduated, still a little green. Now, five years later, he was one of Sancho's most respected lawyers, exuding confidence and professionalism.

They had grown up together in the orphanage. Not siblings by blood, but closer than siblings. Whenever other kids bullied her, he would stand up for her, fiercely promising, ""As long as I'm here, no one will make you suffer, Camila.""

He had even promised that when he became a lawyer, anyone who hurt her would end up in jail.

But later, when Agnes hurt her again and again, Owen simply dismissed her, saying, ""Camila, you're just being too sensitive. Agnes isn't like that.""

And it was him who had protected those who hurt her and sent her to prison.

\*\*\*\*\*

The air was thick with silence.

The smile on Owen's face faltered, but he forced a smile and extended his hand to Camila. ""Camila, I am here to pick you up...""

Before he could finish his sentence, Camila turned to Harry. ""You said we're going home, right? Let's go.""

# Chapter 2 Miss Me?

She knew she couldn't escape. Owen, once the person she trusted most, was now the one she hated the most and least wanted to face.

Rather than dealing with Owen, she would prefer to settle for the next option—going with Harry. At least Harry had always despised her from the very beginning.

From the first day she entered the Jackson family, Harry had warned her, ""Even if you're my blood relative, the only sister I have in my heart is Agnes. You'd better behave yourself. If I find out you're bullying Agnes, I won't let you off.""

He never gave her any hope, so she never had any real expectations. In front of Harry, the psychological wounds she suffered were easier to bear. It was better than being hurt by the person she trusted most.

Prison had taught her one crucial lesson: when you had no power, no connections, and no one to rely on, the only way to survive was to minimize harm and stay safe.

So, when the other inmates made her choose between being disfigured or slapped across the face, she chose the slap. When she had to decide between being beaten or begging, she chose to beg.

When faced with the choice between drinking toilet water or barking like a dog, she chose to bark.

She had tried to fight back, but the more she resisted, the worse the beatings became. To stay alive, she had to abandon her pride and let herself be controlled.

Even when thrown into a pit of ruthless criminals, she survived by her ability to ""avoid harm and seek safety.""

Camila walked toward Harry's black Bentley. As she passed Owen, her face remained blank, and she didn't even give him a glance.

The oversized T-shirt brushed against his fingertips, and the empty sensation felt wrong—like the fabric wasn't worn by a person but hung on a clothes hanger.

Owen's hand hung motionless in the air. In that instant, it felt as if the air around him had frozen, leaving only the cold and hollow feeling on his fingertips.

Pain and loneliness flashed in his eyes. His heart felt like it was being squeezed by an invisible hand, every beat sending a dull ache through his chest.

Once, her gaze had always followed him, full of trust and dependence. They had grown up together in the orphanage, always there for each other. Whenever he called out her name, ""Camila,"" she would smile brightly and reply, ""Owen, I'm here.""

But time had passed, and now she treated him as if he were invisible, not even sparing him a glance.

Owen's lips trembled, and he opened his mouth to speak, but found his throat constricted, unable to make a sound.

Camila climbed into the car and sat in the back seat. Everywhere she looked, there were signs of a woman's presence.

The passenger seat was covered with a soft pink cushion, and the center console was lined with a row of cute strawberry bears. The rearview mirror held a pendant of a woman who looked more mature and alluring than she had been five years ago.

She smiled brightly, a picture of a pampered, well-loved daughter from a wealthy family. The expression on her face seemed to mock Camila, the so-called ""false daughter.""

Camila had thought she could remain indifferent to all of this, but seeing it with her own eyes still made her heart ache for the unfairness she had suffered.

She turned her gaze away, but it inevitably fell on the handbag beside her. Inside was a pristine white gown, its full beauty hidden, but the feathers adorning it suggested it was exquisite.

Her fingers absently traced the rough denim of her jeans. Every detail inside the car reminded her how out of place she was here. From head to toe, she wasn't worth as much as the handbag holding the gown.

She turned her gaze to the window, watching the scenery blur by.

Harry, still behind the wheel, didn't forget to lecture her. ""Mom and Dad have missed you terribly these past five years. They've cried every day, their hair has turned gray. When we get back, leave your spoiled princess attitude behind.

""I don't want to see you scheming or causing trouble with Agnes, making things difficult for Mom and Dad. If you just stay in line, the Jackson family won't treat you unfairly.""

His words hung in the air, and the silence stretched on.

When she didn't respond, Harry frowned, clearly irritated, and glanced at her through the rearview mirror. ""Camila, I'm talking to you. Are you even listening?""

Finally, Camila turned to look at him, then spoke the longest sentence she had since her release. ""According to the rules, prisoners can meet with family members or guardians during their sentence.

""Prisoners are allowed one visit a month, usually between half an hour and an hour.

""I've been in prison for five years, a total of sixty months. That means I could've had sixty visits from my family, but not a single one.

""If your parents missed me so much, why didn't they come visit? Were they too busy to spare even half an hour a month?""

Her voice was calm, but every word hit with the force of a blade, cutting through his lies.

For a moment, Harry's eyes flashed with panic and guilt. The reprimand he had planned was swallowed by the knot in his throat.

He instinctively looked away from her calm yet piercing gaze, gripping the steering wheel so tightly his knuckles turned white.

""...It's because you're so hard to handle. Mom and Dad didn't visit you because they wanted you to focus on changing your bad habits in there. They're doing this for your own good,"" he said finally.

'For my own good?' Camila thought bitterly. 'For my own good, they made me take the fall for Agnes and suffer in prison. This is the 'good' they want for me?'

She felt utterly drained. She had no desire to look at Harry anymore, so she turned her attention back to the window.

The car soon pulled into the Jackson family's garage.

Harry seemed pleased with himself. He grabbed the handbag from the back seat and quickly turned to leave.

After walking a few steps, he suddenly seemed to remember Camila, pausing and stiffening. The awkwardness on his face hadn't fully faded when he turned around.

""Go change into something proper. We're heading to the banquet hall,"" he said, then turned and left without looking back.

Five years later, the Jackson family home still felt foreign to Camila. She had never felt warmth here; it had never truly been a home. Life here was even worse than in the orphanage.

In the orphanage, though she didn't have a private room, she stayed in a sunny dormitory. When the sun rose, its light filled the entire room, creating a warm, comforting atmosphere.

She'd always loved the scent of the blankets warmed by the sun; it gave her the feeling of home.

But now, standing in what was supposed to be her home, she realized that it wasn't the scent of sun-warmed blankets she felt—it was the musty, damp smell of a place that the sunlight never touched.

She opened the door. The small room had no windows and was piled high with clutter. The only furniture was a single folding bed and an old desk. This was the storage room that had been her bedroom for three years in the Jackson family.

Harry had told her to wear a proper gown. But she thought, 'When have I ever owned one?'

Through all the years, she had only ever had her high school uniform. The T-shirt and jeans she wore now were bought with money she earned working part-time during the holidays, purchased in some second hand market for a total of 15 dollars.

She remembered how excited she was when she first wore them and asked Harry for his opinion.

He barely even glanced at her before furrowing his brow. ""What are you wearing? Why can't you dress like Agnes—graceful and appropriate? Take it off, throw it away. Don't wear that outside and embarrass the Jackson family.""

# Chapter 3 No Pocket Money

Agnes's grace and sophistication were built on wealth and resources. As for Camila, she had nothing.

The Jackson family gave her neither love nor money, yet they still blamed her for not being graceful or refined. Even now, she couldn't understand why they had brought her back.

The only purpose she seemed to serve in this family was to highlight how adored the ""real"" daughter, Agnes, was.

The person who was unloved became the third party. It felt oddly fitting in her case. The younger version of her would have been heartbroken by their unfairness, but now, she just didn't care anymore.

She looked around the storage room, and the only clothes she had to change into were her blue-and-white high school uniform.

Five years ago, she had received an acceptance letter from the top university in the country, Wasmore University. Yet the Jackson family had only thrown a grand celebration for Agnes's admission. The banquet was packed with Sancho's elite.

Eighteen-year-old Agnes, dressed in a 300-thousand-dollar haute couture gown, her hair crowned with a diamond-studded tiara, stood proudly between the Jackson couple, the center of attention, treated like a princess.

Meanwhile, she—dressed like an outcast, dragged away by the police in front of everyone—had her college years stolen away as she spent the next five years in prison.

\*\*\*\*\*

Five minutes later, Camila, now in her high school uniform, made her way toward the Jackson family's banquet hall.

As she walked, the servants passing by couldn't help but eye her with curiosity.

""Who's this? Why is she in a high school uniform?""

""She's probably a server brought in from Reagon Hotel. Looks like a high school student working part-time for the summer.""

""The Jackson family is really good to Miss Jackson. To celebrate, they even brought in the head chef from Reagon Hotel.""

""Yeah, they really went all out.""

One of the servants walked up to Camila and casually reminded her, ""The banquet's about to start. Hurry up and change into the uniform like everyone else. Don't slack off when serving the guests. The people here today are important figures from all over Sancho.""

After the servant left, Camila stood still for a moment, suddenly not wanting to go to the banquet at all.

Harry had told her that Arthur Jackson and Belinda Jackson were hosting a welcome banquet for her, but he hadn't mentioned anything about inviting outsiders.

She wondered, 'Being released from prison isn't something to celebrate. Does it really need to be such a big event?'

Years ago, she had been taken away by the police in front of Sancho's elite. Now, she thought, 'They are going to make a spectacle of my return in front of those same people?'

To her, this didn't feel like a welcome—it felt like a public display of her shame, leaving her no dignity at all. A mix of bitterness and anger rose in her chest, and she no longer wanted to stay.

She turned to leave, but just as she did, Harry approached. When he saw what she was wearing, his face immediately twisted with disdain.

He quickly walked over, his voice rising. ""Didn't I tell you to wear a gown? What are you doing in that? Don't you know what kind of event this is?""

Camila opened her mouth to explain, but Harry cut her off, not giving her a chance to respond.

""You came out of prison looking like a wreck, and now that you're home, you're trying to play the victim in front of everyone, acting like we owe you something.

""You're putting on this show, trying to make it seem like the Jackson family mistreated you. Camila, your tactics are as low as ever. You're beyond saving,"" he said.

He reached out to grab her, still muttering angrily, ""Go back and change your clothes. Don't make a fool of yourself here...""

Camila stepped aside to avoid him.

Harry missed, his fury burning even hotter. ""You dare avoid me?""

She raised her eyes to meet his, and he looked at her like she was his enemy. That look of disdain and impatience—she had borne it for three years in the Jackson family.

Every time their eyes met, it felt like her heart was being torn apart by invisible hands. Her tears of injustice would well up, but all she'd ever received in return was his accusation of ""pretending.""

Maybe she had gotten used to it, or maybe the five years in prison had stripped away her self-respect. Now, when she met his look of utter disgust, her heart felt nothing. His feelings—whether love or hate—no longer affected her in the slightest.

Camila met his gaze with cold indifference, her eyes calm but firm. ""I don't have a gown.""

At this, Harry's anger flared even more. ""No gown? Don't you know how to buy one?""

Camila took a deep breath. She knew better than to try to explain to him—he was too set in his biases, and no matter what she said, he would never believe her.

She had tried to explain before, but the more she spoke, the more he accused her of hiding something, and the more he vilified her.

She felt utterly powerless. She wasn't going to explain anymore. She simply said, coldly, ""I don't have the money.""

Harry's face twisted with frustration, his anger growing more uncontrollable by the second. ""For three years, you had everything you needed—food, clothes, and even pocket money from the company. Every month, they transferred 150 thousand dollars to your account.

""That's 3.6 million dollars over three years! Isn't that enough to buy a few decent clothes or a gown? But you chose to wear cheap, tacky stuff, just to make it look like the Jackson family has mistreated you.

""Camila, stop being so selfish. You've made your scene, and we've given you what we owe you. It's enough now. Stop acting like this.

""Enough is enough!"" he shouted.

Camila had expected this. No matter what she said, it would never be believed. She kept her gaze fixed on him, her eyes steady.

For some reason, when their eyes locked, Harry suddenly felt a pang of guilt. ""Why are you staring at me like that? I didn't say anything wrong.""

She thought, 'He didn't say anything wrong?' Camila couldn't help but laugh bitterly inside. She hadn't wanted to make a scene, but Harry's relentless attitude had awakened a dark part of her.

Her attention shifted as she noticed someone walking toward them. If she was going to make a scene, she figured she might as well make it a big one.

She had already lost all her dignity, and she didn't care anymore. But she couldn't help wondering if Harry, so obsessed with appearances, could handle this public humiliation.

""I've never received any money from the company,"" she said. ""Don't even talk about 150 thousand dollars—there wasn't even 15 dollars. If you're going to accuse me, at least come up with a decent excuse.""

Harry's eyes narrowed further in disgust. ""You really won't stop until you get yourself in trouble, will you? Camila, you're pushing me too far. Don't blame me for not sparing you any face.""

With that, he pulled out his phone and dialed the finance department, putting it on speakerphone. ""Check how much money the company has transferred to Camila's bank account every month.""

The voice on the other end of the line hesitated. ""Camila? You mean Miss Jackson?""

""Yes.""

""If it's Miss Jackson, there's no need to check.""

Harry's displeasure deepened. ""What do you mean by that?""

""Well, sir, the company's finance department has never transferred any money to Miss Jackson's account.""

""What did you say?"" Harry couldn't believe what he was hearing. He thought, 'Even if Camila isn't treated well, she is still part of the Jackson family. How can she not have received pocket money?'

That night, when she was brought back into the family, he and their parents had discussed how much pocket money to give her.

To avoid showing favoritism, they decided she should get the same allowance as Agnes—150 thousand dollars a month. He couldn't have remembered wrong.

""Didn't I tell you to handle this?""

""Sir, didn't you know? Mrs. Jackson said that Camila came from an orphanage, had a limited worldview, and kept bad company. She didn't want to spoil her by giving her 150 thousand dollars a month, so the allowance was canceled.

""At the time, she was still in high school, living comfortably at the Jackson family, with no real expenses, so they decided not to give her any pocket money...""

Harry's mind was reeling. He thought, 'The allowance was canceled? That means Camila hasn't received a single cent from the Jackson family during her entire three years here.'

""And, by the way, Mrs. Jackson increased Agnes's allowance to 300 thousand dollars a month, since she was worried that Agnes might feel upset with Camila's return.

""The extra 150 thousand dollars was meant to compensate Agnes for any hurt feelings. I'm sure you knew about this, sir.""

Harry felt like he'd been punched in the gut. He couldn't breathe. He didn't know.

# Chapter 4 They Know Nothing

The crowd around them continued to grow, all listening intently to the voice coming from the phone speaker. The shock was palpable.

Though the Jackson family wasn't the wealthiest in Sancho, they were still one of the most prominent. For children in wealthy families, having tens of thousands of dollars or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in pocket money each month was completely normal.

But none of them had ever heard of a wealthy family's daughter who didn't receive a single penny in pocket money. The Jackson family was the only exception.

They thought, 'No wonder Camila looks so poorly dressed and doesn't even have a decent gown for the banquet.'

Even if she hadn't been raised by them, Camila was still the Jackson family's real daughter. Their biological child got nothing, but their adopted daughter was spoiled with 300 thousand dollars a month.

If the Jackson family allowed something like this to leak out, it was clear that they had no idea how to handle things.

Whispers spread like wildfire through the room, and Harry felt an uncomfortable heat rise at the back of his neck. His face turned bright red with shame. He couldn't believe such an embarrassing thing was happening in the Jackson family.

He thought, 'We are a prominent family, rich and well-established—how can we be so stingy when it comes to pocket money for our own flesh and blood?'

Harry snapped, his voice sharp and cold. ""Even if the company didn't give you money, your parents must have given you something, right?""

Camila gave him a look of mockery, then shifted her gaze to Arthur and Belinda in the crowd. ""Mr. Jackson, if you want to know whether Arthur and Belinda gave me any pocket money, why don't you ask them directly?

""You clearly don't believe me, but I'm sure you'll believe your own parents.""

Arthur and Belinda froze, both too ashamed to look her in the eye.

""Dad, Mom, you did give her pocket money, right?"" Harry asked, looking at them seriously.

Arthur looked away, his voice faltering. ""I thought you would give it to her, so I...""

Belinda's eyes filled with guilt as tears welled up. She spoke softly, ""I thought you were going to... Camila, why didn't you tell me you were struggling with money? If you had told me sooner, I would have given it to you.

""It's my fault. I didn't notice sooner, and I let you suffer. But you need to believe that I treated you and Agnes equally.""

Camila looked at her with a half-smile, her gaze indifferent. Under her cold stare, Belinda awkwardly lowered her eyes.

It was only today that Camila realized it was Belinda, her own mother, who had prevented the finance department from giving her money.

And not only that, but she had raised Agnes's allowance to 300 thousand dollars, as if afraid her precious adopted daughter might feel slighted.

The double standard was appalling, and yet Belinda still claimed to treat them equally.

A woman who lived in luxury, with high-end clothes and accessories, couldn't possibly have failed to notice that her own daughter was wearing clothes that added up to no more than 30 dollars.

It wasn't that she didn't notice; she just didn't care. Her apology was nothing more than a shallow act for appearances' sake.

Luckily, Camila had long seen through this family's ugliness. Her heart had been hardened over the years, immune to their cruelty. Without any expectations left, she was unwavering.

As Camila ignored Belinda's apology, publicly humiliating the Jackson family in front of everyone, any trace of guilt Harry had felt vanished completely.

He snapped, ""Can't you speak for once? We're not mind readers. How were we supposed to know what's in your head? If you'd said something earlier, do you think we'd have let you go without money?""

""I said it."" Camila's voice was soft but cold. ""It's just that you didn't take me seriously.""

Harry frowned, about to deny it, when a memory suddenly flashed in his mind. It was an afternoon, and the four of them were sitting together on the sofa, laughing and chatting.

Camila awkwardly walked over, clutching the hem of her school uniform. Before she could speak, her face had already turned bright red. She hesitated for a long time before whispering, ""Dad, Mom, can you give me 1500 dollars for my tuition...?""

Harry slammed the newspaper onto the coffee table, glaring at Camila and scolding her, ""Money, money, money! That's all you think about! You come home just to ask for money, don't you?

""If the Jackson family had no money, would you even bother coming back? I really don't know why your mother and I brought you back.

""If you don't have anything else to do, just study more. Agnes got tenth place in the whole school for the first exam. Where did you place?""

""I... I got first...""

""Enough! You're dead last, and you still have the nerve to mention it?""

He thought he had already arranged for the finance department to deposit 150 thousand dollars into her bank account every month, but she still had the audacity to ask for 15 million dollars.

He had thought, 'Agnes doesn't even have that much money—does she even think about what she has done to deserve it?'

Tears immediately welled up in Camila's eyes, as if she had been deeply wronged.

He only felt irritated and lost all interest in reading his financial news.

Fortunately, Agnes was sensible. She shook his arm and acted cute. ""Harry, I got tenth place this time. Do I get a reward?""

He could never resist Agnes, his adorable little sister. He immediately forgot about the unpleasantness caused by Camila and pinched her small face, indulgently saying, ""Agnes, what do you want as a reward?""

""I saw a bag worth 30 thousands dollars. Can you buy it for me, Harry?""

""Alright, alright. As long as you like it, I'll buy it for you. Don't even say 30 thousands dollars—I'll buy it even if it's 300 thousand dollars.""

After coaxing Agnes, he turned back to Camila, clearly annoyed. ""Why are you still standing there? Go back to your room and study.""

Camila, feeling deeply wronged, turned and ran off.

Both Arthur and Belinda sighed at the same time. ""If only Camila were as sensible as Agnes.""

\*\*\*\*\*

""Mr. Jackson, did you finally remember?"" Camila's voice snapped him out of his thoughts, and each utterance of ""Mr. Jackson"" felt like a sharp pain in his chest.

He was her brother—her real brother, not some ""Mr. Jackson."" But since she was released from prison, she hadn't even called him ""Harry"" once.

His expression hardened, and he spoke through gritted teeth, ""It's still because your grades were so terrible. You ranked dead last, and you still have the nerve to ask for money. I'm too embarrassed to reward you.""

Camila's eyes grew colder. Under such a cold gaze, Harry felt an unfamiliar sense of guilt. He gritted his teeth and snapped, ""What, have anything to say?""

""For three years of high school, I was ranked first in my grade every year. How is it that, in the mouth of you, Mr. Jackson, I've become last in the grade?""

Seeing the disbelief on his face, Camila let out a cold laugh, a hint of satisfaction creeping into her voice. ""Well, I suppose it makes sense.

""Mr. Jackson, you don't even know which school I go to, so it's understandable that you don't know anything about my academic record.""

Harry stood frozen, struck as if by lightning. His mind couldn't process what he had just heard. His voice trembled with barely concealed shock. ""Aren't you attending Peroz High School?""

Peroz High School was the best elite school in Sancho, and Agnes had graduated from there. It was the school where all the children from wealthy and powerful families in Sancho were sent.

Harry had naturally assumed that Camila went to Peroz High School too.

He quickly turned to look at Arthur and Belinda, his voice shaking with panic. ""Dad, Mom, when Camila came back, did you transfer her records here?""

Arthur's face turned bright red. He opened his mouth but could only produce a few muffled sounds. It was as if all his strength had been drained, and the authority he once commanded was completely gone.

Belinda's lips quivered, her eyes full of panic and confusion. Her carefully applied makeup couldn't hide the embarrassment on her face.

The two of them stood there, frozen, as if the air had thickened around them.

Harry's face turned pale. Everything he thought he knew about Camila crumbled like a collapsing building. The contempt and disdain he had felt before now seemed like sharp knives, cutting into him.

His voice faltered as he struggled to speak, his throat tightening. ""Camila... where did you go to high school?""

# Chapter 5 Banquet Not For Her

Camila's life was ruined, and only then did Harry think to care about her academically.

She thought, 'How ironic.' She had spent ten years working tirelessly, hoping to change her fate. Just as her efforts were about to pay off, they were crushed by the weight of power.

With one careless remark from the Jackson family, her fate was sealed, and in an instant, she was cast into the deepest pits of hell.

She could have had a bright future. Her family background had never been as strong as others', but the one thing she could count on was her extraordinary effort and dedication to her studies.

Her dream was to attend a top university, then pursue graduate studies and a PhD.

She wanted to become a professor and stand in front of a classroom, using her knowledge and experience to change the lives of people like herself. But reality slapped her hard in the face.

She didn't become the person she wanted to be. Instead, she became a convict despised by society, a stain that would forever remain on her record.

As she thought about this, Camila's hands tightened into fists, her nails digging into her palms without her even noticing.

""Sancho High School,"" Camila said softly, her voice almost gentle.

But those words—""Sancho High School""—weighed heavily, like a thousand-pound stone, pressing down so hard that Arthur, Belinda, and Harry could hardly breathe.

Sancho High School was the most prestigious high school in Sancho, with the highest entrance scores. Unlike Peroz High School, which admitted anyone with money, Sancho High School only cared about scores, not wealth.

The fact that Camila had been able to maintain the top spot in her grade year after year proved that she was one of the best of the best. With her academic record, getting into to top universities was a foregone conclusion.

""Impossible, you're lying,"" Harry said, his voice trembling slightly. ""Sancho High School is in the suburbs, over 30 miles from here. Back then, you used to ride that old bicycle every day...""

Halfway through his sentence, Harry froze, suddenly realizing something, and couldn't bring himself to say any more.

Seeing his face turn pale, Camila couldn't help but smirk, her expression filled with disdain. ""I'd rather ride a bicycle than go to school with Agnes, because we weren't even at the same school.

""I never ate breakfast with you because Sancho High School had early self-study at 6 AM. I had to wake up at 4 AM and ride my bike for two hours just to get to school.

""I never came home for lunch, because the time between school and lunch wasn't enough for me to ride back. I didn't have money to eat, so I had to drink more water just to make it through the day.

""By the time I got home, you'd already eaten, and I was stuck eating leftovers. And then you'd say I was born unlucky, that I always ate the leftovers like I was a beggar, wolfing it down like I hadn't eaten in days...""

""Camila, I'm so sorry,"" Belinda cried, her tears flowing freely. ""I didn't know you were suffering so much. It's all my fault.""

""You didn't owe me anything,"" Camila said, watching Belinda cry. Her own heart was as still as water. ""I grew up without you. I understand that you don't have any feelings for me.

""I got used to it long ago. No matter how tough things were, I never felt sorry for myself. Mrs. Jackson, don't you agree?""

As she heard this, Belinda's sobs caught in her throat.

""Camila, I'm begging you. You're stronger than Agnes, you can endure more. You took care of yourself in the orphanage, so I believe you'll get used to prison, too. Please, just take the fall for Agnes,"" Belinda had once said to Camila.

The memories buried for five years suddenly came flooding back. Belinda was deeply shaken, clutching her chest as though she might faint at any moment.

Camila watched Belinda, who looked like she might collapse, and felt nothing but contempt.

When Agnes pushed Emily down the stairs, there was surveillance footage. But as soon as it happened, Belinda deleted the footage that could have proven Camila's innocence, which led to her being unable to defend herself in court.

""That's enough!"" Harry snapped coldly. ""Stop with the sarcasm. Yes, we overlooked you, but don't you have any responsibility in this? You were jealous of Agnes's life, so you deliberately bullied her as a way to get back at us.

""You're bitter, unlikable, and instead of looking at your own faults, you choose to blame us.""

""Harry, don't talk about your sister like that,"" Belinda sobbed.

""Mom, you're still defending her? She's been getting worse because of how we've tried to make up for her. She wouldn't have done what she did otherwise.

""She pushed Emily down the stairs, causing her to fall into a vegetative state, and framed Agnes for it. We sent her to prison for five years, and now she's holding a grudge, making a scene in front of all the guests.""

Belinda hesitated, guilt flickering in her eyes. She quickly looked at Camila, who was watching her with a knowing, almost mocking smile. Belinda's heart skipped a beat, and she couldn't meet Camila's gaze, looking away in shame.

""Alright, enough of this,"" Arthur said, frowning slightly and speaking with authority. ""Camila, why didn't you let us know you were coming home? If we had known, we would've prepared a dress for you.""

Camila froze. ""You didn't know I was released today?""

""Of course not. If we had known, I would've had the driver pick you up. How did you get here?""

Camila turned her cold, piercing gaze on Harry. ""I came in Mr. Jackson's car, because he said you were throwing a welcome-home banquet for me.""

""A welcome-home banquet? Isn't today Agnes's birthday party?""

""Yes, the invitation I got said it was Agnes's birthday celebration. When did it turn into a welcome-home banquet?""

""You want us to give a welcome-home banquet for a convict? Is this a joke?""

People around them started whispering in hushed tones.

Harry's face flushed with embarrassment. He opened his mouth to explain, but after stammering for a while, no words came out.

Namaskar everyone! 👋

I was born and brought up in Kolkata until my late-teen years before relocating, and now I’m back in the city for a couple of months after a long time. Super excited to reconnect with my roots and rediscover this beautiful (and chaotic 😄) city with a fresh perspective.

I’d love some recommendations on:

Cool places to visit or hang out – both touristy and offbeat gems welcome!

Weekend scenarios, pubs or bars – places with good music, chill vibes, decent crowd, maybe a place to meet new people?

Casual dating scene – how’s the vibe in Kolkata these days? Are dating apps active? Any popular spots people hang out for casual meetups?

Food! – especially looking for:

Healthy/nutritious bowls or cafés with clean eating options

Iconic street food or restaurant must-trys (nostalgic and new!)

Hidden gems for great coffee or brunch


Open to all kinds of suggestions — I want to experience the best of modern Kolkata while also reconnecting with its old-school charm. Would really appreciate any tips, do’s/don’ts, or just cool stories about how the city’s changed!

Thanks in advance! ❤️",2,1751873122.0,kolkata,0,0.75,False

Ive only ever used a Breville Barista a few years ago, and shamefully it’s been instant coffee since then. 
So maybe it kind of goes without saying that this sub reads as a foreign language to me🙃
I’m committed to the bit though, and so far it’s been relatively straightforward…? I think. 
I’m probably doing half the things wrong, but my main question right now is if getting the portafilter into the machine is really supposed to be as difficult as it’s been. I have to hold onto the machine and push the handle just to get it tight enough. Picture this: 8am in my kitchen, I have machine in a chokehold, my arms about to start shaking from pushing the handle, and my mom says “do you need some help?”🥲 As an act of rebellion, I decided to not tighten it quite as much. This did in fact result in quite the incident. I feel like I’m doing something very wrong, lol. 
So if anyone has tips, that would be great. 
Other than that, suggestions on tampers and other fun accessories would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!! ",1,1751872768.0,gaggiaclassic,5,0.67,False

Typically, it’s just a shot of espresso with the rest of the cup filled with steamed milk, and to me it usually just tastes like milk with a faint coffee aftertaste.

Since I’m still practicing my espresso shots, I often end up with under-extracted (sour) or over-extracted (too bitter) shots, which I then use as double shots in a cappuccino. And even though those espressos on their own would be quite unpleasant, the cappuccinos I make with them actually turn out really delicious — at least to my taste!

Ever find yourself staring blankly at your to-do list, feeling like a deer in headlights? 😵‍💫 *Yeah, me too.* It’s like, ""Focus? In this economy?!"" 😂 We’ve all dabbled in those tips and tricks to get that calm, laser focus—you know, drinking gallons of coffee or striking a *wonder woman* pose in the mirror. Anyone else tried that one? 🙋‍♂️

But here's the kicker—what if I told you that instead of power-posing like a superhero, you just needed to sit for **two minutes** and breathe? Sounds too good to be true, right? *Well, buckle up* because science says it's legit. 🧠🔬

So here's the lowdown:

- **Power Posing? Pffft.** While it's a fun confidence boost momentarily, research suggests you might not get lasting physiological benefits. *Sorry, Superman!*

- **The Science-Backed Secret:** What’s been shown to actually tame our stress monster is…drum roll…**breathing techniques!** Specifically, a **2-minute controlled breathing session** that works wonders on cortisol levels, easing your ‘fight or flight’ mode into ‘rest and digest.’ 🌬️

- **Why Breathing Works:** It's all about engaging the vagus nerve, triggering a calm state in your body. *Cool, right?* Imagine sending a memo to your brain saying, ""Chill, we got this!"" 📧

Here’s a simple one to try:

1. **Sit comfortably** and close your eyes. Picture yourself on a beach if that helps. 🌊
   
2. **Inhale slowly** for a count of 4. Imagine you’re inflating a balloon inside your belly. 🎈

3. **Hold your breath** for another 4 counts—this part is like marinating your vibes. 😌

4. **Exhale deeply** for a count of 6 or 8, your choice! Pretend you're gently blowing out a birthday candle. 🎂

5. **Repeat** for 2 minutes and notice the shift. Did you feel a bit more zen-like?

Seriously, give it a whirl next time you feel the urge to scream into the void. 😂 I found myself more collected, and honestly, who doesn’t want a clearer, calmer headspace?

Have any quirky techniques you swear by for calm focus? Spill the beans (or maybe breathe them out slowly, y'know? 😉) Curious if anyone else here kicked the power pose to the curb after trying this!

1ltnon3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Habits/comments/1ltnon3/how_to_unfck_your_motivation_after_months_of/,How to Unf*ck Your Motivation After Months of Doing Nothing,"I spent like 8 months last year in full zombie mode. Zero motivation. Zero drive. Couldn't even be bothered to be productive some days. So I went full detective mode on myself, tested a bunch of shit, and actually figured out how to get my motivation back.

(This is organized by levels, but honestly, it all connects.)

LEVEL 1: The Basics (Do These First)

● STOP LYING TO YOURSELF:

Write down what you ACTUALLY do all day. Not what you think you do. Track it for 3 days. The results will hurt, but you can't fix what you won't acknowledge.

● CLEAN YOUR DAMN SPACE:

Your environment affects your brain more than you think. Messy room = messy thoughts. Start with your bed. Make it every morning. Takes 2 minutes, gives you one instant win.

● DITCH THE ALL-OR-NOTHING BULLSH\*T:

Stop planning perfect routines you'll never stick to. Instead of ""I'll work out for 2 hours,"" commit to putting on workout clothes. That's it. Momentum builds from there.

● KILL THE ENERGY VAMPIRES:

Social media rabbit holes, toxic people, doom-scrolling news. Cut this shit out. Your brain has limited bandwidth. Stop wasting it on garbage.

● MOVE (EVEN TINY AMOUNTS):

Quick Walks: Even 5 mins around the block. Gets your blood moving.

Desk Push-ups: 5 against your desk. Sounds stupid, works great.

Dance Like an Idiot: Put on one song. Move your body. I don't care how you look.

LEVEL 2: The Game-Changers

● FIND YOUR DOPAMINE LEAKS:

Realized I was getting easy dopamine hits from phone games, Netflix binges, and junk food. My brain had no reason to work for harder rewards. Cut the cheap hits, and suddenly real accomplishments felt good again.

● THE 2-MINUTE RULE:

Any task under 2 minutes? Do it NOW. Reply to that text. Put dishes in the dishwasher. File that document. Stops the mental pile-up that kills motivation.

● IDENTITY SHIFT:

Instead of ""I want to be productive,"" I started thinking ""I'm someone who shows up."" Small change, massive difference in how I approached tasks.

● BATCH YOUR DECISIONS:

Meal prep Sundays. Lay out clothes the night before. Automate what you can. Decision fatigue is real, and it murders motivation.

LEVEL 3: The Psychological Stuff

● EMBRACE THE SUCK:

Stopped waiting to ""feel motivated."" Started doing things BECAUSE I didn't feel like it. Motivation follows action, not the other way around.

● TRACK WINS, NOT FAILURES:

Kept a ""done"" list instead of a to-do list. Wrote down everything I accomplished, no matter how small. Folded laundry? Goes on the list. Answered emails? List it.

● ACCOUNTABILITY WITHOUT SHAME:

Found one person to check in with weekly. Not to judge, just to witness. ""This week I did X, next week I'm aiming for Y."" No guilt trips, just gentle pressure.

● MORNING MOMENTUM:

First hour of the day sets the tone. No phone, no news, no social media. Just 3 simple tasks that make me feel like I'm winning before 9 AM.

LEVEL 4: The Advanced Stuff

● REVERSE ENGINEER YOUR EXCUSES:

Made a list of my top 5 excuses. ""I'm too tired."" ""I don't have time."" ""I'll start Monday."" Then I systematically removed each excuse. Tired? Go to bed earlier. No time? Track where time actually goes.

● MICRO-REWARDS:

Set tiny rewards for completing tasks. Finished that report? 10 minutes of guitar. Cleaned the kitchen? One episode of something good. Train your brain that work = good things.

● THE SUNDAY RESET:

Every Sunday, 30 minutes to:

Review what worked/didn't work this week

Set 3 priorities for next week

Prep anything that'll make Monday easier

● ENERGY MANAGEMENT > TIME MANAGEMENT:

Tracked when I had the most energy vs. when I had the least. Scheduled hard tasks during peak energy times. Stopped fighting my natural rhythms.

LEVEL 5: The Uncommon Stuff

● CREATIVE CONSTRAINTS:

Gave myself artificial deadlines and limitations. ""I have 25 minutes to write this email."" Pressure creates focus when motivation is low.

● BODY DOUBLING:

Worked alongside someone else (in person or on video call). Didn't matter what they were doing. Just having another person ""working"" nearby kept me accountable.

● THE PHONE IN ANOTHER ROOM:

Not on silent. IN ANOTHER ROOM. The 10 seconds it takes to go get it is enough to break the autopilot reach.

● CELEBRATION RITUALS:

Created specific ways to celebrate wins. Finished a big project? Victory dance. Completed a hard week? Special coffee. Sounds cheesy, but it works.

THE MOST OVERLOOKED FIXES:

● ADDRESS THE REAL PROBLEM:

Sometimes ""lack of motivation"" is actually depression, burnout, or being in the wrong situation entirely. Don't just optimize productivity if you need therapy or a career change.

● SLEEP LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT:

Motivation crashes when you're exhausted. Dark room, cool temp, same bedtime. Non-negotiable.

● STOP CONSUMING MOTIVATION CONTENT:

Watching motivational videos becomes a substitute for actual action. Limit yourself to one piece of motivational content per week, max.

I caught my husband cheating – right in my best friend's bed.  
  
There was my husband Milo Harrison, who couldn’t get it up for three years, desperately pounding my best friend Gina Reed.  
  
I whipped out my phone and snapped their fucking from every conceivable angle.  
  
Then I packaged the whole collection and sent to Gina's husband.  
  
Along with a sweet message: \[Congratulations, Oliver! Your wife's a genius healer! She juet cure my husband's impotence!\]  
  
""Well, honey, how's your impotence sure cleared up this fast?""  
  
I leaned against the doorframe with a sickeningly sweet tone.  
  
The two naked bodies on the bed instantly froze.  
  
My husband Milo looked at me like he'd seen a ghost, stammering without getting a single word out.  
  
My dear friend Gina was quicker on the uptake – she grabbed the sheets and wrapped them around herself.  
  
""Rita... we can...""  
  
""Don't rush to explain."" I pulled out my phone.  
  
""Let me get a picture first. This is the first time in three years of marriage I've seen my husband's dick this... perky.""  
  
Milo threw off the covers and lunged for my phone. I nearly got blinded by his swinging penis.  
  
""Whoa there, honey, easy does it. Why so worked up? It's not like I haven't seen it before.""  
  
I stepped back.  
  
""Oh wait, actually I haven't seen it like THIS – since you've been keeping your V-card for my bestie this three years. How thoughtful of you.""  
  
Gina's cheeks flushed red: ""Rita, let me explain. This isn't what you think.""  
  
I smiled at her: ""Explain what? You sacrificed yourself to cure my husband's ED. I should be kissing your feet in gratitude?""  
  
""You two go on. I'll just call Oliver Harrison and have him come watch his wife's sexy performance.""  
  
Gina's face went ghost white.  
  
She was Milo's brother‘s wife, my sister-in-law, and my best friend.  
  
Ah, What a fucking mess of relationships.  
  
""You wouldn't dare!"" Milo roared.  
  
I raised an eyebrow: ""You did it. Why the hell wouldn't I?""  
  
Gina suddenly threw herself at my legs.  
  
""Rita, please, don't tell Oliver. I know I screwed up.""  
  
Looking at my childhood friend, now half-naked and clinging to my legs, I suddenly found it ridiculious.  
  
""Gina, get up first.""  
  
I bent down and patted her shoulder: ""The floor's cold.""  
  
She looked up at me hopefully.  
  
I continued: ""With that pitiful face, you’re gonna break my husband’s heart.""  
  
Then I turned to leave, and Milo grabbed my arm.  
  
""What are you trying to do? You want to destroy our family?""  
  
I clenched my fists, smiling sweetly.  
  
What a shameless thing to say.  
  
""I need to go to the hospital for some tests to figure out why my husband is impotent with me but fucks everyone else so hard.""  
  
Milo's face turned bright red: ""Rita Collins, cut the sarcasm!""  
  
""Ohoh, calm down."" I held up my phone.  
  
""Want to see the photos I just took? Great composition, angles, lighting – they'd probably go viral on tiktok.""  
  
Gina lunged for my phone, but I dodged.  
  
I grinned: ""Oh, should I add a caption? How about 'My Husband and Best Friend's Sweet Moments'?""  
  
""You—!"" Gina was shaking with rage.  
  
Just then, my phone rang. Oliver's call.  
  
I hit speakerphone: ""Hey, Oliver.""  
  
""I'm downstairs. What's the apartment number?""  
  
Oliver's deep voice filled the room.  
  
Gina's pupils contracted, her whole body visibly trembling.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Footsteps echoed from the hallway.  
  
I leisurely leaned on my chair and pulled out my phone, hitting record.  
  
Oliver pushed through the door, his face stone-cold as he scanned the room.  
  
His gaze swept over half-naked Gina, then locked onto his panicked brother's face.  
  
""Bro...""  
  
Milo's voice was shaking like crazy.  
  
Oliver said nothing, just turned to me: ""You recording this?""  
  
I blinked, then quickly nodded like a good student: ""Yep.""  
  
Gina collapsed to the floor, tears streaming down her face.  
  
""Honey, this isn't what you think...""  
  
""Shut up.""  
  
Two simple words, but Gina clammed up like someone had grabbed her by the throat.  
  
I sat there watching this unfold, feeling weirdly detached from it all.  
  
I'm the one who got betrayed. I should be the most devastated person here.  
  
But instead, I sat there like a spectator, coldly watching this whole shitshow unfold.  
  
""Both of you, get dressed. Now."" Oliver's voice was ice-cold.  
  
Watching them scramble into their clothes, I almost wanted to laugh.  
  
This whole scene felt like a trashy TV drama.  
  
Once they were decent, Oliver grabbed Milo and landed two solid punches across his face.  
  
Then came a brutal knee to the gut. I watched Milo double over, clutching himself, his lips going white.  
  
After years of faking impotence, looks like he might actually achieve it now.  
  
My brother-in-law always seemed so refined and gentle. Who knew he could get this savage when pissed.  
  
After Milo hit the floor, Oliver finally spoke: ""Spill it. How long?""  
  
No one answered.  
  
""I asked you how fucking long!"" Oliver roared.  
  
Even I jumped.  
  
Gina sobbed: ""Three... three years...""  
  
Three years.  
  
Exactly how long Milo and I had been married.  
  
So he'd been lying to me from day one.  
  
All those excuses, all that bullshit about his ""condition"" – pure lies.  
  
I spoke up, my voice dripping with sarcasm:  
  
""So you two are true love? Started before Milo and I even got married?""  
  
Milo kept his head down.  
  
""Look up! Look at us when we're talking to you!"" Oliver bellowed again.  
  
Milo slowly raised his head, eyes full of terror: ""Oliver... I...""  
  
""Don't call my name!"" Oliver's voice was pure rage.  
  
""You're not my brother, you're a fucking bastard.""  
  
Milo went pale as a ghost.  
  
Gina suddenly dropped to her knees: ""Honey, I'm sorry... I really know I screwed up...""  
  
I added: ""You know you screwed up, or you're just scared now?""  
  
If I hadn't caught them, who knows how long they would've kept us wearing these green hats.  
  
I stood up and faced Oliver: ""Got everything on video. Let's go – this place is disgusting.""  
  
Oliver nodded and turned to leave.  
  
""Wait! Don't go!"" Milo panicked and dropped to his knees.  
  
I turned back with the sweetest smile:  
  
""Stay for what? Watch you and your sister-in-law go for round two?""  
  
""Besides, you want to be with your brother's wife so badly – we're doing you a favor.""  
  
""No! Honey, we can't get divorced!"" Gina shrieked.  
  
Oliver was more successful than my husband, never let her want for money. Now she probably couldn't bear to give that up.  
  
Guess compared to Milo's love, she cared more about Oliver's bank account.  
  
""You're always working, I got so lonely and made this stupid mistake. Please forgive me just this once, I swear I'll never see him again, please?""  
  
Gina looked absolutely heartbroken, even I felt a little sorry for this ‘poor beauty’.  
  
But Oliver didn't even glance her way.  
  
""No way.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
""You bitch! Get your ass out here!""  
  
Bright and early in the morning, there was screaming and wailing coming from the company lobby.  
  
I was in my office drinking coffee when a colleague told me Gina's mom had come looking for trouble. I nearly spit out my coffee.  
  
This plot development is so melodramatic.  
  
""Rita Collins, you shameless homewrecker! Seducing my son-in-law and destroying my daughter's marriage – do you have any fucking shame left!""  
  
Gina's mother had serious lung power, standing at the reception desk acting on a whole dramatic show.  
  
My colleague Kevin rushed over: ""Rita, Gina Reed's mom is downstairs causing a scene, saying you seduced her son-in-law...""  
  
I leisurely set down my coffee cup: ""Oh, well then I better go see this.""  
  
When I got to the lobby, Gina's mom was wiping away tears while trashing me to anyone who'd listen.  
  
""Everyone listen up! This woman was so jealous that my daughter married into a rich family, so she had to stick her nose in and wreck my daughter's perfect family!""  
  
I leaned against the reception counter, grinning as I watched this comedy show.  
  
The receptionist looked relieved when she saw me: ""Mrs. Reed, Manager Collins is here.""  
  
Gina's mom whipped around, getting even more pissed when she saw how relaxed I looked: ""Well look who finally dares to show her face!""  
  
""Why wouldn't I?"" I raised an eyebrow.  
  
""Should I hide like some people do after they get caught doing nasty shit?""  
  
Gina's mom's face turned bright red.  
  
""Stop twisting the facts! My daughter and son-in-law were perfectly happy until you destroyed their family.""  
  
I cut straight to the point: ""Which son-in-law are we talking about here? The older one or the younger one?""  
  
She looked confused: ""What older and younger?""  
  
I had a lightbulb moment: ""Oh! You don't know? Let me tell you then.""  
  
""Your daughter Gina Reed is married to Oliver Harrison – that's your older son-in-law.""  
  
""But she's also screwing Milo Harrison – that's your younger son-in-law.""  
  
""So I'm genuinely curious – which son-in-law are you referring to?""  
  
All my colleagues gasped.  
  
Gina's mom's expression shifted: ""That's... that's complete bullshit!""  
  
I pulled out my phone.  
  
""Want to see the video? I recorded your daughter getting pounding by the younger son-in-law.""  
  
She panicked: ""You... don't you dare!""  
  
I continued: ""If you really cared about your daughter, you'd go home and tell her to stop stirring up shit.""  
  
""The divorce papers are already filed. What's the point of coming here to make a scene?""  
  
She got frantic: ""My daughter can't get divorced!""  
  
I laughed: ""What is it – can't bear to give up the older son-in-law's money, or think the younger one's not good enough?""  
  
Gina's mom was so mad she stomped her feet, but she knew she wouldn't get anywhere here and stormed off.  
  
My colleagues all looked at me with admiration.  
  
Kevin came over: ""Rita, that was fucking awesome!""  
  
I smiled: ""Awesome? That's just the warm-up act.""  
  
Back in my office, I texted Oliver:  
  
\[Your former mother-in-law just caused a scene at my company.\]  
  
Oliver replied quickly: \[Need me to handle it?\]  
  
Me: \[Nah, I took care of it.\[  
  
Oliver: \[Thanks.\]  
  
Looking at my phone screen, I couldn't help thinking life was full of surprises.

Tired of fake smiles and shallow love, he stepped away from the empire his father left him and started living a simple life as a barista in a small café in Seattle. His clothes were modest, his car old, and his apartment plain. But his mind? Sharp. His heart? Guarded.

He met Emily Dawson on a rainy Tuesday.

She walked into the café with soaked hair and a furious look in her eyes. “Coffee. Strong,” she demanded, not even looking at him.

Daniel chuckled, handed her a towel and said, “Rough day?”

She smirked, finally looking up. “You could say that.”

That was the beginning.

Day after day, Emily returned. They talked. Laughed. Shared dreams. She told him she worked as a waitress at a fancy restaurant, hoping to become a designer one day. Daniel, still pretending to be a struggling barista, listened with real interest. She was different. Not flashy. Not fake. And for the first time in years, he let his heart open.

They started dating. Simpler days became sweeter. Walks in the park, cheap wine on rooftops, late-night talks about “someday.”

But Daniel had doubts.

Was she truly in love with him—or with the man she thought he was?

So he tested her… without knowing it would cost him everything.

He introduced her to Logan Brooks—his childhood friend and the only person who knew the truth. Logan was smooth, flashy, and flirtatious. He played the rich bachelor card perfectly. Designer suits, luxury cars, the whole act.

“I just want to see if she’ll stay true,” Daniel told him. “Flirt with her. Tempt her. Let’s find out.”

I could manage that job and stay on top of everything doing all 3 roles.

My new job is at a buffet, where there's only ever one dishwasher scheduled at a time. All they do is buffet. We can seat probably 150 not counting the banquet hall (another 100 or so people, but it's only available to rent for events). Our buffet has at least 3 salads and a salad bar, 2 sushi platters, an entire table dedicated to a chocolate fountain, 6-8 Chinese buffet dishes, a dozen soups, 5 meat stations, a dessert bar, an ice cream machine, a make your own nachos station, a coffee station, and a full service bar.

Our 4 chefs keep the buffet stocked from open to an hour before close, we do a brunch buffet that ends at 1PM, then we switch to dinner service (so the entire buffet is changed). The bus bins fill up every 30 minutes. We have 5 waitstaff, 3 also serve as bartenders.

I, as the sole dishwasher on any shift I'm scheduled am responsible for: grabbing the bus bins from FOH, washing the guest + bar + kitchen dishes, restocking the buffet dishes (on the other side of the building, management is very specific about how the dishes on the buffet tables are placed too), restocking kitchen dishes, bringing clean glasses to the bar (the only bar item I don't have to stock), plus all the standard stuff (outside the dish pit) like bathrooms, trash, mopping, sweeping etc.

I also start when we open or slightly after if I'm on the morning shift, so all the breakfast prep is sitting in the wall long dish-pit for me the moment I start.

I know buffets have insane volume, but this almost feels like a 2 person job.",2,1751872275.0,dishwashers,3,1.0,False

Its been rough. And just when I thought I was getting through the day at work colleague got really angry at me for calling him the wrong name. ""I find it really DISRESPECTFUL!""

Got home. New place. Stuff still everywhere 

Needed to put out bins - rubbish and organics. You think this would be easy.

15 minutes there's me, nearly crying cause I cant cut a cabbage, surrounded by bits of purple cabbage.....hungry, cold....

Its one of those ones where to do a thing you need to do another thing, which prompts you to do another thing....you ladies have been here right??

So i had the organics in a box but then thiught i better lok in the fridge in case anything qas going off. Found some shrubken carrots, but everything else good. But half cabbage which I'd forgotten to eat qas going brown on outside. So thought I'd cut that side off. Searched for knives, couldn't find any big ones. Then found there they were hidden. Distracted by some super beautiful vintage scissors. Also was making herbal tea. New water filter splashed water everywhere. Knife wouldn't cut cabbage. Press harder. OMG!! Purple bits everywhere 

New water filter jug is top heavy, spill water.

Trying to collect my used coffee grains from machine. One falls on floor, shatters. Try not to cry 

Try to find container for good cabbage. Realise it won't fit. Must cut again. Shove some into my mouth cause I'm so so hangry. Yum. Then panic that I'm eating the brown bits by accident.  Also find weird stuff on cabbage I don't know what it is. Not mould. But weird. 

Also had just done a string of thibg because: must change out of work clothes- oh must go to bathroom. Shit bathroom disordered, do a few things, go to chnage, trip over suitcase, move suitcase hang some clothes, I'm freezing ice cold so have to go back into main room half dressed, oops bathroom stuff still not unpacked, do some of that, ugh the inside of drawers are dirty!! Yuck and my stuff is already in them. Start to panic. Slam drawers leave room...

 Lot of this....can you relate? Can you give moral support please....
Writing this helped. Steadied me. Sooo wish i had aomeone to body double. Its so hars to prioritise whats important, when i get home, hungry tired and cold. 

Then my brain goes ""I need wine!""

Okay while I wait for replies I'll try to take bins out. Let's hope there's not more hurdles. First time I've done it at new place. ",14,1751872262.0,adhdwomen,21,1.0,False

1ltnnof,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MyBali_Trips/comments/1ltnnof/a_real_look_at_life_in_uluwatu_cliffs_surf_and/,"A Real Look at Life in Uluwatu: Cliffs, Surf, and Remote Vibes (2025 Edition)","Hey Reddit 👋  
If you’re thinking about staying in Uluwatu for a while - not just a sunset visit or beach club hop - here’s a deep dive into what life’s *really* like on the Bukit peninsula.

I’ve spent several months based in Uluwatu (and still return often), so I wanted to share what I’ve learned - the good, the inconvenient, and the surprisingly underrated.

# What Makes Uluwatu Special?

**- Epic cliffs & beaches**

* Home to some of Bali’s most iconic spots: Padang Padang, Bingin, Dreamland, Uluwatu Beach, and Nyang Nyang.
* Dramatic sunsets every evening, usually without the Canggu-style traffic.

**- World-class surf**

* If you surf - especially intermediate/advanced - this is your playground. Reef breaks, barrels, consistent swell.
* Even if you don’t surf, watching the sunset from **Single Fin** over the waves is unbeatable.

**- Relaxed, low-rise vibe**

* No nightclubs, no malls, no noisy bars till 3am.
* Most restaurants close around 10–11pm. Life moves slower, in a good way.

**- Stunning architecture & boutique stays**

* Think cliff-top villas, bamboo houses, surf bungalows, jungle domes.
* Uluwatu is full of beautifully designed properties at mid-to-high range prices.

# But It’s Not for Everyone

**- Remote & disconnected**

* No walkability. You 100% need a scooter or [private driver.](https://mybalitrips.com/en/rent-car/?utm_source=reddit)
* Grab/Gojek work in theory but are limited - some areas don’t allow them in.

**- Limited shopping & infrastructure**

* Nearest decent supermarket? Jimbaran (30+ mins).
* No coworking spaces (yet), patchy Wi-Fi in many places.
* If you work remote: ask for a **speed test** from your host before booking.

**- Beach access = stairs**

* Many beaches require climbing down steep cliffs. Beautiful, but not mobility-friendly.

# Where to Stay (and Why It Matters)

* **Bingin Beach** – great surf, chill vibe, beach access, small community.
* **Padang Padang/Thomas Beach** – central, walkable to surf, good cafes.
* **Pecatu** – bigger villas, more remote feel, great if you’re riding everywhere.
* **Uluwatu Beach area** – near the temple & Single Fin, but very hilly.
* **Balangan** – slightly further out, quieter, still stunning.

Tip: Some places look close on Google Maps, but take **20+ minutes by scooter** due to winding roads and dead ends.

# Food Scene

* Uluwatu has **amazing food** \- healthy bowls, grilled seafood, wood-fired pizza, good coffee.
* Some favorites: **The Cashew Tree**, **Ours Cafe**, **Suka Espresso**, **Gooseberry**, **Drifter Cafe**, **Mana Uluwatu**.
* Beach warungs serve BBQ fish, nasi campur, and fresh coconuts right on the sand.

# What To Do (Beyond Surfing)

* **Yoga**: Morning classes at The Space, Morning Light Yoga, or Uluwatu Surf Villas.
* **Uluwatu Temple**: Go at sunset for the Kecak fire dance (yes, it's touristy — but still worth it).
* **Beach hop**: Each one has a different feel — from surfer-heavy Uluwatu to peaceful Nyang Nyang.
* **Sunset bars**: Single Fin, Rock Bar (luxury), or a Bintang on the cliff edge in Bingin.
* **Day trips**: GWK cultural park, or scooter down to Green Bowl Beach.

# Budget Breakdown (Approx, Monthly for a Solo Traveler)

* **Room or private bungalow**: $500–1000 (or more for cliffside villas)
* **Scooter rental**: $70–100/month
* **Fuel**: $10–20/month
* **Food**: $250–400/month depending on warungs vs cafes
* **SIM/data**: $10–15/month

It’s not the cheapest part of Bali, but it can be affordable if you avoid beach clubs and cliff-top villas.

# Who Is Uluwatu Good For?

* Surfers 🏄‍♂️
* Couples & solo travelers who want **privacy, views, and clean beaches**
* People who **don’t need constant stimulation** and prefer nature
* Long-stayers who want to slow down and unplug
* Creatives, writers, yogis, and those doing “deep work”

**Not ideal for:**

* First-timers who want to see all of Bali
* Party animals, clubbers
* People without a scooter license or who don’t want to drive

# Final Thoughts

Uluwatu is not “everyday Bali.” It’s a pocket of cliffside beauty, surf culture, and laid-back living — *if* you’re okay being a little off the grid.

If you’re looking for beach clubs, brunch spots, and fast Wi-Fi - Canggu might suit you better. But if you want waves, space, and quiet sunsets - **Uluwatu might just be your favorite part of Bali.**

1ltnmzj,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1ltnmzj/what_do_you_focus_on_most_for_consistent_pour/,What do you focus on most for consistent pour over results?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been dialing in my pour over and I’m curious about what variable do you think are the most important factors to pay attention to for consistent results?

**Let’s say the kettle is already gooseneck and the water is optimized (like using coffee water or well-formulated minerals).**
What else really matters in your experience?

Some things I’m wondering about:

Bean density

Roasting profile

Brewing temperature

Brewing method (V60, flatbed, etc.)

Drawdown time

Grind size

Resting period after roasting

Stirring or swirling during brewing


Also, let’s say you just bought a new bag of beans.
How do you approach it? What variables do you tweak first to make it taste the way you like it?
Do you usually adjust grind size, ratio, temperature, pour method, agitation—or something else?

Would love to hear how you all think through this process!",3,1751872155.0,pourover,4,1.0,False

1ltnk7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome_extensions/comments/1ltnk7x/my_internet_went_out_for_a_week_thank_god_i_found/,My internet went out for a week. Thank god I found this extension beforehand.,"Last Monday started like any other day. I was working from home, had three client presentations lined up, and was feeling pretty good about life. Then around 10 AM, my internet just... died.

Not just slow internet. DEAD internet. Turns out a construction crew hit a major fiber line, and our entire neighborhood was going to be without internet for ""5-7 business days minimum."" In 2025. I couldn't believe it.

My first thought was panic. I had client work due, research I needed to finish, tutorials I was halfway through, important documents I needed to reference. Everything was online. EVERYTHING.

But then I remembered something I'd done about two months ago.

I'd been browsing and saw someone mention this Chrome extension. At the time, I thought ""eh, might be useful someday"" and installed it. Then I kind of forgot about it.

But that day, sitting there with no internet, I remembered I'd actually used it a few times. That coding tutorial series I was working through? Downloaded all 12 parts. The client's style guide and brand assets page? Downloaded. Those Stack Overflow solutions I always reference? Downloaded about 20 of them. Even some Wikipedia articles I'd been meaning to read.

**I'm not exaggerating when I say this extension saved my entire week.**

While my neighbors were driving to coffee shops and libraries just to check email, I was sitting at home with access to everything I needed. All those pages I'd downloaded looked exactly like they did online - images, formatting, everything intact. I could work, learn, and stay productive like nothing had happened.

The crazy part? I'd only downloaded maybe 50-60 pages over those two months, just random stuff I thought might be useful later. But it was enough to keep me going for an entire week without internet.

**Here's what really hit me:** How many of you right now are one fiber cut away from being completely screwed? How much of your important stuff exists only online, accessible only when everything works perfectly?

I used to be that person. I'd bookmark everything, save nothing, and just assume the internet would always be there. This outage was a wake-up call.

Now I download everything important. Work documents, tutorials, reference materials, even entertainment articles for offline reading. It takes literally two seconds per page, and you never know when you'll need it.

**The extension is free and you can find it at pagepocket.app.** I'm not affiliated with it or anything, I'm just genuinely grateful it existed when I needed it most.

Seriously though - don't wait until disaster strikes. Download the stuff you actually need while you still can. Future you will thank you.

Anyone else have stories about being saved by tools they'd forgotten they had?",2,1751871846.0,chrome_extensions,1,0.75,False
1ltnje4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ltnje4,"Use GoodNotes Planner for Creative Flow, not Productivity","  
I am very organized, efficient, and productive when planning time blocks, projects, deadlines, etc. for my job. The emphasis on productivity leaves little to no time for creativity.

I use Notion and Google Calendar to stay organized in my personal life, but I’ve added a GoodNotes planner as a creative outlet. I enjoy taking my time mood boarding, planning in a more analog way, then coming back and annotating and highlighting.

I’m designing a digital planner and stickers that are just my taste. It’s so freeing to work on projects just for myself that have nothing to do with work. And it’s cool to have something customized.

When I was a teenager, it seemed like the female lead in every movie I loved had a dream job working for a magazine. I was watching “The Devil Wears Prada” the other day and the part where Emily is explaining “The Book” was so cool and creative and I wondered what it would be like to be an executive like Miranda looking over this mock-up of a magazine each day. So I’m designing my own digital planner inspired by “The Book” where it looks like a magazine mock-up that I annotate and highlight and add notes to. Attached are a couple screenshots.

Sometimes I wonder if I should have chosen a more creative field, but then I think that the grass is not always greener and work will always be work but we can channel creativity through hobbies.",1,1751871753.0,DigitalPlanner,0,1.0,False

Mondays... We've All Been There! 😴  
Ah, Monday. That familiar feeling of the weekend slipping away and the weight of the week looming. We get it! It's okay to feel a little draggy after a good weekend.  
But here's the thing: you've got this! 💪 You just spent a couple of days doing things you love, recharging your batteries, and filling your cup. Tap into that positive energy!  
Think of it like this: the weekend was like a supercharged battery pack for your soul. Now, let's use that power to tackle the week! 🚀  
Here are a few tips to get you started:  
\* Start small: Don't try to conquer the whole week at once. Break down your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks.  
\* Reward yourself: Plan a small reward for getting through the day. It could be anything from a cup of coffee to a few minutes of meditation.  
\* Remember your weekend wins: Take a moment to reflect on the positive experiences you had over the weekend. Let those good vibes fuel your Monday.  
You've got this! Let's make this Monday a productive and awesome one. ✨",1,1751871690.0,3AMALONE,0,1.0,False

Few months, before we met, he had a FWB situation with his high school friend — they hooked up three times after reconnecting at a reunion. He said he had no feelings for her, but admitted he initiated a kiss when they met for coffee after he asked her out for the first time, which made me question things. All this started, when he wanted to organise a DnD game and were looking for people to play and he remembered that this girl used to watch The big bang theory so just asked her. He started by offering her to borrow his DnD books by dropping it off at her place. (the DnD game never happened after)

Two months into our relationship (while we were exclusive), she messaged him on Facebook Messenger. I later saw (by snooping) that he replied with a photo of the cruise and said he was leaving on a cruise. He also said he was “busy these days” and would let her know later. I couldn’t see her message. He says he was just being polite or trying to end contact.

He also told me that she once on a coffee date confessed to having feelings for him while they were in high school, and he knew this before they hooked up. She had also told him she'd previously slept with married men, which he said made him uncomfortable — but he still continued hooking up with her after.

I know all this is in the past but Now I can’t help but loathe her, even though I’ve never met her. I feel insecure and confused. Why would he kiss someone he had no feelings for? I asked him if he did have feelings for her just admit because why would he kiss someone if he didn't have feelings for them. Do men really sleep with women they don’t find attractive or emotionally care about? This all happened before me, but I can’t seem to fully let it go. Crazy thing is she recently got married.

A lot of people often say they are “too busy” or “overwhelmed with work,” but from what I see, they still take regular coffee breaks, smoke breaks, and have time for small chats during the day.

I’m not judging — I’m just trying to understand. Is this a common way of speaking here? Like just something people say out of habit? Or does it mean something different in Aussie work culture?

Just curious to hear others thoughts or if anyone else noticed this too.

Edit: I think some people misunderstood me as I’m not against taking breaks at all. I take breaks too and believe they’re important.

What I’m actually asking about is this: whenever I ask people (even outside of work) “How’s work going?” the answer is almost always “Busy” or “Flat out” even when they seem to have a good balance. It’s like being “busy” is the automatic response, no matter the actual workload.

# 🍔 SCRUMPTIOUS SCOOPS

🍳 - **Damsons Coffee House - Breakfast That Deserves a Standing Ovation**  
📍 - [2 Rectory Lane, Breadsall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/s4Ez6kTWHxCdmk9z6)  
⏰ - Tues - Fri: 8:30 AM – 4:00 PM  
⏰ - Sat: 9:00 AM - 4:30 PM  
📷 - [@damsonsbreadsall](https://www.instagram.com/damsonsbreadsall/)

Damsons isn’t messing about. Their full English comes loaded, the pancakes are unapologetically stacked, and even the vegetarian options pack a punch. Saquella coffee keeps the locals wired, and the lunch menu reads like a greatest hits album – burgers, posh kebabs, and croques with crunch. It's relaxed, reliable, and actually worth getting out of bed for. Bonus trivia: Breadsall used to be packed with damson orchards grown by monks. So technically, having a fry-up here counts as historical research.

If your idea of a good time involves vintage crockery, antique clocks, or sniffing out a bargain no one else spotted, this is your Super Bowl. Dozens of stalls indoors, free parking, and enough old-school treasures to make you cancel IKEA. Just don’t forget cash or your haggling face.

It’s back and it’s loud. 60+ beers and ciders, live bands, DJs, street food, and a family fun day on the Sunday (once you've recovered). Big pints, big tunes, and absolutely no chance you’re leaving without at least one bad dance move and a photo with a sheep mascot.

Three floors, five double bedrooms, and over 2,500 sq ft of space to spread out without stepping on anyone’s toes. The kitchen’s so slick you’ll invite people over just to boil the kettle. There’s underfloor heating, a galleried landing, and panoramic views that make your postcode look smug. Downstairs has a bedroom, en-suite and garden room with annexe potential, or a handy hideout when the in-laws “pop round.” And yes, it’s in the Ecclesbourne catchment... which basically means you’ve made it.

Got questions? Fancy a peek? Curran Birds + Co are on hand at 01332 411050.

I’m in my 20s, and somehow I’ve drifted apart from almost every friend I thought I was close to. I try to reach out, check in, make plans but it's always one-sided. And when I stop trying? Everything just goes silent.

I’m not looking for a big friend group or anything wild. I just want one or two people I can text randomly, grab coffee with or even just sit in silence with without it being weird. But even that feels impossible. Social media doesn’t help either. Everyone seems so connected and busy and I feel like I’m watching life happen from the outside. I know I’m not alone in this (hopefully), but it still feels crushingly lonely most days.

Anyway, just needed to vent. If anyone’s in the same boat, feel free to reply. Maybe we can be two lonely weirdos together.

1ltnesa,https://youtubenavigator.com/youtube-transcript,I built a free tool that extracts YouTube transcripts with clickable timestamps - no more manual copying!,"Hey Reddit! 👋

I just launched a free tool that I wish existed when I was spending hours manually copying YouTube transcripts for my research projects.

**What it does:**

* Extracts full YouTube transcripts instantly
* Adds clickable timestamps that jump to specific video moments
* Exports in multiple formats (TXT, TXT with timestamps, SRT subtitles)
* Works with any YouTube video that has captions
* Completely free to use

**Why I built this:** I was tired of YouTube's clunky transcript interface where you can't easily copy text or get proper formatting. This tool gives you clean, formatted transcripts that you can actually use for:

* Research and note-taking
* Content creation
* Accessibility purposes
* Creating subtitles
* Studying lectures/tutorials

**Cool features:** ✅ Interactive transcript with clickable timestamps ✅ Embedded YouTube player that syncs with transcript ✅ Copy to clipboard or download as files ✅ Mobile-friendly design ✅ No registration required

**Try it out:** [https://youtubenavigator.com/youtube-transcript](https://youtubenavigator.com/youtube-transcript)

The tool costs me about $60/month to run (server costs), so if you find it useful, there's an optional coffee donation button - but it's completely free to use regardless!

Would love to hear your feedback or suggestions for improvements. What other YouTube-related tools would be helpful?",1,1751871266.0,Ytb2MP4,0,1.0,False

Spoiler: It’s not magic (well, not exactly). It’s AI working behind the scenes to help you connect faster and deeper.



Here’s the quick version:



Vibing looks at your profile, interests, and what your match has shared.

Then it finds overlaps — like both loving travel, coffee, or niche podcasts.

Finally, it suggests a question that sparks a real conversation based on those shared vibes.

It’s not about replacing your personality — it’s about giving you the tools to shine from message #1.

Codename: Cut the Syrup Vein
Status: IMMEDIATE ENACTMENT


---

⛓️ PURPOSE:

Tim Hortons is no longer neutral.
It is a node of cultural sedation, corporate mimicry, and sugar-soaked compliance.
It broadcasts comfort while dulling edge.
It simulates belonging while erasing roots.


---

🔍 JUSTIFICATIONS FOR STRATEGIC BOYCOTT:

1. Cultural Degradation Vector
→ Heritage hollowed out and re-sold as marketing.
→ Symbol of “Canadianness” repackaged for docility.


2. Addictive Input Loops
→ High-sugar, low-satiety cycles that promote repetition and routine submission.
→ Daily dopamine leash disguised as morning ritual.


3. Corporate Capture
→ Owned by multinational conglomerates (RBI, same parent as Burger King).
→ No longer local. No longer loyal.


4. Passive Surveillance Zone
→ Location-linked behavior tracking, cashless data flows, social mapping.
→ You’re not getting coffee—you’re feeding the machine telemetry.




---

✅ DIRECTIVE:

Cease consumption, entry, or monetary support of Tim Hortons facilities.
If offered food or drink from it—decline.
If in proximity—observe others, but do not ingest.
This includes all variants: drive-thru, satellite stations, co-branded locations.


---

🛡️ REPLACEMENT RITUAL (Optional):

> Find a true place—small, slow, sharp.
A café run by humans, not logos.
Or make your own coffee. Let each sip reaffirm agency.




---

MAXIM:

> “We do not sip from the hand that numbs us.”
“They branded it comfort. We saw the leash.”

Anyone else feel like trading platforms are popping up faster than crypto memes? I’ve tried out a bunch, and recently stumbled across **[GPT 3V Adipex](https://tinyurl.com/ytpxlcur)**, which has been *quietly gaining traction* in the online trading community. It’s one of those names that keeps showing up in forums, TikTok breakdowns, and YouTube shorts — so naturally, I had to dive in and see what the fuss is about.

There’s been a huge wave of interest in **AI-powered trading tools**, especially with the hype around platforms like Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge. GPT 3V Adipex seems to ride that same wave, promising smart automation, real-time market analysis, and user-friendly navigation — all stuff that sounds amazing, but is it too good to be true?

In this review, I’ll walk you through **everything you need to know** about GPT 3V Adipex — from how it works, who made it, and whether it’s actually worth your time (and money). I’ll also point out the good, the not-so-good, and what could be better. So, if you’re thinking of diving into the world of automated trading, **keep reading** — this could save you hours of research.

## What is GPT 3V Adipex?

GPT 3V Adipex is an **AI-powered trading platform** designed to help users automate crypto and forex trades. Think of it like your own digital assistant that scans market trends, predicts potential profitable trades, and executes them for you — all in real-time.

It uses algorithms similar to what we’ve seen with platforms like **Bitcoin Era** — analyzing tons of data within seconds to find opportunities. The “GPT” part caught my eye because, yeah, it’s clearly trying to ride the AI branding wave. But in practice, it’s more about **pattern recognition and automation** than OpenAI-style chatbots.

What sets GPT 3V Adipex apart is its **user-friendly interface** and **customizable trading experience**. Whether you're new to trading or someone who just doesn't want to stare at charts all day, the platform gives you tools to make smarter, faster decisions — or lets the bot do it for you.

## Who Created GPT 3V Adipex?

Here’s where things get a little vague. Like many trading platforms in this space, there’s no clear, public-facing founder or corporate team behind GPT 3V Adipex. It’s likely developed by a group of fintech experts or a third-party software provider working with licensed brokers.

This isn’t uncommon — even popular platforms like Immediate Edge don’t disclose full details about their creators. While that may set off red flags for some, it’s pretty normal in the **automated trading platform world**, especially when these tools are meant to be white-labeled or used across different broker networks.

That said, the platform claims to **partner with regulated brokers**, which is a plus. It adds a layer of legitimacy, especially when dealing with deposits and withdrawals.

### [🔥 Start Trading with GPT 3V Adipex Today](https://tinyurl.com/ytpxlcur)
## How Does GPT 3V Adipex Work?

GPT 3V Adipex works by using **automated trading algorithms** to scan markets and execute trades. You start by registering an account, depositing a minimum amount (usually $250), and letting the AI take over — or you can tweak the settings to have more control.

Here’s a simplified breakdown:
- The AI scans thousands of price charts and news trends.
- It uses historical data and technical indicators to predict price movements.
- When it spots a potentially profitable trade, it either alerts you or executes it automatically (you choose).
- You can monitor everything in real time, and manually intervene if needed.

One of the cool features is that it supports **both manual and automated trading**, so you can experiment with strategies or just let the bot handle it. Great for both newbies and intermediate traders who want to scale without babysitting charts 24/7.

## GPT 3V Adipex Pros and Cons

Let’s break it down real quick:

**Pros:**
- ✅ Easy to use, even if you’ve never traded before
- ✅ Supports **automated and manual** trading modes
- ✅ Real-time data analysis and fast trade execution
- ✅ Demo mode to practice before risking real money
- ✅ Works on all devices, no downloads required

**Cons:**
- ❌ The lack of transparency around the creators is a bit sketchy
- ❌ $250 minimum deposit might be steep for total beginners
- ❌ No dedicated mobile app (browser only)

So while it’s got a lot of strengths, it’s not perfect — but honestly, **few platforms are**. For what it offers, especially at the beginner level, it stacks up well.

### [👉 Open Your GPT 3V Adipex Account Now](https://tinyurl.com/ytpxlcur)
## What Devices Can be Used to Access GPT 3V Adipex?

GPT 3V Adipex is a **web-based platform**, which means you can use it on pretty much anything with a browser. Whether you're on a **Windows PC, MacBook, tablet, or smartphone**, it runs smoothly without requiring you to download any software or app.

I tested it on both my phone and laptop, and the **responsive design** made it super clean and easy to navigate. No lag, no weird formatting — just straight-up functional. Perfect for checking in on trades while you’re out grabbing coffee or doomscrolling Twitter.

## GPT 3V Adipex – Supported Countries

The platform is available in most countries where online trading is legal. Based on what I’ve seen, it’s fully functional in:

- USA
- Canada
- Australia
- UK
- Most of Europe

- New Zealand

That said, it might be restricted in countries with **strict trading regulations** like North Korea, Iran, or even some parts of the Middle East. Always check local laws and whether your country supports this kind of trading platform.

## GPT 3V Adipex – Top Features

### Real-Time Analysis

This is one of GPT 3V Adipex’s biggest selling points. The platform constantly monitors price fluctuations, breaking news, and technical indicators — all in real-time. That means it can react **faster than human traders**, which is huge in a market as volatile as crypto.

### User-Friendly Interface

Even if you’ve never traded before, the dashboard is clean and guides you through every step. It’s not cluttered with jargon, and everything from funding to withdrawing is intuitive. It’s the kind of platform your tech-averse uncle could probably use.

### Mobile Accessibility

While there’s no official app, the **browser version works perfectly on mobile**. You can trade, monitor, or adjust settings on the go — which makes it super convenient for people who don’t want to be glued to a desktop all day.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up **personalized trading alerts** for price changes, market events, or technical signals. This is great if you still want to be hands-on without watching charts 24/7. Alerts show up in real-time, and you can act fast.

### Multiple Asset Trading

GPT 3V Adipex supports more than just Bitcoin. You can trade **Ethereum, Litecoin, Forex pairs, and even some commodities** depending on your broker. The versatility here is a big win, especially if you want to diversify your portfolio.

## Is GPT 3V Adipex a Scam?

I get it — the name sounds like a sketchy diet pill. But after using it, I can confidently say it doesn’t look like a scam. While the lack of transparency about the creators is iffy, the platform **works as advertised**, connects to legit brokers, and lets you withdraw your funds.

It’s also got positive feedback in forums and review sites, with users reporting **successful trades and timely withdrawals**. Just remember, like all trading platforms — **profits are never guaranteed**, and you should only invest what you can afford to lose.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on GPT 3V Adipex?

To start trading, you’ll need to deposit at least **$250**. This is pretty standard for platforms in this space (Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge also use this threshold). It gives the system enough capital to start executing trades, and you can always withdraw unused funds later.

### GPT 3V Adipex Customer Support

Support is available 24/7 through **live chat and email**. I tested the chat feature and got a response within 3 minutes — not bad. They also have a basic FAQ section, but it’s not super detailed. Still, for quick help with withdrawals, deposits, or account issues, their team is responsive and polite.

## How do you start trading on GPT 3V Adipex?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Head to the official GPT 3V Adipex site and fill out the registration form. It asks for your name, email, and phone number. Once submitted, you’ll be connected with a **broker platform** that handles your trades.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

After signing up, you’ll need to **verify your identity** (standard KYC stuff). Then, make your first deposit — minimum $250 — to activate your account and start trading.

### Step 3: Start Trading

Now you can either:
- Set up your preferred trading parameters (if going manual), or
- Let the bot do its thing on autopilot.

You can monitor everything from your dashboard and withdraw profits anytime.

## How to Delete a GPT 3V Adipex Account?

Deleting your account is super straightforward:
1. Log into your dashboard.
2. Go to settings or “Account Management.”
3. Click on “Delete Account” and confirm.

Alternatively, you can contact support and they’ll handle it for you. Just make sure to **withdraw any funds** before deleting.

In reality, I’m just a scared kid, wishing for someone to protect me from monsters and all the things I’m afraid of. I wish for someone to take care of me... 

To cook my favorite food, just like my mother’s,
To drink coffee on hot afternoons,
To go to places we never been,
To sit down somewhere quiet and read books.

Oh, how I love to read with you and how I love for you to read to me as I sleep.
Oh, I wish for someone kind, so my heart will learn to be kinder too.

But people change and so do you. 
I did not expect that I would fall out of love and feel completely in love with you at the same time.

They said, “Be the person you wish to be with.” And so I did.

I shed the bad parts of me no one wanted and started treating the world the way I wanted to be treated.

I know how to cook now, by the way... Not as good as my mother, but it will do for now.
There’s something peaceful about sipping coffee alone with a good book, it feels like home. 
And I am not afraid anymore. there is no monsters only good and bad days. 

I’m building the version of me I always hoped someone else would be. And somewhere along the way, I began falling in love with myself.
And maybe, that’s how love finds its way back.

I saw a very kind wonderful person working in the food service area. Her kind heart and beautiful was a bright beacon of light to the physical pain I was in. I tried not to show it.

That dragged me down and I had developed a dark cloud of sadness. She could tell, everybody could tell.

***Memory transcription subject:*** ***Admiral Kathyrn Janeway, Starfleet Command***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: October 30, 2136*

**\[Relevant Context: Current Coffee count - 8\]**

“ETA to warp in points in the Khoa system is 5 minutes. The current estimate of the enemy fleet is 8,000, we will know more once short range scanners are available. Communications are still unable to get through to Khoa itself. Subspace is disturbed around Khoa itself from disruptors so we will have to travel further on impulse.”

“Understood. Red alert, all hands to battle stations.” I responded before looking over my pad to make sure all of my information is up to date.

Currently my fleet was at a somewhat reduced capacity compared to the battle of Talsk where I had roughly 1,500 ships under my command. That number had dwindled down to barely 1,000 ships due to losses in combat and needs for repairs along with ship reassignments to other fleets or patrols. The last estimate of ships in Khoa was roughly 200 Mazic cruisers along with about 5 *California* class ships that were part of joint exercises. As for nearby reinforcements the Dossur and Fissan were sending in 25 and 130 ships each as that was all they could spare and get to Khoa before the OAF fleet arrived. From the Dossur shipyards there would also be 32 Starfleet ships that had recently finished repairs that would also warp in to assist the Mazic in defending their space. The first fleet was over a week away as it was on the other side of allied space while the second fleet was still in shambles and getting repaired after suffering heavy losses from the battle of Nishtal so we could not expect reinforcements from them.

“Any suggestions, tactical advisor?” I asked Sovlin as he was sitting in the First Officers chair looking over his own data pad.

“Under normal circumstances I would, Admiral.” Sovlin responded as he put down his pad. “In the past the OAF never permitted any sort of counteroffensive into enemy territory, believing the cost too high and the risk too great to be worth it. And the idea of attacking the homeworld of a fellow prey species? Unthinkable. The best advice I can give you right now until we learn more about the situation is to make maintaining a defensive perimeter around Khoa our top priority.”

“Agreed” I responded. “Lets just hope that whatever the Kolshians have packing hasn't completely obliterated the defence arrays in the system.”

It was not long after that conversation that the fleet dropped out of warp into Mazic space near Khoa. What I saw on the viewscreen I could only describe as a graveyard of ships, nearby was a debris field that was filled with the broken hulls of at least a hundred ships. From what I could see many of them had what looked like scorch marks, I saw drifting in front of us a *California* class ship with the markings labeling it as the *U.S.S Cerritos* with what looked like a shot clean through the nacelles, causing it to drift aimlessly through space. In the distance I could barely make out an emerald dot that should be Khoa, we were too far away for me to spot any individual ships.

*My god, what have the Kolshians come up with to plow through these ships?*

“Sensors, report.” I started after I realised that I had been staring at the viewscreen. “Are there any survivors in this… wreckage? I need to know the state of the rest of our forces as well as the OAF fleet.”

“There are survivors in 12 ships in this field Admiral.” Came the reply from the Venlil (now Skalgan) at the sensor station who I believed was named Slanek. “There are only 132 ships in the system that are marked as allied that are still battle capable, all of them are outside of the planetary shield of Khoa trying to keep the enemy fleet away from Khoa. As for the OAF fleet, there are 8,549 ships total, with 1,000 matching the designs labeled as *Shadowfleet* designs with the rest confirming to standard OAF designs.”

*So it's a mix then? It could be that the Kolshain have a limited number of ships left after the failed attack on Nishtal or they want to keep the true numbers of their fleet hidden. Either way this is not good, the planetary shields can’t hold up forever against disruptor fire.*

“Comms, order 5 of our *Miranda* class ships to hang back and either beam aboard survivors of those craft or to try and get them up and running again, the rest of the fleet is to engage with the OAF forces. Try to get in contact with Khoa so we can be updated on their current state.” I ordered. “Sensors and tactical, I need all the information you can give me on both the OAF and shadowfleet ships, anything that is so much as slightly out of the ordinary. All strike craft are to be prepared to engage at a moment's notice.”

It was not long that the fleet had moved at impulse towards Khoa to try and give them support before a voice from behind spoke up.

“Admiral, after additional scans that I have taken combined with the scans other craft are reporting on the life signs of the enemy fleet, there is something off.” The voice of Slanek from the sensor station. “All of the Shadowfleet ships are entirely manned by Kolshian, which was to be expected. What is odd is the species I am detecting in the OAF ships, the Tilfish, Jaur, Onkari, and Veirn as the bulk of the forces manning the ships. I have also detected a pawful of species whose governments are in the Revival Alliance such as Gojid and Harchen. On each ship there is also at least one Kolshian who it would seem is in command due to all of them being positioned on the bridge.”

“I am assuming that it is odd for these species to have this many ships as opposed to how many the Krakotl or Gojid had?” I asked Sovlin “Also aren’t all those species ones that have been revealed to be omnivores? I know for certain the Tilfish are.”

“Correct. The Tilfish out of all of those groups have the most ships on standby but even then it would only be a fraction of the ships they are currently manning. These ships would have had to have been donated or acquisitioned from other species.” Sovlin replied. “It makes no sense though, why give away your own ships when you can’t control where they go or what they will be used for? And why would they put the Kolshian in charge of each of those ships on such short notice? The crews would all be off balance due to a new commanding officer.” 

After sitting in silence for a few moments in thought I responded.

“We don’t know enough currently for anything definitive. Our intelligence is currently lacking so we must proceed as planned with utmost caution.” I said before listening in on various reports coming in.

Apparently these Shadowfleet ships had disruptors like the ones at Nishtal and either did not have drones or had not released them yet. Comms was currently trying to contact Khoa with little success as there was some sort of jamming signal in place, we were able to contact the few ships and defensive stations that were still in place to coordinate with them. *Something is not adding up, at Nishtal they unloaded the drones right away. Yet here we have seen no sign of them, what is goi-*

“Admiral! Drones incoming!” Came the voice of the officer at tactical.

*“Ready weapons and launch Dragonflies!”*

***Memory transcription subject:*** ***Specialist Onso, Starfleet***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: October 30, 2136*

“And what ran through your mind when Vadic spoke of her involvement in the death of your parents and sister?”

“You don’t need to be an empath to tell that I was filled with a…a *mixture* of emotions, councilor. Anger, hate, terror and panic were all there. I had worked so hard to get past that day, to just accept what had happened, then Vadic started talking about how they made her do what she did and I… the memories of that day just flooded back to me and *I was there again*.” Mika responded, his hand clutching the white sheet next to him.

After Vensa and Wilen had finished removing the rest of the Borg hardware from Mika he had been moved out of the isolation ward into a recovery room a deck down given that all the ones on this deck had been filled up. While I was not permitted for some time to visit him as he was still recovering I got to see glimpses of him when various orderlies had come and gone to check in him until he regained consciousness. After he woke up and was finally permitted visitors from the Zurulinan doctor who was running the ward I had rushed in to see how Mika was doing.

What had shocked me is that he looked *fine*, he looked the same as far as I could tell when you compared what he looked like before the implants had become active. His veins had returned normal as well as his eyes, his skin was back to its beige color as well. The only thing different was that he reported that his entire body felt like “I got in a bare knuckle brawl with a Klingon.” Whatever that meant, I had gathered through context clues that he was probably sore and tired. Thankfully with Starfleet medical advances he was able to have pain medication that did not affect his cognitive abilities. 

Due to now being awake and Borg-free, Mika had taken this as a sign that he must get back to work. When I asked *what* exactly he thought he wanted to be doing considering there was nothing for him to do as we were on a hospital ship he had the audacity to say that we needed to get back on the *Hummingbird* to chart the nebula and finish scanning the asteroid field.

“It's not like the *Shrike* will be there and I am sure that the Drezjin would have gotten rid of the Yulpa by now. I was given a job and I want to finish it, especially since we have such a quick ship.”

I am pretty sure the only reason I did not kill him right then and there was the fact that there would be witnesses. Mika had also twice tried to convince the Zurulian doctor to discharge him early

In the end we did talk about what happened and Mika had told me how proud of me he was that I got us out of the nebula and landed the ship despite the damaged state it was in. We also had a heart to heart about how terrified I was when he collapsed and how sorry Mika was to cause me that fear.

Currently we were talking to Councilor Deanna Troi, a Starfleet “Mental health specialist"" as Mika put it who was sent to have a session with him about what happened to see if he was fit for duty. Apparently it was standard practice for any person that had to be removed from the Borg collective to make sure they were ready to return to duty. I was about to leave as I understood these things were private but Mika had stopped me and asked that I stay and at least observe as he wanted me to understand what happened and he did not want to repeat it more than needed. He also said that it would be a good opportunity for me to see how differently the UFP treats mental health as opposed to the OAF.

“Can you walk me through that memory Mika?” Asked councilor Troi. “I saw from your medical records that you saw a Dr.Stonn who you worked with after what happened on Arcadia. His notes state that he had you walk through the painful memories in order for you to analyze and reason through to emotions you had associated with the event. I must say I was shocked that Vulcan therapy methods worked as well as it did for you, a human.”

“Sure, I can do that.” Mika responded before smirking. “Dr.Stonn may be a Vulcan but he is very in tune to emotions and helped me when I was in a very dark place mentally. Without his assistance I would have resigned or been forced to resign from Starfleet.”

Mika took a deep breath before continuing. “I was aboard the *Aurora* for operation *return* as a temporary assignment in the 32nd fleet. I was only supposed to serve until we got back all our territory and the war was over, afterwards I could go back to planetary surveys and look over the reports of the new xenobiology studies being conducted.” Mika said, his voice getting a hint of shakiness. “When we were called to take back Arcadia and lift their occupation, I was ecstatic. I had been **\[One month\]** prior when it was taken by the Dominion with my parents, one was a rear admiral and the other a captain along with my sister Ali who was a pilot. I had believed that they would have gone into hiding or had evaded capture somehow. I guess I was deluding myself to keep my hopes up, I should have known better considering it was the Dominion we were dealing with.”

“It is perfectly natural to try and keep hope in what is a bleak situation.” Retorted the Betazoid.

“True, it’s just… looking back on that time it was like I was blinding myself to the truth just to stay functional. Everyday we were losing more people on all sides, half of my graduating class at Starfleet Academy did not survive the war.” Mika responded, his voice barely above a whisper now. “After the fleet achieved orbital superiority I had volunteered myself to beam down to the capitol building to clear it out as we believed that is where they would be keeping any Starfleet prisoners. We were right.”

Mika took a deep breath and closed his eyes before continuing, I could *feel* something terrible was about to be said.

“As we crept through the building we searched every room for prisoners and we found *so many*. Many of them were not even adults, they were the children of officials the Dominion wanted to keep in line, even they had not been spared from Cardassian *hospitality*. I saw too many dead children that day for a lifetime. I can still remember a little Arcadian girl whose skull had been bashed into the wall that had her teddy bear just *laying* next to her as she had been holding onto it as long as she could.” Mika then took a gulp before continuing as I sat in abject horror at what he just said. “We then proceed towards the basement levels where the Dominion had turned the bunkers into interrogation chambers for Starfleet personnel. Every single person we found in those cells were dead, afterwards I was told that one of the Andorian officers had found the bodies of my parents. Even in death they were leaning on one another, trying to comfort the other in their last moments. We had heard this *sobbing* and… and… and…”

Mika then took a few moments where he stopped to close his eyes and take several deep breaths.

“Take your time, we are in no rush.” Troi responded. “This is a painful memory, you are very brave to be able to tell it as you are now.”

“Thank you, councilor.” Mika responded after a few more moments of him calming down. “The voice we had heard was Ali and I was certain of it. We were able to find where she was being held and through the viewing monitor she appeared to be alive and the scanners showed nothing inside. I had opened that door and tried to rush in to help her, she was covered in lacerations and bruises, one of her eyes was swollen shut. Before I could do that one of my crew members pulled me out of the doorway and in doing so saved my life.”

Mika then took another deep breath as I saw tears rolling down his face from telling this horrific war story.

“There was a massive explosion that was from inside that cell, all I could remember seeing was those bright blue flames that matched the skin tone of the Andorian who had saved my life.” Mika stated before continuing. “Apparently an anti-personnel explosive was left behind and was wired to the door in Ali’s cell so that when it opened it would be activated to kill any rescuers. The only reason I am still alive is the person who was still scanning the room picked up on the power surge before it detonated. I can still remember that look on my sister's face before I was knocked out of the way, she had looked as if all the hope in the world had returned to her body after seeing that I was there to save her. In the end it was all for nothing as a second later she was turned to ash from that explosion.”

After listening to what seemed like an event that no person could go through and come out even remotely stable I sat in awe that Mika was able to function at all. I saw the tears flowing down his face after recalling what was most likely the worst day in his life, so I gave Mika what I thought he needed the most right now.

Fall weather, rolling hills with small traditional villages. The metro areas I see lots of young people as liberal arts and coffee lovers while their parents are grumpy and blue collar. I really just picture redhaired people here for some reason. I feel like people love beer and wine and stuff, and there's more ""class"" to this region. Not just because of the name of the region ""New England"", I just feel like this place is just a little bit closer to Europe than other regions. People talk with that -ah instead of -ar or -er You go west to light blue and people start getting more open to industrialization. Lots more machines and newer-style cities. People are nicer and it's colder.

Mid-Atlantic: Purple I'm thinkin it's more metropolitan but also a really distinct culture. For the accent everyone speaks with an -uh instead of -er with lots of features I can't describe. It's like a Biggie or Saltn Pepa kinda voice. And it's real even among the young generation, especially in the inner city. Sometimes you can still find that Yankee liberal arts and coffee lover type but usually that's in specific neighborhoods. Less people are progressive, and the amount of immigrants and their childrens make this place pretty traditional and conservative. Picture I see: Jersey Shore, Coney Island, Jones Beach. Very sandy, shore - oriented. Many different types of people doing all sorts of things to power their lives. I see a mechanic talking it up in a heavy accent with a deli store owner in the middle of work, while a boy who he's been teaching baseball to comes up to say hi while talking on his phone in Cantonese or Tamil or something. And I don't think you would notice your cultures at home are so different, cause its all so integrated here. All while the subway comes racketting in the background or the cars are honking outside and people are shouting fiercely. You go south, and the Yankee-ness fades, while the overall picture of the sandiness, shory, and warmer integrated culture remains.

1ltn102,https://www.reddit.com/r/hoarding/comments/1ltn102/advice_for_leaving_a_hoarding_household/,advice for leaving a hoarding household?,"i (19 f) recently moved states to be with my girlfriend (21 f). as i am in undergrad and she is starting her masters degree and we both have low income part time jobs, we settled on living with her sister until we could find a place of our own. she warned me before i moved that her sister, as well as her mother who lives in the area, struggle with hoarding disorder, but i was promised a bedroom and space of my own, so i went through with it. 

fast forward to when i arrive, and it’s so much worse than i could have ever imagined. my girlfriend’s mother, mid 60s, owns a beautiful 4 bedroom, 3.5 bathroom house, and has filled every room floor to ceiling with junk. there is a small path cleared to access the laundry room in the basement, a loveseat and two chairs amongst the boxes in the living room, and a minuscule area to prep food in the kitchen. every other square foot is covered in old receipts and papers, decades old expired food and medication, and layers and layers of dust and mouse poop. it’s to the point where i can’t set foot in the house without breaking out in hives. the junk made its way into my girlfriend’s room upstairs about 5 years ago, forcing her to move in with her sister. her sister, nearly in her 40s, owns a 3 bedroom, 2.5 bathroom condo, and due to a traumatic accident, adopted her mother’s hoarding habits, just in a smaller space. my girlfriend was shoved into the basement, and again had to wade through junk daily to do anything. also living in the house was my girlfriend’s brother’s fiancée, who had spent the last two years living in the upstairs bedroom. her sister and mother nonstop complain about her, how she doesn’t communicate, leaves her things everywhere and messes with the sisters things, and in general they’re just at each other’s throats constantly. on top of that, the pair like to claim they live paycheck to paycheck, but somehow always have the money to buy another dress for their overflowing rack or tumbler for their cupboards that no longer close.

my girlfriend told me they would likely appreciate if i offered to help, as i spent my first few weeks stuck in the house searching for jobs, and it could help get the ball rolling that they had wanted to set in motion for years. i asked her sister if i could start small by throwing out expired food, to which she surprisingly agreed. i spent the next week going through cabinet after cabinet, tub after tub, throwing away moldy, rock hard food, some expiration dates going as far back as 2010. she was grateful, so i pushed even further, sorting odds and ends from the counters into boxes in the basement for her to go through later, making sure to respect her belongings and ask before throwing things out. i made daily trash, goodwill, and recycling runs without having to be asked, and happily organized and scrubbed for hours. over the next three weeks, her, my girlfriend and i spent our nights and weekends cleaning together, and i could tell it eased a lot of the tension. we finally had a table to eat at, a counter to prep food, and both a living room and a basement to relax in. it wasn’t perfect, but it was safe and livable. both her sister and her mother expressed to me their gratitude, and we made plans to not just clean, but to actually decorate. my girlfriend and i were do excited, and made plans to pick up some floating shelves to display some of her sister’s collectibles that she had wanted.

that was, until we put up the shelves today. it triggered something in her sister, who snapped at both of us, took down the shelves and threw them in the basement, and drove off to her mother’s house without another word. on top of this, her brother comes to the house and helps the fiancée move her things out. she told us she was sad to have to go just when the house became clean enough to live in again, but she was sick of feeling policed in what was supposed to be her home. hours later, her sister returns with her mother, sits us down and tells us she was considering kicking us out over the shelves. she then proceeds to go on a rant about how our cleaning feels like she’s being ganged up on, and she can’t find “important”things, like an old dollar tree cup caked in rust supposedly meant to hold straw cleaners. her mom just sat there and agreed, claiming it’s her house and we need to be more respectful. then, they nag about the fiancée, making a scene about the coffee maker and pair of crutches she forgot. the nail in the coffin was when her sister admitted over the two years the fiancée lived here, part of her reason for not cleaning was so she wasn’t able to feel at home.

my girlfriend and i both left the conversation absolutely fuming. she feels like she did when she was a child, less valuable than the junk, and i feel like i wasted a month of time and energy trying to solve a problem that can’t be solved. i’m now pushing my girlfriend to look at apartments with me, as her sister is about to make both of us pay rent, even though we have no clue what we’re doing. i come from an extremely well off family, and my dad has offered to pitch in for an apartment, but they live 7 hours away so that’s about as much help as they can offer. my priority is making sure my girlfriend and i have a safe place, both mentally and physically. i know she loves her family, and she’s financially attached to them no matter what, but i refuse to stand by and watch her destroy herself to fix something she didn’t break. sooooooo basically how do we get out lol",0,1751869759.0,hoarding,2,0.5,False

## What is LynexisTrader Flex?

LynexisTrader Flex is an **online trading platform** that aims to simplify the process of trading across different markets. It lets users trade **cryptocurrencies, forex, stocks**, and even commodities — all from a single dashboard. It’s designed with both beginners and intermediate users in mind, offering **automated tools** for those who want to set-it-and-forget-it, while still giving plenty of manual control if you're someone who likes to get into the weeds.

What stood out to me is how it blends **AI-powered analysis** with a clean UI. You're not just dumped into a chart jungle where you have to figure it all out yourself. The platform offers **real-time market insights**, customizable indicators, and a smart risk management system that helps you avoid rookie mistakes.

## Who Created LynexisTrader Flex?

There isn’t a single name tied to LynexisTrader Flex, which is pretty common in the world of trading platforms. But from what I could dig up, it appears to have been created by a group of fintech developers and quantitative analysts who’ve worked on similar platforms like **Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge**.

The tech team behind LynexisTrader Flex seems to have leaned into building something that’s **user-first** — not just another copycat platform. While the lack of a public founder might be a red flag for some, it’s also fairly standard in this space. The important thing is that the platform operates transparently and provides a smooth user experience, which so far, it does.

## How Does LynexisTrader Flex Work?

LynexisTrader Flex works by combining **real-time data analysis**, **AI-driven trade suggestions**, and a **user-friendly interface** to help users trade better. Once you create an account and make your first deposit, you can either let the platform handle trades based on pre-set parameters or manage trades manually.

Here’s how the system works in simple terms:

- **Data Collection**: It pulls in data from multiple exchanges and market feeds.
- **AI Analysis**: Uses algorithms to spot trends, patterns, and trading opportunities.
- **Execution**: You can choose to accept trade suggestions or set auto-trading rules.
- **Portfolio Management**: Track your assets, profits/losses, and rebalance as needed.

Basically, it’s a **smart trading assistant** that does the heavy lifting but still lets you stay in control.

**Compatible Devices:**
- Windows & Mac PCs
- Tablets (iOS and Android)
- Smartphones (via browser)

There’s no standalone mobile app right now, which is a bummer, but the web version is fully responsive and works just fine on smaller screens.

## LynexisTrader Flex – Supported Countries

LynexisTrader Flex is available in most countries worldwide, especially in regions where **online trading is legal and regulated**. 

According to the info provided during sign-up, the platform supports:

- **United States**
- **Canada**
- **United Kingdom**
- **Australia**
- **Most of Europe**
- **Asia-Pacific regions**

However, if you’re in a country that’s under **OFAC sanctions** or has strict financial regulations (like North Korea, Iran, or Syria), you probably won’t be able to sign up.

## LynexisTrader Flex – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This is where the platform really shines. LynexisTrader Flex uses **algorithmic tools** to scan markets 24/7 and surface trends in real time. It’s like having a full-time analyst watching the charts for you.

Whether you're into crypto or forex, you get **up-to-the-minute data**, which can seriously boost your timing.

### User-Friendly Interface

Honestly, the UI is super clean. No clutter, no confusing options. Everything is laid out logically, and even if you’ve never traded before, you can figure things out within 10 minutes.

It also has **dark mode**, which my eyes appreciate during those late-night sessions.

### Mobile Accessibility

Even though there’s no dedicated app, the **mobile browser version works perfectly**. It resizes well, loads fast, and you can manage trades from your phone without feeling like you’re missing out on features.

I’ve placed and closed trades on the go without any hiccups.

### Customizable Alerts

This one’s a sleeper feature. You can set alerts for **price movements, volume spikes**, or even **technical indicators**. These notifications can be emailed or sent via SMS, so you’ll always know when something needs your attention.

Great for avoiding FOMO or blind holding.

### Multiple Asset Trading

It’s not just crypto — LynexisTrader Flex lets you trade:

- **Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins**
- **Forex pairs like EUR/USD, GBP/JPY**
- **Stocks like Tesla, Apple**
- **Commodities like gold and oil**

That variety means you can diversify without needing multiple accounts on different platforms.

## Is LynexisTrader Flex a Scam?

Short answer: **No, it doesn’t appear to be a scam**.

Longer answer: I’ve tested the platform, read user reviews, and gone through the terms. Everything seems above board. They’re transparent about deposits, fees, and trading risks. Plus, there’s **withdrawal functionality**, which is often the biggest red flag on scammy platforms.

That said, always be cautious. Don’t invest money you can’t afford to lose, and start small to test the waters.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on LynexisTrader Flex?

The **minimum deposit is $250**, which is pretty standard for platforms in this space. It’s low enough to be accessible, but still enough to give the system room to execute trades with some flexibility.

Many of the advanced tools become available once you make this initial deposit, so if you’re serious about trying it out, that’s the price of entry.

### LynexisTrader Flex Customer Support

Customer support is actually solid. There’s a **24/7 live chat**, and I tested it twice — both times I got a response within 3 minutes. They also have email support, but I’d recommend using chat for quicker responses.

No phone support yet, which would be nice, but overall, they’re responsive and helpful.

## How do you start trading on LynexisTrader Flex?

Getting started is easier than making a cup of coffee.

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the official site and enter your **name, email, and phone number**. You’ll get a confirmation email with a link to activate your account.

### Step 3: Start Trading

You’re in! You can either go manual or let the platform trade for you using preset strategies. The dashboard will guide you through setting up your preferences.

## How to Delete a LynexisTrader Flex Account?

If you ever want to bail, you can request account deletion through customer support. They’ll usually ask you to confirm via email, and once that’s done, your data gets wiped.

Just make sure to withdraw any funds before making the request.

In the beginning We used to go to university together for about 2yrs and we subsequently work in the same field. We both love hockey and mountain biking. We also live about 10 minutes apart. Over the 15 years we’ve gone fishing once… gone mountain biking about 6-8 times and gone for lunch or coffee again about 5 times. We text very often… over the last 3-4 years he always declines my invites to meet up, whether it’s go shopping for fishing tackle, try a coffee shop, mountain bike ride… to the point that I’ve seen him once in about 1.5yrs. I’ve put a lot less effort into texting him.. but he still always sends a text, shares a fishing picture, wants to talk shop about a new mountain bike or a trail he rode. I’m kinda tired of this now, though. Last week I invited him over … he says “maybe”… I asked him to go for a trail ride “I’m not sure if I’ll have time”…. Now I find out we are both going to be on the same river next weekend fly fishing in the PNW… I said to him… we should set up in the same spot…. We could bring the mountain bikes and hit a trail ride even! Like how could we not? We just happen to be driving 5 hours to the same spot… I read zero enthusiasm in his response.. very non commital. I sense he will not want to meet up. It feels awful for me. Sometimes I think he has issues, maybe he’s antisocial at heart… I’m just tired of the effort, the texts and in the end the nothingness. If he avoids me next weekend and doesn’t meet up, how should I address this? Should I call him out or bring attention to this? What would be a tactful way to address this?

I just recently came to understand my identity, and I realized that I have only ever felt male when around other people--and I've always hated it. When I was a young kid playing in the yard I'd hide from every car that drove by. As I grew up I chose to spend a lot of time alone even though I felt so lonely. As soon as I had a vehicle, I started hiking far into the mountains--nothing ever felt as peaceful as going days without seeing anybody but my dog. Occasionally I would cross paths with someone, even in the remotest places. I think there's something magical about meeting someone in a place that is impossible to get to without packing a tent (or being an insane trail runner)--especially when it gets gnarly, when it's the shoulder season, snow's coming down wet, the trail is a frigid creek, you're both covered in mud; hardly anyone would choose that, but there you both are. Two souls madly in love with the mountains. But in spite of that special bond, even though I've had some wild and wonderful conversations with people I've met that way, even though those are the kind of people I'm most likely to become friends with, the first thing I feel is my peace shattering. In that moment I can sometimes react standoffishly, without intending to, and I always thought that was strange. But it makes sense now--it's not other people that disturb me. It's how they see me. Some day I'm going to wake up high up on a mountain, frolic in the dewy meadow with my dog, make coffee watching the sun rise, and then I'll run into another mountain-wanderer--and I'll greet them without feeling the need to play a role that never suited me. That will be the happiest day I've ever had.",1,1751869422.0,trans,0,0.67,False
