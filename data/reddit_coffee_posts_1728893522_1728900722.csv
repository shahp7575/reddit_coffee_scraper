1g3cdmw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Split/comments/1g3cdmw/why_is_everyone_in_split_so_rude/,Why is everyone in Split so rude? ,"Hey, 

Just spent 3 days in split coming from London, was dying for some sun and the flights were cheap, so myself and two other mates decided to pull the trigger for a weekend holiday. 

I‚Äôm pretty well travelled. Been all through Asia, America and even lived in Europe for a bit. 

Why are people from Split so insanely rude/inhospitable? For instance, yesterday we went out for dinner and were shouted at by the waiter for ‚Äúsitting on the wrong table‚Äù. 

We went to Kasjuni beach, it was stunning. Although it was quickly ruined when a local came up to us and said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not welcomed here, please move along‚Äù. I‚Äôm sorry WHAT! Who in the right mind acts like that. We‚Äôre respectful, non smoking non drinking professionals. 

We also went to a very local coffee shop off the beaten track and the waiters refused to serve my friend who was Asian, when we asked to pay they threw the bill on the table.

One of my friends in our party was born in Dubrovnik, and speaks Croatian although he is half American so he looks very ‚Äúwestern‚Äù. Every time he spoke to a waiter/worker in Croatian they completely changed. Why treat people a different way just because they look different? It‚Äôs 2024! 

He was super embarrassed all of our holiday and profusely apologised. 

We also went to a bar, for one beer. When we walked in there everyone was looking at us like they literally wanted to kill us.

We spoke to some other travellers in the hotel we were staying at about our experiences and they had similar experiences. 

So I ask, why do Split residents hate tourists? I understand there are a few ‚Äúbad‚Äù tourists but that shouldn‚Äôt ruin it for everyone! It‚Äôs a real shame to be honest, I won‚Äôt be coming back nor recommending it. 

Where does it all stem from? The passive aggressiveness?    ",1,1728900647.0,Split,0,1.0,False

I realized that I'm anxious attachment style, after I broke it off. We had a call which lead him pointing out my self love problem and my anxiety. 

So I studied and learn to control my anxiety, started journaling, read on how secure style does when things is going on. 

I regrated breaking it off, I know I've issues and I wanna fix it for me and for him, I want to ask him to try us again.

We had a talk over at his house ytd, we had a great time, he cooked pasta, made me coffee, hugs me when I cry and he said that it's been awhile since we have these relax talk.

He shared more details of his issues and stress to work on he feel stress and overwhelm for work, so he decided to shut down any emotions, but being with me when he should feel love for me, it kinda disturb his 'no emotion' phase, so he decided he need time to process the issue. that's why he recommended 'taking a break' initially. but i took it negatively which leads to my anxiety to broke things off.

I end up not asking him to give us a try again, but I suggested to keep in contact, since we don't have any bad terms. I told him I hope to have the birthday trip in dec for our birthdays that we've been talking about, after we regulate and work on our at the moment issues and mental health. 

He said he need time to think about it. and I get it, since he's more of a thinker and processer.

But I still have these fear of what there's another girl, what if he choose not to work on his issues, what if he don't want the trip? with these fear, I'm still learning to let go of my control for someone else, accepting the fact that I can't control people. but I'm still learning and trying the accept it.

And I finally said 'I love you' to him ytd, I hope it's not too late for him to hear that.

  
PS: DON'T watch any tarot card readings from YT! It triggered my anxiety and fear of those reading are real. after i did some journaling and focus on work, those feeling cooled down. ",1,1728900403.0,INTP_female,0,0.99,False

1g3c8as,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1g3c8as/any_tips_or_recommendations_on_how_to_deal_with/,Any tips or recommendations on how to deal with the discrimination in Japan?,"Very non political correct rant Japan and experiencing discrimination 

Not sure if this is allowed (I am in no way trying to persuade people not to come, or anything), just wanted to get something off my chest to see what I can do better or any suggestions. 

Been in Japan for several days, and experienced a lot of polite discrimination. As a POC, it‚Äôs a constant discrimination. Not everyone has treated me this way (especially near Mt. Fuji, the people were extremely nice and kind ), this has generally been an issue. And yes, I have witnessed British/Aussie/New Zealand/White people get a more favorable treatment with snobbish attitudes with Japanese and letting their kids do number 1 in a pool. A couple delayed our train by 10 mins arguing about their luggage and I‚Äôve never seen a bus driver provide so much patience and politeness. 

Examples I‚Äôm experiencing:

1.) 
The obvious and I think with just about any foreigner is people will flee from you or not sit by you on the bus/train (it‚Äôs happened way often in Tokyo than Osaka). I‚Äôve been in situations where I sit down not saying a word and someone will get up, act like they are looking at the train schedule and walk a minute away to find another seat. Or stand up rather than sitting next to me (yes I shower everyday and my clothes are brand new). 

*The only time I realized this has not happened is when I put on a mask. You can‚Äôt really tell my race with a mask on so ‚Äúmost‚Äù I noticed will sit by me more often. 

2.)

Or let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs a coffee shop, the moment I sit down most people will leave or eat their food quickly and leave. Or getting on an elevator, etc. Basically, when I come the party is over lol. 

3.)

Hotel wise as well, I‚Äôve realized when they check me in i always was checked in by the elevator (which is the worst place to be in because it‚Äôs hard to sleep people are making noise and trampling), but there are some hotels like the APA hotel where you check in yourself and the system has put me in more favorable areas because I assume it‚Äôs not looking at race. 

I really don‚Äôt think I look crazy or the scare off type (maybe that‚Äôs the case). I have no tattoos, never look mad or aggressive (if you think Pharrell Williams, who is close to who I resemble looks frightening and aggressive then guess I‚Äôm guilty). 99% of time I‚Äôm either sight seeing or minding my own business, making sure to abide by japans laws and not making any problems. No loud music, not talking in trains, eating and walking, no craziness, just a introverted foreigner going about their way in peace. 

4.) 

The one situation that pissed me off recently is I went to a mid tier restaurant recently. I was extremely hungry and didn‚Äôt mind splurging (basically doing a YOLO), and they seat me in a room by a bar. There‚Äôs 2 other guest in this restaurant and we are all distant from each other like a triangle (I‚Äôm secluded at a bar, one is far by a window, and another is in the middle). 

I‚Äôm eating my food, mind my business and I realized 30 mins later they have seated over 4 additional guest of other races and Japanese in the same area but I‚Äôm the only one in the bar area, by myself). It‚Äôs like going to a restaurant and everyone else is inside you‚Äôre the only one outside. 



Japan has alot of amazing things and events to do, but I had 0 idea I would get discriminated against more than the US. I think it‚Äôs my fault though for being na√Øve thinking a homogeneous population wouldn‚Äôt be like that. When I look on here or search on YouTube to you don‚Äôt hear too many people with my experience it‚Äôs just love and joy it seems. 

There‚Äôs a lot of YouTube interviews where they don‚Äôt talk about this or they lightly touch on it (I‚Äôve only seen 3 and literally had to do watch almost the end of their videos to see any honest take). Most of the time you here it‚Äôs safe and they haven‚Äôt had any problems, but bmw 335i owners will tell you it‚Äôs the most reliable car ever made as well. 


This has just been my experience and I‚Äôm trying to make the most of things, smile more, obviously I can‚Äôt change my skin tone (haha), but I guess it is what it is. 

There have been instances though where I‚Äôve seen discrimination against other races. At a famous store that rhymes with okay-mon, I saw a couple from a South American country who were asking about a case and the rep kept telling them everything was sold out (which I‚Äôm pretty sure wasn‚Äôt the case but was her way I guess of not wanting to talk to them or something not sure), but when I asked her anything she was very polite and pulled out her device to find prices and look for items for me. 

I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a lot of black people who have the time of their lives, I think it‚Äôs smarter if you black to go with another person or group, but it‚Äôs kind of frustrating thinking every single time you go somewhere someone is planning to treat you slightly different when you have nothing but good intentions. This isn‚Äôt 100% of the time, it‚Äôs just happening frequently to the point it‚Äôs like kind of annoying (like the BSD issue happening in Windows). 

Like I said, maybe it‚Äôs me, this is just a rant to get off my chest since I‚Äôm here solo by myself so I can only vent out on a phone haha.

1g3c2zt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1g3c2zt/crazy_entitled_assistant_saga_part_3_sofias_petty/,Crazy Entitled Assistant Saga ‚Äì Part 3: Sofia's Petty Revenge! ,"Hello once again amazing people of the Potato Queens Reddit Thread!  I am here with the final update to my crazy assistant experience, The Revenge!

For those who didn‚Äôt read the previous 2 posts, I highly recommend as the context is there. In short, I got a horribly entitles assistant who refused to do her job and mistreated my sweet and caring receptionist. Along with that she had absolutely no computer skills (not even knowledge in basic office like Excel) and after being fired had a total meltdown, trashed my office and had to be dragged off by police after throwing hot coffee at the security guard. 

This whole scene left me and Cat (my receptionist) along with the security guard all going to the beach for a beer, as he had now gotten 2 weeks paid time off and our office was so trashed that a professional cleaning crew had to be called in. 

I have now been given full permission for Dave (the security guard) and Sofia (his amazing wife) to use REAL names while spilling the last bit of tea on this saga. All they asked is to leave the location out.
 
So here we go:
When we left off, we were all sitting on a bar at the beach having a beer and laughing at the situation. I failed to mention earlier that before heading to the beach bar we had a medic cover up Dave's (the security guard) burns after applying aloe gel, so they wouldn‚Äôt get worse. When we arrived to the bar the first thing Dave did of course, was call up his wife to tell her what had happened and where he was, so she wouldn‚Äôt worry if she stopped by the office. We told him to ask her to join us at the beach, since the kids where away with grandma and she happily accepted. 
When she arrived, we called her over to the sided we were sitting at. At first, she didn‚Äôt see the bandages, however when she got closer and spotted them her face started changing.

 I don‚Äôt know how many of you have ever seen a Colombian woman go from happy to dangerously pissed off, but it happens in second and its scary. She turns to me, ignoring her husbands terrified face and pleads to calm down, and she demands to know who did this to her husband.

Lucky for me I had already ordered Sofia a shot of tequila and a beer before she arrived. This wasn‚Äôt my first time meeting Sofia, since she visits Dave at work at least once a week and previously worked with us at the company. I handed her the shot and the beer; we did a salute. I began to tell her what happened from start to finish and I could see the evil wheels in her head turning.

After a few moments of watching her facial ticks and trying to get her to react she finally spoke,
"" Not only does this m!erd@ de put@ assault my husband but she does it by disrespecting coffee!""
(for those who are not await, Colombians take coffee very seriously).

We explained that there was already a police report launched, a law suit will be coming right after and her husband will be generously compensated for what happened, but she wasn‚Äôt having it. 
All she asked is, ""was their milk?"" 
We didn‚Äôt understand what she meant by that so we all nodded ""no"". 

She got up smiling and said she had forgotten something important she needed to pick up and would be back speaking to us later. 
After a few good hours at the bar, we were all ready to head home. Since we had been drinking, Dave thought it best to call Sofia to return and pick us up. When he called her phone there was no answer. He tried over and over again until someone did answer, but it wasn‚Äôt Sofia. The man who answered was a replacement security guard the company had brought in to replace Dave for the next 2 weeks. 

Apparently, Sofia walked right into the security office (Dave is head of security and she had worked with us before having kids, so she knows the entrance code and her way around), got on the camera monitor and found the footage from that morning, along with what car the assistance was driving and where it was parked. She had apparently left her phone in the camera room before going out to get revenge. 
The other security guard told Dave that she was seen going over to the company's industrial fridge and taking out 2 huge gallons of condensed milk.

 Considering the fact that Sofia was a know face in the company no one thought anything of it. It was normal for employees and their partners to take supplies from that specific fridge and leave the tag at the office with their name on it so we know to what account to charge later, as we get a 50% discount on any large purchases. 

The replacement security thought nothing of it at first until he got to see what Sofia did with the gallons of condensed milk on the parking lot camras.

Since the assistant's car was still in the company's private parking lot, due to police having to take her away and no one had come to tow the car yet. Sofia took this opportunity to not only fill up her gas tank with the condensed milk but made also filled the car with it using a small crack left open in' using a shoe horn she had gotten from a close by store. 

After hearing this Dave Sobered up pretty quickly and ordered an Uber to take him back to the company building to make sure his wife doesn‚Äôt get arrested as well. 

We dropped Cat at home since it was already late afternoon and she had a bible class to teach that evening. From there Dave and I continued to the company office building, praying Sofia didn‚Äôt take it too far and that our boss had already left.

When we got to the parking lot there were only 5 cars there; The owner's car, The Employee transportation van for factory workers, The security guard's car, Sofia's car and the assistants car. 

The assistant's car looked find from a far until you got closer and noticed that Sofia had managed to pour more then a gallon into the car itself through the small window crack the assistant had forgotten open. You could hardly see the driver side floor and all the dark fabric seats were soaked in condensed milk.

We went into the security office on the east side of the building to try and find Sofia or at least get her phone back. When we got there, we found the owner of the company along with Sofia and the guard having coffee in the security break room giggling away. 

Apparently after finishing up with the car Sofia went back in to look for her phone and ran into our boss. The boss asked her to come have a coffee with him so they could talk about what happened to get husband and to personally apologize for the incident. 
By the look on our boss's face and the replacement security guards nervous giggling we thought our boss had no idea what Sofia had done. We said hi to everyone and Dave excused himself for a moment, saying he forgot his wallet in the camera room and needed to go get it. 

The replacement security guard followed Dave inside, where he assured him there was no footage of what his wife did, nor proof it was her and our boss doesn‚Äôt know or suspect a thing. A tow truck had already been ordered and will arrive any moment to take the car to the impound lot. I stayed back with Sofia and my boss as he profusely apologized about the incident and remind her over and over that he will be taking care of all legal expense, medical bills and anything else Dave would need. I nodded along quietly as Sofia sat there with a stern expression. 
After about 5 min or so Dave and the other guard came out of the camera room. 

Dave looked at Sofia and I and said,"" Ladies we better get a move on if we want to beat traffic! We should probably leave now"".

We both exchanged pleasant goodbyes with the boss and security guard and were about to leave. As we were talking towards the glass door our boss said one last thing. 

""Oh Sofia, I just wanted you to know that I won't be charging you for the condensed milk you took from the storage fridge since it went to such good use, always a pleasure seeing you dear""
Dave and I were left shocked as Sofia strolled along in front of us with a pleased grin on her face. 

This morning Dave and Sofia were kind enough to drive me to my car as I had left it at the beach bar, (NEVER DRINK AND DRIVE). I got my car and headed into work, hoping for a calm day. When I arrived, I found the ex-assistant standing in front of the security booth yelling at the replacement security guard, demanding they bring back her car ASAP! Luckly he was safe behind the glass. He told her over and over that her car had been towed and where to get it. She again showed what a nice person she was as she cussed and screamed. He had no passions and quickly called the police again to have her removed. 

We later found out her father had bailed her out and she was awaiting a court date. She was also not allowed anywhere need the building until the end of the law suit. We found this out from the officers who had to come get her a second time in 24 hours. When she saw the cop car, she fled the scene telling us this wasn‚Äôt over and we would all be sorry for how we were treating her. The officers stayed with the security guard at the front booth for a couple of hours incase she came back.

I love younger women

I love the energy, curiosity, open-mindedness and enthusiasm of younger women. There is something incredibly sexy about a younger woman who craves new experiences and who is open to experimentation and who approaches it all with a positive attitude.

I am so glad there are younger women out there who crave an older experienced man‚Ä¶I have found that everyone of them I have spoken to love that an older man is interested in ""her"" pleasure as much as he is interested in his own -- Apparently younger men are more focused on themselves.

So thank you to all of you fabulous younger ladies out there!üòõ

That said‚Ä¶I am a fun, discreet, married, educated, tasteful and attractive silver-fox gentleman who wants to intimately explore with you. I prefer soft and sensual over rough, but I find it arousing when my partner likes to have her hair pulled and to be used more rough when our collective passion builds;) I want you to feel safe, cared for, desired, excited, and satisfied. I am tall, slim, fit, hairy chest, nice equipment, and I have a warm, wet, savage tongue.

I am just wanting some fun conversation and to hear the sweet noises you make when we play‚Ä¶and when I make you cum. I promise that I will leave you feeling sexy all over and with no regrets. It will be our sexy secretü§´

1g3c0jz,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicbee/comments/1g3c0jz/radio_automation/,Radio automation,"Hello everyone. 

I am new to this software, and I was wondering if I could use it as a radio automation tool. We are opening a coffee shop, and I would like to have my own radio. Since I bought a ton of music, I was wondering whether I could create three playlists for different parts of the day and automate them so they switch automatically. I would fill them in such a way that there would be a lot of music for each playlist, and they would randomly play songs to avoid repetition. 

So, for instance, in the morning till about noon I would like the software to play jazz, then at noon till dusk I would like it to play blues, and then in the evening rock. Can musicbee do this? Which plugins should I use? Is there a tutorial on a similar topic? I can hardly navigate through info, since there is a lot to this software. I know it's a big question, any general guidelines and pointers would be much appreciated!

 I am asked something and I answer with completely different words in writing or in person. 

I feel overwhelmed that I can't be attentive, that things happen to me while I'm observing them and I don't react. 


And it is extremely difficult for me to tell story something.  

I don't know if it is from coffee, too little sleep, not eating for 10 hours or because I always listen to music with headphones, but I want something to solve this. 

I am currently taking omega 3 concentrated in epa and dha and b complex. what else could i get? ",1,1728898738.0,Supplements,3,1.0,False

i would just like to share also na kahapon lang pala ininvite ako ng isang kaibigan ko kumain. I was done eating when suddenly kinuha ng friend ko yung kutsara ko para kainin yung coffee jelly niya. i was stunned. nataranta ako and i just said may ubo/sipon ako para hindi na nya gamitin but still nagproceed pa rin siya and mocked me na parang inuubo din siya. the whole day I was just thinking about how my life is going to change for acquiring the virus, then ngayon kailangan ko pang isipin yung possibility na makahawa. i know chances are very low to none, pero i just wanna make sure na hindi naman sila mahahawaan from using my recently used spoon right?

They're generally quite good, except for when she uses cloves.

I didn't grow up with this spice so it REALLY stands out to me. It's so incredibly strong and I don't like the scent or flavor yet.

*Especially when I bite into a softened clove chunk by accident. It floods my mouth with a bitter flavor and it's horrible.

I usually try to pick them out first but sometimes they've broken apart. My guess is there's about 2-4 whole cloves per jar of fruit product she makes, cooked in from the start.

Most of my friends are white American and no one else has ever commented on this - I guess it's normal to them from grandma's cooking.

Do I just need to acquire this taste like I did with kimchi and coffee? Or is there too much clove happening?",3,1728898313.0,cookingforbeginners,6,1.0,False

Monday (day 1) taking prescribed adderall 10 mg IR- took it at 2:00 pm had a great day, felt joyful, was able to focus on work, things didn‚Äôt bother me like they normally do (I usually ruminate all day)
1 cup of coffee 

Tuesday (day 2) woke up super early at 8:00 smoked cannabis in the morning to go back to sleep, woke up around 11:00 took my adderall‚Ä¶.just felt sleepy‚Ä¶.so I took a second one and had a great day 
1 cup of coffee. Started my menstrual cycle towards end of day 

Wednesday felt off all day took adderall around 10 am (heavy menstrual cycle which is normal) 

Thursday felt off all day took adderall around 10 am was ruminating all day. (Heavy menstrual cycle which is normal) 

Friday took 1 adderall around 2:00 pm no coffee. Felt major anxiety felt off all day. Felt like crying, felt angry too and resentful. Ruminated all day. Period ended that day 

Saturday: took it around 11;00 am had a cup of coffee later. Felt like crying all day ruminated all day and couldn‚Äôt focus. Felt angry 

Sunday: same as Saturday 



Is this normal? Will things even out or is adderall not the right medication for me? Does weed affect it all? Or coffee?



Not sure what time I should be taking it either since I work the pm

I think it was split 50/50 depending on the council area but I think because of the coffee residue inside it cannot be recycled. 

Also had same discussion as convenience meals packaging like the white plastic containers the microwave meals come in.. If they are fairly scraped/licked/washed/rinsef clean would you put them in the yellow recycle bin or still red general waste bin? 

These are the things that keep me up at night. 

Same with the chip packets with aluminium internal lining but that can be a separate post don't want to crowd this thread too much with recycle questions and information from around the country. ",1,1728897682.0,AskAnAustralian,2,0.67,False

1g3boe2,https://www.reddit.com/r/House1000Designs/comments/1g3boe2/four_square_house_design/,Four Square House Design,"Exploring the Benefits of Four Square House Design for Modern Living
--------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to home design, the four square house design stands out for its unique blend of function and style. This architectural approach, characterized by its symmetrical layout, embraces simplicity while promoting an efficient use of space. Understanding the advantages of this design can help you decide if it‚Äôs the right fit for your modern lifestyle.

One of the primary benefits of the four square house design is its efficient space utilization. The layout typically features two stories with four rooms on the main floor and four rooms above, creating a total of eight functional spaces. This arrangement maximizes the square footage, ensuring that every square inch serves a purpose, making it ideal for small families or those who appreciate minimalism.

Another significant advantage is the practicality and accessibility of the design. With a compact layout, all essential rooms are within close proximity to each other. This is especially convenient for families with children, as it allows for easy supervision and movement throughout the house. Imagine a layout where the kitchen flows effortlessly into the dining area, keeping family meals casual and engaging.

The four square design is also celebrated for its aesthetic appeal. Its geometric shape delivers a classic charm that can complement various architectural styles. Whether you prefer a traditional look with a front porch adorned with columns or a more modern flair that incorporates sleek lines and large windows, the four square house provides a strong foundation for personalization.

Energy efficiency is another reason to consider a four square house design. The compact nature of this layout lessens the amount of exterior wall space, which can often lead to increased energy costs. By minimizing thermal loss, homeowners can enjoy lower utility bills and a reduced environmental impact. For the eco-conscious individual, this is a significant draw.

- **Cost-Effective Construction:** The simplicity of the four square design can lead to lower construction costs. Fewer corners mean less complicated rooflines, which can save money on materials and labor.
- **Adaptability:** As life changes, so can your home. The traditional four square design allows for easy modification. You can renovate or expand to suit your growing needs without losing the original charm.
- **Community Appeal:** Many four square homes are found in neighborhoods that emphasize community living. Their inviting porches and front-facing perspectives encourage interaction with neighbors, fostering a sense of belonging.

Additionally, the integration of natural light in a four square design enhances both mood and energy efficiency. The layout typically features strategically placed windows that not only brighten the spaces but also improve ventilation. Experience a home filled with sunlight, contributing to a warm and welcoming atmosphere for you and your guests.

In today‚Äôs fast-paced world, many are opting for designs that prioritize sustainability and mindful living. The four square house design aligns well with these ideals, encouraging homeowners to simplify their lives through thoughtful home environments. By reducing clutter and promoting functional spaces, you can create a home that supports an organized lifestyle.

Consider the possibilities of outdoor spaces as well. A four square house typically includes a yard that complements the design. You can create a beautiful garden or a relaxing patio area to enrich your outdoor living experience. This connection to nature not only enhances your home but can improve your overall well-being. Imagine enjoying a morning coffee on your porch or hosting friends in a cozy backyard.

The benefits of the four square house design are numerous, ranging from efficiency to aesthetic appeal. Its practicality, energy efficiency, and adaptability make it an excellent choice for modern living. Whether you are a first-time homeowner or looking to downsize, this architectural style might just be the ideal solution for your housing needs.

Ultimately, as you explore various home designs, consider how the four square design can impact your life positively. This timeless approach to architecture not only offers function but also invites you to create a loving home that fits your lifestyle beautifully.

Innovative Customization Ideas for Four Square Floor Plans
----------------------------------------------------------

When designing a home, the layout is just as important as the aesthetics. Four square floor plans are a popular choice due to their efficient use of space and timeless appeal. If you‚Äôre looking to personalize your four square house design, there are countless innovative ideas to make it truly yours. Here are some creative suggestions to inspire your customization process.

### Optimize the Layout

The classic four square plan typically divides the space into four equal areas. Here‚Äôs how to elevate that structure:

- **Open Concept Living:** Consider removing non-load-bearing walls to create an open space. A flowing kitchen, dining, and living area can enhance both movement and lighting.
- **Multi-Functional Rooms:** Designate rooms with dual purposes. A home office can double as a guest bedroom with the addition of a Murphy bed.
- **Flex Spaces:** Incorporate areas that can change usage according to your family‚Äôs needs. This could be a playroom that later becomes a gym or media room.

### Enhance Natural Light

Natural light can transform a four square house design, making it feel warm and inviting. Here are some innovative ways to achieve this:

- **Strategic Windows:** Use larger, strategically placed windows to allow more light into your home. Consider floor-to-ceiling windows in main living areas.
- **Skylights:** Installing skylights can be a beautiful way to bring in light without sacrificing privacy, particularly in bedrooms or bathrooms.
- **Light Tubes:** Similar to skylights, light tubes can brighten darker corners of your home, guiding natural light through tunnels from the roof.

### Exterior Customization

The outside of your four square house is just as important as the interior. Here are some exterior ideas to create greater curb appeal:

- **Unique Siding:** Experiment with different materials like wood, stone, or modern metal. This adds texture and character.
- **Distinct Roof Design:** A gabled or flat roof offers a different look compared to the traditional. Choosing a bold color can make it stand out even more.
- **Landscaping:** Incorporate gardens, hardscapes, and pathways that complement your four square design. Consider a Zen garden for a peaceful retreat.

### Interior Aesthetic Innovations

The interior of a four square house allows for creative expressions with furniture and decor:

- **Bold Color Schemes:** Don't shy away from color. Dark navy walls in a living space can create a dramatic effect, paired with lighter furniture to balance it.
- **Custom Built-Ins:** Build bookshelves, benches, or even a breakfast nook that fits seamlessly within the four square format.
- **Artful Lighting:** Use a mix of ambient, task, and accent lighting. Unique light fixtures can also act as conversation starters while illuminating your space.

### Eco-Friendly Features

Sustainability into your four square house can enhance both its function and value:

- **Energy-Efficient Windows:** Invest in double or triple-pane windows that keep your home insulated and reduce energy costs.
- **Solar Panels:** A stylish addition to your roof can significantly lower your carbon footprint and provide energy independence.
- **Rainwater Harvesting:** Consider installing a rainwater collection system for watering your garden, enhancing your home's eco-friendliness.

Ultimately, customizing a four square house design can be an exciting journey that reflects your personal style and functional needs. With careful planning and creative ideas, your home can become a unique sanctuary tailored just for you. Transform every inch of this classic structure to create a space that embodies both beauty and purpose, ensuring it feels like home from the moment you step through the door.

### Conclusion

The Four Square house design stands out for its blend of practicality and charm, making it an excellent choice for modern living. Its solid structure and efficient use of space cater perfectly to families and individuals alike. As you explore the benefits of this design, you will discover how it promotes a sense of community and comfort, emphasizing the importance of connectivity within the home. The open spaces and well-defined rooms create an inviting atmosphere, perfect for both relaxation and socializing.

When considering innovative customization ideas for Four Square floor plans, the possibilities are truly inspiring. From eco-friendly materials to smart home technology, your Four Square home can be tailored to suit your lifestyle while also embracing sustainability. You can incorporate unique elements like a cozy reading nook or a sunlit home office, ensuring that every corner of the house reflects your personal style.

The timeless appeal of the Four Square design lies not just in its historical roots but in its adaptability to contemporary life. By choosing this type of home, you are investing in a structure that can evolve with your needs, providing both comfort and functionality. Whether you are drawn to traditional designs or modern finishes, the Four Square house offers a versatile foundation for your ideal living space. By embracing its benefits and customization options, you can create a home that not only meets your expectations but also enriches your daily living experience.",1,1728897476.0,House1000Designs,0,1.0,False

Pahingi naman nang opinion ninyo about my situation I'm 25M, so i had this ex of mine 27F we broke up and had no contact for 7 months. Our relationship naman was ended as mutual decision no bad blood at all, so my dilemma lang ngayon nag chat kasi sya netong last week out of the blue while i was working(wfh naman) na ngungumusta sya asking how am I, so inentertain ko naman sya kasi hindi naman sya stranger at na curious din ako as to why. 

So the whole night mag ka usap kami hanggang sa na punta kami sa usapang ""why don't we start over"" i was caught off guard by this kasi i was not expecting this from her at all, but as a tanga i gave it a chance since okay naman in the first place yung relationship naman at all no 3rd party involve sadyang nag ka pagudan lang. So our conversation continued and nakapag set agad kami nang date and time to catch up para mag usap on how we want to continue.

So habang mag ka usap din kami that night i asked her din kamusta naman sya and tinanong ko kung may nakaka date or how was her dating life recently, and then nag kwento sya about sa guy na nakilala nya sa bumble but ended last month(wait the plot about this). So ayun fast forward after nya mag kwento about doon i asked her kasi ang dating was ginagawa mo akong rebound and she apologized if ganon daw yung dating nung situation, so ako naman i went along and shrug it out.

So tapos fast forward tayo nag punta lang kami sa coffee shop sa may BGC so nung naka uwi na kami we shared out thoughts about our catch up ganon, so ang context nang naging usapan namin was we agreed na mag ddate muna kami for a while para ma punan yung 7-8 months na walang kami, honestly okay naman yung ganong set up since mag sisimula kami ulit. So nung naka uwi na kami both we continued talking the whole night and then hanggang sa sinabi nya na nag llie daw sya about something. (Eto na yung plot).

So i asked her kung ano yung sinasabi nyang hindi totoo sa akin and then she replied the truth is hindi daw talaga nag end yung sa kanila nung guy last month, nag end daw yung sa kanila nung guy the day na chinat nya ako and i was shocked by the truth. After nyang sabihin yun she apologized multiple times sa situation namin ngayon kasi honestly i was traumatized about what she did. Idk what to do with this ang ending ko tuloy back to 0 ako.

She admitted na she had fillings pa din with the guy na ginago sya(na ghost sya nung guy) nung nag chat sya sa akin, and then I asked her if the guy decided to comeback sino sino yung i ppick nya and she answered this time papairalin daw nya yung utak nya so she answered me but i am hurt bug time na that time up until now.

So our conversation continued tapos i clarified her if totoo paba yung mga sinabi nya sa akin nung nag uusap kami about starting over and then she replied genuine daw yung mga sinabi nya sa akin but i doubt her na, nung umamin pala sya i asked her what's on her mind bakit out of all people ako yung napili nyang i chat and then she replied natakot daw sya the reality hit her na kumilala nang bago tapos gagaguhin lang din naman sya so pumasok sa isip nya na what if ayusin nalang yung sa amin and then the rest is history.

I did the meditation this morning, and I've gotta say, today has been a real blessing. Everything's been flowing smoothly even had a random coffee with my neighbor that turned into a deep chat. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs a positive vibe around me that wasn't there before.

Think of what you need. Looking for a beach sunset for your travel blog? Type ""beach sunset"" into the search bar. It's that easy.

# Step 2: Preview Resources & Select Size

Browse through the results and pick your favorite. Choose the size that fits your needs ‚Äì whether it's for Instagram, your website, or a printed brochure.

# Step 3: Download & Enjoy

Click download, and voila! Your perfect visual is ready to use. No complicated licensing agreements, no watermarks to remove.

# My Experience as a Beta Tester

I had the privilege of beta testing StocksBreeze AI, and let me tell you, it's a game-changer. As someone who struggles with design (stick figures are my specialty), I was blown away by how easy it was to create professional-looking graphics.

One project stands out. I needed to create a series of social media posts for a client's product launch. Normally, this would have taken me hours of scouring stock photo sites and fumbling with Photoshop. With StocksBreeze AI, I had a set of 10 eye-catching posts done in under an hour.

The AI image generation feature was particularly impressive. I typed in ""futuristic gadget on minimalist background,"" and boom ‚Äì I had a sleek image that looked like it came straight out of a high-end tech magazine.

The video editing tools also saved my bacon when I needed to create a quick product demo. I combined stock footage, added some text overlays, and even threw in a royalty-free music track. The result? A polished 30-second video that the client loved.

The real kicker? When the client asked for some last-minute changes, I didn't break a sweat. The intuitive editing tools meant I could make tweaks on the fly, without having to start from scratch.

In short, StocksBreeze AI turned me from a design novice into a content creation wizard. If it can do that for me, imagine what it could do for you.

1g3bfpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g3bfpo/im_wanted_for_the_bombing_of_a_public_bus_it_was/,"I'm wanted for the ""bombing"" of a public bus. It was so much worse than that.","I've done some bad things in my life. Things I was never proud of, but they always felt necessary in the moment. I stuck to theft and counterfeiting mostly, but had a couple heavier gigs when I was younger. I'd never thought of myself as evil though. I don't really know now. A lot of innocent and unknowing people are dead through my ignorant actions. I've done some really, really bad things now, and I don't know if anyone will find out about it unless I say something myself.

Right near the end of the 90's I met a guy on one of those more serious gigs who was called Grin. A bear of a man, probably 6'4 or taller and at least 250lbs with a wild black beard. He was Eastern European, only ever mentioned home a couple times in the limited conversations we had over the years, but I think he said he was from Belarus? Always wore a ratty denim jacket and a black touque. The kind of guy who was inconspicuous only due to the fact that nobody wanted to look his way. I asked him why the other guys on the crew called him Grin and he didn't respond, just gave me a vicious scowl and a stare like a snake coiling to strike. One of the others replied, ""The fucker's never grinned, not once, and this is my fourth job with him.""

Grin was a goddamn talent though, tell you what. Deft fingers with the building locks, and a solid brick of a left hook that laid flat two guards we didn't anticipate. Those guards were no joke, as I restrained their hands with zip-ties I noticed both of them had military tattoos. It was a small building but the security was way above what we anticipated, and Grin was pretty much the only reason we got in and out under five minutes. We were stealing engineering blueprints for some kind of medical equipment, seemed almost like an insulin pump but bigger. I'd normally have never taken a job that amounted to industrial espionage, but the client came recommended by a bookie I'd know for years named Emilio. He'd always done right by me and I trusted his word. When I went to drop off the goods a day later, the other guys on the crew sent Grin with me to the pickup with Emilio and his client. 

The meetup was in a strip mall parking lot. I've found that if you aren't doing something obviously illegal it's usually best to commit crimes in broad daylight while most people are distracted with their own day-to-day routines. Emilio and another guy were already there waiting for us in an older but still very nice Buick. The client got out of the car and introduced himself as Grigori. He looked to be in his late 60's with pale skin, sunken eyes, and when he spoke he had a thick Eastern accent. When he began to talk to us Grin immediately replied back in what I'm pretty sure was Russian. They talked to each other for a couple minutes while Emilio and I said hi, and I was shocked to notice Grin smiling happily in discussion when I looked back.

After a few more minutes of conversation Grin finally popped the hatch of my beat-ass Volkswagen Rabbit and handed Grigori the medical pump we'd stolen. Grigori seemed incredibly pleased, even switching back to English to thank both of us and give us $2500 cash each on top of the $20k we were splitting four ways with the other two guys from the job.

Now, I'll assume everyone can understand this, but it's pretty common knowledge to not ask a client why you're breaking the law for them. That being said this was so different than anything else I'd stolen before, and as I mentioned before I'd never exactly planned on being involved in industrial espionage. So my curiosity got the best of me and I asked Grigori what the pump was for. He stiffened immediately and lost all the pleasantness in his face. Staring darkly at me, he replied, ""Not good manners in our line of work to ask why someone needs something after they already paid you for it, but I will forgive it this time. The pump is a medical system built by... a former business partner. He stole the designs from its original inventor, my eldest brother Anton. Anton died last month with not a penny to his name and only me at his deathbed. His life was ruined by Viktor's betrayal of us when he stole the first Reliquary prototype from our offices back in Croatia three years ago. I did everything I could to find the Reliquary for Anton, but alas, too late to show him his work wasn't in vain.""

That night while I laid in bed with some twink I'd picked up after going out drinking, I got to thinking about a couple things that didn't sit right with me. Firstly, Grigori himself. He seemed to have at least a degree of wealth, wealthy enough to get lawyers to go against his former partner Viktor if everything had been copacetic. Secondly, I didn't know much about medical research, but I was pretty sure no groups working above-board would need ex-military security in a facility no larger than your average warehouse. And lastly, the device we stole. I did my best to not act shocked while talking to Grigori, but I knew the word ""reliquary"" from an old Catholic neighbor in my childhood. A reliquary was a vessel for holy relics. Why they hell would they name a supposed medical pump after something meant to contain holiness?

Slowly over time the job and the questions regarding its specifics left my mind. Did a couple more jobs with Grin before losing contact in '01. Years passed, I got incarcerated for a four year term, and when I was back out and free it was May 2007. Not two weeks after my release, I was leaving a meeting with my C.O when I saw a familiar face. Grin, scowling as always, was standing across the street at a bus stop. Having nobody I still knew but a couple cousins I barely spoke to and an ailing grandmother, I took my shot and ran across the street to catch Grin. Hopped on the bus right behind him and sat down a seat ahead. After two stops I turned around to him and stared him right in his dead eyes.

""Grin, you don't even remember me, do you?"" I asked as I sneered at him. He didn't answer for a good twenty seconds, just boring a hole right into my soul with a hollow look.
""No, I just wish I never met you. You made me meet Grigori. We stole for a demon. I have a gift now."" He choked out as his body began shuddering, the intimidating man seemingly choking back sobs while sitting on the bus. The noise he was letting out wasn't like a sob though, more like someone sucking air through a broken windpipe. It was a ghastly sound, and a couple of other passengers turned to look in mixed confusion and concern.

I won't lie, I got up and started to back away right then. I'd never seen Grin show any real emotions, except the one time I remembered seeing him smile. The day we met Grigori. But now that I reassessed him, Grin barely even looked human. It was a thin facade that barely passed initial inspection. Grin seemed like nothing more than a skinsuit... A Grinsuit. 

Pale skin hung over organs and bones, with bloodshot eyes sunken into a face barely more than a skull. And his eyes... swear to God I'll never forget that look. I can't believe I didn't catch it at first. They were glazed over and dry, looking nowhere in particular even as the attempt was made to stare at me. I was looking into the eyes of a corpse. The corpse of a man I once knew, up and walking around. Even worse, sitting in an enclosed space with me and regular people just trying to commute.

Before I could even begin to comprehend the reality of my situation, Grin's jaw opened far too wide, comically large, unhinging like a snake with far too many rows of teeth. In a writhing and grotesquely inhuman burst of movement, the Grinsuit twisted its legs like two springs, bones snapping and compound fracturing through the skin as it sprung off the rear seats of the bus.

I'll never forget the calamity that ensued. That abomination sprung forward off its destroyed legs with enough force to shatter the windows of the bus and open the rear of the vehicle like a sardine can, the back landing on a cyclist behind us and crushing the young woman. I learned all their names after. Francesca Paoli, 24, cycling to her job as a bank teller. She was the first to die.

Two, three and four died as the Grinsuit leapt forward and two footlong spikes of bone sprung from its wrists, slashing as it spun through the air.
Robbie Engleton, 35, divorced cook, father of one.
Mahmoud Abbas, 64, grandfather of five and retired firefighter.
Teagan Sumner, 20. She had just started an IT firm internship. I tried to hold her throat closed but there was almost none of her trachea remaining.

It twisted again and leapt off the back of the driver's seat, shattering his spine and pulping his organs. Jackson Owusu, 40, proposed to his girlfriend of six years only a week earlier. Spiralling through the air, the Grinsuit's jaws closed as it leapt at me and I flailed behind a seat, stumbling over Teagan's body. An elderly woman was still sitting in front of me, probably in shock. Tonya Blake, 76, widower and great-grandmother. Her head was torn from her shoulders right before the jaws snapped shut, taking two of my fingers and part of my hand with it. I still don't know how I didn't lose my whole arm. Six dead in the span of ten seconds.

My body reacted on pure survival instinct as I threw myself out of a shattered window, slicing myself up on the glass shards before crumpling onto the street in a heap. I was on my knees and trying to stand as one of those bone spikes from its arm pierced my foot, pinning me to the concrete. I screamed and fumbled in my jacket pockets, knowing that if I didn't get what I needed in time I'd be swiftly dismembered or devoured whole. 

I couldn't even fully turn over with the spike through my foot, but I turned as much as I could when I heard that guttural sucking sound getting close to me. The Grinsuit's breath shuddered behind me as it choked out a few words.

""We can share the Reliquary with you as well. You can be... more.""

I flicked my Zippo open and pressed down on the can of Axe bodyspray I had on me, screaming wordlessly as I sprayed fire into the gaping maw above me. Then, a flash of light, and nothingness.

I woke up two hours later in the hospital, cuffed to a bed. Two government-type spooks stood at the door, sunglasses indoors. Couldn't have been more obvious if they had tried. Still dazed, it took a bit for what they began saying to sink in. I was being held as the sole suspect in a transit bombing that had killed seven people. I didn't even try to beg or plead my case, I knew exactly what was happening. I was going down as a scapegoat. Far easier than actually trying to explain whatever the fuck had actually happened, if they even could explain it.

I still don't fully understand how they didn't catch me when I ran away. I dipped out of my room when one guy went for coffee and the other decided to take a piss. Cracked him over the head with a walker as he stepped out of the bathroom, then I connected him to my heart monitor. Switched into his shirt and pants, threw on his shoes, and walked straight to the elevators before anyone had realized I was gone. Passed by a couple of police in the main lobby but nobody stopped me.

I skipped town later that afternoon after walking to the highway and trying to hitch a ride. Some farm workers stopped for me eventually and drove me about 40 kilometers to the edge of the the second town out from the city. I broke into a car and stole a wallet and laptop, got lucky with $430 inside it. From that I booked a motel room and grabbed a burger from a family restaurant across the parking lot. 

I ate my meal and sat in silence. I didn't go to sleep either, I couldn't. I didn't know any of their names yet, but I saw their faces behind my eyes. Burned into my retinas. And deeper still, a black tumor of thought. Those lightless eyes in sunken pale sockets, twisted limbs and jagged bones, and a drooling void with innumerable teeth. 

I thought back on the Reliquary. A device that we were told was a medical pump, named for a religious vessel meant to contain holiness. With what I had seen and couldn't unsee, I could only come to one insane conclusion.

The Reliquary somehow put a demon into the person connected to it. 

I left just before dawn to begin my search. I wouldn't be able to clear my name without some kind of evidence, and six people were dead because of me. It took me another four years to find him, but I met Grigori again. I wish I hadn't. So many people are gone because of me.",2,1728896331.0,nosleep,0,0.75,False

I embody beliefs in speech and preach, bleed the color red,

Seen some iridescents shoot at coffee colored people, fade to black,

The trife of a white man with thoughts of revolution in his head,

Disgusted in disbelief, retch out a putrid green stink, that googol tons of bleach couldn‚Äôt begin to resolve,

Seen the states thirst for power when I should hope they dissolve,

Cause they don‚Äôt empathize with any of our problems at all,

Emphasis is on the money not the people it serves,
And when the sun heeds our call they will all get what they deserve,

All I wanna see is red and modernized camo,

people of all ethnicities march with their guns and their ammo,

Outfitted in solidarity we all feel badass kike Rambo,

Taking the world by storm, lighting strikes a preamble,

For the bullets that will rain upon their heads from commandos,

Guerilla in our form, and gorilla in ferocity, survival of the fittest, an unfinished philosophy,

Strength is in numbers that‚Äôs simple militar-ology,

Cause if we stand together as one, there‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs stopping me,

Not in our flesh but our souls we express one will, 

For peace to end the violence and oppression we‚Äôll kill,

Tread lightly cause my semi‚Äôs not of a remorseful conscious,

If PAC can take 5, no reason I can‚Äôt take plenty,

Revolutionary suicide, they‚Äôll reside in our memories,

Every life is so precious but a just cause demands more,

And in our material reality that justifies our war,
For every person that acknowledges something bigger than themselves,

We all take one step forward toward sharing the wealth,

That we‚Äôre all entitled to by birthright in itself,

Being humble isn‚Äôt about thinking less of yourself, it‚Äôs thinking less about yourself and more about everything else,

A lesson in humility is something that the capitalist fear,

And the point of revolution is upon us, so near,
Be ready and arm yourself, 

In the pursuit of liberty and justice for all,
We are on the right path dear

1g3ba16,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1g3ba16/the_night_visitor/,The Night Visitor,"Tom had worked the night shift at St. Agnes Hospital for years, patrolling the empty halls while the rest of the city slept. It was a routine job, quiet and peaceful‚Äîuntil that one night.

He was stationed near the children‚Äôs ward, sipping coffee to keep himself awake. The glow of the emergency lights reflected off the sterile white floors, casting long shadows. It was around 2:30 a.m. when he felt a gentle tug on his pant leg. 

Startled, he looked down and saw a little girl, no older than six, clutching a worn-out stuffed rabbit. Her pale face was framed by thin, blonde hair, and her wide, terrified eyes looked up at him.

""Why are you out of bed, sweetheart?"" Tom asked, his voice soft but firm. It wasn‚Äôt unusual for children to get restless at night, but something about her made his heart beat faster.

The girl hesitated, glancing back towards the dimly lit corridor that led to the ward. ""The woman‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs scaring me. She keeps asking us to come with her."" Her voice was a barely audible whisper.

Tom frowned, a cold chill creeping up his spine. ""What woman? There shouldn't be anyone in the ward except the nurses.""

The girl‚Äôs lower lip quivered, and she gripped her rabbit tighter. ""I don‚Äôt want to say yes like the others. But she keeps asking.""

A cold wave of dread washed over him. His hand instinctively went to the holster at his waist, gripping the handle of his sidearm. He stood, gently taking the girl‚Äôs hand. ""Stay close to me.""

Together, they made their way down the hall toward the children‚Äôs ward. Tom‚Äôs footsteps echoed unnervingly in the silence. When they reached the ward, he stopped in his tracks, his blood running cold.

The room was empty. Every bed was vacant. The blankets neatly folded, and not a single child in sight.

""Where are they?"" he muttered, his grip tightening on the girl‚Äôs hand.

The little girl pressed closer to him, her eyes wide with fear. ""They went with her.""

Tom's heart pounded in his chest as he looked around. There was no sign of struggle, no alarm had been triggered. It was as if the children had simply‚Ä¶ vanished.

Desperation growing, he led the girl back to the security office. If something had happened, it would be on the cameras. He sat her down in a chair and hurried to the monitor, his fingers trembling as he rewound the footage from the children's ward.

His stomach lurched as the grainy black-and-white footage came into view.

The camera showed the children standing in their beds, all of them wide awake, their eyes fixed on something in the middle of the room. Something invisible. Their lips moved in unison, chanting something he couldn't hear. 

Then, all at once, they turned toward the door and walked out of the frame, their steps slow and deliberate. But what froze Tom in place was what happened next.

As the last child left the room, the camera flickered. For a brief moment, the outline of a figure appeared‚Äîa tall, thin woman with long dark hair, her face a blur of shadows. The children had been speaking to her. And then, in the blink of an eye, they were gone. 

The footage ended, leaving Tom staring at the screen, his hands shaking. He turned to the girl, still sitting quietly in the chair.

""Do you know who she is?"" he asked, his voice hoarse.

The little girl shook her head, her eyes welling with tears. ""She just keeps asking if we want to leave. And the others‚Ä¶ they all said yes.""

Tom‚Äôs breath caught in his throat. He had no idea what to do. He grabbed his radio, but all that came through was static. The entire hospital seemed unnaturally quiet, as if it was holding its breath.

He felt a gust of cold air sweep through the room. Slowly, he turned around. There, at the edge of the shadows, stood the woman from the footage‚Äîher form faint, almost transparent, but undeniably there. Her eyes were hollow pits of darkness, and a thin, eerie smile stretched across her face.

Tom clutched the little girl tightly as the woman‚Äôs voice filled the room, soft and sing-song, like a distant lullaby. 

""Come with me‚Ä¶""

He backed away, heart pounding in his ears, but the woman only stepped closer, her eyes fixed on the girl. 

Tom knew, deep down, there was nothing he could do to stop her.

I almost added 1 spoon of grounded silver oak blue tokai coffee but it was still showing 7gms, I added more.
2. I thought I will use tds meter for water temperature. I boiled water but tds meter was still showing 35¬∞(later i get to know it can only take temp upto 40¬∞),I waited but water was reducing. 
So I added more water and get as bubble were showing I used that water.
3. I added 11gms coffee according to weighing machine in chamber before that I insert filter paper in filter cap.
4. All was on weighing machine,cup,chamber,coffee in chamber and I was tare button as I add some thing.
5. Added 200gm water that water that I mentioned at #2.
6. Removed all thing from weighing machine.
7. Without using plunger my coffee comes in coffee cup instantly. Only small amount of coffee remain in chamber 
8.Then I press plunger my cup was already filled and other coffee spill out of cup. 
9. I still drank it but it was okay a little bitter but not good.

I've been attracted to the idea of spending a while (\~1 month) in a place that others might find a little strange / boring for such a long time. Where locals might question - why are you here? (in a friendly way). Maybe somewhere that has some value, like good hiking / scenery, but otherwise not much going on.

I tend to be attracted to places where I can have access to a good desk / coworking place. But this naturally means I spend time where there are other tourists and lots of things to do.

Send me your examples, with where you stayed, how you got there, where you went shopping for food, and what was so good about it?

I think the closest I've come to this experience is probably recently in **Lake Ohrid (North Macedonia)**. It is hardly remote, and has some tourism, but felt a little off the beaten path particularly outside of summer. I felt this qualifies a little because we were in an apartment in a very residential area on the outskirts, near the lake and near some great hiking routes.

 30 y/o male, a Girl I have a crush on ghosted me and hangs out with my best friend while living at my best friends brothers house because she just broke up with her bf. We all went camping together and i thought i had a connection. I should be happy that it's my best friends time and not mine but im jealous, sad and left wondering in general what's wrong with Me. I don't live at home my mom doesn't do my laundry and make all my lunches like my friends mom does for him and I'm an independent person. It hurts when I put all this effort into myself and nobody notices or cares. All the attention in our friend group goes to my best friend when it comes to meeting a mutual friend for a potential partner. I've tried matching on tinder bumble ect but I don't get matches ever and it gets exhausting. I've been living my ""best life"" like everyone says focus on yourself ect and someone will come along. Well that girl has come along, one that literally is everything I wanted, and now I want too be with this woman and I dont seem fit or attractive or whatever the case is in her  eyes, you can't make people like you. I live in a small town up north and work as a carpenter it's hard meeting quality people. I workout daily, go to the boxing gym to blow off steam and eat clean and lean. Also I really like doing arts and crafts and in general doing nice things for people. I get treated like shit at most of the places I've worked because of being nice and different and people take advantage and think im simple or something. Life is getting exhausting, I met another girl I liked that worked at a coffee shop. I gave her chocolates and a nice card for xmas and never got any reciprocation, just looked at weirdly. As a young male who has been single for 6 years and really wants a connection, and has their shit together, what can I do? I can't sleep properly and it's all I think about is what they are doing, the brothers have an amazing family and I live on my own and can't offer that kind of environment as I live in a condo and don't have a big property with boats and four wheelers ect. I'm just a young man who works hard and is on the up and coming with no help from my parents or really anyone. My car died last month, my cat died, I lost my job over a horrible boss getting in my face trying to fight me, found a new job the same day he lost it on me spitting in my face. I also pulled my back out and messed my hand up. So there is alot going on. I do think about suicide often, I got a new vehicle and think about taping the exhuast to the window and throwing a tarp over top of the thing but also that would be me giving up and the part of me that is in spite of this world too doesn't want that. I reel myself in. I feel like I need help because it's a vicious circle of trying, not getting the results, and then the world laughing at me. My best friends with my dream girl and me going crazy because of it. I know there is other opportunities to arise but I feel like I've been trying for years and my friend seemingly gets fed opportunities by his brother who is supposed to be my friend and maybe help.me out? Maybe they dont like me? Or maybe they think im crazy? Maybe they don't want to setup a failure or maybe she just doesn't like me. Life is rough man I asked God for strength and im not religious, but I am sent these hard times. It's supposed to make you stronger, but I just get pissed off about everything going wrong and get so worked up I just want to destroy the heavybag. It becomes a viscous circle and i don't know how long I can hug my pillow and cry myself to sleep. Cheers yall

Thank you so much for all you comments and reaching out to me! I don't know what I excepted when I posted, I guess I wanted to receive some unbiased feedback from an outside perspective, but I never expected this. I was really overwhelmed with how kind and nice most of you were so once again thank you and sorry for not being able to reply to all the comments! For those who were not on the same page, I understand and respect that you have a different opinion. From my initial post I have left out a lot of details because it's a long story but some of you were curious about what actually happened and asked me to provide more details so buckle up, I will do just that. 

*How I met my future husband* - I got asked a lot if I live in a trailer park or small town with only a bar available üòÖ. The answer is no, we actually live in a big city with a population of a couple millions of people. I met my fianc√© through a mutual friend. My girlfriend was dating one of George's colleagues and they all began to hang out for drinks after work since they were all in the same building. At some point I had no plans for that day and my girlfriend invited me to go with them to a bar and this is how we were introduced. After this we started having different group activities together and things slowly progressed. 

*George targeted his ex's younger SIL to spite her/there was no coincidence that we started dating* - as absurd as it may sound it was indeed an ironic coincidence. You may think out of the millions of people there are in a city, what are the chances for you to start dating your SIL's ex.  Well it happened to me and we did not know about it in the beginning.  The girlfriend that asked me to go with them to a bar did not know Ella, never saw her IRL and she never saw her with George. When George met me he had no idea that I had any connection to Ella, so there was no chance for him to be an evil mastermind and intentionally date me just to spite her. I did not take George home to meet my family immediately either. Maybe I am the weird one but I was never the type to parade my boyfriends in front of my parents if I was not sure the relationship was going to last.

*I broke the girls code* - I do not consider that I did. Let's be clear, I have a couple of true friends, they have been my friends for many years and I would do anything for them. I am a very loyal person and I know the girls code very well. When we eventually found out the connection Ella had with both of us, I was shocked and I asked the same question that many of you did - what were the chances? It was a very uncomfortable position to be in. Even though I had no relationship with Ella except the obvious one of her being my SIL, it was strange to know that they dated. I wanted to find out what happened before taking any decision and I did. The way I saw things - there was no reason for me to ""punish"" George for having a past. We were in love, we were happy and Ella was already married to my brother. I may have been selfish but I thought is this man and our relationship worth it? And the answer was yes, to me he was, is and will always be worth it.  Also, we see my brother and Ella only a couple of times/year. Most of the times (for obvious reasons) we prefer to visit my parents separately. 

*George's addictions* - so many of you reached out to me being concerned about this and I wanted to thank you for caring and say I am sorry you had to go through traumatic experiences with addicts.  Some of your stories were hard to read and I appreciate immensely that you were open to share your experiences with a stranger. I understand why most of you were triggered by my story but George was not that type of addict. He had a lot of unresolved trauma, he was lonely, unloved and ashamed so his coping mechanism were parties, alcohol and drugs. His entourage was also not the best...you can imagine that a bunch of 36 years old party-boys/girls are no good but at the end of the day when everyone else went home to their families, wives and kids, these were the people who could provide company to George. I think it was more like all of them providing company to each other so they could feel less lonely. But other than this, George was a functional adult, he had a stable well paying job (he was and is still working as a software engineer), he was never violent etc. 

*George changed for me* - no, George changed for himself and because he wanted to. He told me that I was the trigger that made him want to get his life in order but in a more meaningful way than just wanting to get into my pants. When we started hanging out as a group with my friend and his colleague, he learned how easy it was to interact and have fun without drugs or alcohol. He also saw that I enjoyed spending time with him, I looked forward to seeing him every time and he understood that his sober self is not unlovable.  He was longing for healthy relationships and normality but until that moment he felt like he was not deserving to have them. I think the way I helped him was solely because I saw and fell in love with his true self and that gave him confidence and purpose. 

*I am the golden child* - there is no such thing in our family, my parents love my brother and I the same. Of course when they heard Ella's BS the first time they were worried for me but I was open with them. I told them how things happened, George was honest and never hid his troubled past from them and in the end they were ok with our relationship. My parents trust me, trust my judgment and they only want to see me happy. And in regards to Ella, my parents are just doing what every parent should: defend their child. She was warned before. My parents talked to her, asked her to stop acting like this and told her she is out of line so it's not like they kicked her out the first time it happened. 

Now into the UPDATE: 

Yesterday I contacted my brother and asked him to meet me for coffee. It was only the two of us and I think it was the first time I have opened my heart like this in front of him. I started off by apologizing for him being caught in the middle but I told him I will never apologize or be sorry for loving George. I was honest and told him how much this situation has been affecting me. My brother is the same age as my fianc√© so he is 11 years older than me. During our childhood he was my protector, the person I looked up to. Due to our age difference we never really had many activities in common and I could not wait for the moment I grow up so I can get to share more with my brother as adults. But I did not get the chance to do this because of Ella. David would always teach me to value myself, to choose people who treat me right and make me happy, however I am not able to share my happiness with him anymore. I understand why he would wish I never met George, but it still hurts knowing that your brother somehow resents the source of your happiness. 

David would always defend me when I was younger even in front of our parents. When I was 15 I was experimenting with makeup and it looked bad, really bad. During a family function one of our uncles got drunk and told me to stop using makeup because I was too young to look like a hooker. David got mad and kicked him out for offending his sister. This is the kind of brother he used to be and to now see how he stays aside and allows his wife to be offensive and cruel it's really hurtful. I do not care that she is like that towards me, I don't like Ella at all and I could easily ignore her. But what gets to me the most is she constantly trying to belittle and humiliate my future husband. I have lived with this man for 2 years, I have shared so many things with him during this time and I am certain I know better what kind of man he is. I know how hard it was for him to heal all his trauma, I know how hard he worked day by day to become the best version of himself, I know how much he loves me, protects me, supports me and I simply loose it when I hear her crap and how she is constantly trying to bring him down. Yes, I go bear mode when he is involved as someone told me in the comments but I don't care. I will not allow any of my family members to abuse the person I love. I may have tolerated things for my brother's sake but I will never be quiet in front of his b\*\*\*h of a wife.  

I told my brother that I love him and I will always cherish the memories I have with him but we cannot go on like this. I understand he is a victim and I am ready to do anything for him if he is willing to accept that his marriage is not good, that Ella is not a good woman and is abusing him. I cannot force him to divorce her because this has to be his choice but I told him I will accept his decision no matter what that is. He will always be my brother but George is my family now. We plan on having kids in the near future and there is no way in hell I will ever allow his lunatic of a wife to be near my kids. I also refuse to subject George to the abuse. We tried...we thought that this rough period will eventually pass and that everything will be ok but unfortunately Ella became more and more bitter and disgusting. We will still see my parents but I am standing my ground and will not go to their house if she is present. 

David and I cried a lot and for the first time in many years I felt like I had my brother back. He apologized over and over again and explained a lot of things to me which gave me the chance to understand him better. But at the same time I am so angry that I had no idea what was happening to my brother. Some people said that David was a rebound for Ella but it seems they were both a rebound for the other. What made them marry so fast was the age pressure. My brother was feeling like it was very hard to connect with someone and the prospect of being able to have a family of his own seemed very far away until Ella came and offered him the possibility to have exactly what he wanted without too much struggle.  So yeah...in the end I guess we are all some messed up people in a way or another. 

I don't know what's going to happen, David said he plans to take some time, go away alone for a couple of days and think what he wants to do. But he said that when he'll be back he wants to have a chat with George to apologize to him as well for everything that has happened. My brother knows that everything Ella says is false, he said everyone is able to see how much George loves me and that we make a great couple and there are times when he wished to also have something like this in his life. He told me he is proud of the woman I have become and that no matter what happens, I will always be his little sister. After this I went home and cried some more with George besides me. I have tried to play strong and denied myself to feel hurt for so long that yesterday I have finally exploded. But it was good because now I feel better.  ",25,1728894632.0,AITAH,4,0.91,False

 so I walked to the bus stop at like 5 am but the bus don't run here till 6:30 am. So I had a box of Debbie's in my backpack and nothing to drink. The pocket money I usually carry I spent the night before  drinking 
  I had no $ on my cash app I get direct posit so I nothing else saved and no credit card. (Gen Z)! Anyway I walk across the street from the bus to the McDonald's and I asked the cashier quite unabashedly, (being the only customer there and she the only worker I saw.) If she had anything for me to do around the place real quick cleaning wise, for a cup of coffee. 
 Cashier says ""I have to go ask my manager.'  She returns and says ""I'm sorry I cant do that. My boss says no, but I don't see why. If it was up to me...."" I say    ""that's ok, no problem"" I then sat at a booth to charge phone real quick and pulled out my Debbie's. 
 I maybe only just got the last little bite of my first one in my mouth before I could begin to chew then I saw a  large shit stick. Ugliest  Ive ever had misfortune to see to this day. 
 She ran for her life them 10 feet it took her to get me in sight and the time it took her to look around the corner I had plugged in my phone, grabbed a Debbie and almost ate it all before I saw her debut around that corner. She yells at me you can not be eating that I here get out. 
 I'm a very passive aggressive person and my morning was already clutch and frustrating that II jumped happy inside, to tear down her already fragile ""frame"" of character ik. Given her amount of surprise she should thank me for a reason her heart was beating at all, pushing around all that butter her blood had to be. I said so I said ""you saw back there on the camera ME with Debbie's?"" She stutters, I interrupt her and I say ""people usually thank their Trainer after a work out"" I accept cash no credit. Lol üòÇ I didn't stop I yelled as I was walking out ""your the last person on earth who should be surrounded by this type food and expect to live past 30.""

Like most people, I‚Äôve had my fair share of challenges. I wasn‚Äôt always overweight, but as life caught up with me‚Äîcollege, job, stress, sitting all day‚Äîthose extra pounds began sneaking up on me.

A few months back, I decided it was time to get serious about my health. I tried everything: calorie counting, hitting the gym, cutting out carbs (goodbye, pasta‚ÄîI miss you), but nothing really stuck. Then, one day, I stumbled upon something pretty random that ended up making a huge difference. It‚Äôs called Nagano Tonic. Let me break down my journey with it.

**How I Discovered It**

It all started when my friend, Jessica, who I hadn‚Äôt seen in months, showed up to our weekend brunch looking absolutely amazing. I‚Äôm talking glowing skin, slimmer waistline‚Äîthe whole deal. When I asked her what she was doing differently, she told me about this herbal supplement she‚Äôd been using called Nagano Tonic I was skeptical at first‚Äîthere‚Äôs a ton of weight-loss stuff out there, and most of it doesn‚Äôt work or leaves you jittery. But Jess was adamant it was different.She shared how the tonic isn‚Äôt just about shedding pounds; it‚Äôs about balancing your metabolism, reducing cravings, and boosting energy. And trust me, I needed all the help I could get in those departments! After some research and seeing how happy Jess was, I decided to give it a go.

**The Taste That Surprised Me**

I‚Äôm not a fan of most health drinks, so I was bracing myself for something chalky or bitter. But when my first bottle of Nagano arrived, I was genuinely surprised by the taste. It‚Äôs this refreshing mix of herbs and natural spices that almost felt like I was treating myself instead of punishing myself with another weight loss supplement. It became part of my morning routine‚Äîlike an energy boost that didn‚Äôt require chugging down bitter green smoothies or endless cups of coffee.

**The Ingredients That Make a Difference**

What really sold me on Nagano Tonic was the ingredients. This isn‚Äôt your run-of-the-mill supplement filled with chemicals you can‚Äôt pronounce. It has green tea extract for metabolism, Garcinia Cambogia for reducing cravings (goodbye, late-night snack attacks), and other natural ingredients like Mangosteen and Camu Camu that help with digestion and energy.

Oh, and Ashwagandha‚Äîthis herb is a game changer. I‚Äôd heard about it before because it‚Äôs used in Ayurvedic medicine to manage stress, and let me tell you, it works. Not only did I feel more relaxed, but it also helped with those stress-induced cravings that hit when I‚Äôm overworked. I wasn't reaching for chips or cookies as often, which was huge for me.

**How It Helped Me**

Here‚Äôs the thing‚ÄîNagano isn‚Äôt some magic potion. It doesn‚Äôt melt fat overnight, and it doesn‚Äôt make you drop pounds just by sipping it while binging Netflix (trust me, I tried that part). But what it does do is make weight loss feel manageable and, dare I say, enjoyable.

In the first couple of weeks, I noticed a huge reduction in my cravings. Normally, I‚Äôd snack constantly‚Äîespecially in the afternoons. But with this tonic, I felt fuller for longer, and when I did eat, I felt satisfied more quickly. It gave me that little extra push I needed to stick to healthier meals without feeling deprived.

And energy? Let‚Äôs just say my workouts started to improve, too. Before using Nagano, I‚Äôd drag myself to the gym, but afterward, I had this natural boost that made my morning runs more enjoyable (or at least less of a chore).

**The Long-Term Benefits**

What sets Nagano Tonic apart from all the other things I‚Äôve tried is its focus on sustainability. It‚Äôs not about losing weight super fast and then gaining it all back. It‚Äôs about helping you build healthier habits. For me, it was a huge mindset shift‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt just thinking about the scale but how I felt overall.

Over time, I lost around 15 pounds, and I feel like a new person. But more than the number on the scale, what mattered was how this tonic helped me feel better. I had more energy to tackle my workday, my digestion improved, and I wasn‚Äôt constantly craving junk food.

**Is It Worth It?**

For me, the answer is 100% yes. It wasn‚Äôt just the weight loss‚Äîit was the fact that I started feeling more in control of my health. Plus, the fact that it‚Äôs all-natural (no weird chemicals) made me feel good about what I was putting into my body. And the best part? If you‚Äôre not happy after giving it a try, they offer a 180-day money-back guarantee. So, there‚Äôs basically no risk.

**If you‚Äôre like me and have tried everything to lose weight but haven‚Äôt found anything that works long-term, give Nagano Tonic a shot. I‚Äôm really glad I did‚Äîit turned out to be the missing piece of my health puzzle. üå±‚ú®**
