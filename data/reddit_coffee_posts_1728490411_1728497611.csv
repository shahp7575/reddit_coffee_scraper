1fzy0ft,https://www.reddit.com/r/dumaguete/comments/1fzy0ft/dumaguete_trip_recommendation/,Dumaguete trip recommendation ,"Hi! Uuwi kami this Nov sa negros and we will stay in Dumaguete (my parents will stay sa relatives in Dauin). Last 2022, i think na overprice ata kami ng trike so i just wanted to plan our commute hehe. I cant drive motor so Jeep lang talaga kami ng kasama ko. 

Here are my list of questions:

1. From Sibulan Airport to Casa Celine Dumaguete ano pwede sakyan? I am familiar with Robinsons Dumaguete (been there once) and i think, isang way lang papunta don from Airport... but just wanted to make sure.  Can someone tell me ano ang pwedeng sakyan and if trike how much?

2. Recommendation na pwedeng puntahan? Museum, coffee shops, antique shops etc? We are not beach type girly pero if may malapit na magandang falls, okay lang din hehe. 

3. Gym near Casa Celine or Robinsons Dumaguete? (mas madali kasi puntahan for me huhu)

4. Any food recommendation? Restos? 

5. Any tips? 

I appreciate everyone who will answer or give me ideas. This will be my 2nd negros trip since last 2022 more on beach kami sa dauin. 

Thank you! ",1,1728497408.0,dumaguete,0,1.0,False

Background: 26M 

My stomach has never been a problem most of my life. Occasionally certain meals/drinks (coffee especially) would cause an upset stomach but nothing out of the ordinary.

A little over a month ago, on a random Wednesday I had green stool. Then again on Thursday. This freaked me out and caused a health anxiety spike. Realized it might’ve been caused by the purple gatorade I had the night before during a baseball game. Suddenly I had all sorts of GI issues. Bloating, heartburn, and regurgitating food. Eating made it worse so I avoided it. This cascaded into thinking I had stomach cancer because of getting bloated after small meals. Scheduled appointment with GI, walked her through my symptoms which at this point, started to go away. Based on my age & symptoms, nothing seemed to be a red flag so she ordered a celiac panel & calprotecin. All came back really good. Follow up in December.

Post- appointment, some of my symptoms continued and others disappeared. I suddenly developed more acid reflux-esque symptoms. Was getting cool-menthol feeling in mouth & throat. Never really had true stomach pain, blood in stool, or cramps. It was honestly a very subtle sensation. It was this odd uncomfortable sensation that was non-specific. Figured i’d schedule an appointment with PCP. Reiterated everything to them and they had no concerns either, and that it might just be IBS (which I never had). They said if it’d make me feel better, they’d give me script for bloodwork. Obviously, being a hypochondriac, I jumped at the opportunity.
Again, everything came back perfect. Doctor left note that everything was perfectly normal and to let them know if anything significant changes.

Since then, that same foreign feeling has lingered. I’m not having diarrhea, constipation, or pain. It’s the oddest feeling. It feels like something is off and I can’t pinpoint it. This is pretty much the only lingering symptom. I feel fine other than that. Sleep isn’t being disrupted, can still exercise. In fact, it almost ceases to exist when I am playing a sport or exercising. Part of me wants a colonoscopy just to put my mind at ease. I normally don’t have health anxiety that’s this bad, but for some reason I just can’t shake this one. I can’t help but google everything and get nervous about colorectal, intestinal, or stomach cancer. I am not completely irrational. I realize that my age & lifestyle greatly reduce my risk of these cancers. I barely drink, maybe once a month. I don’t smoke. I am a healthy weight. And exercise moderately. As far as I know, from talking to family, there is no significant cancer risk—especially relating to GI. With that, I don’t think the GI specialist is concerned enough to recommend colonoscopy. Especially since I asked about a FIT test, and she said she doesn’t believe it is necessary at this time.

I don’t know if it’s relevant but my stomach always feels warm but no fever or anything like that. Will notice my stomach gurgles/makes noises more than I remember. Last year, unrelated to this issue, I did have a stomach issue that I went to ER for. They did bloodwork, scans, pretty much all the fixings. Everything looked really good. They saw moderate stool in colon and chalked it up to gastritis. They suggested magnesium citrate and prescribed omeprazole. Took that for a week and felt better. Not sure if I am experiencing something similar but since I am not taking PPI, I wonder if that’s why it has lingered. No pencil thin stools, no blood in stool, no massive changes in bowel movements, no pain.

Hoping someone has experienced something similar and can tell me what they did to remedy this.

1fzxyva,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1fzxyva/i_think_im_in_the_bargaining_stage/,I think I’m in the bargaining stage,"Divorce initiator here. 

Reasons:
- he knew his life goals didn’t match up to mine, and knew these would be dealbreakers for me, and purposefully didn’t tell me since he knew I would leave
- feel like I have to drag him through any of the goals I wanted (marriage, house) and even then he wasn’t honest with me. He says he never would have gotten married if it wasn’t such a big thing for me (never told me). He says he wants to live in our current house forever (when we purchased we agreed it was a short term purchase leading to another house in the future). 
- fights on every little thing: I can’t paint the kitchen because he doesn’t like any of the colours, but he also doesn’t like the current colour, and if we do paint it has to be with certain circumstances (everything moved out, no kids, have to get it all done in two days). Every little thing was an argument. New lamp? Argument. New coffee table? Argument. He would change his mind constantly and when i inevitably got frustrated, he would said he just “didn’t know” what he wanted and would think about it. And would never. 
- no physical touch/intimacy for months. Even when we did, he wouldn’t listen to my needs or be willing to do foreplay at all. 
- no quality time together, all we do was sit and watch tv that he chooses. Never asked me what I wanted to watch 
- not considerate of my needs: if we didn’t have dinner planned for the night, he will usually eat a big lunch/snack right when he gets home and not plan for “us” to eat (I would always ask him any suggestions to which he would reply “no thanks, I’m good I’ve had snacks”. Which like..okay but what about me??? Why couldn’t we have made sure we both ate??)
- he doesn’t see a need for providing emotional support to me for serious traumas/anxiety disorder but I continually provided support for him
- he expects me to guide him through communication issues and teach him how to do these things when I’ve tried to help him or identified issues and it doesn’t change. I can’t teach if he’s not willing to learn, and also I’m not a therapist????
- only interested in doing his activities or interests, never mine and if we do finally do mine, he makes sure to let me know he isn’t interested in it 
- he never defended me with his family (they are extremely toxic and hostile towards me, always have been and have ruined his other siblings’ relationships for this same reason. He never stands up for me)
- takes no accountability for his actions, apologizes without actual change, no ability to remember the things we talked about, and when it comes down to it, either plays the victim or verbally attacks me/says it’s not a big deal 

Reasons not to:
- when we do basic things like cooking/groceries, it’s light and fun
- when I can finally get him to do something I want, he does usually have fun because I make sure he will
- pays mostly his fair share of the bills
- good with my family
- his mom is lovely
- he isn’t physically abusive/cheating/etc 
- he is loyal in the sense that he would not have divorced me


I am very new to the separation and the official “we’re done” talk but I’m feeling some fears and regrets. I am terrified to be alone, and this is what is making me think maybe I can at least get minimal effort over nothing, maybe I am too greedy. Going back would involve giving up big life goals (having children, moving, travel, house, etc). He won’t want to change and I don’t want to force him into this. He has turned around and said he is willing to revisit the kid goal, but I think it is just so I don’t leave him. I don’t want to be a single mom in a marriage. I’m just scared to be alone, not have that person to help feed the dog, and keep house, not have someone to split the bills with, not have someone to have easy light conversations with. I haven’t been alone for over a decade. 

Any advice or similar experiences would be extremely welcome. 

TLDR : regrets but just because I’m afraid of being alone. ",1,1728497296.0,Divorce,0,1.0,False

1fzxwtr,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1fzxwtr/setup_help_1000/,"Setup Help [$1,000]","Hey everyone, to preface I have seen the popular thread in here regarding this exact issue and have taken note of those setups:

I am looking to get going here soon. I do not want to open any machines and really mod anything. I have done probably 15 hours worth of research at this point and just can’t make the decision. Most of what I’ll use it for are shots, capps, and lattes. Here’s where I’m at as of now:

1. Bambino with a great grinder like the DF64, a bottomless porta filter, calibrated tamper, knock box, 0.1g scale. My concern here is I don’t love how light and cheaply built the machine is, and question its longevity. I don’t doubt its ability to make great espresso though.

2. Lelit Anna with a JX-Pro hand grinder to save a little bit of money. I really like what i’ve heard about this machine, but it takes up all my budget essentially with that and the grinder. Not worried about the 57mm portafilter. I love the build quality of this machine and it seems to be sturdy and like it will last forever if taken care of 

3. Breville Barsista Pro. This is more of an all in one obviously with the built in grinder. Would give me a little bit of room for some accessories that might could make it pretty solid.  

Between these 3 options, what are some thoughts? I’m open to other options but feel pretty good about these 3. I am a complete beginner but I do know and care about really good quality coffee and am not worried about the “work” involved to get a really nice shot

1. **Electronics**
   * **Televisions**: Expect significant discounts on popular TV brands like Samsung, LG, and Vizio. For example, in 2023, Meijer offered an LG 75-inch 4K Smart TV for $649.99, down from $999.99. Similar price drops on large smart TVs are likely in 2024.
   * **Gaming Consoles**: Look for deals on [PS5](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackFridayRumors/comments/1fsqhwy/ps5_black_friday_2024_sales_deals_what_to_expect/), [Xbox Series X](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackFridayRumors/comments/1fsq1z2/xbox_black_friday_2024_sales_deals_what_to_expect/), and [Nintendo Switch](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackFridayRumors/comments/1fspbtv/nintendo_switch_black_friday_2024_sales_deals/) consoles. Bundles that include additional controllers and games are common.
2. **Home Goods & Small Appliances**
   * **Vacuum Cleaners**: Meijer is known for offering deep discounts on vacuums during Black Friday. Last year, they had a Shark Navigator Lift-Away Vacuum for $149, marked down from $249. Expect to see similar discounts this year, including deals on brands like [Dyson](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackFridayRumors/comments/1frbwgm/dyson_vacuum_black_friday_deals_2024_the_sales_we/) and Bissell.
   * **Kitchen Appliances**: Deals on small kitchen appliances like [air fryers](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackFridayRumors/comments/1fqt0t9/air_fryer_black_friday_2024_deals_sales_what_to/), coffee makers, and blenders are a staple of Meijer’s Black Friday sale.

4. **Apparel & Footwear**
   * **Clothing and Shoes**: Meijer offers discounts on men’s, women’s, and children’s apparel during Black Friday. In 2023, they ran promotions like 40-50% off winter coats and boots. This year, you can likely expect markdowns on outerwear, activewear, and footwear, ideal for gearing up for the colder months.

# Key Things to Remember:

* **Availability**: Not all Meijer locations carry the same products. Grocery-only stores will not have the general merchandise like electronics, toys, and apparel that are featured in the Black Friday ad. Be sure to check what your local store offers before heading out.
* **First-Come, First-Served**: Black Friday deals at Meijer are typically available on a first-come, first-served basis. There are no rainchecks for items that sell out, so if you’re targeting a high-demand product, make sure to shop early.
* **Online vs. In-Store**: While many deals are available both online and in-store, certain doorbusters may only be available in physical locations. Keep an eye on the ad for specific details.

I approached the kids and i could smell the reek coming from miles away. Now i myself dont shower and hardly ever wipe as its my way of rebelling against the system. So i asked the poser teens “so you guys listen to emo music?? Whats your favorite band” they looked at me and said “Michael Romance of course” or some stupid band like that. I chuckled and said “ahhh young little minds. Real Emo only consists of the DC emotional hardcore scene of the 80s” then i proceeded to enlighten them with facts and knowledge about Real Emo.

Now it is time to return, but my partner has seen none of it. We want to go to Kruger, which I have not seen, and Cape Town. I know that Africa is cheap when it comes to food/lodging (compared to the EU/US), but activities are expensive. We can do the perfect tour in 2 weeks, but if we were to expand it further since we have the time, looking for experiences that do not cost much.

Car rental prices are decent in South Africa, but expensive in Namibia (great country). I have taken public transportation in East Africa, which was terrible, but never considered it in Southern Africa since the distances are great. Flight prices within Africa tend to be expensive. Not sure if there is a self-drive where we can keep prices down or cities with some downtime (beaches!).",1,1728496828.0,travel,0,1.0,False

Trying to hunt down a Lenovo Yoga Book 9i for university work - I've entered my Masters Program and my Surface Laptop Studio is just too darn heavy to carry around and the battery life is middling.

1) Could anyone with the i7-1355u version tell me how their battery life experiences have been? Hoping to be able to ditch the charge I normally carry during the 5-7 hours I'm out of the house on campus + at a coffee shop studying.

2) I would also be using it for note taking and some light drawing (something i've been wanting to do for a while), and would love to hear people's experience on if there is noticeable palm heat or if the line jitter/palm rejection is especially bad. Coming from the Studio, I'm sure it's going to be a little different but just wanted to hear other people's experiences, artists if possible. I know Brad Colbow said he wouldn't recommend it for art but it wouldn't be my main purpose!

  
3) How is the heat and power? would probably be occasionally lapping it and running some light games (emulation, league of legends, older titles) for traveling, just curious. Does anyone experience lag having a lot of tabs open in edge or streaming music/video + tabs?

  
Appreciate any and all responses! If I find an Ultra 7 variant for a good price, i'll probably try and get that instead, but it's looking like the 13th gen i7 will be what I probably end up with.

  
I also looked at the Zenbook Duo already, but it just looks too heavy to tote around all day, and I've heard very mixed (and borderline bad) experiences with it and the battery life, so it sounds like it wouldn't be for me, especially since I have a desktop for power-hungry things at home.",1,1728496740.0,YogaBook9i,0,1.0,False

I’d appreciate some advice. I’m at my wits end.

I have been nagging my mother to drink more. The last few weeks have been particularly difficult, ever since Hurricane Helene hit us here in southwestern Virginia. Being without power for almost a week was horrible for her mind, despite my best to keep her engaged at times. 

She was already struggling to drink enough liquids through the day, but it has gotten worse. If left to her own devices, she would drink a cup of coffee for breakfast and sip on a 16oz. Coke Zero for the remainder of the day. She swears up and down that she drinks more, but I know better as I can tell!

Plain water is out of the question. She “can’t go it.” I’ve tried bargaining with her over it. Best I can do is the flavored waters from Wal-Mart (I think it’s the Clear American brand). Regardless, she’ll hardly drink much. Her favorite is the frozen Coke/Coke icees from McDonald’s, but even then it will take her a while to get through one. 

I know it would at least help her mental state just to be more hydrated! The best I’ve seen her behave in the last two years is when she’s received a liquid IV at the hospital (COVID in 2022 and a UTI in August). It’s like night and day as far as behavior and mental recall is concerned. 

Even beyond that, her diet is lacking. I try my best to prepare well rounded meals for her, but she eats like a pigeon. 

Sidenote venting: donepezil, and memantine (almost two years on the memantine now) seem to have had zero effects on her whatsoever. The donepezil seems to only make her sleep for longer than usual.",1,1728496734.0,dementia,0,1.0,False

Context: I am 47 years old, medium active, slightly overweight.

WHY:
I was so tired of quitting sugar only to start again. I was tired of feeling so full and bloated, but knowing why I felt that way. I had done keto last year and lost 15lbs, I felt great but returned to my regular eating habit and gained it back. I wasn't feeling good physically or mentally. While visiting Indigo with no intention of a life change, I saw the New Whole30 book on sale at and a lightbulb went off. I bought the book, came home and shared with my husband all that we were going to do. We set a start date, September 9th.

THE JOURNEY: To be honest, the change in eating came pretty easy to us. Don't get me wrong. There were times when I did crave hard but I just pushed through, stuck with the plan and I remembered that nothing changes if nothing changes. 
My meals were pretty much this; 
Coffee: this was a big one, oh how I love cream in my coffee! I think thats the only reason I got out of bed most days. I wasn't able to find any of the suggested replacements near me, so I used a canned coconut milk and that worked. In fact, I don't plan on returning to dairy in my coffee. 
Breakfast: 2 boiled eggs, watermelon, avocado, Chia seeds, apple (the fruit combo changed daily)
Lunch: homemade chicken soup with veggies and a few potatoes
Snack: mixed nuts (no peanuts) and a fruit
Dinner: grilled meat, veggies and salad (I did try a few recipes from the book, like the shepherds pie, so good!)
We really tried not to eat evening snacks but when we did it was nuts or fruit. 

THE RESULT: my introduction plan is very small as I only plan to add back Quinoa. I feel great and want to maintain this feeling. 
I lost 5.6lbs.

Just wanted to make a vent post and see if anyone else can relate to this situation. I am level 1 ASD, and barely that. I'm extremely intelligent and studious, but I often feel socially rejected. I have no issue talking with others, but I always have this feeling in the back of my mind that I'm being treated differently. I excel in school and am very engaging within the classroom, but when I ask my classmates if they want to hang out; that's when it gets awkward.

I see groups of students hanging out and laughing; you know, having a good time. Then I am usually alone at my table listening to what the other students are saying. Yesterday I overheard a conversation 2 girls were having about clothes and hair. I really wanted to join in, but I didn't know their names. To be honest, hair and clothes really don't interest me that much, but I wanted some friendly human interaction.

Most of the conversations I hear are suite surface level, and that's okay. I prefer to have more in-depth discussions, but I know it takes time to build rapport with someone to be able to hove those types of conversation. I am quite patient and try to engage within the surface level pleasantries, but I never get invited out. As a result, I end up inviting other people to get coffee, go on a walk, see a movie, or go to the mall: but I always get turned down.

I honestly don't feel much different from neurotypical people, and I'm barely on the spectrum. I've attempted to join some ASD groups, but I don't see to connect with many ASD people. This may sound pretentious, but I don't feel that I am on the spectrum enough to fit in with ASD groups. To be frank, I don't like ASD people very much and find the majority of them to be quite annoying. So here I am in a weird in-between space where I don't fit in with ASD, but don't quite fit in with neurotypical. I feel like I'm in a weird purgatory. ",1,1728496552.0,autism,2,1.0,False

1fzxnhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/bupropion/comments/1fzxnhk/1yr_experience_on_300mg/,1yr+ experience on 300mg,"I last posted here over a year ago and wanted to provide a much-overdue update on my experience on 300mg/day of Bupropion XL.

To summarize my dosage, I started on 150mg/day and after a few months of little improvement, my doctor nudged me up to 300mg. If it matters, I’m a female in my early 30s, 135 lbs. No other meds save for a Nexplanon implant and a daily vitamin. My main symptom was low motivation, which kept me locked in bed for days at a time, sometimes without eating. Occasionally I would have huge breakdowns of crying, but mostly I just felt really uninvested in my own life and didn’t look forward to the future at all.

I’ve been on 300mg now for over a year and am wondering if I might wind up being a lifer on this med. I have so much more energy than I’ve ever had. I got a new job that I love a lot, and I’m really invested in my work and my team. After some appetite issues early on while taking Bupropion, my hunger returned (helped along by a 2-3x a week gym routine). I would say my hunger and appetite is 100% normal now, and I eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day and rarely feel nauseated (a problem when I first started the med).

I go out with my friends at least once a week. I find things to enjoy about every day. My relationship is thriving. Not everything is perfect; sometimes (especially on my period) I notice I’m a lot more irritable than normal. But it’s something I am aware of and can process instead of just stewing.

I don’t really drink so can’t speak to how my alcohol intake is affected. Two drinks is typically my max, maybe once a month. But I haven’t noticed any major changes in terms of tolerance or anything.

I would say my anxiety levels are still higher than the average person’s. I have a major fear of flying, and a trip to and from Hawaii last Christmas was terrifying, even with the help of Ativan. This is the case even when I’m not on Bupropion but I suppose it’s possible my base anxiety level is 10% higher than normal.

The only major-ish downside of this med to me is how it affects my sleep. I take my pill right before I leave for work, with (decaf) coffee and breakfast, and I’m able to mostly maintain my energy throughout the workday. Once I get home I get hit with I’d say a normal amount of fatigue, but around 7pm or so I feel absolutely WIPED and it’s hard to resist taking a nap. If I take a nap even for 30-45 minutes, which is most days, I find it damn near impossible to get to sleep that night. I tend to lie in bed for up to 90 minutes waiting to fall asleep. I get in bed around 10:30 and read for a bit, then go lights out at 11, and I still routinely won’t get to sleep until 12 or even later.

I also feel like I get more nightmares/vivid dreams. These tend to wake me up. For example, last night I finally drifted off around 12 or 12:15, then woke up from a nightmare at 1:45 and had to wait another 10 or 15 minutes to fall back asleep again. This makes it harder to get to sleep because every night I worry, “what if I have another messed-up dream?”

I’ve been trying to wake up at 6 but it’s hard not to hit snooze over and over until I HAVE to get up in order to rush to get ready and leave for work by 8:15. I’ve never been a morning person anyway, but before Bupropion I had a much easier time getting to sleep. (This is partly just depression, though; I slept allllll the time because I was just so checked out of life.) I’m still working on this and to be honest, other than the 7pm tiredness, my energy levels are pretty high all day long. So the sleep issues aren’t majorly hurting me, but I am really just committed to becoming a morning person so I can do some yoga and take my time getting ready.

Anyway, that’s my update. tl;dr, overall I’m really happy on this med and on this dosage, and the only drawback is some insomnia possibly brought on by early evening napping.

My dad had undiagnosed adhd so was no almost help and my mom... doesn't give practical advice? It's hard to explain. So, I hope these words help someone;

1. Arriving late is so much better than not arriving at all.

2. Arriving a little late is not the same as arriving very late. It may feel the same to your anxiety, but it isn't experienced the same by the people waiting.

3. If you pull up late with a coffee or food in hand a lot of people will read that as meaning you *really* don't value their time, they can't know if you got it before you were late. So, hide it at first. They don't need to see it anyway.

4. What you have to say and what you can learn are valuable and important and places are less when you're not there. So yes, it does matter if you're late or skip, not because of other people but because you bring good things to the table!

5. It's okay to ask people to repeat themselves or explain more. 

6. It's okay to ask for help.

7. Random schedules are the worst for your adhd (college classes are espebad about this). Try to set it up so your schedule is as consistent as possible.

8. Just because you're adhd doesn't mean you're obligated to multitask.

9. Put. Down. The planner. You already have four. This one won't magically make things better.

10. Prioritize sleep and sleep hygiene. I know it's hard, but your executive function is already challenged so that makes sleep all the more important!

11. You're not obligated to listen to everyone who gives you advice

12. Just because you overshared with someone before doesn't mean ""the damage is done."" You don't need to avoid them if you liked them or keep oversharing even if you don't like their vibes.

13. You have good intuition

14. You dont have to make yourself small

But it’s okay I have matcha and terrifier 3 to look forward to. ,In all honesty I’m not too upset. This has never happened before and I know it’s probably because everyone is just stressed with a lot going on. Especially the hurricanes that are semi close to my state.

The creator was a musician and for one of his album covers he created a bunch of anthropomorphic toys that he would create stop motion videos with, to promote his album. In the video the characters would all die in someway, I remember a couple deaths, one girl died from being burned by coffee, another got killed in a police shoot out with their dad, another died in a car crash, one got hit by a train, three died on a distorted island, and a two headed boy got sacrificed. They were also connected by a fox that was at all of their deaths. And it ended with all the characters at a school? For the dead.",1,1728496138.0,HelpMeFind,2,1.0,False

I struggled in the beginning playing with calories, stopping snacks after 7pm, cutting out junk food. When I found Nut Pods for my morning coffees, I found Keto much easier, and said OK I can do this! And then after I was about 2 weeks into full Ketosis, the carb cravings stopped. The less carbs I ate, the less I craved, it blew me away and I was so happy.  I do need more fiber and I'm having difficulty finding something high fiber with low or 0 carbs. I'm at 177 now and I feel so much better, physically,  mentally. I have about 30lbs more to shed.  I thought Chia seeds would be good, but nope. Maybe Asparagus? Does anyone have some suggestions on boosting fiber? ",4,1728496126.0,keto,1,1.0,False

We will live in our own little world, going on adventures, cooking in our tiny apartment & playing badminton on the streets.

Let’s dress up in suits and go to the local tea shop, talk French in the airport and eat ice cream in the rain.

Let’s fight, make up and fight again for silly reasons which would make a therapist scratch their head in confusion.

Let’s build a business empire together where you will take over the philanthropy activities which are basically cocktail parties for your friends.

Let’s both grow old and wrinkled and then get multiple plastic surgeries so it’s like we are dating an entirely new person.

Or we can go for a coffee. That works too lmaoo",1,1728496110.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.99,False

1fzxfgm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fzxfgm,I’m so bummed about new mug ,"I just got back from Greece. I love to buy pottery in new places so I picked up this mug. I’m not a potter but I’ve started buying handmade mugs in the past year so I learned that this is crazing. I didn’t really pay attention to it when I bought it, however. 

Anyway, I used it for my coffee this morning and I noticed a ring under it when I put it down on my table. So I then put water in it and placed on a newspaper. It appears to be a leaky mug so I guess I won’t be able to use it for drinking out of 😞 I’m bummed. I don’t know if I should let the company know about the issue either. It had a card in it with the company details. 

I guess there’s nothing I can do to salvage it for drinking purposes? What else can I use this for now? I don’t really do plants 🫣",1,1728495966.0,Ceramics,1,0.67,False

So I don't understand why every time I had tried a drug Its always a bad experience. The first time I got drunk I started crying a lot. I didnt became more friendly or social like most people. I didn't forget my problems or anything. I'm fact it made them worse

And my first time getting high on weed was one of the worst experiences of my life. I used edibles with a not so good friend and I had the most massive anxiety attack while my friend was laughing at me. I was high for almost 20 hours and really the only thing that relaxed me was when I listened to some music. But I couldn't get relaxed at all like my friend. Although it may be his fault because he made eat to much edibles. I would try again but I'm afraid it would me the same experience 

So yeah. What I think is that I may be too bad of my head that not even drugs make me feel good, but the other way around. That's why I don't really want anxiety medication because I always have a bad reaction to everything. I even get anxious when drinking coffee.

I guess the good thing is that I'll never get addicted to anything lol.

Going to give this another shot, since this community has been great and super supportive! 

My name is Ariel, I'm 38, F, and living in Boston. I'm looking for new friends and possibly something more if the chemistry is there. 

I identify as demisexual. I'm mostly sex-indifferent, but open up to people I share interests with and can have deep, meaningful conversations with. Dating apps haven't really given me the depth of connection I really look for, and a lot of people I've met on there move too fast for my taste. I love cuddles and the idea of being close with one special person. 

My hobbies include taking long walks, exploring Boston, Irish dance, yoga, running, cooking, sailing, learning foreign languages, and drinking as many lattes as I can get away with! I want to find more day hikes and social events too. 

I speak English and German, conversational Spanish, and a little bit of Norwegian, Estonian, Finnish, and Russian. Big plus if you speak more than one language (or are interested in learning one)! I have kind of a soft spot for Russian speakers. 🙂

Tie-dye and coffee are two of my favorite things!

Friends describe me as enthusiastic, energetic, and a mix of light and darkness with a mild cynical streak. My humor is a bit on the dark side. 

ESTJ personality type, if that matters!

A few things about me that may or may not be dealbreakers for some people: 

-I am a (civilian) sailor by trade, so that means I work long hours and am gone on trips for sometimes weeks at a time without phone service. I mostly love my job, but I realize this lifestyle can be really hard on relationships. Luckily my ship has good internet, though! 

-I am childfree. Children can be great, but I don't want to have any of my own (or help raise anyone else's kids). If you have pets, that's a huge plus though! 

-I don't smoke or drink. I don't care if you drink, though. Unfortunately I can't be 420-friendly due to drug testing at my job. 😕

-I dislike traditional gender roles. While someone chivalrous would be lovely, I work in a very male-dominated industry, so my ideal partner would be able to respect that. I'd prefer to build my own IKEA furniture, but I do appreciate it when someone holds the door for me. 🙂

-I'm the opposite of a homebody. 9 times out of 10 I'd much prefer a night ""out"" over a night ""in.""

- If I get into a serious relationship, I'm not really interested in cohabiting. Because I live in close quarters with my coworkers at work, I really value my personal space when I'm home. Ideal would be living in a duplex with a partner or in a nearby house.

- I like Boston, but my dream is to eventually live in Northern Europe someday. 

I'm looking for someone preferably aged 32-40 who has a sense of adventure, is ambitious but not competitive, is curious about the world, is energetic, and is ambiverted or extroverted (or can happily keep up with my social energy). If you think we vibe or could be friends, feel free to send me a DM. 

I look forward to hearing from you and best of luck with your search! 🙂",1,1728495770.0,asexualdating,0,1.0,False

I am attempting to surprise my husband with a higher end espresso machine for Christmas after watching him struggle with the $80 one we purchased from Walmart last year (was all we could afford at the time). He works so hard and deserves something nice that he will not purchase for himself. I will be the first to say I know nothing about espresso machines or coffee outside of that I enjoy drinking it. I've been researching as much as I can, but I ultimately feel I finally settled on something to suit his needs just to read posts about how it isn't as good as it seems. I've also been reading about not bothering with E61 machines and being sure to have a double boiler. I'll be frank in saying I have no idea what that really means haha. That all being said, I was leaning towards purchasing the Rocket Appartmento TCA. However, I've seen others say not to bother due to the lack of double boiler and because while being able to temperature control it, it only has 4 settings that two of which aren't suitable for a typically made espresso. He is not a beginner per say in his knowledge and ability, he would be intermediate at best, but he is willing to and has put in the work to properly learn how to utilize machines and get the best pull for what machine he does have. He really doesn't bother with the frother much, which is where I wonder if the double boiler wouldn't matter to him. He mainly pulls double shots to make shaken espressos of various types. I don't know if that means the Rocket TCA would be a good choice for him or not. I'm also looking for a good recommendation on a grinder if anyone can throw that in too. I really appreciate any help here! I really want to do this for him and do it correctly so that he will be happy with his machine for years to come.

TLDR; trying to find the best option for my husband for Christmas and have no idea what I'm meant to be looking for to get him the best value in a higher end machine etc.",6,1728495497.0,espresso,17,1.0,False
1fzx83x,https://www.reddit.com/r/GarminWatches/comments/1fzx83x/switched_up_from_aw_ultra_trying_my_best_not_to/,Switched up from AW Ultra - Trying my best not to move back!,"As the title, I've been an Apple Watch user for years, since they came out. I dabbled in the Epix a few years ago but struggled with the clunky interface and switched back. I've bit the bullet and got the Fenix 8 47mm AMOLED and the design and screen is amazing. She looks a beauty. Unfortunately for me that's where it stops - I'm going to put it down to lack of time on the wrist and time to get used to the watch, hopefully there are some bright minds that can help get rid of some of these pain points I've been having!

* The wrist HRM - Very difficult to show accurate readings. I mean I can go for a run and for the first 10 minutes it shows ridiculously low heart rate (<130bpm), I definitely don't feel it's right. Then all of a sudden no changes to anything - 180+. See proof below. HRM red line at the top. This has happened on all 3 runs I've done with the watch. I've never had this issue on AW. 

[HRM Low and then starts to read properly.](https://preview.redd.it/sngqryi4mrtd1.png?width=1724&format=png&auto=webp&s=edced37e20783af8952b6662090291165f17443b)

* **The Map** - I tried to navigate to a ParkRun while away in my caravan. I set it in the Apple Maps app, sent it to the watch via the share function and it showed up straight away - when I started the navigation the directions were just an ""as the pigeon flies"" straight line. I subsequently got lost.
   * I've tried updating the standard maps, it doesnt seem any better. Maybe that's just something I need to deal with? I've never actually done this on the AW so I don't really think it's too much of a problem for me.
* **Garmin Pay** - Let's call it Garmin No-Pay. What is that Bank support all about? I use it regularly, out for runs or cycles with the lads I don't take my cards/wallet and in some cases my phone. How can I pay for that mid-run coffee? Barclays/Amex/Barclaycard Support required!
* **Garmin Coach** - I'm sure I'm doing this wrong, I've been using Runna on the AW and it's been mega, loads of functionality and I get notifications in the ear when running too fast etc. My Garmin Coach just wants me to run at 10min/mi for the first week or two as ""base"" - is that normal? I run 20min 5ks, not fast but not slow either.
* **Apple Music** - I know it's not Apple but WTF. I love listening to tunes WITHOUT my phone. To be honest I would switch to Spotify but I get Apple Music free through my phone contract.
* **Audible/Blinkest** or other audiobook support - lacking. Don't see a workaround that doesnt involve a 5 step process to download a PDF.
* **Third party App support** - As above I used Runna, again I might be using it wrong but it takes me ages to find the workout, I don't get audible notifications like on the AW. 
* **Notification Centre** - It's a bit naff, I get a notification and I just want to swipe it away, but I have to swipe and select clear. 

I appreciate I've focused on the bad here and I totally expect I might need to be schooled on the use of the watch. The battery life is absolutely superb and I'm not ruling out the watch just yet. It's locked up/restarted on me a couple of times but I can live with that. I also love the readiness scores in the mornings and what it tells me to do today. That's something the AW has never delivered and it really is a winner on that part. If I can find alternative ways to make it almost on-par with the AW then it'll be a winner but I have to admit I'm a tad underwhelmed for the price. School me guys, I just know I am doing something wrong but I've watched loads of YouTube vids to try and self serve.

As niggles arrive I'll add more to this. 

TL;DR - I've moved from AW after 7+ years, underwhelmed but likely underschooled.",2,1728495450.0,GarminWatches,2,0.75,False

Just wanted to rant because of how hopeless I feel. But does anyone know of anywhere hiring in Liverpool or nearby? I'd like jobs in hospitality or jobs as that's all I've done outside of uni, or any jobs that don't require relevant experience?

1fzx5ht,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1fzx5ht/eurostar_for_londonparis_a_guide/,Eurostar for London/Paris: a guide,"I'm a huge fan of Eurostar for commuting between London/Paris. Only exception would be if you’re flying outwards from an airport. As I have to do this trip about 3-5 times a year, think I’ve gathered some notes which I’d love to pass on. 

In both London and Paris, the train stations are both relatively in the city centre, compared to the airports which can be about an hour+ away. Rather than taking the higher public transport/taxi cost to get to/from the airport, you'll already be in the city centre.

It's best to arrive about **90 - 60** mins before your train leaves. You must check in 30 mins before your train leaves, meaning you must go through the first barrier where you scan your ticket before the 30 mins mark or the barrier won’t let you through. If you are unfortunate enough to go through around the 30min mark, do let Eurostar staff know and they’ll try and push you to the front of the security line but DO NOT rely on this. 

**Suitcase/luggage:**  
You don't have any liquid or any major luggage restrictions - so in theory you could bring a whole suitcase of wine with you in your hand luggage (which I have done before). Security itself is relatively simple, you go through the gates which scan your passport and scan your luggage. HOWEVER, make sure you’re able to lift your luggage as not all the luggage belts are sloped, some you’ll have to lift onto the belt. 

**Food:**  
However, there's not many food options inside the Eurostar hall, only sandwiches or coffee options on both sides so you may went to grab something before you go through Eurostar. Just as a FYI, [Carton bakery](https://www.cartonparis.com/) is about a 5 minute walk from Gare Du Nord and it's a very solid bakery choice. On the London side, at the main station of Kings Cross there's a handful of sit down restaurants and cafes, and even Pancras Square (Coals Drop yard about 5-10ish mins away) has Kimchee, Dishroom and some other great food options. Greggs is my quick go to in King’s Cross for a sausage roll or marks and Spencer’s for a sandwich. 

**Pricing:**  
Eurostar can be 88e return if you book in advance, and a bit cheaper if you manage to get a ticket during the flash sale. Sign up for Eurostar email notifications for the flash sales and be flexible with your dates. Leaving on a Monday generally tends to be more expensive (and security is usually a nightmare on Monday mornings too). Generally the earlier you book, the cheaper it'll be. You can also use Eurostar’s cheap fair finder: https://www.eurostar.com/uk-en/find-lowest-fares

**tax** 
UK and other international citizens will get their tax back, once you’re pass security and in the hall, opposite the first duty free, there’s some self serving tax free machines. 
Unfortunately the UK no longer does tax free purchases. 

**Miscellaneous** 
 I usually try to book my seat as close to the front as possible, as at Gare du Nord, the exit is at the front and at King’s Cross, it’s about one carriage and a bit from the front. 

Eurostar trains are generally on time, I’ve only had issues when there’s been strikes or someone had fallen under the train at Gare Du Nord. 

The seats on the train have their own power sockets (one EU and one UK) if needed. There’s no USB ports in standard class. 

You can print off your tickets or use your phone. Both options work. 

If there’s anything else I’ve missed, I’ll see if I can answer :)

1fzx4is,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1fzx4is/assistant_professor_x_student_in_uni_situationship/,Assistant Professor x Student in Uni (Situationship),"I joined uni late, some years after my school in August 2023. Made some friends, had fun. I saw this assistant professor and advisor, we always had deep eye contacts in hallways, and he started to proctor all of my exams, got my number out of system, and added me on snapchat. He messaged me in December and immediately started to ask me out, to be his girl. I said I don't date and stuff. He used to say things like I would take care of you blah blah, I will marry you. (I am very introverted, shy, and scared of men, beginning of uni I couldn’t even talk to men, I studied in all girls school). He used to ask me to meet him everyday and I’d refuse, I finally went out with him and it was nice. We used to talk dirty all the time (I am a whore on chat, saint irl), so there was sexual tension among us 24/7. We met multiple times, hung out in his car, drank coffees together. Hugged a man for the first time, then had my first kiss a little later on in April. Did some more firsts, but not the actual stuff.
April, I went back home, he fought with me over how I don’t text him immediately, said he doesn’t feel good, he stopped talking to me. Until then I had grown attached to him, he was a family in a strange city. That felt like a hammer to my heart but I accepted it, I had already brought some gifts for him from my country, and I left it on his table and left. He broke “no contact” couple of weeks later, saying “we were always more than just friends” “I have always liked you more than you ever liked me” and we started talking again, later we fought again, because I gave him a flower in hallway where people could see us and that triggered him, he fought with me and stopped talking for 20-25days. He came back again, and I took him back again because he said “I missed you”.

We hung out again multiple times, made out, went to a restaurant where he told me that he’d marry someone else one day and we’re just friends?!?!??!?? I paid no attention to it, and went on my way.
That was June.

I had a breakdown talking to him, where I expressed that I really like him, like I would be his girl if he asks me. He said, he did it multiple times in the first month, now he lost interest in that. (He only asked me in the first month, he also had his ex as his lock screen picture, he is also very hyper sexual, liking and sending erotic reels of women and liking posts like that, telling me that we should do threesome and also wants to really really fuck me)
Now September, he is making it clear that whatever he has for me is pure friendship. I blocked him, after telling him how much I liked him.
I recently unblocked him, he can message if he wants, not if he doesn’t want.",1,1728495198.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

1fzx0o4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fzx0o4,What am I experiencing?,"Background: 26M 

My stomach has never been a problem most of my life. Occasionally certain meals/drinks (coffee especially) would cause an upset stomach but nothing out of the ordinary.

A little over a month ago, on a random Wednesday I had green stool. Then again on Thursday. This freaked me out and caused a health anxiety spike. Realized it might’ve been caused by the purple gatorade I had the night before during a baseball game. Suddenly I had all sorts of GI issues. Bloating, heartburn, and regurgitating food. Eating made it worse so I avoided it. This cascaded into thinking I had stomach cancer because of getting bloated after small meals. Scheduled appointment with GI, walked her through my symptoms which at this point, started to go away. Based on my age & symptoms, nothing seemed to be a red flag so she ordered a celiac panel & calprotecin. All came back really good. Follow up in December.

Post- appointment, some of my symptoms continued and others disappeared. I suddenly developed more acid reflux-esque symptoms. Was getting cool-menthol feeling in mouth & throat. Never really had true stomach pain, blood in stool, or cramps. It was honestly a very subtle sensation. It was this odd uncomfortable sensation that was non-specific. Figured i’d schedule an appointment with PCP. Reiterated everything to them and they had no concerns either, and that it might just be IBS (which I never had). They said if it’d make me feel better, they’d give me script for bloodwork. Obviously, being a hypochondriac, I jumped at the opportunity.
Again, everything came back perfect. Doctor left note that everything was perfectly normal and to let them know if anything significant changes.

Since then, that same foreign feeling has lingered. I’m not having diarrhea, constipation, or pain. It’s the oddest feeling. It feels like something is off and I can’t pinpoint it. This is pretty much the only lingering symptom. I feel fine other than that. Sleep isn’t being disrupted, can still exercise. In fact, it almost ceases to exist when I am playing a sport or exercising. Part of me wants a colonoscopy just to put my mind at ease. I normally don’t have health anxiety that’s this bad, but for some reason I just can’t shake this one. I can’t help but google everything and get nervous about colorectal, intestinal, or stomach cancer. I am not completely irrational. I realize that my age & lifestyle greatly reduce my risk of these cancers. I barely drink, maybe once a month. I don’t smoke. I am a healthy weight. And exercise moderately. As far as I know, from talking to family, there is no significant cancer risk—especially relating to GI. With that, I don’t think the GI specialist is concerned enough to recommend colonoscopy. Especially since I asked about a FIT test, and she said she doesn’t believe it is necessary at this time.

I posted this picture to see if anything looks abnormal, or if anyone has had a similar experience. I don’t know if it’s relevant but my stomach always feels warm but no fever or anything like that. Will notice my stomach gurgles/makes noises more than I remember. Hoping someone has experienced something similar and can tell me what they did to remedy the problem.

Idk if I have abilities or not or something but here are my reasons 

1. I talked to my mom's dead brother in 2nd grade, he stated his name and everything in school, I could see him, hear him and talk to him 

(this only happened once and I was extremely shy and never wanted to talk to anyone and for some reason walked up to him and stated my name, ever since then I was never shy again)

2. I've seen ghost throughout my entire life up until 6th grade, everything seems to have stopped, idk if I'm losing what I had or if I was too imaginative but other paranormal stuff has happened since then

3. We took a test for instruction following in 2nd grade, it's not one of those things teachers are forced to give out or even recommend by the school, in 6th grade I had a nagging feeling we were going to take it again so much so to the point of annoyance but by the next week that paper was on my desk 

4. Now in high school someone showed me a picture of a drink, he said it was tea, I didn't care cuz I was just trying to do my work, but all of a sudden I smell a mass amount of coffee, then I told him wow I smell loads of coffee, he says he doesn't smell coffee, then he scrolls down to read on the drink where he discovers that it's not tea, it's actually coffee! 

This means I've talked to ghost, heard ghost, seen ghost throughout life, predicted the future and I've also seen some crazy stuff like shadow people but I just woke up so I thought it was my brother so I yelled at the thing to go to bed, only to realize when I woke up that it wasn't even human, it was a shadowy figer with big white eyes, I went super close to it when I thought it was my little bro hiding under his bed, but clearly since I just woke up I didn't notice the two bright big circle eyes 

(WHAT THE HECK DOES THIS MEAN)
 (it never happened again)

I try to make sense of this, is it random, am I just making connections that arn't real, am I hullisinative, but like how many coincidences does it take, but at the same time the idea to be ""smelling the future"" sounds so dumb

1fzwsr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseMD/comments/1fzwsr4/season_one_surprises_covers_all_of_season_one/,Season One Surprises (covers all of season one),"One thing I noticed on the re-watch is how dedicated House was to keeping Chase in season one during and after the Vogler arc and how much the writers tried to have everyone, including Chase, come out of that arc looking as okay as they could. 

**The Vogler Stuff**

As someone mentioned on the sub a week or so ago, in *Control*, the first episode with Vogler, Chase goes to Vogler after he screws up the angiogram and is worried he'll be fired and unable to get another job, and this is before there's the ultimatum about House having to fire someone from the team. 

So, when Chase initially goes to Vogler it's not about saving himself at Cameron or Foreman's expense. It's also before Vogler looks like he's necessarily going to be a villain, at least as far as Chase can tell, and it's after House has told Cameron, ""I want Chase scared. I want him doing everything he can to protect his job.""

In the next episode, *Mob Rules*, it seems House suspects Chase is the one who's been going to Cuddy and Vogler. Chase tells House he can trust him and House has his doubts. And Chase does go behind House's back about getting Joey discharged, but the discharge is something that all three fellows had agreed should be done, so it's not supposed to look that bad. And it's not without precedent. Foreman went behind House's back to Cuddy about a patient in *Damned if You Do* and Cuddy somehow knew House had told Cameron to lie to a patient in *Detox.* And then comes the ultimatum about firing someone at the end of this episode.

In *Heavy*, despite having been told he has to fire someone and despite strongly suspecting that Chase is the one feeding information to Vogler, House is willing to take a reduction in pay (along with the rest of the team) to keep everyone on the team and then gives Chase's name when it doesn't seem like there are other options.

In *Role Model*, House and Chase talk: 

>*House: How do you see this ending?*

>*Chase: What ending?*

>*House: I can’t fire you, so you have no reason to fear me, and therefore no reason to lie to me. You told Cuddy where I was. You told Vogler what I was doing. \[pause\]*

>*Chase: Yeah.*

>*House: So how can I work with you?*

>*Chase: Well, you don’t have a choice.*

  
But then, with Vogler gone, House very much *does* have a choice about whether he wants to work with Chase and he does want to keep him. This is something that was really brought home to me in *Kids*. There are multiple highly qualified candidates there to interview for Cameron's position after she's quit, but if House had been waffling about getting rid of Chase--and it's in this episode where Wilson says to fire Chase instead of torturing him and House tells Wilson that ""All \[Chase\] did was save his job""--then he very easily could have selected one of those candidates to replace Chase. This is also the episode where there's this exchange between House and Wilson that starts out being about fellowship applicants:

>*House: So what, your advice is... hire someone I’m not happy with and be happy?*  
  
*Wilson: No, my advice is much more subtle. Stop being an ass. You always find some tiny little flaw to push people away.*

Admittedly, none of this conversation is about Chase, but we've just come out of an arc where House could have felt like pushing Chase away, but he didn't and he doesn't. By *Love Hurts*, if not before, he's back to teaching him. Chase suspects that House wants to humiliate him when he tells him to stick his nose in Harvey's mouth, but House legitimately wants him to pick up on the smell for diagnostic reasons. 

I think you could possibly make the case that it's after Vogler that Chase starts feeling a lot more loyalty to House and liking him better. He did genuinely like him before and said so and why, but he didn't seem to think House would necessarily have his back. To some degree, House didn't--he did tell Vogler to fire Chase and I don't know that he thought it wouldn't work when he suggested it--but he definitely stuck with Chase afterwards when he certainly didn't need to. Which brings me to:

**The Fellows and House**

It seems like it's actually Cameron this season who's talked about initially, and possibly the most often, as supporting House the most, diagnostically and otherwise. In *Damned if You Do*, she's the one who keeps bringing up what House thought was wrong with Sister Augustine past the point where Cuddy wants to hear about what House thought after she's taken over the case, and House also gives Cameron a talk here about how she needs to stand up for her own ideas. This exchange from the episode was also interesting:

>*Foreman: He doesn’t know what he’s doing. The only problem that woman has is that House grabbed the wrong syringe.*  
  
*Cameron: You don’t trust him?*  
  
*Foreman: I don’t trust a man who won’t admit he might be wrong. I notice you weren’t so quick to tell her she has Churg-Strauss and only has a couple years to live.*  
  
*Cameron: I don’t tell patients bad news unless it’s conclusive.*  
  
*Foreman: Because you know he might be wrong.*  
  
*Cameron: About Churg-Strauss, not about what happened in the clinic.*  
  
*Foreman: What about you, Chase? You think he’s infallible, too?*  
  
*Chase: All I know is, if House didn’t make a mistake and Sister Augustine has Churg-Strauss, he’ll be self-satisfied and our lives will be good for a few weeks. If House did make a mistake, he’ll be upset and our lives will be miserable for months.*

Foreman implies that Cameron thinks House is infallible and Chase just hopes he's right because it will make their lives easier. In the next episode, *The Socratic Method*, it also seems like Chase likes it when House is right not because he wants to kiss his ass, but for other reasons:

>*CHASE: I still don’t buy a vitamin K deficiency.*  
  
*FOREMAN: House was right. That usually makes you happy. Less work for us.*

Then in *Detox*, Foreman again implies Cameron puts up with a ton from House: ""What does the man have to do to piss you off?"" 

There's also this exchange in the episode:

>*Cameron: Yeah, I trusted you.*  
  
*House: You always trust me. Big mistake. Lupus is a bad diagnosis.*

Cameron herself tells House, ""I’m the only one who’s always stood behind you when you’ve screwed up"" in *Heavy*, and it's in that same episode that Chase tells Cameron, ""House isn’t just going to protect you because you kiss his ass!""

This isn't to say that Cameron never disagrees with House or talk back to him, but she's characterized quite often this season as someone who always trusts/backs up House. 

As far as I can tell, Chase only gets called an ass kisser once,and it's by Foreman in *Sports Medicine*:

>*Chase: You got a text message, though. Friday night-very cryptic.*  
  
*Foreman: Gee…thanks for checking. Can you cover for me?*  
  
*Chase: Oncology seminar. Friday night the same thing as the car trouble?*  
  
*Foreman: I HAD car trouble.*  
  
*Chase: House says you were lying. I believe him.*  
  
*Foreman: …What’s that? You got a little wet smudge at the end of your nose!*  
  
*Chase: Hey, I like the guy. He says what he wants, does what he wants.*  


There are also a few points where Chase goes against House's orders or clearly disagrees. In *DNR*, House orders him several times to intubate John and Chase refuses because of the DNR. It's not like Chase is alone in this, but he doesn't just automatically do what House wants. He also sides with Cameron and Foreman against giving Stacy's husband the cocktail to cause a reaction in *Honeymoon*. 

Chase does say to Foreman in *Detox*: "" House always pulls these stunts and he’s right more often--""  but he also says this in *DNR*:

>*Foreman: You guys really don’t have a problem with him, with what he did?*  
  
*Chase: He knows we disagree with his choice.*

Chase also makes it clear in that episode that he believes House isn't just right because he's lucky. 

**Chase and Cameron**

Speaking of *DNR,* there's another instance of Chase complimenting Cameron: 

>*Cameron: It was a stroke!*  
  
*Chase: Well done, Cameron.*

He also tells Cameron ""good call""  in the first episode when Cameron insists on bringing a patient out of the MRI when Chase had thought she was okay, and he tells House that Cameron had the good idea of having the parents hold the baby during a sheet change in *Maternity*. 

He also assures Cameron that House doesn't like anyone in *Mob Rules* when Cameron tells him House says he didn't like her, and I love that this is something House said to Vogler himself in the episode before that, *Control*: ""It’s nothing personal, I don’t like anybody."" More evidence for ""Chase really knows House."" 

 I'm not sure, though, whether he's right when he gives this advice to Cameron re: needing to jump House if she wants him in *Love Hurts*: ""House isn’t going to hand you anything. You want him, you’ve gotta take him. Jump him.""

Another thing I found interesting was that in *Control,* Chase says ""Oooh, very aggressive. I like that"" to Jenny while flirting during the angiogram, and this isn't something Cameron overhears. But then, later in the episode, Cameron says to House: ""People… dismiss me. Because I’m a woman, because I’m pretty, because I’m not aggressive."" To me, this implies that at this point, the writers are signaling that Cameron and Chase maybe aren't a good fit?

**Other Things I Found Interesting:**

Just a few, because this has gotten long!

* We get quite a bit of background on Chase this season. While we learn a bit about Foreman's background first and there's a hint of Cameron's backstory with loss in episode 4, *Maternity*, we learn a lot about Chase in *Damned if You Do*, *The Socratic Method*, and *Cursed* and there's quite a bit of screen time where we're meant to be thinking about what might have formed Chase as a character.
* Cuddy and Wilson were both encouraging the House/Cameron romance! Something tells me that wouldn't have happened had this been made today.
* I think April, one of the nurses, calls Chase ""Robert"" in *Occam's Razor*--just thought that was interesting from a ""times first names are used on the show"" perspective. Did anyone else hear that?
* Cameron has a difficult time with the baby's death in *Maternity*, but so does Chase. It's not as pronounced and not the focus, but he keeps trying to shock the baby past the point where it's likely to do any good and House stops him and pronounces time of death himself.
* Wilson brings cases to House!
* In *Cursed*, Chase tells Gabe, ""Know what? Girls like the cool guys now. You give it a few years, they start liking the smart guys. You’ll be all right."" Does Chase know this from experience?
* Also *Cursed*-related, but. Chase tells House, re: his dad: ""I don’t hate him. I loved him until I figured out that it hurts a lot less to just not care. You don’t expect him to turn up to your football match? No disappointments. You don’t expect a call on your birthday, don’t expect to see him for months? No disappointments. You want us to go make up? Sink a few beers together, nice family hug? I’ve given him enough hugs. He’s given me enough disappointments."" And then...he turns around and tells Gabe about how you've got to love your dad and tries to go have a drink with his dad and gives him a hug. He tries to make not caring stick but he can't. And what's heartbreaking too is that we find out in *Control* that he went to Switzerland with his time off and, had he known about his dad's condition, could have and probably would have gone to Australia instead.
* House can be quite sweet and romantic sometimes. The corsage for Cameron, the hug and coffee (while remembering her coffee preferences from when they were dating) for Stacy? Yes, he's blunt and hurts their feelings too, but he's also a lot more romantic than I would have thought he'd be.",2,1728494364.0,HouseMD,1,1.0,False
1fzwr60,https://www.reddit.com/r/Shadowrun/comments/1fzwr60/flux_state_economics/,Flux state economics?,"I've been running a Shadowrun campaign in 2073-2075 Seattle for about 5 years now, and I'm looking for something different. I was actually thinking of a domain-building fantasy game, but my players want to continue with Shadowrun. But I think my campaign has run its course, and I want something different than the typical mission-based structure of Shadowrun.

So replaying Dragonfall, I suddenly had an idea: why not manage a kiez in Berlin's pre-2055 F-State? That sounds like an interesting way to have some domain-building game in Shadowrun.

Maybe I can use Reign's Company rules or use Stars Without Number's Faction rules or something to create a dynamic landscape where factions and borders and interests keep shifting and the PCs are constantly looking for ways to protect or expand their community. I like the idea, and Dragonfall does have a couple of runs that hint a bit at what that would look like (fixing the pumps in the sewers, tracking that missing weapons shipment).

But it also runs into a problem: what does the economy of the Flux State actually run on? Do they produce anything? Do people have regular jobs with megacorps? Or is it all parasitic, robbing other kiezes, or robbing people outside Berlin? Because all Dragonfall shows us are people selling drugs to junkies, smugglers smuggling stuff, etc. Someone sells imported coffee, and of course plenty of people sell weapons and cyberware, but how do their customers get money? Everything seems to be imported, but what are Berlin's exports? Shadowrunners? Everything seems to run on either crime or charity, but that's no basis for an economy. And the F-State is supposed to offer more stability than the pure chaos that's never far away. But how?

The time of year when the leaves turn, the days grow shorter, and our Instagram feeds are flooded with *Pumpkin Spice Everything*! Because nothing screams “fall” quite like sipping on a hot beverage while sweat trickles down your back in 95-degree heat. 

Is it just me, or does the thought of pumpkin spice lattes make you want to jump into a kiddie pool filled with iced coffee instead? Who needs sweaters and cozy blankets when you can enjoy the delightful aroma of cinnamon and nutmeg while simultaneously melting like a popsicle?

Let’s get real: October is the perfect time to embrace the true spirit of pumpkin spice! Who cares if you’re still cranking the AC and dodging sunburn? Just slap on a sweater (for the aesthetic) and take that Instagram shot—because nothing says “fall” like a pumpkin spice latte in a tank top! 

So, here’s to pretending we’re cozying up by a fire when really we’re just trying not to faint in the heat! Cheers to October, where the only thing more overhyped than pumpkin spice is our collective denial about the weather! 🎃☕️🔥

I got diagnosed with depressiom when I was 17 now I am 28. 

I have tried different meds for depression but always after we solved my sleep and not being suicidal with antidepressants, 1 symptom persisted. Not be able to do things/activities. Even making a coffee or a tea felt like I need to put so much effort into it. I thought this was depression. 

After 10 years I got in a new psychtrict clinic specialiyed for addictions not that I woúd have any but they also treat all sorts of mental disorders. I chose this specific clinic cause I like that the doctors has many years of experience and also does research. 

His psychologist diagnosed me with add but I coúd not believe it because no one in 10 years even suggested it. So I was rejecting the diagnoses. Than I started to read about boredome struggles and other things.

I am taking Brintillix 20mg, Venlafaxine (100mg) - as I was rejecting add meds but could not focus they gave me venlafaxine as it is SNRI.

I started Strattera 18mg and I started to feel less anxiety, less worry, and less social anxiety all the things I really struggled with even on two different antidepressants. I did 5 weeks 18mg and now I started second week 36mg and I can see I feel wven less anxious and more ok to be myself without second thoughts and worries.

Lets see how it will continue but I wanted to give hope to those that have been in the system for a long time and nothing seems to work. It can actually start to work one day ♥️",4,1728494135.0,StratteraRx,0,1.0,False
1fzwo0f,https://i.redd.it/yl3o87c7krtd1.jpeg,Top Reasons for Composite Filling Failure and How to Fix Them,"1. Post-Operative Sensitivity
One of the most common complaints after getting a composite filling, especially in Class II or V cases.

Causes:

Leakage

Over-drying the dentin

Polymerization shrinkage


Solution:
When applying the etch, make sure it's rinsed well and dried properly. The key is to dry it to ""moist dry"" – not completely dry. If over-dried, the dentinal tubules collapse, preventing proper bonding later. You may need to replace the filling or repair it correctly.




---

2. Recurrent Caries
New decay forming after a filling can happen due to several reasons.

Causes:

Not removing all the decay before placing the composite

Shrinkage that leads to leakage and bacteria sneaking in

Rough surface due to improper finishing and polishing, making it a haven for bacteria


Solution:
Remove the old composite, clean out any new decay, and replace it with a properly placed composite.




---

3. Discoloration
Aesthetic issues can arise if the composite changes color over time.

Causes:

Wrong shade selection from the start

Smoking or excessive tea/coffee intake staining the composite

Poor finishing and polishing


Solution:
Depending on the extent of discoloration, you may need resurfacing, veneering, or even a total replacement.




---

4. Dislodgement of the Filling
Sometimes, the filling just falls out.

Causes:

Poor bonding due to improper technique or curing

Inadequate isolation during the procedure


Solution:
Replace the filling.




---

5. Gross Fracture
Composite is brittle and has low flexural strength, which can lead to fractures.

Causes:

Improper application in the cavity or voids present during placement


Solution:
Replace the filling or attempt to repair it, if possible.

I’m really reaching out because I’m feeling pretty stuck with my fibromyalgia treatment and could use some advice or support.

Diagnosis: I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia about six months ago, and it’s been a rough ride since then.

Cymbalta (60 mg): This has helped reduce my pain a lot, which is great.My doctor wants to increase it to 90 mg, but I’m worried about the side effects.

 Even taking a low dose like 50 mg in the morning of pregabalin helps with pain but makes me super drowsy, which is a problem for work.

Staying Alert at Work:

When I take muscle relaxants or pregabalin in the morning, I can’t stay awake and focused at my job.
If I try to use caffeine to stay awake, it seems to mess with the meds:
Caffeine: Feels like it reduces the effectiveness of pregabalin , same goes for muscle relaxants as well . 

Cymbalta helps with how I perceive pain but doesn’t fully manage it like pregabalin does.
Even if I take a higher dose of pregabalin (150 mg) at night, I still wake up with pain in the morning.

Are there any meds out there that can help with chronic pain without making me sleepy or messing with my alertness?

Caffiene also increases my muscle spasms but I don’t wanna miss out coffee in morning .

# How Does Java Burn Work?

Java Burn is a top weight loss supplement known for its unique formula. It uses science-backed methods to boost your metabolism and fat burning. Let's explore why it's so popular among those who care about their health.

**Exploring the Science Behind the Supplement**

Java Burn combines natural ingredients to help with metabolism and weight management. It targets the main reasons for weight gain, like hormonal issues and slow metabolism.

*Green tea extract* is a key part of Java Burn. It's a strong antioxidant that boosts metabolism and fat burning. This helps your body burn more calories naturally.

*L-theanine* is another important ingredient. It comes from green tea and works with caffeine to give energy without the jitters. This makes Java Burn a smooth and effective choice.

Java Burn also includes chromium, L-carnitine, and other nutrients to support weight management. These ingredients help with appetite, nutrient absorption, and energy production. Together, they aim to provide a complete solution for lasting weight loss.

# Java Burn: Separating Fact from Fiction

The weight loss supplement market is growing fast. It's important to look at claims about products like Java Burn carefully. We'll check if the manufacturer's claims match the science to help you decide.

Java Burn's team says it boosts metabolism and burns fat. *But, the science on Java Burn's ingredients is still out*. Some parts, like green tea extract, might help with weight. Yet, there's no solid proof that Java Burn works as claimed.

Java Burn also promises to ""melt away"" fat. *This kind of talk is common in weight loss ads*. But, losing fat takes time and effort, not a magic pill. It needs a healthy diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes.

* The Java Burn website says it's ""100% safe,"" but always talk to a doctor before trying new supplements, especially if you have health issues or take meds.
* Some people say Java Burn works for them, but be careful of online reviews. They might not show the whole picture.

Java Burn might have some good points, but we need to be careful. Look at the facts and not just what the company says. Always talk to a doctor before trying any weight loss product. Look for proven ways to lose weight instead.

>""The weight loss supplement market is full of big claims and no proof. Be smart and look for science-backed facts, not just marketing talk.""

Although I was always there for her, I recognize that in all these years, she has put me and my family in a lot of difficult times, and she has never shown ways of appreciation for us supporting her and never really got support from her when I needed.  

Just recently, she wanted to come visit me with my mom as we live in different countries. She was supposed to stay at my place for a week. I am 8 month pregnant and getting mentally and physically exhausted quite easily. I ensured the house was perfectly clean for her to come, made her homemade food lunch and dinner to make her happy, always ensuring she was having a good time and everything she needed. Everyday she locked herself in her room where she was locked for 10 hours a day saying she was working (although most of the time she was in bed), criticizing the food I made for her, never asking to chip in for anything, piling up dirty dishes for me to clean.

She told me that she has to work all day and night until 3am and that would have completely woke everybody up during the night (I live with my husband) as it is a small house but I didn’t say anything as she seemed quite stressed with work. Yesterday it was my birthday and we went out for a coffee. While we were chatting, for some reason she thought I was not listening to her (while in reality I was and was asking her questions as a way of showing interest and keep the conversation going) and she snapped at me saying how inconsiderate of me to do that and attacked me verbally and had a panic attack. I was taken by a huge surprise and honestly with all the hormonal changes I am going through I didn’t react in my best way and told her that I am not able to take on any of her issues and attacks as I did in the past. I told her I need a calm and peaceful place at the moment as pregnancy has been hard on me and that it’d have been better if she would have found a place for the remaining 3 nights.

With its rustic appeal and modern finishes, the farmhouse kitchen table is a staple in many homes. At Hollis Millworks, we believe in crafting tables that blend both tradition and elegance, making them the ideal centerpiece for any kitchen. One of the most popular choices among homeowners is the  [farmhouse kitchen table white](https://hollismillworks.com/rusticfarmhousewoodstable),  offering both timeless beauty and practicality.

# The Appeal of Farmhouse Style

The farmhouse style brings together simplicity, functionality, and a hint of rustic charm. Its origins lie in the rural lifestyle, where practicality was key, but so was the welcoming atmosphere of a family-oriented home. Over the years, this style has evolved, blending modern touches without losing its down-to-earth roots. A farmhouse kitchen table, especially in white, perfectly captures this balance. It provides a fresh, clean look while maintaining the sturdy, robust feel that defines farmhouse furniture.

# Why Choose a White Farmhouse Kitchen Table?

**Versatile Design** 

A white farmhouse kitchen table is incredibly versatile. It complements various kitchen styles, from traditional country kitchens to more modern, minimalistic designs. The neutral white color allows the table to blend seamlessly into any color scheme, making it easy to pair with different chairs, lighting, and decor. Whether you have a kitchen full of warm wood tones or sleek stainless steel appliances, a white farmhouse table will fit right in.

**Brightens the Space**

White furniture has the unique ability to brighten up any room. In a kitchen, where natural light is essential, a white farmhouse kitchen table can reflect light and make the space feel larger and more open. This is especially useful in smaller kitchens where maximizing space and light is important. A well-crafted white table from Hollis Millworks can elevate even the coziest of kitchens, adding a sense of airiness and freshness.

**Timeless Aesthetic**

While trends come and go, white remains a classic choice in interior design. A farmhouse kitchen table in white has a timeless appeal that will never feel outdated. Hollis Millworks ensures that our tables are built to last both in style and quality, so you can be confident that your table will remain a cherished piece in your home for years to come.

Ugh, this itchy scalp is driving me crazy. Keeping me up at night. Can’t sleep. And when I do, I wake up scratching. This can’t go on.

I’ve always had an itchy scalp. There are special shampoos for that, and I’ve tried them all. Some work better than others, but they don’t make the problem go away. Not entirely. That said, I never dreamed I’d be in this scenario.

I was playing piano, working on a difficult performance piece, when the critters first appeared. As usual, my scalp was super itchy. Only this time when I scratched, something flew out and landed on my lap. I must’ve jumped a mile high. The thing was hideous, with long, curvy antennas and tiny toes, tap, tap, tapping as it crawled across my lap.

I squashed it.

The thing shrieked as it exploded. Total nasty. Then, trying not to panic, I lowered my head and went to town, shaking and scratching, seeing what else was living in there.

“Gross!”

A fleet of crawling critters scooted out from my hair. Ugh. Head lice. At my age? Must’ve gotten it from one of my piano students. Totally annoyed, I fled to the drug store and picked up the appropriate treatment, then I set about ridding myself of these uninvited guests.

The following week was spent trying to kill those little buggers, but they persevered, and kept coming back. Sleep was impossible. All I could do was lay in bed and scratch, my fingernails brown and gross from all the scratching.

At wit’s end, I asked Marley, my BFF, to have a look. She’s tough, and certainly not the squeamish type. If she can’t help, I’m screwed.

Marley went in for inspection. She gasped and groaned and gagged. Five minutes later she’s running out the door, eyes wild with accusation. To this day, she won’t answer my texts. That’s when I knew something was wrong. Terribly wrong.

My mind went on overdrive. This is absurd. How bad could it be? Then I heard the tap, tap, tapping of tiny toes, trailblazing across my bedroom floor. I used my phone’s flashlight to have a closer look, and shuddered. My mind went sideways. I’d never seen anything so repulsive in my life. Critters, but unlike any I’d ever seen.

With much effort, I coaxed the cretaceous-looking critters into a shoebox. Tap, tap, tap, they went, marching around the box like tiny warriors. From a distance, they looked like head lice, but they moved too fast, and made too much noise.

Totally freaked out, I peeled off my clothes and removed my bed sheets. Laundry time! Ugh. My pillow cases were crawling with them. I shook them off into the shoebox, carefully, and threw the laundry into the machine.

Afterwards, I retreated to my bedroom feeling sickened and sad. Can I not have one good day? Is that too much to ask? Then I glanced into the shoebox, and nearly fainted.

A Battle of Epic Proportions. That’s the only way to describe it. The critters were fighting each other, crawling and biting and doing God-knows-what else. But in teams. And they were vicious. I couldn’t watch.

Itch, itch, scratch, scratch.

My condition was worsening. My scalp and neck were sore with scabs. Over the shoebox, I scratched and itched and tossed my hair about. It looked like a Christmas snow globe, where snow dances after shaking it. Except this wasn’t snow, this was some hideous form of head lice.

Or so I thought.

I went online and did some research, and it became glaringly obvious I wasn’t dealing with head lice. Not even close. Their behavior didn’t match. Head lice don’t battle each other. Nor did they form groups. Plus, these buggers were too big. Ugh. Now what?

I fetched my microscope, which I hadn’t used in years, and caught one. I put it under the microscope for a closer look, and nearly died. My mind was on the brink. This can’t be happening, I told myself, again and again. This isn’t real.

But it was.

I went online, searching for matches. Nothing matched. These cruel-looking critters had fangs and claws and wings. The wings scared me most. If they could fly, then what? For now, at least, they crawled; tap, tap, tapping as they skittered across the shoebox.

I crushed it. Then I scooted to the washroom and regurgitated my breakfast. My stomach was turning faster than the laundry machine. After showering, I set off to work, scared and confused. It was a miserable day, lemme tell ya. As a piano instructor, I sit close to the students. I did my very best at keeping a distance, but there’s only one piano, and it’s a modest sized room.

Itch, itch, scratch, scratch.

All day I scratched, careful not to spray critters everywhere, but unable to help myself. I was constantly cleaning the gunk from my fingernails, which were brown and gross, and in plain view as I played piano. Finally, my shift ended and I scooted home as fast as possible, hoping to get to the bottom of this. Those little buggers must’ve come from somewhere, right?

When I got home, I gasped. The shoebox had completely transformed. Inside the box was a city. They must’ve scoured my bedroom for supplies. But how? A discarded sock, for instance, was torn to shreds and used as grass. Little specs of cotton now covered the entire base of the box. My favorite Pokémon card, which I’d kept since I was a kid, was chewed up and made into tiny houses. Not only that, they were using my empty earbud container as a swimming pool! Like, where did they get the water?

I had to stand back and catch my breath. My heart was threatening to explode. I’m twenty-five, I told myself, way too young for a heart attack. Then I noticed something deeply disturbing: the shoebox was divided into halves. One side was sophisticated, with houses and a public pool etc. The other side was filthy and unkempt, with big black mounds – which may have been feces – piled high around the edges of the box. Droplets of blood were splattered across the socky grass, staining it crimson-red.

I covered the box, then spent all night on the computer, looking for answers. I researched thousands of species of insects, but none fit the description. Not even close.

Coffee became my salvation. I was ridiculously tired, and should probably be kept under quarantine, but bills are bills. Having no other source of income, I had to work. I knew damn-well I shouldn’t be out in public, the last thing I wanted to do was infect anyone, but what choice did I have? Ugh. This was awful. The Battle of Epic Proportions was taking place on my scalp, and I was the referee.

Itch, itch, scratch, scratch.

Somehow, I made it through work, itching and scratching, clawing my scalp with tremendous force. When I got home, I went straight to my room. I live in a small one-bedroom apartment, so at least there weren’t roommates to contend with. That said, I wish I had someone to confide in. Then again, look at what happened last time. I still hadn't heard from Marley. Oh, the conundrum.

The shoebox was gone. I scratched my head, this time out of confusion. I swear I’d left it in the middle of the floor.

Panic.

First, I checked the closet, searching frantically through wardrobes. Nothing. Then I got on my hands and knees and searched under the bed. Aha! Found it. Sneaky buggers. When I flashed a light, the bugs disappeared, skittering inside their newly developed homes, or mounds of poop, depending on what side of the box they were living in.

The box was buzzy. I couldn’t believe my eyes. The sophisticated critters, enjoying a more luxurious lifestyle, had constructed some kind of recreation area using pens and pencils and pieces of scrap paper. Plus, they had condos! I swear to God, they did! Ugh, they’d stolen more Pokémon cards. Hence forward, I started referring to them as Mavericks.

Inside the shoebox was a war zone. Hundreds of critters were dead, mostly from the gross side. Apparently, the Mavericks had conquered them. But not entirely. The Filthy’s (as I’ve come to call them), were fighting back, making horrible hissing sounds, then taking refuge in the mounds of poop.

Itch, itch, scratch, scratch.

My head was worsening, my neck red with rash. Feverishly, I flung my head over the box and scratched. Ahh, sweet relief. When I stood up, I gasped. The entire box was filled with bugs. To them, a tornado must’ve touched down. Next thing I know, both sides went to work, separating one species from the other, fussing and fighting and squeaking and squalling.

Using tweezers, I scooped up a Filthy for inspection. Yikes! Unlike the Mavericks, these buggers were fat, with crap-like bellies, and hundreds of tiny legs. No wings. Their teeth were treacherous, like tiny razor blades, their eyes were glowing red bulbs.

I crushed it.

I considered seeing a doctor, but waiting for hours, only to be given lice shampoo, was not a top priority. So, I shaved my head. Goodbye golden locks. Hello sweet relief. For whatever reason, I put my defiled hair into the shoebox. The creatures went on a warpath, gathering the precious cargo, hissing and squawking and fighting. Then I took the box out back and set it on fire. The sound was horrendous, like a million tiny souls screaming out at once. The smell was way worse. Completely distraught, I retreated into my bedroom, longing for a good night’s rest.

Itch, itch, scratch, scratch.

Only now, my belly itched. What the? I flashed a light. Those godawful critters were scampering across my abdomen. One poked out of my belly button. I crushed it, then I turned on the bedside light, and screamed. They were everywhere! My entire floor was shimmering, like a moving carpet. Ugh, another sleepless night.

…

A week has passed, and I’m at a loss. Ultimately, I did see a doctor, and as predicted, after waiting nearly two hours, she gave me special cream and sent me on my way.

Itch, itch, scratch, scratch.

I do miss my hair, but I don’t miss the creepy critters. My scalp is starting to heal, but I can’t get the buggers out of my apartment. Every time I kill one, they multiply. So, for now, they’re staying. Ugh. Like the shoebox, my bedroom is divided into halves. The Battle of Epic Proportions continues.

I can only wonder how long the war will last, and who will be victorious. Every time the Filthy’s seem to be conquered, like true underdogs, they regroup and retaliate, killing thousands of Mavericks.

But how?

They’ve discovered fire. Maybe the tea light candles were a bad idea. I pray they don’t burn my house down.

1fzw15c,https://www.reddit.com/r/HareKrishna/comments/1fzw15c/advice/,Advice,"So I live in a small apartment building where there are 6 apartments, including the one occupied by the owner.  She is a nice lady, and we have some things in common, like different crafts we like to do.  She is retired so has a lot of time on her hands.  She is always inviting me for coffee, or to have some cake or to go to lunch.  I work 30 hours a week, as well as spending a couple of hours a day studying and reading devotional texts, as well as 2 to 2.5 hours chanting my rounds, so my days are pretty full.  But that is not really the problem.  The first time she invited me to lunch, I explained that I don´t eat meat, so maybe we could go to a vegetarian restaurant once day.  A couple of days later she invited me for coffee and I was in a hurry and said no, I am about to start work.  Again, she offered to treat me to lunch at a place that serves meat, and again I said no, and again, told her I don´t eat meat or eggs.  So a week goes by and she, totally on her own, brings me a fruit salad and a chicken sandwich!  I did eat the fruit, but I gave the sandwich to my dog.  She asked me later how it was and I said, once again, I don´t eat meat, but the dog liked it.  She was a little mad, I think.  She had invited me to go swimming which I also declined saying I don´t have the money.  So I think the issue is that she believes I don´t have enough MONEY to eat meat, so she keeps trying to  give me things with meat in them, and I keep saying I don´t eat meat.  Today, again, she wants to go for lunch, so I suggested, again, one of the two vegetarian restaurants that I trust, but she doesn´t want to go to either of them.  She does know that it is for religious reason (though I was already a vegetarian before I was a devotee), and at this point I just don´t know how to politely tell her NO.

I’m the proud owner of a coffee shop space in NYC, and I’m looking to make it as appealing as possible to attract potential tenants, particularly established coffee shop owners or aspiring entrepreneurs in the coffee industry.

I believe a welcoming and functional space can truly enhance the coffee-drinking experience, so I’m open to suggestions on various aspects, including:

1. **Interior Design:** What design elements or themes do you think resonate well with coffee shop patrons? Are there specific colors, furniture styles, or layouts that create a cozy and inviting atmosphere?
2. **Amenities:** What facilities or features do you think are essential for a coffee shop? Should I consider things like outdoor seating, a community area, or even additional features like a small stage for live music?
3. **Location Considerations:** How important is the surrounding environment to coffee shop owners? Are there specific nearby businesses or foot traffic elements that could make the location more appealing?
4. **Lease Terms:** What lease terms or incentives would encourage established coffee shop owners to consider renting the space?
5. **Community Engagement:** What kinds of events or collaborations should I consider to foster a sense of community and encourage repeat customers?

I appreciate any insights or experiences you can share, whether you’re a coffee shop owner, a customer, or someone with a passion for the coffee industry. Thank you in advance for your help!

1fzvw2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/scabies/comments/1fzvw2l/nightmare/,Nightmare,"Ok, here’s my story.   I was bit by something over a yearcagi.  Not sure how long.  Went to Dr.  two bite marks but too far apart for spider on my right upper tummy.  Antibiotics, go home.  Fast forward.  The main bite marker always looked like a large pore with a grayish or tannish scab deep in the middle.  The skin under this get getting harder and harder and the knot grew larger and larger.  Then I started getting knots all over the place in different areas.  I had tiny little red dots but thought those were like the red mole things my mom got as she aged.  Nothing ever bothered me.  No ibviiys tunnels.  Nothing in webs of fingers or toes.  Nothing in the bottom of my feet or armpits, or behind knees.  Nothing at all.   During this time, Dr has pressed on my tummy, I have had CT scans, I have had 2 or 3 surgeries….no one ever said one word.   Then, after back or neck surgery this year, doesn’t matter which, I brought home a guest from the hospital!  Super lice.  During the few weeks it has taken to kill those little bastards, I used so many different things!!  Smothering, Permethrin, Ivermectin twice… etc.  Well, those chemicals really set something off because, all of a sudden I had things crawling all over me every night.  They would come out to play around 4 pm and start biting me and chewing me up all night long.  This went on for 4 weeks!  I had nights I wouldn’t even go to sleep because I felt sure if I laid my head down I would contaminate everything.  I thought I still had lice.  I would see things in my sheets and wash clothes daily and vacuum like a mad woman.  I was suffering mentally and physically and I was hysterical by week 4.  I literally wanted to die because these things but the crap out of me and I itched like crazy and I still never put anything together.  Finally, on week four, my husband says we have to be missing something.  I sprayed the living room furniture again and later that day, I found a bug on the cushion.  I thought, well we have bedbugs and these tiny worm things crawling in me must be larvae.  Then I bought a crap ton of bed bug killers.  Next day, my daughter says Reddit friends say my bug is not a bed bug.  Check for scabies or other mites or something different.  I laughed that off and said, I don’t have scabies!  I am 64, and go nowhere and have no company BUT I have 3 indoor dogs and 2 outdoor cats.  Little did I know.  These little teeny tiny worm like things I would catch and scrape off when biting, and I took pictures of it all, must be the first nymph stage of a scabies mite.  Thank God for cell phones with cameras and zoom options!!  When I looked up and found that tiny worm picture in Google, I immediately went to the bathroom and squeezed in that first bite that had the massive knot under it.  I had to dig in with a sterile needle to remove the scab first.  Not pleasant at all.  Once I got that done, I squeezed like crazy under that knot to force something out but nothing really ever came out, not like what I was expecting.  Not sure what ai expected.  But, what I did get was drops of what seemed like coagulated blood.  So I took that needle and dragged the tip through the drop of blood on the toilet paper, and at the end of the smear there was a tiny tiny speck of dark red either on needle tip or TP.  I did this 3 times (and it was extremely painful because it was already extremely bruised) and got that teeny tiny speck each time.  Took my phone and blew up that zoom to 15x.  Took pictures and freaked out like you can’t imagine.  I had squeezed out 3 tiny bugs!
Then I remembered cleaning my ear with q tip when head lice started because kept feeling something crawling in one ear.  I thought, wow, I didn’t know lice could live in your ear!  I pulled out a big clump of what looked like coffee grounds that made a hill on the side of that qtip.  Wish I had taken a picture.  Didn’t know what it was.  I have been cleaning that ear out faithfully since and getting black earwax and actually could see a bug!  Now I know I have scabies and I am going completely insane with afternoon to morning chew time.  

Here is the good information.  I had some transparent thin skin film I use over surgical places for showering.  Had a lot of this,  can buy a box of it at CVS.  Transparent Film Dressing.  Sterile  individually wrapped frame  6x8 10 sheets.   After I showered 2 nights ago, I dried thoroughly and before the little bastard worms could crawl out for dinner, I had my husband cover every red spot in my body with this transparent “skin.”  Bigger pieces for more spits in one area and just little pieces cut up for one here or there.  We cut up each sheet to use accordingly and still had about 5 sheets left over.  This was just an experiment I thought of to save my sanity.  I figured if those nymphs couldn’t craw out to feed, I may actually stay comfortable.  

Well, let me tell you this was a freaking miracle!!!   I slept the entire night NO ITCHING OR BEING BIT for the first time in at least 3 weeks!  I slept so well my husband let me sleep until almost noon!  But, what was even better, the massive knot that was under my first burrow had shrunk by 80%!  I was astounded.  I also thought the Dr would never believe I have scabies, lol.  I decided, not to take the film off and not to shower for fear of getting water under it.  I slept like a baby again last night!  I am just amazed and relieved and thrilled and so much more comfortable!  Now, those little bastards do what ever they can to get to me and it is an all day attempt but they really can’t.  I was catching them by moving quickly and scraping it up under my fingernail by scratching with pressure several times in the general area.  You can tell when you get one.  You can kill them by popping with your fingernails or put in alcohol to take to your Dr.  They are no longer than 1 mm, yellowish white, and can scape it out from under your fingernail with another fingernail and get it out where you can see it.  What I am feeling during the day is most likely psychosomatic because I am not getting bitten and have only caught 2 so far, to put in my alcohol.  I go to dermatologist tomorrow and now the large mass is completely gone except hardness around the bite siite.  I doubt I have killed the mites and still need treatment, but I think I have killed 90% of them just with this film.

I hope this helps someone, if you made it to the end of the book 😂😂  this thing won’t let me fix typos aarrgh   Hope you can figure things out   Contact me if you need to.  Just text me.  I don’t mind giving out my number.  512 636 9497",2,1728492136.0,scabies,3,1.0,False

1fzvv85,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1fzvv85/stuck_in_a_career_i_hate_how_to_find_my_passion/,Stuck in a Career I Hate – How to Find My Passion?,"I 27M  currently working as a software developer for a medium-sized company in my area. I have a BSc in Computer Science and an MSc in Business Informatics. Honestly, I pursued the MSc because I felt a bit lost at the time and had already realized that coding would make me miserable in the long run.

When I finished my MSc, I was really interested in pursuing a management role in IT. However, when I applied for jobs and reached out to companies, most of them told me I needed more experience—which is fair, but where exactly am I supposed to get that experience? I reached out to product and project managers online and even met some for coffee. They all told me they worked their way up the ladder.

Needing money, I took the job that was available, which paid a decent amount, and I returned to coding. I thought I might be able to climb my way into a management role like they did, but now I realize I'm so miserable that I can’t even put in the effort to stand out for a promotion. Honestly, I think they’re considering firing me, as the tasks I’m given have become less and less important. I’ve only been at this job for four months.

When I was younger, I loved spending time behind a computer. I wrote a lot of code, and it made me feel good, like I was skilled at something. But now that coding is my job, I just feel like a cog in the wheel, and it makes me really depressed. I can’t sleep at night, knowing I have to work the next day. These past few months have been really tough on my mental health. Part of me feels like I should give up on IT entirely, but I don’t find joy in anything else either. I also feel too old to start something new and experiment with different paths. I’m also concerned about money—at 27, my friends are buying apartments and houses, and I can’t imagine being broke forever.

I used to be good with people. When I mentioned to strangers that I was a developer, they were always surprised and said I didn’t seem like one at all. I bring this up because I’ve noticed I enjoy my work more when I get to talk with people and be social, which is impossible when I’m just sitting behind a computer all day.

When I was younger, I always dreamed of having my own business in IT. But now, I feel like I’m not passionate enough to make it work. To be honest, I’m not sure I’m passionate about anything anymore. I still think that, long term, starting my own business could be the right path, as working for yourself can be a source of motivation. But I have no idea what direction to take.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated because I feel completely lost. I believe I need something more social, but at the same time, I want to be proud of the work I do, which complicates everything. I also feel like there should be something at the end that makes it all worthwhile. If I’m working hard but still can’t buy a house or live comfortably, then what's the point of even trying? Currently, with my salary, It would take me 30+ years to buy a decent house (nothing special) in my area.

P.S. I come from a small country in the EU, so the job market here is probably different from the US.

The base activated as the Chairs of GLOBAL entered. Most of the chairs anyway. The Organizer was currently distracted by the destruction of his primary team of criminals, to say the usually calm mastermind was enraged was an understatement and none of his fellow chairs doubted that he was focused.

The rest of the chairs were gathered with computers, files and other items of import sat at their sections of the circular table. Zero’s column rose front he center to look them all over equally. Equality was at the center of the compact that drove GLOBAL, after all. Granted the equality displayed was only for the Chairs and anyone below them was fair game to be used, manipulated or otherwise disposed of as any Chair holder saw fit. They were masters of the world after all, even if their mastery was mostly unknown. Each Chair holder settled and slowly acknowledged their numbers. Chair One was currently meeting via video communications as he was on a private jet back to Australia.

“Well we’re mostly gathered, I see.” Arman Kincaid smiled, “I am sorry to hear about the Organizer’s team. I hear only one made it out alive.” 

Blackwood nodded, silently musing on something else.

“The MechAnimals, of all people, saved her.” Six said in clear shock. “Clearly they are more capable than we thought.”

Dwayne O’Donnelly nodded, “Capable and, importantly, compassionate. They aren’t just mercenaries after all.” 

Gravitas snorted, “Of course they aren’t. A first year student could tell you the story they’re writing.” 

O’Donnelly stared at Gravitas, the tenth Chair was wearing a Pan Mask today and it left his mouth cleanly visible. “What does that mean?” 

“Everyone’s telling a story.” Gravitas explained, “And if we pay attention to what they do in their story we can almost see their choices.” 

“This is real life.” Kincaid laughed, “Not a comic.” 

“Art imitates life in many ways. And the same goes for the reverse.” Gravitas said snappishly. “The MechAnimals all have some form of tragedy in their life and tangled early on with Alan Quain, a known sympathizer of victims of circumstance. They honestly only had two routes from that point; redemption within society or complete the tragic tale.”

“An intriguing observation.” Zero noted, “I would like to discuss this more, later of course.” 

Gravitas nodded with a smile.

“Well, then I have something of a bit of good news.” O’Donnelly said, “My son has not popped up on any police reports. Granted my other children have, but that just means Maddock is plotting more than likely.” 

“Oh well, I suppose my men don’t need to worry about your entire damned family.” Kincaid scoffed, “I meant that literally too. I’ve read up on Revenants. Undead freaks.” He made a disgusted squint and waved his hand as if trying to fan an offensive odor away.

Dwayne O’Donnelly’s face turned red with anger. “My children are blessed! My eldest is Justice, his sister is Compassion and my youngest is Charity, love, if you haven’t read your bible this lifetime. It’s hard to tell how many souls one such as yourself has drained. And they cannot help that Abbadon corrupted their Calling to a Thrall.” 

“Careful Kincaid, I’m getting the sense you don’t like us much.” Smiles leaned back in his chair and let his psychotic grin spread wide as he looked at the normal human Senator.

“Everyone!” Zero’s speech peaked his speakers and caused everyone to flinch. “We cannot fight amongst ourselves. Save your personal issues for once this crisis has passed.”

O’Donnelly calmed himself and nodded. “I apologize Zero, I did not mean to derail the meeting. My only real goals in my wretched existence are to purge them of this curse. Everything else I do is a means to that end. Regardless of how the world views my actions or reasons, GLOBAL has been very accommodating in that regard.” 

Kincaid remained silent, much to everyone’s discomforted notice.

Zero paused as he calculated multiple possibilities, “I wish this had been shared sooner. I know our reasons are our own, but I  have the capabilities to do a great deal of research in a fraction of time less than any human. I also have access to magical resources. Please, speak to me after the meeting.” 

O’Donnelly paused, a curious, if not suspicious look crossed his face. He nodded and straightened his tie, which had become undone in his anger. 

“I too have some resources, family is important after all.” Chair One said with a nod from his screen. “I’ll send some your way. Demons, right?” 

“Technically Daemons.” O’Donnelly advised, “Devil and Demons are a political divide of the Infernal Realms. Daemons are nightmares of creation bound to hell and that is where they should stay.” 

“Well we can agree on something.” Kincaid nodded.

O’Donnelly promptly ignored the man.

“I do wish you well, such things are beyond my interest though, so I can only offer my moral support as it is.” Blackwood smiled courteously, “But I do suggest we focus back to the heroes and this current crisis, since Kincaid stepped up his original plans.” He pressed a button and a live feed from Washington D.C. came in. 

Zero focused on a screen as did the others. One the screen the co-chair of the Charter Committee was applauding the positive vote to enact even less restrictions on the young heroes of the country, no longer restricting the emergency actions to Dross City. Kincaid’s name was prominently featured as a co-sponsor.

“What is this?” Six balked, “You goddamn hypocrite!” 

“They’ll do horrible things. Get people killed. Maybe even wipe themselves out.” Kincaid gave a maddened smile, “And then we’ll impose harsher restrictions on them. Might even be able to lock them up for not registering powers no matter the age!” 

“You have given all the heroes in this country an emergency boost, and we already didn’t need that here!” Zero’s speakers peaked once again, his anger evident.

“Agreed.” One said darkly, “Fix this,senator.” 

O’Donnelly nodded in agreement.

Blackwood grinned and nodded. 

Chair four, Agent Holmes was simply staring in shock. “You’re an idiot! I should pull my agents from your protection detail.” 

Six just shook her head and grumbled about “Old men and times never changing.” 

Smiles just stared at the senator and gave him a thumbs down.

Chair Nine, Angel Reyes glared at the old man as he too gave a thumbs down.

Gravitas held up a score card and flipped it over to reveal a bold number 0.

“Fix this issue Senator.” Zero said, “I don’t care what promises you have to break or uphold. We cannot have heroes of any age loose over the country. Every operation will be in danger if this is not fixed.” 

Kincaid’s face went from triumphant and victorious to quiet and quelled. He nodded and sighed, before shaking his head and opening his phone up to communicate quickly with his staff. 

“Well, I would like to circle back to Five’s issues.” Gravitas spoke up, “I obtained some video of the attack and of the attack on the Charter Organization’s HQ.” 

Zero turned the focus of his cameras to Gravitas. “How?” 

“I don’t exist anymore, remember? I can be who I want people to think I am.” Gravitas laughed, “Like a police officer, a senator, or a specific hero with the right clearance.” He pressed a button and two videos played on the view screens in the center. “Left video is the attack on the Charter HQ. The right is the attack on the Animals. You’ll notice someone in both videos.” 

“I know that child.” Blackwood commented, “Skalva mentioned him, sent some units to recover him earlier in the year. He was butchering the poor child’s internal sound mechanics.” 

“He goes by Stereo.” Gravitas explained, “And he works for Tech-Master. Who, yes, is the Techno-Master under a rebranded name.” 

“He must have paid attention to the test markets.” O’Donnelly chuckled, “But those two...” He pointed to the individuals attacking the Animals, “Those were Animals years ago.” 

“The Organizer is likely feeling deeply betrayed.” Six sighed, “Someone should reach out, lend a hand.” 

Zero’s screens took over at that moment and the video of the attack on the Animals showed signs of the MechAnimals moving in the background, hiding from the slaughter they were observing. 

“Intriguing, but I can hardly blame them.” O’Donnelly said, “But I agree, someone should handle this. Nine?” 

“A solid choice.” One commented, “I second.” 

Blackwood nodded and gave a thumbs up. Holmes also nodded in agreement. Six nodded her agreement. Smiles seemed to ignore the situation, and waved his hand dismissively, abstaining on the vote. Kincaid nodded his approval. Gravitas held up a scorecard with a number “9” on it.

“Where are you getting those?” Kincaid snapped as he tried to reach over and take it, but the scorecard vanished.

“Magic.” Gravitas grinned. 

Kincaid glared at the magical reality warper and sat back with his arms crossed And clearly pouting.

“Chair Nine, would you be able to handle the situation of this Tech-Master as well as connecting back with the Organizer?” Zero asked.

Angel nodded, “I’ll get with the Organizer first. Move from there, confirm or deny some rumors I’ve been hearing. Then we’ll move, it will take time.” 

Zero’s digital avatar nodded. “Then I believe we are concluded here, unless there is more to speak on.” 

The chairs shook their heads.

“Then be on your guard, until Eight’s folly is cleared up we have unshackled young heroes with itchy trigger fingers, as it were.” Zero said as his avatar glared at the senator.

“Please, the big names won’t actually let them do anything.” Kincaid scoffed.

Blackwood shook his head in disgust and soon the others followed. Then they stood and departed. Not long after that though Zero had contacted three specific chairs via a private chat app. 

“Two, Three, and Ten. I fear earlier assessments of Eight’s behavior may be making more sense.” Zero’s message started the chat.

“Of course it does, he’s following the pattern his forebears placed down.” Blackwood said.

“He is behaving rather counter to our united goals.” O'Donnelly added.

“Fuck’em.” Gravitas added harshly. “Just not in the way he wants.” 

“GLOBAL requires an investigation into this, we must know if Kincaid is planning to betray us or if he has actively become a threat to our internal structure.” Zero relayed his mission to them. “Three, once your distractions have concluded, please assist Two and Ten.” 

Blackwood simply sent a smiley face as a response.

“How deep am I cleared to look into this?” Gravitas asked. “What if it leads to other members or chairs?” 

“Subservient members can be dealt with quietly. If other Chairs are implicated please contact me immediately.” Zero advised.

“I assume if we find him to be a problem that you want it handled quickly and quietly?” O’Donnelly clarified.

“Relay all information to me, I will put all relevant information together and inform this group of judgment.” Zero said. “Then if I will give the word to you if he is found to be an issue.”

“A shame, I’ve been warning of his dangers for a while, I was hoping to get the killing blow in.” Blackwood sent a sad face with his message. 

“Calm yourself Blackwood.” O’Donnely sent an image of a TV show character shaking their head in frustration.  

“I’ve got most of this handled.” Gravitas advised. “I’ll have everything we need in a week or so. Maybe a bit longer depending on what I find. Do I have permission to use my powers on Eight?” 

“Only to deceive during the investigation, no control.” Zero put the rules into place.

“I wish I had gone to Julliard then, but I’m a decent actor at times.” Gravitas responded and left the chat after that.

“I’ll see what other Senators are saying about him.” O’Donnelly advised, “I may not be able to buy one like the old days, but they love their gossip.” He then disconnected as well. 

Zero waited patiently.

“I’ll hold my tongue for now.” Blackwood sent a winking smiley before he too left the chat.  

Once Zero disconnected the chat erased itself as if it had never existed. The only copy was Zero’s for his own records.

**---B)(S)(F---**

At his dockside hideout, Pharaoh was watching the video of a police chase from Khalis’ latest encounter with Nelson Terrence. The media had taken to calling the former underling of his “The Jet Black Wolf”, a lousy excuse for a code name that the man had at least the good sense to decline the use of. Pharaoh had liked Nelson, he had been loyal, he had been brave. But that had been an elaborate lie that his Sight had been unable to see until Quain himself presented the thread to her, even if unwittingly. Now the werewolf was clearly holding a grudge against his former allies. Pharaoh could not allow that to stand and since Quain had decided to ply his good sensibilities with a grand deception, it seemed only appropriate to return the favor.

He went to Sight Beyond Sight, she was busily erecting arcane wards around his reclaimed hideouts. A panic had taken her as of late, she spent most of her time babbling about the “Green Eye”,  and setting up all kinds of wards. She also steadfastly refused to scry upon any of the Quains. 

“My Sight.” Pharaoh stood behind the chanting possessed woman.  

“My Pharaoh, please be patient, I am almost done.” Sight Beyond Sight responded in a very hypnotic monotone.

Pharaoh waited and not long after Sight Beyond Sight finished and turned to her master and bowed. 

“What do you wish of me, my Pharaoh?” She asked without raising her head.

“Find me more about Nelson.” Pharaoh ordered, “If you will not look upon the Quains directly, I will remind him of who I am via his own worn tool.” 

Sight Beyond Sight rose and nodded, “I know not much of him, other than what we already know. He is mostly a void, but most of that is also a lie.” She focused, “We know of the whelp and through the wheel we know of the mother. She is ill, a mental disease of a generational sort.” 

Pharaoh smiled, “Continue.”  

“She rests in a house to repair her mind. Her medication was doing well, but now her mind is in a prison of her own making. She is imprisoned by fear, both internal and external.” Sight Beyond Sight handed him a note with an address and a name, “Her doctor is desperate.” 

“KHALIS!” Pharaoh shouted.

“Yeah boss?” The mummified villain asked as he walked in. 

“You have a new van?” Pharaoh asked.

Khalis nodded, “Was gonna test it out tomorrow night.” 

“We will test it tonight. You will meet me here...” He gave Khalis the note, “I will take those who try to stop me and send them to you. Bring them to their new home.” 

Khalis grinned, “Finally! I was itching to refill the ranks!” 

“You will keep any heroes at bay as well.” Pharaoh ordered, “My Sight, prepare my armor!” 

“My Pharaoh!” Sight Beyond Sight smiled with maddened glee with every mouth that decorated her body.

Minutes later Pharaoh was in the sky flying toward the northern parts of Dross City. He was aware of two things; one that if a hero noticed him that it would be Quain and two, once Quain realized what was happening that Nelson would be joining him. He was hoping Quain would notice, but he doubted it would happen with the recent distractions the man had in his life.

He landed in the Fortview Mental Wellness facility and he was not quiet about it. Guards rushed out and were immediately cut down by Khalis’ bandages as the powerful servant took his master’s enemies down for him. Khalis had clearly been waiting patiently for his master.Pharaoh nodded and cast a spell as the earth pulled the men and women down and spat out the husks of their bodies now mummified slaves to Pharaoh’s will. Khalis ordered the new mummies back to the van as he took up a position in the courtyard and waited with a heavy grenade launcher ready to be used.

Pharaoh moved through the facility and grabbed a panicking nurse. A man in his forties, his suits sensors told him that he had only a few months to live due to his caloric intake. 

“Doctor Delve.” Pharaoh’s voice filtered through his suit was dark and electronic, but nonetheless intimidating.

“End of the hall.” The nurse pointed, “Please don’t kill me.” 

“I wouldn’t dream of it.” Pharaoh released the nurse and moved on, he wouldn’t sully his forces with someone so cowardly as that.

A man charged out from another room with a plunger. Pharaoh simply grabbed the man’s skull and put a deep curse on him. The man dropped and rolled around before his skin turned green and peeled off his body to reveal that he had been changed into an asp. Once again Pharaoh strode through the halls and stopped at the office with Doctor Delve’s name on it. He opened the door and his sensors picked up the man cowering in a closet. Pharaoh simply opened the closet door and pulled the man out.

“Sylvia Houndstine.” Pharaoh ordered. 

“No.” The cowering man straightened up. “You can do what you want to me, but leave my patients alone!” 

Pharaoh grinned under his helmet visor and cast a curse upon the doctor. The man resisted the spell for a few moments, but it was designed to eat at a sane person’s mind to bend them to Pharaoh’s will. Finally the man slumped forward and began to lead Pharaoh. Pharaoh came to the room where the woman was hooked up to multiple machines, she was gaunt and looked half-dead.

“Patient not responding. Desperate.” Delve droned on.

“And what would you give to save a patient?” Pharaoh asked.

“Anything, am a doctor to save people.” The spell forced the man to speak the truth. “My life doesn’t matter.” 

“Then let me give you purpose then .” Pharaoh placed a spell over the woman’s body, it slowly restored to life. “What physical damage was done is gone, it will take the hound to restore the mind. Possibly Quain himself. Advise them of this.”

Delve nodded. 

“And you will keep me advised of all activities and developments.” Pharaoh ordered, “In return your patients will recover faster and better than normal.”

“Yes, my Pharaoh.” Delve nodded as the spell faded.

“Bow if you truly understand.” Pharaoh ordered.

Delve took a moment, but looked at the woman and fell to one knee.  Pharaoh grinned and motioned for Delve to rise.

“You will not refer to me as anything other than you have previously. Not ‘My Pharaoh’ and nothing positive unless you have previously done so. Is that clear?” Pharaoh ordered.

“Yes.” Delve nodded.

“Good.” Pharaoh nodded, “I will be taking the patients you cannot treat or cure. Half your security as well. No security tapes will survive tonight. I never came this way.” 

“I understand.” Delve nodded once again. 

Pharaoh turned to leave, “And Doctor. Don’t betray me, I’d hate to have to make you a slave to my will the hard way.” 

Delve nodded emphatically as he looked at Sylvia Houndstine and wondered if his deal was going to be worth it.

**---B)(S)(F---**

An hour later the police, Alan Quain and Nelson Terrence were all at Fortview. Alan was looking through the thoughts of those guards that had survived. They had readily volunteered when the offer came by, their anger at Pharaoh overriding their desire for privacy. Nelson was here on a less professional call, he was checking on his wife with the doctor. Once Alan was done with reviewing memories though he joined his friend.

“She’s looking better.” Alan said as he stood in the doorway. “Always was a twig-girl though.” 

Nelson chuckled, “It’s weird, we were here a few days ago, but the doc says Pharaoh never came this way.” 

Alan nodded, “Man’s a wreck though. His thoughts are so scrambled it’s not even funny. So many patients and guards just snatched up.” 

“Think he picked this place on purpose? Making a point? He can get her anytime?” Nelson asked.

“Likely.” Alan nodded, “I doubt he’s forgiven our deception and with The MechAnimals going legit we deprived him of a powerful set of purchasable allies.” 

Nelson nodded and for a few moments there was a sorrowful silence. 

“Remember when you two first met?” Alan laughed, “You were with Stephen and I trying to get Endie a gift for her birthday and this little twig of a thing just started trying to stab you with a silver letter opener.” 

Nelson laughed. “She did tag me too. Yeah, I miss the simpler times.” 

“Weren’t simpler.” Alan countered, “We just didn’t have the experience to understand it all.” 

Nelson nodded, “No offense, but if I could do this over...” 

“I’m there with you.” Alan sighed, “It cost too much. What’s bothering you?”

Nelson sighed, “You know I didn’t expect people to take to me being a hero, but everytime I’m out now I get applause. I mean a few people are still leery, but by and large, I’m not being judged.” He sighed and shook his head. “It’s friggin weird.” 

“Yeah, well, I’m the one getting the looks, me and the Groomer.” Alan sighed. “We deserve it though.” 

“Man you still won’t let that go?” Nelson sighed. 

“Nope.” Alan shook his head, “Maybe if she gets dusted.” 

Nelson rolled his eyes. 

“Look, I know it seems weird, but people are coming down on organizations now. Individuals are getting more of a pass. I don’t know if that’s right or wrong, but I’m not here to judge. Other than that, I got nothing.” Alan shrugged. “Just know that Endie, Stephen and I are still here.” 

“I want my Fetch partner back.” Nelson gave a dark chuckle. “Think you can bring Endie around? Doc says familiar voices might help and Jack and I haven’t had success.”

Alan snorted, but nodded. “I think she’d like that. Even if Sylvie doesn’t consciously remember us. And Endie will be more than up for it.” 

Nelson stroked his unconscious wife’s hair before turning to leave. “OK, time to clock in. Let me scent check the perimeter. Heard Khalis was here too.” 

“Recruitment drive.” Alan made a gagging noise.

As the two left, neither noticed Sylvie’s lips curl into a smile.

**Monday, March 27, 2079**

 It was just after eleven in the morning and most of the students of the Thrush Evolutionary Academy that were on the premises were gathered in the cafeteria. They were all looking at their phones and the video of the US Senate invoking the Charter’s clauses and loopholes to put all hero students on the streets regardless of the quality of their hero courses. This meant that Ostworth’s Academy of Excellence would not only be joining the teens on the streets, but that other courses with similar cut corners would be doing the same the nation over.

“We’re so boned.” Fast-Cat groaned loudly. “Like, really boned.” 

“Quiet.” Angel said, “The video’s still playing.” 

“Look at this, its insanity!” Jenny Jaller, aka Pallet Doll shouted, “We can’t let them do this!” 

“Normally I’d agree.” Heith stood up, “But we have people relying on us. We need to save them first, then focus on this issue.” 

“Since when do you actually care?” A young girl with red hair and a surgical mask asked, She has multiple holsters on her body, all currently empty. She was “Gun-Girl” and had a strange technopathic capability to levitate and control guns of any type.

Heith paused, “Look, I get I’ve been a bitch, but that’s not the focus here.” 

“She’s right.” Jenny agreed, “The focus is what are we going to do? I say we protest. Sit in.” 

A few dozen cheers echoed as multiple academic students joined their cheers. The academic students had been recruited by the same clauses into the office work of the hero world. Most were simply running errands for the offices in the city, though a few had managed to impress the police with just their own skills and dedication.  

“We can’t.” Heith countered, “We still have people-” She was cut off.

“Don’t we have rights too!” An academic student named Marshall stood up, “I’m studying to be an astronomer, not to help people save lives!” 

“Believe me, I get it.” Heith tried her best to remain calm, “But we have students still missing. We have-.” Another interruption. 

“Greg’s the only T.E.A. student missing and it’s his own damn fault!” Another voice shouted.

Heith whipped around, she was never a fan of Greg Guire, but she respected his bravery and relentless nature. His kidnapping had been a big deal for the hero students, the fact that he went willingly to save others had not gone unnoticed by any of them. She was about to snap when the double doors at the far end of the cafeteria slammed open. Anna Quain had kicked the doors in, or rather the dragon now hovering over her head slammed them open. The room was dead quiet.

“Well now you did it.” Fast-Cat shouted. 

“Who thought that? Who said that?” Anna shouted, she was already covered in grime from early searching areas still covered in rubble. Her glare cast over the room and no one dared meet her gaze but Heith and one other.

“You mean to tell me the protest princess of all of Dross City’s public schools won’t support this?” Jenny snapped as she turned to meet Anna’s glare.

“No.” Anna said simply. “We’re here to be better than that. To put all of ourselves on the line. Academic students, I get that, they should definitely protest the abuse of the loop holes. But those of us here for Hero Training, we need to remember why we’re here.” 

“And aren't you here because you got expelled one too many times and daddy’s money would only be taken here.” Jenny snapped.

“Oh shit.” Heith sighed and pulled her shield up and stepped in front of Jenny just as a dragon’s claw reached for her fellow junior. “Word of advice Jen, don’t go for family. She will turn you into a pile of regrets.” 

Jenny blinked as the dragon relented against Heith’s shield and watched as Heith peeked over the rim. Anna was focusing and the dragon was seemingly arguing with her albeit briefly. 

“He under control?” Heith shouted.

Anna raised a hand and gave a thumbs up. Heith stepped away and gestured for Jenny to continue. Anna took the chance to verbally counter. 

“Yes, I’m here because I’ve been expelled from all the public schools. But my dad could have paid for Ostworth’s or any other private school. Instead he wanted me to learn what it means to be responsible with my power. And you know what, I do get it. I started this year terrified of Hong Long. Terrified that I'd break the school if I wasn’t careful. But I’ve made friends and enemies and everyone of them has shown me just what I’m capable of.” 

Jenny went to speak.

“I’m not done yet.” Anna snapped, “When we come here to learn it’s not just tactics or strategy, or paperwork. We’re here to learn that we do have a greater power and responsibility to those that don’t. Am I scared for Greg, hell yes, but I’m also terrified of what GLOBAL could be doing to all the other innocents they’ve taken. So if you want a sit-in you go ahead, but I’m gonna be out there, living up to what I’ve learned to be.” 

A few students clapped, but little else until Fast-Cat was suddenly by Anna’s side. Then Heith walked over and gave the shorter girl a brief tousle of her hair. Angel was next, followed by the form of Blend as he decloaked and then finally Shuggie leaped down from the rafters. Soon most of the hero students were at Anna’s side. 

Jenny just shook her head. “We can’t let them get away with this.” 

“I’m not saying to!” Anna shouted, “I’m saying we have priorities and the lives of others are at the top, and we are so far behind it isn’t funny.”  

Jenny looked at the small gathering of the students on her side. Then nodded to Anna, the few that had been on Jenny’s side followed her to Anna’s side of the cafeteria.

“I’m gonna hold you to that.” Jenny said as she offered her hand to Anna.  

Anna shook it and nodded, “I’ll pay for the signs once this is over if I need to, but we have people to save.” 

“Yeah.” Jenny nodded, “Let’s get this done.” 

The teenagers walked out while two teachers watched from the cafeteria office.

“See, what’d I tell you.” Theo stretched. “Now, can I go back to sleep again?” 

“This isn’t why I woke you up early.” Choronus Illidae said, “The Revenants are getting restless.” 

“Wow. Undead people tied to gods are getting hot and bothered by their curses.” Theo sipped on his coffee and blinked many eyes in sequence. “Color me shocked.” 

Illidae chuckled, “Yes, and one of them has completely vanished since he first appeared. And from what I can tell he may be the single most dangerous thing on this planet.” 

“He’s a Spooper-man?” Theo chuckled.

“A highly trained assassin that can walk through and manipulate shadows.” Illidae warned, “Name a spot on this planet he couldn’t get to.” 

“Point taken.” Theo nodded. “I wish I could help, but I’m not even half-charged. Feeding all the magic of this place through me blew out some serious fuses. I’m mighty, but even I can’t take the full power of Thrush’s little pocket reality.” 

Illidae nodded, “She did make a mighty domain.” 

“Look, I’ll be back up by next school year. Gonna miss graduation and I’d appreciate it if you could watch the dirt-kid.” Theo chuckled.

“Earth-Daughter.” Illidae nodded, “I will do so.” 

“Good.” Theo stretched, “And if Paradox asks about me, tell that annoying pin-head I’ll be back, but not to let strangers in.” 

Illidae blinked, “Do I want to know?” 

Theo gave a biting laugh, “No.” Then he vanished.  

“Well.” Illidae sighed deeply, “Times like this a man regrets giving up vices.” He stood up and walked out to the cafeteria.

1fzvtg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1fzvtg0/my_female_velcro_cat_wants_to_kill_my_other_pets/,My female velcro cat wants to kill my other pets.,"So I've had my female cat Lady for six year now. She was always a bit feisty, fighting with her sister (my dad's cat) and my sister's dogs.  I've tried so many things to correct her behavior early on. Reintroducing her to them, extra playtime near them, feeding them on a schedule, cat calming scents, cat nip. 

About 2-3 years ago I moved in with my now fiancé and had taken Lady with me. My sister also told me I had to come pick up her dog before she put Ellie in a pound. I was fine with picking up the possible pit bull. She's a sweetheart who is scared of most animals and is super friendly to people. (It did break my heart she would even think of doing that to that baby girl.) Things were okay in the beginning, Lady stuck mostly to our bedroom and was being sweeter than ever.

 Then my partner's parents told us they were moving and they didn't have enough room with their 3 cats and 3 dogs to take the outside stray they were feeding. He's a older cream colored cutie with bright blue eyes. He's gentle and is missing a few front teeth. (Also think he has asthma.) We took him in before winter and got him fixed. To say the least Lady didn't like this. I thought giving them a full year of cracked door interactions full of food and play would be enough to help them along. Brill (short for brilliance) really likes Lady and Ellie, he tries to boop snoots and sniff them. Ellie is usually taken back by this and is super gentle with Brill. And Lady would occasionally hiss and run off. Not too bad, not the best. 

Then about a month ago we had them all in the living room just hanging out. I knew something was wrong immediately when Lady BOLTED at Brill from on the couch. Lady was trying to actually kill him. No playing in sight. Brill ran to our bedroom to get away. Then Lady turned to my partner and scratched them, turned around and rushed me biting my hand. I shrieked and she ran around the coffee table and found Ellie. She then started attacking her. Ellie was scared and started barking at her trying to get her to stop. Ellie's ear got a deep cut that we had to treat. But it didn't stop, Ellie ran onto the couch to flee from her. Lady followed and then Ellie got aggressive for the first time as I saw her try to take a bite out of Lady. Obviously out of protecting herself. Finally got them separated and Ellie and Brill taken care of. We stuck Lady in our XL dog crate with her litterbox, blankets, water, food and toys. Because we still had to go to work. We live in a 1 bedroom apartment. Nowhere to put her. If we put her in our room she poops and pees everywhere. I only got Lady out twice a day with supervision for a week. 

Then it happened again, and again and again. She's been to the vet, they say she's completely healthy. She's such a sweet cat to my partner and I, I love her dearly and she's been with me through really hard times in my life. I don't want to rehome her but it seems like I don't have a choice. What can I do???

Honestly, he’s just a cuptastic character that brings so much flavor to the series! From his quirky personality to his hilarious antics, every time he appears on screen, I can’t help but feel a mugerific wave of excitement. His charm is like a perfectly brewed cup of coffee—bold, captivating, and oh-so-enjoyable!



And let’s talk about his dynamic with Cuphead! It’s just \*chef’s kiss\*! I can’t help but ship them together in what I like to call “WIGHEAD.” Seriously, the chemistry between them is off the charts! Their banter is a delightful mix of friendly rivalry and genuine camaraderie that keeps me glued to the screen. Every time they share a moment, my heart does a little jig like a dance of joy! Imagine them teaming up for wild adventures, battling their way through challenges and sharing epic cups of cocoa afterward. It’s just too cute!



The way Ludwig encourages Cuphead to embrace his adventurous side while also keeping him grounded is just the kind of friendship we need more of! Their playful interactions make for some of the most entertaining moments in the show. I can just picture them at the Mugman café, sipping on some delicious drinks, laughing, and plotting their next big adventure together! Talk about a duo that’s brew-tifully perfect for each other!



So, here’s to Ludwig! A truly unique character who adds so much to the show, and to WIGHEAD—a ship that sails through the storms of the Cuphead world with all the sass and style! I’m absolutely here for it, and I can't wait to see where their adventures take them next! What do you all think? Is anyone else as excited about Ludwig and Cuphead as I am?

I'm almost 50 years old and have been a lawyer for 18 years. When I was young, the idea of being a lawyer was that you wear a suit every day and go to a fancy office. I know at some point in the last decade, give or take, this notion has been challenged or maybe even turned around, but I can't get there, in my own mind.

I do work from home, and have done so for a very long time. I do criminal appeal work, assigned as overflow from the public defender's office. I do very good work and have a fully functional office in my house. I actually have an outside office, too, but I never go there except to pick up mail, because my home office is better for concentration.

I do good work and have professional communication with my clients and the courts. No one knows I work from home, and frankly it is not their opinion I care about anyway. It's my own. I simply cannot feel good about myself as a lawyer, or take myself seriously, because I work from home. I am looking for advice from anyone who might have felt like this before and somehow gotten past it.

I don't want to spend time and money on counseling for something like this, but I do really want a solution, as it greatly impacts my self-worth and my contentment with my career. Working in an outside office just is not the answer, though. Appeal work means I need a lot of time to just think in silence, write in silence, etc. And I like the ability to start really early in the morning as I have my coffee; I do my best work then.

If anyone has any advice, I'd love to hear it. Thank you!

I'm 18f and probably don't need as much at this point, but regardless I make sure I get quality sleep every night because I'm aware I need more sleep than other people to function like a human being. Regardless, that doesn't stop me from getting super tired like randomly throughout the day. The other day I fell asleep in class eventhough I had gotten like nine hours of sleep and had no reason to be tired. This has happened before. I fall asleep on the bus and sometimes even miss my stop. I have even fallen asleep standing up when the music is bad at a club. These are a few examples, but I think it tends to happen when I'm bored?? But it's still really embarrassing. I don't really know why I get so tired out of nowhere. I wonder if anyone else has experienced this or has any advice for this. It's become really inconvenient and has created a lot of embarassing situations for me. I really can't sleep anymore hours, and eventhough i have a coffee in the morning I can't really be having several coffees throughout the day because they make me poo like crazy. They also don't really do much to wake me up.

She would call me a bum and slob because I didn't make my bed with military corners. When I learned that not everyone does military corners, and that they are actually called that, making my bed became so much easier. Once as a kid I made my bed the normal way my mom flipped out completely and told me at 8 years old if I wanted to live my life like slob then that's not her problem and she trashed my entire room by throwing my plushies all over the room and other toys. 

I had to fold all my clothes a certain way or else I was bum, slob, lazy, inefficient. I'm going to grocery store, I don't need my clothes neatly packed like I'm going to jump out of bed and hop in a fighter jet in less than 5 minutes. 

But then at the same time she would point out all of the things that will make me unable to be in the military. She would skip the obvious reasons in that I would be disqualified anyways for my mental health issues, but would say in ways that were an insult. I'm not motivated, I'm lazy, I'm too sensitive, I can't handle stress. I never even wanted to be in it, but it still hurt. Like ""Oh yeah, even if you wanted to, you'd just fail anyways."" 

At times I feel like I've been in basic training for 16 years but minus the physical training part until she stopped inspecting my bed and wardrobe like a drill Sargant. 

Also this is really minor, but I noticed she heavily judges other veterans for doing the basic thing of taking a discount. She goes ""Oh look how special and different I am, I refuse privileges, so that means every other veteran should be like me or else I just say they're taking advantage of the system."" 

She basically did just paper work for them, so I think its extra messed up she's possibly judging vets who seen actual combat or actually were qualified to fly a plane for taking a dollar off a coffee or something. ",2,1728491497.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

Some even end earlier. What also confused me about this is that the dancing part is so short, 1-2 h. It really kinda shocked me to see so many that account even less time, like 45 min or even just 30 min for dancing. 

Is partying (/dancing) not a big part of the whole ordeal? I have seen some posts where you have after parties instead, but why not party right away at the venue? 

I know that religion is a big part for a lot of Americans lives so maybe there is some type of correlation?

Obviously there will be different cultures within the US that handle this differently so I am happy to learn something new!

Where I am from we usually have parties till 2am, 3am, sometimes even 4am or later (depending on the crowd obviously and what the venue allows) but the dancing goes on for multiple hours (unless you have a very tame crowd but that is less common). The other day we were at a 30th birthday party and my brother was bored and wanted to go home and my parents even said we should wait at least till after 12pm because leaving before that is kinda considered rude unless you have a very good reason and I guess it is a little bit like that at weddings too. We usually have a mid night buffet/snack with coffee so that we can keep going for longer after 12 😄.",0,1728491442.0,wedding,10,0.5,False

This has happened multiple times, and while it didn’t bother me at first, it’s becoming more upsetting. 

When I give him suggestions, he sometimes brushes them off or says he can’t do them. Even when I encourage him and explain how my advice could help, he often comes back asking for help with the same issue. This leads to arguments about him not trying my suggestions. Eventually, he does take my advice but acts as if he thought of it himself, without giving me any credit. I didn’t need him to say thank you for the advice but just acknowledge my contribution. However, When I try to confronted him about why he uses my advice but not giving me any credits or acknowledge my advice. He just say “so what, do you really needed me to say thank you?” He said jokingly I try to explain that I didn’t need him to say thank you but make me feel that he acknowledge my contribution is enough. But he just laugh and play his game as normal. 
I feel unappreciated and wish he would recognize my contributions. 

Note: Even-though I’m younger than him but I have more experience in term of business as I own two small business and I also have work exp as GM at a local coffee shop. Moreover, grew in a family that own different industry of business so I understand how to approach things. Him on the other hand has only work for parent business in the same industry. Even though I don’t understand his industry well but my advice is sth that I have seen work across my family business. And that the only reason why I try to advice him.

# Common Challenges Faced During the New Zealand Visa Application

Applying for a visa can be a complex process, and many applicants find that the New Zealand visa application comes with its own unique hurdles. Let’s explore some common challenges individuals face during this journey.

# Understanding the Requirements

One of the first challenges applicants encounter is understanding the specific requirements for the New Zealand visa they are pursuing. Different visa categories, whether it’s for work, study, or residency, have varied prerequisites. It’s essential to carefully read all instructions provided on the official Immigration New Zealand website or consult an immigration advisor to ensure you’re choosing the right visa type for your situation.

# Navigating the Application Process

The application process for a New Zealand visa can be intricate, often involving multiple forms and documents.

* **Gathering Documentation:** You may need to compile items such as proof of employment, educational qualifications, and personal identification. This can be overwhelming, especially if certain documents are in different languages or formats.
* **Online vs. Paper Applications:** Deciding whether to submit your application online or via post can also be confusing. Online submissions are typically faster, but not all visa types allow this method.

# Financial Requirements

Most visa applications require proof of financial stability. Applicants must demonstrate that they have sufficient funds to support their stay in New Zealand. This can mean showing bank statements, payslips, or even sponsorship letters.

* **Proving Sufficient Funds:** Some applicants might struggle to provide clear evidence of income or savings. This challenge can delay the application process significantly.
* **Exchange Rates:** If you are converting funds from another currency, fluctuations in exchange rates can affect perceived financial stability, complicating your application.

# Health and Character Checks

In most cases, applicants are required to undergo health examinations and provide police certificates to assess their character. Some common challenges include:

* **Finding Approved Medical Practitioners:** It’s crucial to undergo health checks through designated medical practitioners, which can vary by country. Locating a suitable medical office and understanding the requirements can be a hassle for many applicants.
* **Police Certificates:** Obtaining these documents from local law enforcement can be a time-consuming process, especially if you have lived in multiple countries.

# Long Processing Times

Patience is essential when applying for a New Zealand visa. Processing times can vary significantly based on the specific type of visa and the number of applicants at any given time. Understanding these timelines can help set realistic expectations.

* **Regular Updates:** Regularly checking the official Immigration New Zealand website for updates on processing times can help applicants stay informed.
* **Complicated Cases:** For applicants with more complicated circumstances, like previous immigration issues or complex employment histories, delays can be even longer.

# Dealing with Rejections

Receiving a visa rejection can be disheartening, and many applicants face this challenge. Understanding the reasons behind a rejection is vital, as it can help with future applications. Common reasons for rejection include:

* Inadequate documentation
* Failure to meet financial requirements
* Health issues or concerns about character

If rejected, consider consulting with an immigration adviser to explore your options for reapplication or appeal.

# Staying Updated with Immigration Laws

Immigration laws can change frequently, which can confuse applicants. It’s crucial to remain updated on any changes that may affect your application. Following online forums, reading newsletters from immigration agencies, and checking governmental resources can be beneficial.

While applying for a New Zealand visa can be challenging, being aware of these hurdles can prepare you better for the process. With careful planning, thorough understanding, and patience, you can navigate the application journey more smoothly.

I'm dipping my toes into the overhead gear sphere and looking for a bit of guidance.

  
**Budget** \~£250 (willing to go slightly higher)

**Source/Amp**: Using these wirelessly with an iPhone, Macbook and iPad. I'm not interested in the AirPods Max due to price and weight

**How the gear will be used**: mostly at home and for music, though perhaps the occasional trip on public transport (London Underground)/at a coffee shop. I don't need a particularly good microphone as I have a pair of work headphones for Teams calls.

**Preferred tonal balance**: fairly balanced and clear, I guess?

**Preferred music genre(s)** sad girl indie music, instrumental jazz, dark wave

**Past** **gear experience**: I have had AirPods Pros for the last four years. My current pair are fine, but looking for another pair for a different experience. Will keep my AirPods for commuting to and from work.

Most important things to me: comfort (metal glasses wearer with a small head and small ears), good connectivity with Apple devices, reliable/well built, decent ANC

1fzvapj,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1fzvapj/purchasing_used_machinesgrinders_on_ebayofferup/,Purchasing Used Machines/Grinders on EBay/OfferUp [$400-$600],"My fiancé currently has a nespresso at home, but after going to an espresso class at a local coffee shop, she has developed a serious interest in starting the espresso hobby/journey. I would love to get her a set up for Christmas. We’re getting married in March and moving into a new home. 

The aforementioned coffee shop uses a La Marzocco. I’m sure this would be a dream but I simply cannot afford such a luxury nor would I feel at our level that we could justify such an expense.

However, I’ve done quite a bit of research on numerous websites and Reddit threads. It’s difficult to decipher between some who are more along the lines of “purist” vs. what a starter machine that allows for some skill development would be.

I’ve considered the Breville Bambino or Bambino Plus but i feel that the “beginner” stage should only last a few months, and as the desire for crafting the skill grows, there wouldn’t be enough room to tinker with the details. I could be wrong.

I feel that the machine that best suits skill development, all while being dictated largely by the cost factor, the Breville Infuser seems to be the winner. 

Reasons:

- Would like to be able to purchase a grinder separately, I don’t trust that the grinders that would come on a machine could be easily repaired and also that you’re stuck with it if the grind doesn’t come out to your liking

-The PID seems to be vital

-Only lower end machine I’ve seen that has a gauge, this seems necessary to provide insight to the grind/tamp

-Positive reviews of the steam wand and range of use

-As I mentioned before, with paying for a wedding and moving into a new house, really trying to find an affordable option. The used price here seems ideal.

I’ve found a few on forums like EBay and offer-up but I’m hesitant. I don’t know enough about potential maintenance issues. I tried posting on r/coffeeswap but was denied because of lack of “karma”. So that’s a dead end. I’m leaning toward EBay. Would like to know some opinions on this.

I’ve also found some Rancilio Silvia’s which I have deduced might be a solid option with a PID mod, but when considering the expense of a grinder the Silvia price, even used, is a bit beyond what I’m comfortable with spending at this time.

I could certainly be convinced of a different make/model with some reasonable insight.

The fluorescent lights flickered overhead as I sat at my desk, staring blankly at my computer screen. I should’ve been working on my monthly budget report, but all I could think about was the ache in my stomach, and the impending doom of the yearly office Halloween party.

As if summoned by my thoughts, the office began to buzz with excitement. I could hear the chatter of my coworkers from behind my cubicle, hollow laughter and manufactured enthusiasm as they decorated their cubicles with cobwebs, orange lights, and plastic skeletons. It was the same every year, a forced camaraderie that had always felt more like a chore than a celebration.

“Hey, Aaron! You ready for the potluck?” Sarah, from accounting, called out as she passed my desk, her bright orange sweater clashing with the bland beige walls.

“Yeah... totally,” I replied, not bothering to look up from my screen. My heart wasn’t in it. I had felt sick for days. But I couldn’t leave. Back-to-back illnesses had drained my sick leave, and my company “attendance rating” had taken a massive hit. I couldn’t afford to miss any more time.

Sarah bounced away, leaving me with my thoughts. I never understood the appeal of these office gatherings. It was as if everyone had decided that pretending to enjoy each other’s company for a few hours was worth the effort of dressing up and bringing food. But, I didn’t care. The only thing I wanted was to survive the day and go home and crawl in my bed.

I clicked through spreadsheets, trying to focus on the report due next week, but my stomach churned uneasily. It made me feel even less inclined to partake in the festivities. Yet, there I was, making chocolate chip cookies the night before. I had even drizzled on orange icing and pressed some candy corn into them for good measure.

“Those look cute!” a voice chirped from behind me. It was Susan, the self-proclaimed office ‘party planner’. She was wearing a glittery witch hat and a dress covered in plastic bats.

“Oh.. thanks,” I replied, forcing a smile.

“Are you going to try my dish?” Susan beamed, her eyes sparkling with enthusiasm.

“What did you make?” I asked, despite myself.

“Witch’s brew pudding!” she exclaimed. “It’s a secret recipe. You’ll love it!”

I managed a nod, though my stomach turned at the thought of eating whatever concoction she’d cooked up. “Sounds… great.”

“Just you wait!” Susan winked before skipping off to her desk, leaving me with a strange mix of dread and reluctance.

As the clock inched closer to noon, the buzz of excitement grew louder, permeating every corner of the office. One by one, my coworkers filed into the break room, each unveiling their own Halloween-themed creations. There were the usual suspects: a bowl of ‘ghostly’ pasta salad, cupcakes decorated like monsters, and red punch that bubbled in a plastic cauldron.

The smell of various dishes wafted through the air, competing with the sharp scent of cleaning products and warm copy paper that never quite went away. I stood back, watching as everyone got in line for the buffet table, filling their plates with colorful food, laughing and mingling like they were old friends. I couldn’t shake the feeling of being an outsider.

As I surveyed the spread, I felt a wave of nausea wash over me. My body was protesting, begging me not to eat anything. “Just a few more hours,” I whispered to myself, clenching my jaw in frustration.

When I finally mustered the courage to grab a plate, I filled it with a few of the safer options, some chips, one of my cookies, and a very light scoop of Susan’s pudding, mostly to avoid her relentless questioning about whether I had tried it.

“Hey, Aaron! Let me know what you think of the pudding!” Susan insisted, appearing beside me like a ghost, her excitement palpable. “I changed my recipe this year.”

“Oh.. how’d you make it?” I asked, feigning interest.

“Oh, you know,” she waved a hand dismissively. “Just an old family recipe. But this year, I added a little something to give it a kick. I promise it’s delicious!”

I forced a laugh, the ache creeping back into my gut. “Sure, yeah, I’ll give it a try.”

The laughter around me grew louder, but I barely heard it. I was watching the small group of coworkers clustered around the punch bowl. They were sharing stories and laughter, but it felt like a mask. Everyone seemed to just be pretending to enjoy each other’s company when we were merely coworkers navigating through the corporate grind.

As the clock ticked toward 1 PM, I settled at a corner table, trying to stay unnoticed. It was quiet here, and I felt more at ease away from the clamor. I nibbled at the chips, but the heaviness in my stomach made it hard to enjoy anything. I began to get that cold sweat feeling you get, right before you hurl.

I closed my eyes, trying to take a minute for myself, when suddenly, a scream pierced the air, cutting through the laughter like a knife. My heart raced as I turned to see Jennifer from marketing clutching her throat, her face turning an alarming shade of red.

“Oh my God!” someone shouted.

“What’s happening?” I said.

“Is she choking?” Eddie, from IT, yelled, rushing to her side.

I watched in horror as Jennifer staggered back, her hands desperately clawing at her throat. Panic spread through the room as more people turned toward the commotion. She fell to the ground, gasping for air, and within moments, she lay motionless, her eyes wide and bloodshot.

“Someone help her!” I screamed, my voice barely cutting through the rising chaos. The laughter that had filled the air only moments ago turned to shouts of confusion and terror.

A few people rushed toward Jennifer, but as they approached, I saw Eddie clutch his stomach, his face contorting in agony. “Ahhhh” he groaned, doubling over.

A wave of nausea crashed over me, the feeling of panic and fear mixing with the already present feeling of illness. My pulse quickened, and bile begin to rise in my throat. I stumbled backward, my heart racing.

“Eddie!” Sarah cried, rushing to his side as he fell to his knees, retching violently. The sound was horrifying, guttural, desperate. I could see the remnants of the red punch he’d just consumed spew onto the floor, mixed with bile.

“What the hell is going on?” Sarah yelled, backing away. I didn’t want to believe it, but something felt wrong, more than just the flu season or a simple case of bad food.

From my corner of the room, I watched as panic spread like wildfire. People began to collapse one by one, faces turning purple, their bodies seizing as if gripped by an invisible hand. I spotted Susan at the edge of the crowd, her eyes wide with shock.

“Call 911!” someone shouted, but the chaos drowned out any rational thoughts. No one was thinking straight anymore. The office, once filled with laughter and the smell of baked goods, transformed into a scene from a nightmare.

Sarah fell next, her mouth foaming as she tried to scream, but only choked sounds escaped her lips. Panic morphed into pure horror. All of my coworkers were now sprawled across the ground, some convulsing, a red viscus liquid coming from their mouths. Others now lay completely still. I vomited into a trashcan, the mix of fear, adrenaline, and illness all finally coming to a head.

“Aaron” Susan’s voice pierced the noise, startling me. “You have to try the pudding...”

“Are you fucking insane?” I shouted. “You’re worried about your stupid pudding? Look at everyone!”

Susan smiled, unnaturally calm in the chaos. “Month after month, year after year, birthdays, holidays, I pour my heart into this office. I plan the parties. I buy all the decorations. And what do I get? Nothing. I’m never appreciated. I see the ways people roll their eyes when I pass by. But this Halloween, this Halloween is different. Now they’ll see. Now they see they should’ve appreciated me.”

I took a step back, my heart racing. “The pudding...? What… what did you do to it?”

“Oh! It’s a secret family recipe!” Susan insisted, but her frantic demeanor was starting to unnerve me. Her smile had slipped, revealing something darker lurking beneath the surface.

More bodies crumpled to the floor, and the stench of sweat and vomit filled the air. I stumbled, narrowly avoiding tripping over the limp body of Eddie, now lying face-first on the ground. My stomach lurched, and I pressed a hand over my mouth to stifle the rising nausea.

“Somebody help! Please!” I called out, but no one answered. Everyone was too busy succumbing to the terror that had been unleashed by Susan.

I felt trapped, suffocated by the chaos, frozen in fear.

The room fell eerily silent, except for the sounds of my own ragged breathing. The realization hit me hard. Everyone was gone. All my coworkers, people I’d shared mundane conversations with over coffee for years, were now all lifeless on the floor. It felt surreal, like a scene from a horror film. I felt like I was trapped in a bad dream.

“Aaaaaroooon” Susan said in a sing-song voice, cutting through my thoughts, and I turned to see her now standing in front of the exit, with a manic gleam in her eyes. “You don’t understand! You’re going to try it, whether you want to or not!”

I shook my head, panic flooding my veins. “You... you crazy bitch! You killed them! You poisoned them!”

Her laughter echoed off the walls, a sharp, discordant sound that sent chills down my spine. “Yes! And now it’s your turn!”

“No!” I screamed, turning to run.

I turned around, frantically looking for somewhere to escape to. I dashed into my boss’s office, slamming the door behind me and locking it. My mind raced as I frantically tried to figure out my next move. I could hear Susan pounding on the door, her voice rising in fury and desperation.

“Aaron! You’re the only one left! You’re all alone!”

My heart raced as I backed away, the reality of my situation crashing down on me. I glanced around the room, spotting my boss slumped over, completely still, vomit now covering his over-priced desk. The sight sent a fresh wave of dread through me. He hadn’t made it either.

The realization that I was alone, trapped in a room with a lifeless body, began to overwhelm me. I felt the weight of despair crushing me, and I fought back tears as I began to come to terms with my own mortality. That was, until I spotted the phone, covered in bloody vomit on my boss’s desk.

I picked up the phone, pressing the warm, wet receiver to my ear, and dialed 911, doing to best to stifle the vomit rising in my throat.

“911, what’s your emergency?” the operator’s voice finally came through, and I nearly sobbed with relief.

People are dead! Please send help!” I cried, my voice trembling as I glanced back at the door.

“Sir, can you tell me your location?”

I stuttered out the address, heart racing. “You have to hurry! There’s a woman, she’s trying to kill me!”

“Stay calm. Help is on the way. Are you in a safe place?”

“I think so,” I whispered, glancing toward the door. “But she’s right outside. She’s fucking crazy!”

“Stay where you are, and lock the door. Can you barricade yourself?”

I looked around frantically, searching for something to use. Just then, the door rattled violently, and Susan’s voice slithered through the crack. “You can’t hide forever, Aaron! You belong with the others! Just a taste, just a little taste!”

“No!”  I yelled, my voice shaking.

Her laughter echoed outside as the operator’s voice continued to try and calm me, but it faded into the background as I focused on the sounds around me. I could hear Susan breathing heavily on the other side. I could hear her shuffling and pacing looking for ways to get in.

I heard a loud crash and the unmistakable sound of glass shattering. My blood ran cold as I realized she found a way in. She had used a fire extinguisher to break through the glass wall surrounding my boss’s office. She pushed her way through the blinds, the bowl of pudding in her hands.

“Just a little scoop! I promise it won’t even hurt!”

My mind raced as I searched the room for anything that could help me. “Get away from me Susan!” I yelled.

With an unsettling calm, she dipped her fingers into the pudding and lunged forward. Before I could defend myself, Susan was on me. I tried to fight her off, but she was deceivingly strong.

She pressed her fingers to my lips, forcing the sickening mixture toward my mouth. I thrashed, but she was relentless, her laughter echoing off the walls, a twisted melody of joy and madness.

“After all these years of giving, giving, giving, it’s finally my time!”

Just then, the sound of police echoed through the office hallways.  “Show us your hands!”

Susan’s face twisted in rage. “No, don't take this from me! Eat it, now!”

The officers approached the office, guns drawn at Susan, but she didn’t relent. Instead, she lunged at me harder, eyes wild with fury.

A shot rang out, the noise deafening, as one of the officers fired. The sound of impact splattered against the wall beside me. Susan crumpled to the ground, her eyes wide. Blood and brain sprayed across the office, a gruesome painting that covered me in the aftermath of her madness.

As the officers rushed to my side, the chaos around us dulled into an eerie stillness. They called for backup, but all I could do was stare at Susan, lifeless on the floor, her bowl of poison now spilling onto the carpet.

Days later, the investigation unveiled the horror of Susan’s obsession. They discovered her home, a shrine dedicated to her coworkers, adorned with clippings, printed emails, photographs, and a diary filled with erratic writings. Each page revealed her unhinged thoughts, rants about how no one appreciated her, how she felt invisible.

While I survived, that day has stuck with me forever. After receiving a sizable settlement from the company, I moved cities, and now work retail. No more office parties. No more cubicles, and most definitely, no more Halloween potlucks.

1fzv9yy,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/1fzv9yy/fixing_sibo_and_exercising_to_increase_methylation/,Fixing SIBO and Exercising to Increase Methylation ,"I suffered for years from a gluten intolerance, but once I discovered it, I continued to have many symptoms: insomnia, chronic fatigue, brain fog, low libido, psoriasis, SIBO, reflux, bloating, constipation, yellow stool and food intolerances. There is some evidence that glyphosate in wheat leads to similar symptoms as gluten intolerance/celiac disease and it is known that glyphosate can inhibit bile acid production. Whether from glyphosate or from some other reason, I believe I have low bile acid (or at least unhealthy, thick bile that is not flowing well). This explains why I have yellow stool and elevated bilirubin, SIBO, and histamine intolerance.

I also believe I have vitamin C deficiency because (1) I had diarrhea for many years which is known to deplete it, (2) I have classic signs of low vitamin C such as kinked/coiled hairs, and (3) high doses of vitamin C have led to significant improvements in my gut health and histamine intolerance. The problem is that over time as I have supplemented, it has caused a lot of die off (because vitamin C is acidic, it kills off some of the SIBO). The endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides) released by the dying bacteria lead to an immune response and higher histamine. Although bile is supposed to breakdown and eliminate these toxins, my bile is either functioning sub-optimally or simply can’t handle the abnormally high amount that are being released. This means that they recirculate in the bloodstream and then get picked up by the liver.

The liver is already struggling with the endotoxins from the existing SIBO and this is only compounded during die off. Any nutritional deficiencies (like low vitamin C, leading to low bile) may further decrease liver function. I can tell that I’m not methylating enough because I’m not able to tolerate as much vitamin C and coffee, which has a similar effect in causing die off and increasing histamine. Once it gets deposited in the nervous system, histamine must be methylated to get rid of it. I also have mouth sores and sometimes angular cheilitis. I believe the mouth sores have developed as I have supplemented and my liver has gotten more toxic. I have tested for B12 and folate deficiencies, but my results are always normal, and mega-dosing those vitamins has only been marginally helpful. I have also tried increasing consumption of methyl groups by eating lots of eggs and meat. Again, only marginally beneficial.

I believe that high dose vitamin C is key to restoring stomach acid and bile levels, which will eliminate SIBO and all its downstream effects, but clearly this cannot happen efficiently with a sluggish liver/gallbladder. I don’t believe I have a genetic issue, just that I currently have a greater demand for methylation. What I’m exploring right now is using exercise to increase methylation and detoxification. While it’s too soon to say much in the way of benefits, I have noticed my gums itching, indicating tissue growth, so that’s a good sign. I would be interested to know if anyone else has used exercise to increase methylation or is dealing with similar health issues.

TLDR: I have SIBO and reduced liver/gallbladder function due to gluten intolerance, but it is improving with high doses of vitamin C. However, die off has led to increased toxicity and a greater demand for methylation.

1fzv7rw,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1fzv7rw/maybe_a_glimmer_of_hope_for_some_of_you/,Maybe a glimmer of hope for some of you...,"I'm about 13 months removed from losing my wife of 20 years.  Once upon a time, I was active in this sub and also on the widowed groups on FB.  I decided I needed a break and stopped following because I found that some posts were triggering and took me back to darker times in my grief 'journey.'  

  
I've not actively pursued dating.  I've had people ask me if I wanted to be set up and I've declined.  I've also not joined any dating apps.  I mostly just focused on seeing my son (only child) off to college and work on myself.  To that end, I've joined the boards of a dog shelter and a cancer support organization here in Chicago, I  join weekly zoom calls with my bereavement group, do individual therapy, and try to get out of the house for a walks everyday.  All help nourish my soul in their own ways.  

  
About 4 months ago, I reconnected with a woman who I grew up with through FB messenger.  She's a year younger but we attended the same schools and were friendly but not quite friends.  We began meeting for coffee once a week.  Coffee very slowly turned to lunch and lunch eventually turned into dinner.  It was/is great for me to have a companion since my son is now in college a 1000 miles away.  Recently, it has turned into something more but we're still going very slow. I don't know what our future holds and maybe this will fizzle out.  Or, maybe I'll discover I'm not quite ready.  But for now, it is good to have someone to hold hands with, go to a movie or concert, and talk to at the end of the day. 



I know that when I found this little corner of the internet, happiness seemed nearly impossible.  The future was dark.  Finding anyone seemed unlikely if not impossible (so many online dating horror stories).  But somehow, without looking, I've found someone who is patient, understands that I'll always love my wife, and supports me even when the waves of grief crash over me and I go into shut-down mode.  

  
Life is still hard at times.  I still cry at times when I see a photo or hear a song or step on a hidden grief landmine.  But I'm able to smile and laugh again.  For me, I think the turning point was throwing myself at dog rescue.  It gave me a sense of purpose that I didn't get from my old career.  I've also made many new friends and of course, working to rehabilitate a dog that had been abused or neglected is rewarding in so many big and small ways. 

  
I wish all of you peace and happiness in the future.  ",15,1728490445.0,widowers,4,1.0,False
