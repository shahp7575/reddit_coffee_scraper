1htn4ag,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1htn4ag/can_athome_whitening_really_brighten_your_smile/,Can At-Home Whitening Really Brighten Your Smile?,"If you’ve ever hesitated to smile because of yellow or stained teeth, you’re not alone. Teeth whitening has become increasingly popular, but not everyone has the time or budget for professional treatments. That’s where at-home whitening kits come in. But do they actually work? I decided to test one myself, and here’s everything I discovered about the process, results, and what you should know before trying it.

# Why I Opted for At-Home Whitening

Professional whitening treatments are effective but expensive. Spending $500 or more to brighten my teeth wasn’t an option, especially when I wasn’t sure how long the results would last. At-home kits promised convenience and affordability, but I wasn’t sure if they could deliver real results without causing sensitivity.

The kit I chose caught my attention because it included a **dentist-formulated whitening gel** and an LED mouthpiece—features that seemed more advanced than the usual strips or toothpaste.

# How It Works

The whitening process was simple and took only 10 minutes a day. Here’s what the kit included:

1. **Whitening Gel**: A specialized formula to tackle both surface stains and deeper discoloration.
2. **LED Mouthpiece**: Enhances the gel’s effectiveness by activating the whitening agents.
3. **Clear Instructions**: Step-by-step guidance on how to use the kit for optimal results.

# My Day-by-Day Journey

Here’s how my experience went over the six-day whitening cycle:

* **Day 1**: After the first session, there wasn’t much change, but my teeth felt cleaner and smoother. The gel was easy to apply, and the LED mouthpiece was comfortable.
* **Day 3**: By the third session, I started seeing visible improvements. The stains from coffee and tea were fading, and my teeth looked slightly brighter.
* **Day 6**: By the final session, my teeth were noticeably whiter—about 6–7 shades lighter. The results looked natural, and there was no patchiness or overly bright areas.

What really stood out was the **lack of sensitivity**. I’ve tried whitening strips before, and they always left my teeth aching afterward. This kit, however, was completely pain-free.

# Why This Kit Stood Out

There are plenty of whitening products on the market, but this kit had a few unique features that set it apart:

1. **Dentist-Formulated Gel**: Unlike over-the-counter options, this gel was designed to be safe for enamel and gentle on gums while effectively lifting stains.
2. **LED Technology**: The LED mouthpiece helped activate the gel, speeding up the whitening process and ensuring even results.
3. **Temperature-Controlled Ingredients**: The gel was stored in controlled conditions to maintain its potency, ensuring maximum effectiveness.

# How It Compares to Other Methods

Over the years, I’ve tried several whitening products. Here’s how this one measures up:

* **Whitening Strips**: While convenient, they often cause uneven results and significant sensitivity.
* **Whitening Toothpaste**: Good for maintenance but not strong enough to remove deep stains.
* **Professional Treatments**: Highly effective but expensive and can leave your teeth sensitive for days.

This kit offered a great balance: professional-level results at an affordable price, with no discomfort.

# Frequently Asked Questions

Here are some common concerns about at-home whitening and what I found during my experience:

1. **Will it damage my enamel?** Not with this kit. The gel was specifically formulated to protect enamel while whitening.
2. **Does it work on deep stains?** Yes, it worked on both surface stains and discoloration caused by coffee, tea, and aging.
3. **How long do the results last?** This depends on your habits. Avoiding staining foods and maintaining good oral hygiene can keep your teeth white for months.

# Tips for the Best Results

If you’re planning to try at-home whitening, here are some tips to get the most out of your experience:

1. **Stick to the Routine**: Consistency is key. Follow the instructions daily for the recommended number of days.
2. **Avoid Staining Foods**: Minimize your intake of coffee, tea, and red wine during the whitening process.
3. **Maintain Good Oral Hygiene**: Brushing and flossing regularly will help preserve your results.

# Final Verdict

At-home teeth whitening can be a game-changer if you choose the right product. This kit delivered noticeable results in just six days, with none of the sensitivity or discomfort I’ve experienced with other products.

While professional treatments are still the most effective option, this kit is an excellent alternative for those looking for a budget-friendly, convenient solution.

There’s always something new—another dripper, a fancy grinder, or the latest innovation promising better brews. It’s easy to feel like you need them all, but honestly, you don’t.

For me, I’ve found joy in keeping my setup minimal. I use a V60, an April brewer, and a French press—just three tools that I’ve spent time getting to know and love. It’s not about what’s “better” or “best”; it’s about what works for me and what helps me focus on brewing (and drinking!) great coffee.

That said, I totally get the appeal of exploring new gear. For some, collecting and experimenting with different brewers is part of the fun. And that’s the beauty of coffee, it’s personal. ☕

How about you? Do you keep things simple with just a couple of go-to brewers, or do you have a whole lineup? ? If you stick to just a few brewers, which ones do you own, and why did you choose them?

If you own several, I’d love to know—what’s in your collection? and how do you decide which brewer to use for each coffee, do you find yourself using some more often than others? 🤔☺️",1,1736021142.0,CoffeePH,0,1.0,False
1htn188,https://www.reddit.com/r/energydrinks/comments/1htn188/sudden_immunity_to_caffeine/,Sudden immunity to caffeine???,"So I just got back from a three week trip in Europe, where I drank a lot less caffeine than I normally do. Back in the states I’m used to having 300 to 400 mg a day but since they don’t have as strong energy drinks in the countries I visited, I was pretty much just having 1 Red Bull or a coffee each day, keeping my numbers pretty low. 

I thought that this would bring my caffeine tolerance down and that when I came home, it would take a lot less to give me energy, but somehow the opposite has happened. I’m drinking whole cans of G fuel with 300 mg of caffeine and feeling absolutely nothing, I’m still exhausted all day. I’ll throw a coffee or something on top and still nothing. I always try not to go over 400 mg a day cause I’m kind of paranoid about safety but I probably had something like 450 today and literally still was able to fall asleep for a nap at like two in the afternoon. 

Does anyone know what the hell is going on? Is this some type of phenomenon when your habits change? Is it unrelated to caffeine and I’m just recovering from a long trip?",1,1736021128.0,energydrinks,0,1.0,False
1htn0yi,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1htn0yi/apparently_fasting_triggers_the_last/,Apparently fasting triggers the Last Chairbenders…and it’s hilarious ,"I just spent 3 weeks with my in laws in another country. I weaned from breastfeeding a week before we went to visit. I breastfed exclusively for 10 months and for the first time in my life found myself overweight and having intense cravings to led to me holding onto the baby weight (gained 60 pounds while pregnant!!) 

Anyways fast forward to the trip. After I weaned my appetite completely disappeared, my body was telling me it was ok to fast because of all the fat stored on me for 9 months of pregnancy and 10 months of nursing.

I did multiple long fasts while I was there, with my longest being a week. I supplemented properly and have experience with fasting.

You’d think I’d killed someone the one my in laws treated me for it, every meal became a stressful event with me, as they would watch me intently and make comments about how I’m too good for their food (when I was nothing but generous and appreciative.) they also made fat jokes about me (I’m overweight 5’6” 180ish pounds) and would say things like I look like the type to eat an entire container of sour cream.

Every time I thanked them for cooking (my baby eats the food) they would say don’t thank us if you aren’t going to eat it. Fine then.

It all came to a head when we set out to hike up a mountain in the snow. We stopped at a cafe. I had broken my 6 days fast the day prior with lots of healthy food and had gone right into my next fast. 

They all ordered huge plates a food and start shoving it down their pie holes. I ordered some food for my daughter and coffee for myself. My FIL starts to berate me saying I won’t make it up the mountain, it’s a long walk so you need to eat something. I just said I would be fine, and everyone at the table was visibly upset with me. 

I went on to have no issues at all hiking for miles uphill, feeling more energetic than ever from the 20+ pounds I’d lost over the past 3 weeks. (Well I don’t weigh myself cuz it’s triggering but you can see a recent progress picture on my page if you’re interested in my current level of hamplanetness although I’ve lost more weight since those few days ago. 

Not to mention that they constantly skinny shame my husband who is naturally thin and tell me I need to feed my daughter more when I literally feed her constantly and ALWAYS make sure she has a full belly.

We had dinner one last time tonight and I was so broken down from the insults and negativity that I pretended to eat my food to satisfy everyone.

I am flying at in the morning which means i don’t have to deal with it anymore

She’s start babbling about how hard it is to find a good job, and how she has a file. (Meaning she has a record) anyway fast forward, the part timer comes and gets me and says that she has a knife. I stand there for a moment processing what he told me. I kid you not, my heart dropped as the part timer explained that she trying to steal also. My manager is on vacation and I don’t have a ASM at the moment. So it’s just me. I gently confronted her and she takes out the items and told me she wasn’t gonna steal them but to buy them. Mind you she told me she didn’t have any money. She LOST HER MIND when I asked her to leave the store. She started threatening and yelling at me. (This 🐕 still has a knife.) there are other people in the store while this is happening. I wanted to give her a chance to just leave and not cause any trouble. The police came and asked me if I wanted her trespassed and I said yes. By the end she left screaming and kicking telling me as gonna come back and harm me. God, I just LOVE that.

This morning I should have taken my bike to do some chores, it was parked in the backyard of my block of flats, which usually is locked and only residents can enter. But I discovered that it was stolen, the fence to which it was locked was cut off.

I called the police but they refused to come on place and do anything and they told me to file a report at the police station. But before going there I decided to take a look at the flea market where sometimes stolen bikes pop out, I didn't find it there. Then I went to the police station to file the report, but the officers didn't give a fuck about my stolen bike: in the beginning they made me wait for hours while they were drinking coffee and laughing in their office, when finally a lady received me she started to literally mock me when I asked her to write down the details of the happened. She said that they will send the police at the place to check everything, but then she said it's just an irony. When I told to write down that most likely the neighbors did steal the bike, she said that it's a heavy blame.

In the end the lady printed, signed and stamped the police report, but I fear that would remain just a piece of paper and my bike will be never retrieved. Probably in my city one can own only a shitty and rusty bike which would cost at most 50 euros, otherwise it will be stolen.

People, how do you manage to own a nice bike and use it securely, without fearing of having it stolen? How do you keep it? And what bike can I get, which will be nice and comfortable, while not so attractive to burglars? Sorry for such a long text story, I'll appreciate any help and suggestions.

Once I’m happy with times and ratios (tipically 18gr coffee to 36 gr of water, in 25 to 30 seconds) I would like to save that volume of coffee on the “2 cups” configuration. 
The problem is that I press the button for 4 seconds as the manual says, it starts to flow and then I stop it manually, so it’s supposed to have saved the configuration on the 2 cups button. 
When I want to do a second coffee, I press the 2 cup button hoping to get the same amount of coffee, but it gives me 40 seconds extraction and around 60 ml of coffee, so I’m guessing it is not saving correctly the previous configuration, and it’s using the original pre-configuration.
This is not an inconvenience for using the machine manually, but I’m worried it’s faulty.
All this is because I don’t want to weight all the times the extracted coffee, I would like to be more automatic.

Anyways below is what I wrote, as well as an update on the opinion of my STBX about our living situation :

Why is my STBX so threatened by my peace ?

First time poster to this sub: Me (33F) and STBX (42M) are headed for divorce. Things have been extremely stressful and rough for the past year and some change, dating back to our failed marriage therapy. To be honest, I should have left then but was on the fence about what I wanted to do following the obvious fork in the road. We have 4 children and over the past year it has become clear as day he has no intentions to work on himself. He lost his job and decided to never get another one again (21 months now without even so much as an application put in.) The reason for his not looking is because he says “his wife left him and cut off all forms of intimacy/sex” when I started going to therapy to heal some of my childhood trauma and traumatic events that happened to me. Fast forward to today, I am still in therapy working on myself and he is not. No job, not in therapy, drinking, and just overall depressed beyond recognition. Meanwhile I am in grad school, working full time and caring for our 4 children.

Oct 2024 I told him I couldn’t take it anymore and we needed to get a divorce. It was not healthy for the kids to be witnessing the relationship dynamic that we had been living in for 1 + year. I know things take time but I needed to be away from him but know neither of us can legally ask one another to leave the house. I asked for some space from him in the bedroom. In October 2024, his idea of space was put a mattress down on the floor in the living room. Mind you, We have an entire in law unit in our home downstairs that isn’t rented or occupied (used as storage.) In early December, I decided it wasn’t enough space so I started moving myself down stairs. I cleaned it up and put a bed, a desk, and a chair down there. End of Dec I filed for divorce. I plan to reside down there and only occupy the main part of the home while caring for the children. This is the plan until we go before the mediator to decide what happens with custody/living arrangements/assets, etc. Well apparently this amount of space between us threatens him. 

Since I have been downstairs he has picked a fight with me over every little thing in regards to me being down there. He has said I’ve abandoned our family (not true, I’m still caring for our kids the same way and they still have an access point to come down to be with me whenever they want.) He says I am ruining the kids lives and this is not what’s best for anyone. Says I’m crazy and psycho and need to get it together. I moved a small 4x4 ikea organizer down, that had been living in our closet upstairs holding my things, that I bought a few years back. He said I need to stop moving stuff and wait to see a judge. I have not confiscated or made claim to anything. Literally just put it down there so I didn’t have to put my phone charger and water cup on a cardboard box. I decided to start having my morning coffee downstairs as well instead of upstairs in the living room where he has coffee because I realized it was becoming a window of opportunity to fight with me before the kids woke up. He then picked a fight and said “how dare I take up a common space in the house and turn it into my own little apartment!” I stated “we are separated now and heading for divorce so I’m not sure what he expects will happen going forward.” 

Since I’ve been sleeping and spending time in the downstairs unit I realize I have a newfound sense of peace. I’m sleeping better and overall I feel better. I feel like I am finally truly on my path to healing and becoming the best version of myself. And in turn, it feels like that’s going to be extremely beneficial for my kids. But, my STBX is extremely threatened by my inner peace. Every step I make to distance myself further, I notice him become trigger and lash out to fight. Why? Our marriage is over and the time to save it has passed. We both know this so I’m not sure why he is so hard pressed to continue to fighting within.? 

*Update* : an hour after posting my STBX demanded he now live downstairs! After I spent so much time and so much effort cleaning the place out, getting it somewhat livable because he refused to leave the bedroom upstairs, he now wants down here. When I asked his reasoning, he said I don’t get to just take up a common space in the home and “build myself a little apartment out of it.” Literally this all could have been avoided when I told him I wanted to divorce in Oct, he could have come down here. But he didn’t. He decided the living room was enough space and he could just put a mattress on the floor and call it a separation. Knowing I couldn’t force him to do anything, I just went ahead and removed myself. Now he wants the space. What gives ?

1htmj4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indians_StudyAbroad/comments/1htmj4a/my_experience_so_far_in_germany_as_a_masters/,My experience so far in Germany as a Masters student.,"
I’ve been in Berlin for about two and a half months now, doing my Master’s in IT. I’ll be heading to Poland for my second semester as an Erasmus student. Honestly, it’s been a mix of experiences so far. Finding a working student job here has been tough. I’ve applied to several, but I usually get rejected within 5 days. 
( Let me know if someone who can help me with it, Maybe I am doing it wrong )

I thought I’d share my experience so far to help anyone else planning to come here:

Friendly and Helpful People

One thing I’ve noticed is that people here are really friendly and helpful. A few things that stood out to me:

1. I once helped an young German lady carry her luggage. Her husband saw it, invited me into their apartment for coffee, and now we’re good friends.


2. During a train ride, a German woman noticed I didn’t understand the announcement (it was in German) and explained to me in perfect English that the train wouldn’t reach its destination.


3. At a bus stop, I was confused because no buses were coming. An old man told me it was due to construction, showed me the correct stop, and shared stories about learning French and Italian just to flirt with girls. Apparently, he regrets not marrying any of them! We’re now connected on WhatsApp.


4. At a döner shop, the owner gave me Turkish sweets and Fritz Kola for free after finding out I was Indian. He loves Aamir Khan movies and asked me for Bollywood movie recommendations.


5. At university, I’ve found the Germans to be really curious about India. They’re super helpful and speak good English, which makes things easier.



Daily Life Without German

Not knowing German makes daily life challenging. Things like shopping at supermarkets, going to the barber, or visiting government offices can be frustrating because not everyone speaks English. Some people do, but you can’t rely on it.

Job Market Struggles

The job market isn’t what I expected. Here’s what I’ve observed:

Finding English-speaking jobs has become difficult. Big companies like Google and Booking.com have closed their offices here. Even the government job agencies have tons of jobs listed, but almost none are for English speakers.

Odd jobs like food delivery (Wolt, Flink) are mostly taken up by students from private universities who are working full-time to pay their tuition fees.

Layoffs are happening in some companies, and internships or working student jobs rarely turn into full-time offers.

Some IT jobs, especially English-speaking ones, are being outsourced to India or other countries.


University vs Hochschule

If you’re struggling academically, I’d suggest looking into a Hochschule instead of a university. Hochschules are more practical and less theoretical, making it easier to balance studies and part-time work.

From what I’ve seen, experience matters more than education here. I’ve met Indians at networking events who came to Germany with just a BCom or BCA degree and 3+ years of experience during 2021–2022.

Life in Germany

Life here is definitely better than in India, especially when you consider how much you can save. For example, I spoke to someone earning €85k annually, who is the sole earner for a family with two kids (they come under tax class where they give tax lesser than India). After taxes and living expenses, they save around ₹35 lakhs per year. The government supports families with child benefits, free education, free healthcare, and even paid boot camps along with money to support your family, if you lose your job.

The work-life balance is great too. Fridays are almost like a half-day here, and people actually use their vacation and sick leaves alot.

Learning German

Learning German takes a lot of time and effort. I spend at least two hours daily on it. Balancing German classes, studies, and a part-time job is tough, so I’d recommend extending your graduation timeline to 2.5 years if needed.

My Thoughts

I’m grateful to Germany for giving me the chance to study for free with scholarships. Back in India, I couldn’t afford tuition fees for even a mid-tier university as I belong to lower middle class, and cracking top-tier universities who provide quality of education similar to Germany wasn’t my cup of tea.

That said, Germany isn’t for everyone. If you come from a wealthy family, you might find better opportunities in English-speaking countries.m and might regret choosing Germany since there are extra hurdles. 

But if you’re from lower middles class or middle class who cannot ake a big financial risk, Germany is great for you, ROI is excellent and gives you an opportunity to upgrade your economic class. 
Be ready to adapt to any job for your survival but on a limit to cover your expenses, learn German, and focus on gaining skills, Germany is a great place.

Yes, the job market isn’t as good as it used to be, but Germans are resilient. They’re the world’s third-largest economy for a reason. I believe things will improve, especially after the elections in 2025.

Any advice/tips on my current excessive ocd handwashing please?,"Currently experiencing some excessive OCD hand washing for a couple of weeks now. I have a history of anxiety and ‘what if’ and catastrophic thinking. But this hand washing is pretty new to me and it’s dictating my life.

It was all brought on a couple of weeks ago when I accidentally hoovered over a small slug which had somehow got inside my front door. I’ve always had a thing about slugs anyway as I think they’re revolting… but I guess that’s normal.

I cleaned the floor with antibacterial wipes and my hoover as best I could. But now for 2 weeks I’ve been obsessively cleaning my hands after pretty much touching anything - door handles, my phone, draws, the kettle, taps, everything I tough regularly just incase somehow ‘bits of slug’ made their onto something and I’ve been inadvertently passing it around my house. I’ve even got a weird thing about the jar of coffee in my cupboard that I had in my head that my work surface was contaminated and I put my coffee jar on it and now I’m convinced this jar is forever contaminated despite cleaning it!

I think this mostly comes from a story I read about a guy in Australia that ate a slug as a dare and then ended up in a coma, the disabled and eventually died due to a parasite.

I’ve tried thinking to myself.. you do gardening in the summer so will come into contact with areas slugs have been all the time, and people get slugs in there house all the time.. like I did when I was a kid, pre double glazing days, and you never hear of anything happening.

I’ve just convinced myself that somewhere in my house in contaminated with slug and parasites and bacteria and I’m basically passing it around, or there’s somewhere I’ve missed cleaning so have to always make sure my hands are clean. I know it’s completely irrational but the compulsions to keep doing it won’t stop.. I can’t relax if I don’t wash them, but doing so makes it worse.

I’m guessing many have experienced similar situations or can relate at least. Does anyone have any tips or advice, or can share what’s helped them etc?

1htmcas,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitVaping/comments/1htmcas/what_i_learnt_from_quitting_9_months_ago/,What I learnt from quitting 9 months ago,"Hey all -

I just thought I’d share what I learnt from quitting vaping in the hope it’ll help one or two of you to do the same. 

I was hardcore, 2 elf bars a day at the end (peach ice + pink lemonade). I vaped 2015 - 2024. Would wake up middle of night and vape, vape in cinemas, I once vaped whilst interviewing someone for a job (awful!).

My gf was giving me a lot of agg about it, I didn’t think it was that bad tbh, I kept saying it’s fine it’s way better than smoking etc etc. but my throat was hurting I was a bit sick and I was still vaping I thought wtf am I doing. I thought fuck it, I’m done. 

I called her to tell her right away, it’s good to have some accountability. That helps a bit when it gets tough. Which tbh, it was tough even 10 mins after. 

I listened to a podcast straight away, was called the quit vaping podcast, not sure if it’s big or renowned or whatever I just put it on Spotify whilst in the car. Tbh it was a bit weird BUT what was really great was how he got me to understand urges a bit better AND realise that I’m a drug addict (sounds extreme but it’s true, I would of gone to serious lengths to just get a nicotine hit, as I’m sure you’re all similar). Knowing this, made me want to beat it. I don’t want to have my life dictated to me by what is a cringe little electronic smoking device, they look pathetic and I would be so relieved whenever I could have another toke, it’s proper crack head vibes when you think of it. Anyway what I learnt there was urges, they come and go. They feel like they last forever, and sometimes they do. But you do in the end just forget about it.

I remember week 4 was the hardest, I was so depressed I thought what’s the point even living without a vape. I tried to reason any idea to have nicotine gum or something to relieve the pain, but I persevered. I realised it’s the nicotine I’m addicted to that’s what really hurts. Everywhere online says it flushes out your system in like a month, this just got me down as it still didn’t feel any better really. 

I then managed to go on my first holiday and not smoke anything or take any nicotine, this was super hard. I was just chewing whatever I could to keep my mouth happy. But knowing I’ve done that tough week, made me know I didn’t wanna go through what I did in the past again, so I just kept going. I knew I didn’t want to be addicted to nicotine so if I failed, I would want to quit again and be stuck in a trying to quit loop, so I have no choice but to keep going. 

I had an end goal, the boss level I called it. I had a festival which was a pretty heavy one and I was going to be taking and drinking all sorts, the idea of no nicotine was wild. People who don’t even smoke will smoke in them situations. I thought if I can do that, I’ve completed it. It was bloody hard but I did get through it and felt super proud after. But why hadn’t the cravings gone yet?! That got me down after it had been 3 months and still cravings were there.

Cravings improved after 2 months, I remember I went about an hour after waking up to not think of a vape. Then at 3 months maybe 2 hours. I think month 4 I remember I went a whole morning, even after a coffee and I didn’t even think about it. By month 6, you can go a whole day and not think. But you’ll still have some urges that you need to fight, but they’re so much less and genuinely bareable, which is much more that can be said about the first months. 

It’s that which motivates me now, to never have to go through it again. And I’m truly proud as it’s probably the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. 

TLDR; it’s super fucking hard. Tell people you’re doing right away and commit. Listen to quit vaping podcast. Set mini goals, accomplish them and use that as reason to not give in. Ignore your brain trying to justify reasons to get nicotine, it only drags you back in. It does get easier, just takes 5-6 months and keeps improving from there. Good luck!",4,1736019326.0,QuitVaping,2,1.0,False

Today I got the 5 dollar meal deal at Dunkin, since I know I like to get breakfast on the go since I am a college student. My usual breakfast was basically 1000 calories, and realizing that really put into perspective how much I was overeating. Today I got 2 wake up wraps, and still got a medium iced coffee. I got 3 cream, 3 unsweetened vanilla, and 2 Splenda. It was fairly creamy, not too bad! Next time I’ll add an additional Splenda. Overall the calories are around 490 for this breakfast, which for me is insane considering how much I was consuming not too long ago!

🇳🇱 Misschien heb je pas net ontdekt dat het bestaat, of wist je al wat het is en was je er al naar op zoek: Adult Nursing Relationships (ANR) of Adult Breastfeeding (ABF), dus respectivelijk relaties of intieme ontmoetingen waarbij je borstvoeding geeft aan je partner.

Misschien klinkt het raar — aan een volwassen partner, echt?! — maar dat hoeft niet, vooral als jouw borsten belangrijk zijn voor jouw beleving van fysieke en emotionele intimiteit. Overigens is het niet strikt noodzakelijk dat je lacteert; het kan ook 'droog', de handeling is voor de rest uiteraard hetzelfde.

Ik weet al lang dat ANR/ABF iets is wat ik ik heel graag wil, ik wist al zelfs nog voordat ik wist dat het 'een ding' was. Alhoewel het voor mij natuurlijk een ware eer en voorrecht zou zijn om jouw moedermelk rechtstreeks van de bron te mogen proeven als je het voor me hebt — en ik ook wel bereid ben te helpen om het op te wekken als we daarvoor willen gaan — gaat het mij uiteindelijk niet per se om de melk zelf. Het gaat om de reis met jou; de intimiteit, binding, sensualiteit, rust en zaligheid die het geeft om op die manier met jou samen te zijn! 

Dus, als jij een vrouw bent die ervan geniet als haar dames onverdeelde aandacht, liefde en verwennerij ontvangen, dan is dit misschien iets voor jou en wil ik het graag met je verkennen!🙂 Ik zelf voel me al vanaf vrijwel begin puberteit extreem aangetrokken tot borsten. Voor mij is weinig moment zo zalig als het moment dat ik de volheid en zachtheid van jouw borsten mag voelen in mijn handen, tegen mijn lijf, of in mijn mond ... masseren, kneden, zuigen, ik kan er letterlijk urenlang zonder onderbreking van genieten - jij hopelijk ook! 

Voor de duidelijkheid, ik ben specifiek niet op zoek naar seks, en dus zie ik dit zeker ook zeker niet slechts als een soort achterdeur naar seks. Ik wil de fysieke intimiteit met jou écht verkennen via je borsten en ANR/ABF🤗 

**Hoe ik het voor me zie:** eerst chatten we gewoon online — eerst natuurlijk hier op reddit, daarna telefoonnummers uitwisselen en via WhatsApp / Signal / Telegram etc. — en wisselen we foto's uit. Daarna lijkt het me fijn om een keer een koffiedate te prikken of als je het leuk lijkt daarna een langere date. Als we een match zijn dan, dan kunnen we overgaan tot een reeks ontmoetingen, en als we echt een goede match zijn en er is een goede klik tussen ons buiten enkel het ANR/ABF-aspect, dan sta ik er zeker voor open om het verdere avontuur van dit leven met jou aan te gaan in een vaste relatie 🙂

**Over mij:**

-	Leeftijd 33 jaar

-	Lengte ong. 185 cm;

-	Kort donkerblond haar;

-   Rook niet;

-   Geen vaste medicatie of medische aandoeningen;

-   Mooie mannelijke, rustgevende, lage stem, hebben vrouwen mij wel eens verteld;

-   MSc, fulltime baan als ingenieur in de elektrotechniek.

-	Hobbies / interesses: wetenschap, (elektro)techniek, wiskunde, klussen, Inkscape, muziek (bespeel een aantal instrumenten), old school video spellen, fietsenmaken, hardlopen. Waarschijnlijk nog wel meer 😛

-	Karakter: relaxed, nachtvlinder (van nature; voor mijn werk ben ik een vroege vogel geworden), droge humor, stabiel, introvert, nerderige type met een vleugje romantiek; wees niet verbaasd als ik de eerste keer bloemen voor je meeneem 💐🙂

-	Ik woon zelfstandig. Mijn appartement is nog steeds vrij spartaans ingericht en niet alle kamers zijn gestoffeerd - er moet nog wel geklust worden - maar ik ben in staat jou hier te ontvangen!

-	**Wat je van mij kunt verwachten:** ik communiceer pro-actief en neem initiatief. Ik reageer snel op berichten. Ik houd me aan afspraken en kom opdagen als we ergens afgesproken hebben. Ik respecteer alle grenzen die jij aangeeft; jouw 'nee' is voor mij ook NEE.

**Over jou:**

-	Je geniet echt van fysieke intimiteit via je borsten;

-	Waarover gesproken: het gaat mij niet om je cupmaat of welke vorm ze hebben. Het gaat er vooral om dat ze zin hebben om verwend te worden 😉

-	Single of scheidende. Geen (stiekeme) affaires, geen drama, geen 'poly' constructies.

-	Leeftijd: aller- alleruiterst 18-55 jaar. Kans op iets langdurigs is natuurlijk wel groter als je dichter in de buurt zijn van mijn leeftijd, zegge 26-35;

-	Je bent een biologische vrouw, niet trans;

-	Idealiter woon je in een plaats die in of vanuit de Randstad goed bereikbaar is met het OV (helaas geen auto). Antwerpen kan ook.


-	**Wat ik van jou verwacht:** je reageert omdat je dit ook oprecht wilt proberen; je speelt geen spelletjes maar bent transparant over je intenties, je hebt geen andere agenda. Je ghost niet maar communiceert eerlijk als je twijfels hebt of het niet langer ziet zitten. Je komt met enige regelmaat online, of bent bereikbaar, en je reageert actief.

Als ik onaangekondigd 24 uur achter elkaar niets van jou verneem, of jij vertoont passief en ongeïnteresseerd gedrag, d.w.z. onredelijk trage of minimale reacties, dan beëindig ik ons contact ter bescherming van mijn eigen tijd.

🇬🇧 Perhaps you only just discovered that this is even a thing, or you already knew about it and have been seeking it for a while: Adult Nursing Relationships (ANR) or Adult Breastfeeding (ABF), i.e. respectively relationships or intimate encounters centered around breastfeeding your partner.

That might sound weird — breastfeeding an adult partner, really?! — but it really isn't, especially if your breasts are a powerful way for you to experience intimacy, emotional or physical. Also it is not required for you to be lactating, 'dry nursing' is also a perfectly valid way to go about ANR/ABF.

I have known for a very long time that ANR/ABF is something that I truly desire, even before I knew it was actually a 'thing'. Even though it would be an absolute pleasure and privilege to try your milk straight from the source if you are producing — and I would also absolutely be willing to help induce if that's where we take things — for me it is not about the milk. Rather, it's about our time and journey together; the intimacy, bonding, sensulaity, peace and bliss that being in the moment with a fine lady like yourself brings 😊

So, if you are a woman who enjoys her girls getting worshipped, spoiled and receiving my undivided attention, then this is something that I would love to explore with you!🙂 I have always felt a strong thing for women's breasts, ever since early puberty. For me there are few comparable moments that fill me with bliss and happiness as the moment I get to feel the fulness and softness of your bosoms in my hands, up against my body, or in my mouth ... massaging, kneading, suckling, ik can enjoy this for hours without break - and hopefully the same is true for you!

Just to be clear, **I am not looking for sex** and I am also definitely not one of those guys who sees this as a backdoor route to it. I want to explore the bliss and intimacy of ANR/ABF with you, focusing on your breasts, for its own sake 🤗 
/ Telegram / Skype / etc. — and we exchange photos. Then I would like to take you out on a coffee date or if you like a longer more elaborate date. If we are a match, then we can take this further into a more intimate setting, and if we are a really good match and there is good chemistry between thus beyond just the ABF aspect, then I am definitely willing to embark on a long term relationship with you and perhaps one day even tie the knot for good 🙂

**About me:**

-	33 years old

-	Height: approximately 185 cm (approx. 6'1"" )

-	Short, dark blond hair

-   I do not smoke;

-   No medical issues and take no regular drugs (DDF)

-   Women have told me in the past I have a nice, soothing masculine voice;

-   MSc degree, I work fulltime as an electrical engineer.

-	Hobbies / interests: science, (electrical) engineering, maths, DIY'ing stuff, Inkscape, music (I play a few instruments), old school video games, fixing bikes, running/jogging. There's probably a few more I forgot to think of 😛

-	Personality: laid back, night owl (by nature; for work I have had to become an early bird), dry humor, stable, introverted, loveable nerd with a romantic streak; do not be surprised if I bring you flowers the first time I see you 💐🙂

-	I have my own place. My apartment is still fairly spartan as not all the rooms have gotten a floor yet - there is still some DIY'ing that needs to be done - but I am definitely able to host you here!

-	**What you can expect from me:** I am a pro-active communicator and I take and show initiative. I respond to messages timely. I show up to dates and I keep promises. I respect any and every clearly communicated boundary you may have.

**About you:**

-	You experience and enjoy physical and emotional intimacy through your breasts;

-	Speaking of which: it is not important for me what size or shape they are, I do not obsess about your cup size. I care about them enjoying being worshipped and spoiled 😉

-	You are actually single, or have already initiated divorce. No sneaky affairs, no drama, no 'poly' constructs. I am not out here looking to wreck homes or existing relationships.

-	Age range: absolute limits are 18-55. Of course for something genuinely long term it would be better if you are close to me in age, say 26-35.

-	You are a biological woman, i.e. not trans;

-	Preferably you are located in a place that is easily reachable from the Randstad by public transport, or perhaps Antwerpen. Unfortunately I do not own a car;

-	**What I expect from you:** be for real. If you reach out it's because you are actually interested in trying or doing this, you are not about playing games and having some hidden agenda, you are forthcoming about your intentions. You do not ghost but are honest about it if you are having second thoughts or have changed your mind. You are online and available to chat regularly, and you respond timely and consistently.

If you up and disappear unannounced in the middle of a back-and-forth conversation and you do not respond within 24 hours, then for the sake of protecting my own time I will assume you have ghosted me and I will move on. Likewise, if I sense low effort or a low interest attitude from you - minimal replies, passive reciprocation, unreasonably long response times - then I will also not hesitate to move on.",1,1736019265.0,ANRelationship,0,1.0,False

Full disclosure I watch them on 2x speed, and then go back as needed.

Oh, His n J’Hers Vow booklets. Also included are his shoes, her strappy glittery chunky heels, the rings and her bouquet and a beaded pearl bangle? Where are his accessories? We never find out, because it’s on to the bridal party pictures. The Duggalettes and Duggalettes-In-Love line up beside CinderJana, with J’Blessa toning down her bared teeth for a normal smile now that she’s inside and not squinting for her life. The bride’s side makes generally celebratory poses while the Wiss-Men make jokingly shocked poses. The older guys in the middle and end of the groom’s side look like he invited his fellow pastors and really makes it kind of creepy since J16 and J18 are in the party and are standing at the end of the lineup. In a bigger clustered up group shot, one of the fellow pastors resembles a sentient Stetch Armstrong. Next up, we have the 7 Duggalettes posing alone.

The event is officially kicking off now that the pictures are over as J’Annoying Orange and J’Orchestra Pit escort in various elderly relations to the front row on the groom’s side. The parents of the groom escort themselves, as she holds a lit white candle. Alone, the J’mother-in-love of 2 J’Locusts walks up the stage to light another long white candle. J’Orchestra Pit escorts in Perm, in her lintwater lace, stopping to keep her candle from blowing out. Perm laughs as the grooms side watches on stonily. A flat-haired Perm lights her candle on the pillar and walks back down along the side of the shot to her seat. Prince Preaching, his officiant and Best man arrive and march down to the stage. One of the older guys escorts in Jingle, J16 is with the Stretch Armstrong looking dude, and  OfNostrils gets another of the older pastors who looks like he could also run a deli if the pastor gig doesn’t pan out. OfPlanes and a Wiss-Man stare smilingly off to the front rows of the bride’s side. J’Blessa smugly smiles as she walks up the aisle, solo. No pastors for her, except Bin. The violin hits a sour note as a hoard of little girls in white pour up the aisle. It’s weird because half of the faces are blurred out. Maybe that’s a sign that you should have just left the whole part out. If not all the flower girls can be in the public YouTube video, maybe don’t show any of them? Either way, J17 and J19 escort the tiny flock of flower girls up the aisle.

Everyone stands as CinderJana and Sperm enter after the doors are flung open. Sperm officially hands CinderJana over to Prince Preaching and the officiant immediately starts with a prayer. The attendees are given a job to do, and it is to pray for the couple and their marriage. With the amount of weddings these folks go to, it’s a wonder they have any time outside of praying for everyone else. The officiant says CinderJana is a beautiful bride, while Prince Preaching “isn’t too shabby either”. They all laugh and he goes on to comment about the record breaking amount of nieces CinderJana and Prince Preaching have. I wonder if they don’t just have racks of flower girl dresses at TTH, aka The Big House.  But back to the wedding, and the officiant drives home again how finally this moment has arrived.  He brings up how long the parents of the bridal party have waited and prayed how this is “the fulfillment of their prayers”. Jesus Humberto Christ, he’s about to make me feel bad for her that her officiant is borderline roasting her on how old she is. He does mercifully move on, and goes into how much neither of them like change. They both “pegged it out on a bar graph” that it’s their least favorite thing. So what are they doing? Making the biggest change there is. Then he says “practical love for each other always reveals my lack of love for God”. I slowed it down, I played it twice because what? If you love your spouse, you aren’t loving God? He doesn’t just walk this back, he runs it back as he goes on to say that God tells everyone to love him and love each other.  The next point he makes is that any “hiccups or bumps” need to “grow vertically” as opposed to “growing horizontally” and he doesn’t really explain what “growing vertically” vs “horizontally” is but I’m guessing it means pray to God and he will give you kids so that you won’t have time to fight because you’re in the trenches. The third (and hopefully final) point is that “functional unity” can’t be achieved without “a deep love for the same king and kingdom”. Ugh. By them both working towards God and heaven, their hearts will merge and they will always work in harmony forever and ever and always, ad nauseum and etc. Well, *that* sounds like witchraft.

And speaking of witchcraft, CinderJana’s fairy seamstress’ spell seems to be wearing off as her sleeves pucker and fold under their own weight. The officiant’s final point is that if God has the right spot in their heart, they will be at the right spot in each other’s lives. Well, that sounds exhausting. “Hey Babe, is your heart right with God?” “I’m not sure, let me pray about it” “Okay, well, if you don’t find it by the time we go to bed I’m praying for God to fix our marriage and starting my family’s prayer chain at breakfast”. “Great, I’ll go ahead and let mine know I need guidance in my marriage”. I’d pray for a meteor to hit me if I woke up as CinderJana. The officiant continues on to say that we have three parts, physical, emotional and spiritual and that all three must be in focus to achieve a good marriage. After one last plug for the relationship with God making the relationship perfect in Nebraska, he segues into the vows about how they are choosing each other of the same free will they choose to follow God. Well, that’s the first true thing he’s said all wedding. It’s their choice to run their marriage by whatever belief system they see fit. We get to the ring part and then another prayer. Prince Preaching and the newly minted Princess Preaching light the unity candle on the pillar with the candles their mothers’ brought up. As SiRen stand at the front of the stage and serenade the assembly, the Preachings go and wait for the all clear for the first kiss. It’s a basic kiss, but very likely a practiced one. Another kiss on her temple as they proceed back up the aisle. They get halfway before he picks her up and carries her off, veil trailing as he almost collides with a small child dressed in pink. The music picks up as the rest of the party proceeds sedately back up the aisle. Perm and Sperm, clad in lint water lace and an extra’s suit from MIB, greet people as they walk and stare through the camera. The 2xMILS meet and greet and compare the rest of their unmarried kids to see if they can get anymore of these joint weddings. Guests carry their chairs to the reception, I assume, and clear the space for the mega family photos that need to be taken.  Photos of the couple with each sibling follow. Of course, they economize with the Jernies, since it counts for both sides. Other notes on the sibling photos is that the Count and Countess Gagula didn’t pose with their children, and J’Blessa posed by herself. No other $eeWorlds in these photos. The El Ay Bookses have both Privacee and Publicitee, while the Planes had both of their children also. SiRen and their 3 appear with the childrens’ faces blurred out. The !’s appear holding Tru! and Ra! while Sage! and Beige! make a sneak appearance. J’Annoying Orange makes the bride and groom lift him up for their photo with him. Natch.

Next up is the Wiss-Men and Wiss-ters, starting with one Wiss-ter and a niece, followed by the Stretch Armstrong looking groomsman plus his wife and 4 kids. One of the kids is super sassy and I appreciate his vibe after what I know was a forever long wait. Another Wiss-ter and her 5 children plus headship then, the groomsman assigned to Jingle and a small family appear for their photo. A single Wiss-ter is next up, followed by a Wiss-Man and his helpmeet plus 3 kids. These kids could easily pass as Gigglets with neon blonde hair. Two more single Wiss-ters take a single and then a double shot with the Preachings, followed by another groomsman Wiss-Man and his family. A final single Wiss-ter and the Jernie’s didn’t even make it into the lineup. The assembled party makes it outside for more photos and the dip kiss. Four times. The dip kiss 4 times in one photo burst before posing next to the vintage get-away car.

A montage of reception shots, food being served by faceless arms to faceless arms holding plates and a cake. It’s plain white with some greenery and white flowers and their initials in gold. There is a smattering of random guest shots before the party is introduced. Buckle up my little snarky gnocchis, this one’s cringey. J18 walks in with the oldest guy in the bridal party. She throws him her bouquet and he pretends to do a magic trick with it before giving it back as they go to their seats. Next in is Jingle, who gets to the middle of the floor and mimes swinging a baseball bat with her bouquet. The hand up to the forehead like she’s watching it clear the fence gets an “oh God” from me and a “so dumb” from Mr. Swiss. Looks like her homerun turned into an out at first base. J16 and her groomsman mime him reeling her bouquet (and her) in for a high-five. I’ll be honest, I was a little afraid they were going to pull a JoKen and get engaged. OfNostrils and a Wiss-Man groomsman do some weird line dance before spinning each other on the dance floor. She put as much effort into planning into that as she did her vlogs, about 60%. OfPlanes walks in pumping her arms after her Wiss-Man groomsman carrying a huge boombox. J’Blessa and a final Wiss-Man groomsman arrive to do The Floss. Yes, my fellow snarkers this video has been a time-warp back to 2018. They awkwardly shrug at each other and run off. The bride and groom are announced and do another dip kiss before cutting cake and toasting with Welch’s Sparkling.

J’Blessa takes the mic to give her speech. I can’t wait to hear the jewelry box story and how the fine print imprisoned CinderJana to her until this her wedding day when she was finally set free. Up first in Matron of Honor is that CinderJana has always been there for J’Blessa, and liked to play Hair Salon with all of the sisters. J’Blessa was a tenderhead and whined but loved the French braids if she could manage to sit still. The next memory is of she and the other sisters following fad diets or hairstyles pioneered by CinderJana. “Yes even the orange peroxide, we thought it looked great”. OfPlanes runs over to hug someone in the background. In her defense of how CinderJana is perfect at everything J’Blessa says that CinderJana has spent more time at Lowe’s than all of the men in the room. She goes on to say they’ve counseled, cried, prayed etc. Some last minute comments about coffee and projects and she hugs them both and they all cry.

The Wiss-Best-Man, starts off with a story about 2 year old Prince Preaching. It rambles on about how Prince Preaching always said he was 4 and Wiss-Best-Man was 2 even though it was reversed in reality. He says his humor needed refinement because he took a tap or clogging shoe and hit the Wiss-Best-Man in the head. He assures CinderJana that’s not an issue anymore. The vlog then cuts to them coming up to hug and we never find out what happened the day Abel went after Cain, so to speak.

Everyone holds sparklers for the first dance between Prince Preaching and Janny Nine Nails. They dance as expected and then take time out of their wedding day to say “it’s been such a great day, so many family and friends etc, blah” They promise to keep us updated before a final two dip kisses and they drive off into the night.

There is the Seventh Day of Snarkmas everyone, and the finale of CinderJana, Janny Nine Nails , the new Princess Preaching’s wedding. I’ll be back with the Eighth Day of Snarkmas soon! Have a great day!",2,1736018831.0,SnarkyRecapsBySwiss,0,1.0,False

I checked my car and there was a scuff on it that wiped off. The car I bumped looked in a similar situation. Unfortunately as I returned to the car to leave the note, the driver had arrived and they were about to drive off. I could have ran and knocked on the window but I wasn't sure what to do and just went into the coffee shop opposite.
I have checked on Google and it says I should report to the police via an online form. Is this right? There was minimal damage but I obviously do not want to commit a crime. I'm more than happy to pay out if needed as it was my mistake - I misjudged the space and just caught the car!

A few comments/questions:

* I still need to work on my XYZ, it is hard with research work without being too specific.
* I know skills should go at the bottom, but I prefer them higher up to immediately highlight my suitability for the role (customized for each application).
* Why shouldn't I include a ""References"" section? I often see it on research CVs.
* Is there a potential bias against candidates using ProtonMail addresses?

1htm20q,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tipstor/comments/1htm20q/spices_are_not_immortal/,“Spices Are Not Immortal”,"Spices are the introverts of the culinary world. They’ll sit quietly in the back of your cabinet, minding their own business for years, waiting to be noticed. But just because they’re patient doesn’t mean they don’t have limits. You think you can treat your spices like neglected houseplants and still expect them to perform? Think again. If you want them to add actual flavor to your food instead of just colorful dust, it’s time to get your spice-storing act together.

First off, let’s talk about where you’re keeping them. If your answer is “next to the stove,” congratulations, you’ve already failed the spice-parenting test. Spices hate heat, humidity, and light almost as much as I hate finding an empty coffee pot in the morning. Those adorable little racks mounted to the wall above your oven? They’re basically spice saunas. And sure, while your cumin might enjoy the spa day at first, prolonged exposure to heat and steam will suck the life right out of it faster than a Monday morning meeting. Instead, stash them in a cool, dark cabinet — preferably one you don’t have to climb on the counter to reach. Accessibility matters.

Now, let’s address the containers. Are you leaving your spices in those flimsy plastic bottles they came in? Stop it. You’re asking your precious paprika to survive in a glorified Ziploc bag. Invest in some glass jars with tight-fitting lids. Your spices deserve a proper home, not the equivalent of a cardboard box under the stairs. And while you’re at it, label those jars unless you enjoy playing culinary roulette every time you cook. Is it cinnamon or cayenne? Who knows! Roll the dice and see what happens.

Oh, and let’s have a word about expiration dates. Yes, spices can last for years, but they’re not immortal. If you bought that bottle of dried oregano back when you still thought low-rise jeans were a good idea, it’s time to let it go. A good rule is ground spices should be replaced every one to two years, and whole spices can push three to four. If you’re not sure, give them the sniff test. Can’t smell anything? Toss it. Smells like your grandmother’s attic? Toss it. Smells vaguely like it might still be the spice it claims to be? You’re probably good to go.

One of the most common mistakes people make is shaking spices directly over a steaming pot. Sure, it feels efficient, but you’re essentially baptizing your spices in a cloud of moisture. That’s how you end up with clumpy garlic powder or a cinnamon stick that looks like it got rained on. Use a spoon or pour some into your hand before adding it to your dish. I know, extra effort, but trust me, your spices will thank you for not subjecting them to a humid nightmare.

And let’s not ignore the emotional trauma of neglect. If you’ve got spices that haven’t seen the light of day since you moved in, do everyone a favor and either use them or chuck them. Nutmeg isn’t going to grate itself, and that jar of turmeric doesn’t deserve to be treated like a forgotten souvenir. Cooking with spices is supposed to be an adventure, not a chore, so dust off that coriander and show it some love.

Spices aren’t just pantry decorations — they’re the unsung heroes of your kitchen. Treat them with respect, store them properly, and maybe — just maybe — your food will stop tasting like boiled socks. Because let’s face it, your cooking could use all the help it can get, and those spices are the only ones brave enough to provide it.

I got tired of hand grinding with my timemore chestnut C3 Max pro. Furthermore, I'm missing granularity between settings. The machine stalls at 6 clicks and the shot pulls too fast at 7 clicks. I'm looking for an electric single dose grinder with good setting reproducibility. I need to be able to reliably switch between grind settings and low static retention to prevent contamination between different beans. 

Location: Germany.

Preferred drinks: espressi and Americani, but I also brew a lot of filter coffee. Nevertheless, the focus of the grinder would be espresso since hand grinding for filter is not an issue. Light to medium roasts switching multiple times within a week.

Drink frequency: usually 2 shots back to back twice a day, but definitely more if we have guests over. Serving our guests espressi is the main driver behind buying an electric grinder. Hand grinding takes way too long and I'm tired and annoyed after the third shot

Space: not an issue.

Experience level: intermediate. I know my way around a grinder and an espresso machine.

Manual or electric: definitely electric. I refuse to hand grind any further.

Budget: 500€, but may go above if someone suggests a grinder that perfectly fits. 

Candidates: I'm open for anything, but after seeing Lance Hendrik's grinders under 250$ video, these two seemed like a good choice
- DF64(V) Gen 2 (is it worth getting the SSP MP burrs or are the DLC burrs good enough?)
- Fellow opus with bellows (+ maybe fellow ode gen 2 for filter?)
- CF64V? (Maybe this is THE grinder?)

I'm guessing it's bc a bunch of New Years resolution-makers are trying to get their shit together with 2026 IB recruitment around the corner, or whatever. Given it seems to be a popular time of year for networking, I figured it'd be helpful to share painful mistakes I see kids make over and over again, every year, to hopefully inform networking efforts.

* DON'T attaching your resume to the initial cold email. This diminishes personability, and appears way too transactional. The worst part about this that many don't even know is that most of the top firms automatically flag attachments from unrecognized addresses as spam mail anyway. Not only will you not reach their inbox at all, but if this happens enough your personal email address might get flagged by email service providers like Gmail as a spammer, and your reputation / overall deliverability could suffer
* Over time, I feel like students have taken a more and more awkward / structured approach to ""coffee chats"" or whatever you want to cal them. I get that on-campus resources and IB clubs teach you to come to the call with ""good questions"" to ask, but simply rattling off 5-10 questions in linear order is not how effective conversations are curated in the real world. If you make a question list, use it as a ""backup"" to reference if the chat hits a ""dead end"" and instead of awkwardly asking disparate question after disparate question, try to follow a more natural conversation pattern in order to learn more about their role while articulating your interest in investment banking. Like everything you say should ideally have some relevant link to what they said, and so on...
* The BIGGEST blunder I see students make is not having ANY idea how to convert coffee chats into actual actionable recruitment opportunities. No matter how well the conversation goes, directly asking for a referral always appear too transactional imo. Sure it's a bit of a paradox because all bankers who get networking inbound know the sender isn't actually genuinely interested in their role / firm, they just want help through the recruiting process, but it's best to keep that as an unspoken rule. Instead of directly asking and breaking that barrier, ""open the door"" for whoever you're networking with to help you into recruitment. For example, at the end of the coffee chat if things go well, ask “what’s the best way to stay in the loop for recruitment?” or ""how can I learn more about formal recruitment at \[Firm\]?"" instead of “can you refer me for an investment banking summer analyst role?“ – though subtle, this is much more emotionally intelligent approach and surely if the convo actually went well and you were well-liked, next steps will ensue and perhaps you'll be told a month or date to follow up closer to recruitment. And from there perhaps they'll put you in touch with whoever is running recruitment
* LinkedIn can be fine for networking, but there's a lot of other resources to try if you aren't seeing results. In reality, LinkedIn searches only reveal public profiles (a fraction of what's actually out there), and few bankers actually put which product or industry group they're in, which is crucial information for networking, especially for those who know which team they want to join. Instead of LinkedIn, try RecruiterBase or something else that includes verified work emails and product / industry groups along with universities, hobbies, and other criteria. Most bankers don't check LinkedIn very often anyway, it's better to land directly in their inbox  

Am I missing any? Or curious if there's anything folks disagree with. I have skin in this game here too even though I'm already to the buy side, given it's brutal watching kids fail over and over again at networking haha",36,1736018096.0,FinancialCareers,7,0.89,False

So in an effort to maybe help others with toddlers i'd love to share my experience and maybe offer a bit of help for the not so travelled.

I'm late to the parent game being 46 with a 3 year so maybe that offers a bit of life experience.

My main advice would be take it easy, no need to rush or get worked up about getting to everything or queieng for popular rides 

We booked entrance tickets ahead of time, booked an apartment 20 mins away so easy walking or shuttlebus.

We got there early, strolled around through each area in a sort of sequence but just going with the flow stumbling onto the next thing, taking it all in, all the atention to detail, all the characters everywhere, each shop we strolled into, each restaurant as they were themed was a joy to see.

Our son absolutely loved taking it all in, seeing all the characters, all the animatronics, taking photos on the train, on the paddle ship jumping with joy seeing the rollercoaster on the island wizz by with people screaming, hide behind me when he heard the ghosts at the manor.

We ate early, 12pm, was easy peasy, as we had breakfast so early, and then marvelled at the enormous queues for people having lunch later whilst we enjoyed a coffee or hot chocolate strolling around.

We caught the parades on the first day, got to edge of mainstreet for Mickey's parade, then the evening snow on mainstreet, my son smiling ear to ear catching the ""snow"".

Took it all easy and enjoyed it all so much, didn't feel we missed out at all not doing the big ticket rides, he didn't need that, he was living his dream seeing all the tv characters in person and close hehe.

If you have 3/4 year old and thinking about it, go for it! It was a blast for everyone!

We did the studio also one day, that wasn't too great for his age, he loved the shows, but apart from alot being closed, the rides weren't for him yet, but main park fantastic.",5,1736018006.0,disneylandparis,0,1.0,False

Do you know any content creators (preferably on YouTube) that are to tea what James Hoffmann is to coffee? Not in terms of popularity, but rather regarding the clarity and ""scientificity"" of his work.

I just feel like every YT channel about tea that's out there is either constantly stating outright lies about the alleged health benefits of the products they're talking about (which are most of the time sold by the YTers themselves) or way too into mystical and ""spiritual"" stuff which makes them dilute and cloud their videos with a lot of nonsense.

1htlryk,https://i.redd.it/5ucn20td01be1.jpeg,Comparison: BIR Coral Fantasy + John Varvatos Artisan XX,"As CF was a hot commodity a few months back, and maybe it still is? I’d thought I’d share my experience with it, while already owning something that was so damn close in scent profile. 

BIR CF is red apple, some lavender, and then earthy notes that makes it sweet but grounds it. 
The sweet notes fade pretty quick and then your left with a tiny bit of apple, followed by tobacco leaf while although sweet, turns more herbal and smoky. 

XX is almost identical in the opening as far as smell but I pick up red apple, a hint of coffee, cardamom, and I guess black currant (I’m not too familiar with the specific smell but know the other notes fairly well). 
Stays sweet throughout, not much earthiness to it, and the coffee and apple stay throughout with a hint of spiciness. 

They are ridiculously similar, the only true difference is that tobacco note that’s heavy in CF. Owning both is redundant imo, they’re so similar, BUT XX is half the cost, or less!
I’m pretty sure my wife prefers XX, but she has weird taste in fragrances. I was at Sephora smelling CF and the younger couple next to me were between the BIR edt and CF, and the girl WOULD NOT shut up on how much she liked CF. 
To each their own I guess.

The couch is 2 years old and came from our last place. It pilled and sank very quickly, but not in the budget to get a new one at the moment. Is the issue here that the couch and wall colors are too similar? Have also considered adding wainscoting to the stairs to add some dimension/color. 

Not attached to the rug or coffee table, so open to suggestions for replacements there. The rug is about 9x12, do I need something bigger?

Finally, I know I need to add artwork/greenery to bring the room to life, but am having a hard time matching anything to my partner’s blue Kaws print. Is there any way to tie this into the room or does it need to go? I don’t think it works with the style of the room, but would like to make an effort to have it tie in for his sake.

1htlrac,https://www.reddit.com/r/nobuy/comments/1htlrac/journey_at_the_mall/,Journey at the mall,"Green Light: 
Happy that I stuck to my grocery list for sushi bake i'm making for tomorrow (except for japanese chilli flakes as a condiment). The leftovers will also serve as my lunch for work. 

I went to a dermatology clinic (I am fearful of my acne getting worse and have scarring to deal with since my breakout in late October).

Yellow light: 
Bought a mascara for replacement. I don't like the maybelline sky high and it was also starting to smell waxy (it's been 7 months and i barely use it because my eyelashes tends to fall off). I'm trying Clio and it's so good at curling my lashes and easy to remove- but still my lashes fell off when wiping it away with micellar water or when using cleansing oil. Idk if this is psychological but I keep seeing my lashes during removal. So far lancome's mascara doesn't make any lash fall off (iirc) but it costs more than double for what im paying now. I'm in a dilemma. Should I just stick to Lancome despite it being pricier? 


Red Light purchase: 

Breakfast and coffee outside by myself because I woke up late and today was considered an errands day. Was able to skip lunch and had early dinner at home (cleared my fridge!).

Pretty bummed I didn't stick to my no new clothes category when I got 4 socks instead of 2 (the other 2 had a clearance promo, while the other was on my not-urgent list. somehow this brand carrying my size is always sold out). I suppose socks won't be in my need to buy list for a good 2 years. 

Impulse control: 
I had like 5 items in my nike cart online because it's the end of season sale. But a friend reminded me that i can go into the shop and try on things instead of buying and having to return the items. So I went into the store and tried out everything in my cart, except for 1 top that was not sold in store. I reached home and deleted everything except for that 1 top. i ordered them before but i sent it back because it's too big. But now, I feel like getting this again with a size down because it oversized. I will still mull it over, maybe I won't get it. 

Overall thoughts: 
it's crazy that despite having a list, i found myself browsing (that's how i remember the socks) and asking myself ""ok so what else do i need?"" when i was already struggling to remember what i need to get. I have been the kind of shopper who doesn't browse things. But it seems like I have just been overwhelmed in other areas of my life so im looking for a distraction and this could be it.

Why? Because the original actor became a pizzagate whistleblower and vanished under mysterious circumstances.

Think about it—Todd’s character suddenly feels and looks different in later episodes. That eerie calm? That unsettling smile? Fat tits... It’s almost too perfect, like a calculated move to distract from the switch. Jesse Plemons was brought in not just because he’s a great actor, but because he could embody Todd’s sinister vibe without raising questions.

The real kicker? The original actor reportedly left behind only a lipstick-stained coffee cup on set before disappearing for good, along with a note ranting about adrenochrome siphoned from Holly and the biker kid to get Robert Forester to join the production. Vince Gilligan, ever the perfectionist, played it off as an artistic choice.

This is an updated release of my previous fan-edit that includes ideas and scenes that I never got around to including in the original release. The main objective with this last release was to take any feedback given and polish my edit, along with giving it newly rescored scenes and fixes. 

V3 Specific Changes Include: 

- Rescored Flash’s running scene to the brilliant “At the Speed of Force” OST from ZSJL. This was done to better incorporate the continuity of ZSJL and also because, let’s face it, it’s just a banger of an OST.

- Rescored Batman’s Death to the OST “Beautiful Lie”. 

- Rescored the fight montage music between the 2 Flashes and Zods Army using OST’s from Man of Steel. I was extremely satisfied with the result. With this final fight scene rescored, ALL pop/cover songs have been removed from the film and replaced with OST’s, giving the film a much more serious feel.

- Added back in the fight between Barry 1 and Barry 2 in the batcave. In earlier versions of Flashpoint, I had decided to remove this scene to focus on Bruce more and move along his story quicker. In the end however, this scene is great character study on who Barry is, and it felt wrong to take that away from him in a movie where he shares half the spotlight. 

- Rescored Barry 2 getting his powers for the first time using OST’s from “The Flash (2023)”

- Cleaned up footage from the deleted scene explaining why Batman retired. 

- And many more slight fixes to add to the experience of the film!


How to Watch:
If you have already been sent a link in the past, just use that same one to access V3! If this is your first time wanting to view the edit, you’re welcome to DM me, email me, or check the Fan-Edit Central. Thank you for taking the time to watch my edit. Cheers!


Original Runtime: 2h 24m

New Runtime: 1h 36m 


Original Changes include:

1htlm37,https://www.reddit.com/r/hypertension/comments/1htlm37/feeling_defeated_by_resistant_hypertension/,Feeling defeated by resistant hypertension ,"Long story below - looking for any guidance on what I could possibly do next:

- I’m a woman in my late 30s who has been dealing with resistant hypertension for the last 6 years. I am not overweight and never have been. I am in reasonably good physical shape and stay pretty active. The hypertension started suddenly in the months after giving birth to my second child. I eat pretty healthy overall, have around 3 drinks per week, and have one cup of coffee a day. I already tried cutting all caffeine and alcohol for months and it made zero difference to my blood pressure.

- subclinical hypothyroid - I’ve been on meds for five years with normal thyroid numbers on blood tests.

- three years ago, I was in the ER 3x in a hypertensive crisis. Have been on lisinopril (didn’t work at all), and then three successively increasing dosages of amlodipine/valsartan, all of which worked briefly and then didn’t. I’m currently on the highest possible dose of amlodipine/valsartan and still have readings at home of around 140/90.

- been tested for renal artery stenosis. Had both CT scans and numerous blood tests for Cushing’s, pheochromocytoma, and functional adrenal tumors. I DO have a 1.5 cm adrenal adenoma but doctors have said the blood tests don’t show it to be definitively functional, so there’s nothing they can do. I’ve gotten three different opinions on the adenoma and all the doctors shrug it off.

- cardiologist just says maybe I’m predisposed to high blood pressure and doesn’t take me seriously.

I honestly do not know what to do. I’ve had dizzy spells my whole life, used to pass out as a teen from LOW blood pressure - and suddenly this? I don’t understand it.

Other coexisting health issues are high intraocular pressure, tinnitus, and extremely heavy menstrual bleeding that led to the removal of my uterus last year.",3,1736017427.0,hypertension,4,1.0,False

1htleqw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1htleqw,watery espresso puck [homix espresso machine],"Espresso/cappuccino tips? 

Hi! So I have a grinder and an espresso machine at home. The puck looks like this after extraction. Its a bit watery i guess? My reference is coffee shops the puck always looks solid and you turn it upside down it falls in one piece. Does that make any sense? 🧍‍♂️I took a picture with and without the flash for clarity. I put 13 grams of coffee for a double shot. The grind? I dont have that thing with holes that measures you exact grind (peak scientific terminology), but for context, my grinder has a scale from 0-20 and I do 7 for espresso. I used to press really hard on the puck but my machine has this thing that tells you the pressure (i left a picture of it below) and it said that the pressure was way above the espresso range. I asked chat gpt about how to fix that lol and it said dont compress the puck too much and dont grind too fine. I used to grind on the 5 setting, but the 7 setting and pressing less on the puck made the pressure within the espresso range. small wins. still on the higher end, though, so I dont know if this is why the puck looks ‘watery’. the espresso tastes fine though but im wondering if these small tricks can make it even better. 

Now steaming for a cappuccino. The steamer in the espresso machine is what I use. It heats up the milk just fine but it just doesnt do art? i’ve looked up so many tutorials of latte art and follow them word for word but it just doesnt work so i think the problem is with the consistency of the milk.

Check out my last post for more info on the beans! Gifted to me by my friend Nate at City League Coffee Roasters. Long story short : he hired his son to work with his coffee partners in Colombia to curate the flavors on these beans, as well as design the label. Such a sweet concept that made for some incredibly funky and interesting coffee.

Tasting notes (no milk) : insane balance between nutty / beautiful dark woody ferment notes, and sharply sweet watermelon / jolly rancher sour notes. Exactly what was described on the can.

With milk: the funkiest fermented melon candy taste I think I've ever had. Coffee or otherwise. Weird and wonderful

I purchased an espresso machine and stopped using the pods. I’m now trying to use the Nespresso again and after fixing the problem with the water not pumping, the pressure is not enough to make an espresso.

I’m thinking about replacing the Pixie with a new Nespresso machine. I’m leaning at sticking with the original pods because they are less expensive. I’ve had coffee and espresso using the Virtuoso machine but I think the pods are just too expensive.

Any reason why I shouldn’t get a Creatista Plus original pod machine?

PS - while I realize I could continue to use my Breville espresso machine, I’m convinced the grinder is not grinding fine enough and consistently and I don’t want to invest in an expensive grinder.

As title says, I'm looking for a cycling group to do around 100k either Saturday or Sunday on regular basis. I’m training for a triathlon but more than happy to join a purely cycling club or group if it means I can get some good rides in. 

I’m based in South East London (Greenwich, ofc :) and looking for others who meet around Greenwich on either Saturday or Sunday for about 100k. Would be great to find a friendly, beginner-to-intermediate group that doesn’t leave anyone behind on the climbs (or at the coffee stops).

I’d also love to connect with people who do weekday Zwift rides or shorter spins, and maybe even the occasional bigger trip. I’m not a hardcore pro by any means—just someone who enjoys chatting while riding, sharing a few training tips, and maybe a post-ride café or pub stop (carb loading is crucial, right?).

If you’ve got a crew, a local club, or any leads on where I can jump in for weekend group rides, let me know. Cheers in advance for the help, and I hope to see some of you out on the roads soon!",2,1736016113.0,triathlon,1,1.0,False

I have always studied different things, have been working since I was 15 (I'm about to turn 21), and get bored fast and want to move to a different enviroment.

I worked as an administrative in real state and in an attorneys firm. Then I worked for a NGO, as a facer in the street collecting donations.

Last year, I finally got a very good job, working from home as an interpreter (translator). Like a call center, I recieve calls from medical proffessionals who need help with their patients who don't speak their language. It can be inside the medical room or administrative tasks, even emergency calls.

Last year I was in a company with a fixed schedule, working a few pre-fixed hours, getting payed at the end of the month. That worked out so well! It was very stressful and consuming, but only a few hours in and then I had the rest of the day, and made so much more money that if I was working another job. The thing is, I made a trip to Europe for the summer and had to quit that job, was told to re-apply when I was back. When I got back, oof, it was so so hard. But then I recieved an offer from another company, same job but a higher pay, so I took it. The only problem, this company is free lance and I don't have a fixed schedule. I work when I like, the time I like, and that's so hard to keep up.

I'm an actress on top of all, I study many arts and have been working in many theater plays while working this other jobs. Since this company is free lance, I just can't bring myself to do it. I have spent multiple days, even weeks without working. I have got small jobs singing and performing in parties to mantain myself, but my income has decreased a lot - I was living on my own and had to move out due to problems with violent neighbors, so back at living with my mom, I don't have the same financial responsibilites that I had before, and this makes things even harder.

I have tried everything, working at different time of the day, setting alarms, working in sets of fewer hours during the day, nothing seems to work. I really need the money, but I just can't work this job anymore. I will wake up at 8, sit down at the computer (it's in a whole different room, I have tried that too) and just won't be able to work. I have booked another jobs, went in for a few days, just dropped becasue they're not as good as the one I have.

I get told that everytime, everyone just tells me they want my job, that it's so easy, that everyone gets tired after a while but it's such a good offer. I know, but it's just a demanding job. You cannot be passive, you have to be listening, translating, thinking ALL the time. No breaths. I can't even drink my coffee sometimes. Everyone says that I just have to do it, and that this is the best I'll get, best than any other job, but truly, I'm miserable and tired and anxious all day. My mental health is not the best at the moment and I think this job just contributes to that. This is the longest I've been working the same job, besides acting, one year and a half in translating.

Maybe I'm just whining and this is actually simple, but I wanted to vent a little and also share my problem.

What do you do when everyone tells you you already have the best job offer you'll get?

The timeline is crazy and it's hard to think about...

We're supposed to graduate this May but I have an internship overseas in the summer and will be apart from him for about 3 months if I'm able to go on my internship. I have epilepsy which might stop me from going. We're thinking we could get married before my internship so he can go with me and then I'm able to go but he should stay in the US so he can get a job and be able to stay (he's not from the US and if he gets a job after graduation in his degree he can stay). If I cant go on my internship we'd probably get married in the early summer too. But most likely I'd go on my internship and we'd get married in the fall. I'll just miss him so muchhh

Barry’s paws tightened around the pen as his thoughts wandered to the darker corners of his mind. Recently, he’d noticed an unsettling thrill whenever he’d caught himself fantasizing about power, control, and scenarios he couldn’t fully bring himself to face. It frightened him, this budding psychosexual sadism that didn’t fit with the kindhearted bear everyone thought him to be.

“Is this who I really am?” he wondered. Could he ever tell anyone? Samantha the Squirrel, cheerful and chatty, would surely scurry away in fear. Trevor the Turtle, who hosted weekly mindfulness sessions, would probably just say, “Meditate on it, dude.” No one would understand.

The door creaked open, and Samantha poked her head in, balancing a precarious stack of acorns.

“Hey, Barry, did you finish the quarterly pawformance report?” she chirped.

Barry groaned, snapping back to the present. “No, Samantha. I’m barely functioning here. Between the loans, the rent, and this dead-end job, I feel like I’m hibernating with my eyes open.”

She offered a sympathetic nod before scurrying off. Barry stared at his computer screen, where the cursor blinked mockingly. Could he really keep suppressing this part of himself forever? How long could he go on pretending to be the lovable, well-adjusted bear everyone expected him to be?

His eyes drifted to the motivational poster on the wall—“Hang in There,” featuring a frazzled-looking raccoon. Maybe it was time to figure out who he truly was, even if the forest might not accept him.

1htkn1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Viidith22/comments/1htkn1l/days_end_a_lucky_story/,Days end. A Lucky Story.,"The Air is hot and loud as the helicopter noisily thumps back to the base. The land grows larger and the people on it grow smaller as we gain altitude. Strapped to the seat in front of me is the young woman. She’s asleep despite the noise, with me choking her out so she wouldn’t jump off the bird to go and chase her boyfriend. At least he had some brains on him, taking off after getting bitten. I had to put two of his friends down, but we were in the air before I could finish him off. He won’t last the night.

Fuck.

How were there that many? I’ve only heard the stories of the other major cities, but seeing it was unreal. Thousands, maybe millions of them. Even as we get further away, I can still see them, the hordes. We’re hundreds of feet in the air, and the mass of bodies that stretches all the way back to the city looks like a river that has broken through its dam. Are they going to follow us? Are we even going to make it back to the base before some bullshit happens and we crash? Does it even matter? How long are we actually going to last before we end up just like everyone else in the platoon? Begging for my life as they give me my last lesson in human anatomy? It can’t just be me; I can’t be the only one who got out. Please don’t let it just be me. I hear a voice crackle over the radio. It’s the pilot.

“Hey specialist, wanna see some cool shit?”

As he says this, I see a giant formation of jets streak over the city, and 5 seconds later the horde begins to disappear in giant balls of white and orange flame. I hear the explosion a second later and the girl is startled awake, her eyes are wild as the blood enters her brain and she attempts to make sense of her environment. Before she can move, I place my hand on hers and squeeze it. She looks at me and I can see the recognition in her eyes. She slumps back into her seat and her eyes go distant.

We land at the base, and we leave the helicopter.

“Follow me” I say, and we walk towards the refugee camp.

“You said your name was Nicole, right?” I ask, trying to get some kind of human interaction. 

“Yes.” She responds, her voice numb from her trauma. 

“Ok, Nicole, we’re going to walk to check you in, you’re safe here.” 

She looks almost amused by this. Everybody at the camp knew it was a lie, there was nowhere that was truly safe in times like this, but it felt like if somebody were to tell the truth, that we were just biding time, running out of space until we either broke them or they broke us, then it would all fall apart.

We reach the tent and pass by two heavily armed soldiers as we enter.

“We got a civilian, she’s clean, no bites or signs of infection Sir.” I say, walking up to the desk of the Dr.

“And you are?”

“Specialist Morton, 4th platoon, Charlie company, 2nd Batt.” I say, going to attention. His eyebrows raise at this.

“We’ve had survivors coming in over the last few hours. Sounded like ya’ll had a hell of a time over there.”

“Respectfully sir, it was a clusterfuck. If I may, have you heard of anyone from 4th coming in?”

“If we’re being honest, I couldn’t tell you. I know that Lieutenant Mace came back, but other than you, there’s nobody.” 

A hole opens inside me. It begins to swallow me in my entirely.

“Understood sir.” I say as I stand there, a shell of the woman that I was prior to stepping into the tent.

“We’ll take her off your hands, keep up the good work specialist, go shower and return to your unit.”

I turn to Nicole. I can tell she’s nervous, but I can also see the strength beneath her. I realize that she was right there with me and had been living in the city for months. I can’t imagine what she’s seen...or done.

“If you wanna come talk or something I’m in building 6.” I say, extending my hand.

To my surprise she hugs me. It isn’t a normal hug. You usually feel something.

“I’m sorry.” she says, releases me and heads to the back.

After the medics check me for bites, I head back to the barracks. The building that was filled with laughter and colorful language a few hours earlier is now dead silent. I walk past the empty rooms and see the signs of habitation. Posters, Family Pictures, and other trinkets that gave the rooms life now laugh at me as I walk past them, showing me each and every person that was left in that alley while I was the one to make it back. I stop at a door. Stevens. I open it and see his cot, sheets thrown together to make it look like he made it, and perched neatly on top of his pillow is Reggie. I pick up the stuffed Trex and inspect it. He would sleep with it every night, cuddling it like a baby with his first toy.

I still remember how excited he was when he first got it.

“Dude she’s so fucking cool. Look at this thing.” as he holds it in my face and makes a loud screeching sound, giving consciousness to the prehistoric beanie baby.

“AT EASE” I hear Jobara shout as he heads out of the room and the space becomes dead silent. Broderick, our Platoon Seargent, saunters in, eyeballing each and every one of us as he walks through the room. He stops in front of Stevens and cocks a brow.

“Specialist.” He says, no emotion hinting at what kind of mood he’s in.

“Yes Seargent” Stevens says as beads of sweat form on his nose.

“What in the unholy fuck possessed you to make that noise?”

Stevens presents the toy like an animal being presented to a sacrificial altar.

“And where did you get that?”

“My Fiancé gave it to me. Today is our anniversary, Sergeant.”

Broderick snorts a laugh and then goes quiet.

“That better not go on mission.” He says with a grin.

“Air Assault, Seargent.” Stevens says, a smile growing on his face.

“Air Assault.” Broderick says and then exits the room to a chorus of the Air Assault chant.

We had met in OSUT, sticking it out as the drill sergeants thought of new and innovative ways to put the wood to us. He never broke. Not once. We then graduated and were in the same class at Air Assault school, blood pinning the wings onto each other, as neither of our families could make it to the graduation ceremony. We then received orders that we would be in the 101st, where we would serve together until today. We became best friends, helping each other through some truly tough situations. While we were never romantically involved, I wondered from time to time what it would be like to call him mine. Now that question will remain a question forever.

My reminiscing is soured by my short-term memory, as I see Stevens meeting his end, the desperate cry of rage and frustration as he’s overwhelmed on the tarmac and pieces of him start disconnecting from his body. He didn’t deserve that. Nobody did.

I take Reggie and head back to my room. I walk past Broderick’s room as well and I’m hit with another wave of loss. The man was hard, there’s no denying that, a soldier who had seen more combat in his 15 years. He was a killer, stone cold. But he also had his soft spots. When I couldn’t sleep, I would wander the barracks, and every night I could hear him reading books to his children over the phone, and then soothing his wife, telling him that he was ok, and he would be home soon. He never ended a call without telling his family how much he loved them. One night I heard him weeping and whispering.

“No. Please No.” over and over again. He wasn’t the same after that. His sense of humor was gone, and it seemed as if his soul had been taken from him. That was a week prior to the mission, and it suddenly made sense as to why he went out the way he did.

I make my way to the shower. I shed my gear, the mix of sweat salt and dried blood makes my plate carrier stick to my uniform, forcing me to put extra effort into taking it off. It lands on the ground with a clunk, and it feels as if a thousand pounds has been lifted from me. I peel off the rest of my clothes and hop into the scalding hot water. The water can’t get hot enough, despite my skin turning bright red at water beads reflecting off my flesh. I scrub and scrub, but it’s as if I pierce a layer of filth, it goes even deeper. I find myself getting more and more frustrated and I feel my hands begin to shake and my chest go tight. I feel the tears begin to well and stream down my face and I cry for the platoon, for each and every one of them that I will never see again, I cry for the civilians that I couldn’t help, I cry for Nicole and the guy who was bitten as he tried to climb the helicopter. I cry until it hurts, until I can’t feel it.

Eventually I leave the shower and head back to my room and redress. I hear a knock at the door.

“Specialist Morton?” I hear a voice from outside the door.

“Yes?” I say lacing my boots.

“It’s Lieutenant Mace, how are you holding up?”

Well, I’ll be goddamned. He really did make it. While he wasn’t my favorite officer, he was a good one, making sure that we were taken care of and in good spirits.

“Just fantastic sir, it’s a beautiful day out.” I say sarcastically as I open the door.

His eye is bandaged, and his arm is in a sling. He looks like hell but it’s still good to see him kicking.

“I just came to check in on you, Today was a shit show.” 

“I’m fully aware sir.”

“Did the civilian make it back to the tent alright?”

“Yeah, she should be fine.”

He stands there quietly and then looks at me.

“I was also sent to let you know that battalion commander wants to see us for a debrief, go eat some chow and I’ll meet you down in the TOC.”

""Not much to say, we got our asses kicked sir.""

""I said the same thing, but they want on ground accounts, and seeing as how we're the only ones to make it...""

The desk is shiny, and it feels like I’m waiting for an interrogation, all that’s missing is the hand cuffs. Across from me sits Lieutenant Colonel Winning, the battalion XO. She hasn’t slept in days, and she has no problem showing it. Dark circles make their mark on her face as she sips her coffee. The door opens and I shoot to attention as Colonel Bolte enters the room. He looks like he’s been carved from granite and stands strong, able to weather any storm.

“Relax specialist. Please take a seat. Can I get you some coffee?” he asks, motioning towards the pot behind him.

“That would be awesome sir.”

He sets the coffee in front of me and pours himself one and then we both sit down.

“I’m going to be honest with you specialist, it’s not every day that you lose a battalion, let alone in one day. We’re still getting scattered reports of survivors but as of right now you are one of the select few who was on the ground who is in any kind of condition to talk.” He says, pitching forward in his chair.

“I understand sir.”

“So, what happened?”

“Where should I start Sir?”

“The beginning.”

“Alright listen up” Mace says as he motions to a giant terrain model in the center of the dirt.

“This is live folks, we’re gonna head into the city and look for survivors, after our window is closed, we’re heading home and letting our Fisters have their play time with the Willy Pete.” He continues.

I hear Stevens whistle, which is silenced mid tune by a glare from Broderick that looks like it can set something on fire.

Mace then details the plan. Our battalion was tasked with making a small push into the city and securing a DMZ, allowing any survivors still in the city to evacuate before the city would be destroyed. We would be there over a 48-hour period and would have to hold them off while giving people time to make their way to us. It seemed like a good plan; we had an entire brigade, and we weren’t just some regular nasty girl wannabes. We were the 101st, the best of the best, especially at this kind of mission. We would be entering in a massive convoy, allowing us to keep the roads clear and allowing us to defend the airstrip with some pipe hitting armor assets and heavy weapons. Our company would be tasked with holding a road and our platoon providing security in the alleyways, giving a straight shot for the refugees to get straight to the airstrip.

“After the birds take off with the refugees, we load back up into our convoy and head home. We step off tomorrow morning. AIR ASSAULT.”

The route to the city is relatively clear. We Blast nine-inch nails over the intercoms to try and lure out any potential wandering roadblocks so we can clear them before they become a hazard. A few curious ones stumble into the road and Stevens takes murderous joy dispatching them with his 50 Cal, we watch as the rounds impact and they fall apart like Lego bricks. They become more condensed as we get closer to the city. It gets to the point where we have to dismount and clear them out. While the heavy weapons are doing their job, it doesn’t prevent the stress of the situation as more of them pour out of the buildings and shamble towards us.

“2 ON THE LEFT.” I hear Jabara shout and then open fire. They got too close and as he puts them down, his face is sprayed with blood as they fall.

He falls back into the platoon and another soldier, Blazto, takes his spot. We make very slow but steady progress as we make our way to the objective. After reaching the objective, we clear the surrounding buildings and start establishing our alley defenses. I’m part of the building detail, and my squad is tasked with clearing a 2-story apartment. Jabara takes points at the entrance, and we stack up. After counting down, Stevens kicks the door in, and we begin our clearing. The inside of the building is reminiscent of a butcher shop and blood is sprayed on the walls like a Jackson Pollock painting. We’re greeted by two in the hallway. A little girl with her arm missing, and an old man whose jaw is hanging on by the ligaments. They begin to shuffle towards us and are put down by Blazto who scores 2 well aimed headshots. The cycle continues as we move through the building. Apartment to Apartment, Room to room. I begin to notice that I’m starting to run low on ammo and swap with Raymond to clear the last room.

I tap Stevens on the shoulder “Hey you got any mags to spare?”

“Yeah, here you...”

I hear a blood curdling scream coming from the room and I run in. The sight is almost something I can’t comprehend. Raymond lays on his stomach and is straddled by a blonde woman. She’s taking bites out of his neck and has dug her finger into his eye to keep his head still. I aim and fire, and the woman goes still. Raymond has stopped screaming. I then see Winstone grappling with a teenage boy, who has him up against the wall, clawing at him. The boy reaches for his face and Winstone grabs his arm, spins behind him, and throws the boy onto his belly. As the boy tries to get to his feet, Winstone grabs his belt knife and drives into the boy’s skull over and over again until the body stops twitching. He then gets up and starts stomping on his head.

“PIECE. OF. SHIT. MOTHER. FUCKER.” He says, continuing until the size 10 hole has completely restructured the boy’s face.

Stevens throws the woman’s body off of Raymonds back and flips him over. His head is weighed down by his helmet and doesn’t move with the rest of his body. The woman chewed through enough of his neck that his head hangs on by a few strands of muscle and sinew. Winstone stands over his body and begins to scream at it.

“YOU STUPID FUCK. I TOLD YOU TO CHECK THOSE CORNERS. AND NOW...” Winstone makes a strange noise. A half laugh a half sob. A sound made of disbelief and sorrow.

“Goddamn it.” He says, taking his helmet off and running his hands through his hair. After he composes himself, he rips the dog tags off of Raymonds body and puts them in his pocket. Winstone radios in.

“Bad 7, this is Bad 3 over?”

“Go for Bad 7. Over.” I hear Broderick’s voice over the radio.

“Building is clear, 1 casualty. Over.”

“Who was it. Over?”

“Raymond. Over.”

“What’s his status. over?”

Theres a long pause and I see the antenna begin to shake as Winstone stares at Raymond’s body with a blank expression.

“What’s his status, Seargent?”

“KIA. Over.”

Another long pause. Raymond and Broderick were friends, with the older Seargent taking the private under his wing, showing him the ropes of the army. Raymond grew up with a single mother, and seeing Broderick as a sort of father figure, idolized him and struck up conversation with Broderick at every opportunity. Raymond was the youngest of the platoon, which led to a fair amount of hazing, but he was always in good humor, until Broderick got involved. He took that personally and was the only man that Raymond would take seriously. It didn’t matter now. The bright-eyed soldier with dreams and potential of going far now lied on his stomach with his head facing the wrong direction in a growing pool of his own blood.

“Roger. Rally with Bad 4 and return to the rendezvous. Out.”

An hour later, we’ve finished setting up our defenses in the alleyway. Sandbags, Concertina wire, and machine gun nests stand in the way and hold strong against the shambling horrors. They come in by the dozen only to be mowed down like tall grass against our platoon. Some of the guys have made games out of it. Placing bets to see who has the highest number of kills before we exfil, others begin to tell stories about them, making fantasies out of boredom. The longer we stay here the secret becomes louder. There isn’t anyone coming, and we’re all waiting and wasting ammo in a vain attempt to try and stop the unstoppable. What were we even doing here? Are we here to prove a point? To who? The commander? The president? The public? We should just pull out and start the bombardment early. We already have the 120s going to town, striking into the center of the city with airburst rounds to weaken the strength of the hordes in the center of the city as they make their way towards the noise of the DMZ. It creates a sort of rhythm. The gentle thump. Choonk Choonk Choonk. And then the explosions follow 30 seconds later. Boom. Boom. Boom.

“We’re almost out of here, stay steady, check your mags and make sure you and your teams are switching off every 30 minutes.” I hear Broderick call to the platoon, which is met with a chorus of “Air Assault.”

I hear a commotion at the front.

“We got 4 more coming in.” I hear Jabara yell.

“DON’T SHOOT. WE AINT ONE OF THEM.” I hear a voice scream from the end of the alley.

At first, I don’t think I hear correctly and then a minute later I hear my name.

“MORTON.” Broderick screams

“Yes Seargent?” I ask and head up to the front.

I almost can’t believe my eyes. In front of us stand 4 living people. 2 men and 2 women, they look young, maybe my age. A stocky, muscular blonde man with a mane of unkempt hair down to his shoulders stands beside a tall lankier brunette with short, cropped hair, his hand is bandaged, and he walks with a slight limp as they approach us. Behind them stand 2 women, a short blonde with piercing blue eyes and a much taller brunette, white knuckling the revolver in her hand and staring daggers at us.

“Take these people behind the barricade and go check them for bites.” Broderick says,

“Roger sergeant, please follow me” I say beckoning for them to follow.

I take Stevens with me, and we walk behind the line.

“We need to check for signs of infection. I’m going to take the ladies; Specialist Stevens here is going to check the men.” I face the ladies.

“Please follow me.” I turn around and show Stevens my hand and nod back at the taller man. He nods as I pass and moves towards them.

“You’re going to need to undress, and I’m going to need to check you for bites.”

They obey without question, and I begin my search. It’s apparent that they’ve both lost weight. While not emaciated, they’ve definitely had to cut out the food. I notice a tattoo on the back of the brunette’s arm. o vos pusillae fidei.

“What’s that mean?” I say pointing at it.

“Ye of Little faith.” She speaks.

“That’s badass.” I say with a smile.

They both return it, seeing that my comment put them at ease. They redress and we head back to meet with Stevens. They’re all standing and laughing.

While Stevens watches them, I radio Winstone for orders.

“Keep em at the CCP, we’ll take em back with us when we exfil. Out.”

I turn to the group.

“Ok check it, we’re gonna...”

My radio crackles to life

“HOLY SHIT.” Which is followed by the 240-opening fire.

I turn to see the commotion. Oh my god. There has to be over 200 of them pushing into the alley.

“THERES TOO MANY OF THEM” I hear another scream, Followed by more gun fire.

“PULL BACK, WE ARE LEAVING.” I hear Broderick shout, but it’s too late.

Despite them getting caught on the concertina wire, despite them being mowed down by the double digits, they reach the barricade, stepping over their dead and collapsing the sandbags under the combined weight of the tidal wave of the shambling, gurgling, Dead.

They don’t just come from the front, but also the sides, and soon we are cut off from the rest of the platoon as they are surrounded.

I then begin to see my friends fall. Jabara puts round after round into them, and he is the first to go down. They start at his legs and work their way up. He begins to scream.

“MOMMY. MOMMY MAKE THEM STOP. OH GOD THEYRE EATING ME, MO-“ He’s cut off as they make it to his head and silence him forever.

Winstone is next. Kicking one back into the horde until a Massive one shoves him into the wall and begins to remove his organs. He shoots the muscular bastard in the face and then collapses. He meets my eyes, smiles, puts the gun in his mouth, and paints the brick wall with his thoughts and feelings as more fall on top of him. Others meet their end in similar fashion. Blazto recites the Nicaean creed as he’s overwhelmed. I see Mace get crushed against the wall and his eye pulled out of his socket. I then see Broderick.

He has turned his body into a weapon. He puts two in the little girl in front of him with his rifle and wheels to put down an old lady. His rifle clicks and in on fluid motion turns his empty weapon into a hammer, which he uses to deconstruct the woman’s head. He drops the rifle and hip tosses a little boy, steps on his head and wheels around to drive his knife into the head of a naked woman with enough force that her eyeball pops out of its socket. I then see one take a bite out of his wrist, and another take a bite from his ankle. The weight of the horde takes him to his back. I see him kick one off and I witness his final moments as he pulls the grenade pin from his vest and laughs.

“I’M GOING MY WAY YOU FUCKS.” As he turns himself and everyone around him into jelly.

We run to the DMZ and the last of my hope dies with a whimper. I’m not sure the comprehension power of the human brain is made to see this many people at once.

I switch the comms to the open channel and hear absolute anarchy. An orchestra of screams, cries, orders, and prayers fill the air as I try to make heads or tails of the sight. Many of the platoons are isolated, holed up in tents or trying to make last stands in their foxholes and fortifications that quickly become mass graves. I see a pilot hop out of his cockpit and make an escape from the tarmac. His destination becomes unclear as he sprints past two more helicopters and into the open ground. He makes it to the top of a hill, where they corner him. I’ve seen enough.

I then hear a thumping and look to the opposite end of the tarmac; I don’t believe my eyes. It’s a lone black hawk, and the motors are beginning to take flight.

“We’re gonna make a run for it, stay behind me.”

We take off at a dead sprint towards the lone bird and I hail them on the radio.

“Bird 47, keep on the ground, I’m on the way.” I say breathlessly, becoming aware of how much my plate carrier weighs.  


“Who the hell is on the net.” A voice crackles over the radio.

“6 survivors, en route to your black hawk”

“We can hold it for maybe 5 minutes tops, get your asses over here.”

I see 2 of them step in front of our path as we pass through the gate, I switch my rifle to full auto and dump a full magazine into them, and we keep sprinting as they twitch on the ground.

I hear a crash behind me and a yelp. I wheel around to see Stevens as one of the ones on the ground trips him and the other puts her hand into his mouth and pulls. It seems like his face is almost torn off as the woman rips through his cheek and then bites his nose off. He pulls away, takes his helmet off and proceeds to hit her in the head until the dent in her skull becomes a crater and begins to work on the other one.

What’s left of his face looks up as I begin to run back towards him.

“RUN” He barks and then howls as a man comes and starts taking pieces from him. The blonde puts a bullet in the man’s head but then runs off as the others began to envelope him.

I turn and leave my best friend. The man who knew me better than anyone. The man who used to carry me back into my room when I was too drunk to walk. I remember the last words his fiancé said to me in the back of my mind.

“You need to stay safe; he’ll die for you if you’re in danger, please bring him back to me.”

I keep running. I gasp and struggle to breathe, my muscles burn, but I keep running. I’ve started to gap the survivors but they’re still keeping pace. I then hear screaming, and gunshots and I turn to see the blonde man and woman being eaten alive as they make a desperate attempt to reach for each other. I breathe out. Line the dot of my sight up with their heads and cease their suffering in 2 bangs. The taller man is frozen stiff at the sight, and me and the other woman have to drag him until his spell is broken. We make it to the helicopter as it begins to leave the ground. The man picks the woman up and throws her into the helicopter as I hop in. He grabs the hand holds when a morbidly obese man appears to his left and takes a bite out of him. The man wheels around and punches the man so hard that the chunk of his shoulder flies out of his mouth. He then flashes a smile and runs off. The woman starts screaming and begins to try and leave as we take off. I hold her down and she punches me dead in the jaw. I cross my arms, grab her collar, and lean left. She stops screaming and slumps back into her seat.

“That’s quite the story specialist.” Lieutenant Colonel Winning says.

“It’s true ma’am.”

“No doubt, you’re incredibly lucky that you made it back in one piece.” The Colonel says.

I struggle to hold back a laugh. Lucky.

“That’s all we need from you right-“Winning is interrupted by air raid sirens and red flashing lights.

The door bursts open.

“Sir, they’ve breached the outer wall. We need to evacuate.” A private says out of breath.

They rush out of the room, and I follow. I exit the tent and am greeted by thousands of the screaming dead, clawing at the quickly failing gates and crumbling walls. The foxholes are holding strong, but I learned today that their time is Finite. I sprint back to the barracks and grab my gear and weapon and rush back out. They’re pouring into the base by the hundreds. Many are mowed down by the Humvees who drive up to the entrance and unload their 50 Cals into the horde.

I feel a burning sensation in my neck and look down to see blood covering my shoulder. I turn around to see Lieutenant Mace, chewing on my missing piece. He lunges again but this time I move out of the way and put three in his face. I cover the wound in my neck and notice that the blood that leaks out of the wound has suddenly gotten darker, quickly turning black. I will not change. I will not become one of them. I whisper it like a mantra as I walk back to my room. I pick up Reggie and hold him in my chest. I can feel the warmth leaving my body and an insatiable hunger take hold. I laugh as I unholster my pistol and place it in my mouth.

\- CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 3600 6-Core Processor 3.59 GHz  
\- 16GB Installed RAM

*This is fan-cooled, 3 intakes 2 on the heatsink, 1 outlet, often air dust it twice a year, including doing so to see if it was a buildup of dust creating the issue, nope.*

**The Issue Itself**

I believe this issue started around early Autumn of this year. I've had the PC itself since around late 2019, so a good 5 years, not had to really adjust anything. I currently have a dual-monitor set-up. I don't believe they're the issue as issues began to happen before I even got both set up, before then I was even able to run Space Marine 2 without many issues before the issue just started occurring.

If I am running something on a browser, say a video on youtube, a low-demanding game like Rimworld, Spacehaven, Scavenger SV-4, Brighter Shores, OSRS, *etc*. No issues, even with those two together and Discord VC. However, the moment I decide to try and run anything that generally is more demanding like the Deadspace Remaster, Hardspace Shipbreaker, Space Marine 2, Valheim *etc*, unless I run them on the lowest settings possible it *usually* is fine, more likely though if the game is generally more demanding than another. The issue will usually take a few minutes, no more than 10-15, sometimes it will run just fine framerate-wise, sometimes not (Example of Deadspace Remaster being that if I went beyond low, Framerate will dip into the mid 20's).

The actual issue begins with both of the screens suddenly just stop as if paused, whatever audio is playing is distorted and amplified, even if said audio seems to continue but slows down, sounds robotic almost. Pressing anything doesn't seem to cause any feedback, mouse doesn't move. Friends I've been in VC when it happens state that I go silent but don't actually leave the call. Even went to get a coffee and use the restroom to see if it'd fix itself, no luck. Temps tend to be a bit warmer when my hand is near its outlet, unrelated temp gauge I have generally states that it's only a few degrees warmer than the room's ambient temp, highest ever was about 4c higher. Also no, I generally am very good at not going on sites that are dodgy and often get testimonials (usually from friends) before even thinking about downloading anything not well-known about.

My only real solution as it stands is quite literally to turn it off in one way or another, even the PC's button works, give it a good few seconds, then it starts up again like nothing happened. Which essentially means, the same issues will eventually reoccur if I try to continue what I was doing and will follow the same process. I *cannot* play any of the more demanding games, including a lot of multiplayer games, as well as Baldur's Gate 3, which I feel really bad about as my friend got that for me as a Christmas present too and is *expensive* given their situation.

**Advice?**

If anything, I'm looking for some advice on steps to take to either troubleshoot the issue down to what it actually could be or actually is; I've done some really basic ones, including making more room for my SSD, which seems redundant as only half of it is holding data, verifying games' integrity, making sure I update various drivers, but likely not everything. So practical advice on that front would be appreciated. Videos from people like Linus Tech Tips or similar would be appreciated, but I feel this is somewhat a unique issue, especially since I can't really fuck around in the PC's internals.

I am also incredibly aware that compared to my PCs components, they are a gen or two old. Is it possible it could be just age and that I need to just fork out the money and get it upgraded? I believe my GPU when I first got it was reasonably priced but on the higher end of what was available at the time.

1htkloa,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1htkloa/is_it_normal_to_be_like_strangers_with_my/,Is it normal to be like strangers with my partner's best friend?,"I'm struggling to find peace with this issue. I'm 34f, my partner 32m is diagnosed autistic. We have a 1 yo child together, live together and have been together for 3 years now. Recently my partner's best friend since highschool (32m) got engaged to his girlfriend of 4-5 years. Since it's the holiday season I suggested catching up and getting together, since I have met his besties girlfriend only once at a birthday dinner. Supposedly she is the introverted type too but we have things in common: travel and photography. My partner and his friend are both introverted/diagnosrd autistic so usually they only catch up in person a handful of times a year, and usually just get coffee 1 on 1 or something, since they live about 45 mins drive away and are always in a group chats for their hobbying group. Regardless they are always messaging each other whether its their private or group chat. (I've brought up this issue in the past as it bothers me when he went through a period of constantly ignoring me during mealtimes to look at his phone, responding to messages and laughing at jokes). 

Our son recently had his first birthday party a week ago and my partner didn't want to invite any of his friends from the group chats because they are all on the spectrum and ""it's not something they are interested in"", his best friend included.


After the party I suggested to my partner to take the opportunity to do something with his best friend during holidays before going back to work, so he reached out to arrange something. His best friend only wanted to do something super early in the morning, near his house, on his terms. I asked if I should come along to hang out with his friends partner, or to bring the baby, but it's not encouraged at all, would be uncomfortable etc. I asked if his friend might come to our place or in our direction since we have baby as well and the travel time makes it a longer appointment, but no we dont have the right set up at our house for what they want to do. Ultimately I expressed my unhappiness about spending my last day of holidays alone with the baby so that he could fulfill this friend date. I feel bad because it was my idea in the first place (i am much more social than my partner so im always making suggestions worried that he will miss his friends). He ended up cancelling his friend date to appease me but I am still resentful about feeling excluded, and he probably is resentful too although he assures me that the idea of socialising in person is more important to me than it is to him.

It's been 3 years together and I am a stranger with my partner's best friend, and their now fiance. I added his best friend on Facebook a year ago and have met in person 3 times but only chatted to them twice. They seem pretty alternative and introverted so maybe they'll only have a small wedding. My partner is likely gonna be the best man, if there is one - I just can't imagine being invited to their wedding because it's liek I barely know them and they have met our baby only once. 

 Is this normal for autistic types to completely separate their friend and family life? I feel like a crazy person for continuing to encourage my partner to create a social situation for us to interact, I don't want to pressure him but it seems like he is ashamed of me or something. Or is he just scared of the social awkwardness of worlds colliding? I feel like he is hiding part of himself from me and this avoidant behaviour isn't helpful now that our baby is growing up. I just want to have a network of friends and family for our own little family moving forward and I don't know how to get his best friend in on that.

I've joined this sub because I want to understand my partner's point of view better, instead of forcing my way all the time. Any advice is appreciated, just needing to vent.

Sharp knocks on the door jolted Ben from his sleep and he groaned, pressing the hotel’s lumpy pillows over his ears, and called out, “No room service please!”

“Come on!”, an impatient female voice called out from the hallway.

Ben squinted at the ancient hotel alarm clock on his nightstand: 8:34AM. He muttered a curse. Check-out wasn’t supposed to be until eleven. He made a mental note to leave a scathing review. Not that he ever would.

He finally dragged himself out of bed and swung open the door, dressed in nothing but a t-shirt and boxers.

“Allison?”, he asked, dumbfounded. She stood there, suitcase in tow, looking thoroughly annoyed. She was dressed in black leggings and a blue t-shirt and her dark brown hair was in a ponytail and not down. But still, he recognized her immediately.

She brushed past him without a word, as if she belonged there, “Took you long enough.”

Ben wiped his eyes with the back of his hand, as he closed the door behind her, “Well, sorry I didn’t roll out the red carpet for you but sure, make yourself at home, I guess.”

Allison plopped herself onto on his unmade bed and exhaled, “Sorry about that, I just didn’t want Jason to see me in the hallway.”

“Jason?”, Ben echoed, still groggy.

She looked at Ben as if he were an idiot, “My ex. The one you told me to break up with.”

“Yeah, that was, like, eight hours ago. You dumped him already? Please tell me you didn’t do it on the dance floor. I *specifically* advised against that” 

“No, I was patient. I waited until the morning,” she said, unapologetic. “But obviously he’s not going to give me a ride back to the city now so it looks like you’re stuck with me.” 

She shot him a pointed look, “You are going to help me find my soulmate now, right? You’re not the kind of man who goes back on his word?”

Ben rolled his eyes, “No need for the dramatics, I said I’d help you so I’ll help you. I just wasn’t expecting it to be so soon.”

“Are you busy or something?” she asked, her gaze sweeping the room and lingering on the empty minibar bottles scattered everywhere. “Jesus, aren’t those, like, insanely expensive? You *are* rich.”

“I’m on vacation,” he said, crossing his arms defensively. Even to his own ears, he sounded lame.

“Sooner we start, the sooner you get rid of me,” she said with a smirk,

“That’s the most convincing argument you’ve made yet,” He said, reluctantly returning her grin, “Fine, give me ten minutes to pack but you’re buying me breakfast before we hit the road.”

""Deal,"" Allison said, thrusting out her hand with exaggerated formality. Ben shook it, suppressing a grin. For a guy whose deals usually came with contracts full of carefully negotiated legalese and a stack of signatures, the simplicity of a handshake felt almost laughable—and a little bit unsettling.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Allison wobbled the laminated menu in front of her, “This is so exciting. I can’t believe I’m actually going to meet my soulmate soon. I wonder what he’ll be like.”

“Yeah, yeah, it’s thrilling” Ben muttered, rubbing his stubble. He’d barely had time to brush his teeth, let alone shave, thanks to Allison’s rush this morning. He flipped through the seemingly endless options, “Just so you know, as punishment for waking me up so early, I’m getting the most expensive thing on the menu.”

Allison smirked, “If you want to order the lobster at a diner at nine in the morning, be my guest.”

Ben audibly gagged at the thought, and Allison burst out laughing—a warm, deep laugh that, despite being at his expense, Ben found himself wanting to hear again.

The waitress, an older woman, came by and poured them some coffee, “What would you like?”

“Two eggs sunny side up with white toast”, Ben said.Allison flashed the woman a smile, “What would you recommend?”

The waitress glared at her, as if trying to figure out whether Allison was playing a joke at her expense or something, but then flatly stated, “Pancakes.”

Allison returned the menu, “Perfect, thanks!” In the harsh diner lighting, with her makeup slightly smudged from sleeping in it, she looked more real somehow - and just as pretty.

As soon as the waitress left, Ben leaned in, “What kind of weirdo asks for recommendations at a diner?”

Allison shrugged, “I do. Decisions aren’t really my thing. You should see me in a grocery store, standing there looking at the twenty different pasta sauces, until I just leave without getting anything.” She paused for a second, “Kind of pathetic, I guess.”

“Could have fooled me”, Ben said, “You made the decision to break up with your boyfriend of three years pretty easily.”

Allison laughed, but this time there was a bitter edge to it, “Oh that wasn’t my first time breaking up with him. I’ve dumped him like a dozen times but we always get back together.”

She stared at Ben with intensity, “But today was the last time because once I meet my soulmate, that’ll be it.”

Ben took a sip of his coffee, “You know just because someone is your soulmate, it doesn’t mean it’s automatically going to work out. All I’m promising is to deliver you to whoever is at the end of your string. I don’t want you to be pissed at me if he’s not the man of your dreams.”

Allison didn’t look concerned, “I don’t care if he’s the man of my dreams. I don't trust my dreams. I’d rather trust fate.”

Ben sighed, “Fine. But do you even have your passport with you? What if your soulmate really is in Antarctica?” 

Allison smiled, “Yup, in my luggage. I always bring my passport with me just on the chance that I decide to be impulsive and fly to Paris or something.”

“And have you, ever, once in your life flown to Paris on a whim?” Ben asked, even though he felt like he already knew the answer.

“Nope,” Allison said, without shame. “But maybe I will now. Maybe my soulmate is a smooth talking French man who cooks croissants and shit.”

Ben grinned, “You don’t cook croissants, you bake them.”

Allison rolled her eyes, “Whatever, he can teach me the difference from our bed in *Pah-ree*.””

“Sure,” Ben said as their food came.

Allison smiled, her eyes sparkling, “Let’s eat quickly. I can’t wait to hit the road.” Without thinking, she grabbed Ben’s hand and squeezed. “This is so fucking exciting!”

1htkk8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/dysautonomia/comments/1htkk8q/adrenaline_dump_while_driving/,Adrenaline Dump While Driving,"Edit: added clarification 

Yesterday I had to go to my doctor to do Orthostatic Vitals. My doctor is located within a hospital, and it’s about a 45 minute drive. 

Yesterday I woke up not feeling great. I walked my dog, and climbing the one flight of stairs while going back to my apartment was rough. I fed my dog and then shuffled to my bed and laid down. I began to feel better after laying down. 

After about 35 minutes, I got up and got ready to drive to the doctor. I usually take 25mg of metoprolol tartrate in the AM only. I opted to not take the dose, but I put the pill in my purse so I had it with me and planned on taking it after thr vitals. 

Within a couple minutes of starting my drive I began feeling crappy again. I noticed my heart rate was very high, I felt loopy, lightheaded, weak and just out of it. The symptoms got a little better, for maybe a minute or so, and then it came back. I felt like I was struggling to stay conscious. 

I rolled down the windows of my car, thinking the freezing cold air cold help with my symptoms. For the next 30 minutes or so, I continued to have the extremely high heart rate, still feeling loopy, a little confused or out of it, a little weak too. Every time I told myself, enough is enough just pull over and call an ambulance, then the symptoms would get a little better and I felt like I could keep going. So I kept going. 

There was at least 2-3 moments where I felt that hot rush around my head and sudden rush of significant lightheartedness and I was absolutely convinced I was about to pass out. I noticed that when the symptoms surged, my vision would narrow a big, my hearing would be diminished, and I just wasn’t functioning well. Like, I was driving and no one was honking at me for poor driving or anything, I was not swerving or anything like that at all. But I felt like I was going a bit slower than most, but it was the best I could do. It felt like a bad dream. 

And then, about 10 minutes out from the hospital, I gave in and dug the metoprolol pill out of my purse. I had no water. So I chewed it a bit and tried to swallow the large-ish crumbs. I was getting closer to the hospital and the symptoms began to subside and I started feeling extremely shakey like I’d consumed a gallon of coffee. I knew that the shakey symptom usually starts as the episode is coming to an end, so I was able to convince myself that I’m fine and keep going.

My plan was to disregard the appointment with my doctor and drive up to the emergency room instead. But by the time I entered the hospital grounds, I felt like I was well enough to park and go to the doctors clinic and that what I did. 

Walking into the hospital I felt really weak, still out of it (kinda like you’d taken sleep pills and were trying to fight it). The nurse took me to an exam room and I immediately told her what just happened to me. I sat and explained everything and I got emotional because I was so scared. 

The nurse was nice but she kept asking me about my stress and anxiety level and if anything stressful is going on etc. I told her, no I’m not stressed, this isn’t anxiety etc. 

After about 10 minutes or so, she strapped the BP cuff on and the pulse thingy. My heart rate was about 105. My BP was normal. (By this time, the metoprolol dose would have been taken about 25 prior ish). My heart rate stayed in the low 100’s. 

Then she has me stand up and she did the readings again. It took a few tries to get the BP reading, the machine was acting up. My heart rate was around 115 then, maybe a bit higher. 

Then she had my lay down and again my BP really didn’t change but my heart rate lowered to the upper 90’s. I only laid down for a minute or less. 

She messaged the doctor and I waited about 10 minutes to see him. I explained the episode that happened while I was driving in. And he too went straight to anxiety and panic. I told him I disagree and that I think it’s something else and I think it’s related to the frequent bouts of lightheartedness and dizziness when I stand up from a seated position. 

His plan is to: have me test my blood sugar when I’m feeling these symptoms. He had Labwork done for thyroid and something else. And then, if those results are all normal, then he wants to send me to cardiologist to see what they can do. 

He’s not interested in diagnosing me with dysautonomia or POTS because he says those diagnoses only describe the problem and doesn’t explain the cause and he wants to find the cause. 

So my heart rate is still high, even with the metoprolol. But my BP is good on metoprolol. He’s concerned that if I increase metoprolol, then my BP would be too low. Also, I have an issue with my left eye (small cup to disc ratio) and the eye doctors don’t want me to take blood pressure meds in the evening. So the doctor says I’m limited in how I can treat these symptoms. 

I should have pulled over while driving, but I was so scared and so determined to get to the hospital. I wholeheartedly do not believe that this episode was anxiety or panic related. Maybe panic made things worse, but the underlying symptoms were not anxiety related, I just don’t believe that at all. Something else is going on. 

I wish I hadn’t taken that dose of metoprolol while driving in. Now I have no idea if the episode was directly linked to the metoprolol or if the episode was almost over on its own and the metoprolol had no impact on the episode, but definitely controlled my BP during the Orthostatic vitals appointment. 

I feel exhausted and defeated. I don’t trust my body.

So, here I am, giving it another shot, because while being alone is peaceful, it would be nice to share that peace with the right person. Fingers crossed—here’s to meeting someone worth the second try on this platform!",11,1736014633.0,reddmatch,22,0.82,False

Are there any websites or apps that would allow me to find (and ideally book) working spaces in the city, I've come across Croissant (getcroissant.com) and Coworker (coworker.com), but they seem geared to co-working spaces specifically and also seem to be fairly expensive. I was thinking more ""cosy coffee shop"" type of places (but it could be hotel lobby, co-working spaces too etc) that I could stay in for a small fee (equivalent of a 3/4 cups of coffee) or free!

If anyone has any suggestions that would be great!!! Thanks",0,1736014435.0,digitalnomad,4,0.5,False

They make my kids happy. The store is 5 mins away. I don't want flowers often. My birthday, anniversary or if something special comes up. I love these bouquets. When I get them for myself bc my birthday has come and gone, my husband will get pissed saying I took away his opportunity. But there are other things like when I went back to work or had a medical issue that could have used a little cheering up. When I complain, he tells me money is tight and he has no time. He does work A LOT. But it's a 4 min drive from his shop and he has time to get coffee in the mornings. And over the past couple years.....he hasn't had an extra $5 or 10 mins to get me flowers? I don't like fancy expensive flowers. I just like this $5 bouquet. I don't know why but they're my favorite and I see them all the time when I go shopping. Its a quirk and maybe bc of my adhd, I fixate. He doesn't like to ""give in"". I have literally cried my eyes out begging. He's so generous with everyone. We've spent hours upon hours harping on these damn flowers that sometimes when I see them in the store, I get sad. Something that is my favorite just makes me feel like I'm so unworthy.

1htkfyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1htkfyo/partner_of_10_years_having_an_emotional_affair/,Partner of 10~ years having an emotional affair with former coworker,"Throwaway and sorry if this is somehow too long and not detailed enough because I'm trying to make sense of everything myself so it's hard to make sense of it for other people.

I (31f) have been with my partner J (35f) for over a decade. Like all LTRs, it has had rocky points but has mostly been great and I have felt safe, loved, and supported. A couple of years ago, my partner took an office job and met N (26F). They grew close and bonded over shitty coworkers and I was initially supportive. J is introverted and doesn't have a large support network so I was excited to see her growing. We would hang out with N together and then slowly J and N hung out more and more during work and outside of work one on one.

As they god closer, I started feeling uncomfortable and asked for reassurance because of their friendship dynamic and my previous relationship trauma. For a while, I got that. Then it seemed like all at once they were water in my hands. A year ago, J left the office job and N got another job an hour away so I thought the friendship would probably fizzle out, especially when N told us she had gotten married and didn't tell or invite anyone. But they continued to talk and eventually hung out again at a coffee shop between our two cities to catch up about once a month.

Six months ago, I found a letter from N to J from around when N moved away saying she could always reach out and that their relationship felt like ""a slow-burning courtship"". Again, I tried to give the benefit of the doubt and chalked my reaction up to echos of previous trauma. Then she came home from one of their coffee meetings just before Christmas and another letter fell out of her jacket. She was cagey about it and I just *knew.* On New Years Eve, I went into her jacket and the letter was still there. This one talked about how N wanted to remind J that she deserved a relationship with ""kindness and peace"" and someone who ""would go out of their way for them"" and ""be intimate"" as well as ""general thoughtfulness and respect"". I went through her desk and found six more letters. Some of them are benign and some of them talk about tender touches and N being grateful for J's restraint.

I confronted J about the letter in her coat and did not tell her I have seen and read the others. She said she wouldn't care if I got letters like that, it wouldn't bother to read about herself like that, and she doesn't know how to convince me nothing is going on. But I'm not fucking stupid. I know what the bounds of our relationship are and that those have been transgressed and that's cheating. I know the 11 steps of emotional affairs and how fair down in them she is. I know I am lucky if this is just an emotional affair and even that isn't something to be grateful for. What I don't know is how to bring up these other letters and the very clear intentions in them because I can't make her not lie to me and I can't make that not be devastating. I don't know where to go from here.

I'm taking our dog and staying at a friend's tonight to figure things out and appreciate guidance from you all.",4,1736014396.0,survivinginfidelity,1,0.84,False
1htkfar,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1htkfar,Profitec OEM Bottomless Portafilter - quite nice!,"I have no need for a bottomless portafilter - I’m very much a fan of spouts. However, my sister asked what I wanted for Xmas and I said surprise me. I think I may have mentioned coffee equipment in the past so I am now the owner of Profitec OEM bottomless portafilter!

First thing I did was switch the handle to the walnut one and it looks lovely! Build quality seems fine - maybe not as robust as the portafilters that came with my machine.  

Not sure how often I’ll use it - maybe just when guests come round. Has anyone tried the silicone spouts that come with the new Move machine?

In the meantime, I am looking to sell the original black handle and the 21g basket that came with it. They have never been used and will just end up sitting in a drawer. If you are interested, drop me a line and we can discuss price and postage. I am based in London, UK. ",1,1736014348.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Limiting factor the last few days has been muscle pain with post op recovery NOT shortness of breath. 
Wonderful! 
My husband and I were out for a walk to the local coffee shop. We were sitting having an in depth conversation and he stopped mid sentence…
He said “I don’t know how to say this: Your brain seems to be working better. Do you think it’s increased oxygen?”
I wasn’t offended - it’s true! 
I knew I had been having frustrating “brain fog” and my brain had been working slower - harder to be as analytical or come up with positions or background connections for in depth conversations. We both realized we hadn’t talked like this in way too long. 
Neither of us could place when the decline started - but, boy did it feel good to realize the drast improvement in just a few days!

1htkds0,https://i.redd.it/hksnybjmp0be1.jpeg,Adding room midway through build…,"We have 100 more sq ft we are allowed to build on our house (it’s technically an ADU so we have restrictions). Having just hosted Christmas, I’m regretting our 2 bedroom design:

One master bedroom, and one additional multipurpose hobby+guest+office room. It feels like a downgrade from our current home, where we have a dedicated guest room. As an adult, it’s so nice to visit someone’s home and be a in a real guest room. 

We are in phase one of our build, meaning my husband and crew just completed pouring the foundation. We have a monolithic slab foundation. 

My husband is rightfully very unhappy about my request and saying absolutely not. However, we are not that far into the build. This room wouldn’t need any utilities, and there any plumbing walls nearby. I think we should do it now. I realize it should have been done before but we thought our budget was more limited. 

Is it possible to add a room? What difficulty is entailed? My husband would have to do the addition himself, which he is qualified/able to do, but would be big nuisance. I’ve drawn red circle around blue square, which is the added room that I envision.",0,1736014237.0,Homebuilding,7,0.5,False
