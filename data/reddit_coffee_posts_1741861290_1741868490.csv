I take my basal just before I sleep every night and it sits at a lovely 5mmol all night but as I wake up around 5.30 for work as you can see it just rises and rises, the only thing I had in this entire graph this morning was water and black coffee. 

It's extremely frustrating to not eat anything and then check your bloods 3 hours later to find they're sitting at 9mmol for seemingly no reason, I understand the body releases glucose because you're up and moving but why has it only started recently? it makes no sense.

I stick to mostly a keto diet so not many carbs most of the time, I exercise 6 days a week for around 1 1/2 hours a day because if I don't my insulin resistance gets ridiculously bad.

I've tried everything like not having caffeine, eating carbs before bed, eating breakfast, I'm usually quite good with my tracking and diabetes but these spikes are really starting to frustrate me, the only thing I can think of is injecting fast acting when I wake up which I absolutely hate doing since I put weight extremely easy.

I have 1300 hours of CI and I am on vacation on Lanzarote in the Canary Islands. The last post was when the airline lost my reservation for my flight out of here and I had to rebook over the phone with a ticket agent who spoke no English.

Frankly that was enough excitement for one trip, but it was not the end. This morning my son starts yelling ‚ÄúDad come quick, Mom is locked in the bedroom.‚Äù There is no lock on the door, it appeared the latching mechanism was broken. I took it apart but couldn‚Äôt get it open. My wife was trapped with no food, no water and NO BATHROOM.

The landlord was away on vacation. I called the backup number and spoke to another guy with no English. 50 minutes later my wife was free and the guy even complimented me on my Spanish.

I know it is hard to believe that a method this simple actually works but it does.  Now I am a CI purist but before discovering the research of Stephen Krashen I tried other methods. I took a semester of Spanish in college and I had a Duolingo streak of 2254 days. Not a typo: two thousand two hundred and fifty four days. After all that I could barely order a cup of coffee. Once I realized that CI was the real deal, I walked away from that streak without a second thought.

And in case you are wondering, when you can‚Äôt pop the latch with a credit card, try a hacksaw blade. That‚Äôs what worked for us.

1ja9r8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novelnews/comments/1ja9r8j/the_ceos_miracle_quadruplets_novel/,The CEO‚Äôs Miracle Quadruplets Novel,"Emmeline Louise had just turned on the shower when a large hand clapped over her mouth from behind, preventing her from crying out, and she was forced to the ground.

¬†

After that, her assailant forced himself upon her and had his way‚Ä¶

¬†

Emmeline wanted to scream for help, but all she could manage were whimpers and moans. The man behind her was far too strong and overpowered her; she could hardly breathe.

¬†

It did not take very long before her legs turned to jelly, and her head began to spin. The shower was still on, and her damp skin was as smooth and slippery as silk.

¬†

‚ÄúHow dare you! I‚Äôll kill you!‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWhat are you resisting for? You wanted me to do that, didn‚Äôt you? Well, I‚Äôm just fulfilling your wishes!‚Äù The man growled fiercely with no signs of stopping. Instead, he grabbed Emmeline and turned her around, taking her from the front instead.

¬†

Before she could get a glimpse of her assailant, he had thrown a towel over her face, preventing her from identifying him.

¬†

Throughout the entire incident, she was unable to see who he was.

¬†

When he was finally finished with her, the man tossed a bank card onto the ground. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the one who drugged me, but I won‚Äôt use that as an advantage. Here‚Äôs ten million as compensation for taking your virginity!‚Äù

¬†

The door slammed shut, and the man strode out.

¬†

Emmeline lay inside the bathtub, unable to move. Who the hell was that man? Why had he decided that she was the one who had drugged him?

¬†

Later on, when she checked with the hotel‚Äôs front desk, she discovered that they had no records of such a person, and even the surveillance records had been obliterated. The only identifying information she had came from the bank card itself; the cardholder was someone named Abel Ryker!

¬†

Emmeline‚Äôs attempts to trace this Abel Ryker fellow led her to the Ryker Group, but the reception desk told her that Mr. Ryker had been out of the country for some time. No one had been able to get in contact with him.

¬†

Emmeline stood in a daze, clutching the bank card that held ten million dollars in its account. She had no way of knowing if the man who assaulted her was indeed the cardholder.

¬†

Searching the internet for his whereabouts proved futile.

¬†

This man had robbed her of her virginity just like that and vanished into thin air as if he had never existed. The whole thing was like a nebulous dream.

¬†

However, reality soon intruded with a vengeance because Emmeline discovered that she was pregnant!

¬†

Her wealthy middle-class family was thrown into complete uproar! Emmeline‚Äôs father upbraided her and cursed the day she was born, while her stepmother washed her hands of such a stepdaughter and kicked her out of the house.

¬†

Overnight, Emmeline went from being a pampered, spoiled rich girl to the slut who was the talk of the town.

¬†

‚Ä¶

¬†

Five years passed in the mere twinkling of an eye.

¬†

‚ÄúExtra! Newsflash!‚Äù The headlines were all over the news, catching Emmeline‚Äôs attention. ‚ÄúHead of the Ryker Group warded in critical condition. Abel Ryker returning today from overseas to visit him.‚Äù

¬†

Under the brief write-up was the photo of a man in a black suit and white tie. He looked tall and well-built, his countenance clean-shaven and handsome. His classic features hinted at an enigmatic air, and even in such a poor-quality photograph, his dark eyes were coldly decisive.

¬†

Emmeline drew a sharp hiss of breath. Could this handsome, almost bewitching man be the one who mistook her for someone else five years ago?

¬†

Her sons did bear some resemblance to him.

¬†

Quickly, she undid her apron and tossed it onto the coffee counter, then swooped down and embraced her four-year-old son.

¬†

‚ÄúSince you‚Äôre not going to kindergarten today, why don‚Äôt you come with Mommy?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWhere are we going, Mommy?‚Äù Hesperus blinked his dark eyes curiously and put down the Rubik‚Äôs cube he was holding.

¬†

‚ÄúTo see your daddy!‚Äù

¬†

After her family chased her out of the house and disowned her, Emmeline had rebuilt her life entirely through her own efforts.

¬†

Currently, even without a man by her side, her children led a good life.

¬†

Unfortunately, in an unforeseen stroke of Fate, Hesperus had been diagnosed with a blood disorder.

¬†

Emmeline had to find the father of her children so she could save her son‚Äôs life!

¬†

Half an hour later, mother and son arrived at the hospital that was under the Ryker Group‚Äôs control. They brought with them a fruit basket as a gift. A nurse informed them that old Mr. Oscar Ryker was the only patient in the entire wing, and he was in the innermost VIP suite. However, when Emmeline got there, she was stopped by several bodyguards dressed in black.

¬†

‚ÄúWait, isn‚Äôt that the little slut about town?‚Äù Two well-dressed, wealthy women came out of the hospital room and eyed Emmeline.

¬†

‚ÄúWho does she think she is, coming to visit Oscar?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs probably come to the wrong floor. She‚Äôs certainly not fit to see him!‚Äù",1,1741865245.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

INCIDENT 1

me and my friends went to cumbum and booked a room in this lodge. The owner was super rude to us because we were bachelors, he either should've told Bachelors are not allowed but he didn't mention anything and treated us very badly and judging us because we wore shorts and arrived as bachelors.


INCIDENT 2 (more serious one)

I'm visiting varanasi right now on a solo trip. For accomodation here my dad talked with his frnd and got me a room in the ""Sri Kasi Nattukottai Nagara Chatram"". With special permission my reservation was confirmed and my dad paid the amount as well, but when I arrived the manager asked for my name I told it (not a chettiyar sur name ig) he stressed on my surname, then told rooms will not be alloted for single people. I told we already paid and got the reservation and he was like no rules are rules then he gave this statement 'enga aalungaluku dhan first preference"" which is very unnecessary statement and honestly it ruined my mood. I was not expecting our own tamil people to spoil my mood here in varanasi.


 I went to this tiny restaurant to have coffee afterwards and when I went to pay bill the cashier who is a local guy who spoke broken english he noticed my phone and showed his phone we both had the same phone and we had a small conversation about this warmed my heart a bit. the local people here treat tamil people in a better way than actual tamil people.",40,1741865172.0,Chennai,24,0.93,False

1ja9q36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1ja9q36/how_to_handle_my_wife_hiding_things/,How to handle my wife hiding things,"Hi everyone, this a dump account, excuse my english it is not my main language :)¬†This is a bit of a long story about the situation with me and my wife.

Some background: my wife (F36) and me (40M) are happily together for 14 yours, of which we are 7 years married. We have 2 kids (4 and 6).

Some background: my wife has  issues with migraine, pmmd/pms and adhd, for the last 2 she never went to a docter. She can be pretty moody/depressed/hormal before her period, and also be bound to bed with migraine for about 10 days each month. This ofcourse can make her (and me) unhappy.¬†

We both can be a bit introvert and keep things to ourselves, however we enjoy spending time together, and of course have busy lives with 2 kids, but we always got along great. Our relationship and marriage was pretty easy-going so far. However last year things changed a bit.¬†

Some history: long before we met she lived together in an ‚Äòforeign‚Äô exchange studenthome in another country for some months, of which a group of 6 people established to maintain contact. I always thought this was nice, and a couple of times a year they meetup and have an ‚Äòreunion‚Äô together.¬† The group is a very cool group of ‚Äòfriends‚Äô with totally different characters, 4 guys and 2 girls. They plan reunions some times a year.

Last years, maybe because everyone is getting married and having kids, the group is getting more tight and conversations are getting more intense.

They planned to do a trip together to the US (note that we are from europe), because 1 of the guys moved there for work. They planned a roadtrip for a week in the westcoastarea. OK for me as i really trust my wife and the people in this group, and they have done short trips before together.

At the same time as plans were made for the trip I started noticing she talks more about 1 guy in the group, in a way she never did before.¬†

Also she really wanted us to go to his birthday party (in september) and was really looking forward to that (also seeing the group of friends and talking about the USA trip). This guy has 2 kids and a wife himself by the way.

I did not think much of it back then but in hindsight it looked she was interested in this guy.¬†

The USA trip came (October) and it was fun, the photos and stories were cool. However shorty after the LA trip i noticed she was bit more sneaky with her phone. She started to lay the phone with the screen down. And when i wanted to search something on her phone she would tell ‚Äòhey that‚Äôs my phone‚Äô. This she never did before. Also i know she chats with people from the group of friends, in groupchats but also personal, i never thought this was an issue because they are friends. But when i was holding here phone and a app from this guys comes in she swiftly swiped it away. I thought OK a bit suspcious but did not act on it yet. This was medio november.

The next situation was that she told me she wanted to meet up with the girl in the group for some drinks, they did so but afterwards i found out the there were 2 more people from the group there, including of course this 1 guy. She never mentioned it.

Also in another situation she said she had a work meeting in a town near where the guy lives, she shortly mentioned maybe she could meet up with him for coffee, but never mentioned again.¬† It turns out she indeed had some coffee with him, but fails to mention this before/afterwards.

I started to get really suspicous and took here phone (sneaky) to look at the chat history. I noticed they started chatting more frequently (not every day but every few days), but it was kinda innocent; like a ‚Äòhow was your day‚Äô, how are the kids doing, sharing some photos of them. However i did not like this.¬†

At the end of the year the phone sneaking was getting more intense, not leaving it laying around anywhere.¬†Around christmas she received an chat message, while i was looking at here phone with her,¬† saying ‚Äòplease call me‚Äô which she swiftly swipes away and pretent like nothing happened. Then she silently moves out of the room and I can hear her starting to call. She is on the top floor so i moved to the middle floor to see if i can over hear something. When she notices me going UP, she goes down again. I wait a bit and go down also, and she goes UP again. Ofcourse she is avoiding me. At this point i started to get pissed and wanted to take her phone from here. Later this evening i confront her, i ask her if she is hiding something because she really actin very very suspicous lately.

She looks at me and i see in her eyes that she is hiding something.¬†  
She thinks for a bit and tells me she indeed has been hiding things.  She told me she had a some feelings  for the guy, which i suspected a bit already.

She mentions that in the group reunions that there were the was some ‚Äòinnocent‚Äô flirting going on, but she says she also knows that the crush is over and she concluded it could/will never work. She says she loves me, wants to be me with me and i do believe that.¬†¬†

Note that some occasional flirting in a bar is ok for both us, but for me not with the same guy in a group of friends you want to keep seeing.

Since this confontration we have some long talks the next couple of days, in which i asked many many questions. What it comes down to is that she also not know why she hid the contact moments, why she was so sneaky with her phone and she made a mistake. She was afraid to mention that she had little crush, and because she decided herself that she was not going to do anything with it and was afraid the trip to the US was going to be a problem. The coffee date she had was a really innocent one she told me, and that the guy would be there with the other girl she ‚Äòforgot‚Äô to mention. Some pretty lame excuses. Also the call with the guy was because the guy thought she was mad at him for some reason because she was not responding on him anymore. 

My world was kinda upside down because the girl and wife i really loved and trusted is no longer trustable.¬†

We made a deal that she stops all contact with the guy,¬† which is complex because they are in the same group of friends that share some really great history.

Also we made a deal that she will open up and tell me when things are important to our relationship.

She swore that she never cheated, spoke bad about me, kissed or did whatever to this guy, and i do believe that, i also did not find any evidence about it. (i read all her chat history, browser history, etcetera).¬†Also the group doesn't know anything about what happened, except for the other girl in the group.

We have had some more talks and she is very cuddly and caring towards me, and tells me many times she loves me.

in januari she received a 'cheer up' card from the other girl in the group, she doesn't know all details. My wife hid this card instantly, i asked her why but she doesn't really know. It was a really innocent message.

However since the confrontation, i still think about the situation every day. I notice that i have bad thoughts like is she still talking to him, if she goes to a work location i wonder if she really goes there. Let‚Äôs just say she really fucked up my mind, i am paranoia, have less focus on my job en regularly depressed since it happened. And i never had that before. I really hated what she has done.

So before the confrontation around christmas the group of friends already had a reunion planned again in februari, we decided that we would see later if she could go there.

Januari was OKish for me, i was accepting and she told me lot of times she fucked up and she is sorry. Also she does keep mentioning that nothing happend. I check her phone occasionally she is indeed not having contact.¬†We try to talk more, have more fun and are more romantic.

So in februari the reunion (2 days) starts to come and i feel a bit better, and because i know how ‚Äòcool‚Äô the group is i decided she can go there. On the day that she goes i feel pretty emotional so i am in doubt that it was a good idea. However she still goes.

She checks in regurlary with me on chat, as she noticed i was a bit upset when she left. She had a OK weekend, she said she was distant to the guy, also she spoke a bit that she will not have contact with him anymore because she kept things away to me.

I did not like how i reacted emotionally on this weekend, but i was glad about what she told me. Ofcourse i do have the little voice in my head saying is she really telling everything.¬†

Now it‚Äôs march she got a message from the guy that her driver license was still in a wallet, probably from the US trip, and he would mail it. She told me this so i thought ok good you are sharing things.

We received the envelop and i could feel a card was in the envelop. I put it on the table and I thought to myself OK let‚Äôs see if you are more open. You can open the envelop and leave the card on the table for me/us to read, or hide it. To bad she chose the last option. She hid the card immediately and fails to mention it‚Ä¶  
 

I was¬† very pissed off about this decision she made. I asked why she did it and i got some lame excuses that it was a nice card and she did not want the kids to ruin it.¬† I told her she promised to be more open. She was on her period, maybe that‚Äôs why her reaction was also a bit moody but we got in a little fight about it. I was feeling pretty bad again because she broke her promise that she would open up to me. I read the card and it was just little innocent 'hope you feel better soon' message, so i really don‚Äôt understand why she felt why she need to hide it. It seems her first reaction is to hide things. Also she made a little lie to me that it was on our kitchen table the whole time, because i saw the card where she took it.

The next day i reach to her phone to look up for something and i see that she is chatting with the guy a bit since he mentioned the driver license, it is really innocent like (how is your son doing on swimming lessons) and some pictures of our kids are shared, but she promised that contact would be broken. Now I was really pissed, she was tired and before she went to sleep i told her something like ‚Äòi know you chatted with him again, get a great fucking sleep‚Äô and was really ready to kick her out.¬†

She came down a few minutes later, i was now just really really angry for maybe the first time in my life she understood and promised it would not happen again. However i am fed up with it. In 1 weekend she broke 2 promises.

I find the situation difficult, i feel like i can trust her in some ways, she has not cheated or had a real affaire, but also she does hides things from me and had a crush/flirting period over a period of some weeks/months without any mention about it.

For this next Friday she was asked to go out with by the girl in the group, she promised that there is noone else from the group there as i specifically wanted to know.¬† I told her i find it difficult to let her go out. She was shocked by this and seemed unexpected. I think she just does not realise how much my trust was broken by hiding small things.

Also there are birthdays coming up in the group of friends, in which i would find it very difficult to meet the guy again, or let my wife join in, and more group reunions will also be planned eventually.¬†

Perfect for me would be that she would break all contact with the guy forever, and be open and transparent about things concerning our marriage.   
But that would also break contact with the group, which would be very sad because that group would fall apart.

So this really lays an extra burden on me and on my wife.

Maybe that‚Äôs why i want to share this story here, and see if there might be some advice here how to handle this.  
Since we have 2 kids leaving would not be the first option, we still love each other and have many happy times,  but this 'thing' has to be dealt with now..

For context, for the last 2-3 years my coffee setup has been a Moccamaster paired with a Wilfa Uniform. I love it and they work great together. However, I recently picked up a Breville (Sage) Dual Boiler for a good price and the Wilfa is really holding us back (as understandably it's a filter grinder first and foremost). So now I'm looking for something that can make the most of the new BDB while also serving as a replacement for the Uniform.

Having looked around a lot the two options in the title both seem fairly popular and appropriate in terms of being capable of filter and espresso but I haven't really seen much by way of specific comparison. From what I understand the Mazzer is a clear step up in terms of build quality / reliability which is important to me, but I'm not sure if the difference in performance / workflow / retention etc between the two will be worth the extra expense. Retention in particular is a bit of a concern with how frequently I'm planning to go between filter / espresso beans, likely making at least one cup of each daily. My heart is leaning towards the Mazzer with the I200Ds as our 'end game' solution but the price gap is real (Mazzer for around 995 Euros and I could get a Timemore for about 600). Should I also be looking at the other Sculptors?

Any thoughts? I'll be sure to send in a picture of the completed corner when I'm decided :p",2,1741864638.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1ja9kg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingthruit/comments/1ja9kg2/blocked_still/,Blocked Still?,"## Writer's Block? More Like Writer's *Bleh*. Let's Fix This:

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Clich√© Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing clich√© in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clich√©s with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush.

I've just noticed that I've become more uncomfortable with trans people and transness as a whole. It started off with just being disgusted with the tucutes, the crossies, etc. fair enough. They're a caricature of who I am, so I'm naturally put off by them. But it's grown now. There were pride flags in the coffee shop at my university (they got taken down recently, not sure if they're remodelling or some more conservative students made them) and I always avoided the trans one, felt physically ill when sat near it. There's a trans guy in my class and we used to be friends but now I just have this vitriol against him. I hate seeing trans people on the street, my cis friends tell me to chill out with the jokes, I've become a monster.

I know why. It's because they remind me of myself. The parts I'd rather bury under as much surgery and makeup and hormones as humanly possible. I've broken down in tears because my friends just mention that I'm trans. But I don't want to be like this. I want to feel love and pride for my community and myself. I just don't know how.

Something I love to do during my morning coffee, walks in the park, or when it‚Äôs slow at work. 
Different people, 
discovering their own lives. 
It‚Äôs fascinating to me. 

Usually I don‚Äôt remember anyone‚Ä¶only seeing them once. 
But you, I remember.

Sipping my morning coffee, I noticed you always slowed down during the spring to look at the blooming flowers.
Admiring the emerging petals, excited to see what beautiful creation it would turn into. 
Chrysanthemums.
Those were your favorite. 

I never got mad when you picked them from my front garden, unlike my grumpy neighbors.
You sang to old rock music, with a voice that even the bird would hang around too listen. 
Their precious babies would be crying for food.
You picked up trash you had come across left from the reckless teenagers up the hill.
Said hello to early morning joggers.
Even brought your own treats to feed to the stray cats that hung around the corner.
You seemed so kind-hearted. 

I always wondered where you were walking too.
To your day job, I had assumed.
When I stopped seeing you, my first thought was you had quit to work some place else. Perhaps you found a better paying job more in the city.
I could see you working in the fashion industry, based off your unique choice of clothing. 
Maybe you fell in love with someone and moved across the country. 

That, I hope not. 
Because even though I never met you, it felt like I was falling in love. 

The way you admired earths creations, the light hitting your eyes making it look like a pot of honey‚Ä¶the way you walked with confidence. 
I wished the best for you, on whatever journey you were embarking.

I started to notice other things once you stopped coming around.
A family of squirrels had a routine of grabbing nuts from the oak tree hanging above my porch. They would chase each other around until one got a stomach ache, then run back under my neighbors fence. 

But nothing is as interesting as you.
I missed seeing you.
So I‚Äôll write it here for now. 
To remember. 

When I saw you on the news, that‚Äôs the first time I learned your name. 
Anna. 
What a beautiful name‚Ä¶
From all the pictures, videos and comments I saw, I knew you were loved by many. 
So this, I never would have expected. 
It‚Äôs crazy that I saw you everyday, creating a narrative about you in my head. 
But this was never part of it.

I‚Äôm sorry Anna. I‚Äôm sorry I never once introduced myself to be your friend. 
Im sorry this world is so cruel.
I‚Äôm sorry I couldn‚Äôt save you from the harsh reality of what we call life. 
I‚Äôm sorry you didn‚Äôt get a fair chance for yourself to become happier.
I‚Äôll promise I‚Äôll collect all the Chrysanthemums I ever come across for the rest of my time, to honor you Anna.",1,1741863292.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

No one wanted 14th Feb because it was valentine's day. Me and mum spent our own money to buy 3 good raffles prizes so people would want to buy the raffle tickets. My mum got 2 legs of lamb from work ( she doesn't like telling people her son died young of cancer because it's a painful subject for her). We also had to attend the whist drive for 2 hours Friday evening to sort out half time tea and coffee for the whist players and stay behind to wash up afterwards. My dad donated the money to the children's hospice charity that provided end of life care for my brother. He allocated it to his girlfriends nieces fundraiser so she can go to a skydive in about 2 weeks time. My mum wouldn't have put herself in this position and told work about her dead son if she knew it was paying for a skydive. The niece has raised ¬£70 of the minimum ¬£400 sponsorship. My mum is angry and upset that ¬£180 of the money we raised will pay for the charity skydive rather than the full ¬£270 going to the hospice. With the money from the whist drive she only has to get ¬£60 now. She feels my brother's memory is getting betrayed and now everyone at work will know she has a dead son when the thank you letter goes up on the notice board. So is my dad the AH or is my mum over reacting ""because some of the money will still go to the hospice"" my dad's excuse. He's finding my mum's reaction amusing. I think he's an AH just wondering what complete strangers on the internet think. 

Edit: both me and my mum feel that if the whist drive money was going to the skydive page all along why didn't the niece and aunt wash up and provide the raffles prizes. 

It is going to the same charity just less of the money will go as a portion of it will pay for the ""reduced rate charity skydive"" ",2,1741863189.0,AITAH,7,1.0,False

It was a great deal of banter back and forth, and she would send me videos and pictures of herself and the scenery as she was on holiday in Asia and I was doing the same as I went on holiday too. Every two days we would text each other and rather flirtatious.

On her dating profile she indicated she was looking for ""fun casual dates / long term relationship"".

When we both returned from holiday we set up a date. It was just before Ramadan which began on a Sunday, So, in light of this, I asked her if she wanted to meet on a Thursday and Friday. We met on both days, which culminated in dinner, coffee and even going to the spa by booking a private spa room (which she was open to as well). While we were there, we vibed and got sexual but no penetration. Afterwards we had dinner and then went to the arcades. Generally we vibed well and had a similar outlook on some topics and she told me how different I was in real life as compared to online from a positive standpoint. We do differ though in the sense that she was in a long term relationship with another man for 7 years but had an ""open relationship"" where she slept with 5 other men during that time. Nonetheless, I was respectful of this and I did not judge her at all. In terms of her character, she describes herself as ""introverted extrovert"" and is able to spend time alone quite comfortably and does not enjoy a strong relationship to her parents and was rebellious in her teen years as she did not fit the profile of how her parents were hoping she would turn out to be (although I must say she is educated and smart).

On our first date, I told her that soon Ramadan would begin and I would be very busy for the next 4 weeks with fasting and that I usually do not go out in the evenings as I am breaking my fast and spending time with family. I mentioned that to her so she does not misunderstand my intentions and think I am not interested if we do not see each other in this period. She was very understanding of this and appreciated me telling her this in advance. I told her we can still keep the contact and even break a fast together at some stage and she was open to that. So, after our second date, I dropped her off home and gave each other a kiss and that was it for the night.

One week passes by and then I send her a text asking her how she is doing and share a picture of the dinner table at my familys home to show her how we break the fast, like a part of my culture. I see one tick on Telegram, which means it is delivered but she has deliberately not opened the message. Its been 5 days. Normally she would be much more responsive. I know for a fact she was active on the app because she changed her profile picture after I texted her.

Now, despite the fact that during my initial conversations with her I told her I am the kind who always respected open and honest communication and that being disinterested is okay as long as it is communicated respectfully, I genuinely felt she understood that. This makes me the all the more surprised at her behaviour. In fact, as we got to know each other on our first date, I explicitly told her that I I am not a fan of ghosting or blocking someone but always appreciated transparent communication. She even told me at one point how she is the type who does not like having arguments with people but will communicate in some way when she no longer wants to meet someone.

I will not double text and do anymore chasing but my text to her was just to keep some momentum and the conversation going while I also focus on the month of fasting. I understand that fun casual dates are just that, but would a woman not have a bit more empathy towards a man who made a real genuine effort over two dates (it was really well thought out in terms of the dinner place and the wellness box was expensive) and considering the fact I explicitly told her how I hate ghosting?

We originally had only been given 35mins transfer in Helsinki for our next flight to Budapest. Flights purchased in one booking reference. 

First plane got delayed for 20min and we were already stressed about it. We spoke to the lady at the boarding and was told she can‚Äôt help with our concern and referred us to speak to the Flight Attendance on the plane.

Spoke to the FA, and in a second told us she cant help us and told us the flight is only for 20min. She also told us she doesnt have any information nor guidance to give. Landed in Helsinki with just 5mins before the next flight. Again, we did not receive any information nor guidance from anyone. So wife and I had to run from gate 10 to 30, only to realised we had missed our connecting flight.

Went to the trasnfer service, as expected given us the standard ‚Äúclaim through insurance and/or EU‚Äù. Was offered another flight which leaves in 8 hours. Aside from that and the 17euro food voucher, we are stuck at the airport with nothing else we can do. 

I personally think staff could have done a better job with communicating things. You would expect them to at least provide information about best way to transfer and should have been in a position to tell us that we will miss our flight. Running from the plan to the next gate exposed us to the risk of slipping and falling. In addition, they should not offer this connecting flight with only 30min or so to move, considering the possibility of delays etc. Further, you would expect the connecting flight to wait for passengers who are in the same booking reference (10mins would have made us make the next flight!). Lastly, you would expect them to at least provide extra care /benefits for passengers who like us missed a flight beyond our control (i understand planes could be delayed due to extreme weather events which i did ask them about, but they didnt confirm if it was the case).

My girlfriend and I were each other‚Äôs firsts for everything. We had been together for almost three years before she moved to a different university (10-hour drive away) while I stayed at my local university. I knew this would be a big change, but I completely trusted her. She always reassured me that no other guy could compare and that she would always be honest with me.

Still, I made it clear before she left: if she ever started developing feelings for someone else, she needed to tell me so we could talk about it.

The first three weeks of university were torture for me. She became distane,cutting calls short, giving excuses for why she couldn't text, and generally feeling less enthusiastic about our relationship. I had a gut feeling something wasn‚Äôt right. I asked her directly if there was anyone she was attracted to, but she assured me there wasn‚Äôt.

Then, we had a call where she completely tore apart our relationship. She spoke as if I had been a bad boyfriend, when before, she had always told me how much she appreciated my kindness and effort. She even bad-mouthed my parents. That‚Äôs when I knew something was wrong.

A week before this, I had written her a poem and a letter, telling her I could feel things changing and that if she didn‚Äôt get her act together, I would leave. But after that call, I knew I had to end things.

The next day, I confronted her again, pushing her to be honest. She finally admitted she had developed feelings for another guy but didn‚Äôt know why. Later that night, I found out the full truth,she had been going on coffee dates with him, video calling him, and talking about me behind my back. Even after she confessed to me, the first thing she did was call him. That was enough for me. I broke up with her.

Immediately, she regretted it. She flew back to see me two weekends in a row, telling me it was the biggest mistake of her life and that she only loves me. She said her life is meaningless without me.

But now, it doesn‚Äôt feel the same. No matter how much she apologizes, I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that it only took her one week to throw away nearly three years. I still love her, but I don‚Äôt trust her. I told her I just want to be friends and stop messaging/calling as often.

Do I put my feelings aside and move on from her or do I let her try fix things?",6,1741862810.0,relationship_advice,30,0.88,False

I found a good deal on the Baratza Virtuoso+ (‚Ç¨160, new), but since it's a bit older and I've read mixed reviews, l'm wondering how it compares to newer manual grinders in the same price range, like the Kingrinder K6 or 1Zpresso X Ultra, in terms of quality. 

My coffee routine is fairly simple: I enjoy a cup every other day and usually brew just for myself. I currently use a French press, but l want to start experimenting with pour-over methods like V60 or Switch.

Considering quality and ease of use, would you recommend the Virtuoso+, or would a manual grinder be a better choice?

We originally had only been given 35mins transfer in Helsinki for our next flight to Budapest. Flights purchased in one booking reference. 

First plane got delayed for 20min and we were already stressed about it. We spoke to the lady at the boarding and was told she can‚Äôt help with our concern and referred us to speak to the Flight Attendance on the plane.

Spoke to the FA, and in a second told us she cant help us and told us the flight is only for 20min. She also told us she doesnt have any information nor guidance to give. Landed in Helsinki with just 5mins before the next flight. Again, we did not receive any information nor guidance from anyone. So wife and I had to run from gate 10 to 30, only to realised we had missed our connecting flight.

Went to the trasnfer service, as expected given us the standard ‚Äúclaim through insurance and/or EU‚Äù. Was offered another flight which leaves in 8 hours. Aside from that and the 17euro food voucher, we are stuck at the airport with nothing else we can do. 

I personally think staff could have done a better job with communicating things. You would expect them to at least provide information about best way to transfer and should have been in a position to tell us that we will miss our flight. Running from the plan to the next gate exposed us to the risk of slipping and falling. In addition, they should not offer this connecting flight with only 30min or so to move, considering the possibility of delays etc. Further, you would expect the connecting flight to wait for passengers who are in the same booking reference (10mins would have made us make the next flight!). Lastly, you would expect them to at least provide extra care /benefits for passengers who like us missed a flight beyond our control (i understand planes could be delayed due to extreme weather events which i did ask them about, but they didnt confirm if it was the case).

This is one of  my first reddit posts so bare with me, 
I (27M) and my boyfriend (M29) have been togeather for about 7 months now, it all was all great at the beginning like all relationships start, however; it started going down hill from there after, my main concern at the moment is that he is very inconsiderate of my feelings, although he seems genuine while explaining his reasoning for doing what he is doing.

After a big fight with him we met up and talked about him ignoring me and prioritizing his life over our relationship, and we agreed on him putting more effort towards the relationship because I‚Äôve been lifting this relationship all by myself recently, she had a personal trip to get some things done in his hometown so he asked me to come with him to get him company, I was surprised that he actually tried to make an effort and I felt he was actually trying so I agreed on coming with him, after going there and finishing his errands he said something to me out of the blue that really shocked me, he said he wanted to meet up with his long time friend (who happens to be a fuck buddy in the later stages of their relationship) because he misses him as he was his roomate for 6 years  abrod while he was studying for college at the time, and he is now back to his hometown that happens to be the same as my boyfriend‚Äôs

I was really confused as why he would bring that up to me in the first place, but I was trying not to make big deals out of everything so I went with it, so we met with him( and something relevant to the story, we live in a very homophobic country where nobody can really be out, so in public he can‚Äôt introduce me as his bf, so I was there as his friend) as we sat in the coffee shop they were reminiscing about their roomate days and he randomly touches his arm as he is talking like straight people do lol, but I brushed it off, then; all of the sudden the roomate said that he is visiting my hometown ( where me and my BF live) before going back abroad, my boyfriend immediately offered for him to crash at his house( we live with our parents as it is the norm around here) so basically he is inviting him to sleep over in his room, while i was sitting there, the roomate was trying to eavde the offerr but my BF insisted, I was fuming at that point but lept it inside
We went back and I kept it for myself untill recently I was chatting with my friend and told him about what is bothering me, he said that what he did was very disrespectful of me and he should not have met with him let alone offering for him to crash at his room, I explained to him that he might did it out of generosity ( we say things we don‚Äôt mean all the time around here to seem extra generous, you get the idea), but still wasn‚Äôt appropriate.

Few days later I told him we needed to talk, we met and I told him about the situation, he laughed and said is that all? ( like it was nothing to be upset about) and preceded with saying: you know I like to keep people I know in my life forever and never cut ties with them, I don‚Äôt want to be rude to people and like to keep them as friends.
I told him but it is still disrespectful for me, I never go out with my exes because I respect you as my BF, he said: it is different with you, your Exes mostly started as hookups( which I don‚Äôt deny) so you weren‚Äôt their friend to begin with. And I know you wouldn‚Äôt see them because you all rnded on bad terms.
I said what about your recent Ex ( the last person who was in a relationship with still talks and meet up with him) he said because we were friends first. I was furstrated at this point so I tried to compare and said: what would you do if your ex actually crashed with you and made a pass at you and tried to kiss you, he said he would carefully and gently tell him he isn‚Äôt interested and laugh it off, because he doesn‚Äôt want to ‚ÄúDisappoint or hurt him ‚Äù!!!!  

I really was shocked at that point and said have you thought about how would I feel about this, wouldn‚Äôt it hurt my feelings that you let such an opportunity for him to do so in the first place?, he said no because you would trust me if you love me.

I reminded him of how we met in the first place ( he went out with me on few dates then out of the blue he told me he is in a relationship! i know I know I should have never gone through with this but I was really feeling something for him) and told him you aren‚Äôt trust worthy to begin with, he said the typical bullshit of :you and I are different, I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with him and therefore why I was looking for someone else, he was the first relationship I had and I didn‚Äôt know what I was into at the time. 

TLDR, I am currently not comfortable with his dismissive nature of my feelings, and whant to know if his excuses are rational or am I being too sensitve, and try to keep the way our relationship started out of the subject to avoid any chance of bias, I really appreciate everybody‚Äôs genuine input at this time.

Well, whether you‚Äôre a regular gamer already, or these were your first foray into interactive games, fret not! I want to help you find other great stories to enjoy. Who knows? One of these could really connect with you! Whether it‚Äôs the dialogue, choices to be made, world-building - something in these is bound to touch a part of someone in our LiS community.

Many of the games that have already released are often on sale for $3-$15 USD. Many are on Xbox GamePass and/or Playstation Plus. No matter  what, please wishlist on Steam if you can - it takes no effort, yet immensely helps studios with publishing deals, production budgets etc!

OKAY! Now, this is why I‚Äôm posting: Here are my recommendations to you all wanderers seeking some guidance. Even though I haven‚Äôt played every single game I list, and not every one is a Game Of The Year contender - I‚Äôm just trying to put stuff on our collective radar. Let‚Äôs not be too harsh on any you didn‚Äôt like, either - these are all worth a trailer watch and/or a review glance.

____________________

Let‚Äôs start off with the usual, expected recommendations - every time someone asks, these tend to be the top answers. Might as well get them out of the way:

The Last Of US Part 1 + 2: Peak storytelling and world-building. My 2nd-favorite franchise. Scary af, tho! Linear narrative, but great representation and diversity. Naughty Dog also released Uncharted: Lost Legacy, another critically-acclaimed game with two female leads.

Tell Me Why + Lost Records: DontNod‚Äôs spiritual sequels to LiS. Tell Me Why is often free on Steam around Pride Month, too. Also from DontNod - Harmony: Fall Of Reverie.

Mass Effect: I decided to include it here. An epic space opera unlike anything before, it elevated standards for decision-making dialogue and the importance of strong supporting characters. Play the trilogy, don‚Äôt leave anything out!

Detroit: Become Human: Choice-based. By the studio behind Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls‚Ä¶not my favorites, but still.

Road 96: Choice-based, road trip, I believe infinitely-generated possibilities. Not my jam, but still.

As Dusk Falls: Choice-based. Art style wasn‚Äôt my thing, tho - the framerate messed with my head too much.

The Walking Dead: Non-linear stories. Never played them myself, but Telltale Games is right up in LiS‚Äôs alley re: the genre. Which leads to other Telltale Games, like one of my favorites‚Ä¶

The Wolf Among Us: Based on the Fables universe. Love the dialogue, characters, world-building. Sequel‚Äôs stuck in development hell.

Next: Yet to be released titles - keep an eye out for these!

[Mixtape](https://youtu.be/w1UPjbO0oEU?si=fb8SRtl25GsN_h4J): Go ahead and tell me that isn‚Äôt the coolest trailer ever. My most anticipated game of 2025 (suck it, GTA 6, we all know you‚Äôre 2026 anyways). From the studio behind The Artful Escape, a wacky music-centered game (which Mixtape will join on GamePass!). I beg everyone to check it out.

[Dispatch](https://youtu.be/jK0cGKMDMPE?si=yH78QBf6Nh8R1LCY): I believe this is the original team behind Telltale Games before it closed and was then reborn. Superhero choice-based game, star-studded cast.

[South Of Midnight](https://youtu.be/4xRuUaJYNtI?si=b4BUBT8-VUiW7T-B): Can‚Äôt wait to play it. Trying to stay away from much info on it so I don‚Äôt spoil myself, since it‚Äôll be on GamePass. An impressive world based on Creole folklore.

[Forever Ago](https://youtu.be/1fwymo5q8eU?si=vLEnvko-4fC9hMkp): Road trip adventure. Walking simulator?

[In The Valley Of Gods](https://youtu.be/UFOXIGzdMv8?si=-yaJGk76XMh0yKq8): Stuck in development hell? Seems like an interesting adventure story.

[Unbeatable](https://youtu.be/LXb0wT75wP8?si=wHqdt1KN79QyYl_3): Half walking simulator, half rhythm-based narrative.

[Leila](https://youtu.be/d8L2o2WkCpw?si=GwTP3EPED6O5mIkz): Point-and-click narrative.

[Deer & Boy](https://youtu.be/QTVUOF9qjpw?si=lK0_HkDNABqdep-U): Cinematic platformer. Similar to‚Ä¶

[Little Devil Inside](https://youtu.be/_FqsyNSYSKc?si=hZ9Hq5jHUcbFb8aN): Stuck in development hell. I‚Äôve given up hope, but I was really looking forward to it.

_________________________


Okay, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs plenty of future games I haven‚Äôt gotten to yet, but there‚Äôs plenty of backlog for us LiS fans to check out. Without further ado‚Ä¶

What Remains Of Edith Finch: Wow. That‚Äôs it. Wow. I still think about this short game, years later. Often on sale for criminally cheap.

Gris + Neva: Two spiritually-similar games from Nomada Studio. No dialogue, but inCREDIBLE art styles, worlds, and atmospheric storytelling. The epitome of ‚Äúgames are art‚Äù lol

Oxenfree 1+2: LiS fans ought to check these out. Twin Peaks vibes.  Awesome characters w/ choice-based dialogue. I also recommend Afterparty from this studio, w/ similar gameplay. These are some of the closest to LiS-vibes.

Firewatch: Mystery. Great dialogue. Walking simulator.

Lake: Small-town, walking simulator vibes.

Spiritfarer: I‚Äôve heard two things about this game - ‚Äúamazing‚Äù and ‚Äúheart-wrenching‚Äù. Be warned!

Gone Home: This was, if I understand correctly, the one to kick off the walking simulator explosion. Very short and cheap game. Please go into it blindly. Powerful. There likely wouldn‚Äôt be an LiS without Gone Home. Same studio as Tacoma and also‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶Open Roads: Art style took getting used to. Wasn‚Äôt *super* impressed, but it‚Äôs on GamePass so I don‚Äôt regret the ~5hrs.

Venba: Short game about an immigrant‚Äôs childhood. Sweet but powerful.

Season (A Letter To The Future): Haven‚Äôt played it yet. Seems like a walking-simulator type, with some mystery.

Immortality: Don‚Äôt know much bc I‚Äôve yet to play, but I‚Äôve heard nothing but gushing praise. ‚ÄúGames are art‚Äù headliner. Check out the creator‚Äôs other interactive stories.

Kentucky Road Zero: Simple-looking but powerful story. Critically-acclaimed.

Night In The Woods: Emotional story-telling and dialogue.

Observation: Mystery. Short game, lots of twists. Creeeeeeepy.

Stray Gods: Music-based narrative. Star-studded.

Plague Tale (Innocence + Requiem): Similar to LiS 2, a sibling escort-ish narrative. DIdn‚Äôt blow my socks off, personally, but it‚Äôs definitely up our collective alley. Don‚Äôt play if you hate rats!

Goodbye Volcano High: Dinosaurs in high school. Have yet to play it, but it seems like choice-based dialogue. Managed to get out of development hell.

Control: Remedy does it again. Alan Wake may have been so-so, but Alan Wake 2 and Control are GORGEOUS, profoundly-impressive pieces of storytelling. Control has world-class art design and a strong female lead. 

After Love EP: From the creator behind Coffee Talk (RIP Mohammad Fahmi). Short games, dialogue-based. Similarly‚Ä¶

Now, these are other smaller titles / short games on my wishlist which I also have yet to play. Still worth checking out a trailer + review to see if anything jumps out at you.
