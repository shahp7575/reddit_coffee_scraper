They flew me out to their office and put me up in a hotel.

For those who don’t know, a technical interview generally involves coding a solution to a given problem that finishes as fast as possible with respect to the input size.

My solution relied on heaps deleting on log(n) time if you have a reference to the node you are deleting. When the interviewer saw this, he said “hmm I don’t think you can do that, can you show me?” So I drew out the process. He googles it and says “hmm I don’t think you can do that”. Anyways I now am fumbling but eventually get to the solution he was thinking of with some help.

I do the rest of the interviews and they went great. Despite that, the first interview still bugged me so while waiting for the uber to take me home, I decided to google the question, and saw I was right. I felt that I just needed to rant about it so I called my girlfriend and just started going off. I was loudly complaining about “what kind of idiot senior engineer doesn’t know this?” “this is such bs” “how are you so dumb that you google it and still get it wrong?” “I fkin hate that guy so much”

While I’m going off, I look up from my phone for a bit and the interviewer happened to walk by on his way to get coffee. He just kind of glanced at me and walked away.

Needless to say, I didn’t get the job. When I asked why, it was because of “cultural differences” and because “I didn’t want the job enough”. So I can’t be sure, but I don’t think my rant helped.

TL;DR: I complained about my interviewer and he just happened to hear it. I did not get the job.",0,1761034054.0,tifu,3,0.5,False

1oc7131,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1oc7131/been_sleeping_36_hours_for_years/,Been sleeping 3-6 hours for years,"
Age: 34, Male, 175 lbs/ ~80 kg, 5’11/~180 cm 

I’ve been sleeping about 3-6 hours per night for the past 8 years. I naturally wake up very early, usually between 3-5 am, feeling fully rested physically and mentally and ready to do anything. The less I sleep the better I feel.

Around 2018-2020 my sleep pattern suddenly shifted, I started waking up early and feeling completely rested even if I went to bed late. This pattern has stayed stable for years. Before that, I used to sleep 7-12 hours.

If I try to go back to sleep after the first awakenings, the “second sleep” is usually restless and sweaty. Most of the time, I have crazy nightmares and wake up mentally and physically beaten down (2-3 hours later). But if I just get up right after the first awakening, I feel clear and energized all day. The only thing that matters is that I must leave my house to work, the gym or anywhere else. If I stay home, I start feeling sleepy and eventually fall asleep. 

There are some really short nights sometimes, around 2.5 hours of sleep, but even after that I can work a 12 hour shift, go to the gym afterward and so on. I can keep up with this sleeping schedule for about a week, but then I’ll have a night of 6-10 hours of sleep.

If I eat before going to bed (1-2 hours before), the sleep is going to be awful.

I have a physically active job (20-30k steps per day). 

I don’t drink coffee at all and never have, no energy drinks either. 

I drink alcohol from time to time. 

I had been smoking for around 8 years, quit around 2 years ago. 

I rarely sleep during the day. For example, if I have a short shift, I usually won’t have a nap afterward. 

I go to bed between 9-11 pm and it usually takes me 30-60 minutes to fall asleep. 

It doesn’t matter what time I go to sleep or in what state (tired,sick, drunk) I’ll still wake up early. 

My dad has the same sleeping pattern. I remember myself as a kid waking up in “the middle of the night” but for him it was his regular morning. 

Also, I’m an introvert, when I sleep less, my social skills are much better and I actually want to talk to people. 

No mood swings, no constant anxiety. I’m always calm and do not express emotions much. 

My Apple Watch monthly statistics say I sleep about 6 hours per day on average. 

My friends and family tell me it’s a huge problem and that I don’t sleep enough, especially, if I sleep for 3 hours per night for a week or so, but I don’t see any issue here because I feel awesome after shorter nights. 

Questions: 

Is it a problem? 

Are there any potential issues with it? Like, maybe it’s the beginning of something like in Fight Club and I should pay attention to it right now? 

Should I keep getting up early and start my day or try to extend my sleep?

From my Apple Watch (the last 30-days average) 
•  Total time in bed: 6 h 42 min (range 4h10-8h45)
•  Actual sleep time: 5 h 27 min (range 3h30-6h40)
•  Deep sleep: ~46 min (14%)
•  REM sleep: ~1 h 23 min (25%)
•  Average resting HR during sleep: 61 bpm
•  HRV: 52 ms

I need an outside perspective/opinion.

Just for some background, my best friend (let’s call her Anna) grew up in a Christian household but she’s not religious at all anymore. She doesn’t go to church or practice any faith. This will be important later.

A few months ago, I met this guy in one of my university classes, I’ll call him Zack. Zack was everything I was looking for in a guy. He was funny, kind, respectful, and just really cute in a sweet, nerdy kind of way. I had this little crush on him, but I never told anyone about it.

Fast forward a few months, and Anna told our friend group she had started dating a guy she met on campus. She was absolutely head over heels about him and said she couldn’t wait for us to meet him. She planned a group dinner to introduce him to all of us.

So the day of the dinner comes. We’re all sitting at a table waiting for Anna’s boyfriend to show up. And when he walks in, my heart completely drops. It’s Zack. The guy I had liked for months. He smiled at all of us and sat next to Anna, and I didn’t know what to do.

I’m not going to lie, I felt kind of jealous. But I didn’t say anything, because Anna was clearly happy, and I didn’t want to get in the way of that. I just told myself to move on and be supportive.

Dinner was actually going really well. Zack was super sweet, and everyone in the group seemed to like him. But then, during the conversation, he brought up the topic of religion. He started talking about how important his faith is to him, and how one of his non-negotiables in a relationship is being with someone who's also Christian. He said he felt really lucky to have found a devout Christian woman like Anna, someone who is active in her church and leads a children’s ministry. He said he had prayed for a relationship like this.

The whole table kind of went quiet. My friends and I were all looking each other in confusion. Like I said earlier, Anna is not religious at all. She doesn’t go to church, and she’s never mentioned anything about a leading a children's ministry. Before anyone could ask questions, Anna quickly changed the subject.

After dinner, Zack left because he had work the next morning, and the rest of us went back to Anna’s place to debrief about the evening. Everyone was saying how sweet Zack was and how happy they were for her.

While we were talking about the dinner, I brought up what Zack said about her being religious and leading a children’s ministry. That’s when Anna admitted she had lied to him. She said that when they first started talking, he mentioned religion being a dealbreaker for him, and she panicked. She told him she was a Christian and made up this story about leading a children's ministry. She told us she didn’t think it would go anywhere at first, but once things started to get serious, she didn’t know how to back out of the lie.

I told her she had to tell him the truth, and the rest of our friends agreed. She was hesitant, but she told Zack the truth on their next date. Zack ended things with her. Anna was absolutely heartbroken. We all did our best to comfort her, but she was a wreck for weeks.

Eventually, she started doing better, and life kind of went back to normal.

Now here’s where my actual dilemma starts.

About a month ago, I started going to this Bible study at a local church. I ended up running into Zack there. He recognized me and came over to say hi, and since then, we’ve started becoming casual friends, or maybe acquaintances? We see each other at Bible study and on campus, and we usually say hi and talk for a few minutes about work/school(Anna and the rest of my friends know that him and I are kind of friends, but I hadn't told any of them about my feelings for Zack)

A few days ago, Zack asked if I wanted to get coffee or lunch before Bible study this week. I didn’t expect that at all. I told him I needed time to think about it, and he said he understood.

After that, I realized I had really messed up. I never told Anna or anyone in my friend group that I have feelings for Zack. I called all of them and told them we needed to talk. We met up at Anna’s place, and I told them everything, from how I had liked Zack for months, how I kept it to myself, and how he had just asked me out.

They were all really upset. They said I was breaking “girl code,” and that it didn’t matter when I started liking him, it still wasn’t okay. Anna was hurt, and I completely understand why. I should have said something way earlier, and I take full responsibility for that.

But now I’m stuck. Because I can’t stop thinking about the fact that I actually connect with Zack. We share the same values, he’s genuinely kind and respectful, and he's hilarious. I know this sounds selfish, but I really want to say yes. At the same time, I don’t want to lose my best friend or ruin my relationship with the group.

I don’t know what I should do. I need an outside, unbiased perspective.

Months 1-3 was good and all, then 2 months of hot and cold moments.

I tried to talk to her about it to try to fix things, but I said it in a way that makes it seem like I’m accusing her of something (I used the word ghosting) which I shouldn’t have done. She responded a day after that and said that I should stay away from her if I think that she’s ghosting me. She also said “I have my own battles, I’m tired of everything, so I think maybe it’s better that we stop this”.

I tried explaining things to her after, pleading not to stop what we had, and that I didn’t mean it like that. she didn’t respond or text again.

I feel a bit of a fraud, when I read about other people’s experiences I don’t feel like mine are as severe? I’m wary of going down the Fibro path if there’s something else at play. I guess that’s a common worry for everyone! I don’t know anyone with fibromyalgia so I thought I’d get some perspectives on it from here? 

I have two questions:

1) How can you tell if pain you’re feeling is due to fibromyalgia or you’ve hurt yourself? example: I woke up with searing pain from my neck between my shoulder blades two days ago and it feels like it’s burning. it hasn’t gone away and my first thought was I slept funny. But I haven’t changed anything about my bed, same pillows, same sleeping position. And it’s really painful when I move around and the most painful in the morning. Driving is awful. 

2) If I list some symptoms I’ve been having over the past 2-3 years can you guys let me know if it feels familiar to you? 

Feeling like my limbs are super heavy and clumsy   
Walking into stuff (walked into a door frame this morning and dropped my coffee on the floor)  
Getting confused by dates, plans, time in general (I used to be the super organised one in my friend group, now I struggle to remember plans)   
Anxiety through the roof all the time   
Feeling very low and negative   
Waking up with numb hands and feed   
Painful Achilles heels in the morning   
Walking is hard/I feel out of shape generally   
Cervical/Smear Test examinations are horrendously painful and drs are always shocked by my reaction   
Brian fog, constantly feeling like there’s a connection missing between my mouth and my brain   
Forgetfulness of words as I’m talking   
Can't multitask anymore? Talking and doing simultaneously is very hard   
Pain started as a wrist injury, then went up to my elbow, then my traps (traps are like rocks)   
Pain when my cats stand on my chest   
Joints click all the time   
Some days I have hardly any pain at all, my arm pain is always there but some days my body feels light (These are rare now)   
Needing coffee to think first thing   
Easily overwhelmed by sights/lights/sounds/touch   
Going into freeze mode during high stress/conflict? I just can‘t think, my brain just feels painfully slow!   
After a very high stress high conflict work meeting (lots of disagreements) the day after I felt like I was coming down wit h the flu I felt so sick and stayed in bed all day I could barely go to the kitchen. Then the day after all the symptoms mysteriously vanished, No flu! This has only happened once.

We have a four year old son. Our relationship hasn’t been perfect but he has cheated on me. It started 2 months ago and he cheated on me for a month before I found out. He cheated on me with a girl online in a different country. He says he fell out of love it’s me. I still love him despite what he has done. I’m now a single mum. He has said some pretty nasty things such as I trapped him when I found out I was pregnant. After the cheating was found out he lived in the same house as me and still carried on with talking to this other woman, every day and ignored any time with his son as he was constantly on the phone. I asked for one rule and that was to only talk to her after our son went to bed, he agreed for a day then downloaded a different app to talk to her. Every excuse was he was talking to people about work. Yet he was constantly flirting with me and hasn’t exactly been loyal to his now girlfriend. His behaviour got horrid towards me and I ended up having to get police involved to remove him from the house and he is now living in his car. I still feel guilty for doing this, he still comes over every morning to have a coffee every morning before work.  He is still sure he is going though with this relationship with the other woman, he has booked plane tickets and an air b&b to go and see her ‘to see if it’s real’. Yet he has made it clear he can’t give me any money for our son. I believe simply as someone who cares about him that he is making a huge mistake. I’m honestly scared she will use him. I always thought it was a code between women to not mess with someone who has a kid. He is completely upping and leaving his kid and is acting like he hasn’t done anything wrong. I still have contact with him everyday, but I am limiting how much contact he has with our son simply because all trust has been broken. He has a phone call every night with our son to say goodnight to him, our son has already not been wanting to call him but I do it anyway. Our son has been asking a lot when his dad is coming home and why his dad doesn’t love mum anymore. I’m honestly lost and I don’t know what to do. I still love him even with what he has done. This isn’t like my ex at all and I’m worried that he is going along with this because he feels like he hasn’t got any other option. My exs behaviour is nothing like him at all I’m worried he may need help.  I know you can’t help someone who doesn’t want to help themselves but I’m so worried he is living this lie just because.

Yesterday I met with a guy around my (23) age and we went drink a coffee. It was quite normal we talked about our lifes and at some point we started talking about religion.

I grew up very conservative religious and I still believe in god but I'm liberal now. So it's a topic I like to talk about.

Over time he invited me several time to his Christian small group and the leader of that group is apparently some kind of special spiritual guy who has a special connection to god. I asked about the name of that guy and he never said it. One time I said ""now you don't want me to say the name of your friend"" and he very quickly said it's not his friend, more something like his teacher with authority.

I asked about about his beliefs and he thinks there is just one right theology and way of belief and that he has this (he didn't phrase it like this but I strongly got this vibe).

I argued against some things he said and told him I don't like authoritian religious groups bc they lead to sects. At some point he said the discussion doesn't lead anywhere and that he doesn't want to talk about this anymore and said he needed to go home.

I rejected offers to go to his smallgroup, meet him tomorrow or on Saturday and to exchange numbers. 

My guess is that he is in some kind of sect/cult (maybe yehowa witnesses?) and uses bumble bff to recruit new people. It was bad vibes.

He told me last Friday that he will start working at his second job this week but he has a day off. It's his day off now and he hasn't texted and didn't pick up my call. It's the first time that this had happened because he would normally send me a text even if he's busy.

Yesterday I found out that he went on 2 dates with someone (1 was before we met, the next was after he came back) but he said nothing happened, they just met for coffee, and they barely text unlike us. He pointed out that we should have a talk about where this would go and I agreed. But instead we just planned for our trip.

I've been ghosted and played before, so I can’t help but feel that familiar anxiety creeping in. Part of me wants to believe he’s just busy or needs space, but another part of me is scared that history is repeating itself.

This place really is subtle. From the outside, it looks like a bike shop, but when you walk in, there’s actually a barista, coffee, and seats. It made me laugh a bit, but I liked it.

The place feels super calm and cozy. The music isn’t too loud, and they have this fun DJ streamer playing on the TV that fits the vibe perfectly. The decor’s minimal, which I love because it’s not overstimulating at all — perfect for an ADHD brain like mine. It’s one of those spots where you just slow down, breathe, and enjoy your coffee.

I ordered an iced dirty horchata (espresso + horchata), and wow it was good. You can choose between two coffee bean options — I picked the one with chocolate notes. The flavor was exactly what I wanted: that nice coffee bitterness mixed with smooth, creamy horchata. Not too sweet and really energizing.

Tl;dr with my lies and concealment in the past and a final dumping of the whole truth in my partner, I don’t know if we can ever recover or if they’ll ever want that. 


We have had a turbulent relationship mostly bc we are unwilling to put up w less than we think we deserve, they broke it off with me and we attempted to get back and i broke it off and then back in again after a trial dating period we became official a couple months ago. Serendipity and love brought us back together. I went abroad to study around the same time.

Since then we have been going to couples therapy (mostly my idea) but they ended up liking it too and thing felt increasingly stable despite the uncertainty of our futures. But I hadn’t been honest about the time we were apart.

There’s a few incidents. While we were dating but not yet back together as partners I spent time till 2 am at a friends house who i hadn’t seen for a while I had no feelings for but they (23m) did for me. Maybe it was spiteful bc of the confusion of not being officially together but mostly just stupid. Anyway, I told a mutual friend that there was ‘nothing for now between me and that friend and while I would consider poly I love my partner too much to even think about that.’ That comment made its way to my partner and shattered them and made them really realize the little inconsistencies and disrespect I’ve done there’s been over our 1.5 year relationship (the worst being the trickle truth and lying about periods we weren’t together and the late night incident). I got coffee a month ago with a person I had a physical thing with during our break. My partner was there too at some point. I didn’t feel I had anything to hide since there’s nothing there anymore. But now they know everything that happened back then.

I have a problem with attention seeking and it’s been a thing I have been in therapy for and since we got back together I haven’t done any of that shit. Back then I only told them part of everything that happened. Now I’ve told them everything  . I couldn’t bear to have things hidden, they deserve to know the truth. Maybe it was to free myself of the burden too.

They listened but they don’t believe fully. I would have trouble believing me too after everything. They called me a serial cheater and want to end things but are taking time to think. My heart is breaking because I know this is my fault, and while I can be proud I told them everything now, I might lose the person I love unconditionally. My best friend. To make matters worse it sporadic when we can see each other because of work/school and being long distance.

Now I wait. I don’t know if I can ever gain their trust back. I’ve felt the loss before and I’ve survived, but life is so much sweeter with them. I could never truly stop loving them but I’m sure they can move on and find someone who makes them happy. I guess that’s all I want in the end.",0,1761031810.0,relationships,2,0.33,False

for more context, i've dealt with 4 very significant recent deaths (my dad, grandma, 2 cats),  struggling with a ton of grief and living with the fact that both of my parents had passed by the time i was 24, learning how to balance finances and concern over future/money, job change, and my partner has caused me stress as well as once we moved in together it took him 1.5 years to get a job and start contributing financially, he doesn't clean or help around the house other than taking the trash out. he doesn't go grocery shopping, he doesn't really know how to cook, so any time we are actually eating healthy well balanced meals it's because i made it without his help. he doesn't help with dishes or anything afterwards. i'm not trying to use any of this as an excuse for myself gaining weight, i know my health needs to be important and a priority to me as it always has been, with or without him. and i'm aware that attraction is an important part of any relationship. but i told him that having some support in planning meals, cooking and taking care of things around the house even just a little bit will really help take some stress off of me and free up time and energy for me to focus more on getting back into shape. i said i would love it if he would work out with me sometimes as it helps to have a workout buddy or walking partner, i'd love for him to cook with me etc because its nice to do those things together. i still workout by myself at least 3x/week if not more and have a decently active job, i do not sit around all day. every time we have the conversation, he says he'll be better about doing these things, but nothing has changed. 

mind you, he's gained some weight himself and is definitely not as fit as he was when we first got together either (doesn't bother me except for the fact that he's critical of my weight and unattracted to me while he hasn't been on top of his shit either) and also wants to get back into shape as well. but his idea of getting back into shape is eating 4 eggs during the day and that's basically it for him other than coffee and energy drinks and maybe some grapes. unless i cook something, either that or we end up eating out if i'm too burnt out to do so. he has an active job now too so that's been helping him. but i feel like i'm really lacking the support and contribution from a partner who claims to love me and care about my health and i'm at a loss of what to do or say at this point. i love him, i want our relationship to get better again and i'm just looking for any advice or just hearing other people's similar experiences ",1,1761031762.0,AskMenAdvice,7,0.67,False

* BeReal is dead at my school, nobody posts anymore
* Snapchat is just streaks at this point
* VSCO felt like Instagram lite
* Pinterest good for inspo but not social
* Lapse interesting concept, didn't stick
* Fizz/ sidechat i get the concept but its weird and too anonTikTok different vibe entirely, not really a replacement

But there are plenty to look at of course. I found out about Ditto. It's newer so not everyone's on it yet but that's kind of the appeal?

I worked in-office for the first time today since my wedding, and literally no one even knew I was getting married so there was no one to talk to about it. I try to sit with people at lunch, but the conversation is mind-numbingly surface level— rarely even a ""how was your weekend."" Is it accounting brain? Does any of this seem normal?

The office is a total Office Space-style fluorescent cubicle world. I want to stress again that I LIKE bookkeeping as a job, but I may go insane if I can't look out a window or have a fun conversation once or twice a day while doing it. My last job was not at an accounting firm so I didn't know what to expect— I thought there'd be more meetings, more trainings, more chit-chat by the coffee machine. Instead everyone is just saddled with a bunch of apps to manage (we even book our desks for the day rather than have assigned ones). 

Given that my manager really seems to like me and want me to do well, I'd like to find ways to make this more workable, but if this is what a corporate job looks like post-pandemic, I don't know how long I'll make it. On the other hand, the job market is trash right now. Help!",3,1761031584.0,Accounting,1,1.0,False
1oc6hs4,https://www.reddit.com/r/zurich/comments/1oc6hs4/weird_bumble_bff_experience/,Weird bumble bff experience,"I downloaded bumble bff some weeks ago to try something new in my life. 

Yesterday I met with a guy around my (23) age and we went drink a coffee. It was quite normal we talked about our lifes and at some point we started talking about religion.

I grew up very conservative religious and I still believe in god but I'm liberal now. So it's a topic I like to talk about.

Over time he invited me several time to his Christian small group and the leader of that group is apparently some kind of special spiritual guy who has a special connection to god. I asked about the name of that guy and he never said it. One time I said ""now you don't want me to say the name of your friend"" and he very quickly said it's not his friend, more something like his teacher with authority.

I asked about about his beliefs and he thinks there is just one right theology and way of belief and that he has this (he didn't phrase it like this but I strongly got this vibe).

I argued against some things he said and told him I don't like authoritian religious groups bc they lead to sects. At some point he said the discussion doesn't lead anywhere and that he doesn't want to talk about this anymore and said he needed to go home.

I rejected offers to go to his smallgroup, meet him tomorrow or on Saturday and to exchange numbers. 

My guess is that he is in some kind of sect/cult (maybe yehowa witnesses?) and uses bumble bff to recruit new people. It was bad vibes.

Alright, I’ll admit it — making friends (or a bestie ? as an adult feels like trying to befriend an NPC with the wrong dialogue options. I’m 33, male, and somehow missed the day in adulthood school where they explained how to meet cool, like-minded people. So, Reddit, consider this my attempt at a side quest.

I’m a certified nerd: games, movies, comics, and I will 100% challenge you to a trivia night (and flirt shamelessly while pretending I didn’t Google the answers ahead of time). I’ve got a weakness for sarcasm, strong coffee, deep convos at 1am, and sending “this reminded me of you” memes way too often.

Looking for someone — friend or potentially a little weirdo like me — who can match my energy, throw a little banter back, and isn’t afraid of a little harmless mischief. If you're the type who finds comfort in shared silences, random voice notes, and staying up way too late talking about everything and nothing… we might just click.

Having said that, I got a really good referral bonus on one of those luxury high rises in rincon hill right. So I'm thinking of moving there. It's also super close to my office.

It's next to FiDi, and while that's a different neighborhood, A few years ago, people said FiDi sucked as a place to live because it's mainly for 9-5 commuters during the weekdays, and is dead on evenings and weekends. It was especially dead during Covid.

FiDi seems to be more alive now at least in the weekday thanks to companies doing RTO.  
Also, there are some bars in that downtown area like Pagan Idol and Madarae, and nightclubs like Temple. I enjoy a good walk in Salesforce Park. And Rincon Hill is close by to Target/AMC Metreon and Yurba Buena Gardens which I like. And both Embarcadero and Montgomery BART stations are close by.

Now, I don't mind having to leave the neighborhood to meet up with friends for dinner or clubbing, or to concerts and comedy shows. People complain about that stuff too much but since SF's such a small city, it's not too bad to take MUNI to other parts of the city, or even walk to nearby neighborhoods, or take the occasional Waymo/Uber. I already do that to visit friends in different parts. 

But it would be nice to have day-to-day stuff like grocery stores, coffee shops, barbers etc nearby within 10-15 min (maybe max 20 min) walking.

1oc69jl,https://www.reddit.com/r/FableSpaceCommunity/comments/1oc69jl/being_transparent_fablespaces_updated_copyright/,✨ Being Transparent: FableSpace’s Updated Copyright & Monetization Policy,"Hey everyone 💫

I’ve been reading up a lot lately about copyright laws and how they apply to fanfiction and creator platforms like FableSpace.  
We’ve always followed the basic copyright rules — but I wanted to make things even clearer and stronger so both the platform and our writers stay safe and protected in the long run.

This update doesn’t change how you use FableSpace. It just makes our stance on **copyright, ads, and donations** more transparent — and helps prevent any future legal issues as we grow.  
Basically, it’s all about keeping things fair, respectful, and open ❤️

Here’s the full updated policy 👇



# 1. Purpose

FableSpace is a community-driven fiction platform that celebrates creativity, storytelling, and fan communities. This policy explains how we handle copyright ownership, fanfiction content, and monetization (including ads and donations).



# 2. Ownership of Content

* Writers keep full rights to their **original stories** on FableSpace.
* Fanfiction writers still own their written work, but the worlds, characters, and IP belong to their **original creators** (like anime studios, authors, etc.).
* FableSpace **doesn’t claim ownership** of any story content you upload.



# 3. Use of Copyrighted Material

* Fanfiction based on existing works can be shared under **fair use / transformative use** (where applicable).
* If a rights holder ever reaches out about a story, they can contact us at [`support@fablespace.space`](mailto:support@fablespace.space), and we’ll review or remove it if needed.
* We follow valid takedown requests under the **DMCA** and similar copyright laws.



# 4. Advertising and Monetization

* Ads on FableSpace simply help **cover hosting and platform costs**.
* We **don’t own or monetize** individual fanfics — ads are for keeping the lights on, not profiting from your stories.
* Any ad revenue is treated as a **platform maintenance fee**, just like other community platforms (e.g., YouTube, Wattpad).
* Ads might appear across general pages (like home, discovery, or reading layouts), but they’re **not tied** to any specific story or fandom.



# 5. Donations and Support

* FableSpace currently **doesn’t take donations** itself.
* Some authors might share links to platforms like **Ko-fi** or **Buy Me a Coffee** — that’s totally fine! Those are **personal, user-to-user** gestures, and FableSpace isn’t involved in them.
* Fanfiction writers can receive donations as appreciation for their creativity, **not as payment for their stories or any copyrighted material**.
* Original authors (those writing their own worlds) can share support links for their work.
* FableSpace doesn’t track or process any of these transactions right now.



# 6. Content Removal and Disputes

* If a copyright holder contacts us, we’ll review the situation and take action if necessary.
* We’ll always try to notify the writer and give them a chance to respond or fix things.
* Repeated copyright violations may lead to account suspension.



# 7. Questions or Reports

If you ever have questions about copyright, ads, or anything related to this policy, feel free to reach out at:  
📩 [**support@fablespace.space**](mailto:support@fablespace.space)



This update is all about transparency — we want FableSpace to keep being a safe, respectful home for writers and readers of every kind 💛

If I did not take the lactaid pills it would make my stomach churn badly and hurt but nothing else really happened. Eventually I got sick of it and started eating mass amounts of dairy in the hope it would go away and after a couple of months it did. I loved dairy products like cheese and ice cream so I would eat a lot and never found an issue after that. Fast forward to now, I'm in college and there's not a ton of dairy options at my school so I haven't been much at all but it wasn't intentional. Very recently though, every time I eat dairy it comes back up. Today I had some coffee at around Noon and I just got some late night Boba with one of my friends and both times I've felt six and thrown it up around 5 mins after, so very soon.

Dubai Islands Beach – still quiet, great for a walk or sunset.

Crocodile Park – didn’t even know this existed until recently.

Sky Views Edge Walk – for anyone who doesn’t mind a bit of adrenaline.

Hatta Dome Park – looks like something straight out of Pinterest.


Chiller / underrated stuff:

Love Lake Al Qudra – lowkey romantic spot, great at sunset.

Alserkal Avenue – cool art vibe, nice coffee shops.

The Farm, Al Barari – greenest place in Dubai, feels nothing like the city.

Secret Beach – name says it all, perfect if you hate crowds.

I realize how ridiculous my thread might sound, but I’d still be deeply grateful to hear your thoughts.

I am between two career choices. I have no relatives to rely on and must plan carefully to remain self-sufficient for as long as possible. Right now, I am Okay. I do not have many lesions, I am on DMT, and my only symptoms are fatigue (comes and goes, coffee and Adderall help) and back muscle spasms. If I am extremely lucky, I might still have a decade or two of full-time working ability.

I hold PhD in natural sciences and am considering two pathways in US/Canada:  
(1) enroll in a one-year accelerated Bachelor of Nursing and transition into healthcare as a nurse;  
(2) pursue post-graduate pedagogical training and become a high school science teacher or a community college instructor.

I’m currently burned out and continuing my work only out of necessity (insurance coverage and savings). I still give my work my absolute best effort, but in parallel I am preparing for a change.

In choosing between these two options, I’m weighing:  
(a) health insurance  
(b) joy that work brings

ChatGPT suggests that teachers might have better insurance benefits than nurses. Can please anyone confirm or elaborate on this?

I believe I would find more personal fulfillment in nursing. However, teaching might be more adaptable in the long term. What are the realistic prospects for nurses with disabilities? Teachers can teach from a wheelchair, right?

Here’s how to make it through without turning into a zombie.

**1. Open the curtains and splash cold water.**  
Darkness = sleep mode. Light = wake-up signal for your brain. Add a splash of cold water, and you’re halfway alive already.

**2. Eat something real.**  
Coffee on an empty stomach is a rookie mistake. Go for oatmeal, eggs, or even a banana - steady energy beats caffeine crashes.

**3. Take notes - even if it’s boring.**  
Writing keeps your brain active. Passive listening = instant nap. Even if the lecture’s dry, note random facts. You’ll thank yourself later.

**4. Sit near the front.**  
Yes, it’s scary. But you won’t dare fall asleep two feet away from your professor 😆

**5. Move between classes.**  
Stretch, take a walk, grab water. Micro-activity keeps your energy up.

My friend Lila works in the same department and we have been close for about a year, often grabbing coffee or hanging out after work. Our job allows us to swap shifts if someone needs time off as long as we cover for each other, which is important since the museum gets busy and understaffing affects the visitor experience. Over the past few months, Lila’s been super unreliable about covering shifts, and it’s starting to wear on me. I’ve covered for her four times once for a last minute art gallery opening she wanted to attend, once for a family event, and twice when she said she was swamped and needed a break. I’ve been happy to help because I know our job can be intense and I’ve always made sure to handle her tasks like checking tour schedules or closing out the ticket system, so she wouldn’t get in trouble. The issue is Lila hasn’t reciprocated when I’ve needed her. The first time, I asked her to cover a morning shift for a medical appointment. She agreed but texted me an hour before that she was feeling off and couldn’t come, so I had to rush in right after my appointment. The second time I needed a day off for my brother’s birthday party, and she said she’d cover but forgot and didn’t show, forcing me to work a double shift. The third time was last week I needed a few hours off to deal with a personal issue, my car broke down, and she promised to cover my afternoon shift. Instead, she texted me during the shift saying she was caught up at a friend’s art project and couldn’t make it. I had to stay late, which delayed getting my car fixed and caused me a lot of stress. A few days ago, I finally addressed it. I said, Lila I’ve covered your shifts every time you’ve asked, but you’ve bailed on me each time I needed help. It’s starting to feel one sided, especially since our job relies on teamwork.” She got defensive, saying I was being dramatic and that her life’s been hectic lately. She said as friends, I shouldn’t keep score and should understand her situation. A coworker who overheard later told me it has always been like that with Lila and she always get defensive when being confronted. I feel like I was just asking for some fairness.

I don’t want to mess up our friendship, but I think it’s reasonable to expect her to step up occasionally especially since our roles impact how the museum runs.

1oc5tyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalThinkingIndia/comments/1oc5tyu/pollution_and_bursting_crackers_an_unpopular/,Pollution and Bursting Crackers: An Unpopular Opinion,"**Background**

I am a common man. For years, I've done my bit. Segregated waste, walked instead of drove, cut down on meat, switched off lights, didn't burst crackers, even used eco-friendly straws, and what not.

Chased every ounce of moral redemption sold under ""sustainability"". I am told every small act counts — and that if we did all our part, the planet would heal.

But then there is a rage that simmers in me, while I act ""environment friendly"", the organised and systemic flouting of environment keeps the planet decaying.

**The Apparent Reality**

The sense that individual responsibility is turned into a convenient smokescreen for industrial-scale hypocrisy. It's almost as if the system is built to make the ordinary citizen feel guilty, while the powerful outsource their guilt through PR.

Oil giants are posting record profits, corporations greenwashing disasters, and private jets taking off every minute like it's an Olympic event while the government and systems turn a blind eye.

The same people who wreck the planet then sponsor ""Earth Day"" campaigns and tell me to plant a tree. It's not environmentalism anymore — it’s theatre. We've been guilt-tripped into believing that carrying my own cloth bag is a revolution — when in reality, it’s like bringing a paper spoon to a gunfight.

I'm not against personal responsibility — it matters. But I’m done with the charade where billion-dollar conglomerates sell me “green guilt” while lobbying against climate policy behind closed doors.

**I am Tired**

I'm tired of being the scapegoat for systemic failure. Tired of the guilt, the slogans, the token gestures. My carbon footprint isn't the problem — their unchecked greed is. Until the organised polluters are held accountable, my metal straw isn't saving the planet. It's just saving their conscience.

**Change**

You want change?

Stop romanticising individual sacrifice and start demanding systemic accountability. Until then, I'll sip my coffee out of a non-biodegradable cup, burst crackers, do what thrills me, and let the billionaires worry about their private rockets punching holes in the ozone.

Thanks for reading!

PS: This year, this Deepawali, I burst crackers with wanton abundance. I will still fulfill my moral responsibility, but I won't be walking the extra mile just to dump my coffee cup or the cigarette butt.

That 3 PM energy crash is real  and for many, the go-to fix is another cup of coffee. But caffeine can lead to a short-lived spike, followed by fatigue and disrupted sleep.

A cleaner alternative? Super greens powders designed to support sustained energy, focus, and overall wellbeing without caffeine.

**Here’s why it works:**

* Nutrient-dense greens and adaptogens help reduce fatigue naturally.  
* Nootropics support focus and cognitive performance without the jitters.  
* Prebiotics and probiotics improve gut function, which plays a direct role in energy regulation.  

The result is a steady, natural lift that supports mental clarity, not just a temporary buzz.

In case it’s helpful for anyone, here are some things I found useful (and not useful) through the fourth trimester! I am not an expert in anything, and I’m certain you can do it without all this stuff, just thought I’d brain dump while it’s still fresh in case something helps someone out who’s buying things for their baby!

It got really long, really is a brain dump 😅

Hospital/recovery 

- peri bottle and spritz for bits - super helpful
- soft toilet wipes (the first poo after birth, everything is a bit fragile and swollen…) 
- anusol suppositories (see above 😅) 
- big towel (my hospital only provided little towels)
- sliders (so you can wear them over compression socks if needed)
- eye mask
- size up knickers, I was a size 12, wore 14 while pregnant and took 16s into hospital with me, right decision 
- I liked the lilets maternity pads 

Baby Clothes

- our baby girl went straight into 1month clothes as newborn was too small so worth having some options at the start 
- wish I hadn’t bought too much ahead assuming her size (ie thinking well she’ll be 6m in January so at christmas she’ll need x size) defo wish I’d waited til she was here and now I only buy her current size and the next size up
- people love to buy her cute outfits but I always seem to be buying vests and socks 
- vinted vinted vinted 😍 I have bought baby clothes brand new with tags for a fraction of the price new, cannot sing the praises enough! 
- baby girl dresses are really annoying, there I said it, I know they’re adorable but they ride up and get in the way 😭😭😭

Sleep

- she hated swaddles so these were a waste of our money - she went into sleep sacks, we like the next ones and the tommee tippee grobag ones
- she hated the moses basket, she hated being put down anywhere for the first 8w but she remained hating the moses until she outgrew it 🙃
- next to me crib, absolute lifesaver as we had to cosleep for about 8weeks which was not the plan! We have the tutti bambini cozzee air I think

Nappies and changing

- we’ve ended up with two angel care nappy bins and love them, we have one upstairs and one downstairs - they’re not a necessity though and if budget is tight there’s more important or useful things to prioritise!
- we bought the cheap ikea changing table and have it in our living room, absolute game changer as we’re not changing nappies on the floor/furniture (when I have to do this at other people’s it kills my back) 
- for a changing table upstairs we have an ikea hemnes chest of drawers with a changing thing on top, works brilliantly and loads more storage than an official changing chest of drawers 
- we like the bepathan (can’t spell it!) nappy cream but tbf I haven’t tried any others 🤷‍♀️ 

Feeding 

- we started on breastfeeding and switched to formula, I found the switch more emotionally difficult than I ever could have imagined. Whatever your choice or situation, fed is always best 💞
- I never needed nipple cream, silverettes, or shields so bit wasted money there getting them just in case, but the nipple cream makes great lip balm that’s also safe for kissing baby girl so maybe not completely wasted 😂
- when we were combo feeding we used the lasinoh teats on our mam anti colic bottles, the teats seem to be more boob like so baby girl preferred them and could “latch” onto the bottle better - we’ve stuck with the same teats now we’re exclusively formula
- we use the nuby rapid cools and do the hot shot method to make bottles up as we go, home or out and about, they’re amazing
- we have a big thermos flask that I fill each morning with boiling water and use that for bottles rather than constantly boiling the kettle - I’ve checked the temperature throughout the day and know when mine times out and needs to be refreshed 
- nursing chairs … ikea poang hands down LOVE LOVE LOVE - just get a little coffee table or something to put your phone, drink, bottle, book etc as stuff just slides off the arms! 
- muslins and bibs, we seem to go through them  like there’s no tomorrow! 

New mum stuff

- please speak to your doctor/midwife/health visitor if you’re struggling 💞
- extra tshirts, loose fitting, quick to change if you get spit up/poo on you and easy to lift up to breastfeed
- nursing bras, hated all of them tbh, m&s have some reasonably priced ones, if i had continued breast feeding i would have got the bravissimo ultimate comfort nursing one as the classic one is decent
- try and prioritise having atleast a short shower (even just a body shower) every day, baby will be ok for 5 minutes but it’s so so helpful for your mental and physical recovery ❤️‍🩹 
- I got a wrist strap for my phone and it’s helped so much, I never seem to have enough hands to carry baby, bottle, water and phone ",36,1761028366.0,PregnancyUK,17,0.97,False

Lab Reference ID: XB-01-R
Status: ACTIVE — CONTAINMENT BREACHED
Clearance Level: 3+ Required


---

Overview:
Subject XB-01-R, known internally as “The Beast”, originated from a decommissioned Original Xbox unit recovered from long-term storage. Initial condition was poor — heavy dust accumulation, internal corrosion, and severe spiritual degradation (rejected soul transfer attempts logged; see Incident 13-666).

The lab crew commenced full internal restoration: cleaning, rewiring, and forced reanimation through unconventional “game modification” procedures.


---

Experiment Log:
Multiple nights of sustained experimentation (recorded lab time: 66+ hours).
Morale fluctuated. Coffee reserves depleted. Laughter detected from Lab Sector C following injection of unauthorized mod files.

Game mod analysis inconclusive — certain code fragments stable, others volatile. Probability of digital possession event: 47%.


---

Observation Notes:
Following final calibration, XB-01-R entered dormant phase. Believed neutralized. Stored pending digital ascension (“cyber heaven”).

Reactivation occurred unexpectedly when lab personnel rediscovered the unit. Subject displayed responsive behavior post-cleaning and voltage exposure. Auditory output identified as roar sequence.

Beast restored. Functional. Hungry.


---

Conclusion:
Subject no longer classified as standard hardware.
Displays traits consistent with self-sustaining anomaly — consumes input, adapts code, rejects obsolescence.

The lab did not revive a console.
They created something else.

Designation: PROJECT BEASTIE
Threat Level: Uncontained curiosity. Approach with awe... and caution.

I started with super simple prompts of one simple sentence and worked my way up to super detailed with 3 paragraphs or more of text.

The best I've used so far though... the perfect median prompt length and format... 3 simple sections:

• First line - basic idea of the scene's format and idea (1 sentence short to long)  
• Second line(s) - summary of the scene's action and dialogue (no more than 3 sentences)  
• Third/Final line - final title card or final scene description (1 short sentence; can be used for extra description if no ""final scene"")

I try to stick to this format as closely as possible, trying not to ramble on and fit too much detail into the prompt... if anything, I try go less rather than more when prompting. I let the AI deal with some of the heavy lifting in thinking of details and scenes... I just make sure to include what I DEFINTELY want to see/hear at the most basic level of description.

A father is talking to his daughter about how you shouldn't care what other people think. Mid-sentence a big bag of nickels falls from the ceiling from out of frame and lands on the dad's crotch.

On contact, he instantly stops talking, grabs himself, and screams ""OH GOD!! BAG OF NICKELS!!"". His daughter says ""Holy shet!!""

**Liquid Universe Coffee Ad Prompt**

Commercial for Liquid Universe Coffee, the world’s strongest coffee with 2000 milligrams of caffeine per serving.

A good-looking suited man stares unblinking wide-eyed with an off-putting, hyper-caffeinated jittery look (hypercontracted pupils) into the camera holding a can and says, “I haven’t blinked in three days.”.

The narrator calmly adds, “Liquid Universe Coffee — sleep is a myth.”",4,1761027862.0,SoraAi,5,0.75,False

**Overall Construction**: Super Battle Mon is a CCG and as such has the same basic size and thickness of your standard playing card. You might want to get card sleeves to preserve your cards like you would MTG and other trading card games. I would say that these are better quality cards than that of other popular trading card games. There are special cards called Holographic and Glimmer cards that you will want to protect, but they do not appear to be any more delicate than the other cards. I have not had any issues with chipping or bending with the cards we had played with so far. I think it helps that the hand and deck size is only 7 cards. I know that the creator had his full set of cards in a binder. Each of the two decks you get in the set  have 7 cards per player and there is also a booster pack of 9 random cards in case you want to modify either or both of the decks.. 

There is a Rule sheet that is front and back glossy folded into 8 parts that includes a full checklist of all of the cards in the set.

The special cards called Holographic and Glimmer cards will have a reflective background. The rulebook says that you can tell the difference between Holographic and Glimmer cards because the picture is a different color. I had to ask the question, if you don’t have the original artwork how do you know if the color is different to tell if you have the Holographic or the Glimmer? The answer is that there is a little Glimmer on the upper left corner of the Blue Diamond.  

**Gameplay:** In order to understand how to play the game I think it helps to know your cards so let me explain this in a way people familiar with other TCG and CCGs might understand. The Cost to play the card can be found in the little Blue Diamond at the top of the yellow text box at the bottom of the card. 

Next you want to know the Power or toughness/damage of your card. It is located in the Yellow Starburst above the Mon’s name. 

There is a Type Symbol, it is essentially a faction it belongs to, one of four elements. This is important because some special abilities only work on certain elements or other effects. It is also in the text box.

Which brings us to the Ability Text Box. Aside from the Cost symbol and Type symbol, there is information on the cards abilities, and some flavor text at the bottom that can be overlooked because it is very tiny at the bottom. There are two other icons not mentioned on the rulesheet, but I have mentioned them with the creator for when revisions happen. There is a small number at the bottom that lists xxx/111, this is the number the card falls in the set. The second thing is a Banner with the number 1 in the middle of it and two laurels or pieces of wheat (honestly I’m not sure which), this is the set number. As there is currently only one set it wasn’t important to mention it in the rules. Now that we’ve covered the cards, let's cover the game itself. 

First thing to know is that when you build a deck there are 2 rules. You MUST use 7 Cards and you can’t cave more than 2 copies of any one card. I believe this includes the Holographic and Glimmer as the same basic card. To end the battle no players can have any cards in their hand and the player with the most Mons wins. Highest power wins if there is a tie.

Players will start with 7 cards in their hand. Play is done in rounds. Players will pick one card from their hand that they want to play and hold it face down.When all players are ready they will reveal their cards. You can play with or without a table, with only 7 cards it is easy to do either, but I’ll let you read the rulebook as to which way you will want to play it..

The big thing to focus on is the cards abilities and the order they resolve themselves. 

1. Passive - They are always active, even when a card is discarded.

2. Ongoing - Active while a Mon is in play.

3. Battle Phase -  THese only happen when a Mon is first revealed.

4. Cost Phase - Discard a number of cards from your hand to pay the cost to play the card.

5. On Play Phase - Plays after Battle and Cost phases when the Mon enters play.

6. Simultaneous Abilities - They both happen at the same time and you can choose to flip a coin to deal damage first, but all payments must be made at the same time.

To end the round, players compare their power in play, including bonuses. The one who loses discards a card from their hand. Then it all starts from the top until all cards have been played. 

There are other game rules on the backside with the checklist, but I’ll leave those up to you.

**Yes/No Recommend**: I like the fact that this is a small run card game that has a small hand size. I was impressed with the fact that you could play it at a table if you wanted or you could play it while you were waiting around for something. We go to a lot of conventions and parks so to be able to have something we can use to kill time is great. The art is fun and playful although it does look borrowed or copied in some cases, but not completely from other sources which I think will make it appealing to smaller kids and make other people laugh. 

I have a first printing of this game. There are a number of changes that I have talked to with the creator and have heard they have changed. So remember, that if you have a first printing, some of the wording in the rules will be changed. 

As far as the starter decks themselves I think they are slightly unbalanced. It is a good thing that it comes with a bonus booster pack because it helps with balancing out the play. To me the Blue Water deck easily beat the Red deck every time. I like the mix of cards in the booster pack and am glad you don’t have to stick to a single element when deciding which 7 cards to play. I really hope this can make a name for itself, feel free to give it a chance.

I feel it in the way that the cool breeze brushes my skin as I change from jeans and a t-shirt into what passes for pyjamas these days (a men's XXXL t-shirt). Passing the time from day into night, in the evenings that come too quickly for my liking. 

Your fingertips along my spine are replaced with too-hot water from a late evening shower. I comb through my hair, humming a song I've had on repeat for the past two days. I put more effort into my hair routine than almost anything else, trying to keep the constant bleaching and coloring from damaging it beyond repair. 

Sometimes I imagine how your fingertips might feel on my scalp instead of my own. Rougher, able to apply more pressure into a single point, working with ease. 

In my mind, I press my back against your chest, leaning up to look at you through the spray. You kiss me, gently, deeply, until the combined sensations of the warm water and your ministrations have me floating. Overwhelming, in the best way. Intoxicating.

I can imagine it all so clearly. How it would feel to have your hands gripping my sides in the shower, in the bedroom, in the kitchen over morning coffee. Looping my arms around your neck, gently pulling the hair at the back of your neck to bring you down to my height. 

All the silly things I could say to make you laugh, all the sincere words I could find to make you smile. All running through my head as I settle into bed for the night, your words in my mind. Singing me to sleep, softly, like a lullaby. ",1,1761027828.0,u_Maleficent_Spare5814,0,1.0,False

# 1. Type of Buses

Bus color in Seoul indicates its role and coverage area. 
* **Blue Bus(Trunk Bus)** - Connects Seoul’s suburban areas, city center, and major subcenters. These routes focus on speed and punctuality. 
* **Green Bus(Branch Bus)** - Provides transfer connections between trunk buses and the subway. 
* **Yellow Bus (Circulation bus)** - Runs in circular routes for local travel convenience
* **Red (Wide-area rapid Bus)** - Connects Seoul and neighboring cities in Gyeonggi Province. Seat-only express buses designed for long-distance commuters.
* **Green Smaller Local Bus (Village Bus or ""Mauel Bus"")** - Short local routes connecting neighborhoods to subway stations and nearby areas. Typically smaller and used by local residents.
* **Night Bus (N Bus or ""Owl Bus"")** - Runs between 11:10 PM and 6 AM, serving late-night workers and travelers when subways and regular buses stop operating.

---

# 2. Payment

\[**No cash**\]

* Even if you have cash in hand, you often can’t pay for your bus directly without a transportation card (e.g. T-money Card)
* Why? Since 2021, Seoul has gradually eliminated cash payments on city buses because cash payments dropped to less than 0.6%, and to improve fare management efficiency and ensure driver safety.
* Now, most buses in Seoul and Incheon no longer accept cash at all. 
* Other major cities — including Gyeonggi-do, Daejeon, Jeju, Daegu, Gwangju, and Sejong are also testing or preparing to completely remove cash fare options this year.

---

\[**No overseas-issued Credit Cards**\]

* In most big cities like London, New York, Sydney, or Tokyo, you can just tap your credit card or phone (Apple Pay, Google Pay) directly at the subway gate. This is called an “Open-loop” payment system. 
* However, Korea uses a closed-loop payment system, meaning you must buy and top up a T-money card (or similar prepaid card) to use public transportation. 
* Even if your Visa or Mastercard supports contactless “tap-to-pay”, Korean transit readers will not recognize it.
* **Exception:** Only Jeju Island now supports open-loop Visa payments (since Aug 2025). Just tap your Visa card to board Jeju city buses — no T-money needed.
* **Good News!** : Beginning next year (2026), international tourists visiting Seoul will be able to ride city buses using their overseas-issued credit cards, without needing a separate T-money transit card.

---

\[**Buy and top up a T-money card (or similar prepaid card)**\]

* You need to purchase and top up a T-money card at convenience stores (CU, GS25, 7-Eleven) or subway stations.
* For other travel card options (EZL, Namane, WOWPASS, DSP, Climate Companion, Trip.PASS), [please read this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KoreaExperience/comments/1oai5i9/locals_guide_comparing_transit_cards_pros_and/).

* Base fare (up to 10 km) + ₩100 for every 5 km
* The higher base fare will be applied as transfer charges
* Early-morning discount (before 6:30 AM): around 20% off.

\[TIP\] 
* Check real-time fare and routes using Naver Map or KakaoMap. Both apps display your total fare, distance, and transfer plan automatically in English mode.

---

**\[Transfer Rules\]**
* Transfers only apply when using a transport card 
* The card must be tapped when getting off
* Children and youth also receive the same transfer benefits, but with lower fares. 
* Up to 4 transfers (bus ↔ subway ↔ bus) within 30 minutes are free of base fare. 
  - Day transfer time : up to 30 minutes (7:00 AM-9:00 PM)
  - Late-night transfer time: up to 60 minutes (9:00 PM-07:00).
  - After the 5th ride, a new base fare will be charged.

* Same-vehicle and same-route transfers are not eligible for discounts and will be charged the basic fare again. 

[TIP]
  - If you’re making a short round trip within 30 minutes, don’t take the same bus number back. For example, if you take Bus 273 to go, try taking Bus 472 on your way back — you’ll still reach the same area but keep your transfer discount.

---

**\[Public Transport Covered by the Transfer Discount\]**

* Seoul Buses: All buses
* Incheon & Gyeonggi Buses: All buses
* Subways: All Seoul(Line 1\~9), Incheon, Gyeonggi lines (including AREX, Shinbundang, Yongin, Ui-Sinseol, Gimpo Gold Line, etc.)
* GTX-A Line: High-speed metropolitan railway also eligible for transfer discounts

--- 

# 4. Before the Ride

\[**Check out the Digital Display Board**\]
* At most bus stops in Seoul, you’ll find a digital display board showing when each bus will arrive. It lists the bus number, destination, and estimated arrival time — usually in minutes (e.g. 3 min, 7 min).

* These screens update in real time, so you can see if your bus is approaching or delayed. If your bus doesn’t appear on the board, double-check that you’re standing at the correct stop and direction.

---

\[**Check the Exact Location of Your Bus Stop**\]

* In Seoul, it’s very important to check the exact location of your bus stop before you go. Some bus stops are located on the side of the road, while others are in the center of the street (called median bus lanes).
* If you stand at the wrong stop, your bus might pass right by on the opposite side! Use Naver Map or KakaoMap to check the exact bus stop location and direction. These apps show both “inbound” and “outbound” stops, so make sure you’re waiting on the correct side for your route.

---

\[**How to Signal the Bus Properly**\]
* If you’re the only person at a bus stop, gently wave your hand to signal the driver that you want to board. Otherwise, the driver may assume no one is waiting and pass by without stopping.
* If you try to wave the bus down outside an official bus stop, the driver will not stop or pick you up even if the driver sees you or the bus is empty. This is because it’s against Korean traffic law.

---

\[**Red Bus (Wide-area rapid Bus) Stops**\]

* Red Bus stops are for routes going to Gyeonggi Province (outside Seoul). They are often separate from regular city bus stops and may have different platforms or lanes, so double-check the signs or platform letters before boarding.
* Unlike other buses, people line up in queues before boarding for red buses because the buses do not allow standing passengers (all seats must be taken before departure). Thus, always check out platform number or bus number, usually marked on the ground.
* At the front of the bus, you’ll see a digital sign showing remaining seats (e.g., “Seats: 2”). If it says “Full” or “0,” wait for the next bus. (You can also find seat availability through Naver Map or KakaoMap (or Kakaobus).

---

\[**Smaller Green Bus (Village or ""Maeul"" Bus) Stops**\]

* The ""Maeul Buses"" usually stop at smaller neighborhood bus stops, often just a few meters away from main bus stations. These stops are usually simpler, with small green poles instead of full shelters.
* Since routes are short and mostly serve local residents, make sure you’re at the exact stop listed in your app before boarding.

\[Tip\]

*  The ""Maeul Buses"" can be confusing or inconvenient for first-time visitors. They mostly serve local neighborhoods and are used by residents who already know the routes.
* Even if you transfer from a subway station, these buses don’t leave immediately, they often depart according to their set schedule rather than on demand. Because of this, you may have to wait 10–20 minutes depending on the route and time of day.
* So unless your destination is deep inside a residential area, it’s usually more convenient to walk or take a green city bus instead.

---

\[**Hold Your Card in Your Hand Before the Bus Arrives**\]
* In Korea, bus boarding is lightning-fast (usually under 2\~3 seconds per person!) Locals already have their transit card, phone, or credit card ready in hand before the bus even stops.
* If you start digging through your bag for your card at the door, you might feel uncomfortable stares from the locals behind you.

---

# 5. Inside the Bus

\[**How to Board a Bus**\]

* Korean buses have different boarding and exit doors depending on the type of bus.
   * Blue, Green, Yellow Buses (City Buses) - Board: Front door / Exit: Rear door
   * Red Buses (Wide-area rapid Buses) - Board & Exit: Front door only
   * Green Smaller Buses (Village Buses or “Maeul Bus”) → Only one door

---

\[**How to Use a Transit Card**\]

* When you get on, tap your transit card on the card reader next to the driver.
* Before stepping off, tap your card again on the rear card reader to check out. (This second tap is very important which tells the system your ride is complete.)
* If you forget to tag your card when getting off, you may hear no message, but you’ll lose your transfer discount and be charged the maximum fare next time.
* You’ll also lose your transfer discount, meaning you’ll pay the full fare again for your next bus or subway ride.
* If you’re paying for more than one person, tell the driver the number of passengers before tapping your card.

---

\[**Understanding Korean Transit Card Reader Messages**\]

* You’ll hear one of followings:
   * **Beep!** — “Normal fare applied.” → Your card has been accepted and the fare is paid.
   * **“환승입니다” (Hwan-seung im-ni-da)** — “Transfer applied.” → The system recognizes your transfer from another bus or subway within the allowed time. You’ll only pay the difference, not the full fare again.
   * **""잔액이 부족합니다” (Jan-aek-i bu-jok-ham-ni-da)** — “Insufficient balance.” → Your card doesn’t have enough money. Please recharge at a convenience store or subway top-up machine before riding again.
   * **“처리할 수 없습니다” (Cheo-ri-hal su eop-seum-ni-da)** — “Card error / Cannot process.” → The card didn’t scan properly. So try to tap again, or use another card.

---

**\[Paying for Multiple People on a Bus\]**

* Tell the driver how many people ""before"" you tap the card.
* The driver will register the number on their terminal, then you tap once and the system charges the correct fare for everyone.
* If you don’t speak Korean, no worries. Just use your fingers to show the number (e.g., hold up two fingers for two people). Drivers understand this gesture.

\[TIP\]

* If you’re transferring between the subway and bus, please do not use one card for multiple riders subway transfers are not allowed and you’ll lose your transfer discount.
(Each passenger must tap their own card at the subway gate.)
* Also, if you’re traveling with children, you can buy a child T-money card (available at convenience stores or subway stations). It automatically applies the child fare when tapped.


---

**\[Seating & Etiquette\]**
* **Priority seats (yellow or orange) and Pregnant seats (pink)**  
   * They are usually located near the front of the bus and reserved for the elderly, people with disabilities, pregnant women, and passengers with infants.  
   * Sometimes people sit in priority seats if no one else needs them. (On buses, the rules are a bit more relaxed than in the subway.) However, if an elderly person or pregnant woman (or child) is standing near you, it’s polite to stand up and offer your seat immediately.  
* **No eating or drinking.**
   * Food and drinks (even coffee) are not allowed on the bus.
   * Sealed or packaged drinks are fine to bring with you.
   * If you’re in the middle of eating or holding an unsealed drink (like an open coffee cup or uncovered food), the driver may refuse boarding to keep the bus clean and safe.
* **Don’t block the driver’s area or the exit.**
   * It’s important to move toward the back as soon as you board so that other passengers can get on quickly.
* **Keep your voice down.**
   * Talking loudly, taking phone calls, or playing music without headphones is considered impolite.
* **Hold onto the handrails or straps.** 
   * Buses often brake suddenly due to traffic.
   * If you hold onto the straps, you will get a good arm workout. It's also quite hard to keep your balance with the strap moving each turn, so if possible, grab onto one of the solid, fixed bars instead.


---

# 6. Getting Off the Bus

**\[Press the red “Stop” button (하차벨) before your stop\]**     
* It is a right time to press the button right after the you stop is announced.
* If you don’t press the stop button in advance, the bus may skip your stop completely.   
 
**\[After pressing the button, move toward the exit door\]**  
* If you stay seated until the last moment, the driver might think no one is getting off and leave the stop before you reach the door.   
* If the bus is crowded and people are standing, you might not be able to get off easily when the bus stops. So it’s polite and practical to move toward the door before your destination. 

**\[Always tap your card on the reader\]**  
* If you forget to tag your card when getting off, you may hear no message, but you’ll lose your transfer discount and be charged the maximum fare next time.

\[TIP\]
* Always check your route in Naver Map or KakaoMap. They show your live bus location and next stop in real time.

**\[If you missed your stop or in an emergency\]** 
* If the bus hasn’t left the stop yet, you can politely tell the driver:
  * “내릴게요!” (Naeril-geyo) → “I am getting off here!” 
  * “내려주세요.”(Naeryeo-juseyo) → “Please let me get off.”
  * The driver will usually open the door again for you if it’s still safe and before departure.
* However, once the bus starts moving, you cannot ask the driver to stop in the middle of the road that’s against traffic law and for safety reasons. 
(Korean buses run on tight schedules, and drivers must follow traffic and timing rules strictly. So even if you politely ask, the driver cannot stop once the bus is moving.
It’s not rudeness. It matters safety and regulations.)

**\[What to do if you miss your stop\]** 
* Just stay on until the next bus stop.
* After getting off, cross the street and take a bus going in the opposite direction.
* To avoid paying the full fare again, don’t take the same bus number immediately.
* Instead, board a different bus on the same route or transfer to the subway.
* Your transfer discount will still apply if you tag your card correctly within 30 minutes.

# 6. Night Bus (N Bus or ""Owl Bus"") 

* All night bus routes begin with the letter “N”, which stands for “Night.”  
* Night buses operate approximately between 11:10 PM and 6:00 AM and are designed to serve late-night workers and travelers when subways are closed.
* These buses are easily recognizable by their dark blue color and the “N” prefix on their route numbers (e.g. N26, N37, N61).
