1gr8as3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PubTips/comments/1gr8as3/qcrit_title_under_work_adult_speculative_fantasy/,[Qcrit] Title under work Adult Speculative Fantasy Novel (110k),"Hi pubtips,

I need help! I have queried 30 agents over 4 months and keep on getting fast rejections or no responses. I would love some feedback on my Query Letter. 

Dear Agent,

I think my manuscript TITLE TBD (110,000 words) would be a great fit for your list as you are seeking ****. TITLE TBD is a dual-POV adult speculative fantasy novel with splashes of romance, magic, and mystery. This manuscript will appeal to readers that love magical elements similar to THE FAMILIAR by Leigh Bardugo and an inventive setting and characters similar to QUICKSILVER by Callie Hart.

Bratin is stuck collecting stones for the Nightshade syndicate, while secretly yearning secretly for her freedom. When a stone she collected is stolen from her syndicate employer, she is accused of treason and exiled. Now vulnerable and without protection, her past comes knocking at her door, demanding revenge. To stay alive, Bratin has only one option: run.

Aon, ruthless leader of the neighboring Blackthorn Syndicate, is losing his magic and his members are counting on his demise. He becomes enraged after a traitor foils his last attempt at solving his mystery. Now, truly out of options, he will do anything to maintain control over his syndicate. After all, a weak leader is a dead one. After an orchestrated meeting with a collector, he comes to a single conclusion: she is exactly what he needs, and he will do whatever it takes to have her—even having her framed for a crime she didn’t commit.

Aon and Bratin forge a fragile alliance, in which they unbraid the web of lies and betrayals only to learn they share a common enemy; a new enigmatic syndicate with plans to overthrow the syndicates and eradicate anyone that stands in their way. They must defeat this new syndicate before they lose everything: her freedom, his magic, and maybe even each other.

I’m a coffee enthusiast who enjoys solving puzzles in my free time with my husband and my dog. This book was inspired by my personal struggle to rediscover my hobbies and my authentic self once I graduated from school and began working in corporate. 

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you

1gr893g,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1gr893g/cant_sleep/,Can’t sleep,"Unable to achieve good sleep

Hello, I’ve been unable to have a good sleep for awhile now, what can I do?

So as the title states, I’ve been trying to have a good sleep health for about a few months now, but I just can’t achieve it. I fell asleep at 8pm and I’ll wake up at 12am, just to not be able to sleep the whole night and end up working with 4 hours of sleep. It’s not optimal, I’m not sharp minded because of this. My last cup of coffee is at 11am latest. I have no idea what’s stopping me from getting a good nights sleep. I turn off all devices and mute notifications one hour before sleep. What am I doing wrong? Why can’t I just sleep! 

As someone who also gyms (I’ve taken a break as of recent), it’s very important to be able to have a good sleep so it worries me that no matter what I do I just can’t achieve it. I’m genuinely in fear because what’s wrong with me that I can’t even do the simple task of sleeping. It’s ruining my day to day life and making things harder than they should be. Ultimately I’m embarrassed and ashamed that I can’t do the simple task of sleeping.

Please do note that I’ve tried everything I could… I put the phone down early, I am outside when I can be, I close my eyes and lay down. And then I’m just there, thinking for the next 30 minutes because I have an internal dialogue and a loud mind, but that usually doesn’t stop me from sleeping. Why am I only able to achieve four hours of sleep? Thanks for your help.",1,1731600524.0,NoFap,1,1.0,False
1gr88vv,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1gr88vv/good_vibes/,Good vibes,"Little back story. 2 years ago, I met a great gal here on Reddit from a r4r post. She so happened to be a short drive from where I live. ( short being 120 miles, 1.5 hour drive ) We clicked on so many levels. Had one opportunity to meet in person. ( more of a coffee date ). The date went great and things felt like they we on the up. 

A week after meeting, she broke some sad news. She was moving across the country do get away from a bad situation. She felt bad for leading me on but wanted to keep in touch. We stayed friends and have talked almost daily since. She has become that friend that I can openly talk to about my feelings. The ups and downs of this life style. I always played with the idea of taking a trip out to were she is now to visit and spend time away from the daily norm. 

Recently I started a new job and I was given the go ahead to find training opportunity for my new job and work towards my new career goals. I didn't hesitate and began my search. The more and more I looked, the more I saw training and up coming conferences out in her general area. One so happen to be a state away but still to far away to see each other. 

I couldn't pass up the opportunity to do two of my favorite things, travel and learn. With out hesitation, I pitched the idea to my boss to let me travel to the conference. A large part of me didn't think that he would give me the go ahead. But to my surprise, he asked for me to go ahead and give all the details and prices to accounting and they would book everything. I was over the moon. Work is paying for my training and sending me across the country.

With my excitement, I told my friend and confided in her on how nervous I was to go to a big city and not knowing how to get around or what to do while I'm out there. I asked so many stupid questions. After getting my schedule and itinerary setup, I told her all the details. To my delight, she said she was going to visit me for a short day while I'm out there. I breathed a sigh of relief knowing that I had someone that would show me the ropes of big city life. 

The moral to this is, Just because things didn't work out in my favor, I still made a great long lasting friendship from being here and to never give up. There is always someone out there, They are just hard to find. Maybe you to will find that someone. Just stay positive and never give up. ",2,1731600509.0,adultery,1,1.0,False
1gr883f,https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/1gr883f/dinks_looking_to_leave_kentucky/,DINKs looking to leave Kentucky,"My wife and I live in Louisville, KY and are interested in leaving for political reasons. We are in our 30s, both working professionals, have no intention of having kids, and have a dog that we are active with (dual income no kids with a dog = DINKWADs). I am from Grand Rapids, MI and my wife has lived here her whole life. 

Criteria we are looking for: 

- Medium or large city 

- ~$700k budget for a house that can accommodate two cars in a nice/clean/safe area of town 

- We could do urban or suburban, but we want a house with a yard for a garden and the dog. We like the semi-urban 1920s-1940s neighborhoods and homes that are common in the Midwest. A garage (or the option to build a garage) if there is significant precipitation.

- Consistently or trending liberal state legislature and governor 

- Not further south than Louisville, KY- we do not enjoy the heat and humidity, which is getting worse. Summers are nearly unenjoyable  for us here. As we get older we are getting less tolerant of extreme heat.

- Abundance and accessibility of city parks/ green spaces *with walking trails/paths*. I want to highlight the trails/paths portion. we enjoy walking with our pup and get weekly use out of parks. 

- Greater regional recreation- we love taking day and weekend trips to go camping, backpacking, and hiking. Accessibility to nice state and/or national parks is a priority.

- Walkability or bikability to a few amenities such as parks or a coffee shop would be huge, but we are looking at this realistically- given the car dependence of our cities, it's not required, especially in suburbs. But it would be an extra benefit to quality of life. 

- Job availability- I work remotely, but my wife would need to get a new job. She is an accounting controller, so there needs to be a sizeable industry with demand for high-level accountants.

We have a list of ideas and thoughts, but are open to any and all recommendations. These are in no particular order. 

Minneapolis - seems to be the most affordable large city, we could live within the urban core and be able to comfortably maintain our current standard of living. Lots of parks and green spaces. The winter is the question. I can handle it, my wife isn't sure.

Denver - Lots of greater recreation options for longer or say trips, but it appears that parks with walking trails are less predominant. We would likely live on the west side to be closer to the mountains. It feels like the city has outgrown itself and driving anywhere outside of your ""area"" could be stressful. 

Greater Boston/Providence area - would probably be more towards/in Providence. My wife has family in Worcester, MA that we would be closer to. Seems like it has a reasonable cost of living for a NE city. Unsure on parks and recreation and amenities as a whole as it's not that ""big.""

Sacramento - Not much research on this yet, but it's close to beautiful state parks and there appear to be a plethora of houses in our price range.",0,1731600454.0,SameGrassButGreener,1,0.5,False

","This is a throwaway because my family knows my Reddit. Sorry about the length. I, 43F, am the parent of three boys: 23, 18, and 15. A bit of background about me: my parents were teenagers when they had me. Being a teenage parent seems to just run in my family. So when I had my oldest, I promised myself I would ensure my kids broke that cycle. We talked about sex and relationships so much that my kids would run the minute they saw me, just in case I brought it up, LOL. I would stress condoms; as a matter of fact,  I would just buy them and tell them to let me know if they run out, no questions asked. I would also stress things like fending for yourself and having your own. Especially do not give up your apartment for your girlfriend until you know she will be your wife. I’ve seen too many men fall for this and wind up homeless and moving back to their parent's home because the love didn’t last. Fortunately, this level of openness allowed my kids to be open with me about it, too. So far, it’s working, so fingers crossed. 



My oldest, who has autism and ADHD, moved into his first apartment, and I was genuinely proud to watch him navigate life as an adult, learning to pay bills, care for himself, and become independent and confident. Just for reference, my son was diagnosed with autism and ADHD as a child, so these milestones mean the world to me. He came over for dinner, and we began having a conversation about dating. He mentioned that if he sees a woman he likes, he will go for it, with no questions asked, no matter the age. Due to being a product of teenage parents and personal preference, I have a significant issue with these “May/December” romances. I believe they are unequal, and the younger person eventually gets taken advantage of, basically used and abused. And really, who wants to date their mom or dad? That is just icky. I was taken aback and explained these points to him very strongly. I told him at 23, I expect him to go wherever his dumb stick points him. Have experiences and learn from them, even with an older woman. But not that old. The power dynamic is on her side. 



He then told me he has been dating a woman he met at work. He began talking fast about how much I would like her, how she is just like me: strong, independent, intelligent. Her birthday is even 7 days after mine, so it would be like having a sister. He then told me that this individual is ACTUALLY 7 days younger than me; she is my age and has a daughter who is one year older than my middle son. Then he put the cherry on top and said he was giving up his apartment and moving in with her. I will admit I flipped the fuck out. I told him the same things again and added, “Let’s be honest. You are barely five years out of high school. What, possibly, could a woman 20 years older than you want other than your penis? There is no meeting of the minds; you haven’t had enough life experience even to understand the same things someone 5 years older than you understands, let alone someone my age. This is the equivalent of a high school teacher dating their students. Yeah, it’s great for her ego to say she has a young lover, but what are you going to do after you blow her back out? Discuss politics? How the Fed needs to lower interest rates to help the middle and lower classes? You are just figuring out how to pay bills with one hand and wipe your own ass with the other. She is using you for her fantasy and stupidly got caught up in it. The only thing that is going to happen is that after you put her old ass in traction, she will wake up and realize that she is raising another child and kick you to the curb. And what will you have to show for it? Nothing, because you gave up everything you worked hard to achieve to be with her.” This conversation went on for a while; suffice it to say, we did not see eye to eye. 



I insisted on meeting this woman, so we scheduled a meeting for a couple of days later. The night before, he called to say they needed to cancel because she was nervous about meeting us, so we rescheduled - three more times with the same excuse. Finally, his move-in day approached, and I put my foot down. We finally arranged a meeting at a local restaurant. No, I was still not happy about it. My husband tried to talk me down during this period, and for the most part, I told myself I would be open, even if it were just for my son’s sake. He kept explaining that if I openly opposed this relationship, my son would dig his heels in and stay with her, just to try to prove us wrong, and that, worse than that, I could lose him. I guess the nerves for this meeting got to me; I hadn’t slept at all the night before and could barely talk; I had lost my voice. Since I was sleepy and, therefore, uber cranky, my husband and I got into a heated argument. I still don’t remember what it was about, but I can tell you it was a nothing issue. We weren’t even speaking to each other when we left to meet them. 



We arrived at the restaurant and met her for the first time in the foyer while waiting to be seated. My husband explained about my voice, and we sat down. My husband was chitchatting with them, asking questions, and generally being the good guy he always was. I, on the other hand, was sitting there stewing. I kept telling myself not to say anything, that losing my voice was divine intervention. I could feel the nerves on her as well. We ordered coffee and tea, and I went to the restroom. When I returned, they were still discussing the relationship, how they met, their plans, etc. The question came up on why they thought it was a good idea to live together, and she began explaining how she was hesitant at first but realized what a wonderful man I had raised, so mature, so open, so giving and caring, that he won her over. She wants to give him everything and provide him with the world. He opened her eyes to what could be.



I was retching on the inside. At that point, I asked about her marital status. She is divorced with a 19-year-old daughter. Well, where is the kid living? She is off at school and doesn’t live at home, so she won’t be an issue in the relationship. My son even interjected that the daughter asked him questions and told him she gave her blessing and not to hurt her mother. This woman kept talking, and admittedly, I didn’t hear everything she said because of my own inner monologue when she mentioned something about having kids. I tuned in and said, “Yes, let’s talk about kids. You know, my son has always wanted them. Has he explained his autism diagnosis to you? No? That is a consideration because whoever he has children with will have to have the stamina and fortitude to deal with it if the children are diagnosed.  Let’s also discuss that you are dating a man who is not much older than your child. Is it that difficult to find a bed buddy your own age? And let’s add to that the fact that you are not young. Let’s be honest: you live next door to menopause and across the street from the graveyard. How can you possibly be able to make sure that the future my son has envisioned for himself could be achieved when your eggs are damn near hard-boiled?” 



Things fell apart from there. She began screaming, yelling, and cursing, and so did I. She stormed out of the restaurant—we didn’t even order food, just coffee and tea—and we all followed, arguing. My son was beyond upset, yelling at me for being mean to his girlfriend and yelling at her for disrespecting his mother. My husband was yelling at me, too, for not doing as he asked and being civil. 



I did apologize to my son at the restaurant and later in a phone call for hurting his feelings, but not what I said because it needed to be said.  



Now that I am a few days removed from it, I could have handled that better. I can accept that I was the asshole for the things that I said and how I dealt with the situation overall. When I am pissed, I can get vicious. I guess I am asking internet strangers how bad did I fuck up?

2) Burn- 9.2/10 never ever expected this song to be like sooo good. It was my least anticipated song but was soo sooo good. It lingered in the territory of rock music.
3) Ghost- 9.3/10 It was an almost perfect song and i loved the drums in that song. It was almost near perfect. It had like one of the best lyrics in the entire album
4) Gaslight- 8.3/10 It was also a pretty good song a little better than mediocre. Loved the instrumentals tho also seens a bit short.
5) Stranger- 9.8/10 it was imo like the best or second to best song in the entire album like the final chorus was like REALLY GOOD and also the vocals last verse were one of the best.
6) Backseat- 8.7/10 i originally didnt like the concert version but it turned out to be much much better than i expected it is like perfect length
7) Coffee- 6.2/10 it was the only song in the album that i didnt really like. Dont get me wrong but it was pretty great but when i heard the mls i had high expectations from this song and think it had much better potential
8) Paper planes- 8.1/10 i think i need to listen to this song a bit more and i think its rating might change once i hear it a few times but until then nothing really to say about this song
9) Pertichor- 8.9/10  I loved lucid interlude but this was like the perfect interlude. It was really chill and i loved it
10) Pitfall- 9.1/10 i think i need to listen to it more too and i think its rating might increase after a few listens but the thing that i didnt like about this song was like the intrumentals really overpowered the vocals and the vocals could not be heard much. I also had like much much higher expectations from this song.
11) Corduroy- 9.7/10 Didnt really like the mls and wasnt much into it but i think the actual song flows wayy better and i absolutely love the song afyer the beatdrop
12) love lost- 9.7/10 I knew this song was going to be amazingg and it did turn out to be. The vocals were i think the best part of the song also the melody and the flow of the song was crazyy good.
13) Easier- 9.9/10 It is my favourite song out of the album the vocals were really really good, the drums and the composition was the best. This was really a masterpiece imo like my most favourite song from him ever. Its PERFECT length and is almost perfect.
14) Change- 9.4/10  Its like a really good and chill song and i think a really good end to boywithuke. I freaking loved it
Overall album rating would be 8.7/10 as the songs themselves were really really good but all the songs together as one album didnt really make sense to me as it seemed like bunch if random songs stuffed in a single album so i wouldnt say its my favourite album but most of my favourite bwu songs are from this album",3,1731600266.0,boywithuke,1,1.0,False

Cassandra, volatile with rage, tossed her husband’s cell phone to the floor of their bedroom, intending for the device to clatter and crash melodramatically when it connected with the wood tile. It landed screen-up and spun towards Tom’s feet, gliding smoothly against the ground like an air hockey puck. He hastily bent over to stop his phone’s forward motion, pocketing it without looking at the screen. Tom already knew what pictures would be opened on his messaging app. Instead, he went silent and did not argue, turning his head away from her and submissively placing his hands in the air. The motion was meant to represent a white flag of surrender, but more than that, it was a way of admitting guilt without asking for forgiveness. 

Wordlessly, he pushed past his wife to grab a pillow from his side of the bed and then paced quickly out of the room. Tom turned right as he exited, carefully stepping over a few unopened moving boxes to make his way to their new home’s staircase. With a sound like rolling thunder, he stomped and pounded each foot against every step on his way up. Every petulant boom reverberated and echoed in Cassandra’s mind. When Tom reached the attic, he bellowed something that was clearly meant to be a defamatory finale to his boyish tantrum, but she couldn’t make out exactly what he said from where she still stood motionless in the bedroom. At that moment, any lingering regret about dosing her husband for the first time that morning with the Curandero’s poison evaporated from her, remorse made steam by the molten heat of her seething anger. 

—---------------------------

*“If I’m an animal, you’re a goddamned blood-sucking leech, Cassandra!”* 

Tom’s retreat from his wife had been both unanticipated and expeditious. To that end, he could not think of a retort to her jab until he was three steps out of the bedroom, but he held onto the retort until he reached the safety of the attic’s doorframe. He knew he could belt out his meager insult from that distance without fear of an additional counteroffensive. As soon as the words spilled from his mouth, he tumbled past the threshold into the attic and slammed the door behind him. 

It wasn’t his fault Shiela was swooning over him, Tom smugly mused. She had volunteered those digital pinups of her own volition. That said, he had been actively flirting with the young secretary since the couple landed in Texas two months ago. Their marriage had been in a death spiral for years, in no small part due to Tom’s cyclical infidelity. The cross-country move had been a last-ditch attempt at resuscitating their relationship, but of course, Maine was never the problem to begin with, so the change of scenery mended nothing. In his middle age, Tom developed a gnawing desire to feel warm-blooded and virile. Cassandra’s despondency had the exact opposite effect. She made him feel undesired - sexually anemic. That night was not the first time he had called her a “blood-sucking leech” for that very reason. However, if Tom had been gifted the power of retrospection, he may have noticed that his wife’s frigid disposition became the norm after the discovery of his second affair, not after his first. 

—---------------------------

*“I want something that will make him feel even a small fraction of the insanity he’s put me through”*

Cassandra whispered to the Curandero, visually scanning the entire antique store for possible interlopers or undercover police officers before she asked the purveyor of hexes standing behind the counter for anything definitive and incriminating. Multiple family members had recommended this unassuming shop on the outskirts of downtown Austin for an answer to Tom’s beastliness. The apothecary grinned and asked her to wait a moment, turning to enter a backroom concealed by a red silk curtain. The witch doctor was not what Cassandra expected - she couldn’t have been older than thirty, and she certainly did not present herself like a practitioner of black magic. No cataracts, scars or gemstone necklaces - instead, she sported an oversized gray turtleneck with part of a floral sundress peeking out from the bottom. 

She returned seconds later, tilted her body over the counter, and handed Cassandra a vial no bigger than a shot glass. Inside the vial were innumerable tiny blue crystals. They were slightly oblong and transparent, looking like the illegitimate children of rock candy and fishfood. The Curandero cheerily instructed Cassandra to give her husband the entire ampule’s contents over the course of about three days. As she left the store, the shopkeeper cryptically reassured Cassandra that her husband would be thoroughly educated on his wrongdoings by the loving kiss of retribution. 

—---------------------------

*“Why is it so fucking cold up here”*

Tom mumbled to himself, doing laps around the perimeter of his makeshift sleeping quarters in the attic. It had been approximately three weeks since their argument and his subsequent relocation. At first, he didn’t much mind it. The cold war between him and Cassandra was taxing, but he had his phone and Shiela’s escalating solicitations to keep him company. But as of the last few days, he had begun to feel progressively unwell - feverish and malaised. Then he noticed the small lump on the underside of his left wrist. 

It was about the size of a dime, skin-colored, immobile, and profoundly itchy. Tom felt like he spent almost every waking minute massaging the area. The irritation then became accompanied by white-hot burning pain, gradually extending up his arm as the days passed. One night, as he scratched the area, the lump moved a centimeter closer to his palm. He paused to inspect the change, assuming the vexing cyst had finally been dislodged and neutralized. After a few seconds, however,  it moved again - but in the opposite direction and without Tom’s help. And then again, slightly further up his forearm. Revitalized by panic and confusion, he began clawing recklessly at the lump, until the skin broke and a small black button was liberated from the wound, only to scurry away to an unseen sanctuary. Tom thought the button looked and moved like a deer tick. 

—---------------------------

*“Sure, Tom, come back down. But to the couch, for now, okay?”*

Cassandra had accepted many empty apologies from Tom before, but something about this most recent one felt slightly more sincere. By this point, she had completely forgotten about the Curandero and her vengeful prescription. Cassandra had gone through with slipping the contents into Tom’s coffee over the course of three days, but that was over a month ago. At the time, she did not really believe it was black magic - she assumed it was a military-grade laxative or some other, ultimately benign, poison. 

The more she thought about Tom’s behavior, however, she came to realize that she may have been mistaking a sincere apology for what was actually fear and need for comfort. Cassandra had not interacted much with Tom in the past few weeks, but now that she was, he was certainly acting off. Seemingly at random, he would slam his palm down on himself or something else in front of him and then would be unwilling to give an explanation. He slurred his words like a drunken sailor, but as far she could tell, he hadn’t been drinking. When she looked into Tom’s eyes to find that his pupils were rapidly dilating and constricting like black holes on the verge of collapse, the realization hit like a lightning strike up her spine. Cassandra remembered the vial with the blue crystals. 

She was at the Curandero’s shop within the hour, catching the witch doctor right as she was locking up her store. Cassandra pleaded with her for an antidote to whatever magic or venom was now in Tom’s system. In response, the shopkeeper produced another identical vial from her jacket pocket, twisted the cap off, and dropped a few of the crystals into her mouth:

*“It’s dyed salt, my love”* the Curandero said, then pausing to tap out a few fragments onto the backside of Cassandra’s hand as a means to corroborate her claim. *“I don’t sell power, just the idea of power. Whatever you made manifest, I only provided the inspiration”*

Confused and without clear direction, Cassandra returned home to check on her husband. 

—---------------------------

Tom had never been thirstier in his entire life, but he could not drink. Every time he poured himself water, he carefully inspected it through the transparent glass, only to find it contaminated with hundreds of ticks - an entire galaxy of black stars drifting aimlessly through the liquid microcosm. Sitting at his kitchen table with his head in his hands, Tom cried out in agony, only to have his wail cut short by his vocal cords unexpectedly snapping shut. 

What had started as an infestation had become a plague. 

The gentle touch of a hand on his shoulder nearly scared him half to death, causing him to jump back off his chair and knock the infested glass off the table and onto the kitchen floor, shattering it instantly. He took a breath, seeing that it was only Cassandra, but that relief was short-lived when he looked back down to see an armada of nymphs moving on his position. He yelped and scrambled on top of a cabinet. His wife moved forward, seemingly to comfort him. When she held his hand, Cassandra noticed the open wound where that first tick had sprouted, and she rushed into the other room to procure bandages. For a moment, Tom felt safe. His wife began attending to his wound while he was still perched on the cabinet. But then he felt a pinch on his left wrist, followed by an intense lacerating sting, and then finally, the sensation of warm fluid gushing down his palm. When he looked down, his wife looked up at him in tandem. 

Cassandra’s mouth had mutated into a pulsating arena of hooked teeth, with plasma delicately dripping from the barbs she had just used to bite into him. In one swift motion, Tom pivoted his torso, unsheathed a blade from a nearby knife block, drove it deep into the creature’s abdomen, and sprinted out the house and into the street. 

—---------------------------

Cassandra nearly bled out on her kitchen floor, but a neighbor heard the commotion and had called the police. 

She awoke in the ICU surrounded by family. When she asked them what happened, they paused awkwardly and traded solemn expressions with each other instead of explaining. When Cassandra pressed for information, they flagged down her doctor from the hallway.

The physician did not mince words with Cassandra. Tom was dead - he had been picked up by the police fleeing the neighborhood but had been delivered to the same ICU she was currently in when he started to wheeze violently and turn blue.  

*“Do you have any pets, dogs especially?”* The doctor asked. *“Where in your house do you and your husband sleep? Have you ever seen any bats in your home?”*

Cassandra explained that they had bought their home recently, that Tom had been sleeping alone in their attic after a particularly nasty argument, and that she had seen a bat fly out a window once when they were moving in. She then detailed her husband’s odd behavior in the time leading up to her assault. 

The physician frowned and then elaborated on their suspicions:

*“The dilating pupils, the hallucinations, the fear of water, and the inspiratory spasms - they all suggest that your husband contracted rabies while living in your attic. Most of the time, people in the US contract the disease from a dog bite. However, bats are known to transmit the disease, too. What’s worse - if bats are in your home, they can bite you in your sleep without you waking up. If contracted, the disease is universally fatal, and there is no known treatment.* 

*Tom died from his airway spasms.* 

*You nearly died, too - from blood loss. Did you know you have an extremely rare blood type? AB negative. Only 1% of the population has this blood type, and unfortunately, the hospital has been critically low on replacement blood that is AB negative for almost a month now.* 

*We were initially very concerned - you needed more AB negative blood than we had, but as serendipity would have it, Tom was AB negative as well. Imagine that.* 

*Thankfully, rabies cannot be contracted through the blood - only through saliva. That’s why it is contracted through bites. Although it was unconventional, our administration gave us the green light to give you a large portion of his blood. In essence, Tom’s blood saved your life”*

The doctor paused, waiting patiently for whatever questions Cassandra had. 

But she had none. Instead, there was an eerie, uncomfortable silence for almost a minute.

Then, Cassandra tilted her head back, closed her eyes, wept, and had a very long laugh.

all that to say, I have argued with MANY customer over my year of working here about the fact that we don't offer organic honey, multiple people demanding we talk to our owner about it

look, i understand wanting some self-serve honey, but 

a) why do you think we have ANY say in this company? 
b) we are a full service bar. if you want a coffee with cream and sugar, we do that for you. we do not have a self service bar
c) pray tell how we're meant to measure out organic honey into drinks without making them inconsistent

people are fucking crazy about their honey, man. like, just bring your own. we aren't a fancy coffee bar by any means. we serve soccer moms and high schoolers. we run on cheap inventory and make sweet drinks to satisfy our general customer base. why in the world would we carry organic honey?",3,1731599996.0,barista,1,1.0,False

Cassandra, volatile with rage, tossed her husband’s cell phone to the floor of their bedroom, intending for the device to clatter and crash melodramatically when it connected with the wood tile. It landed screen-up and spun towards Tom’s feet, gliding smoothly against the ground like an air hockey puck. He hastily bent over to stop his phone’s forward motion, pocketing it without looking at the screen. Tom already knew what pictures would be opened on his messaging app. Instead, he went silent and did not argue, turning his head away from her and submissively placing his hands in the air.

He took a breath, seeing that it was only Cassandra, but that relief was short-lived when he looked back down to see an armada of nymphs moving on his position. He yelped and scrambled on top of a cabinet. His wife moved forward, seemingly to comfort him. When she held his hand, Cassandra noticed the open wound where that first tick had sprouted, and she rushed into the other room to procure bandages. For a moment, Tom felt safe. His wife began attending to his wound while he was still perched on the cabinet. But then he felt a pinch on his left wrist, followed by an intense lacerating sting, and then finally, the sensation of warm fluid gushing down his palm. When he looked down, his wife looked up at him in tandem. 

Cassandra’s mouth had mutated into a pulsating arena of hooked teeth, with plasma delicately dripping from the barbs she had just used to bite into him. In one swift motion, Tom pivoted his torso, unsheathed a blade from a nearby knife block, drove it deep into the creature’s abdomen, and sprinted out the house and into the street. 

—---------------------------

Cassandra nearly bled out on her kitchen floor, but a neighbor heard the commotion and had called the police. 

She awoke in the ICU surrounded by family. When she asked them what happened, they paused awkwardly and traded solemn expressions with each other instead of explaining. When Cassandra pressed for information, they flagged down her doctor from the hallway.

The physician did not mince words with Cassandra. Tom was dead - he had been picked up by the police fleeing the neighborhood but had been delivered to the same ICU she was currently in when he started to wheeze violently and turn blue.  

*“Do you have any pets, dogs especially?”* The doctor asked. *“Where in your house do you and your husband sleep? Have you ever seen any bats in your home?”*

Cassandra explained that they had bought their home recently, that Tom had been sleeping alone in their attic after a particularly nasty argument, and that she had seen a bat fly out a window once when they were moving in. She then detailed her husband’s odd behavior in the time leading up to her assault. 

The physician frowned and then elaborated on their suspicions:

*“The dilating pupils, the hallucinations, the fear of water, and the inspiratory spasms - they all suggest that your husband contracted rabies while living in your attic. Most of the time, people in the US contract the disease from a dog bite. However, bats are known to transmit the disease, too. What’s worse - if bats are in your home, they can bite you in your sleep without you waking up. If contracted, the disease is universally fatal, and there is no known treatment.* 

*Tom died from his airway spasms.* 

*You nearly died, too - from blood loss. Did you know you have an extremely rare blood type? AB negative. Only 1% of the population has this blood type, and unfortunately, the hospital has been critically low on replacement blood that is AB negative for almost a month now.* 

*We were initially very concerned - you needed more AB negative blood than we had, but as serendipity would have it, Tom was AB negative as well. Imagine that.* 

*Thankfully, rabies cannot be contracted through the blood - only through saliva. That’s why it is contracted through bites. Although it was unconventional, our administration gave us the green light to give you a large portion of his blood. In essence, Tom’s blood saved your life”*

The doctor paused, waiting patiently for whatever questions Cassandra had. 

But she had none. Instead, there was an eerie, uncomfortable silence for almost a minute.

Then, Cassandra tilted her head back, closed her eyes, wept, and had a very long laugh.

1gr7s9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/1gr7s9r/experience_review_initium_watchmaking_course/,[Experience Review] Initium Watchmaking Course,"I wanted to provide a review of my experience this past Saturday at the [Initium Watchmaking Course](https://initium.swiss/en/produit/one-day-watchmaking-workshop/). When I was considering doing this I couldn't find much feedback or experiences other than one other Reddit post. So I'm posting this in hopes that I can help anyone else who's considering this course, or looking for things to do in Geneva. 

**In short, I cannot recommend this class highly enough.** 

The highlight of a 3 day trip to Switzerland (and I'd have to say the highlight of my watch enthusiast life) was the Initium course I attended along with my fiancé. We opted for the full day class in which we had a private session with a watchmaker.  
  
We started with coffee and pastries and just chatted for a bit with our teacher, Quintin and our other host, Jane. Then we got into a presentation on the history of timekeeping and watches which was great for my wife, but I actually learned a good bit. Definitely helped clarify for me why Switzerland became the watch making hub it is today. Next they did a great job going in detail through how a mechanical watch operates and answering questions until we fully understood the basics.  
  
I will say, this is why I did this class. I have watched so many YouTube videos on how a watch works and I understand certain parts, but I'm a hands on learner. It has never fully clicked for me. So after the presentation, we got into the fun part. We started by taking the movement (an ETA 6498, which is used by Tissot, Hamilton, Sinn, and others) apart and then put it back together. THIS is where it all clicked for me. Actually taking out the balance bridge or the pallet fork and seeing what started or stopped in the rest of the movement made it all fall into place for my brain.  
  
After practicing on the movement we were treated to a very nice lunch with Quentin and we had a fun chat about life, culture, and politics in the USA and Switzerland.   
  
After lunch we got down to business - putting together the watch! We had an enormous range of aesthetic customization options. I am not typically a skeleton fan, but glad my wife encouraged this because now it is so nice to look back at all the movement parts we put together and think about how they work.  
  
It took probably 3 or 4 hours start to finish to have a finished watch. If any of you go to this part of the world and you are not 100% confident you know how a mechanical watch works, I HIGHLY encourage you to do an Initium workshop!! It was so much fun, and it has already given me greater appreciation for my other (and future watches). You can't really appreciate George Daniel's (Omega) Co-Axial escapement until you understand a basic escapement. And the process of quality control and cleaning the movement and case before blocking it all off gave me whole new appreciation for the detail that companies like Lange and Vacheron put into every part they use.

So I met my (22M) girlfriend (20F) in Japan while I was studying abroad. We have been long distance since August now. She is currently studying abroad in Australia and I will be going to see her next month. 

Since she has been there she is making a lot of friends. One of her friends is Japanese as well and is a big party girl. Because of this, my girlfriend is now adapting the party girl lifestyle. Going to parties, clubs, staying out all night. I’m fine if she does these things, but I need communication and reassurance that nothing bad will happen. Lately, she’s been dressing up in more revealing outfits and drinking a lot more. I made the mistake of stalking her instagram followers and noticed she followed some dude at the club tonight. 

I don’t want to believe she is cheating on me. She has been taking longer to respond to me lately and sending me shorter responses. My problem is I already discussed with her that while I do worry about her going out, that I want her to have fun and if she can just occasionally text me and let me know she gets home safe that would make me feel a lot better. I don’t know how I can bring up the cheating concerns without blaming her or making it seem like I don’t trust her, because while I still trust her, my trust is breaking just a little. I think the more it seems like I don’t trust her, the more it will make her do things that I’m not comfortable with. I already have bad anxiety, and I overthink every time I talk to her about these things because I don’t want to be controlling. I am her first boyfriend, maybe she doesn’t know what is okay to do in a relationship?

I feel like all I do is give and give, and I’m not getting much in return. I buy her lunch one day a week for a lunch date, get her coffee when she needs it, send her occasional loving letters when it seems like she is feeling down. I don’t expect her to buy me anything, all I ask for is some way that she can show her love for me.

Idk, I love her, I hope she loves me. Could this all be in my head? Yes. I just need advice how to manage this so she doesn’t feel like I’m being controlling or that I don’t trust her. I just want to get to the bottom of this because this distance is driving me crazy.

When it was The Sopranos it was all ""oof marone"" all the time, with Yellowstone he talked with a twang and talked about train stations, etc. He likes to ""take on"" the characters in these shows for a few weeks and it drives me crazy! I can't get my questions answered or have a normal conversation with him without him being ""in character"". Even when watching seasons of Hell's Kitchen he would talk like Gordon Ramsay and yell ""it's fucking raw!"" as a response to anything.

Last night we finished The Penguin and now he's walking around the house with a limp and keeps coming up to me saying ""tell me you love me, tell me you're proud of me ma"" with his best Oz voice. Me and my daughter are both getting this latest character and it hasn't even been an full 24 hours. 

The worst part is he will...break character, if you will, and ask me if he really sounds like Oz. I tell him no but the whole thing makes me crack up laughing so it just reinforces his ""acting"" even more. I couldn't even brush my teeth last night because I was laughing so hard. He's very convinced that he could totally, 100% be an actor if he really tried. Again, it just cracks me up and I remind me he never sounds anything like these characters. 

I am typically the one in our relationship to start new shows so I feel like his repetior of characters is now my fault. I asked for coffee this morning and he brought it to me while limping and again said ""tell me you're proud of me ma"" when he handed it to me and when he got today's clothes for our daughter he told her ""one day this city will be mine"". 

TL;DR: I introduced my hopeful actor husband to the show The Penguin and now he has taken on the character of Oswald Cobb. I can't have a normal conversation with him and he will probably be ""in character"" for the next few weeks.",25,1731599169.0,tifu,18,0.84,False

1gr7p1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1gr7p1n/hamlessamerica/,Hamlessamerica ,"I'm posting in remembrance of my fiance. He passed away from a seizure and fall in which he coded. He battled with alcohol addiction, likely due to prescription Adderall for ADHD. He was the biggest sweetheart, the most caring doctor. He was also stubborn and could present a fierce argument. He dabbled in medicine, politics, the stock market. He loved music and video games and Legos. His favorite show was The Office. He had his own style, not afraid of wearing bright colors and florals. When he was in health mode he always made sure to drink plenty of water, always reminding me to drink water too. He would have his morning coffee with his collagen scoop and a cup of yogurt. His skin care regimine was even better than mine, making sure to cleanse and moisturizer, especially before bed and he would remind me after our evening shower. He was a big foodie and we had dreams to travel the world, to experience different foods and cultures. We always shared a meal so that we could have an appetizer or have a dessert together. He loved ice cream, if he could pick a favorite food it would probably be that, cold stones birthday cake remix. 
He suffered a lot inside. He loved me and our dog Rico, we were family. We had dreams of settling down somewhere. He wanted to name our first girl Lily and if we had a boy, Kishan Jr. even though that wasn't a norm in his culture. But the lack of understanding and support from his parents and brother killed him inside. He had the thought that everyone would be better off without him, then he wouldn't hurt the ones he loved. I tried to tell him every day that that wasn't true. That he was loved, that he was strong and that he mattered. 
He was in the hospital for a week before he passed. I know that was still in there trying to fight, but his family was so tired of dealing with him. Over the days when he was in the hospital, he was tracking my movements and responding to my questions. His family kept his sedated as much as they could, so they wouldn't have to see that. He wanted to live, and if he had been given the chance he would defied the odds. He was strong and stubborn that way. It kills me that I had no say in his care as we weren't officially married yet. We kept our relationship from his family because they would only try to tear us apart. They blame me for his death and have made threats. It hurts that they still refuse to see what you were going through and how you suffered. It hurt to see that even when you were laying there they blamed you still, as if you wanted this for yourself. I know he would have pulled through if he had been given the time and support. His family killed him, they even said that they would get the good karma food donating his organs. They rushed the process that they only had recipients for his kidneys. They made so many excuses, gave so many lies. All in pretense of seeming like they cared. 
I want so bad to see him one last time but I'm scared to go to his viewing. I had to look it up online. Its so sad to read his obituary, his family didn't know him. Even his picture is so old. 
My mind is a mess and my heart feels so empty. I miss you my love, you will be in my heart forever. I wish so much I could have spent the rest of my life with you. I hope that you are finally in peace. ",4,1731599104.0,AlAnon,1,1.0,False

We talked for 2 ish hours both laughed quite a bit and there was the occasional one second silence before we found a new conversation but id say it went well. She was so lovely had an amazing personality and interests and was also absolutely gorgeous. 

Now im not sure how to go about setting up a second date tho. She decided where we’d meet for the first one so i think i should pick a place this time but i first have to see that a second date actually happens and im not sure how to and i dont know how to know she liked me on the first date? I paid and then we talked and she seemed to have a good time and then when we left she asked so if this the end of it or should we do something else, i said we could do something more but im not sure what that would be and then just said we could walk together to where she was gonna get picked up but then when the person who was meant to pick her up said they’d be really late i ended up driving her home and we kept talking all the way to her place where i said it was lovely meeting her and she really hurriedly said yeah you too, and maybe that means she didn’t like me really as she was that hurried out of the car and inside? We still send the occasional snap to eachother but i dont know how to ask about a next date and i dont know ab all these mindgames im apparently meant to be playing? Like wait x anount of days to text and then y amount of minutes to reply???? Like im just a dude im not gonna time my responds to her like wtf but im meant to? Idk this is just rambling atp

","I asked this yesterday on a man’s sub, and figured I should be asking women as well to get their perspective and get some understanding from the other side! So I appreciate any advice given. 

In your experience, how important is it for you and your partner to have common interests/share hobbies? 

I’ve seen all kinds of relationships in my life. And well obviously I’ve had a few of them myself. 

Sometimes you see two partners who are complete opposites in character. One of more energetic, outgoing, social, ambitions whereas another one can be calmer, geek-ish, reserved, and does indoor hobbies. 

I’m the latter. And well lately I’ve been thinking about what the ideal partner would look like. I’ve entered relationships before not thinking about this and ultimately it did not work out. But there were some positive experiences of course and lessons that came out of them. 

But I still have this looming question in my head as to whether or not common interests and hobbies are important. Like for me, when I think about being in a relationship, I’d like to find somebody who’s down to binge Kubrick or Scorsese or whatever films with me while we cuddle up, then play some Zelda or some shit afterwards. Go out to a library together or have some coffee when we go out. To summarize, I’d love to the cute geeky girl I can geek out with and have something to do with we both genuinely enjoy.

On the other hand. I’ve been with people I have nothing in common with and had complete opposite character, and the feeling would still turn out to be very intense. The most passionate relationship I had was with somebody who was very fiesta, aggressive, outgoing, extrovert, etc. 

But sometimes we did hit obstacles as to what we wanted to do when together. I wanted to lay back and watch a movie with her, she wanted to go to a bar. This relationship however ended shortly as we both had our toxic traits and well let’s just say I had to call it quits before we both ruined each other lives. So I never really did find out if we were going to make it work despite those obstacles. I suppose one could if they had an open mind and both decide to be open to doing each other hobbies/interests.

But I just wonder if it’s even worth it. Wouldn’t it just be easier to find someone you got chemistry with AND have similar interests? Or is it worth it being with somebody you really vibe with, even if you gotta do shit you don’t want to do?

What has your experience been like? Can polar opposite relationship work in the long run or will they eventually fall apart ?",1,1731598857.0,AskWomenOver30,2,1.0,False

1gr7gs6,https://www.reddit.com/r/recoverywithoutAA/comments/1gr7gs6/leaving_aa/,Leaving AA,"TLDR: I’m not buying it anymore and I sure can’t sell it. I am taking my power back. It feels like leaving a cult and it’s a very emotional process. The writing of my story was cathartic, apologies for the length.

I’ve been a member of AA since March 2021. 

I have the key to the church. I buy the coffee and the snacks (with *my own* money - we’ll get there later) I was the secretary of my homegroup for a while. I went to a three day conference once, I sponsored people, I’ve encouraged folks to join… heck the fucking regulars at my homegroup came to my wedding! 

When I first stepped into the rooms I was a shell of a person. Most people are when they come in. It wasn’t until I found this sub that I realized how predatory it is - they push you to open up and lay yourself bare at your most vulnerable state and then *smother* you with “love” and tell you if you just keep coming to meetings you won’t feel so horrible ever again. 

I was a 5th-a-day drinker. I did cocaine and other hard drugs. I lost countless jobs, I was very in debt, my health was declining, I was about to lose my relationship…My life was in ruins. AA told me I crossed a line I can never uncross. That alcoholism is part of my identity now. And I bought it. Because I *was* hopeless. 

I never bought into the god part though. The “higher power” I just couldn’t do it. I felt like I was a “bad AA person” that’s what I would call myself. No matter how they tried to spin it to me I really couldn’t buy into it. 

Now, they don’t know or understand this of course, but this draws on a deeply imbedded trauma experience with the Catholic Church (not what your thinking - just your run of the mill mental/emotional abuse and shaming practices) and the whole idea of god and Christianity really grosses me out. But my whole life I’ve been made to feel like that is what I’m *supposed* to believe. 

So when I came into AA, emotionally and financially depleted, sickly, immature and fully hopeless, they told me I had a god-sized hole and that was why I drank. I drank in excess because my body was made differently and now that I’ve come here I can’t ever go back. They told me if I don’t put on my “spiritual armor” I’ll have no defense against the first drink. That I can’t be trusted to make my own choices, that their god had a will for me. 

And when I started to question their gods they told me I wasn’t doing it right. I wasn’t reading between the lines quite right. I wasn’t convincing myself that “higher power could mean anything” correctly. It was my fault that I couldn’t buy what they were selling me, it was *my* “character defects” standing in the way of my *spiritual experience* and they all looked at me with such exhaustion and disapproval the more I started to wake up. 

It’s been nearly 4 years since I took a drink. I started falling out of love with AA a while ago but I couldn’t put my finger on why it was making me feel so icky. And if I am forming a resentment, of course, I must not be working the program correctly, it’s *my fault*

So I tried doing another 90 in 90 at the beginning of this year because they told me I needed to do more inventory, I needed to do more step work, I needed to *call my sponsor* (which I was always weirded out by too.)

They exalted me for this. What a wonderful model I am for this program working. They asked me to speak. Three times they asked me to speak. Im supposed to tell these folks how the program worked for me. Each time it got more disingenuous. I barely believed what I was saying. I never mentioned a higher power and I got called out on that…

It felt so yucky telling everyone what they want you to say “it wasn’t me up there it was god working through me”…

Hit a sobriety milestone - “how did you do it?” - oh it was all thanks to this program and my HP - that’s what you’re supposed to say. And they shame you if you don’t. They pretend like they don’t but they do - those groups shame people into sharing their belief system (and putting your money in their basket)

Nevertheless, the 90 days ended and the spark dwindled again and I started to do other things to take care of myself. 

I started seeing a therapist for the first time in my sober adult life to address childhood trauma, ADHD and anxiety disorder. I use medically prescribed cannabis to manage panic attacks (which I’ve been keeping a secret from the group for years for fear of shaming and judgement). I started studying Taoist philosophy, I’m reading Marcus Aurelius and Alan Watts, I’ve swapped meetings for time with my husband, I do a daily yoga practice etc etc. 

{Sidebar - I read in a Buddhist sub once that for one user “AA was spiritual preschool” and I think of that often, because while my spiritual life *is* strengthening, it has nothing to do with the gods of AA}

I continued questioning the existence of a “higher power” and started really studying and listening to some well known atheists (Christopher Hitchens and Matt Dillahunty for example) and finally started to form my OWN belief system - and feel confident in who I am and what my values are. 

My growth was *absolutely* stunted because of my sustained substance abuse. I went into AA with the emotional intelligence of a 19 year old when I was 34. It took time to figure out who *I am*. And the more I grow into my authentic self, the less I identify with AA. 

It’s not to say I’m not grateful for the *people*, the actual human beings, who helped me and listened to me and encouraged me to stay sober. 

But for years this program did so much harm I was unaware of until just a few days ago when I found this sub and started *digging* (because the critiques are hidden) for resources exposing the cult-like properties of AA. 

BIG ONE - I’ve spent upwards of $2000 of *MY OWN MONEY* for this program. Buying coffee and snacks and cups and napkins etc etc - when our group was too small to pay me back I just paid for it. Not to mention all the money I threw in the baskets! Buying the books. Buying tickets to the conference. Gas money driving license-less sponsees to meetings because that’s what we’re *supposed* to do. And so on! 

AND! Can we talk about the fucking misogyny and the bigotry we’re supposed to just overlook?! Bill wrote an entire chapter of the book *pretending to be his wife* and the women in the rooms are just fine with that? It took the organization this long to change the words “men and women” in the preamble to the word “people” and folks went fucking nuts about it! I heard an old man give a lead once and multiple times he talked about how *it was better before women were in the program* and the women I was sitting with were cheering for the guy - what the actual fuck is happening here?!

That, of course, is just the tip of the iceberg. But how did I manage to convince myself that those things weren’t important? How did I defend the book for so long? We were just supposed to say “oh it was written in a different time” but no one thought maybe that was cause for a critical look at the language? No. “You don’t touch the first 164” - pretend the program isn’t sexist or racist or homophobic because that’s the only way you’ll stay sober. And if you have a problem with it, it’s a problem in yourself.”

That was the knife twist. Every time I questioned anything I felt shame. Constant. Fucking. Shame. I wanted to be a part of this group! And it hurt so badly because they conditioned me to believe they are the only people I know who understand me, the only people who can keep me sober, the only people who I can turn to when I’m in crisis….

Until I found others. 

Which is why they caution you against therapy. Because you don’t really need AA - you need to address the underlying causes of your substance abuse. Prayer is not psychological treatment for fucks sake!!

And ultimately, if AA’s definition of an alcoholic is one who cannot stop drinking, wouldn’t it mean then that, well… I mean…I’ve stopped. I’ve stopped for a sustained period of time. So by AA’s own definition, I’m no longer alcoholic. I am *not* powerless and my life is entirely manageable. 

And it was no god that did that for me. 

I did that. I am taking my power back. Now. 

I finally started seeing a PCP regularly and my medical records show “Alcohol Use Disorder - In Sustained Remission.”

But now I have to go give them the key back. I left my homegroup meeting this past Monday morning feeling *guilty* - another constant - like I shouldn’t have shared that “I don’t sponsor people anymore because I believe that circumstances aligned to allow you to get sober and that’s really it”

We were reading a story in the book about a woman who had cirrhosis and got a liver transplant and recovered because of the program yada yada - and then folks went around the room and shared about how they were able to be healed. B. had Hepatitis C but now he’s cured. R. got a liver transplant too and now she’s cured. 

Not my dad though. He drank himself to death. He had irreversible cirrhosis and the hepatitis alphabet. Was it his character defects that kept him from recovery? Did your god not grant him the grace he did for you? Was he not writing a nightly inventory, is that why he couldn’t get sober? No. He couldn’t reconcile the trauma in his past, he didn’t have access to treatment, the circumstances didn’t align for him. And I shared that to a silent room. And left feeling empty…

Until *I* figured it out. *Me* 

With the help of my sweet, kind, understanding, patient, beautiful husband. 
Who truly deserves all the credit in the world. How did I do it? I met my husband. I got lucky. And then I did everything in MY POWER to be a better human being. To grow. To learn. To change. To develop. To express myself. For once I felt safe. I felt secure. Because my husband encouraged me to be my authentic self. To get healthy. To stay around a while so we can have fun together! 

I realized I care so much what the people in this group think about me but what do I think about me?? It’s not my job to make them feel comfortable or to conform to their beliefs. Then I found this sub. Then I found other resources. And then I decided *I can be free.*

I’m scared about this Monday. I wish I could just stop going but I have to turn in the key and let the old men know they’re going to have to buy their own snacks. I have to tell the people who text me everyday to take me off their list. It’s hard to do, you know you’re going to be met with “bUt If YoU LeAvE YoU’LL DrInK!” And I hate the idea of having to defend my decision. But I think I’ll just say nothing. 

I can’t wait to be unburdened of this. And who knows maybe I’ll hit a women’s meeting somewhere down the line but right now it feels like I’m ridding myself of a big heavy cloak. And writing my story was very cathartic. Thank you for reading if you made it this far. And thank you to the mods of this sub - this was the catalyst to my full awakening.

The overdraft fee will post a 30$ to my bank account but I have a grace period to deposit 11.75$ by 11am PST basically and if I do I won’t get charge 30$

And my perspective change is simply behave as if money is important instead of not. And to value the money i earned. Because i do work hard and do overtime a lot but I always give money away to people who ask me and i at times spend emotionally when sad 

So like preventing this 30$ charge to my bank account is going to align with my new values on my perspective of money. I’m kind of also just doing this as a challenge to myself and get myself busy doing something productive 

And again my point is 30$ is basically 3 hours of labor in a sense to me. So like I’m losing throwing away or not caring about 3 hours of my life in sense if I just not care about a overdraft fee 

Anyways I am trying to sell things on offer up at the moment I’m sure I can sell on offer up but issue is I can’t do so in time to cover overdraft fee.

I thought about donating plasma which I might consider it a done deal and do it at a later date actually 

But profit and loss in a sense 30$ - 100$ = 70$ 

I should minius the 11.75$ too

But my point is I want to obsess over money I also have taxes I never did correctly apparently and IRS want to tax levy me…. It’s my main reason to get serious and care about money instead of be careless or nonchalant about it. 

Also I use to own a lot of doge coin and idk why I sold I was one of the first people to buy dodge along with my roommates at the time and its bugging me that I check my robinhood account that I sold and I sold why? Idk.

But my point is I want to grow the value of my bank account not just work a job and earn money and spend money on food and thing and bills 

But grow the value of my bank account 
So I want to lower my expenses and budget my spending and then aim to invest in one stock or crypto that I sense will grow in value simply over time 

And may work 2 jobs again and I want to start paying my debts 

Because interests on my debts are legit going to make me feel trapped in life if I don’t get a handle on it now 

And what’s odd and funny to me everyone around me keeps telling me if they aren’t asking or looking for you or whatever ignore it and I don’t get that perspective 

To do as they do, I don’t want too. 

I want to pay my debts to build a credit score and I want IRS off my butt 

I think I am wasting time trying to make 15$ quickly somehow and should just focus on a venture that has a better opportunity cost of result into a new income source 

But objectively I am just wanting to negate the overdraft fee cuz I don’t want my 3 hours of labor to be discredited by choosing to buy take out when I could of just bought 30 cent ramen

Anyways I’m not trying to beg here at all I am seeing if people share the same sentiment and have actionable advice for me. 

And I’m also making this post to keep motivated and focus I just woke up from a nap and this is first thing in doing going to be making my coffee now and then figure out next move 

I think I have to sell my Ve headset to get money fast but don’t want to but it’s something that could sell easily 

And like again is it really worth it to focus so much on covering an overdraft fee? But objectively I want to negate it but it doesn’t have to be now but would be ideal if now to negate the like that expense from my typical income source that is my job

1gr7f1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/wisconsin/comments/1gr7f1u/i_have_a_question_for_the_fine_ladies_and/,I have a question for the fine ladies and gentlemen that lives in Wisconsin's small cities,"How do foreigners tend to be treated in your land? Are small town folks cool with outsiders and such? I'm not moving in rn or anything, but I can say it sure is a desire of mine. I were quite a fan of t70s during my adolescence, which woke me a passion about your state.

I'm brazilian(southern), and things aren't nice here; politically and economically. Not to mention the climate, we barely get to see snow twice a year. It's 8 months of burning sun and 4 mild cold months. Not for me /:

Anyways, my plan is to get my degree and get a move on with my italian citizenship, farm some experience in my field and move to the US.

I'm a small town guy, and I don't look up for finer things and/or huge apartment in a big city. I really just want to brew some coffee myself as I watch the sun rises as the snow falls in december, preferably in the countrylands. How I love those peaceful mornings.

Don't get me wrong for what you're about to read, for I know most folks don't care about such things, but, I'm a white ginger male and catholic, so does that reduces any chance of the kinds of prejudice I would suffer in there? (I'm sorry if I'm being ignorant, but that's kind of the image that media passes on about the US)

Anyway, that's too much about myself. Most won't even care anyways, but that's me. I eager to be a traveler, and get to know the good parts of our world is what I want. And Wisconsin is sure a place where I would settle for a while

I am a local author and my third young adult novel, WHAT THE WOODS TOOK, is coming out on 12/10! My first two books came out when COVID restrictions were more intense and I wasn't able to do much in-person, so I am very excited to have a release party in my hometown! We'll be at The Book Bin from 10AM-12PM on the 10th with coffee and bagels from The Gov Cup, book-themed sugar cookies, and more! Info on the book below:

>""***Yellowjackets*** **meets** ***Girl, Interrupted*** **when a group of troubled teens in a wilderness therapy program find themselves stranded in a forest full of monsters eager to take their place.**

>Devin Green wakes in the middle of the night to find two men in her bedroom. No stranger to a fight, she calls to her foster parents for help, but it soon becomes clear this is a planned abduction—one everyone but Devin signed up for. She’s shoved in a van and driven deep into the Idaho woods, where she’s dropped off with a cohort of equally confused teens. Finally, two camp counselors inform them that they've all been enrolled in an experimental therapy program. If the campers can learn to change their self-destructive ways—and survive a fifty-days hike through the wilderness—they’ll come out the other side as better versions of themselves. Or so the counselors say.

>Devin is immediately determined to escape. She’s also determined to ignore Sheridan, the cruel-mouthed, lavender-haired bully who mocks every group exercise. But there’s something strange about these woods—inhuman faces appearing between the trees, visions of people who shouldn't be there flashing in the leaves—and when the campers wake up to find both counselors missing, therapy becomes the least of their problems. Stranded and left to fend for themselves, the teens quickly realize they’ll have to trust each other if they want to survive. But what lies in the woods may not be as dangerous as what the campers are hiding from each other—and if the monsters have their way, no one will leave the woods alive.

>Atmospheric and sharp, *What the Woods Took* is a poignant story of transformation that explores the price of becoming someone—or something—new.""

Today I went to an area called Shimo-Kitazawa which is famous for having many vintage clothes (古着) shops. Many young people dressed in style outfits they thoughtfully chose. I like how they confidently expressed themselves and were not afraid to be eccentric. 

Some shops only sell selected quality items, but there are also shops selling clothes as cheep as 105 yen (about 0.67 USD including jackets and  sweaters!).

There are hundreds of vintage clothes stores and cool coffee shops. Considering you need to carefully find the one you like from rack after rack of unique clothes, you could spend a whole day here. I found a nice Italy-made sweater for a reasonable price, a classic fleece shirt, among other things. 大満足！

Mars Café has closed its downtown skywalk location after two years, citing a lack of customers.

""It just wasn't super busy,"" said co-owner Kuuku Saah. ""It never took off.""

Saah said the Mars lease was nearly up — another motivator for deciding to call it quits. He'll continue to focus on the main location in the Drake University Dogtown neighborhood and the Mars [coffee cart next to the Des Moines Biergarten at Water Works Park](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/entertainment/dining/2023/06/29/mars-cafe-opens-a-coffee-cart-at-water-works-park-in-des-moines/70369403007/).

But office workers looking to get their caffeine fix won't have to wait for long. [Happy Home Coffee Roasters](https://www.happyhomecoffee.com/shop), founded by local pastor Carlos Sims Jr. in 2019, has already stuck its logo on Mars Café's darkened window.

Dry leaf: mild scent, hard to place, no pile aroma to my nose.

Wet leaf: wow, that does smell like chocolate.

Initial steeps: thick, viscous, oily mouthfeel. Tastes like standard-quality baking chocolate, not dark chocolate, as there’s no sweetness or fruitiness here. Pleasant bitterness. Definitely does not taste like w2t’s other shu offerings or the early 2000’s mini-bricks I rediscovered a few months back. 

Mid steeps: bitterness drops off a bit, taste is more up my alley. Some dark red fruit starts to show up in the background now that I don’t just taste coffee-like or chocolate-like bitterness. That’s still the foreground, though.

Late steeps: will revisit later. Ran out of time, so gaiwan is going in the fridge.

Steeping time throughout was about 6s (time it takes to fill the gaiwan and get the lid back on), though bumped up to “when the vibes are right” once it was time to push

Body feel: calm, but I have to be mindful to find it rather than be aggressively bear-hugged by the shu.

Overall: good experience, site description was largely accurate, other than that “dark chocolate” should be “baking chocolate.” Wouldn’t cake it, though. Had a nicer experience with Shulloween Black Cat.",6,1731598034.0,puer,1,1.0,False
1gr79we,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1gr79we/my_ex_broke_up_with_me_due_to_depression_months/,"My ex broke up with me due to depression months ago, but now cries about me every time he hears my name. ","During my freshman year of college I was in a long distance relationship with a college sophomore, we came from the same hometown and worked the same high school job. After meeting it took us about 8 months to go on a first date and on our third we made the relationship official. There was immediate chemistry between the two of us, and we were very flirtatious throughout our time knowing each other (but we did go months without seeing each because we were at school). After we started dating, typically most college students are home for the summer, but our universities require a co-op for professional experience to graduate. He had a six month co-op lined up from May-December. So, we would take turns visiting each other from February to May during the school year and then again once he was on co-op. His mood and attitude definitely began change once he was on co-op and moved away, but we would take turns visiting each other (him coming home and me driving there). The duration of our relationship was fairly short, only six months, but it was definitely the most serious relationship either of us had been in. We would often talk about the future, financially and realistically, often about the distance and how long it would take until we could break the distance. Tentative plans like finding internships nearby the other and moving in together for the summers were often talked about. He would send long texts expressing his love for me. He would call me his wife, not just to me but to his friends as well. He would talk about the plan for the future and getting married, paying off student debt, where to live, having children, etc. In late July he was home for a few days to celebrate his birthday and everything seemed great. He met my hometown friends for the first time, we went out to dinner with his parents for his birthday, I gave him his gift early, and everything was great, not a doubt in my mind. 

Since his birthday was during the week and we celebrated the weekend before, he texted me of his birthday telling me he wished he got to see me more during the weekend he was home. And that he loved me, missed me, and wanted to talk to me. He came to my house at like 9 pm on his birthday and when I got in the car, he broke up with me. 

It wasn't quite that straightforward. He himself never ever actually broke up with me, I kind of did it for him, and as I was about to leave, he asked if I would stay to talk to him. We went into this three hour conversation about how hard moving away from home was and how he was struggling mentally. He told me he convinced himself that I hated him and every time I told him I didn't he would just repeat, ""I've convinced myself that you hate me"". (Prefacing: we weren't together for an extended period of time, but we never had a fight and this was very out of the blue, no one saw it coming and everyone was shocked). He ended up deciding he didn't want to break up and then 20 minutes later broke up with me again. It was such a whirlpool of emotions, but he was telling me that it was ""right person, wrong time"" and I was his person and soulmate and he wants to get back together in the future. I told him that if he was struggling this much he should go to therapy and move back home from his co op. I finally was able to pull myself away from the car around midnight and just cried. It was the most painful thing I had ever experienced. I continued to work and do my thing and three weeks later, he called me on my way home from work. We ended up talking on the phone for four hours. And with distance in our relationship, it felt like nothing changed. He told me that he was facing severe depression and he was starting therapy and proceeded to tell me that I was his other half and soulmate and he missed me. He told me the break up had nothing to do with me and I was perfect and he wanted nothing more than to be with me. He had lost 15 pounds in three weeks and stopped eating, his boss was telling him he was a liability, he deleted all social media, he was coming home every weekend (all of this was extremely hard for me to hear, it's super hard to hear the person you care most about is struggling so much and you can't help them). The day after he called me he texted me and told me he was going to be home that weekend and asked me to go over. And I did. I was there for three hours, he cried to me, I held him, comforted him. He told me he loved, he didn't considered me his ex, he wanted to marry me, yada yada yada. He was officially diagnosed with depression and was starting low dosage medication. At the end of both of these conversations he would tell me that he wants to talk to me again, but wasn't sure if he ever would, which was very frustrating to me and irritating. He said that if I called him in a couple weeks he would answer and be happy to talk to me. 

  
I never called. I moved back to college. I am a very prideful person and really don't want to get hurt even more, so I just never reached out to him. It's been over three months now and I am still super torn over the situation. I still love him tremendously and care for him deeply. I do want to be with him and this has taken a major toll on me. I have tried dating again, but haven't found someone (not that I was expecting to, but every time I hang out with someone new I am still just thinking about my ex). I don't move on easily and I did picture my entire future with this person, so I am still mourning this loss. My best friend from back home goes to school locally and still works the hometown job that my ex and I met and worked at. She had been telling me that she would often see my ex and his mom walking around town and he would look super sad and choked up. And then one day she told me he reapplied to our high school job for the remainder of the semester until he goes back to school in January. He ended up quitting his co-op and moving back home. Now I know that he is going to be home and there is a good chance I will see him when I go home for winter break while working, things have gotten significantly harder and I keep asking all of the what ifs, and running through endless scenarios. 

Other things that are not helpful is that I often hear about him. I guess he and my best friend had a conversation, when he first came back about how he was doing and a friendly catch up. The next day he went back into the store we worked at to thank her for not hating him, and she said ""I don't hate you, no one hates you, not even \_\_\_(my name)"" she said it looked like he was about to burst into tears and choked up, once she mentioned me. Later another one of our coworkers, unknowingly asked his how his girlfriend was (referring to me) and he burst into tears at work, while working, over simply the thought of me. 

I'm not over him and it seems like he may not be over me either, and I don't know if I should ask him to do something if I see him at work over winter break. I understand that depression isn't clean cut and dry, but I do want to be with him and help him through it. I just love him so much and have never felt so strongly for someone. 

If I run into him at the store I am tempted to ask him to get coffee or something, but I don't know if that's a good idea. 

I don't know, I know this was not a very cohesive story, but I am super conflicted and any insights would be helpful. ",1,1731598026.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Yet, it’s not entirely because I’m a homebody. I feel like when I go out, we don’t mix or socialize easily with others (MBTI/people). It’s very awkward and like if I say something, they acknowledge and then look away or something.

But I know a few INFJ’s here do love going outside (beach, parks, a quiet cafe, and museums). If you go to clubs/bars please invite me or tell me your experience.

Now the meat and potatoes. To the adventurous INFJ’s, where do you like to travel and what’s your itinerary consist of? Do you solo travel, have a companion, or meet people? Ever ran into another INFJ?

 I admit, messaging and commenting on INFJ posts are a drop of dopamine to me. Y’all are great, and we share a similar experience and mindset imo. When I travel for a weekend or for weeks, I want to actually sit down and share a cup of coffee, tea, brews, whatever with another INFJ and have a conversation about our lives or the world.

We are a small NPO in a rural town. Our building is on main Street. We serve low-income and homeless people. We are a community center, open Friday through Tuesday each week. We offer breakfast and lunch at no charge. There is always coffee on and we have games and a TV room. Our guests can come in to get cool or warm, depending on the season, and just relax. We don't charge for anything. They can stay as long they like and come and go as they choose. 

Our problem - We are seeing more bikes, which are being parked outside in front of our door, blocking the sidewalk. There isn't room for a bike rack in front of us. There are very limited options for one at all downtown, due to restrictions by DOT and parking lot owners and space. 

We also have a problem that many of our guests fear their bike being stolen, so they want to see it while they are inside. Our window lets them do that. Parking their bike on a bike stand away from us may not be an option in their mind. 

Right now, the board doesn't know how to solve this problem. We don't want to be a menace to the community, but we can't allow bikes inside our building, either.

I've known my girlfriend since 5 years, we went to school together. At that time, we also got to know each other outside of school at parties or at driving school, since we only lived five minutes apart. We started a ""talking stage,"" where we went for coffee a few times and just spent time together. This stage lasted about a year, during which nothing really happened between us because we were both relatively shy. During this time, I occasionally shared some information about her with my parents, but after this phase dragged on for over a year, I eventually stopped. After that year, she confessed to me that she had ""cheated"" on me, which broke my heart, as she had gone a step further with someone else than she had with me. Afterward, we only had sporadic contact.

About six months later, we started meeting up again, which ultimately turned into a two-year relationship. During these years, I stopped talking to my parents about her. Initially, it was because I was unsure where things were going after she had broken my heart like that, and I wasn't ready to commit to her, since it would be my first relationship. I also entered the relationship with the mindset that it wouldn't last, and we both agreed that we just wanted to gain some experience. Now, this relationship has been going on in secret for two years. My parents haven’t known about her since the talking stage four years ago; after that, it was never mentioned again.

As more time passed, it became harder and harder for me to keep up this lie and to bring the whole thing to light, which has brought me to my current situation. I'm in a two-year relationship that my parents know nothing about. My girlfriend has never met my parents, and whenever she asked, I somehow brushed it off. But I told her that my parents knew about her, which isn’t true. Every day, I struggle with how to resolve the whole situation. If I tell my girlfriend the truth, I’ll break her heart and lose all my social contacts, since she has integrated herself into my friend group by now. Should I talk to my parents and try to get them on my side? I can’t keep this a secret any longer. ",1,1731597299.0,AITA_Relationships,0,1.0,False

But clearly, nobody wants to crash a machine, scrap a part, or call the customer and tell them how they can't meet the schedule because they are waiting for a new raw part.

However, even the big names of NC Code Simulation, like Vericut, are not guaranteed to catch every issue and do not make running a program risk-free. And they certainly don't come for free... 

Toolpath/APT-based simulation in CAM has many critics, but is it really that bad in 2024? ""Uh, back in 2008 MASTERCAN'T didn't catch that one error - that's why it's sh\*t, SH\*T!!"" is something I read a lot... But it feels like these opinions might be outdated.

It's difficult for me to judge. Visiting IMTS certainly didn't help - people want to sell, and I don't blame them. Obviously, CAM simulation is the greatest for those who only have CAM simulation on their price list. And if you talk to the Vericut folks, you start questioning your sanity because you're not yet using Vericut. The leaflets and calculations about cost savings always look great, and the free coffee usually tastes good...

After finding out today that my baby has no heartbeat I went to a McDonald’s to have some time to think. I wrote a short story to ground myself and thought I’d share it here incase anyone recognises any of the feelings themselves. 




The Hum

The rain outside is relentless, tapping steadily against the windows, blurring the view of passing cars. Inside the McDonald’s, it’s warm. The hum of chatter, the scrape of chairs on tile, and the smell of hot fries fill the air. I sit alone in the corner, my tray untouched—coffee cooling, fries going stale. It doesn’t matter. Nothing seems to matter right now, not since I left the hospital a few hours ago. 

They told me I lost the baby. They said it with words that felt detached, as though they were instructions to follow, like a list of chores. My mind is numb, but my eyes—my eyes wander.

A few tables over, a young woman with a wide, triumphant grin is surrounded by friends. They’ve pushed tables together, laughter bubbling around half-eaten burgers and cartons of cold fries. In the middle of it all, the girl lifts a flimsy graduation cap, giggling as someone leans across to place it back on her head, snapping a photo. Her life is just beginning—so much ahead, the whole world opening up to her.

A little to the side, an elderly couple sits quietly with their coffee. They don’t say much, but there’s a softness in the way they look at each other. His hand rests gently on hers, fingers brushing like it’s a habit that’s lasted decades. They share a muffin, cutting it carefully with a plastic knife, half for her, half for him. In the silence between them, there’s a kind of peace—an understanding that doesn’t need words.

By the window, three men in reflective vests and mud-streaked boots are hunched over their meals. They eat quickly, hungrily, talking with their mouths full, hands gesturing wildly. One pulls out a phone, showing a picture of a child—laughter erupts, hearty and full of life. A story I’ll never be able to tell, but it’s theirs, and for them, the world is moving on like it always does.

In the far corner, two women in their sixties sip milkshakes, leaning in close to hear each other over the noise. There’s something familiar in the way they laugh, the kind of ease that comes only from years of shared history. Their voices rise, soft and joyful, and one reaches across the table to brush a crumb from the other’s cheek. Friends who’ve known each other through the decades, sharing another moment in a long line of moments.

Near the counter, a man sits alone, newspaper spread across the table in front of him. He’s stoic, his face expressionless, as if he’s blocking out the world with the barrier of newsprint. There’s a stillness to him, an unspoken loneliness that echoes mine, but I can’t reach him through his wall of words.

The rain keeps falling. I should leave, but I can’t move, can’t peel my eyes away from these strangers and their small, ordinary, beautiful lives. Each table is a world of its own, full of stories I’ll never know, paths I’ll never walk. I feel the weight of my own loss pressing down, yet somehow, the noise around me feels comforting, like a blanket I didn’t know I needed. I am here, invisible, yet surrounded by life, by laughter, by quiet moments, by people just... being.

I am incredibly bereft of any kinds of human contact and I'd like to try my hand at it since I've been incredibly lonely. To preface I'm not someone who will bug you, but if every so often anyone is feeling the same crippling loneliness and inability to connect with genuinely anyone, d be happy to have coffee and share existence with you.

Many say this restaurant,or that restaurant. Yes understood out of respect for many pundits ,even those starters who think they have visited the very best restaurants.

There's Tokyo ,Osaka ,Nagoya ,Kyushu ,
New York ,Los Angeles, San Francisco 
And of course many others in Bangkok .

But a couple of hours away from Bangkok in a resort in a quiet atmosphere nestled  a future iconic residence and restaurant. Sunplay paradiso restaurant in Sunplay Resort and Club.In Chonburi district in Bangsaray  some would say 5 star and above if there is an extension to the 5 star ...

As soon as I walked in I felt I just entered a different world . The decor ,the layout, the ambience. Forget Las Vegas for a moment. and just sit and feel the vibes 

When the menus were presented I would have thought a much steaper price for the items ,but the prices were comparable to Bangkok prices . But wait about the food course, which was recommended by Roberto Ferin the owner , maitre d everything of the establishment, fresh steamed crab . Now my mouth is watering the crab carved out very well and sat on a bed of a light vinaigrette salad as starter and a lemon wedge their""a signature dish network"". At the start I had to hold because the anticipation is the best because each bite was a symphony of love.

Now talking about aldente pasta perfectly cooked and firm and the marinara sauce very distinctive .The amount of pasta just perfect not overwhelming and the zesty taste of satisfaction.

The dessert ..a nice chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream a great match with illy coffee .

For those wine afficianados Roberto has the finest labels like Tagnanello ,Ornelliaia ,Casa nova di neri and more..

1gr6f6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1gr6f6s/nf_the_hum/,[NF] The Hum,"The Hum

The rain outside is relentless, tapping steadily against the windows, blurring the view of passing cars. Inside the McDonald’s, it’s warm. The hum of chatter, the scrape of chairs on tile, and the smell of hot fries fill the air. I sit alone in the corner, my tray untouched—coffee cooling, fries going stale. It doesn’t matter. Nothing seems to matter right now, not since I left the hospital a few hours ago. 

They told me I lost the baby. They said it with words that felt detached, as though they were instructions to follow, like a list of chores. My mind is numb, but my eyes—my eyes wander.

A few tables over, a young woman with a wide, triumphant grin is surrounded by friends. They’ve pushed tables together, laughter bubbling around half-eaten burgers and cartons of cold fries. In the middle of it all, the girl lifts a flimsy graduation cap, giggling as someone leans across to place it back on her head, snapping a photo. Her life is just beginning—so much ahead, the whole world opening up to her.

A little to the side, an elderly couple sits quietly with their coffee. They don’t say much, but there’s a softness in the way they look at each other. His hand rests gently on hers, fingers brushing like it’s a habit that’s lasted decades. They share a muffin, cutting it carefully with a plastic knife, half for her, half for him. In the silence between them, there’s a kind of peace—an understanding that doesn’t need words.

By the window, three men in reflective vests and mud-streaked boots are hunched over their meals. They eat quickly, hungrily, talking with their mouths full, hands gesturing wildly. One pulls out a phone, showing a picture of a child—laughter erupts, hearty and full of life. A story I’ll never be able to tell, but it’s theirs, and for them, the world is moving on like it always does.

In the far corner, two women in their sixties sip milkshakes, leaning in close to hear each other over the noise. There’s something familiar in the way they laugh, the kind of ease that comes only from years of shared history. Their voices rise, soft and joyful, and one reaches across the table to brush a crumb from the other’s cheek. Friends who’ve known each other through the decades, sharing another moment in a long line of moments.

Near the counter, a man sits alone, newspaper spread across the table in front of him. He’s stoic, his face expressionless, as if he’s blocking out the world with the barrier of newsprint. There’s a stillness to him, an unspoken loneliness that echoes mine, but I can’t reach him through his wall of words.

The rain keeps falling. I should leave, but I can’t move, can’t peel my eyes away from these strangers and their small, ordinary, beautiful lives. Each table is a world of its own, full of stories I’ll never know, paths I’ll never walk. I feel the weight of my own loss pressing down, yet somehow, the noise around me feels comforting, like a blanket I didn’t know I needed. I am here, invisible, yet surrounded by life, by laughter, by quiet moments, by people just... being.

I take a sip of my cold coffee, and the bitterness is sharp, grounding. I’m still here. The rain is still falling, and people are still living, laughing, talking. Life doesn’t stop. It never does. I find a strange, fragile beauty in that—the way the world keeps turning even when mine feels like it's come undone. For a moment, I close my eyes and breathe, listening to the melody of other people's stories intertwining, finding a tiny thread of comfort in the ordinary, persistent hum of life.",2,1731595745.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Tired of the dating apps and I've had connections on here before so I figured I'd give it another shot!

I work in a very demanding customer service job, it's not my favorite job but at least it's work. On my downtime on weekdays you can find me binging a double feature of two movies l've never seen before.

I'm a big horror nerd, and I get excited to watch things I've never heard or seen. Currently doing a deep dive into 1970's Italian Horror.

I watch a lot of other stuff too. I basically live on the Tubi app after work. Comedy, action, even some romantic comedies. B movie are also a favorite of mine. I'm literally filled with weird, obscure film recommendations.

420 friendly! I def hit my vape every night after work, it calms me down after a very stressful day. Weekends if I have nothing to do l'll smoke a bit more, but I can def go days without it. Not a deal breaker if that's not your thing!

Outside of watching stuff on weekends I try to stay as active as I can. Summer and fall I love going to the parks out here with my dog, Buddy! He's a 11 year old rescue dog who I got about 4 years ago. He's got my heart and I know you'll love him.

My airbag did not deploy. No injuries, but the car I hit is likely totaled. And that car lurched forward hitting car in front of them, who in turn hit the car in front of them. Damage to those cars less severe, almost minor. Again, no injuries. Goochland County policemen arrived, wrote up report, charged me with reckless driving. Coming to find out this a serious traffic charge, comparable to a DUI charge, not to be taken lightly. Max penalties and pain are pretty severe. Most of the reckless driving charges that I research on Internet are for high rates of speeding, exceeding max limits. Not finding much reckless driving info wrt rear-end accident experiences. I do plan on getting an attorney. My questions are: 

Anyone have any recent experience of being charged with reckless driving as a result of a car accident, in VA, that sharing with me may help?

The Chamber believes that letting government employees hold small amounts of crypto (and stablecoins too!) would help them better understand the tech they’re regulating, *and* create a level playing field with other financial assets. Seems fair, right?

I’m currently a junior in college living with three other girls. One, Sandra, was my randomly-assigned roommate freshman year. We’ve lived together and been best friends since. We currently live in an off-campus apartment and have separate bedrooms but share a bathroom.

Things took a turn at the start of this year when she started having her long distance boyfriend stay with us for four nights at a time every couple weeks. That did feel like a long time to me but in isolation, it didn’t have to be hard. The problem was, they continuously kept violating what I consider common-sense boundaries. Staying up until 2 or 3 AM talking loudly when I had class in the morning and could hear every word, coming home drunk and slamming doors and screaming in the middle of the night, her boyfriend has terrible aim in the bathroom and wouldn’t clean it up so I had to, a few other things. At one point, I walked in on him in the bathroom when he left the door ajar. It all felt so inconsiderate and never did she ask if it was okay if he could come or really apologize for any of it. At one point, he stayed with us up until 2 days before the LSAT and I had begged her for them to be as quiet as they could. Didn’t happen. 

I thought we had the kind of relationship where we could talk about it so I sat her down and tried to come up with a compromise for the future. Maybe he stays for only 2 nights at a time so it doesn’t land on a school night for me, maybe they talk in the study room down the hall, maybe she cleans the bathroom if he won’t? But she wasn’t looking to the future, she kept pivoting back to what had happened and blaming me for it. She blamed me for walking in on him, and said that it didn’t matter that he didn’t shut or lock the door, I should have known someone was in there. Everything became my fault.

We haven’t talked since. We’ve said hi in passing, I’ve tried to reach out to do things with her, left her coffee. I even got her a boo basket for Halloween. No effort from her. And it wouldn’t be such an issue if our other two roommates weren’t her other best friends. Now, all three of them hang out together constantly and make no effort to include me. I’m excluded by default and over the last few months, it’s been increasingly hard to be at my home. 

Halloween was a sad turning point for me. Before all this happened, I had suggested doing a couples costume with Sandra and had thrown out an idea. Obviously we didn’t do that. But one night, a mutual friend of ours had invited the four of us to a party so I went with them. Sandra did a couples costume with our other roommate, and guess what costume they used? Precisely the one I had suggested. 

Sandra was born and raised in our college town and I’ve gotten to know her family well. Her mom even drove me back from the hospital after I had a procedure. Two days after the party, I went to the store and ran into her mom there, who I hadn’t seen in months. She waved me over, and asked me how the year was going, normal conversation. I answered and she pivoted to asking about her daughter. “How are you guys, how is living together, how do you like (other roommates),” all questions that are normal for a mom to ask but indicated she didn’t know. 

I gave perfunctory answers at first, but finally, I burst into tears. It’s been a hard few months, losing my best friend over trying to set boundaries and feeling iced out of my home. I just let it all out. Her mom comforted me and seemed shocked by everything I said. 

When I got home, Sandra was pissed. Wouldn’t look at me, was being super passive aggressive and calling me a tattletale, saying I went crying to mommy. But I never intended to see her mom, it was a chance meeting in a small city. And her mom ASKED. I didn’t mean to cry or to share. At a certain point, it all just erupted. From my pov, if she didn’t want it to get out then she shouldn’t have done it all to begin with.

I happen to see a post about the Festival mall in Alabang and it triggered a memory. So one night both of us are just having our daily chikas, then we came up with a random date idea, a ""Llao llao date"" during this time there's no franchise yet of llao llao in my city. But I saw a post that they will open their first store in Festive Mall.  So, both of us planned that we will have a date on the day of the soft opening of their kiosk, it's more like a virtual date since we're miles apart. 

On the day of the opening, both of us went to the mall, ikaw sa Festival mall and ako sa Festive mall. I was trying to look for the kiosk of llao llao for 15 minutes pa, meanwhile ikaw naka pila na. I complained to you, sabi ko ""Bubba, bat ganun I've been trying to look for the kiosk for 30 minutes now pero I can't find it."" Lo and behold, I checked the post again, girlllll hindi siya sa FESTIVE MALL,  SA FESTIVAL MALL pala 😭 Ako yung may kasalanan because I didn't double check the location. You told me na lang na we will get donuts, I want din sana sa Krispy Kreme but that's located in another mall, so I ended up getting my coffee and donuts sa Dunkin. 

Moral of the story: Always double check the details 😭😆 But it's alright, both of us still enjoyed our virtual date although it's a bit epic. ",1,1731594206.0,u_Luminous_Sandrine,0,1.0,False

Not super familiar with dating online or via reddit, but there doesn't seem to be much by way of a poly community in my area so seeing what things online are like. 

Little bit about me:

Physically fit, white, beard, tattoos. I love craft beer, whiskey, speciality coffee, basketball, football, bouldering, and have been getting into the pokemon TCG and wine lately. Spend way too much time watching exercise science YouTube videos for someone not getting paid to be a personal trainer. I'm pretty politically aware, lean very left, and think every city should be a 15 minute city.

Would love to grab a drink and get to know you better, pretty open to a wide variety of people though historically I don't get along super well with conservatives or hyper religious people. Would be nice if we had some interests in common, but I'm big on vibe and love people who sort of sit between black cat and golden retriever energy (I like to joke I'm looking for akita energy).

I listened to the ""leaked"" songs uploaded by @ukeyyxxi on YouTube. I just couldn't wait until they actually release in my timezone. 

don't take my opinions personally, this is only what I think, I'm not forcing these opinions on yall. also, these are my first impressions so I might start to like some of the songs that I criticise eventually 

- CYFI? 7.2/10. I think the original live concerts were better. the background concert noises, particularly during the start of the song (ole ole ole) sounded really offbeat. and the change in key is also kinda strange. (but I eventually got used to it) 

- Burn 9/10. Charley made a good choice not to show us the main verses and chorus until its release. the beat is immaculate. peak rock music 

- Ghost 9.5/10. best boywithuke song written to this day ngl, though it's not perfect ofc. honestly my only comments are that he should have sang more emotionally and played the electric guitar solo like in the genius open mic.

- Gaslight 8.5/10. a lot of people dislike it but I personally like it a lot. it's definitely better than CYFI and many other songs on the album. really catchy 

- Stranger 8.9/10 the intro is so weird. the sample was ok but the few random keys before charley started singing makes it sound like it was intentionally made to sound bad. rest of the song is incredible tho. the layers are so detailed. the feminine verse was kinda zesty

- Backseat 7/10. the original concert recordings were so bad. he unexpectedly saved the song from becoming a horrible song with that new beat. still mid and kinda annoying tho

- Coffee 7.5/10. the original snippets would make the song an 8 but that beat change was really strange and it didn't fit the vibe at all. went from a song that could be played at a cafe to a weird genre fusion 

- Paper Planes 8.2/10. no comment, it is exactly as I had expected, decent song

- Petrichor 7.8/10. would give it a higher rating but the other tracks are much better and I don't want my ratings to be too high. the interlude is still excellent though. Petrichor is definitely the better interlude compared to Lucid.

- Pitfall 8.9/10. this is actually better than I had expected from just listening to the snippets. the whole song came together pretty well unlike some songs on the album.

- Corduroy 8.5/10. WHY IS IT SO FIRE the song was really boring at the start and I was hoping that there would be a beat drop and it actually left me surprised. a great song but too slow paced in the starting. 

- Love Lost 8/10. I thought it was gonna be one of those mid songs but it actually turned out pretty good. I wish he sang like this for Ghost. 

- Easier 8.9/10. the instrumental parts are brilliant but I don't like the autotune that randomly appears near the end of the song. sounds really out of place, but overall a very solid song. 

- Change 8.2/10. first part was so refreshing and the ending was unexpected but fire nonetheless. 

Overall album rating: 8.2/10. solid album but there were some really strange elements that I don't like, and as some people are saying, it wasn't well-put together. it just feels like a bunch of random verses combined into songs. even though this rating is pretty low considering how much I glaze bwu, it's still the best rating I've given for a first impression of an album. every other bwu album had a song that I disliked or couldn't vibe to on first listen. but every song in Burnout was unique and epic in its own way.

To everyone else: *Hi, nice to meet you!*

**Introduction**

I’m Luc, a 24 y/o from Central Europe, looking for an additional RP partner around my age. I am looking to create a strong, longterm connection and build an interesting story with you. So far, I’ve only dabbled in realistic settings and SoL stories but I’m open to try out something new — I’m very much open to any ideas you might have.

 **A few KEY requirements**

* You’re somewhat **literate** and have **good grammar**.
* You don’t just write one- or two-liners but if you put **effort** into your paragraphs.
* You’re willing to role-play on **Discord**.
* You're open to put effort into getting to know each other, **OOC**.
* You’re a **communicative** RP partner, we make decisions together.
* You’re okay with writing in **past 3rd tense**.
* You’re looking for a **slow-burn**, **longterm** RP.
* You’re **patient** (My life’s quite busy, I don’t get to write that often. But when I do, I put a lot of effort in and I value everyone who can respect that.)

**Some ideas to get the creative juices flowing:**

I’m strongly looking to add a realistic slowburn romance plot to what I’m currently writing on. A few ideas I have would be:

* **Friends-to-Lovers**: After a rough breakup, a dedicated student asks their best friend to be their „fake date“ to events to avoid awkward encounters with their ex. But as they start playing the role of a couple, lingering feelings and unexpected sparks blur the line between friendship and love. Things get complicated when the ex tries to worm back into their life, stirring up old jealousy and confusion.
* **Friends-to-Lovers**: Two childhood friends make a pact that if they're both single by the time they turn 21, they'll go on a date. As the birthday approaches, one friend starts dating someone new, leaving the other grappling with feelings they didn’t realize were there. The tension mounts when meddling friends and family pick up on the unspoken feelings, pushing them to confront what’s been right in front of them all along.
* **Strangers-to-Lovers**: Both night owls, two students keep running into each other during late-night study sessions at the library. What starts as an awkward series of encounters turns into quiet conversations, shared coffee breaks, and exchanged study tips. Their connection deepens as they find solace in each other’s company, but as final exams approach, both are unsure if the other feels the same way, and friends insist on playing „matchmaker“ to get them out of their shells.
* **Enemies-to-Lovers**: Two students with completely opposite personalities, one very academic, the other a laid-back party-goer, are forced to share a dorm room after a mix-up in administration. Their clashing lifestyles create tension, and both of them can’t stand the other’s habits. But when a campus event puts them on the same team, they start seeing each other in a new light. Old flings and new rumors create additional hurdles.

So, if you’ve read this far without clicking away: **Thank you!** If you have any other ideas, please feel free to tell me about them, I look forward to your message via PM or DM. If your message just says «I’d love to RP» or «Interested», I probably won’t get back to you, but if you cook up a somewhat literate response and maybe also write a couple of sentences about yourself and your writing habits, I’m more likely to be interested. :)

See you soon,

Here’s what happened.

I was at a coffee shop the other day, just grabbing a latte and trying to chill a bit. As I’m sitting there, I see my stepdad walk in. Nothing weird at first—I just assumed he was getting coffee too. But then our *next-door neighbor* walks in right behind him, and they sit down together. They were super close, and at first, I thought, maybe it’s just a friendly catch-up or something. But they started holding hands across the table, and at one point, he leans over and kisses her. Right there, in the middle of the cafe.

I felt sick. My mom has been through so much, and I couldn't believe he’d do this to her. I tried to tell myself it wasn’t real, but I knew I had to let her know. So, I snapped a couple of photos on my phone, just in case she needed proof, and later that night, I showed her. She was devastated, obviously. I mean, who wouldn’t be?

She ended up confronting him, and things have been a mess since then. She’s been talking about leaving him, and they’re arguing all the time. Now, here’s where it gets worse—somehow, *everyone* in my family found out what happened, and they all think I made a huge mistake by telling her. My aunts and uncles are saying I shouldn’t have gotten involved, that it was a “grown-up issue” and that I basically “ruined their marriage.”

They keep saying my mom and stepdad would’ve worked things out eventually, and I’m the reason they’re falling apart. I’m honestly so confused and hurt by all this. I really thought I was doing the right thing by not letting my mom stay in the dark, but now everyone’s making me feel like I made everything worse.

Is it normal/casual to just say “hey, would you wanna hang out sometime, maybe grab coffee?” Ugh, drives me nuts ruminating on this! Any help/advice is greatly appreciated ",1,1731593728.0,dating_advice,12,0.67,False
