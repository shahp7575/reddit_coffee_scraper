Yerba mate rests in its carved gourd like an ancient memory, green leaves steeped spring water; essence of rain. 

Guaraní hands passed this ritual through the forest, honoring fire, breath, and the circle of sharing. 

The bombilla, a silver spine, drawing light and bitterness into one quiet stream. 

Each sip warms my heart, sharpens my mind, and softens the edges of my time. 

Sips weave past and present together. 

In the pause between, my body remember its river, my spirit knows its horizon, and the earth remembers me...steady, grateful, and slowly healed with each returning morning. 

I breathe.

The Nikon N90s characteristics shine through: sharp center focus with gentle edge softness from the AF Nikkor 50mm f/1.8D lens, authentic film grain, slight lens flare from the lamp, natural color rendition with warm bias, minor dust specks, and unretouched scan imperfections like faint scratches. Skin details include visible pores, fine lines, moles, and blemishes under the dim light.

The cozy 1990s living room features shag carpet, bulky CRT TV on a wood entertainment center playing a VHS tape, bean bag chair, posters on beige walls—a Pulp Fiction movie poster, Nirvana Smiley Face print, and a Michael Jordan dunk photo—and cluttered coffee table with Tamagotchi toy, MTV magazine, and a lava lamp casting orange glow. 3:2 aspect ratio, high-resolution scan from original 35mm negative, evoking authentic mid-90s amateur home snapshot.",0,1770668551.0,Bard,3,0.5,False
1r0fcej,https://i.redd.it/r8k0j42h2jig1.png,"The Shifting Sands of Local SEO: Are Backlinks Still King, or Do AI Citations Rule Now?","The world of search engine optimization is constantly evolving, and a provocative question has been making the rounds lately: **Do small businesses still need traditional backlinks, or are ""AI citations"" the new, more effective path to local visibility?** This isn't just a technical debate; it has significant implications for how small businesses allocate their marketing budgets and strategy.

# The Evolving Landscape of Local Visibility

For years, backlinks have been a cornerstone of SEO, signaling authority and trustworthiness to search engines. For many small businesses, securing high-quality backlinks has been a challenging, time-consuming, and often expensive endeavor. However, with the rise of AI in search, voice assistants, and personalized results, some argue that the emphasis is shifting. Is the traditional model of authority through links being supplanted by a new paradigm where **accurate, ubiquitous, and AI-understandable business information** holds more weight, especially for local searches? **How significant is the decay of traditional backlink value for a local coffee shop compared to a SaaS company?** And **are we truly seeing a decline in the** ***need*** **for backlinks, or merely a re-prioritization in certain niches?**

# AI Citations: A New Frontier?

The concept of ""AI citations"" often refers to the comprehensive optimization of a business's digital presence across a multitude of platforms, ensuring that AI-powered search engines, voice assistants, and local directories consistently understand and surface accurate, consistent information. This extends beyond simple name, address, phone (NAP) consistency to include granular details, service offerings, operating hours, and even dynamic attributes, all presented in a machine-readable format.

* **Focus on Ubiquity:** The idea is to saturate the local digital ecosystem with precise business information, making it easy for any AI system to recommend or direct users.
* **Beyond Directories:** While traditional citations often meant major directory listings, AI citations aim for a much broader network, including niche platforms, map services, and emerging AI-driven tools.
* **Schema Markup & Structured Data:** A critical component, ensuring business details are easily digestible by algorithms.
* **Voice Search Optimization:** Directly addresses how AI assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant find and share local business information.

For instance, platforms specializing in **AI-powered local SEO** are emerging, emphasizing the optimization of business information across a wide network of relevant local platforms, voice assistants, and emerging AI search engines. The goal is to ensure businesses are accurately represented and highly visible where customers are *actually looking* for local services, moving beyond just traditional directory listings. They argue this approach creates a ""hyper-local digital footprint,"" making businesses discoverable by the new generation of search mechanisms. This raises a crucial point: **is the definition of ""citation"" simply expanding, or is its** ***impact*** **fundamentally changing relative to backlinks for local businesses?**

# Strategic Considerations for Small Businesses

This debate forces small business owners and marketers to rethink their SEO strategies.

* **Resource Allocation:** If AI citations yield better local results for less effort or cost, should resources shift away from backlink campaigns?
* **Business Type:** Does this distinction matter more for brick-and-mortar businesses and service providers compared to e-commerce or online-only ventures?
* **Future-Proofing:** Is investing in AI citation strategies a way to future-proof local search visibility against further algorithm shifts and AI advancements?

It’s a complex landscape with passionate arguments on both sides.

# Join the Discussion

I lay in bed and stare up at the ceiling counting the little popcorn bumps. I groan as I check the time on my twin bell alarm clock. ""Fuck... Works starts in an hour."" I was honestly hoping I could wake up a little earlier so I could get some food in me before I went to work, maybe watch some YouTube. But I settled on scrolling through Instagram reels instead. Scrolling endlessly with mind numbing swiftness, dreading having to pull myself out of bed and get ready. A pling notified me from my manager of the address we would be cleaning that day. ""Fuck it!"" I said as I threw my phone to the far end of my mattress. I got up, brushed my teeth and jumped in the shower. Throwing on some old dirty jeans from the past 5 days in a row and a black t shirt with holes around the bottom. A quick look in the mirror and ruffling my brown hair and a stupid smile ""you're a wreck"" I thought. I walk out of my laundry covered room and grab my keys off the kitchen table.

I pulled up to the address and saw my coworker John getting all the cleaning supplies out of the back of the van.

""John Manager, what's up man."" As I walked up to him. 

""Shut up Will."" He scoffed to himself 

John was a no bulshit kind of guy, grizzled maybe in his early 40's I wouldn't bother asking. He was good company, had his jokes and dry humor. All I cared about was that he was a good manager and coworker. He actually got his hands dirty when you needed him and jumped onto any situation to give you tips. Not in a know it all douchey way either, He's a good dude is my point.

""why don't you help me get the hazmat suits out of the truck."" He groaned as he put a massive bucket of bleach onto the concrete.

""Got you, so what's going on up in the apartment? Any word on what we are walking into?"" I said as I rummaged through the van.

""I'm not too sure, all I heard was something happened with the guys teeth and he croaked about a week ago. No one heard from him and they called in a wellness check. Sure enough we are here, so yeah.... Hes dead"" he said with a kind of stare off into the distance and hands on his sides.

""Oh word? He's not alive and breathing? I thought we were here to say hi. Maybe give him a kiss on the cheek or something.""  I said dumbfounded

""Yeah you can go give the cadaver a kiss on the cheek if you want."" John said laughing 

""So where the hell is Arin...it's 10:30... Dude is seriously late every fucking day."" I said noticeably annoyed I threw the 3 hazmat suits onto the pavement next to the bleach.

""Yeah I know he is, he sent me a text I guess his alarm went off late I don't know. I just saw his car pull in so whatever."" He said brushing it off.

""NOT WHATEVER! FUCK THAT DUDE! John, I bust my ass to get here on time every day and that scrawny fuck is always late!!!"" I said throwing my hands up

Arin walked up to the van with his big Osiris shoes and an oversized tap out shirt way too big for his skinny frame. Tall, goofy greasy hair. His breath always smelled like he rolled out of bed and ran out of the door. I Hate this guy. Who the fuck wears tap out shirts and Osiris shoes in 2025. I'm not even sure they make them anymore.

""You guys started unpacking already?"" Arin said with fake concern in his voice clearly trying to cover his ass.

""Uh yuh we did. We started at 10."" I said as I walked by him to grab the respirators out of the van. 

""Arin grab the brooms and mops and get it ready to go up to the apartment and hurry up, I don't feel like being here all night. And before you give me some dumb excuse just get your suit on man. This is your 3rd last warning, you're late again and I'm kicking your ass to the curb."" John said with a stern tone.

""Alright alright...I'm sorry I just was on my way here an-"" John cut off Arin

""I just said I don't give a shit! Do what I asked please."" John said with anger.

All while this was happening I couldn't help but notice the lack of cars in the parking lot. It's late at night on a Tuesday. Shouldn't there be more people here? Probably why no one to noticed the smell, No one lives here.

We got all suited up, big yellow hazmat suits, respirators and goggles. Dressed to the nines ready for whatever it is we were going into. 

We had to walk up 5 flights of stairs just to get to the fucking apartment. For some reason they didn't have an elevator in this place. How the hell do they even get furniture in these rooms. 

""So what's the room number?"" Arin asked

""565 is the room, we're almost there."" John said winded from the stairs.

We finally got to the room. A coffee brown stain on the bottom of a white door that has seen much better days. The green paint on the trim of the door has begun chipping and falling off as if it were dripping some rank ichor onto the dark grey carpet of the hallway. Little did any of us know at the time. This rot was a sign of the corruption that seeped out from within that horrible room. A sign of the foreboding madness that lay waiting within.

""So uh who wants to do the honors and open the door?"" John asked Arin and I in a bouncy tone. He's clearly been doing this much longer than us.

""I got it."" I said with my chin to my chest and hand in the air.

As I put my hand on the door knob I couldn't help but feel a creeping sense of anxiety. Not exactly full blown panic or anything, but the feeling in my gut that whatever it is we were going to walk in on was something that should not be mettled with. Not in the sense of gore, but something completely off. Something macabre that should be left well alone... As I turned the door knob a small voice ever so soft was screaming at me to quit that job right then and there and up and leave. I could deal with John later I'm a good worker, Im sure he would understand. But I gritted my teeth and opened the door. A rush of air flooded into the stale dark apartment. Even through the respirator I could smell the all too familiar coppery scent of blood. I sat their for a second, and I couldn't put my finger on why. I've done multiple jobs before this, seen horrible things. So why does this one job in a random apartment complex feel like something so wrong. I huffed to myself and let out a small ""okay."" And heaved the door all the way open as if I had to push it through some sort of viscious fluid. I'm

The door let out a small creak and a smack. As it hit the wall. I saw nothing, it was too dark in the apartment. So I stepped my right boot in and reached my arm onto the wall. Desperately reaching out for some sort of switch, finally my hand caught leverage. I flipped the light on and the scene before me was something I could never have imagined.

As the lights came on, John, Arin and I were absolutely taken back. The only person to utter any form of opinion or word about what laid before us was John a quick short simple ""woah."" Is all he said.

The room laid out, a simple small 2 bedroom apartment. Living room, kitchen and bedroom were right in front of us and to the right was a small bathroom. In the corners of the room crimson erupted up from the baseboard just out of grasp of the ceiling in all four corners. Crumpled pages laid sprawled out in a random incoherent order all around the room. The couch laid in 2 pieces split down the middle as if someone too heavy sat right in the center. The bed displayed signs of ensanguination, the mattress soaking up the hemmorage like a giant sponge. Writings all over the wall, the only decernable message in some desperate manner was a name or a word? 

""Vrag Gnasth?"" I said aloud in a questioning manner.

""What the hell does that mean."" Arin said puzzled

At the center of all of laid a rotting mass of meat and rotting teeth. Laying in front of it all, a small brown journal with an almost vine looking design on the cover. 

""What the fuck."" I said in disbelief

Arin stands there saying nothing. A man of few words and even fewer thoughts. Fucking hate that guy.

""Well let's get to it! I said it earlier and I'll say it again. I don't want to be here all night. I got a date with a 30 rack at 6am and you can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning."" John said and smacked his hands together with a loud clap and bounced forward into the gore with a mop and bucket. Old blood sticking to the wheels of the bucket as he pushes it into the room.

Shaking his head Arin followed behind. 

After a solid 2-3 hours of cleaning and scrubbing and ripping up the carpets.

I picked up the brown journal that was now tossed to the side, in a pile of dreams put to an end too early.  I flipped through the pages, It looked fairly normal with random dates and entries almost like a diary.

""Hey John, so what are we gonna do with all this uh.."" I looked down at the pile of rotting carrion ""..this...guys things?""

""I was told to throw it all away, the guy didn't have any family."" John said packing the mans clothes into a garbage bag.

I figured I would keep it for myself and read it later. I don't know why I had the urge to take it for myself, but I had this itch in my brain I couldn't scratch and at that moment taking the journal felt like it would help.

Me and Arin stood in front of the van fully packed with bags full of torn up carpet and various fluids. I pulled down the hood of my suit and lifted off the respirator taking in the biggest suck of fresh air iv had in the past 5 hours. Whiping the sweat off my forehead I turn to John who was walking out of the apartment complex.

""Is that the last of it?"" I said with a huff catching my breathe from the 5 flights of stairs. ""My legs feel like fucking jello."" I whined into the air twords no one. 

""They seriously need to put an elevator in there or something."" Said Arin holding his lower back

""Yup, that's most of it. The morning crew will come in and finish up in about 3 hours, so we should be set to go home."" John said with a satisfied smile.

""I'm beat, see you guys later."" Arin said as he turned around to walk to his car.

""Wait up man."" I said to him in an annoyed tone ""John is there anything else you need from us? Are we good?"" I said with a thumbs up 

John gave us a hearty thumbs up and sent us on our way. I turned around and bolted twords my car I couldn't get there fast enough, I needed a shower and bad. Arin said bye to me but I scoffed and got into my car. Fuck that guy. Dude seriously sucks.

After a long drive of depersonalizing and listening to the radio. I finally came too as I pulled into my drive way. I didn't have much, just a nice little 1 story home I rented out with the money I made from the job. I walked in and threw my keys on the kitchen table and tossed the odd journal beside it.

After washing blood from my ears and the little bits of whatever the hell that got in through the hood. I dried off my hair and plopped into bed. The sun was rising at this point.

Thinking back on that job, why didn't any of us even question what the hell we walked in on. The dude was reduced to a pile of meat. Not to mention the rotted teeth that were thrown into the mess, it doesn't make any sense. It was just needlessly violent for no reason. Most of the scenes, even murders aren't like that. like yeah it's gross but it's someone laying in bed or on the floor, maybe some blood here and there in the carpet or on the walls. Not a pile of organs and bone and a cascade of blood all throughout the apartment. 

I decided I'd do a little research online to see what had happened to the guy. I didn't find much, just a name and a obituary. The guy really didn't have any family, his name was Daniel Cline. I guess he was married at one point but had a nasty divorce.

Obviously I wouldn't find anything on him if there really was something odd going on... It's not like I'm some CIA agent, all I have is Google. But at the crime scene there were pages almost laid out on the floor in a manner like he was studying something. Not to mention that another language written on the wall in blood, Vrag Gnasth. 

""Vrag Gnasth, that doesn't even make any sense."" I said allowed questioning it once again. 

So I tried googling that and nothing came up only that typical ""your search query couldn't find existing documents.""

""Whatever"" I thought.

I decided I'd get some sleep so maybe I could actually wake up at a normal time to get some stuff done before everything closed. 

I awoke to the sound of grinding. Almost like a squeeking sound. Like glass scouring together, violently. The sound itself gave me a visceral reaction. I could feel a chill down to the core of my bones. My eyes shot open almost in a panic. I looked around my room and nothing still alone as always. 

I took a peek at the time, it was 10pm What the hell? I fell asleep at 8am. You're telling me I slept for 15 hours. Probably from all the hard work I did going up and down those stairs.

 I decided I'd check my phone to see if John messaged me about a new job, Im normally on call at random times during the week. This was one of those times, but nope no texts or calls. Guess no one's died recently.. or found at least. While checking my phone I couldn't help but notice a slight pain in my jaw. That same aching feeling I got when my wisdom teeth were pulled when I was 17. Sore, aching?  

""Ow"" I said to myself rubbing my jaw. 

I groaned as I opened and wiggle my mouth around in an attempt to maybe stretch out the pain. No dice, it was still there.  

Shaking it off, I rolled out of bed and threw on some old shirt after giving it the sniff test, I decided it would be a pretty boring night considering it was late. Only thing open right now is the gas station down the street so I guess I'm not getting groceries. I plopped my happy ass down on the couch in my living room rubbing my aching legs and grabbing the remote. Figured I'd throw on some creep cast or something on YouTube, catch up on some old stories. 

While watching them talk about some goofy my little pony story I started hearing that grinding noise again. So I paused the video, looking around the room listening trying to pin point the exact source of this noise just so I could stop it. It was horrible! No matter where I looked it sounded like it was right on top of me. I figured maybe it was something outside. So I opened my window and nothing, there's absolutely no one out there and why would there be? . I threw my head in my hands. And that's when I noticed it, it was me. I was the source of the excruciating noise. I have been grinding my teeth this whole time! As soon as I caught it, it stopped. And soon after the pain I felt this morning returned. 

""What the fuck"" I said rubbing my jaw. 

""Maybe it's all the stress from work getting to me?"" I'm pretty sure stress can do weird things like that right? Maybe I just need some beer, take the edge off. That gas station down the road might actually come in handy after all.

I flung open the door to the easy fill and heard a loud chime of the bell above the door. At the counter was an overweight man with glasses and a unkempt beard. Looked like he couldn't be fucked to be here. He was sitting at the counter with his arms wrapped around his chest and his chin down staring at his little phone. ""Probably a discord mod."" I thought to myself and laughed.

I made my way to the back and grabbed a 6 pack of Bush. Didn't like the stuff that much but it's what I could find that wasn't shitty. I brought it up to the counter.

""How ya doin."" I said making small talk with the man

""Ohhh you know...just another day in paradise. Been looking for the girl of my dreams back here on my phone."" He said with a snark laugh

""Oh yeah?"" I laughed nerviously 

Oh God one of these. I thought to myself

""That'll be 8.95$ sir."" He said with hot breath

I gave him the cash.

""Looks like you got your wisdom teeth pulled recently. Your cheeks are puffed up, I wouldn't be drinking beer like this if I were you. You know, it can actually unclott the blood and give you dry socket."" He said while he was giving me my change.

""What?"" I felt the back of my jaw and sure enough it was swollen like a gumball.

I took my change and quickly left the gas station.

As I sat in my car I hurriedly pull down the sun shield and looked into the mirror. Holy shit I look like I got hit by a baseball bat. I drove home rubbing my face and racking my brain thinking about what I could have done to start this? I mean maybe grinding my teeth? But really that vigorously and not noticing while I did it?! What the hell.

As I sat back down on the couch I cracked open one of the beers and took a sip. The cold beer on the back of my gums felt nice. The alcohol helped too and the pain soon subsided, as I watched YouTube I felt myself finally relaxing. No more pain in my face and no more pain in my legs fucking finally I thought. After finishing the 6 pack of Bush I soon fell asleep on the couch with my TV on. 

While I slept I drempt of a dark void with a crimson glow. I was standing there that much I knew. I could feel my body but not see anything. I tried to look at my hands but nothing was there. I felt the increasing panic rise in my chest and my breathe quicken. It felt as though I had masses and bumps under my skin, wriggling and moving. The foreign objects, I could feel them pushing against one another begging for more room inside my arms. All I hear is the same grinding sound but this time it is accompanied by a wet sloshing smacking sound. Like meat in a grinder that is far too dull to get the job done without violent force. The noise rose slowly in volume. Getting louder and louder. I desperately looked around for something, anything. Any sort of light. Something to grace my eyes with an explanation or some sort of false comfort. There was nothing but the sound ""Gnasstthhh Gnasssshhhthhh Gnassssttthhhh"" louder and louder

It felt like I was stuck in this void for hours. I could feel my palms pressed against my ears but nothing stopped this noise from assaulting my ear drums ""GNASTHSH GNASHTHHH GNASSSSHHHHTTTHHHH"" I finally awoke in a panicked sweat. 

 

""WHAT THE FUCK!"" I yelled to myself.

I franticly rubbed my arms and legs to check if I was infact okay. There was nothing, it was a dream. I knew that but I couldn't stop myself.  The pain in my face has returned and is definetly not ignorable. I rushed to the bathroom to look in the mirror. Prying my mouth open and cheek to the side. In the back of my mouth, my wisdom teeth were growing back in. 

Blood soaked the bottom of the tooth already half way erupting from my gums. Top and bottom wisdom teeth are growing back at an alarming pace. I poked them, they were real but they weren't nearly as secure as the rest of my teeth. They grew as if there was nothing below to anker them into my mouth. I poked and prodded and moved them with my fingers. Twisting and pushing the left molar. I pulled my hand out of my mouth and steadied myself on the bathroom sink looking into the mirror. I don't want to but I think I have too. I smack my hands on the edge of the sink, open my mouth and lean closer to the mirror with determination. I grabbed my left wisdom tooth and pulled. The pain was unimaginable.


 I yanked and the tooth gave way. As I pulled a thick stringy twine-like mass of veins laid below. I yelled at the top of my lungs as I pulled, blood pooled into the crevice underneath my tongue. I felt the warmth of blood filling my mouth. Screaming in pain gargling as it went down my throat. I didn't care, this wasn't right it shouldn't be growing back. It doesn't make any sense. Finally with a swift ""plenk"" the tooth came out. Leaving a small hole with flesh in its place, oozing yellow and white fluid. My effort wasn't unrewarded though, the pain had begun to fade in the left side of my face.


I breathed heavily spitting the blood and infection into the sink. Taking a deep sip of water I swished it around and spit. Finally as I calmed myself, I took a good look at the tooth. There was a full crown on the top but the sides were ripe with decay. It smelled like rot. Underneath laid a dark red ball of tissue. I tossed it to the side of my bathroom counter. ""What the fuck is going on."" I could feel tears welling in my eyes. Why the hell don't I have health insurance. I cursed myself on top of all the bulshit that was happening. With my head in my arms draped over the bathroom sink I wept. 


I grabbed the tooth and returned to my couch, plopping myself back down defeated with the pain I still felt in the rest of my face. I wanted it to stop but if it meant going through what I just did again and again I don't think I could do it. I stared at this alien object I extracted from my maw. 


""It just doesn't make any fucking sense."" I sighed.


Googling ""can wisdom teeth regrow in face"" didn't yield any information because surprise no they fucking don't. So now I'm sitting here in pain wondering what the hell is even happening to me. Laying down on my couch defeated and staring at the ceiling. The silence didn't last long though. It starts up again, the grinding of my teeth. Rubbing vigorously and with force hard enough to shatter my teeth, I was waiting for them to shatter through one another into the gums above and below. But that isn't happening. Over and over I open my mouth smack it back down and grind my teeth hard. I scream in pain but it comes out as muffled yelp from my mouth being forced shut. I panic, I don't know what to do. I don't have control over my own jaw. The only thing I can think to do in my altered state is punch myself as hard as I can in the mouth. Doing so lodges two rotted teeth into my knuckles. 


""OKAY I GOTTA GET HELP"" I say allowed 


I quickly rummage for my phone, it must have fallen into the cracks during the struggle with my over active jaw. I try to stick my hand in between the cushions but the teeth that are stuck in my left hand dig further into my tendons. That's when I noticed it. 


""I hit myself with my right fist, how the hell did-"" I say puzzled


I pull my hand from the couch and hold it out in front of my face inspecting every inch of my hand. 2 rotted teeth are peeking out from the back of my hand, 3 are growing from under my finger nails 2 under my thumb and 1 under my pinky. I yell in panic as I notice they're slowly growing ripping and tearing apart my nails grasp from my finger. 


""What do I do! WHAT DO I D-"" I begin to cough and choke as my throat begins to become blocked. I feel my face begin to turn red and the pressure growing in my visage. I look down and begin to see bumps begin to form under my skin along my arms. I raise my shirt and see the same. Blood begins to pour out of each hole. Growing and growing, heavier and heavier I feel my feet begin to press into the carpet below me. All at once I feel as though I will erupt, pop like a zit filled with calcium. My vision begins to fade to black. I'm begging and pleading inside myself for this to stop. As it begins to crescendo feel my body stretch and finally collapse into itself. A wave of blood erupts from me like a volcano. Shooting in every single direction in my little home. There I lay, a pile of what I once was. Gone.


Chapter 4


""Hey Arin, we got another clean up job. I'll send you over the address. When you see it just let me know if you'll be alright doing it with me. I know it might be tough."" John said over the phone in a somber tone.


""Sounds good"" I say as I hang up the phone.


My phone beeps with a notification. When I check it, I notice it's my friend Wills address. Oh shit... I guess that explains why he hasn't shown up to work in a couple of days. 


As I walk up to the familiar home I've only seen dropping off my co-worker will when his car was broken down. I see John already suited up and ready. 


""We started at 10 right John?"" I said concerned.


""Yeah we did, you're on time. Guess I'm just antsy to get this clean up done. Will didn't deserve this..."" John said sadly


""Yeah he didn't..."" I said with my hands in my pockets and a sigh.


When me and John finished up our portion of the clean up I noticed that same journal that we saw at the other job on Wills table. I thought that was odd, so I decided to open it up and take a look at what was written in there. Sure enough the first couple pages were just day to day stuff. Boring days at the office, something about a bad divorce with this guy's wife cheating. 


""There's that weird thing again Varg Gnasth"" I said aloud to myself.


But then I flipped towards the back and noticed a page with something real weird scribbled on it over and over. It looked like it was written in a hurry almost like someone was panicking. All it was over and over was ""don't say his name""

Moving into an apartment in 2 months and am looking at getting a couch that would best fit my space. Dimensions aren't 100%, but I did my best to measure from the given floor plan (total area is 689 sf).

What type of couch (regular sofa, sofa with ottoman, L-shape sectional, etc.) would be best? I would prefer something that I could lie down/sleep on.

Furniture I currently have is sketched in. I don't have a dining table & chairs, but I do have 2 bar stools. I also have 2 3-shelf bookcases and a small rectangular coffee table that I did not sketch in, as I can be a bit more flexible with those and wanted to plan around the couch. I also have a 58"" wide TV stand that the TV goes on.

Turns out, the real issue was caffeine. Specifically, when I was drinking it.

**The science:** Caffeine has a half-life of 3-9 hours, depending on your genetics. For me, it's about 5.5 hours. That means if I drink coffee at 3 PM, I still have 25% of that caffeine in my system at 8:30 PM.

No wonder I couldn't fall asleep.

**What I changed:** I built an app (ARC) that calculates my caffeine cutoff time based on:

* My natural wake time
* My chronotype
* My personal half-life

Now I get a notification when I'm approaching my ""Caffeine Wall"" - the last safe time to drink coffee.

Result: I fall asleep faster and feel more rested in the morning.

I'm offering 50% for the first 50 people (35 left) if anyone wants to try it.

1r0f9gz,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1r0f9gz/trying_to_be_less_of_a_bummer/,Trying to be less of a bummer,"Hi everyone. For the past year and a half I've dealt with increasing health issues, and received a dx about six months ago for an uncommon autoimmune disease. I started medication and in the time since have had ups and downs with adjusting to the side effects, and not taken all of it super well. (For example, I'm steadily losing my hair, am now immunocompromised and while it's changed so much of my day-to-day pain, I'm still frequently fatigued.)

In that same six months, I dealt with a lot of change — a close family member's death, a massive job change and now seeking FT employment, a best friend and roommate moving across the globe, my other friends getting married. I'm really finding myself feeling more and more lonely, and my existing friend group feels like it's shrinking. 

When I was going through everything last year, I was almost aggressively positive and upbeat even though I was scared shitless. But now I have answers and a treatment plan, and it feels like the weight of everything is sinking down on me. I'm going to be on medication (with a side effect of possible cancer) for the rest of my life; I'm in constant pain and my body hurts all the time even when I want to ignore it; I can't drink and socialize with my friends that way, and I'm in my mid-twenties. I didn't ever anticipate this happening and while my friends were supportive through all the tests and scans, I feel totally alone now. I feel like this disease has sapped all the life out of me sometimes and because I live alone now, a lot of that struggling is just for me to see.

My mom and I are close, and when talking today, she said that ""sometimes time with [me] can feel heavy."" I get what she means. I have a really intense job that often follows me home, and that plus the constant pain and health stuff definitely feels heavy for me, let alone for my friends. While I don't want to minimize myself, I want to feel less lonely, and with that I think I need a mindset shift about meds and my dx. I'm not stranger to mindset shifts and being recklessly optimistic about everything, in spite of everything; it just feels impossible. 

Right now, though, I can barely deal with minor inconveniences without crying. While I was heading to hang out with the friend group last night, I was starting to cry in the Uber. I felt even more lonely in a room full of people who know me, including my best friend, who has been drifting away ever since he got married. Only one of my friends has ever indicated that she feels the heaviness (she jokingly called me the ""bummer friend,"" which I haven't been able to forget), but no one else has. I just don't know how to shake it off. I always ask people how they're doing, I'm an active listener, I engage in their hobbies and smile and play the part and am nice and helpful and happy and all of it, but it still feels like they're drifting away. 

Based on what my mom said I can't help but think of that heaviness and with everything going on I know it's probably being felt by them. I just don't know what to do, and the last thing I want is to become someone who lets inconveniences and problems rule them instead of the other way around. I don't want to be heavy. I don't want to be the bummer friend. I wish I had the energy to invest in having a bunch of people over for a party, or could slice through brain fog to frequently try and grab drinks or coffee and follow through. I feel like I'm straddling the line between wanting so badly to have connections and not wanting to overextert myself, and it's a line that I wish my friends could help me navigate.

I'm also clean from alcohol for around the same amount of time which I highly recommend and honestly you're a pussy if you need alcohol to get through life.

Get clean, but accept that your life as you live it now may only be acceptable to you because your natural response to your circumstances is being numbed by caffeine  You may want to fucking kill yourself when you have to live the life you live now sober and realize how fucked it is. Being caffeine free has led me to make large, very big life changes, like leaving a software engineering career to make $15 an hour as a plumbing apprentice. I was fucking miserable and suicidal for a lot of these two years and 3 months but I'm doing really fucking good now and it's because of the work I put in and the changes I made that I wouldn't have made were it not for quitting caffeine.

You can stay asleep until you die like everyone else or you can jump into the fire and hope you make it like I did.

and yeah, it's actually that fucking deep, I'm genuinely not just being dramatic here.

Practical tips: 

\- fuck decaf coffee and fuck chocolate. If you're caffeine free then your tolerance will go down to the point that the small doses of caffeine in those substances will affect you in a similar way to how a cup of coffee affects the average person.  adjacently, fuck NA beer for similar reasons.  just drink water.

\- Lifting, eating right (cook your own food), cold showers, and 7 hours of sleep a night are king for maintaining your energy levels.  Semen retention as well for men.

\- there's a good chance you'll be depressed for a while after you quit, AVOID THE INTERNET. I think it's by far the easiest thing to get addicted to when depressed (also the internet has porn, which is bad).  get a dumb phone (Sunbeam hickory is good) or an Android that you can remove the Play store and web browser from using shizuku and canta and cancel the Wi-Fi to your home (do this either way) so that you can't install them back unless you leave to go somewhere else to get an internet connection. I do the Android option because the modern world is easier to navigate if you're able to download apps (I know I mentioned remove the Play store but you can still download apps by going somewhere with Wi-Fi reinstalling the Play store downloading the app and then removing the play store again before you leave the place that has Wi-Fi) (you can also do this to access the internet without leaving an internet browser on your phone for certain critical tasks)

\- do meaningful, difficult work. this is the hardest part.

\- meditation helped me early on, though I don't practice it anymore.

\- take meticulous care of the place you live. keep it well organized, clean, and annihilate clutter. throw a lot of things away. your environment has massive impact on your mood and energy levels.

\- I am not good at forming or maintaining community, but it seems to be very important. I wish I could offer more advice here.  the only suggestion I have is to keep trying and pray lol

1r0f3dc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r0f3dc,Am I the a****** for not “moving on” from behaviors that never stopped in the first place?,"(The screenshots look like they’re in backwards order.)  


My brother and I have had a difficult relationship for our entire lives.

Over the past year, he has criticized every single thing I do, down to when I bought myself Dunkin Donuts a while ago for the first time in months. I got a massive lecture for that, and for the past year and a half he would literally push to see my bank account to show me how much I am wasting money if I can’t actively save up on my small income. I have shown other people in my life my purchases, and they said there is nothing wrong with them. He even criticized me for buying Christmas presents at all in 2024. It took me 12 months to purchase myself a broom because of how much he got in my head. At one point, I was eating mostly sandwiches for 2 of my 3 meals a day to try to save up money (which still didn’t work with the cost of living.) I stopped spending money on hobbies and strictly only bought necessities. But he still pushed hard to see my bank account so he could tell me what I was doing wrong if I couldn’t save up money.

He has criticized every part of my life in some way or another. I even study “too much” for college, even though I only study for 3-4 hours a day (that includes learning everything for the first time, not just memorizing and taking tests; as well as working on assignments— I do school online), and he also has no way of actually knowing that. He just assumes.

He criticized me for so much more. He is like that toward everyone, and other family members have said it hurts them bad (to the point he accuses people of outright making deep stuff up, even if there is legitimate proof it). He looks for everything wrong with another person. So he’s not just like that with me. In his eyes, I can’t buy a sandwich and coffee at Dunkin every 2-3 months or even buy a small amount of Christmas presents (I cut down spending a whole lot on presents.) And he pushed over and over to see my bank account, because he “knew” I must be doing something wrong if I couldn’t save up money.

But the worst was the sexual “jokes”. Including about urine fetishes, which went on for several months. He once talked about it for 20 minutes straight when I was in the car with him despite obvious discomfort. He then told his gf I asked if there would be “golden showers” at her brother’s wedding shower they were about to go to (which I absolutely did not, but he often does that with his sexual “jokes”). Then another time he told me there was piss in a cup when I asked him if there was anything in a cup in his car so I could dump it out for him. Among more with the urine fetish topic.

But now he says it was one joke about a Chinese place called “The Gold Shower”. Even though the night before that he said his gf told him jokes about “golden showers“ are not okay, and it was obvious from what he said about them the night before it had nothing to do with a Chinese restaurant. But the night after it changed to one joke that was about a Chinese restaurant called “The Gold Shower”.

And when I told him I was not going to tolerate sexual jokes in any capacity with him and that they are not appropriate in a sibling relationship, he stopped them for a few months, but then months later he told one and then immediately said in a mocking voice, before I could even get my own input in, “\[My name\], you aren’t supposed to talk about that kind of stuff with your brother!” And that’s when they started again (luckily not about the “golden showers”, but I was still uncomfortable. And continued to be uncomfortable for my duration of my time around him because of the jokes.)

So in his eyes, I am the one in the wrong for not “moving on” and “letting go” of my “grudge” regarding behavior he has no intention of stopping whatsoever (not only the sexual “jokes” but his behavior in general). I am not sure how he expected me to “move on” from behavior that was still ongoing.

So I blocked him after the behaviors I had to “move on” from started again (and the “moving on” thing was said by him when I called out the behaviors when they re-started.) I had “let it go” for a while and considered our relationship in the middle of mending, and had let go of things till they started again. I actually felt at ease for the small amount of time he wasn’t an ah\*le.

But I am not sure how it makes sense to expect someone to “move on” from behavior that never stopped in the first place, and behavior that was minimized and then outright lied about (his behavior in general). They stopped temporarily (for a week or two) after I moved away from him, and I thought with physical distance I’d finally have peace.

His form of accountability throughout this thing has been deflecting blame onto me for being bothered and even outright lying later about things he has said right in front of me (on multiple occasions.) And then telling me I need to “move on” and “let go” of behaviors that he actively continued.

(I am only blocking names out so that it -somehow- doesn’t get back to friends or family. I don’t know how it would, but I know it would make him look bad if it did.)

The only reason it matters now is I can’t stop replaying it all in my head, to make sure I wasn’t the problem somehow or did something to deserve it. And it hurts immensely that I am now going to have to grieve over the relationship with my brother, even if it wasn’t healthy one bit.

I am still trying to dissect the entire thing and trying to stop myself from not looking for ways it could’ve been my fault or that I did something to deserve it.

I am just in pain, because I absolutely did not want it to come down to removing him from my life. I thought physical distance would be the answer, but it seems with physical distance he has even less of a reason to take accountability.

  
Trying to actively shove it out of my head is making me think about it more. I don’t know if you’ve ever tried to push something out of your mind hard, but it usually has the exact opposite effect.",1,1770667933.0,toxicfamilies,0,1.0,False

It’s off a busy highway so I can seldom hear customers in the driver seat unless they’re speaking slightly above normal tone or I hang halfway out the window. 

I have been getting an influx of customers coming in where the driver is peeved at my existence and annoyed that they’re at a coffee stand, so the passenger orders for them. Here’s the kicker, the passenger is whispering sweet nothings that no one can hear. Because of this, I’ll often say “What was that?” and the driver gets a tad bit more upset that they have to repeat it. 

I also have male customers coming in with their girlfriends/wives and before the male driver can speak, his partner speaks for him. Sometimes I can’t hear the partner, so I’ll ask for clarification from the driver (cause they’re literally the middle-man between us) to which the passenger still speaks up in the same silent pitch as before but this time with attitude because I dared to even speak to their boyfriend/husband. Trust me, I don’t want your man, I want Bad Bunny. 

I don’t have ANY issue with passengers ordering considering I will do that when I’m the passenger and visiting a drive thru coffee shop; this issue lies when you are quieter than a mouse fart and proceed to give some attitude over me asking the driver for assistance.

Lots of places might do a decent coffee but tend to do standard French style croissants or similar pastries rather than Italian style filled Cornetti which, in my opinion, are far superior. The type I mean tend to be filled with some kind of jam (usually apricot) or patisserie cream. 

So what are your recommendations for the best Italian cafes in London? Bonus points for any that might fulfil my craving for a morning cornetti",2,1770667674.0,LondonFood,0,1.0,False

I'm completely new to coffee machines. my husband and I were discussing how it may be easier and safer for me to use by myself (I'm disabled and struggle with a kettle of water etc) i find it too heavy and often have little to no energy to try and do this safely. I would love to not have to rely on my husband for a cup of coffee.

I mostly only drink very run of the mill coffee with oatmilk. and i do like an iced coffee (never made one, but buy from the shops) please don't shoot me, I may become more into coffee if it's easier for me to access!

I'm based in the UK (not sure if models are different) 

please could anyone advise which model is the easiest to use? in terms of levers, buttons, cleaning etc

I appreciate this is an odd question, but I've seen that many of you have several models, so thought you may be able to compare them for me.

any advice will be much appreciated

I lay in bed and stare up at the ceiling counting the little popcorn bumps. I groan as I check the time on my twin bell alarm clock. ""Fuck... Work starts in an hour."" I was honestly hoping I could wake up a little earlier so I could get some food in me before I went to work, maybe watch some YouTube. But I settled on scrolling through Instagram reels instead. Scrolling endlessly with mind numbing swiftness, dreading having to pull myself out of bed and get ready. A pling notified me from my manager of the address we would be cleaning that day. ""Fuck it!"" I said as I threw my phone to the far end of my mattress. I got up, brushed my teeth and jumped in the shower. Throwing on some old dirty jeans from the past 5 days in a row and a black t shirt with holes around the bottom. A quick look in the mirror and ruffling my brown hair and a stupid smile ""you're a wreck"" I thought. I walk out of my laundry covered room and grab my keys off the kitchen table.

I pulled up to the address and saw my coworker John getting all the cleaning supplies out of the back of the van.

""John Manager, what's up man."" As I walked up to him. 

""Shut up Will."" He scoffed to himself 

John was a no bulshit kind of guy, grizzled maybe in his early 40's I wouldn't bother asking. He was good company, had his jokes and dry humor. All I cared about was that he was a good manager and coworker. He actually got his hands dirty when you needed him and jumped onto any situation to give you tips. Not in a know it all douchey way either, He's a good dude is my point.

""why don't you help me get the hazmat suits out of the truck."" He groaned as he put a massive bucket of bleach onto the concrete.

""Got you, so what's going on up in the apartment? Any word on what we are walking into?"" I said as I rummaged through the van.

""I'm not too sure, all I heard was something happened with the guys teeth and he croaked about a week ago. No one heard from him and they called in a wellness check. Sure enough we are here, so yeah.... Hes dead"" he said with a kind of stare off into the distance and hands on his sides.

""Oh word? He's not alive and breathing? I thought we were here to say hi. Maybe give him a kiss on the cheek or something.""  I said dumbfounded

""Yeah you can go give the cadaver a kiss on the cheek if you want."" John said laughing 

""So where the hell is Arin...it's 10:30... Dude is seriously late every fucking day."" I said noticeably annoyed I threw the 3 hazmat suits onto the pavement next to the bleach.

""Yeah I know he is, he sent me a text I guess his alarm went off late I don't know. I just saw his car pull in so whatever."" He said brushing it off.

""NOT WHATEVER! FUCK THAT DUDE! John, I bust my ass to get here on time every day and that scrawny fuck is always late!!!"" I said throwing my hands up

Arin walked up to the van with his big Osiris shoes and an oversized tap out shirt way too big for his skinny frame. Tall, goofy greasy hair. His breath always smelled like he rolled out of bed and ran out of the door. I Hate this guy. Who the fuck wears tap out shirts and Osiris shoes in 2025. I'm not even sure they make them anymore.

""You guys started unpacking already?"" Arin said with fake concern in his voice clearly trying to cover his ass.

""Uh yuh we did. We started at 10."" I said as I walked by him to grab the respirators out of the van. 

""Arin grab the brooms and mops and get it ready to go up to the apartment and hurry up, I don't feel like being here all night. And before you give me some dumb excuse just get your suit on man. This is your 3rd last warning, you're late again and I'm kicking your ass to the curb."" John said with a stern tone.

""Alright alright...I'm sorry I just was on my way here an-"" John cut off Arin

""I just said I don't give a shit! Do what I asked please."" John said with anger.

All while this was happening I couldn't help but notice the lack of cars in the parking lot. It's late at night on a Tuesday. Shouldn't there be more people here? Probably why no one to noticed the smell, No one lives here.

We got all suited up, big yellow hazmat suits, respirators and goggles. Dressed to the nines ready for whatever it is we were going into. 

We had to walk up 5 flights of stairs just to get to the fucking apartment. For some reason they didn't have an elevator in this place. How the hell do they even get furniture in these rooms. 

""So what's the room number?"" Arin asked

""565 is the room, we're almost there."" John said winded from the stairs.

We finally got to the room. A coffee brown stain on the bottom of a white door that has seen much better days. The green paint on the trim of the door has begun chipping and falling off as if it were dripping some rank ichor onto the dark grey carpet of the hallway. Little did any of us know at the time. This rot was a sign of the corruption that seeped out from within that horrible room. A sign of the foreboding madness that lay waiting within.

""So uh who wants to do the honors and open the door?"" John asked Arin and I in a bouncy tone. He's clearly been doing this much longer than us.

""I got it."" I said with my chin to my chest and hand in the air.

As I put my hand on the door knob I couldn't help but feel a creeping sense of anxiety. Not exactly full blown panic or anything, but the feeling in my gut that whatever it is we were going to walk in on was something that should not be mettled with. Not in the sense of gore, but something completely off. Something macabre that should be left well alone... As I turned the door knob a small voice ever so soft was screaming at me to quit that job right then and there and up and leave. I could deal with John later I'm a good worker, Im sure he would understand. But I gritted my teeth and opened the door. A rush of air flooded into the stale dark apartment. Even through the respirator I could smell the all too familiar coppery scent of blood. I sat their for a second, and I couldn't put my finger on why. I've done multiple jobs before this, seen horrible things. So why does this one job in a random apartment complex feel like something so wrong. I huffed to myself and let out a small ""okay."" And heaved the door all the way open as if I had to push it through some sort of viscious fluid. I'm

The door let out a small creak and a smack. As it hit the wall. I saw nothing, it was too dark in the apartment. So I stepped my right boot in and reached my arm onto the wall. Desperately reaching out for some sort of switch, finally my hand caught leverage. I flipped the light on and the scene before me was something I could never have imagined.

As the lights came on, John, Arin and I were absolutely taken back. The only person to utter any form of opinion or word about what laid before us was John a quick short simple ""woah."" Is all he said.

The room laid out, a simple small 2 bedroom apartment. Living room, kitchen and bedroom were right in front of us and to the right was a small bathroom. In the corners of the room crimson erupted up from the baseboard just out of grasp of the ceiling in all four corners. Crumpled pages laid sprawled out in a random incoherent order all around the room. The couch laid in 2 pieces split down the middle as if someone too heavy sat right in the center. The bed displayed signs of ensanguination, the mattress soaking up the hemmorage like a giant sponge. Writings all over the wall, the only decernable message in some desperate manner was a name or a word? 

""Vrag Gnasth?"" I said aloud in a questioning manner.

""What the hell does that mean."" Arin said puzzled

At the center of all of laid a rotting mass of meat and rotting teeth. Laying in front of it all, a small brown journal with an almost vine looking design on the cover. 

""What the fuck."" I said in disbelief

Arin stands there saying nothing. A man of few words and even fewer thoughts. Fucking hate that guy.

""Well let's get to it! I said it earlier and I'll say it again. I don't want to be here all night. I got a date with a 30 rack at 6am and you can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning."" John said and smacked his hands together with a loud clap and bounced forward into the gore with a mop and bucket. Old blood sticking to the wheels of the bucket as he pushes it into the room.

Shaking his head Arin followed behind. 

After a solid 2-3 hours of cleaning and scrubbing and ripping up the carpets.

I picked up the brown journal that was now tossed to the side, in a pile of dreams put to an end too early.  I flipped through the pages, It looked fairly normal with random dates and entries almost like a diary.

""Hey John, so what are we gonna do with all this uh.."" I looked down at the pile of rotting carrion ""..this...guys things?""

""I was told to throw it all away, the guy didn't have any family."" John said packing the mans clothes into a garbage bag.

I figured I would keep it for myself and read it later. I don't know why I had the urge to take it for myself, but I had this itch in my brain I couldn't scratch and at that moment taking the journal felt like it would help.

Me and Arin stood in front of the van fully packed with bags full of torn up carpet and various fluids. I pulled down the hood of my suit and lifted off the respirator taking in the biggest suck of fresh air iv had in the past 5 hours. Whiping the sweat off my forehead I turn to John who was walking out of the apartment complex.

""Is that the last of it?"" I said with a huff catching my breathe from the 5 flights of stairs. ""My legs feel like fucking jello."" I whined into the air twords no one. 

""They seriously need to put an elevator in there or something."" Said Arin holding his lower back

""Yup, that's most of it. The morning crew will come in and finish up in about 3 hours, so we should be set to go home."" John said with a satisfied smile.

""I'm beat, see you guys later."" Arin said as he turned around to walk to his car.

""Wait up man."" I said to him in an annoyed tone ""John is there anything else you need from us? Are we good?"" I said with a thumbs up 

John gave us a hearty thumbs up and sent us on our way. I turned around and bolted twords my car I couldn't get there fast enough, I needed a shower and bad. Arin said bye to me but I scoffed and got into my car. Fuck that guy. Dude seriously sucks.

After a long drive of depersonalizing and listening to the radio. I finally came too as I pulled into my drive way. I didn't have much, just a nice little 1 story home I rented out with the money I made from the job. I walked in and threw my keys on the kitchen table and tossed the odd journal beside it.

After washing blood from my ears and the little bits of whatever the hell that got in through the hood. I dried off my hair and plopped into bed. The sun was rising at this point.

Thinking back on that job, why didn't any of us even question what the hell we walked in on. The dude was reduced to a pile of meat. Not to mention the rotted teeth that were thrown into the mess, it doesn't make any sense. It was just needlessly violent for no reason. Most of the scenes, even murders aren't like that. like yeah it's gross but it's someone laying in bed or on the floor, maybe some blood here and there in the carpet or on the walls. Not a pile of organs and bone and a cascade of blood all throughout the apartment. 

I decided I'd do a little research online to see what had happened to the guy. I didn't find much, just a name and a obituary. The guy really didn't have any family, his name was Daniel Cline. I guess he was married at one point but had a nasty divorce.

Obviously I wouldn't find anything on him if there really was something odd going on... It's not like I'm some CIA agent, all I have is Google. But at the crime scene there were pages almost laid out on the floor in a manner like he was studying something. Not to mention that another language written on the wall in blood, Vrag Gnasth. 

""Vrag Gnasth, that doesn't even make any sense."" I said allowed questioning it once again. 

So I tried googling that and nothing came up only that typical ""your search query couldn't find existing documents.""

""Whatever"" I thought.

I decided I'd get some sleep so maybe I could actually wake up at a normal time to get some stuff done before everything closed. 

I awoke to the sound of grinding. Almost like a squeeking sound. Like glass scouring together, violently. The sound itself gave me a visceral reaction. I could feel a chill down to the core of my bones. My eyes shot open almost in a panic. I looked around my room and nothing still alone as always. 

I took a peek at the time, it was 10pm What the hell? I fell asleep at 8am. You're telling me I slept for 15 hours. Probably from all the hard work I did going up and down those stairs.

 I decided I'd check my phone to see if John messaged me about a new job, Im normally on call at random times during the week. This was one of those times, but nope no texts or calls. Guess no one's died recently.. or found at least. While checking my phone I couldn't help but notice a slight pain in my jaw. That same aching feeling I got when my wisdom teeth were pulled when I was 17. Sore, aching?  

""Ow"" I said to myself rubbing my jaw. 

I groaned as I opened and wiggle my mouth around in an attempt to maybe stretch out the pain. No dice, it was still there.  

Shaking it off, I rolled out of bed and threw on some old shirt after giving it the sniff test, I decided it would be a pretty boring night considering it was late. Only thing open right now is the gas station down the street so I guess I'm not getting groceries. I plopped my happy ass down on the couch in my living room rubbing my aching legs and grabbing the remote. Figured I'd throw on some creep cast or something on YouTube, catch up on some old stories. 

While watching them talk about some goofy my little pony story I started hearing that grinding noise again. So I paused the video, looking around the room listening trying to pin point the exact source of this noise just so I could stop it. It was horrible! No matter where I looked it sounded like it was right on top of me. I figured maybe it was something outside. So I opened my window and nothing, there's absolutely no one out there and why would there be? . I threw my head in my hands. And that's when I noticed it, it was me. I was the source of the excruciating noise. I have been grinding my teeth this whole time! As soon as I caught it, it stopped. And soon after the pain I felt this morning returned. 

""What the fuck"" I said rubbing my jaw. 

""Maybe it's all the stress from work getting to me?"" I'm pretty sure stress can do weird things like that right? Maybe I just need some beer, take the edge off. That gas station down the road might actually come in handy after all.

I flung open the door to the easy fill and heard a loud chime of the bell above the door. At the counter was an overweight man with glasses and a unkempt beard. Looked like he couldn't be fucked to be here. He was sitting at the counter with his arms wrapped around his chest and his chin down staring at his little phone. ""Probably a discord mod."" I thought to myself and laughed.

I made my way to the back and grabbed a 6 pack of Bush. Didn't like the stuff that much but it's what I could find that wasn't shitty. I brought it up to the counter.

""How ya doin."" I said making small talk with the man

""Ohhh you know...just another day in paradise. Been looking for the girl of my dreams back here on my phone."" He said with a snark laugh

""Oh yeah?"" I laughed nerviously 

Oh God one of these. I thought to myself

""That'll be 8.95$ sir."" He said with hot breath

I gave him the cash.

""Looks like you got your wisdom teeth pulled recently. Your cheeks are puffed up, I wouldn't be drinking beer like this if I were you. You know, it can actually unclott the blood and give you dry socket."" He said while he was giving me my change.

""What?"" I felt the back of my jaw and sure enough it was swollen like a gumball.

I took my change and quickly left the gas station.

As I sat in my car I hurriedly pull down the sun shield and looked into the mirror. Holy shit I look like I got hit by a baseball bat. I drove home rubbing my face and racking my brain thinking about what I could have done to start this? I mean maybe grinding my teeth? But really that vigorously and not noticing while I did it?! What the hell.

As I sat back down on the couch I cracked open one of the beers and took a sip. The cold beer on the back of my gums felt nice. The alcohol helped too and the pain soon subsided, as I watched YouTube I felt myself finally relaxing. No more pain in my face and no more pain in my legs fucking finally I thought. After finishing the 6 pack of Bush I soon fell asleep on the couch with my TV on. 

While I slept I drempt of a dark void with a crimson glow. I was standing there that much I knew. I could feel my body but not see anything. I tried to look at my hands but nothing was there. I felt the increasing panic rise in my chest and my breathe quicken. It felt as though I had masses and bumps under my skin, wriggling and moving. The foreign objects, I could feel them pushing against one another begging for more room inside my arms. All I hear is the same grinding sound but this time it is accompanied by a wet sloshing smacking sound. Like meat in a grinder that is far too dull to get the job done without violent force. The noise rose slowly in volume. Getting louder and louder. I desperately looked around for something, anything. Any sort of light. Something to grace my eyes with an explanation or some sort of false comfort. There was nothing but the sound ""Gnasstthhh Gnasssshhhthhh Gnassssttthhhh"" louder and louder

It felt like I was stuck in this void for hours. I could feel my palms pressed against my ears but nothing stopped this noise from assaulting my ear drums ""GNASTHSH GNASHTHHH GNASSSSHHHHTTTHHHH"" I finally awoke in a panicked sweat. 

 

""WHAT THE FUCK!"" I yelled to myself.

I franticly rubbed my arms and legs to check if I was infact okay. There was nothing, it was a dream. I knew that but I couldn't stop myself.  The pain in my face has returned and is definetly not ignorable. I rushed to the bathroom to look in the mirror. Prying my mouth open and cheek to the side. In the back of my mouth, my wisdom teeth were growing back in. 

Blood soaked the bottom of the tooth already half way erupting from my gums. Top and bottom wisdom teeth are growing back at an alarming pace. I poked them, they were real but they weren't nearly as secure as the rest of my teeth. They grew as if there was nothing below to anker them into my mouth. I poked and prodded and moved them with my fingers. Twisting and pushing the left molar. I pulled my hand out of my mouth and steadied myself on the bathroom sink looking into the mirror. I don't want to but I think I have too. I smack my hands on the edge of the sink, open my mouth and lean closer to the mirror with determination. I grabbed my left wisdom tooth and pulled. The pain was unimaginable.


 I yanked and the tooth gave way. As I pulled a thick stringy twine-like mass of veins laid below. I yelled at the top of my lungs as I pulled, blood pooled into the crevice underneath my tongue. I felt the warmth of blood filling my mouth. Screaming in pain gargling as it went down my throat. I didn't care, this wasn't right it shouldn't be growing back. It doesn't make any sense. Finally with a swift ""plenk"" the tooth came out. Leaving a small hole with flesh in its place, oozing yellow and white fluid. My effort wasn't unrewarded though, the pain had begun to fade in the left side of my face.


I breathed heavily spitting the blood and infection into the sink. Taking a deep sip of water I swished it around and spit. Finally as I calmed myself, I took a good look at the tooth. There was a full crown on the top but the sides were ripe with decay. It smelled like rot. Underneath laid a dark red ball of tissue. I tossed it to the side of my bathroom counter. ""What the fuck is going on."" I could feel tears welling in my eyes. Why the hell don't I have health insurance. I cursed myself on top of all the bulshit that was happening. With my head in my arms draped over the bathroom sink I wept. 


I grabbed the tooth and returned to my couch, plopping myself back down defeated with the pain I still felt in the rest of my face. I wanted it to stop but if it meant going through what I just did again and again I don't think I could do it. I stared at this alien object I extracted from my maw. 


""It just doesn't make any fucking sense."" I sighed.


Googling ""can wisdom teeth regrow in face"" didn't yield any information because surprise no they fucking don't. So now I'm sitting here in pain wondering what the hell is even happening to me. Laying down on my couch defeated and staring at the ceiling. The silence didn't last long though. It starts up again, the grinding of my teeth. Rubbing vigorously and with force hard enough to shatter my teeth, I was waiting for them to shatter through one another into the gums above and below. But that isn't happening. Over and over I open my mouth smack it back down and grind my teeth hard. I scream in pain but it comes out as muffled yelp from my mouth being forced shut. I panic, I don't know what to do. I don't have control over my own jaw. The only thing I can think to do in my altered state is punch myself as hard as I can in the mouth. Doing so lodges two rotted teeth into my knuckles. 


""OKAY I GOTTA GET HELP"" I say allowed 


I quickly rummage for my phone, it must have fallen into the cracks during the struggle with my over active jaw. I try to stick my hand in between the cushions but the teeth that are stuck in my left hand dig further into my tendons. That's when I noticed it. 


""I hit myself with my right fist, how the hell did-"" I say puzzled


I pull my hand from the couch and hold it out in front of my face inspecting every inch of my hand. 2 rotted teeth are peeking out from the back of my hand, 3 are growing from under my finger nails 2 under my thumb and 1 under my pinky. I yell in panic as I notice they're slowly growing ripping and tearing apart my nails grasp from my finger. 


""What do I do! WHAT DO I D-"" I begin to cough and choke as my throat begins to become blocked. I feel my face begin to turn red and the pressure growing in my visage. I look down and begin to see bumps begin to form under my skin along my arms. I raise my shirt and see the same. Blood begins to pour out of each hole. Growing and growing, heavier and heavier I feel my feet begin to press into the carpet below me. All at once I feel as though I will erupt, pop like a zit filled with calcium. My vision begins to fade to black. I'm begging and pleading inside myself for this to stop. As it begins to crescendo feel my body stretch and finally collapse into itself. A wave of blood erupts from me like a volcano. Shooting in every single direction in my little home. There I lay, a pile of what I once was. Gone.


""Hey Arin, we got another clean up job. I'll send you over the address. When you see it just let me know if you'll be alright doing it with me. I know it might be tough."" John said over the phone in a somber tone.


""Sounds good"" I say as I hang up the phone.


My phone beeps with a notification. When I check it, I notice it's my friend Wills address. Oh shit... I guess that explains why he hasn't shown up to work in a couple of days. 


As I walk up to the familiar home I've only seen dropping off my co-worker will when his car was broken down. I see John already suited up and ready. 


""We started at 10 right John?"" I said concerned.


""Yeah we did, you're on time. Guess I'm just antsy to get this clean up done. Will didn't deserve this..."" John said sadly


""Yeah he didn't..."" I said with my hands in my pockets and a sigh.


When me and John finished up our portion of the clean up I noticed that same journal that we saw at the other job on Wills table. I thought that was odd, so I decided to open it up and take a look at what was written in there. Sure enough the first couple pages were just day to day stuff. Boring days at the office, something about a bad divorce with this guy's wife cheating. 


""There's that weird thing again Varg Gnasth"" I said aloud to myself.


But then I flipped towards the back and noticed a page with something real weird scribbled on it over and over. It looked like it was written in a hurry almost like someone was panicking. All it was over and over was ""don't say his name""

RIP. I am not really a coffee snob, I will drink gas station coffee and diner coffee no problem. I am a junky who needs a fix.

Years ago I had looked into Nespresso because I love cappuccinos. But I wasn't really happy to be using disposable pods and creating that much trash, when I could just get by with drip coffee. But when my dark water maker died, I was excited to see that Nespresso recycles your pods for free. 

Now I know you can't beat $20 machine + $0.25 per cup or pot depending on the brand. But I want to see what is the most reasonable approach to the new system.

Here's the deal. I want the cheapest reliable machine. Machine + pods + starter bundle type a deal. I don't want to regret my purchase. Features I want: cappuccino, coffee. Anything else probably won't be used. I know that a cappuccino requires frothed milk. I have a Bodum frother that is kind of a pain to clean, but it works. If there is a better way, let me know. I also know the original line doesn't do 'coffee' but Americano is fine if it can spit out some hot water to go with.

A couple of notes, I don't like fruity/flavored coffees really. Anything that starts to get acidic or artificial tasting ruins it for me. I am more of a darkest smokiest coffee person, I do enjoy light roasts sometimes though.

1. Original or Vertuo if cost per cup matters?

2. Best entry machine that lasts?

3. Are the bundles worth it or buy machine + pods separately?

4. Any first order discounts I can stack?

1r0eszz,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestructiveReaders/comments/1r0eszz/critique_my_flash_autofiction_1125/,Critique my Flash Autofiction [1125],"I sit on the kitchen counters. They aren’t secure to the wall yet, so they wobble every time I move. I pretend to like the German beer I sip. A Grüner Bier, I think it’s called. At this point, I’ll drink anything.

I watch him as he balances on a step ladder, reaching over the fridge to paint the kitchen wall. He covers the blotchy dark green paint with another, only slightly darker green. He attempts to sing along to the techno that’s blaring, and I laugh at this silently. “This is back from when I was a wee boy. You can tell everyone did a lot of drugs back then.” I nod behind his back. They must have—to listen to this without their eardrums cringing the way mine are. I tap my foot along anyway. It’s dark outside, despite being barely fifteen minutes past six.

We’ve decided to paint the wall for something to do instead of scrolling Netflix. The thought of another night on the sofa, half-watching another time-wasting documentary or cringe-worthy horror made my skin itch. I’d had to peel my back off that black leather. The celebrity faces on the 55-inch had begun to feel too familiar. I had to remind myself that Julia Roberts was an actress and not an old friend.

There was a time before the counters had even made it into the kitchen—they lingered in the hallway as a makeshift side table for a while. In those days, we would have headed to a bar in the evenings (and the days) to pass the time. A beer for him, a chardonnay for me— or whatever white wine was cheapest. I wasn’t fussy. I truly believe McDonalds make the best coffee, though I’d never admit this to him. He was more particular, and far more cultured. I’d watch him as he ordered for us, admiring the width of his shoulders, the strength of his profile.

He’d chat away to the bartender. He always knew them by name. Everywhere we went, he’d know the bartender. I’d always grow impatient—especially if they were a woman.

I’d find myself wandering outside to pace the shockingly clean pavements and smoke a Marlboro Gold. I’d call up my friends; they hadn’t heard from me in a while. They would ask me about my cross-country love affair. I told them I felt like Jane Birkin, and he was my Serge—old enough to know better, yet with a soul younger than mine. 

When I noticed him making his way back to the table, I quickly found an excuse to hang up and return to him. Briefly delayed by my search for a bin to throw my cigarette butt as I couldn’t bear to throw it on the ground.

Already seated, he watched me. “Here she is, fag ash Annie,” he’d quip, revealing his crowded teeth. I’d show him mine in return and shyly sniff the ends of my hair. The scent of the coconut shampoo I had lathered into my hair that morning had been replaced by that of an old ashtray. I’d wrinkle my nose and try to contain my smirk.

Our drinks would often empty too quickly—as though we were racing to the bottoms of our glasses. We’d exit one bar and stumble to another, searching for something. Maybe just a less sticky table. In a dim corner, we’d find one tucked away, propped up by beer mats. More and more drinks would arrive at the table before we had finished the last.

The music was too poppy, the crowds were too tight, the hipsters—too many. It was as though we were the only two people who understood how to do things right. I wondered if that’s why we had found each other. We’d laugh at our critiques, and in my vanity, I would worry about the concealer settling in the creases by my eyes and my smile. I’d slyly smooth it out when he looked away.

If only we walked home, the alcohol in our blood keeping us warm against the biting wind. If only we had slid into bed and fallen asleep with our contact lenses still in, drunk and hazy in each other’s arms. But things always went further. Drinks would turn into white lines on glass table tops. Then one bag would turn into two.

Sometimes—rarely—this ended well. In Prague, we’d spent hours in the hotel room with our tongues like sandpaper scraping in each other’s mouths.

The next morning, he ordered us French fries and wine for breakfast (both at my request). I sat with my head in my hands, looking for symbols in ketchup instead of tea leaves. He’d laugh at my hungover state with the Irish waiter. I still loved him.

But mostly, these nights ended in tears. I wished that like Jane, I had a custard tart to throw at him. Eyes that had once held longing now glazed over. With pupils the size of plates, we were no longer interested in seeing. I was no longer his lover. I was like the moth larvae we kept finding. On the ceiling, in the drawers. “I’ll just book you a flight home.” It would cost the same for our removal.

Like the moths, I would be difficult to get rid of. Amidst the drug-induced tension—my heartbeat ricocheting across my body, my palms soaked with sweat, no matter how many times I wiped them on the bedsheets—I knew I would not be getting on an earlier flight.

He knew this too. He still loved me. So instead we tried going for coffee: a cappuccino for him, a café-au-lait for me, both with more than a spoonful of sugar. We needed one vice. There were still too many hipsters. We tasted whatever cakes the café had to offer that day. He always picked two and encouraged me to eat more while I insisted I was too full. “You can’t let me get fat alone.” I admired the nude painting of a much larger lady placed ironically on the wall above us. “Are you sure you’d still love me if I looked like her?”

He suggested we go for walks. We walked around a beautiful lake full of bird-shaped pedal boats—pink for flamingoes and white for swans—then reaching a haunting tarmac stretch where Hitler held his rallies. I pretended to be interested in the history, but instead I was too focused on the feeling of bugs crawling over my skin under my clothes. I didn’t see any, but I couldn’t shake the feeling. I gripped his hand tighter and pulled us back to the lake.

We explored the castle walls, peering over them at the city below and pointing out places we recognised. “And there’s the Irish bar!” In the castle’s tunnel, a busker played classical guitar. The romantic sound echoed off the walls and I took a video on my iPhone to capture the moment. To my Instagram followers, I was living the dream. He gave me two euros and I dropped them in the busker’s guitar case.

We watched a man in a tracksuit, tattoos poking from under the collar, walking a Pomeranian. We concluded that it must belong to his girlfriend. I imagined what dog my boyfriend would walk. I know he wants a Belgian Malinois. I don’t want a Belgian Malinois.

Back home (his apartment), I idled on the counter while he made us ramen. The moths were gone now. We had vacuumed them up, scrubbed the surfaces with vinegar and threw away all the dry food. They didn’t return after that; the pungent and acidic drawers no longer a comfortable home. I was instructed to grind the Szechuan pepper for him in the pestle and mortar—my contribution to all his hard work. We relaxed: stomachs full and tongues numb. I enjoy role-playing domestic life, if it’s with him. I didn’t want to fight. And I didn’t want to watch TV. So now, we paint the kitchen",0,1770667326.0,DestructiveReaders,0,0.5,False
1r0esf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/focusedmen/comments/1r0esf0/what_every_mom_needs_to_hear_today_and_probably/,What every mom needs to hear today (and probably every day tbh),"Most moms are running on autopilot. They do everything for everyone. They carry the invisible mental load. They feel guilty for not doing more, even when they're already doing too much. This post is for the ones who need to be reminded that perfection is a trap. And that burnout is not a badge of honor.

This isn’t just another feel-good pep talk. It’s backed by research, books, podcast convos, and deep dives into what actually helps. If you're overwhelmed, exhausted, or just silently drowning, here’s what you need to know, and what can help.

**1. You’re not lazy, you’re depleted.**  
Most moms don’t need more “motivation” advice. They need real recovery. Dr. Pooja Lakshmin, psychiatrist and author of *Real Self-Care*, says what looks like laziness is often just nervous system overload. You’re not broken. You’re just out of fuel. And no, coffee won't fix it.

**2. The mental load is REAL.**  
A famous comic by Emma (titled *You Should’ve Asked*) went viral because every mom saw themselves in it. Managing appointments, noticing the groceries running low, tracking school emails, that’s unpaid labor. The American Sociological Review found women do significantly more of this invisible work, even in households that claim to ""share"" parenting.

**3. Your rest is productive.**  
The Nap Ministry, founded by Tricia Hersey, pushes back on grind culture with one radical idea: rest is resistance. Letting yourself lie down isn’t weak. It’s the foundation of clarity, patience, and decision-making. Your body is not a machine. And your worth is not in how much you do.

**4. You don’t have to love every moment.**  
The idea that “you should cherish every second” of motherhood is toxic. Research in *Frontiers in Psychology* found that unrealistic expectations of constant joy actually increase maternal depression. Real connection with your child comes from presence, not performative happiness.

**5. It takes a village, even if you don’t have one.**  
You’re not supposed to do it all alone. But modern society isolates parents. Seek small support systems: parent groups, even online forums, coworking childcare spaces. According to the Harvard Center on the Developing Child, having stable, responsive relationships (for both parent and child) is the #1 buffer against stress.

**6. You’re enough, even when you’re stretched thin.**  
Dr. Becky Kennedy (author of *Good Inside*) says kids don’t need perfect parents. They need “good-enough” parents, ones who mess up, repair, and keep showing up. You’re allowed to have bad days. You’re still worthy of love and trust.

No hacks today. Just truth and proof. You don’t need a glow-up. You need grace.

I have several more pounds that I've bought from them to try but I don't know what gives. I have roasted at least 75+ pounds of coffee up to about 3 years ago and I quit.

1r0eqcs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1r0eqcs/the_blue_of_her_eyes_disturbed_me/,The blue of her eyes disturbed me,"When I was 16, I lived with my mom and siblings in an apartment my grandmother owned at the back of her house, connected to a patio over 75 meters long. That patio was full of all kinds of plants and trees; it was like being in a garden. There were avocado and mango trees, orange trees, and other fruit trees, medicinal plants, and other beautiful plants. It was very beautiful. My grandmother, well-known in the neighborhood, was always giving away fruit or medicinal plants. It was normal to see people in that patio almost every day. One day, like any other, my mom left for work at 5:30 a.m., leaving me alone in the apartment with my younger sister, who was still asleep. I tidied the kitchen, and as usual, I was going to have coffee with my grandmother. As I was leaving the apartment, I noticed a short, thin woman, an elderly woman. Her clothes looked quite old-fashioned. I was curious about her hair and the comb she had in it, but the deep blue of her eyes disturbed me. They stared at me blankly. I smiled and waved uncomfortably.

I left in a hurry At my grandmother's house, just a few meters from the apartment, I heard her in the kitchen and went in immediately. I asked her, ""Grandma, who is that lady in the yard? I've never seen her here.""

My grandmother, surprised by my question, asked, ""Which lady?""

And I said, ""Yes, Grandma, there's a lady in the yard.""

My grandmother shook her head again and said, ""The gate is locked. No one can come in. I haven't heard from anyone.""

We immediately went together and checked the yard, and there was no one there. But I know what I saw. I knew I wasn't imagining anything. A week later, I went with my grandmother to visit a friend, and in the living room of that house, in a large old black and white photograph, was the same lady I had seen in the yard. I was shocked. It was my grandmother's friend's mother.",6,1770667187.0,Paranormal,1,1.0,False

I am 19, I have never smoked, drink alcohol rarely but I am a coffee addict and I have poor dental hygiene as you can see. This is partly my fault as I am only now noticing there's an issue to be fixed but I am here to learn. I am only recently trying to form the habit to brush twice a day because I admittedly usually only brush once every two days. I have never flossed as I was never taught nor told to do so before

But I also have a separate issue at hand, my teeth are very brittle as of late.

I broke both of my upper wisdom teeth in a month. I broke the first (last pic) clean off (like 3/4ths of visible teeth is gone) while I was swallowing pills and the other (3rd pic) didn't come off yet but as of today it's like half gone (some of the teeth I literally spat out today) but I had been feeling it loosening for a while. The first teeth was gonna get pulled because the decay from the side caused me pain a year prior and the filling had recently come off.

I had also broke like 1/4ths of my 5th front teeth by slightly pulling on it with my hand a month ago, this teeth was done a root canal a year or two prior.

Coincidentally as I was getting that teeth done, the teeth in the opposite side starting causing me pain which lead to my second root canal.The wisdom teeth situation happened after that.

With how much I neglected them, I get it if some my teeth rotted, what I don't understand is why now, simultaneously at that? I have always been like this but this is a recent development and it's so weird that I broke so many of my teeth so easily and I am concerned. I am probably going to ask the other wisdom teeth to be pulled as well but idk, thought I would ask here. How do I move forward from hereonout?

Btw, this as as much as my mouth opens, this also makes it hard to clean my wisdom teeth (which I wasn't aware I even had until less than a year ago)

I just celebrated a birthday and I find that around my birthday there’s a few friends who I used to be close with who I’ve since grown apart from and who seem to only come out of the woodwork to wish me happy birthday or to reminisce on old memories and then immediately fade back into oblivion. The moment I try to strike up a real conversation (e.g.; asking to get a coffee or speak on the phone sometime), they’re immediately gone again. And to clarify, I don’t mean friends who you speak to once a month or even once every few months (we are all adults with different priorities and jobs and families and I understand not speaking at all the time), but literally people who surface only once a year like Santa Claus. 

We never had a falling out, nothing ever really happened, we just grew apart and live very different lives. Absolutely no hard feelings and I wish them all the absolute best in life. So with that said, I just wonder … What’s the point? I don’t have social media so by default my circle tends to be “smaller” since I don’t really stay in touch with people superficially. But why reach out at all? It’s a nice gesture but it’s mostly baffling. I want to just straight up ask, but there’s no point seeming confrontational. And I don’t like the fake song and dance of having to seem grateful that you had a calendar reminder in your phone about my birthday.

Nothing too coffee-forward, we want that perfect balance of creamy mascarpone, light sponge, and just a subtle hint of espresso. Tried a supermarket one recently and, honestly, it was basically coffee in a pan 😅 Ideally, I’d like somewhere easy to reach from Orchard, Novena, or Toa Payoh, but I’m open to a short trip if it’s worth it. Budget is around $50–60. I’ve been eyeing a few spots like Gateau de Henry, Zeeka, and Breka, but I’d love to hear about hidden gems, small bakeries, or home-based bakers that really know their tiramisu. I even briefly considered Alibaba since some sellers offer tiramisu-style cakes or ingredients in bulk, but for a small reunion, sticking local feels safer and fresher. Has anyone had a whole tiramisu in Singapore that’s creamy, perfectly balanced, and enough to impress a small group? Any personal favorites or underrated bakeries would be a huge help.

Everyone here has a dog, a gym membership, and a vague plan they’re “working on.” Nobody ever says what the plan is. They just say “yeah, it’s going well” like they’ve rehearsed it. Sometimes I wonder if Dallas is where unfinished people go to wait. The houses are too big for the lives happening inside them. The lights stay on. Nobody comes out.

I’ll walk through Target and feel like I’m being softly guided by the aisles. Like the city learned how to arrange itself into places you don’t question. Every parking garage feels the same. Every coffee shop smells the same. Even the trees feel planted at intervals that mean something I don’t understand.

I’m not paranoid. I’m observant. There’s a difference. I just think it’s strange that the sky is this wide and nobody talks about it.

My whole life my mom has had inappropriate boundaries with my sisters and I. Constantly blurring the line between friend and parent, over sharing her relationship with our dad, and being emotionally manipulative. She loves and does so much for us, but uses those good deeds against us whenever a boundary is placed or communicated. 

For example, the other day I had coffee with a friend of mine and she knew. She texted me and said “maybe sometime I can join you”. Fully serious. I love her but girl.. you are 40 years older than me. She has friends of her own and is retired. She needs much more to do than be focused on my sisters and I. We’ve all suggested getting a part time job, volunteering somewhere, picking up more hobbies. My parents are still married and retired and they are financially comfortable. With all the advice and suggestions in the world she is stagnant and doesn’t listen to boundaries. 

My oldest sister has set the most boundaries. She is firm in what she will discuss and if she’s not comfortable my parents don’t get to see her. It’s also important to note my parents, oldest sister and her husband, and myself, all live within 15 min of one another. Middle sister lives across the state almost 3 hr away. Oldest sister shares what she pleases with them, but my parents continually talk shit about her behind her back and say she never calls them, never sees them, says she has an attitude. It’s hard to hear and sticking up for her makes me guilty. 

Middle sister and I still share location with our parents. Idk why my sister does, she’s married and across the state with her own money and job and she’s fine. I want to stop sharing location but I feel my hands are tied. I live in my own place but I do owe my parents some money, they lended me a few K last year for a car repair. I feel obligated to share location because of that. I could pay them back, but it’d be so tight doing that instead of just paying them off every month the way I am now. 

My man lives like 45 min from me, on a good day. So for example, she’ll see I’m at his house and I stay there for a couple days. She’ll continue to calll

 and text me, asking “do you even live in your own place anymore?” Get upset when I don’t answer. Sorry id rather be present in my life than stuck on my phone talking to you? 

She is impossible to deal with. You set boundaries and you’re a disgrace to the family, you don’t answer and you don’t care. I love my parents and would like a relationship with them. My dad is one of my best friends and truthfully I don’t mind sharing my location with him he doesn’t even care, but my mom man. I love her but she just doesn’t accept boundaries. She is a good person but she is always telling me I’m the only daughter she can rely on, because I see her the most out of my siblings and talk to her the most. I do want a relationship with her, but she doesn’t understand I also need to be left alone and not tracked. 

Ive tried tiring off my location before and it was a shit show. Constant calls and texts from her asking me to fix it, and getting my dad involved like hey your mom asked me to ask you about your location. I just can’t do it. ",1,1770666774.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

Laptops everywhere, phones charging, quiet background noise. I got there early, found a small table near the wall, and plugged my phone into the only outlet nearby. I was there first. That’s important.

I ordered my coffee, sat down, and started working. My phone was almost dead, so I really needed the charge. About twenty minutes later, a stranger sat at the table next to mine. No interaction, no eye contact, nothing. I didn’t think much of it. A few minutes after that, my phone buzzed and I saw the charging symbol disappear. I looked down and realized my charger was unplugged. In its place was the stranger’s charger.

I honestly thought it was a mistake. So I said hey, I think you unplugged my phone. They didn’t even look embarrassed. They said yeah, I needed the outlet. I told them I was already using it. They shrugged and said there aren’t any other outlets. That annoyed me.

I said I understand, but you can’t just unplug someone else without asking. They rolled their eyes and went back to their laptop. So I unplugged their charger and plugged mine back in. I didn’t yell. I didn’t touch their stuff beyond the plug. I just reversed what they did. That’s when they lost it.

They said wow, that’s incredibly selfish. I was using that. I said no, I was using it first. They started talking louder, saying people have no manners anymore and that I could’ve shared. Other people started looking over.

I told them if they had asked, we could’ve figured something out. But unplugging my phone without saying anything wasn’t okay.  They said I was power tripping over an outlet and that it was public property.

Eventually, they packed up angrily and moved tables, muttering about rude people. 

Still, the interaction stuck with me. I didn’t start it. I didn’t escalate it first. I just refused to let someone take something I was already using.

For example, most laymen rest assured, assuming that since they’ve never met a witch doctor, such a personage couldn’t possibly possess an item personal enough to that layman—hair, toenail, Band-Aid, or whatever—to permit any hexes against them. But in fact, the very best voodoo dolls are produced from self-portraits, a person’s self-image filtered through whatever illustrative skill they possess. 

 

Unfortunately for Bradley Clarke, he learned of that voodoo secret from a haggish Starbucks patron, who took offense when he opted not to sign her outthrust comic book—*The Unspooling* issue eight—which he’d written and illustrated some years prior. In Bradley’s defense, the woman had clumsily bumped his table and toppled his cappuccino, and he was frantically napkin-dabbing his slacks when the comic materialized from the depths of her Burberry backpack. 

 

“I’m a fan of your work,” the woman assured him. Still, he waved her away. He’d been getting recognized often lately; it was annoying. 

 

“Get lost, you old bitch,” he grunted, taking no small measure of joy as he watched her face crumple into a downcast expression, one incongruous with the psychedelic shawl that she wore.

 

Through her tears and livid shaking, the old gal muttered, “No, no, you shouldn’t have. You shouldn’t…you shouldn’t have done it.”

 

“Your parents shouldn’t have spawned you, so go find a bridge to live under,” Bradley countered. “That’s right, I just called you a troll. What can *you* do about it? As a matter of fact, were it up to me, people like you wouldn’t be allowed to read my comics in the first place.”      

 

“People like me? *People like me?* You dare insult hoodooists?”

 

“Hoodooists? Is that what inbred hags call themselves nowadays?” 

 

“Inbred? *Inbred!* What the heck is your problem? I approached you politely, humbly requesting an autograph, and you went and treated me like week-old, diseased spittle. Someone…*somebody* needs to teach you a lesson!” 

 

“Lesson, huh? Talk about lessons after you graduate from kindergarten, ya empty-headed spastic. They should stick you on an island—or better yet, under one.” *Wow, I’m really laying into her, aren’t I?* Bradley thought, delighted. *What’s gotten into me today? Surely, spilled coffee alone can’t shape me into someone this sinister? Have I forgotten something I should be pissed-off about?*     

 

Seemingly shrinking two inches, the elderly lady flung her entire physicality into a quivering tirade, a finger-waving string of invectives. Mangling much conjugation, interspersing four-letter nastiness every five words or so, she explained that thing about voodoo (you know, from this story’s first paragraph).

 

“I have your self portrait!” she added. “You’re sure in for it, buddy!” To better illustrate her assertion, she opened Bradley’s comic and pointed out its protagonist in a succession of images. Bradley hadn’t just been *The Unspooling*’s creator, you see, he’d also been its star, having written the tale about his experiences as he wrote the tale. It was one of those meta sort of pieces, that certain types of people relate to. 

 

Unfortunately for Bradley, those kinds of fans didn’t mesh well with him in public. Frankly, most looked as if they were about to sneeze on him—and sometimes did, for that matter. Often, they’d demand to take a photo with Bradley, even though he hated to be photographed, due to that wart on his cheek that resembled a nipple. Never were they voluptuous groupies, or even related to any.        

 

“Come on, lady,” groaned Bradley. “We both know that voodoo’s not real. You’re only degrading that issue’s value…when it was Very Fine to begin with, tops.”  

 

“I’m gonna curse you, boy! Curse you bad! A real bad curse! Then I’m gonna tell my online hoodooist group all about it! Best believe!”

 

“Online hoodooist group? *Online hoodooist group!* Lady, I thought those Sarah McLachlan animal cruelty videos were the saddest thing I ever saw. Then you came into my life. I tell ya, my soul weeps.” 

 

“Soul?” she yelped. “Soul, sir…your soul is, is…is curdled. In fact, say goodbye to your soul. It’s…muh-muh-mine.” 

 

*Yeah, she looks like she’s gonna sneeze, alright*, Bradley thought.

 

“Mine!” the woman shrieked, before thundering right out of the Starbucks. 

 

“Hers,” Bradley laughed, making his way to the counter to attain a coffee to go. He decided to throw away his slacks the very instant he got home, to better help him forget the encounter.  

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Naturally, forgetting the encounter wasn’t the coffee spiller’s intention. Matilda Grieves was her name. Fuming was her mentality, inundated by recollections of past insults, the sort that had shaped her into a hoodooist to begin with. 

 

Powering on her MacBook, she announced, “I’ll show him, yes, yes. I’ll make every second of every minute of his every day agonized. *The Unspooling* fooled me good. I actually thought Bradley-\*asshole-\*Clarke to be a kindred spirit. Never again, I say. Never, never. That snobby jerk thinks he’s so great. Well, I’ll show him, yes I will.” 

 

With her laptop’s built-in webcam, Matilda recorded a simple how-to video, which she immediately uploaded to her hoodooist group’s website. In the video, she used scissors to cut out a front profile illustration of Bradley Clarke, from *The Unspooling*’s seventh issue, and then a back profile illustration, from *The Unspooling* issue four, of roughly equivalent dimensions. She then traced both onto canvas, cut it carefully, and sewed everything together, stuffed with yarn. Just as simple as that, Bradley had been reproduced in effigy. 

 

In closing, Matilda snarled at the webcam and exhorted, “This comic book bastard mocked us, my sisters. He thinks we’re pathetic, a buncha inbred hags playin’ make-believe. So let’s teach him a lesson—all of us, together, today. Make voodoo dolls of your own, and we’ll hit Mr. Clarke with enough hexes to leave his doomed, bastard head spinnin’.”

 

As dozens of her web chums placed same-day delivery orders, or busily bustled their way to comic book dealers, Matilda took her Bradley doll for a spin. 

 

First, she made the thing do the splits. 

 

And lo and behold, in another part of the city, Bradley found himself plummeting painfully upon his testicles, legs pointed eastward and westward. Shrieking, he rolled onto his side, only to find his left foot flying into his face, over and over. “What’s happening?” he wailed. 

 

“It worked, I can feel it,” Matilda declared, alone in her bedroom. Frankly, the power she felt coursing through her body aroused her sexually. Fantasizing about rubbing the doll against her erogenous zones, she became flush-faced, and had to remind herself that she absolutely hated Bradley Clarke. 

 

Palpitating, she decided to take an especially lengthy cold shower. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

There are voodoo secrets unknown even to most hoodooists. Prime amongst them is the effect that multiple voodoo dolls have on their subject. I mean, how many people are deemed so reprehensible that they garner drastic measures from not just one, but multiple hexers? That percentage is so infinitesimal, it was previously unheard of. 

 

While Matilda showered, the first of her confrères completed her own Bradley doll. The very moment that she finished sewing the thing together, an astounding process commenced. Seated in his kitchen with an icepack on his scrotum, Bradley felt himself being tugged by an invisible force. “Ahhhh!” he hollered, gritting what felt like too many teeth, assailed by a splitting headache. 

 

*I’m exchanging stature for breadth*, he thought, shrinking and widening. Arms sprouted from his neck. His genitals doubled, as did his legs. His vision temporarily dilated, as he fell off of his chair while remaining seated. 

 

Due to an inexplicable binary fission, there were now two Bradley Clarkes, each half the size and weight of the original. Even his clothing—jeans and an Indian Jewelry shirt, the one with the drippy lips—had doubled and shrunk, though the ice pack remained singular. 

 

“What the hell is this?” both Bradleys asked, synchronized. Then, suddenly, the floored Bradley was slapping his own face with alternating palms, whilst the other Bradley watched, quite perplexed. And even as that occurred, flesh began to stream from both his self-slapping and seated selves. Amalgamating, it formed a third Bradley—the same size as those two, who had shrunken. 

 

Reclining, the new Bradley slid up the wall, then back down to the floor, then right back up the wall, even as his flesh streamed to help form a fourth Bradley. 

 

And that’s how it continued. Bradleys contributed mass to new Bradleys. Ceaselessly shrinking, they endured every painful calamity those distant hoodooists saw fit to send over. One’s leg twisted so severely that bone shards poked out in three places; another found himself blinded as both his eyes imploded. A few danced without rhythm, or leapt far higher than they ought to have. Soon, the kitchen was filled with Bradleys, which was when the deaths began. 

 

One Bradley went up in flames; another endured a waterless drowning. Four strangulated themselves purple-faced. A Bradley spun his head off his shoulders while dancing a jig. Another was crumpled into a ball hardly recognizable as human. Replicated shrieks filled the residence, which might have reached the ears of 911-dialing neighbors, were any home from work at the time.  

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Matilda’s hoodooist network was far larger than one might suspect, and the ratio of live Bradleys to dead ones kept increasing. In fact, the process soon prompted the most clandestine of voodoo secrets to manifest. 

 

You see, when a voodoo doll’s subject is shrunken smaller than their effigy, they effectively become their voodoo doll’s doll. Unseen, true musculature blossoms within canvas. Eyes of glossy, illustrated paper become fully functional. Faux fingers flex as functioning digits. 

 

Ergo, even as the hoodooists contorted and mangled their respective dolls, cackling, they were unaware that such actions no longer affected any Bradley. Indeed, abandoning their physicality, each Bradley now bided his time as a spirit existing inside his own effigy. 

 

Each would wait until their hexer was vulnerable—sleeping, reading, or otherwise distracted—and then they’d enact their revenge. They’d gather knifes, razors, knitting needles, and other sharp implements, and assail hoodooist flesh with all proper animus. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

The original Bradley doll trudged toward a bathroom, wherein a showered Matilda was toweling herself dry. Awkwardly, he clutched a pair of scissors, which he’d discovered beneath her living room sofa. 

 

*I’ll give that old bitch her autograph after all*, he thought, grinning paper lips. *I’ll carve it in permanent, and see how she likes it.* ",1,1770666455.0,spooky_stories,0,1.0,False

1r0edsf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abilify_Aripiprazole/comments/1r0edsf/what_are_my_options_with_abilify/,What are my options with Abilify?,"Hi,

so a little backstory: i didn't had an easy childhood. In my late teens the trauma from then came back up, i got my thoughts running circles inside my head always about this trauma. At the same time i started to smoke weed and noticed that when i smoked i got a little break from those thoughts who were 24/7 running inside my head driving me crazy. That's the reason i got Abilify 10mg since then, to calm my thoughts. And just there the first 2-3 month i slept at least 18 hours a day because it made me such tired!

Now years later i'm no longer selfisolated, have a gf, moved out from home, even got family and a stable job! And still i take 10mg daily and got mostly tired from it. So i drink a lot of coffee daily to not fell asleep at work. So mostly 4 a day, sometimes 5, but it goes up to 8 coffee a day. And sometimes it's too much and it goes in the opposite direction, that i'm really hyperactive. Like REALLY! I'm so hyperactive and have soany ideas on my mind that i can't concentrate anymore, can't work and nothing. I have to do something but i'm simultanously blocked because it's just too much energy somehow. So i end up doing nothing which makes me nervouse, which makes me wanting more to do something, which blocks me more, which makes me even more nervouse and so on. This goes for some hours like that and after i'm tired again, like i feel empty, nearly vomiting from tiredness...

Talking with my psychiatrist seems to not work out. Like when i tell her i feel tired mostly she says that can't be, because Abilify is activating. Like yeah, either i'm mostly tired or too activated, not some sane way inbetween... She want's to either put the dosage up to 15mg or making a depot. I tried the 15mg but ended up laying around being able to do nothing anymore. So i reduced it by myself back to 10mg again. I told her on the last appointment i had. And a depot i really don't want to. Like i don't get spikes normally. I'm just tired all the time and get spikes after too much coffee i guess? But not always. Just every now and then. Like yesterday i could drink 8 coffees and still nearly fall asleep and today i could drink just 5 coffee and suddenly i'm such hyperactive. And i'm afraid of the depot because then i could perhaps be more tired for even a longer period. Like ChatGPT says it's not calculable/adjustable like if i got the depot it could be weeks of laying around or the opposite and being too hyperactive to do something. With the pills i can at least adjust it a bit and don't have to wait for weeks until it's back to normal again (and yeah, i know, don't trust everything chatgpt says, but this were also my thoughts before talking with chatgpt about it). So yeah.. What are my options now? Like going along as always, feeling tired, but making it (mostly) somehow over the day and getting those hyperavtive spikes every now and then, or putting the dosage up to 15 and just laying around again or getting a depot which is uncalculating at this point for me. Like chatgpt also says that decreasing the dosage to 7,5mg would be helpful for many people. Like they respond better to lower dosages than to higher ones. But i guess my psychiatrist wouldn't be ok with it? At least it seems like that... Or else some activating drug, like modafinil, that i don't feel tired the whole day, so i don't have to drink that much coffee which brings me sometimes to the opposite aka really hyperactive?

1r0edkz,https://youtu.be/h0b39yb0dqs,"Binary Acustics EP321 MEMS IEM, Written + Video review","Hi all, this is a quick review of the Binary Acoustics EP321 MEMS iem after living with it for quite a long time, (I got it since Mid December last year), and I have traveled overseas with it too.

full disclosure, Hifigo did sent me these for review, but they did not tell me what to say, this is just my own experience with it.

The big headline of this iem is of course the mems driver, but I really don't have any clue on the technical break down of the driver itself, all I know is that it is not like conventional dynamic driver or planar, where theres a membrane, magnet and a voice coil, if anything mems is closer to BA drivers, MEMS driver is a sort of solid state driver where the signal/electricity directly moves the ""diaphragm"" soo in theory it should be a quicker driver (take this with a grain of salt, im still not entirely sure how it works).

On to the most important bit, how does it sound?

it sounds good, very good, overall tonal balance is fairly neutral, there is a sub bass emphasis but it is done in a very clean and precise as the sub bass raise starts lower in frequency so it doesn't give you any extra sauce or warmth. This headphone's entire frequency response is more or less is doing what your source is providing it without much extra coloration. overall it have very simular frequency reponse as the ThieAudio Hype 4 MK2, only and there are only significant differences in the upper treble frequencies.

With the stock ear-tips it is a bit grainy to my ears, and with the Coffee tips it smooths out the graininess, however you don’t need coffee tips to achieve this effect, you can actually install the stock eartips farther down, since the major difference between coffee tip and stock tips is that coffee tips effectively shortens your ear canal since the coffee tips stick out less.

Accessories:

you get a nice carrying case, along with a host of replacement eartips, overall it is a simple accessory package.

Build and Comfort:

Great comfort, I’ve lived with it for 2 months, been commuting and flying with it. Build quality is solid the aluminum and resin combination feels nice. Of course the holographic faceplate makes this iem looks phenomenal.

And that’s should be it, if you have any question please leave a comment below and I’ll try my best to answer.

Here's Why the Fourth Trimester Broke Me (And How I'm Surviving),"*Week 6 postpartum. This morning I dropped the soap in the shower and just... stood there crying for 10 minutes.*



Not because of the soap. Because I'm so exhausted I can barely function. Because my body hurts. Because I haven't slept more than 2 hours straight in 6 weeks. Because this is SO much harder than anyone told me it would be.

If you're preparing for baby or in the thick of it right now, here's what I wish someone had been honest about:

THE HARD TRUTHS NOBODY TELLS YOU:

**1. The First Two Weeks Are Pure Survival**

You're bleeding heavily, everything hurts, you can't sit down properly, and you're trying to keep a tiny human alive while running on zero sleep.

I spent day 3 sobbing on the bathroom floor at 2 AM because I was terrified to poop. (They don't warn you about that part!)

What actually helped: Stool softener (start BEFORE birth!), adult diapers for the first week, and accepting that you're just surviving right now. That's enough.

**2. The Baby Blues Hit Like a Truck**

Day 4 I cried for 6 hours straight. About everything. About nothing. I felt guilty for not being happier. I felt overwhelmed. I questioned if I'd made a terrible mistake.

This is NORMAL. It's hormones. It usually passes by week 2.

But if it doesn't pass, or gets worse, that's PPD/PPA and you need to talk to someone. There's no shame in it.

What actually helped: Knowing it was temporary, talking to my partner honestly, not pretending I was fine, and getting outside for 10 minutes each day.

**3. Your Body Is Different Now (And That's Okay)**

I kept waiting to bounce back. Week 3, week 4, week 5... nothing.

Then I realized: my body doesn't need to bounce back. It grew a HUMAN. It's not supposed to be the same.

The stretch marks, the softer belly, the wider hips - that's what making life looks like.

What actually helped: Unfollowing Instagram accounts that made me feel bad, wearing clothes that actually fit, and giving myself grace.

**4. Nobody Bonds Instantly (Sometimes)**

I felt love for my baby, but that overwhelming I'd die for you feeling? Took me about 3 weeks to really feel it.

I felt SO guilty. Everyone talks about instant connection and I just felt... tired and overwhelmed.

Turns out this is way more common than people admit.

What actually helped: Giving myself permission to take time, skin-to-skin contact, and not comparing my journey to others.

**5. You'll Miss Your Old Life (And Feel Guilty About It)**

I miss sleeping in. I miss spontaneous plans. I miss my body being my own. I miss feeling like myself.

And then I feel terrible for feeling that way because I love my baby and wanted this.

Both things are true. You can love your baby AND grieve your old life.

What actually helped: Talking about it honestly, small moments of old me (shower, coffee, whatever), and knowing this phase is temporary.

WHAT'S ACTUALLY HELPING ME SURVIVE:

\- That postpartum station I set up (everything within reach is a LIFESAVER)

\- My huge water bottle with a straw

\- Accepting help without guilt

\- Lowering expectations to the floor

\- Getting outside for 10 minutes a day

\- Connecting with other moms online

\- Being honest about struggling

\- Reminding myself: this gets easier

\- The moments when baby looks at me and I remember why I'm doing this

WHAT I WISH I'D KNOWN:

It's okay to struggle. It's okay to not love every moment. It's okay to cry over dropped soap.

The fourth trimester is BRUTAL. And admitting that doesn't make you a bad mom.

You're not weak for finding it hard. You're human.

You're keeping a whole person alive while running on no sleep and recovering from major body trauma. That's INCREDIBLE even when it doesn't feel like it.

TO ANYONE IN IT RIGHT NOW:

You're not alone. So many of us are crying in showers, questioning everything, and barely holding it together.

And somehow, we're all still doing it. Our babies are fed, clothed, and alive. We're surviving.

That's enough. You're enough.

It gets easier. I'm starting to see tiny glimpses of that now at week 6.

Hang in there. We've got this. 💕

Where are you in your journey? What's your dropped soap moment been?

Let's be real with each other because the perfect Instagram version isn't helping anyone.

TL;DR: Fourth trimester is brutal - baby blues hit hard, bonding takes time, your body changed and that's okay, it's normal to miss your old life, and struggling doesn't make you a bad mom. You're not alone.

P.S. I share more honest postpartum experiences on my profile. Love connecting with moms who keep it real 💕",1,1770666389.0,postpartumprogress,4,0.57,False
1r0ece4,https://www.reddit.com/r/productreview/comments/1r0ece4/headway_app_review_2026_productivity_app_i_havent/,"Headway app review 2026 - ""productivity"" app I haven't deleted after a week","I usually roll my eyes at those ""read 500 books a day"" ads, but I’ve been using **Headway** for about three months now, and I figured I’d drop a review here for anyone on the fence.

Context: I have a busy schedule and realized I was spending all my ""dead time"" (commuting, waiting in line, etc.) scrolling through social media brain rot. I wanted something that felt like I was actually learning, but didn't require me to lug a kindle around.

Here is my honest breakdown of the good, the bad, and the features I actually use.

**The Core Experience** The main draw is obviously the book summaries. They are about 15 minutes long.

* **Quality:** They are actually pretty solid. They capture the ""meat"" of the book. I treat them as a filter—if the summary blows my mind, I buy the real book. If it’s just ""okay,"" I saved myself 8 hours of reading fluff.
* **Spaced Repetition:** This is a feature I didn't think I'd care about, but it’s cool. When you highlight a fact, it saves it as a flashcard. The app then uses a spaced repetition algorithm to quiz you on it later so you actually memorize it. Helpful for facts I want to drop in conversations later.

**The ""Unique"" Features (That actually kept me around)** Most summary apps are just text/audio, but Headway added some stuff recently that differentiates it:

1. **Shorts:** This is basically TikTok but for educational nonfiction. If I only have 2 minutes, I scroll these. It scratches that ""infinite scroll"" itch but you walk away learning about psychology or history instead of watching cat videos.
2. **Audiocasts:** These are longer than the standard summaries and dive deeper into specific topics. I listen to these on my longer drives when a 15-minute summary feels too short.
3. **Sounds:** This was a surprise. They have ambient audio tracks designed to help you focus or wind down. I’ve started using the ""wind down"" sounds before bed instead of looking at blue light.

**The Pros:**

* **Gamification:** The streaks and daily goals actually work on me. The UI is really clean (""inspiring design"" sounds cheesy, but it genuinely looks good).
* **Audio Quality:** The voiceovers are pleasant and don't sound like weird robots.
* **Microlearning:** It fits perfectly into a busy schedule. I can finish a ""session"" while drinking my morning coffee.

**The Cons:**

* **Depth:** Obviously, a 15-minute summary will never replace a full 400-page book. You lose the nuance.
* **Subscription:** It’s not the cheapest app out there (though I think it's worth it if you actually use it). 

**Verdict:** If you want to replace doomscrolling with something that makes you feel smarter, it’s a solid 8.5/10. It hasn't ""transformed my life"" overnight, but it has definitely transformed how I use my spare time.

That can mean worldbuilding for a D&D campaign, talking about art and storytelling, getting a little too interested in science or technology rabbit holes, or having a deep, good-faith conversation about philosophy, policies, or how people or society work.

I tend to update my views as I learn more. I’m more interested in understanding than winning arguments, and I’m comfortable letting people disagree without turning it into a debate. I value kindness, curiosity, and emotional intelligence far more than being “right.”

My humor is mostly dry and understated, with the occasional absurd tangent once I’m comfortable. I find it genuinely charming when people let themselves be a little embarrassing and joyful.

**How I show up**

I’m caring in practical ways: checking in, listening, helping think through problems, and doing small, thoughtful things to make someone’s day easier or brighter. I’m not naturally great at flirting or making the first move, but I’m working on it and appreciate patience and clarity.

A good day for me looks like tidying up in the morning, making or writing something creative, hosting or playing games with friends, cooking something comforting, and ending the night with a good show or movie. When I’m stressed, I recharge by reading, watching something fun, playing games, or talking things through with someone I trust.

**What I’m looking for**

Ideally, a serious relationship built on mutual care, communication, and making time for each other. I also enjoy making new friends along the way. Feeling thought of matters to me, even if it’s just a check-in message during the day.

First hangs I enjoy are low-pressure: a coffee and a walk, or a Discord call while playing something chill and talking about whatever’s on our minds. I love learning about what other people are passionate about, and I’m always happy to share what I know too.

If you like thoughtful conversations, gentle humor, creative nerdiness, and someone who believes people are generally good at heart, we’ll probably get along well.",1,1770666326.0,NerdDating,0,0.66,False

One moment, I was laughing with my friends at a diner in my hometown; the next, I was gone. Seventeen years old, caught between childhood and the life I thought I’d have, and suddenly, nowhere was home.

America was vast and indifferent. Streets stretched endlessly, filled with people who didn’t care that I was lost. Every corner felt the same, every face a stranger. Nights were the hardest. I would curl up in empty parks or abandoned benches, listening to the hum of a city that had no idea I existed. I whispered into the darkness, asking if anyone had noticed, if anyone was looking for me, and silence answered back.

I missed the simple things. My mom calling my name from the kitchen. Friends joking about stupid things. Birthday parties I would never attend. High school dances I would never go to. Life kept moving without me, and I had no way to catch up. The world outside continued, and I was trapped in a bubble where time both stood still and tore me apart.

Hunger and cold were bearable compared to the ache of being unseen. The worst nights, I cried not because I was scared, but because I felt invisible in my own story. I longed for a hand to hold, a voice that recognized me, even for a second. Instead, all I had were my own thoughts echoing back at me.

But there were moments that kept me breathing. A stranger’s smile on the subway, a warm cup of coffee someone left behind, a song drifting from an open window. Tiny fragments of hope that whispered, you’re still here, and maybe someone out there remembers you.

Even when my body was tired and my soul felt hollow, I clung to that hope. I knew I couldn’t rewind time, couldn’t relive the birthdays, the laughter, or the quiet nights at home. But maybe, one day, someone would find me, or I would find my way back to the life I had lost.

Until then, I walked the streets, invisible yet alive, carrying the memory of a life that was mine once, and the fragile hope of one that might still be.",1,1770666266.0,story,0,1.0,False
1r0eau9,https://youtu.be/h0b39yb0dqs,"Binary Acustics EP321 MEMS IEM, Written + Video review","Hi all, this is a quick review of the Binary Acoustics EP321 MEMS iem after living with it for quite a long time, (I got it since Mid December last year), and I have traveled overseas with it too.

full disclosure, Hifigo did sent me these for review, but they did not tell me what to say, this is just my own experience with it.

The big headline of this iem is of course the mems driver, but I really don't have any clue on the technical break down of the driver itself, all I know is that it is not like conventional dynamic driver or planar, where theres a membrane, magnet and a voice coil, if anything mems is closer to BA drivers, MEMS driver is a sort of solid state driver where the signal/electricity directly moves the ""diaphragm"" soo in theory it should be a quicker driver (take this with a grain of salt, im still not entirely sure how it works).

On to the most important bit, how does it sound?

it sounds good, very good, overall tonal balance is fairly neutral, there is a sub bass emphasis but it is done in a very clean and precise as the sub bass raise starts lower in frequency so it doesn't give you any extra sauce or warmth. This headphone's entire frequency response is more or less is doing what your source is providing it without much extra coloration. overall it have very simular frequency reponse as the ThieAudio Hype 4 MK2, only and there are only significant differences in the upper treble frequencies.

With the stock ear-tips it is a bit grainy to my ears, and with the Coffee tips it smooths out the graininess, however you don’t need coffee tips to achieve this effect, you can actually install the stock eartips farther down, since the major difference between coffee tip and stock tips is that coffee tips effectively shortens your ear canal since the coffee tips stick out less.

Accessories:

you get a nice carrying case, along with a host of replacement eartips, overall it is a simple accessory package.

Build and Comfort:

Great comfort, I’ve lived with it for 2 months, been commuting and flying with it. Build quality is solid the aluminum and resin combination feels nice. Of course the holographic faceplate makes this iem looks phenomenal.

And that’s should be it, if you have any question please leave a comment below and I’ll try my best to answer.

„Tremor shaking like ET before and after Lyme disease treatment.  
Formal diagnosis: essential tremor (ET).  
Referred for DBS brain surgery.  
Positive Lyme disease test result ignored by all doctors.”

  
**„My head stopped shaking – that was my worst symptom. My legs, head, shoulders, forearms and hands were trembling. After alcohol it got better, after coffee it was a disaster – but this is NOT essential tremor (ET) despite the official diagnosis.**

I did the testing myself and found other people who were also shaking – every single one of them recovered after treating either Lyme, Bartonella, Babesia, or all of them at once, confirmed by lab tests.

The order of improvement is almost always the same: hands stop shaking first, then legs, and the head is usually the last to improve.

If the tremors are caused by an infection – which almost no doctor ever checks for – then the neurologist laughing at you or dismissing it doesn’t mean anything.

Several doctors mocked me, so I bought herbal protocols and I’m treating Lyme + coinfections myself.  
For the record: I also have an **official positive Lyme test**, so I’m not making this up.

This is standard practice worldwide: only ILADS-trained LLMDs (Lyme-literate medical doctors) take this seriously. Almost everyone else completely ignores it.

If you’ve ever had a tick bite or even close contact with cats, it’s worth testing in a proper lab for Lyme, Bartonella, Babesia – and even mold.

Inflammation causes many symptoms, and tremor can be one of them.  
Without proper testing, **no neurologist can guarantee you actually have essential tremor**.

The standard pattern is: a person with Lyme / Bartonella usually gets diagnosed with ET first, or sent straight to a psychiatrist, or put on SSRIs.

You can search for people with Lyme or Bartonella – there are tons of publicly available stories. Treating the infection reverses the tremors within months.”",1,1770666216.0,EssentialTremor,0,1.0,False

1r0e8yy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1r0e8yy/i_saw_a_deer_with_forwardfacing_eyes_it_followed/,"I saw a deer with forward-facing eyes, it followed me home","I first saw the deer a week ago.

My boyfriend and I went hiking last weekend. It was for our anniversary, and we finally had some time off work to spend some time with one another.

My boyfriend, ""Aaron"", was so excited. He'd grown up in the mountains, and so, he loved the idea of us heading out to his hometown to hike. It was sweet seeing him this happy. We'd been in a bit of a slump in our relationship because of work. He'd been put on nights and I still worked days, so we rarely saw each other. We had tried our best to see each other at home, but it was hard.

This is exactly what we needed; some quality time together.

""You're gonna love this place,"" he had told me in the car, ""I promise.""

God, I wished that was true.

It didn't take us long to reach his hometown. Smooth sailing all things considered. Traffic was light, sun stayed up throughout and the tunes were *on point*.

It was your standard rural town. It was quiet and reserved, the place adorned with adorable little 'mom and pop' shops and a miniature fountain in the centre.

We found this cute little cabin on the outskirts of town. It was small, but unbelievably cosy when you put the fire on.

One thing that stood out to me was that the place was littered with huge pine trees. Aaron told me how proud he was when he climbed one of them as a kid. I shrugged it off. I mean, it's a tree. But, *holy shit*. I understood how amazing of a feat this was now. These things were *massive*.

They pierced through the clouds like giant shards of green. My neck killed after watching them for so long. I had never seen trees this big before. It was like they kept rising and rising and never stopped.

There were tons of snowy mountains too. They encircled the town like a mighty wall, protecting it from outside dangers. It was simply breathtaking.

Much different than the desert I grew up in.

His parents still lived there, so we went to their place for dinner when we finished unpacking.

They're a lovely couple. I hadn't eaten that well in a *while*. His mom made a spicy meatloaf and I ate so much of it, I had to pop my belt afterwards. Aaron couldn't really handle the spice, so it was hilarious seeing him gulp down litres of water in between each tiny morsel. His face was flushed after, and so was his dad's. They look so much like each other.

Once dinner was finished, we all sat in their living room, nursing glasses of wine. Aaron drank the rest of his water.

We left around 8PM. I can remember it because we wanted to head back before it was totally dark.

The sun was setting, plunging the streets into shadow. The moon had been up for a while and now it had began to shine beautifully against the darkening blue of the twilight sky.

Streetlamps hadn't been switched on yet, so we had to drive slowly and be on the lookout for people or animals.

The lights from the shops became pinpricks in the rear-view mirror and eventually we reached the western outskirts of the town.

I was lucky that Aaron knew the roads inside and out. I would've crashed as soon as we reversed out his parents' driveway. We were quiet on the trip back. I think we didn't know what to talk about.

""Well, I'm full."" Aaron's voice broke the silence.

""Yeah, me too."" I gave a soft laugh.

The car was noiseless again before we both spoke at the same time.

""Are you okay?"" We matched each other.

For the first time in a while, the pair of us laughed together. It was gentle, but genuine. It was nice.

""Yeah I'm okay,"" I giggled, ""you?""

""Yeah, not bad."" Aaron chuckled to himself, hands relaxing on the wheel.

The silence wasn't as tense anymore. We knew we were tired. That's all.

""The trail's going to look so pretty tomorrow."" he chirped, that big smile of his returning to his face.

I was going to say something when he immediately stuck his arm out and hit my chest, creating a barrier to hold me back .

He stomped his foot on the brake, hard. He had held his arm out across my chest to keep me from plummeting forward into the windshield.

It was so abrupt, I fell into his arm and had the air knocked out of my lungs.

When the car jolted to a stop, I snapped backwards against the seat, narrowly avoiding banging the back of my head into the headrest.

Aaron's arm was still shielding my chest when he fell backwards. Luckily, his head missed the headrest like myself and he slowly leaned his neck back to put his head against the leather.

We sat there, panting after the sudden stop.  Aaron was looking forward, eyebrows furrowed and his mouth contorted into an open scowl.

""Came out of nowhere."" He muttered under his breath.

I stared onwards, eyes fixated on the object in the road.

It was a deer.

She was an average doe; antlerless and she had pretty white freckles dotted on her back. She wasn't looking at us though. Her head was facing the road ahead of us.

Her ears were completely still. Not even a quiver at the sound of the car screeching to a halt.

""A deer?"" I gasped out.

Aaron had his lips pressed into a tight, thin line. I noticed his chest wasn't rising, and then came to the realisation that he was holding his breath.

His eyes were wobbling, tears forming. He hadn't blinked once since he  slammed the brakes.

In fact, he hadn't moved.

""What?"" He murmured in a wispy tone.

He was breathless.

I watched him with wary eyes, awaiting his reaction. I had never seen him this fearful before. It reminded me of a child staring into his closet when he heard a bump in the night.

We sat there for another few seconds before I decided to take action, and honk the horn.

Looking back, I think this was the worst thing I had ever done.

I pushed Aaron's arm towards him and I pressed harshly down on the horn, a quick 'beep' echoed into the woods.

I waited.

The doe didn't move.

I furrowed my brow, and started to feel a strange discomfort in my skin. It was as if I had done something stupid. Hell, even *illegal*.

This awful feeling ran up my neck. I was scared of a *deer* of all things. The woods were pitch-black by that point, and this unease made me want to head home as soon as we could. Aaron was obviously shaken.  I hated feeling so *afraid*.

So, out of embarrassment and anger, I yelled.

I fucking yelled at the deer.

I moved back over to my side of the car and put down the window. I leaned out of it and yelled with as much power as my vocal cords could muster, ""Move!""

Fear definitely put some power behind my voice.

As soon as the word left my lips, a rough hand ragged my shoulder back into the seat of my car. I looked back with confusion, only to see a horrified Aaron glaring at me.

He put the window up and hissed, ""what the hell are you doing?""

""It's a *deer*,"" I snapped back, desperate to get away from the road and head home, ""you haven't scared off a deer before?""

Aaron shook his head in disbelief and turned back to the animal. I did so too, hoping that the deer had taken the hint and galloped off back into the undergrowth.

It hadn't even flinched. The thing was still stuck there, neck twisted to the side and thin legs pin-straight.

The dread washed over me, sending a horrible shiver down my spine. Maybe it was deaf?

Then, as if it heard me think, the deer ran off in the most awful way possible. It made me recoil so far back in my seat, I was practically moving the chair back.

It kept its legs straight and lolloped back into the bushes, like a crappy stop-motion movie. The deer kept its head facing away from us, bobbing back and forth. It looked a spring bouncing around after you pull it back and let it go.

It was jarring seeing an elegant creature moving in such a disjointed way.

It was slow too, taking its time to carefully plod back into the woods.

Aaron and I looked at it disappear into the abyss of the pines, wide-eyed with disgust.

He continued to stare at the animal before I had to shake him out of whatever trance he was trapped in.

He shook his head and thrust the car into first gear, the pair of us eager to get into the cabin.

It took another 10 minutes for us to reach it. Aaron was driving slightly above the speed limit, but I didn't blame him. I kept thinking about any logical reasons as to why the doe had behaved like that.

When we eventually arrived, the pair of us speed-walked inside and locked the door. Aaron double-checked all the windows were locked and we stayed the night snuggled up in our bedroom watching a random drama on my laptop.

The thought of the deer was fading now, with my consciousness nailing the whole thing down to tiredness.

I had seen weird deer before. The idea of one being deaf or injured made more sense to me than it being anything unnatural.

It was our anniversary tomorrow, and that was the main thing on my mind.

Aaron, however, was twitchy all night. He was the one driving, so I could understand why he was unsettled. He's a good driver, and I guessed that he was shocked he didn't see the deer earlier.

The next morning was much better.

Aaron woke me up with a breakfast in bed, much to my delight. He seemed much more calm than the night before. There was still a hint of nervousness behind his eyes, but I shrugged it off. I can't describe the happiness I felt just *being there* with him.

The pair of us set off around 1, and the hike was supposed to last us for at least 2-3 hours, depending on how long our breaks would be.

It was supposed to be a wonderful couple of hours in nature.

It was much longer than that.

We told Aaron's parents that we'd be done by 4, and that we'd left a key under the doormat outside. We also told them which trail we were heading on, so they knew where we were if the worst would happen. They told us to look out for mountain lions, which we assured them we would.

I was eager to get out there, despite last night's events. It had been a while since I went hiking, but with Aaron by my side, I knew it was going to be a safe but fun trip.

The first half of the trek was perfect. We walked around the forest, the great pines covering the mossy floor in shadow. The place was teeming with life, with squirrels dashing past our heads in the trees and birds chirping sweet songs in our ears. Aaron tried whistling back, to little response.

""Guess my pitch is off."" He chuckled.

I gave it go, and surprisingly, a couple of birds twittered back. Aaron feigned shock and snatched me up, before running with me down the trail, shouting you, ""you can't have her!"" and, ""she's mine!""

I was in complete stitches, and laughed even harder when bewildered hikers walked past us, eyebrows raised and some giggling at our frantic display.

At the end of the first half of the hike, we were rewarded with a scene of a beautiful lake. It was around there we stopped for a quick break. We sat on the side of the trail, watching the sun shimmering on the surface of the water. There were people all over it. Some were on canoes, some were windsurfing. Quite a lot of people swimming actually. I could see their little heads bobbing around in the water.

I think I took 20 pictures of the place.

We stayed there awhile before we set off back down the trail.

The sun wouldn't go down for a while, so we took our time.

I had completely forgotten about what happened last night. Aaron seemed a little bit on edge but he was still grinning ear to ear. Sometimes I would see him look behind us. He disguised it as looking at me, but I kind of knew the real reason.

The thought of that deer was still playing on his mind.

In hindsight, I should've been more cautious too. Aaron lived here all his childhood, so he knew what was normal round those woods.

If Aaron was still anxious, I should've been too.

The trail was still relatively busy. It was still early afternoon, so most people probably started hiking then.

We'd walk past them, greeting fellow travelers. We could hear them behind us chatting about work or who's birthday it was that week. Normal things.

We had less than an half an hour left on our way back, and Aaron texted his parents to let them know.

I looked up at the pines. The sun's rays tried their hardest to shine through the dense needles, showering the floor with little pinpricks of light.

Then I heard a voice.

It came from *somewhere*. I originally thought it came from in front of us; it could've been a hiker coming up the trail.

The voice was faint, hardly above a whisper. Although I would call it more of a groan. It was a rattling sound.

I didn't think anything of it and waited to see who was walking up the trail. We went on, smiles still stretched across our faces.

Unfortunately, no one ever walked past.

I could see Aaron tense his shoulders. He stuck his hand out and waggled it, prompting me to take it.

I sped up and walked closer to him, holding his hand. He didn't look down at me, but he acknowledged my presence with a squeeze of my hand.

I was going to turn and see if it someone messing with us, but Aaron squeezed my hand again, and looked at me with big eyes. He gave a soft shake of his head and gestured with his eyes to remain looking ahead.

The voice grew louder the more we walked. It wasn't actually saying much, just a bunch of babbling. Sharp breaths punctuated every syllable. It kept changing its intonation too. One moment it would be as happy as a child, letting out stifled giggles, other times it would be nervously whimpering. Sometimes it would be angry. Like letting out growls and cut-off yelps.

It was almost as if it were speaking to us from all angles. Sometimes hisses would come from the left. Some gasps would come from the right. It wanted us to look at it.

It got colder. The sun was still high in the sky, but a grim, cold wind had picked up, and I ended up having to put my hands in my pockets.

We entered an area where there was debris on the ground. Needles and sticks, that kind of thing. We walked a bit faster through this part, hoping to reach the exit as quickly as possible. We had be less than 15 minutes away now, so we were close. Along with the crunching underfoot, the voice followed us.

It was getting more vocal now, yipping and letting out whoops. Couldn't tell if they were happy screams or annoyed ones.

It was close to us, though. *Horribly close*.

A rancid smell had started to permeate the air. Rotten meat with a hint of ammonia. Last time I smelt something like that, I went camping with my dad. Shot a buck right behind me. I can remember the sound of the bullet going past. He didn't even do anything with its corpse. He just slept by it for 3 nights, and that dreadful smell grew. I didn't sleep a wink, instead I watched it every night, imagining it jerking to life and taking its revenge. At the time, I wanted it to.

It was one of the last times I ever went camping with him. Thankfully. Old drunk.

The crunches were clear, coming from all sides. I wanted to look. I really did. Aaron, however, kept a hand on my back and was almost pushing me along.

So I kept looking forward.

I wanted someone to come past us, a regular person, just so we had some company. To prove that this wasn't real.

Then, we found out where the voice was.

A loud 'snap' of a twig echoed from right behind us.

It caught us so off-guard we halted to a stop. Whatever was following us did as well.

My heart hammered hard against my chest. It had been behind us the entire time.

It had ceased its warbling, and now, was completely silent. There was no breathing. Nothing.

I looked over at Aaron, pleading.

He looked at me back, eyes locked on my face. His breathing went quiet and he mouthed, ""*don't*"" to me.

I returned my gaze to the road ahead, and swallowed. I saw a marker on the left of me. We were close and could probably sprint to the exit.

I was running through each of the signs and where they were, when I heard a sound that sent an ice-cold shiver down my back.

""*Aaarrronnn*.""

The voice was so horribly familiar, yet so alien.

It was my own voice, deep and gravelly. It was like whatever was behind us drawing out the sounds, testing its ability.

Aaron bristled at the sound with a grimace.

It sounded so much like me, except it was throaty and aged.

It tried again, with a higher pitch. It sounded more like me, but just not quite.

The foul smell lingered, almost making me gag. It smelt so pungent and *strong*.

I believe now, that the smell was its breath. We didn't really smell anything like that before the voice came, and it must've been so close to us, we had began to pick up on the scent. I don't know.

My eyes made their way to Aaron's, who was looking at me back with a fear I had never seen before.

He mouthed to me, ""*run*.""

That's all I needed.

Before Aaron could react, I had already began sprinting down the trail, running as fast as my legs could take me. I jumped over the roots of the trees, trying not to fall.

I heard Aaron behind me, his feet stomping against the ground.

Soon, my legs were aching and my heart was desperately thudding, trying to keep up with the fact that I had sprinting for a while. I'm a desk jockey and do zero cardio, okay?

I ran, and ran, and ran.

I kept frantically looking for the markers, hell, I was looking for the exit.

Nothing but the endless rows of pine trees and the odd bushes dotted around.

I had to stop.

I didn't know where I was and the sounds had gone quiet. *Surely* it would be okay for me to turn around.

So I slowed to stop, legs wobbling from the adrenaline. I turned around and scanned the area. Aaron was nowhere to be seen.

I had lost him.

My stomach dropped to the fucking floor.

I spun around and watched. He was nowhere.

How had I gone the wrong way? This trail has one road. I didn't change trail or reach any crossroads but somehow I had managed to go *further* into the woods. It was impossible for me to not be at the opening.

I took in huge gulps of air and started to shoot my head around and yell out for Aaron. My throat hurt so much.

It was useless, really.

My mind began to race, I had to figure out how to find the exit.

I stood up and breathed in.

""*Aaron?*""

My blood froze.

In my panic, I had totally neglected the fact I wasn't alone.

The voice was ridiculously close to mine now, and the only thing holding it back from being an identical copy was the fact it hadn't nailed down my accent.

I have a southern accent. This voice had something akin to someone with Valley Girl accent trying to do a southern one.

It was terrible impression, but it genuinely sounded like something I would come out with.

Then, the next sound it made caused me to jump so far in the air, my knees cracked when I landed.

It made the sound of a car horn honking.

It was so ear-piercing and loud, my ears rang afterwards.

It was short and punchy, like a little, 'pip' you'd do if the person in front hadn't moved when the lights go green.

Now, I would've laughed at that. '*It's a car now?*"" I would've thought.

Instead, I thought, ""It's *our* car now?""

The warning beep I had given the deer that night, just rang out in the middle of the woods.

It did it again, louder this time.

I think it was trying to make me scream or something, because it kept making me jump when it did that.

It kept on hopping from one place to another, searching for me.

When it closer, I backed up to one of the pines and held my breath.

For all I knew, it could've been behind me.

I just breathed. I kept my eyes forward like Aaron told me to, and breathed.  *In, out. In, out.* It's all I could do.

The place went silent again, fear swirling in my stomach. I thought it found me.

Then, I felt something touch my shoulder. The fingers were long and they buried themselves into the flesh.

Slowly, my eyes crept towards the hand, until eventually I followed the arm.

It went up above me.

When I saw what was there, I nearly screamed.

There, crouched on one of the bigger branches of the pine, was Aaron with a finger to his lips.

He held out his hand and braced himself against the branch, moving from a crouch to a seated position.

I grabbed the hand hard, pushing myself upwards and towards the branch just below him.

My right foot made it onto the branch, and I reached up with my left hand. Aaron pulled me upwards, careful to not fall himself.

Just as I thought I had made it safely onto the branch below, my left foot slipped and I smashed my knee against the bark.

I bit back a yelp and bared my teeth. Holy shit, that hurt.

I didn't even want to imagine looking down, so I weakly pulled my leg back up and made my way up the tree.

The voice was further away now, the sound of Aaron's voice calling for me.

It made us shudder.

Eventually, we made it to a branch high enough to be safe, and thick enough to hold us. We could see the ground through the gaps of the needles.

I took a seat and looked at my knee.

Blood made my blue leggings go a vile purple. Scratches in the fabric showed my ripped skin, as deep red trickled from the gashes. It stung like hell.

Aaron placed a hand on my lower back and kissed my forehead. I fell into his touch and put my head into his neck.

Wet dribbles of tears dripped into my scalp. Aaron was crying.

He was always the more emotional one out of us. We established that quite early in our relationship when Aaron had held me, bawling over a nature documentary where a lion took down a gazelle. That was our second date.

I can remember how I stared at him with disgust. A few years later, and I still do, but now I hug him back and laugh.

Growing up in a poor household teaches you to control your emotions. One wrong look and shit hits the fan.

I guess that's what drew me to Aaron in the first place. He did stuff like that and nothing happened. His parents would chuckle instead of screaming at him.

It was the nicest kind of weird I have ever experienced.

The voice had rounded back to our tree and it was back to mimicking me.

""*Mooooveee.*"" Once again using what I told it last night to coax us out.

It did this for about a minute, and then we saw a flash of a brown blur speed past the tree. The blur waddled backwards, reversing.

Then, I saw it.

This deer, wasn't a deer. We established this. But, it didn't make the reveal any less horrifying.

It didn't look at us, and was looking deep into the forest. Then it heard something and faced our way.

Its eyes weren't on the sides of its head.

They were at the front, like a predator.

Like a human.

They didn't look human. They were regular deer eyes, which I feel made it worse. Small, and beady.

The sun was just setting, so the last bits of light reflected off the eyes.

Once darkness began to hit, they changed. In the light of the sunset, I squinted and saw how it shook its head around violently. It looked up in an instant and faced away from the tree. Then it turned, and I saw how it's eyes were blown out. Visibly they had grown a lot, and now they were almost black. Better for searching. It spun around again, and leapt off into the undergrowth.

I heard a roaring sound before I heard a voice I didn't recognise.

It was a little boy.

""*Aaron!*""

Aaron let out a gasp and slapped his hand over his mouth. Tears were in full flow now and his hands were shaking.

""*Over here!*""

Then a giggle, a child-like cough, and a the worst sound of the lot:

A young boy screaming bloody murder.

Aaron clapped his hands over his ears and sucked in wet breaths. I wrapped my arms around him, stroking his flank.

I could hear him muttering, ""it's not 'Jake', it's not him"" over and over.

""*Aaron!*"" It continued to wail, ""*Mom, dad!*""

It was fucking awful.

It's voice kept on wavering back and forth between voices. It had seemingly perfected the ""Jake"" voice, as Aaron kept on choking on his breath whenever it copied the boy.

It had pretty much decided that we were close, because it stayed in the same position for the rest of the time we were up there, right next to the tree we were in. The sun had set fully then, so it was hard to see anything. My eyes adjusted, but it was still difficult.

It went on and on, draining the pair of us. It got to the point where we were used to the screams, and now realised that whatever was making the voices was doing it on a loop like a broken record.

My voice, Aaron's, unknown boy, and then ""Jake"".

It was so mentally draining, I was fully considering jumping down and getting it over and done with.

At least I would be dying or going missing with the one I loved. As dismal as that seems, I really couldn't think of anything else in that moment. It messed with me.

As soon as I was going to close my eyes, a loud 'bang' shot through the air.

We heard a loud, warbling scream and the thundering sound of feet underneath.

Aaron looked at me, eyes red from the crying. His face was full of waiting relief.

A gruff voice yelled our full names and ran around the tree. A couple more pairs of feet followed.

This had to be the rangers. ""Up here!"" I called down to them.

The flashlight beams shone around until they brought them up to our tree.

Thankfully, it *was* the rangers.

We clambered down, and were greeted with the sight of 3 park rangers and Aaron's dad, their faces ashy.

I almost fell to my knees in joy and exhaustion. Aaron just caught me at the last second and choked out a sob.

We had been found.

Aaron carried me back to the entrance of the woods. The place looked so different in the dark.

Aaron's mom was waiting for us with the other officers. She had been in floods of tears too, immediately running towards us.

I had never felt so tired in my entire life.

One of the officers took us to the hospital. I had splinters all in the gashes and my muscles were exposed. Seriously gross shit, but nothing was broken, so I wasn't worried.

Everything happened so fast, y'know?

Aaron was fine, and that's all I cared about.

It was our anniversary after all.

It may surprise you to find out we headed home the very next day.

We were quiet on the way back. I had so many questions to ask, but with one look at Aaron's face, I faced forward and closed my eyes.

We were both too tired for talking.

Once we got home, Aaron checked the house and collapsed on our bed. I stayed up and numbly watched a crappy comedy. No matter how much I watched, I could still hear the screams.

Sometime I dropped off. Don't know when, but when I woke up, Aaron was boiling some water and the smell of coffee wafted its way to the living room.

He walked in and handed me a cup, pressing a soft kiss to my temple with a warm smile.

We sat in silence dumbly watching the TV, when he sighed. ""I'm sorry I took you there.""

I cocked my head. ""It wasn't your fault.""

Silence.

""I knew what was in there.""

I held the cup of coffee and stared at him. *What?*

He sniffled and coughed, ""I remembered everything.""

""What?""

He turned to me, eyes watery, ""Seeing it again,"" he shook his head, ""everything came back.""

*What did that even mean?*

I opened my mouth before Aaron spoke again, ""they told me his family moved away.""

His eyes were glassy now, swimming with memories.

""Jake's family?"" I was gentle, hoping to not set him off crying.

He nodded and took a sip of the coffee. ""One day he was there, the next he wasn't.""

""Now you know why?""

He nodded again morosely.

We sat there for a while.

""We were camping for our birthday? We had the same birthday,"" Aaron looked up, recounting the events liked they happened yesterday, ""It was our 12th.""

I let him speak.

""We were so excited, 'Elle',"" his eyes fluttered, ""then we heard it.""

""The deer?""

""Yeah, 'the *deer*'"" he let out a cruel laugh, ""if only.""

""What happened?""

He took another sip before he started up again. ""It called to us in our own voices, saying stuff like '*over here!*' and our names."" Aaron placed the cup on the table, ""we thought it was funny.""

""I get that, you were kids.""

""Yeah, well, we found it so funny, we asked it to come out and wish us happy birthday.""

""And?""

""I have never seen something more horrible in my entire life,"" he shook slightly, face gradually going pale, ""we screamed.""

So it didn't look like a deer. Or it did, and we just didn't see it's '*real form*'.

""We ran away, or I did? It's hard to remember,"" he wet his lips, ""I *can* remember hearing Jake fall and I turned to look at him.""

I reached over and rubbed his arm when he became emotional.

He brought a hand up to his lips and stared at a corner of the room, ""I ran over and tried to pull him up,"" he gasped, ""and it just batted me away, like a fly,"" his eyes were downcast. ""There was so much blood.""

He looked at me to respond, but I didn't and let him speak.

""It dragged him away, and I ran so far, ended up climbing a tree and camping there for a while.""

""How long?""

He shrugged. ""All I know was that I sat there until the sun went down and the noises stopped, then I ran home.""

""You tell your folks?""

He nodded sheepishly. ""They told the police, they went and checked it out, found blood and blamed it on a cougar."" He forced out a laugh, ""then it spoke to me.""

""It spoke to you?"" I was leaned forward in my seat now.

""Yes when I was about to drift off to sleep,"" he lowered his voice to a whisper, ""'I'll come back for you, then you can join him.'""

I swallowed thickly. *Why hadn't it came earlier for him? Was he trying to ripen him up?* It just made me feel sick. ""Did you see it again?""

""No, I stayed out of the woods, and it didn't bother me anymore.""

The air was thick, hard to breathe. It must've used this hike as a chance to take him.

""I could've saved him.""

""You were a kid, Aaron.""

""So fucking what?"" he snapped at me, ""*I could've saved him*.""

""Could you?""

He paused and watched me intently.

His eyes bounced from one side the next, seemingly going through every possible outcome. With a furrow of his brow, I guess he realised that he couldn't have done anything.

He sat back in his seat on the sofa. His eyes were still cloudy, clearly still thinking.

I leaned over and rested my head on his shoulder, holding his arm.

""Strange what the mind hides from you, huh?""

I didn't say anything. I mean what can you say to that?

We tried to get on with our lives. I went back to work, so did Aaron. We acted like we had the best anniversary of our lives, because what else could we do? Tell my manager that we had some kind of monster deer chase us down in the middle of the woods, and we kept hearing it mimicking us and Aaron's dead childhood friend? See how ridiculous that sounds?

So we put on our happy faces. It was harder for Aaron, obviously. He's looking to see a therapist. He's also talking with the police from his hometown over Jake's disappearance. Jake's parents are yet to say anything. Can't imagine what they're going through.

He told me he couldn't live with himself if he stayed quiet.

I try to look more on the positive side nowadays. I used to be very cynical, and I blame my upbringing for that. When I met Aaron, stuff changed. He was just so *enthusiastic* about life. Car broke down in the rain? Well, at least we have shelter. Lost your wallet? We can always get a new one. You feel guilty for cutting contact with your parents? You had to do that for your safety.

Always, he's been able to turn bad situations on their head, and find the silver lining in the cloud. Even if it's barely visible. He brought out that optimistic part me that I hid for so long. He helped me out of that horrible pit and made me see the light in life again.

Since that day, I've been seeing less and less of that 'happy-go-lucky' guy.

I'm not complaining at all by the way, please know that.

I'd be more disturbed if he just went on with life like nothing happened.

But, I feel like I've been taking him for granted. I want to help him through this. He helped me, so I'm going to help him too.

He assures me I don't need to, but I will anyway. I love him, and if that means I wait on every hand and foot for him, I'll fucking do it.

I thought we were in the clear after we left that place.

Turns out I was wrong.

This happened earlier today, and I'm still shook up writing this.

I was at home after work, and I went upstairs to go change. It looked like Aaron had just left before my arrival, because he left the bathroom light on.

I was about to flip the switch when I saw something.

It was a bit hard to see because of the frosted glass, but there was something outside.

It was a dark, fragmented blob.

I was tempted to open the window to see what it was, I mean, it could've been a piece of clothing that had came into the backyard.

Suddenly, a shiver ran down my spine and I writhed in my spot. I halted and watched the blob. It was completely still, which put doubt on my clothing theory. It was quite windy outside, so the clothing would've wafted around or flown off.

This thing stayed deathly still.

It had four little stumps under it like table legs. *Maybe* they were legs. Cats often came into our yard, with the next door neighbour having two of them.

It looked bigger than a cat, though. I blamed the frosted glass for the distortion, but that theory didn't last long either.

The thing began to move.

It lifted each of the stumps one by one, which now solidified my belief that this was indeed and animal, and then crouched down.

Then, much to my horror, the thing lifted itself up onto two legs, body rising high into the air.

It stood up straight, the stumps now longer. *What the fuck.*

It didn't wobble or fall, but instead went stiff as a board and raised it's fifth stump, which I figured out was it's neck.

So, this thing was either staring away from me or directly at me.

It was hard to see, but I *think* it was looking at me.

Then, an awful thought came to mind.

It couldn't be that deer. It couldn't.

The thing and I were just staring at each other, and I seriously hoped that it couldn't see me.

Then, I realised something.

I had the bathroom light on, and I was standing at the window.

It could definitely see me.

Thoughts of the screaming and hollering from that night played over and over in my mind. *Had it followed us home?*

My body tensed up, and refused to breathe. I had gone very much into prey-mode, and I was now trying my best to hide myself. Which, let's be honest, isn't going to go down well when you're stood under a spotlight.

I don't know how long I stayed there.

After a while, the thing gave up and, whilst still on it's hind legs, it staggered off into the bush behind the house.

I cried. I cried so hard.

I ended up squeezed into the corner of the bathroom, shaking like a leaf with tears running down my cheeks.

I can't remember the last time I cried like that. It must've been when I first moved in with Aaron and that was a long time ago.

After this release of pent-up emotion, I pulled myself together and called Aaron.

I gushed, spilling everything to him. I thought we'd lost connection because he was so quiet. He eventually told me he'd be home soon and that I should start to pack a bag.

I didn't have any time to respond before he hung up, and I was left baffled.

When he came home, he came into our bedroom and started piling clothes into his duffel.

""Where are we going?"" I asked, staring at my boyfriend in surprise. He had never been so serious before.

""I'll tell you in the car."" He didn't even bother looking away from his bag.

""Babe, what's going on?""

""*Shhh*,"" he shushed me sharply. ""I'll tell you in the car.""

I went back to folding my clothes, and chucking spare glances at him. His face was completely blank and his hands were working on autopilot.

We left the house that evening, as soon as we packed.

Is it bad to say that Aaron scared me a little? I had never seen this part of him, at all. It was almost like he was angry.

We got settled in the car and he pulled out of the driveway.

""Are you going to tell me where we're going now?""

He stayed quiet and faced the road.

""Aaron?"" I was getting irritated now.

He pursed his lips and flicked his eyes over to the rear-view mirror.

""Aaron, will you answer me?""

""*Shut up*."" He hissed, eyes bobbing from the rear-view to the windshield and back again.

I sat there speechless. That was the first time he had told me to shut up and meant it. There wasn't any venom behind the words and I didn't know what to make of it.

So, I did what I had learnt to do when people were pissed off.

I stayed quiet and, much to my shame, I dissociated.

He was stressed, and I was making things harder.

I think I must've dissociated for about an hour before I felt Aaron squeezing my shoulder.

We were outside a dive bar. I had no idea where we were.

""You okay, sweet?"" He was rubbing into the meat of my shoulder, face full of concern.

About an hour of time lost.

I heard him call my name and I woke up from that familiar trance.

""Where are we?""  It was  the only thing I was thinking about.

""Let's get inside first, yeah?""

Something in me just snapped. *What the fuck was this?*

""*No*,"" I bit, ""you tell me right now, Aaron.""

He threw his head back against the headrest and sighed. ""Can we just get inside, Elle?""

""Aaron, please,"" I stared right at him, ""I'm scared.""

It was rare for me to say that out loud. Aaron knew that.

He quickly looked all around the car, peeking in the windows, before he turned to me. He beckoned me close to him, and I obeyed.

Then he whispered something in my ear.

""It might still hear us.""

I had a full-body shiver and made my stomach fill with dread.

""So we need other people to block out conversation?"" I whispered back.

He nodded.

I understood, even if it sounded bizarre.

We grabbed a bite to eat and sat in the middle of the booths, multiple families chatting beside us. Finally, we could talk.

That leads me to now.

I'm sitting in the car, Aaron's driving.

In the span of a week, my life has been turned upside down. Life was good. It was good.

I was with the man I loved and away from all the shit in my life. My parents were out of my social circle, and Aaron's family took their place.

My life was *good*.

Now, we're running back to his hometown. It sounds stupid. However, there are a couple of reasons for this.

1. Home isn't safe anymore, that thing knows where we live
2. We would vacate to somewhere far off, but money is *not good* at the moment, and even then, that thing could follow us (we have no idea where this thing can go)

Finally, 3. Aaron told his parents and they believed us, mainly because his dad saw the deer. They know someone. Someone who can help us.

Hopefully, that makes more sense as to why we've decided to head back.

We're going to stay to the highways, no backroads unless we have to.

Hopefully, that thing either stays away, or if it follows us, it gets ran over by a fucking truck.

It probably wouldn't kill it, but it would slow down, I hope.

I'm going to finish this post here. Aaron and I are in the car now, and we're close to the highway.

I just hope we get there safely. Wish us luck.",7,1770666148.0,nosleep,2,1.0,False

After using multiple finance tools, I built Vuna because I was frustrated. Not with my finances - with finance apps. Most great finance app either wanted $/month, bombarded me with ads, or even made tracking a $2 coffee feel like filing taxes and with others I wasn't too sure if they are safe as they seemed to be. I just wanted to know where my money went. And maybe save and budget for things without feeling judged by an algorithm.

""Vuna"" means harvest in Swahili - the idea is you plant good money habits, nurture them, and eventually harvest the results. No shortcuts, no gimmicks, just clarity. Open sourcing and full import/export is also on the road map! To give you full control and know how your data moves.

Finance knowledge shouldn't be a luxury, my gift to the world!

He is not a materialistic man at all and honestly not super huge into holidays but celebrates and does all the things with me because he likes me being happy :) my experience has been that the pressure and planning and paying falls more on the man than the woman (or one partner over the other) for vday so I want to switch that up. He already does a fantastic job at planning things throughout the year-he doesn’t need to feel extra pressure for a specific day. 

However, I am just struggling on thinking of what to do/give for the man that handles everything and wants nothing..

Him:

Union iron worker and boilermaker, sober 2yrs, SO funny-both dark humor and sweet/cute humor, works a TON. Long hours outside. Often either out of town for extended periods of time or a 1.5hr drive when working local. Not materialistic or flashy. Likes classic country, simple easy living, just enjoying his family at home. Loves food especially Latin and spice/peppers. Loves bumblebees and Cyprus trees. Has a huge heart. Handles everything thrown his way. Has a lot on his shoulders and has been dealt crummy cards in the past. He’s overcome so much. 

Us:

1.5 yrs together. Shared home. 2 equal incomes. True partnership in finances and household care. Goofy, silly, playful, cheesy, heavy in love. Both 33. 

Thoughts:

Note in his lunchbox Friday that says “you’re off duty for Valentine’s Day. No planning. No paying. No thinking. Wear something comfy. I’ll handle the rest. 

Morning of-breakfast at our fav diner but I’m calling to ask if I can set the table up like it’s a fancy place lol. Followed by a coffee and short stroll at the riverfront in town. Coming back home to our den or bedroom totally decked out with comfy blankets and pillows and idk some cheesy 80s movies or something. A note with 14 reasons I’m proud of him. No phones. No one else. Just us. I’ll cook his fav dinner in red lingerie. And then do something hes wanted to try in bed for a bit. 

IS THAT ENOUGH?? I want him to feel loved and appreciated and to know that he doesn’t always have to be the one to spoil, I want to spoil too. 

I’m not supposed to buy him boots or tools bc he’s particular.

1r0e7er,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbowloom/comments/1r0e7er/psa_for_nonstop_loomers/,PSA for nonstop Loomers.,"I, like many of you, partake in  the looming hobby. However, I might've loomed way too close to the sun and gave myself carpal tunnel. So you might be wondering ""what in God's name are you doing to give yourself carpal tunnel by making some bracelts?"" 

Well, I like to loom figurines and the process is pretty labor intensive and relies heavily on your hands. The repeated motions of looping bands strained the crap out of my hands. I choose to ignore it at first because I make really bad decisions. This isn't my first time with carpal tunnel and I thought it was a one and done thing. (It isn't)

It would've been fine if I made, like, one loomband figurine every couple of days. Maybe once every day, but I was making like 3-4 loom figurines per day. Non-stop.

This cause the straining in my wrist to get worse. And last night I was unable to sleep because my hands were itching. It was winter so i blamed it on the weather. ""I'll put some lotion on my hands, no biggie"" I thought. 

But the lotion didn't stop the itching. It still tingled.

I could not fall asleep at all and that caused me to stay awake until 2 am. I thought of the genius idea of making myself 5 cups of coffee. (Yes, 5 cups! I don't know how I'm still alive)

I was chugging them back to back with nothing to eat. My blood at that point was coffee. The sour aftertaste lingered on my tastebuds.

I had to go to school and I had too many absences stacked up. Foolishly, i thought that the coffee(s) would allow for me to push through the school day. However, when I step into my first period, I started feeling light headed in under 7 minutes. It was like I was viewing myself through a mechsuit. I had to ask my teacher to write me a pass to the nurse's office. 

Walking through the hallway felt awful. It felt like the blood in my legs were replaced with concrete. I was trying so hard not to faint. 

The nurse scolded me for consuming 5 cups of coffee. The safest maximum dose is 400 mg, I had about 475 mg worth of caffeine in my system. She had to call my mom to come pick me up. 

At home, I connected 2 and 2 together and released that I probably had carpal tunnel again. I did the 1 minute test and my hands were tingly. I'm wearing this with a splint brace which is why there's a ton of typos. 

Also, if you think you have carpal tunnel (numb, tingling, pins and needles feeling) in your hands, buy a splint off of Amazon. Do not go to an orthopedic center, they will milk you dry for what you have. My parents had to pay 145$ for 2 splints. On Amazon they were under 20$

1r0e5d8,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1r0e5d8/do_i_choose_love_or_independence/,Do I choose love or independence,"My bf of ten months and I spend a lot of time discussing our future (we currently live in a shitty apartment). I am physically unable to drive and crave the freedom of a walkable city - my bf is amazing, but he says there’s no way he could live that close to civilization (he wants it to be a fifteen minute drive at least). He says he’ll drive me anywhere, but he’ll be working long days, so it won’t be often. In our completely hypothetical future where he earns enough money to buy us a house and ten acres, that leaves me trapped during the weekdays in a rural place, which is my personal idea of hell. 

We have fought about it a lot. For him, the one thing he will not give up is his dream of owning rural property and land, away from everyone. His criteria is being able to walk around naked in his own yard without being seen. He doesn’t want to drag me into it if I’m not in board, he says that we’ll find ways to keep me occupied. But he just doesn’t understand, we are so different. He is happy with chickens and trees, and I want to see people and buildings, try new flavors at a coffee shop, buy vinyls down the road. I don’t know the future, and I don’t know if I’ll be happy. 

I love him and he loves me - he was the only one who was with me in the hospital everyday for over a month after the accident. But it seems that the future of our relationship is entirely dependent on us finding a nice rural place where I am somehow also able to bike twenty miles to a coffee shop just to temper my restlessness. Maybe we’ll find that “Goldilocks” place, as he calls it. But I don’t know if it’s realistic ",1,1770665929.0,disability,10,1.0,False

I made him a custom sweatshirt and a homemade overflowing box of pictures thing and all I asked of him was to ask me to be his valentine this year. I told him I would be happy with a donut and coffee or even a simple garden salad just something small and cutie to say will you be my valentine and this man has nothing planned.

I’m hoping to build a few actual friendships instead of just being stuck in the cycle online where we say hi a few times and disappear.  
  
  I’m 35 and married. No kids no dogs on my schedule to keep me away from our friendship. I have been a stay-at-home wife for over 10 years, so my social circle has gotten pretty small as people move on with life. I also have zero family being estranged. It has been incredibly isolating here for me since 2018.  
     
  I’m more on the quiet/introverted side and I like calm, low-pressure activities such as coffee shops, bookstores, walking around pretty neighborhoods, gardening, and checking out stuff at thrift stores! The louder activities I have done here are monster truck shows, small people wrestling, and rock/metal concerts. Since I'm always at home I gained some weight over time, and would love a buddy to walk with at Shelby Farms around the lake! I also have a car of my own but it only fits two people!

  
  I’m a bit of a nerd too. I love Final Fantasy XIV (been playing since 2013) and World of Warcraft (played on and off since 2006), gardening, learning new things, and I’m currently trying to relearn math again after not touching it since high school. I'm looking into Phlebotomy as a starting career so I can help others.  
  

  I'm straightedge and I’m not into the club/rap scene... but I what can do are bars like Hi-Tone especially with heavy metal/emo music. A few genuine friends to grab lunch with, try new hobbies, or just text random memes. My dress style is goth/alt so I do have tattoos but they are not offensive. I am the ISFJ personality type.

  I have tried apps to meet people and learned the tough way that they don't work when I'm searching for a platonic relationship especially as a female. I'm also very nonreligious so church never fit with me either for finding friends. I honestly have been **completely lost** since I moved here. If you’re also looking for real, kind, non-dramatic friendships in the east Memphis area, feel free to comment or message me and tell me a little about yourself.

1r0dzob,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheIronCouncil/comments/1r0dzob/how_to_be_more_attractive_sciencebacked/,How to Be More Attractive: Science-Backed Psychology That Actually Works,"I've been down the rabbit hole on this for months (books, research papers, podcasts, random 3 am YouTube binges) and honestly? Most advice about becoming attractive is complete garbage.

Everyone recycles the same ""shower daily, hit the gym, be confident"" nonsense like we're idiots who've never heard that before. But here's what actually clicked for me after studying behavioural psychology, evolutionary biology, and interviewing people way more attractive than they ""should"" be: attractiveness isn't about your bone structure or bank account. It's about how you make people FEEL around you.

The uncomfortable truth is that society, algorithms, and our own biology are actively working against us. We're comparing ourselves to filtered Instagram models, our attention spans are destroyed, and we're lonelier than ever despite being hyper-connected. But the good news? Once you understand the mechanics behind attraction, you can systematically improve. Here's what actually moves the needle:

1. Develop conversational charisma (not just ""social skills"")

Most people think being attractive means being funny or charming. wrong. The most magnetic people I know are incredible LISTENERS who make you feel like the most fascinating person in the room.

There's actual neuroscience behind this. When someone shows genuine curiosity about you, your brain releases oxytocin and dopamine. You literally become addicted to their presence.

practical move: master the ""curiosity loop"" technique. Instead of waiting for your turn to talk, ask follow-up questions that show you're actually processing what they said. Someone mentions they're learning guitar? Don't say ""oh, cool i played for 6 years."" Ask ""what made you want to start?"" or ""what's been the hardest part so far?""

I learned this from ""The Charisma Myth"" by Olivia Fox Cabane (she coached executives at Stanford and worked with everyone from military generals to tech CEOs). This book genuinely rewired how I approach conversations. She breaks down charisma into three core elements: presence, power, and warmth. Most people overindex on trying to seem impressive (power) while completely neglecting presence. The exercises are weirdly practical too, like meditation techniques to stop your mind from wandering mid-conversation. insanely good read if you've ever felt socially awkward.

2. Fix your energy management, not time management

Everyone's obsessed with productivity hacks and morning routines, but they're optimising the wrong variable. Attractive people aren't necessarily doing MORE, they're protecting their energy like it's a finite resource (because it is).

Low energy makes you irritable, withdrawn, and boring to be around. High energy makes you magnetic even if you're objectively average-looking.

The app [Finch](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/finch-self-care-pet/id1528595748) helped me build this habit without feeling like homework. It's basically a mental health Tamagotchi that guides you through small daily actions (like identifying energy drains, setting boundaries, tracking mood patterns). sounds dumb, but gamifying self-care made it actually stick for me when nothing else did.

3. Become genuinely competent at SOMETHING

Here's an unpopular truth: passion is attractive, but competence is magnetic. People are drawn to others who've mastered a craft, built something meaningful, or developed deep expertise in literally anything.

doesn't matter if it's woodworking, competitive Pokémon, or Renaissance art history. When you can speak passionately AND knowledgeably about something, people lean in. It signals conscientiousness, patience, and depth.

Research from evolutionary psychology suggests this taps into ancient mate selection preferences. Competence signalled survival ability. today it signals you're not just consuming content mindlessly, you're actually CREATING or MASTERING something.

Start small, though. Pick one skill and commit to 30 minutes daily for 90 days. I got into coffee brewing (pretentious i know), but now people actively seek me out to talk about it. Having a ""thing"" gives people an easy entry point to connect with you.

If you want to go deeper on attraction psychology but don't have the bandwidth to read through dense research, there's this app called[ befreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450) that's been super helpful. It's an AI-powered learning platform built by a team from Columbia that pulls from psychology books, dating experts, and behavioural research to create personalised audio content.

You basically tell it your goal (like ""become more charismatic as an introvert"" or ""improve my dating presence without being fake""), and it generates a structured learning plan with podcasts tailored specifically to you. You can adjust the depth too, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. It also has this virtual coach avatar you can chat with about your specific struggles. way more efficient than piecing together random YouTube videos and Reddit threads.

4. Upgrade your physical presence (beyond just fitness)

yeah yeah, everyone knows exercise matters. But physical attractiveness is way more about how you OCCUPY space than your actual body composition.

posture, gait, eye contact, and vocal tonality. These matter exponentially more than whether you have abs. I've met objectively gorgeous people who were completely forgettable because they hunched their shoulders and spoke in monotone.

""The Like Switch"" by Jack Schafer (a former FBI behavioural analyst who literally taught agents how to recruit spies) has the best breakdown of nonverbal communication I've found. He explains how tiny adjustments (tilting your head slightly when someone speaks, the ""triple nod"" technique, strategic eyebrow movements) completely transform how approachable you seem. sounds manipulative, but it's really just becoming aware of signals you're already sending unconsciously.

also this sounds random, but start recording yourself speaking. Your voice probably sounds way more hesitant and quiet than you think. I started doing voice memos to myself and realized i said ""um"" like 47 times per minute. worked on speaking slower and more deliberately. game changer for first impressions.

5. Cultivate intellectual humility

This one's counterintuitive, but the most attractive people I know are comfortable saying ""I don't know"" or ""tell me more, I haven't thought about it that way.""

Arrogance and insecurity look identical from the outside (both involve constantly proving yourself). actual confidence means you can engage with ideas that challenge you without getting defensive.

""Think Again"" by Adam Grant demolished my ego in the best way. He's an organisational psychologist at Wharton who studies how people change their minds. The book makes a compelling case that we should think of ourselves as scientists running experiments rather than preachers defending the gospel. When you approach conversations with genuine openness instead of trying to WIN them, people find you wildly more attractive.

There's a specific exercise he suggests: keep a ""rethinking journal"" where you document times you changed your mind and why. sounds nerdy, but it trains your brain to see opinion shifts as growth rather than weakness.

The uncomfortable reality

None of this is quick. You're not gonna read this and become attractive by Thursday.

But if you consistently work on these areas for 6 months? People will start treating you differently, and you won't even know exactly why. because attraction isn't about any ONE thing, it's about the cumulative effect of being genuinely pleasant to be around, interesting to talk to, and comfortable in your own existence.

Most people never improve because they're waiting for motivation to strike or looking for some hack. But motivation follows action, not the other way around. Start with ONE habit from this list. build slowly. track progress.

You're capable of becoming significantly more attractive than you currently are, but only if you actually believe that and act accordingly.",1,1770665574.0,TheIronCouncil,0,1.0,False

1r0dz21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1r0dz21/how_to_be_emotionally_independent_24f/,How to be emotionally independent. (24F),"I’m really struggling. My partner suffered a panic attack yesterday and was in a shit mood.

I gave him space for the day bc I know him. He needs time to just pull himself out of it but I told him “hey if there’s anything I can do to make your life easier let me know” I cleaned up his sink. Just a little touch of “hey, I’m here. I get it. I know it’s hard” I also struggle with anxiety.

We went to a Super Bowl party and I just feel like shit. I was tense because he was tense, we had barely spoken a word to each other all day and I was just kinda craving affection (I’m not being snarky when I say this, I genuinely feel it was a selfish move of me)

I started talking about Valentine’s Day in the car ride over and asked if we wanted to make any plans and he got irritated bc he could tell I was tense and craving affection. So I said “I’m sorry, let’s just drop it and have a good time”

At the party, I chatted w some friends and tried to carry on like normal. We were on the couch and I kept just rubbing his arm with my finger, which usually hell the put his arm around me or something but I could tell he wasn’t in the mood. I selfishly did it a few more times.

I apologized later saying “hey, you had a hard day. I feel like I dogpiled on you with the valentines thing and I should’ve just relaxed into the party”

And he went on a rant about how I can’t stand on my own two feet emotionally and I just feel like shit because to a very real extent he is right. I crave a lot of affection and I asked for it on the totally wrong day.

This comes up a bit in our relationship, and I just feel awful. I want him to feel comfortable and safe with me. Not like he’s in trouble, especially on hard days.

I love this man so much, he is a wonderful person. And I just feel like a stupid little girl selfishly craving love too much.

Last night he cuddled me to sleep, kissed me and made me coffee this morning. Things were still a bit tense but I am just going to leave it for now.

Moral is, I feel like I’ve completely lost my ability to be emotionally independent and I feel humiliated and like a bad partner. I want to be someone who is strong and can hold my own. I have a good job, I work hard, I feel like I do what I can to be there for my friends. But I still don’t know how to get there. How to stop needing validation.

I came on here bc I don’t want the bias of my friends, who I know love me, but I just want a different perspective.

EDIT: this first draft was really emotionally charged. I want to emphasize I don’t think he didn’t anything wrong. He did apologize, but he was having a moment where his reality was warped because of the panic attack and what he needed in that moment was a partner to carry on as normal to keep him grounded. He gave me the reassurance that he could. Even if it means just not speaking. I instead was freaking out and didn’t take time to at least regulate myself. That’s where I just had a moment of “fuck, I’m too dependent on him to regulate myself. That’s not healthy” and that’s where I just need advice.",1,1770665535.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

I won't say to much about me, but just a little bit. I come from the horrible state of Washington, but really I was raised in South Dakota. Its a long story but to sum it up, I move to WA because my mom was there getting her degree, so I also followed. 

It turns out, that was a mistake, people here are so crude and unhappy and have the most elitist attitude I have ever seen. Its hard to talk and work with people, and when you do. They are really unrealiable, and want their way instead. Sure, that's most people, but if you google the seattle freeze (Which makes WA people made when you bring it up), its not only a me problem. Like I have met transplants just working temp in Seattle tell me the same thing because they also feel isolated since no one wants to talk to you (which is why our homeless is bad). Does help because also Californians (San Diego, Los-Angles, and others) also come over here and spread the attitude also.

I say all of this because I want to move to Columbus for the following reasons  
\- Nicer people (to some degree)  
\- Motivated folks to get the task done  
\- Cheaper cost of living and goods  
\- I like to shoot sometimes, so that helps  
\- Awesome sports teams (the Bucks, Bengal's, and other teams to watch).

I don't mind the snow, I'm no stranger to it. I don't discuss politics much either, I don't care if you are on the left or right. Sure I might come from the right (I'm traditional), but I don't let it dictate who to be friends with or not, but the bad experience I and many others have had here. Is just both depressing and heart breaking, and when I move here, I'm going to have to be picky so I wanted to ask.

How are the people here? And really, are there so many new comers moving here that is changing the culture dramatically? 

Where I want to live at is somewhere in Hocking County since its more isolated, but I would love to work in Columbus, New Albany and any near by area. Its just that when I go to a coffee shop, I want to say to you and I hope you say hi back to me. We all smile and go about our day. Not me hearing your problems in the morning with an attitude because you think life revolves around you, new flash it doesn't.

The first, here is for ""McSiren Adventures"". Going like this:



It all began in 1967; in McDonaldland, Ronald McDonald, a 21/22-year-old clown and student at Hamburger University, was celebrating the 4th Of July with his friends and family. This included his cousins, Kingsley Bing (The Marvelous Magical Burger King), and Wendy Dandytale. Then there are the friends; Panera Psomi (Kinglsey’s girlfriend and future mascot for Panera Bread), Sir Skakes-A-Lot, The Duke Of Doubt, Sundae (Ronald’s pet dog), Grimace (or “The Good Grimace” to avoid confusion with his evil cousin), Birdie The Early Bird, and The Hamburglar. 

During their trip to the beach, the large group go on a boat ride with Captain Crook. There, the captain tells them of the mysterious sirens. Once back on land, they continued their fun until they went to ride in hot-air balloons. Ronald, Sundae, Birdie, Grimace and Hamburglar had managed to fit into a basket as Kingsley, Panera, The Duke Of Doubt, Sir Shakes-A-Lot, and Wendy went into another. As they were all up in the air, a storm came by surprise. Kingsley’s balloon had managed to land in time. But for Ronald’s, it was a different story. The aggressive gust of wind had spirited him and his McDonaldland gang far, far away.

In time, Ronald had managed to gain control of the vehicle. But, by the time he could, they were within the South China Sea. Eventually, they landed on an island right near Manila, Philippines. To their shock, this island had the Triple Mocha Fortune cabin, the Red Velvet Magic Shack, the Mixed Berries Forest, and The Dark Caramel Mill to top it all off! But, the best thing about the island was its sole citizen; Astraea Kyllini (future mascot for “Starbucks”) who was about 20/21 at this time.

Calm, warm, and studious, Astraea bore a mysterious aura. For, unbeknownst to Ronald and friends at the time, Astraea can turn into a siren just by the touch of water. 

During the night, as all were asleep, Astraea took on her siren form and went to the underwater Siren kingdom. This was to seek the help of her mother, Melusine (the first Starbucks Siren and descendant of the Melusine of lore). Yet, this was fruitless as when Astraea was about to ask, Melusine was busy with a (troubling) phone call with Mercury-Dynamis Kyllini (mascot for Il-Giornale Coffee, head of the royal Kyllinis and Astraea’s father). Disenchanted by overhearing her parents argue, Astraea returned to the island to sing at the lagoon. 

Meanwhile, Ronald had woken up earlier to find Astraea gone. Concerned for her safety, he and his friends went out to look for her. This led Ronald to be hypnotized by Astraea’s voice until he fell into the lagoon. Fortunately, Astraea had managed to save him in a nick of time. Shortly after, Ronald isn’t told of Astraea’s real issues but senses her depression. To comfort her, he puts on a magic show at The Red Velvet Magic Shack.

As Ronald performed, a small circle began shimmering from the ground. Curious, Ronald and Astraea dug up the glowing object which revealed to be a small crystal ball. And within this sphere, lived a prisoner; a lonely and sad prisoner who was cursed by wicked magicians. And, with Ronald’s magic, the prisoner just might be set free.

Moved to pity, Astraea allowed Ronald to free the prisoner with much success. Now in his original form of a clown named “Bathos”, the emancipated being had flown away as he thanked his new friends.

Soon after, Kingsely, Panera, Wendy, The Duke Of Doubt, and Sir Shakes-A-Lot had arrived. After the storm, Kingsley and his team decided to look for the McDonaldland gang and used their own magic to track them down. Once there, it was revealed that Astraea is Panera’s cousin (Mercury-Dynamis is the brother of Panera’s mother, Demeter.).

Yet, when Panera and Ronald asked Astraea if she wanted to return to McDonaldland with them, Astraea declined but promised to write to them. So, Ronald, Panera, Kingsley and their pals headed back home.

Once I got past the first month or so, I was more or less in the clear and haven't had any significant issues with cravings or anything like that. But I'm coming across an issue I wasn't expecting, let alone this far into being vape free. 

I do a lot of creative writing as a hobby, but I haven't made a lot of time for it over the past year for a variety of reason. Life is slowing back down now, and I'm finally sitting back down to write only to realize that I don't know how to get this part of my brain into gear without a vape in my hand. It feels so stupid honestly, I wrote all the time for 10+ years without one. But I can't seem to push past it. I got so used to being able to crank out ten to fifteen thousand words a day while wired out of my mind on nic, and now I'm struggling to crack two hundred on a good day without it.

It's not triggering any cravings thankfully, but I'm wracking my brain trying to figure out how to work around/past this. Does anybody have any advice for relearning how to do a task you used to associate with vaping and/or anything I can try to give me that ""get up and go"" feeling that can get you into a flow state?

1r0dq90,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersOfHorror/comments/1r0dq90/dollimination/,Dollimination,"There are voodoo secrets unknown to society at large, never reaching documentaries or speculative fiction. For example, most laymen rest assured, assuming that since they’ve never met a witch doctor, such a personage couldn’t possibly possess an item personal enough to that layman—hair, toenail, Band-Aid, or whatever—to permit any hexes against them. But in fact, the very best voodoo dolls are produced from self-portraits, a person’s self-image filtered through whatever illustrative skill they possess. 

 

Unfortunately for Bradley Clarke, he learned of that voodoo secret from a haggish Starbucks patron, who took offense when he opted not to sign her outthrust comic book—*The Unspooling* issue eight—which he’d written and illustrated some years prior. In Bradley’s defense, the woman had clumsily bumped his table and toppled his cappuccino, and he was frantically napkin-dabbing his slacks when the comic materialized from the depths of her Burberry backpack. 

 

“I’m a fan of your work,” the woman assured him. Still, he waved her away. He’d been getting recognized often lately; it was annoying. 

 

“Get lost, you old bitch,” he grunted, taking no small measure of joy as he watched her face crumple into a downcast expression, one incongruous with the psychedelic shawl that she wore.

 

Through her tears and livid shaking, the old gal muttered, “No, no, you shouldn’t have. You shouldn’t…you shouldn’t have done it.”

 

“Your parents shouldn’t have spawned you, so go find a bridge to live under,” Bradley countered. “That’s right, I just called you a troll. What can *you* do about it? As a matter of fact, were it up to me, people like you wouldn’t be allowed to read my comics in the first place.”      

 

“People like me? *People like me?* You dare insult hoodooists?”

 

“Hoodooists? Is that what inbred hags call themselves nowadays?” 

 

“Inbred? *Inbred!* What the heck is your problem? I approached you politely, humbly requesting an autograph, and you went and treated me like week-old, diseased spittle. Someone…*somebody* needs to teach you a lesson!” 

 

“Lesson, huh? Talk about lessons after you graduate from kindergarten, ya empty-headed spastic. They should stick you on an island—or better yet, under one.” *Wow, I’m really laying into her, aren’t I?* Bradley thought, delighted. *What’s gotten into me today? Surely, spilled coffee alone can’t shape me into someone this sinister? Have I forgotten something I should be pissed-off about?*     

 

Seemingly shrinking two inches, the elderly lady flung her entire physicality into a quivering tirade, a finger-waving string of invectives. Mangling much conjugation, interspersing four-letter nastiness every five words or so, she explained that thing about voodoo (you know, from this story’s first paragraph).

 

“I have your self portrait!” she added. “You’re sure in for it, buddy!” To better illustrate her assertion, she opened Bradley’s comic and pointed out its protagonist in a succession of images. Bradley hadn’t just been *The Unspooling*’s creator, you see, he’d also been its star, having written the tale about his experiences as he wrote the tale. It was one of those meta sort of pieces, that certain types of people relate to. 

 

Unfortunately for Bradley, those kinds of fans didn’t mesh well with him in public. Frankly, most looked as if they were about to sneeze on him—and sometimes did, for that matter. Often, they’d demand to take a photo with Bradley, even though he hated to be photographed, due to that wart on his cheek that resembled a nipple. Never were they voluptuous groupies, or even related to any.        

 

“Come on, lady,” groaned Bradley. “We both know that voodoo’s not real. You’re only degrading that issue’s value…when it was Very Fine to begin with, tops.”  

 

“I’m gonna curse you, boy! Curse you bad! A real bad curse! Then I’m gonna tell my online hoodooist group all about it! Best believe!”

 

“Online hoodooist group? *Online hoodooist group!* Lady, I thought those Sarah McLachlan animal cruelty videos were the saddest thing I ever saw. Then you came into my life. I tell ya, my soul weeps.” 

 

“Soul?” she yelped. “Soul, sir…your soul is, is…is curdled. In fact, say goodbye to your soul. It’s…muh-muh-mine.” 

 

*Yeah, she looks like she’s gonna sneeze, alright*, Bradley thought.

 

“Mine!” the woman shrieked, before thundering right out of the Starbucks. 

 

“Hers,” Bradley laughed, making his way to the counter to attain a coffee to go. He decided to throw away his slacks the very instant he got home, to better help him forget the encounter.  

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Naturally, forgetting the encounter wasn’t the coffee spiller’s intention. Matilda Grieves was her name. Fuming was her mentality, inundated by recollections of past insults, the sort that had shaped her into a hoodooist to begin with. 

 

Powering on her MacBook, she announced, “I’ll show him, yes, yes. I’ll make every second of every minute of his every day agonized. *The Unspooling* fooled me good. I actually thought Bradley-\*asshole-\*Clarke to be a kindred spirit. Never again, I say. Never, never. That snobby jerk thinks he’s so great. Well, I’ll show him, yes I will.” 

 

With her laptop’s built-in webcam, Matilda recorded a simple how-to video, which she immediately uploaded to her hoodooist group’s website. In the video, she used scissors to cut out a front profile illustration of Bradley Clarke, from *The Unspooling*’s seventh issue, and then a back profile illustration, from *The Unspooling* issue four, of roughly equivalent dimensions. She then traced both onto canvas, cut it carefully, and sewed everything together, stuffed with yarn. Just as simple as that, Bradley had been reproduced in effigy. 

 

In closing, Matilda snarled at the webcam and exhorted, “This comic book bastard mocked us, my sisters. He thinks we’re pathetic, a buncha inbred hags playin’ make-believe. So let’s teach him a lesson—all of us, together, today. Make voodoo dolls of your own, and we’ll hit Mr. Clarke with enough hexes to leave his doomed, bastard head spinnin’.”

 

As dozens of her web chums placed same-day delivery orders, or busily bustled their way to comic book dealers, Matilda took her Bradley doll for a spin. 

 

First, she made the thing do the splits. 

 

And lo and behold, in another part of the city, Bradley found himself plummeting painfully upon his testicles, legs pointed eastward and westward. Shrieking, he rolled onto his side, only to find his left foot flying into his face, over and over. “What’s happening?” he wailed. 

 

“It worked, I can feel it,” Matilda declared, alone in her bedroom. Frankly, the power she felt coursing through her body aroused her sexually. Fantasizing about rubbing the doll against her erogenous zones, she became flush-faced, and had to remind herself that she absolutely hated Bradley Clarke. 

 

Palpitating, she decided to take an especially lengthy cold shower. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

There are voodoo secrets unknown even to most hoodooists. Prime amongst them is the effect that multiple voodoo dolls have on their subject. I mean, how many people are deemed so reprehensible that they garner drastic measures from not just one, but multiple hexers? That percentage is so infinitesimal, it was previously unheard of. 

 

While Matilda showered, the first of her confrères completed her own Bradley doll. The very moment that she finished sewing the thing together, an astounding process commenced. Seated in his kitchen with an icepack on his scrotum, Bradley felt himself being tugged by an invisible force. “Ahhhh!” he hollered, gritting what felt like too many teeth, assailed by a splitting headache. 

 

*I’m exchanging stature for breadth*, he thought, shrinking and widening. Arms sprouted from his neck. His genitals doubled, as did his legs. His vision temporarily dilated, as he fell off of his chair while remaining seated. 

 

Due to an inexplicable binary fission, there were now two Bradley Clarkes, each half the size and weight of the original. Even his clothing—jeans and an Indian Jewelry shirt, the one with the drippy lips—had doubled and shrunk, though the ice pack remained singular. 

 

“What the hell is this?” both Bradleys asked, synchronized. Then, suddenly, the floored Bradley was slapping his own face with alternating palms, whilst the other Bradley watched, quite perplexed. And even as that occurred, flesh began to stream from both his self-slapping and seated selves. Amalgamating, it formed a third Bradley—the same size as those two, who had shrunken. 

 

Reclining, the new Bradley slid up the wall, then back down to the floor, then right back up the wall, even as his flesh streamed to help form a fourth Bradley. 

 

And that’s how it continued. Bradleys contributed mass to new Bradleys. Ceaselessly shrinking, they endured every painful calamity those distant hoodooists saw fit to send over. One’s leg twisted so severely that bone shards poked out in three places; another found himself blinded as both his eyes imploded. A few danced without rhythm, or leapt far higher than they ought to have. Soon, the kitchen was filled with Bradleys, which was when the deaths began. 

 

One Bradley went up in flames; another endured a waterless drowning. Four strangulated themselves purple-faced. A Bradley spun his head off his shoulders while dancing a jig. Another was crumpled into a ball hardly recognizable as human. Replicated shrieks filled the residence, which might have reached the ears of 911-dialing neighbors, were any home from work at the time.  

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Matilda’s hoodooist network was far larger than one might suspect, and the ratio of live Bradleys to dead ones kept increasing. In fact, the process soon prompted the most clandestine of voodoo secrets to manifest. 

 

You see, when a voodoo doll’s subject is shrunken smaller than their effigy, they effectively become their voodoo doll’s doll. Unseen, true musculature blossoms within canvas. Eyes of glossy, illustrated paper become fully functional. Faux fingers flex as functioning digits. 

 

Ergo, even as the hoodooists contorted and mangled their respective dolls, cackling, they were unaware that such actions no longer affected any Bradley. Indeed, abandoning their physicality, each Bradley now bided his time as a spirit existing inside his own effigy. 

 

Each would wait until their hexer was vulnerable—sleeping, reading, or otherwise distracted—and then they’d enact their revenge. They’d gather knifes, razors, knitting needles, and other sharp implements, and assail hoodooist flesh with all proper animus. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

The original Bradley doll trudged toward a bathroom, wherein a showered Matilda was toweling herself dry. Awkwardly, he clutched a pair of scissors, which he’d discovered beneath her living room sofa.

i (F28) was seeing 34 year old man that lived in my area and owned a coffee shop in my area that i had been to before. we had met in his coffee shop, but had already been following each other on instagram. he would like all my pictures and stories. he then slid into my DM’s after we met, and we started texting every day.

he disclosed to me he was in a 6 year relationship and they were engaged, and told me his ex broke off the relationship back in September so about 6 months ago. he hadn’t had sex since the relationship ended. we texted every day all day while he was away visiting his mom who has cancer for one week. he offered to take me out to dinner the following week when he came back. he stated he had a lot going on mentally and was dealing with it kind of poorly. he was extremely warm and kind to me, and said he didn’t want a hookup but was looking for something serious because he hates dating and the “hunt”. he picked me up for our date at my house and it went really well. it snowed that night so i ended up sleeping at his house in his bed, our date was like 15 hours long. we kissed but didn’t do anything more because he said he wasn’t ready and wanted “something to look forward to”. he also cuddled me, and bought me coffee on the way home. he also asked me if i had to use the bathroom before we left our first date restaurant, “because it was a long drive”.

we continued texting every day, he would call me things like “cutie”, say we should go on his motorcycle in the summer, and send me funny videos on instagram. we ended up having another sleepover two days later. he said he would love to go snowboarding together. when we had our second sleepover he made dinner for me and i made rice krispies.

when we were cuddling he told me that he told his mom he was dating a preschool teacher, and his mom said “yeah you should date a preschool teacher” and he smiled. that night he gave me oral sex, but he didnt get naked and didn’t want to go further, he said he’s only been with one person for 6 years, so having sex with someone new was a big deal for him, and he was trying to take it slow. he said “i know it doesn’t seem that way since i just did oral on you, but i am trying to take it slow” we ended up cuddling. he kept his boxers on the whole time, and only took his shirt off when i asked him to. the next morning he said he loved waking up next to me. he also told me he gave me a kiss on the forehead before he took his dog on a walk while i was sleeping. he also said “i wish you could sleepover again, one night isnt enough” so i agreed to sleepover again that night after work. we cuddled and did the same thing again, and we also had sex. he was visibly anxious before having sex, and had to stop me shortly after we started because he was almost going to cum too early. we ended up having sex and we cuddled. the next morning he said we should go snowboarding that weekend. we also made plans to see each other two days later. he said he thought about me all day at work. he started texting in a cold tone on Friday, then canceled our date about two hours before, stating work was too crazy. i understood, and we rescheduled for the next day. the next day he didn’t text me all day, and then texted at 6pm to meet him at the bar later that night because he wanted to “be solo at home”. i agreed and asked for a time, he never gave a time. i then texted him this message “hey it would’ve been nice to hang out with you tonight - you kinda have seemed a little off the past three days. i’m not sure if it’s something i did or said, i hope not! but if i did something to upset you then i’m sorry!

i was hoping we could be friends at the very least, i liked getting to know you! you can tell me anything, i just appreciate honesty over anything 😊” he texted me the next morning “ Hi good morning looks like

You guys had fun. Good for you. I’m sorry to let you down. I just have a lot to do

On the weekend and a lot responsibilities that come first, so sometimes it screws up plans. That unfortunately my life.

But happy to keep hanging out but I think at a different pace. We just started hanging so I don’t want to feel any obligation. I really like my space so might not always say yes to hanging out, I get it if that’s not for you, but that’s where I’m at. I hope that’s not rude I just have to set boundaries for myself as well and don’t want to disrespect or disappoint so it’s better if I lay out expectations “. i then texted back “ i was a bit sad because you had made a plan, then cancelled, then asked me to hang out again last night but then never gave a time, so i felt like i was being strung along. especially because you were the one initiating the plans, then canceling or didn’t even text back like last night. i felt like you were mad at me! i thought we got pretty close in a short amount of time, so i felt confused, like i had done something to upset you.

i’m not looking to be anyone’s girlfriend anytime soon, i prefer to gather data and take things slow. i just felt the vibe had shifted in our texting, like it wasn’t warm anymore and that made me feel sad, especially because we had sex for the first time a few days ago so i didn’t know if you were just interested in me for that. especially because before it was really warm and seemed like open communication. so i just wanna get back to that vibe as long as you’re cool with it? 😊

i really like hanging out with you, i just need to feel like i can trust you! i’m quite sensitive deep down, believe it or not hehe 😊“ he didn’t respond for 3 days. in the meantime, he posted instagram stories, and watched the stories i posted. he then responded, “Hey, thanks for being candid

Sorry, I need to apologize for letting you down those two times, I just have to work and it’s a lot to keep up with essentially when there’s something like a big storm that fucks everything up. Sorry I let you down.

I’m still learning what I like and don’t like about dating so it’s definitely something I’m working on but I’m sorry to have you caught in the cross section of it.

I think your a great person and really sweet but I’m not sure if I should be the person on the receiving end of that, I just feel like I’m fucked up from all my stuff (which I’m sure shows)  and I’m not really having the best time with it. Not trying to get you involved.

Happy to hang out again but I just feel like I need to pull back a bit and I can’t really explain why. I’m really sorry ” i then responded today, “ Thank you for being honest. I know you’re going through a lot and I empathize with that, but your sudden personality switch hurt me.

I feel like I was used, then thrown away and ghosted. That’s not how I want to be treated, even as a friend. Your internal struggles don’t excuse making me a victim.

This past week you treated me like a stranger. You told me on the couch that you told your mom you were dating a preschool teacher, so I’m still confused about why you then treated me the way you did..

If you feel you’re able to go back to being the honest and sweet version of yourself like when we first met, I’d be very happy to hang out again.

If you’re unable to do that then I need to walk away.

Whatever happens, I hope you take care of yourself “

i posted to my instagram story a selfie and he viewed it but didn’t respond to my text in 4 days. he also went to a wedding this weekend. i then texted “i just want to be honest, i hope we can finish watching Ratatouille some day. but even if you don’t want to see me again or be friends, i think i accidentally left a pair of my blue socks at your house. you can throw them out, or give them to Lukas as a chew toy lol.

i probably shouldn’t double text you, but i want you to know i did value our time together. i know you’re going through a lot. i don’t want to add to your stress. i don’t want any bad feelings between us”

he then texted yesterday morning “Hey

I appreciate the advice but I’m sorry I’m just hot and cold lately and that’s no excuse but I just have a lot going on and probably better that you’re not involved in any of that. My brain is just fucked up from everything and it makes me scared and hesitant to try anything new.

I’m sorry I led you on and then backed away, it’s definitely something I need to work through but that’s just how my heart feels when I’m not sure of something, I know that’s not right and I apologize that I hurt you. That my fault.

I’m Sorry. “

i responded back two days later,

“i forgive you. i don’t think you’re “messed up” like you say. i never expected perfection from you. i just simply like spending time with you

i would’ve listened to you if you opened up about your mental health from the start. i think i’m pretty patient.

not sure what else to say. i really liked when you were sweet and kind to me in the beginning. you seemed very different from most guys. we could’ve just been friends and had a lot of fun. it really hurts my heart.

i hope you take care of yourself (his name)”

he viewed my instagram story that i posted that day of my classroom. but then i noticed this morning that he unfollowed me on instagram. i also unfollowed him as a result, because why should i follow someone who obviously is pushing me away.

was this love bombing? or something else? should i have ran away at the first sign of trouble? any advice appreciated

TLDR; met a man IRL after following each other on instagram. he told me he just got out of a 6 year relationship with an engagement 6 months ago. he quickly acted attached to me, wanting multiple sleepovers, cuddling, telling his mom about me, making future plans, saying he was surprised that i was his type. then after sex he pulled back immediately, became cold, flaked on me twice. tried to mend things via text, he kept saying he was fucked up and didn’t wanna involve me. any advice?",1,1770664586.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

the story starts in june, me and my friend tori go out for coffee with sam, mia and mia’s bf mark. we all go the same uni and share most classes, tori is really close with them but this was my first time meeting them. 

after a couple of hours, tori has to leave but i stay behind as me and sam go home with the same bus so we plan on leaving together. as tori gets up mark’s best friend ben joins us. 

i barely have crushes, i don’t think i’ve had a total of 6 crushes (counting ben) and i’m 21 (turning 22 next week) but the second i see ben i’m in awe, he is textbook my type i can’t even explain it. 

i don’t want to be weird so i’m talking to sam as ben came to hang out with mark, instead ben fully ignores mark and everyone else and is only talking to me the entire time, i swear he was flirtatious.

after like half an hour me and sam get up to leave and the way this guy looked at me not even the one guy i dated looked at me like that, i was so sure he thought i was cute too. 

i leave and i forget his name lol, i mention that we didn’t stay long after she left but that mia and mark stayed even longer with that guy and she goes oh ben in a brush of like oh that was ben way. 

it’s 10 days later i’m out drinking with my best friend and i’m still thinking about ben and the way he looked at me when i left, my best friend suggests i send him a follow and i do. where i’m from the girl sending the follow is pretty much considered making the first move. 

two hours go by and he didn’t accept my follow request yet, i panic and i send a video to tori saying that i sent ben a follow and idk if he has a gf or anything and i hope he doesn’t think i’m making a move or anything i just sent it in a friendly way, i basically lied and i also blamed it on the fact that i was drinking. 

tori sends me back a snap saying that i fucked up and when i ask why she replies with HAHAHAHAHAHA before going radio silent. not even an hour after ben sends me a follow back. 

he doesn’t make any move or anything so i just forget about him especially since that you fucked up keeps playing in my head and tori keeps changing the subject every time i bring it up. 

fast forward it’s september i’m giving someone directions and i see this really handsome guy who i think is staring at me as he is walking towards me i swear he is about to say hi but i bring my attention back to the convo i was already having and he passes me, after that my convo ends there and i go back to walking and i notice he looks back at me. only after he turns his head again i notice it’s ben, but by that point he is walking towards somewhere else and i can’t even say hi. 

i am in shock and i cannot stop thinking about him bc i’m that starstruck. 

our lectures start again and tori, sam, mia,mark and i start having coffee together regularly almost every day, after like a week ben joins us. 

when ben comes mia gets really weird and she keeps introducing us even after we try to tell her that we’ve met, it’s so weird bc she is constantly talking over us and keeps going ben this is a, a this is ben over and over again until ben practically shouts at her that we know each other. 

i feel the tension is thick bc i swear mia keeps looking between us so i just mention the follow, i go hey i’m sorry, i was drunk i really don’t want you to misunderstand i just thought omg i know this guy, i’m sorry if you have a gf or something. he laughs it off and goes no don’t even worry about that. 

the next day i ask tori straight up what up with mia, she tells me mia has this delusional idea in her head that tori likes ben, and when i sent him that follow the next morning tori conveniently forgot about it and when mia asked her about it tori said yeah i know nothing about that. 

i asked tori if she really likes ben she swore she doesn’t and i believed her, she always said that her type is only really buff guys with facial hair and that are very manly and those were the only guys i ever saw her like, ben is super skinny and has long hair down to his shoulders, he looks like a hippie twink who is a stoner. 

i trusted her. 

i move to the city i go to uni and atp me and tori hang out pretty much everyday all the time and we go out once a week with the rest (but ben doesn’t join that often, maybe twice a month but we hang out with him every friday at the same bar).

i’ve mentioned to tori how sending the follow has really bothered me as i feel like evrrything was so weird and it took so long for mia to not be weird anymore. 

now it’s mid november we are randomly drinking tea together and tori goes hear me out ben ever since he cut his hair (which happened in october), and i’m in shock. 

it makes absolutely no sense as she was really struggling from her situationship. idk what to say and i just say hear me out ben with long hair. 

we laugh and she says she really likes him and wants to make a move but she is worried it will make things awkward. 

i tell her to go for it and immediately step back. i am the type of person who immediately loses interest in this type of situations, i mean i was really trying not to like him ever since mia was that weird and now that tori likes him thats an even bigger reason. 

i step back completely, although up until now ben still flirted at times with me and he even gave me a nickname which i was the only one he did that too. 

i try to cut my interactions with him as short as possible. tori is trying to make her move but idk if ben really likes her that much. 

but i now notice the other weird things tori has been doing, she has been taking my clothes and not bringing them back, constantly making me pay for food and drinks, she tries to minimize everything i do and above all everytime i perform better in exams than her she keeps throwing shade. 

it’s pissing me off and i already want to distance myself but now she keeps liking ben on and off and she hates when i even have a normal convo with him. 

she constantly is trying to test if i like him or she keeps asking if i actually liked him and she is just being weird in general, theres obviously more details of what she has been doing but i feel like i’ve already made this post way too long. 

she keeps saying tho that she doesn’t like ben for real but she is just bored when she knows i actually like him. 

the point that i had enough was when she changed her mind that she actually likes him after the fifth time of going back and forth and i noticed she was actually making me pay for stuff by saying she doesn’t have money when she actually does. 

at that point the cup overflowed. now i’m not really like avoiding ben anymore, i feel like i shouldn’t and i’ve come to accept that i do really like him. 

i’m not flirting with him and when he does something flirtatious i keep ignoring it but i still feel guilty as i’ve been thinking that if he does flirt with me i could potentially entertain that thought a little. 

i don’t know. i feel like a shitty friend but my best friend says that tori doesn’t even see me as a friend with the stuff she’s been doing so why should i. 

i don’t know what i’ll do, i really like ben but i also don’t want to break girl code. ",1,1770664578.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1r0di7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1r0di7p/i_didnt_believe_in_demons_until_one_started/,I didn't believe in demons until one started following me,"I never believed in demons or other things that went bump in the night until now. At first, I thought I was crazy. Before things escalated to understanding what was actually going on, it was just small things. My keys were in different rooms and I always put them in the same spot when I got home. My front door would constantly be unlocked shortly after I locked it. I’d hear what sounded like footsteps behind me and always felt like I was being watched or someone or \*something\* was behind me. I’d tell myself it was all in my head, that work was extra stressful lately and it was just rubbing off on me in odd ways. I wish that was the truth.

After I realized more was going on and it wasn’t my imagination, I convinced myself that there was a ghost. It didn’t make any sense, I had the house built myself and I was the only one living there, so it wasn’t like someone was playing a prank on me. I wish more than anything that that was the truth. Sometimes knowing the truth of things isn’t worth the pain. 

One night, it finally decided to reveal itself to me and when that happened, I convinced myself that I really had lost my mind.

The voice was calm and detached as it spoke to me, “You see me, don’t you,” it said right outside my door. It wasn’t a question. It was stated as a fact.

My mind wouldn’t accept what it was seeing and took a second to fully form in my mind's eye. It was a man. He looked like me which freaked me out more. It was just an ordinary looking man but then I looked at his eyes. They were strange. They were a deep abyss of black. I went to reach for my phone to call the cops and tell them I had an intruder. I assumed the eyes were either a trick of the mind or some weird new contacts.

As I picked up my phone, he smiled at me and showed me that he had it. At this moment my mind shut down and I was unable to move. “Who are you? What are you doing here, get the fuck out!” I screamed but it came out as a whisper. 

“Hello there, Isaac. I wanted to make sure you realized this is real and actually happening. We have much to do,” it said flatly. And with that it was gone.

After he disappeared, instead of walking out of the house, I knew I had lost my mind. I decided at that moment I would call my old psychiatrist tomorrow. I was at the age where schizophrenia shows up and my grandmother had it, as she would scream about demons being after her. What I know now is that she was, in fact, not crazy. They targeted her like they’re doing to me now. At that moment, I didn’t know what I know now. All I knew is that I couldn’t sleep. I decided I’d call my girlfriend instead. I walked over to the hallway, picked up my phone and closed my door. I locked it just in case. 

“Hey hun, what’s going on?” She asked. “I just kind of had a bad dream I guess and just wanted to hear your voice.” I could hear the smile in her voice as she spoke, “I’m glad you called. I was just thinking of you. What was the dream about?” I went on to explain what happened in my dream or hallucination and we talked for a bit about it. I knew she was the one to talk to, not just because of our relationship, but also because of her love for all things supernatural. She actually believed in it and claimed to have a friend from our high school that hunts the creepy crawlies that go bump in the night. I, of course, didn’t believe that and always thought she was kidding. As it would turn out, I’d be at the mercy of her friend soon after that conversation.

The next morning, I got up and was very sleep deprived. I had nightmares about his eyes all night. I splashed water on my face, got ready for work and poured myself a large cup of coffee.

On my way to work, I felt eyes on me the whole way there. Everywhere I looked, I thought I saw him. No matter how far I walked, he was always a step ahead of me. 

I finally made it to work and tried to make myself invisible as I sunk down into my seat. Before I knew it, the work day was almost over. I finally finished what I needed to and decided I’d leave early. I really needed sleep. The documents started to blur together as the day went on.

I walked out of the building, and as I did he approached me. “Hello again, Isaac,” he hissed as he stared at me with those evil eyes. “We need to have a conversation.” Before I could engage with what I thought was a hallucination, one of my coworkers approached me. “Hey Isaac! You forgot your folders you wanted to bring home,” she said as she walked up. I didn’t get a chance to answer before she turned to my nightmare and spoke to it. “Oh hello, are you a new employee?” She looked at him and confirmed my worst fears. It wasn’t a hallucination. I wasn’t dreaming. It was \*all\* real. He gave her a charismatic smile. “I work on the floor below you. Isaac is just a good friend of mine, right Isaac?” I couldn’t speak. I was frozen in place. I just gave a nod, an excuse and all but ran away. 

He caught up rather quickly. I narrowed my eyes on him. “I’m not giving you my soul, if that’s what you think,” I said sternly. He laughed a joyful laugh. “Despite what humanity thinks, we rarely collect souls before they go to our Kingdom. The Usurper does not like that as much as the old King did.” I had no idea what he was talking about. Usurper? What the fuck? “No, I’m not here to take your soul. I’m here to finish what I started with your lovely little grandmother before she blocked me out and then had the audacity to go off and die like she did.” That wasn’t the answer I was expecting. I was sure my grandmother was just sick and seeing things. “Why me?” I whispered. “Come with me and all will be explained.”

We walked for a bit before landing at the park near my apartment. It was surprisingly empty and part of me wondered if that was his doing. I was still absolutely terrified but I tried my hardest not to show it. He turned to me, with a smile and gestured for me to sit down. I obliged against my better judgement. 

“Isaac, you need to understand something. This is not something you can avoid. Your grandmother made a deal with me decades back and never followed through. Part of the deal was that I would never involve her children. She didn’t think to say not to involve grandchildren as you weren’t even born yet. I keep to my word when I can but I always see the flaws in deals being made.” I couldn’t believe it. When my grandmother was on her medication, she was so normal and sweet and always went out of her way to protect me. Now I think I understand why she felt so close yet so distant at times. Giving me weird looks and asking strange questions, like if I’ve seen anything strange or if anyone has approached me. I wrote it off as her being paranoid or trying to see if I have signs and symptoms of her illness as well. I also now realize she most likely never took her medication and just didn’t talk about the things she saw when she was supposedly on a regimen of medication and therapy. I still felt like I was crazy and most likely hallucinated the coworker but as the folder sat beside me, I knew that wasn’t the case.

“What exactly am I supposed to do for you and why do you think I would,” I asked. He folded his arms and tilted his head, as if he was pondering what I said. “Because, you’re the only one that can as you’re an only child and have no cousins. And if you don’t help, well things will be \*much worse\* for you. I’ll destroy everything you hold dear. Starting with your lovely little girlfriend. I won’t kill her, no but I will reveal myself to her as she already believes in us and corrupt her. I’ll make sure you never see your family again. The deal I made with your grandmother is now null and void as she is dead and burning. Then, I’ll come for you and you will beg for death. So it’s best if you do what I say.” I began to shake as he spoke. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t want to involve myself with this \*thing\* and damn myself to Hell but I couldn’t put the people I love in harm's way. “What do you want me to do?” He smiled.

“You will help me break the Seals. We have to wait until the first one is broken but I have it under good authority from the Usurper that the first one will be broken soon. Only one person can break it and she is currently unaware of her heritage. As soon as she breaks it she will know who she truly is, the daughter of the Fallen One.” I had no idea what the hell he was talking about, once again. I assumed the “Fallen One” was Lucifer but I had, and still have, no idea who the Usurper is. He refused to answer questions about it. “So what do I do exactly?” He seemed to have a shiver through his body as he spoke. “There Seven Seals and the first one involves the daughter of the Fallen One going against her true nature. The one I need you to help with is the rest of them. The first one you will help with is helping turn holy ones against God. It is actually easier than it sounds. I will contact you shortly with instructions. And one last thing before I go, if you try running, know you are imprinted. I will find you wherever you go.” And with that, he was gone.

As I walked home, I thought everything over. There was no way I could do this. Not only would I be damning myself, I’d be damning innocent people. He didn’t even give me a number of how many people but I imagined it would be a lot. I didn’t know what to do. Then I had a thought and pulled out my phone and called the one person I thought could help: my girlfriend. “Hey Han, I have a strange question.” She gave a small snort, “Oh yeah? What’s that?” I took a deep breath before I continued. I knew she’d think I’d either gone insane but it needed to be done. “Can you give me the number of that girl we went to school with that apparently hunts demons? I don’t remember who it is.” “Why? Did something happen?” I shrunk into myself at her question. I didn’t want to tell her much and have her worry about me. “I just wanted to talk to her about a story I’m writing and get her opinion so it’s more realistic.” “I mean yeah I can give you her number but I didn’t realize you’ve gotten back into writing. But yeah, I’ll text you her number. Her name is Lillith.” I frowned. I remembered her from school. She was a bit odd and closed off but all the guys had a huge crush on her growing up. She lived with her aunt, whose name I can’t remember because her entire family was murdered by some weirdo. As I was thinking, I got the notification for her number. “Hey can I call you back later, I need to make some work phone calls real quick. Love you.” “Love you too,” she said before hanging up.

I made it to my apartment before I called Lillith. I didn’t want to be in public at the time of that phone call and have people stare at me as I talk about a demon threatening me. I typed the number into my phone and called as quickly as I could. She picked up on the third ring. “Hello? Who is this?” “Hi um, I don’t know if you remember me but we went to high school together. My name is Isaac — and I need your help.” She let out a sigh before she spoke. “Yes. I remember you. Hannah texted me saying you were going to call for help on a story? I don’t do that. Sorry.” Fuck, I thought. “Wait! No I just said that to Hannah because I didn’t want to freak her out or have her think I’m crazy but she told me what you do and there’s a demon after me. My grandmother made some sort of deal with him and she never followed through with it and now he wants me to do it. I don’t know what to do! If I don’t do it he’s going to kill everyone I love.” “I’ll text you an address. Meet me there in 20,” she said before she hung up.

I made it to the spot in under 15 minutes. It was a small, barely lit storage space right outside of the town limits. She was already there when I arrived. She looked almost the same. What stood out most, even now, were her eyes. One light blue eye and one dark brown eye. It was part of why all the boys were obsessed with her. It made her seem otherworldly and maybe she was. She wore leggings and a large sweatshirt and something about that made the unreality of the situation stranger. I don’t know what I was expecting a demon killer to wear but it wasn’t that. 

“So,” she said sharply, “What exactly happened and what did the demon's eyes look like?” I explained the entire situation to her, down to the eyes and all. “It’s a good thing you called,” she said. While the black eyed demons aren’t the strongest, they’re certainly one of the trickiest and love to mess with people. To be clear, you are not stuck with your grandmother's debts. He told you himself, and it’s okay that it didn’t register with you, that the deal with her is null and void. He wants you to think that you owe him and that you have to do what he says. But, you don’t. He’ll still fuck up your life until you do it but I can stop him. I’ve fought worse than him and I’ll probably fight worse than him in the future.” She seemed very sure of herself but not in a cocky way. Something about her words made me feel safer. She knew what she was doing and I had a feeling she was the only one that could stop him. “He will know you’re with me and he will be here soon. We need to get ready,” she said as she stood up and grabbed her bag.

We spent the next 30 minutes getting ready. I stood in a circle of salt, feeling very unmanly but was surprisingly okay with it, as she made what looked like a pentagram out of some kind of dark substance that looked like sand. As she finished, the lights flickered and I knew that meant he was here. Despite being safe in the circle of salt supposedly, I was terrified. Why the fuck would a demon be afraid or whatever, of salt? It still makes no sense to me.

He strode in like he owned the place and smirked at me before he turned to Lillith. “Oh look, you found a little tracker to help you. I will have to retaliate for this transgression once I finish with this one. The Usurper will not be happy that I am the one to kill her but he will forgive eventually,” he said in a voice filled with pride right before he stepped right into her trap. Apparently he was so distracted by the thought of killing Lillith, he didn’t look down. 

She smiled as she looked at him. “It seems there won’t be any killing today. What is your name, friend?” He narrowed his eyes on her. “I won’t be giving you my name. I’m not that stupid.” She shrugged. “It doesn’t matter anyway, I can banish you without it.” He finally averted his gaze on me. “Even if I go back to Hell, you won’t be able to stop what’s coming,” he said as he turned back to Lillith, “Even you tracker. You have no idea what’s coming for you but you will. Soon. It’s not going to be pretty and I will relish in your downfall.” As he spoke, it sent chills down my spine. It didn’t matter if it was true or not, he believed it and it made me believe it. Lillith didn’t believe it. That much was obvious.

  


“You and your little friends always say that before I banish you or kill you. It doesn’t scare me,” she said as she opened the book in her hands. “It’s time for you to go, say hi to all your brothers and sisters for me.” The demon looked terrified, which scared me even more. “Wait! You don’t have to do this. I’ll tell you everything. Things you don’t know. I’ll tell you why your family actually died. I’ll tell you what your Aunt Roberta never did and never will,” he screeched. “I’m good. Thanks though.” And with that, she began the banishment. I didn’t understand a word of it, it was in a different language which sounded like Latin but different. I never did ask her what the language was. As she banished him, the lights flickered, he began to roar in pain. The lights fully went out, and when they came back on the man was on the ground. She stepped over to him, and checked his pulse and frowned. “He’s dead. I’ll deal with this later, let’s get you out of here.” 



We walked out to the car in silence. As I reached for the car door, she stopped me. “If anything else happens, if it somehow comes back, call me. I’ll do what I can.” I gave her a small smile. “Thank you Lillith, truly.” She shook my hand, and with that she was off.



I made it home 20 minutes later and parked my car. I couldn’t get out, not yet. Everything I thought I knew about the world was false. There are things out there that cannot be explained. I gripped my steering wheel until my knuckles were white. At that moment, I realized my life had changed irreparably. I’d never be the same after today. I still look at the world differently, and I’m far more guarded, looking for anything strange and hoping nothing strange will happen again. I know now that won’t be possible. 



I got out of my car and decided to go for a walk. I walked until my lungs started to burn. 



I looked around. The streets were extremely quiet. There were no people on the sidewalk. I didn’t see any cars. It felt like there weren’t even any bugs around. I felt completely unsettled but didn’t know what to do. I kept my eyes forward and kept walking.



Then I had the feeling of eyes on me again.



I turned around quickly, but I didn’t see anyone. 

I turned around and there was a woman standing in front of me with an unsettling smile on her face. I tried to walk past her but she stopped me.



“Where do you think you’re going Isaac?” The chill returned and went right down my spine. “We still have more to talk about.” I froze, confused. “How are you back here? She banished you not even an hour ago.” She smirked. “The Usurper likes me and knows we have work to do, and that is what we will do,” he said with a tone of finality. “No! I’ll call Lillith again, she will stop you again. Maybe even kill you.” She smiled at me. “You don’t want to work with her. She isn’t who you think she is.” My hands shook as I tried to control my fear and anger. “What do you mean? And why should I believe you?” She tilted her head as she took a step closer. “Well that’s all I’m allowed to say about her but the reason you should believe me is because I’ve never lied to you. The breaking of the Seals is necessary. \*She\* is necessary, just not for what we need to do together. Her time will come. That is a promise.”



The streetlights began to flicker as we walked. I felt so defeated.



“Why her? Why is she necessary?” She gave what I assumed was a frustrated sigh. “She is a key for a lock that doesn’t respond to just anyone. Her destiny will be soon upon her and the truth will be revealed.” I frowned. She was being cryptic once again. I realized the banishment wasn’t going to work and I didn’t want to be responsible for the woman it’s possessing to die like the man did. I was at a loss. Every option seemed like the wrong one. I understood that not only was it watching me, but clearly there were demons watching her too, which makes sense. “If you contact her again, I’ll consider that a betrayal to our dear, dear friendship and I will kill everyone you love and make you watch, do you understand?” I nodded at her, utterly defeated and hollowed out. “Fine. I’ll help you. Where do we start?” She smiled at me as we continued to walk off into the night.



I won’t go into detail just yet on what we’re planning to do. I write this as a confession and a warning. There are things out there that our human brains just cannot accept. Something bad is coming and I’m not sure even Lillith can stop it. There is more to her than I realized, more than I thought was possible. I can’t reveal it yet, but I know the truth will be out there soon.



I don’t know what Lillith is planning. I’m not even sure she knows yet, or if she even knows The End is coming. 



There are things out there plotting for her downfall or her uprising, depending on which entity you ask. But it’s been waiting for her for a long time. Longer than can be imagined. I wonder if she even knows about it. Keep yourself guarded, and if you hear about a woman who deals with things that go bump in the night, try to find another option. Don’t go looking for her. 



The demons out there are on her trail and looking for her. They haven’t found her just yet. But it’s been patient for a very long time.



I’m not sure what comes next from here, but whatever it is, it’s not going to be good.

I’m sorry. I just wanted to protect my loved ones but through my actions I’ve damned everyone.

The following morning, as Andy tended the fireplace in the den, Morwen emerged from her hatch in her full suit of leather armor, complete with the prominent behemoth insignia armpatch and a longsword strapped to her side.

“Good morning, my ever-faithful stew-tender,” she said in a teasing tone.

“Morning,” Andy said, smiling.

“I’ve got to head out promptly,” she said, “but I have one request: could you help Pliny today?”

“Sure,” Andy said. “Is he around?”

“If he’s not here now, he will be sometime this afternoon,” Morwen said.

Andy nodded. “Sure, anything he needs, I’m happy to help.”

“Thank you, sir,” Morwen said as she approached the staircase quickly. “Oh, and one more thing,” she turned around to face Andy. “If you really want to learn about official Order business, I will teach you soon. I need to clear some things up first.”

“Yes,” Andy said. “Sorry about blabbering yesterday. I should’ve known better.”

“You’re fine,” Morwen said with a slight smile. “Gotta run!” She turned around and disappeared down the staircase.

After some coffee and a hearty pastry he found in the pantry, Andy decided he’d make another attempt to read the enchantment appendix in *100 Weapons* while his mind was sharp. He picked the book off the shelf, plopped into an armchair, and began to read.

>Appendix IV: Enchantments and Martial Talismans

>Enchantments are an effective way to enhance the capabilities of your equipment. A knowledgeable and experienced Enchanter can bind powerful spells to most weapons. Be sure to consult with an Enchanter to plan enchantments effectively, as some weapon-spell combinations are not ideal.

>Further, instead of tying one or many enchantments directly to a weapon, many Fighters prefer the use of stones called martial talismans. These martial talismans are typically small and coinlike in shape. Across Palima, the martial talisman has taken on a standardized size. This type of talisman is known colloquially as a “hot coin.”

>Many finely crafted weapons originating in the continent of Palima feature one or more standardized indentations in them that can hold hot coins, thus imbuing the weapon with the magical traits that the talisman holds.

>While the spell effects of a modular hot coin are typically weaker than enchantments imbued directly into a weapon, the hot coin provides convenience, both for the Fighter and the Enchanter.

>Fighters can use hot coins in a modular fashion, swapping out enchantments as needed without immediate access to an Enchanter. A Fighter can build a collection of martial talismans, changing them out as he or she sees fit. Furthermore, enterprising Enchanters across the continent often imbue martial talismans with popular spells in large batches, creating greater efficiency in their craft.

>IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: It is recommended that you consult with an experienced Enchanter or Forger before attempting to mount a martial talisman on your own weapon for the first time, or, for weapons with multiple slots, before mounting a new combination of martial talismans. Unexpected interactions may occur between a talisman and a weapon, or among talismans.

The text then depicted a complicated schematic: a longsword with several “hot coin” slots in the hilt and one mid-blade. There were arcane symbols labeling each slot, and a complex table of runes, with another disclaimer at the bottom of the page:

>This diagram is no replacement for the counsel of an experienced Enchanter or Forger. Be sure to consult a knowledgeable professional before mounting a new talisman (or new combinations of talismans) on your weapon.

Andy yawned involuntarily. He thought he understood most of it, but he couldn’t be sure. Nonetheless, he made a mental note: *standardized martial talismans, “hot coins”... powerful. Interesting, convenient, and potentially hazardous. Don’t mess with them if you don’t know what you’re doing.*

And now his head hurt. He slouched back in his chair, running his temple and unclenching his jaw.

Andy closed his eyes, taking stock of his progress so far. He had died, entered a new world, chosen to pursue the **Fighter** class, hiked a mountain, been injured and healed by a **Cleric**, scaled a cliffside to earn a level in **\[athletics\]**, eaten some of the best food had ever had, taken a bath in a hotspring in a cave, and had begun training in **\[combat\]**. On top of that, he had found a group of people that he truly liked, and that seemed to truly like him. Not only did they like him, they seemed like they wanted to support him, to see him grow stronger.

And now, he was perusing these books, educating himself on magic weapons, learning about cave monsters, and beginning to understand an elite order of fighters.

It had barely been five days.

\*\*\*

“Oi, lad, Morwen told me I could borrow you today,” Pliny called as he entered the yard from the trail that went eastward to the city.

Andy had been chopping wood to replace the logs he took upstairs for the midday stew-tending. He wiped his brow and lodged the axe in the chopping block.

“Sure thing,” he said. “What do you have in mind?”

“Morwen tells me the trails up to the cliffs need trimming,” Pliny said. “Starting with this one here.” He pointed toward the western trail that led toward the mountain.

“It certainly wouldn’t hurt,” Andy said. “And the trail to the training site up the mountain is badly overgrown.”

“Well, let’s get to clearing it, then,” said Pliny, brandishing two simple machetes. “Just got a couple of bush whackers in town. You haven’t done any **\[martial weapons\]** training yet, have you?” Pliny said.

Andy shook his head.

Pliny held up one of the blades. “Sharp as hell,” he said. “It’ll cut through brambles like butter. It’ll cut through your arms and legs too, so be careful.” He held the machete by the blade, offering the handle to Andy.

Andy accepted it. The blade was heavy, but not unmanageable.

“Strictly speaking, these aren’t weapons. Not exactly, anyway,” Pliny said. “They’re tools for yardwork.”

Andy followed the man across the yard to the eastern trail, Mount Aurora looming in the near distance until they passed under a canopy of trees.

As they came to an overgrown patch, Pliny began hacking. “I’ll take the left side, you take the right,” he said.

“You got it,” said Andy. He brought the blade down into an unruly mess of brambles obstructing the path. Over the past few days he had to step around it, but no more. The blade made a clean cut at the edge of the path and the excess overgrowth fell to the ground like hair clippings at a barbershop.

It was actually kind of fun.

They continued clearing the path until they arrived at the main trail, which didn’t require their maintenance.

“Now let’s get up to the cliffs,” said Pliny. “Heard that path was a mess.”

Andy nodded. “Yeah, it wasn’t easy to get through with brawner boots,” he said.

Pliny chuckled. “You know, we haven’t had much use for the training cliffs lately, no one has come through the Dawnspring in a while, and the Visitors that *do* come through opt for spellcasting classes straight away. You’re the first **Fighter** recruit we’ve had in a while, so apologies for the rough shape of our… facilities.”

“No need to apologize,” Andy said, hiking slightly behind Pliny. “If anything, it’s a good excuse for a hike.”

“That it is.”

They continued up the now-familiar trail, scrambling over the steep inclines and arriving at the flat junction where the training trail split off.

“My god!” Pliny said, beholding the badly overgrown pathway. “You ducked through here in brawner boots? You weren’t joking. That had to be tough!”

Andy laughed, but Pliny wasn’t wrong. He was just happy that, today at least, he could experience the cliffs without wearing bricks for shoes.

They hacked their way through the trail. Pliny went in first, taking the left side, while Andy took the right. Pliny also hacked at branches, vines, and brambles that obstructed the path from above so that it could be traversed by a full-grown man with ease. Andy caught any stragglers left to dangle.

All-in-all, the process didn’t take too long. It was less than an hour before they emerged at the cliff overlooking the city skyline with the afternoon sun above them.

“Forgot how gorgeous this spot was,” Pliny said, looking out on Cresthaven.

Andy did the same. It was almost involuntary.

“Now, correct me if I’m wrong, you haven’t been to the city yet, have you?” Pliny asked.

“I have not,” Andy said.

“That’s what I thought,” said Pliny. “We’ll have to get you there soon. It really is something special.”

On the far side of the city, just off the coast, a boat opened a massive sail, visible from a long distance as it slowly moved out of the crowded bay.

“What do you like to do there?” Andy asked.

“Ah, the food, the music, best taverns in Palima. And, if you like gambling like our good friend Andretti, some excellent dice halls and card tables. Let’s see… what else… parades, theaters, and plenty of weapons shops. First thing I like to do off a dungeon raid is pick up new toys from Gemini, best **Forger** and magic weapons dealer around.”

“That sounds great,” said Andy. “I’d love to go. I suppose I need to finish my training first. Morwen has me stoking the fire in the den four times a day.”

“Ah, yeah, well you’ll be done with that soon enough. You’ve done your first level of **\[athletics\]** training, and you’re in the middle of your first level of **\[combat\]** now, right?”

“Yes, that’s right,” Andy said.

“Finish your first level in **\[combat\]** this week, then on to **\[martial weapons\]** and… well… I guess six more skill ranks after that… and **favored weapon training**…” Pliny’s face fell.

Andy had quite a bit of training left before reaching his first rank in **Fighter**. But he knew Pliny meant well.

“I suppose it might be a while,” said Pliny. He looked toward Andy with a mischievous grin. “Maybe I can convince Morwen to let you off for a weekend and I can show you around.”

“I’d love that,” Andy said. “Morwen seems to think the city is a mixed bag,” he said, prodding gently for more information about the political situation.

“And she has every right to hold that opinion,” Pliny said. “She’s seen the best and the worst of this city. Most of us in the Order have.”

“What’s the deal?” Andy asked. “Like, who are the villains?”

Pliny looked over Andy’s shoulder, then behind his own. “Follow me,” he said. He passed the notches in the cliff face that Andy had trained on the day before. They rounded a corner, where a tall ladder stood propped against the mountainside. “Good, it’s still here,” he said, grasping the wooden ladder and pushing it up against the cliff.

“Not going to use the notches?” Andy asked.

“Hell no,” Pliny said. He turned around and scaled the ladder quickly. After he made it to the top of the cliff, he beckoned Andy to follow him.

Andy looked up at the notches, seeing the topmost notch where the bandana had been lodged the day before. He proceeded up the ladder and came to an isolated ledge. There was a small alcove in the hillside with two long benches along the sides and another one along the back. It was a simple, unadorned hole in the side of the mountain.

Pliny sat on one bench and gestured for Andy to sit across from him.

“We have to talk about these things in isolation,” Pliny said in a very low voice. “I don’t think anyone’s followed us here, but you can never be sure.”

“How do you know they couldn’t hear us here?” Andy asked.

Pliny pointed to the ceiling above them. A large sigil etched into the stone ceiling glowed with faint rose-colored light.

“It’s one of the Order’s safe zones,” said Pliny. “It’s enchanted to keep sound contained.”

“Oh, nice,” Andy said.

“As a matter of fact, Morwen asked me to pull you aside up here if it came up and explain some basics about the Order of the Behemoth to you. She said she regretted not being able to discuss it with you yesterday. But her property has simply become too risky.”

“Yes, I asked her about the Order and didn’t realize we were being spied on…” Andy trailed off.

“Safest to assume you’re never alone there, not in the yard, not in the latrine… They’ve really ramped up their surveillance.”

“Who are they?” Andy asked. “The ratfolk?”

“Well, the ratfolk act as spies, but the ‘they’ I’m referring to are the nobility of Cresthaven, the Supreme Ministry.”

“And what do they have against Morwen?” Andy asked.

“Nothing against Morwen specifically, but they have a complicated relationship with the Order of the Behemoth, and they especially want to monitor *you*, since you’re a new Visitor and you’ve come into our orbit.”

Andy and Pliny sat in silence for a few moments. He considered the man’s words. The Supreme Ministry, the city’s governmental officials, were working against the Order of the Behemoth.

“Why?” Andy asked, finally. “Why is the Supreme Ministry so dead-set against Visitors joining the Order of the Behemoth?”

“It’s a long story,” Pliny said. “But I’ll tell you the short version.”

Andy leaned back against the alcove wall and brought his machete to rest on his lap, playing idly with the blade as Pliny began.

“About two hundred years ago, something called the Continental War occurred. The Supreme Minister at the time was vindictive and power-hungry, and the only thing that could satisfy his thirst for adulation was a show of force: a military campaign aimed at territorial expansion across the entire continent of Palima. To this day, we Behemoths refer to him as the Supreme Tyrant… Anyways, he raised taxes on the commonfolk, cutting what little comfort they enjoyed in order to bolster his army. He then mobilized all the military might he had at his disposal, which was considerable, and began conquering, pushing southward, leaving a wake of destruction in his path. There was misery at home and misery abroad. None of his advisors, none of his friends, none of his family members were capable of talking him out of it. He became singularly fixed on establishing a Palimanian Empire, and he, the Supreme Tyrant, would be its figurehead.”

“He just… wanted more land?”

“I believe that, in his mad mind, the Supreme Tyrant wanted respect and validation,” said Pliny. “A sick man with great power will do many terrible things in an attempt to earn recognition.”

Andy nodded.

“Well, in those days, a secretive order of **Fighters** rose up, the Order of the Behemoth. Some of the best fighters in the land joined forces with powerful Dissidents across the continent and staged a rebellion within the city itself, marshaling the power of the people to oust the Mad Tyrant. A mighty rebellion lasted ten days. The rebels were successful, but not before much bloodshed and pain.”

“So the people of Cresthaven overthrew their own king?”

“Yes,” said Pliny, “they overthrew their king. But they did not overthrow their entire system of government. Instead, they replaced the Supreme Tyrant with a new ruler, one who had more sympathies for the commonfolk. Over the years, more concessions have been made to the common class, and more taxation has been levied on the nobility to pay for common goods like public medical clinics, schoolhouses, and clean water works, largely thanks to pressure put on the Supreme Ministry by the Order of the Behemoth.”

“So, things are better now, then?”

“Yes,” said Pliny. “Unequivocally so. But the signs of the times are worrying. Because the people have forgotten the struggles of their ancestors, the Order’s numbers and influence are waning. Sure, the Order still has the sympathies of many of the laborers and commonfolk in the land. They enjoy access to medicine, to basic education, to food and water. As they should. As is their *right* as dignified citizens of this city. But our Order’s numbers are dwindling. A century ago, our headcount was in the thousands. Now it is barely one hundred.”

“That’s a big dip in recruitment,” Andy said.

“Indeed,” said Pliny.

“But I have to ask, if the Order succeeded in securing basic rights and services for the commonfolk, succeeded in establishing taxation for the nobility, and succeeded in stopping Cresthaven’s territorial expansion, then why is it necessary anymore?”

“It’s an understandable question, and it is one that many ask these days. Isn’t the Order an antiquated relic of a tyrannical era long gone?” Pliny said. “But this view relies on a fundamental ignorance. It is important to realize that everything could change in an instant. During the Continental War and the Ten-Day Rebellion, the people ousted their king, but they did not fundamentally change their system of government. The Supreme Minister still retains nearly unilateral power. There’s nothing stopping a new Supreme Minister from repeating history. Nothing except a unified resistance, which, up until the present day, the Order of the Behemoth has provided. But I fear for our future, and for the future of the city’s people.”

They sat in silence for a moment.

“How is the current Minister?” Andy asked.

“Supreme Minister Caines Crotias,” Pliny said, sighing. “To tell you the honest truth, he’s not so bad. He continues to fund the schoolhouses, the medical clinics, and the public works. He levies modest taxes on the commoner and higher taxes on the wealthy. He is not perfect, but he is fair-minded, if for no other reason than to avoid rocking the boat.”

“What’s the fear, then?” Andy asked.

“The fear is that he is elderly. His health and his mind are declining rapidly. We expect him to pass his reign to his son imminently. And his son, Sethor Crotias… he is a very, very different beast.” Pliny inhaled deeply before exhaling, letting his shoulders relax. “Without a robust Order of the Behemoth… well… I worry. That’s all I’ll say for now.”

Andy could tell that the conversation had taken a toll on Pliny. The man’s brow was now furrowed, and he was breathing a bit heavier than normal. He wasn’t lying. Whatever the specific nature of the danger, it was clear that, for Pliny at least, it was very real.

\*\*\*

“Order, please,” the Vigilant Superior said as she took her seat by the hearth. She had called the meeting of Captains and Guardians for this month, the latest in a series of discussions about how to solve the Order’s recruitment crisis.

Agatha was not naive, she knew that it was a tough sell to get **Fighters** to swear allegiance to a parapolitical organization and forgo full-time engagement with more lucrative private employment.

In the early days of the Order, private employment, even on the side, had been strictly forbidden for Order members in order to prevent bribery and corruption. But over the years, the strict ideals of the Order’s founders had given way to pragmatic realism. About fifty years ago, in her first year as Vigilant Superior, Agatha had lifted the prohibition on private employment. Now, Order members could complete contract jobs when they weren’t occupied with official Order business.

But one thing Agatha hadn’t seen coming: the overwhelming political success of the Order. Over the past two centuries, the Order of the Behemoth had made an enormous impact on Cresthaven’s political culture and the policies of the Supreme Ministry. The people enjoyed access to education, medicine, and food and water, paid for by taxes levied on the richest nobles. With the Ten Day Rebellion, the Order of the Behemoth had become an important political force, and for every decade since, they had reminded the rulers of Cresthaven that revolution was only a few missed meals away at any moment.

But now that the needs of the populace had been cared for, the populace had grown complacent. Complacency was hurting the Order’s recruitment efforts even more than the ban on private employment had in the past.

“Now,” Agatha said, rising to her feet and addressing the Guardians and Captains, each decked out in full armor. “Would each Guardian give an update on your recruitment efforts. How many candidates have you vetted, and what strategies have you found useful?”

A man in hide armor wielding a huge woodsman’s axe stood up. “Permission to report, your vigilance,” he said in a rumbly half-growl.

“Yes, Gar,” said Agatha. “Go ahead.”

“We’ve found some success by vetting potential recruits from the Firebrand Gym. Gerran, the gym’s owner, is friendly to our cause, and he has sent two recruits our way in the past three weeks. I expect one to make it to initiation.”

“Gerran has been helpful?” Agatha said.

“Very much so,” said Gar. “He runs a private gym and attracts many prospective **Fighters**, some of whom are even noble-born. He promotes our ideology and also happens to train some of the finest adventurers in the region.”

“I’ll be damned if we take help from a charlatan that bumps elbows with nobles,” came a voice from somewhere in the gathering.

“Please,” Agatha said, “do not speak out of turn. Do any of the other guardians have anything to report?”

No one stood up.

“Very well, what about my captains?”

There was silence as Agatha scanned the room. The four Guardians of the Order sat in the inner ring of the meeting, so the Captains crowding around the outer ring were obscured by shadow. “No one?”

“I may have something,” came a voice. Morwen stood up.

Agatha smiled. She had been hoping that Morwen would speak. “Yes, Morwen. Please share with us.”

“A Visitor has arrived at my Grove and his training is already well underway. He’s making significant progress and shows an interest in the Order…”

Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Really? A Visitor?” She had expected, based on her rudimentary **{divination}** spells and her nagging gut feeling, that Morwen would receive a new pupil soon. But she hadn’t expected it to be a Visitor, and she hadn’t expected the pupil’s interest in the Order to manifest so quickly. “And you’re not influencing his interest in the Order?”

“No, your vigilance,” said Morwen. “In fact, he tends to bring it up on his own more often than not. I am having a safe room installed soon so I can discuss Order business with him, with your permission of course.”

Agatha exhaled. Of *course* she wanted Morwen to discuss Order business with the recruit, but with the uptick in surveillance activity from the nobility, it was possible that this new Visitor had already been compromised.

“As Sethor’s reign approaches, the nobility’s surveillance of our activities has increased,” said Agatha. “I do not think that’s a coincidence. I fear treachery… Do you trust this Visitor?”

Morwen stood silent for a moment. “Yes,” she said. “I do. He came to me directly from Lilly, the **Scholar** at the Dawnspring Cottage, and she is friendly to us.”

Agatha hummed. It was almost too perfect. “Very well,” she said. “Familiarize him with the Order over the next few months. See how he responds.”

Morwen nodded. “Yes, your vigilance.”

I like that kind of challenge. From what I’ve seen, ESO feels like that same but in a first-person world, with harder combat, real character progression, and a huge map that actually rewards you for putting in effort. I’m not trying to play something just for fun and drop it in a week, I want a game I can grind properly, figure out, and stick with for a long time. 

Why I can’t just buy it myself.

I’m a student, and my family only sends me money for essentials food, travel, basic living stuff. They don’t budget a single extra rupee for games or “fun.” Even though ESO is just $4 on Steam right now, that still falls outside what I’m allowed to spend. It’s not about the price being huge; it’s about me simply not having any personal spending money beyond weekly expenses.

So yeah... I’m not begging for some luxury edition or a $70 title. I’m asking for a game that’s literally cheaper than a coffee, but means a lot to me as someone who actually cares about these kinds of games.

If anyone’s feeling generous while it’s on sale, your gift would genuinely go to someone who will actually play, appreciate, and grind the hell out of it.

Thanks for reading.

The birthday person isn’t a huge coffee fan, so I’m hoping for something not too espresso-forward. The last time we tried a tiramisu from Whole Foods, it was way too soaked in coffee, and it didn’t go over well 😅 Ideally, I’d like something easy to get to from Oakridge/41st, but I’m open to a short trip anywhere in Vancouver if it’s worth it. Budget is roughly $50, give or take. I’ve been looking at a few options like Gateau de Henry or Zeeka, and I’ve heard good things about Costco, Saint Germain, and Breka, though I haven’t tried them yet. I even briefly thought about ordering from online just to see what’s out there. So has anyone tried a full tiramisu cake in Vancouver that actually tastes amazing? I’m hoping for one that holds up for a whole cake, not just single portions, and that people will genuinely love. Any hidden gems or favorites would be a huge help. Thanks in advance!

I've always used the official white 185 filters from Kalita, purchased on Amazon. Well, they started clogging every time, and at first I adjusted the grind, I blamed Ethiopian beans, I cleaned the Kalita, bought a brand new Kalita dripper, I tried not to rinse the filter too aggressively, and I avoided over-agitation. Nothing helped. You know what gave it away that it was the filters all along? They clog before even adding coffee -- That's right, the rinse water doesn't even fully drip out on its own.

I switched to the generic unbleached filters they sell on Amazon, and it's like I have my Kalita back. Brews are finally back under 4 minutes, and the taste is back where it should be.

So what is going on with Kalita filters? I'll bet I came to the revelation late -- My filters are older stock, since I've been buying large 3-pack supplies off Amazon and only drinking one cup per day.

So anyway, I never thought I would, but I recommend the generic unbleached ones they sell on Amazon. Unbleached is better anyway.",2,1770663827.0,pourover,4,1.0,False

Let’s be real for a second. The ""Direct-to-Consumer"" aligner bubble has burst. Companies like Smile Direct Club went bankrupt, leaving thousands of people with unfinished treatments, messed up bites, and zero refunds.

**If you pay cheap, you pay twice.**

I see families in **Pembroke Pines, Hollywood, and Weston** trying to save a buck on their kids' teeth, only to spend double fixing the damage later.

You don't need a ""dental mill."" You need predictable results. At **SMILE-FX® Orthodontics in Miramar**, we are the exclusive regional providers of **OrthoFX®**.

Here is the no-BS breakdown of why this tech is crushing the old way of doing things, and why we are the top choice for Broward County.

***

## 🚀 The OrthoFX® Difference (The ""Grand Slam"" Offer)

Most clear aligners (Invisalign® mills or knock-offs) require 22+ hours of wear. That’s a nightmare for active teens or busy professionals.

**OrthoFX® flipped the script:**

*   **12-Hour Wear Time:** The **AirFlex™** polymer is FDA-cleared for just 12 hours/day. Wear it at night + a few hours after school/work. Done.
*   **HyperElastic™ Tech:** 50% less wear time, way less pain. It applies optimal force without crushing your roots.
*   **AI Monitoring (FXOnTrack™):** We track your progress remotely. You drive to Miramar less, we fix your teeth faster.
*   **Stain Resistant:** Coffee drinkers in Weston, rejoice. The **FXBright™** material resists yellowing.

## 🥊 The Showdown: SMILE-FX® vs. Mail-Order Failures

Stop gambling with your face. Here is the data:

| Feature | OrthoFX® at SMILE-FX® | Direct-to-Consumer (SDC/Byte) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Supervision** | Board-Certified Orthodontist (In-person) | DIY / None (Ghosted by doctors) |
| **Wear Time** | **12 Hours (AirFlex™)** | 22+ Hours (Painful compliance) |
| **Retention** | High (Root control) | Poor (Relapse common) |
| **Material** | Stain-Resistant HyperElastic™ | Cheap Plastic (Stains easily) |
| **Safety** | 3D Scanned & Monitored | Bankruptcy & Horror Stories |

## 🧠 Rapid Fire FAQs (What You Actually Want to Know)

**Q: Is this actually good for teens?**
**A:** Yes. The ""remove for sports"" feature is huge for athletes at Aspen Track Club or high school varsity players. Plus, 12-hour wear means they actually wear them.

**Q: Can kids get this early?**
**A:** Absolutley. We follow AAO guidelines—screen by age 7. We have Phase 1 options to prevent massive issues later.

**Q: How much does it cost?**
**A:** It varies by case complexity (mild vs. major). But unlike DTC brands that hide fees, we offer flexible financing.

**Q: Why not just go to my general dentist?**
**A:** General dentists are great at cleaning teeth. Orthodontists are specialists in *moving* bone. We use next-gen polymers. They usually use older tech. Don't compromise.

1r0czqv,https://i.redd.it/o8ztobc5niig1.jpeg,Como fazer cupping em casa,"Fala pessoal, tudo certo?

Neste post vou abordar como fazer a famosa **prova de café ou cupping**. A ideia aqui não é trazer o protocolo técnico oficial, mas sim um pouco de história junto a um guia prático para vocês conheçam melhor os cafés que estão comprando e saibam avaliá-los em casa de forma educativa e prazerosa.

Antes do cupping se tornar padrão, o café era avaliado quase que inteiramente pela aparência dos grãos (classificação física), o que gerava problemas constantes. Afinal, grãos bonitos também podem resultar numa xícara ruim. Diante disso, o cupping se popularizou no final do século XIX como uma forma conveniente de garantir que o café não estivesse estragado ou com gosto de mofo (o famoso *rio* ou *rio zona*) durante o processo de compra e venda.

A técnica foi desenvolvida para para avaliar cafés de forma justa e prática visando eliminar as variáveis e possíveis dificuldades no método de preparo (filtro de papel, pressão, técnica de despejo, etc). Diante disto, a infusão foi a solução perfeita para padronizar o processo.

Apesar de ser uma prática centenária, o cupping só foi formalizado com as regras atuais no final dos anos 90, com a fundação do *Cup Of Excellence* (1999) e as diretrizes da SCA (*Specialty Coffee Association*).

Portanto, a prova de xícara(cupping) garante:

* **Consistência e padronização:** Garante que o lote não tem defeito de forma simples e objetiva.
* **Identificação de defeitos:** Como a técnica elimina variáveis que poderiam gerar incônsistencia, qualquer defeito no café fica mais fácil de se identificar.
* **Definição de preço:** Cafés com pontuação mais alta valem mais.

**Duas curiosidades rápidas:**

1. No Brasil, o termo tradicional sempre foi ""Prova de xícara"". O termo ""Cupping"" virou moda recentemente com a ""terceira onda"" e a globalização das normas SCA.
2. A famosa sucção/aspiração (aquela ""sugada"" barulhenta) serve para aerar o líquido e espalhar a bebida por toda a boca. Isso explode a percepção nas papilas gustativas e manda os aromas para o olfato retronasal.

# O que você vai precisar (Mise en place)

Para garantir uma boa sessão em casa, vamos aos cuidados básicos:

* **Bowls/tigelas/copos idênticos**: preferencialmente de vidro/cerâmica idênticos e sem cores chamativas que podem induzir percepções sensoriais (capacidade de 150 a 250ml);
* **Prova cega (Opcional mas recomendado):** Marque os copos/locais que eles vão ficar com códigos para não saber qual café é qual. Isso evita que você seja influenciado pela embalagem bonita ou pela marca famosa e possibilita que você identifique-os posteriormente;
* **Recipiente para limpeza:** 1 ou 2 copos com água quente para limpar as colheres entre cada passada nas xícaras para evitar contaminação cruzada;
* **Cusparada (Opcional):** Um copo extra caso não queira ingerir toda a cafeína e ficar ligadão
* **Colheres:** De sopa, funda, ou as específicas de cupping.
* **Caderno/App:** Anote tudo!
* **Cronômetro, Balança e Moedor.**

# Parâmetros:

Aqui entra a parte onde você pode escolher o nível de ""nerdice"". Vou deixar duas opções para vocês:

**OPÇÃO 1: A Recomendação da Casa (Para curtir)** *Focada num ratio mais curto que irá facilitar a percepção das notas, corpo e doçura. Inclusive está é a proporção que a Astral recomenda para a nossa dinâmica.*

* **Ratio:** 1:15 (Ex: 10g de café para 150ml de água)
* **Moagem:** Média (similar ao que você usa para V60 ou Melitta).
* **Resultado:** Um café mais potente, fácil de identificar as notas principais se você não tem o paladar treinado.

**OPÇÃO 2: O Padrão SCA (Para os puristas/técnicos)** *Focada em clareza e padronização mundial.*

* **Ratio:** 1:18 (Ex: 8,25g de café para 150ml de água).
* **Moagem:** Média-grossa (lembra sal grosso marinho, um pouco mais grossa que pro V60).
* **Resultado:** Café mais diluído e delicado. De acordo com o protocolo oficial, essa diluição maior facilita encontrar defeitos e notas sutis (florais/ácidas), mas pode parecer ""fraco"" ou flat para paladares não treinados. Desta forma, recomendo fortemente a primeira opção.

**Referência de Moagem (Ajuste conforme a opção escolhida):**

* **Timemore C2:** Click 20 a 22
* **Timemore C3:** Click 13 a 15
* **MHW-3Bomber Blade R3:** 90 a 100 clicks
* **Kingrinder K6:** 90 a 100 clicks
* **Comandante C40:** 24 a 26 Clicks
* **1zpresso K-Plus/Ultra:** 6.0 a 7.0
* **1zpresso ZP6 Special:** 4.0 a 5.0

*Obs: Moedores descalibram, é importante conferir o zero e recalibrá-lo se necessário.*

# Setado os parâmetros, vamos a execução:

1. **Aqueça a água:** Mire em 93°C a 95°C. Se não tiver controle, ferva e espere 1 minutinho.
2. **Moagem e Fragrância:** Moa as amostras nos potes. Dê uma leve chacoalhada e cheire o pó seco imediatamente. Anote a **sua** percepção (Não se preocupe com termos técnicos. (doce? frutado? nozes?). Não demore mais de 15 min aqui para não perder os aromas voláteis.
3. **A Infusão:** Dispare o cronômetro e despeje a água com vigor (para molhar todo o pó) até a borda.
4. **Aroma (Crust):** Cheire a ""crosta"" que se formou em cima. O aroma muda com a água quente.
5. **A Espera (4 min):** Aguarde 4 minutos. Não mexa! A crosta protege o café e ajuda na infusão.
   * *Nota:* A formação da crosta depende de muitos fatores, caso a mesma não se forme, n se preocupe.
6. **A Quebra (Break):** Ao completar 4 minutos, aproxime o nariz do pote. Com a colher, empurre a crosta 3 vezes (fundo para superfície) devagar. **Esse é o momento mais aromático do cupping!** Aproveite.
7. **Limpeza:** Use duas colheres para retirar a espuma/crema que sobrou boiando. Essa espuma guarda óleos que podem amargar a bebida. Limpe bem até ficar um ""espelho"" negro.
8. **A Prova:** Espere esfriar um pouco! Comece a provar lá pelos **7-8 minutos** (ou quando estiver confortável).
   * Aspire (faça o barulho, sem vergonha!) para oxigenar.
   * Passe pela língua.
   * Cuspa ou engula.
   * **Quente:** Avaliamos sabor e retrogosto.
   * **Morno:** A acidez e o corpo ficam mais nítidos.
   * **Frio:** A doçura (ou defeitos) aparecem de vez.
   * *Repare como o café muda drasticamente do quente para o frio!*

E aí pessoal, curtiram? Vamos usar esse guia para avaliar os nanolotes da dinâmica. Desta forma, garantimos que todo mundo está ""falando a mesma língua"" na hora de comparar.

1r0cza6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r0cza6,Kitchen remodel,"Hello Community! My wife and recently moved into our house and are trying to find a path to update our kitchen based on the current layout. There is space to add on to the kitchen outside (past the bay window) but that will likely push way over our budget (estimating myself at $100k plus). We have a very odd layout, with very limited counter space and cabinet space. We’ve included photos within the post of the current layout as well as an estimated (90% to scale) of what we can think of for a proposed layout change using the magicplan app. 

Any thoughts and recommendations would be appreciated! We know to move the pipping for the sink / fridge / stove will incur additional costs, but underneath our kitchen is an unfinished basement so we are hoping that will limit the damage in costs there. My wife isn’t fond of the additional cabinets / coffee bar area proposed in the middle bottom part of the layout screenshot, but its the only was I can think of adding more space. 

Only other option without tearing down walls would be to extend the counter where the dishwasher is in the blueprint to have more of a peninsula type feel?

Again, any suggestions would be appreciated, thank you!!",1,1770663440.0,kitchenremodel,7,1.0,False

My work depends a lot on the mood I wake up with or how my morning goes.

My morning ritual is grinding my own coffee beans. When I grind them, the aroma spreads throughout the kitchen. I buy this coffee at a local Vietnamese cafe. It’s very energizing, so I don’t drink more than one or two cups throughout the day.

Next, it’s important for me to watch a podcast. Not about work, but one where friends or acquaintances just talk in a human way. This sets me up for talking to my clients. I don’t want to be a ""dry"" expert for them; I want to be a person who is simply pleasant to deal with.

I want them to feel my positive energy or if the person is not in a positive mood, my support, understanding, and empathy.

1r0cuh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/solopassions/comments/1r0cuh6/just_booked_my_first_solo_trip_and_feeling/,Just booked my first solo trip and feeling overwhelmed: (Here's how I'm staying on a tight budget without sacrificing experiences) 🌍,"That ""OMG I just booked it!"" high lasted about an hour after I hit confirm on my flights. Then the *real* feeling hit: a mix of pure excitement and a hefty dose of ""OMG what have I done and how am I paying for this?!"" panic. My first solo trip, and the budget was already looking tighter than a drum. For a long time, I thought solo travel was a luxury reserved for gap-year students with trust funds or digital nomads making six figures. But I'm neither of those things. I'm just someone who wanted to see a bit of the world without breaking the bank, and without waiting for someone else's schedule to align.

So, here's how I'm planning to navigate my upcoming 8-day solo adventure to **Lisbon, Portugal**, without sacrificing the experience, even with a pretty tight wallet:

*   **The Flight Hunt: Patience is Key (and Incognito Mode Helps)**
    *   My flight was, predictably, the biggest upfront cost. I spent weeks tracking prices, playing with dates, and using multiple flight comparison sites in incognito mode. I aimed for a Tuesday departure and a Wednesday return, which often shave off some euros. While I won't list the exact cost (as it varies wildly by origin), I waited for a window where prices dipped to what I considered ""acceptable"" for my budget.
    *   **Pro Tip:** Don't just check one airline or one date. Be flexible by a day or two on either end, and look at different departure/arrival airports if possible.

*   **Accommodation: Hostel Life, But Make it Smart**
    *   I've booked a bed in a highly-rated **dorm room** at a central hostel in the Baixa district. It's about **€25-€30 per night**. Yeah, it's a dorm, but the hostel has great reviews for cleanliness, security, and a social common area.
    *   **Why it works:** Hostels are fantastic for solo travelers. Not only are they budget-friendly, but they're built for meeting people. I'm hoping to connect with fellow travelers for a dinner or a day trip, saving money and boosting my experience. I chose one with individual lockers for peace of mind.

*   **Food: Embrace the Local, Ditch the Tourist Traps**
    *   My daily food budget is around **€20-€25**. This sounds tiny, but it's doable in Lisbon.
    *   **Strategy:**
        *   **Breakfast:** Often included at hostels, or I'll grab some local pastries (pastéis de nata for less than €2!) and coffee.
        *   **Lunch:** Street food, small *tascas* (traditional Portuguese eateries) away from the main squares, or picking up ingredients from a local *mercado* to make a sandwich. *Bifanas* (pork sandwiches) are cheap and delicious!
        *   **Dinner:** One sit-down meal at a local spot (think grilled fish or a hearty stew for €10-€15), or a mix of groceries and snacks. I plan to take advantage of hostel kitchen facilities a few nights.
    *   **Drink Smart:** Skip the pricey cocktails in tourist zones. Enjoy a local beer (*Super Bock* or *Sagres*) for a few euros, or grab a bottle of wine from a supermarket to share at the hostel.

*   **Activities: Free is My Favorite Price**
    *   Lisbon is incredibly walkable and full of free sights. My activity budget is about **€10-€15 per day**.
    *   **What I'm doing:**
        *   **Free walking tours:** Tipping is encouraged, but the tours themselves are a great way to get oriented and learn history.
        *   **Exploring neighborhoods:** Alfama, Bairro Alto, Chiado – just wandering and getting lost (in a good way!).
        *   **Viewpoints (Miradouros):** Lisbon is famous for its hills and stunning views, all free.
        *   **Public transport:** I'll get a Viva Viagem card for the metro, trams (including the iconic Tram 28!), and buses. It's efficient and cheap.
        *   **Museums:** Many museums have free entry days or specific hours. I've noted down when I can visit some for free or at a reduced rate.

**Real Talk Moment:**
Honestly, the biggest challenge isn't just the money. It's the little whispers of doubt. *Will I get lonely? Will I get lost? Will I manage to communicate?* There's also the surprise factor. I know I'll probably splurge on an extra *pastel de nata* (or five) and I fully expect to get turned around a few times on those hilly streets. I'm also ready for those moments of quiet introspection that solo travel brings – the good and the slightly melancholic. It's all part of the experience, learning to be self-reliant and adaptable. My biggest lesson so far has been realizing that **a tight budget forces you to engage more deeply with the local culture**, rather than just skimming the surface with expensive tours and fancy meals. It pushes you out of your comfort zone in the best possible way.

I sometimes get a sense of reward from getting things done and other times it’s like today.   For context I’m a SAHM right now of an infant and a preschooler, my preschooler is also AuDHD.   Our house is clean but has a lot of clutter in the form of outgrown baby clothes and toys.   I’m currently ill with something and can only eat liquid diet so I’m very hangry.  I also have some undiagnosed chronic illness and wake up sore most days and it also had neuro symptoms and I can be quite clumsy.

Normally my mom goal is to focus on bonding with be children as my first priority and letting the clutter go or working on it when I can.   I’m pretty obsessive about things being sanitary but I have a super hard time with comprehending what to do about stuff that piles up.

For some reason I’ve been hard on myself the last week about it so today I think okay good I’m going to LARP as someone who is bothered by clutter and wants to sort it!  The motivation was to dig out some clothes in the next size up for the baby to wear so I don’t have to buy more.   That is a real motive and I’m glad I did that but this is how it goes for me:

Wake up super sore

Take Tylenol

Have my protein shake and coffee

Give older kid breakfast and baby milk and change him

Start sorting through clean laundry pile

Yay I found a few outfits that will fit him

Sort other old clothes into outgrown pile

Some for resale and some for give away

Sad now bc I’m probably not well enough to have more babies even though I wish we could

Start to be mad at self for not having sorted clothes earlier

Extremely annoyed that the pile of clothes to resell is so big bc now I’m utterly overwhelmed thinking about how long it will take to post every single item for sale and how annoying it will be to pack and sort them and also what if no one buys them and also do we have envelopes and tape and also is it even worth the time?

Want to cry bc I feel like a POS for having let this task pile up

Want to cry bc all the baby small clothes aren’t being saved for another baby

Get a small pile to wash and so angry at self bc it barely made a dent and actually makes the room look messier than before

Extremely angry that this task will take weeks and until then it will look like nothing is getting done.  Hear my late dad’s voice yelling at me which was basically my executive function growing up.   Also I had a housekeeper and I wasn’t permitted to clean so that’s a whole thing.

Take kids downstairs.  Preschooler has meltdown so let her eat in room.

Feel like bc I set my mind to “clean” mode I’m not as good or patient w my kids.

I’m extremely clumsy and stub toes and elbow at least once.

Baby knocks over my drink and his own food and normally I’m really patient but I got upset today bc I’m already so mad at myself

Try to potty train preschooler who is way past old enough but totally refused and then beat myself up for not having taught her.

By now it’s midday and my Tylenol is wearing off and I’m just filled with anger at myself and soreness and totally on edge.

Cannot relax let the baby nap but now all I can think about is clothes aren’t sorted or donated or sold and I barely made a dent in the pile and preschooler’s room needs work but I’m so hangry and on edge and in pain that I need to eat something even though I can’t eat and I’m in chronic pain.

Anxiety about what if my illness is actually serious and I die and regret being all tense and on edge about some dumb clothes.

Now I look around and only see clutter?  Like I was fine with most of it before bc I’m okay with lots of books and toys but it’s like being extremely harsh on myself is the only motivation I have to get it done so now I can’t relax and feel ok which sucks bc this process is going to take a while.

The only thing I feel is stress soreness regret for having put myself on edge and I get NO satisfaction from working on a large project that will take a long time.  The only thing I feel is total embarrassment at having tried to start something and the first step barely getting anything done and then total burnout and overstimulation and regret at having bothered bc I should have just been playing in case I die.   I am not getting any sense of accomplishment or relief bc everything is still cluttered and now I have to face even more work plus the massive shame that I’ve put it off.   The only good feeling right now is I found some clothes that will fit the baby today.  So obviously my ability to delay gratification is off.

I’m currently just totally overwhelmed in a sensory way and trying not to cry.     I need to immediately get back to the mindset that I’m allowed to exist and have self esteem even if my house isn’t perfect.

I just really don’t know how to get things like thisdone without beating myself up first.

I don’t know how people can feel good about doing mindless things.   I might not even bother again until I can eat again.   I’m just so tired and yes waking up sore all over is part of it.     I just really wish I could also do things and be in a good mood with parenting but instead I’m on edge and we all have to take a break now.

This is mostly just a rant about why it’s so hard to do things.   I once told a therapist about how I go through all of this mentally over just cleaning and putting away clothes and she said she was exhausted just hearing me talk about it. I mean yeah? So what am I supposed to do?  Nothing works.

I don’t want advice at all btw I’m just venting bc I’m so tired of the world saying there’s some sense of pride in getting things done.  I get that from things I’m interested in sometimes but not this.   Idk if anyone knows but it’s very trendy for online moms to humble brag about how they can’t stand clutter and they love purging and throwing stuff out so that’s another way I feel out of place.",5,1770663114.0,AuDHDWomen,0,1.0,False

Box. The math on why ""cheap"" aligners are costing you thousands. 🦷📉

We need to have a serious conversation.

If you live in **Miramar, Pembroke Pines, or anywhere in Broward**, you’ve probably seen the ads. You know the ones. *""Straighten your teeth for $80/month! No doctors! No visits!""*

It sounds great. Until it isn't.

Over the last 5 years, giants like **SmileDirectClub and Byte have faced bankruptcy or massive lawsuits**. Why? Because moving bone (which is what orthodontics is) without a doctor looking at your roots is a recipe for disaster.

I’ve dug into the clinical reality at **SMILE-FX Orthodontics** here in Miramar, and the gap between ""Mail-Order"" and ""OrthoFX"" isn't a gap. It's a canyon.

Here is the breakdown of why the ""Amazon Prime"" model of dentistry is failing, and why smart families are switching to hybrid tech like OrthoFX.

***

### 1. The ""Cheap"" Illusion (Read This)

Most people play the short game. They see a lower sticker price and buy.

**The Reality:** Teeth move in 3D. Direct-to-consumer brands use AI to guess how your teeth will move.
*   **Best case:** Your teeth don't track, and you waste $2k.
*   **Worst case:** You ruin your bite, cause bone loss, and have to pay a local orthodontist $6k+ to fix the damage.

**The Fix:** Real orthodontists (like the board-certified team at SMILE-FX) use **OrthoFX**. This isn't just plastic in a bag. It involves:
*   3D diagnostic imaging (roots + bone).
*   Real-time monitoring.
*   **Actual humans** adjusting the plan when your biology doesn't match the algorithm.

> **Rule of thumb:** If you can't text your doctor when your tooth hurts, you aren't a patient. You're a customer.

***

### 2. The Lifestyle Problem: 22 Hours vs. 12 Hours

This is the feature that actually matters for your daily life.

**Old School / Mail-Order:**
Requires **22 hours of wear per day**.
*   That means talking with a lisp in meetings.
*   Taking them out awkwardly on dates.
*   Starving yourself because it’s too annoying to unclip them to eat.

**The OrthoFX AirFlex™ System:**
The first FDA-cleared aligner designed for **12 hours of wear**.
*   Wear them at night + a few hours in the evening.
*   **Go to work/school aligner-free.**
*   Zero impact on your social life, coffee habits, or athletic events.

If you are a busy professional in Weston or a student in Cooper City, this time savings is worth the price of admission alone.

***

### 3. The Tech Stack (It’s Not Just Plastic)

Mail-order companies cut corners on materials to keep margins high. OrthoFX uses **HyperElastic™ polymer**. High-level engineering terms aside, here is what that means for you:

*   **40% Less Pain:** It delivers consistent force without the ""tightening"" spike of pain.
*   **Stain Resistant:** Drink your cafecito. It won't turn your aligners yellow.
*   **FXOnTrack™:** You don't need to drive to the office constantly. You scan remotely, the doctor checks it, and you keep moving. It’s the convenience of remote care *with* the safety of a doctor.

***

### The Bottom Line

You get one set of teeth.

Don't gamble your smile on a company that might file for bankruptcy halfway through your treatment.

**SMILE-FX** in Miramar combines the tech (OrthoFX) with the safety (Board-Certified Orthodontists).

*   ✅ 12-hour wear options.
*   ✅ No ""ghosting"" by customer support.
*   ✅ A bite that actually functions when you're done.

**Stop trying to DIY your healthcare.**

If you’re ready to actually fix your smile without the risk, go see the team at SMILE-FX.

1r0cpe4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Datingat21st/comments/1r0cpe4/how_to_text_guys_without_looking_desperate_the/,How to Text Guys Without Looking Desperate: The Psychology Behind Messages That Actually Work,"So I've been deep in the weirdest rabbit hole lately. Started with a breakup, spiraled into analyzing every text I've ever sent, and somehow ended up reading actual psychological research on digital communication patterns. Wild journey.

Here's what nobody tells you: texting anxiety isn't just in your head. There's actual science behind why we overthink every word, every emoji, every response time. Turns out our brains literally can't handle the ambiguity of text communication, we evolved for face to face interaction where we could read body language and tone. Remove those cues and suddenly your nervous system treats a ""k"" response like a threat signal.

I pulled this from relationship psychology research, communication studies, some honestly brilliant dating coaches, and yeah, way too many hours on YouTube at 2am. But the patterns are fascinating once you see them.

**The ""I'm busy having a life"" text works because of scarcity principle.** When you message someone about something genuinely interesting you're doing, not asking what THEY'RE doing or fishing for attention, it flips the dynamic completely. ""Just tried this new climbing gym and absolutely ate shit on the easiest wall"" beats ""hey what's up"" every single time. You're demonstrating you have your own world that's entertaining without them. Psychologically this triggers curiosity and mild FOMO. They want access to your interesting life, not to be your entertainment committee.

The book **[Attached by Amir Levine](https://www.amazon.com/Attached-Science-Adult-Attachment-YouFind/dp/1585429139)** breaks down why this matters so much. Levine's a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at Columbia, and this book legit changed how I see all my relationships. It explains attachment styles in romantic relationships, basically how your early experiences shape whether you're secure, anxious, or avoidant in love. The texting thing connects directly because anxious texters are usually seeking reassurance while avoidant people pull back from too much contact. Understanding your pattern stops you from spiraling. This book will make you question every relationship you've ever had and it's uncomfortably accurate.

**The ""I saw this and thought of you"" text leverages something called spontaneous thought disclosure.** Research shows that when someone learns you were thinking about them unprompted, it creates a reciprocal intimacy response. But here's the key, it has to be specific and genuine. ""This song reminded me of that story you told about your weird uncle"" works. ""Thinking of you :)"" is basically white noise. You're showing you actually listen and retain details about their life, which signals investment without neediness.

There's this AI learning app called **[BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450)** that actually pulls together insights from relationship psychology books, research papers, and dating experts into personalized audio content. You can tell it something like ""help me understand attachment styles in texting"" or ""become more confident in dating communication,"" and it creates a custom learning plan based on your specific situation.

What makes it different is you control the depth, either a quick 10 minute overview or a 40 minute deep dive with real examples and research details. The voice options are genuinely addictive too, there's this smoky, slightly sarcastic tone that somehow makes relationship psychology way more digestible. It connects dots between different sources, like how Levine's attachment research relates to modern texting dynamics, pulling from its database of psychology books, expert interviews, and dating coaches. Makes it easier to actually internalize this stuff instead of just reading about it once and forgetting.

**The playful challenge text taps into something called benign masochism.** Sounds weird but it's legit, humans are attracted to mild challenges and playful antagonism in the right context. ""You definitely couldn't beat me at mini golf"" or ""I'm calling bullshit on your claim that you make the best pasta"" creates engagement through light conflict. It's flirty because it assumes familiarity and creates an excuse to meet up and ""settle"" the debate. Way more effective than ""would you maybe want to hang out sometime if you're free.""

The **Matthew Hussey stuff** is actually solid here. He's got a YouTube channel that breaks down communication psychology in dating without the pickup artist creepiness. His whole thing is about confidence through clarity, understanding what you actually want and communicating it without games. One video that hit different was about how waiting to text back to seem busy is actually just creating more anxiety for yourself. If you want to respond, respond. The right person won't be counting minutes.

**The ""I need to cancel but here's when I'm free instead"" text shows respect for both people's time.** This one's huge. When plans fall through and you just apologize without offering an alternative, you're essentially saying ""I don't value this enough to reschedule."" But when you cancel AND immediately suggest another specific time, you're demonstrating that seeing them matters, circumstances just got in the way. The specificity is critical. ""Let's reschedule soon"" reads as polite dismissal. ""I can't do Thursday but I'm free Sunday afternoon, want to grab coffee at 2?"" shows actual intent.

Here's what changed everything for me though. I stopped treating texts like some strategic game I needed to win and started using them as a filter. If someone consistently makes you anxious, leaves you on read, gives you breadcrumbs of attention, that's data. Not about your worth but about their availability and interest level. Secure people in healthy dynamics don't play weird texting games because they don't need to.

The **[Insight Timer](https://insighttimer.com/)** app has some genuinely helpful meditations specifically for relationship anxiety and attachment stuff. I know that sounds like I'm telling you to meditate your problems away but genuinely, the ""Loving Kindness for Difficult Relationships"" ones help interrupt the spiral when you're staring at your phone waiting for a response and catastrophizing.

Real talk, most texting advice is solving for the wrong problem. The issue isn't what words to use, it's usually that you're trying to force connection with someone who isn't matching your energy. The best text strategy is being genuinely interested in your own life, communicating clearly without games, and being willing to walk away from people who make simple communication feel like advanced calculus.

Your anxiety around texting isn't a character flaw. It's your nervous system trying to navigate a communication medium humans weren't designed for. Give yourself some grace, stop reading into every punctuation choice, and remember that anyone worth your time will appreciate straightforward communication over manufactured mystery.",1,1770662850.0,Datingat21st,0,1.0,False

* Have you ever wondered about the lives of the people who were here before you? At West Point on the Eno, explore the complex histories of our own backyard. West Point on the Eno is not your typical historical site. It's not a battleground for major wars, nor the birthplace of presidents. Instead, it's a vivid tapestry of everyday yet extraordinary lives from Durham's past. Here, the routine of mill workers, the creativity of people like photographer Hugh Mangum, and the stories within the historic house are discovered and shared. These are tales of ordinary people whose lives, like yours, are extraordinary in their own right. Discover a different kind of history at West Point on the Eno, where the extraordinary is found in the ordinary. Take a guided walking tour of West Point on the Eno's historic park.
* Tours leave on the hour at 12 pm, 1 pm, 2 pm, and 3 pm. Registration is required. Dogs are allowed on hikes but are not permitted inside historic buildings unless a registered service animal.

[**Jordan Abdur-Ra’oof Exhibition: Life of Service**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/jordan-abdur-raoof-exhibition-life-of-service/) at **Durham Visitor Information Center 🫶**

* Photographer Jordan Abdur-Ra’oof has transformed the Visitor Info Center to an ode to Durham hospitality. His exhibition, [Life is Service](https://www.lifeisservice.space/), highlights community, connection, and hospitality, showcasing people from beloved local businesses. Add a stop to the Visitor Info Center to check off a [Love Durham](https://www.discoverdurham.com/love-durham/) spot as part of the Creative Challenge!
* The Visitor Info Center is open every Tuesday-Saturday, 10am-5pm.
* Free
* Through Feb. 28

[**Hoopla**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/hoopla/) at **Golden Belt Artists**

* The bigger the hoops, the more influential the person. Taking up physical space has always been powerful— especially in a world where political space is limited. Internationally published artist Perrin Marie is creating a series of hoop skirts and accessories adorned with recycled materials that make noise— not always just a gentle swish swish, but the clink of bottles, the chime of cans, and a whole lot of presence. It's a fashionable revolution. Through this work, Perrin empowers individuals to take up space, skirt the issues, and make HOOPLA (get it?).
* Mid-Show Reception: February 20
* Closing Reception: March 20
* Through March 31
* Free

[**Winter**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/winter-at-5-points-gallery-members-exhibit/) at **5 Points Gallery**

* 5 Points Gallery is pleased to present Winter at 5 Points: Gallery Members Exhibit, bringing together new and recent works from the gallery’s member artists in a winter presentation shaped by distinct voices, materials, and ways of seeing. The exhibition moves from intuitive and outsider-influenced expressions to layered abstraction, imaginative figurative scenes, nature-inspired painting, fused glass work, and the refined craftsmanship of finely made furniture. Subtle threads of empowerment, heritage, connection to the natural world, and messages of peace and care for others emerge throughout, creating a sense of continuity across otherwise varied practices. Seen together, these works invite viewers to linger and experience the depth and richness of the artists’ creative worlds.
* Join in for the Third Friday Reception on January 16 from 6–9pm as part of Durham’s Third Friday Art Walk. Meet the artists and experience this seasonal exhibition.
* Visit 5 Points Gallery in person or online. All work from the exhibition is available for shipping or pickup. Gallery hours are Thursdays and Fridays 5–9pm and Saturdays 1–9pm. Artists are available to talk about their work.
* Free
* January 16-Feb 14

[**Art Exhibit — Dis/orient: Contemporary Art of the Asian Diaspora**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/art-exhibit-dis-orient-contemporary-art-of-the-asian-diaspora/) at **Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University**

* A focused exhibition that examines how artists of Asian descent confront long-standing stereotypes embedded in the word “Orient.” Rooted in Western imperialism, the term historically enforced a sense of distance and “otherness” that continues to shape cultural perceptions today. Dis/orient brings together artists who use humor, memory, tradition, and personal narrative to challenge this legacy and illuminate the richness and multiplicity of the Asian diaspora.
* “Dis/orient invites viewers to look beyond the flattened idea of a single ‘Orient’ and instead appreciate the complexity, humor, and emotional depth that define contemporary Asian diasporic art,” said Julianne Miao, curatorial associate at the Nasher Museum. “Each artist brings a distinct perspective, reminding us that identity is never monolithic. It is lived, questioned, and continually reshaped.”
* Tu-Sa 10 a.m.-5 p.m., Su 12-5 p.m.
* January 4- July 19

[**Art Exhibition — Labor&Materials and The Intuitionist**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/exhibition-opening-reception-labor-materials-and-the-intuitionist-2/) at **21c Museum Hotel Durham**

I had slick design, strong branding, and what I *thought* was killer content. But four months in, I was staring at analytics that barely budged. I poured coffee, squinted at charts, and checked my server logs like a detective hunting a missing person only my missing traffic was nowhere in sight.

My friend, a seasoned marketer, finally asked: *“Can people actually find you?”* That word stuck — **findability**, the idea that something can genuinely be found by the people who need it. Turns out, it’s not just a buzzword; it’s the whole game. The core of modern web visibility is about being *discoverable*, not just present online.

I learned that findability isn’t just about showing up in Google rankings it’s about being the answer when someone *asks*. Today’s search landscape isn’t a simple list of links. AI Overviews and generative answers are becoming front and center, giving people direct answers without clicking through. If your content isn’t crafted as a *clear answer*, it gets skipped even if it’s good.

So I dove into SEO properly real keyword research, on-page optimization, and restructuring my content so it answered specific questions. But then came Reddit. I’d always ignored it, thinking of it as chaotic comment threads and memes. Then I saw posts from strangers real people asking real questions about the exact niche I write about and with top-ranked Reddit threads showing up in search results and even AI summaries.

Suddenly Reddit wasn’t a distraction it was *findability*. I started engaging genuinely: answering threads, sharing help, not links. My posts slowly gained karma, then visibility. Not only were my Reddit comments bringing traffic, but they also influenced *how search engines and AI platforms pointed users toward my site*.

Now I think of findability not as a backend SEO checkbox but as a *bridge* between real people asking questions and the answers I can provide. I still update my blog, but now I meet people where they are on search, on community forums, and in the future’s generative AI answers.",1,1770662675.0,u_Critical_Rub7034,0,1.0,False

1r0cl5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Leather-Buddy-7902/comments/1r0cl5y/the_beautiful_torture_of_loving_both_math_and/,The Beautiful Torture of Loving Both Math and Physics in College,"Okay, so who else here decided to dive headfirst into the glorious, masochistic world of a joint math and physics degree? Seriously, I thought I was signing up for a deeper understanding of the universe, and don't get me wrong, I got that. But I also signed up for endless nights fueled by lukewarm coffee, staring blankly at whiteboards filled with equations that looked more like ancient hieroglyphs than anything I'd ever seen.

I remember one particular night, utterly stuck on a quantum mechanics problem. My brain felt like it was trying to fold itself into a Mobius strip. The equations just weren't clicking, and the physical intuition felt miles away. I paced my tiny dorm room, the fluorescent lights humming, casting long, distorted shadows. Then, at some ungodly hour, probably around 3 AM, it hit me. A tiny, almost imperceptible shift in perspective, a realization of how a certain mathematical construct perfectly mirrored the physical phenomenon. It wasn't a bang, more like a gentle, shimmering 'click' in my mind, and suddenly, the universe made a little more sense.

That's the thing about this dual path, isn't it? Math gives you the language, the incredible, precise toolkit to describe reality, while physics gives you the reality itself, the phenomena to observe and explain. They dance together, sometimes gracefully, sometimes like two toddlers in a mosh pit, but always, always intertwined. You start seeing the world in vectors and tensors, in symmetries and conservation laws, and it's both humbling and empowering.

It wasn't just about passing exams; it was about the profound satisfaction of truly grasping something, of seeing the elegant machinery behind the chaos. The fear of not understanding would slowly give way to the wonder of discovery, even if that discovery was just figuring out a particularly nasty integral. It changes how you look at everything, from the trajectory of a thrown ball to the vastness of the cosmos. The world becomes a giant, solvable (or at least understandable) problem set.

So, for all my fellow sufferers and enthusiasts, what's *your* most vivid memory or 'aha!' moment from tackling both mathematics and physics? Did it feel more like a beautiful symphony or a chaotic jazz fusion?",1,1770662602.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False
1r0ckz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/1r0ckz6/how_do_you_actually_prep_for_jet_lag_or_do_you/,How do you actually prep for jet lag? (Or do you just wing it and suffer?),"I've taken 80+ international flights in the past 2 years (tech sales, constant travel). The jet lag used to wreck me for 3 days after every trip.

I tried everything:

\- Melatonin (helps a bit, but timing is tricky)

\- ""Just push through it"" (fails every time)

\- Apps like Timeshifter (gave me a plan I immediately forgot to follow)



What finally worked: **prepping my sleep schedule 3-4 days BEFORE the flight**. Gradual 30-60 min shifts per night, timed caffeine cutoffs, strategic light exposure.



The problem? I'd forget to start until I was already packing. By then, too late.



So I'm building a stupid-simple app that just sends timed reminders: ""Go to bed 30 min earlier tonight."" ""Stop coffee after 2pm today."" ""Get 20 min bright light now.""



No complex plans. No apps to check. Just nudges that make the prep happen automatically.



**Question for this group:**

\- Do you prep for jet lag at all, or just deal with it after landing?

\- If you do prep, what actually works for you?

\- Would timed reminders (starting days before departure) actually help, or is this solving a problem nobody cares about?



Genuinely curious what frequent flyers think. If this is dumb, tell me now before I waste more time building it.

\*

My husband has rigid daily routines akin to somebody who retired from the military. He is not a veteran, but a white-collar worker in insurance management.

So, I already knew he was going to ask me about the chicken in the fridge.

I braced myself.

“Hey, hon, I think this chicken is going bad. I can smell it through the Tupperware.”

“Yeah, I know,” I said. “This is the third time you’ve reminded me.”

“You want me to take care of it for you?”

I hesitated then.

“No, it’s fine. I’ll deal with it after I take the girls to their class.”

I should have let him take care of it.

Honestly, I shouldn’t have even bought it. I was passing through that blip-of-a-town, Acadia—long rumored throughout Connecticut for strange paranormal happenings.

Small-town lore. I didn’t believe in ghosts and ghouls.

I needed eggs, and their only grocery store, Brown Barrel Market, touted farm-fresh eggs on a quaint wooden sign.

Perfect.

I saw the meat counter nearby. It was selling free-range, whole chickens that were about to expire. I knew they’d get thrown out if no one bought them, and you can’t beat $0.49 a pound!

I had planned on roasting it that night.

But that was three days ago.

My husband pecked me on the cheek and grabbed his gear. His company was going on some kind of weekend wilderness adventure retreat. I had no idea about the specifics. Something like roughing it, hiking, archery—stuff like that.

I left shortly after him to take the girls to ballet. Upon returning and entering the house, I remembered that I really needed to take care of the chicken.

As I peeked under the lid of the huge Tupperware bowl, a putrid smell hit my nose. I peeled back the lid completely and saw the white, sticky film all over the rancid meat.

I turned my head and coughed, gagging. I knew I needed to remove the bowl and dump the chicken in the trash, but I had this weird resistance to throwing away dead meat, especially when it was a whole chicken still resembling the form of a poor, dead bird.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not averse to eating meat. Humans are omnivores, meaning we’re meant to eat meat and vegetables, so I partake.

However, I have this weird thing that when meat, especially a whole chicken, spoils in my fridge, I feel overwhelming guilt. Suddenly my mind goes to this animal being butchered, and now I’m just throwing it in my trash can. It feels like maybe it at least deserves a funeral.

Call me crazy, but this probably comes from my childhood. My grandma had chickens, and when I was little, I got kind of attached to them. I was a little devastated when I found out that sometimes the older ones would become dinner.

Clearly, it didn’t deter me from eating meat.

But… and please don’t judge me here… when a whole chicken goes bad in my fridge, I have this compulsion to bury it in the backyard rather than just throw it in the trash.

However, being a suburban housewife with two small girls, I don’t often do that anymore.

Not only would the neighbors think it’s weird, but inevitably one of my family members would come out to question me.

Then I really would look crazy.

All day long, I kept thinking about the chore of throwing out the chicken, but I procrastinated. It could wait one more day.

I locked up the doors. I didn’t feel unsafe when my husband left for these trips. We lived in a safe neighborhood.

I did my nightly routine and got in bed. Sleep came pretty quickly.

\*

I guess it was about 3:00 a.m. when I heard a sound.

*Slooosh, thump, slooosh, thump…*

“What the hell is that?” I sat up in bed, rubbing at my eyes, straining to hear that strange repetitive noise.

It sounded like it was getting closer.

*Slooosh, thump, slooosh, thump…*

Then, all at once, the faint but discernible scent of rancid meat filled my nose.

I flipped on my nightstand light and gripped the covers, momentarily paralyzed by the sound of wet sloshing and thumping moving slowly and steadily down my hardwood floors.

Then the sound stopped momentarily outside my doorway. The door creaked open, and nothing. No one was there!

My hands were trembling as I stood up. I steadied myself against my bed frame, moving closer to the door. I threw the door open, and the overwhelming stench of the rancid meat hit my nostrils.

My eyes slowly drifted down to the floor, where the chicken carcass was lying motionless at my feet.

The smell was terrible. I felt like I was going to vomit or faint. I sucked in deep breaths, but the smell was making it worse.

Oh no…

*Blackout*

\*

The next morning I woke up and sat bolt upright.

My head was aching as if I had a hangover, but there had been no drinking the previous night!

In a rush, the memories came flooding back in. I pulled back the covers and went to my bedroom door, throwing it open.

Nothing.

I braced myself for the terrible smell. I expected to see the rotting chicken lying on the floor.

Nothing.

Absolutely no trace.

I ran my hands through my hair and stopped.

A cold chill permeated me as I felt the huge goose egg on the top side of my head—the kind someone might get when they fall down and…

“What the hell is going on?” I mumbled.

I ran down the hall to the kitchen, threw open the fridge door, and—yes—it was still there. The bowl, and presumably the spoiled meat.

I lifted the bowl out of the fridge. Relief filled me when I recognized there was a heaviness to it, meaning the chicken was…

I quickly lifted the lid and peeked inside. I exhaled the tense breath I had been holding.

Quickly, I grabbed a trash bag from under the sink, poured the chicken into the bag, and knotted it off. I took it out to the trash cans and threw it away.

I went back inside, washed my hands, and sanitized the bowl with hot water and soap.

Slowly, the lingering smell began to dissipate.

The day went on as normal.

Except I couldn’t shake the feeling that it wasn’t a dream. Not to mention, every time I ran my hand through my scalp, that knot was still there, tender and aching.

It didn’t matter. Whatever was going on, it was taken care of.

\*

That night, I went through my routine of locking the doors and getting ready for bed. I settled into bed, but sleep didn’t come so easily this time.

The day had kept me busy—my thoughts preoccupied—but now in the quiet stillness of night, I ruminated on the strange dream.

If it was a dream, why did I have a headache all day from a fall I don’t remember taking?

Furthermore, how did I get back in bed?

I got up, went to my bathroom, and popped two nighttime Tylenol. As a rule of thumb, I liked to refrain from alcohol when I was stressed, but I was highly considering downing a shot or two of Johnnie Walker from our alcohol cabinet.

Eventually, sleep did come. But I must have been restless because the sound came again, and my eyes instantly popped open.

*Slooosh*

*Thump*

*Slooosh*

*Thump*

It was slower this time. I sat bolt upright, straining to hear.

Then that unmistakable scent hit my nose. Was it worse now?

Definitely worse.

I waited, the sound growing louder.

*Slooosh*

*Thump*

*Pause.*

*Creeeak…*

I grabbed a T-shirt lying on a chair near my bed and placed it over my mouth to stifle the smell. I was not going to faint again this time.

There sat the dead chicken carcass on the threshold of my doorway again.

This time worse.

Bits of trash clung to it. It had an awful green tint. It had been “cooking” in the hot plastic trash bin all day.

Even breathing, through my mouth into the cloth, I couldn’t escape the smell.

A frantic idea hit me, and without further contemplation, I decided to act quickly.

I took the T-shirt and threw it over the chicken, bundling it up. I ran to the back door, unlocked it, and went outside.

Of course it would be raining…

My bare feet sloshed against the wet grass as I grabbed a shovel from the garden shed on my way to the very back of the property.

I dumped the carcass on the ground and began to dig a hole. I dug four feet down, picked up the bundle, and threw it into the hole.

My limbs were aching, but it didn’t hamper my speed. I quickly covered the hole and smacked the wet earth down firmly with the shovel.

*“Please stay dead*,” I silently prayed.

That was the only eulogy it was getting.

I went back inside and took a very long, hot shower. It was already 5:00 a.m., and I knew I wouldn’t be getting back to sleep. I stumbled into the kitchen and made myself some coffee.

I startled and jerked around as I heard the back door to the kitchen rattle while my husband inserted his key.

He threw open the door, grinning. His eyes were bright and enthusiastic.

“Hey, check this out!”

He waved me outside, over to the patio table, and I looked down at the fully skinned carcass of a rabbit.

“We did a bit of bow hunting. Steve and I were the only ones to bag one!”

I put a hand on his shoulder and said, “That’s great, honey, but I’ve decided to become a vegetarian.”

My husband has rigid daily routines akin to somebody who retired from the military. He is not a veteran, but a white-collar worker in insurance management.

So, I already knew he was going to ask me about the chicken in the fridge.

I braced myself.

“Hey, hon, I think this chicken is going bad. I can smell it through the Tupperware.”

“Yeah, I know,” I said. “This is the third time you’ve reminded me.”

“You want me to take care of it for you?”

I hesitated then.

“No, it’s fine. I’ll deal with it after I take the girls to their class.”

I should have let him take care of it.

Honestly, I shouldn’t have even bought it. I was passing through that blip-of-a-town, Acadia—long rumored throughout Connecticut for strange paranormal happenings.

Small-town lore. I didn’t believe in ghosts and ghouls.

I needed eggs, and their only grocery store, Brown Barrel Market, touted farm-fresh eggs on a quaint wooden sign.

Perfect.

I saw the meat counter nearby. It was selling free-range, whole chickens that were about to expire. I knew they’d get thrown out if no one bought them, and you can’t beat $0.49 a pound!

I had planned on roasting it that night.

But that was three days ago.

My husband pecked me on the cheek and grabbed his gear. His company was going on some kind of weekend wilderness adventure retreat. I had no idea about the specifics. Something like roughing it, hiking, archery—stuff like that.

I left shortly after him to take the girls to ballet. Upon returning and entering the house, I remembered that I really needed to take care of the chicken.

As I peeked under the lid of the huge Tupperware bowl, a putrid smell hit my nose. I peeled back the lid completely and saw the white, sticky film all over the rancid meat.

I turned my head and coughed, gagging. I knew I needed to remove the bowl and dump the chicken in the trash, but I had this weird resistance to throwing away dead meat, especially when it was a whole chicken still resembling the form of a poor, dead bird.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not averse to eating meat. Humans are omnivores, meaning we’re meant to eat meat and vegetables, so I partake.

However, I have this weird thing that when meat, especially a whole chicken, spoils in my fridge, I feel overwhelming guilt. Suddenly my mind goes to this animal being butchered, and now I’m just throwing it in my trash can. It feels like maybe it at least deserves a funeral.

I lifted the bowl out of the fridge. Relief filled me when I recognized there was a heaviness to it, meaning the chicken was…

I quickly lifted the lid and peeked inside. I exhaled the tense breath I had been holding.

Quickly, I grabbed a trash bag from under the sink, poured the chicken into the bag, and knotted it off. I took it out to the trash cans and threw it away.

I went back inside, washed my hands, and sanitized the bowl with hot water and soap.

Slowly, the lingering smell began to dissipate.

The day went on as normal.

Except I couldn’t shake the feeling that it wasn’t a dream. Not to mention, every time I ran my hand through my scalp, that knot was still there, tender and aching.

It didn’t matter. Whatever was going on, it was taken care of.

\*

That night, I went through my routine of locking the doors and getting ready for bed. I settled into bed, but sleep didn’t come so easily this time.

The day had kept me busy—my thoughts preoccupied—but now in the quiet stillness of night, I ruminated on the strange dream.

If it was a dream, why did I have a headache all day from a fall I don’t remember taking?

Furthermore, how did I get back in bed?

I got up, went to my bathroom, and popped two nighttime Tylenol. As a rule of thumb, I liked to refrain from alcohol when I was stressed, but I was highly considering downing a shot or two of Johnnie Walker from our alcohol cabinet.

Eventually, sleep did come. But I must have been restless because the sound came again, and my eyes instantly popped open.

*Slooosh*

*Thump*

*Slooosh*

*Thump*

It was slower this time. I sat bolt upright, straining to hear.

Then that unmistakable scent hit my nose. Was it worse now?

Definitely worse.

I waited, the sound growing louder.

*Slooosh*

*Thump*

*Pause.*

*Creeeak…*

I grabbed a T-shirt lying on a chair near my bed and placed it over my mouth to stifle the smell. I was not going to faint again this time.

There sat the dead chicken carcass on the threshold of my doorway again.

This time worse.

Bits of trash clung to it. It had an awful green tint. It had been “cooking” in the hot plastic trash bin all day.

Even breathing, through my mouth into the cloth, I couldn’t escape the smell.

A frantic idea hit me, and without further contemplation, I decided to act quickly.

I took the T-shirt and threw it over the chicken, bundling it up. I ran to the back door, unlocked it, and went outside.

Of course it would be raining…

My bare feet sloshed against the wet grass as I grabbed a shovel from the garden shed on my way to the very back of the property.

I dumped the carcass on the ground and began to dig a hole. I dug four feet down, picked up the bundle, and threw it into the hole.

My limbs were aching, but it didn’t hamper my speed. I quickly covered the hole and smacked the wet earth down firmly with the shovel.

*“Please stay dead*,” I silently prayed.

That was the only eulogy it was getting.

I went back inside and took a very long, hot shower. It was already 5:00 a.m., and I knew I wouldn’t be getting back to sleep. I stumbled into the kitchen and made myself some coffee.

I startled and jerked around as I heard the back door to the kitchen rattle while my husband inserted his key.

He threw open the door, grinning. His eyes were bright and enthusiastic.

“Hey, check this out!”

He waved me outside, over to the patio table, and I looked down at the fully skinned carcass of a rabbit.

“We did a bit of bow hunting. Steve and I were the only ones to bag one!”

I put a hand on his shoulder and said, “That’s great, honey, but I’ve decided to become a vegetarian.”

My husband has rigid daily routines akin to somebody who retired from the military. He is not a veteran, but a white-collar worker in insurance management.

So, I already knew he was going to ask me about the chicken in the fridge.

I braced myself.

“Hey, hon, I think this chicken is going bad. I can smell it through the Tupperware.”

“Yeah, I know,” I said. “This is the third time you’ve reminded me.”

“You want me to take care of it for you?”

I hesitated then.

“No, it’s fine. I’ll deal with it after I take the girls to their class.”

I should have let him take care of it.

Honestly, I shouldn’t have even bought it. I was passing through that blip-of-a-town, Acadia—long rumored throughout Connecticut for strange paranormal happenings.

Small-town lore. I didn’t believe in ghosts and ghouls.

I needed eggs, and their only grocery store, Brown Barrel Market, touted farm-fresh eggs on a quaint wooden sign.

Perfect.

I saw the meat counter nearby. It was selling free-range, whole chickens that were about to expire. I knew they’d get thrown out if no one bought them, and you can’t beat $0.49 a pound!

I had planned on roasting it that night.

But that was three days ago.

My husband pecked me on the cheek and grabbed his gear. His company was going on some kind of weekend wilderness adventure retreat. I had no idea about the specifics. Something like roughing it, hiking, archery—stuff like that.

I left shortly after him to take the girls to ballet. Upon returning and entering the house, I remembered that I really needed to take care of the chicken.

As I peeked under the lid of the huge Tupperware bowl, a putrid smell hit my nose. I peeled back the lid completely and saw the white, sticky film all over the rancid meat.

I turned my head and coughed, gagging. I knew I needed to remove the bowl and dump the chicken in the trash, but I had this weird resistance to throwing away dead meat, especially when it was a whole chicken still resembling the form of a poor, dead bird.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not averse to eating meat. Humans are omnivores, meaning we’re meant to eat meat and vegetables, so I partake.

However, I have this weird thing that when meat, especially a whole chicken, spoils in my fridge, I feel overwhelming guilt. Suddenly my mind goes to this animal being butchered, and now I’m just throwing it in my trash can. It feels like maybe it at least deserves a funeral.

Call me crazy, but this probably comes from my childhood. My grandma had chickens, and when I was little, I got kind of attached to them. I was a little devastated when I found out that sometimes the older ones would become dinner.

Clearly, it didn’t deter me from eating meat.

But… and please don’t judge me here… when a whole chicken goes bad in my fridge, I have this compulsion to bury it in the backyard rather than just throw it in the trash.

However, being a suburban housewife with two small girls, I don’t often do that anymore.

Not only would the neighbors think it’s weird, but inevitably one of my family members would come out to question me.

Then I really would look crazy.

All day long, I kept thinking about the chore of throwing out the chicken, but I procrastinated. It could wait one more day.

I locked up the doors. I didn’t feel unsafe when my husband left for these trips. We lived in a safe neighborhood.

I did my nightly routine and got in bed. Sleep came pretty quickly.

\*

I guess it was about 3:00 a.m. when I heard a sound.

*Slooosh, thump, slooosh, thump…*

“What the hell is that?” I sat up in bed, rubbing at my eyes, straining to hear that strange repetitive noise.

It sounded like it was getting closer.

*Slooosh, thump, slooosh, thump…*

Then, all at once, the faint but discernible scent of rancid meat filled my nose.

I flipped on my nightstand light and gripped the covers, momentarily paralyzed by the sound of wet sloshing and thumping moving slowly and steadily down my hardwood floors.

Then the sound stopped momentarily outside my doorway. The door creaked open, and nothing. No one was there!

My hands were trembling as I stood up. I steadied myself against my bed frame, moving closer to the door. I threw the door open, and the overwhelming stench of the rancid meat hit my nostrils.

My eyes slowly drifted down to the floor, where the chicken carcass was lying motionless at my feet.

The smell was terrible. I felt like I was going to vomit or faint. I sucked in deep breaths, but the smell was making it worse.

Oh no…

*Blackout*

\*

The next morning I woke up and sat bolt upright.

My head was aching as if I had a hangover, but there had been no drinking the previous night!

In a rush, the memories came flooding back in. I pulled back the covers and went to my bedroom door, throwing it open.

Nothing.

I braced myself for the terrible smell. I expected to see the rotting chicken lying on the floor.

Nothing.

Absolutely no trace.

I ran my hands through my hair and stopped.

A cold chill permeated me as I felt the huge goose egg on the top side of my head—the kind someone might get when they fall down and…

“What the hell is going on?” I mumbled.

I ran down the hall to the kitchen, threw open the fridge door, and—yes—it was still there. The bowl, and presumably the spoiled meat.

Socially I think it will have little impact but could be very beneficial economically. 

Decriminalise Cannabis UK wide. Policing Cannabis USE is a waste of police time and money. Set up dispensaries where you can buy it legally, small personal amounts that can be recorded and regulated. Takes money out of the black market and into the tax pot. Also creates jobs, growing, dispensing, research etc. 

Legalise and have coffee shops in a few cities in the UK and make them tourism hot spots. I'm thinking Bristol and Brighton maybe a few others.

Even breathing, through my mouth into the cloth, I couldn’t escape the smell.

A frantic idea hit me, and without further contemplation, I decided to act quickly.

I took the T-shirt and threw it over the chicken, bundling it up. I ran to the back door, unlocked it, and went outside.

Of course it would be raining…

My bare feet sloshed against the wet grass as I grabbed a shovel from the garden shed on my way to the very back of the property.

I dumped the carcass on the ground and began to dig a hole. I dug four feet down, picked up the bundle, and threw it into the hole.

My limbs were aching, but it didn’t hamper my speed. I quickly covered the hole and smacked the wet earth down firmly with the shovel.

*“Please stay dead*,” I silently prayed.

That was the only eulogy it was getting.

I went back inside and took a very long, hot shower. It was already 5:00 a.m., and I knew I wouldn’t be getting back to sleep. I stumbled into the kitchen and made myself some coffee.

I startled and jerked around as I heard the back door to the kitchen rattle while my husband inserted his key.

He threw open the door, grinning. His eyes were bright and enthusiastic.

“Hey, check this out!”

He waved me outside, over to the patio table, and I looked down at the fully skinned carcass of a rabbit.

“We did a bit of bow hunting. Steve and I were the only ones to bag one!”

I put a hand on his shoulder and said, “That’s great, honey, but I’ve decided to become a vegetarian.”

My husband has rigid daily routines akin to somebody who retired from the military. He is not a veteran, but a white-collar worker in insurance management.

So, I already knew he was going to ask me about the chicken in the fridge.

I braced myself.

“Hey, hon, I think this chicken is going bad. I can smell it through the Tupperware.”

“Yeah, I know,” I said. “This is the third time you’ve reminded me.”

“You want me to take care of it for you?”

I hesitated then.

“No, it’s fine. I’ll deal with it after I take the girls to their class.”

I should have let him take care of it.

Honestly, I shouldn’t have even bought it. I was passing through that blip-of-a-town, Acadia—long rumored throughout Connecticut for strange paranormal happenings.

Small-town lore. I didn’t believe in ghosts and ghouls.

I needed eggs, and their only grocery store, Brown Barrel Market, touted farm-fresh eggs on a quaint wooden sign.

Perfect.

I saw the meat counter nearby. It was selling free-range, whole chickens that were about to expire. I knew they’d get thrown out if no one bought them, and you can’t beat $0.49 a pound!

I had planned on roasting it that night.

But that was three days ago.

My husband pecked me on the cheek and grabbed his gear. His company was going on some kind of weekend wilderness adventure retreat. I had no idea about the specifics. Something like roughing it, hiking, archery—stuff like that.

I left shortly after him to take the girls to ballet. Upon returning and entering the house, I remembered that I really needed to take care of the chicken.

As I peeked under the lid of the huge Tupperware bowl, a putrid smell hit my nose. I peeled back the lid completely and saw the white, sticky film all over the rancid meat.

I turned my head and coughed, gagging. I knew I needed to remove the bowl and dump the chicken in the trash, but I had this weird resistance to throwing away dead meat, especially when it was a whole chicken still resembling the form of a poor, dead bird.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not averse to eating meat. Humans are omnivores, meaning we’re meant to eat meat and vegetables, so I partake.

However, I have this weird thing that when meat, especially a whole chicken, spoils in my fridge, I feel overwhelming guilt. Suddenly my mind goes to this animal being butchered, and now I’m just throwing it in my trash can. It feels like maybe it at least deserves a funeral.

Call me crazy, but this probably comes from my childhood. My grandma had chickens, and when I was little, I got kind of attached to them. I was a little devastated when I found out that sometimes the older ones would become dinner.

Clearly, it didn’t deter me from eating meat.

But… and please don’t judge me here… when a whole chicken goes bad in my fridge, I have this compulsion to bury it in the backyard rather than just throw it in the trash.

However, being a suburban housewife with two small girls, I don’t often do that anymore.

Not only would the neighbors think it’s weird, but inevitably one of my family members would come out to question me.

Then I really would look crazy.

All day long, I kept thinking about the chore of throwing out the chicken, but I procrastinated. It could wait one more day.

I locked up the doors. I didn’t feel unsafe when my husband left for these trips. We lived in a safe neighborhood.

I did my nightly routine and got in bed. Sleep came pretty quickly.

\*

I guess it was about 3:00 a.m. when I heard a sound.

*Slooosh, thump, slooosh, thump…*

“What the hell is that?” I sat up in bed, rubbing at my eyes, straining to hear that strange repetitive noise.

It sounded like it was getting closer.

*Slooosh, thump, slooosh, thump…*

Then, all at once, the faint but discernible scent of rancid meat filled my nose.

I flipped on my nightstand light and gripped the covers, momentarily paralyzed by the sound of wet sloshing and thumping moving slowly and steadily down my hardwood floors.

Then the sound stopped momentarily outside my doorway. The door creaked open, and nothing. No one was there!

My hands were trembling as I stood up. I steadied myself against my bed frame, moving closer to the door. I threw the door open, and the overwhelming stench of the rancid meat hit my nostrils.

My eyes slowly drifted down to the floor, where the chicken carcass was lying motionless at my feet.

The smell was terrible. I felt like I was going to vomit or faint. I sucked in deep breaths, but the smell was making it worse.

Oh no…

*Blackout*

\*

The next morning I woke up and sat bolt upright.

My head was aching as if I had a hangover, but there had been no drinking the previous night!

In a rush, the memories came flooding back in. I pulled back the covers and went to my bedroom door, throwing it open.

Nothing.

I braced myself for the terrible smell. I expected to see the rotting chicken lying on the floor.

Nothing.

Absolutely no trace.

I ran my hands through my hair and stopped.

A cold chill permeated me as I felt the huge goose egg on the top side of my head—the kind someone might get when they fall down and…

“What the hell is going on?” I mumbled.

I ran down the hall to the kitchen, threw open the fridge door, and—yes—it was still there. The bowl, and presumably the spoiled meat.

I lifted the bowl out of the fridge. Relief filled me when I recognized there was a heaviness to it, meaning the chicken was…

I quickly lifted the lid and peeked inside. I exhaled the tense breath I had been holding.

Quickly, I grabbed a trash bag from under the sink, poured the chicken into the bag, and knotted it off. I took it out to the trash cans and threw it away.

I went back inside, washed my hands, and sanitized the bowl with hot water and soap.

Slowly, the lingering smell began to dissipate.

The day went on as normal.

Except I couldn’t shake the feeling that it wasn’t a dream. Not to mention, every time I ran my hand through my scalp, that knot was still there, tender and aching.

It didn’t matter. Whatever was going on, it was taken care of.

\*

That night, I went through my routine of locking the doors and getting ready for bed. I settled into bed, but sleep didn’t come so easily this time.

The day had kept me busy—my thoughts preoccupied—but now in the quiet stillness of night, I ruminated on the strange dream.

If it was a dream, why did I have a headache all day from a fall I don’t remember taking?

Furthermore, how did I get back in bed?

I got up, went to my bathroom, and popped two nighttime Tylenol. As a rule of thumb, I liked to refrain from alcohol when I was stressed, but I was highly considering downing a shot or two of Johnnie Walker from our alcohol cabinet.

Eventually, sleep did come. But I must have been restless because the sound came again, and my eyes instantly popped open.

*Slooosh*

*Thump*

*Slooosh*

*Thump*

It was slower this time. I sat bolt upright, straining to hear.

Then that unmistakable scent hit my nose. Was it worse now?

Definitely worse.

I waited, the sound growing louder.

*Slooosh*

*Thump*

*Pause.*

*Creeeak…*

I grabbed a T-shirt lying on a chair near my bed and placed it over my mouth to stifle the smell. I was not going to faint again this time.

There sat the dead chicken carcass on the threshold of my doorway again.

This time worse.

Bits of trash clung to it. It had an awful green tint. It had been “cooking” in the hot plastic trash bin all day.

Even breathing, through my mouth into the cloth, I couldn’t escape the smell.

Small-town lore. I didn’t believe in ghosts and ghouls.

I needed eggs, and their only grocery store, Brown Barrel Market, touted farm-fresh eggs on a quaint wooden sign.

Perfect.

I saw the meat counter nearby. It was selling free-range, whole chickens that were about to expire. I knew they’d get thrown out if no one bought them, and you can’t beat $0.49 a pound!

I had planned on roasting it that night.

But that was three days ago.

My husband pecked me on the cheek and grabbed his gear. His company was going on some kind of weekend wilderness adventure retreat. I had no idea about the specifics. Something like roughing it, hiking, archery—stuff like that.

I left shortly after him to take the girls to ballet. Upon returning and entering the house, I remembered that I really needed to take care of the chicken.

As I peeked under the lid of the huge Tupperware bowl, a putrid smell hit my nose. I peeled back the lid completely and saw the white, sticky film all over the rancid meat.

I turned my head and coughed, gagging. I knew I needed to remove the bowl and dump the chicken in the trash, but I had this weird resistance to throwing away dead meat, especially when it was a whole chicken still resembling the form of a poor, dead bird.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not averse to eating meat. Humans are omnivores, meaning we’re meant to eat meat and vegetables, so I partake.

However, I have this weird thing that when meat, especially a whole chicken, spoils in my fridge, I feel overwhelming guilt. Suddenly my mind goes to this animal being butchered, and now I’m just throwing it in my trash can. It feels like maybe it at least deserves a funeral.

Call me crazy, but this probably comes from my childhood. My grandma had chickens, and when I was little, I got kind of attached to them. I was a little devastated when I found out that sometimes the older ones would become dinner.

Clearly, it didn’t deter me from eating meat.

But… and please don’t judge me here… when a whole chicken goes bad in my fridge, I have this compulsion to bury it in the backyard rather than just throw it in the trash.

However, being a suburban housewife with two small girls, I don’t often do that anymore.

Not only would the neighbors think it’s weird, but inevitably one of my family members would come out to question me.

Then I really would look crazy.

All day long, I kept thinking about the chore of throwing out the chicken, but I procrastinated. It could wait one more day.

I locked up the doors. I didn’t feel unsafe when my husband left for these trips. We lived in a safe neighborhood.

I did my nightly routine and got in bed. Sleep came pretty quickly.

\*

I guess it was about 3:00 a.m. when I heard a sound.

*Slooosh, thump, slooosh, thump…*

“What the hell is that?” I sat up in bed, rubbing at my eyes, straining to hear that strange repetitive noise.

It sounded like it was getting closer.

*Slooosh, thump, slooosh, thump…*

Then, all at once, the faint but discernible scent of rancid meat filled my nose.

I flipped on my nightstand light and gripped the covers, momentarily paralyzed by the sound of wet sloshing and thumping moving slowly and steadily down my hardwood floors.

Then the sound stopped momentarily outside my doorway. The door creaked open, and nothing. No one was there!

My hands were trembling as I stood up. I steadied myself against my bed frame, moving closer to the door. I threw the door open, and the overwhelming stench of the rancid meat hit my nostrils.

My eyes slowly drifted down to the floor, where the chicken carcass was lying motionless at my feet.

The smell was terrible. I felt like I was going to vomit or faint. I sucked in deep breaths, but the smell was making it worse.

Oh no…

*Blackout*

\*

The next morning I woke up and sat bolt upright.

My head was aching as if I had a hangover, but there had been no drinking the previous night!

In a rush, the memories came flooding back in. I pulled back the covers and went to my bedroom door, throwing it open.

Nothing.

I braced myself for the terrible smell. I expected to see the rotting chicken lying on the floor.

Nothing.

Absolutely no trace.

I ran my hands through my hair and stopped.

A cold chill permeated me as I felt the huge goose egg on the top side of my head—the kind someone might get when they fall down and…

“What the hell is going on?” I mumbled.

I ran down the hall to the kitchen, threw open the fridge door, and—yes—it was still there. The bowl, and presumably the spoiled meat.

I lifted the bowl out of the fridge. Relief filled me when I recognized there was a heaviness to it, meaning the chicken was…

I quickly lifted the lid and peeked inside. I exhaled the tense breath I had been holding.

Quickly, I grabbed a trash bag from under the sink, poured the chicken into the bag, and knotted it off. I took it out to the trash cans and threw it away.

I went back inside, washed my hands, and sanitized the bowl with hot water and soap.

Slowly, the lingering smell began to dissipate.

The day went on as normal.

Except I couldn’t shake the feeling that it wasn’t a dream. Not to mention, every time I ran my hand through my scalp, that knot was still there, tender and aching.

It didn’t matter. Whatever was going on, it was taken care of.

\*

That night, I went through my routine of locking the doors and getting ready for bed. I settled into bed, but sleep didn’t come so easily this time.

The day had kept me busy—my thoughts preoccupied—but now in the quiet stillness of night, I ruminated on the strange dream.

If it was a dream, why did I have a headache all day from a fall I don’t remember taking?

Furthermore, how did I get back in bed?

I got up, went to my bathroom, and popped two nighttime Tylenol. As a rule of thumb, I liked to refrain from alcohol when I was stressed, but I was highly considering downing a shot or two of Johnnie Walker from our alcohol cabinet.

Eventually, sleep did come. But I must have been restless because the sound came again, and my eyes instantly popped open.

*Slooosh*

*Thump*

*Slooosh*

*Thump*

It was slower this time. I sat bolt upright, straining to hear.

Then that unmistakable scent hit my nose. Was it worse now?

Definitely worse.

I waited, the sound growing louder.

*Slooosh*

*Thump*

*Pause.*

*Creeeak…*

I grabbed a T-shirt lying on a chair near my bed and placed it over my mouth to stifle the smell. I was not going to faint again this time.

There sat the dead chicken carcass on the threshold of my doorway again.

This time worse.

Bits of trash clung to it. It had an awful green tint. It had been “cooking” in the hot plastic trash bin all day.

Even breathing, through my mouth into the cloth, I couldn’t escape the smell.

A frantic idea hit me, and without further contemplation, I decided to act quickly.

I took the T-shirt and threw it over the chicken, bundling it up. I ran to the back door, unlocked it, and went outside.

Of course it would be raining…

My bare feet sloshed against the wet grass as I grabbed a shovel from the garden shed on my way to the very back of the property.

I dumped the carcass on the ground and began to dig a hole. I dug four feet down, picked up the bundle, and threw it into the hole.

My limbs were aching, but it didn’t hamper my speed. I quickly covered the hole and smacked the wet earth down firmly with the shovel.

*“Please stay dead*,” I silently prayed.

That was the only eulogy it was getting.

I went back inside and took a very long, hot shower. It was already 5:00 a.m., and I knew I wouldn’t be getting back to sleep. I stumbled into the kitchen and made myself some coffee.

I startled and jerked around as I heard the back door to the kitchen rattle while my husband inserted his key.

He threw open the door, grinning. His eyes were bright and enthusiastic.

“Hey, check this out!”

He waved me outside, over to the patio table, and I looked down at the fully skinned carcass of a rabbit.

“We did a bit of bow hunting. Steve and I were the only ones to bag one!”

I put a hand on his shoulder and said, “That’s great, honey, but I’ve decided to become a vegetarian.”

I've been using pantoprazole/pepcid for the last 2-3 years. per my endoscopy results it seems like I have inactive gastritis but it hasn't 100% cleared up yet I guess. my biggest symptom is belching which can be accompanied by reflux/heartburn. 

I'm currently using 20mg pantoprazole at dinner time and George's aloe vera and DGL at bedtime. I tried coming off meds but symptoms got worse so I think I need to do more work on my diet for a while. my problem is that I can be a bit picky with what I eat since I'm autistic. I'm trying to eat every 2-3 hours so I'm trying to find some good gastritis friendly snacks. I know the big things to avoid but I'm finding it hard to know what I CAN eat if that makes sense. I'd love some good snack and meal ideas that have worked for other people. 

Also how have y'all felt with coffee/caffeine? is like to not cut it out completely bc I work 13 hour shifts as an EMT so the caffeine definitely helps. I have ADHD and I'm currently on a non stimulant bc my resting HR is around 115. I did get on meds for that so I'm considering adding a small dose of a stimulant which may help my symptoms enough to cut out coffee for a bit. idk if stimulant meds could also be a trigger or not

Though I would LOVE to do straight water only, I know the caffeine withdrawals will be a lot to tackle on day one, so we shall see how it progresses.

You attempt to prepare yourself with everything you think you will need ( I know I did), spent at least 3k doing so. With all of the preparation for surgery, there is absolutely no preparation for the mental aspect of this. 

I keep telling myself the swelling will go down, you will stand straight in a couple days, you will laugh, sneeze, and cough regularly, and you will breathe the way you’re supposed to. I know I am very early into recovery but omg, I was not prepared for this roller coaster. This morning I decided I would take my meds, have a cup of coffee and a cup of yogurt for breakfast. My thoughts were, I would not swell and get to see at least what I would look like without the swelling. Not a good idea, a hour or so later my body started to tingle, I felt dizzy, I felt lightheaded and hot.

I guess there’s no way around this process!

Just let the process take place and take care of yourself.",8,1770662051.0,tummytucksurgery,21,0.91,False
