1g3s5qb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueCrimeDiscussion/comments/1g3s5qb/in_october_of_2011_11_month_old_lisa_irwin_went/,"In October of 2011, 11 month old Lisa Irwin went missing from her crib in Kansas City, Missouri. Despite a mysterious call from the family’s stolen cell phone, footage of a man carrying a baby on the road, and scent dogs alerting in the home, she has never been found. Where is baby Lisa? ","[Lisa Renee Irwin](https://imgur.com/a/BfLgy05 ) was born on November 11, 2010, to parents Jeremy Irwin and Deborah Bradley, in Kansas City, Missouri. Lisa had two older brothers, aged five and eight in 2010, and Lisa was described by her parents as a sweet and happy baby who loved spending time with her older siblings, who adored her. In October of 2011, Lisa’s first birthday was quickly approaching, and the family was planning on celebrating within a few short weeks, however, Lisa would go missing before she was ever able to celebrate her first birthday. 

On the evening of Tuesday, October 4th, 2011, [Deborah Bradley](https://imgur.com/a/88ok3es) put baby Lisa in her crib, tucked her other children into their beds to sleep, and settled in for the night at their home on the 3600 block of North Lister Avenue. Around 10:30 pm, Deborah checked in on Lisa to find her sleeping soundly, and knowing she had the rest of the night to herself to relax, she grabbed a bottle of wine and opened it with a neighbor, and the two sat drinking for a while until it was time for bed. Deborah had her first night alone that evening, as her husband was working his first overnight shift building a new Starbucks, and didn’t expect him home until the early morning hours. At some point in the night, Deborah climbed into bed, and went to sleep.

Around 4 am, Jeremy arrived home, and entering the house he became instantly annoyed with his wife. The two had spoken a handful of times about their electric and heating bills, and how to conserve money with their utilities- and when he entered the home he found that the lights were on, the window was open, and the front door had been left unlocked. On top of that, the family’s three cell phones were missing from their usual spot. That annoyance instantly turned into worry when he checked in on his sleeping infant, only to find that she wasn’t in her crib. He immediately ran to his bedroom that he shared with his wife, and not finding Lisa in bed with Deborah, he woke his wife asking where she was. Deborah was confused, because she had checked in on Lisa at 10:30, and she had been sleeping. The couple had worried that perhaps somehow Lisa had managed to escape from her crib and leave the home, so they checked every inch of the house, and up and down the streets, calling for her. When they were unable to find Lisa, Jeremy and Deborah called 911 to file a missing persons report, and an amber alert was immediately issued. 

Police arrived on scene and a search was conducted, which combed the neighborhood and extended into nearby fields and wells, but Lisa was no where to be found. As the investigation went on, the public began to look at Jeremy, and especially Deborah, in a different light- the public scrutinized Deborah for having stayed up getting drunk with the neighbor, and they began to notice cracks in her story. Deborah claimed what she could no longer be sure if she checked in on Lisa at 10:30 or 6:30 pm, and she couldn’t be completely certain of when she actually last saw Lisa. Sadly, due the public defaming Deborah, the media began to focus on that rather than on the actual disappearance of baby Lisa. The police also had their eyes on Deborah, telling her that they knew she had something to do with her daughters  disappearance, and even told her that she had failed a polygraph test that her and Jeremy had willingly taken, in order to coerce a false confession. In reality, Deborah and Jeremy had both passed their polygraph tests. However, police did have one reason to believe that Deborah might be involved: on October 19th police dogs were brought in to search for the scent of decay, and they had alerted to an area in Deborah’s bedroom, near the bed. When Deborah was confronted with this find, she stated that she didn’t immediately want to search for Lisa, because she was “afraid of what she might find.” 

Soon, a friend of Deborah’s, Shirley Pfaff, came forward and claimed that she knew that Deborah had “a dark side” to her. Shirley was interviewed by the Huffington Post, stating: 

> *“When the story broke, it was a normal morning in my house. I got up, put on a pot of coffee and turned on 'Good Morning America' like usual and I ... heard 'Deborah Bradley.' I immediately thought, 'This can't be the Debbie I know.' It just seemed unreal until I walked back into the living room after hearing her voice. I just about collapsed. It just made me sick because I just wouldn't put this girl Debbie past anything crazy. She was my friend at one time and I loved to be around her, but when I [saw] the other side of her and got to know the true Debbie, I couldn't even believe I trusted her with anything. I am not shocked that her story has changed like the wind. That's typical Debbie”*

Despite the police dog hits in the home, and Shirley’s testimony about Deborah, police soon cleared the family of any involvement, with little evidence to point in that direction.  Not long after the disappearance, the three cell phones were discovered not far from the family home. When interviewed, a local handyman named John Tanko had claimed that his girlfriend, Megan Wright, had been called by one of these cell phones and the call lasted about 50 seconds. Megan claimed this call had come from her ex boyfriend, however, Megan denied that she was the one who had answered the call, claiming that her cell phone was more like a “community phone” amongst her and her friends. When asked about the cell phone, the private investigator hired by Lisa’s parents said: 

> *“This whole case hinges on who made that call and why. We firmly believe that the person who had that cell phone also had Lisa.”*

More witnesses came forward claiming that around 2:30 am on the morning Lisa disappeared, they had seen a [man walking down the road carrying a baby.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qBoMHldUMiw ) This baby was not dressed for the cold midwestern weather, but instead was wearing only a diaper. One witness stated that he thought the sight was so unusual, that he had considered offering the man and the baby a ride home, but couldn’t because he was riding on his motorcycle. Another couple who lived three houses down from Jeremy and Deborah also saw the same thing- they claimed they had seen a man wearing a t-shirt, who stood about 5’7 and weighing between 140 and 150 pounds, carrying a baby only wearing a diaper. They also thought this was so unusual that they reported the sighting to the police on the morning of October 4th. While Lisa was last seen in her home wearing shorts and a purple t-shirt, both sightings were consistent in stating the baby had no clothing on, with the neighbor saying: 

> *“We seen the little arm, the leg, it didn't look like the baby had on any clothes, just a diaper.”*

However, the timing seemed off for investigators, with an FBI agent stating this to ABC News: 

> *“Are you going to logically abduct a child, let's say in the midnight area, then 2-4 hours later, you are spotted in the proximity of the neighborhood. I mean, that doesn't make any sense. It could be true, of course, but the logic of abducting a child is so you can take the child to some other location.”*

A new lead came about when investigators discovered the sightings of a dumpster fire nearby, around the time of Lisa’s disappearance. The man who initially saw the fire stated that the flames were shooting several feet high into the air, and that he believed that some sort of accelerant had been used. This prompted the police to show burnt clothing discovered at the scene of the fire to Lisa’s parents, and a subsequent search of a local landfill, but it is unclear what became of this. 

The search for Lisa went international when the sighting of a blond, blue eyed [young girl](https://imgur.com/a/6yJtCAw) was seen in Greece, came to light during a police raid. The young girl, about 5 or 6, was living in a Romani camp, when she was found in 2013. The parents of the girl claimed that she wasn’t their daughter, but that they took her in to raise her with their other 5 children, and a DNA test proved this. The girl was quickly put into foster care, and for a time it was believed that the girl could be missing Lisa Irwin, but the DNA test was able to link the young girl up with her real mother, who also lived in Greece. 

In May of 2012, Lisa’s parents reported that their credit card had been fraudulently used on a website to order fake birth certificates. Both the Today Show, America Live, and the Jeremy and Deborah’s private investigator confirmed the existence of this website, but it is unclear whether or not this fraud was linked to the disappearance of Lisa. 

Sadly, Lisa Irwin has never been found. If Lisa is still alive, she would be turning 14 this coming November. Lisa’s family still holds out hope that their questions about Lisa’s whereabouts may one day be answered, and there is a $100,000 reward put in place by an anonymous benefactor. Police believe that Lisa may still be alive.

It *always* starts coming out sputtering, and it only takes longer to brew when I set it to a lower temperature, making the coffee taste like medicine due to overextraction. There was only one time where it tasted decent, even though it still sputtered. I think the relatively high temperature at least prevented overextraction that time since the water swiftly moved through the ground coffee.

I experimented with a few variables to fix the issue:

* I tried both coarser and finer grinds. Finer grinds made the taste worse for obvious reasons, but neither improved nor worsened sputtering.
* I used to fill the basket so much that a mound was forming at the top. I quickly realised that this choked the pot, as gas was coming out of the safety valve, and the brew was taking forever. I am now filling it to the brim and levelling it, but not exceeding its height. Still, there is improvement in neither taste nor sputtering.
* I recently moved to my current flat, and did not know much about induction stove tops. It took me a while, but I realised that my pans were getting warped for some reason, and the issue did not go away even after I began being mindful of the temperature \[and fixed the pans with a mallet\]. After some Googling, I finally figured out that my pans were not induction-compatible. \
\
This made me curious about whether my moka pot was compatible, and it most certainly is not (it is made of aluminium). I have an electric hotplate (which I started using with my pans), so I gave the moka pot a try on that, but again to no avail. I had to fiddle with the temperature quite a lot as I realised that setting the temperature to somewhere in the middle seemed to keep the brew going indefinitely, so maybe that is on me. \
\
I have an induction-compatible pot, so I am now considering filling its base with water and then heating the moka pot inside the pot on my stove, but I am not hopeful.
* I was using medium roast (closer to the dark side), Lavazza blend beans so far, and switched to Yirgacheffe, freshly light roasted beans today (I actually used this on the hotplate) with the hope that I could get a better taste out of it since more extraction could work out well in this case. Of course, I knew that it wouldn't affect sputtering, but still. I was absolutely wrong about the taste though, and it was still medicine-bitter (with some hints of berries??). Plus, it smelled very foul as it was brewing, almost like actual shit, but I believe the culprit was the beans there - the smell as the same coffee was brewing was not nice even with a French press, though it was much less stronger.

1g3s2zg,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/1g3s2zg/could_it_be_pheochromocytoma/,Could it be pheochromocytoma?,"I apologize in advance if this is all over the place, it's just a lot of info to condense. Long story short, I'm a 35yo female and I'm worried my doctor is dismissing a possible pheochromocytoma.  I know they are very rare, but it fits my symptoms so well and I'm trying to decide if I need to push for her to investigate this more or if anything else could explain my symptoms.

My saga started 7 years ago when I abruptly and out of the blue started having severe panic attacks. I had no previous history of anxiety or panic whatsoever and had spent years traveling and had a career that I loved as an architect. I began having dizzy/lightheaded spells where I just felt weak and had to sit down at job sites when I'd been standing for more than a few minutes. At the time I was 5'-11"" 195lbs, so a little overweight but generally perfectly healthy. I don't smoke, rarely drink, and don't use recreational drugs. Not long after these dizzy/weak spells started, the full blown panic attacks began and nothing has been the same since. 

At the time, my doctor checked my metanephrines with a 24hr urine test and they were elevated, but after a subsequent appointment with endocrinology, they came back at the high end of normal so they stopped looking for answers and sent me to a psychiatrist. I also did a brain MRI and echocardiogram at the time, both of which came back normal. Cortisol was also normal (18). My PCP has dismissed everything as anxiety/weight (even though neither were a factor when the dizzyness first began), but my psychiatrist (an MD I've seen for years) has always wondered if there was an underlying physical cause because the way everything began was so unusual.   
My full list of symptoms:

* Sudden onset of panic attacks with no history
* Rapid weight loss (15 pounds in two weeks), then rapid weight gain (70 pounds in 2 years), though this could be due to taking sertraline. 
* Deficient vitamin D - I took prescription vitamin D at the time this all started and recently had to start again
* Deficient potassium - 2.7 at the worst
* Wildly uncontrolled blood pressure despite taking 250mg labetalol 2x/day, 100mg losartan, 20meq potassium (worst systolic was 202, worst diastolic was 118 and I routinely hit 180s/100s) - BP cuff was cross-checked w/ doctor's office
* Still get very easily lightheaded or dizzy with the slightest physical exertion
* Get sweaty & have significant temperature fluctuations when doing little things like unloading the dishwasher
* Occasional night-sweats, but not all the time
* Consistently high bilirubin levels (1.7-2.1)
* Flushing
* Swollen face before gaining weight
* Sometimes shaky hands (noticed when holding phone or coffee cup)
* Nearly constant feeling like a rubberband is squeezing my head
* Frequently have upper neck/base of skull ache/pain
* Occasional severe pain behind shoulder blades
* I bruise easily (my 6mo niece left little toe shaped bruises on my legs when I bounced her)
* Consistently low transferrin saturation (12-13%)
* Fatigue - I wake up feeling like I barely slept. Coffee doesn't help.
* Brain fog - can't focus to save my life and have the memory of a goldfish. Neither used to be the case.
* Been waking up in the middle of the night feeling weird (for lack of a better word) - lightheaded, tension headache, extremely high BP of around 200/100
* Had one incident at the beginning where I woke up overheated and thirsty and fainted in the middle of the night. At the time I had just started a half dose of lexapro and attributed it to that, but I'm not sure that was the cause. 
* Attacks that feel like gallbladder attacks w/ a confirmed gallstone (via ultrasound) - central pain just below rib cage that eases slightly if I press on it. Over the counter pain meds didn't put a dent in the pain and at the worst I was also nauseous and sweaty
* Discovered >50% stenosis of celiac artery during a vascular ultrasound, but all others are normal

As a result of the gallbladder ultrasound they incidentally discovered 2 golf ball sized cysts on my right kidney (one simple, the other bozniak 2), one of which was located on the upper pole. It took some convincing, but I talked my doctor into doing an abdominal CT to check out the cyst on the upper pole because of all of my previously listed symptoms and the proximity to the adrenal gland. It showed ""numerous"" cysts on both kidneys including a large one on the upper pole of my right kidney. They've said this could possibly be polycystic kidney disease and didn't mention anything about the adrenal glands being abnormal, but looking at the CT it looks to me like it could be affected. So, I'm wondering, could I be on the right track wondering about pheochromocytoma? Should I drop this? Is there anything else that could make sense of all this? Does the CT look like the adrenal glands could be affected? Really appreciate any help!

Here are CT stills: [https://imgur.com/a/Xfgevta](https://imgur.com/a/Xfgevta)

1g3rxls,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g3rxls/aita_for_considering_ending_my_friendship_over_my/,AITA for considering ending my friendship over my best friend’s constant negativity?,"Hey, Reddit. I’m Kate, a 21-year-old woman, and I’m in a bit of a tough situation with my best friend, Emily. We’ve been friends since high school, and for the most part, I’ve always valued our friendship. However, things have taken a turn recently, and I’m struggling to figure out if I’m being unreasonable for wanting to step back from our relationship.

To give you some background, Emily and I have shared a lot together—friendship milestones, high school experiences, and even mutual interests like art and music. We were inseparable in school, but lately, I’ve noticed a pattern in our friendship that’s been bothering me: her overwhelming negativity.

It all started a few months ago when Emily went through a rough breakup with her boyfriend of three years. I was there for her during the entire ordeal, listening to her vent about everything from their relationship issues to how heartbroken she felt. I tried to be a good friend, offering comfort and support. I even spent countless hours on the phone with her, helping her sort through her feelings and encouraging her to focus on self-care.

Initially, I thought she just needed time to heal, and I understood that it would take a while for her to move on. However, as the weeks turned into months, I noticed her negativity becoming more and more pervasive. It felt like every time we hung out, it turned into a therapy session where she would vent about her ex, her job, her family, and just life in general. I found myself in a constant cycle of listening to her complaints, and while I wanted to be supportive, it began to take a toll on my own mental health.

I try to share positive experiences or funny stories from my life to lighten the mood, but she either brushes them off or responds with something negative. For instance, I recently landed a part-time job that I was excited about, and when I told her, instead of celebrating with me, she said something like, “Well, I’m stuck in this dead-end job, so good for you, I guess.” That kind of response became more common, and it left me feeling frustrated and deflated.

After one particularly draining coffee date, where she spent over an hour complaining about how “nothing ever changes” for her, I finally sat down to reflect on our friendship. I realized that I was starting to dread our hangouts because I knew I’d come away feeling emotionally exhausted. It felt like every time we met up, I was putting in all this emotional energy without getting anything in return. I started to feel resentful, wondering if she even cared about my feelings or my life at all.

So, after weeks of thinking it over, I finally decided I needed to confront her about my feelings. I called her up and tried to have an honest conversation. I told her that I care deeply about her and want to support her, but I was feeling overwhelmed by the constant negativity. I asked if we could try to shift our conversations toward lighter topics or find a balance between venting and celebrating life’s little victories. I thought I was being reasonable.

Her reaction surprised me. Instead of understanding where I was coming from, she got defensive. She accused me of being unsupportive and said that I didn’t understand what she was going through. She claimed that friendships are about being there for each other during tough times and that I was abandoning her when she needed me the most. I felt crushed. I genuinely wanted to help her, but I also wanted to maintain my own mental health.

After that conversation, I was left feeling guilty and confused. I reached out to a couple of mutual friends for their perspective, and they suggested that I should just be patient with Emily and give her time to heal. They emphasized that going through a breakup is tough, and it’s normal for people to need support during that time. While I understand that everyone processes their emotions differently, I can’t help but feel like my needs and feelings matter too.

I’m now at a crossroads. I don’t want to be the villain who walks away from a friend in need, but I’m also starting to feel like I’m in a one-sided friendship where I’m constantly giving and not receiving anything in return. The idea of distancing myself feels harsh, but I also worry that if I stay, I’ll continue to feel drained and resentful.

So, Reddit, AITA for wanting to step back from this friendship because of her constant negativity, or am I being selfish for wanting a more balanced relationship? Should I continue trying to support her, or is it time to prioritize my own well-being? I really appreciate any advice or insight you can offer. Thanks for reading!",1,1728942951.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

I'm the music teacher for the whole school. Each class comes into the music room where I'm based and the ta comes with them. Most of the ladies look around for kids to support, offer to hand stuff out, things like that. 

This lady, S, goes straight to the back of the room with her drink and her food and starts quietly eating her breakfast. First time she brought a literal yoghurt in. This time it was something crunchy in a packet. 

I feel like it's very unprofessional to be eating anything when you're supposed to be on the clock helping the kids, and me, especially when that class has some proper characters that need gentle handling.

I know that if I do tell on her to management she'll become unmanageably grumpy at me about it, because she obviously feels entitled to do what she's doing.

So I'm trying to distract me by listing the annoying things he did. 

I sometimes asked him to do our workout together. He would allow me to do his workout with him. By his side. While he basically ignored me. 

He once said he felt sorry for me that I felt the need to fight for affection in the relationship, because I'm fighting with a person who doesn't wanna fight. I didn't even fought him - I just wanted to feel loved and tried voicing my needs. 

After another discussion about meeting relationship needs (all I wanted was spending a little bit of time together, just a 15 min coffee), he said the only thing he promises is that he'll love himself no matter what. 

He constantly white knighted himself, being overprotective of his own image and tried to put me in the disturbing-his-peace role. 

He rarely planned joint activities. 

He was a total people pleaser to anyone - but me. 

He'd text people hearts except for me 

He rarely asked me for my opinion on things. 

He seemed so exhausted of me all the time. All my commitment needs were just so draining to him. I felt like a burden for wanting to have a loving, attentive relationship.

I am a hardcore proud windows user and will go to the grave using windows.   
I have gone into the linux community and have seen the level of B.S. they are willing to take just for the sake of using linux. What frustrates me the most is their arguments for switching to desktop linux at the enterprise level. I have been in a corporate setting for basically my entire career. I have dealt with users who can barely click the power button let alone open ""the internet"" in the morning after they have had their coffee.   
  
The argument goes like this. ""Enterprise is on Windows because it comes pre-installed"". ARE YOU A F\*\*\*\*\*\* idiot or are you just plain stupid ?   
  
This shows to me that you have never ever interacted at an enterprise level, never spoken to a user over the phone on how to open outlook or worse yet they have never had to speak to a user on what is the difference between the internet and Google Chrome (Yes, I have had that conversation). 

Linux desktop is the worse and will never EVER be ready for an enterprise deployment. 

In addition, I have noticed these linux uses never actually speak or talk about their workflow in regards to actual output. Let me explain...

On my windows workstation I have a coding workflow that involves several applications, outlook, teams, some light adobe and other random things that I need to work everytime, all the time.   
If I run into any type of driver problem or anything that involves opening CLI to run some random commands that I have to hunt down in some forum from 19 years ago then I am wasting a lot of time (But these linux users will never admit to that).

I find it that these linux users that are preaching about switching to linux desktop have workflows that are not important. Meaning they are not doing ""Production"" level work. They are just doing basic stuff like checking email, or opening some spreadsheets (if that). 

Sorry for the vent session.

Thank You

Someone please help,"So I’ve been battling mold toxicity and candida for the last few months. I had to quit my job, sell my car, and live in isolation at my house with my mom (who is a wholistic doctor), for the past couple of months while doing a candida and mold protocol. I have it bad. I’m not myself at all and I feel like I’ve been in a constant dream state stuck in my head for months. I have acid reflux, chest pain, heart palpitations, I feel my heartbeat in my stomach, trouble breathing, super bad congestion and sinus issues, crippling brain fog and fatigue, crazy muscle twitching, extreme anxiety, panick attacks th at I’ve never had before in my life, many other things, and worst of all a plethora of issues in my throat. Leading me to this post. I have been getting increasingly better for the most part. I started having a bit for energy (enough to get around the house), and my throat symptoms almost completely went away. I had swollen tonsils, a swollen uvula, off and on white spots on tonsils, a lump in my throat feeling, constant nasal drip going down my throat, swollen taste buds, and bumps on the back of my throat. My throat constantly felt like something was stuck in it, it was hard to swallow, and it always felt uncomfortable and like the muscles in it were sore. Not painful like a sore throat, but tired and aching. All of that started going away and I was super exited because that by far is my scariest symptom, one night (before I knew what I had was candida and discovered what was going on with me) I went to the ER because I thought my throat was swelling shut and I was going to die. They didn’t help at all of course. But basically the throat symptoms have given me an absurd irrational fear of my throat closing up and me dying from it. I’ve even developed nightmares and PTSD where I dream of dying from it swelling up. In the last week, seemingly out of nowhere, I started getting really bad insomnia, something I never dealt with during all of this, which made all my symptoms come back, including my throat. Now within the last two nights I finally managed to get a bit better sleep, but my throat is now worse again. What’s weird is that there’s no bumps or swelling that I can see. My tonsils look fine. But only my uvula is swollen. And I’ve started to notice my epiglottis in the back of my throat. I don’t know if it’s because it’s swollen, or because I’ve just never noticed it until now because I’ve turned into a paranoid freak that’s obsessed with my throat closing on me. But anyways, visually it’s not much worse, and the lump in the throat feeling is gone still, but now my throat has been getting really dry and raspy when I talk, and it’s constantly puffy and uncomfortable feeling all day. It has a sensation of someone having there hand wrapped around it all day. I’m not having trouble swallowing or breathing thank the Lord, but it’s so uncomfortable and I don’t want it getting worse. The only lifestyle changes I can think of that are causing this and my new insomnia are that I’ve stopped doing coffee enemas, (I did them every other day for awhile, but I literally physically can’t do them recently, it’s like butthole is literally too irritated to do them😂, I can’t get the thing to go up there and even if I do the coffee won’t go up, excuse how graphic this is but I’m willing to do anything to get my life back), and I’ve also started to have a small amount of carbs again. Which has been fine or at least I thought it has. My best guess is I should start introducing coffee enemas back in, but I literally can’t. I don’t know what’s happened but my body rejects them completely. By the way I have been doing constant things to help soothe my throat/esophagus but nothing has done much to help. I gargle salt water with essential oils three times a day, I use silver spray, I suck on lozenges constantly, avoid talking, do red light on my throat, castor oil on it too, I drink throat soothing tea, and put drops of copaiba essential oils in it. But nothing, and it feels like it’s getting worse. It feels like something’s crawling up my throat from my chest. I absolutely hate it. If there was just one symptom out of the seemingly endless sea of them that I have every day that I could get rid of, it would be the throat and esophagus issues. Please someone reassure me that my throat is not going to close up and kill me😂. And please someone offer some explanation for what’s going on with my body and why. And if anyone has success stories that’s gone through the same symptoms please share. And lastly any tips for making this go away would be greatly appreciated.

Then they saw it had no flags or masts and they thought it was a whale. But when it washed up on the beach, they removed the clumps of seaweed, the jellyfish tentacles, and the remains of fish and flotsam, and only then did they see that it was a drowned man.

They had been playing with him all afternoon, burying him in the sand and digging him up again, when someone chanced to see them and spread the alarm in the village. The men who carried him to the nearest house noticed that he weighed more than any dead man they had ever known, almost as much as a horse, and they said to each other that maybe he'd been floating too long and the water had got into his bones. When they laid him on the floor they said he'd been taller than all other men because there was barely enough room for him in the house, but they thought that maybe the ability to keep on growing after death was part of the nature of certain drowned men. He had the smell of the sea about him and only his shape gave one to suppose that it was the corpse of a human being, because the skin was covered with a crust of mud and scales.

They did not even have to clean off his face to know that the dead man was a stranger. The village was made up of only twenty-odd wooden houses that had stone courtyards with no flowers and which were spread about on the end of a desertlike cape. There was so little land that mothers always went about with the fear that the wind would carry off their children and the few dead that the years had caused among them had to be thrown off the cliffs. But the sea was calm and bountiful and all the men fitted into seven boats. So when they found the drowned man they simply had to look at one another to see that they were all there.

That night they did not go out to work at sea. While the men went to find out if anyone was missing in neighboring villages, the women stayed behind to care for the drowned man. They took the mud off with grass swabs, they removed the underwater stones entangled in his hair, and they scraped the crust off with tools used for scaling fish. As they were doing that they noticed that the vegetation on him came from faraway oceans and deep water and that his clothes were in tatters, as if he had sailed through labyrinths of coral. They noticed too that he bore his death with pride, for he did not have the lonely look of other drowned men who came out of the sea or that haggard, needy look of men who drowned in rivers. But only when they finished cleaning him off did they become aware of the kind of man he was and it left them breathless. Not only was he the tallest, strongest, most virile, and best built man they had ever seen, but even though they were looking at him there was no room for him in their imagination.

They could not find a bed in the village large enough to lay him on nor was there a table solid enough to use for his wake. The tallest men's holiday pants would not fit him, nor the fattest ones' Sunday shirts, nor the shoes of the one with the biggest feet. Fascinated by his huge size and his beauty, the women then decided to make him some pants from a large piece of sail and a shirt from some bridal linen so that he could continue through his death with dignity. As they sewed, sitting in a circle and gazing at the corpse between stitches, it seemed to them that the wind had never been so steady nor the sea so restless as on that night and they supposed that the change had something to do with the dead man. They thought that if that magnificent man had lived in the village, his house would have had the widest doors, the highest ceiling, and the strongest floor, his bedstead would have been made from a midship frame held together by iron bolts, and his wife would have been the happiest woman. They thought that he would have had so much authority that he could have drawn fish out of the sea simply by calling their names and that he would have put so much work into his land that springs would have burst forth from among the rocks so that he would have been able to plant flowers on the cliffs. They secretly compared hom to their own men, thinking that for all their lives theirs were incapable of doing what he could do in one night, and they ended up dismissing them deep in their hearts as the weakest, meanest and most useless creatures on earth. They were wandering through that maze of fantasy when the oldest woman, who as the oldest had looked upon the drowned man with more compassion than passion, sighed:  'He has the face of someone called Esteban.'

It was true. Most of them had only to take another look at him to see that he could not have any other name. The more stubborn among them, who were the youngest, still lived for a few hours with the illusion that when they put his clothes on and he lay among the flowers in patent leather shoes his name might be Lautaro. But it was a vain illusion. There had not been enough canvas, the poorly cut and worse sewn pants were too tight, and the hidden strength of his heart popped the buttons on his shirt. After midnight the whistling of the wind died down and the sea fell into its Wednesday drowsiness. The silence put an end to any last doubts: he was Esteban. The women who had dressed him, who had combed his hair, had cut his nails and shaved him were unable to hold back a shudder of pity when they had to resign themselves to his being dragged along the ground. It was then that they understood how unhappy he must have been with that huge body since it bothered him even after death. They could see him in life, condemned to going through doors sideways, cracking his head on crossbeams, remaining on his feet during visits, not knowing what to do with his soft, pink, sea lion hands while the lady of the house looked for her most resistant chair and begged him, frightened to death, sit here, Esteban, please, and he, leaning against the wall, smiling, don't bother, ma'am, I'm fine where I am, his heels raw and his back roasted from having done the same thing so many times whenever he paid a visit, don't bother, ma'am, I'm fine where I am, just to avoid the embarrassment of breaking up the chair, and never knowing perhaps that the ones who said don't go, Esteban, at least wait till the coffee's ready, were the ones who later on would whisper the big boob finally left, how nice, the handsome fool has gone. That was what the women were thinking beside the body a little before dawn. Later, when they covered his face with a handkerchief so that the light would not bother him, he looked so forever dead, so defenseless, so much like their men that the first furrows of tears opened in their hearts. It was one of the younger ones who began the weeping. The others, coming to, went from sighs to wails, and the more they sobbed the more they felt like weeping, because the drowned man was becoming all the more Esteban for them, and so they wept so much, for he was the more destitute, most peaceful, and most obliging man on earth, poor Esteban. So when the men returned with the news that the drowned man was not from the neighboring villages either, the women felt an opening of jubilation in the midst of their tears.  
'Praise the Lord,' they sighed, 'he's ours!'

The men thought the fuss was only womanish frivolity. Fatigued because of the difficult nighttime inquiries, all they wanted was to get rid of the bother of the newcomer once and for all before the sun grew strong on that arid, windless day. They improvised a litter with the remains of foremasts and gaffs, tying it together with rigging so that it would bear the weight of the body until they reached the cliffs. They wanted to tie the anchor from a cargo ship to him so that he would sink easily into the deepest waves, where fish are blind and divers die of nostalgia, and bad currents would not bring him back to shore, as had happened with other bodies. But the more they hurried, the more the women thought of ways to waste time. They walked about like startled hens, pecking with the sea charms on their breasts, some interfering on one side to put a scapular of the good wind on the drowned man, some on the other side to put a wrist compass on him , and after a great deal of get away from there, woman, stay out of the way, look, you almost made me fall on top of the dead man, the men began to feel mistrust in their livers and started grumbling about why so many main-altar decorations for a stranger, because no matter how many nails and holy-water jars he had on him, the sharks would chew him all the same, but the women kept piling on their junk relics, running back and forth, stumbling, while they released in sighs what they did not in tears, so that the men finally exploded with since when has there ever been such a fuss over a drifting corpse, a drowned nobody, a piece of cold Wednesday meat. One of the women, mortified by so much lack of care, then removed the handkerchief from the dead man's face and the men were left breathless too.

He was Esteban. It was not necessary to repeat it for them to recognize him. If they had been told Sir Walter Raleigh, even they might have been impressed with his gringo accent, the macaw on his shoulder, his cannibal-killing blunderbuss, but there could be only one Esteban in the world and there he was, stretched out like a sperm whale, shoeless, wearing the pants of an undersized child, and with those stony nails that had to be cut with a knife. They only had to take the handkerchief off his face to see that he was ashamed, that it was not his fault that he was so big or so heavy or so handsome, and if he had known that this was going to happen, he would have looked for a more discreet place to drown in, seriously, I even would have tied the anchor off a galleon around my nick and staggered off a cliff like someone who doesn't like things in order not to be upsetting people now with this Wednesday dead body, as you people say, in order not to be bothering anyone with this filthy piece of cold meat that doesn't have anything to do with me. There was so much truth in his manner that even the most mistrustful men, the ones who felt the bitterness of endless nights at sea fearing that their women would tire of dreaming about them and begin to dream of drowned men, even they and others who were harder still shuddered in the marrow of their bones at Esteban's sincerity.

That was how they came to hold the most splendid funeral they could ever conceive of for an abandoned drowned man. Some women who had gone to get flowers in the neighboring villages returned with other women who could not believe what they had been told, and those women went back for more flowers when they saw the dead man, and they brought more and more until there were so many flowers and so many people that it was hard to walk about. At the final moment it pained them to return him to the waters as an orphan and they chose a father and mother from among the best people, and aunts and uncles and cousins, so that through him all the inhabitants of the village became kinsmen. Some sailors who heard the weeping from a distance went off course and people heard of one who had himself tied to the mainmast, remembering ancient fables about sirens. While they fought for the privilege of carrying him on their shoulders along the steep escarpment by the cliffs, men and women became aware for the first time of the desolation of their streets, the dryness of their courtyards, the narrowness of their dreams as they faced the splendor and beauty of their drowned man. They let him go without an anchor so that he could come back if he wished and whenever he wished, and they all held their breath for the fraction of centuries the body took to fall into the abyss. They did not need to look at one another to realize that they were no longer all present, that they would never be. But they also knew that everything would be different from then on, that their houses would have wider doors, higher ceilings, and stronger floors so that Esteban's memory could go everywhere without bumping into beams and so that no one in the future would dare whisper the big boob finally died, too bad, the handsome fool has finally died, because they were going to paint their house fronts gay colors to make Esteban's memory eternal and they were going to break their backs digging for springs among the stones and planting flowers on the cliffs so that in future years at dawn the passengers on great liners would awaken, suffocated by the smell of gardens on the high seas, and the captain would have to come down from the bridge in his dress uniform, with his astrolabe, his pole star, and his row of war medals and, pointing to the promontory of roses on the horizon, he would say in fourteen languages, look there, where the wind is so peaceful now that it's gone to sleep beneath the beds, over there, where the sun's so bright that the sunflowers don't know which way to turn, yes, over there, that's Esteban's village.

We became friends quickly since I helped train her, and we’ve spent a lot of time together at work. We have coffee dates, she sits with me in the car during breaks, and we walk down the hall together. Honestly, it felt like we had a real connection.

However, she started flirting with me more after she got into a relationship, which confused me. She often seemed upset when I mentioned leaving work early, and our coworkers even started asking if we were together. There were moments where I thought she might have feelings for me, especially with how she looked at me and played with my hair.

Things have changed recently, though. I’ve noticed that we’ve been spending more time apart, and it feels awkward between us now. I’m trying to respect her relationship, especially since she talks about her boyfriend a lot and calls him her husband. I don’t really like him—he gives off a douchey vibe—but she seems to genuinely love him.

Some close friends have encouraged her to break up with him and get with me, but I think that might have made her uncomfortable. I’m starting to feel like I missed my chance, and while I want to get over her, it’s tough. She has some red flags, like past cheating, but she insists she wouldn’t do that with him.

I’m slowly coming to terms with the idea that I probably won’t get a chance with her. I want to stay friends, but I’m unsure if that’s healthy for me. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you cope?",2,1728941879.0,introvert,2,1.0,False

Nearly every upvoted response boiled down to character attacks on Peter and virtually everyone he spoke to.

I understand that Peter has biases but frankly as a local I'm happy that this issue is getting any sort of light shined on it. Over the last year I've had numerous interactions downtown that make me ashamed of my fellow progressives and how these issues are being handled. Downtown is a shit show and if we don't reign it in, Burlington WILL lose its economic sustainability to communities where this sort of behavior does not fly.

On a trip down to Chuch street with my 6 year old and my wife we encountered massive piles of liquid shit covering the floor of the only operational elevator in the parking garage. On a numerous occasions we've had to explain to our daughter why people are actively overdosing and she's already witnessed a man actually overdose on the way to get hot chocolate at a coffee shop. Just last Friday my wife and I went downtown for our 10th anniversary and immediately after parking we walked by a man on the corner of Church and Main with his pants fully removed while he wiped shit off his bare ass one block from a public restroom.

I don't get it. I don't trust cops any more than the next person. Any person capable of reading history is justified in that mistrust. At same time, at what point is it socially acceptable to even talk about these issues without getting socially lambasted? When will it be okay for us as a local community to acknowledge that empathetic solutions HAVE to paired with accountability for those that break the law.

What gives, Burlington? The people in these videos are exposed to these realities on a daily basis. Are we as a community so insulated from reality behind our screens that we're incapable of seeing this from the perspective of these people in his video? They're immersed in this melting pot every day in the very same way that tourists are and if our reaction to hearing their feedback is to bury our heads in the sand I fear for Burlington's economic and communal future.

1g3r8rv,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1g3r8rv/question_about_shelf_life_of_fontana_chocolate/,Question about shelf life of Fontana chocolate sauces (low volume WPS store) ,"I recently started working at a WPS cafe in the lobby of a hotel that is open 3-4 hours daily for breakfast. I have no prior experience as a barista and received virtually no formal training on making coffee drinks so it’s been kind of a steep learning curve, especially since the specifics of our store hours and operation differ dramatically even relative to the licensed stores located in grocery stores, etc. 

I just noticed the other day that the Fontana sauces are labeled “stable for up to 14 days at room temperature” which led me to finding out about the shelf life standards used in proper stores. I brought it to the hotel f&b manager and my coworker who has worked there a long time and neither was previously aware of the short shelf life once opened… I said that we need to date everything when opened from now on and my f&b manager appreciates that something needs to change going forward but is wary of tossing the sauces after 14 days bc of how low volume our cafe is and how much that would waste given the cost. If it were up to me we would be following the 14 day standard going forward and I will continue to push for that and in the meantime I plan to date them per the standard anyways and just be vigilant about checking them carefully once we hit that date. Since this is out of my control a bit I was wondering if there anything I can do that might extend the shelf life? The only idea I had was maybe refrigerating the sauces outside of our operating hours so that they are only kept in room temp for 3-5 hours a day but wasn’t sure whether that would help or cause other issues.

More generally, if anyone else has worked in a lower volume store and encountered similar issues any insight or advice would be much appreciated. 

I am the only person who runs the front 6 days a week with just one other person each shift who works in the back and only makes food so any changes in dating or storage procedures wouldn’t require much buy in from others and I really want to get things on a better track now that I’ve identified this issue. And again, if it were my call we would just follow the standard but I can’t unilaterally decide to trash nearly full bottles of pricey chocolate sauces as a new hire against my higher ups approval :/",1,1728941126.0,starbucks,0,1.0,False

This weekend marked one year since I posted my first video as ""Eight Metal Strings"" on YouTube and I wanted to make a post thanking everyone who has supported me over the past 12 months.

I rarely remember to post stuff on Reddit but I know many of you have been recommending my channel to newcomers looking to learn the 8-string, so I wanted to give a special shout out to those of you doing that. It means so much to me to know what I make has enough value for some of you that you'd share it, unprompted.

I also wanted to share some fun stats with everyone to take a look back at my first year!

* 4651 Watch hours
* 87,715 Views
* 1124 PDF downloads on my [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/eightmetalstrings)

* 33% of the audience is in the United States
* 47.5% of the audience is between ages 25 and 34
* Most of y'all are dudes (99.3%)

These numbers blow me away and are already inconceivable. I can't imagine what they will be like in another year or two. The 8-String empire is growing.

Lastly, to celebrate the 1-year anniversay, I am officially launching my [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/EightMetalStrings)! I have heard from several people that they wanted a way to support the channel or connect with me more but are not in a place financially to take lessons; so I hope this can fill that niche.

1g3r69s,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1g3r69s/help_me_understand_if_the_relationship_dynamic_is/,Help me understand if the relationship dynamic is healthy or am I (28F) being covertly controlled by my partner (30M)?,"My partner Josh and I have been together for a little over a year now. Things have started wonderfully. I didn't anticipate any relationship in my life at the time we met, but valued the way we connected over the topics we could discuss.

Then I noticed how caring he was. He would help out everybody with small things (for example, holding the door, taking the trash out, etc.). I saw it as a genuine wish to ease others days. He behaved the same towards me, even better, which at times felt like he was reading my mind.

Now, at that time, I had some personal issues and also went really low with my health, like never before. He ended up being very upfront with wanting me to tell him the personal issues, saying that he could see something was going on on my side, even though barely anyone noticed. I trusted him, reluctantly at first, but then quickly explained what's happening and he jumped right in to help me with that, he even helped with my health and I got better really fast, though I was in a need of a recovery period.

Soon after that, we ended up being in a relationship and living together. He said himself first that I will probably be a mess for a quite the time so he didn't expect profound intimacy nor me being completely trustful towards him, nor calm most of the times. That ended up being true (I denied it at first, thinking none of it is going to be a problem, but it somehow ended up being that way).

To make it shorter, I'll just point out things that started bothering me more and more, but I can't pinpoint if that is normal or not. I'd like to point out that I can get frustrated at times, but usually it takes a lot to shake up my calmness. I apologize whenever I'm wrong and try to learn from mistakes. He acts the same, but here are some things I can't shake my head off of:

1. We had a major fight on a vacation, and though I don't remember at all how it started, I remember him messaging both of our mothers about the fact that that happened and how I decided to split up with him (I asked him not to involve our family when he said he will, for obvious reasons) (P.S. our families know each other, they are close, so it wasn't out of the blue to contact them). We resolved our issue and he was very apologetic about contacting family and blamed it on being hot-headed and me also being very intense at that moment.

What stuck with me from that incident is that he phrased something along the lines that I should not be irrational with my behaviour/words next time if I don't want it to go south (like contacting family), as he also gets hot-heated. To me it is still strange, as we talked before that about how wrong it usually is to notify third parties about our issues. Because they won't forget, at least. For example, my mum really grew fond over Josh, but still remembers that incident and mentions it sometimes.

2. Intimacy has been a hell for both of us. He has a huge libido, I had it before as well, but after I went through personal issues before him, it affected my libido after we met and started dating. Add on top of it my declined health - I have close to zero wish for the intimacy. We did have amazing times when we began dating, but I slowly pulled out of it more and more and now I don't want it at all.

The thing that drives me away is that he understood completely in the beginning, that I need space with that, but he never stopped initiating multiple times in a day. All harmless cuddling ends up with a request for more. Not just a request, but he actively continues to touch me even when I say no. Lots of times I need to get defensively angry for him to stop so he stops, making a long face, saying how hard it is for him without the intimacy. And he doesn't masturbate (views it as an emotional cheating). That makes me always feel guilty but also sad how my boundaries are pushed until I get, well, angry (?). Then he proceeds with questions about oral sex, asking if I can't do penetrational sex, can I relieve him orally and why I don't.

The thing is, even his touch started feeling like I can't stand it at all, because it always ends up with advances even though he knows I can't.

But, he continues to talk to me dirty, asking if I will be his submissive woman, and points out that he doesn't want submissive except for the bedroom. But recently, he started telling me shady things like submissive woman doesn't necessarily mean bad, that I should put the ball down at home as well and let him take the upper hand more with some decisions. And then he proceeds saying how submissive is the one in control, as for example, in bed, when it says no, everything stops. (Yet, I have to beg and get angry to stop his cuddling advances.)

What triggered me today is how we were outside on a coffee and he spent majority of the time watching BDSM and slutty lingerie for me online to order and asking me which I'd like and how he can't wait for the future to have his 'little submissive slave' wearing that at home, and all I wanted was a normal conversation. I can't take that sexual advances anymore, I need just pure compassion. And he... well, he always points out how it is hard for him to stay always calm as he is pent up for months now. And I never felt so physically resentful of a touch before, as I am now. Used to think it's because of the disturbances I had before, but now I think it's maybe because of him?

3. Can't help but notice how he sometimes tells white lies to other people as to cheer them up. Those are small compliments, but I know for a fact he doesn't mean them usually. I once asked him about that and he responded with how sometimes people need a little bit of a push to be positive about the day/life. To me it feels like I can't trust him as he tells those so convincingly I can't help but think how it affects his integrity.

4. My alone, productive time, used to be tied closely with being outside on a cup of coffee learning, reading, playing on my own. Once we started living together, I asked him would he have issues if I sometimes went alone to the coffee shop. He responded in a way that it would be okay, but he would be sad without me, and overall, won't be as happy as he is when we are together. Initially I thought it is just because we just started living together, but today, after a long time, I went out on my own for a coffee on a work break. We work close to each other so we often go on lunches together and also very often end up going home together. When he called me to check what's up during that coffee, I said where I was and he blew up, saying that he could go home earlier if I let him know and I should've let him know. Keep in mind, he usually doesn't go home that early but somehow could today. I asked him why he didn't tell me he could go home that early, as I wouldn't want him to wait that long for me. And he said he didn't want to interrupt me as he thought I was busy. I confronted him telling that this seems not to be the issue and he is diverting his true anger on me going out alone for a coffee. Just yesterday, we spoke about it again and he said that I'm not a college student so that a coffee shop would be a place for me to learn or have alone time, but if I want it, I could go. He even asked me do I feel sorry for him wasting an hour on waiting for me. I said I didn't know he was free and he could just let me know. To which he responded I should've let him know first where I was and to promise him I'll do it from now onwards.

5. He always gives me compliments on my looks and outfits. But recently, started saying something along the lines that I don't need makeup because I am beautiful to him. Also, that he first saw me in a hoodie and it suits me better than casual business style or dresses (which I like more).

All of it to me seems like huge red flags coverted really deep and that is why I need your help. I would give more examples, but I see I wrote a lot already, so thanks for reading. Wanted to point out for final words, mostly our relationship is filled with amazing moments, he is always doing everything he can to make me happy, but those things I can't align with his character.

I know it sounds really really bad, but hear me out. It is kinda long story, so grab your coffee. 

For context:

I (30F) had rough childhood. My parents went through divorce and my dad moved away to another city and I stayed with my mother who was.. Lets say.. Very easily triggered. So I was her punching bag to let her emotions out even when I did not deserve it. But I hold on because every second weekend I got to spend at my dad's. I loved it. No punishments, just chillin. I never brought out these horrors from my mother to my father, because I did not wanted to worry him.

When I was about 12 years old, I went for our weekend with my dad. I had bad mood so I excused myself from lunch and went out. And I'm glad I did. I met group of teenagers chillin near my dad's home. They were obviously older than me but you know, I looked older for my age. They approached me, because they were missing one person for their game. So we played and talked about two hours, exchanged phone numbers and than I went back home. That night, I got many texts from them and I knew, we will be very good friends all together. 

Every weekend with dad, I spend some time with him and than I rushed outside to be with them. I told them about my difficulties and than that one friend (Michael) started to pay more attention to me (at that time I did not know why because he was 5 years older than me). As time flew, this group of amazing people started to visit me at my home town. We grew closer and closer. 

When I was 15 years old, I started to notice Michael more and more. You Know... Girl's puberty. He was.. FINE.. at least. One afternoon he asked me to go out with him. We chat. And I could see something was bothering him, but I did not know why. He told me that he gets my struggles and that he needs some break from his life. I did not know what he meant. 

Next day after this conversation , he was just gone. We could not find him. So only logical step, approach his family, which we know little about. His father and mother had family business and you could tell, they were money oriented. When we asked about Michael, they did not care. And it clicked. He had same struggles at home like me. At least I had my dad. He had money from so called ""family"" but it was not worth it. 

Days went by and Michael was still nowhere to be found. I actually thought he is dead somewhere. I missed him every single day. After my 16 birthday he actually showed up. Like nothing happened. But he looked like wreck. Like human body without a soul. He did not want to tell anybody what happened or where he was. I was flabbergasted. What an actual f*ck?! So I waited when he is ready. 

Two days pasted and finally he came with explanation. His family drove him kinda insane. He was listening how he is not good enough, how he is weak for showing his emotions, how he is total trash. After some time he started to feel like that. Holy crap. I was ashamed cause I didn't notice and we were spending lots of time together. He actually helped me to ease relationship with my mother. That day he poured his heart out. When he was away he started to use drugs. He lived very dangerous life and now, he wants to get back on track. My poor Michael.. I just cried. At that moment I knew, deep down I loved him. Very much. But surprise surprise, he had same drug addict girlfriend who came after him. So I collected my feelings and pushed them down the sewer. 

Next year was horrible for all of us. Our group tried to help him get clean, but his horrible girlfriend (Sasha) always pulled him right back. When she wanted to quit, he pulled her back. They were so toxic for each other. Plot twist. She got pregnant. What an exelent surprise. But they kinda collected themselfs and pushed through. Michael started seeing his father who gave him well paid position at their firm to provide for his now family. But this time I could tell, working with his father was eating him alive. Every night we had a call. Telling each other about our day ( of course after Sasha went to sleep). He would tell me everything. Small things, some big news, how he loves Sasha, even how he is scared to have baby with her. Some days he would call he is having bad day so I rushed to the rescue when I could. I could see he is coming back to his loving personality. Some days we three ( Michael Sasha and me) would hang out, preparing nursery, talking about baby names. Life was getting good actually. 

When Sasha was about to get birth, we were all so happy to welcome another munchkin into our group. She gave birth to little baby girl. And for my surprise, they actually named her after me. I cried, a lot actually. Two months after a birth, galaxy gave all of us big punch into our guts. That bitch left Michael and our little angel alone. She vanished. She was not feeling it. So only logical step. Our group step up once again. When we had time we took turns to help Michael out. When I was there I put Michael and our angel to bed, swept clean their apartment and tried to cook meals at least for another two days. We went like that probably about three months. But you know, destiny has its twisted ways. 

I celebrated my 18 years. At that time our little munchkin was 5 months old. And.. She was not healthy. Doctors found leukemia and after two horrible months, she just took her last breath. My heart hurts even when I am writing this after so much time. World beneath our feet crumbled once again. That sight of child casket is not going to leave me to the day I die. Where were Michaels parents you might ask. Nowhere. They did not show up once for their granddaughter. Not even for her funeral. My poor Michael. He was slipping away again. He locked himself up in his apartment, did not want to see anybody. A week after a funeral I just pushed myself in that bloody apartment. He was there, crunching in a corner. Bloody eyes, swollen face. I sat down next to him and hugged him. I knew he drugged himself again. This time, I actually did not blame him. We sat there in silence after I mummbled that he needs to get himself clean. He needs to live. If not for himself, at least for me. I kissed him and left. It was time for me to live my life for once. 

Two months pasted and nothing. Not a single word from him. Our friends did not tell me what was happening. They knew I was 18 , exhausted, even before I could start life on my own. One night I saw Michael calling. I picked up and... Oh boy. I jumped into my car and rushed over his apartment. He was brutally intoxicated. When I got there, he was banging his head over his apartment door, screaming he wants to start over. He looked like he is in great pain, and add to that he actually caused himself a big tear on his forehead. I called an ambulance and we rushed to a hospital. When the doctors were taking care of him, I called his parents. They actually picked up so I yelled that they pick up their useless asses and go to The hospital and I don't accept a NO for an answer. After a hour they came. And blamed me for his screwed up life. Yeah. Me. I got slapped. I got kicked to a floor. Amazing. Their son was fighting for his life and yet, I was their punching bag. I told them they are the reason who he is now. He was loving, caring, funny and kind person. They destroyed him. Doctors came and told us he is out of danger right now. So I went home cause I felt pain after these kicks to my stomach. 

His parents than prohibited us to see him, but friends went anyways. Me on the other hand, I could not. I just did not want to face Michael yet. Big big big mistake. As you can tell, he did not make it. I regret everything. I couldn't say goodbye. I couldn't say I love him. His parents than held a funeral. Without us of course. They didn't even place him with his daughter. To this day I don't know where he is burried and I can't visit him. 

After this, I almost gave up. But I met incredible guy and he pulled me up. We started dating and everything was amazing, until it was not. After year of dating we moved together. Than I finished college and found nice job. 10 years flew by. But my past with Michael caught me unprepared. Our mutual friend contacted me. Michael set up trust fund for me.. He knew I wanted to go study. But again his shitty parents tried to hide it and he stumbled into this matter by total accident. I was still holding grudge against them after this 10 years, so I found a lawyer to help me get back this fund. Another our battle began. We had hearings about it, and let me tell you, I had to live through it once again. His parents were calling me names and even threatening me. Once again their nature showed up. Disgusting people. 

After our third meeting his mother went balistic. She started to follow me and attack me. One day somebody knocked at our apartment when I was ready to leave for work. I opened and got slapped across my face. It was her, just getting it out of her system. Then she left. Like nothing happened. This situation occured about three times, outside of my workplace, when I was buying groceries and when I was hanging out with my friends. So I tried to get restraining order, but they told me, I need to have solid evidence. Like, my bruises are not enough. 

One thing happened for sure. I found out, I'm pregnant. Instead of happiness I was afraid. Afraid that this piece of shit is going to hurt me and my baby. 5 months pasted and I had to postpone our hearings cause I was not feeling well. This move kinda calmed Michael's mother down so I had peace for 5 months. But my luck. We run to each other at grocery store. She tried to kick me into my stomach. This time, I was ready to fight back. I pushed her down, kinda kicked her and yell that she is poor excuse of mother, she bullied her son, never give a damn about him and her granddaughter and she is going straight into hell. For my surprise she walked it off. So I thought. 

That night Michael's father called. She commited suicide. He told me that she was psychically ill for long time and he apologized for everything she has done. He can shove his apology into his butt. He gave up and told me that fund is mine and hanged up. 

To this day I haven't see the money. And to this day I'm angry. So many destroyed lives over some family of business narcissists. 

At least, in the spring of this year, me and my boyfriend welcomed beautiful baby boy and I'm living in a dream, but sometimes I wonder. What if I could have done something better? Would Michael be still here? If his mother was treated better, would she commit suicide? 

So, AITA for standing my ground?

I use light to medium-light roast coffees, and my current setup is a Flair 58 paired with a 1ZPresso J-Max S grinder, using the Flair Power Tower. Hand grinding got old fast, especially with light roasts, so I picked up the Power Tower. But lately, it’s been seizing up and shredding its internal belt (already on my second warranty claim for this). After reading through various sources (like [this one](https://www.home-barista.com/grinders/1zpresso-j-max-j-ultra-for-light-roast-espresso-t91816.html)), I realized my issue might be that the J-Max S just isn't up for the task with light roasts.

So, time for an overdue grinder upgrade.

I’ve been eyeing the **DF64 Gen 2**, which looks like a solid choice, especially for the price. It also looks like it fixes a lot of the issues that earlier DF64 models had, which is reassuring.

That said, in light of my experience with the J-Max S, I'm still not confident it will handle light roasts well. In particular, I’ve seen some mixed feedback on how the DF64V (the variable-speed version) performs with light roasts at lower RPMs, which makes me wonder if the variable speed is even beneficial in my case or if the standard DF64 Gen 2 is the better bet.

Then, of course, there’s the **DF83**, which has me tempted because of its beefier motor and larger burrs for consistency. I think I'd be leaning toward the **DF83V** and starting with the stock DLC burrs before diving into SSP burr upgrades down the line.

Preferences: I’m still figuring out my exact espresso preferences, but I think I lean toward **clarity** over body/sweetness. I like a shot that can **punch through milk** with good **acidity** and a satisfying level of clarity, without bitterness—which is why I favor light roasts.

Resellers: I’ve noticed that both **Miicoffee** and **Turin Grinders/Espresso Outlet** offer pretty much identical pricing, but Miicoffee offers a **3-year warranty** for half the price ($59) of the **2-year warranty** through Turin/EO. Does anyone have experience with Miicoffee's customer service or any insights on whether that warranty difference is worth considering?

Anyone else in a similar situation or with experience using these grinders with light roasts? Is the DF64 Gen 2 enough, or would the DF83 be worth the extra cost for better light roast performance? Are the V (variable-speed) versions worth the relatively small upgrade cost?",1,1728940366.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I strongly believe in free will. I’m not going to force you to believe.

But to call it a book club is so disrespectful. When you have faith in something it changes everything and impacts every decisions you make in life. My faith guides my values, my purpose in life, my actions, how I view humanity and the world and my place in it… it affects how I treat people, how I treat myself, how I conceptualize the world. It is a dogmatic shift in how you see things and interact with the world. Believing in an objective truth changes a lot.


My deepest beliefs about the world, other people, and myself are influenced by my faith. It changes how I love. My sense of self worth, personality structure and basic psychology is founded on the philosophy I choose to follow and the God I worship. The habits I build, the self growth I aspire, and my introspection is all rooted my faith. It is an integral part of my identity and very being. It guides my morals and helped form my conscience. It’s hope is what gets me through each and everyday. In the darkest of times and in the good times, it is there influencing me. It’s extremely powerful (which is why I’ve put so much time and energy making sure I believe in it/worship how I do and want to live out its mission). My spirituality is an essential aspect of my lived experience. 

I’m not going to mass to read and discuss a book I enjoy or hang out with some friends and drink coffee, I’m going to worship the God I believe in. I have made a decision to give my life over to something. That is not a book club. 

I get non religious people often don’t have that same kind of structured external foundation in their life and I’m sure there are people who interact with their faith more casually, but to disregard the impact of faith entirely and just call it a book club is really ignorant.

1g3qvgn,https://www.reddit.com/r/paypigsupportgroup/comments/1g3qvgn/just_find_a_femdom_lol/,"""JUsT fINd a FeMDoM Lol""","I ask because as I reflect on my experience with femdom, I feel myself becoming a lot more cynical. Especially since I'm a dynamic that 

I have tried on fetlife for a while but success wasn't as good as I initially hoped it would be. I accept the fact that there will be more subs than dommes but due to factors, such as distance or just not meeting a particular preference it didn't work out

I also tried to meet dommes on r/femdompersonals but the results were largely the same. Either discounted due to not meeting physical requirements or the post would be swarmed with replies and I would be on a waiting list that never arrived at my greeting. Fair enough, its part of trying to find a relationship. I had to accept the fact that subs would also be more numerous than dommes so I was a kind of uphill battle. 

So as a young 18 year old I looked for pro dommes, which required paying. Fine sure Idm doing that for the experience but it's something I had to save up to experience as I was also a university student. And building a long-term dynamic that would require me to financially invest for in. Something that wasn't very feasible as I was also attending university at the time and so would need to prioritise essentials

However the desire was still there to want to indulge in femdom so I settled for mainly online forms. I could pay for pro domme. Maybe i could settle for online ones. And thought I found one however she wanted payment for sessions which i understood. So i did. I didn't realise however that was that dreaded word...a findom.  
So after paying for a few sessions here and there I was completely enraptured, I  finally was able to indulge in a fantasy and worship the feet of a beautiful femdom. However as i had more sessions i realised that I was expected to pay for more than just our sessions. A coffee here, an uber trip there. But i didn't mind as it was part of the fantasy. I was happy to sacrifice a bit for the woman who made my niche fantasy come true !   
But then the price got more and more and I had to take breaks even talking to her. As i knew id end up spending way more than I would budget. I knew I should have stopped when it got like that but i was young and think with my dick and as a result I leave for a few months, come back and blow my budget. It was pretty toxic and honestly left me feeling pretty horrible with myself. But at this point just sending money become arousing to me. A feeling that would remain with me to this day. After doing this for about 2 years I had to call it off. I couldn't talk to her anymore as my finances where in ruin. I ended up maxing out my overdraft (£1500)  
And had to spend about 4 months paying it off.(I thankfully found a pretty good paying job around that time)

But despite that, I still wanted to experience that sweet submission. A with the new craving of being a finsub I found myself in the mindset of if I want femdom I have to pay and so I jumped back into that dynamic of going to findoms to experience femdom. Its been that way basically my whole adult life until recently. 

Something i saw broke my brain and it kinda peeved in a way I couldn't explain. I had to think quite deeply as to why. I think this post is me processing it. On findom discussion forum I saw some one post complaining about a sub asking if they did femdom ? Now, fair enough its a stupid question, she advertised herself as a findom so its like going to a butchers and asking if they have anything vegan. But it was the fact she screenshot it and said ""ugh I DO FINDOM, IF YOU WANT FEMDOM FIND IT SOMEWHERE ELSE"" and it was a well received post understandably.   
It however, irritated me. ""It's not the easy"" was the prevailing thought that rang in my mind a like a church bell at noon. I'm only into findom because I like femdom. I wouldn't be paying for this if I could just find a femdom. It feels like money and femdom are almost inseparable. I honestly find it hard to imagine getting into femdom without having to pay something. I lament how much it sucks that a fetish that is so intrinsic to me, feels like skinner-box moblie game. You can play it for free, but if you want to access the full experience sooner, then paying will get you there faster. 

Now, to give my dues:  
-I'm not trying to make myself out to be a victim, I always had the choice to walk away from findom and try other routes to find a findom  
-I will say, I have enjoyed my time with findom, there plenty of findom sessions. I've enjoyed and dont regret spending on. As mentioned earlier it just a kink I have now. I've just learned to engage in it in a very toxic way that I want to change  
-I'm not the most socially adept but I have gotten better and would go about searching on fetflife differently  
-I haven't tried going to mucnches so, I do lack that perspective

So I write this to ask, is my experience unique ? Can other subs here relate ? Is this common or am I just screaming into the void whilst everyone else is looking at the lunatic having an argument with a brick wall?

I (38M) just broke up with my partner (43F) of two years a few weeks ago, and I've been doing a lot of self-reflection and analysis since then. I've suspected that I was in an emotionally abusive relationship but I wanted some feedback here because sometimes I think I'm crazy and just hard to date (I def have my own issues like avoidance, etc). I love her so much but the relationship was really intense (emotionally and physically) with high highs and low lows, which made it incredibly difficult to end. In spite of all of the conflict/difficulties, I feel a strong urge to go back to her and that if I don't, I'm doing a terrible thing bc I'm hurting her so much. A ton of guilt, even still. All of my friends and family members said I was unhappy in the relationship fwiw. Finally, my mother is a narcissist so I feel like this may be just perpetuating a cycle.

Some relationship background (sorry this is a lot):

* Felt like I was walking on eggshells and was always scared to upset her by saying or doing the wrong thing (she said she felt like she was walking on eggshells around me too). Felt myself changing my behaviors in order to please her.
* Had unending long relationship talks that would go in circles and were emotionally/mentally taxing for me. But they ended with ""feeling closer"" according to her, which made it extremely confusing.
* She had trouble regulating her emotions and would cry almost every time we had a conversation that was deeper than surface level or involved conflict.
* We had passionate fights/makeup sessions where she would tell me she never felt closer to me after resolving conflict.
* Criticized my spending time with my two sisters (who are two of my best friends) and said when we were hanging out with one of them, she felt like ""my secondary partner"" and that my sister was ""my primary partner."" Once accused me of lying to meet up with my sister for coffee.
* I signed up for an acting class where a comedy scene called for my ""kissing"" my scene partner, which turned into a massive fight where she said ""now she had to be worried about her bf making out with people."" When I acted the scene out in class, of course we didn't actually kiss.
* Partner reacted extremely negatively to any change of plans. Was once 45 min late picking her up to go to a jazz show without texting bc I lost track of time and she completely blew up. ""Feeling like my partner is unreliable is unacceptable."" Once ate dinner with a friend who had just arrived from Brazil and was hungry without telling her and when she arrived, I asked her to order something and that we would def stay, etc. She refused, then blew up at me later in the night bc I ate earlier than her and forgot to tell her.
* I said there was a possibility I may go to a strip club during a bachelor party, which resulted in multiple blowups/fights, and she equated it to cheating.
* Said she had previous trauma from a relationship about an ex withholding information from her so it was a huge issue if any information came out that I previously didn't tell her during similar conversations.
* I shared my location with her indefinitely early on in the relationship because I said ""I had nothing to hide"" and she never shared hers back. When I realized this was odd later on, I stopped sharing mine. She confronted me and I explained that the inequity was the issue for me, that if she shared hers then I would continue sharing mine. She accused me of ""hiding things,"" but then never shared her location.
* Had difficulty accepting/processing any women I had either dated or hooked up with. I went to a baseball game with my friend of 20+ years (we have hooked up maybe 3-5x total but haven't in 10 years and I consider her a completely platonic friend) and had to drive to my gf's house afterward to calm her down because she was so upset.
* Accused me of ""hiding her"" from my ex very early on in the relationship when I said I would be uncomfortable going out with her a block from my old apt because I hadn't told my ex yet and didn't want to run into her before telling her about us. Later on, we were out one night, she found out her ex was at a bar we were about to go into and she made us leave. Same behavior she criticized me for.
* Questioned my taste in friends because she disapproved sometimes of things they said.

1g3qqs6,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1g3qqs6/first_korea_trip_itinerary_general_tips_advice/,"First Korea Trip: itinerary, general tips & advice, driving experience, and shopping experience","We just got back from 2+ weeks in South Korea and had an amazing time! Sharing our itinerary, general tips & advice, our experience driving in Jeju, and shopping tips.

# ITINERARY

We did 6 nights in Seoul, 3 nights in Busan, 5 nights in Jeju, and 1 night in Seoul at the end of the trip. Given how much time we had for the whole trip, I wouldn't change how we divided up the cities. For Seoul, keep in mind that it's a massive city and things may be far away from each other. Even though the subway is an efficient way of getting around, some neighbourhoods are an hour away. There are also a TON of stairs, so I'd recommend good shoes for lots of walking. Biggest tip is not to try to do too much in one day. Our days in Seoul felt full without being rushed or overwhelming.

* **Day 1:** landed at ICN at 6pm. Took the AREX to Seoul Station, bought a T-money card on the AREX, then took the subway to our hotel in Dongdaemun.
* **Day 2:** walked to Gwangjang Market for breakfast. Bought a Climate Card from 7-Eleven and reloaded it at the subway station for 5 days. Took the subway to Hongdae and customized a bunch of items at the Nike store. Stumbled upon a Harry Potter cafe in Hongdae while we waited for our custom Nike products. Took the subway to Myeongdong to go shopping.
* **Day 3:** did a colour analysis with Cocory. Took the subway to Gangnam for lunch. Went to a golf simulator to kill time before our skincare appointment at ShineBeam. We did a skincare analysis and treatments based on our analysis results. Had dinner and went to a rooftop bar in Gangnam before heading back to the hotel.
* **Day 4:** went back to Myeongdong for some shopping before heading to the Gyeongbokgung Palace. We planned to visit the palaces and shrines, but it was Armed Forces Day and the palaces and shrines were closed. Walked around Bukchon Hanok Village and visited the National Folk Museum instead.
* **Day 5:** DMZ half day tour that we booked through Klook. The tour took us to the Dora Observatory where you can see North Korea across the Imjin River, Imjingak Peace Park with the Freedom Bridge, and the Third Tunnel. When we arrived at the Third Tunnel, there had just been an explosion and the tunnels were filled with gas / smoke. We ended up not being allowed to go down to the tunnel for safety reasons. Got back to Seoul around 4:30pm. Explored the Dongdaemun Design Plaza and walked along Cheonggyecheon Stream at sunset before going for dinner in the area.
* **Day 6:** hiked Baegundae Peak in Bukhansan National Park, the tallest peak in Seoul. We didn’t know that it was a national holiday, so the trail was PACKED. When we got to the summit, there was an hour long line to take a photo at the very top. The views of Seoul from the summit are incredible and even though it was crowded, it was a great hike.
* **Day 7:** took the KTX to Busan. Walked along Haeundae Beach and had Dwaeji Gukbap for dinner, a traditional Busan meal of pork and rice soup. Went to an arcade along the strip before heading back to our hotel.
* **Day 8:** spent the day at Spa Land Centum City for a jjimjilbang (traditional Korean bathhouse) experience. We did the baths and got a full body scrub (separated by gender), and then met up to do the saunas and relaxation rooms together. The spa has a self-serve ramen bar that we went to for lunch. There were also amazing massage chairs that cost ₩3,000 for 15 minutes. Took the subway back to our hotel, went for dinner and went back to the arcade.
* **Day 9:** We wanted to do the Sky Capsules, but didn’t book in advance and the earliest slot available for that day was 3pm, so we skipped it. Took the Haeundae Beach Train instead. We got off at the last stop and Ubered to the Haedong Yonggungsa Temple. Ubered back to the train station and got off at various stops to have lunch, do the Skywalk, and go for grilled clams at Doheenae in Cheongsapo.
* **Day 10:** flew to Jeju and picked up our rental car. Drove to Bong Bong’s Tangerine Farm. We were a few weeks too early for tangerine picking season, but we had a coffee at the cafe, met Bong Bong the golden retriever, and walked around the farm.
* **Day 11:** visited Osulloc Tea Museum to see the green tea fields. The Innisfree flagship store is part of the property and there are 2 cafes there. Drove to the Jeongbang Waterfall and then the Seogwipo Maeil Olle Traditional Market for lunch. Walked around Seogwipo before heading back to the hotel. Went out for dinner at a chicken katsu and udon place.
* **Day 12:** went to the Cheonjeyeon Waterfall and then Daepo Jusangjeolli Cliff to see the basalt columns. Went for noodles and then came back to Daepo Jusangjeolli Cliff to do Olle Trail 8, but it started raining so hard we had to turn back shortly after starting it.
* **Day 13:** drove to Hallasan National Park. We wanted to hike to the summit, but you need to reserve the 2 trails that reach the summit. The weather didn’t look great so we decided to hike the Yeongsil Trail instead, which gets you close to the summit. Incredible views of Jeju and Mt. Halla throughout the hike.
* **Day 14:** hiked Seongsan Ilchulbong, which is short and easy. Amazing views of Jeju from the top on one side, views of Tuff Cone on the other. Next to Seongsan Ilchulbong is where the Haenyeo women divers put on a performance. We had lunch at the restaurant next to the dive site, where you can eat the seafood they catch, and watched the 2pm show where they caught an octopus.
* **Day 15:** returned the rental car and flew back to Seoul. Went to Myeongdong for our hair appointment at Eco Jardin. We got the viral 18 step scalp treatment and a haircut. Went shopping in Myeongdong for more skincare before heading back to the hotel.
* **Day 16:** took the Airport Limousine Bus to the airport. Got to the airport early to claim our tax refunds.

# GENERAL KOREA TIPS

* You need cash for street food, markets, and reloading your transit card (foreign credit cards are not accepted for transit). Everywhere else we went accepted credit cards.
* Get a Climate Card for unlimited trips on the subway and bus in Seoul – we bought ours at 7-Eleven and then you load it at a subway station machine, where you can select how many days you want the card for. We took the subway everywhere so this was much cheaper than paying for each trip individually.
* Apps to download:
   * Google Translate - a lot of people do not speak English, we got by just fine using Google Translate, camera translation is especially helpful for menus
   * NAVER Maps - Google Maps does not work well in Korea, but we found searching for places to be hit or miss in NAVER. We used Google Maps to find places and then NAVER to navigate to them. Google Maps will not provide any driving or walking directions and transit directions are wonky. NAVER has amazing navigation and you can also see when the next bus / subway is coming.
   * k.ride - this is the foreigner version of Kakao T and works like Uber. We used both k.ride and Uber, we found Uber to be a little cheaper but it was good to have options. You should download this in advance as it required SMS verification to set up your account.
* There are tons of public restrooms all over Korea and they are all free and clean!
* If you plan to shop or get any skincare treatments, save Seoul for the end of the trip. I regret shopping at the start of the trip and having to lug all of our shopping around to Busan and Jeju. If you’re planning to do skincare treatments with downtime, doing this at the end of the trip would be better so you don’t look crazy while sightseeing.
   * You can get treatments based on your consultation and do not have to get the treatment you pre-booked (this was true for our skincare and hair appointments). There seemed to be a lot of flexibility to change / add treatments on the spot, but this may be clinic-dependent.
* There’s no tipping for food or services in Korea
* Bring your passport with you everywhere for tax refunds! Some places do immediate tax refunds and others will scan you passport and then you’ll have to get the refund at the airport.
* There are almost no public garbage cans in Korea, be prepared to hold on to your garbage until you get back to your hotel.
* Get an eSIM from Klook – they had more options and it was cheaper than Airalo. There is also free Wifi at most places.
* Glasses of wine at restaurants are super uncommon – you can buy bottles of wine at some restaurants and beer at every restaurant though.
* Liquids 100ml+ and beverages are allowed in your carry on for domestic flights
* It’s rude to drink or eat on the subway or bus
* There are a lot of Korean holidays in early October
   * Oct 1: Armed Forces Day
   * Oct 3: Gaecheonjeol (National Foundation Day)
   * Oct 9: Hangul Day
* Korea felt very safe, more so than the big city where we live in Canada – people leave their belongings unattended in restaurants and other public places while they use the washroom, etc. with no fear of them being stolen
* People in public do not seem to have the same situational awareness (? not sure how best to describe it) as we are used to in North America. For example, we were walking through a subway station at rush hour and the man in front of us abruptly stopped at the top of the middle of a set of stairs to check his phone without moving off to the side. People often cut you off while walking vs. going around you or waiting 2 seconds to let you go by first. It's also common for people to bump into you or push you aside (gently) to get by without saying excuse me / sorry.

# DRIVING TIPS

We only drove in Jeju (best way to get around the island), which was less busy than Seoul or Busan.

* You need an International Driving Permit to drive in Korea
* You cannot turn left on a green light unless you have the green arrow OR you have an unprotected left turn (denoted by a blue sign with white text and white left turn arrow above the lights)
* We did not encounter any stop signs but there were a few intersections with no lights and no stop signs that were stressful and felt like a game of chicken in terms of who had the right of way
* There are lots of roundabouts but it seems no one knows how to use them. We encountered cars trying to enter the roundabout that did not yield to cars in the roundabout, cars in the wrong lane based on where they were trying to exit the roundabout, and several times a car just stopped in the roundabout unsure of what to do.
* They intersperse fake speed bumps among real ones
* There are speed cameras EVERYWHERE. Your car's navigation system will tell you there is a speed camera coming up and what the speed limit is. These notifications are super frequent, sometimes every minute, and they were really distracting. Everyone seemed to be going above the speed limit, so I'm not sure how frequent speeding tickets actually are.
* 95% of cars are a white Hyundai or white Kia
* Parking spots are tiny, make sure to fold in your mirrors when parked
* Lanes are well marked and road signage is super clear

# SHOPPING TIPS

* As mentioned above, bring your passport everywhere and ask if the shop does tax refunds. Some places (e.g. Olive Young, Blue Elephant) will do an immediate tax refund, which means you do not pay the tax. Other places will scan your passport and then you have to scan the receipt at a tax refund kiosk (there are some around Seoul and at the airports) to get the tax refunded back to you. At the airport, you can go to the tax refund counter to get cash back. Some kiosks (e.g. Nike stores) allowed for a refund to your credit card.
* There are 3 Nike stores in Seoul (Myeongdong, Gangnam, Hongdae) where you can customize products. Each store has patches unique to that location. We went to the one in Hongdae. Got there right at opening and there was a small line that was let into the store. It was a super fun experience, we customized caps, tshirts, sweaters, and sweatpants.
   * You can also customize products at Adidas and New Balance, but we didn't visit those stores
* Blue Elephant sells similar sunglasses as Gentle Monster (and they are supposedly made in the same factory as Gentle Monster) for much cheaper. We got sunglasses for ₩47,900/pair.
* Skincare / makeup shopping
   * Olive Young is like Korean Sephora. There are OYs everywhere, but I did most of my shopping at the flagship store in Myeongdong.
   * You can find good deals on skincare at Baviphat, Tem Tem, and All Mask Story in Myeongdong. I read conflicting things on Reddit about the reliability of these discount stores and that there is a risk of getting fake or expired products. I restocked products I regularly use and mostly bought sheet masks. Everything I bought from these places have an expiry date 2-3 years out (typical for skincare) and products seem legit since I'm familiar with the packaging and product appearance / consistency of things I repurchased. HOWEVER, the sales associates are pretty pushy and will tell you they have better prices than OY, which wasn't always true. For example, All Mask Story had 100 Mediheal toner pads for ₩18,500; OY sold a pack of 200 Mediheal toner pads for ₩29,000. All Mask Story sold Lindsay Modeling Mask Packs for ₩2,500; OY had them on sale for ₩500. Other products were similarly priced or slightly more expensive at OY, but at OY you have the peace of mind that all the products are real.
   * Korean pharmacies have great skincare products too! I heard about special pimple patches they sell, but ended up getting the Acnon and Aclean pimple creams and used them throughout my trip. The creams were cheapest in Jeju, most expensive in Myeongdong.",8,1728939850.0,koreatravel,6,1.0,False

1g3qn58,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1g3qn58/expense_report_revenge/,Expense Report Revenge...,"Back at a previous employer I was a Training Specialist and I was pretty good at it.  I love to share information and help people understand things that are new or difficult for them.  Good rapport with all staff and new hires.    
  
Our company hired an outside contractor to take over a portion of the business that was unprofitable but, expected in our industry (people want it even though it may not be the best product for them or it is used short term).

A few weeks after the switch, the company realized that the new group did not know how to handle our customers.  Example:  We were not allowed to say ""No."".  It was ""I'll see what I can do.""

It was decided that they would send a team of people to train them on what our customers expected and how to handle them.  I was chosen to be part of that team.  But, there was a problem - I was hourly.

Cue corporate greed.  They decided to promote me and make me salary.  Okay.  Now, I can't claim any extra hours for the upcoming trip.  It became expected and part of the day.  I decided with the small bump in pay - I wouldn't complain and just accept it.

Trip went well.  In fact, everything flowed nicely.  We returned and I had to fill out my first expense report.  During the trip I made an effort to save money and chose to go grocery shopping instead of restaurants for all my meals.  I liked the control of it too - I knew what I was getting.  Big mistake.

My total expense report for the time away was $268.00.  Do you think they paid it?  \[Insert laughter here\].

Over the course of six weeks, I would submit the report and they would send it back with one item declined and asking me to fix it and resubmit.  Over and over again.  At one point - going into the 3rd or, 4th week - I needed that little bit of money to cover the last part of my rent and after letting them know the bind I was in - their response was ""Next time, you should consider declining the trip if it would put you in that type of financial bind.""  Ugh.  
  
I read the whole expense report section line by line - making sure they couldn't/wouldn't send it back again.  I am a bit of a gym rat and did visit their local gym during the visit.  At first, I left it off the expense report - just a few bucks - eh.  Luckily, I saved that receipt and added it during one of the later revisions.  They attempted to deny it and I quoted the portion of the handbook that showed it is an approved expense (they were not happy).

\[Insert heartbreaking tiny violin music for the Accounts Payable Department\]

When all was said and done, I got a check for $84.00.    
  
I was livid.

I thought about what I could do and chose the following:  
  
- Being a vanpool driver, after our morning meeting I would take the van and drive to a nearby coffee shop to get my morning latte.  Inside the building coffee was suddenly deemed inferior and undrinkable. I would even take people with me - a morning excursion.  
- My lunch break stretched to 90 minutes.  I would bring the LA Times with me and after eating - sit in my cubicle and read.  
- And, finally - I slowed down on my work.  Purposely, dragging my feet to get any and all projects completed.  It was so relaxing.

This went on for many-a-day until one day - while reading the paper - I got the thought. ""That's enough.""  Back to a being a regular, normal good employee.

1g3ql3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1g3ql3s/im_drowning/,I'm drowning....,"I'm looking for advice and support, suggestions and this is a bIt of a vent too.

I ask for kindness because I'm pretty fragile at the moment.

I (44f) am having a seriously hard time. My NP, Maple (43m) had his first date that resulted in sex with his new partner. Our communication has been open and kind. We've been poly from the start of our relationship 3.5 years ago. 

In that time, we've both been on the dating sites. I have not had luck even getting a conversation really going. I've not been on a date. Everything I've read signals that this is not the ""norm"", as it's usually women that have options coming out their ears (quantity over quality). Maple is the opposite and has had dates (though not frequent) with several folks. 

Compounding issue is my disability.  I have fibromyalgia and it literally steals my energy from me. So spending hours and hours to try and make a match online is virtually impossible because its both mentally and physically exhausting.

I live in a smaller town in the Midwest and poly groups are not closer than 1.5 hours away, which isnt remotely feasible with vehicle issues - I shouldn't be taking the car further than I'm able to walk. This also limits potential matches because I'm not comfortable asking a date to drive long distances just for dinner or coffee - it leaves me feeling like something is ""expected"" (sex) and I don't move very fast at all. To be clear, I wouldn't want even my best (platonic) friend driving an hour for 20 minutes at a coffee shop with me. 

I feel like my whole world is on fire and shaking from an earthquake at once. I am journaling heavy. Therapy is in limbo as they hire a new therapist at the counceling office. Ive spoken with Maple and he has been kind and patient and understanding.  He's reassuring me as often as I ask and more on his own. 

I know he loves me. I know he cares. I know he's done nothing at all wrong. My logical human brain is fully functioning and aware. It however, is not calming these feelings. 

I'm struggling with the inequity, even though it's logical due to circumstances.

Im struggling with feeling unimportant,  with ""he's only with you cuz he's getting everything he wants"", with ""I'll never find someone""... with ""accepting less"".

I've liked the idea of dating/loving multiple people since I was a teen, and while unlabeled (i had no idea what polyamory even was),  was doing poly in highschool 30 years ago. Mutually monogam-ish relationship after highschool. Met  and married my ex husband after that. Monogamy was the marriage, but I found out after we separated he was cheating.  Another short monogamous relationship after the divorce (who was cheating too, come to learn). Maple had some poly experience and we talked about it heavily before we decided to be partners. I came into this with open eyes, mind and heart.

But with my medical disability,  trying to date is so exhausting and I didn't anticipate it. I feel keen pressure (self induced) to ""not be left behind"". I don't know what is wrong with me except my energy to be able to go through profiles and keep liking and hope someone messages back. Inevitably though, folks from entirely too far away, or out of my preferences are who ""like"" me on dating apps. And folks I ""like"" don't reply (including people labeled poly on their profiles). There's been a few failed convos, where they get pushy about sex talk or pushing to meet after 3 messages. Noones gotten to the point that I can give them my number to talk ""off app"".

Maple is always telling me nice things - encouraging me, reminding me that I'm attractive, and telling me that these folks online are missing out by not taking time to get to know me...  I've never doubted his feelings, but I've never believed that about me either because well... trauma and demolished self esteem... even still I felt ""ok"" before... but now, not so much. How can I feel ""good"" when it feels like all I do is lose? My energy is so low I can't do anything I want to anymore it seems - all my hobbies and ""escapes"" (distractions) are now too hard to do physically, I can't get anything going anywhere to feel better about dating and im kinda stuck ""accepting less"" in my NP relationship because I can't seem to change anything. I love him, he makes me better, and wants more for me than im getting.... and to be 100% honest, I can't survive financially ""by myself"" either.

If I can't make meaningful connections, what's the point? Will I ever be ""ok"" if I never get a date while he is? At this point, it feels like finding another partner is a pipe dream. And I feel like I'm the one giving everything up, getting none of that back. ",4,1728939473.0,polyamory,11,0.83,False

1g3qgwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1g3qgwb/so_glad_i_quit/,So glad I quit ,"I've been caffeine free for about a month and a half. This is my third time quitting caffeine because I always end up going back to it for whatever reason. One little excuse to have a cup and have ""more energy"" eventually leads me to daily consumption.

I don't see anything wrong with those who have given up on caffeine as a daily habit but still use it occasionally, however in my case I've found that I simply do NOT enjoy this chemical. Funny thing is, I used to convince myself that I did. That it made me more social, made everything more fun, gave me motivation for life, but it turns out that caffeine was just messing me up.

I never got any real ""energy"" or ""motivation"" to do things. I was STRESSED. And this stress tricked me into thinking that I could do more, when in hindsight it actually made me do LESS while maintaining the illusion that I was being more productive. At some point I was taking up to 400mg everyday (in caffeine pills, coffee, or energy drinks) and the negative side effects kept increasing.

It was impossible to get out of bed to go make some coffee, to ever feel relaxed, my social anxiety was at an all time high, I had constant chest pains in my heart area (which made me get an ECG and chest X-ray just to confirm that everything was fine), I was sleeping terribly and not long enough. All of which made me come to the conclusion that I hate caffeine.

It's simply not for me.

Now here's the thing. I tried quitting cold turkey and had the most head-splitting headache I've ever had in my life. It was horrible and no amount of Advil ever helped me. That's when I realized that weaning off was probably the better option.

I kept reducing the amount by a little everyday, and while I did feel very sluggish during that point in time, I did manage to reduce the withdrawal symptoms to a minimum. I just couldn't imagine ever dealing with another headache that strong lol. At some point, the amount of caffeine I was consuming was so, so tiny, that I decided to make the transition into zero caffeine.

Life is better now. I can relax, my social anxiety is under control, I don't worry about every little thing going on around me, I can actually sleep better, and I wake up in the mornings full of energy to start the day. Caffeine was making my life miserable and very hard to enjoy. If you feel identified with any of the issues I just described, I'd strongly advice you to quit :)

Long story short, I'm a 35yo female and I'm worried my doctor is dismissing a possible pheochromocytoma.  I know they are very rare, but it fits my symptoms so well and I'm trying to decide if I need to push for her to investigate this more or if anything else could explain my symptoms.

My saga started 7 years ago when I abruptly and out of the blue started having severe panic attacks. I had no previous history of anxiety or panic whatsoever and had spent years traveling and had a career that I loved as an architect. I began having dizzy/lightheaded spells where I just felt weak and had to sit down at job sites when I'd been standing for more than a few minutes. At the time I was 5'-11"" 195lbs, so a little overweight but generally perfectly healthy. I don't smoke, rarely drink, and don't use recreational drugs. Not long after these dizzy/weak spells started, the full blown panic attacks began and nothing has been the same since. 

At the time, my doctor checked my metanephrines with a 24hr urine test and they were elevated, but after a subsequent appointment with endocrinology, they came back at the high end of normal so they stopped looking for answers and sent me to a psychiatrist. I also did a brain MRI and echocardiogram at the time, both of which came back normal. Cortisol was also normal (18). My PCP has dismissed everything as anxiety/weight (even though neither were a factor when the dizzyness first began), but my psychiatrist (an MD I've seen for years) has always wondered if there was an underlying physical cause because the way everything began was so unusual.   
My full list of symptoms:

* Sudden onset of panic attacks with no history
* Rapid weight loss (15 pounds in two weeks), then rapid weight gain (70 pounds in 2 years), though this could be due to taking sertraline. 
* Deficient vitamin D - I took prescription vitamin D at the time this all started and recently had to start again
* Deficient potassium - 2.7 at the worst
* Wildly uncontrolled blood pressure despite taking 250mg labetalol 2x/day, 100mg losartan, 20meq potassium (worst systolic was 202, worst diastolic was 118 and I routinely hit 180s/100s) - BP cuff was cross-checked w/ doctor's office
* Still get very easily lightheaded or dizzy with the slightest physical exertion
* Get sweaty & have significant temperature fluctuations when doing little things like unloading the dishwasher
* Occasional night-sweats, but not all the time
* Consistently high bilirubin levels (1.7-2.1)
* Flushing
* Swollen face before gaining weight
* Sometimes shaky hands (noticed when holding phone or coffee cup)
* Nearly constant feeling like a rubberband is squeezing my head
* Frequently have upper neck/base of skull ache/pain
* Occasional severe pain behind shoulder blades
* I bruise easily (my 6mo niece left little toe shaped bruises on my legs when I bounced her)
* Consistently low transferrin saturation (12-13%)
* Fatigue - I wake up feeling like I barely slept. Coffee doesn't help.
* Brain fog - can't focus to save my life and have the memory of a goldfish. Neither used to be the case.
* Been waking up in the middle of the night feeling weird (for lack of a better word) - lightheaded, tension headache, extremely high BP of around 200/100
* Had one incident at the beginning where I woke up overheated and thirsty and fainted in the middle of the night. At the time I had just started a half dose of lexapro and attributed it to that, but I'm not sure that was the cause. 
* Attacks that feel like gallbladder attacks w/ a confirmed gallstone (via ultrasound) - central pain just below rib cage that eases slightly if I press on it. Over the counter pain meds didn't put a dent in the pain and at the worst I was also nauseous and sweaty
* Discovered >50% stenosis of celiac artery during a vascular ultrasound, but all others are normal

As a result of the gallbladder ultrasound they incidentally discovered 2 golf ball sized cysts on my right kidney (one simple, the other bozniak 2), one of which was located on the upper pole. It took some convincing, but I talked my doctor into doing an abdominal CT to check out the cyst on the upper pole because of all of my previously listed symptoms and the proximity to the adrenal gland. It showed ""numerous"" cysts on both kidneys including a large one on the upper pole of my right kidney. They've said this could possibly be polycystic kidney disease and didn't mention anything about the adrenal glands being abnormal, but looking at the CT it looks to me like it could be affected. So, I'm wondering, could I be on the right track wondering about pheochromocytoma? Should I drop this? Is there anything else that could make sense of all this? Does the CT look like the adrenal glands could be affected? Really appreciate any help!

Here are CT stills: [https://imgur.com/a/Xfgevta](https://imgur.com/a/Xfgevta)

* TSH
* Ferritin
* A1C

I was diagnosed with CU officially 2 weeks ago but have been experiencing symptoms for more than 2.5 months and self-diagnosed CU a while ago. I’ve been struggling mentally this year as I tragically lost my mother suddenly in March about 2 months before my wedding. I then started a new job a few months later.  The emotional/mental stress and pressure I’ve been under has been extreme to say the least. When my symptoms of CU first started I thought I was eating something that caused it but soon discovered it was all heat & exercise induced.

I’ve seen a dermatologist, functional medicine doctor who offers acupuncture and herbs, and a doctor through OneMedical. All have given me the same diagnosis with confirmation that there is no known cure but that CU can spontaneously end for people. The acupuncturist is seemingly the most confident that we can find a way to calm my nervous system with combined therapy of herbs and consistent acupuncture treatment. So far, I’ve enjoyed the sessions but will report back after I start taking the herbs she recommended.

My doctor through OneMedical recommended I take a high dose of Claritin anti-histamines to cope and to keep trying to exercise. My dermatologist offered me a prescription of Doxepin which is antidepressant that has a side effect of lowering histamines, but I don’t think I’ll go that route before I try a more natural regimen due to the potential side effects and risk of withdrawal. I’m also planning to cut back on alcohol, coffee, gluten, and dairy for 30 days and eat a very whole/plant forward diet to see if healing my gut helps rebalance my body’s ability to process histamines and prevent these breakouts.

I'm experimenting with summarising Atom Habits in story form in order to make it easier to remember the concepts described in it. I would like to know what you think about this approach, and ways in which it could be improved.

Here are the first 5 summaries, one per chapter (1 through 5).

# 1. The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

Emily was feeling stuck in her life. She often found herself making big plans for change, only to give up after a few weeks when results didn't come fast enough. One day, while reflecting on her frustration, she met an older woman named Margaret, who seemed to carry a calm wisdom about her. Emily shared her struggles with self-improvement, and Margaret, with a knowing smile, offered to help.

Margaret began by telling Emily a story about British cycling. In 2003, British Cycling was one of the least successful teams in the world. But a new coach, Dave Brailsford, changed everything with a simple approach—what he called ""the aggregation of marginal gains."" Instead of looking for big changes, he sought out tiny improvements in everything, from bike design to the riders' recovery techniques. These small improvements compounded over time, and soon the British team went from mediocrity to dominating the sport.

Emily was intrigued. Margaret explained that this principle applies to habits in everyday life. “Imagine,” she said, “if you could improve just 1% each day. It may seem insignificant, but over time, those small improvements would add up to something extraordinary.”

Margaret could see the doubt in Emily’s eyes, so she elaborated: “People often overestimate the importance of big moments and underestimate the power of small habits. The truth is, habits are like compound interest. Good ones help you improve, while bad ones can quietly pull you down.”

Over tea, Margaret helped Emily see how this could change her approach to life. “You see, Emily, every decision, every small action, compounds over time. If you improve by just 1% each day, by the end of the year, you’ll be 37 times better than you were when you started. But it also works in reverse: if you get 1% worse, you’ll eventually find yourself in a much worse place.”

Emily began to grasp the idea. She didn’t need to focus on massive, sweeping changes but instead on tiny, consistent improvements. Margaret offered one more piece of wisdom: “The key is to forget about big goals for now and focus on the systems you build around yourself. Systems are what lead to real progress.”

Margaret’s words hit home. Instead of aiming for grand achievements, Emily realized she needed to create small, manageable habits that could grow over time. Her success wouldn’t come from one big action but from many tiny actions repeated daily.

In the weeks that followed, Emily applied Margaret’s advice. She stopped focusing on drastic transformations and embraced small habits like setting her clothes out the night before for the gym, reading just a few pages of a book each day, and eating one healthier meal each week. Slowly, those small changes started to add up, and Emily began to notice the progress she had once thought impossible.

Whenever Emily felt impatient or frustrated, she remembered Margaret’s story about the British cycling team. Just as they had achieved greatness through tiny, consistent improvements, so could she. And with that thought, she kept moving forward, one small step at a time.

# 2. How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)

Emily had been working on improving herself for a few weeks, following the advice of her mentor, Margaret, who had taught her the power of making small, daily changes. While Emily had seen some progress, she still felt held back by her deeper habits—those old patterns that seemed to resist change.

One sunny afternoon, during a walk in the park, Emily confided in Margaret. “I’ve been trying so hard, but some things just won’t change.”

Margaret smiled, a knowing look in her eyes. “That’s because real change doesn’t just come from what you do; it comes from who you believe you are. Let me explain.”

She went on to tell Emily that true transformation happens at different levels. “Imagine peeling an onion,” Margaret said. “On the outside, you have your goals and results—things like losing weight, learning a new skill, or getting a promotion. Most people think that’s where they need to start. But the real power comes from deeper layers. Beneath the results are your habits—the things you do regularly. And at the core, you’ll find the most important layer: your identity. That’s who you believe you are.”

Emily listened intently, trying to absorb this new perspective. Margaret continued, “Most people make the mistake of focusing on the outer layers, trying to achieve certain goals without ever considering who they want to become. If you want lasting change, you need to shift your identity first.”

Margaret then shared a story of a man who had a lifelong habit of biting his nails. He tried everything to quit but could never fully break the habit. One day, he decided to do something different—he got a manicure. Seeing how nice his nails looked, he started to take pride in them, something he had never done before. From that point on, he saw himself as someone who cared about his appearance, and the nail-biting habit disappeared. It wasn’t about willpower; it was about a shift in identity.

The story resonated with Emily. She had always approached change by setting goals and trying to force herself to follow new routines. But now she realized that she had never truly changed how she saw herself. She wanted to lose weight and be more disciplined, but deep down, she still thought of herself as someone who struggled with health and motivation.

Margaret’s next words were simple but powerful. “If you want to become the best version of yourself, you need to start with your identity. Instead of saying, ‘I want to be fit,’ say, ‘I am someone who cares for my body.’ When you start seeing yourself differently, your actions will follow naturally.”

Emily started thinking about her own goals differently. Instead of focusing on the outcome, she began to focus on who she wanted to be. She no longer aimed just to eat better or exercise more; she decided to see herself as a healthy person who valued her well-being. Every time she made a healthy choice, she was reinforcing that new identity. And with each small step, she was building a stronger version of herself.

Margaret reminded her that it wasn’t about being perfect. “You don’t need to do everything right all the time,” she said. “Every small action is like casting a vote for the person you want to become. You just need more votes for the new you than the old you.”

Emily took this advice to heart. She began focusing on small actions that reflected her new identity. Instead of forcing herself to work out or eat well, she embraced the mindset of someone who enjoyed taking care of herself. Slowly but steadily, the changes became easier, and her new habits started to feel more natural.

The real shift came when Emily realized that the power of change wasn’t in achieving a specific goal but in becoming the kind of person who naturally did the things she once found difficult. She wasn’t just someone who read books occasionally; she was a reader. She wasn’t someone who occasionally worked out; she was an active, healthy person.

As weeks passed, Emily felt lighter, not just in her body but in her mind. She no longer chased after big results, but instead, she embraced the daily actions that aligned with who she wanted to be. And with each day, she cast another vote for her new identity.

Margaret’s wisdom had given Emily a new lens through which to view her journey. The key to lasting change wasn’t just about setting goals—it was about becoming the kind of person who naturally lived in alignment with those goals.

And so, Emily continued to grow, one small habit at a time, each step reinforcing the person she was becoming.

# 3. How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps

Emily had been working on her habits, feeling progress but also sensing there was something she still didn’t fully grasp. One afternoon, during another walk with Margaret, she finally voiced her thoughts.

“Margaret, I think I’m getting the hang of making small changes, but how do habits really form? I want to know how to make them stick.”

Margaret nodded knowingly. “Ah, that’s a great question, Emily. It all starts with understanding how habits form naturally in our brains. Let me tell you about a psychologist named Edward Thorndike. He ran an experiment with cats. The cats were put in a puzzle box, and they had to figure out how to escape. At first, they stumbled around, trying anything, but eventually, they learned that pulling a lever would set them free. Once they figured that out, they began to escape faster and faster until it became almost automatic. That’s how habits work—through repetition, what starts as a struggle eventually becomes something we barely think about.”

Emily was intrigued. “So, our brains make habits to make things easier?”

“Exactly,” Margaret smiled. “Your brain loves efficiency. Once it finds a solution that works, it turns it into a habit to save energy for more complex decisions. This process is called the **habit loop**. It’s made up of four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward. Think of your morning coffee, for example.”

Emily laughed. “I know exactly what you mean. When I wake up, I feel groggy—that’s the cue, right?”

“Exactly,” Margaret affirmed. “The grogginess is the cue, and what you want is to feel more awake—that’s the craving. The **response** is making and drinking the coffee, and the **reward** is the feeling of alertness afterward. This loop repeats, and that’s why you do it almost automatically every morning.”

Emily nodded, finally understanding why certain behaviors had become so ingrained. “But how can I use this to form better habits?”

Margaret paused, then began explaining. “There are **Four Laws of Behavior Change** that you can use to make good habits stick or to break bad ones. First, **Make It Obvious**. To build a habit, you need to make the cue really clear. If you want to start drinking more water, keep a bottle on your desk where you can see it easily.”

“Okay, that makes sense,” Emily said. “And the second?”

“The second law is **Make It Attractive**,” Margaret continued. “You need to make the habit appealing. For instance, if you want to exercise more, pair it with something you love. Maybe listen to your favorite music while you work out. It turns the habit into something you look forward to.”

“That could really help with my motivation,” Emily said thoughtfully.

Margaret smiled. “Exactly. And the third law is **Make It Easy**. If a habit is too hard, you’re less likely to stick with it. Break things down. If you want to start reading more, don’t plan on finishing a whole chapter right away. Start with just a few pages. Make it easy enough that you won’t skip it.”

Emily laughed. “I always get overly ambitious and then end up doing nothing.”

“Most of us do,” Margaret agreed. “But starting small really helps. The fourth law is **Make It Satisfying**. Give yourself a little reward when you complete the habit. It could be as simple as crossing it off a list, which can be surprisingly satisfying, or treating yourself after a week of consistency.”

Emily grinned. “I like the sound of that.”

Margaret looked at her, her eyes twinkling. “And don’t forget, it works the other way too. If you want to break a bad habit, make the cue invisible, make it unattractive, make it hard, and make it unsatisfying.”

That evening, Emily decided to put Margaret’s advice to work. She wanted to cut back on her late-night snacking, which she knew wasn’t helping her. So, she moved the snacks to the highest shelf in the cupboard, making the cue invisible and the habit harder to follow. To replace it, she made drinking herbal tea attractive by buying a few new flavors she’d been wanting to try. Slowly, she noticed her cravings for snacks decreasing and her enjoyment of her evening tea growing.

With each day, Emily felt more in control of her habits. Margaret’s wisdom helped her see that it wasn’t about fighting herself but about working with her brain and making changes that set her up for success. As the weeks went by, Emily realized she was not just trying to form habits; she was actively shaping the kind of person she wanted to be, one small action at a time.

# 4. The Man Who Didn’t Look Right

Emily's journey to improve her life continued, and she was starting to see real change in her habits. However, during a chat over tea with Margaret, Emily admitted, ""I think I’m getting better, but sometimes I catch myself doing things automatically, and it feels like I’m not fully in control.""

Margaret smiled knowingly. “Emily, a big part of building habits is understanding that many of our actions are driven by instinct without us fully realizing it. Let me tell you a story about a firefighter I once knew. He was on a routine call, inspecting a building, when he suddenly got an overwhelming feeling that something was wrong. He couldn’t point to anything specific, but his gut told him they had to evacuate. Moments later, the ceiling collapsed in the very area where they had been standing. He couldn’t explain why he knew it was dangerous—his years of experience had trained his brain to recognize the subtle signs of danger, even before his conscious mind caught up.”

Emily looked intrigued. Margaret continued, “Our brains are constantly learning like that, picking up on patterns until they become automatic. We do the same with our habits, forming routines that our brains execute without needing to think. To build new habits, we first need to become aware of these unconscious patterns and start to reshape them.”

Emily nodded. “So, I need to figure out what triggers my habits?”

“Exactly,” Margaret replied. “It’s about becoming more aware of what’s happening. Habits often become invisible to us, like grabbing a cookie without thinking about it. To truly change, you need to bring those unconscious actions into the light.”

Margaret shared a strategy called the **Habits Scorecard**. “Make a list of everything you do each day, no matter how small—wake up, check your phone, brush your teeth. Then, mark each one as a good, bad, or neutral habit based on whether it supports who you want to be. This helps you become more aware of what you’re doing, and awareness is the first step to change.”

Emily took Margaret’s advice and made her own Habits Scorecard. She noticed many little habits she hadn’t even thought about—checking her phone first thing in the morning, which often left her feeling stressed before she even got out of bed, or eating snacks while watching TV just because they were nearby.

“Once you know your habits,” Margaret explained, “you can start changing them. There’s also a technique called **Pointing-and-Calling**. It helps to speak your actions out loud. If you’re about to eat a cookie, say, ‘I’m about to eat this cookie. Do I really need it?’ Hearing it makes you more aware of what you’re doing and helps you decide if that action supports your goals.”

Emily liked the idea. She started trying it, saying her actions aloud, especially for habits she wanted to break. One night, as she reached for snacks during her favorite show, she paused and said, “I’m grabbing these snacks, but I’m not actually hungry. I just want something to do.” That small moment of awareness helped her put the snacks away and replace them with herbal tea.

Margaret’s guidance was helping Emily not just to build new habits but also to understand and change the unconscious behaviors holding her back. She realized that creating the life she wanted wasn’t just about starting good habits but also about breaking the cycle of bad ones by becoming truly aware of what she was doing.

With each new day, Emily felt more present in her actions. She was not just on autopilot anymore but instead actively shaping her behaviors, one conscious choice at a time. And with each habit she changed, she felt herself moving closer to the person she wanted to be.

# 5. The Best Way to Start a New Habit

Emily’s journey of self-improvement continued with steady progress, but she still faced moments when her new habits didn’t stick. One afternoon, while sipping tea with Margaret, Emily confessed, “I’ve been trying to make time for new habits, but I often find myself forgetting or just getting distracted.”

Margaret smiled, ready to offer her next lesson. “Emily, the key to making habits stick is not just motivation. It’s about having a specific plan—a way to anchor those habits into your routine.”

Emily looked interested, so Margaret continued. “There was a study done with three groups of people trying to exercise more. One group just tracked their workouts. Another received motivational information about the benefits of exercise. But it was the third group that saw the biggest success. They were asked to write down exactly when and where they would exercise, using a simple sentence like, ‘I will work out for 20 minutes on Monday at 5 PM in the park.’ Over 90% of that group ended up exercising each week—more than twice the rate of the other groups.”

Emily nodded, understanding. “So, it’s not just about saying I want to do something. I need to have a clear plan?”

“Exactly,” Margaret confirmed. “The technique is called an **implementation intention**. It helps you plan out exactly when and where a habit will happen. Too often, we say things like ‘I want to read more’ or ‘I should exercise,’ but we don’t specify when or where. The clearer your plan, the more likely you are to actually follow through. It makes it easy for your brain to know what to do.”

Emily decided to try it out. She wrote, “I will practice yoga for 15 minutes at 7 AM in my living room.” This clear commitment made it much easier to remember and act on.

Margaret went on, “There’s also a strategy called **habit stacking** that can help. Instead of just deciding on a time, you stack the new habit onto something you already do. For example, if you drink coffee every morning, you can add, ‘After I make my coffee, I will do five minutes of meditation.’ It ties the new habit to something you already do every day, making it easier to remember.”

Emily loved this idea. “So, if I’m already brushing my teeth in the morning, I could add something like, ‘After I brush my teeth, I’ll write three things I’m grateful for.’ It links it directly to something I never forget to do.”

“Exactly!” Margaret said, pleased with Emily’s understanding. “The more specific you are, the better. The **habit stacking** formula is simple: ‘After \[current habit\], I will \[new habit\].’ It works because it creates a natural flow—your brain starts to associate one action with the next.”

That evening, Emily decided to put both ideas to work. She wrote down her plan: “I will read for 15 minutes after dinner at the kitchen table.” She also stacked a new habit onto her morning routine: “After I make my bed, I will do five push-ups.” It felt manageable, and she knew she wouldn’t forget to do it since making her bed was already a solid habit.

With each day, Emily found herself growing more consistent. Instead of relying on motivation alone, she was setting up her environment and routine in a way that supported her goals. Implementing these specific plans helped her remember what she wanted to do, and stacking new habits onto old ones helped them fit seamlessly into her life.

Margaret’s guidance made Emily realize that building good habits wasn’t just about determination; it was also about being strategic and practical. By using implementation intentions and habit stacking, Emily felt her new behaviors were starting to stick. She wasn’t just changing what she did—she was becoming more deliberate in how she shaped her day, one small, planned step at a time.",1,1728938662.0,getdisciplined,0,0.67,False

I read this article today and based on some of the posts and comments on here I'd have to agree that in this demographic you can see that it makes some very good points. It seems the western world has problematised sleep unnecessarily to the extent that it is becoming a dysfunctional obsession for many people. It just so happens that the sleep industry, of which Garmin is part, is incredibly profitable.

Check it out, it might be a useful reminder that constantly monitoring stats is potentially dysfunctional and may be unnecessarily affecting mental health. You often read words like ""guilt""and ""shame"" etc here because someone had a bad nights sleep from coffee or booze.

The most interesting part of this article for me is the study that demonstrated people who ""thought"" they had a bad nights sleep actually managed to convince themselves they were feeling terrible the next day, even if their sleep was quantifiably ""good"".

I like having the data available, and I don't obsess over it, but I can see that it is very seductive (seeing as I have a tendency to obsess over other aspects of life). It's marketed in such a way that you could easily get overly concerned about data. I guess the message might be: remind one's self to moderate interpretation and don't place undue faith in a watch to dictate how one feels in life, particularly when the results are questionable when applied across the full gamut of humanity, and the models used to calculate the output use a relatively limited amount of input from a wrist reading. 

I assume most people are aware of this, but you often read some pretty hyperbolic posts on here about sleep quality and how people go to excessive lengths and behavioural adjustments to make the data fit the ""ideal"". ",2,1728938311.0,Garmin,2,1.0,False

(Rough draft/unfinished),"The expectation is that by next year, the entirety of our young men and women will be transferred to affiliated services. The semester itself hasn’t been without adversity and it must be acknowledged that the actions taken by our trusted staff have been done soley out of necessity. We were all there–Joan, Lincoln, David “The Rouse” Kallander, Morgan and myself. It was Wednesday morning and the sun was yet to rise. Lincoln was pouring himself a cup of coffee in the break room and was doing so inattentively, his eyes focused on the television, where a grating electronic buzz was emitting from its speakers. “This damn thing! This damn thing!” He continued yelling at it as though it were a disobedient child. I was sitting in my office with the door closed, responding to an email when I heard him shouting inappropriately down the hallway. He was shouting my name. I followed his hoarse cries into the break room, where he was pacing back and forth. “What the hell is wrong with the tv, man?!? This damn thing keeps buzzing so loud and it’s hurting my goddamn ears!” I requested he calm down, as I was beginning to understand where he was coming from everytime he opened his mouth to speak. “Let me check this out.” I pulled up a chair from one of the tables to examine the speakers. “Which one was it coming from?” I asked. He pointed to the left one. The left speaker appeared just fine so I asked him if he was sure it was the left side speaker. He insisted it was, so I examined the right speaker to be sure. Although the right speaker appeared fine, I decided to apply gentle pressure and when I did, the buzzing suddenly grew louder and sharper, like the tip of a knife on a handsaw. I placed my hand over my ear and used the other to press it down once more. The sound became even more deafening than before. Lincoln was on his knees, covering both ears and groaning loudly. It was at this precise moment that Joan hurriedly entered the break room and asked what was going on. “Something’s up with the television. We don’t know what it is.” Joan walked over to me and removed a screwdriver from the back pocket of her jeans. She took my spot on the chair and looked behind it. She suggested we take it apart to which I asked her if that was necessary. “It may be the only way.” She unscrewed the television from the metal slabs that were holding it up on the wall and passed it to me. I placed the television on a table with the cables stretched out across the room. Lincoln was still on the ground. “Can you get him a glass of water or something?” asked Joan. 

So she and I opened up the television. Joan has always been better with technology, so I just sat back and watched as she manipulated cables and flipped switches. After about thirty minutes, Joan stopped. She asked if anyone else knows anything about how to fix a television, since it was Mark from the IT department’s day off. I knew David was good with computers, however, I didn’t know if he knew anything about televisions. Nonetheless, I decided to page him to the break room. After a dry four minutes, I heard heavy footsteps coming down the hallway getting closer to the break room. David’s known as, “The Rouse” since he was a garrulous older man with an abundance of vigor. “How's it going!?” He exclaimed, turning to Lincoln on the floor. “The fucks up with the kid?” “He’s alright, can you help us fix this TV?” David practically threw his body into a chair and began examining the television in a manner akin to Joan. He mumbled under his breath as he poked around. “I dunno what’s up with this thing. It’s making a fucking horrible noise though.” “It’s terrible and it’s been going on all morning.” The sound seemed as though it was getting worse, and as more time passed, everyone grew more and more irritable. Lincoln eventually calmed down and chose to sit alone in a chair sipping his cup of coffee. I got up from my seat and began to make myself a cup as well. “Would anyone else like a cup of coffee?” I asked. “I’ll take one,” said The Rouse. “Five tablespoons of sugar, I presume?” “Of course! Always five tablespoons!” He sat back in his chair and began to light a cigarette. “Ya know” He said, “Why don’t we just get a new TV?” “I say we try to fix this one before we go out and get a new one.” said Joan, reaching across the table and pulling The Rouse’s box of cigarettes from the front pocket of his brown work shirt. He tried to snatch it away in mid air but fell short. She took one from the box and threw it back at him. “Well, I don’t wanna be fixing this thing for the entire shift, that’s for fucking sure!” “Calm down, it isn’t even sev-” Her sentence was cut short by the sound of broken glass hitting the marble floor. Lincoln accidentally swiped his coffee cup off the table. “Shit, shit, shit!” He said. “Don’t worry, I’ll clean this up.”

Slow service irks me, so I stopped a barista and asked, *""She ordered a hot chocolate. Do you know when it will be ready?""* And then turned back to continue our conversation.

Our talk had turned to this subreddit and I explained how it was my attempt to help develop our community, to create a safe space for local trans people to speak freely, without fear. My companion listened quietly, but suddenly tears welled up in their eyes. I asked what was wrong...and was angrily informed that my attitude ""*Sucks.""*

Take aback, I asked what I'd done wrong. My companion responded with hurt and bitterness about my reference to them as ""she"" when I spoke to the barista, and how I explained my personal experience with the transgender community using binary terms. They felt I'd disrespected them, a non-binary trans, with my careless words.

I was embarrassed and felt like a fool.

I could try to explain away my faux pas as nothing more than a slip of the tongue; an unconscious lapse in gender pronoun protocol. I could make excuses, but the fact is I was ignorant. Ignorant of their self-definition of being non-binary trans. Ignorant of using a binary pronoun to describe them carelessly. Ignorant of binarily trans-splaining my personal experience.

It was then that I realized that the entirety of my transgender experience has occurred within the exclusive confines of self-described trans women and trans men. Unintentionally, a non-binary person was never knowingly part of my circle of friends. As hard as it is to admit--I was as limited as any cis person who claims they've never met met a trans person.

Understanding the non-binary self-definition is itself a difficult concept to pin down. On the [**Planned Parenthood**](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/) site, one person states:

[***""Being nonbinary means your gender doesn’t fit into the strict male-or-female gender binary. You might identify as nonbinary if your gender falls somewhere between male and female, or if your gender doesn’t quite fit into either of those categories. Nonbinary people may also identify differently depending on the day and how they feel — they may identify as a woman one day, a man the next, and nonbinary or genderqueer on others. Some people say they’re nonbinary to keep a conversation short and simple — and add their other identities when they want to share more. Nonbinary can also be used as a general term to mean “not cisgender.”***](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/blog/can-i-be-both-transgender-and-nonbinary)

[***""It’s up to you how you identify (and what you tell people about that identity). If you feel gender euphoria when you tell others you’re transgender and nonbinary, say it! You might also want to experiment with which label you want to say first. For example, someone who transitioned and sees their transness as outside the gender binary might feel best saying they’re a nonbinary trans woman or nonbinary trans man.""***](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/blog/can-i-be-both-transgender-and-nonbinary)

It is the fact of self-definition that apparently complicates even the assertion of being non-binary for the person themselves. As reported in the **International Journal of Transgender Health**:

[***""Estimates of the numbers of non-binary people vary. In a survey in the United Kingdom (UK) with 14,320 responses from trans people, almost 52% identified as non-binary (Government Equalities Office, 2018). However, Nieder, T’Sjoen, Bouman, and Motmans (2018) conducted a comprehensive literature analysis that indicated that approximately 80% of trans people identify as exclusively male or female, which leaves 20% to individuals with a gender falling outside of or between male and female identities.""***](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6830997/)

Even though the majority of the transgender community is not non-binary, it doesn't excuse my casual default to binary terms. I'll try to be better, to be even more inclusive in my words and my actions.

And if you are non-binary trans and reading this--please speak up. Give me and others trapped in the binary bind some idea of your life experience. Tell us where we slip up, teach us when we are wrong.

I opened the lid and the pod chamber has a steam coming out, feels really hot. the pod itself is wrinkled, but not punctured at the back, nor perforated in the front. 
I have tried resetting the machine since and so far has only got it to work again for one time, with a few more pods ending up in similar wrinkled condition. I suspect it is a result of the hot water/steam somehow flowing around the pod, but not able to flow through the pod.

So I'm a CMA caregiver and part time life engagement activities assistant at an end of life neurology facility. I absolutely adored the job, love my patients, but after a horrible series of unfortunate events, I threw in the towel last week. I was underpaid and being passed over, led on, seeing neglect and blatant abuse of power, etc.

I saw people saying how hard it is to land a job right now and got nervous. I lucked out because my first interview Friday, they contacted me this morning to offer me the position at 3 dollars more an hour than my current facility.

I accepted and have started filling out the paperwork. My current boss then frantically tried to reach out, asking to meet for coffee to work out whatever went wrong, finally we talked on the phone......so we talked. I let it all out.
I was offered a smaller pay raise, a promotion, blah blah.

I'm honestly so emotionally tied to my current job. My patients. I fully planned on staying until I graduated college (something I had to put on hold due to life circumstances) but I was drained and disgusted at how my facility was acting and treating me, lots of false promises, lots of retraction of things, lots of shadiness going on, disrespect, abuse which I cannot abide by (and NO medical professional should), etc.


My new job offer, it's seriously way more desirable, less workload (patient services representative/administration), right by my house........
But I'm attached to the residential facility I'm still at and I know I'd never be fired if I stayed. Whereas if I take this new job I'll have to learn a whole new environment and role, but for way better quality.


I'm at least doing my two weeks, but just a bit torn. It feels like the obvious answer is to take on the new job and start anew - because I admit I'm scared that my facility will let me down again after stringing me along for a bit further. Then I'll have lost my new opportunity all because I let them talk me into staying.

due to a surgery I quit caffeine 2 weeks ago because I read how caffeine is disturbing the wound healing. Since I wanna have the best wound healing I quit all the bad stuff: alcohol and caffeine. 

I used to drink 3 cups of coffee with some oat milk EVERY day, no matter what. Often I lay in bed in the evening and Iam so excited to drink coffee in the morning again.  
Yep, Iam heavily addicted.

So in the first days I experienced awful headaches. I still drink decaf coffee, but my brain knows that it gets betrayed. Every day I wanna drink caffeine coffee again.

  
I looked up pubmed and there is no study which indicates really bad effects of caffeine beside no sleep because of the long half-life time of caffeine. Since I drink my last coffee at 1 pm Iam usually fine.

I just wanna drink coffee again. I miss going for coffee dates. 

Really dont know if it makes sense for me to quit caffeine containing coffee forever because I don´t feel I have any drawbacks with coffee, just without it...

He works a lot of hours because he makes good money and gets premium pay, and in the colder months, he works 7 days a week with a few overtime shifts a week. It's not a very physical or mentally draining job so that's why he does it. There's always been mild issues with him being on his phone too much, especially during certain sports seasons. I've complained many times about him sitting next to me but not be ""there"" and I when I bring it up, it usually gets better until the week after where the same thing is happening. 

I'll give a specific example that has happened a few times prior. He's been on afternoon shift for 3 weeks now and I only see him when he gets home at 11:30 pm which by that point, I'm already tucked into bed. This weekend, he got to work a day shift on Sunday and would have to work an afternoon shift on Monday which would give us the whole night to spend together which we were both looking forward to. He got home from work yesterday and went straight to the TV to watch a football game, then we had dinner while he was still watching the game. After it was done, he laid down on the couch and went on his phone. I waited for him to get off it so we can watch a movie. He stayed on it for some time and I just put a random movie on. He noticed that I put a movie on and FINALLY put his phone down. 5 minutes later, he falls asleep at 7 pm and didn't wake up until 11am the next day, which is today. I realized he was tired so I just thought that we could spend the morning together before he goes into work.

Anyway, today, he woke up and didn't cuddle me in bed while I was laying down next to him, he got up and makes us both a coffee then drinks it while on his phone. I kept asking him to put it down and he kept saying that he will in a bit. I told him that he didn't spend the time together last night but it would be nice to go for a walk at the park with out dog which he said is a good idea. He stayed on his and when he didn't get off it, I got very frustrated and started cleaning the house. He noticed that I was upset and finally came to hug me and I started telling him that I'm done asking him for attention and this isn't a good way to start our marriage. He didn't really say much and didn't look at me or talk to me for the next few hours until he left to go to work.

I don't know if I'm overreacting. It's just the little things that matter to me and I don't ask him for much. I just want him to be present when he's with me and I've said this to him many times before. If it's like this at the beginning of our marriage, then who knows how it will be a few years from now.

If I had to be honest though, I couldn’t see myself doing anything else. I’m in no way a people-person and farm life around animals is all I’ve ever known – not to mention the obvious neglect some of these poor animals had received which boiled my blood more than anything. But that’s part of why I do what I do.

My greatest challenge yet arrived this morning. Our town mayor dropped off her nearly two-ton prized hog named “Porkchop.” The mayor told me that he had started to get aggressive with age and didn’t feel comfortable keeping him around anymore. She added that since Porkchop didn’t move as well as he used to that the local teens had begun making games out of teasing and throwing objects at the poor animal.

Appalled by the cruelty of people once again, I happily welcomed Porkchop into the sanctuary without hesitation.

Weeks went by in a flash, and I quickly became attached to the large hog. His stunning size was like something out of a fantasy – how could I be anything but mesmerized by such a magnificent creature? It was easy to tell Porkchop had become accustomed to his new space, including me. He regained quite a bit of pep in his step, regularly trotting up to the fence each morning as if to greet me causing the earth to tremble beneath his feet.

Flipping on the news while sipping my morning coffee, I was met with non-stop reports of three missing teens and interviews with their grieving parents. From what I understand, they had all snuck out last night and when morning came – their beds remained empty without so much as a clue.

My only thought process was ""shit happens"" and went about my day routinely. Porkchop didn’t give me his usual greeting sending me into a concerned frenzy for his welfare. I called for him repeatedly before I felt the familiar quakes. He came trotting up to me with what seemed like more energy than ever, instantly relieving my concerns.

That feeling was quickly washed away when I noticed shards of broken beer bottle piercing his skin and him actively chewing on what appeared to be scraps of clothing.

I carefully pulled the shards out and began following him around playfully asking him what he had gotten into. The big guy was smarter than I had given him credit for; he began leading me to one of the furthest corners of his large fenced-off accommodation.

Piled in the corner, I found a massive bloody mess consisting of torn scraps of clothing and undiscernible shattered bones.

I knew at first glance what the remnants belonged to and continued playfully talking to Porkchop,

“Good boy! You sure ate your fill last night, didn’t you?”

As soon as I noticed I went to the vet (not our regular vet to get him treated sooner) and they gave us antibiotics. Fast forward a week and the treatment seems to have done nothing but make him even more uncomfortable. Next we went to our regular vet and, once again, we were given (different) antibiotics. Fast forward 10 days to now and the treatment seems to have done nothing but make him more uncomfortable. I already scheduled another vet visit for tomorrow. The problem seems to only be in the left ear and has not spread.

I would include a photo of the ear discharge if I could but I can't seem to attach images to this post. It's dark brown, not quite black but definitely not a lighter brown. It's about midway down the ear canal and mostly drier than wet. I might assume it might be regular ear wax if he wasn't shaking and scratching and pawing so much. The material itself is almost like scaly slightly slimy shavings. I have found a truly slimy mass once, it was this morning, it looked like it might have a hair or two in it and it was much larger than any clumps of the gunk I've found before, all other whole chunks are smaller than two millimeters in diameter.

No tests have been done or suggested yet. He's on heartgard chews and bravecto. Considering 2 different antibiotics seemed to have no effect, if be very surprised if this was still bacterial. I haven't noticed a smell but I noticed the problem early on and he's been medicated since then so his ear has smelled like medicine since then. 

Not sure if it could be yeast or an allergic reaction but, based on what I've seen/read online, plus having had dogs with ear mites in the past, the ""used coffee grounds or dryish shoe polish"" along with the lack of smell and ineffectiveness of antibiotics, it's very difficult for me to think this isn't ear mites despite the heartgard.

Is it possible it could still be ear mites despite the heartgard? Before the appointment tomorrow, can anybody give me some advice for what tests I should start with? I also recently learned my cat has hyperthyroidism and needs medication so the bills are piling up at the vet, any direction would be immensely appreciated. Would a RAST or serum test be appropriate or would I be jumping the gun? I'm dreading the vet tomorrow because, researching all my options, I'm worried I'll get stuck with a $1000+ bill tomorrow for testing that could return no useful results and I'll have spent all this time and money to not really help him",1,1728937256.0,AskVet,1,1.0,False

I just got back from my trip and wanted to leave a report in case it helps anyone else plan their trip. A quick note: this is technically my second trip to Japan, but since my first was a study abroad semester, I've done most of the more ""typical"" things during my semester abroad (Ex. Shibuya Sky, Kiyomizu-dera, Osaka Castle). So that's why they're excluded from my itinerary.  


**Luggage:** I brought one large suitcase, one duffle, and one backpack. The duffle was for overnight trips, which came in handy. Though I didn't plan on using luggage-forwarding, I ended up using it once my big suitcase got too heavy. 

**$$$:** I brought the equivalent of $1000 USD in yen. I used it pretty sparingly and put most of my expenses on my credit card. I have the Bilt card and highly recommend it: no transaction fees and I stayed at most of the hotels for free by redeeming them with Bilt points. Really helped keep my costs down. 

**Shinkansen Reservation:** for all trains on the main island, I used the SmartEx app to reserve seats with oversized luggage space. Pretty easy to do and no charges for changing the time of the train on the day of if you suddenly realize you can't make a train. I bought the All-Area Kyushu Rail 7-day pass, starting from the Hakata-Kumamoto trip. I did the math and it was much more worth it than buying each ticket separately. To reserve an over-sized luggage seat with the pass, just go to the JR Station Office and the staff there will help you do that. 

**Day 1: Arrive in Tokyo** 

* I arrived pretty late (6pm) so I just had dinner with a friend before tuning in for the night
* **Hotel:** APA Hotel Ningyosho Eki Kita 
   * Close to several different subway lines; 35-ish minute train ride to Disneyland
   * Room was pretty small and it was hard to maneuver my big suitcase in the room. 
   * I chose it for its proximity to the Yurakucho BicCamera lol

**Day 2: Tokyo Disneyland**

* I downloaded the Tokyo Disney Resort App and used the Priority Pass & Standby Passes. I didn't need to get the paid Disney Premier Access and went on all the rides I wanted Ex. Pooh's Hunny Hunt, Beauty & the Beast, Big Thunder Mountain
* Highly recommend staying for the Electrical Parade Dreamlights show at night!
* Didn't go to the new Fantasy Springs since that was in Disneysea
* Paid out of pocket

**Day 3: Kyoto/Kibune**

* Took the 6:42 AM Shinkansen to Kyoto Stn. Dropped off bags at hotel, and then took transport to Kibune. Ended up just taking the bus there and the train back. 
* **Activities:** 
   * Hirobun - read online that the wait time was long so I went here first to get a number
      * The nagashi somen was pretty worth it as an experience, I think. Definitely had better food during the trip but I do recommend trying this. 
   * Hyoue Cafe - kawadoko-style cafe; can have desserts and lattes while dipping your feet into the river
   * Kifune Shrine - really pretty but pretty overcrowded. Hard to get nice pictures of the scenery without getting 10000 people in. 
      * the mizu-mikuji was pretty cool (omikuji in water) 
      * also got a goshuin here
   * I considered doing the hike to Kuramadera but I wasn't dressed for hiking and the bugs were pretty intense
   * Went back to Kyoto around 4pm and spent a few hours shopping at Nishiki Market
      * if you love spicy food, highly recommend Ochanoko saisai!
* **Hotel:** Kyoto Universal Hotel Karasuma
   * It looked pretty close to Kyoto Station on Google maps, but in reality, it was a bit of a walk and not really accessible if you have a big luggage (it wasn't a big deal for me) 
   * Paid for with Bilt Points
   * Included a half-board (2 meals) and had an onsen!

**Day 4: Amanohashidate**

* I left my big suitcase at the Kyoto hotel and just took my duffle bag on the bus. I booked the bus ticket in advance on this [website](https://japanbusonline.com/en/BookInquiry/). The trip was from 7:20 am to 9:25 am. 
* I rented a bike from [this store](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AiYQswMxacfmEzTR9). The area was pretty bikeable in my opinion. 
* **Attractions:** 
   * Amanohashidate View Land - took the monorail up (chair-lift was not working)
      * had pudding 
      * tried and failed at the pottery toss
      * Bought a ""ryu no onegaidama"" for Naraiji Temple
      * Tried matanozoki (looking between your legs) - VERY cool experience
   * Chionji Temple - got goshuin and the fan omikuji
   * Biked across the sandbar
   * Had lunch at Hashidate Chaya (located on the sandbar)
   * Biked to Kasamatsu Park - went to Manai Shrine, Motoise Kono Jinja to get goshuin, and then took the chairlift up to another lookout
   * Hiked to Naraiji from the park (half an hour?)
   * I considered biking to Ine but it was getting a bit late and I had to return my bike back to the original shop to get my deposit back. 
* **Hotel:** Auberge Amanohashidate
   * LOVED this spot! Paid out of pocket for the stay and dinner at the restaurant. But you get access to the big onsen at Amanohashidate Hotel next door. The bathrooms are shared but since each room has its own faucet, I didn't find this to be inconvenient. 

**Day 5: Uji**

* I took the earliest bus (booked through same link as above) back to Kyoto Station and because the hotel was again, kind of far, I left my duffle in a coin locker at the station and went directly to Uji
* **Attractions:** 
   * Byodo-in Temple and Museum - pretty cool but looking back, I don't think it's necessary to wait around to go see the Phoenix Hall. It's just one room and the tour is given in Japanese. You do get a brief brochure in your preferred language but it's definitely not as thorough as what the guide is saying
   * Uji-Shrine and Ujigami-Jinja - these two are next to each other and if you love bunnies, they have lots of cute rabbit motifs
   * Walked along Uji River and to To-no-shima Island
   * Tsuen Tea House - had lunch here (cha soba), had ice cream, and bought souvenirs 
   * Mimurotoji Temple - a bit of a walk from the other attractions (40min-1hr) but I thought it was nice
   * Walked through Byodo-in Omotesando Street and bought souvenirs

**Day 6: Osaka/Katsuoji**

* Left Kyoto early-ish, dropped off stuff at hotel, and headed to Katsuoji. Be mindful of the bus times. Katsuoji took half a day, and I spent the rest of the day in the Namba area.
* **Attractions:**
   * Katsuoji Temple - really cool experience seeing all the darumas and completing the 6 stamps postcard
   * Lunch at Cinnamoroll Cafe in Namba
   * Namba Yasaka Shrine 
   * Had dinner in Dotonbori
   * went to Umeda Sky Building at night - the escalator was super cool
* **Hotel:** Sunny Stone Hotel
   * I really liked the location: it was 8 minutes by subway from Shin-Osaka Station, so it was easy to get there right after getting off the shinkansen. Highly recommend staying near Shin-Osaka Station rather than Osaka Station. 
   * Paid for with Bilt Points
   * Breakfast included

  
**Day 7: Universal Studios Japan**

* Went mostly for the Demon Slayer attraction lol
* I got on pretty much every ride without waiting a long time since I was a solo rider. If you're by yourself or don't mind sitting with strangers, this is a faster option and you don't need to buy a fast pass or anything. 
* Kinopio Cafe - had lunch here. Reservations are pretty hard to get so try to get this as soon as possible. 
* I got the time reservation for the Harry Potter and Nintendo areas
* Stayed for Halloween Nights - it was alright

  
**Day 8: Himeji**

* To be honest, there wasn't much to do here other than the castle. I considered doing Engyoji Temple and Mount Shosha too but was too tired. 
* **Attractions:**
   * Himeji Castle - they had a lot of English descriptions in the castle so it was quite interesting to learn about the castle and its inhabitants' stories
   * Miyuki Shopping Street
   * Koko-en Garden + Soju-an Teahouse
* **Hotel:** Himeji Station Universal Hotel South Exit
   * included half-board and onsen
   * Paid with Bilt Points
* Overall: I'm glad I got to see Himeji Castle since it's a national treasure, but I don't think I'd return again.

**Day 9: Okunoshima (rabbit island)**

* Had some transportation mishaps getting here. My shinkansen was delayed by 40 minutes and threw off all the local transportation I had planned. The local train doesn't run that often from Mihara Stn. (shinkansen) to Tadanoumi Port, where you catch the ferry to the island
* Remember to buy pellets at the cafe at Tadano-umi port! They don't sell pellets on the island. But also hold off on buying souvenirs at the cafe since there are more/better ones at the Island hotel shop. 
   * I bought 4 packs and ran out. The rabbits are especially hungry at dawn and twilight. 
* The island is pretty small so I opted for walking rather than biking. Finished walking in half a day. 
* The poison gas museum is just 2 rooms and everything is in Japanese so it wasn't a big part of my trip
* Overall: coming to rabbit island has been a dream of mine since I was very young since I love bunnies and owned bunnies. I'm glad I came but I met some activists(?) on the island who exposed me to issues such as how none of the money generated from tourists goes towards the rabbits' care (there were several rabbits who looked in need of vet care). The rabbit population is also noticeably smaller than Youtube videos from 10 years ago show. 
* **Hotel:** Kyukamura Ohkunoshima
   * Included a breakfast and dinner buffet, and two onsens
   * Paid out of pocket
   * Honestly one of the friendliest accommodations I've stayed at. The staff is very diverse and love engaging guests in conversation. 
   * The hotel gift shop also has great souvenirs
   * There's also a cafe attached to the hotel. I didn't eat there but a lot of day-trippers did. 
   * The hotel also has a ""umi hotaru show"" at night, which was pretty cool

**Day 10: Fukuoka** 

* **Attractions:**
   * Tochoji Temple
   * Kushida Shrine
   * Sumiyoshi Shrine
   * Walked around Canal City and Tenjin Underground
   * Had Hakata ramen for dinner at a yatai stand
* **Hotel:** APA Hotel Hakata Gion Ekimae
   * Very convenient location. Paid out of pocket. The room was much larger than the APA hotel I stayed at in Tokyo. 

**Day 11: Kamishikimi Kumanoimasu Shrine, Amano Iwato Shrine & Takachiho Gorge**

* OK so this was the part of my trip that I had the hardest time planning. These locations are technically in Kumamoto Prefecture and are pretty much inaccessible unless you have a car. There is a bus that goes to Takachiho, but the other 2 places can only be accessed by private vehicle. 
* I ended up [booking a tour](https://www.klook.com/en-US/activity/120931-kamishikimi-kumanoza-shrine-amanoiwato-shrine-tour-from-fukuoka/) through Klook: 
   * The bus picked us up at the Lawson outside Hakata Stn. and I thought it was a pretty good tour overall. 
   * The guide was super knowledgeable about the local specialties in each area we went to Ex. which souvenirs to buy, and which shops have lower prices. He also gave the tour in both English and Chinese, and also spoke perfect Japanese. 
   * The tour felt a little bit rushed at the first two stops (Kamishikimi and Amanoiwato) but looking back, I think the time allotted was enough. 
* **Attractions:**
   * Kamishikimi Kumanoimasu Shrine - the Demon Slayer Shrine! 
      * Really cool to look at but there's not much else in the area. We climbed up to the top of the mountain; there are lots of stairs. 
      * Inspired *Hotarubi no Mori e*
   * Amano Iwato Shrine - cave where goddess Amaterasu hid herself
      * I felt like we could have spent more time here: there's a main shrine, followed by a short hike, then a bunch of cafes, another short hike, and then the cave. There was a LOT to explore. 
      * The cave was really cool and the mango-rich milk ice cream at a cafe was really good. The guide also recommended eating ""jitori"" (happy fried chicken) and the local onigiri. 
      * The guide said we should buy *umeshu* (plum wine) from the shops as it was cheaper than buying it in Takachiho. Apparently Kumamoto makes the number one umeshu in all of Japan!
   * Takachiho Gorge - highlight of the tour!
      * The gorge is absolutely beautiful! I planned ahead and [reserved a boat](https://eipro.jp/takachiho1/terms/view/toppage) in advance. I was determined to get a boating slot and pretty much refreshed the website every day around 4 weeks in advance. I was the only one in the tour group to have a boat reservation and I think the view from the water up at the gorge was phenomenal - definitely recommend!
   * The guide also provided commentary on Mount Aso when we passed by it
   * Had dinner back at Hakata Station after we got back 

**Day 12: Nanzoin Temple & Fukuoka City**

* **Attractions:**
   * Nanzoin - it was under construction when I went so unfortunately, there were boards up blocking most of the laying Buddha's body. You can only get up close to and touch the feet. You might've seen instagram reels of people going up to the head but it was completely cut off when I went. 
      * NOTE: there's a dresscode at the temple. All men and women must wear bottoms that end past their knees or else they're not allowed to enter. I just skirted pass the dress code but I did see the temple employees give others shawls to cover their lower bodies. Some tourists in tank tops (both men and women) were also told to cover up their shoulders with shawls. 
   * Went back to Fukuoka and had lunch at Ichiran Ramen's Main Branch
   * Daimyo District
      * Alice on Wednesdays - super cool fashion/accessory/souvenir store based on the story
   * Had a nice walk in Fukuoka to the Fukuoka Castle Ruins, Ohori Park, and Maizuru Park. 
   * Did a bit of shopping back at Hakata Station at Amu Plaza and had dinner there

**Day 13: Dazaifu**

* **Attractions:**
   * Dazaifu Tenmangu - So the main shrine was also under construction lol but they erected a temporary shrine that had a greenhouse roof. That was pretty cool 
   * Mozenmachi & Tenjinsama-dori - street of souvenirs, a cool Starbucks, and Ghibli store
   * Walked to Kamado Shrine (30 min walk) - LOTS of Demon Slayer fans left drawings on the votive tablets there
   * I had a lot of time left and decided to go to Yanagawa
      * This was a bit of a let-down tbh: I got there at around 2pm but the canal tours were already closing. I checked on Google but the locals there said that it's not entirely accurate
      * I had lunch at Ganso Motoyoshiya which was great for unagi
   * Headed back to Hakata Station and went to the Demon Slayer exhibit they had there

  
**Day 14: Itoshima**

* I might've been a bit too ambitious with my plans today but it was very worth it. I wanted to bike through Itoshima and hit all the highlights. I managed to do it but it was very hot and tiring.
* **Attractions:** 
   * Station to Totoro no Mori = 11km
   * Totoro no Mori to London Bus Cafe = 6.4km
   * London Bus Cafe to Sakurai Shrine = 4.4km 
   * Sakurai Shrine to Sakurai Futamigaura Torii = 2.7km
   * Back to station = 11km 
   * Total = 35.5km 
* I was so dead after but this was SO WORTH IT. The beach was so beautiful, I literally gasped when I first saw it. There's really nothing that beats the sight of the torii gates in the water. 

  
**Day 15: Kumamoto City** 

* Started using the Kyushu Rail Pass. Dropped off my luggage at the hotel before heading out
* **Attractions:** 
   * Kumamoto Castle
   * Kato Shrine
   * Sakura no baba Josaien
   * Wakuwakuza Kumamoto Castle Museum 
   * Suizenji Jojuen Garden/Park - this was the highlight in my opinion; the garden was really pretty and the koi fish there are...very aggressive lol. They really want food. 
   * Kumamoto ramen! - I had dinner at Akagumi Ramen and really loved how garlicky Kumamoto-style ramen is. 
* **Hotel:** Nest Hotel Kumamoto
   * Included breakfast; paid for with Bilt Points; 15 minutes away from Kumamoto Station on the tram. 
* **Luggage Forwarding:** I was going to Aso the next day and really didn't want to lug my stuff with me, so I forwarded my stuff to Kagoshima. Luggage forwarding was very simple: I just went to the front desk and they helped me fill out the form. Cost me about $17 USD. 

  
**Day 16: Mount Aso**

* I took the Aso Boy Train (covered by Rail Pass) from Kumamoto Station to Aso Station. It was a good thing I forwarded my luggage because people were FIGHTING for seats on the train. There were no seat reservations and it was very crowded. 
* Once at Aso Stn, everyone RAN to get on a bus to Asosanjo Terminal. Unfortunately, I couldn't get a seat and was panicking a bit since the next bus came 2 hours later. Luckily, I split a cab with a couple I met and the cab got us to the Terminal in half an hour (the bus took longer). Cost me 1500 yen after splitting with the couple. 
   * You can ask the staff at Aso Station to call a cab for you!
   * Also pay attention to when the last bus is back to Aso Station. 
* **Attractions:** 
   * Aso Sanjo Terminal Cafe - great ice cream and can also get souvenirs here
   * Nakadake Crater
      * there's a bus from Aso Sanjo to the crater but I recommend walking - the views are amazing and it's only around 30 minutes
   * Kusasenri - I walked here as well; you go back the way you came from and past Aso Sanjo. Since this is going downhill, the trek was much easier
      * Horse riding - very fun
      * Walking around Kusasenri - the horse riding ended at around 4pm and the horses were set free to roam around the plains. It was great to walk around the fields and watch the horses drink, roll around, and just be free. 
   * Shops - some things that the tour guide (from Takachiho) said are must-dos in Aso: 
      * Drink Aso milk - I tried both the milk and the yoghurt drink and both are amazing
      * Horse meat - there's a guy near the shops who has a small barbecue stand. He sells skewers that look like average ones you'd get at any barbecue but it's horse meat, which is the local specialty in Kumamoto. It was tasty but I definitely had weird feelings about it lol
      * Buy horse oil - locals use it to scrub their feet; apparently you can't get this oil anywhere else in Japan (or if you get it, it's more cosmetic than medicinal)
      * Eat Akaushi - the red cows are super expensive (I think it was 5 million yen each?) and you can get different dishes. I had dinner planned at the hotel so I had an akaushi burger from one of the stands. It was very good. 
* **Hotel:** Hotel Aso no Tsukasa
   * Breakfast and onsen were included; paid out of pocket for dinner
   * Paid with Bilt Points
   * The hotel also had a large gift shop and an outdoor footbath, which was really nice. 

**Day 17: Kagoshima/Sakurajima**

* The Aso Boy train only runs twice a day in one direction, and there wasn't one going back to Kumamoto Station in the morning. Travel to Kagoshima took longer and I got in at around 2pm. My luggage got there before me.
* The original plan was to explore Kagoshima city this day, and then spend the next full day at Sakurajima. However, the forecast said it was going to rain and staff at the ferry port said that it was unlikely I'd be able to see much if I went on a rainy day. So I bit the bullet and went to Sakurajima in the afternoon despite the fact that everything (including transportation) closes at around 5pm. I ditched my plans to rent a bike since it didn't seem worth it for 2 hours. 
* **Attractions:**
   * Ferry to Sakurajima - comes every 15 minutes
   * Yogan Nagisa Park Footbath - was amazing to watch the sunset while enjoying the footbath. Also met a clingy cat here. 
   * Yunohira Observatory - amazing view of Sakurajima volcano
      * Takeaway: I got the day pass to get on and off the tour bus. The bus is really the only way to get to Yunohira observatory (it would be an EXTREMELY uphill bike) and it doesn't go to places like Kurokami Buried Torii. 
   * Magnum Onsen - near Yogan Nagisa Park and you can watch the sunset over the water while bathing
* Ate dinner at Yushokutonsai Ichiniisan Tenmonkanten
* Checked out Tenmonkan-dori and made a reservation at Kuroya (Kagoshima-style shabu-shabu) for the next day
* **Hotel:** Kagoshima Plaza Hotel Tenmonkan
   * Paid with Bilt Points; no breakfast included

**Day 18: Kagoshima City**

* Very much a food day lol. It was very rainy and in retrospect, I would've done more indoor activities like going to the aquarium. 
* Forwarded my luggage to Beppu hotel
* **Attractions:**
   * Brunch at Tontoro Ramne
   * Ate Shirokuma (Kagoshima shaved ice dessert) at Tanmonkan Mujaki
   * Dolphins near aquarium (Kagoshima Dolphin Port?)
      * not intentional, I was on my way to Sengan-en when I saw people standing around the bay. There's a dolphin show twice a day, which was very cool. The dolphins could swim in and out of the pool to the waterway. There were no trainers present
   * Walked to Sengan-en - this was a mistake lol. First, I love walking and try to walk as much as possible. This was an hour's walk, which usually would be alright, but it was raining cats and dogs. Not my smartest moment
      * Because of the rain, Sengan-en wasn't that enjoyable and I couldn't see much. 
   * Had dinner at Kuroya
      * Chose this place since it had all the Kagoshima foods that are recommended: kurobuta shabu-shabu, Satsuma-imo, and Satsuma-shochu. 

  
**Day 19: Yufuin/Beppu**

* Yufuin was a spontaneous decision: I realized that the train there was covered by the rail pass and through why not. 
* It was still very rainy but Yufuin was quite pretty in the rain. 
* **Attractions in Yufuin:**
   * Walked down Yutsunobo Street
      * Food highlights: Telato (matcha gelato), Milch (cheese cake)
      * Went to Ghibli store & bought really nice souvenirs
      * Looked at the cat and dog shop
   * Yufuin Floral Village - it was pretty but a bit overrated in my opinion
* I took a bus from Yufuin to Beppu (again, super thankful I forwarded my luggage!). The bus was super crowded since everyone was trying to fit themselves and their luggage on. 
* **Attractions in Beppu:**
   * Takegawara Onsen - I did the sand bath which was very fun! The staff will take a photo for you if you'd like. The regular onsen was also VERY hot which personally, I was a big fan of. The manager was a really friendly guy and really tried to get to know his foreign guests. I got to speak a lot of Japanese with him
* **Hotel:** Nishitetsu Resort Inn, Beppu
   * Breakfast included, paid for with Bilt points
   * I was choosing between this and Daiichi Hotel (both covered by Bilt) and went with this one since there were more reviews and the onsen looked great. However, it was a bit far from Beppu Station, much longer than the advertised 10 minute walk, in the rain and with luggage. Daiichi on the other hand was right next to the station. 
   * The onsen was super nice though! There was an indoor and outdoor pool.

  
**Day 20: Beppu**

* **Attractions:** 
   * Hells of Beppu Tour
      * I got up early and did all the 7 hells. Highly recommend doing this tour, it was really fun, there are lots of footbaths, and each hell had fun attractions
      * Did the Kannawa District Hells in the morning before lunch
   * Lunch at Jigokumushikobo Kannawa
      * I read online that there is a wait for this restaurant so I got there early, around 11:30 and only waited 5 minutes. As long as you avoid the lunch rush, it should be a short wait. I cooked my own food here, which was cool. 
   * After lunch, I took the bus to the Shibaseki District Hells
* Had dinner at Toyotsune (toriiten) 
* Relaxed at onsen at hotel

**Day 21: Return to Tokyo**

* Flew back to Tokyo from Oita Airport
* **Hotel:** Tokyo Business Hotel
   * a 15 minute walk from Shinjuku Station, paid out of pocket, breakfast included
   * Actually was very impressed by this hotel: the rooms were large and spacious and there was even an onsen! 
* Did some shopping at Lumine Shinjuku
* Ate dinner at Ikkakuya (VERY good ramen)

**Day 22: Asakusa - hang out with friends**

**Day 23: Shibuya & Harajuku**

* This was a last-minute shopping/walk down memory lane day. I went directly from my hotel to Harajuku, then walked to Shibuya
* **Harajuku Attractions:** 
   * Breakfast at Island Vintage Coffee Omotesando - really yummy acai bowl
   * Kiddland Harajuku - fun character goods store
   * Tokyu Plaza Omotesando - I didn't buy anything, just wanted to ride the elevator lol
   * Laforet Harajuku
* **Shibuya Attractions:** 
   * Shibuya 109 - fashion shopping, very girly stores
   * Shibuya Hikarie - shopping
   * Lunch at Maguro to Shari - real hole in the wall donburi place
   * Shibuya Scramble Square - shopping
   * Shibuya LOFT - souvenirs
   * MEGA Donqujote - needed a new suitcase
   * Ate dinner at Ikkakuya again (back in Shinjuku)

I went for the first time last week after having walked by a hundred times. The ambiance is awesome. It attracts a slightly classier group of customers than Starbucks, and makes for an awesome ""shared"" work space. There's tables with outlets, and also more lounge/relaxed seating. Honestly it was a great place to get work done. The place is incredibly minimalistic and clean.

There were only two Baristas the times I went, and a few Capital One associates (Not sure their jobs, but they're there to answer any questions regarding Capital One). The Coffee's are pretty decent, but the Matcha is oddly amazing and addictive. The drinks are 50% off with a Capital One card (unfortunately food is still full price).

Capital One Cafe would honestly be a lot better if it wasn't in a mall as I have to park far away (and pay for parking after 90 or 120 mins), but then again it's in a busy place for the convenience to people in the mall.

Overall I do plan on going to the Cafe regularly to get work done, and the 50% discount on drinks (the fire Matcha) makes my SavorOne well worth it. Not only do I get 3% Cashback, but I save a whole $3.14 on my Matcha. I wish AMEX and other credit card companies had cafe's or lounges like this outside of their New York's Centurion Lounge. It's overall a great experience and I can see myself frequenting cardholder lounges/restaurants regularly. 

I'm probably missing a lot of information that I should be including, so if anyone has questions, please ask away and I'll add them.",32,1728936732.0,CreditCards,24,0.94,False
