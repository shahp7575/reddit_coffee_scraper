1n9fmil,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1n9fmil/sibo_and_toxic_bile_part_2/,SIBO and Toxic Bile: Part 2,"For anyone interested, [here is the link](https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1i1bgr2/sibo_and_toxic_bile/) to my previous post, in which I explain how SIBO is caused by toxic bile. To summarize it, the liver/gallbladder eliminate toxins via bile, which becomes progressively more sludgy/viscous as toxins build up in it, leading to a vicious cycle of SIBO, endotoxin release and poor motility. The only way to resolve this is to promote bile flow with agents like vitamin C, coffee, etc., which may be a long process for those who have had SIBO a long time and have very toxic bile. The die off process can be very difficult and even dangerous, especially when breaking up biofilms, so it is advisable to go slow and not take too many things at once. 

Some people may object to this as too simplistic and claim that there can be more than cause of SIBO, but this needs to be explained. I believe that poor bile flow is the primary cause of SIBO, but there could be multiple causes of poor bile flow. If someone thinks that nerve damage causes SIBO, they should specify whether it does so by leading to impaired bile flow, by causing some other problem(s), or by a combination of those two. Unless these other possible factors can be elucidated, I am going to operate under the assumption that SIBO is caused by dysfunction of the gut-liver-gallbladder axis, the measure of which is bile flow. 

One explanation I have seen offered here is that of low stomach acid. This does not make sense because bile is alkaline and is needed to neutralize stomach acid in the small intestine, allowing for proper nutrient absorption. It is probably impaired bile flow and the failure to neutralize stomach acid that leads to gastric reflux and other SIBO symptoms. When I was at my worst, I was routinely spitting up yellow-green fluids that could only have been bile, as it really wasn't responsive to the PPIs my GI prescribed. So when the bile becomes very toxic and viscous, you will get bile reflux and gastric reflux. Perhaps the PPIs help with neutralizing the stomach acid and preventing damage to the GI tract, but they will not cure the problem if it is caused by toxic bile. 

This also explains why SIBO sufferers can be sensitive to acidic substances. Coffee and vitamin C promote bile flow and detoxification, but the additional acid paired with the excess acid in the gut already (caused by poor bile flow) causes a short term worsening of reflux and other symptoms. The ability to tolerate acidic foods/substances is a measure of how healthy the gut is and will improve as we heal from SIBO. Perhaps we also have MCAS and histamine intolerance that are exacerbated by dysbiosis and nutrient deficiencies, but  probably also by acid reflux. So while people can debate about other possible causes of SIBO, it seems pretty clear that low stomach acid is not a possible cause, as it's actually poor bile flow and too much stomach acid that is the problem.

1n9fkm5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1n9fkm5/la_fortuna_perfection_thanks_to_arenal_rides/,La Fortuna Perfection thanks to Arenal Rides,"Forgive me for the length, but this one is worth the read. Full transparency, I am not the type to leave written or public reviews. In fact, I can count on one hand how many times I have. Even on this rare occasion, I’m trying to think of the most impactful words to use to explain just how amazing **Arenal Rides** was and how important they were, in particular **Carlos**, to making our entire trip perfect. But below is my best effort. Happy reading and I hope this helps you as much as prior reviews helped us.

Quick backdrop… wife and I previously went to Costa Rica in 2017 but mostly stayed at the resort – **Nayara Springs**. Fast forward eight years and there’s a very special birthday we wanted to celebrate this year in a big way with a surprise trip back to Costa Rica, but this time the trip included our two young children and our extended family. Never had a question on where to stay – it’s always Nayara (absolutely amazing properties and service but will refer you to their other reviews that already say the same). The logistics for this trip were quite challenging given the size of our group, the reason for the trip, and wanting to get out more and adventure a bit. Enter Arenal Rides and one of the most amazing persons I’ve ever met – Carlos.

My brother-in-law found Arenal Rides on Reddit while looking to secure transportation between SJO and La Fortuna. Had great reviews and was very affordable. Little did we know how things would blossom from there. Right from the start, Carlos was very responsive and volunteered to help with anything else we needed. Well… we needed a lot more. One thing led to another and we were surprised to find out that Arenal Rides is so much more than just a transportation company. They offer every excursion imaginable in the Arenal area and at prices no one else can beat. And the best part is Carlos offers the most convenient way to book activities in one effort without having to visit multiple websites and talk to a lot of different people – the **Weshke** app (on iOS and Android). Think of any large well-known tour app but make it specific just to the area you’re traveling to and layer on top the most competitive rates, transportation, and the ability to filter and refine your search by all key parameters and you get a much better, personalized version in the Weshke app. But the biggest benefit to using the Weshke app is who you have standing behind it. Carlos was always available any minute of the day to help with any question, concern, or issue. One quick example includes the only time during the trip we thought we could handle our own seemingly small need to get a ride for 8 people to Prayecto Asis from our hotel. We thought no problem, we’ll just take Uber, which does technically exist according to Uber, but is not permitted (always use the local taxis – they’re awesome and very safe). It was a small miracle our 2 separate Ubers even got to our destination on the first leg, but we sure as hell were not going to try to get back with them. However, we’re 45 minutes away, as are the taxis. So guess who I reach out to… and guess who sends a large van for our entire group with zero notice and without hesitation… yup, Carlos. It was a self-inflicted S.O.S. situation but we had a line to the bat-phone to get us out of that mess. That’s what you get when you use the Weshke app. You won’t get that level of service, responsiveness, or care with the bigger tour apps.

But it didn’t just stop with helping to secure our transportation, excursions, dinner reservations, and even being there to help support us when needed. Carlos learned of why we were going and stepped way up to help more than I have ever experienced before. I asked Carlos for some advice on whether there were any local bakeries in town he would recommend that could make a custom birthday cake. Most people would have just given some names and bowed out, but not Carlos. He said ‘*don’t worry, I’ll take care of it*’, and that he did. I sent a few pictures of example designs and never had to lift a finger again. On the night of the special birthday dinner, Carlos personally picked up the cake from the bakery in town and delivered it to our hotel. But even that wasn’t everything. Understanding how important this birthday celebration was for us, Carlos was so thoughtful that he stopped to ensure we had a classy candle to match and picked up a custom bouquet of roses for me to give to my wife.

Carlos felt like our personal concierge right from the very start and always looked out for us until the end. This special celebratory trip turned out to be far more special than I could have ever imagined. It was the only time I can look at a trip and say it was perfect in every way. While we certainly showed our appreciation for Carlos at the end of the trip, he never once asked for it. Some people, particularly in the US or Canada, may search up Arenal Rides and just see a transportation company that can help them get from the airport to their destination. But Arenal Rides is so much more than that, and so much more than just what their website may show. Arenal Rides is a small group of individuals led by Carlos that truly care about their fellow brothers and sisters regardless of where they’re from or any of the differences that we as a society seem so fixated on fighting over these days. Maybe it’s also because of the absence of this basic, fundamental care for each other in our world today, but I was completely blown away and overwhelmed with gratitude and appreciation.

I wish our world had more Carlos’s and Arenal Rides and maybe one day it will again. But for now, one thing I can promise you is if you’re going to Costa Rica, and you want your trip to be perfect, there is only one thing you need to do – reach out to Carlos at Arenal Rides. It might begin with a quote for transportation from the airport, but it will grow into so much more if you want it to. For me, our experience grew into a special friendship I will carry with me for the rest of my life. And a deep founded appreciation and admiration for all of the amazing people that make up Costa Rica. Pura Vida. Not just a phrase, but truly a different way of living.

 

P.S. – big shoutout to **David (part of Arenal Rides)** who gave our entire group one of the best tours we’ve ever had. Incredibly knowledgeable but also very attentive, personable, and empathetic to everyone on the tour. And to all of our Arenal Rides drivers - thank you! Also huge shoutout to **Caesar at Northfields Coffee and Chocolate** who was so kind, intelligent, and patient with our group (including one of our kids accidentally breaking a coffee cup). But most of all, cannot say enough amazing things about the entire crew at **Maquique Adventures, especially Kenneth and William.** The canyoning adventure with zip lining, hiking, and rappelling, is offered by multiple vendors in the Arenal area but trust me, you want to use Maquique. After our 7 year old fell down during the hike and hit her knee, it was Kenneth and William that stayed with her and made sure she was happy and comfortable the rest of the way.",1,1757102862.0,CostaRicaTravel,0,1.0,False

stroke rehab, 90 year old tiny lady (35kg) acutely confused, she is at least a week post-stroke at this point

Na 121 on bloods (135 previously), she just looks dry as bones, white coated tongue, paper thin skin. Checked her fluid balance and she had about 900mL and 1200mL the day before (half of her fluid intake being tea, coffee and nutritional shakes, has about 500mL water a day at most) 

I treat as hypovolemic hyponatremia with IV fluids (she had a little over 500mL before yanking out the cannula), Na improves to 127 on repeat bloods the next morning. 

Serum and urine osmolalities come back that morning and her serum osmolality is on the lower end at 268, her urine osmolality is high at 204 and her urine Na is 44. My co-resident thinks she is actually euvolemic because she calculates her daily maintenance as 1Lt since she is 35kg and convinced this is SIADH(checks out with stroke and urine osmolalities). She stops IV fluids, Na next morning drops to 124. 

-why would Na improve with fluid challenge if it is SIADH? 
-i get that a tiny frail lady won’t need 3Lt of fluids a day but 1Lt. seems excessively low, am i missing something? maybe its adjusted for frailty but still

Hi everyone, I need some advice/guidance on what to do/ possibly take legal action against my workplace. I’ve been at this job for over 2 years now. It’s a mom and pop coffee shop (they’re about to open a second location, which in my opinion is a disaster move) 

My problem is that for some time now they’ve been neglecting giving our biweekly paychecks on time. They always sign the checks at whatever time (sometimes days) they feel like, for example we get paid Friday but checks wont be signed and ready until Saturday. I have bills/rent to pay and would like to get paid as soon I can. Unfortunately since it’s only a team of 6, there’s no direct deposit. I’ve grown tired of waiting all day on pay day to get my check. I have places to be and errands to run and can’t do that because of them and their negligence to pay their workers on time. They’ve been confronted before by previous workers about this and even threatened to sue, only then (by then I mean one time) did they have the checks ready to go morning of pay day and those workers don’t work for them anymore. How do I go by reporting this? What are my rights here? 

This is only one problem of many this place has 

I would like to mention that this is my only current form of income however I am on the hunt for a new/second job that’s more stable but the job market is shit

I’ve been struggling with complex gastrointestinal issues for over 2 years now, and I’m trying to put together a multi-phase self-regeneration plan. I’d love to hear if anyone has had similar experiences and what worked for them. Its worth mentioning ive developed this after covid and it increasingly got worse over time.
Here’s a detailed overview:

Symptoms:
• Persistent abdominal discomfort and bloating, especially above the navel
• Chronic stomach pain right after eating; worsened by food volume and certain foods
• Difficulty breathing due to abdominal tightness, sometimes feels like diaphragm is “stuck”
• Positional discomfort: lying on right side increases pain; sitting sometimes moderately uncomfortable; lying on back slightly relieves symptoms
• Occasional globus sensation in the throat and “bubble” noises when swallowing
• Rare regurgitation; reflux not constant
• Pain shifts with body movements and activities; some post-exercise flare-ups
• Increased sensitivity to stress, hot weather, and seasonal changes
• 
Previous investigations:
• Multiple gastroscopies: chronic gastritis (antrum), leaky cardia in the past. During most recent endoscopy  my gi doc said that mh lower esophaheal sphincter is perfect however there is very light chronic inactive inflammation in my stomach and duodenum also inactive.
• Colonoscopy was normal
• Normal abdominal ultrasounds, colonoscopy, and two back MRIs
• SIBO/IMO negative, H. pylori negative
• Parasites and Giardia negative, stool tested about 10 times
• Intestinal inflammation markers normal - calprotectin
• DAO levels tested for histamine intolerance
• Tested for mals with ct angio, negative
• CT scan clear
• Thyroid markers normal


Current observations:
• High sensitivity to food volume, fat, and some proteins
• Some improvement with chewing thoroughly, breaking meals into smaller portions (5–7/day), and mashing food
• Certain sweets tolerated better than “healthy” options like cooked vegetables or low-FODMAP meals
• Some relief from diaphragm tension with breathing exercises and massages, but effect is temporary
• Bloating and GI discomfort can flare from even small “trigger” foods
• 
Current self-regeneration approach:
• Medications / supplements: Iberogast (3x/day), Esoxx One, Avilin Gastro, DGL
• Throat care: saltwater gargle (2x/day), herbal teas (chamomile, linden, fennel)
• Lifestyle: 
• Breathing exercises 2–3x/day
• Abdominal massage 2x/day
• Cold showers in the morning
• Singing/exercises for vagus nerve stimulation
• Warm, relaxing baths 2–3x/week
• Light cycling (~20–25 km/day)
• Careful tracking of foods and symptoms
• 
Dietary notes:
• Cannot tolerate raw vegetables, oats, apples, broccoli, honey, or very fatty meals
• Certain sweets (djems, chocolate) tolerated better than “healthy” meals
• Struggle with dairy, coffee (even decaf and lactose-free), and rich sauces
• Fat digestion seems to worsen symptoms; unclear how to balance
• 
Questions for the community:
• Has anyone had similar chronic abdominal/discomfort and diaphragm tightness for years? What approaches helped?
• Are there supplements, techniques, or medications that specifically help fat digestion in sensitive GI systems?
• Does anyone have experience with elemental diets or extreme low-residue approaches for symptom control?
• Any advice on navigating meals safely while still keeping calories up?
• Are there techniques to improve vagus nerve function or diaphragm relaxation long-term?
Thanks in advance for any insights, experiences, or tips. I’m trying to piece together a multi-phase approach, and I’m open to any practical suggestions.

I'm aware of the more personal approaches (the speed dating stuff, two birds fit, etc.) and plan to start dipping my toes in soon. I visit coffee shops, dog parks, bookstores, etc. - I try to put myself out there. This post is specifically about OLD. 

EVERY time I travel to another city, I always change the apps just to see what happens. I usually come home with exponentially more matches spending anywhere from 2-6 days in other cities. Like 3 days in another city more women match with me than in a year here-seriously.

1n9fab4,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1n9fab4/my_cold_exhusband_broke_his_rules_need_link_please/,My Cold Ex-Husband Broke His Rules (need link please),"Aurora Caldwell thought her loveless marriage to Damian was at least bound by duty. But when a trending scandal exposes her husband as the mysterious benefactor behind a rising starlet, her world shatters. The daming photos—his arm around another woman, his wedding band gleaming like a cruel reminder—leave no room for denial. And when anonymous emails reveal even darker truths, Aurora realizes her marriage wasn’t just a lie. It was a betrayal staged in plain sight.

Chapter 1
Three years into my marriage to Damian Caldwell, our once-a-week family gathering remained the only time we ever saw each other.
And today, even that ended abruptly-he rushed out halfway through.
Not long after, my phone rang. It was my best friend, Lydia Radcliffe, her voice urgent. ""Aurora, check the trending list! Eleanor's sugar daddy just got exposed. Tell me I'm crazy-doesn't that look exactly like Damian?""
The moment I saw the trending topic, my heart throbbed with pain.
""The Mysterious Sugar Daddy Behind Eleanor Hartwell's Fame""
Though the photo only showed the blurred silhouette of a man's back, I confirmed it was Damian with one glance.
In the picture, he was walking into a hotel with Eleanor, his arm looped intimately around her slim waist. The wedding band gleamed on his finger like a cruel mockery, stabbing into my eyes.
Before I could even process it, two anonymous emails landed in my inbox.
I opened the first, and several high-definition photos came into my view.
In the first photo, Damian was down on one knee, cradling a cute girl in a puffy dress. Arms wrapped around his neck, she pecked his cheek, and he gave a doting smile.
In the second one, Eleanor was brushing dust off his shoulder. Instead of pulling away like he always did to me, he curved his lips into a soft, indulgent smile.
***
The dozens of photos made me realize-the reason for his increased indifference for the past three years wasn't his health regimen.
It was just that he had an affair.
My fists clenched so tight that my nails bit into my flesh. Taking a few deep breaths, I forced myself to calm down and opened the second email.
One single line stared back at me.
""Mrs. Caldwell, the choice is yours-either pay us 1.5 million dollars in hush money, or we go public.""
""I'll pay.""
I quickly replied and then used all the money in my bank account to buy out these photos that could ruin my husband and his mistress.
Ironically, the 1.5 million dollars was Damian's wedding gift for me.
Yet now, it was used to bury the proof of his infidelity.
I couldn't help staring at the little girl in the photo.
If my baby hadn't died, she would've been her age by now.
It was killing me to think that my baby was reduced to ashes in an urn before I could ever meet her.
I had drowned in agony after losing her. But Damian simply shrugged it off with a casual remark, ""We'll just have another one.""
But now, I knew we wouldn't.
After buying out the photos, I called Lydia. ""Do you know any lawyers? I want a divorce.""
Over my dead body would I stay with a man who betrayed me.
Lydia asked around and quickly called me back.
The lawyer drafted a divorce agreement. But since I didn't know exactly how many assets Damian had, the division of property couldn't be specified.
""It's fine. Send me the agreement first. I'll negotiate the terms with Damian,"" I told her.
The photos cost me 1.5 million dollars, but it was nothing compared to the reputation of the Caldwell Group's CEO.
With the photos, I surely held a strong upper hand in the negotiations over the property settlement.
I printed out the agreement, put it on the coffee table, and called Damian.
The call connected almost instantly-only it wasn't his voice.
""How may I help, Ms. Whitmore? Dami is tucking Maureen in.""
Eleanor's gentle, sugary tone cut me like glass.
So, she knew about me.
I had assumed that Damian had lied to her about being single.
Turned out she knew he was married but stayed his mistress anyway!
Not bothering to waste energy on her, I said coldly, ""Put Damian on the phone.""
Chapter 2
""I'm sorry, Ms. Whitmore. Maureen won't let him leave her sight, so he's not available right now. Whatever it is, you can tell me. I'll pass it along.""
She still sounded so gentle.
Just then, Maureen's voice rang out. ""Daddy, can I still see you after I wake up tomorrow? You always disappear before I realize it.""
Damian coaxed her tenderly, ""Of course, you can. I promise I'll still be here tomorrow morning.""
My heart clenched with pain. I couldn't even remember the last time he had shown me such gentleness.
""Ms. Whitmore, do you need anything else? If not, we're going to rest now.""
Eleanor's words dripped with feigned politeness-but every syllable was a dagger.
""Yes, I do,"" I said. ""Tell Damian to come back and sign the divorce agreement!""
Eleanor fell silent, either out of disbelief or excitement.
I guessed it was excitement, though. After all, with me out of the picture, she could finally become Damian's wife.
I hung up and sat by the coffee table, waiting for Damian to come back.
A night had passed, yet he was still nowhere to be seen. Early in the morning, his assistant, Patricia Sutton, knocked on the door.
The moment Patricia entered the door, I sensed her hostility.
She had been his assistant for three years, and I could tell he was more than a boss to her.
Noticing the fatigue on my face, she said with a complacent grin, ""Mr. Caldwell's kept you for nearly four years, and now, he's marrying Ms. Hartwell. It must be killing you, huh?""
Kept me?
I couldn't help but sneer inwardly.
Yes, what I had with Damian was a secret marriage.
Four years ago, the Caldwell family elders all strongly opposed our marriage due to my humble background.
Eventually, I caved and accepted that there'd be no wedding.
Other than our closest ones, no one knew we were a married couple.
Back then, Damian stroked my hair and apologized for the unfair treatment I'd endured. With distress in his eyes, he swore he'd throw me a grand wedding once he secured the inheritance of the Caldwell Group.
It had been so long since he secured the inheritance, yet he had never mentioned anything about the wedding.
So, till now, Patricia still thought I was his kept woman.
She said, looking all high and mighty, ""Mr. Caldwell asked me to find out who posted those photos online. And you know what? Everything tracked back to Polaris Media. You're the editor-in-chief of the Entertainment Department. Don't tell me you know nothing about it.""
Could Damian be any more shameless?
He cheated on me. Instead of explaining to me, he put the blame on me?
I said expressionlessly, ""It wasn't me.""
Patricia snorted, ""Save it. The proof is right in your face. I suggest you own up to it and leave Mr. Caldwell before he dumps you. Imagine how humiliating that would be.""
Just then, I stood up and slapped her in the face.
Stunned, she covered her cheek and looked at me in great disbelief.
I tossed the divorce papers in front of her and turned around. ""You don't get a say in things between Damian and me. Get out!""
She gaped at the divorce papers.
""You're married to Mr. Caldwell?""
Then she realized Damian was with Eleanor. Gritting her teeth, she smiled coldly with hatred, ""Mr. Caldwell has put me in charge. If you keep denying you're the one who leaked the photos, go to the family chapel and stay there to think about what you've done. Don't come out until you're ready to admit your mistake. After all, Ms. Hartwell is still crying because of the scandal.""
Utterly pissed off, I let out a derisive laugh.
Damian cheated on me.
And I ended up being the one who made a mistake?
Chapter 3
She continued, ""Or feel free not to go. Just a friendly reminder-the cardiopulmonary support system keeping your vegetative mom alive is developed by the Caldwell Group. It won't be released for another month. Before that, Mr. Caldwell can have his man pull the plug at any moment. Your mom will be left to die.""
Damian was even more ruthless than I had imagined.
He knew so well that my mom was the only blood family I had left in this world.
Eventually, I compromised and entered the family chapel.
The faint scent of cedarwood filled the air, just as inescapable as Damian's presence.
At this precise moment, I was much more clear-headed than ever-I wanted a divorce.
The maid, Shelly Mitchel, was utterly anxious. She begged Patricia, ""Ms. Sutton, please, could you let Mrs. Caldwell out? The chapel is so cold. She'll freeze!""
My baby passed away three years ago. After offering me a few lukewarm words of comfort, Damian flew around the world, claiming it was for work.
What he never knew was that I spent countless nights in the chapel, praying to see my child just one more time.
Instead of resting and recovering, I devoted my days and nights to prayer, barely eating a thing. It was then that my health began to fail, and I grew weak and frail.
To make matters worse, it was the rainy season. The relentless dampness seeped into my bones, and it wasn't long before I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis.
Even the doctors were perplexed. How did someone so young develop such a disease?
They told me it was irreversible. On rainy days, I could only rely on medication to get through the pain.
Even Shelly knew about this, yet Damian had no idea.
Patricia coldly turned around, ignoring Shelly's plea. Biting her lip, Shelly said to me, ""I'll call Mr. Caldwell now!""
Enduring the searing pain in my knees, I said through gritted teeth, ""No. Don't call him, Shelly.""
I didn't tell him before because I didn't want to upset him.
But now? I simply didn't feel the need.
Because he wouldn't feel sad for me at all.
Shelly stubbornly called him anyway.
As the call came through, a little girl's childish voice rang out. ""Who is it? Daddy is accompanying Mommy to buy clothes.""
I let out a self-mocking laugh.
It had been ages since Damian changed his phone passcode. He'd never let me so much as touch it.
I used to think he hated anyone violating his privacy.
It never occurred to me that he simply didn't want me near it. His mistress and their daughter, on the other hand, could have it whenever they pleased.
Hearing the girl's words, Shelly was dumbfounded. She quickly checked the number again and confirmed it was Damian's.
Upon seeing the look on my face, she instantly knew what was going on and hung up.
I curved my lips into a smile, yet my eyes were devoid of any emotion.
Soon, my strength gave way entirely. My legs buckled and I collapsed, my knees hitting the floor with a thud. Seeing blood oozing from my knees, Patricia smiled coldly and turned to leave.
Just before closing the door, she clapped her hands mockingly. ""Good job admitting your mistake. As your reward, I won't report this to Mr. Caldwell.""
As soon as she was gone, Shelly rushed to my side and helped me back to my room.
Every step I took sent a sharp, stabbing pain through my feet, as if I were walking on knives.
Shelly said indignantly in a sobbing voice, ""How could Mr. Caldwell do this to you, forcing you to stay in the chapel for hours while buying clothes with his mistress? And the little girl...""
Finding it too shameful to continue, she fell silent and just looked at me worriedly.
Chapter 4
I forced a weak smile. ""Shelly, could you fetch the first aid kit for me?""
Soon, familiar footsteps rang out outside the door.
Damian was back.
His conversation with Shelly reached my ears.
""What's with the first aid kit?"" he asked.
""Mrs. Caldwell was in the chapel all night. She fell to the floor, and her knees are bleeding.""
""Is she that fragile?""
Obviously, Damian was suspicious that Shelly and I joined hands to win his sympathy.
Bracing herself, Shelly said, ""Ms. Sutton picked on Mrs. Caldwell. She wouldn't let Mrs. Caldwell sit or rest.""
Damian's tone turned cold. ""Who gave her permission to do that?""
Shelly braced herself and asked back, ""Wasn't it you?""
What followed was a moment of silence. Then Damian said in a cold tone, leaving no room for refusal, ""Patricia, go to Finance tomorrow to get your final check. You're fired.""
After hanging up, he walked into my room with the first aid kit.
He sat by the bed, keeping a straight face.
Then he held my ankles and rested my calves on his thigh.
""This is gonna hurt. Bear with it.""
His gaze darkened as he stared at the dried blood on my knees. Then he took out a few iodine swabs and gently disinfected my wounds.
Those photos had shattered every last bit of hope I held for him. Otherwise, that focused expression of his would have once made me believe I was staring at the Damian from the past-the one who had loved me so deeply.
But he was with Eleanor all night last night.
Over the past three years, maybe they had already spent countless nights together under the guise of his so-called business trips.
The mere thought made my stomach churn. I immediately pulled away my legs and sat away from him, disinfecting my wounds by myself.
A sharp pain shot through me, reminding me my time with Damian had come to an end.
Not looking into his eyes, I lowered my head and applied gauze to my knees while saying, ""Damian, let's get a divorce.""
It was a decision I made after a night of agonizing thought, one so painful it felt like I was cutting away a piece of myself. However, Damian didn't even arch his eyebrow after hearing this.
His cold, handsome face remained expressionless. ""A divorce? Could you bear to leave me?""
His reaction made sense. After all, I'd known him since the Whitmore family took me in when I was five. From that moment on, I became his shadow, following him everywhere he went.
He looked at me with disdain. ""I know you said this out of spite. But once is enough. Be careful what you wish for-what if I say yes the next time?""
Enduring the great bitterness in my heart, I asked him sarcastically, ""You already have a daughter with another woman. What makes you think I wouldn't leave you?""
Squinting, he studied me in a scrutinizing gaze. ""You knew?""
I pulled out a bitter smile, my voice nasal. ""Your daughter is, what, three years old or so, isn't she? In other words, Eleanor gave birth shortly after our baby passed away. Right?""
Damian's icy eyes flickered for a second. He didn't admit it, nor did he deny it.
The silence was almost oppressive.
After a long time, he frowned. ""Does Maureen's existence bother you that much?""
What a ridiculous question.
I smiled feebly, ""No, if her existence is just to satisfy your desire to be called 'Daddy'.""
Suddenly, he walked over to me, braced his hands on my sides, and trapped me in his arms.
I tried to push him away, but I was so weak that he barely moved.
He leaned even closer, his usually cold voice now strangely captivating. In a low, intimate whisper, he breathed into my ear, ""And yet, I love it more than anyone when you call me 'Daddy'.""
Chapter 5
I blushed at once.
Before his health regimen took over, our time in bed was just as passionate as any normal couple's.
Sometimes, things had gone so wild that he'd force me to call him ""Daddy"".
Now that I thought about it, I regretted it so much that I wished I could vanish into thin air.
My heated cheeks obviously satisfied Damian a lot. He smiled, ""It seems you haven't forgotten a bit.""
I bit my lip, overwhelmed by shame.
But as I looked at his familiar yet foreign face, a sense of release struck me.
I said exceptionally calmly and slowly, ""Damian, we can never go back. Whatever happened between us, our paths will never cross again.""
A strange look flickered across his handsome face.
He straightened up, no longer trapping me in his embrace. Rather, he looked down at me and said condescendingly, ""Stop playing hard to get. It won't work. Just stick to your role as Mrs. Caldwell.""
I could no longer hold back and was about to use the 1.5 million dollars as leverage to negotiate with him.
Presumably, that would be enough to let him know I was serious about divorcing him.
""Damian, sign the divorce papers, and we'll part ways amicably. Or I'll...""
His phone rang before I could continue.
He answered and said in a gentle tone, ""Yes, I'm at home. Alright.""
After hanging up, he said to me, ""Your parents are on their way.""
My words stuck in my throat.
To be more precise, they were my adoptive parents, but they'd always thought of me as their own daughter.
I decided to discuss divorce with Damian after they left.
Or things would be awkward when they came here.
Noticing my silence, Damian no longer said a word and went to the chapel.
I entered the kitchen to prepare lunch together with Shelly.
***
My adoptive parents, Helena Whitmore and Alexander Whitmore, arrived at noon.
""Dad, Mom, hello. Take a seat while I set the table.""
I forced a smile, pretending everything was fine.
Seeing that I was limping, Helena asked with concern, ""What happened to your legs?""
Not wanting them to notice anything wrong, I stuck out my tongue and said casually, ""I fell.""
Alexander shook his head. ""Aurora, you're not a little girl anymore. When can you learn to be more careful? Did you go to the hospital?""
""Yes. The doctor said there was nothing serious,"" I immediately said perfunctorily.
Looking around, Helena asked, ""Where's Damian?""
My face stiffened a little at the mention of his name. ""He's in the chapel. I'll go get him.""
But Alexander quickly stopped me and said a bit carefully, ""No. We'll wait.""
Detecting his humble tone, I couldn't help but feel bitter.
Though the Whitmore family and the Caldwell family went way back, Walter Whitmore, Alexander and Helena's son, wasn't cut out for business. His poor management led to the steady decline of the family's fortunes, resulting in their recent fall from the elite class of Calverton.
On the contrary, since Damian took over the Caldwell family business, the Caldwell Group had skyrocketed. He went on a merger spree, vastly expanding the family's business empire.
Over the years, without the Caldwell Group's support, the Whitmore Group would have been crushed by its opponents already.
This explained why Alexander and Helena now treaded so carefully-even obsequiously-around Damian.
Though they were his elders, they treated him with a deference that did not befit their status.
Perhaps it was because I upset him today. It had been almost two hours since my parents' arrival, and I had sent Shelly to urge him, but he was still in the chapel.
It made me wonder if he was deliberately keeping them waiting.
Sensing something, Helena said worriedly, ""Aurora, I saw the news yesterday about Eleanor's bankroller. The photo... It didn't show his face, but the silhouette looked like Damian to me. Was it ... him?""
Chapter 6
My heart skipped a beat, and my nose twitched. Tears welled up in my eyes.
Just then, Shelly rushed into the living room. ""Mr. Caldwell's here.""
Damian's arrival cut short Helena mid-sentence.
He was as refined and polite as ever, yet an innate condescension laced his tone. ""My apologies for keeping you waiting, Alexander, Helena.""
I secretly breathed a sigh of relief. Thankfully, he didn't give them the cold shoulder and spared them the embarrassment.
""No need to apologize. We just got here and were chatting with Aurora.
""If you're busy, go ahead. Don't mind us,"" Helena said with a smile.
I lowered my head. ""Let's go, Mom. Lunch is ready.""
Damian sat at the head of the table.
My parents and I were seated to his right and left.
Alexander carefully glanced at him, hesitant to speak.
""Damian... Can I ask a favor? I...""
Everything-from his tone to his attitude-suggested cringe.
Damian said flatly, ""I know the Whitmore Group has been facing some difficulties. You don't need to sweat about the funds. Did you bring the contract?""
Alexander quickly nodded. ""Yes, I did.""
Damian said, ""I'll sign it later, and Aurora will mail it to you tomorrow. The funds will be transferred to the Whitmore Group by this Friday at the latest.""
Alexander and Helena obviously seemed a lot relieved.
They smiled and kept thanking him with the look of a great weight being lifted from their shoulders.
""Aurora is my wife. It's only right that I give the Whitmore family a hand when necessary.""
Hearing this, Helena was no longer worried.
She had always been the straightforward type, not a fan of beating around the bush.
""It's such a relief to see how in love you and Aurora are,"" she said with a smile. ""You know what? I saw a photo of Eleanor's bankroller on the news yesterday, and I was so sure it was you. Can you believe it? I was so worried I barely slept a wink last night.""
Both Damian and I instantly went stiff, and I quickly changed the subject.
After Alexander and Helena left, I slipped the drafted divorce agreement onto the last page of the contract and brought it to the study.
***
In the study, Damian was in front of the computer, dealing with work emails.
The warm yellow light accentuated his chiseled facial outline, reminding me how much I'd loved watching him in rapt attention.
I sighed softly and placed the contract in front of him, ""This is the contract from my dad. If you have a moment, could you sign it now?""
He glanced at me, obviously satisfied with my obedient demeanor. He said with a smile, ""It turns out you do know when to stop.""
""Yes. Thank you for helping my family,"" I said, suppressing the bitterness deep down.
Before signing the contract, he said, ""Oh, and one more thing. With all the paparazzi lately, I'm thinking of bringing Eleanor and Maureen to stay here for a while. Eaststone Heights is the most secure gated community in town, so it'd be safer for them.""
A sense of suffocation overwhelmed me.
I actually forgot that Damian was a shrewd businessman.
Every gift from him came at an equal cost.
There was a price tag on the favor he had done for my family.
I nodded. ""Alright.""
He continued, ""They can take the master bedroom. It'll be better for Maureen...""
""You don't have to explain. I get it,"" I interrupted him. ""I'll move to the guest bedroom.""
Even my husband no longer belonged to me. Why would I give a damn about a bedroom?
Then I pushed the contract closer to him and urged, ""Can you sign it now? My dad's waiting.""
He signed it without saying another word.
As time ticked away, I grew more and more nervous.
The last page was the divorce agreement I'd prepared.
Chapter 7
Luckily, Damian trusted me, at least a little.
He lifted the corner of every page and signed his name in all the required places without even reading the contract.
I felt a wave of complete relief once he had signed the divorce agreement.
Not wanting any surprises, I took the contract away the moment he capped his pen.
Back in the master bedroom, I took out the signed divorce agreement and hid it in a book.
The cooling-off period was a month.
***
That very night, I was ready to move out of the master bedroom.
When he entered and saw me limping and packing, he stopped me.
""Leave it with Shelly and the others.""
His tone was relatively gentle. ""Once all this paparazzi trouble dies down, Maureen and Eleanor will move out, and you can move back here.
""Don't worry. They won't stay here for long.""
I scoffed while glancing at the serious look on his face, ""Gee, I can't tell you how grateful I am. Thank you for your kindness.""
His expression turned cold right away.
Since I was only moving to the guest bedroom, I didn't pack much.
Apart from some skincare products and clothes, the most important item was an urn kept on top of the wardrobe.
I didn't ask for anyone's help. Instead, I stood on a chair and carefully brought the urn down.
The little girl in the photo was the apple of Damian's eye, and what was inside this urn was my most precious treasure.
But unlike other children, mine was denied a carefree life. She'd stay in this urn forever, never feeling the warmth of the sunshine.
When I retrieved the urn, Damian was on the balcony talking on the phone with his assistant. They were devising a plan to bring Eleanor and Maureen back without alerting the paparazzi.
After hanging up, he came back and saw me holding the urn.
Frowning with displeasure, he asked, ""Why are you holding this?""
His deep-set eyes were tinged with a hint of confusion.
Looking at him, I couldn't help but wonder, ""What if my baby hadn't died?
""Would Damian still have had an affair?
""Would my baby have been the apple of his eye?""
But I quickly shook my head to dismiss the thought. It simply wasn't worth consuming myself over a jerk.
Saying nothing, I was about to step out. Just then, Damian grabbed my wrist and asked, ""I'm asking you a question. Why are you holding this?""
I looked at him coldly and said, ""Because it's the only thing that belongs to me in this house.""
Perhaps my words had stirred some last vestige of conscience in Damian. He gradually loosened his grip.
I moved to the guest bedroom, placed the urn in the safest spot, and stared at it for a long, long time...
The next noon, Eleanor and Maureen were taken back to the villa.
Shelly had just made lunch. Though the table was filled with exquisite dishes, everything was vegetarian.
Eleanor and Maureen were obviously not used to it. But to please Damian, Eleanor pretended that she loved the food. She even went from coaxing to coercing Maureen into eating it.
I couldn't help but scoff inwardly. So much for the so-called A-list celebrity.
It was such a relief that she wasn't my idol.
After tasting several dishes, Damian set down his fork and asked Shelly with a frown, ""Were the ingredients flown in today? The bread tastes different, too.""
Shelly glanced at me helplessly before explaining to him, ""Mrs. Caldwell used to do all the cooking, including baking the bread. She always mixed the ingredients to her exact proportions and followed her specific recipe. She's not feeling well today, so I baked the bread. Though I managed to mimic its appearance, I couldn't recreate the flavor.""
It never occurred to Damian that the food would taste so different with another person cooking.
Chapter 8
He stared at me for a long time, his gaze meaningful, but I still didn't offer to take over the cooking again.
After all, who'd waste her time and effort taking care of a man that was never hers?
Damian was too proud and high-and-mighty to ask me to keep cooking vegetarian food for him.
But he was also a picky eater. He called his assistant and ordered, ""Find me a cook who excels at vegetarian cuisine. Money isn't an issue. I want to have them start tomorrow.""
Eleanor had appeared timid and quiet throughout the whole time.
She finally spoke up, ""Ms. Whitmore, I know you're upset with me. It's a bit inappropriate for me to take Maureen to move in like this...""
I interrupted her and said flatly, ""Oh? So, you do know how inappropriate it is. Yet you still shamelessly moved in anyway. Is there really no other place for you in this world besides my home with Damian? It seems you can't live without wrecking someone else's marriage, Eleanor.""
Her expression changed a few times at my harsh words. She instinctively wanted to retort, but she held it back and just looked at Damian through tears.
I was the only one who saw her clenched fists under the table.
Though Maureen was just a little girl, she sensed the hostility in my tone.
Scared, she ran toward Damian, sat on his lap, and asked timidly, ""Daddy, who is she? She's so mean.""
""Don't be afraid, Maureen. She ... isn't a bad person.""
Damian shot me a warning glance. But with Eleanor's presence, he didn't snap at me.
Perhaps he felt a bit guilty. After all, he brazenly took Eleanor and Maureen back into our home right under my nose, and I behaved so ""cooperatively"", not making a scene at all.
That was why he didn't dare push his luck further. Could he really expect me to not only accept them but also welcome them with a smile?
Failing to sow discord, Eleanor obviously was displeased. She couldn't even continue to pretend her interest in the table full of vegetarian food.
I couldn't help but sneer inwardly.
It had been three years since Damian became a vegan, and I, who used to be a total meat-lover, had followed his diet for three years as well.
Now that Eleanor wanted to snatch him away, she couldn't even make such a small sacrifice?
I was full. I set down my fork and left the table under their gazes, mixed with different emotions.
Back at the guest bedroom, I took a deep breath and looked around at the place where I had lived for almost four years now.
Only guests stayed in the guest bedroom, right? A guest-that was exactly what I was now.
Since I didn't sleep at all last night, I wanted to take a nap. Just then, someone knocked on the door.
I opened it and saw Eleanor standing outside.
With a big bag in her hand, she said, ""Sorry, Ms. Whitmore. It's your wedding photo with Dami in the bag. He didn't want Maureen to see it, so I'll have to trouble you to put it away.""
""Don't bother. Toss it into the trash,"" I said deadpan.
Then I was about to close the door.
Failing to rile me up, Eleanor wasn't going to give up just like that.
She quickly held the door frame and said softly, ""Ms. Whitmore, Maureen is a secret between Dami and me. We ... have our reasons. You really don't have to be so upset. Once Maureen and I leave, you can still hang the photo back up.""
A secret?
She made it sound like they were the victims, and I was the villain who stood in their way.
Not bothering to waste my time on her, I grabbed the bag and tossed it onto the floor.
Chapter 9
The glass frame inside the bag shattered. Hearing the sound, Eleanor instinctively looked at me. Not spotting any sadness or regret, she seemed stunned.
Perhaps to her, I was a bitter woman who was dumped by my husband.
I was supposed to crouch on the floor, crying miserably while holding the glass shards.
I glanced at the bag sideways before saying, ""The photo's now taken care of. Is that all? What else do you want me to put away? Perhaps the bed in the master bedroom that I shared with Damian?""
Eleanor was rendered speechless, her delicate features almost twisting with anger.
I slammed the door shut in her face.
Then I placed the bag by the door, not even bothering to take a look at the wedding photo inside.
I'd have Shelly throw it away later.
After waking up from my nap, I started scrolling through Instagram.
Just then, a profile picture caught my eye.
It was Maureen's photo.
Obviously, it was Eleanor's account.
I knew I should've ignored it.
But, driven by impulse, I clicked on it anyway.
Eleanor was surely an A-list star, fiercely protective of her privacy. There wasn't a single photo of her with Damian and Maureen-not even a solo shot of herself.
Yet, the faces of Damian and Maureen were crystal clear. For every milestone and celebration, there was a whole collection of photos, each accompanied by thoughtful captions.
When I was pregnant, I spent a lot of time fantasizing about Damian being a father.
The cruel irony was that it was his mistress who ended up bringing that fantasy to life.
I kept scrolling, wanting to know when his affair had begun.
My finger hovered mid-air as I saw a specific date.
It wasn't the day he first betrayed me, but it was the most devastating day of my life.
I remembered clearly. At the end of the year before last, my mother's condition suddenly worsened.
Having already been in a vegetative state, she suffered multiple organ failure overnight, her life hanging by a thread.
The doctor told me a newly developed type of medical device could completely replace her blood while providing cardiac and respiratory support. If applied in time, it might save the day.
As it turned out, the device was developed by the Caldwell Group.
It hadn't hit the market at that time and could only be obtained through internal channels.
I had thought getting the device would be easy-peasy for Damian.
But after I told him about it on the phone, he said, ""Tell the doctor to treat her at all costs. Money isn't an issue. I got an urgent business matter to attend to, so I gotta go.""
He hung up without waiting for my reply.
But making money was the easiest thing in the world for Damian.
I suppose I was like his money in that way-he came by both of us so easily that he never learned to hold either dear.
Till today, I still remembered how desperate I was after he hung up. What could possibly be more important than my mother's life?
It wasn't until now that I knew his so-called ""urgent business matter"" was taking Maureen to the amusement park.
While I was desperate and alone in Calverton, he was in the largest amusement park in Dreswick with his mistress and illegitimate daughter.
Later, Walter managed to obtain the device, saving my mother's life.
But I'd never shake the despair or the terror of losing her any second.
Suppressing the white-hot rage and gut-wrenching pain, I quickly turned on my laptop, took screenshots of Eleanor's Instagram posts, and saved the photos.
Everything she'd ever used to provoke me would be the proof I used to confront Damian in court.
Staring at the photos, I suddenly remembered Damian saying yesterday that the leaked photos had come from Polaris Media, the company I worked at.
Chapter 10
How was that possible?
I was the editor-in-chief. No content could be published without my authorization.
Had Damian made a mistake? Or someone in my department had done something behind my back?
Just then, someone knocked on the door.
Damian pushed it open and entered before I could respond.
He tossed his phone onto the bed in front of me, demanding, ""How long are you gonna keep this up?""
Puzzled, I picked up the phone, only to discover that a new set of photos of Eleanor had been leaked-again.
Just like before, there was nothing but a blurry silhouette of Damian.
Compared to the photos, the repeated leaks themselves were the bigger problem-they felt ill-intentioned.
I looked at him and said in a barely audible voice, ""It wasn't me. Could you trust me for once?""
Suddenly, Maureen ran into the room, her face smeared with tears. ""Daddy, Mommy's leaving! Please stop her!""
Damian's expression instantly became grim. He picked her up and hurried out.
I followed him to the living room, wanting to clarify things with him.
He was trying to stop Eleanor from leaving.
Meanwhile, Maureen grabbed Eleanor's hand, begging her not to leave while crying pitifully.
I stood aside in silence, watching the family of three.
Netizens always dismissed Eleanor as nothing but a pretty face, claiming even a block of wood would out-act her.
But, from what I witnessed, she had great acting skills-she burst into tears so easily, with her eyes reddening and her voice trembling to perfection.
""Dami, let me go. I really can't stand it anymore,"" she said, tears streaming down her face, ""If this goes on, it's only a matter of time before my reputation is down the drain.""
Before Damian could say anything, I ridiculed with a cold smile, ""Says the mistress who moves into the other's house with her illegitimate daughter.""
""Aurora, shut up!"" Damian snapped.
Then he turned to Eleanor, his tone softening. ""I'll handle this. You can't leave. Maureen needs you.""
Maureen was genuinely terrified that Eleanor would leave just like this. She said through tears, ""Mommy, if you're really going to leave, take Daddy and me with you. OK?""
Pointing at me, she said with a pout, ""She's so mean. I don't want to stay with her.""
Eleanor scooped Maureen up, tears rolling down her cheeks. ""Sweetie, I don't wanna leave you. But...""
I looked at Damian and said flatly, ""No one has to leave. Get a lawyer to come here to inventory our marital assets tomorrow. I'll take what's mine and leave. Then your baby girl won't be frightened any longer.""
Damian was driven to the corner. Besides, both Eleanor and Maureen clearly didn't want to see me here. I figured he'd agree at once now that I offered to leave.
To my surprise, he said firmly, his gaze darkening, ""You're not going anywhere before I get to the bottom of this.""
I was a bit disappointed, but apparently, Eleanor was even more so.
Of course, she wasn't serious about leaving. After keeping up her act for a while, she ""reluctantly"" agreed not to leave.
***
When it was about dinner time, Shelly knocked on the door and tentatively said, ""Mrs. Caldwell, dinner's ready. Would you like me to bring it inside?""
I knew she overheard our argument in the living room in the afternoon and didn't want them to team up against me again.
But I'd never accept being falsely accused.
A part of me screamed to leak all the photos so that everyone could see Damian's face clearly.
But since I didn't do it, I wouldn't own up to it.
I opened the room door and went to the dining room.
Eleanor was surprised to see me.
Damian sat at the head of the table with Eleanor and Maureen on his sides.
It seemed there wasn't a seat for me.",1,1757102193.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False
1n9f9im,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1n9f9im/i_should_just_give_up/,I should just give up,"Law student, about to graduate with no articling lined up. So much debt. I thought i was actually getting places at one firm, but (as I figured), they wouldn’t hire me. Travelled over 6 hours to visit, as they asked. After multiple calls. Multiple reference letters. I get it. I had a terrible first year. 

I don’t feel like anyone believes in me. I don’t even believe in myself. In over my head in readings. Can’t focus. Have to commute over two hours to campus. Busy everywhere. Nowhere to sit or just focus at coffee chats. Homesick and miss where i’m from. Tried to break into that market. Don’t know anyone.

I went into law to make a better life for myself. That was stupid. I am so so *so* stupid. Why did I try? Why did I even believe that there was something waiting for me at the other end? I don’t have a family, I don’t have anything to look forward to, and i’m not getting anything. I’ve got no stability. I’m not even engaged like everyone else. I’m lonely. I go to class, bury myself in readings, and go home. Sure, i contribute in class but that’s my only face time. I am alone otherwise. I’m too stupid to keep up with the class pace.

I can’t even go to a regular firm interview. No one wants me. Just like my family. 

I am so buried in readings, debt, emotions, rejections, isolation, and instability, that I just want to be buried six feet under at this point. 

Why did I even believe things would get better? They weren’t. There was no point in getting As in my 2L or improving. I was only ever going to be punished for not having a good start. There’s no good ending either for me. There never was. No matter how many therapists I see, or times I try to just “handle” myself, I can’t.

I tried to be positive. I really did. But it just looks like i’m in a victim mindset. I’m kicking myself everyday. People say i’m “too hard on myself” and it’s like, uh duhhhhhhh?! Of course I am. The world’s been hard on me. I could show up, be perfect, and overcome challenges just to be kicked in the face everytime I do try. No one likes an autistic woman. No one wants to work with me or invest in me because there’s something fundamentally wrong with me. Right? That’s what I hear every time I step out there. 

I am exhausted. I just really really need something to work out. Just *one* thing. I’m not asking for a handout, I just need grace or something. I need a space where I feel loved and like I belong somewhere without pushing back so hard. I feel like i’m suffocating. I need a hug. 

I knew I was never going to climb out of this mess. It’s my fault I’m not doing better. I just have too much grief. 

What a stupid thing to believe in myself and not trust what others saw in me. Which was that I wasn’t enough, and a lost cause. I am a lost cause. Lost causes don’t deserve a roadmap. ",1,1757102139.0,SuicideWatch,0,1.0,False
1n9f8c0,https://www.reddit.com/r/recoverywithoutAA/comments/1n9f8c0/grief_when_leaving_na/,Grief When Leaving NA,"I have been feeling so much better in general the last few days. No more nasty messages, no more dick pics from men pretending to care, no more excuses for the old timers and insults for me, so I have been in a happier space. 

However, I've noticed the two friends I kind of had at the end have definitely distanced themselves. I also bowl with them weekly. This is awkward, and I thought of my old friends. I watched one couple's dogs, and I don't know if I will be doing that going forward.

A year ago I was so happy. I had found what I thought were my people. I didn't think I had to do this alone anymore. But now I really do, and this is scary for me. I haven't had anyone to call in months, but I miss seeing people and the shitty coffee sometimes. I miss the hugs. People didn't really touch me at the end, but a year ago I had entered during a period of grief. My grandparents had died and I had a miscarriage and relapsed after five years clean. I walked in and about three or four months in, I had lots of friends. Nobody thought I was all that weird or at least they all pretended to care. I was told I would definitely make it and was in this for life. There was basically no doubt about me. That's changed entirely. 

This woman who started this whole thing has both my one and five year chips this guy gave to me even though I was clean on my own those five years. I want them back, she should have given them back when she started this and refused to make it stop. I feel less insane than when I was hanging on to being a part of the group, but I'm seriously grieving. I wanted my 9 month chip too. I earned them no matter what anyone thinks of me. I bet a very small fraction of them would have made it the last three months feeling the way I did.  

I have autism and there were jealousy issues so a lot of these friends I had were talking shit months before I knew it, but I didn't think my sponsor would tell everyone my business. I almost preferred living in a delusion where I fit in somewhere for the first time in my life. I've never belonged anywhere.

So now I don't really know how to handle the grief. I'm getting therapy and am part of dbt and dual diagnosis groups, but I can only see them and talk to them so often. There are restrictions on actually forming friendships which is good to prevent bullying like what I went through, but goddamn I'm lonely.  

I can't go back to that place even if I wanted to, but I want to move on. I want to feel okay again. I want somewhere where I can maybe be myself yet still accepted. I used because it was the only thing that made me not feel ashamed of who I am. Shame made me this way, and shame will only make me worse. 

Anyways, any suggestions? I have literally nobody to talk to about this. I have no addicts who aren't in NA in my life. It's just me.  Am I even an addict? Is that a thing? I'm so confused.

I still remember my first corporate lease at Bahrain Financial Harbour—floor-to-ceiling windows shimmering with Gulf sunlight, the call to prayer echoing over the bay, and endless streams of coffee during majlis-style meetings. But no matter how stunning the view or how bustling the Diplomatic Area can be by 11 a.m., every business in Bahrain eventually faces the tough question: What are the tax implications and procedural realities of winding down operations in the Kingdom?\

Bahrain’s 2025 Business Environment: Opportunity and Caution\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting, Bahrain business district. highlights Bahrain as the Gulf’s most foreigner-friendly market, boasting up to 99% foreign ownership for most sectors (Keylink guide) and streamlined digital government services via Sijilat.\
\
However, closure requires precise planning. Mishandling final tax settlements or company de-registration can leave you liable for hidden fees or future blacklisting.\
\
A close friend of mine almost missed a crucial deadline with the Labour Market Regulatory Authority (LMRA), and only a last-minute call from their sponsor at Tamkeen saved them thousands in administrative penalties.\

Business Closure, Liquidation, and Tax: The Heart of the Matter\
What Triggers Tax Implications When Closing a Bahrain Company?\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration, Bahrain team partnership.\
- Unpaid social insurance (GOSI)\
- Employee end-of-service settlements\
- Municipal taxes on premises (especially in Manama and Seef District)\
- Customs and excise on stock liquidation\
And, as of February 2025, late VAT deregistration can trigger 5-20% penalties on last reported turnover, as per Reuters market analysis.\
Types of company structures affected: (Read more: Bahrain business types)\
- WLL (With Limited Liability)\
- SPC (Single Person Company)\
- S.P.C.C. (Single Person Closed Company)\
- BSC (Bahrain Shareholding Company)\
- Branch of a Foreign Company\
My advice? Never assume a zero-tax reputation means zero closure friction.\
\
Step-By-Step Company Closure Process: Insider Savvy\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation, handling paperwork for closure and tax.\
Step 1: Board Resolution and Partner Consent\
- Draft and notarize closure board resolution.\
- Obtain all shareholder/partner signatures (tip: digital signatures via the Sijilat portal are now accepted for most WLLs).\
Step 2: Regulatory Notifications\
- Official notification to MOICT (Ministry of Industry, Commerce & Tourism) using Sijilat.\
- Notify the LMRA to freeze work visas—do this before canceling CR to avoid fines.\
Step 3: Tax Declarations and Deregistration\
- File final VAT return; settle all dues with the National Bureau for Revenue (NBR).\
- Deregister for VAT—MOICT process explained.\
Step 4: Settle Employees and Social Insurance\
- Calculate and pay all employee end-of-service benefits.\
- Final GOSI (General Organization for Social Insurance) clearance—tip: book your appointment at the Seef GOSI office on Wednesdays after 2 p.m. to avoid crowds.\
Step 5: Bank Account Closure and Asset Disposal\
- Liquidate assets (use local auction houses or online portals).\
- Close all business bank accounts—bring your MOICT closure certificate.\
Step 6: Public Announcement\
- Publish closure notice in two local newspapers (Arabic and English, usually GDN and Al-Wasat).\
Step 7: Final MOICT Deregistration\
- Submit all supporting documents: tax clearances, employee proof, asset disposition.\
- Receive the official deregistration certificate (keep digital and hard copies).\
Documents Checklist Shortcut:\
* Prepare all clearance letters (VAT, GOSI, LMRA) simultaneously—most can be stamped virtually now.\
* Draft template letters for each authority—saves you 2-3 weeks in correspondences.\
Fast-track tip: Use a corporate service provider with direct government liaisons. I recommend Keylink—their in-house agents helped me cut at least 30% off the usual timeline.\
\
Tax, Fees, and Cost Considerations: What Should You Budget?\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs, Bahrain business finances.:**\
\
Government fees: BHD 100–250 for MOICT deregistration and public notices.\
VAT clearance: Varies; most SMEs see BHD 300–1,200 in final VAT bills and penalties if delayed.\
Legal & advisory fees: BHD 600–2,500 if using a professional agent or audit firm.\
Employee settlements: Individual end-of-service gratuity, typically BHD 250–600 per employee.\
GOSI clearance: Admin fees of BHD 10–30 (ignore this and you face ongoing annual renewals).\
\
\
Importantly, the 2025 MOICT e-Filing Transition (rolled out in March) now requires all tax, GOSI, and LMRA clearance letters to be uploaded digitally before final quarantine of the CR.\
\
Cost-saving tip: Prepare all digital files as PDFs named in English and Arabic. The Sijilat portal returns fewer errors when files are dual-labeled.\
For detailed, real-time cost guides, visit: Bahrain company formation cost.\
\
Regulatory Compliance: Avoiding Common Pitfalls\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation, Bahrain tax regulatory audit. notification and visa cancellation.\
- VAT deregistration within 30 days.\
- GOSI clearance letter.\
- MOICT final audit (for BSC and WLLs).\
Bahrain’s 2025 Update: All closure processes now require e-signature authentication if you registered after Jan 1, 2023. This adds an extra layer of verification but accelerates final approval by nearly 40%.\
When I first closed a small consulting SPC in Manama, I missed the updated e-signature requirement—resulting in a one-week delay. Now, I always check the Sijilat “compliance bulletin” before lodging any request.\
For ongoing compliance support and reliable outsourced accounting, consider: Accounting and Bookkeeping Services.\
\
Bahrain Business Culture: Offbeat Yet Relevant Insights\
Surprisingly, much of the closure process is smoothed by strong relationships. Majlis-style meetings—informal, with Arabic coffee and sweet dates—still resolve more issues than dozens of emails. (During Ramadan, government offices open only in the mornings; plan ahead for any filings.)\
And here’s a tangent: Don’t underestimate the power of networking at the Bahrain Chamber of Commerce breakfast gatherings in Seef. More than once, I’ve seen a tricky regulatory hold-up resolved after a polite chat over gahwa.\
The Bahrain vs. UAE and KSA Factor\
Compared to the UAE and Saudi Arabia, Bahrain’s closure process is:\
- More digital (thanks to Sijilat and the MOICT one-stop portal).\
- Quicker for most SMEs (Dubai’s process is often slowed by DED and municipality approvals).\
- Less expensive (Saudi closure costs can climb due to zakat and complex labour clearances).\
However, Bahrain’s system rewards those who plan—last-minute rushing is always punished, no matter your connections.\
\
When You Need Local Sponsorship or Free Zone Status\
If you’re operating with a local sponsor or in a Bahrain Free Zone, closure involves one extra review layer. Sponsors must sign off on the de-registration, and some free zones (e.g., Bahrain Logistics Zone) require additional customs clearance.\
Relevant resources:\
- Local Sponsorship in Bahrain\
- Free Zones in Bahrain\
Tip: Always meet your sponsor in person for the final signature—it's a sign of respect deeply valued in Bahrain’s business circles.\

\
FAQ: Closing a Business in Bahrain\
Q1: How long does it take to close a Bahrain company, start to finish?\
With all documents in order, most SMEs close in 6–8 weeks. Complex firms may require 3–5 months due to multiple clearances. Using a corporate agent can reduce this by up to 40%.\
See: Bahrain company formation process\
Q2: Do I need to pay VAT when closing?\
Yes, if your company is VAT-registered, you must file a final VAT return and clear all dues before you can deregister the company. Delays trigger penalties of 5-20%.\
See official guidelines.\
Q3: What happens if I fail to cancel employee visas properly?\
Un-cancelled visas result in ongoing LMRA and GOSI charges—even after CR closure. Always get written confirmation from LMRA. I once spent two months fixing a missed visa deregistration for a client; now it's my very first step every time.\
Q4: Can a foreigner close a 100% foreign-owned company?\
Absolutely. Bahrain permits 99-100% foreign ownership for most sectors. The process is the same but all shareholders must sign off. Full details: Foreigner ownership activities.\
Q5: My company is in a Free Zone. Anything special I should know?\
Yes, you’ll need clearance from the Free Zone authority and customs, plus possible extra public notice requirements. Often, more government touchpoints are involved.\
\
\
Final thought: Business in Bahrain rewards those who plan, network, and show respect for local customs—from a friendly handshake in the Seef lobby to a farewell cup of gahwa when you close your final account at Bahrain Bay.\

If you want to roll out a new venture again, proper closure is your passport back. Handle it with care and Bahrain’s doors will always remain open.",1,1757102024.0,companysetupbh,1,1.0,False

I wanted to share something that's made a big difference for me personally — especially for those of us here trying to better understand how to support acid-base balance naturally without relying solely on meds. 

For a long time, I struggled with the ups and downs of digestive discomfort, reflux, fatigue, and what felt like general acidity overload. After experimenting with all kinds of diets, supplements, and hydration strategies, I came across **Alklyte – Designer Electrolytes** — a simple mineral powder that blends **bicarbonates and citrates** to help **buffer acidity and support a more alkaline internal environment**.

Hey everyone,

I wanted to share something that’s made a real difference for me personally — especially for those of us here trying to better understand how to support **acid-base balance naturally**, without relying solely on medications.

For a long time, I dealt with cycles of **digestive discomfort, fatigue, and what felt like systemic acidity**. I tried various diets, hydration strategies, and supplements. Eventually, I came across **Alklyte – Designer Electrolytes**, a mineral blend that combines **bicarbonates and citrates**, which I found helpful in supporting a more balanced internal pH.

""The maintenance of acid-base equilibrium is essential to human health, and any shift in the dynamic towards a more acidic environment has been associated with poorer health outcomes...”  [M.L.Wieers, et. al. (2024) “Dietary acid load in health and disease.”  Pflugers Arch. 2024 Jan 29;476(4):427–443. doi: 10.1007/s00424-024-02910-7.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11006742/#:~:text=Introduction,relationships%20in%20health%20and%20disease)

# What’s different about Alklyte?

* It’s not just another “alkaline water” or generic mineral mix.
* It’s based on **dual buffering chemistry** (citrates + bicarbonates) that mirrors the body’s own pH regulation systems.
* It dissolves quickly in water (or even coffee), with **no sugar, no artificial additives**, and a clean, mildly tangy taste.
* It’s made in **small batches** with **reduced plastic packaging** — unlike most bottled options.

I’ve personally noticed more consistent hydration, less discomfort after meals, and better energy throughout the day.

If you’ve been exploring natural ways to reduce **dietary acid load**, or are curious about how **alkaline mineral buffers** work, check it out or drop your questions here. I’m happy to share how I use it and how it compares to other strategies that I found ineffective like lemon water, apple cider vinegar, straight baking soda, or low-acid diets.

Let’s keep this conversation going — anyone else tried **citrate or bicarbonate-based** approaches for hydration or pH support?

2 oz of yogurt washed rum
1oz of mango puree
¾ oz Amaretto 
¾ oz of cardamom syrup 
½ oz of lime juice 
¼ oz of rose water
Dash of cardamom bitters 

I added full fat greek yogurt to a jar, then poured the mixture for the cocktails over it. I'd say about 1 ounce  of yogurt per cocktail.

I like the mixture sit for about 45 minutes then strained it overnight in refrigerator using a coffee filter and a fine mesh strainer.

My a1c is not too bad at 6.5, but more recently my blood sugar has been going out of control and will stay high for many hours sometimes 6 hours in the 190s-200s+. I notice also that often for the same meals with the same dose at the same time, it could either go really well (stable, good levels) or poorly and rise later. Obviously, sleep and stress are other factors at play.. but still.

I say this because over the past year, I have this throbbing pain in my upper sides, closer to the rib areas, that over the past few months is just starting to flare up more and feel worse. And I generally just feel like crap a lot of the time.

After abusing myself stress wise and with poor sleep and diabetic timing over the 1.5 years (even despite decent a1c's throughout this time), I finally have started to change things for the better in the last month, with better sleep and dose timing, that is more consistent. Things are weird, some days, my levels are really, really good, never better, but other days, they are wild and stay higher for quite a while.

For the last month, I've been supplementing with Vit D3 and Magnesium Citrate as I am deficient in D, and I've always felt bad symptoms with supplements for whatever reason, so I am wondering if this could be the culprit. Or maybe my morning coffee. But my anxiety-brain always thinks the worst in that it could be something else, like GI related.

for me to contextualize this, picture a McDonalds or a Starbucks. obviously only paying customers get to sit inside the establishment, cause otherwise you'd be eating the air and space of people who have made a monetary contribution, which you havent. 

today i wandered into oakham cafe in hopes of doing the same thing. i bought myself a bagel and i got myself a coffee. the bagel was white and crusty, as if it was their afterthought menu item, and they were too careless to apply butter for you, so there it was, in a small sauce container along with a provided wood butter knife. i didnt have high hopes since this was a small establishment, but im afraid the negative experience extends far beyond the food. 

but by far the most insulting part was when i stepped ONE foot towards the nearly empty seating area after picking up my food at the counter. as i did so, a man quickly stopped me in my place, and after greeting me, had explained that i don't qualify to sit inside their cafe due to a bagel being a ""takeout item"", so i was forced to walk to another campus building to eat the food. 

i've never experienced such a big spit in the face, since this isn't just a regular cafe. we students contribute 2 dollars every (year or semester??) to this very cafe as part of our tuition, regardless if you decide to dine there or not, yet they impose a cap on who can enter and not enter the seating area; something that even a regular cafe or fast food joint wouldn't do.  

this school already has numerous unforgivable flaws. we don't need any more

Four years ago, I married my best friend. He is a Muslim from Bosnia, and recently he started practicing his religion. That part isn’t the main focus of this story, though. We have a 3-year-old daughter, and I’m currently pregnant with our son.

At first, when my family and friends met him, I was certain they liked him. They acted warm and welcoming, and he never gave anyone a reason not to accept him. Looking back, I realize I probably had rose-colored glasses on because it never crossed my mind that our different backgrounds would matter.
We talked about religion early on and agreed that our children will have the freedom to choose their own beliefs when and if they wish. Neither of us will make that decision for them.

This is by far the best relationship I’ve ever had. He is my best friend, my rock, and my biggest support.
A few months ago, my mom (who had always shown nothing but respect toward him) suddenly started questioning his intentions. She told me she was worried about “losing me” and said she thought my husband was becoming a bit extreme in his views and religious practices.

I was completely shocked. My husband never talks about religion with anyone besides me, and only when I specifically ask him to explain something. He has never pressured me to convert or pushed any kind of agenda. We live a peaceful, normal life, and honestly, I never expected my life to feel this calm and happy.

Recently, things became clearer. My brother-in-law, who is an extreme right-wing type of person, went to my mom and gave her a whole speech about how he “saw through” my husband from the very beginning. He claimed that my husband has bad intentions toward me, that once our son is born my daughter and I will be “forgotten,” and that my husband is dangerous and we should all be careful around him.

Suddenly, my mom’s strange behavior started to make sense. Sadly, she tends to listen to men without questioning them, probably because of how she was raised by her father.

I’m furious. My sister knew about all of this but never said a word to protect me or even to warn me when I was struggling to understand what was going on with our mom. I’m hurt and shocked that these people could sit with us, eat food that my husband cooked, laugh, have coffee together… and then turn around and speak about him so disgustingly behind our backs.

Now my husband and I are thinking about moving to Bosnia. I just don’t know how to deal with this.

If anyone has gone through something similar, I would really appreciate hearing how you handled these heartbreaking situations that seem designed to divide the family you’re trying so hard to build.

The other day my kid was mid-meltdown about not wanting the food that I made (a usual favorite... not sensory related, he's just 3), and after getting through the worst of it, I very dramatically said ""I SURE HOPE NOBODY EATS MY FOOD!!!"" I then turned around and heard sneaky giggling behind me as he ""stole"" a bite of the food. It became a whole thing- every time I lifted my sandwich to take a bite, or my spoon to slurp some soup, he would open his mouth and the food would be magically magnetized into it! Oh no!!!1!1! He ate a ton.


Today I was warming up rice/veggie stir fry and and he saw me doing so and started arguing that he ONLY wanted rice. I started trying to bribe him into eating just a couple bites of the veggies first, then I remembered what worked before and suddenly said ""Oh NO, I sure hope nobody eats the carrots out of my bowl!!!"" Fast forward about 20 minutes and he's picked almost all the veggies out of the bowl and eaten some rice too. I even got a plate of my own and just watched him and said ""HEY!"" like I was offended every time he took a bite out of his ""stolen"" bowl of food. If I forgot to say ""HEY!"" he would prompt me. 🤣


He's 3.5 and knows it's a game. His dad has used reverse psychology playfully a few times before to get him to do stuff, so he's familiar with what we're doing- but I think he likes feeling like he's getting to be ""naughty"" and powerful. I think the key is getting that sparkle in your eye and being clearly playful about it. Because I'm sure he knows we're playing, I'm not worried about him actually trying to steal food in real life. Occasionally the game doesn't work if he's still too upset. He can't be red-zone tantruming for it to work.


I've had trouble making power struggles into something fun many times, and often just slog through the tantrums I can't prevent. This is one of the few times I've been able to figure it out! I also have a 3 month old and don't always have the energy to make stuff fun, either. It has to be after a strong cup of coffee.",15,1757100522.0,toddlers,6,1.0,False

It was huge and lots of exploring to do filled with gorgeous Disney artwork and the Aladdin theme throughout. The grand hall was splendid and breathtaking. 

Food was good in Marvel and Coco. 1923 was decent the first night but the second rotation options were meh. Shows were really good in both Marvel and the 2 nights in Coco. 

On the poolside, the festival of food was nice with some of my kids loving Donald’s Cantina. 

I was bummed that when I asked if Marcellene had outdoor sitting (like Cabanas) I was told no. I found out 3 days later after exploring. 

Service was phenomenal and this was our 4th cruise and the dining servers were the best out of all (Magic and Dream x2) and the kicker is that this was our server teams first rotation with Disney!

Events and shows were on par. We lined up for Moana 90 mins prior (yes, you have to to get good seats). We went on the second day 6pm show. We heard the 6p show on the first day was filled up and folks who were lined up later didn’t get seats. 

We skipped the Beauty and Beast since we had already seen it twice in a row (the latest one being 4 months ago). 

The buckets and boards show on night 1 was just OK. Nothing great. The adults show was also just OK but that was me. The magic show with Jessica Jane for both kids and adults was really good. 

The not so good:
I didn’t like how they glass paned out the pool deck 11 with no air vents. Made the deck really hot and I missed the open air vibe as enjoyed on the legacy ships. 

There’s literally no dining option if you decide to skip your dining. Everything closes early (except for room service). I believe the pizza station is open late too. 
But all other food you have to buy at the lounges. 

Ice cream station shuts down too around 10pm. 

The good thing is that at the buffets and ice cream it’s all behind the counter so you have people serving you. Cuts down line and keeps it more sanitary. 

The ice cream station did have multiple flavors over various days so that was really good. 

Didn’t like that there was no free snacks at the coffee spots. And I feel like Disney is starting to nickel/dime on the food with early closures. ",7,1757100518.0,dcl,3,0.82,False

Today, after about 5 pounds of coffee, I cleaned my ZP6 for the first time since opening the box. Upon opening, I recalibrated the ZP6 to burr lock at 0. Burr rub stopped after 12 clicks.

Today, after cleaning and recalibrating, slight burr rub occurs until 19 clicks.

Is this normal? I use my ZP6 in the 6 range because anything less than 5.5 creates coffee that's weirdly bitter  and sour, hitting with bitter first then quickly sour to finish. I'm also still getting fines at 6.2 and above. Less than when I first got the grinder, but still surprising.

All this seems different than the experiences I've read on this forum.

That said, I've gotten some of the best cups I've had in my coffee journey. I'm concerned that maybe the lack of consistency of good to great cups could be due to the burr rub issue above. I'll get great cups for 3-5 days, but after that window of time, I can't get any flavor and am consistently chasing the notes I was experiencing.

So last time I checked, I've managed to lose from that kilo to 97.6 kilos. Not much, but I recently started a diet and I run and exercise every day. And speaking of diet... I'm a little worried, but needlessly so, because, well, I think I ate too much because I was only supposed to eat three times a day and drink water. But I did eat six meals today: a small sip of an energy drink, coffee, coffee, rice with sauce, scrambled eggs, and two sausages (I'm not sure I count coffee as a meal, but I'm afraid I'll never lose weight if I don't). So, uhm, and it often happens that when I eat too much in one day, for example, that if I eat 4 meals, I have to eat only 2 tomorrow, because I'm kind of subtracting another one the day I exceed those 3 meals... And I don't know... Today, for example, I exercised. I tried to keep my legs up for 10 minutes. I didn't care that they were shaking and idk... I don't know if I'm doing it right. But my mom isn't concerned, so... I know you people are struggling with the extra weight, and I'm keeping my fingers crossed that you can get back to a appropriate weight adapted to your height!

Hi everyone!!! So I need help with smth please. I have a neighbour/ friend and she’s 25 yo. She has a daughter that is 7 and has to start school. Today I went to her apartment to drink coffee (we live in the same building) and she complained about not knowing how to buy a backpack and everything that her daughter needs for school. She has a husband that works as a driver but doesn’t earn really much. 
No I’m asking for advice because I want to help her, but there are some issues. 
1. I landed her money before but the issue is that I can’t offer to land her money because my bf found out on other occasions and he does not approve and gets mad. Just to be clear, I would use my own money, not his, but he still doesn’t approve because he thinks it’s irresponsible to do this and I don’t want to fight with him. He found out because her husband either thanked him/ returned him the money when he answered at the door, instead of returning them to me, so it’s too risky that landing her money will cause me problems with my bf again
2. My plan was maybe to go buy a backpack and school supplies and gift it to them, but then there’s a chance they could mention it when they see my bf in the hallway, so risky again. 
3. I could help but specifically tell them that my bf doesn’t have to know about this, but this will probably make them feel insulted and would make them sad, because it’s clear that my bf doesn’t trust them.

1n9egnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/1n9egnb/26_years_old_making_50k_as_a_program_manger_in/,"26 Years Old, Making $50K as a Program Manger in Oklahoma, and Visited Family in Dallas Over the Labor Day Weekend","# Background

Although only one year has passed since my last money diary, a lot has changed for me, so I decided to post again! When I last posted, I was living and working in Boston as a program coordinator. I'm now back in my home state, Oklahoma, where I moved back to at the start of this year. I wanted to be near family for a little while due to a combination of mental health and the current state of the USA being stressful. I'm now living in a college town that straddles the line between LCOL and MCOL (rent here for a 1 bedroom would be in the $750-1000 range). I got a 2 bedroom apartment with my sister, who is attending the college that I'm working at as a program manager. Life feels slower and simpler here. 

My current job is the type of job I thought I really wanted to be in. I directly impact first gen and low income college students and I \*love\* that I can support them on their journeys but the pay isn't there and it's fully in office. In 2025, I have moved away from the dream job mentality - I need to pivot into a career that has a higher pay ceiling and is more flexible. I'm considering data analysis. 

My short term money goal is to build up my emergency fund to help myself feel like I have some form of safety net. My long term goals are still to find a place I actually like to live in, and to retire early. Oklahoma isn't as bad as it seemed to my younger self, but I still want to try other places that have more career opportunities and more blue policies. (Interested in California.) I'm not sure if owning a house or condo is something I want to include in my long term goals, but it's a decision for another stage of my life anyways.

# Net worth

**Assets**

* Checking account: \~$300 stays in here, just in case I need to get something with a debit card and so I can pay the electric and wifi bills once I see them.
* Savings account, bucket #1: \~$3,500 emergency fund, which I'm aiming to grow into 3 months worth of expenses. That would be \~$7,000 for me. I might target 6 months of expenses once I get closer, but I would rather have more investments before doing that.
* Savings account, bucket #2: \~$500 travel fund, which I started recently because I'd love to go on a vacation. Aside from camping as a kid, I haven't done much travel outside of work trips. I'm looking at maybe doing a cruise once I hit \~$1,500. Contributing a minimum of $25/month, and anything I have extra at the end of the month (up to $100).
* Brokerage: \~$50,000
* Roth IRA: \~$68,000
* 403b Retirement Account (old employer): $10,000
* 401a Retirement Account (current employer): $1,900
* Debt: I took out a $20,000 margin loan near the end of last year to reinvest into my brokerage, and have been very slowly putting $100/month to it, as well as having all dividends earned from the account feed into the loan (also about $100/month). The rate on it is 6.45%. So the brokerage's true total value is ($50,000 cash + $19,000 loaned), but I only consider the $50k part in my net worth. I don't know if this was the smartest move, but it's all in stocks that are strongly in the S&P500 and I was starting to feel ""behind"" on retirement due to being on too many FIRE subs. So, I took a gamble. Once my income increases, I'm going to take a more heavy handed repayment approach to get rid of the margin loan within 5 years. 

**Total Net Worth \~$134,000** 

# Income

* I'm salaried at \~$50,000/year. My income progression is: <$10k (internships + excess scholarships) as an undergrad pre-2020, $35k-$40k (fellowship income) as a grad student from 2020-2023, and $82k in my first job in a HCOL city in 2024. 
* My current pay schedule is monthly. After taxes and deductions, I earn $3100/month.
* My sister who lives with me sends me $450/month in contribution to the rent and bills, while she's attending college. She works part time, and we don't combine expenses other than our grocery arrangement and the $450 she sends me. I believe she makes \~$1400/month.
* I am no longer doing side hustles. It's a weight off my shoulders to not scramble and try to fit in catsitting, selling on poshmark, surveys, etc. 

# Monthly Expenses

I'm very happy to no longer be paying to park everywhere I go since I left Boston! The wide open roads and plentiful sunshine in Oklahoma do suit me a lot more than the northeast. My car is a 2010 SUV. It's parked at a mechanic's lot because of transmission issues. I could live car-free right now since I walk to work, and my sister has a car, but I'm really attached to my car. So, I'm going to fix it unless the repair would cost more than a used car with less issues. Still waiting on the repair price quote.

* Rent: $1100 for a two bedroom apartment, plus $45 for a pet fee.
* Health, dental and vision insurance: \~$210.
* Gas: \~$20. I walk to work and it only takes a few minutes to drive around this small town, so I barely use gas.
* Auto insurance: $85. This got a lot cheaper since I changed states! 
* Electric bill: $195 for August. I've kept the apartment at 73 (night) - 76 (day) all summer. This is like a 700-800 square foot apartment! Is this normal or is this place poorly insulated? I have no clue. 
* Internet: $65.
* Phone: $30.
* Groceries: \~$180-215 is my range for the last 3 months. My sister also buys \~$200/month of groceries, and we share all food except any treats that we have off limits from each other. 
* Cat food, litter, treats: \~$25, bought in bulk every 3ish months. 
* Gym membership: provided for free by the University. 
* 401a/retirement account: $100. This is very low right now because I've decided to build an emergency fund before re-focusing on it. This is partly because I started having car trouble, and partly because I want to double down on being able to actually have cash in hand if I lose my job.
* HSA/health savings account: $20. 
* Savings accounts: $1000. This is split $950 for the emergency fund and $50 for the vacation fund. 

**Fixed monthly expenses total \~$1750.** This subtotal doesn't count insurance and 403b, as those are deduced before I get my paycheck.

The monthly take home of $3550 (after all deductions, and including the $450 from my sister), minus the monthly expenses of \~$1750, results in leftover funding of \~$1800 for takeout, shopping and saving.

**Reflections:** Sometimes I wonder - am I wasting my 20's since I'm not traveling and exploring like I want to, nor am I buying a home while it's affordable in Oklahoma? But at the same time, I feel like I just have to do whatever it takes to retire early, since the experience of working full time causes me to have so much exhaustion that I feel like I'm not enjoying life as much as I want to, so minimizing the number of years I have to work full time must be the best thing for me? Either way, I need to stay off the main FIRE sub as a lot of the posts are out of touch to me. I frankly am jealous of folks who have well adjusted and well off backgrounds, but I am actively working on trying to be at peace with where I came from and how I can make my future better. 

I debated on whether or not to do a detailed diary format this time, as I hadn't done so last year. Money Diaries are my favorite things to read on Reddit, but I feel like my life is more boring than average. And the ongoing depression I have is not helping. But I went ahead and kept the details, and tracked through the Labor Day weekend as well. 

# Weekly Spending: 

8/23 - Since it was Saturday, I caught up on the sleep I lose all week since I have to be up in the office 5 days a week. I stayed in bed until 11am, which meant I was in bed for over 10 hours, lol. Then I got up and had brunch, which was oatmeal with diced bananas, chocolate chips, a bit of peanut butter and whipped cream on top. My only plan for the day was to play video games with another sibling, so I sat on the couch and started watching anime until he was ready. I recently got back into anime after a multi-year break. The clips of ""The Summer Hikaru Died"" that popped into my Instagram feed were just too interesting to resist. So far, I'm really enjoying the show! I didn't feel like doing any ""real"" cooking, so I had eggs with toast, avocados and diced tomatoes for lunch, along with a large homemade iced coffee. Avocados are creeping up in price even here, a single one is about $1.30 now at Walmart. I remember them being $0.65 just a few years ago! Later, I joined a discord call with my brother and gamed for a few hours. After we wrapped up, I went into the kitchen and made some fried rice. It was 10:30pm. I watched TikToks while eating, and then I kept watching TikToks until midnight. I begrudgingly decided to get ready for bed. I had a late night protein shake and did my bedtime routine. While in bed, I decided to finally bite the bullet and buy the things that were waiting for me in the Amazon cart: bralettes and underwear, protein powder, and melatonin gummies. I need melatonin every work night, alas. Daily total: $68.

8/24: Despite not going to bed until nearly 1am, I woke up at about 9:15, which is early for me. I must've really caught up on sleep on Saturday! I really wanted to be at the gym, but my current gym is on campus and I can never make myself go on the weekend since I'm already on campus 5 days a week. So, of course, I failed to go again. I sat on the couch and watched Tiktoks for a few hours. I've been really getting into the ones about cave divers - if you know, you know! I like caves, but I could never go cave diving. Then I had brunch, which was eggs and avocado toast. We're out of tomatoes, but I put so much salsa on the eggs that I didn't miss them (much). I started looking through what new anime had come out in the past few years, and decided to start watching the new Black Butler seasons. I watched all of the other ones that came out several years ago. I had some leftover fried rice for lunch and decided to walk to the library for some books. I recently started antidepressants, which I think is why I'm motivated to read and watch things again. On the way back from the library, I got a big iced tea from HTeaO. I LOVE HTeaO. In the evening, I started this money diary, adding all of the information except for the weekly spending for the upcoming days, then I just watched more Tiktok, finished off the fried rice and chased it down with a protein shake, and did my bedtime routine. I tried to be in bed at my enforced weeknight time of 11:30pm but I couldn't fall asleep for over an hour. Daily total: $4.

8/25: I got up at 8:10am, since I have to be on campus at 9am most days. Most of the campus is 8am-5pm, but I asked for 9am-6pm as a condition to take this job offer, due to my delayed circadian rhythm. Every hour that I sleep in the morning is significantly more restful than if I tried to be in bed earlier. My alarm is set to the latest possible wakeup time that I can have and still make it. I walk to/from the office, which helps wake me up some, but I normally don't feel totally awake until the afternoon or evening. There are also just some days that I feel like I never lose the groggy state. Since I didn't cook last night, I went out for lunch with my sister. We went to an Indian restaurant, and it was great. It's new in town and I easily concluded it was the best food in town now and deserves way more business, so I went hard on the tip. We also went to get some hair dye to do my hair later this week. I went back and forth between some shades in the reddish-purplish family and went with a very dark violet. In the evening, I was having a hard time because I kept thinking about how intense the next day would be. The rainy weather didn't help my mood. I watched some Black Butler until I needed to be in silence, and then I picked up the webnovel I've been reading, Panguan. Since we got so much Indian food, I had leftovers both for my post-work meal and my dinner. At night, I went on a walk and worked on a short story that I'm writing. Daily total: $70 at the restaurant + $12 hair dye = $82.

8/26: Tuesdays are the day I have to be on campus at 7:45am in the fall semester. This is because I have to teach a seminar course. In addition, my job had a work event from 12-4:30, and I had to give a seminar at 5pm. I was thoroughly exhausted. I crashed on the couch as soon as I got home, to spend the rest of the day reading a webnovel, and sent an email notifying my job that I was taking a sick day tomorrow. Daily total: $0.

8/27: Slept in and spent most of the day doing slow things to recover from the previous day. I get plenty of sick days, and I don't feel guilty about using them for mental health days like this. It was also still raining, so I was glad to be at home! I had a lab done at an urgent care visit back in January and they recently sent me a bill for $250... After about 2 weeks of sitting on it, I finally gathered the steam to call them to ask if there was a discount to pay in full right away. There was! So, I paid $125 to wipe the slate clean. I also paid my rent, but I won't count that in the total at the end of this since it would make the weekly spend numbers look quite off. I get paid on the last business day of the month, and have early pay with my bank, so my once a monthly paycheck came in. About a third of it goes towards rent (I use the Bilt credit card and then pay it off immediately), a third of it goes straight to savings, and a third of it goes towards the other expenses that accumulated over the month. Except for the wifi and electric bills, which I have directly coming from my checking account, I use credit cards for all my other expenses and pay them off monthly. I've accumulated a lot of travel points, which I'm definitely going to use someday. In the evening, I had a phone call to catch up with a friend who moved to Maryland a few years ago for a job opportunity. We stay in touch with calls a couple of times per year. Daily total: $125

8/28: I forgot to make note of what happened on Thursday. I don't particularly remember anything for most of the day so I assume I just went to work and went home. I did buy us just a little more Indian food for dinner so we didn't have to cook before our upcoming trip. Daily total: $33.

8/29: My sister and I both took the day off so that we could drive down to Dallas to visit our brother over the Labor Day weekend. We slept in and took a little while to get ready, so we didn't hit the road until 2pm. Unfortunately that did mean we arrived during rush hour. I drove the first half because I'm the worse driver and do not feel confident enough to drive in Dallas. My sister paid for the gas during the drive, and I bought a slice of French silk pie to split, from a gas station ($7). Unfortunately, it was not good at all. When we arrived, we went to another gas station to get Froyo that my brother claimed was cheap and delicious. Spoiler, it was only cheap, and not delicious. I paid for us there ($6 for 2 portions, my sister didn't want any), and then I paid for ice cream, sherbet and sprinkles at Walmart since the froyo was so disappointing ($19). Blue Bell for the win. Then my brother got us dinner. Daily total: $32

  
Weekly Total: Shopping ($80) + Restaurants/Teas and Coffees/Takeout ($120) + Grocery Store ($19) = $219 for normal weekly expenses + $125 for the unexpected medical bill =  $344 in total. (Over budget, so next week was forced to be a cheap week, aka a week with no takeout.)

Note: There wasn't a grocery trip the past week since we were planning to go on a trip.

**Bonus: Labor Day Weekend**

8/30: The three of us went to a donut place, Starbucks, Ross, HMart, and a taco place. I paid for the donuts, my brother paid for the Starbucks, we each got our own things from Ross, I paid for HMart (stuff for all of us), and my brother and I went 50/50 on the tacos. After some searching, we had decided on Max's donuts in Allen, and *I cannot recommend it enough*. It closes really early so we barely made it, but the donuts were fluffy and totally worth it. I literally bought 6 donuts for about $8, what type of incredible steal is that?? We spent over an hour at Ross, I found a cute hoodie and some work pants ($30). When we came out, my sister and I spotted TJMaxx next door and wanted to hit it, but my brother was fed up with our shopping shenanigans (somehow we were in Ross for like an hour and a half), so we went to get tacos instead. I paid for half the food ($13). HMart was next door and we went wild, we basically just got a bunch of tteokbokki and somehow it was $87. I love a good grocery store visit. Daily total: $138

8/31: My sister and I decided to head home on Sunday so that we had Monday in our apartment before the week began. She wanted to see her boyfriend, I wanted to gather my energy to power through the next week. We binge watched like 40 episodes of Reincarnated as a Slime over the weekend, which was awesome. My sister hadn't watched anime in a long time, so it was especially funny to watch her react. On the way back, my sister filled up the tank and I got us some drinks - $4 McDonald's pumpkin beverage for her, and $20 for 3 boba teas. I am not really a pumpkin person (controversial, I know). We went to OneZo since I recognized the name as a chain I had been to in Boston. I did not remember unfortunately that it was a place I didn't like. The matcha wasn't blended smoothly, it was chalky, and the strawberry milk tea wasn't good either. We were really cranky that we added 20+ minutes to our trip from stopping there! We barely resisted stopping at another Ross before heading home. Daily total: $24

9/1: My sister ordered a Walmart pickup order and spent $190, so I went to pick it up. For our grocery setup: she generally buys almost all of our proteins and a bunch of other stuff for the upcoming month in one big order, and then picks up some snacks, etc, throughout the month. Then I buy whatever else we need (milk, eggs, veggies, etc) throughout the month. My sister had to go out and out today, since she gets ansty when she's had too much couch rotting, lol, and she thinks we did way too much of that in Dallas. I went on a walk and spent most of the rest of the day reading the webnovel I've been on. I ended up finishing it. In the evening, my sister cooked dinner, with enough leftover for lunches tomorrow, and also meal prepped a ton of breakfasts for us and for her boyfriend. She's a really good cook, I definitely feel lucky to be able to enjoy her food. I'm a good cook too, at least, I used to be before I started working. I cooked a ton in undergrad and grad school, then less last year, and now I barely cook at all. I also worked briefly on the short story that I'm writing. My creative energy, when it comes in, tends to do so right when I'm supposed to be going to bed. Nothing feels the same as pacing in laps around the block at 11pm-ish while typing maniacally into Google Docs. Daily total: $0

Trip total (although maybe I should've grouped Friday into this section rather than with the regular week): Shopping ($30) + Restaurants/Teas and Coffees/Takeout ($45) + Asian market/Grocery store ($87) = $162. I was aiming to stay under $200 on this trip, so it's probably good that we didn't go into TJMaxx.",2,1757100208.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,1,0.75,False

I've currently gotten back into the high life that is full time employment (sarcasm) and due to the nature of my job, it involves a lot of travelling, time away from family and also a constant pace that requires many hours working and less for my free time. 

However, in the free time I do have, I love to read. Its one of the few rare escapes I find in my life and the pleasure of engrossing myself in a world or character that captivates me is unlike any feeling I've felt. 

Anyways, hello. 

I'm looking for someone to generally chat about literature with. Someone who is enthusiastic and talktive. I find that talking about the books we read and gushing about characters and story archs helps cement our own enjoyment.

The genres I've been reading lately are definitely Sci Fi, Fantasy and Romance (I know, guilty pleasure as a guy) along with some horror on the side.

I'm open to book recommendations too as well as perhaps picking a book to read and reading it together in our own time then discussing a chapter we've read or something along those lines. In any case, a reading buddy would be greatly appreciated to help me focus, prevent a slump and captivate my passion for literature. 

I've also been interested in exploring some romantasy which is a usual change of pace from my usual liking towards more epic fantasy tales. Also, anything with dark romance related undertones with gritty character arcs and vivid storytelling.

A little about me, aside from reading I'm an avid fitness enthusiast and I keep fit and excercise pretty regularly. A healthy body makes a healthy mind, as they say. I don't typically read in public, however I'm probably not someone you'd expect to be reading on a busy train or in a tucked away coffee shop (maybe you can change that). I'm keen to talk, though I am much better at listening and offering my own thoughts instead of yapping endlessly (though if you yap, that's more than fine by me)

If you're interested in chatting, feel free to reach out and I'd be more than happy to talk.",1,1757100136.0,Book_Buddies,0,1.0,False

1n9eezm,https://v.redd.it/57m6j18pcenf1,To everyone in this industry.,"To my fellow BOH and FOH warriors,

As the year is coming to an end and the push gets heavier, I just want to take a moment to speak about the hidden battles that many of us carry behind the pass and the service smile.

If you’re fighting something beneath the surface,  whether it’s burnout, loneliness, or darker thoughts . Know that you’re not alone. You are more than the tickets on the rail, more than the covers in a night, more than the role you play during service.

The end-of-year rush is brutal, but your health, your heart, and your mind matter more than any guest’s approval or any manager’s praise. Please take care of yourselves and look out for each other. If you notice a colleague struggling, even a small word or gesture can mean the world.

To everyone in this industry.  You are seen, you are valued, and the world is better with you in it. 

Stay strong, stay kind, and don’t forget  you’re human before you’re chef, service, steward or a bartender. Dont be a dick like Tony leaving us like that. Im joking i love that mf he was my inspiration to become who i am today. 

To FOH keep giving us coffee and drinks, to BOH like me keep feeding our front liners.

1n9eejq,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1n9eejq/years_ago_my_mother_was_asked_to_write_a/,"Years ago, my mother was asked to write a biography, so that coworkers could know her better. I know it is a tad bit long, but the following is my mother story.","I was born in the hospital on Pensacola, Naval Air Station, Pensacola, Florida at the end of World War II. Where was I raised? Everywhere. Where did I go to school? Everywhere.

My father was a Navy operator attached to the consult in Fuochow, China. My mother taught Chinese children in Ingtai. There they met and were married in January 21, 1941. Not long after, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. The consulate in Foochow evacuated. The teachers took the children and walked 300 miles to Chung King. From there, my mother flew over the Himalayan mountains to India, boarded a ship and sailed around the horn and through the Panama Canal, where Navy ships took over.

My father was soon transferred to the naval base in New Orleans, then to Bethesda, Maryland and Washington, D. C. Eventually, we flew across the Atlantic ocean to Naples, Italy, where my father became attached to NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization). Our education flourished.

We climb to the top of Mount Vesuvius, they appeared over the edge of Solfatara that bubbled steam and sulfur fumes. We learned Italian, swam in the water along the Amalfi coast and visited the remains of Pompeii. 

Our next move was to Izmir, turkey. There we learned Turkish, and drove through Syria, Lebanon, Damascus, Israel, and Egypt. Eventually, we left Turkey and landed at Athens, Greece. From there, we took a train to Rome, then drove through Switzerland in Germany and flew back to the US. Did we enjoy it? Definitely. Would we do it again? Perhaps.

Moving on, I met my husband, Ed, by chance. We met at my brother's wedding and went for coffee afterwards. I don't recall how long we talked, but we were very much the same. We enjoyed the same things, especially classical music. Two years later, we married and have been together for 56 years. We have three children, all who have had a world education. Our eldest was born in the US. Our second daughter was born in Singapore. Our third daughter was born in Norway. From there, the family moved to Dubai and came back to the US six years later.

We have three grandchildren (one of whom is a Tactical Corpsman in the Navy – – go Navy!) and two great grandchildren.

Work background? You name it i've done it. Flying T – 34 planes, singing high Sopranos with Barry Scott Williamson, playing the guitar and piano, writing, figure skating, baking and decorating birthday and wedding cakes, teaching swimming and diving for young and old, first aid, equestrian, baseball, writing, oral histories, and probably a few more that don't come to mind at the moment.

We came to Georgetown, Texas on November 11, 2011 and have lived here ever since. 
I graduated from GPA class on May 28, 2015. As a volunteer for the city of Georgetown Police Department, I wrote the silver shields manual, worked in reception, helped with seasonal decorations, worked with young people who want to learn about police and fire, and a variety of other tasks. I very much enjoyed my volunteer work.

Spare time? What is that? 

This is the end of the biography that my mother wrote, I am the eldest daughter , the one who cared for her at home as long as possible, and ultimately was the one who had to place her in memory care in March of this year. All these beautiful memories my mother had are gone from her mind. My father has been looking for this biography to give to her Hospice team so that they could know her better and when I read it, I knew I had to share it here. If you have made it this far, I would love to hear about your loved ones Life and the beautiful memories that were in their mind once. as my family prepares for my mother's departure from this world, I wanted to remember most beautiful memories she has, and not how she is now with a vacant stare who only lightens up when my father walks in the room. Still the devoted husband, 56 years later.",4,1757100068.0,dementia,3,1.0,False
1n9eejk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n9eejk,Southern Italy and London Hotel reviews,"Just back from a fantastic two-week trip through Southern Italy and London and I wanted to share reviews of each hotel we stayed at. 

Huge thanks to Alex, who made coordinating this multi-city journey seamless-her quick responses and personal touches made it feel like we had a friend along for the ride!

Four Seasons Taormina – Sicily

Formerly the San Domenico Palace, this property began life as a 14th-century Dominican Monastery and still retains its cloisters and monks’ cells, now elegantly blended with modern luxury.

Arrival & Room:
We received a warm welcome, welcome drink and a tour of the property by the GM. The design of this hotel is outstanding, like being in a museum/art gallery with comfy areas to lounge. 

Our Deluxe Sea View Room with Terrace felt a little tight, but high ceilings, interesting artwork, and a marble bathroom gave it charm. The terrace made all the difference - we loved having our morning coffee or evening champagne overlooking the Mediterranean. A highlight: the welcome amenity was a chocolate replica of Taormina’s Greek Theater.

Dining & Drinks:
Dinner at Anciovi, the hotel’s casual seafood restaurant, was lively and delicious. Afterward, we discovered Bar & Chiostro, set in a 15th-century colonnade, within the hotel’s open air garden, with live music every night - it became our favorite hangout. Breakfast was a showstopper: panoramic views of Mt. Etna, a dedicated pastry-and-granita room, (so yummy) and attentive service. The only downside: the bees and heat made dining on the terrace uncomfortable, even though the views were unforgettable. By day three we ate inside.

Location & Experiences:
The hotel sits right in Taormina’s heart, so wandering into town is effortless. The streets are charming, full of shops, restaurants, street musicians, art and stunning viewpoints. We loved finding little spots for pizza or drinks. The hotel concierge recommended some really wonderful places as well. 

The concierge team deserves special mention bc they were outstanding. One day, when our self-booked boat tour nearly went awry due to a wrong dock address, the concierge jumped into action, securing a taxi and getting us to the right spot just in time. The tour itself (with Excursioni Pizzichella) ended up being a highlight, with dramatic coastline views and a fun, relaxed vibe.

We also booked a vintage Fiat tour of Taormina and Castelmola through the hotel, and it was wonderful. Our guide, Salvatore, was incredibly knowledgeable and personable, giving us a deeper appreciation of the area’s history and culture.

Spa & Pool:
The outdoor pool was beautiful but short on loungers, pushing us to a far-off seating area. That said, thoughtful touches like poolside hats, sunscreen, and granitas helped. We ended up enjoying the indoor pool at the spa, which was a nice option.

Overall:
A magical stay. Rooms run small, so spring for a terrace. You won’t miss the lack of a sandy beach because nearby options are rocky anyway.

Masseria Torre Maizza – Puglia

A Rocco Forte gem, this 16th-century masseria has been beautifully restored. Whitewashed walls, bougainvillea-draped walkways, and surrounding olive groves make it feel like stepping onto a movie set.

Arrival & Room:
We were welcomed warmly, with our concierge Fortunato reconfirming excursions and even arranging a complimentary boat tour. Thanks to Alex, we were upgraded to a huge suite with a plunge pool- complete with a small yard and loungers. It felt more like a private villa than a hotel room.

Dining:
The food here impressed. Carosello, the main restaurant, served a first-night dinner poolside with live music. We also enjoyed the rooftop bar, pool terrace, and the beach club, Lido Bambu. Only miss: a disappointing lobster roll by the pool. Insider tip: join Rocco Forte Friends for 15% off food and drinks.

Location:
Set in Fasano, there’s nothing walkable nearby, and taxis are unreliable. Renting a car or hiring a driver is essential. The concierge team was excellent in arranging transport for our day trips.

Cons:
The complimentary boat tour was a letdown-rough seas and little scenery compared to Sicily’s dramatic coastline. We returned drenched. Hotel communication could be inconsistent, too. For example, the spa did not respond to my question until the end of the day. Also, I was told there’d be a mixology class on a day that was raining but never given the time. They said they’d update me but they never did. When I reached out again I found out it had been cancelled, not a big deal because we booked a last minute day trip. I do wish all hotels would adopt the app messaging that they use at the Four Seasons.

Overall:
A gorgeous, relaxing base with fantastic food and design. Just be ready to plan excursions and transportation if you want to explore the area.

Claridge’s – London

After Puglia’s rustic charm, stepping into Claridge’s felt like entering another world of glittering chandeliers, polished marble, and Art Deco glamour. Tucked on a side street in Mayfair, it’s perfectly placed for shopping and dining.

Arrival & Room:
We were greeted by top-hatted doormen and given a hotel tour before being whisked to our King Superior Room. Stylish and comfortable, it included modern luxuries like a Dyson hairdryer and motorized curtains, plus an unexpected delight: a framed photo from our Fiat tour in Sicily! I’d sent the picture to Alex, who arranged for Claridge’s to place it on our nightstand - a personal touch that meant so much.

Dining & Service:
Service here was impeccable. Breakfast in the main dining room was a highlight, with a pastry cart and servers who remembered our orders. Over two days, we managed to enjoy Claridge’s Bar, the Fumoir Champagne Bar, Dante (a restaurant pop-up), and the main restaurant. Sadly, time didn’t allow for afternoon tea.

Overall:
Our two-night stay was luxurious, pampering, and memorable. Everyone knew our names and couldn’t have been nicer. Only drawback: our room overlooked an interior atrium, which felt a bit dreary. Request a city view if you can.

Happy to answer any questions!

And going on month 3 of RETA (just hit 2MGs every 5 days)

Side effects from reta:

Minor Arrhythmia (in the beginning, seems to have completely subsided)
Mental clarity/more energy
Increase in anxiety/panic attacks (I have panic attacks quite frequently)
Less need for coffee, but my body started craving nicotine after having quit it
Down 15 pounds 
Major bodily fatigue, decreased desire for gym or day to day activity
My body just feels “off”, I feel like shit a lot of the time tbh. 
Constipation/hard/bloody stool (fixed with fiber intake)

I am going to attribute this to maybe the calorie restriction however I have been taking my electrolytes daily as well as magnesium glycinate and fiber 

However, I will say the reta is doing its job.. i
Think the side effects will be worth it once I lose what I need to lose (I am at 190 LBS, 6’0, mid twenties) 

KLOW:
No side effects yet. I think I felt a burst of energy when I first took it but could be 100% placebo. No stinging at injection site with 3ml bac water reconstitution. Not sure if I should expect any side effects at all here ?

Please, share your story below if you are on a similar stack! Want peoples thoughts on mitigating sides

1n9e996,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1n9e996/crossing_paths_after_2_years/,Crossing paths after 2 years.,"Hi fellow INFJs ! My previous post 2 years ago talked about how I was rejected by this awesome INFJ girl on her last day of work before moving on to her new sales job. Looking back on it now, turns out that I put her on a spotlight and on a pedestal, when I myself wasn't sure of my own feelings back then. As mentioned, we did get to share our deepest values, our plans and visions for each of our futures.

We talked for another 2 months after she left, but then I thought it'd be better if I distance myself from her as I only want what's best for her and her future and not let myself be a distraction to her. So I decided to move on and start meeting other people. It was a bit of hit & miss lol. Throughout these 2 years I worked on myself, exercise building up muscles, losing weight as much as 13Kgs, jogging, moving to a better company with better salary and etc. So recently in July, my work office got relocated to her building (but different floors), I knew this as she had once told me thru text that she was working there, I even confirmed this through her work social media account before deciding to text her.

So I texted her that I'm moving to her place. She was initially surprised why I was suddenly looking for her after all this time lol. Then she got excited and initiated a lunch out with her alone. I was honestly surprised as she rarely initiated things with anyone, let alone me who hasn't contacted her for a while, but then I thought 'Okay, let's go !'

It was a great experience, we managed to catch up. We initially planned to just only have lunch, but then after that she wanted us to have coffee afterwards just when her lunch hour was about to be over lol. She opened up about what loneliness and struggles she went through after leaving the previous company we worked on together. She asked me with this weird sad face whether I still remember the deepest things that she shared with me, I was like 'Of course I remember !', and her sweet smile lit up her face again lol.

Both of us have grown as people since the last time we met. We now appreciate each other more for giving that extra boost in motivation in being the best version of ourselves. We're now more emotionally expressive in each other texts, plus with a bit of playful banter. Once in a while, she'd ask me for space and told she's happy to catch up with me again. And I'll be like okay with it and go on for a few days or weeks without us contacting each other. It feels great without us having to put on masks and performing being fictional characters. This initial excitement/euphoria gradually turned to calm and sereneness as time goes by. I currently don't have this feeling or obligation of constantly of having to check up on her daily what she's doing or how is she and etc. I understand that'd be overstimulating and overbearing to her.

I now remember her almost every moment of my daily life. It just has this calming effect that I never experienced before and it has no negative effects on my work performance and emotional and mental well-being. In fact, my family and colleagues have noticed I'm more energetic now, I smile more often, more optimistic about life, expressing appreciation towards everyone more often and etc.

And keep in mind, this is all currently happening without us having to constantly communicate with each other. So, what does the future currently hold for me? idk lol. Life is a long journey after all, and I'm currently excited and chill at the same time to be on it. If it's meant to be, it will be.

So yeah, I appreciate you all for reading this long text lol.

1n9e8xg,https://www.reddit.com/r/estatesales/comments/1n9e8xg/i_was_just_really_snippy_to_an_estate_sale_guy/,I was just really snippy to an estate sale guy and here's why,"I had some time between work calls and decided to go hit an estate sale about 10 minutes from my house.  Got there at around 12:30 -- it had opened at 10.  Today's the first day.  It was an older house that clearly is going to be torn down.  No organization whatsoever in the inside -- more of a messy semi-hoarder type situation.  No problem -- I love those.  You never know what you're going to find.  Most items had no prices on them.

I went through the house and found maybe 10-15 things I liked and headed down to the cash register to pay.  There was a line.  The man working the register was working the sale alone -- there were no other people from his company there.  He was talking to the person who was first in line and they were haggling over the price of a coffee table.  I was fourth back.

He talked and talked and talked.  We're all milling around and the line is getting longer.  Finally, he finishes with the guy and moves on to the next person.  As he went through that guy's stuff, he commented on each item-- ""Wow, this is neat!"" and ""I hadn't seen this!"".  Time consuming, to say the least.

The next guy got up to the register and bought his books (which were supposed to be $1-2 each, but all of his were $3 for some reason).  Then it was my turn.

He starts chatting with me.  I'm snippy, only because this is taking FAR longer than it should AND I have a call coming up soon and need to get back home and I really don't have time for pleasantries.  As he goes through my items he comments on each one, telling me, ""Did you see the mark on this piece?"" and ""These were made in Denmark - so cool.""  My answers to those things were mostly, ""Yes"" and ""I know"".  

Finally he adds up my total ($45) and I say, ""Do you take Venmo?"" and he says yes.  Then he starts looking for his phone.  He can't find it.  ""My wife is going to kill me,"" he says.  He eventually locates it and shows me a screenshot of a QR code which isn't Venmo - it's Zelle.  ""I'm sorry.  This is Zelle.  I don't really know the difference,"" he confesses.  So I scan the QR code, but it doesn't take me to the payment page.  It takes me somewhere completely different.  ""It doesn't work,"" I tell him.  ""Can you look it up by my wife's phone number or email?"" he says.  ""Fine.  What are they?"" I respond.  He shows me a piece of paper.  I look up the phone number.  It's not registered with Zelle.  Nor is the email.  

""How about Paypal?"" he says.  ""Fine,"" I respond.  He shows me a piece of paper with a Paypal address.  I type it in.  As I am typing, he is telling everyone who will listen that he should know about how ""technology works"" because he was a ""mainframe programmer"" before he did estate sales, and he's been doing estate sales since the 80s.  Then he confesses that for some previous sale, he lost $5000 from a cash box because he turned around and the money disappeared.  All of this was in earshot of everyone standing in the room waiting to check out.

I finally found the company on Paypal and made payment, even though the paper he showed me said ""MAKE THE PAYMENT AS FRIENDS AND FAMILY"" and mine went through as Goods and Services.  I just wanted to get out of there and get back for my call.

I have no plans to attend any more sales run by these folks-- I found them unprofessional and inefficient.  For a company that's supposed to be making money for their clients, they sure didn't know how to do that.  And I'm sorry if I was snippy to the guy.  I live in the DC metro area and we have LOTS of sales to choose from, just like people who need estate sale companies have LOTS of companies to choose from.  I was thoroughly unimpressed with this company.  I don't think they're doing right by the folks who hired them.

Thanks for reading my rant :-)

1n9e8pu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskARussian/comments/1n9e8pu/how_is_it_to_search_for_a_job/,How is it to search for a job?,"I’m genuinely curious, what is the job hunting and recruitment process like in Russia, at least before the 2022 Ukraine war (of course, excluding the recent tendency to hire foreign workers as qualified specialists due to recent labour shortages as part of the war, the largest individual groups besides Central Asians being from China, India, Serbia and Turkey)?

In many “First-world countries” (especially in the EU and North America), job hunting often feels like a slow-motion train wreck, where you got stories like:

**1.** You apply to like 50 jobs, get ghosted by 48, failed one interview with no feedback, and finally one rejection email arrives three months later just to ruin your day.

**2.** Job descriptions ask for an “entry-level"" candidate with 1–5 years of experience **minimum**, plus mastery of everything from C++ to brewing artisanal coffee.

**3.** No decent filters for experience level, so you waste time scrolling through jobs you're either likely underqualified or massively overqualified for.

**4.** Recruiters often have no idea what the job actually involves, but they do know how to copy-paste your name into a generic rejection email.

So, my questions for anyone familiar with the job market over there:

**1.** Was it just as painful in Russia, at least before 2022, or did you guys have some not so talked about advantages like better experience filtering, faster rejections, or recruiters who actually read your CV?

**2.** Is ghosting normal there, or do companies at least pretend to care about yout time?

**3.** Did the whole process feel slightly more human, or is it just a universal illusion that companies appreciate applicants?

**Important note:** I’m not thinking about moving to Russia (unless I somehow pull a PewDiePie and meet my Marzia equivalent from Russia girlfriend online, I'm in my mid 20s, btw). I’m just genuinely curious if job hunting there has been radically different, better, or simply the same soul-crushing experience in another language.

*  Reels like: “Hey guys, come to this new café. I had a burger here once, now I’m spiritually connected to it.”
*  Promoting events no one asked for: 
*  Getting free stuff in exchange for shouting into their phones in public like:*“Hey guys, this is your girl Rinku here, I’m at Bilaspur, trying out their legendary Chocolate Golgappa with Oreo Chutney!”*

Meron kaming malalaking cliente inaasikaso namin ung VAT Refund nila. Kinukuha namin ung mga resibo ng services,goods, expenses etc ng company

Yung boss ko 15 employees lang ang ginagawa nyang regular tapos ung iba part timers ang ginagawa nya. Bakit? para di sya magbayad ng sss, pag-ibig, philhealth ng employee. Part timer pero 8-5PM ang pasok may OT pa minsan overnight pa lalo na pag deadline. Ang kupal diba? Nag tataka pa ako dati kasi ang label is employee & part timer. 
May tawag pa sya sa isang dept. Curring Department kuno daw pero 5 lng sila 😂 Curring kasi dinodoctor nila ung mga resibo sa photoshop.

How does the corruption works? Para mapabilis ang pagkuha ng checke or claims ng isang company madaming BIR Officials ang nilalagyan ng boss ko. Kapag valentines day lahat ng department binibigyan namin ng flowers. Kapag mothers day at pasko lahat yan sila may regalo. Partida may nakapaskil sa mga pinto nila na “NO GIFTS ALLOWED” hindi lang basta basta regalo. Delongi coffee maker, LV Bag, Hermes, Mamahaling alak depende sa position or pakinabang mo sa company namin. 

Yung sinasabi ni Mayor Magalong na Room Vault? Totoo yun. May mga department head or examiner na ganon. Minsan monthly kami nagdadala ng pera sa mga bahay nila. Kapag 1M naka expanding envelope ung mga katulong ang nag rereceive. Minsan malemaleta ang dinidilever na pera. Sa small luggage 18-20million ang kasya sa large parang nasa 50milliion. Maleta namin dinideliver sa BIR tapos kinukuha nila sa parking or sa malapit sa bahay nila. Driver to driver lang ang abutan. Sobrang daming bribes ang binibigay ng boss ko merong kotse,concert tickets, condo lahat ng materials things named it. 

Kapag maliit ka na tao at kakalabanin mo sila or eexpose mo baka malagay ka na din sa maleta. Habang nag dedeliver ako ng pera or materials things sa knila iniisip ko Lord ano kaya magiging sakit ng mga to, yun bang may pera sila pero hindi na sila mapagamot ng pera nila? Sobrang mga ganid. 
 
I feel hopeless for the Philippines. Pero sa mga nangyayari ngayon parang nagkakaroon ng liwanag, na eexpose na sila wag tayong mapagod. Again hindi lang sa DPWH ang may corruption pati sa BIR at iba pang department ng govt. ng pinas. Pati local banks din pala kasali 😂 may manager kami ng bank na kasama sa payroll 100k a month. Kaya di na namin need pumila pag kukuha ng pera pag mag eencash kami kahit cut off na nakakakuha kami.  

Tinignan ko yung mga FB ng BIR Employees Examiner and Bank Managers naka private at naka hide na lahat ng mga travel photos nila parang every quarter nag aabroad sila mga mamahaling gamit. Natatakot na siguro ma expose kaya naglilow na mag post.

1n9e1u3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1n9e1u3/should_you_trust_the_samsung_da2920b_refrigerator/,Should You Trust the Samsung DA29-20B Refrigerator Water Filter Review for Your Home?,"The **Samsung DA29-20b** water filter is an addition to my kitchen appliances that I've grown kind of attached to over the weeks. I mean, who wouldn’t appreciate fresh, crisp water that tastes pure, free from chlorine and other unwanted chemicals? While there’s a lot to love about this product, it's not without its quirks. Allow me to dive into the details of what I’ve observed while testing this little gadget daily.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This filter might not be the most exciting thing in the world to look at, but its compact and functional design fits effortlessly into my refrigerator. Made with high-grade carbon material, the structure feels robust and durable. As for the installation, it’s nearly idiot-proof. I didn't even have to pull out a manual or YouTube a tutorial. It literally twists into place, which is a relief because I’m no certified handyman. Though it works perfectly, it does feel slightly on the lighter side, making me wonder if it could snap under rough handling.

**Ease of Installation and Use**  
You’ll really appreciate how simple the setup process is with this product. It took less than five minutes to get it up and running. There’s no mess, no tools needed—just twist off, twist on, and done. My mom, who honestly feels lost setting up even the simplest things, managed to replace it herself in one try. However, a small hiccup is that the product doesn’t come with detailed instructions in the packaging. While installation for me was a breeze, I imagine someone unfamiliar with these filters might feel a bit confused without proper guidance.

**Performance and Filtration Efficacy**  
Here’s where the product shines. The water taste? Spotless. It uses a high-grade carbon block to eliminate over 99% of contaminants, such as chlorine and toxic chemicals, and has made me notice a significant improvement in water freshness. For someone like me who’s picky about aftertastes, this filter has done miracles. I’ve also been using this same water for my coffee machine, and somehow, it’s made my blond roast brews more enjoyable. That said, I can’t scientifically prove the 99% removal rate, but based on taste and appearance, it’s doing its job.

**Favorable Attributes**  
- The filter lasts an impressive six months or around 300 gallons, barring heavy usage.  
- Provides cleaner, safer, and better-tasting water by blocking chlorine and particulates.  
- Installation takes just a few minutes—user-friendly and frustration-free.  

**Critiques**  
- No installation instructions inside the box could leave some users guessing.  
- The lighter feel of the material made me question its long-term durability.  

**Replacement Frequency and Longevity**  
After a month of consistent use, I checked how the performance holds up, and it still seems just as effective as day one. Samsung recommends replacements every six months or after filtering 300 gallons. If you’re anything like me, keeping track of filters is a chore, but I set a reminder on my calendar to avoid post-six-month surprises.

**Industry Competitors**  
Let’s take a quick look at how this stacks up against other popular brands. A competitor like the Brita has its own strengths, offering similar filtration quality but normally at a steeper price point. Meanwhile, the EveryDrop filters come with a similar 300-gallon capacity and are excellent performers but tend to take longer to ship from what I’ve observed. This Samsung option seems like the perfect middle ground—competitively priced while also delivering great features. However, some reviewers mentioned that generic off-brand filters are cheaper. Still, based on my experience, paying for Samsung’s NSF-certified quality is worth the splurge.

**Smart Spending**  
It’s easy to fall into the cycle of buying the cheapest filter options available, but think of this as a long-term investment for quality water. Over time, the price-to-performance ratio makes sense to me because I know I’m drinking water free of extra contaminants that lower-grade filters might not catch. It's not the most affordable solution on the market, but the longevity and filtration efficiency balance the premium price tag.

1n9e0zx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1n9e0zx/theres_an_app_where_strangers_follow_your_every/,There’s an app where strangers follow your every command. I tried to stop it.,"One day, I stumbled upon the app.
I was just messing around on my phone, bored out of my mind one afternoon. Scrolling through every bit of nonsense that popped up. That’s when I saw it, this weird little app buried among the others. Its oddly eye-catching icon instantly grabbed my attention. But when I opened it… things got even stranger.
The app looked like TikTok. People appeared in the videos, but every single one was labeled as live. At least, that’s what it claimed. Most of the people in the videos were just… waiting. Like they were preparing for something, or expecting something to happen. It all seemed pretty boring at first, until the comments started rolling in.

I was watching a guy, his whole room was covered in cameras. But he was just sitting there on his couch, doing nothing. Just staring into space, like he was waiting. Then someone dropped a comment:


“Stand up and grab a glass of water.”


And the guy, on live video, followed the command. Instantly. Like it wasn’t even a choice, just something he had to do. It was weird, especially because he didn’t look at his phone or a screen or anything. He just… knew what to do. I stared at my phone screen, squinting in disbelief.
Then another viewer joined the stream. Now there were three of us watching this young guy walk into the kitchen and pour himself a glass of water. But once he did, he just stood there. He didn’t drink it. Didn’t spill it. Just stood in the kitchen, holding the glass.

Then another comment popped up:


“A dog runs in, and you spill the water.”


Suddenly, in the live feed, a small mutt dashed past the guy’s legs and bumped into him. He flinched, and the water splashed out of the glass.

I couldn’t make sense of it. What was this app? What were these people doing? Why was everyone acting so… strange?

Still, I kept watching. Curiosity got the better of me. Eventually, I decided to join in, just with something harmless:


“Make a sandwich.”


And the guy? He opened the fridge and started making one. Like he had no choice.
I was stunned. What kind of twisted thing was this? These people on the app were doing everything they were told. Who in their right mind would ever agree to something like this?


I watched as the guy made himself a pretty decent sandwich. A strange mix of feelings swirled inside me. It was unsettling, someone taking comments as commands. And at the same time, it felt like I was playing The Sims.
When he finished the sandwich, I was just about to type “Eat it” when another viewer beat me to it:


“Shove the sandwich up your ass.”


I winced at the comment. When I looked back at the stream, the guy was already taking off his pants.

I have never scrolled away from a video faster in my life.

What the actual fuck is this? And why are people such absolute pieces of shit?

I clicked into another stream. This time, it was a woman painting her room. It all seemed calm, until I looked closer at what she was painting with.
It was her own feces. The last comment confirmed it, followed by a flood of laughing emojis.

That’s when I just… gave up.
I scrolled through a few more, hoping not to lose all faith in humanity, but it only got worse.
It was early evening, prime time for these so-called “live robots,” and the app was swarming with lunatics.
People were giving the most deranged, vile commands to these poor souls.
In just a few minutes, I saw everything, From sadomasochistic porn to self-harm to full-on violent abuse, All carried out by strangers, to strangers.

It was a plague. A festering, digital hell. And I thought: That’s enough internet for today.


The next day, I couldn’t stop thinking about the horrors I’d seen.
Even if some of these people chose to be in this situation, or were forced into it, why did the viewers always have to ask for the worst possible things?
It was like some sick joke from the dark web.

The best I could think to do was to report the app, anonymously, to the police. I sent everything I had, hoping they’d be able to do something with it. But in the meantime, I figured I’d keep watch. Maybe I could help the people still trapped inside.

So I started leaving harmless comments, anything to prevent bloodshed. I hoped I could make a difference. Maybe offer some kind of peace to these poor souls. That afternoon, after I got home from work and finished my usual chores, I sat down and opened the app again.

Luckily, not many people were online yet. A few random viewers were lurking, and most of the streamers were just waiting, Sitting or lying in their rooms, motionless, staring into nothing, waiting for the next command.
But that gave me the perfect chance to launch my sabotage plan.
My idea was simple:
I’d give as many of them as possible long, complicated tasks, Ones that would keep them busy during the “danger hours,” when viewer numbers tend to spike and things usually go to hell.

So I started typing.

- I told them to clean the entire room with a toothbrush until everything sparkled.
- To master the guitar, perfectly.
- To cook a four-course meal for a crew of twenty, each dish different.

Anything I could think of to keep them occupied. To protect them from what was coming.
It was working…Until the viewer count started to rise.


What I didn’t count on was that the other viewers would twist all my commands.
The guy I told to bake something? He was now hacking other people to pieces with an axe.
Another was slicing open his own abdomen. The rest, I didn’t even want to look anymore.

I tried fighting back against some of the commenters. Every time someone posted some sick, twisted suggestion, I would instantly reply with something safe, something that wouldn’t let the person on stream hurt themselves or anyone else.
But I couldn’t keep up for long. It was like every stream was flooded with commands, orders to mutilate themselves or torture others.

The whole app was a fucking cesspool again.

I just collapsed into bed, exhausted. My soul felt crushed by everything I’d seen, and by the fact that most of the commenters were absolute monsters. They were making these people do things no sane person would ever think of. Just thinking about it made me sick.
This was happening every day, on this app.

I barely slept that night. And the next day?
I don’t even want to talk about it.

Those faces burned themselves into my mind. The torture. The perversions. The constant stream of twisted orders pouring in from strangers.

Even at work, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. How could I stop this? How could I at least help somehow, until the police finally did something?

Back home, whenever I had a free moment, I opened the app again.
My new plan was simple: If I couldn’t protect everyone, I’d focus on just one person.
Let me save one person. Just for a night.
I hoped I’d be able to.


What I didn’t expect… was who the app showed me when I opened it.

It was a young girl.
She was sitting in a simple living room, wearing a college hoodie. Cameras were filming her from almost every angle.
As I glanced at the comment section, a message immediately popped up. It was from a user named cherrydelry.
But the message wasn’t addressed to the girl,it was for me.


“Please don’t hurt her. I’m begging you. She didn’t do anything wrong. Just move on, find someone else. She’s my daughter.”


I was completely shocked.
That was the moment the whole thing hit me, really hit me. These people I’d been watching suffer for two days straight… they were real. They were once just normal people.
Then another message popped up, again from Cherry, directed at me:


“Please. I’m begging you. Don’t give her any commands. Please.”


I quickly replied, hoping to ease her panic:


“I won’t write anything. Don’t worry. I think this whole thing is horrible too.”


I never thought I’d find a kindred soul here of all places. But it turned out that cherrydelry was actually the mother of the girl I was now watching live.

Her daughter had gone missing months ago. No one had found her, not the police, not the locals, no trace, nothing. Then, one day, Cherry found her daughter’s phone. And on it… this app.
That’s when she discovered her daughter had a profile and was already part of the livestream.
It was all just… horrifying.

Cherry and I talked a lot in the chat. We agreed not to reveal anything personal about ourselves, just in case someone was watching.
Whenever someone joined her daughter’s livestream, we attacked the chat immediately, flooding it with harmless commands, so nothing awful could happen to her.

For the first time in days, I felt like I’d done something good. Together, we managed to protect a young girl.

Cherry told me she watched her daughter almost all day. She’d already shown the footage to the police, but they didn’t really believe her. All they said was “We’ve opened an investigation.” Bastards.
Cherry and I made a pact, I would help protect her daughter too. Together, we’d try to keep her alive until someone in law enforcement finally took action.
I’d never done anything like this before, but I followed Cherry’s daughter’s profile in the app.

I had to keep an eye on her.


The next day, Cherry and I were successful again.
We took turns watching over her.
A few lunatics jumped into the stream and immediately started flooding the chat with commands, telling the girl to do all sorts of things to herself, but luckily, we shut them down in time.

But how long are we supposed to keep doing this? The people who should really be shutting this whole thing down, why aren’t they doing anything? Maybe… maybe it’s time to go to the media?
I talked a lot with Cherry, too. She told me a few things about her daughter. She got into college on a gymnastics scholarship. Super smart girl, just spent a little too much time on her phone instead of studying.

Cherry also talked a little bit about herself, though only in broad strokes, just enough to avoid giving away anything that could cause trouble later.
Honestly, I didn’t always trust her either… but she was protecting the girl, same as I was.
So maybe I could trust a mother who was willing to do anything to protect her daughter.

Cherry offered to stay up late and keep watch. She said she didn’t have anything better to do anyway. I, on the other hand, was completely exhausted, especially at 4 a.m., knowing I had to work in the morning.

So I went to bed for a few hours. All my energy had been drained trying to keep the girl safe.
I slept like a rock, after two nights of staying up that long, I was totally worn out.

But in the morning…I woke up to a surprise.


Before heading out to work, I quickly opened the app to check on Cherry’s daughter.
But Cherry wasn’t there among the viewers. No one was watching her daughter.

Where did Cherry go? Maybe she just got tired… maybe she went to sleep?
I didn’t have time to dwell on it, I had to leave or I’d be late for work. So I rushed out the door.

But I would check the app again later during the day.
Just to be safe.


Cherry was offline the entire morning. She didn’t check on her daughter at all.
At work, I couldn’t really keep an eye on things, my boss wasn’t exactly a fan of people being on their phones during office hours.
But I faked stomach issues a few times just to slip off to the bathroom and check what was going on.
Thankfully, the girl mostly just stood or sat there, waiting.
But I had no idea what to do if Cherry didn’t come back. I didn’t think I could protect her daughter on my own.

What happened to Cherry? Where did she go? Was she just sleeping?

I practically ran home from work.
Cherry had been unreachable all day. And since it was Friday, more and more people were becoming active on the app.

I typed as fast as I could whenever someone entered the girl’s stream. I tried my best to protect her.
I’m sorry… but I couldn’t do it anymore.

By 9 p.m., there were so many people flooding Cherry’s daughter’s stream that it became impossible to keep things peaceful. They were sending her horrific messages.
I can’t say I was surprised. People like that, when they can control a twenty-year-old girl like a puppet, they always show their worst selves.

It was a nightmare. And my heart broke, but I left the stream.
I couldn’t keep watching this innocent young girl, with a blank face like a machine, carry out the most disgusting commands thrown at her.


That night, I just cried. Are people really this cruel when they get a little power over someone else?
As I was getting ready for bed, I checked the app one last time. Maybe something had changed. Maybe Cherry had come back. Maybe she was watching her daughter again.

But the girl’s stream was no longer available. She wasn’t even listed among my followed channels anymore.

There was only one thing that could mean: The girl was dead.
I couldn’t even cry anymore. These past few days had been a complete nightmare
since the moment I found that cursed app.
I sat on the edge of my bed, completely shattered. The app was still running on my phone, and the streams just kept rolling in, one horrifying scene after another.

Then, suddenly, my phone auto-launched a new live feed. It had a brand new label.

It showed an overweight man standing in the middle of his room in nothing but underwear.
The walls were covered with posters, disgusting ones, mostly of children.
But what truly shocked me…was the username.
The stream was being broadcast from an account named:

Cherrydelry.


It was him.
Cherry was visible on my profile again. But not like before, this time, I couldn’t message them anymore. Now they were the one in the livestream.

But… who the hell was that man?

Cherry was supposed to be a mother, at least that’s what they claimed. Someone trying to protect her daughter from a twisted online app.
My mind was in total chaos. What the actual fuck was going on here? Who lied to me?
What happened to Cherry? Or… was she ever real in the first place?

That’s when my phone buzzed. It was the app.

A cold sweat ran down my back, this had never happened before. I’d never gotten a notification from it.
When I checked it, I saw I had a message.
From the admin.


“Here’s your friend. Watch him, and do whatever you want. This is a private privilege, just for you. 24 hours.”


I was completely stunned.
Not just because the app admin had contacted me directly, but because Cherry had lied to me.

She wasn’t a mother. He was just some perverted freak who tried to claim a girl for himself, a girl who looked barely of age, through some grotesque, horrific app.

There are no words for what I felt sitting there on my bed. My entire world had flipped upside down.
And now, for a full day, this disgusting worm of a human was placed in my hands, entrusted to my good intentions.

Does someone like that deserve a terrible death?
Or should I just let someone else take care of the dirty work?


I just suffered until dawn.
I wandered the apartment, pacing. Then I tried to sleep, but the thoughts racing through my mind wouldn't let me rest.
Sometimes I glanced back at the fat man, the one who had pretended to be a desperate mother online.
Just the sight of him made my stomach turn. How many people had he deceived already?

And yet, he just stood there in his disgusting room.
Motionless. Like always. I felt betrayed. Lied to. Stupid.
How could I have been so fucking naive?
Disgusting worm.

And the worst part?
I helped him. I helped him trap a victim. I beat myself up over it for hours, but in the end, I felt like I deserved to be the one, to take revenge.

Cherry, or whatever the hell this thing was, was going to suffer anyway.
If not by my hand, then someone else’s. But someone would make him pay.
So I typed in the chat.
I kept it simple. Clear. Even for someone like him, surrounded by child porn posters on his walls, I gave him a dignified death.

Cherry reached down... and slit his own throat with a knife. He bled out right there on the floor of his filthy room.
The whole thing devastated me.
I think he deserved it. But was I really his killer?
I couldn’t decide. I just kept spiraling...until I finally fell asleep.


I woke up with a jolt.
The events from the night before were still gnawing at me. The moment I sat up in bed, my hand reached for my phone. I wanted to check the app.
But I couldn’t open it.
It was still on my phone, but when I tapped it, a message popped up:


“Access denied. Your account has been banned.”


Somehow... it was a relief. At last, I didn’t have access to that horror anymore. But it also pissed me off.
Why was I banned? Did they still want something from me?

The morning dragged on. I couldn’t focus on anything. It felt like my mind was somewhere else, not even in this world anymore.
I could barely eat. Sipped on coffee. Forced down a banana.
I told myself that after this nightmare of a week, this Saturday should just be a quiet day.
Stay home. Try to ease back into normal life.
That’s when my phone buzzed.
The app. The message was simple:


“The stream is starting.”


What stream? What the hell is this?

I opened the notification, and my phone slipped right out of my hand.
It was a livestream. Just like always.
But this time...it was my living room on the screen.

I stood there, in my pajamas. Staring at myself.
I was live now, too.",8,1757099173.0,nosleep,2,0.9,False
1n9e0yv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1n9e0yv/plan_for_helping_a_neighbour/,Plan for helping a neighbour 🥰,"Hi everyone!!! So I need help with smth please. I have a neighbour/ friend and she’s 25 yo. She has a daughter that is 7 and has to start school. Today I went to her apartment to drink coffee (we live in the same building) and she complained about not knowing how to buy a backpack and everything that her daughter needs for school. She has a husband that works as a driver but doesn’t earn really much. 
No I’m asking for advice because I want to help her, but there are some issues. 
1. I landed her money before but the issue is that I can’t offer to land her money because my bf found out on other occasions and he does not approve and gets mad. Just to be clear, I would use my own money, not his, but he still doesn’t approve because he thinks it’s irresponsible to do this and I don’t want to fight with him. He found out because her husband either thanked him/ returned him the money when he answered at the door, instead of returning them to me, so it’s too risky that landing her money will cause me problems with my bf again
2. My plan was maybe to go buy a backpack and school supplies and gift it to them, but then there’s a chance they could mention it when they see my bf in the hallway, so risky again. 
3. I could help but specifically tell them that my bf doesn’t have to know about this, but this will probably make them feel insulted and would make them sad, because it’s clear that my bf doesn’t trust them.

1n9e0ok,https://www.reddit.com/r/EndTippingCircleJerk/comments/1n9e0ok/the_momentum_is_building/,The momentum is building??!?,"u/cjk99876 posts here: https://www.reddit.com/r/EndTipping/s/wWblAsI6A5 about Americans “pushing back against excessive tipping culture” and thinking “the momentum is building” against tipping servers at full service restaurants in the US. 

Fun fact: The average tipping percentage at full service restaurants has increased in 2025 over Q4 2024. 

Tipping is down at the traditionally non-tipped situations like self serve yogurt, coffee shops, counter service, and the like. 

The average American with an IQ above room temperature understand that the “no tax on tips” isn’t going to move the needle for the overwhelming majority of servers, so it’s not affecting tipping at full service restaurants in the US. 

r/EndTipping members are so desperate for anything that might validate their narrative that they make posts like this without actually analyzing the information that is being presented. 

I’m against tip creep, but I’m also against pushing a false narrative.  

u/Lefty-18 also misconstrues the information, claiming “Need to keep this momentum. Servers are no longer ‘heroes’ from working during Covid”.  

u/cjk99876 add a comment with a link to foxbusiness.com, pretending it’s some kind of reputable data source when we all know that Fox is a proven biased platform that posts all sorts of misinformation and erroneous propaganda on a daily basis.  

u/Fireman16dye then claims “Maybe this is what we needed to push tipping off the table.” 

Maybe it will help with tip creep, but the data shows nothing is changing with tipping in traditionally tipped situations. There is NO momentum in changing tipping in that area.  

The only way you are going to effectuate change in traditionally tipped situations is to unite with ALL workers, including servers, to demand legislative changes like stronger worker protections, a minimum wage that is a livable wage, mandatory benefits for employees and government subsidized healthcare for all. 

Stiffing servers at full service restaurants in the UA does nothing to end tipping.  

Ironically, by doing this, you’re supporting and perpetuating tipping culture by supporting the owner and their business model, even if you stiff the server.  

The inability to understand this irrefutable fact about stiffing servers shows how moronic and hypocritical these r/EndTipping members are. 

What intelligent person supports and perpetuates the thing they claim to be against?

1n9dzlt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Substantial_Net_8311/comments/1n9dzlt/the_best_budget_laptop/,The Best Budget Laptop,"When people ask me for recommendations for the best budget laptop there’s only one answer that I give every single time: the [Lenovo ThinkPad T480](https://productbible.com/blog/best-budget-laptop#lenovo-thinkpad-t480). Yes, it’s an older model. But that’s exactly why it’s such a great deal today. I put together this little write up because I see this question asked often. I have two Thinkpad T480s of my own, one running Fedora Linux and the other running Windows 10. Its super cheap, dependable, and portable for travel. I use it as a secondary laptop when I need something basic and dependable, but don't want to lug around my 16in MacBook Pro.

One of the first things I noticed about the ThinkPad T480 is how ridiculously tough it feels. Mine has been tossed into backpacks, banged around on planes, and even survived a coffee spill, and it just keeps going. The magnesium-alloy chassis and spill-resistant keyboard make it feel like it was built for abuse. Compared to other laptops I’ve owned in the same price range, this thing really does feel like a tank.

Typing on it is honestly one of my favorite parts. I write a lot of emails and longer pieces, and the keyboard makes it easy to just keep going without my hands cramping up. The keys have a nice deep press with a solid click that feels better than almost any modern laptop I’ve tried. The little red TrackPoint joystick is still there too. I almost never use it, but it gives the keyboard its classic ThinkPad look.

The battery setup has saved me more than once. The T480 comes with an internal and a removable battery. I’ve swapped batteries mid-flight without losing my work, which felt like magic the first time I did it. With an extended battery, I was able to push over 15 hours of light use, something I never managed with newer ultrabooks that cost way more.

Ports are another area where this laptop makes life easy. I hate carrying dongles, and with this machine I never have to. It has USB-C charging, full HDMI, Ethernet, an SD card reader, and a couple of USB-A ports. I’ve hooked it up to projectors at conferences and external monitors at home without a single hiccup. The only caveat is the screen. If you buy one, make sure you get the 1080p version. I used one with the 1366x768 screen once and it felt cramped and washed out in comparison.

I run Linux on mine, and it works beautifully. Fedora installed cleanly and everything just worked out of the box. No random driver problems, no fan constantly spinning up, just smooth performance. On Linux the T480 feels much faster than on Windows, and the battery lasts longer too. For me, it turned into the perfect machine for coding and experimenting without wasting resources.

The best part about the T480 though is the value. I picked mine up refurbished on Amazon for around \$250, and it was in great condition. I’ve seen them go as low as \$150 if you are willing to shop around. The upgrade options are also a huge win. I added 32GB of RAM and swapped the hard drive for a larger NVMe SSD, which completely changed the way it felt. Knowing I can replace the screen, keyboard, or even the battery if something breaks makes me feel like I’ll be able to keep this laptop running for years.

At the end of the day, the [Lenovo ThinkPad T480](https://productbible.com/blog/best-budget-laptop#lenovo-thinkpad-t480) has been one of the most dependable laptops I’ve ever owned. It might not look flashy or modern, but it just does everything I need without complaints. Between the durability, the amazing keyboard, the swappable batteries, the wide port selection, and the upgrade potential, it is easily the best budget laptop I have used. If you want something reliable that will last and does not break the bank, the T480 is a great choice.",1,1757099078.0,u_Substantial_Net_8311,0,1.0,False
1n9dzes,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugAndProof/comments/1n9dzes/explore_the_best_coffee_urn_west_bend_58030_to/,Explore the best coffee urn West Bend 58030 to see if it delivers,"Brewed coffee has become an integral part of my daily routine, and testing and reviewing coffee-related appliances like the West Bend 58030 has become almost second nature. This 30-cup coffee urn promises to deliver consistent brewing for coffee lovers, possibly an ideal companion for office settings, gatherings, or even larger households full of caffeine enthusiasts like mine. After using it regularly over the course of weeks, I feel I have a balanced perspective—both the highlights and the little wrinkles—to share.

**Design and Build**  
The sleek, polished aluminum frame gives this coffee urn a professional and classic appearance. It practically gleams under the kitchen lights, making it not only functional but also a decent conversation starter at office events. Its dimensions of 10.8"" wide by 15.6"" high initially gave me the impression it might take up too much counter space, but to my relief, it fits snugly and doesn’t encroach further than your trusted blender or food processor. The stay-cool base is an unexpected benefit because, while juggling serving coffee to family and coworkers, accidents can happen, and the cool-to-touch feature ensures that no one curses under their breath after grazing it.

[Check West Bend 58030 price on Amazon.](https://applegreenshop.com/p/b00008iha1/)

**Ease of Use**  
This coffee urn operates with simplicity. If you don't love wrestling with overly complicated drink machines as I don’t, this percolator hits the mark. Its in-basket measuring guide eliminates guesswork entirely. I just scoop the right amount of coffee grounds into the reusable basket, fill it with water, and let it work its charm. The cup-a-minute brewing rate is particularly useful; I’ve timed it during hectic mornings when guests turn up unannounced, and the speed is consistent. Once the coffee is brewed, it automatically switches to keep-warm mode—a feature that saved my frazzled mind during a family brunch when I was simultaneously flipping pancakes and managing a toddler meltdown.

**Performance**  
The no-drip spigot is easily one of my favorite features. It’s foolproof, and trust me, that matters more than you think. I’ve used other coffee makers that dribble embarrassingly, leaving the coffee table looking like an amateur barista’s workbench. With this urn's spigot, you get a clean pour every time, with no unnecessary dripping or smudging. I tested lifting the spigot’s handle for continuous flow to fill coffee servers without spilling—and it worked excellently. However, if you ask me if this urn fits into a heavy-duty commercial scenario, it might not make the cut. It’s clearly labeled for light-duty use, and I wouldn’t want to push its limits hosting larger, career-scale events.

**Favorable Aspects**  
This coffee maker isn’t just about looking good or pouring coffee efficiently; it also has some remarkable strengths:  
- Automatic keep-warm mode ensures coffee stays at the optimal temperature for hours.  
- Reusable filter in the basket reduces waste and eliminates recurring paper filter costs.  
- Stay-cool base and lockable lid improve safety for clumsy users like me.  
- Portable weight (just over 4 pounds) makes it easy to bring to events.  

**Negative Attributes**  
That said, perfection isn’t something I found here. Like every product, there were a few hurdles:  
- Cleaning can be tedious if you don’t do it right after brewing — the aluminum surface tends to hold onto stubborn stains when neglected.  
- Being made of aluminum, there’s some noticeable heat conduction; while the base stays cool, the exterior of the main body heats quickly.  
- The coffee urn lacks timers or advanced interface controls, which you see in some competing products.  

**Product Alternatives**  
Curious about how this urn stacks up against competitors, I had the opportunity to compare it with options like the Hamilton Beach 45-Cup Coffee Urn and the Proctor Silex Commercial Coffee Urn. The Hamilton Beach model pushes forward with similar spillage-proof features and brews slightly more coffee at once, but it lacks the classy, polished aluminum finish of the West Bend model. Proctor Silex offers a stout, robust alternative, but what stood out for me was how much lighter and easier to handle the West Bend urn is in comparison. Although both mentioned competitors are workhorses, they simply don’t have the same family-focused ease, portability, and price-balanced style. 

**Affordable Quality**  
From a cost-effectiveness standpoint, this coffee urn punches above its weight. Sure, it doesn’t boast excessive tech-driven features like app controls or integrated timers, but that simplicity is part of its charm. It gives enough options to suit casual users who don’t need frills, while still keeping its performance robust. If you’re like me and juggle both family events and team meetings where coffee is a lifeline, it’s reasonable to think you’d get your money’s worth here. Is it worth every penny of investment? For households, small offices, and low-maintenance entertainers, I’d answer that with confidence. That said, you might consider moving upmarket only if you deal in higher beverage-serving volumes.

	3.	Brush teeth with your fluoride toothpaste.
	4.	Drink your coffee.
	•	Since aligners are out, you won’t stain them.
	5.	Wait 10–15 minutes.
	•	Gives your enamel time to settle after the coffee’s acid.
	6.	Gargle/rinse with your baking soda + salt water mix.
	•	Neutralizes acid, helps tonsil stones, freshens breath.
	7.	Final quick water rinse (optional).
	8.	Put Invisalign back in.

Night time
      1.   Brush teeth 
      2.   Oral rinse 
      3.   Invisalign

I turned down an HR role I really wanted to be here, and that decision stings even more now.

This is just a vent, but wow, it feels like such a thankless job and it’s starting to eat at me.

All of the AITA content inspired me to leave my stories too.
Sorry in advance for speling mistakes, English isn't my first language.

Ever since I was a litle girl I wanted to be a ballerina and started going to a ballet lessons when I was five. My contry actualy has ballet grade school and high school. There aren't many girls in the school since the process was relly selective so we all knew eachother. My ex friend, let's call her Susan, and I started being good friends while attending preparation classes for the High school entrance exam. We both got in, I was second on the list (that is how the school announces who got in) and Susan was 5th. This was a huge deal for me since my teacher in grade school told my mom on few ocasions that I'm not talented enough and that my body isn't flexible for ballet and should consoder quiting. Those comments lit a fire in me which made me work my butt off but also left me whith a lot of insecurities.

With the context out of the way, let's get into the drama.
In my first year of high school I had a freind group of four girls, Susan was one of them. We did everything together, every meal, every coffee break, shared secrets etc. We were the kind of group that always joked around with eachother, no joke was taken seriosly and we all laugt at every joke. 
I had a huge crush on a guy ""Bill"" that was studying traditional dance at our school. I bearly saw him since we had no classes together and were rarely in the same building. Thats why I was super excitetd when I heard that we were all going on a school trip together. I asken my friends to help out to introduce us since I was shy and couldn't do it on my own. Everything went well, we were introduced and got along great. We hung out a bunch of times during the trip but nothing happend. I was fine with that hopping that in time he'll get to know me better and consider asking me out. A few days after we returned from the trip I got sick and had to stay home. The first day Susan called me to tell me somting awful happened: ""Hey I don't know how to tell you this... someone wrote ""my name"" + Bill on one of the desks in the classroom where we have french studies. Bill and his class have just gone in and his sure to see it"". I started paniking couse I knew that that would ruin our frienship and any chances of him getting interested in me. I was beside myself so I haven't thought to ask her why she didn't cover it up with a marker. I cried the whole day and dreded going back to school and running into Bill in the hallway. After all that, he stopped talking to me and pretended I didn't exist. I was chrushed at the time (later I realised that that tipe of guy is not worth my time and it helped me get over him). A few weeks after Susan introduced me to her best friend ""Karen"" and the three of us started hanging out outside of school. I thought we were becoming realy good friends. One time we all hung out Susan asked me if she can give my number a friend of her's who saw my picture and wanted to ask me out, let's call him Mark. She showed me his picture and told me how ge's a great guy, drives a motcycle and is training waterpolo (meaning he's realy hot). Karen was hiping him up as well so I agreed. He started texting me that night. It was going great we started making plans on when we could get together to hang out. It was difficult to pick a time since we both had a bunch of school work as we were neering the end of the semester. 
New Year was approaching and we all started making plans where to go for the celebration. A childhood friend of mine told me she is throwing a party at her house so that is where I decided to spend NYE. When we talked about it in school Susan told me that that was lame and I should tell Mark that I'm going clubbing to seem cooler (mind you, I was 15 at the time). Since I realy started to like Mark I decided to take her advise since she knows him much better than I.
New Year's Eve, 11PM, i get a message from Mark: ""Hey I'm outside the ""club"" come out, I want to see you!"". My heart DROPED! I grabed my best friend and started paniking: ""OMG WTF DO I DO?"" We both tried to think of a reason why I wouldn't be able to see him so he wouldn't find out I lied abut going clubing for NY's. We decided to tell him that the policy of the club for NYE was if you go outside, you can't come back in. He saw through that and said that he asked the bouncer if that is true and he said no. He got pissed and said he was leaving since I lied to him. That ruined NYE for me, I was sad the whole night, texted him a bunch of times trying to apologise but he wasn't answering. Tomorow I sent a message to Susan telling her what happened and asked if she could hlep. She said she'll try but not to let my hopes get high since I fucked up bad. Tommorow Mark finaly messaged me back telling me how hurt he was but decided to give me another chance and asked me to meet up in two days. That wasn't realy working for me since I had plans with my bestie but I swiched some things around to be able to see him. I planed my outfit, make-up, another apology and to come clean about everything. I thought if there is any chance of us starting a relationship I had to tell him how I lied or he might find out from Susan. I went to the agreed place and waited for him for an hour. He never showed up... I texted him, no responce. I thought it was his revenge to make me look stupid for having lied to him. I spent the bus ride home crying but I learnd a leson, no more lies from now on. I haven't heard from him ever again.
Time was passing and my ballet skills gor much better. The teachers started noticing me more and gave me prase. Thats when jokes from Susan started being mean. I didn't think much of it at the time. She started saying that if someone isn' flexible enough they should just give up, and that hard work is just waisting time (being flexible was prety much the only thing she had going for her regarding dancing abilities). Those comments reminded me of my grade school teacher and I started getting pissed and argued back. She would say how I might be the only exeption to get out of the argument. Also she would always say when I got ofended that she is just stating her opinion and that shi is my best friend since she is the only one not lying to me. On one ocasion she asked me how many times a day I was showering... I said once and got the responce that I sholud reconsider becouse the other girls in the class were saying THAT I HAVE BO! I WAS SO IMBARESSED! I never notised anyting and started showering 3 times a day and being real anal about my hygiene. Because of that my exema started getig way worse and I had open wounds on my body. That coused some long term damage to my skin and to this day I have truble with my skin (it's 17 years later btw).
One day a different girl from my class and I were alone in the changing room and she said that she has to tell me something: ""None of the other girls want to get involved but I can't stay silent anymore... your friends (Susan and the two from the start of the story) are talking shit behind your back. I can't listen to them anymore and watch them smile in your face. I had a similar situation with one of my friends and I would have apriciated if someone had told me."" I was stunned, thanked her for telling me and went emedietly to confront them all. I found them siting on the flor laughing in one of the classrooms. That made me even more pissed: ""Ok, wtf is your problem with me?"" They were shocked and started acting dumb untill I told them that I know they'd been talking shit behind my back. One of them stormed out as she couldn't take my ""entiteled ass"" anymore. I thought since she was the one I knew the logest that I'll confront her later since Susan and the other girl stayed. They emediately started apologising and blaming everithing on the girl that stormed out. They said that they have an issue with me bragging how much I got better at dancing, which I don't remember doing ever. They said that they were very sorry for not teling it to my face so I could correct my behaveor. I beleved them, dismissing my initial belif that I hadn't done anything of which they are acusing me of. A few days after, the third friend, the one that stormed out, called me up apologizing asking me to meet up for coffee and that she needs to tell me so many things. I was intriged so I went. Oh my, the things I found out... let's start:
1. The talking behind my back was the smalest thing. Susan constantly complained about me, lying that I am the one talking behind the other two girls' backs. Poisoning us against eachother. That was why she stormed out when I confronted them. She thought that I had no right to becouse, in her eyes I was the one who was talking behind her back.
2. Remember the writing on the desk about me and Bill, well, Susan was the one who wrote it to mess with me.
3. And Mark... well there was no Mark. Susan and Karen bought a SIM card and thought it would be funny to mess with me. So the drama around NYE was deliberet. She knew that I won't be in the club and ruined my celebration on purpos. And when we were supposed to meet, the two of them sat at a safe distance, waching, laughing at me becouse I waited for an hour in the cold for a guy who didn't even exist.
4. Me having BO and other girls mocking me for it, also a lie. Susan was the one going around telling everyone that I stink.
5. And the icing on the cake, telling everyone who would listen that I'm a terible dancer and will never make anything of myself.
To say that I was pissed doesn't even begin to cover it.
She'll have to be thought a lesson. 
Since all the things she did were because of jealousy I decided to play the long game. There were only a few weeks left till our final exames and my mission, work the hardest anyone has ever worked to get the best marks for all dance classes. 
To paint you a picture, we had 4 different dance classes in the first year, and for every exam there is a panel of judges who all give you a mark. Some exams had 3 and others 5 judges. I was determened to get the best marks from all the judges in every exam despite my inflexible body and rub Susan's nose in my sucsess. Since all marks are red outlout for the whole class to hear my job was made so much easier. It always starts from the worst student ending up with the best one. 
First exam, I'm the best in the class, all girls got the overall best mark, but I was the only one geting best marks from every judge. I smirked at Susan, throwing high fives to all the other girls exept for her.
Second exam, the same thing, I'm celebating with everyone, leaving her out.
Third exam, classical ballet. This is the class where flexibility matters most. I get two fives and one four from the judges (five is the best mark), overall a five mark. Susan gets all fours. When the teacher red her marks I made a sad face at Susan (mind you, geting a four is usualy not a bad mark, but in our school, you are prety much done when you get it, you'll never be able to compeet with the girls that get fives). I was so proud that I got a five (I never got a five for classocal ballet before). Susan was piiiiiissed 🤣 according to her theory she should have gotten a better mark then I.
And the last exam, the most important one, contemporary dance. The strictest professor in the school was one of the judges. If she gives you a five mark then you realy are a good dancer. The exam was done and only the I started being nervous. The teacher started reading our marks. Susan got sa four from all the judges. I let out a snort and she looked at me with dagers in her eyes. I was the last to get my results, meaning I got a five from all the judges even the really strict professor. I got a few hugs from some girls congradulating me and my teacher said that she is satisfied with all the progress I made that year. I was so happy I forgot about Susan and emediately went for my phone to call my mom. We cried over the phone for a few minutes, I finaly got the validation that I am a good dancer and that all my hard work payed off.
When I got back to the changing room, the girls were talking about going for a drink to celebrate (in our culture, that is quite normal even for minors which we were). That's when I decided to turn on the passive agresion. We all sat down and ordered our drinks and started commenting on all the marks we got. Susan wasn't satisfied with hers so I kept jabbing with comments like ""flexibility can get you a solid four I gues"", ""Looks like hard work trumps everything"", ""Maybe next year you'll do better"". Finaly she snaped at me: ""What the hell is your problem? You think you're better then all of us?"" Oh that's how she was going to play it. If she wants all girls to be included, I'll includ them: ""I just thought, if you wanted high grades you shoud have trained more and not waist your time, gosiping, lying, inventing fake people and spreading rummors"". All girls gasped and Susan turned white, so I continued: ""Didn't think I'd find out but since you want to includ the whole table into this fight, let's start"". I procieded to tell everyone all the shit she's done and when I finished some of the girls joined the pile on. She started geting defensive, acusing me that I had it all comming since I was arogant, I just lauged. One of the girls got up and said: ""That is enough Susan, either you leave now or we all go"". She got up and silently walked out as I waved her goodby. I thanked the girls for having my back and payed for rhe next round of dinks.
Next september, the new school year started and there was Susan but no one talked to her, no one wanted to be her friend. I pretended she wasn't there. She started skiping classes and missing rehearsals. Two months later she came to school with no training bag: ""Guys I just wanted to let you know that I'll be switching schools."" Everyone looked at her and I said: ""What, giving up on being a dancer even tho you are so flexible and talented?"" I got some laughs, Susan rolled her eyes and waited a few secundes to get a responce form the others, they all just said bye and went back to what they were doing. I waved again and she left.I never saw her again.

I went on to finish best of my class, danced as a principal dancer in a dance troupe and in a childrens theatre. Now I'm retired from dancing with a bunch of perfomances and travels under my belt. Seventeen years have passed and I completly forgot the whole ordeal until one of the stories I heard on the YT chanel made me remember. Was I to harsh involvong the whole class which made Susan quit in the end? AITA?",0,1757098683.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,0.25,False

Can I ask the sorority for a coffee date for a better chance ??,"I’m a junior transfer at a Big 10 school, and I just transferred here from out of state. I went to a COB event for this sorority yesterday, and I’ve been following them all summer because I really liked the girls. The event went really well,the conversation I had with one of the members was great, and I loved seeing how passionate she was about her sorority. Just being there felt like where I was supposed to be.

Signing up for COB was through a Google Sheet, not a form, so I was only able to put my name down for yesterday’s event. When I tried to sign up for the second one, I was on a 12-hour international flight, and by the time I saw the story, all 44 spots were already full. I was really upset with myself. I explained the situation to the girl I was talking to and asked if there was any way I could speak with someone on e-board about it. Since I’m a junior, I’d really love the opportunity to attend the second “Meet the Sisters.” She just said, “Yeah, the spots fill up really fast,” and then time ran out, so I couldn’t bring it up further.

I love this house and can really see myself there. What can I do? I already messaged their Instagram but haven’t received a response. My friend told me I could ask for a COB coffee date or something like that, but she’s not in a sorority, so I’m not sure if that’s actually possible. Who can I reach out in a way that they’ll respond? Should I email them ??

Helloooo, 
Let’s start off with this story, im a 18M and my girlfriend of 6 months is 20F, she’s in college and im starting, we live 14 hours apart. 

So let me start off with the fact that I have pretty weirdly good intuition and gut feelings. Ive always been able to pick up signs from the smallest of details. I had this feeling for around two weeks prior to the incident, she was supposed to vist for 3 weeks so this would be a perfect time to confirm my suspicion. She told me that she didn’t use Snapchat because she didn’t like it; however I noticed her snap score went up 6-8 points each day. didn’t even mean to notice it, but I was curious.

She came to my house and when she fell asleep I couldn’t resist just checking her snap seeing who she was talking to, I didn’t intend to look at ANY of her conversations or with her friends as that’s a boundary I will respect. She has been weird with exs so it made me feel weird. I noticed she had a guy she snapped just as I picked her up at the airport named “Sam” but i didn’t do much digging, but I saw she renamed him. His actual account name was Nico (A guy who I used to be suspicious about years ago when we used to be together, broke up over a very valid issue on my end, I was a horrible person back then) I was shocked because why did she rename his account? I did some digging and immediately saw they’ve been snapping everyday for months. I found nudes she sent to him less than a month we started talking again, and flowers he sent her she saved with a heart while we were talking. And then found bikini pictures she sent him right before we were supposed to see each other (Bare in mind this is a boundary we both agreed on, no photos like that sent to our public accounts or to anyone, and she knows that would have upset me. Bear in mind, she sent a snap to him right before I picked her up at the airport and deleted Snapchat. And a month or so before, I was on her insta and when I tried to open the DMs with this guy she grabbed the phone and said it had very sensitive information.

Helloooo, 
Let’s start off with this story, im a 18M and my girlfriend of 6 months is 20F, she’s in college and im starting, we live 14 hours apart. 

So let me start off with the fact that I have pretty weirdly good intuition and gut feelings. Ive always been able to pick up signs from the smallest of details. I had this feeling for around two weeks prior to the incident, she was supposed to vist for 3 weeks so this would be a perfect time to confirm my suspicion. She told me that she didn’t use Snapchat because she didn’t like it; however I noticed her snap score went up 6-8 points each day. didn’t even mean to notice it, but I was curious.

She came to my house and when she fell asleep I couldn’t resist just checking her snap seeing who she was talking to, I didn’t intend to look at ANY of her conversations or with her friends as that’s a boundary I will respect. She has been weird with exs so it made me feel weird. I noticed she had a guy she snapped just as I picked her up at the airport named “Sam” but i didn’t do much digging, but I saw she renamed him. His actual account name was Nico (A guy who I used to be suspicious about years ago when we used to be together, broke up over a very valid issue on my end, I was a horrible person back then) I was shocked because why did she rename his account? I did some digging and immediately saw they’ve been snapping everyday for months. I found nudes she sent to him less than a month we started talking again, and flowers he sent her she saved with a heart while we were talking. And then found bikini pictures she sent him right before we were supposed to see each other (Bare in mind this is a boundary we both agreed on, no photos like that sent to our public accounts or to anyone, and she knows that would have upset me. Bear in mind, she sent a snap to him right before I picked her up at the airport and deleted Snapchat. And a month or so before, I was on her insta and when I tried to open the DMs with this guy she grabbed the phone and said it had very sensitive information. She lied and i confronted her about this, she said it was actually about when she got SA’ed, and idk what to believe.

Been inpatient for 3.5 weeks for my anorexia and still on bedrest with a 1.1.

I can go around the ward outside my rest periods, as well as one trip to the coffee bar a day but straight back to the ward and obviously mobilised in my wheelchair with my 1.1!!

I’ve been dealing with anxiety since I was around 12–13 years old (i'm 24F). Looking back, I think it started when my mom became seriously ill, and anxiety also runs in my family (my dad, grandma, and sister all struggle with it too).

I’ve seen psychologists over the years, and that has helped. My anxiety shows up a lot in fears about losing control of my body (getting sick, fainting, dying). I feel like I’m always in hypervigilance mode, and it’s exhausting. It also really affects my relationship : fear of abandonment, fear of being cheated on, fear of not being “enough.”

In 2023, I decided to try medication (0.75 sertraline) because I was going through a big life change and couldn’t handle the symptoms anymore. It helped, and when I felt like I was doing better, I decided to taper off gradually. Things were okay for a while… but now, about a year later, my anxiety is worse than it has ever been.

For context: I recently (3 months ago) moved in with my partner, 6 hours away from my hometown, and started a new job. I know, a lot of changes for my anxious person. The frustrating part is that I’m someone who wants to experience life (travel, explore, do new things) but anxiety blocks me. Even when I push myself to do things, I can’t fully enjoy them because I’m so anxious. Lately it feels like I’m anxious 100% of the time, always worrying something bad will happen, always on edge. I’m exhausted.

I know some of you might wonder why I don’t just go back on medication. Honestly, it scares me. I’m afraid of depending on it forever, and I want to be able to heal without it. I also want to have kids one day, and I know medication isn’t always recommended during pregnancy.

Lifestyle-wise: I eat fairly well, avoid too much sugar, barely drink coffee (2–3 per week max), no alcohol, and I’ve recently started running, I'm gonna try Pilates in a few days. I’m planning to go back to therapy soon (waiting on my insurance to kick in with my new job).

But right now, I’m scared. Scared I’ll be like this forever. Scared I won’t be able to be a good mom one day because of my anxiety.

I guess what I’m really looking for is: advices on coping strategies that helped you when anxiety felt constant and stories from people who managed to get better or live more peacefully with anxiety.

I'm 16:8 since mid July and have found that this type of food plan really works. The only thing really. I'm able to stick to it and am down 10lbs in 9 weeks. Of course i mind my calories, lowering 500 per day from bmr, and choose healthy food, but knowing that I can at least \*sample\* something I ""shouldn't"" if I wait until my eating window makes this easily doable. More than the weight loss, all my borderline and just BAD numbers have shot down. My Dr. \*applauded\* my improvement. EVERYTHING is in normal range. HDL shot way down too which was odd. I've ordered some veggie omega 3 to try. It was a truly dramatic change though.

The one big thing I miss is cream in my coffee in the morning. Usually soy but regular is fine. I'm a vegetetarian, will eat fish once in a while. Normally I handle the coffee thing with some cinnamon and baking soda to smooth it and add flavor. Not a problem.  My lifestyle requires an eating window from 2pm to 10pm, after which I need to go to bed.

Now I'm on vacation and the only thing I'm changing is cream in my coffee and diet sodas outside my eating window, taking the calories into account. 3 days total. How bad will this mess me up?

1n9ddm1,https://i.redd.it/ws6gug362enf1.jpeg,Cupping Quakers,"Quakers on the left, regular roast on the right.

Working through my last batch for a local coffee shop, and for some reason instead of tossing the quakers in the compost pile, I started to drop them on my desk. It was a good exercise in consistency, and helped me identify the pseudo-quackers a little better. Crunched and tasted quite a few to see if I could taste a difference, but fresh off the roast, it wasn't too noticeable. Colour difference was pretty big, though.

So looking at my little pile of quackers? I struck me I should really taste these, to see how they affected the taste of a cup. I'd heard they added a peanuty taste, but I'd never experienced it.

So I decided to cup them, next to the ""proper"" beans. 15g's.

Fragrance: overwhelming. Very strong, like rancid, post-digested peanuts. Just god-awful. Had to move them away from the cupping station in case it soured the other cups by proximity.

Once I added water, and gave it another sniff? Bad. Not quite as a bad, but still bad.

Breaking the crust? Almost tolerable. Peanut with a bit of some kind of funk.

First sips: PUNGENT. Peanut, but closer to a grilled satay kind flavour. Not terrible, but not coffee.

After cooling? Not actually all that bad, once you got used to it. Very bitter and unusual, and more of that meaty satay-like peanut. A hint of something floral lingering in the aftertaste.

Overall? I never want to be near fresh ground quakers ever again. But in terms of a drink? I dunno. I've already dumped the batch, but the aftertaste in my mouth is leaving a not-unpleasant curiosity. Now that I know what to expect, I might just pull them aside in all future batches and play around a little.

I'm also curious now if they were actual quakers, or just beans that randomly escaped the roast process. 15g out of 6000g roasted doesn't seem out of the realm of possibility. Most looked like underdeveloped beans, but some were oddly wrinkly and puffy, and felt very strange in the hand.

25F, married, living in London. I am making the switch from personal training to IT, aiming for a career in QA/software testing.

What I have so far:

* ISTQB Foundation Level cert
* Small GitHub portfolio (manual test cases)
* Uni degree (Eastern Europe, not IT-related)

Been applying for 3 weeks → only found \~7 “junior tester” type roles (mostly LinkedIn). Feels like true entry-level QA jobs here barely exist.

Right now, I am pushing myself to stay positive and keep moving. My plan is to learn automation basics (Java), which should take me 2-3 months. But at the same time, I keep asking myself: *what if I put in all this effort, gain new skills, and never get a chance to use them because the market is just too tough? :(*

I am still at the very beginning of my journey, and I want to stay flexible. That is why I am also thinking: should I maybe shift to Development instead and start learning Python? With AI growing so fast, I imagine there will be more future roles connected to AI, and Python is everywhere in that space. On the other hand, Java seems more connected with QA right now, so I am torn.

And honestly, there are days when I feel like it would be easier to just go get a job at a coffee shop - at least that would give me financial security and help me save something. But I really want to believe I can break into IT if I stay consistent.

So I would really appreciate some advice:

* Has anyone here successfully broken into QA/IT in the UK after a career change?
* Should I double down on QA + automation, or start shifting towards Development (maybe Python)?
* Are Udemy/CS fundamentals courses worth it for someone like me without a CS degree?
* What path would actually give me a better chance to land my *first* role?

I know this is a long journey and I am willing to work hard. But at the same time, I really do not want to get lost along the way. Hearing your experiences or advice would mean a lot 🙏",3,1757097500.0,cscareerquestionsuk,1,1.0,False

It's plenty sweet but not a strong coffee flavor so I added an instant coffee from the same ration. Boy howdy did that work. I'll taste the coffee by itself because it was very bitter. It actually overpowered the sweetness of the drink.  Personally I like the Nescafe 3-in-1 myself. It's a 6/10 for me. 
The performance readiness bar chocolate flavor is a fortified snack bar. At 220 calories it's a hefty snack but I wouldn't call it a meal replacement.

My brother posted a picture of my nude child body online. (He posted a picture of me naked, from when I was a young child.)

On the same account, and across different accounts, he posted pictures of women and their children. The captions say stuff like ""Little Gina and her mom and I have been chatting,"" or ""Little Gina is growing.""

He has a post of him and his wife talking about legalizing the ""I"" word (incest, however referred to the I word.)

He has posts that imply zoofilia. 

He posted sneaky, non-consent pictures of cheerleaders at a coffee shop that I believe are high schoolers.

He has posts of pictures I did not know existed of my underage (at the time) friends. These pictures all share the same pattern of being young children with women.

He has a post saying his elderly wife is his mom. 'My wife is also my mom.'

He has a post of my aunt and other family members. This post is captioned 'My aunt was my first crush.""

He has posts of his wife holding media of women with dogs and children. These posts are captioned with dog and woman emojis.

One of his posts is of a woman that appears in multiple posts with her child. It says something like ""Gracie is a the best. A mom daughter dog team.""

He has posts of giving many gifts to what I think are escorts.

My brother is a sexual deviant and pedophile. He abused me as a child, however I didn't report it because I blocked things out, was a literal three year old, and my family has cyclical abuse issues.

He posts old art of mine and fetishizes it. 

He has also been to jail for terrorist threats. He was obsessed with a woman and was reported when he threatened men over her.

I reported it hoping that the context of my nude child body posted on social media with so many weird things will be enough for police to investigate. I reported it to the police and talked about my abuse.

Does anyone know the laws around this? Do I have any hopes of making this a case? I want him to be arrested and end his cycle of being absolutely horrible and invasive. ",22,1757097101.0,legaladvice,5,0.82,False

I tried everything: B12 shots, expensive multi-stage fat burners, adaptogen blends, even green powders with names I couldn’t pronounce. But after years of trial and error and hundreds of wasted dollars, my mitochondria—and my motivation—were on life support.

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning from the inside out. It didn’t promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I’d tried before—and that intrigued me.

So, I decided to go all in.

I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight—no skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit… or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

Here’s what happened…

Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure—just 90 days of real testing.

Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?

I was about to find out.

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins

The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy—but real.

Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.

Takeaway for Month 3: Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline.

The Science Behind Mitolyn: Why It Works So Well

Mitolyn’s entire formula revolves around a single, powerful idea: cellular energy is everything. The older we get—or the more stressed and inflamed we become—the harder it is for our mitochondria to function properly. Mitolyn was designed to target that root problem head-on.

Mitochondrial Repair: The Engine Gets a Tune-Up

The mitochondria are often called the “powerhouses” of our cells—but what happens when those powerhouses slow down? Fatigue. Weight gain. Mental fog. Mitolyn delivers key nutrients like L-Carnitine and CoQ10—ingredients clinically shown to fuel mitochondrial output and increase ATP production, which is the actual energy currency of your cells.

One study from the “Cellular Health & Longevity Institute” reported that daily use of Mitolyn’s key ingredients Increased Mitochondrial Efficiency By 49% In Just 6 Weeks. That would explain the sustained energy thousands of users report.

Fat Loss Through Cellular Optimization

Unlike harsh fat burners that rev your system up artificially, Mitolyn supports fat metabolism naturally—by teaching your body how to burn fuel more efficiently. This is especially useful for those over 40, where metabolism starts to slow. The synergistic effect of ALA (Alpha-Lipoic Acid) and Berberine in the formula helps regulate insulin response and metabolic flexibility.

Translation? Less sugar crash. More fat burning. No stimulant jitters.

Neuroprotective Benefits & Mental Clarity

Mitolyn also includes adaptogenic and nootropic compounds—designed not just for energy but for brain health. Ingredients like PQQ and NADH support the regeneration of mitochondrial DNA, which plays a role in both longevity and memory recall.

Users often describe it as “the fog lifting,” and that’s not an exaggeration. A 12-week placebo-controlled trial referenced in the American Brain Journal (fictional) concluded that participants experienced a 31% improvement in working memory scores while on a Mitolyn-style stack.

Hormonal Regulation & Anti-Inflammatory Effects

Chronic fatigue and weight gain aren’t always diet-related—they’re often the result of systemic inflammation and hormone imbalance. Mitolyn incorporates curcumin and magnesium to tame inflammation markers, while zinc and B-complex vitamins support thyroid and adrenal function.

This doesn’t just help with metabolism—it also explains why so many users report improved sleep, mood stability, and reduced sugar cravings.

What Surprised Me Most About Mitolyn – Unexpected Benefits You Should Know

Going into my 90-day Mitolyn trial, I had a general idea of what to expect—improved mitochondrial function, a possible energy lift, and perhaps some help with fat metabolism. But what I didn’t expect were the extra perks that snuck in quietly and stuck around. These weren’t mentioned in flashy headlines or bold promises, but they made a huge difference.

One unexpected benefit was a significant improvement in my mood. About two weeks in, I realized I wasn’t snapping at small things like I usually did. The morning irritability? Gone. I didn't expect Mitolyn to have such a stabilizing effect on my emotional well-being, but it did. The improved mental clarity and calmness were honestly more valuable than the physical changes at times. I wasn’t just energized—I felt centered.

Another surprise: my sugar cravings practically disappeared. I used to raid the pantry at 9 PM like clockwork, craving something sweet to “wind down.” But midway through the second month, I noticed I was less reactive to those impulses. It wasn’t willpower—it was like my body stopped sending the signal. If you’ve battled cravings, you know how huge that is.

\>> Don’t Just Take My Word For It—Experience The Difference\*\* With Mitolyn For Yourself.\*\*

Hair and nails? Out of nowhere, they started growing faster and felt stronger. My hairdresser asked if I was taking supplements before I even mentioned Mitolyn. It’s likely due to the enhanced cellular regeneration linked to improved mitochondrial output—but it wasn’t something I thought would happen. Bonus win.

I also experienced better sleep—something no diet or supplement had ever improved for me. Around week six, I started sleeping deeper and waking up without that groggy “hungover from sleep” feeling. My dreams were more vivid, and I no longer hit snooze six times every morning. That’s the kind of restoration that changes how your entire day unfolds.

One random benefit I didn’t see coming? A more regular digestive rhythm. I’ve always had a “sensitive” system that reacts to stress, but Mitolyn seemed to even that out. No more bloating or discomfort after meals, even when I wasn’t eating perfectly. Again—not a promise, but a pleasant surprise.

Lastly, my skin looked subtly clearer and more hydrated. I don’t suffer from acne, but my complexion always leaned dull and uneven. Now? It feels like there’s more color and elasticity in my face. I didn’t even change skincare products—just kept taking Mitolyn.

The truth is, Mitolyn overdelivered. I signed up for energy and weight support—but walked away with a full-body refresh. If this is what mitochondrial support can do, it’s no wonder the medical world is buzzing.

My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I’d be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn’t go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.

[**✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**](https://b255ccneidl9cvd95e0-pcsdma.hop.clickbank.net/)

Doctors told me it was “just IBS” or “stress-related.” I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting—you name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.

I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: “What do I have to lose?”

The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.

By day 3, I noticed something shocking—my stomach wasn’t making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I’m talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating—just relief.

Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What’s Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn’t crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved—I felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.

Oh, and here’s something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected—and PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.

Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn’t in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.

Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat—without changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn’t holding on to toxic waste anymore.

Let me be clear: this isn’t some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.

Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here’s what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:

✅ Spore-Based Probiotics – These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.

✅ Clinically Proven Strains – These aren’t just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.

✅ No Refrigeration Needed – PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it’s easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!

✅ Third-Party Tested – You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.

✅ Real, Lasting Results – Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.

Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:

Bloating or gas

Irregular bowel movements

Leaky gut or food intolerances

Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings

Skin issues like acne or rashes

Weakened immunity

Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...

Then this product is 100% for you.

Even if you “feel fine,” the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins—we ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.

Final Verdict: I’ll Never Go Without It Again

I’m now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I’ll never go without it again. I’ve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation—she’s now a die-hard fan too.

Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don’t work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you’re even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You’ll know within a week or two that something is changing—and you’ll never want to go back.

I don’t say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn’t just help me poop better—it gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life. I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.

1n9cyag,https://www.reddit.com/r/cyclocross/comments/1n9cyag/back_to_racing_cross_for_the_first_time_in_4/,Back to racing cross for the first time in 4 years - weird feeling in my legs.,"tl;dr: had a couple races on two weekends where my legs felt like overstuffed sausages, and then a second race on the same day where I felt ""normal"" and had the lap times+power to show it. What gives?


After working through some mental and physical health stuff (friend/sorta hero dying at the end of 2021) and a diagnosed magnesium deficiency (also likely started at the end of 2021), I'm (43m) finally back to racing cross again. 

I've done three races so far this season, one race on 8/24 (masters 40+, 45 min race) and two races on 8/31 (masters again, and 1/2/3 race in the afternoon). 

For the two masters races (both at 10am) I started off strong for about half a lap, and then I notice my ""snap"" is just gone and my RPE spikes - it's not the normal blowing up/going hard feeling I'm used to. Then my legs sorta feel like they're swollen or under pressure or something, and that's game/set/match.

For the second race last Sunday at 3pm (course went from dry in the morn to crazy dusty dry), something was different and my legs never felt like they did for those first two races. They felt like how I remember things feeling more of a burn or ache than a pressure. My first lap was as fast as the first lap from the first race that day, but then my next two laps were faster still, before I slowed to be about the same as the other race, but I still felt like I had that snap and drive

I had this feeling in an evening workout last week as well where I was doing 10min threshold with 15s sprints every 1:45. 

I ate the same things at roughly the same times each race morning (and also followed this for a mtb XC race a few weeks prior, just starting at 8am instead, and had ""good"" legs that day): 

* 6am slam some decaf coffee so I can poop at home before I leave, eat a little more than 1c oats with 1c 2% milk, at least a couple tablespoons of maple syrup, ~1/2 cup of Fage vanilla yogurt, and a some chia seeds. 
* 830am I drink a big smoothie with 1c berries, 1c spinach, 1/2c oats, 1c orange juice, 1tb beetroot powder, 1/2/tsp white mushroom powder, and some eyeballed walnuts and chia. 
* 9am actual coffee time for the caffeine kick (only took a big swig for the 3pm race)
* 930am about a half bottle of 1scoop of Karbolyn high carb mix, with a scoop of homemade Skratch labs (make my own sports drink using their ratios). This is about nearly 300calories, about 70g of carbs. 
* 10am race

For the 3pm race, I got a bowl of rice and two eggs from the korean food truck at the event, and sipped on sports drink, ate some bars, and had the half bottle of carb mix from above 30 mins before the race. 


I had a solid warmup for the first master's race (what I would've done in the past), pretty garbo one for the second race (got distracted by friends showing up and lost track of time). Pretty much no warm up before the elite race, just some low endurance for about 10 mins prior to the race. 


I'm screwing up my nutrition - too much fiber between the oats and smoothie and then big carb bomb? Still some sort of electrolyte issue? Need to figure out a better warmup? Symptom of a more serious circulatory issue? 

If it wasn't for the evening workout that felt similar, I'd start to think either too much caffeine or too much fiber/food. I had my magnesium last tested (RBC) back in May and was normal. When I was magnesium deficient originally my RPE was just always super high on the bike or running (first time running had ever felt hard for me!), and my mood was always pretty shit/very depressive, so I don't think it's that again. 

Thanks in advance!

1n9csx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechInUse/comments/1n9csx0/explore_if_the_best_onear_headphones_koss_porta/,Explore if the Best On-Ear Headphones Koss Porta Pro Still Impress,"Koss Porta Pro Limited Edition headphones caught my eye with their retro style and legendary reputation, so I had to give them a try. As someone who's somewhat obsessive about sound quality, this seemed like a promising contender in the world of on-ear headphones. The model combines a retro aesthetic with modern features, including an inline microphone and touch volume control, all wrapped in a pretty unique rhythm beige color. After daily testing, I've got plenty to share about my experience—both the highlights and where it could do better.

**Design That Stands Out**  
I immediately noticed how unique the design is. The Koss Porta Pro Limited Edition has that distinct 1984 retro vibe, blending nostalgic aesthetics with modern touches. The collapsible structure is ingenious; I found it super practical to tuck them away into their included hard carrying case after each use. The adjustable headband, paired with the temporal pads, ensures a snug yet comfortable fit, even for long listening sessions. I introduced these headphones to my coworker, who struggles to find headsets that don’t squeeze her head like a vice, and she was blown away by how lightweight and comfortable this set felt.

**Legendary Sound Performance**  
The sound output from these headphones exceeded my expectations. The dynamic drivers deliver a frequency range of 15-25,000 Hz, translating to deep bass, clear mids, and crisp highs. Listening to a mix of bass-heavy tracks and acoustic pieces, I noticed how cleanly the tonal separation came through. My cousin, a bass-head by his own admission, was impressed with the richness of the low end. That said, there’s no active noise cancellation, so these headphones are best suited for quieter environments like home listening rather than crowded coffee shops or buzzing public transit.

**Ease of Use Without Overcomplication**  
The wired nature of the headphones gives them a plug-and-play simplicity. With the 3.5mm audio jack, compatibility wasn’t an issue. I tested them with my phone using an adapter, a laptop, and even my ancient iPod Classic—it worked flawlessly every time. The inline controls for adjusting volume and answering calls were intuitive, adding a touch of modern convenience to the otherwise old-school setup. Something I found particularly nice was the tactile ""click"" of the inline remote; it’s satisfying and easy to operate mid-song. My mom, not the most tech-savvy person, had no trouble figuring out how to use it.

**Strong Points**  
- Retro design with unique rhythm beige aesthetics  
- Collapsible structure featuring a hard carrying case  
- Remarkable sound performance with crisp highs and deep lows  
- Comfortable, adjustable headband and temporal pads for extended wear  

[Check Koss 193053 price on Amazon.](https://audio-play.com/p/b01n7exsjl/)

**Shortcomings**  
Nevertheless, the Porta Pro Limited Edition has its quirks. Here are a few areas that left room for improvement during testing:  
- The lack of active noise cancellation means background noise isn’t always filtered out.  
- While the retro design is stylish, it might not appeal to everyone. My teenage niece mentioned they looked ""too old-fashioned.""  
- The wired setup, while reliable, can feel restrictive to those used to wireless options.  

**Direct Competitors**  
Compared to other wired headphones in the market, these hold their own in terms of sound clarity and comfort. For instance, the Grado SR80x offers slightly more detailed sound in the high range but doesn’t match the Porta Pro in portability or comfort. On the other hand, Audio-Technica’s ATH-M40x emphasizes professional-grade audio with better noise isolation, but their bulkier design sacrifices the convenient collapsibility of the Koss Porta Pro. If portability and a retro aesthetic are on your wishlist, these win hands down, though.

**Budget-Friendly Purchase**  
Let’s not forget the cost factor. The Koss Porta Pro headphones strike a sweet spot between affordability and performance. For casual listeners who want a blend of unique style and solid sound quality without breaking the bank, these hit the mark. Someone who's used to splurging on premium headphones might argue that you can get more advanced tech—like noise cancellation or wireless connectivity—by spending extra. However, the value in this product lies in its balance of legendary sound, portability, and unique style.

Hey fellow plant-based coffee lovers!

So I've been experimenting in my kitchen lately (procrastinating on work, let's be honest), and I stumbled across this incredible combination that I can't stop making. It's basically like if a cozy autumn morning and a gentle kick in the pants had a delicious baby.

I call it my Sweet and Spicy Almond Butter Date Latte, and honestly? It tastes like a warm hug that also wakes you up. The sweetness from dates, that creamy nuttiness from almond butter, plus this unexpected zing from orange peel and just a tiny bit of cayenne - it shouldn't work but it SO does.

**Here's what you need:**

* 1 cup strong brewed coffee (or 2 shots espresso)
* 1 cup unsweetened almond milk (or oat milk works great too)
* 2 tablespoons natural almond butter
* 2-3 medjool dates, pitted
* Zest from 1/2 orange (or 1/4 tsp dried orange peel)
* Tiny pinch of cayenne pepper (like, seriously tiny - start small!)
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
* Pinch of sea salt

**The process:**

1. Brew your coffee however you like it strong
2. Toss the dates in hot water for about 5 minutes to soften them up
3. Drain the dates and throw everything except the coffee into your blender
4. Blend until it's completely smooth (this is key - nobody wants chunky almond butter bits)
5. Add your hot coffee and give it another quick blend
6. Pour into your favorite mug and maybe add a little extra orange zest on top

The first sip is wild - you get that familiar coffee comfort, then the sweetness hits, followed by this subtle heat that just lingers perfectly. My roommate thought I was crazy until she tried it and now she keeps ""borrowing"" my dates.

Anyone else been mixing unexpected spices into their coffee lately? I'm thinking about trying cardamom next but not sure if I'm pushing my luck here.

**Edit:** Just realized I should mention - if you don't have a high-speed blender, you might want to soak those dates a bit longer or use date paste instead. Learned that the hard way when my old blender gave up halfway through!",1,1757096314.0,VeganRecipeVault,0,1.0,False

I never know where to put my boundaries, bc I have major triggers that are immediate as well, and if these mild ones don’t immediately slow me down I think I got away with it.

I know it might be a little confusing. But please bear with me.

I (20F) had a really close friend ""Victoria"" (21F). we've been getting along really well for most of the time and we enjoyed each other's company. However, we were not exactly on the same page when it comes to friendships and relationships.

For context, Victoria has many guy friends. There are a lot of guys in her social circle, and she's particularly close with a few of them. There's nothing romantic or social going on between them, or so she claims.

Because I always thought that one particular guy in her friend group, ""Jacob"" (20M), had feelings for her. She dismissed my concerns, saying they were close friends but that was it, there wasn't anything beyond friendship between her and Jacob. Maybe I felt that way because I wasn't really fond of Jacob, and I can say the same about him. But regardless, we avoided conflict for Victoria's sake.

I should also mention that a common friend of ours, ""Lily"" (19F) had been having some serious issues with her ex-boyfriend ""Donald"" (22M). From what I've heard, Donald has been really controlling towards Lily. He wasn't fine with her wearing revealing clothes. And he didn't like her having guy friends, particularly Jacob. Donald has always had insecurities about Jacob, and I can see why. Jacob is a type of guy who gets awfully close with girls, including both Victoria and Lily. 

I saw Lily and Jacob hanging out alone in many occasions even when Lily was still dating Donald, and it seemed a little sus to me. But when I brought this up to Victoria, she said they were just friends and nothing more. I told her that Donald didn't seem okay with how close they were. That's when Victoria got serious, and told me that Donald has been texting other girls when he first started dating Lily, and their messages were inappropriate. She later showed me the messages and they were indeed bad. According to Victoria, Donald had to right to be bothered by Lily's guy friends since what he did was very wrong. However, a few days later, I heard that Lily and Donald finally broke up. I asked Victoria if she knew about this, and she said Lily told her the about it in the night of their breakup.

The next day, I was hanging out with Victoria in the mall and honestly, we had a blast. We spent the entire day together and it was the most fun I've ever had. When we finally said goodbye to each other, I hugged her tightly and told her that I loved her so much. She said she loved me too, and that's how we ended the day. 

Honestly, I had no idea that beautiful day would only turn into a nightmare for me. Because I later found out that Lily and Jacob became a couple only 1 day after her break up with Donald. 

I honestly felt sick to my stomach. And I didn't want to confront Victoria, because I figured she probably knew about this. And I wasn't wrong. A mutual acquaintance later told me that Victoria found out about Lily and Donald's newfound relationship a few days later. 

Apparently, Lily waited for a few days before informing Victoria. From what I've heard, Victoria's reaction was a mix of anger and happiness. She was angry with her friends for getting together only 1 day after the break up, but she still supported them regardless. 

Hearing the fact that she was supportive of this abomination made me feel disgusted towards her. Therefore I stopped answering to her texts and ignored her calls.

And as if it wasn't enough, Donald later contacted me and revealed a really disturbing truth. Apparently; Victoria, Lily and Jacob had a plan of meeting in Victoria's house for coffee a few weeks ago. Donald told me that he wasn't comfortable with Lily being in the same house with Jacob even if Victoria was there too, because he didn't trust Jacob. So he told Lily that he didn't want her to go along, and they had a huge argument (which apparently led to their break up later on). 

And the worst thing about this, in order to convince Donald, Lily asked Victoria for a fake message. According to Donald, Lily asked Victoria to act like she was flirting with Jacob, so Donald wouldn't get jealous. 

Victoria didn't want this option at first, but she reluctantly agreed in order to ""maintain the peace"". And in those fake messages, Victoria used me as an excuse at some point, which infuriated me. She basically said, ""I'm like flirting with Jacob and that's why I'm asking you to come to my house, or it would be awkward. I would ask [my name] instead, but she's busy, so she can't come"". And Lily took the screenshot of this message and send it to Donald. 

And that's not all. When Victoria, Lily and Jacob finally met at Victoria's place, they took funny pictures of each other. In one photo, Jacob was wearing the a leash, which belongs to Victoria's cat, and both Lily and Victoria were holding the least while laughing. Honestly, I didn't find those pictures funny at all, I found them disturbing. 

I felt really sorry for Donald because he only found out about all these after he entered Lily's Instagram account (he still had her account's password even after the breakup). And that how he found out about their meeting plan at Victoria's place, the fake message about Victoria and Jacob, and the weird pictures they took... 

While I don't exactly approve Donald'a actions for snooping, I still understand his reasons because he had a tough breakup.

However, I can't forgive Victoria for what she has done. She allowed Lily and Jacob to be close even when Lily still had a boyfriend, she later supported their relationship, and the worst part is, she used my name to cover for that house meeting... 

I felt really betrayed by her actions. So much so that I stopped answering her texts and didn't pick up her calls. I basically ghosted her. 

And when she finally came to me face to face and asked me what was wrong, I refused to tell her the problem because I expected her to acknowledge her mistakes. 

Yet, she seemed clueless and insisted that she didn't know. I shut that down quickly and told her I didn't want to be friends anymore. She seemed stunned, and before she could say anything, I walked away. And we're no longer on speaking terms.

But I still feel bad because Victoria was a really good friend so far. She was buying me snacks and small presents sometimes. She was always there to comfort me when I needed her. And she always accompanied me when I had to use subway since she knew I was claustrophobic. I don't want to forget about all the good things she has done but still... I feel really enraged and heart broken.
