1n6dnkn,https://i.redd.it/hhup2stelpmf1.jpeg,The Matcha Series: Dozy Coffee,"Was not gonna go out today because grabe ang ulan sa Mansilingan sang aga, pero mayo lang naginit sang hapon te naganahan naman ko magdiscover new matcha spots. This time around, it's Dozy Coffee.

✨️ THE SERVICE ✨️

Their space is small. Only a few tables and natimingan ko nga may table for 2 pagsulod ko. Easy to read menu so yay for people like me with bad eyesight. There's only one barrista so when you order, you get your food and drink from the counter, which I don't mind cause it's a small space man. Very chill vibe sang barrista which I appreciated kay daw wala ko sa mood today because of the weather.

🍵 THE MATCHA 🍵

First sip pa lang na teleport ko balik sa Muji. When I used to live in Manila, Muji was just walking distance sa office ko so every so often kung naubos na matcha supply namon sa office, gabakal ko sa Muji. People say that Muji matcha is chalky, pero to me it's just right for a daily matcha. Dozy's is like that - not too sweet, not too bitter, just the right amount of creaminess. It's definitely not the creamiest matcha I've had in Bacolod, but it satisfied my craving for Muji.

🍪 THE FOOD 🍪

Drink-based gid ang Dozy so limited food options, but they do have snacks. I had their chocolate revel bar and na appreciate ko gid nga it was reheated kay it made the chocolate extra-melty. Indi siya sum-od, just the right amount of sweetness, pero very oat-heavy gid siya te dasig ko nabusog so ginpatakeout ko na lang ang bilin. Also appreciate nga naka paper box ila takeout and may dala pa nga wooden spork.

❗️OVERALL REVIEW ❗️

It's not a spot you can stay in for long since very small lang ang area, but if gusto mo magmatcha nga ikaw lang isa nga dasig lang, ma recommend ko gid ang Dozy. For 170 (oat milk sub na ni), na satisfy gid ko.

Amo lang na, sa dason naman nga matcha 🫶🏽",3,1756800354.0,Bacolod,1,1.0,False

She pointed to a woman leaving the café and said, “She pays for a random stranger’s order once a week. Today was your turn.” I never even saw her face. She didn’t wait for a thank-you or want recognition. Just… kindness for the sake of kindness. I sat down and just took a minute to absorb it. We spend so much time rushing around, focused on to-do lists and obligations, that it’s easy to forget how deeply one small gesture can ripple through someone’s day. I ended up paying it forward by covering someone else's lunch later, and the smile they gave me felt like pure sunlight. That stranger’s quiet act of kindness reminded me that the world isn’t so bad—there are still people out there who do good just because they can.",5,1756800182.0,u_CutieMira31,0,1.0,False

1n6di5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1n6di5d/my_loved_ones_told_me_to_cut_my_family_off/,My loved ones told me to cut my family off,"because my family abandoned me.

I have a dysfunctional family.

There are pages and pages I could write about my family life to give context. But I will try to keep it to the point. But be prepared for it to still be a long one.

When I was young we used to value family time. Family dinners, meeting up daily for short coffee talks, big family holidays, est... It made it easier to feel like a family despite our flaws. Like the fact that my parents went out of their way to not have to be involved in our schooling or lives outside ""the family"" anymore than absolutely necessary. So no sports, electives, extracurricular, est.. that would require extra work on their part. No great effort to meet our friends, significant others, est...

It was a strange dynamic to say the least. But the focus on family time seemed to smooth the awkward gaps over somehow.

But then all of that just stopped as we got older. Especially when we were adults. And because our parents didn't do it. Somehow the siblings kind of floated apart into their own seperate lives too.

I did notice this happening and I tried to stop it by reaching out. But it all started while I was rather young myself. And I assumed we were just getting to that age where we siblings were trying to find ourselves. And that it was normal to some capacity to be doing our own thing. So I focused a little more on trying to check in with my parents.

However I was getting the same Luke warm response from all of them. And it seemed like they had the same relationship with each other.

It only got worse as we moved further away from each other. We'd go weeks or months without talking. But if you could get them on a phone call they'd act like no time had passed at all. Though the context of what they talked about was fairly shallow. More like a coworker than a family member.

I realized this was creating a rift. So I tried bringing back the family holidays. I tried very hard to organize it for THREE YEARS. And they had excuse after excuse not to do even a family dinner at ANY point in the year. But they all insisted they wanted to. The signals were very mixed. And if anything did get organized, it We'd last minute.

I ended up moving further away, so these last minute events excluded me entirely. I expressed how this hurt and how I really wanted to be there. But this continued to be the trend. 

If anything bad happened, all of a sudden they'd be in frequent contact. The best relationship i had with my sister was any time her relationship was in crisis. Or when my mom was in a social crisis. Once it was resolved, We'd go back yo inconsistent contact. Any messages I sent were given half hearted replies. Or nothing at all. I got the best luck if I could get a call answered.

All of this was hard enough to process. Because there wasn't anything obviously wrong to cause the rift. And everyone insisted there wasn't anything wrong. Just that they were busy. But it was weird to be the only family member who seemed to want to spend any time together. They only showed up to very special events after that. Like my wedding. They didnt make much effort to get to know my spouse.

Fast forward to the worst of it.

My dad gets very sick. He'd been dealing with his health and some serious interpersinal/home life issues on and off for many years. So no one was taking it very seriously. Many treated it as if it was just more of the same 'drama' or something. But I knew something was wrong. I pushed him to go to the hospital. The next few weeks were a blur of surgery, specialists, and bad prognosis. He was dying. They gave him two years, and there were a series of things that could make his time shorter.

I told our family everything the doctors said. I moved him into my house because his was trashed from the interpersonal issues he was having. I talked to everyone about how he wanted to be back home but it would have to be cleaned up so we could organize his hospice care there. I told everyone id need support while I helped him. And that he'd need their support the most.

All they did was call him on the phone. And visited him a few times during his many hospital stays over the next few months. They kept acting like there was more time to do more later.

My dad had been depressed before all of this and it got worse after. He also got more and more hostile.
I reached out to family over and over again on the verge of tears. Telling them that I needed help and that I wanted to do what was best for dad.
But, as I said, it was usually just the phone calls directly to dad.

The only family member that even called me was the one who'd cut off our parents a long time ago. And the one I have the most complicated relationship with due to that.

And from beginning to end, the person who trashed my dad's house harassed me.

During this time the stress on my spouse and I, as well as our children, was high. And my spouse was an easy target. My dad had never bothered to get to know them, and dad didn't seem to care if he hurt them by being cruel.

So I told my family if they weren't going to help with dad's house that we needed to decide on a home for him. As the situation in my house was getting to hostile. That i wanted the best care for my dad, but given the lack of care options in my area and the high hostility in the home: it was making things very hard.

No one argued that it was wrong to opt for an in patient facility. But no one wanted to help me choose. And when I tried to discuss it with my dad, he was upset. He wanted to go home, and if he couldn'tgo there he wanted to stay here. But he couldn't go home: The house was trashed. And i didn't have time to care for him and also travel out of town to clean/repair the house. There was no extra money to pay someone to do it either. And there weren't even any services in my town to lean on to try to solve use as a buffer for what was happening at home.

In the midst of this, my father decided to call DCFS on us so we wouldn't send him away. This triggered a chain reaction of DCFS deciding that he should be placed in hospice care due to my father's high volatility towards my spouse(After everyone else said no to placement). I was not included in his care after this point due to the tension that caused him to call DCFS. Less than a month after he left, he died in his sleep in the interim hospital he was at.

The funeral planning was awful. I couldnt be in charge given circumstances. And everyone kept pushing the responsibility around.

I had to research and send information a lot.
Eventually my sister picked from the options that others showed her. And put a deposit on a venue and food for after. But that is as far as the planing went.
Luckily id went out of my way to put pictures into a digital album together a long time ago. Which a few other family members had added to in the interim.

No one wanted my spouse at the funeral. But I didnt know how to face the event without them as my only real support. They were the only person that was thinking about the necessary details like I was either. If they hadn't went with me, I wouldn't have even been able to put the slide show up. And it was the only thing that made what they planned look like a wake/funeral. Other than the memory box items id put together so people could write down memories if they wanted a quieter way to contribute.

No speeches were made. Just quiet conversations over food. Many of which weren't even about my dad.

I thought the worst was over.

But then the matter of his estate came up. There was no will and the house was on bad shape. My spouse and I offered to help move some things out.

Then the person who trashed it talked the loudest about what needed to be done. And accused me of theft. And accused my spouse of trying to steal things of my dad's that they didn't deserve because my dad hated them. And that was the reason my spouse offered to move things out.

None of my family members stopped them.

And they defended them by agreeing that my dad had hated my spouse. My sister told me that I should have expected a bad response for saying my spouse would help.

Ignoring the fact that this person had trashed my dad's house. And that they made a lot of false accusations against me for no reason for offering to help move things.

The whole thing exploded from there. And I ended up unloading on them about how they had left me and dad alone that whole time. And how unfair it was to demonize my spouse who was there; just because dad was lashing out at my spouse while dad had been sick.

My loved ones dont understand why I've been trying so hard for over 9 years to maintain contact with my family. Especially after this last year when my father was dying and they couldn't be bothered.

But it just feels weird to cut them off. Because other than the one who trashed dad's house, the rest haven't done anything. Pretty literally too.

You assume when you cut people off it's because they are acting crazy.

But I guess people who dont care enough to even try also counts.

I am just having a hard time deciding to cut them off. Even with being extremely hurt about this last year especially.",1,1756799773.0,family,1,1.0,False
1n6dh7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/WellnessVortex/comments/1n6dh7u/sneaky_signs_of_blood_sugar_swings_most_people/,Sneaky Signs of Blood Sugar Swings Most People Ignore,"**Ever been “hangry” and thought it was just your personality acting up?**  
Yeah, turns out your pancreas may have been running the show.

Most people think blood sugar swings are only a “diabetic thing.” Nope. The reality? Your blood sugar is quietly playing DJ for your moods, energy, and even your ability to think straight. And when the beat drops… it’s not always pretty.

**The Myth vs. Reality**

**Myth:** You’ll *definitely* know if your blood sugar’s out of whack — it’s dramatic, like fainting or needing an ambulance.  
**Reality:** The early signs are sneaky. Subtle. Easy to brush off as “just me being tired” or “I skipped breakfast.”

Here’s the kicker: those small swings, ignored over time, are what wear you down. Imagine your body as a car engine. Sure, it’ll still run with dirty oil, but the long-term damage is stacking up quietly under the hood.

**The Everyday Signs Nobody Connects**

Let’s play doctor for a minute. Ever experienced these?

* **Mood rollercoaster.** One second you’re fine, the next you’re irrationally annoyed that your partner chewed too loudly.
* **Brain fog.** You sit down to work, and suddenly your brain feels like someone poured molasses into it.
* **That 3 p.m. crash.** Not just tired — *wrecked*. Coffee feels like a life raft, but it only buys you 45 minutes.
* **Sleep chaos.** You fall asleep easily, but boom — wide awake at 2 a.m., like your brain’s running an infomercial marathon.
* **Cravings with a capital C.** Not “hmm, I could eat.” More like “I NEED carbs right now or I’ll bite someone.”

These aren’t random quirks. They’re your body’s way of whispering, “Hey, buddy, glucose levels are swinging harder than a toddler on Red Bull.”

we think willpower is about “strength” (eat less sugar, snack less often). But really? Willpower is just blood sugar management in disguise.

Picture this: nobody is their “best self” when their glucose is crashing. Expecting saint-like discipline when your body is in survival mode is like asking someone to do calculus while drowning. The system is rigged against you unless you fix the foundation.

**The Empowering Part**

The good news? You’re not doomed to live life bouncing between sugar highs and energy wipeouts. Small tweaks add up:

* **Protein at breakfast.** Think eggs or Greek yogurt instead of just toast. It steadies you like training wheels for your blood sugar.
* **Fiber is your buffer.** Veggies, beans, berries — fiber slows down the glucose spike, making life way smoother.
* **Move a little after meals.** A 10-minute walk can literally act like a “glucose sponge.” Your muscles soak up the sugar instead of leaving it to roam free in your bloodstream.

And if you’re looking for a shortcut that stacks the odds in your favor, supplements like [**GlucoTrust**](https://glucotrustfr.co/decouverte/#aff=Piquify) are designed to help support balanced blood sugar, improve sleep, and curb those wild cravings. It’s not magic — but it’s like upgrading from flip-flops to running shoes for this whole balancing act.

Here’s what I’m curious about: *Which of those sneaky signs do you notice most in yourself?*

Because once you connect the dots, you stop blaming “laziness” or “bad moods” and start realizing — oh, wait, maybe it’s just blood sugar playing tricks.

So… do you think your energy dips are really you, or just your glucose calling the shots?

1n6dgzl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n6dgzl,THE BIKER’S MAFIA PRINCESS,"I was twenty-one back then—carrying a baby, rejected, and pushed aside by the man I loved, too afraid to ask for help, too ashamed to be a burden.
***
“Mommy … go.” I push the cart around the store as I watch my beautiful two-year-old daughter Rebel clap her hands as I go faster, and she squeals in delight.
She is so much like him. He who shall not be named kind of scenario. She doesn’t take after me much apart from the honey eyes. Her dark blonde hair and nose are like his and boy, does she have his temper.
“Ok Rebel, we need to finish this. Then we will go to the park. How does that sound?” she kicks her legs and claps again. I chuckle at her behaviour, leaning down to kiss her head. I finish off shopping and head out to the car.
I left home over three years ago. Three years I ran. The same man that is Rebel’s father hurt and humiliated me. I never got to tell him he was about to become a father. The woman he claimed had already done that. I couldn’t risk my parents finding out, either. It would have caused a war between my family and his MC.
My dad is the Don of the Moretti empire and my momma, well, she is the head of the cartel and the DeNucci family. I am their only daughter. The princess of the combined empire. My twin brother Nathaniel is next in-line to take the position of Don after dad retires and me well, I was supposed to take over the DeNucci family and my younger brother Nico would take over the cartel.
That all went to mess when I ran. It was difficult at first going to a new place. Living not just for myself but for the life I was carrying inside of me. The savings I had I used to find a place to live, get everything we needed and what was left, I invested it in a rundown bar.
I changed my name and never looked back. My bar is doing so well and it is nice to know that I have made it what it is today. The bar is called the Eclipse. The town we live in is a tourist town. So we get different people coming and going.
Most people come here to the lake in the summer and the skiing in the winter. It’s a friendly and safe place to live and I am happy here. When I first arrived here, I was lost, but I was welcomed and I wouldn’t leave even if you paid me too.
Once we have arrived at the house. It’s nothing like the Moretti mansion, but it’s home. With its white picket fence. White walls and blue door. It doesn’t look like much from the outside, but it’s open plan on the inside and modern. Upstairs there are three bedrooms, all with an en-suite and a family bathroom. Rebel has her own room next to mine and life is good.
She doesn’t want for anything; I carry the shopping inside and then carry Rebel in. Shutting the door, I place her in the living room with some of her toys as I put the shopping away. Just then, Boomer bounds inside. Rebel loves him as much as he loves her. I got Boomer when I was preqnant and both he and Rebel grew together.
He is a beautiful big softy. He is a Cane Corso. He is as black as night with a tiny patch of white on his tʃest. He is our protector, even if he does drool everywhere and talks back when you tell him no.
My phone rings and I take it out of my back pocket and see that it is Coral who is supposed to work the bar tonight. I gr0an, knowing she is about to ask me to cover her shift, no doubt because her douchebag ex won’t have their child tonight.
“Hey Coral, what’s up?”
“Hey Angie, look, I’m really sorry to do this, but Steve ditched me and I can’t find a sitter.” I roll my eyes. If I had a dollar for every time he has let her down over the last year, I would be a wealthy woman.
“Ok. Coral, no worries, but you and I need to have a chat about this. I will cover tonight, but you need to sort this out.” I hate being the bad guy, but she knows I have a toddler, too. I don’t have the support she does, even if it is my own doing.
“I will get it sorted. I’m so sorry Angie. I promise I will make it up to you.” We say goodbye and end the call. I look at Rebel and sigh. Still time to take the little miss to the park, and then I will have to call Mrs Lawson and see if she is available. I know she will be she loves Rebel.
“Boomer, leash.” I say and he is off to get what I’ve asked as I scoop up my now rowdy toddler and get her ready for the park.
“Go now?” I smile at her.
“Yes, sweetheart, we can go now.” I say, kissing her on her cheek. Grab the stroller and strap her in. Getting her in is always a workout. The child goes as stiff as a board and she finds it hilarious.
I make the call to Mrs Lawson as I put the leash on Boomer and pray she can help.
“Hello, Angie, how are my two favourite girls today?” I grab my keys and some snacks and drinks, placing them in the changing bag and attach it to the stroller.
“We are doing just fine. I hate to do this last minute, but Coral called and …”
“Say no more. I will be at your house at seven, then you can head out.” God love this woman. She is my lifeline.
“Thank you so much, I hate to spring it last minute.”
“Nonsense, sweetheart. You know I love to help out.”
“Thank you again, Mrs Lawson. I will see you soon.”
“How many times, call me Scar. You are family. No need to thank me. I will see you both soon. Bye Angie.” I hang up and head out.
After a couple of hours at the park and one tuckered out Rebel, she is fed and bathed and ready for bed. Mrs Lawson arrives and I head to work.
Pulling up at the bar, I notice we are packed out tonight. Well, at least the shift will go quickly.
Leaving the car, I head inside. I smile at some of the locals and make my way behind the bar. The night goes smoothly and begins to quiet down. I look at Max and tell him I’m going to office and if he needs me to come get me.
I head to the office to get some 0rders done and check the accounts and I lose track of time.
“Erm, Ang. I need you back at the bar.” I look up and smile as I stand and leave the office, shutting and locking the door behind me.
The music gets louder the closer I get to the bar. The sound of raucous laughter fills the air and something feels off. My gut twists and flutters the closer I get.
Stepping out behind the bar, I freeze. No, it can’t be. I notice the cuts.
The Princes of Darkness MC with white stitching against the black leather. An embroidered patch of a red devil with wings riding a Harley. The same MC that he runs, the very same MC that is in allegiance with my family. What are they doing this far out?
“Angel.” My eyes widen and my heart jumps into my throat as I look into the icy blue eyes of the man who broke my heart, the man who forked his wh0re in front of me, the man I ran from, the father of my daughter.
Ryder ‘Savage’ Jackson.
Chapter 2
Savage POV.
I look at the profile picture on my messaging app. It hasn’t changed in three years. I sigh as I open her contact and see all the messages I have sent her over the last three years, and each has gone unread. I’m so fricking dumb.
FLASHBACK!
It’s been four weeks since I ended my relationship with Angel and claimed Foxy as my woman. Everything has been great. Angel has not contacted me, but I do find myself looking at her profile picture.
“What’s wrong baby?” a hand rubs my bare arm as I close the app and look at the woman beside me. Foxy with her red hair and brown eyes. She is beautiful. She is the mother of our unborn child.
“Nothing babe, go back to sleep.” I kiss her head and she snuggles back down, but I can’t sleep. Something isn’t right. My gut is telling me I should check up on Angel. I shake that thought away.
Why should I? The s1vt was cheating on me. She doesn’t deserve my concern.
With that, I fall asleep only to be woken by my door being banged on.
“Prez, we need to go. The Moretti’s have called an emergency meeting.” Blaze, my VP, says and I gr0an and sit up. I quickly get dressed. The Moretti’s this could be bad. But then again, Angel wouldn’t have told them anything, not unless she wants me to show her momma and daddy that she is a wh0re. I smirk as I leave my bedroom and walk through the clubhouse.
“What’s happened? Why are they calling this meeting?” I ask as a coffee is placed in front of me.
“We don’t know. I have tried to find out. All I’m being told is that it is urgent. We need to leave now,” he says, well you don’t need to tell me twice. No-one keeps the Moretti’s waiting. When they call, we move. My father Hatchet and Antonio had worked together for years. That’s how I met Angel.
They would come here or we would go to them. Even though she is four years younger than I am. We did used to have fun. Then, when Angel turned eighteen, the attraction grew between us and I took her first night. We were in a secret relationship up until those photos were delivered to me four weeks ago.
I said some pretty awful things to her when she caught me s3xing with Foxy; she needed to see that what I did were the consequences of her actions. Like the naïve little girl she is, she denied, and we argued. She slapped me, but I didn’t care and I don’t care. She got what she deserved.
I mount my bike alongside with Blaze and Ripper. He is my Sergeant At Arms. We head out of the compound and onto the road. We ride for a few hours before we arrive at the Moretti compound.
We pull up and climb down. Stepping into the mansion, the atmosphere is sombre. The other heads are here. I shake hands with them and they are all not sure why we have been summoned. But we don’t wait long.
Don Antonio Moretti walks into the room and we all nod our heads in respect to him. He looks like he has aged drastically, but then there is Teagan. She looks like she hasn’t slept and has cried. What the heck has happened?
“Thank you for coming at short notice. We appreciate it. Please sit,” Antonio speaks as he takes his seat and pulls a distraught Teagan onto his lap.
“We have called you all here, because our daughter, our Angel is missing.” My eyes widen and murmurs break out around the table. I look at Blaze and he glares at me. This won’t have anything to do with me. I’m sure she is just doing this for attention.
“How long has she been missing?” I ask and all eyes turn to me.
“A week. She hasn’t been herself for a while. The day she left, she told us she was going to the gym, she never came back. She drove her Mercedes to the bank and emptied all her accounts and closed them down. She then sold the car. We have no idea where she is. Her phone has either been discarded or she has turned it off. You all know our daughter. She is not a pampered, self entitled princess. She is not a spoilt brat. So for her to do this means she is in some kind of trouble.”
I gulp, not liking this one bit.
“There is one more thing. We believe we know the reason why she thought she needed to run away.” He looks at everyone, but his eyes land on me. I feel the blood freeze in my veins. Oh shet, he knows.
“She is also preqnant. We received something in the mail yesterday and I will say this. What we received had been fabricated. My team has already established this.”
“What did you receive?” One of the Don’s asked.
“Pictures of our daughter sleeping with different men. Whoever sent them is an amateur. Simon and Rosena established very quickly there were photo shopped. So it would seem the reason why our daughter ran is that she was being threatened with these images. Angel is a kind, gentle soul. We have teams already looking for her in every corner of the world.”
My heart is beating erratically. The pictures are fake? What the heck is going on?
“Do you know who the father is? Maybe she went to him?” I look at Blaze and he is fuming the same as I am. My fists clench under the table when Teagan looks at me and her gaze sends shivers down my spine and the sense of dread settles in my gut.
“We have an idea. The thing is, Angel would have tried to do the right thing. She would have gone to him to tell him. In my old line of work, I can tell you this: he has probably rejected her and her child. So she ran, not wanting to be a burden or to bring shame. Don’t forget ladies and gentlemen, my daughter is a DeNucci. We are famed for our skills in disappearing.” Teagan says, looking at me, and I gulp, shrinking into the chair.
That’s why she came. She came to tell me she was preqnant and like an idiot I am. I believed the photos and Foxy. I was drunk, but that is no effing excuse. My Angel, my goddess, is out there somewhere, no doubt scared, alone and preqnant with my child.
The rest of the meeting went by in a blur. I can see her tear-streaked face, the way her hand protected her belly. The way she was scared of me. The look of heartbreak on her beautiful face. She ran and is carrying my child.
END OF FLASHBACK.
“Savage, the next town we will be meeting up with Solomon. We need to move.” Blaze says to me. When my phone rings and I gr0an as I see the person calling me.
Foxy, I don’t answer the call. I never fricking do. I dumped her three months after I claimed her. I took it back when I found her being forked by two men from a different charter. I dragged her to the hospital to perform an ultrasound and surprise surprise the b1tch wasn’t fricking preqnant. She denied she was the one who sent the pictures. But I’m not silly. I know it was her.
“Ok, let’s move out.” I say as I leave the motel and we ride out. The search for Angel ended six months ago. Antonio and Teagan said Angel will return when she was good and ready and if she is found, she is not to be forced. Like he11 will that happen? If I find her, she and my kid are coming with me.
We ride to the town and pull up at the bar we are meeting Solomon. Solomon is the prez of the sister MC. We work closely together so this meet is nothing new but we have never met at this town before.
We step into the bar called Eclipse. It’s nice. It has that small town vibe going and I like it. The man behind the bar looks like he will pass out with the amount of us that has just walked in. I chuckle as he heads out to no doubt get someone to help him.
I mean, we are rowdy bikers, but we don’t start bar brawls; we are here to relax and to see Solomon, nothing more.
I hear a gasp and the rooms seem to quieten down. I turn and the image in front of me has me doing a double take.
Her long blonde hair is in a high ponytail, her honey eyes are wide. Her front is raising and falling rapidly. She is a vision. She is more beautiful than she was three years ago.
“Angel.”
Chapter 3
Angel POV.
They have found me; they have found me. Crap, frick, tvat! I look at him and I’m having a mini panic attack. All I can see is him and her. The words he spewed at me with such hatred and the smirk on her face. Why is he here?
He reaches for me and I react instantly; I grip his wrist and turn him, shoving his arm up his back. He gr0ans and the men are now on their feet. I look at Blaze, his VP, and he is telling everyone to remain calm.
“You have the wrong person. Now get out.” I shove him forward as the fight-or-flight takes over. I need to get out of here. I need to leave. I need to grab Rebel and Boomer and go. But where?
“Angel, that’s not going to happen. We have been looking for you. Your family has been looking for you. We have found you and there is no running from us,” Savage says to me as I step back, my eyes not leaving his.
“My name isn’t Angel. I don’t even know who you are. Now I won’t ask again. Get the fudge out of my bar or we will have a problem.” My voice is like steel as I stare the fricker down. I won’t back down now. I have to protect my daughter.
I catch movement from the corner of my eye and hold my hand up, and the movement stops. Just then, the door opens and more bikers come in. The momentary distraction causes me to act. I run for it. I run like my behind is on fire because it is. My hands are shaking as I run out of the side exit and towards my car. I drop the keys as I pick them up. I unlock the car when I’m grabbed and shoved into the side of my car. I scream when a large hand covers my mouth. The tears leave my eyes as I look into the icy blue orbs locked on me.
“Angel, please. I mean you no harm. Let me explain, please.” Like he11 I will. I bite down on his hand. He yells and moves away. I don’t think I bring my knee up hard, hitting him in his crown jewels the air leave him and he falls.
I open the car door and fumble with the keys and peel out of the parking lot. Tears blur my vision. I wipe them furiously away and ditch the car a few streets away and run to the house.
It won’t be long before he finds me again. I stop running and chuckle to myself. There is no use in running. He has found me and no doubt they will ask around town and will have my address soon. What can I do? ok think Angel. You can’t just pack up and leave in the middle of the night. You can’t uproot Rebel like that.
No, I will face the demons of my past head on. If he comes for me, which I know he will do. I will be ready for him. I’m a goddam Moretti and we don’t fricking run from our enemies and right now Savage and his MC are the enemy.
I turn back around and head back to the car, which is parked haphazardly, and I climb back inside. Pulling my phone from my pocket and fire off a quick text to Max, telling him to close up for the night and to not give any information about me to anyone.
He responds quickly, telling me they have gone and said they will be back to speak to you. I roll my eyes and sigh before I drive the car towards my house. I drum my fingers nervously against the steering wheel as I pull up outside my house.
The people of this town don’t know who I really am. It is safer that they don’t know. Even if the Moretti’s don’t have enemies. No one is brave or dorky enough to try anything. So I know either way I am safe, even if the Princes of Darkness have found me. They can’t touch me, not without retaliation from my family.
I leave the car and walk up the stone path to the front door. I open it and head inside. Rebel is awake and having a drink of milk on Mrs Lawson’s lap. They both look at me and I smile at them.
“You’re home early, everything ok?” I move forward and kiss my daughter on her head as she holds her foot drinking her bottle of milk. I kiss Mrs Lawson as well.
“Yeah, it wasn’t too busy, so I told Max to close it down and head home.” I only tell her part of the truth.
“You look like you have had a fright. What happened Angie?” I sigh as I stand and head to the kitchen and grab a bottle of bud and sit down on the sofa. One won’t hurt. I think I deserve it after what just happened.
“I need to tell you the truth about me. My name isn’t Angie, it’s Angel. Angel Moretti. My parents are Don Antonio Moretti and Teagan Moretti.” I say as I watch her and she nods her head slightly.
“I know dear. The whole town knows who you are. We aren’t simpletons. A few years ago, your family sent men here looking for you. We all told them we had no clue who you were. We knew you were running from something, so we choose to protect you. So tell me Angel, what happened tonight?”
I look at her, shocked. Hold on, back up. The whole town knows who I am? I chuckle in disbelief at this.
“Wow, well thank you.” she waves me off as Rebel waves her now empty bottle in the air like a flag. I chuckle at her as Mrs Lawson sets her down, and she toddles to me and I pick her up and cuddle her to my front and I know she will be asleep in a matter of moments.
“Her father found me tonight. Completely by coincidence. Her father is the president of the Princes of Darkness MC. His name is …”
“Ryder.” My eyes widen as I look at her and I gulp, nodding my head.
“How do you …”
“Hatchet is my brother. I moved out here, not long after Ryder was born. I left the MC life behind. My brother and I never stayed in touch after that. I will keep you both safe. I may no longer be part of that life, but that life remains in me. If he comes calling which he will do. You have to be ready. She is his child. The world of the MC is similar to your world. He has every right to claim her and when he does, you both will have to go with him. I’m sorry Angel.” She says to me.
I look down at my sleeping little girl and sigh, knowing I can’t run from this. Same as I can’t involve my family. He doesn’t know about her, so that is a good start.
Or at least I think he doesn’t. What have I got myself into?
Chapter 4
Angel POV.
I wake up to the sound of Rebel’s belly laughing.
I climb out of bed and yawn, stretching. I look down and I yarn, stuffing my b00b back inside my vest top. I rub my eyes as I stagger down the hallway to her room. Still sleepy, I didn’t get much sleep last night. I couldn’t settle, every time I closed my eyes. I saw his face. I look at my little girl who is sat on the floor playing with her blocks.
“Rebel.” I say in a singsong voice she turn her head to the sound, her hair sticking up in every direction kind of like mine right now. I chuckle as she stands up and runs to the baby gate. I lean over it and pick her up. Giving her kisses all over her face.
She is a happy baby, she always has been. Her tantrums, however, could frighten a hurricane away. She is explosive when she is having a moment. But on the whole, she is a happy girl.
“You hungry?” I reach for her head and try my best to smooth down the crazy professor hair. She nods her head and snuggles into the crook of my neck. I chuckle and pat her b0tt0m as I walk us both down the stairs.
Boomer lifts his head from his bed in the living room, his stump of a tail wags like crazy as he stands and follows me to the back door to be let out so he can use the bathroom. I get inside the bathroom by the back door and quickly change Rebel, wash my hands and pick her back up. Then I shuffle to her highchair and place her in it. I hand her a book and she bangs it against the tray.
“Ok little lady, what do you want for breakfast?” I ask her as I flick the kettle on and get to work making my coffee. It’s going to take a truckload to get me functioning this morning.
“Eggs, tost.” I chuckle dippy egg and toast it is. She is still learning to say words properly, but she is doing great. I get to work boiling the water for the eggs. I turn the TV on to some kids channel I turn the chair so she can see the TV in the living room. I drop the eggs into the water and get Boomer’s breakfast ready.
Once the eggs are ready, I let them cool slightly as I make her toast and butter them, cutting them into long strips for her to be able to hold.
I sit next to her watching her eat her breakfast. I smile as she gently picks up the long strip of toast and dips it into the gooey yolk. She does a little dance in her seat as she eats. I chuckle at her antics.
The doorbell sounds and I reach for my phone and check the camera. I gasp. Just great. It didn’t take him long. I ignore it for now. When he starts pounding on my door. Boomer growls and abandons his food as he walks towards the window.
“Angel, I know you are inside. Open the door, I just want to talk.” Boomer starts barking which causes Rebel to jump out of her skin. Can’t have a moment’s peace?
“Shhh sweetheart, it’s ok you eat your breakfast. Mommy is going to answer the door.” I tell her it’s a good thing she has finished her egg and is now eating her buttery toast.
I kiss her head and move to the door. Boomer stands in front of me and I grab his collar. I take a breath and open the door.
“What do you want, Savage?” he looks at me in surprise before he smirks at me. Duh, oh well, no point in hiding now.
“Just to talk Angel, please.” I roll my eyes as Boomer growls and I pull him back.
“We have nothing to talk about, Savage. I think you said everything that needed to be said three years ago. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m kind of busy.” I go to shut the door when his booted foot stops me.
“I want to see my child, Angel. You won’t keep me away.” My heart sinks. How does he know? Who fricking told him?
“I think we need to have that talk, don’t you?” he chuckles. I may hate him, but he is right. We do need to chat and I need to find out how he knows about her.
“Fine, meet me at the bar at one this afternoon. We will talk then.” I say and he smiles at me, his dimples on display. He steps back, and I shut the door. I lean against the door, resting my head against it, hearing the motorcycle drive off. Rebel squeals as she throws her toast on the floor. I sigh and push off the door as Boomer eats up what she has dropped.
“You, missy, need a bath.” I say with a chuckle, looking at her egg and toast covered mouth and face. She even has the toast in her hair. My little Rebel.
After she had a bath, well, I say bath; the bathroom was more like a swimming pool when she has finished. She is dressed in her little jeans and pink T-shirt with a glittery unicorn on the front. Her dark blonde hair is in little buns on the top of her head, she is also wearing her little pink converse.
I look at the clock and see it’s half-past twelve. I make her a quick snack and she eats it all. I grab the keys and Boomer and leave the house. I did contemplate keeping Rebel away from him, but there was no use in that. He knows about her now.
I head out when Scar walks up the path.
“Where are you both off to?” she asks, and I swear she has some kind of sixth sense or something.
“Savage came to the house this morning. He knows about Rebel and so I agreed to talk to him at the bar.” I tell her and she nods her head.
“Well then, it looks like we will be heading to the park then.” I look at her in confusion.
“It’s ok, I may as well rip the bandaid off and let him meet her.” I say to her and she nods her head with a small smile on her 1ips.
“You are doing the right thing, Angel. If you need me, give me a call and I will put him in his place.” She says, waving her fist and I laugh at her. Scar reminds me of momma. She is fearless and I adore her.
“Ok, I will keep that in mind. We have to go.” I say to her as I walk to the car and strap Rebel into her seat as Boomer sits next to her in the back.
We drive to the bar. I catch sight of his bike out front. The nerves kick up a gear as I park beside it. Careful to not scratch it or crash into it. Which wouldn’t be a bad idea. I chuckle evilly at the thought.
No Angel, you are not a child. I climb out of the car and to the back. I unclip Rebel and set her on the floor. Boomer jumps out and walks beside me. Here goes nothing.
I open the door to the bar and see Coral behind the bar who is making goo-goo eyes at Savage. I roll my eyes as I walk further in.
“Hey Angie,” I smile at her when I feel his eyes on me. I hold on to Rebel’s hand as I turn around.
He isn’t looking at me, no, he is looking at his daughter.
Chapter 5
Savage POV.
I stare into the honey coloured eyes of the little girl holding Angel’s hand. My heart stops and my knees weaken as she looks back at me. I feel the tears build in my eyes as she looks up at her mom and asks to be picked up. Angel smiles at her lovingly and picks her up, placing her on her h1p.
My daughter. Sod it, I have a daughter. I watch as she leans her little head against her mom’s shoulder, but doesn’t take her eyes off me. She is shy.
“Angel.” I choke out as she walks towards me. I keep my eyes on the little beauty as she watches me. I smile at her, but she hides her face away. My heart sinks. She doesn’t know who I am.
“Savage.” Her tone is anything but friendly. Not like how she used to call my name. No, that tone is long gone, and it’s my fault.
“Care for a drink?” she asks, and I shake my head as she moves to the bar and 0rders a soda. This is awkward. I catch my little girl peeking at me and I smile at her, but she hides again. Good girl, never speak to strangers. Even though I shouldn’t be a stranger to her but I am. That thought pierces my heart. She took my kid and had no intention of me ever knowing about her.
“Shall we sit down?” I nod my head as she walks past me to the booth and sits down. She places our daughter on her lap as the bar maid brings toys for her to play with.
“Thanks Coral. I will speak to you later on.” She says, dismissing her and we just look at each other. The atmosphere is palpable.
“What is her name?” I break the awkward stare off we are having. Angel bits her 1ip and looks at me.
“Rebel Carlotta Moretti. She has not long turned two years old.” She says, and I nod my head at her. I test her name on my togue Rebel. She looks up at her mom after hearing her name.
“Down.” she says and my soul leaves my body listening to her innocent little voice. Angel chuckles and kisses her on her head.
“Not right now, baby. Soon ok?” she says so softly to her and Rebel nods her little head and goes back to playing.
“So, how have you been?”
“I am not here to discuss pleasantries with you, Savage. How did you find out? I mean, I’m surprised you are even here.” She bites out. I shiver at the gaze coming from her.
“When you ran away, you mother and father called an emergency meeting. They knew you were qregnant and why you ran. They also had those pictures sent to them. I’m sorry I didn’t believe you, Angel.”
She scoffs, looking away, shaking her head as she shucks on her teeth and I know I have a lot of grovelling to do.
“Yeah, well, why would you? It doesn’t matter now. What’s done is done. How’s your ole lady?” she asks, and I stiffen and shake my head. I have caused this damage and I need to fix it.
“I don’t have one. I rescinded my claim on her after I found her in a compromising position. She was never preqnant.” She rolls her eyes and stifles a laugh.
“No, really, shocking.” She says sarcastically as she drinks her soda.
“Look, I know, drop the attitude. You should have told me, but instead you ran away and kept her from me!” I snap at her, which causes her to place the glass down calmly, and I gulp as she watches me.
“What do you want, Savage?” she asks like she is bored with me, which I know she isn’t. She thinks she can act all tough, but I know her. I know she is not like this. Angel is kind, gentle, loving. She is the purest person I know. So seeing her like this is like a dagger to my heart.
“You are both coming back with me. I Ryder ‘Savage’ Jackson, president of the Princes of Darkness MC. Claim you both as mine.” Her eyes widen before she laughs out loud, shaking her head. Wiping her tears from her eyes and Rebel laughs too. The sound is beautiful. Rebel claps because her mom is laughing.
“Ohhh, Savage, Savage, Savage. Nice try. You see, you can’t claim us. I am a Moretti and that trumps whatever you have just tried to do. Does my father no not my father? Does my momma know you are the reason her only daughter fled?” Now I laugh at her, which causes her to stop dead as she watches me.
“Hate to beak it to you, princess, but yes, they do. I got a beating and a lovely scar on my leg from the bu11et she shot at me. They also know I have found you both. You Angel Maria Moretti are coming with me. Whether I have to drag you kicking and screaming. You have run for too long, princess.”
Her eyes widen and I smirk like a smug fricker. No running away now.
“Fine, we will go back. But I won’t be stepping foot in your clubhouse. I will go home with her and we can arrange visitation. I will not have her around your club or the women you have there. Take it or leave it, Ryder. Because from where I am sitting you are lucky to be alive,” she says and I laugh out loud at that. Oh, man, she doesn’t get it.
“What’s funny? Those are the terms. We are nothing, Ryder, and we will never be again. This is about her and her only. I don’t care about you or your club. She is my priority and if I say she isn’t to be around your club and b1tches, then that is what will happen or you can walk away now and forget you ever saw her.” She bites out and I stop laughing and growl at her.
“I have claimed you both, so I’m sorry to break it to you, Angel. But you are both coming back to with me, and that’s final. Your mom and dad are aware of this. They will be meeting us there in two day’s time. So get with the programme. You won’t be staying in the clubhouse. You have your own house ready for you both to move it. Yes, they move fast and you know this,” I tell her and she stands up with Rebel in her arms.
“Screw you!” She glares down at me before she turns and walks out of the bar. Rebel waves her little hand at me over her mom’s shoulder and I wave back, giving her a little wink.
She won’t get away from me that easily. Whether she likes it or not, I always get what I want. Oh Angel, you have no idea who you are playing with, princess.
I pull my phone from my pocket and dial the one person who will bring her in and she will hate me for it, but I need the big guns to tame her. She was never like this and I know I’ve said this before. She is now fierce and stubborn. She is acting like a spoilt little rich girl.
“Give her time, whatever you did, give her time. She has never acted like this before.” The bar maid says as she picks up the empty glass and toys. I nod my head as I watch the door.
“Please tell me she is coming home?”
“She is stubborn and has refused. She is playing hardball.”
“Leave her to me.” the call ends and I sigh before I pocket the phone and walk out to my bike. I see her car driving in the direction of her home. Putting my helmet on, I straddle my bike and start her up",1,1756799648.0,u_HeadWriting4825,0,1.0,False

*Where pitching meets perseverance, and nutrition meets chaos.*

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

The odds favor the **Saitama Seibu Lions** as a clear -1.5-run favorite on the spread, with moneyline odds hovering around **1.65-1.69** (implied probability: \~60%). The **Rakuten Eagles** sit at +2.15-2.25 (implied \~44-47%), reflecting bookmakers’ skepticism. The total is set at **5.5 runs**, with the **Under** slightly more enticing (odds: 1.77-1.85) than the Over (1.76-2.05).

Key stat: Seibu’s implied win probability edges Rakuten by 15-20%. But here’s the twist: Seibu’s star pitcher, **Kazuhiro Nishikawa**, just returned from a shoulder injury and has been *batting .417* in second-team games. Yes, you read that right—**a pitcher hitting like a leadoff hitter**. It’s like watching a toaster win a baking contest.

---

### 2. Digest the News: Injuries, Comebacks, and Sushi Menus

**Seibu Lions**: Nishikawa’s return is a plot twist even *Shakespeare* wouldn’t script. A pitcher sidelined by shoulder pain, then crushing 5-for-12 at the plate? Manager Nishikawa (yes, same name) hopes he can “bring back the momentum from the early part of the season.” Let’s hope he doesn’t trip over his own shoelaces again—last time, it was a trip to the injured list.

**Rakuten Eagles**: They’re serving up more than baseball. Their new **NANAO POWER FOOD** menu—crafted by nutritionist Kongoji Maiki—is a post-earthquake love letter to local Noto Peninsula produce. Players will fuel up on “balanced nutrition” before games, though one wonders if “local specialties” include something called *Wasabi Energy Buns*. Their mascot, **Wakutamakun**, will also make appearances, which is either charming or a distraction, depending on whether you’ve had coffee.

**Honorable Mention**: Atsushi Nagai, the Shinetsu Club’s gritty Urban Baseball hero, proves you can’t keep a

Hey there Boot People,
I hope y'all are doing well.
I wondered if you could help me find a boot fitting the following description: Relatively affordable, fast lace system, similar in appearance to a modern combat boot (my employer issues meindls and haix scouts, however allows for similar privately purchased footwear, so a brown or black, relatively short boot with a roundish silhouette would be preferable, classic jungle boots for example have a to different silhouette).
It would also need to be available on the european market and/ or through a drop shipping website. 
They don't need to be anything special, I just want them for indoor days where comfortably and quickly getting into them before I've had my first coffee is top priority😅
Also I do not like zippers on footwear.

1n6dfqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/woocommerce/comments/1n6dfqy/coffee_subscription_with_qr_code_checkin_how_to/,Coffee subscription with QR code check-in – how to set this up?,"Hi everyone,

I’m working on a project for a client who wants to sell a coffee subscription through their WooCommerce store. The idea is simple:

* A customer buys a subscription online (using WooCommerce Subscriptions).
* Each order generates a unique QR code (or barcode).
* The customer can either print it out or store it on their phone.
* When they come to the physical store with their mug and QR code, the staff scans it to check if the subscription is active.

What I’m trying to figure out is:

* Is there a way to achieve this using the standard **WooCommerce Subscriptions** plugin (maybe with some add-ons)?
* Or do I need to look at a different plugin/solution to generate and validate QR codes tied to subscriptions?

Basically, I need a system that links a customer’s subscription status to a scannable code for in-store verification.

Has anyone done something similar or can recommend a good approach/plugin combo?

sync licensing: $800 (one placement in a small film) international collections: $320 bandcamp/direct sales: $240 live performance: $90 (one small show)

**what surprised me:** performance royalties were way higher than expected. apparently coffee shops and restaurants pay ascap/bmi when they play music, and those payments add up. found this out through mogul music which tracks all the collection society payments automatically.

international money was also a surprise. my music somehow ended up on radio in canada and australia. would never have known without proper tracking since those payments come through different societies.

**the tedious part:** registering with all the different collection societies took forever. ascap, bmi, soundexchange, plus international ones like socan and apra. mogul royalties helped streamline some of this but there's still a lot of manual paperwork involved.

**unexpected costs:** distributor fees, publishing administration, collection society memberships. ate up about 20% of total revenue. factor this in when budgeting releases.

**lessons learned:** streaming pays pennies but performance royalties can be meaningful. international markets matter even for small artists. proper registration is essential - money doesn't find you, you have to claim it.

I moved back to Ahmedabad a couple of months ago after spending over a decade in the US. While living as a bachelor in my 30s here has its challenges, I’m an old-school guy, so my lifestyle and approach might be a bit different from the usual crowd.

* **Making friends isn’t easy** – Everyone seems caught up in work, family, or their old circles. Breaking in and building genuine connections at this stage is harder than I expected. I’d love to meet people who enjoy thoughtful conversations and exchanging life experiences.
* **Neighbors & stereotypes** – Even when a couple of friends stay over on weekends, people assume the usual “US-return bachelor” lifestyle: parties and loud music. Some neighbors even asked flat owner (my dad), *“Who is he and why did you rent it to a bachelor?”* — little did they know it’s actually my own flat! Dad, being chill as ever, told me, *“It’s your first hands-on experience managing a house yourself, just keep things cordial and don’t overthink it.”* For context, I’m into spirituality, follow a vegetarian diet, non-smoker, non-drinker, and while I enjoy music, never at the cost of disturbing neighbors.
* **Awkward social misunderstandings** – Casual chats at a café about work sometimes get misread as “approaching for a date.” Nope. I genuinely enjoy conversations about life, work, or hobbies—just connecting with people.
* **Community gap** – I’d love to join a coding/tech community, but finding like-minded folks offline isn’t easy. At one point, I even thought of sitting in a café with the best coffee, putting up a small A4 note saying, *“Let’s talk for an hour about what you do and life — free coffee on me.”* But I quickly realized Amdavadis won’t miss a free treat 😅 so maybe it wouldn’t work.
* **Some positives** – Despite the challenges, it’s been nice to feel closer to family, celebrate festivals, and explore other states. I like using my Gujarati accent—it adds a local touch to everyday life.

Not really a rant, more of an observation. Curious if others in a similar boat (returnees, bachelors in their 30s, or anyone starting over) feel the same. How did you navigate this phase?",8,1756799483.0,ahmedabad,1,1.0,False

I don’t know where else to put it without sounding like a lunatic. If this gets deleted – fine, so be it. If you think I’m paranoid, please say so plainly.

My name is Daniel, a 36-year-old divorced accountant. Two kids, Noah (10) and Grace (7). I have them every Wednesday and every other weekend. I’m not dumb, I’m not dramatic, I don’t drink, and I didn’t used to be the kind of person who checks the window lock twice at 3 a.m.

I keep telling myself I started this. I made the call.

But it was nothing. That’s the part that makes me want to throw up: it was nothing. Someone scratched my car – with keys, I think – three vertical scratches on the driver’s door. There was also a folded paper under the wiper that said, “keep quiet.” No name, no signature. I don’t even have anyone to “keep quiet” about. I do spreadsheets for mid-market manufacturing firms. The loudest thing I do is yell at QuickBooks.

Nonetheless, I had Noah and Grace that night. They were asleep in their room (my two-bed rental), and in my head it spun out: ‘what if someone had tried the door?’ What if someone was watching us? It was late, and my ex-wife, Natalie, would have told me to be sensible and go to bed, but I wanted to be responsible. Be the kind of dad who doesn’t shrug off weird notes.

So I called the non-emergency number. They said they’d send someone if there was a car free. Twenty minutes later, there was a tap at my door and a man with a warm smile and a police hat.

“Evening, Dan,” he said. The name snapped me to attention. I hadn’t told him my name yet. “Officer Michael Green, but everyone calls me Mike.”

He shook my hand, very firm and kind of warm. He smelled like clean wool and coffee; I don’t even know why I remembered that. My heart rate dropped. I don’t know how to explain it, but he radiated ‘handled.’ Like, you know, if a fight broke out in a coffee shop, he’d stand and everything would go quiet. I felt stupidly grateful.

We walked down to my car and he shone his torch and took some photos. He picked up the paper with two fingers – like they do in movies – and asked, “Anything come to mind that’d make someone want to rattle you?”

“I do taxes,” I replied simply, and he laughed once, like a short warm bark.

He was very nice to my kids when they shuffled into the hall in their pyjamas to see who was at the door. He immediately went down to a knee like kids were his native language and said, “I’m just helping your dad make sure everything’s safe. Back to bed, okay? Big day tomorrow.”

They were starry-eyed. When I tucked them back in, Grace whispered, “Daddy, he looks like a superhero.”

“He’s a good guy,” I whispered back, and I meant it.

At the end of the night he gave me a white business card and then scribbled his cell on the back. “If anything feels off, call this number,” he said. “Dispatch can be quite slow. I’d rather you woke me. You’ve got kids. You did the right thing.”

And it may sound hilarious and maybe even embarrassing, but that line – ‘you did the right thing’ – I don’t know. It went through me like a heat pad on a bruised muscle. After the divorce, there’s always this specific kind of shame I carry around – like I’m made of thin glass. Natalie never meant to make me feel small, but in the end we did that to each other anyway. So hearing that I’d done something right from someone like him, someone who seemed like what I think of as an actual man – it was embarrassing how much it mattered to me in that moment.

He winked at me. “Get some sleep, Dan. I’ll swing by tomorrow and make sure your car’s here.”

“Thanks,” I said, and again, I meant that one too.

For the first week it felt like being looked after by a friendly neighbour who happened to wear a uniform.

He called the next afternoon just to “check the temperature” – his phrase. “How’re the kids? Everybody eating?” He said it like he knew the answer would be “yes,” but asking was the point.

Two days later, when I got home from a client meeting, there was a brown paper bag on my doormat with a bottle of Coke, granola bars, and a small note: ‘You forget to eat when you’re stressed. – M.’ I actually laughed. I texted a photo to my friend Pete and he texted back, “kinda weird but also extremely nice??” I texted Natalie that someone from the department had been really helpful and she wrote back, saying: “see? there are good people.”

When I had the kids that Wednesday, a cruiser idled on the curb out front for about twenty minutes. After bath time, Noah pressed his face to the blinds and whispered, “He’s watching over us.” It made me choke a little. I waved at the dark windshield, and the headlights actually blinked twice.

“Coincidence,” I said, laughing slightly, and he smiled and said, “I’m everywhere,” and it was obviously a joke, obviously, but I thought about it later while watching TV, and it didn’t feel like a joke when it echoed.

He remembered things I didn’t even remember telling him: my usual run time (I jog sometimes around the park at 6:30 when I don’t have the kids), Grace’s dentist appointment, that I put spinach on scrambled eggs. Sounds weird written out, but it flattered me. I felt like I was being seen.

“I wish I had your calm,” I told him once, and he squeezed my shoulder and said: “You’ve got it. You just forget it when it matters. That’s what I’m for.”

It sounds like flirting typed out, but it didn’t feel that way. It felt paternal. That’s the part that gets me. He was like a dad to me, except we were the same age.

The first time I felt something slip was so small I almost ignored it. He stopped by on a Tuesday, said he was nearby, and I let him in and offered some coffee. He did a walk-through like it was a rental open house. “Windows latch okay? Deadbolt flush?” He lifted the bathroom window – latched – and set it back down. He looked in the kids’ room but hadn’t touched anything.

“Everything’s right.” He said the words like it was a blessing. “Everything’s right.”

He left. Ten minutes later I realised I hadn’t used my key when I came home. I had buzzed my own intercom, which is something I never do. The door had been unlocked when I got upstairs.

I texted him: “hey, did I leave the door open?”

His reply came instantly: “I saw it was unlocked. I just pushed it shut so it wouldn’t swing open. Call me if you want me to run by and get it checked again.”

Reasonable. Kind. My chest was tight, but not with fear. With shame, mostly, because he was doing so much and I had left the door open.

Next Friday I came home early (the client had cancelled). The apartment smelled like coffee and lemon cleaner. Mr. Green was in the kitchen, sleeves rolled up, leaning over the window latch.

“I knocked,” he said, and lifted his left hand so I could see my spare key between his fingers. “Your landlord gave me a set in case you weren’t home. We had a report of someone rattling mailboxes on the block.”

I think my face made a shape I couldn’t control. He read it and softened. “I should’ve texted first, Dan. That’s on me. It’s on me.”

“It’s okay,” I said. “I appreciate you. Really. It’s… weird, but I appreciate it.”

He looked directly at me like we were in a meeting room. “Weird is okay. You’re a dad under stress. I’d rather be a little weird and have you alive than give you space and come to regret it.”

I nodded, and I… kinda meant it. But that evening when I put the kids to bed and went to brush my teeth, I looked at the fogging mirror and the words ‘weird is okay’ wrote themselves there without steam.

You can call this the moment where objectivity completely left. I told Natalie I was going to keep the kids with her for a while. “Just until everything settles,” I said, and she said, “What is ‘everything,’ Dan? A keyed car? Some nice cop checking on you too much?” We escalated. We always do. I get self-righteous and she gets cold. But then she surprised me: she said, “Look. If you want, let’s have coffee tomorrow. No sniping. I’ll listen.”

So we met at the quiet bakery by the elementary school. She took my hand and said, “Tell me this ‘everything’.” And I did. I told her about the calls and the bag of snacks and the landlord key and the feeling that my perimeter had changed shape and it wasn’t mine at all anymore.

She listened. She’s always been excellent at that, unlike me. She did this thing with her mouth where she presses her lips together tight and nods when she’s aligning her empathy with her scepticism.

When I finished, she squeezed my hand and said, so gently, “That’s exactly what Mr. Green told me you’d say.”

I pulled my hand back and just shockingly asked, “What?”

She didn’t flinch. “He came by on Wednesday. We talked. He said you might start feeling hemmed in because of the trauma. He said you’d feel like he was everywhere because you’re thinking about him. ‘Availability bias,’ he said.” She said the last words like she owned them. “He said you might feel watched, and that you might send the kids back to me, and that if that happened, I should keep things calm and not let you spiral.”

“Natalie,” I said, quietly, “he told you what I would say before I said it.”

“Yes,” she said, and smiled a sad but still kind smile that made me feel like a child. “Because that’s what happens. It’s normal. He’s good at this, Dan. He’s trying to protect you from yourself until it’s over.”

I walked home that day with my spine frozen. I almost texted him to say thank you for caring enough to talk to her, and then I didn’t, because some pocket of me had lit on fire. Knowing what I would say doesn’t make you wise, I’d thought – it makes you the author.

That night there was a break-in.

I woke to the soft wrong sound of a screw in the wood. I sat up and listened and heard the window in the living room whining on its old sash. Something flexed, then gave. I didn’t grab a weapon – I didn’t have any – I just grabbed my phone.

I called Mike’s number, of course I did. Two rings, “Dan. I’m here. Don’t move.”

I lay on the floor beside my bed like a child hiding from a thunderstorm. My hands shook so bad I could hear the bones in my wrists clicking.

Footsteps. A shape. A man in a hood, a hand gloved around a crowbar. He pushed my bedroom door open, and the hallway light made a halo around him – I just said “no no no” in a whisper, and then there was a crash and a shout. Officer Green was there, bursting in, tackling the masked man in a slow-motion documentary way, clean and vicious and fluid, cuffing him like he’d practiced on a CPR dummy a thousand times; which I guess he had.

“Breathe,” he said to me while the man on the floor moaned. He didn’t look at me when he said it. He said it to the room, I felt like he did. Repeating, “Breathe, Dan.”

So I breathed. This is the part I hate admitting because it makes everything that comes after look ungrateful, but: I just cried like a child. I put my face in my hands and cried it all, and he let me. The man on the floor swore and tried to kick him, but Green didn’t look angry. He looked like he was made out of iron.

When it was over, when the other officers had taken the handcuffed man down the stairs and everyone’s radios had stopped crackling my name, Green took me to the kitchen and made some tea like it was his kitchen; like he knew where the mugs were, which I think he did.

He slid the mug to me and touched my wrist. “You were right to call me,” he said. “You did everything right,” and I hated this phrase so much now.

But I still managed to say, “Thank you. I’m sorry if I seemed suspicious about you. I’m sorry, Mike.” The shame of it flooded me. The suspicion about the key and the shoulder, snacks, kids, all of it.

“I could feel offended,” he said, smiling softly, “but I know you, Dan. I get you. Trauma makes your world seem small. You try to control the people in it, and it’s just my job not to take it personally. It’s my job to be around.”

I believed him. Of course I did. I slept sitting up on the couch with my hands together like I was praying, and his car idled downstairs in the bluish light. And I felt safe for the first time in weeks.

The next morning I called Natalie to tell her what had happened and to say, if she maybe wanted to bring the kids to see me (not to stay – God, no – just to see), that it was safe now, because it was over. They had caught him.

Her number rang once and then a recorded voice said, “For safety reasons, and with the recommendation of Officer Michael Green, I’m not accepting calls from Daniel at this time. Please contact the department if this is urgent.”

I hung up and pulled the phone away and stared at it like it was a bug under glass. I tried again. Same message. I texted ‘please’ and the message immediately turned green and said not delivered.

I called 911, because what else do you do when you don’t know what to do. The dispatcher answered with a practiced calm that took me back to the first night. I said my name and she said, “Hold a moment, Mr. Hart,” and then there was a clunk that felt like a throat clearing and a different voice said, “You’re panicking again, Dan. Just breathe.”

“Did you… did you just transfer me to him?”

“This is a flagged case,” Green said. “It routes to me when your number comes up because I’m your point. That way you don’t have to tell it to three different people. You’re all covered.”

“You blocked my wife from me,” I said, and hated how small my voice sounded.

“Your ex-wife. I asked her to set a boundary while we get things quiet,” he said eventually. “You call from a place of fear and then you escalate. It’s not good for the kids to hear. You can talk in a couple of days.”

“What about the man from last night? What’s his name? Is there a case number? I want to know!”

“There’s a case number,” he said. “It’s in intake with the District Attorney, so it won’t be public. The booking’s sealed because of the overlap with other local cases. I’ll bring you the incident log.”

“Bring it? No. I’ll just come to the station.”

“I’d rather you stayed home this week,” he said. The tone had changed, and I only recognised it since my father used to lower his voice exactly one step when he wanted to end an argument without ending it. “It’s a bad week. Crime ticks up when the weather snaps. I’ll bring what you need. You’re better off inside your apartment.”

He did bring the papers, though. He wore an expression I can only call ‘clinical compassion.’ He showed me a one-page printout that had my address and the time and possible burglary in progress and one male detained and a blank where a name would be. Before I’d even ask, he said, “I know that blank looks like a void,” and smiled like it was a joke, “but it’s temporary. We’re good. You’re good.”

I put the paper on the table and looked at his hands. They were big, the nails neatly trimmed. He had an old scar at the base of his thumb, a pale semi-circle.

That afternoon a box arrived with my name on it, and inside were cans of soup, protein bars, and a fleece blanket that smelled faintly of someone else’s laundry. There was a note: ‘Let me carry this for a week. I’ll take the best care of you. – M.’

When he came back by that night I finally had the audacity to say: “Did you stage it?”

I had planned to say it like a statement, with an accusation’s stupid little chin – but it came out with my voice breaking on the ‘did.’

He didn’t blink, didn’t flare. He just sat down on my couch and set his hat on his knee and said, “I could’ve felt very offended by that, you know. But I know you, Dan. This is how our minds cope. They can’t reconcile the idea that something really almost happened, so they look for a more controllable story. That’s alright.” He tapped the printout on my table. “Here’s the CAD log. Ms. Halvorsen in 3B called 911 at 01:17. Check her doorbell camera. She told me she’d share the footage if you want to see it. We arrived at 01:19. My body cam was on the whole time. I can’t release that without a request, but it exists. You’re not crazy. You were in danger. I’m here.”

It was too perfect. Every sentence had a blanket around it. I could hear the rustle of it when he spoke. I wanted to yell anyway. I wanted to say, ‘Then why can’t I find it online?’ But I had checked, and he had an answer ready for that: ‘because it’s sealed for now.’ I wanted to say, ‘Then why did my wife block me, why didn’t she text me herself,’ and he had an answer ready for that too: ‘because it’s calmer for the kids if you calm through me.’

Every objection I raised, he set down gently on a shelf and labelled it. He never said I was wrong. He never raised his voice. He said things like, “It’s okay for you to feel that way” and “This is the part where you want to run” and “We’re going to ride this out together.”

I hated him for being so right about me.

I hated me for needing him.

Two days after the break-in, he stopped doing the friendly wave from the street. He just sat in the car, engine on, headlights off, watching my window with that forward lean that cops have like they’re about to stand up into the world. When I peeked through the blinds at 3:12 a.m., he was there. When I peeked at 4:27, still there. When I woke at 6:00, still.

I went to work the next morning because I’m not a ghost. HR called me within an hour, saying, “We heard about your situation,” her voice being so smooth just like Green’s. And of course, she said, “Officer Green reached out to recommend a wellness week. We’ll mark you as paid sick leave. Take care of yourself.”

“But I didn’t authorise that,” I said.

“We’re here to support you,” she said, “we value your well-being more.”

When I got home there was another box on the mat. This one had a toothbrush, razor, and deodorant. The note said, ‘Sometimes brushing helps. Eat. Shower. Small things. – M.’

I put the note in the drawer and found it again twenty minutes later on the table without remembering I’d put it there. That scared me more than anything else.

I started talking to myself, just under my breath, just to make some sound. I made lists out loud of what was real. “Noah is ten. Grace is seven. The car is a Honda. The couch is gray. The man outside is a police officer.” If I said “the man outside is a police officer” enough times in a row, the words stopped being words and became a chant.

I thought about walking downstairs and telling him to go home. To go home to his own kids (did he have them, though? he never said). I thought about telling him I needed him to step back. Then I pictured him tilting his head and saying, “You’re pushing the help away, Dan.”

I tried calling Natalie again. Straight to that recorded message. For safety reasons…

I called 911 again, and again, got him. He said, “Dan, the more you call, the more this becomes the story. Let’s keep this quiet. You’re alright. I’m right here.”

“Are you right…” I said, and hung up before he could reach through the phone with his calm.

That night, the lights flickered. It was a storm. It was nothing. But in the flicker I saw his silhouette through the curtains: him not moving, not checking his phone, not looking away. Waiting for the entire world to calm down. Just looking straight into my window.

I couldn’t take it anymore. I couldn’t take being protected. This was getting more and more insane.

I waited until Sunday morning when everyone’s attention was elsewhere. At 6:45 a.m. he finally took his thermos and got out of the car and walked toward the corner for reasons I will never know; not that I really want to. So I slipped into jeans, shoved my wallet in my backpack, and went down the back stairs through the laundry room where the lock sticks. I had planned to drive, but, being honest, the very idea of him seeing me turn the ignition made me anxiously nauseous. So I just tried to walk as fast as I could. I walked like a man late for a bus – not too suspicious, and not wasting any second. I turned my phone off, and turned it on again, then turned it off again, and finally threw it in a trash bin because the sound of even the possibility of it ringing made my skin crawl.

I cut through the alley behind the bakery where Natalie and I had sat and talked about ‘availability bias’. I walked to the bus stop and got on the first one without looking where it went. It went to the transit centre. I bought a ticket with cash and got on the first regional train. The whole time my mouth kept making the shape of sorry.

On the train I was sure every man in a dark jacket was a cop. I was sure every woman was Natalie pretending not to cry. I was sure every kid was mine recognising me and being told not to wave.

You can laugh at that. It’s okay. I would have laughed a year ago.

In the next city I found some random motel that disgustingly smelled like wet carpet and cigarettes. I slept there for two hours with one shoe on. I woke up and ate some crisps from a vending machine, and then – you may call it as stupid as possible, but what would you do being in my place – I went to the police station because what else do you do when you’re running from the police? Who else do you go to when you need to say the sentence I needed to say: ‘Please make a police officer stop protecting me.’

The front desk officer was younger than me. She listened. She didn’t interrupt. She took notes. “I’m not here to make any trouble,” I said. “I just want to be like… I want to be a person inside my own perimeter.”

“That makes sense, sir,” she said, and I swear to God, I almost cried at those four words. ‘That makes sense, sir.’ She typed a little more, and asked, “What’s the officer’s name?”

“Officer Michael Green,” I said, and spelled it like it might be a trick word.

She typed. She looked up. She looked down. She took the breath you take when you’re going to say something that will make a person think you hate them when you don’t – and I already knew exactly what she was going to say, for Christ’s sake.

“Mr. Hart,” she said – using my last name felt so weird from her – “Officer Green has already briefed us about your case. He said you might come here confused. You’re paranoid and traumatised. Don’t worry – he’s handling you.”

I started laughing. There were three laughs and then a sound came out of me I didn’t know was in there. I just said, “He’s here?”

She didn’t answer because she didn’t need to. The door opened like a quiet stage cue and he walked in with his hat in his hands, not looking victorious, not looking anything – just looking like he always does; like the weather. And behind him, so small because the room was big and echoey, were my kids.

“Uncle Mike!” Grace shouted, and ran to him, and in that moment I understood that he was not ‘Uncle Mike’ to them, he was just ‘Mike’, and the word ‘uncle’ had attached itself like a barnacle because you need a word for a thing.

Natalie stood in the doorway with her fingers around her purse strap. She looked tired, and kind, and resigned. She looked like a woman who has had exactly enough drama for one lifetime and will take no more. She nodded at me like you do at someone who has said something difficult in a conference.

I said, “How are you even here,” but the question did not end with a question mark. It was a sigh.

Green set his hat on the counter and put his hand on my shoulder, not too heavy, not light, like a thing being put back where it belonged. “See, Dan?” he said in the voice he uses when he wants the world to sit down. “You don’t have to be afraid anymore. I’ve got you.”

I almost threw up on the words ‘I’ve got you’. I looked at the young officer and at Natalie and at my kids and at the hat on the counter and at the notch of a scar at the base of his thumb and at the fluorescent light whining above us and at the paperwork on a clipboard that probably had my name on it and I felt something that wasn’t fear, not exactly. It was like I’d been arguing with a mirror for six weeks and only just realised it.

I said, not to him but to the air because speaking directly to him is like talking to your own reflection and expecting it to go first, “What if I asked to have a different officer.”

“That’s not how it works, Dan,” he said gently. “You’re flagged as a high-risk victim. It’s best practice to have one point of contact. Too many voices make you spin. I am your voice.”

“Am I a victim?” I asked, but my voice cracked on the ‘am’ – and that was the whole answer.

He squeezed my shoulder, looked at the younger officer and she looked down at her keyboard, and I understood: looking down is a kind of loyalty. He looked at Natalie and she nodded minutely. He looked at Grace and Noah, and they climbed up on the bench and swung their legs because kids don’t care about the shape of a man’s soul. They care whether the adults are calm.

I know how this reads. I can hear the parts where my brain is an unreliable narrator. I know I asked for this. I called that stupid number and said, ‘please help me’ and the man arrived who knows how to arrange a life in rows and columns. If this is paranoia, it is very organised.

If this is protection, it’s the kind that turns a person into a room so that other people stand in and decide how to arrange the furniture.

He drove me home. He had already checked me in. He had already told my employer I would be out another week (“we all agreed it was for the best”). He had already bought the groceries I like. He had remembered the spinach.

When we pulled to the curb he turned off the engine and didn’t look at me. He looked at the building like he was measuring it.

“I’m going to ask you something and I want you to answer without explaining,” he said. “Do you want to be safe?”

“Yes,” I said, because who says no to that.

“Then let me carry this,” he said. “You do the small things. Brush your teeth. Eat. Breathe. I’ll take the rest. I know you, Dan. I’m here.”

I’m posting this now because my phone is back, and my calls to 911 go straight to him. My calls to Natalie go to a recording, as well as all my other friends – he says that’s good for the kids and me; and the sergeant in a different city says it’s good for me – and every ‘I’ in this paragraph feels like an exaggeration. I can’t tell if the break-in was a play. I can’t tell if Ms. Halvorsen even exists – I’ve lived here eighteen months and my neighbours are email addresses. I can’t tell if I’m seated in the theatre or on the stage. I can’t tell which details are small and which are the whole story.

He is outside now. He is parked under the tree. He is not looking at his phone. He is not looking away.

If you think I’m paranoid, tell me. Be honest. If you think I’m right, tell me that too. I don’t know which answer would calm me, but I think, maybe, it would help if someone – other than Mike – told me ‘you did the right thing’ or ‘you did not’. I would like to be a person inside my perimeter again. I would like to know where the perimeter is.

But by now, I have exceeded my phone limit.",4,1756799446.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1n6de5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1n6de5v/code_pink/,Code pink,"The hospital air conditioning was a relentless, low hum, a sound I’d come to associate with pure, unadulterated exhaustion. It was 2:31 a.m., the dead of my 24-hour shift at St. Anthony’s Children's Hospital. As a third-year med student, I was on overnight to help the resident with any new admits that would come in. Tonight was a night like any other filled with tasteless coffee and the dull glow of my computer screen as I typed the latest note and reviewed some lab results. I stared at my fingers as I typed away. The edges of each finger were worn from my nervous chewing and scanned over the small reddish, star shaped birthmark between my thumb and forefinger as I picked up my coffee for the next sip to get me through the night. 

So far my rotation has been a mundane, if demanding, blur of rounding, note writing, and the constant dread of presenting patients to my attending . The children's hospital had a specific kind of quiet at this hour—not a peaceful quiet, but the heavy, tense silence of a building holding its breath. The only interruptions were the soft beeping of monitors and the occasional, unsettling rustle from a sleeping child’s bed.

A piercing, three-tone chime echoed through the hospital's PA system, followed by a voice, flat and unhurried. “Attention all staff. Code Pink, third floor, room 323. Repeat, Code Pink, third floor, room 323.”

In the hospital, we have drills for every possible emergency: Code Blue (when a patient becomes unresponsive, their heart stops beating, or they start having serious breathing problems i.e. an emergency response to a life-threatening emergency), Code Grey ( when a family member or patient becomes aggressive and needs security intervention), and the one that always raised the hair on my arms, Code Pink, when an infant is abducted. 

Unfortunately, in the hospital I’ve heard Code Pink over the intercom dozens of times, usually when a family member would step outside of the room with a patient and the nurses couldn’t find them. Everytime we’d go through the same grim dance of locking down doors and searching every square foot only to find that the patient was in the bathroom or just getting a snack at the vending machines.
My heart hammered against my ribs. I froze, my fingers hovering over the keyboard. My supervising resident, Dr. Chen, seemed unbothered. “That’s the fifth one this week”, she exclaimed with a sigh. “I really wish the nurses would just keep an eye on their patients and stop interrupting everyone's work”, she said calmly. Room 323 was one our admitted patients signed out to our team earlier in the night. I did not know much about this particular patient besides that they were here for a respiratory problem and needed a few days in the hospital. “Sol, can you please go chat with the team and figure out if you need me”, she declared before going back to putting in orders on her computer. 


Security alarms blared as magnetic locks slammed into place on every door, sealing the unit. A Code Pink meant a full lockdown. A group of nurses and two security guards were all huddled around the front desk. The charge nurse robotically called out the description of the patient, “18 month old male named Tommy, here for RSV bronchiectasis who was planned to go home tomorrow. Last seen in his room at 1:35 AM when nurse Jackie was doing a vitals check. The patient’s mom was in the room asleep and awoke at 2:30 but they were gone.” She gave everyone as much detail as she could and the search was on. “I think this might be real, so please be on the lookout for anything out of the ordinary. No one gets in, and no one gets out until we find him.”
The usual playful drawings on the walls seemed to sneer in the flickering red light. The hall felt unnaturally long, the silence between our hurried footsteps oppressive. My mind, usually a fortress of medical knowledge, was a panicked, useless jumble. 

We searched room by room, checking beneath every blanket, inside every closet. The patient’s mom, already on edge, was being quietly comforted by nurses, their terrified eyes darting around as if a boogeyman were about to leap from the shadows. The patient had been in his room, just down the hall from where the alarm rang. The mom had dozed off for a few minutes and when the nurse came for her check the child was gone. I stepped into the room and immediately noticed a small, hand-knitted blanket, folded neatly on his empty bed, one that didn't belong to the hospital. The magnetic pull of the blanket drew me in closer and closer until I was inspecting every aspect of the cloth half expecting a small child to fall out of it. I held the blanket to my nose and recognized a scent of rose and perfume. “Is this blanket yours?” I asked the mom. “No, we were given it by a nurse when we first came to the room”, she replied. My heart sank deep into the pit of my stomach. Did someone use this blanket to mark the patient? And if so, why did they leave it behind? 

Nothing. The other groups’ searches were yielding the same. A cold dread began to settle over me. It felt like a ghost hunt. The security cameras had shown nothing. The child was simply gone. Vanished into thin air. 
Desperate, I remembered an old, unused storage closet at the end of the hall, rumored to have been sealed off years ago. It was a long shot, but I felt a strange draw toward it. I told Dr. Chen I would check it out, and she waved me on, her face drawn.

I found the door at the end of the corridor, partially obscured by a crash cart and some other equipment. The air around it felt heavy, colder than the rest of the hall. The door itself was locked with a rusted deadbolt, but a piece of the frame was splintered, a sign of recent, forced entry. I pushed on it, and it groaned open, revealing a small, dark closet filled with dusty relics from a different era of medicine: old charts, archaic monitors, and a lone, rusted filing cabinet pushed into a corner.

A cold wind seemed to sigh past my ear as I stepped inside. My flashlight beam cut through the darkness, illuminating a pile of old files. My eyes were drawn to one drawer on the filing cabinet, partially ajar, with a tab sticking out. 
My blood ran cold. I pulled it open, the screech of metal echoing in the space. Inside was a single manila folder. My hands shook as I pulled it out. I opened it and shined my phone’s flashlight on the contents. On it, in faded black marker, was a single, chilling phrase: ""CODE PINK - SOLOMON THOMAS - 1989.” 

I froze, dropping the file on the floor. For what felt like an eternity, I was paralyzed. My ears filled with blood drowning out any thought. Slowly I picked up the file and read the first page report.  The date was exactly 25 years ago, to the day. The location: St. Anthony’s Children's Hospital, pediatric wing. The subject: a male infant, abducted from his room overnight while the mother slept. The abductor, according to the notes, had never been identified and the child was never found.
My breath shortened. My eyes dropped to the second page. It was a polaroid photo of a child hand in hand with a young mother. My heart leaped into my throat. The baby in the photo had a small, reddish-brown birthmark shaped like a star. It was the same birthmark I had. 
I flipped to the last page. It was a small piece of paper, folded and taped to the file. It was a note. The handwriting was neat, almost elegant. My eyes devoured the words:

He's coming home.

A wave of nausea and dread hit me. I looked up, and the flashlight beam wavered in my trembling hand. The air in the space grew colder. A new smell filled my nostrils, not the sterile hospital aroma, but a sickly sweet scent, like old roses and cheap perfume. The door to the closet groaned shut behind me, the deadbolt clicking back into place.

A soft hum echoed from the darkness behind me, a sound like a sweet lullaby. “My sweet boy,” a whisper, so close I could feel the cold breath on the back of my neck. “It’s time to come home.”

The Guardian today identifies 'two popular theories' -- the whole hospitality industry is sufferings and negative narratives are biting into support. Personally, as a longtime vegan and former business owner, I would put forward a much more vegan-friendly major problem for vegan outlets. At one time, they were our only/major option. Now, most eateries and coffee shops offer vegan options. I can choose to eat vegan in the style I want rather than the stylised vegan restaurant fare all the time. In a mixed group, an eatery that covers everyone's needs probably wins out over purely vegan.

1n6dbf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amenorrhearecovery/comments/1n6dbf1/got_first_period_yesterday/,Got first period yesterday!,"I honestly didn’t think I was going to post here when I got my period back, but it happened yesterday and I wanted to share in case it helps anyone else on this journey.

So… background: my periods have been irregular for the past 5 years, and almost completely absent for the last 3. I moved to the UK, got super stressed trying to land (and then keep) a job in finance, and on top of that I was working out a lot more consistently and finally felt like I was getting over BED. Having more control over my eating patterns and not bingeing anymore gave me a sense of calm, but my period disappeared.

I was diagnosed with PCOS a while back, so I blamed it on that. But weirdly, when I first got the diagnosis my periods were regular. It was only when I started being “healthier” (more regimented workouts, fasting, metformin, etc.) that they stopped. Honestly, I think metformin was a big culprit.

Last year I tried going “all in,” but it backfired. It felt like I was bingeing again, I got injured, gained weight fast, and ended up really depressed. So I went back to old habits to lose weight after my first recovery period.

At the start of this year I started working with a nutritionist who had gone through FHA herself. She suggested slowly upping calories and pulling back on cardio. I actually got a period in March after a week-long vacation at home, but then nothing again. At the time, I thought eating ~2,000 calories and doing 1.5h workouts daily (with no rest days) was my “set point.” It wasn’t.

By late May I faced the truth and started increasing calories again, up to ~2,700/day (around maintenance for me). On weekdays I stuck to mostly healthy foods so I felt good working and not fatigued, but weekends were more flexible is burgers, poke, steak, ice cream, etc., without going totally off the rails. Eating more wasn’t too hard since I just added stuff like nut butters, olive oil, salmon, rice, sweet potatoes, fruit… and I always made sure to eat before workouts.

I couldn’t quit my job, so I just did my best to lower stress: being less of a perfectionist, working lighter when at home, enjoying the summer, meditating daily, writing affirmations, and doing a quick morning brain dump to clear my head. I’ve always been an anxious person, and I know stress is a big factor for me because I’d often get my period while traveling even if I wasn’t eating more.

Exercise-wise, I added one true rest day a week (just a meditative walk), cut cardio from 250+ min to ~100 min/week, and made sure it was all low heart rate. No HIIT, no super long sessions. I still lifted 5x/week, which was huge for me as it helped with an old injury, boosted self-esteem, and eating more actually made me stronger.

Other changes:
- Cut coffee from 4+ cups/day to 1–2
- Prioritized 8+ hours of sleep
- Focused on friendships and being more social

I didn’t do therapy (no time), but the Huberman Lab trauma writing protocol really helped (episode 151, Nov 2023). Basically, you write 4 times about a past trauma and how it affects you now. It def reduced my anxiety and gave me a lot of clarity.

The main thing I want to say: this process is temporary. You don’t have to eat 2,700+ calories and never exercise forever. Yes, you need to fuel your body and rest enough to recover, but after 9–12 months of consistent cycles, it is possible to carefully return to a mild deficit if you want to. I spoke with my endocrinologist and nutritionist about it, and they confirmed it’s doable. Of course, ED considerations matter, but personally I don’t struggle with that anymore and know I feel best in a slightly smaller body.

Recovery really shifts your perspective though - you start to care less about your body and more about living: time with loved ones, being social, feeling free, actually enjoying life.

Edit 1: I did gain weight but really don’t know how much - the scale does make me anxious so I decided to avoid it altogether until I get 3-6 periods. It must have been between 2-5 kgs but that’s provably highly individual - I was never underweight to start with.

She’s been my friend for years and was the one who recommended me for my current job, which I’m grateful for. When I got accepted, I even treated her to a nice meal as a thank-you, because I wanted to show my appreciation.

But lately, I’ve noticed a pattern that’s making me resent her. In our friendship, I feel like I’m putting in all the effort. She often abandons me when something “better” comes up. For example, this has happened multiple times when we’ve gone out to eat together, she was glued to her phone, and then as soon as the food arrives, she suddenly leaves because her boyfriend or another friend is coming. I end up eating alone, and it makes me feel like I’m just a placeholder until someone else is available.

At work, it’s not much better. She sometimes tries to pass her tasks on to me. When I refuse (because I’m already overloaded), she gets upset and says I’m being lazy. But the truth is my workload is huge right now. Our boss has been on sick leave for four months, so I’ve been covering a lot of his responsibilities in addition to my own. She knows exactly how much I’m doing because our team is transparent about tasks, yet she still tries to hand me hers. Meanwhile, she earns almost double my salary and constantly complains about being “the busiest person” and how she’s “living paycheck to paycheck.” But that's because she goes to concerts, vacations abroad, and spends her money on luxuries. It’s hard not to feel bitter when I’m genuinely struggling with twice the workload for half the pay, while she plays up being overworked and underpaid. I’ll admit that part of my resentment comes from jealousy too. it’s difficult to watch her earn more while I feel like I’m drowning.

Another thing that bothers me is that she can be a bit inconsiderate. I’m diabetic, and whenever it’s her turn to buy coffee or drinks, I’ve reminded her to get me sugar-free or low sugar. She often forgets or ignores it, and just brings me something I can’t really drink. It’s a small thing, but it makes me feel like she doesn’t really pay attention or care about my needs.

All of this makes me frustrated and confused about how to move forward. I appreciate that she helped me get my job, but I don’t think that should mean I have to accept whatever this is forever. I’ve even started thinking about distancing myself from her by finding another job. But I actually like this company and the work I do, so it feels unfair that I’d have to leave just because of her.

Navigating high-stakes discussions in Seef District or over lunch at a Bahrain Bay hotel, real-world experience quickly reveals the stark contrast between theory and practice. Since 2025, every large company—and, frankly, every entrepreneur with ambitions of scaling—has felt the ground shift beneath them. If you’re weighing Bahrain company formation, or recalibrating your tax strategy as an established multinational, the new DMTT is not optional reading. It’s the reality check your business model can’t escape.\
Bahrain’s Evolving Business Landscape in 2025\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting.). The government, with support from Bahrain EDB, keeps rolling out targeted incentives in areas like Bahrain Bay, Hamala, and Isa Town Tech Park, aiming straight at fintech, logistics, and renewable energy sectors.\
While the UAE continues to chase headline-grabbing skyscrapers, and Saudi Arabia leans into giga-projects, Bahrain quietly focuses on agility, regulation-lite frameworks, and access to an English-speaking talent pool. The World Bank projects 3.7% GDP growth for Bahrain in 2025, with non-oil sectors growing even faster—especially after Tamkeen’s ramped-up SME grant programs (Forbes Business).\
Speaking candidly, Bahrain’s business environment in 2025 blends modern infrastructure with old-world networking. Meetings commonly morph into informal majlis-style gatherings with sweet dates and thick qahwa, especially during Ramadan when business hours shift and patience becomes your greatest asset.\
What Is the 2025 DMTT and Why Does It Matter?\
Surprisingly, DMTT is more than an acronym. The Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax directly responds to the OECD’s “Pillar Two” initiative—a global, unified move demanding effective corporate tax rates of at least 15% for multinational enterprises (MNEs) with €750 million+ in consolidated revenue. Bahrain committed to these standards in January 2025, making DMTT effective for fiscal years beginning after June 1, 2025—a policy pivot that’s the talk of the Diplomatic Area, from law firms to auditor lobbyists.\
Key DMTT Impacts for Large Corporations:\
- If your group pays less than 15% effective tax rate locally, a top-up tax applies to the shortfall.\
- Bahraini holding companies and subsidiaries of foreign MNEs are squarely in scope—yes, even if profits are booked offshore.\
- Tax compliance, documentation, and reporting to MOICT (Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism) now rival the complexity you find in Dubai or Riyadh but with less red tape and faster governmental response times.\
This is not just a regulatory headache. It’s a real cost—affecting dividend repatriations, cross-border structures, and even wholly Bahraini-owned conglomerates above the revenue threshold.\

Bahrain Company Formation: Adapting to DMTT Requirements\
For large corporations recalibrating their structures, formation decisions in 2025 hinge on tax substance and record-keeping more than ever. If you’re exploring company formation in Bahrain, it’s imperative to align with the DMTT from day one.\
Choosing the Right Business Structure\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration.: Robust for local ventures, but now must show economic substance and real activity in Bahrain to avoid top-up taxes.\
- Closed or Public Joint Stock Companies (BSC Closed/Public): Required for listings or larger capital raises; DMTT directly affects cross-border group profits.\
- Branch or Representative Office**: Quick setup but exposed to DMTT if linked to an in-scope multinational.\
Explore in-depth entity options at Bahrain Business Type Structures.\
Ownership Models:\
- 100% foreign ownership is permitted in most sectors (full list here), and as of March 2025, even industrial free zones loosened local partner requirements (99% foreign ownership).\
Local sponsorship? Not mandatory for most corporate entities; however, knowing a plug at Tamkeen often saves weeks on approval timelines (more on sponsorship).\
DMTT Cost Implications: Hard Numbers for 2025\

- Ongoing MOICT license renewals and regulatory filings: BHD 1,000–2,500 annually\

Insider tip: Applying for your Sijilat Commercial Registration at the main MOICT building (Government Avenue, Diplomatic Area) just after morning rush (9:30-10:30 AM) consistently gets documents processed same-day—if you prep every form and skip the usual (and tedious) queuing game.\
\
One recurring mistake: Underestimating the cost and complexity of quarterly DMTT documentation. Many multinationals forget that transfer pricing files, economic substance returns, and beneficial ownership disclosures are now subject to spot audits. Engaging a strong local compliance partner saves headaches and fines.\

2. Reserve company name online via Sijilat—prepare three name options to avoid availability delays.\
3. Draft MoA/AoA to show real activity. DMTT compliance requires evidence of local operations (like a physical office, genuine employees).\
4. Secure office lease in a registered business district. Bahrain Bay, Diplomatic Area, and Seef offer fastest Sijilat approvals (and better parking—never underestimate this in Manama).\
5. Prepare all director, shareholder, and UBO passports and financial statements, ensuring translations are notarized if not in English or Arabic.\
6. Apply for Commercial Registration (CR) on Sijilat, attaching all required documentation. Optimal timing? Submit mid-week (Tuesday–Thursday) to avoid Monday post-weekend logjam.\
7. Register with LMRA for labor approvals—essential even for expat board members.\
8. Open bank accounts after CR approval; Mashreq and Bank ABC are currently fastest with MNEs, per 2025 feedback.\
Money & Time-Saving Insider Tips\
\
Avoid delays: Pre-scan and upload every document in both PDF and JPEG—MOICT tends to reject TIFF files, causing days of additional waiting.\
Free zone formation? If your group focuses on trading or logistics, free zones in Bahrain offer low-cost warehousing and tax incentives. However, DMTT may still apply at the group level, so seek expert advice.\
Bonus: Schedule key signings just before Ramadan to avoid extended approvals; government staff typically accelerate cases leading up to holidays.\
\
Compliance and Reporting: Navigating DMTT in Practice\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation.—the era of ‘brass plate’ setups is finished.\
A note of caution: In 2025, the MOICT introduced random compliance audits for large companies over BHD 10 million turnover. My own group faced a surprise review this spring; pre-organizing digital folders by compliance year and using a cloud backup meant I delivered everything within 24 hours. The audit closed with zero penalties.\
Outsource your bookkeeping unless you have a dedicated, in-house compliance team. Strong local partners help keep you audit-ready year-round.\
Support, Resources & Best Practices\
\
Alt text: Professional business support..**\
\
Prioritize face-to-face relationship building. Virtual meetings are efficient, but a gracious visit—complete with traditional coffee—often unlocks rapid document sign-offs.\
Use specialized corporate service providers for end-to-end formation and regulatory support (Keylink is a standout for large, foreign-controlled entities).\
Routinely check Gulf News and the official Bahrain government portal for regulatory updates affecting DMTT and corporate filings.\
\
Bahrain’s Unexpected Edge: A Tangent Worth Considering\
During a Ramadan soirée in Adliya (a seemingly off-topic but relevant digression), I was struck by how openly Bahraini business leaders discussed regulatory challenges—contrasted with the guarded conversations I’d encountered in Dubai or Riyadh. There’s a transparency (bordering on bluntness) that permeates everything from boardroom negotiations to post-iftar networking.\
And this is Bahrain’s hidden advantage: Real relationships, informal networking, and a willingness to adapt publicly to global best practices. When DMTT was announced, Bahrain’s business community reacted not with panic, but with pragmatic collaboration—coordinating among the EDB, corporate law firms, and major multinational players.\
What to Avoid: Common Traps in 2025\
\
Underestimating DMTT scoping. If your group’s revenue approaches the €750M threshold, prepare as if you’ll cross it. MOICT audits are unforgiving.\
Delaying compliance investments. Waiting until year-end to gather documentation is a recipe for penalties.\
Choosing the wrong office location. Parking and foot traffic might seem minor until you spend three hours trying to notarize a single document in the wrong business district. (I learned this the sweaty, stressful way—stick to Bahrain Bay or Seef when possible.)\

Yes, any entity controlled by a group with €750 million+ revenue globally is subject to the new DMTT rules—even with 100% foreign ownership. For activities with no DMTT impact, see foreign-ownership-friendly activities.\
Q2: What are the best districts for a new office if I need rapid regulatory approvals?\
Bahrain Financial Harbour, Diplomatic Area, and Bahrain Bay consistently offer faster Sijilat processing and easier coordination with government offices. Avoid older, high-traffic zones unless you have a relationship with the building’s government liaison.\
Q3: How do Bahrain’s DMTT regulations compare to UAE and Saudi Arabia?\
Bahrain’s implementation is faster and less bureaucratic but equally stringent for large MNEs. The benefit? Stronger support for economic substance and less red tape—plus more English-speaking staff at all major MOICT points of contact.\
Q4: Can I prepare for DMTT compliance alone, or should I hire a provider?\
For small, local companies: DIY is possible but risky. For large MNEs: always use a local compliance expert (see options). Mistakes lead to fines and regulatory headaches.\
Q5: Where can I find an up-to-date breakdown of company formation and DMTT costs in Bahrain?\
The latest, most detailed cost breakdown (including DMTT advisory fees) is available at Keylink’s Bahrain company formation cost guide.\
\
The 2025 DMTT isn’t merely a technical update—it reshapes every major Bahrain company’s strategic map. No matter your sector, proactive preparation, the right local alliances, and an unvarnished approach to compliance are the real keys to thriving in Bahrain’s new financial reality. And if you time that first office visit just right, with real Arabic coffee in hand, you’ll find Bahrain’s business culture is as rewarding as its regulatory environment is demanding.",1,1756798185.0,companysetupbh,1,1.0,False

Do you ever wake up, check your calendar, and think: ""How is it possible to have THIS many repetitive tasks?"" If so, you’re not alone—and I’m ridiculously excited to talk about why *business automation* is hands-down one of the MOST satisfying evolutions happening right now.

We’re not just past the days of “set and forget” email filters. With automation, we can literally orchestrate an entire workflow while we sip coffee, take meetings, and ideate. What used to take hours now magically happens in the background—it almost feels like something out of sci-fi!

Let’s break down some instantly rewarding wins you can get with automation:

- Never miss a lead: Automatically route new form fills to your CRM (and even send a friendly intro email!).
- Inventory on autopilot: Low stock triggers orders—no more emergency sticky notes on your monitor.
- Scheduling genius: Send calendar invites AND reminders without typing the same message for the thousandth time.
- Real-time analytics: Drowning in spreadsheets? Set up automated reporting and see dashboards update all by themselves.

Maybe the BEST part? Automation isn’t just for mega-corps anymore. It’s accessible. Solopreneurs and small teams are using Zapier, Make, and all sorts of no-code tools to hack together entire systems in a weekend. (I seriously get a thrill every time my “maintenance cost: zero!” automation hums along untouched.)

Another unexpected delight: freed-up mental energy. When you automate the mundane, you open up headspace to dream big, problem-solve, and actually innovate. That’s when teams go from treading water to truly soaring. Sure, some worry about robots replacing people—but IRL, I see upgrades where tedious hours are swapped for creative breakthroughs and happier teams.

So, help me out:

- What’s your “automation eureka” moment?  
- Any life-changing automations you’ve built?
- Favorite tool or integration that blew your mind?
- Stuck on an automation puzzle you want to crowd-source ideas for?

Let’s swap stories, inspire each other, and build a world where businesses are smarter—and a lot more fun to run!

1n6d1bz,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1n6d1bz/am_i_hypomanic/,Am I hypomanic?,"The last time that I know for sure that I was hypomanic was in 2019. I couldn’t stop talking incessantly to people for the life of me. I felt like I had no control over it. I’d go home and be like, why the fuck did I do that?

I am more a heavily depressed person. 

I got a text from my mum that I’m estranged from mid July. It was horrible - very abusive. Her words were ringing in my ear for a week. I spontaneously bought plane tickets to another city to shake things up and see some friends. 

The trip definitely got me in a better headspace. But, below is all that I’ve been doing since:

- Financial: donating / planning to donate too much money to people in need/ for mutual aid. Amounts I am may not be able to afford. Including offering gigs to friends in tight spots. But at this point I don’t think I can follow through on the gigs bc I can’t afford them after spending so much. 
- Financial: Overcommitting to trips internationally and across the United States - trips that would all take place between a 2 month period. I am not even sure that I can get enough time off from work for them. Fortunately, I was able to resist buying plane tickets/following through for all but one of my extra tris. This overcommitting  with trips is very unlike me. I co sides travel to be expensive and have always been judicious in planning & committing to trips to see friends. I’ve always been highly aware of making sure that I can comfortable afford the trip. 
- Behavioral: Spontaneous behaviors: new piercing, planning new tattoos (MANY and wanting them all at once)
- Financial: realize that I forgot to pay July rent & somehow blew through all my rent money for that month & now owe property management 
- Limited sleep noticed by friends. For weeks. Tired in AM but able to work & work out & stay up late again the next night. 3-6 hrs of sleep a night. I recently had a night where I didn’t sleep for almost 48 hrs. 
- Behavioral: Buying too many things at once. clothes from Etsy, 3 pairs of shoes, workout shorts from free people, etc. I am usually very careful about buying clothes as I used to have a shopping addiction in my late teens/early 20s (I’m 34 now). 

I have a lot of healthcare debt that I’ve been diligently paying off- about $1200 in monthly payments with a goal of paying it all of by the end of 2025. So I have had limited funds all year.

I pieced it all together about a week ago. Have told my therapist & messaged my psychiatrist on Friday. I was just approved for 5mg adderall bc my ADHD is out of control. I was scared to tell my psychiatrist that I may be hypomanic bc I don’t want to lose the adderall prescription. I’ve already tried a non-stimulant ADHD medication, Stratera, which doesn’t  work well enough. The adhd symptoms are really impacting my ability to work and handle life necessary tasks. 

Any advice? I don’t know how to handle hypomania since I haven’t known had it since 2019. 

Can hypomania turn into mania? I smoke weed & have smoked more frequently since July - might this be due to hypomania & could it make hypomania worse? I’m thinking of going on a drug & coffee fast until I’m scented out. ",1,1756797916.0,bipolar2,0,1.0,False
1n6d12o,https://i.redd.it/td28kbw2epmf1.jpeg,What's a good cappuccino?,"A good cappuccino is all about balance — the perfect harmony of espresso, steamed milk, and foam. Traditionally, it’s a 1:1:1 ratio:

1 part espresso → strong, rich, slightly bitter base.

1 part steamed milk → smooth, velvety body that softens the espresso’s bite.

1 part milk foam → airy, creamy top that gives it that signature cappuccino texture.

A good cappuccino should be:

Rich in flavor → the espresso comes through clearly without being drowned in milk.

Silky in texture → the milk foam is microfoamed (tiny bubbles, not big airy ones), so it blends into the coffee instead of sitting on top like dry froth.

Balanced in size → usually 150–180 ml (5–6 oz). If it’s served in a huge mug, it’s closer to a latte than a cappuccino.

You should taste the coffee first, then the creaminess of milk, not the other way around.

The foam should be dense enough to leave a little “mustache” when you sip it.

If made well, it often has a simple latte art pattern on top — a heart, tulip, or rosette.",1,1756797887.0,u_coffee-travel-art,0,1.0,False

*As part of my new 7 Wonders of the World Exploration - I would like to share my travel experience in India - Vietnam (Hanoi Layover) - China.* 

***Let’s start with Part 1 - India (The Golden Triangle Tour)*** 

* **Day 1 - August 16 (Arriving in New Delhi)**

Arriving on a gloomy afternoon in New Delhi, I booked an Uber immediately and rushed myself to the waiting area which is easy to navigate. I reached my hotel, it’s near the Delhi Gate called goStops Hotel. After I dropped my bags, I went to **Connaught Place** to have my money exchanged, walk around the area, and eat dinner.

* **Day 2 - August 17 (Exploring Old and New Delhi)**

*Morning.* I booked an Auto through Uber which became a mistake and a lesson throughout my India journey. On my way to Humayun Tomb, a girl on the streets aggressively begged for money and there’s a moment that she pushed my legs while I moved myself on the other side of the seat. After that, I always book an Uber anywhere I go. 

When I arrived at **Humayun Tomb**, I started exploring the museum, the garden, and all the way to the tomb itself. There’s this security guy that I thought was just being nice to take a photo of me then lead me to the other small area to take more pictures of me, asking for money after. 

I prepare for the **Old Delhi Walking Tour**, booked from GuruWalks. I’m the only one with my guide which became a private tour and he even suggested that I use the Delhi Metro which is really convenient. 

I went to a restaurant my guide recommended to me. I went back to Connaught Place to eat dinner and went to India Gate after. I have no idea what was happening at that time but there were a lot of police surrounding the area. While I was walking, the police told us to stop for about 10-20 minutes before continuing my walk towards the India Gate area. 

I managed to go inside by jumping on a fence, but I regret it afterwards because the police are even asking the people from inside the **India Gate** area to leave as well. I’m scared it might lead to a stampede so I just went outside again and went back to my room. I left my room again to have a fun night at the bar nearby. 

* **Day 3 - August 18 (Train from Delhi to Agra)**

I reached the **New Delhi Train Station** an hour before my departure time by 6 AM. I chose the Exec. Chair Car (EC) that cost 990.40 INR arriving in Agra Cantt at 7:50 AM. Once I stepped off Agra, I was literally bombarded with a lot of locals who can’t take no for an answer. I even walked 1km away from **Agra Cantt** and unbelievably the guy was still following me then another guy kept following me after that one guy gave up. 

I thought I escaped that? No. Even my Uber driver that I booked keeps on upselling himself on being my driver for the whole trip. A key takeaway is to lie, I told him I already booked everything so I don’t need any of his service or assistance.  

I reached my hotel named Hotel Taj Resorts. It was in the Taj Mahal area so the Uber couldn't go inside at the time I supposed because when I went back to my hotel at night another Uber dropped me off in front of my hotel. 

The reception was kind enough to have me check-in early. I had breakfast, took a swim, and a nap for that day which is really gracious on the hotel’s behalf.

On my way to Agra Fort, I don’t know if this is another Uber scam but I waited for my driver in a pick-up spot which he accepted. Then suddenly when I reached, he said the car needs a gas fill up so he told me to cancel it and I got charged (which I reported through customer service and they refunded days after).

I went out to explore **Agra Fort** \- Just say no to the local guide outside.

I think you can explore the area by yourself. After Agra Fort, I met another tourist and we went to explore Agra markets as he was looking for these specific sweets and it turns out it was closed that time (Google says it's open). We had dinner in a nearby restaurant. I always use Zomato for nearby recommendations then go back to my room.

* **Day 4 - August 19 (Explore Taj Mahal - Train to Jaipur)**

*Morning*. I booked a guide through hotel reception - Which I also regret after since I don’t need a guide going to the **Taj Mahal** (in my opinion). We were there until 9 AM. We went back to the hotel since it’s getting hot that day. 

I had breakfast, prepared my stuff before leaving and catching the train to the next city. I went to a nearby coffee shop with a Taj view in the afternoon.

I booked an Uber to Agra Fort train station going to Jaipur. It was a long train ride and I booked the AC 3 Tier (3A) that cost 595.40 INR. I reached Jaipur around 9 PM. It was a great experience, the views are amazing, and the people who are with me are really friendly. There’s this one guy who is curious about my life back home. I gave him my granola bars so he can share with his children. 

*Night.* I reached my hotel - Moustache Jaipur. I made a mistake with my booking dates but thankfully it worked out in the end by deducting the amount that I prepaid. Even though the hotel is under renovation, my stay was great. I went out to eat dinner in a rooftop bar 15 minutes away by walking. 

* **Day 5 - August 20 (Exploring Jaipur)**

*Morning*. I booked a **Jaipur Walking Tour** through GuruWalks. I was joined with the Spanish speaking tourists but the guide was kind enough to explain it to me in English afterwards. My favorite part was when we went to the sundial area and astronomical clocks. 

After the tour, I went back to **Hawa Mahal**. There’s this guy who wanted to help and take a photo of me but I needed to buy it in his shop after. I immediately went out and headed to the Tattoo Cafe for a better view of the Hawa Mahal for lunch. 

*Afternoon*. I met my tourist friend (that I met in Agra) and we explored the city with a local student by visiting the Monkey Mountain by sunset. 

*Night*. We hike down and coincidentally it rains hard before we head to our own hotel. Afterwards, I had a final dinner with my friend (another rooftop restaurant which became a common theme in Jaipur as I noticed). 

* **Day 6 - August 21 (Train from Jaipur to Delhi - Fly to Hanoi)**

I head to the train station to catch my train. This was my last train ride until I realized that there’s a specific waiting area for the people based on your tickets. I was just waiting outside for the most part. I booked the First AC (1A) that cost 1355.40 INR going back to **Delhi Train Station**. 

While I was inside the train, I was trying to book a hotel room because my flight was announced that it was delayed for 3 more hours. I got a room inside the streets near the Delhi Train Station. 

*Night*. I went out to have my last dinner in Delhi. Of course, in the Connaught Place area, I had a biryani. I walked around and went back to my room to prepare and go to the airport. Always be early, because the queue is so long upon entering. The airline staff also gave me a voucher of 550 INR so I spent it all on a Subway sandwich. 

—-

End of the India Trip summary. I would say it’s a culture shock for me and I live in a chaotic country too! My only purpose is to visit the Taj Mahal as I’m completing the new 7 wonders of the world. I love the experiences that I had and I definitely learn a lot of things for my future travels. I would say that India (Golden Triangle Tour) is not for a first time solo traveler. But maybe if you book a tour agency it will be worth all the experience. 

Other tips: 

* I used an ESIM that I bought from Trip .com (10 GB Total)
* I only use cash around
* Tips are common and they will tell you to give them tips
* Metro is safe and convenient to travel around

1n6cpvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/sidehustle/comments/1n6cpvq/the_harsh_truth_about_video_editing_that_will/,The harsh truth about Video Editing (That Will save your channel),"Look, I’m going to be brutally honest here: if you're looking for some magic editing secret or that viral hack... this isn’t the post for you. You won’t find it here.

What’s worse than not having a YouTube channel? Having one that’s stuck and going nowhere because you’re obsessed with perfect editing. I’ve been there. Trust me. The moment when you spend hours editing and you’re not even sure if that video is going to hit.

But here’s what I’ve learned: You don’t need to be an editing expert to get started. You just need to make videos that people want to watch. Simple as that.

So, what makes people watch? Clear flow, getting to the point quickly, and respecting their time. Ask yourself: ""Would I click on this? Would I watch this video?"" That’s your guide. Everything else is just fancy extras.

Let’s get to what actually matters: the tools you can start using TODAY.

If you’re just starting out, keep it simple. For example, Vmake is a nice tool for beginners. And it’s incredibly straightforward—no complicated editing or software needed. You just upload your footage, and within seconds, it auto-generates an intro, and adds all the text and effects. And let's not forget Captions. The tool allows you to add automatic captions and subtitles, making your videos more accessible to viewers. If you need your videos to work in different languages. It’s like having an editing assistant, except without the hassle.

Not ready for the big leagues yet? That’s okay! Start small. Tools like Canva Video Editor and Vmake are great for editing on the go, especially when you’re working with short videos. I love Vmake’s mobile-first design—edit a video while waiting for your coffee.

Want to step it up? Try DaVinci Resolve for those serious, Hollywood-level edits. The best part? The free version gives you more power than many paid editors. It’s a steep learning curve, but totally worth it if you’re ready to dive deeper into editing.

Here’s the deal: The tool you choose matters less than what you do with it. I’ve seen simple CapCut videos get millions of views while people using high-end software are still struggling to get noticed.

The difference? Content. Story. Message.

Here’s the real secret: Start with two tools max. One primary tool for editing, and one backup. Don’t waste time trying to pick the ""perfect"" tool. Analysis paralysis is real. Every minute you spend comparing options is one less minute you’re creating.

My advice? Pick a tool, and start. Even if it’s not perfect, get the ball rolling. Your first video might not be great. Your second might not be either. But by your tenth video? You’ll see a huge difference.

So, here’s the question: Are you going to keep reading about editing, or are you going to pick a tool and start creating?

Your move.

P.S. If you’re waiting for the perfect moment, this is it. Just start.",2,1756796676.0,sidehustle,0,1.0,False

 Felicitatum Dynasty capital world

Zardin Imperial Palace

Imperial gardens

Emperor Altus Croesus VI of the Felicitatum Dynasty.

 

After retrieving Canute’s hoverboard from its hiding place, I attempted to switch it on.

 

“Anansi, how do I turn this thing on? There must be a safe lock or something preventing me from using it,” I said, feeling more than a little frustrated.

 

“Shall I attempt to scan it?” asked Anansi.

 

“If you would be so kin…”

 

“Done. There isn’t an on switch, but an auto-detection system,” Anansi interrupted me in an amused voice.

 

“So then how do I use it?” I asked, choosing to ignore Anansi’s antics. I was both puzzled and amused by the lengths my friend would go to just to stop me from using his things without permission.

 

*He must be the only person who would dare to do this to the emperor.*

 

“Just place it on the ground and step on it,” Anansi said in reply.

 

I did as Anansi advised and placed it on the ground, then nudged it with my foot experimentally.

 

“Altus, I believe it is upside down,” whispered Anansi evilly.

 

I jumped away from the board, a cold splash of memory dousing me. I remembered one of the pranks the empress had played on Canute and me in our youth; she had once inverted the propulsion systems on both of our hoverboards, launching us into a tree in the palace gardens.

 

“What a reaction,” Anansi said, barely managing to stifle their laughter.

 

*Jackass.*

 

“You have a sick sense of humor, you know that,” I responded in a tired voice while attempting to put myself back together.

 

“No less sick than that of the empress,” they replied while snickering.

 

I cautiously tested the hoverboard again, this time subtly checking if it was the right way up. Anansi let out a snicker.

 

*Sometimes I wish they had an off button.*

 

When I felt comfortable, I put both feet on the hoverboard. Memories of my youth came flooding back to me: Canute and I barreling down the palace corridors on our hoverboards, terrorizing the palace staff by whizzing past them at breakneck speeds.

 

The rush of the propulsion system made my robes billow and dance.

 

“Nice trick, Altus, but let’s save the ghostly antics for Halloween,” Anansi snarked.

 

“Do you have a factory reset or a sleep button?”

 

“Why, are you planning to do something to me?... I must apologize, Altus, but I don’t like you in that way,” spoke Anansi.

 

*If he had a body, it would have no head.*

 

The hoverboard began to rise higher, and as it did, years of muscle memory returned. Almost instinctively, I knew how to stand on it. The knowledge and feeling of how to balance came rushing back.

 

“Well, get on with it then. The call will arrive any minute now,” Anansi said.

 

*Or a spine.*

 

I tested out the controls, leaning in different directions, and the board followed my movements.

 

“Anansi, scan for life signatures in the corridors leading towards my chambers,” I ordered.

 

“No life signatures detected.”

 

I crouched on the board, trying to lower my center of gravity, readying to launch off. I urged it forward, but it seemed that Canute had purposefully designed this board to be my bane. The board lurched forward at a tremendous speed, nearly speeding into a wall. Luckily, I managed to react in time, just barely steering the board away from the wall and through the doorway.

 

*Anansi has probably recorded that. I just hope that they don’t share it with the empress.*

 

“You look like the empire’s most disoriented comet,” chirped Anansi.

 

I ignored his stupid remark and tried to focus on not crashing into anything. A second later, one of the guards stepped out of a door just ahead of me and into my path. I just barely managed to jump over her head.

 

“Canute would have flipped over her,” commented an increasingly annoying AI.

 

*I want to flip you something.*

 

“Anansi, you over-glorified toaster AI, you knew that would happen.”

 

“Altus, you know that word is a slur. I think I should tell the empress about what you are doing now.”

 

“I will put you in a hard drive,” I said in response to their threat.

 

“Touché,” Anansi said, offputtingly proud.

 

We arrived at the door to my private chambers in record time. Without me having to say a word, the two great doors slid away to allow entry into my rooms.

 

*I should thank them, but they are being an ass.*

 

Whilst still on the hoverboard, but now with substantially more control, I glided into my audience room.

 

This room is far older than this empire. If history is true, then part of this palace once belonged to a family of ancient humanoids. Over the years the tapestries, draping, and even the flooring have changed, but its walls have always remained the same, clad in hardened amber with inlays of gold and precious stones. It was apparently meant to be a recreation of the fabled Amber Room from Ancient Russia. The room is now adorned in my royal color of orange.

 

In the center of the room on a soft rug lay a suite of two chairs and a coffee table between them.

 

“Anansi, draw the curtains closed and lock the doors,” I ordered.

 

“Shall I also scan the room for any life signatures and listening devices?” said Anansi.

 

“Why ask if you already know,” I replied.

 

“All clear,” spoke Anansi.

 

I retrieved the holo-projector from my robes and set it on the table. According to Anansi, I still had around three minutes left before the call could be received. I decided to change into something more comfortable. Luckily, I had ordered the servants to prepare more comfortable clothing for after my audience with the duke.

 

After I had changed into the clothing that the servants had prepared for me, the holoprojector on the table inside the audience room began to beep.

 

“INCOMING TRANSMISSION CODE: TERRA”

 

The automated voice of the holo rang out.

 

“I think that is Canute. Well, let us not keep him waiting,” said Anansi.

 

I sat down on one of the sofas. Once I had input my code and code name, I accepted the transmission. It took a while for the call to connect properly, but once it had, I found myself looking at a familiar face, although exhaustion had clearly taken its toll on him.

 

“Canute, good to see you again.”

 

“I give my greetings to your majesty,” he responded.

African continent Territory, A Restaurant Ancient Cradle of Humanity

Canute Naught, Representative of the Felicitatum System species

 

The wait for the emperor to accept the transmission was a quiet one, almost too quiet. Normally, there would have been a lot of activity happening, especially with the summit having just concluded.

 

“Right now, there should be deals being brokered between the members of the council, but it seems like everyone is preoccupied with something else,” I said. “Lyra, what is your view on this?”

 

“It is possible that the other members of the council are aware of the first contact situation and are holding their own meetings to discuss what they are going to do,” responded Lyra.

 

It could be a possibility, but right now we should have the upper hand. The alien craft is in Libra territory and would be very hard to access without their permission. The other members would need an invasion force to even think about that, and even then, the Libras have one of the largest militaries in the council.

 

“Ahem…Canute, the emperor is about to accept the call,” chirped Lyra.

 

“TRANSMISSION ACCEPTED”

 

The emperor appeared on the holo; it seemed he was in the audience room connected to his chambers.

 

The emperor smiled. “Canute, good to see you again.”

 

“I give my greetings to your majesty,” I said in response.

 

The emperor smirked. “Your Majesty?”

 

*Good to see that he hasn’t changed.*

 

“Has the Duke been giving you a hard time, again?” he questioned.

 

“No, I just believe that this conversation deserves some formality.”

 

“And as your emperor, I order you to speak to me how you usually do,” responded the emperor.

 

“Since it is an order,” I said, “Altus, we have a situation. Is it alright if Anansi and Lyra join the call?”

 

The emperor sighed. “You say that as if they aren’t already listening in on the call. Let them join.”

 

“Hello, Altus,” chirped Lyra.

 

“Greetings, Canute. Why did you make your hoverboard so hard to use?” said Anansi.

 

“What hoverboard?” I asked.

 

The smile on Altus’s face strained a little. “Nothing to worry about, Canute.”

 

“I just received a video file from Anansi,” said Lyra.

 

Altus glared murderously at nowhere in particular.

 

“Let’s get back to the main matter,” I spoke. “The representative of the Libras contacted me earlier and showed me something.”

 

“War?” asked Altus.

 

“No.” I said in response “Lyra, can you send the video that Livia showed me to Altus.”

 

“Sent,” commented Lyra.

 

“Altus,” I said, “Before you watch the video, you might want to sit down.”

 

“Canute, I am already seated,” he responded. “Anansi, could you play the video in a split screen?”

 

The video began its playback on Altus’s screen. When it ended, he sat in silence for a moment, his earlier levity vanished.

 

“Canute,” he said, his voice low and serious, “what was that?”

 

“After the summit,” I began, “the representative of the Libra Empire approached me wanting to speak about something. We convened at a restaurant near the summit hall, where she showed me that recording.”

 

I paused for a moment to let Altus process and to brace myself for what was next.

 

“She revealed that this is a first contact scenario,” I added.

 

“So why have they reached out to us?” asked Altus.

 

“They want to partner with us for a first contact mission,” I replied. “They would like ships from our military to act as escorts.”

 

Altus began to rub his chin; he always did that when he was thinking hard, which normally meant he was scheming, a habit the queen and I had picked up on.

 

“It still doesn’t make sense,” said Altus. “They have a much greater military than us. I mean, we signed a military support and defense agreement with them for that exact reason.”

 

“We have more advanced weapons systems, though,” chirped Anansi.

 

“Where?” asked Altus.

 

“The escort ships in the Imperial Fleet,” said Lyra before Anansi could respond.

 

Altus got up from his seat and began to pace around the audience room, the hologram flickering with his movement.

 

“When?” he asked.

 

“When, what?” I asked in reply.

 

He stopped his pacing for a moment and sighed like I could read his mind. “When is the mission?” he replied.

 

Altus walked toward the camera, and I could see the mischievous glint in his eye.

 

*Why do I sense dread incoming?*

 

“I don’t know,” I said in reply, a bit more nervous now than I was earlier. “They said that they need an answer by today’s end.”

 

He resumed pacing at a quickened speed and started to become more animated.

 

*This can’t be good.*

 

“I’ll have to notify the empress,” he spoke.

 

“Why?” I asked, already dreading the answer to the question. “What would you have to tell her majesty?”

 

Altus ceased his pacing once again and approached the holo. “Canute,” he said in a fake worried tone, “Are you that scared of your cousin? She’ll be hurt if she heard how you speak about her.”

 

“With all due respect,” I replied, trying not to smile at my friend, “I think I’ll be the one being hurt.”

 

Altus let out a familiar chuckle. “That is probably true.”

 

“Anyway,” Altus interjected, “Shall we get back on track?”

 

“Yes,” I replied. “I’ll have to talk to the Prime Minister and the head of the royal guard. We have to form our part of the first contact delegation and organize the pilots.”

 

“Why?” asked Altus, sounding confused. “I am going to head the pilots for this mission.”

 

“No,” I responded in protest, a knot of anxiety tightening in my stomach. “I am vehemently against this idea. It cannot happen.”

 

Altus looked like he is too far gone to even listen to what I am saying.

 

“Altus, do you understand what she would do to us if she heard you say that?” I said, now panicking, rather liking the feeling of my body being unmaimed.

 

Altus sat down, now a little less excited.

 

“Anansi,” he spoke, “how good is our health care again?”

 

“It is free and is also among the best in the council,” responded Anansi. “If a big accident were to debilitate you, we could have it rectified in less than a day.”

Terminus boundary, La-Geng Region, Libra Empire

Yith-Lusir, Bridge

Zhalira vy'Ennoth, Captain of the Yith-Lusir

 

The pursuit ships chasing us had caught up and were closing in fast.

 

“Captain, they are coming in quickly and their weapons are hot!” shouted a voice from the other side of the bridge.

 

We didn’t have any counters against that many ships, and they had already damaged our engines so we couldn’t outrun them. Our only option was to initiate a jump as far away as possible. We probably had a greater chance of surviving in unknown space. But right now, we were sitting ducks just waiting to be turned into space dust.

 

“Status report!” I yelled, the hum of red alert sirens filling the air.

 

“Engines are at 40%, our shields are at 20%, and our AI systems are offline, but we are otherwise unharmed,” another voice responded from the other side of the room.

 

“Prepare to warp!” I commanded, trying to keep everything under control with the pursuit ships drawing nearer.

 

“Understood,” replied my vice-captain, his voice tight. “Where are we warping to?” he asked, sounding more nervous than usual.

 

“As far away as possible!” I responded, fighting to keep the panic from my voice.

 

Once my order was relayed, the crew nervously busied themselves making the preparations to warp as soon as possible.

 

I watched the video feed of the pursuit ships chasing us down while the final preparations were being made. My heart sank as I watched them simultaneously launch torpedoes at us.

 

“Everyone, brace for impact! Torpedoes incoming!” I yelled, my knuckles white on the command chair. “Counter fire Our remaining turrets, take as many of them out as you can!”

 

“Understood, weapons are hot,” said one of the generals.

 

He began to fire the turrets and managed to take out 18 of them, but several still managed to hit their mark. The explosions rocked the ship violently, making the lights flicker and throwing several crew members to the floor.

 

“Update!” I ordered, pulling myself upright.

 

“Shields are down! I don’t think we can take any more than this!” my Vice-Captain said, his voice strained.

 

The regiment of pursuit ships was now only a few ship lengths away. They were close enough to see clearly. The ships were a dull gold color and were a complex mass of shapes connecting to each other, forming a grotesque craft made for speed and nothing else. I could see them opening the torpedo launching tubes on their ships again, no doubt getting ready to finish us off. I white-knuckle gripped the arms of my chair, ready to tell the crew to brace once more.

 

“Warp drives ready!” yelled one of the officers, her voice a beacon of hope.

 

“Warp now!” I commanded, watching as the pursuit ships launched another barrage of torpedoes.

 

We managed to enter and close the warp gate just before the torpedoes reached us. I released my death grip on the armrests and allowed myself a moment to breathe, the adrenaline still coursing through me.

 

“How is the ship?” I asked, the question directed at my Vice.

 

He pulled up the ship diagnostic on his screen, his face illuminated by the pale blue light.

 

“Engines are damaged, and shields are down,” he replied, a grim set to his mouth. “But we are okay otherwise. Our power cores are at 30%, and it will be a week until we can initiate a jump of that size again.”

 

“Where is officer Sylas?” I asked.

 

“Here I am, Captain,” said a wiry male. He had pale green streaks in his hair, and although nervous, he had an intelligent look in his eyes—like he was scanning everything and everyone. His irises, a dull yellow in color, gave his commoner lineage away. The nameplate bearing his full name, Sylas th'Eluan, and title of chief navigation officer sat skewed on his uniform. He hurried towards me and saluted.

 

“Do you know where we are?” I asked him.

 

“Apologies, Madam, but we have no records of this place,” he replied. My vice-captain was about to lay into him for how he addressed me before I waved him away. “I think we are deep into unexplored space.”

 

I pondered this information, a cold weight settling in my stomach.

 

*We are a long way from home with no support. Hopefully, there are no hostiles in the area. On the bright side, our pursuers should be unable to find us.*

 

“Do a small area scan,” I ordered my Vice-Captain. “And the rest of you, retire for the rest of the day, except the engineering crew. You may rest in shifts until repairs are completed. The department heads are to stay behind for debriefing.”

 

The crew dispersed, some to their quarters and others to their tasks. My Vice-Captain approached me nervously with the report from the scans.

 

“We have found something,” he said, handing me his display. A knot of dread formed in my chest. “It is some sort of primitive probe, and it looks new and undamaged, so it must have been put there recently. We have already started jamming the signal, but I think we were too late. Whatever that thing belongs to knows that we are here.”

 

*Not the worst case. Evidence of intelligent life, but they are primitive. Hopefully they are friendly, we can’t afford a fight on two fronts.*

 

I called the heads to the meeting room at the back of the bridge. By the time I had arrived, they were all seated. My vice-captain was standing beside my seat at the head of the table. I took my seat, but before I could speak, a tired and grumpy-looking man at the far end of the table spoke. “Why have we been called? I should be busy helping my crew fix this ship so we can get out of here as quick as possible, not here entertaining high bloods.” According to his nameplate, his name is Torvan vy'Kaelen nar’Rhol, and he is the head of engineering.

 

*An elevated noble? It seems he was elevated into the nobility by the family of Vice-Captain Kaelen vy'Morvain. They gave him their ancient head-of-house's name as his surname, so they must value him highly, but he seems to insist on having his chosen name or heart name, as some call it still attached.*

 

“I understand your complaint,” I said to officer Torvan, keeping my voice level despite his insolence. “The original reason I summoned you all here was to coordinate a plan to get us out of here as soon as possible.”

 

“Original?” asked officer Silas.

 

“Kaelen, if you could,” I said, queueing him to pull the report on the screen in the center of the table.

 

A grainy image of the alien probe appeared.

 

“What does this mean?” Officer Torvan asked me quizzically.

 

“It means we are not alone,” I replied, my voice dropping into a dark, serious tone. “And they know that we are here.”",2,1756796579.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

He also said he was the one who initiated it and they got coffee for an hour, and haven’t texted or spoken since. That he wanted to catch up the same as any other “friend” because she lives in the city too. 

Additional context: 
- he’s been very guarded with his feelings and mentioning he’s unsure about his feelings/they take longer to develop
- he’s mentioned I’m the opposite of who he typically dates (black cat energy women) and that he was nervous about this too, originally but that it’s just because it’s different and refreshing
- his hesitations + comparing me to these exes + seeing the ex while I was gone is making me want to walk away. 

The current situation:
- he said it’s fully platonic, there’s nothing there. When I explained how I felt, he said “I could’ve just not told you. I told you because I wasn’t hiding anything
- and I said “ya three weeks later… why is this just coming up now?” To which he didn’t have a response. We ended with him saying he sees my perspective.

I am actively doing research and if anyone has done it provide me insights it would be helpful for my decision to buy my go to plant protein.

So I came across this super interesting concept from Dubai called RC Café.

It’s basically a café where instead of just sipping coffee, kids (and even adults) get to drive remote-control trucks around while hanging out.

💡 Why it works in Dubai:

Parents are paying around ₹1,500+ per kid per hour

Birthday parties cost ₹25,000+ for 2 hours

Very low setup cost compared to other “edutainment” businesses

Now I’m thinking…
In India, parents already spend big on birthday parties, kids’ play zones, and extracurricular activities. If someone launches this in cities like Gurgaon, Bangalore, or Pune — would it click?

Curious to know:
👉 Do you think Indian parents would actually pay for this?
👉 Or would it become “too desi” too quickly (broken RC cars, overcrowded, etc.)?

Honestly, that’s way more common than you’d think — but it’s also why so many people end up needing root canals, extractions, or implants sooner than expected.

Here’s what I’ve learned (and what a lot of dentists wish people knew):

* 🪥 **Brushing twice a day isn’t optional.** Skipping at night gives bacteria hours to do damage while you sleep.
* 🧵 **Flossing isn’t just for “extra clean teeth.”** It actually prevents gum disease, which is linked to bigger health issues like diabetes and heart problems.
* ☕ **Coffee, tea, and soda matter.** It’s not just sugar, but also acidity that wears down enamel.
* 🦷 **Dental check-ups save money long term.** Catching a cavity early is way cheaper (and less painful) than waiting until you need a crown or root canal.
* 😬 **Grinding is more common than you think.** Stress = clenching = cracked teeth. A night guard can prevent years of trouble.

A lot of people also don’t realize that dentistry isn’t just about fixing teeth — it’s also about overall health, appearance, and even confidence.

Curious to hear from others:

* Do you go for regular check-ups, or only when there’s a problem?
* If you’ve done dental treatments like implants or orthodontics, was it worth it for you?",1,1756795918.0,u_citydentalinstitute3,0,1.0,False

But since I’m getting close to graduation he’s kind of… escaping from me? He’ll work all morning, focus mainly of fantasy football, watch baseball and continue working after dinner sometimes. We’ve had many discussions about how much I need affection and validation during this time and he says he hears me but later seems lost in his world again. I try not to push him because he does seem stressed out by being the main breadwinner and he feels most comfortable being productive.

**GitAction:** [https://github.com/marketplace/actions/webrtc-android-builder](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/webrtc-android-builder)

# Why?

Local WebRTC builds are slow and flaky across platforms. Most teams just want a **deterministic AAR** per milestone/branch without babysitting a local toolchain.

✨ The Solution: Cloud-First WebRTC Building

I created WebRTC Android Builder - a GitHub Action that builds WebRTC AAR files in the cloud:

\- name: Build WebRTC Android AAR

uses: bentleypark/webrtc-android-builder@v1.3.0

with:

webrtc\_branch: 'branch-heads/7258'  # M139 (Current Stable)

About me: I occasionally enjoy good coffee, understand notes and brewing techniques. Never owned any setup to brew speciality coffee at home. 

Preferences: Expresso, Expresso with tonic/sparkling water, Americano, Cappuccino

This is what I have shortlisted  
1) DeLonghi EC685.M  
2) AGARO Imperial  
3) Ariete 1389  
4) AeroPress

Questions:  
1) Will these be able to pull good espresso shots (I know it is a lot to do with technique as well)  
2) I have no plans or budget to buy a coffee grinder, will espresso grind or fine grind from roasters like blue tokai work just fine?  
3) Will these need any other mods apart from stock? I saw a post mentioning lot of mods required to make the agaro machine work well, I am not very keen on that.

I will be buying WDT tool, tamper, weighing scale and froth pitcher

1n6cf33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mortgageadviceuk/comments/1n6cf33/name_removal_off_mortgage/,Name removal off mortgage,"Hey everyone,

Have a mortgage and brother wants to remove his name, that is fine but he is threatening with solicitors as he wants money from the house and we said yes give us two years to sort things but only when your name is removed...Which he will not do...But keeps threatening for me to do it...??

It gets very complicated so I will try break everything down, our names are on the mortgage for our elderly disabled parents to retire here and not worry about the responsibilities of having a property 

-Brother took a loan out to fund the costs to bring his wife from aboard over, he stopped paying the loan saying he can not afford it, loan was against the mortgage so interest aswell as an amount of £1000 was not cleared 

-Brother used to pay towards the mortgage, all us brothers paid so when the house sold we all got ¼, brother stopped and demanded all his money he put in back

-We offered brother to move in the house instead so we would put in money like how he was, he refused

-We offered brother to house our parents even if it was temporary as alot was going on and brickworking it was very intense for everyone, they need someone to live with due to their needs and his partner was not working so she could of cared for them, brother refused

-Brother has never put in any work on the house however his children and himself have damage the house, broken a window, broken items from his children (glass table, swimming pool etc), even caused the fish to jump out stressed due to the behaviour of the children, brother did not pay anything towards damage, he laughed and would take the children home

-Our parents are disabled and child under 18 live here

-Brother is trying to demand how and what mortgage deal we have, brother is trying to take money against the house which we said no, we will sort money when his name is removed (replaced by the other brothers who agreed), brother refuses to acknowledge paying brothers and wants full control, brothers want their name on the mortgage but brother who wants name off refuses to start the process 

-Brother on deeds but only wants his name off mortgage loan

It is becoming hassling now, we have stated for him to remove his name, he is demanding noone else has anything to do with the mortgage, he is refusing to remove his name while demanding it, we generally think that he thinks we do not talk to each other and our stupid, that he will get money for free then not remove his name, he also took our parents round claiming it was for coffee and then verbally bullied them demanding money (likely due to finding out our dad had inheritance), he had not seen them for months before and brother only has paid a few years on the mortgage, he never paid until a long time after it changed into our names and due to everything our parents who were meant to live basically rent free have also had to pick up the costs as we can not afford bills with his amount of money, noone was meant to recieve money until house was sold so he broke verbal contracts, he also threatens to force sale of the house again, with two disabled adults and a child under 18, our parents have lived here since the 90s and would not be able to move, we have not said he can not have money, just living crisis and the actual agreement means not now and certainly not until name is removed, brother also demands when he knows we have things on like everyone is going on holiday so he then 'starts'

For Ela, it had meant a flurry of paperwork, conscientiously changing her official address to a new one near Foothill Road, a tangible anchor to her future. Tanya, unburdened by loans or complex legalities, had simply to pack. And pack she did, her social media feeds erupting with jubilant posts, expressing her heartfelt gratitude to Kat and her family for this incredible opportunity. She even roped Ela into a vibrant YouTube video, a virtual farewell tour where both friends gushed about the impending adventure, the prospect of a new beginning glimmering in their eyes.

Then came the last day in Stoke-On-Trent. They embraced it with a bittersweet determination, deciding it was the perfect time to ride the iconic Potteries Bus one final time, visiting all the charming, familiar sites scattered across the city. They revisited places they called their favorites – a quiet park bench overlooking the canal, the ornate gates of the Gladstone Pottery Museum, the cobbled streets of the old town. Lunch was a sentimental affair at one of their most beloved restaurants, where the familiar aroma of local fare warmed them from within. Already packed and ready to join them for the journey, Consuelo and Max, Kat’s ever-supportive relatives, were there, their presence a comforting promise of help settling in.

That night, Tanya spent her final hours in the UK at Ela's flat, their last slumber party before the big move. They had to be up at 5 AM, a brutal hour for the long drive to London Heathrow Airport.

When the alarm shrilled, they were instantly up. Ela, standing in the middle of her room, let out a final, resonant sneeze, a last offering to the damp British air, before blowing her nose with a conclusive honk. ""I really hope I don't have allergies in California,"" she mumbled, stuffing tissues into her bag. Tanya, ever the pragmatist, shrugged. ""Allergies are pretty rare in the Bay Area, you know. Not many people I've heard of have them."" Consuelo, already a whirlwind in the kitchen, had prepared breakfast to go – warm, savoury sausage baps and coffee in plastic-wrapped bags, ready to be eaten on the way to Heathrow's Terminal 5.

The pre-dawn drive was long, but filled with interesting conversations. They talked about everything and anything, from the minute details of their packing to the vast unknown of their future. You could literally feel the anticipation. It was a journey both physical and emotional, a bridging of worlds.

""Remember Nadia?"" Max asked, breaking a lull, almost to himself. ""Nadia’s deportation from Indiana to Texas... Agent Mayonaise, that's what we used to call him, he deported Nadia from Indianapolis because she no longer was legal due to her divorce."" A heavy silence descended for a moment. ""She's still bitter for life, and still angry at Gido. He made her go back with Tita, and Agent Mayonaise showed up to assist, all very official and cold.""

Consuelo, taking her cue, turned from the passenger seat. ""That's why I want you both to be careful, girls,"" she said with sincere gravity. ""You could be deported back to Stoke if you're no longer legal, meaning if you no longer finish college and no longer can hold a job. This is no joke. He has a point."" Max nodded. ""Gido really did deport Nadia to Texas in 1997. We saw the significance of legal status then.""

They talked about the political reform movements, the bravery needed to rally for change, the humour in everyday life, the cultural shifts concerning Muslims, and the wisdom of their grandparents. Max shared a story about his own grandparent and a war medal. They even joked about the potent smell of mustard and the rising power of yeast in bread, tangential thoughts that lightened the mood. Tanya felt a buzz of productivity just thinking about her new life. Consuelo mentioned searching for a good suite for them in Pleasanton, something comfortable and inspiring. ""Bravo to Kat for arranging all of this, really,"" she said. Ela remembered a particularly strong circuit of thunder and lightning back home, a stark contrast to the expected Californian sunshine.

Finally, they got to Heathrow, and it was a tearful goodbye. Tanya's parents had already said their goodbyes back in Stoke, both tied to demanding tech jobs that prevented them from making the trip. Inside Terminal 5, after parking, the four made their way through the bustling hall and got checked in. Clearing passport control felt incredibly final. Ela, who had managed to hold back so many tears throughout the morning, finally succumbed, her face crumpling as the enormity of moving to America washed over her. Tanya, surprisingly, didn't shed many tears. ""Sometimes I feel my parents don’t care much about her,"" she confessed quietly to Consuelo.

Consuelo instantly enveloped her in a hug. ""Oh, Tanya, we care about you, and so does Max. You are like our own."" Ela, wiping her wet cheeks, quickly added, ""Yes! You're already part of our family, Tanya. We all care about you so much."" A warmth spread through Tanya, and a spark ignited within her. The sadness receded, replaced by a renewed excitement to live in the Bay Area, to embrace this new chapter with these people who truly saw her.

They waited in Terminal 5, the hum of the airport a constant backdrop, until a soft chime resonated through the hall, and the chime went off and the flight to San Francisco was announced, beckoning them towards their Californian dream.

Joined this community recently. I started off with a 75 hard and quickly realised that this wouldn't work for me as I am currently pursuing an academically rigorous course, and living on University campus with not much access to resources. I still stuck by my promise for consistency. Here were my revised rules

1. No sugar or fried/processed food (I don't like counting calories, and didn't mind any intake of sugar that wasn't me directly adding in; example coffee served at the cafe from the machine has sugar pre-added). No cheat meals. 
2. 3+L of water 
3. 20-30 pages of a fiction book everyday
4. No alcohol, period. (Very tough cus there were parties every week or so 😭)
5. Progress pics at end of every week (I didn't want to scrutinise my body on a day to day basis)
6. One 1 hour workout 5 times a week (2 days for rest and recovery)

I've managed to stick by this and it helped me with a boost of confidence in my abilities.💪🏽 😁

We’ll be packing food and making food and only sparingly eating out, and renting a camper van so don’t need to setup camp on site. The zodiac boat tour suggestion on the fence about as that’s going to require some coordination.

VA-11 Hall-A is definitely one of those games. While I'm looking for some games to scratch some of the itches it did, I realize it won't be all of them. 

I enjoyed the fly on the wall (bartender like) aspect of hearing others process their lives outside the space I'm talking to them. I loved being prodded for feedbaxk or to ask questions about their lives and struggles (and the various levels of inebriation of them AND me coloring the directions of the conversation). I love the slice of life aspect in a fantastical setting. I loved piecing together what the strange world was like through in universe news articles and broadcasts alongside imagining the days and struggles of the bar patrons outside the space by how they describe it and how others talk about shared experiences I wasn't privy to (like how I'd get one take on an issue Person A dealt with during their day, and later on another patron Person B discussed their interactions with Person A). I LOVED the music and vibes of it. I loved having the life struggles of the player character Jill being a good framing device and light background concern tying you/her into the world. I loved the dealing with adults and not being a high school story. I loved how, while my character felt a part of the world and had some work and personal relationships, it wasn't about romance paths/romantic relationships weren't compulsory. I loved how it reminded me of a relaxing little Japanese drama I came across a long while back called Midnight Diner. 

So yeah. If you have some suggestions of games that gave you similar feelings, let me know about em! I know very few things will hit most of the points, but even a ballpark area would be appreciated. Like I said in the title tho I'm aware of Coffee Talk and it's clear that it was clearly inspired by VA-11 Hall-A. I might play that at some point, but some writing choices made in the demo didn't feel quite like my thing (again, still might try later). Any other games though I'm happy to hear about em. 

Three prominent things I'm looking to AVOID are 1) Dealing primarily with a cast of high school kids, 2) Horror / shock / guro elements (I know nothing I said above would imply I want horror but just being safe), and 3) Romance / romantic paths for the player being 'the point' or compulsory. I won't say there can't be any romance option for the MC, but the more it's about ""Which girl/partner did you get?"" or the endings being dictated as 'X's (romantic) ending', the less I'm interested.

Act I: Reading ① Green Path — Encounter and Unspoken Feelings
	•	Narration: The “green path” (緑道 / ryokudō) sets the opening scene of an encounter, peaceful but haunted by echoes of a past life.
	•	Songs:
	1.	Makeinu ni Encore wa Iranai 「負け犬にアンコールはいらない」 — rejection, resistance against repetition.
	2.	Itte. 「言って。」 — the pain of leaving words unspoken.

Analysis:
This act introduces the motif that incomplete communication = unfinished love. Regret echoes from a “past life,” linking silence to fate.



Act II: Reading ② Nightjar — Youth and Fleeting Light
	•	Narration: The nightjar bird (夜鷹 / yodaka) symbolizes fleeting youth.
	•	Songs:
3. Kutsu no Hanabi 「靴の花火」 — fireworks of adolescence, quickly extinguished.
4. Hitchcock 「ヒッチコック」 — restless, chaotic exploration of youth.
5. Tada Kimi ni Hare 「ただ君に晴れ」 — fragile wish for sunny days.

Analysis:
Youth is portrayed as light in the night — short, dazzling, unstable. The sequence builds from ephemeral joy → chaotic growth → fragile prayer.



Act III: Reading ③ Insects and Flowers — Small Daily Moments
	•	Narration: Insects (虫 / mushi) and flowers (花 / hana) are metaphors for small, passing lives.
	•	Songs:
6. Rubato 「ユーレカ」 (note: Rubato often paired in live setlists, some variations) — free rhythm, symbolizing shifting time.
7. Ame to Cappuccino 「雨とカプチーノ」 — finding beauty in fleeting daily scenes.

Analysis:
This act highlights tiny happiness as the true essence of living. Yorushika suggests that art is about capturing ephemeral moments.



Act IV: Reading ④ Fish — Love and Forgetting
	•	Narration: The fish (魚 / sakana) symbolizes slippery, drifting memories.
	•	Songs:
8. Usotsuki 「嘘月」 — a false moon, symbolizing illusionary love.
9. Wasurete Kudasai 「忘れてください」 — paradox of love: asking to be forgotten while wishing to be remembered.
10. Hana ni Bourei 「花に亡霊」 — memory transforming into a haunting ghost.

Analysis:
This chapter maps love’s arc: illusion → release → ghostly memory. Love is shown as both eternal and unattainable.



Act V: Reading ⑤ Cherry Blossoms — Transience of Life
	•	Narration: Cherry blossoms (桜 / sakura) fall, symbolizing impermanence.
	•	Songs:
11. Haru 「春ひさぎ」 (False Spring) — a bright but deceptive season.
12. Toumin 「冬眠」 (Hibernation) — retreat into stillness, symbolizing rest or resignation.

Analysis:
The contrast of spring → hibernation reflects life’s cycle of bloom and decline. Blossoms’ fragility = human mortality.



Act VI: Reading ⑥ Youth — The Struggle of Art and Existence
	•	Narration: A youth (青年 / seinen) questions purpose, art, and living.
	•	Songs:
13. Shikaki to Coffee 「詩書きとコーヒー」 — loneliness of writing poetry.
14. Parade 「パレード」 — detachment from society, watching from afar.
15. Dakara Boku wa Ongaku wo Yameta 「だから僕は音楽を辞めた」 — climax: rejection of music itself.

Analysis:
This is Yorushika’s self-reflection: solitude → alienation → artistic collapse. Music is both salvation and curse.



Act VII: Reading ⑦ Past Life — Revelation of Cycles
	•	Narration: “Past life” (前世 / zense) is revealed as metaphor — not reincarnation, but memories and mistakes repeating.
	•	Songs:
16. Sayumou 「左右盲」 — disorientation, loss of direction.
17. Haru Dorobou 「春泥棒」 — spring thief, scattering petals of crape myrtle (百日紅), symbolizing both death and rebirth.

Analysis:
This is the philosophical climax. The falling petals = beauty because of impermanence. Life ends, but cycles return.



Act VIII: Reading ⑧ Veranda — Epilogue
	•	Narration: The veranda (縁側 / engawa) — intimate space between inside and outside.
	•	Songs: Often quiet, sometimes silence left intentionally.

Analysis:
The cycle closes by returning to everyday intimacy. After confronting memory, love, death, and art, the message is simple: life continues in daily scenes.

⸻

Conclusion

The concert mirrors the cycle of human existence:
	1.	Encounter (出会い) →
	2.	Youth (青春) →
	3.	Daily life (日常) →
	4.	Love (愛) →
	5.	Seasons/Death (季節・死) →
	6.	Artistic struggle (芸術の苦悩) →
	7.	Past life/rebirth (前世・輪廻) →
	8.	Return to intimacy (日常への回帰).

Through narration, music, and visual motifs (cherry blossoms, rain, light, petals), Yorushika illustrates the philosophy of impermanence (無常 / mujō):

Beauty exists because it disappears.

I like Wispr Flow and Typeless. Using a conversational approach for input makes it easier to get into a flow state. However, there are still a few issues for me:

1.  Many times, it's inconvenient for me to speak to my computer, such as in an office or a coffee shop.

2.  Just having an input function isn't enough. I instinctively want it to help me with operations, like polishing a paragraph or directly writing an email for me.

Currently, even for simple tasks, I still need to copy the content to ChatGPT and then paste the result back.

So, I made an app that initially realizes my ideas, and I think it's really useful and can't wait to share it with you. I can use it to write email:

It can accept voice or text instruction, and automatically captures context from the current input field and can even have custom behaviors in different applications, such as defining a custom reply format in Mail.   
  
If voice input can boost efficiency by 4x, I believe this app can often deliver more than 10x the efficiency.

i clicked on reject a couple of nights ago and it has been eating me up that i wont go that place after wanting to for so long, after yearning to spend 4 yrs on that campus. it stings. i know i made the right decison and yet i regret it. maybe i would have regretted not going to ict had i chosen iiser. but as of now, at the back of my mind im still salty about iiserb. 

in my mail i see iiserb offer letter and it makes me a little sad because its right there what i wanted is right there but i cannot and perhaps should not have that. the universe has its plans, though, thats one thing i trust. so yes. i do believe that regret is a deeply integral part of any decision no matter how small and that we must learn to deal with it slowly, but surely. 

this post is for future me, i hope i realise i did the right thing and found greater happiness in what i did than what i was going to do. but iiserb truly will be the prettiest, awesomest campus forever in my eyes.
