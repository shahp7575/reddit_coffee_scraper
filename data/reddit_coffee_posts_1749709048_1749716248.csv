1l9h0u4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anemic/comments/1l9h0u4/severe_iron_deficiency_without_anemia/,Severe iron deficiency without anemia,"Good morning everyone

I'm 28F and I've experienced iron deficiency symptoms for as long as I remember. As a kid I've never been able to pass any PE tests, as I'd collapse and run out of breath. In my teens I was of average build and I'd struggle with stairs, my friends often needed to wait for me on casual walks because I'd run out of breath. Testing was done, believing it was my heart or lungs, blood tests etc. all came back fine except for iron deficiency.

As an adult I've had tests done again, and once again, iron deficiency, no anemia. Blood count etc all in the green, literally no issues anywhere except for iron deficiency.

I've had iron supplements for 3 months and while after two months (December) I felt actually human for the first time in my life, it went straight back downhill at the start of February when I stopped taking them for a month and a half, as my course ran out.

It felt worse since I know now what it feels like to be okay haha. However my iron has gone up just a slight bit, still way below the minimum however. 

I drink nutritional supplements with lots of iron, eat a lot of red meat, spinach, kale etc, but it clearly doesn't do anything. I have one cup of coffee in the morning and refrain from caffeine otherwise. I'm a bit at my wits end, and the Internet only helps with Iron deficiency anemia. However I've got no anemia and I wondered what possible reasons could be? 

Thanks a lot!",1,1749716134.0,Anemic,0,1.0,False
1l9h06a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1l9h06a/how_has_divorce_saved_you/,How has divorce saved you?,"Ending my marriage was one of the most brutal chapters I've ever been through in my adult life. 

My story included being on the receiving end of a two-month silent treatment I didn't deserve, being called a freeloading impostor and a disgusting loser, crying every day, forgiving him when he needed me to spearhead a business pitch that was pivotal to his career dream, and after all that, finding out that 10 years of my unconditional love for him paled in importance compared to the unplanned $350 we paid for baggage allowance that didn't come with the airline tickets for our business trip.

Despite the hell I was living in, I was terrified of leaving. My career tanked during COVID, I worked for my ex.  He treated me like his personal slave and paid me under minimum wage. My finances were wrecked and I didn't have a new job lined up for me--I'd been applying and collaborating, but it just wasn't happening.

I checked out months before we really separated, but I was going to get my proverbial ducks in a row first so that I can move on with a sense of security. 

But my marriage decided it was done before I was ready. One morning my ex packed up and drove away. He wanted to retaliate my checking out by leaving on his terms. He wanted to punish me and make me come back crawling to him. And when that failed, he cried a river, not because he loved me but because he lost control over me.

Psychology says, ""You marry your unfinished business. This used to enrage me because it felt like a curse. No matter what good intentions I started the marriage with or how good a wife I'm committed to be, it doesn't matter because I inevitably would attract a partner that brings out the worst in me and embodies everything I loathe about my family of origin, but worse.

My marriage was a long, hard lesson on what I needed to heal from. It took me a marriage from hell to say, ""Enough is enough"" to the dysfunction and living in defeat.

It wasn't too long ago when I felt that everything meaningful in my life has been fucked up and fucked over, and that unfucking my life felt so impossible. I had internalised my husband's lie that without this marriage I'd just be a pariah nobody would want anything to do with. He strategically weaponised shame against me and isolated me from my own world so that his narrative of shame could prevail and control me.

When I felt had no one to talk to about all the things that made me feel ashamed of my life, I started fangirling a rock band whose frontman overcame suicidal depression. Not only did the band make great music that speak to me--it was a testament of how the band had gone through hell and back, and how their unwavering support for each other as a ""friends first"" kind of band prevails.

I joined Reddit initially because of the frontman's AMA. A fellow fan noticed my content in the band's sub, and an initial exchange of favourite songs snowballed into stories of our lives. 

Eventually this person became a sounding board and voice of reason that dismantled the lies my marriage forced upon me and showed me evidence to my own truth. As this online safe space rebooted my relationship to my reality, that also changed how I operated in my offline life.

The biggest takeaway is that we all need a band: not necessarily the kind that plays guitars and drums, but ones that help our inner rock stars shine as we show up to this stage called life.

They say it takes a village to raise a child. I say it takes a band to help a divorcee heal their wounded inner child, find their light, and make their leap of faith into the postnuptial world with peace and power.

So find my band I did. It wasn't a dedicated five-piece, but more like a rotating constellation of session players who show up just at the right song, deliver an epic show with me, then bow out to make room for other people who make the most suitable collaborators for my next song.

It started with my best friend of 30 years, who for a long time wasn't someone I made myself vulnerable for and extended a proper invitation into my inner life. Project Exit Marriage elevated our friendship into an unprecedented level. Not only did she become my loudest cheerleader: she also pointed me to new goals to work on and introduced me to a new professional network that made a difference in my life.

As I started working on new goals and inviting people to help me make them happen, my band showed up for me from the most unexpected corners of my life. I reconnected with old friends and relatives. I made meaningful friendships with new people and always found something to bond over. They saw good things in me, had good faith in me before I had anything to prove, and helped me before I had anything to give back.

My ex and I separated 19 months ago. A lot has happened since.

I had a fling with a foreign stranger who couldn't stay beyond six months and two vacations. I needed to fall in love with him but was adamant that this fling needed to heal me and not break my heart. I learnt so much by letting him in and letting him show me evidence that I am safe with him. I let my feelings for him blossom, co-created a beautiful intimate space with him and received his generosity in hosting the vacations.

I worked on healing sexual trauma in therapy. When I was 18-19, my first boyfriend raped me, and I'm not done healing from it 20 years later. The rape shattered my self worth and relationship to intimacy, and put me in perpetual self-sabotaging survival mode. Healing from that changed how I relate to myself and others, and the makeup of my emotional landscape.

I had a close call with my dream job--having been 1 out of the 8 callbacks out of 150 applicants. But after a second interview, the employer decided to hire the other candidate. I cried my eyes out.

Sensing that my career wasn't getting out of trouble, I rage wrote a PhD proposal. It was a long and exhausting ""will I or won't I"" drama that took up most of my year. But I scored the jackpot for a supervisor--not only am I a fan of her work, she also believes in me and cares about me as a person. 

But months before it was a done deal, I had more professional struggles. Dozens of applications that went nowhere. Inviting colleagues and acquaintances for coffee to offer collab opportunities for my PhD project and ask about job openings they're aware of. I Upskilled myself and earned an affiliation with a reputable international professional association. Working gigs for a new client that became a friend. Publishing an op-ed in a reputable foreign newspaper. Pitching a journalistic column and getting rejected for it.

I filed for divorce six months in. My country doesn't recognise no-fault divorce so I waited for my ex to forfeit contestation, and got help strategising my DIY divorce plans from experienced friends. Turned out my divorce was simple because I don't have kids, a house, and much property. I proceeded in his consented absence beyond the mediation. I got my sock in four months.

I got my PhD scholarship on the 11th hour and have relocated overseas for it. My life is the most downsized it has ever been, but years of hardship have taught me to be resourceful and mindful of the blessings that I do have to be grateful for. 

Obviously the new country comes with a new band. I'm living with my mom's best friend of 30 years, she and her family look out for me. I'm reconnecting with old friends and making friends with new one, quickly opening up to budding friendships while patiently nurturing them to grow strong into something longer term. 

I'm also cherishing the solitude of the times I'm not with other people as a valuable space for self care, rest and reflection.

I'm five months into a long distance relationship with a wonderful man who amplifies my happiness and contributes to my sense of stability in this massive season of transition. We don't have long haul future plans but are showing up to this relationship one day at a time. It feels just right.

These days my mind no longer lives in the grief, anger and terror of my ending marriage. I most definitely don't miss my ex. But that doesn't mean that I didn't love him, or that the marriage meant nothing to me. Who I am today is built upon the legacy of that marriage and having loved my ex. But its breakdown no longer has its chains on my present life.

So how has divorce saved me?

One: Marriage showed me how capable I am of giving unconditional love. Divorce taught me to redirect that unconditional love to the person who truly deserves it, i.e. myself.

Two: Marriage showed me that there is a big difference between being human and experiencing misfortune, vs being evil and wishing misfortune upon your spouse. Divorce taught me to never apologise for being human, and to recognise the people who value my humanity.

Three: Marriage showed me that nothing kills a person's spirit more viciously than isolation and weaponised shame. Divorce taught me how to find my way back to community, to take charge as I free my inner rock star, and to build self-sufficiency and resilience out of my band's gift of respectful care and support.

Four: Marriage showed me that as much as I adored my husband for them, his career and dreams should have never taken precedence over mine--his success does not make him a superior spouse, and my struggles don't make me a loser whose only salvation is servitude to his dream machine. Divorce taught me that my dreams matter, and that with the right band having my back, I have what it takes to pursue them successfully.

Five: Marriage showed me that I cannot make my spouse love me more by getting my shit together, purging myself of the things that make me burdensome, and being more understanding, supportive and sacrificial for him. Divorce taught me that I am enough, I matter, and I deserve to be loved right now and shown up for no matter how messy my life currently is. And people show up for me once I've decided to show up for myself.

Six: Marriage showed me that wedding vows are sacred, but the sanctity of your safety and dignity take precedence over those vows. Evil spouses do exist--they break their vows not because they're oblivious that it hurts you, but because it benefits them at your expense. Divorce taught me that there is a huge difference between ""till death does us part"" and ""happily ever after."" The former is a tango that takes two, and twos are something you don't get to control. The latter is a fairy tale. True love comes in all kinds of shapes, sizes and capacities, and this toxic preoccupation on ""happily ever after"" is the root of missing out on all the good love that is already in your life right now.

Seven: Marriage showed me that you cannot choose love and trauma--and the latter will always prevail by default. Divorce taught me that overcoming trauma isn't hard or complicated: it just takes the readiness to decide that this stops here, and dispelling the trauma's darkness with the light of your support system so that you could envision what it truly means to overcome.

Eight: Marriage taught me that manipulation is not tough love, smear campaigning is not seeking support, and that I am not crazy for melting down when my spouse does not treat me with dignity. Divorce showed me that the people who truly love me are not fazed by my evil husband's attempts to dehumanise and villainise me. They know the truth and act accordingly without needing to desperately outscream his lies. And I know the truth and hold my head high because of it, no matter what my ex wants people to believe of me.

Divorce saved me by teaching me to love myself, own my humanity, welcome my support system, value my dreams, receive love without letting my flaws get in the way, recognise and embrace love in forms other than ""happily ever after,"" to be ready to heal when it's time, and to take ownership of my truth.

I don't understand people who say that their marriage was a waste because it ended in divorce. That's like saying they should have never adopted a puppy because the dog got old and died. It's of course tragic, but doesn't erase the love, joy, and meaning that blossomed during their time with the dog--and the good memories that remain beyond.

Why can't the marriage just be a frozen frame of something that was beautiful in its time? Looking back at my own marriage, I don't see it as a reflection of the happy life my ex and I could have had if certain tragedies never wrecked it. If anything, marriage showed me the monster that my husband really is, and divorce saved me from a tragic premature death at the hands of my own husband.

I wouldn't be who I am today if it weren't for my marriage and divorce. And I love how I turned out--not because my life turned out the way I wanted it to but because I show up for myself and make it work.

How about you? How has divorce saved you?

1l9gz78,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1l9gz78/aio_for_blowing_up_at_my_wife_for_sending_me_an/,AIO for blowing up at my wife for sending me an IG story?,"Let me preface this by admitting that I can be a bit of a man child who has a hard time of getting out of a funk and would throw temper tantrum sometimes. Today was one of those days so I’m writing this from a pretty negative head space.

I’ve been pretty stressed with my job lately. On top of the usual corporate bs, I’m now mentally dealing with the newly announced 4-day RTO mandate, taking on additional responsibilities due to a teammate going on maternity leave, and taking on additional projects to deal with the financial fallout of the tariffs (thanks Trump). I had nightmares about work. This morning I woke up feeling super depressed. So much so that it felt like a struggle to make breakfast. When I spilled a bit of the coffee grounds, I felt a bit like weeping. Similarly when the barber butchered my haircut I was overwhelmed with this sadness.

When I came home later in the day I found my wife in an upbeat mood. She herself has been going through a rough patch lately due to work and health reasons, but today she just came off of a great job interview so she was in a bit of a comforting mood towards me. While still stuck in my funk, I purposely made myself unpleasant to be around and made a few jerkish remarks. That made her upset but expressed that she was still willing to talk if I got out of my funk, otherwise we will just each be in our own space for rest of the night. Deep down I was hoping she would be a bit more comforting but I was too stubborn to approach her so I decide to sleep on the couch tonight.

She has a bad habit of doomscrolling right before bedtime. As I was lying here, she sent me this IG reel of a TikTok lawyer warning people about TSA checking people’s immigration status while boarding domestic flights. Context: we have our wedding reception planned for later this year. My folks who are undocumented will be flying across the country to attend and so will her undocumented friend.

Needless to say, seeing that right before bed got me pretty upset. Now I keep myself pretty informed with all immigration-related matters so I know that reel was 99% fear-mongering as TSA agents don’t check one’s immigration status. However watching it still made me feel uneasy. I then went to confront my wife why she sent that to me and how was that helpful in diffusing our drama. Did she know that it was pure misinformation, and if she didn’t, how did she expect me to act using this information? Ask my parents to not risk deportation to attend our wedding? Obviously she didn’t send that to her undocumented friend because she knows that would upset her so why did she think it was ok to send it to me especially since I was in foul mood at the moment. She agreed that it was wrong of her to share the reel, misinformation or not. However I still can’t get over it, at least not tonight.

Am I overreacting?

Sorry for typing up a wall as I am spiraling in a negative headspace here but I believe backstory and context is important in this case.

1l9gyvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1l9gyvh/ibs_and_adrenaline_trigger/,ibs and adrenaline trigger?,"TMI maybe

basically tests have confirmed that as long as i avoid hot milk, hot coffee, some seasonal vegetables (salad) and anything spicy, food is not the trigger to ibs. 
more air that usual is the only things that stand out. 

most professional explain this problem w a strong connection in the brain gut axis. ok, super important to know this. i don’t think i fully grasp it yet. 

for starters -  can you confirm that adrenaline means your mind-body overreact to certain stimuli? over and over time, this has some effect on the gut?

so, i have some more basics general questions.

the most absurd one is kind of: why just now and not 5 years ago? just like most people stress has always been present and for years i had the opposite problem (rather then ibs type d). stress come and go, but the gut changed completely and it’s not improving despite best efforts. 

like, growing older i know myself better, stress is something i’m aware of. for the longest time massive tiredness and it was a combination of thyroid, very low iron, and poor sleep, lack of movement. 

that part is getting better, but now everyday as many of you, i’m dealing w  the impact from ibs. it’s been daunting for  the past 2 years non stop. costs associated w prescribed therapy, tests, also toilet paper and massive hours spent busy. associated problems w hemorrhoids (the most annoying part). 

also, this is way more specific question. 

i know i have a condition called alexythimja so, emotions are there but under the radar. only big emotions pass through awareness. so, anxiety building up is not something i’m aware, i’m already way above a bit when i notice i may have anxiety active. i also can 100% assure that i’m not aware of the racing heart. given this specific set, of course it’s way harder to see adrenaline built up and eventually discharge to the gut. 
also, stress to me is just existing stimuli, sun, noises and this kind of environmental stuff - you can’t really cut off entirely. it’s harder to filter out. 

this context is key. it’s never classic “oh anxiety, there you go toilet”. it’s more like random time during the day, w a very ordinary day, when i’m really calm. and still adrenaline seems to play a role? someone had this experience?

1l9gynd,https://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalLifeHacks/comments/1l9gynd/how_i_stopped_worrying_about_drinking_sketchy/,How I stopped worrying about drinking sketchy water while traveling,"I travel a lot for work and sometimes for fun. Between airports, gas stations, public refill stations, and random coffee shops, I’ve had more than a few moments where I stopped and thought, “Is this water actually safe?” I never got seriously sick, but I’ve definitely had stomach issues that made me start thinking harder about what I was drinking.

That’s when I came across the **UVBrite water bottle**.

It’s marketed as a **smart water bottle** that uses UV-C light to kill bacteria and viruses inside the water. I didn’t jump in right away because I’ve seen a lot of “techy” bottles that promise a lot but just end up being overpriced thermoses. But after reading up on how UV-C purification works and watching a few user reviews, I decided to try it out on my last two trips.

**What makes it different**

This isn’t your average water bottle. There’s a UV light built into the cap, and when you press the button, it starts a purification cycle that takes about 90 seconds. The UVBrite water bottle can also auto-clean itself throughout the day. That part sold me. I’m not great at remembering to rinse my bottle regularly and I know that over time, bacteria can build up on the inside walls. This thing handles that for me.

**Why I started using it on the road**

I’ve been in places where the only option was a questionable tap or a water fountain that looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in years. Bottled water is expensive and creates waste, especially when I’m traveling multiple days in a row.

With UVBrite, I just fill the bottle, hit the button, and wait. It doesn’t make noise or flash lights (other than a small indicator). After it finishes the cycle, I drink. No weird taste, no stomach problems, no stress.

**Design and build**

The bottle itself is made of stainless steel and has a double-wall insulation design. Water stays cold for hours, which is great in warm climates. It has a solid feel, not too heavy, but definitely more durable than the plastic ones I’ve used before.

Charging is easy. You use a USB cable and the battery lasts for days. I took it on a 4-day trip without needing to recharge once.

**What I liked most**

* It purifies water using UV-C light, which means no chemicals or filters to replace
* It cleans the bottle too, not just the water
* It’s reusable and cuts down on single-use plastic
* Water tastes clean, no plasticky or metallic aftertaste
* It’s easy to carry, fits in my backpack side pouch

**A few things to keep in mind**

* If you’re using very dirty water (like from a river), this won’t filter out debris. It’s not a survival filter
* You have to remember to charge it. Not a big deal, but if it’s dead, the UV won’t work
* Slightly bulkier than your average bottle, but that’s due to the UV lid and insulation

**Is it worth it?**

For me, it was. I don’t use it for hiking or backwoods adventures, but as a traveler who wants safer water with zero hassle, it’s been solid. I refill at airports, bus terminals, and hotels, and I don’t worry about what I’m putting into my system.

You can check it out [**here**](https://www.elprsdnt.com/8SWM4W1/DCC1P68/?uid=38397&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/NaturalLifeHacks).

Or just jump straight to the details [**here**](https://www.elprsdnt.com/8SWM4W1/DCC1P68/?uid=38397&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/NaturalLifeHacks) if you want to see how much it costs or how it looks.

**Final thoughts**

I’ve used a lot of reusable bottles in the past. Some get moldy. Some are annoying to clean. Some end up forgotten in a drawer. This one’s different. It’s in my daily bag now and I use it way more than I thought I would. If you’ve ever worried about water quality while traveling, commuting, or just refilling in public, the UVBrite water bottle might actually solve that problem without adding more stress to your day.",1,1749715878.0,NaturalLifeHacks,0,1.0,False

I wanted to see if I could go without coffee, energy drinks, or any of the usual pick-me-ups. Honestly, I didn’t think it would stick.

But the streak started building in the NOCAF app where I used to track my coffee spending savings and caffeine streak, and something clicked. I didn’t want to just “quit caffeine”-I wanted to see who I was without it.

* Mornings became easier. No ritual, no dependency. Just wake up, hydrate, and move.
* I started sleeping like a human again. Not half-sleeping with my brain buzzing all night. Real rest.
* The mental fog lifted. Focus became easier. I didn’t realize how much caffeine was messing with my clarity.
* Tracking helped. Watching my streak grow gave me momentum. It turned into a quiet form of accountability.

And weirdly enough, I started trusting myself more. Like, “If I can do this, what else can I change?”

Would I suggest this for everyone? Not necessarily. But if you’re feeling wired, tired, and weirdly anxious all the time—it might be worth testing life without caffeine for a bit.

The atmosphere is cheerful but reverent, as the conversation flows freely among the women, gathered around china cups and homemade sponge cake.


---

Mrs. Audrey Clifton:
(leaning in) “Jemima, I must say—you look absolutely radiant this morning. That colour suits you so well. Is it new?”

Jemima:
(smiling warmly) “Thank you, Audrey. It’s not new, merely re-lined. Heather insisted the old silk needed a refresh. But the embroidery, I’m afraid, is original—done by hand during a long winter in East Germany. I’ve always believed one should wear what reminds her of her strength.”


---

Mrs. Daphne Lowe:
“You do seem to carry yourself with such grace, dear. Were you ever on the stage? Or perhaps a diplomat? There’s a calm assurance about you.”

Jemima:
laughs gently “I have stood in many rooms, Daphne. Some grand, some desolate. But all were improved by a bit of posture, and a little charm. I find that when one dresses beautifully but impractically, people rush to hold doors, offer chairs, or fetch shawls. It’s not manipulation—it’s theatre with purpose.”


---

Miss Valerie Peckham:
“Do you never feel cold, dressed like that?”

Jemima:
“Oh, quite often. But I am never diminished by it. A little discomfort reminds the body that the spirit is sovereign. We forget that dignity is not convenience—it is command over appearance, over fear, over compromise. I wear this as a declaration: that I am not to be hurried or subdued.”


---

Mrs. Joan Meredith:
“I’ve heard you speak before, about your time in Berlin. You’ve such stories. Were you frightened then, behind the Iron Curtain?”

Jemima:
(nods slowly) “There was fear, yes. But more than that—resolve. We learned to listen, to notice, to wait. That’s something I carry with me to this day: the discipline of patience. And the confidence to speak only when it matters. Which is rare, but never forgotten.”


---

Mrs. Helen Browning:
“You should give a talk at the Women’s Guild, Jemima. About what you learned in all those years abroad. So many of us feel our lives have been rather… domestic.”

Jemima:
“Helen, do not underestimate the theatre of the domestic. What you arrange in your kitchen, what you say to a child, how you hold silence when others bicker—these are acts of statecraft as subtle as anything I performed in embassies. I should like to speak, yes—but only if we make it a conversation, not a lecture.”


---

As the coffee cools and the sun filters through the stained glass, the women linger—not just because of the biscuits or the fellowship, but because Jemima, in her stillness and elegance, reminds them of something they half-forgot: that to be a woman of faith, strength, and style is a lifelong art.

**Lilly**



I don’t remember exactly when my body stopped aching from tireless nights spent on the cold, hard floors, but it seems I’ve become accustomed to it. It’s comforting almost. I could probably afford a mattress by now, but I choose not to. It makes me feel like I’m in control of my life. Like I wasn’t forced to run away from home, from everything I’ve ever known and start again from nothing. It's my choice to sleep on the floor. It's been five years since I started running. It was my eighteenth birthday, and my father gave me no choice but to flee. Five different cities, all of which had ended with my brother’s and father tracking me down and almost catching me. This time I was able to secure a shitty apartment in an awful neighborhood quickly. It has four walls, a roof, a floor and a lockable door and that was all I needed right now. It's a much better position than I'd be in any other time I had to restart. I've slept on park benches and eaten out of bins. I've begged for change on the streets just to get by. I was making progress finally having a small place to crawl back to at the end of each shitty day. Id grown to liking this city, but nothing ever lasts long.



I had to get the first bus out of there after I spotted my brother’s standing by the car I’d bought out the front of the motel I had been staying at. It was a stupid mistake on my part thinking I could have a car in my name without them tracking it to my location. I was meant to be doing a shift at Thrive that evening. A strip club where I’d landed a job dancing and occasionally bartending. Instead, I walked out that morning to find my father’s pride and joys leaning against my car so casually waiting for me to admit defeat and hand myself over to them. Of course, I did no such thing and took off running before they could see me.



I ran forty minutes to Thrive, which painfully would have taken me only 15 minutes in the car. The whole reason I wanted the stupid liability in the first place. I just needed to get my last paycheck before I skipped town, so I had something this time around to start with. By the time I got there my feet were a mess from running barefoot. Usually, I would have carried my death trap high heels to the car and put them on once I’d clocked in, but I didn’t have that luxury this time.



I’d gotten there late for my shift and a complete mess, but thankfully the manager, Stacy took one look at me and knew something was wrong. I hadn’t told her anything too personal before, but she knew I was in a bad position when I’d first stumbled into the bar asking for a job. I had oversized filthy clothes and a serious matte in my hair from not owning a brush. My shoes were falling apart, and I was so skinny at the time. She took pity on me saying that we’d all been there once and everyone deserved a chance. She taught me how to dance, gave me some of her old outfits and let me crash on her couch for a while once she learned id had nowhere to go. Later she helped me secure a place of my own at the back of a motel and I had saved up enough for a cheap, shitty car. Things were going to well, until my past came back to bite me in the ass.



When I came stumbling into Thrive that night apologizing for being late, Stacy just silently pointed me to her office.



“I’m sorry I’m late, I can’t do my shift either…I just need the weeks pay and I’ve got to go” I said.



“Look darling, I’ve never pried before and I’m not going to start now. I can see you’ve been through some shit and you were in a real bad way when you first got to town so as your friend I’ve got to ask, where are you going to go?”



I took a long breath before saying, “I don’t know”.



“And how are you going to get there?”



“…I don’t know, a bus maybe?”



“And where will you be staying?”



“I don’t know! Look Stacy I appreciate everything you’ve done for me, but this is really time sensitive. I just need the pay, and I need to go.”



“Okay, just slow down love. I get it. I've known runners before. Someone for some reason has found you and you've got to move on, but I can't just let you run off into the wind not knowing anything about where you're going to go. We're friends, okay? I like you and I can help, so I will help. Let me make a phone call to my brother, he owns the club and has plenty of them in different places. We’ll get you transferred to a different club so you can keep earning money, then we’ll sort out a bus ticket and somewhere to stay.”



“You’re not going to ask why I’m leaving?”



“No. In my family, we’re raised not to ask questions we probably don’t want to know the answers to.”



I sat back and waited while Stacy made a phone call to her brother. It seemed like he also didn't ask many questions because it only took a few minutes before she hung up and told me he'd be happy to transfer me immediately and I could start tomorrow. She gave me my weeks' pay, drove me to the bus stop, kissed my cheek goodbye and that was that. It was time to run again. Hopefully her brother is as nice as her.



Satisfy


It took 8 hours to get here on the bus and by the time I arrived, it was early morning. Id rushed to the club she had me transferred to, Satisfy, so I could fill out some paperwork and get myself on their roster. Thankfully Stacy’s brother had told the manager Kevin that I wouldn’t be going on the payroll and instead I’d be getting cash just like Stacy had been doing for me. It was a relief really; I didn’t need a paper trail, and I didn’t want people asking questions why. Kevin had me put on the roster for that same evening, so I had more than enough time to find the hotel id organized and be able to shower and eat something before my shift started.



“Okay well, welcome to Satisfy! I’m thankful Luciano had you transferred here. We just lost three of our best girls so we’re extremely short staffed now”. He had said. He seemed nice enough. Short, dirty blond hair, medium build and a smile that somehow told me his mother must love him really well.



“Hmmm” I hummed in response. I wanted to be polite but at the same time I didn’t like having to divulge any unnecessary information if I didn’t need to. It was safer that way really.



“Okay great, all the paperwork is done so if you want to meet back here at seven, we can get you sorted out with a wardrobe, have a walkthrough and get you on the stage by eight”.



“A wardrobe? I have a few pieces of my own…”



“Oh no, just come in your own normal clothes, Luciano likes to give each girl their own wardrobe with everything they need.”



“Oh, okay, sure then, I’ll see you at seven... Thanks.”



Luciano was Stacy’s brother, who id learned owned over 20 clubs across the country that he had managed mostly by family, but this one, this one was his. Stacy had told me when she had called him, he was more than happy to have me transferred and needed me to be at the club he managed personally. I thought it was odd at first. Why not send me to any of the others? But I guess if Kevin was saying they were short staffed, that made sense. It was convenient for him.



Id managed my way to the hotel. I had just enough money for a week’s stay, that was if I didn’t spend any of it anywhere else. Which meant that the complimentary tea, coffee and biscuits in my room were going to be the only thing I would be eating for a while. That didn’t bother me too much, my body was used to running on less than what was deemed a normal amount of food. I took one of the sugar packets and sat down on the musty brown comforter on top of the hard bed. I’d have to go slow with what I had supplied so for now I figured a sugar packet would suffice until I’d finished my shift tonight. Maybe then I’d treat myself to one of the four biscuit packets. I tore off the top of the sugar packet, not caring about letting the rubbish fall to the floor. It didn’t look like the place was very clean to begin with, so I didn’t think it really mattered. Letting the sugar fall onto my tongue I let it rest there while it dissolved. A trick id learned from when I was younger, being locked in my room for days on end by my father with no food or water. Occasionally one of the staff that worked in the home would slide something under the door. It had always had to be small enough to fit through the sliver of space. Usually, a squashed piece of bread or candy. I learned quickly to eat little bits over a long period of time and to let it sit on my tongue so I could trick my brain into thinking I had more food than I did.



Shivering off the memory I made my way into the dimly lit bathroom connected to my room. It wasn’t much, but it did come with some soap and shampoo that I knew I desperately needed. I turned on the water and let it steam up before I stepped in, hissing as the water hit the tender spots on my feet from running without shoes. I used all the tiny shampoo that didn’t do much but made my hair feel dry and tangled. The soap was even worse, making my skin feel like rubber, but it did take off the stench id acquired, and I could at least be thankful for that. Hoping out of the shower and using the slightly stained towel to dry off, I used my fingers to comb through the mess of my hair and made my way over to the bag of things I’d managed to get from Thrive before I left. I couldn’t go back and get anything from my motel room there so I would have to make do with a pair of my stripper bottoms and the clothes id already been wearing. I guess it was a good thing Kevin mentioned I’d be getting a wardrobe at the club. Maybe there would be some stuff I could use until I had a bit of cash to buy some secondhand clothes.



It was just after 6 when I’d decided to have another sugar packet before grabbing my purse and leaving for the club. I’d need a little bit of energy to walk there and get the shift done. “Lilly! You’re early” Kevin said as id entered the club’s main doors. The place was still quiet, with just a few staff members looking to be setting up for the night.



“Uh yeah sorry, I didn’t know how long it would take me to get here so I figured it be best to be early rather than late.”



“No that’s fine, we can get started with your wardrobe, meet the other girls and get you ready for tonight if you’d like.”



Pure, dark, violence


We walked past the bar to the back of the club, Kevin pointing out different things as we went.



“We’ll do a proper walkthrough once we’ve got you set up but this here” he said as he pointed to a keypad by a red door. “This is for the girls only, of course with me and Luciano as an expectation.”



He showed me the pin and we walked into the room. It was much bigger than the changing rooms at Thrive. It has a thick, plush red carpet and black walls. Mirrors and makeup tables lined the walls, and a few girls were already seated and fixing themselves. I’m glad I’m not the only one who likes to be early.



“Hey! Ohhhh is this the new girl you were telling me about Kevin!?”



This blonde barbie looking explosion was bouncing out of her seat and practically skipping her way over in 8-inch pink stilettos. How she was even managing not to break her neck was beyond me. She had on a two piece bright pink leather bra and short shorts. Her breasts looked as though they might bounce up into her face and knock her out. Her platinum blond hair was pulled back into a high ponytail and she had makeup that made her look somewhat innocent if you didn’t look below her shoulders at the rest of her outfit.



“I’m Candy!” she said as she pulled me in for a hug that honestly felt like I should be paying for with how much I could feel her breasts pushing up against me.



“Is that because you’re all sweet and bubbly and shit?” I said before I could even register the blatantly rude tone I was using.



“Ha! Exactly, sweet like Candy and they all want a taste” she said giving me a wink.



“So, what’s your name?”



“Oh sorry, Lilly” I said giving off a half smile.



“Nooo, girly you need a stage name! Lord knows my parents would never have named me Candy. We pick a stage name to protect ourselves from any creepers trying to weasel into our outside lives.”



“Oh, well I don’t have one.”



I didn’t need to tell her Lilly wasn’t even my real name so I never really thought it mattered if I used it in the clubs. If anyone ever tried to find me with that name, they wouldn’t. I made sure of that.



“Didn’t you get transferred here from another club?”



“Yeah?”



“So how did you protect yourself from creeps? What would have happened if someone used your name to say find out where you lived?”



“Oh well if anyone was a ‘creep’ I’d just punch them in the balls, poke my fingers in their eyes or snap their arm or something” I said shrugging my shoulders.



Candys eyes went wide, Kevin visibly stiffened beside me, and I only just realized what I had said was definitely not a normal statement from a 5ft nothing female who was meant to be dainty and seductive.



After what felt like an eternity but was probably just a minute of holding my breath, she laughed, like she really laughed. Bent over, holding her stomach laughing. Wiping a stray tear from her eye before it could ruin her perfectly set face she said, “Okay, so your stage name from here on out will be Violence” she said with a wicked grin.



Yep, I like this girl. After Candy shooed Kevin off, telling him the girls could handle it from here, I met the others and was shown to my own table. It had everything I’d need, all brand-new, high-end products. Candy explained how Luciano made sure every girl here was well taken care of with what they needed to look the part. Then she showed me to the wardrobes which were conveniently placed in between each table along the wall. Each girl got their own walk-in wardrobe that I swear was just as big as my current hotel room. It had the same red carpet and black walls with golden features and floor to ceiling on all four walls were lined with clothes, shoes and accessories. Everything looked new with price tags and after further inspection it was all in my size. From the breast cups down to the shoes.



“Haha, yeah, I looked just like that when I first saw my wardrobe. Everything here is handpicked for you, usually by Kevin, he has excellent taste and a way of reading what a girl’s style is.”



“Kevin picked all this out for me?”



“Well, no, not exactly” she said with not even a hint of trying to hide her amusement. “I was told your wardrobe was handpicked by Luciano.”



Why the hell would Luciano do this for me? How would he even know my sizes? I haven’t even met the man. I’m just some pity case his sister asked him to take on and he’s spent all this money and bought all these things with me in mind? That doesn’t make any sense...



As if she couldn’t tell or didn’t care for my internal brain battle, Candy grabbed my hand and squealed. Causing me to shift back into focus and squint my eyes at the blonde bubble of energy who was now pulling things out left right and center and pushing them up to my body. No doubt trying to picture what I’d look like in each piece.



“Okay yesssss! This is it, put this one on” she said holding up a black leather corset and underwear.



After id slipped into the outfit, I matched it with a pair of sturdy black heels that laced up around my calves and a black leather chocker that looked slightly more like a collar but fit the look I was going with. Candy helped do my long black hair into a slicked back, high ponytail and finished off with a smokey eye and a bit of blush and mascara. She said I didn’t need much makeup because my skin was flawless as it was, and she only wanted to enhance a few of my features like my electric blue eyes and soft pink lips.



“Oh dang girl, you really did a number on her Candy. The men will eat her up. You’re going to have some competition now.” One of the other girls, Ruby, had said as she stood behind us in the floor to ceiling mirror. Looking back at myself I was shocked. I mean I had outfits from Stacy and dressed up every night I worked at Thrive, but they were all her style. This, what I was seeing, this was me, pure, dark, violence.



Don't Be Nervous


The club was starting to liven up now, the music blasting, the lights flashing and people started flowing in through the doors. A strong smell of cigarettes and alcohol wafting through the air and a hum went through me from the bass of the music. Kevin told all of the girls where their stages were, and they all politely waved as they made their way out.



“Where do you want me?” I asked as I wasn’t yet given a stage to go to.



“You, my dear Violence have been requested to the VIP area by Luciano.”



“The VIP? Isn’t that usually reserved for the most experienced girls? I’ve only worked with Stacy for a couple of months, and I mean, I know what I’m doing but I’m sure of one the other girls here would be much better suited to your VIP customers.”



“Woah, slow down there, I can practically see your head spinning. Stacy already told us your experience, but she also told us you’re an absolute wonder on stage like you were born to be there. I’m sure Luciano just wants to get to know his newest girl. Come on, I’m sure you’ll do great. Plus, the customers up there give the best tips”. He said with a wink while holding out his arm to escort me to the top floor. I could use the tips, the two sugar packets id had in the last 24 hours weren’t doing me much good and I would eventually need to use some money for food and a backup plan. If there's anything I've learned over these last five years, its to always have a backup plan. In the beginning it was things like another park or bench to sleep on, scraps of food saved or a plan of the bus routes and towns. Since Stacy gave me the job in the last city though and I've had the taste of having a nice-ish place to sleep, I'm thinking a little bigger and I'd like to have enough money sitting aside for when I move again to get another apartment, clothes, toiletries, food, you know, the basics.



The stairs leading to the VIP section has a security guard at the bottom, he unclipped the rope and nodded to us to proceed up. I noticed the change in scenes almost immediately from the rest of the club. The main floor was packed with people now, it was brightly colored and energetic. I’m sure the flashing lights and rowdy customers would have quickly given me a headache. The top floor though, it was closed off from the rest of the club. Kevin showed me the pin to the door at the top of the staircase and when he opened it for me it was like stepping onto a completely different place. The music wasn’t as loud, still prominent but you wouldn’t have to yell over it. The lighting was dim but steady and the features of the room were mostly dark wood and black with a hint of gold and red. I stood next to Kevin, scanning the room, focusing on the stage at the back, it was large enough that I wouldn’t have to rely on the pole the whole time like at Thrive. This one had enough space that if I chose to, I could dance around it comfortably. True to the theme it had a golden pole, red lighting and dark wood making up the stage. I took a step towards its direction, ready to shut out the world and lose myself in the music with the promise of some easy cash, but Kevin placed his hand atop of mine on his arm before I could remove it. Giving him what I could only hope was a polite, questioning gaze he leaned closer to whisper in my ear. “The boss wanted to meet you before you get started. Don’t be nervous.”



Yes, because that’s what I needed not to be nervous I thought as my eyes snapped to the table to the right of the stage where Kevin was leading us now. Six large, well dressed, dangerous looking males were sat, all their eyes focused on me as we walked over. I was thankful now for the grip I had on Kevin’s arm as I’m pretty sure my stomach was ready to fall out of my ass at the sight of the largest man sat on end of the booth. He had jet black hair that was shorter on the sides and slightly longer on the top. Tattoos covered his hands and neck, I’m sure they led underneath his expensive looking suit too. I’m not even sure how his suit wasn’t tearing with how large his arms and thighs looked caressed in the material. Gold rings on his fingers were tapping mindlessly on his glass that I’m sure was filled with whisky. He looked like he’d drink whisky. He gave off a vibe that screamed Alpha male. He was dangerous and my stupid vagina couldn’t possibly understand that as it instantly heated when I finished scanning his Greek God gifted body and met his obsidian eyes. Nope, don't do that. I quickly avert my eyes and I'm met with piercing blues like mine. The man sitting next to him looks just as tall, maybe a bit leaner, blonde tussled hair and a boyish smile that makes me feel a lot more at ease. I scan the rest of the group and I swear there must be something in the dam water. Why are they all so massive? How the hell did Stacy grow up around these guys and not get pregnant? My ovaries are currently screaming at me to reproduce right now.



“Kevin” he said as his eyes flicked from mine to the male, I had forgotten I was holding on to.



“Mr Donatello, let me introduce you to your newest girl. This beauty here is Violence.""



He looks me up and down and smiles wickedly. His obsidian eyes stare straight into my soul.



Did My Heart Just Stutter?


**Luciano**



“Violence…” I said with a smirk as I held my hand out to the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. I didn’t bother to stand, no, that would give her an option to hesitate, and I needed her to know right from this moment that she was mine. I’ve never had my heart stutter before, being raised all my life to become what I am today never allowed for me to have such feelings. I am Don of the largest Mafia family in this country, my heart should not stutter, but this dark angel places her tiny soft hand in mine, that’s exactly what it did. I didn’t hesitate once I had her hand in mine. A slight tug and she was falling right into my arms. The hand I didn’t have a hold of came out to land softly on my shoulder and I placed the one I had on my other shoulder as I slipped my hand to the small of her back to bring her to sit on my lap in a perfect fluid motion. She's tiny against my body. Delicate, breakable but her eyes are fierce and hold a fire in them.



My sister, Stacy had told me about this girl working at one of my other clubs. She hadn’t said much, just that she appeared to be running from something or better yet, someone and needed my help to get her out of there. I initially agreed because I needed more dancers, but when I had my PI look into this girl, Lilly Ontario, he couldn’t find anything. Not a single trace of her ever existing anywhere and that intrigued me. Usually, even people under a false identity were an easy enough case for my guy but this girl has stumped him. I had called my sister back this morning after Lilly arrived to talk to Kevin. I needed to know more about her as I watched her from the security cameras in Kevin’s office. She was simply too breathtaking to just ignore. Stacy had told me about how she met her with nothing but the clothes on her back needing a job. She went on to tell me how after her first shift she had offered her a ride home as it was too late in the night to let the girl walk anywhere and when Lilly had pointed her in the direction of a park she quickly figured out where this girl has planned on sleeping and couldn’t allow it, so she took her home and let her stay on her couch for a couple of weeks until Lilly had enough cash to get a room at some shitty motel on the wrong side of town. There wasn’t much more of importance Stacy could tell me other than her clothes and shoe size and as my mind had tried to work out this pretty little anomaly I found myself at the mall picking out everything my brain could imagine her milky skin slipping in and out of. It’s usually a job I handed over to Kevin, but this girl did something to me, and I felt inclined to be the one to pick everything she would wear on that milky soft skin.



“oh... um, Mr Donatello…”



She was clearly thrown off by the sudden movements and didn't know what was happening. Good I thought, she will need to learn to trust me.



She was blushing a nice pink in her cheeks and oh man it looked so good on her. I wonder what things I could do to her to keep her blushing.



“Violence. I’m hoping you found everything you needed in the dressing room.”



“Uh yeah Sir, thank you, it was all more than enough and thank you for the club transfer.”



She was wiggling that tight little ass in my lap, no doubt nervous by my men and I, and I needed to remove her quickly before she felt how incredibly hard I was getting. That probably wouldn’t be the best first impression. Luca, my best friend and right hand was smiling at her like the bloody golden retriever he is, and she was shifting her eyes around on all of us unsure of where to look. It seems she settled on the floor. I made a note of teaching her out of that habit. This girl would learn to hold her head high in any room with me.



“Hmmm” I hummed. “Let’s get you situated on the stage then. My sister has asked that I take good care of you, so whenever you work here your only stage will be here in the VIP. I won’t have you downstairs with the rowdy crowd, okay?”



“Yes Sir, I understand, thank you.”



""I'm Luca by the way!"" he says as he holds out his hand.



""Are you going to swing me around and pull me onto your lap too?"" She says back with a little bite.



Luca looks at me with those stupid pleading puppy dog eyes like I might actually let him and I narrow my eyes to tell him to back off.



""Of course not, now that would be a rude way to introduce myself, wouldn't it?"" He winks and nudges me.



I roll my eyes and let the girl stand. I watch as she adjusts her outfit and steps back to Kevin.



""Ready to dance, Violence?"" Kevin says as she takes his arm again. The arm that I wish was mine. Fuck, really? Thats possessive of me...



She nods at him and they turn around towards the stage. I just sit and watch as that cute little ass struts away. Such perfect curves. I look at Luca who's doing to same thing and slap him up the back of the head.



""Hey!""



""Keep your eyes to yourself!""



""It's literally a strip club, Don and she, well she's something special to look at."" He wiggles his eyebrows and then rests his chin on his hands and continues watching her. I can't say I blame him. She really is something special.



A Lady Doesn't Tell.


**Violence.**



To say that man is intimidating is a definite understatement. Stacy had asked him to take care of me though and I guess having a man like that in my corner would be a real asset. Kevin helped me onto the stage, and I was more than ready to dance. Something I figured out quickly at Thrive was that I was somewhat of a natural on stage. I was able to shut off the world, turn on my blinders and feel the music as if I was the only person in the room. I transported from this world where I was a pathetic run away with nothing to my name, to another where I was a powerful force of seductive and sexual energy, a goddess of the night where men would bow before me to witness my enchantments. I took a deep breath as the song finished and I run one hand up the cold metal of the pole. Closing my eyes I hear the beat of the music begin and I imagine that I transform myself into a flame dancing around with the fire that burns within my soul.



After about three hours Kevin comes back to let me know it’s time for break. He lets me know I can head down to the dressing room to eat if I wish, but obviously I didn’t bring anything and I think he already knew that.



“Well, there’s a two-drink limit when you’re working, but they’re on the house. You’re more than welcome to stay up here at the bar and you’ll find some fruit we usually use for the drinks in the mini fridge. We rarely ever use them so you’re welcome to those too.”



“Thanks” I mumble, half embarrassed and swallowing my pride as I tell him I’ll take him up on the offer.



I pour myself a rum and coke and slice an orange that literally has my mouth watering at this point. The rum is refreshing and cool as it trickles down my throat. I settled in on one of the stools as I tried to zone out the room.



“Hey, Violence, right?”



I hear a gentleman to my right say as he walks closer and gestures to the seat beside me. He was probably in his late fifty’s, well built like the rest of the men up here. There must be steroids in the water or something. If you saw him from a far, you’d probably think he had a full head of hair but as he got closer I noticed he was completely bald but instead it was tattoos that lined his head and bits of his face. His neck and hands were also inked, and he gave me the impression he could probably snap my neck in a heartbeat of he wanted to. His smile was warm though, something I wasn’t as accustomed to. Just like every other male up here his suit said, ‘I have money, a lot of fucking money’.



“Do you mind?” He gestures to the stool next to mine.



“Yes, of course, please” I say as I show that it’s fine he wishes to accompany me in my break. Which it most definitely is not. I hate small talk or talk in general. Why do you need to be here in my space? But I’m not going to say that, no, I need this job, and apparently this orange too as I can’t stop myself from devouring it. I had grown too comfortable with somewhat healthy eating habits and now I was suffering for it on the stupid two sugar packets.



“You’re an absolute dream up there darling, and your demeanor off stage too. Most girls can’t help but hang off the guys up here. Nagging in our ears and trying to get into our beds. It’s a welcome change. Something akin to how a woman should behave.”



“No offence Sir, but I couldn’t care less for your bed or the money dripping from you. I’m just here to earn my money and eat my free orange, but I will say you’re wrong if you think I behave anything like a fucking lady should”.



I couldn’t help myself. It just came out like word vomit when I should have shoved it into a mental vault and smiled ‘like a lady should’.



“Haha! He bellowed. “And a sharp tongue too. I guess that’s why they call you violence right?”



“Hmm something like that.”



“Would there possibly be another reason for the name?”



I raised my eyebrow in interest as I let the last orange skin drop down onto the plate in front of me.



“Maybe there is, maybe there isn’t. A lady doesn’t tell her secrets.”



“Well, that may be exactly what my club is looking for.”



He slides a white business card over to me discreetly and I look down to see it has nothing but an address on it. I’ve seen cards like these before, given it’s been a long time, but I would know the signs of an underground fight club anywhere. After all, my father owned one and trained me to fight before I could even walk.



“When?” that’s all I needed to know, because there was good, fast money in them and that is exactly what I needed.



“Ha, I knew I was right. I could see the fire in those eyes. Mondays and Fridays, 2am to 5am”



“And the password?”



A smirk formed across his stubble ridden face. He knew I wouldn’t be able to get in without that, but also didn’t tell me to see if I knew the way a fight club worked. Of course I knew, but I wasn’t about to divulge information I didn’t need to about how or why I knew how these things operated.



“Firefly.”



“Admission cost?”



“For you, Violence, I’ll cover your first round. You win that and you’ll have enough for a second round and some to pocket. Just tell Benji as the desk that Ronaldo has you covered.”



He finished his drink and went to leave before turning around.



“Oh, and this” he said as he pulled a stack of notes from his wallet and putting them on the bar in front of me. “This is a tip being such a lovely ‘lady’ to watch tonight.”



I nodded my head and smiled like I should have done to begin with before taking the money. I went to fold it and put it straight into the cup of my corset along with the business card, but my eyes snagged on the amount. Holy shit, there must be at least $500 here. I’m definitely eating all those biscuits tonight. If this man’s fight club was anything like my dad’s, then maybe I could get on my feet faster than I thought.



Don First.


The rest of my shift went by really quick, and I managed to get a butt ton of tips although I hadn’t had a chance to count how much yet but by the feeling of how full my cups were, it’s more than enough to call this a running start. Id noticed Luciano’s eyes on me most of the night, which kept pulling my attention to him, but I guess every man up here was obviously going to stare at the seductively dressed female dancing on a stripper pole. I also kept getting overly excited looks from his friend Luca. That almost threw me off from the mask I was wearing a few times. He's got that contagious sort of smile that makes you want to smile back. I headed to the dressing room and told the girls about my night. Candy asked if I needed a lift home, but I politely denied, lying through my teeth that I had a lift. I do not need people getting close. I take what I need and nothing more, that's the safest option for everyone. When all the girls left, I made my way into my wardrobe to find my discarded outfit from earlier today but I promptly noted that there seemed to be a section of clothes that looked like everyday wear. Although it was odd that the owner of a club would provide normal clothes for the girls, I was extremely thankful and snagged a fresh pair of jeans, a white shirt and a black hoodie. Slipping out into the fresh early morning air I took out my phone to map the safest way back to the hotel. Most women would think it would be safer to take main roads with streetlights, but I knew better. Back roads, alley ways and the dark of night were my friend. I would regularly slink around in the dead of night unseen. My way of thinking was if no one knew you were there, how could they grab you?



It took half an hour on my detour route back and I immediately devoured the biscuits and started counting the tips from my night. Almost $2000, holy hell, I never made that much at Thrive. I decided that tomorrow I would try to look for a shitty apartment, hopefully one where I could pay with cash, and I’d need to find a gym to work out how rusty I had gotten fighting. Id kept up my stamina over the years, I usually liked to work out once a day to stay in shape. Usually at parks because it is free, but I would need a bag to gain back some muscle memory before Monday. Two days’ prep would have to be enough.



Having sorted out my plan for tomorrow I decided to pull the comforter off the bed to the floor where I know I would feel safer. I always felt safer there.



**Luciano**



I sat with my men in the VIP section of the club most of the night. We had plenty to discuss with upcoming shipments and deals and when we were through with that I asked about my men’s families. Family was very important to us. I was raised alongside these guys. Our parents treated us all like siblings and would always remain close. I watched over Violence all night while talking with my guys. I was trying to be discreet about it, Luca was not, and I wanted to stay until her shift ended so I could ask to drive her back to wherever she was staying. Kevin hadn’t been able to get much personal information from her this morning when going through the paperwork with her and when he’d asked for a home address, she’s merely told him she didn’t have one yet. When he asked then for the address of where she would be staying, she told him that she had not yet checked into a hotel but would happily update him with that information when she had. By now she should have checked in somewhere so I wanted to drive her after her shift so I knew exactly where I could find my little angel.



My friend Matteo had gotten a phone call an hour before the club would close for the night. He excused himself to take it in my office off the side of the VIP section and when he came back, the look on his face told me it was going to be an even longer night.



“Boss, we just got word there’s been a sighting of Angelo near your sister’s club.”



“Well I guess we had better head there and check it out then.”



Angelo Salvatore was number one on our hit list and had been ever since he put my father six feet under 5 years ago. They had a meeting to discuss a possible alliance with gun trades but instead that idiot put a bullet in the back of his head before he even knew it was coming. He’s somehow been evading my men and I ever since. As much as I wanted to stay and make sure Violence got home safe, I needed to be Don first. Downing the last of our drinks, my men and I headed out for the night to travel the 8 hours to my sister's club. Maybe I could even get some more information of my little angel while I'm there. We took a few cars, leaving some men behind with Tony to look after things here while we were gone. If we could get a lead on Angelo I'd follow it like a hound. I've dedicated my life to killing him, my men have too. You don't just kill a Don and get away with it. I will follow him to the pits of hell if I have to just to get revenge for what he's done. He's like a bloody cockroach though and every time we get even the slightest tip of where he is, he's gone.",1,1749714925.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Hii I have been lurking on this sub for a long time and hoping for some words of encouragement or positive stories about healing. Yesterday I posted my birth story (I will link it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PregnancyUK/comments/1l93mzt/graduation_everything_went_against_plan/)) but to summarise it, I had precipitous unmedicated back labor as a FTM, sustained a 4th degree tear, almost bled out, underwent 2 surgeries to repair the damage in my rectum, bladder and cervix, then somehow developed postpartum HELLP syndrome with no history of preeclampsia, escaped sepsis somehow, all followed by a 5 day stay in ICU. It's now almost a month later and baby is doing amazingly. We are blessed that she made it easy for us.

  
I do need a little bit of advice though from more experienced mums! I have only been one for less than a month and still figuring it all out.

1. Any advice on how to make recovery and healing easier or faster? Or any products you used to be able to enjoy life outside again a little bit? I know I need to take it slow but I am losing my sanity being trapped in my bed or sofa for 20+ hours every day. I still cannot do any housework except for washing dishes, I cannot carry my baby for long, I cannot walk further than 1 mile, sitting down still hurts. I would love to get out again and it's hard mentally when even getting a coffee hurts so bad. 
2. Breastfeeding wise, baby had formula and some expressed milk for the first 10 days - now my supply is very low and she also does not tolerate any formula too well (gets stomach pain, is unsettled and sleeps for hours after). How can I increase my supply as I would love to exclusively breastfeed? I think the first 10 days of barely expressing any kinda ruined mine already. I know I should not but I feel guilty about her getting formula too, so how do I deal with this guilt?
3. Did anyone else also feel there was very little support for postpartum recovery? I had a midwife and the health visitor ask once how I was doing and when I said not too great (also got PPA on top of course) they just told me to get a therapist and do some mindfulness exercises. I work as a researcher in clinical psychology so this rubbed me the wrong way. I also got very little follow up on my physical injuries and was told upon discharge that my GP would look at it at my 6 week appointment. Are GPs even trained enough to assess injuries of this extend? (Not to be rude, just general curiosity as I am worried they will miss something major). I tried to make an appointment to get checked but they told me it was not necessary as I am able to use the toilet and recovery is expected to be slow and to keep an eye on my blood pressure basically. 
4. How do I deal with anxiety around my partner being out of the house for most of the day? He works as a surgeon so has long unpredictable shifts. Bless his heart but when he comes home he has to do all the houswork and then takes care of the baby so that I can rest, shower, etc. I always worry something is going to happen when I am alone. I also would love to hear any advice on what I could get him or do for him. I tell him how much I appreciate it all but I don't think that's enough.

  
I don't need all 4 answered by everyone, I would just really appreciate any advice on the above. I am still dealing with all of this, got the birth debrief meeting in 2 weeks too so hopefully I can get some closure and clarity then but for now, I am soaking up all the wee precious moments with my LO.

1l9gmqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/cheating_stories/comments/1l9gmqj/am_i_wrong_to_ask_my_partner_to_cut_contact_with/,Am I wrong to ask my partner to cut contact with the woman he cheated on me with?,"To clear, this woman is his ex-wife. Partner and I had lived together for two and a half years, during which time he was working through their horribly acrimonious divorce that involved lawyers, courts, five-figure sums of money, and her weaponising their teenage daughter and trying to turn her against him.

Without telling me he inexplicably cancelled the divorce process and embarked on a five month period of betrayal, gaslighting me every time I confronted him with my - as it turned out completely correct - suspicions (telling me I was paranoid, overreacting, etc). Genuinely I don’t think they actually slept together - I know conclusively from her that they hadn’t had physical relations for 10 years before the marriage broke down - but I still consider it cheating that he two-timed us and resumed his marriage with her, unloving and passionless as it was, before doing me the courtesy of being honest and breaking up with me first. 

It culminated with him moving out of our shared home and back in with her without telling me first - I found out four weeks later from a third party while I was abroad and alone, and the whole time believing he was still my partner. The whole saga was horribly traumatic.

Rightly or wrongly, four months later we agreed to try again on the basis that we still loved one another. He moved back in with me six months ago. I made it a condition that he cut contact with his wife, with the exception of discussing their now 18-year-old daughter and whatever contact is necessary to finalise their divorce. I think this is reasonable - I conceded that they still need to co-parent, but in order to rebuild trust after the two-timing, for my peace and well-being I need it fully established that his loyalty is with me and me alone.

However, he is now complaining that he ‘doesn’t want to be controlled and told what to do’ by me. He has twice gone out for coffee with her, because she claimed she wanted a shoulder to cry on. She messages him all the time about random things and he always replies, even though by his own admission she is horribly manipulative and just uses him. I do not consider myself a controlling person - I’ve never once before dictated who he can and cannot see - but I think it’s fair enough that I don’t want him to continue unnecessary contact with the woman he betrayed me with? He doesn’t seem to care how much it hurts me and causes me anxiety - he just dismisses me and gets annoyed when I explain it to him. 

Setting aside that I need to decide whether I made a mistake in taking him back after all the hurtful things he did to me, is he right when he says that I am wrong to ask him to cut contact with her other than when necessary to co-parent?

TL;DR My partner of two years betrayed me with his ex-wife and moved out of the home we shared to get back together with her, all without telling me (I was abroad at the time). Rightly or wrongly we got back together, and as a condition of rebuilding our relationship I’ve asked him to cut contact with her other than to co-parent - but he refuses. Am I in the wrong?

I recently watched a compelling YouTube video, “রঠা'র লেখা জাতীয় সঙ্গীত থাকবে কেন ?”, translated as ""Why would there be a national anthem written by Ratha?” by Dr. Pinaki Bhattacharya, who comes from the Hindu upper caste and has extensive experience in communist politics. His insights about Muslim history in Bengal were not only unexpected but also deeply thought-provoking. I was left speechless by his perspective.

My father grew up in Calcutta and often frequented College Street Coffee House, where he engaged in various discussions about East Bengal. This familiarity provides me with a strong understanding of the mindset of upper-caste Hindus. However, Dr. Bhattacharya stands out as an exception; he passionately and confidently speaks the truth, regardless of the implications.

Following the 2008 election in Bangladesh, I felt a pressing need to share the truth with the Bengali people, particularly regarding the events of 1971, which I have firsthand knowledge of. Journalist Sagar Sarowar and I planned to create a YouTube documentary, but tragically, he and his wife were murdered on February 11, 2012, by Indian intelligence, who seized the hard drive containing our hard-won evidence.

The motive behind this assassination was clear: Indian intelligence feared that our documentary could shift public opinion in Bangladesh and threaten India’s interests there. Ultimately, their fears manifested on August 5, 2024. In my view, Allah has replaced the lost voices of truth with Dr. Pinaki Bhattacharya and journalist Elias Hossain. As the saying goes, “They planned, but Allah also planned. And Allah is the best of planners.” (8:30)

History of the Bangladesh Military.

The Mitro Bahini was established as a result of intense negotiations between Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Tajuddin Ahmad following Indira's visits to the United States, France, and West Germany in November 1971. During these discussions, Tajuddin Ahmad agreed to the concept of an “India-Bangladesh Confederation” but acknowledged that the situation could change if Mujib returned from West Pakistan.

In 1971, the Indian Army had a standby force prepared with the specific objective of launching an offensive against East Pakistan. This readiness was one of several factors that influenced India's delayed response to Pakistan's initiation of Operation Searchlight in March of that year. At that time, the Indian Army's Eastern Command was primarily focused on defending the northern and eastern borders and addressing ongoing insurgencies in regions such as Nagaland, Mizoram, and among Naxalite groups in West Bengal. The Mukti Bahini, a guerrilla force engaged in the fight against the Pakistan Army, received support from the Indian Army through a coordinated effort known as Operation Jackpot. Under the leadership of General M. A. G. Osmani, the Mukti Bahini forces were organized into 11 geographical sectors to enhance command and control efficiency. Their ranks included approximately 30,000 regular soldiers, comprising three brigades, eight infantry battalions, and three artillery batteries.

It's worth noting that General Osmani was committed to maintaining strict military regulations. He did not allow the training of underage individuals in the Mukti Bahini. Contrary to some claims suggesting that children as young as ten were trained to assist the Mukti Bahini, Osmani's leadership upheld the standards of military conduct. The Mukti Bahini conducted operations from within India, collaborating with the Border Security Force (BSF) and employing guerrilla tactics against the Pakistan Army. They were not operating from inside East Pakistan.

In preparation for operations in Bangladesh, the Indian Army Eastern Command restructured its forces by merging two existing infantry corps, the IV Corps and the XXXIII Corps, and establishing a new corps known as II Corps. Additionally, the 101 Communication Zone was reorganized as a combat formation.

On November 21, 1971, a joint command structure was formed for the Indian and Bangladeshi forces in the eastern theater, led by Lieutenant General Jagjit Singh Aurora. This unified force became known as the Mitro Bahini. Alongside 29 battalions of the Border Security Force (BSF), Mukti Bahini guerrillas, who were operating near the border or stationed in camps within India, were organized into infantry companies and assigned to various Indian military formations.

Initially, General M. A. G. Osmani expressed his refusal to the creation of the ""Mitro Bahini"" and acknowledged Lieutenant General Jagjit Singh. Following this, Tajuddin Ahmad engaged in negotiations with General Osmani for several days. During their discussions, General Osmani made it clear to Tajuddin Ahmad that he held the position of Chief of Command and that Tajuddin was also under his authority.

Afterward, Tajuddin Ahmad briefed Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on the situation. In response, she consulted with General Sam Manekshaw. As a result of their discussions, General Manekshaw issued a verbal order to Lieutenant General Jagjit Singh Aurora to proceed with the formation of the ""Mitro Bahini,"" effectively bypassing General Osmani's authority.

Aftermath of the East Pakistan Civil War: 

Following the East Pakistan Civil War, from December 14, 1971, to March 14, 1972, East Pakistan was under the occupation of the Indian military, led by Lieutenant General Jagjit Singh Aurora. Upon the withdrawal of Indian forces on March 14, 1972, Bangladesh faced significant challenges and crises. 

During this period, various factions debated about the formation of the military organization to be established in the country. Some suggested the creation of a Red Army, while others advocated for a Confederate Army, the Rakkhi Bahini, or the Gonobahini. Amidst these discussions, my father advised General Osmani to organize a military organization in preparation for the imminent Indian withdrawal. However, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the Bengalis’ Father, opposed this idea, asserting, ""We have no enemy; we do not need an army."" Instead, he proposed the formation of the Rakkhi Bahini for civil defense. 

Following the establishment of the Bangladesh military, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi engaged in discussions with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. During their conversation, Mujib expressed the necessity of forming a military force, stating the importance of appeasing the Razakars. He emphasized his commitment to creating the “Rakkhi Bahini,” a paramilitary organization intended to enhance security and support the emerging nation.

The military of Bangladesh, which includes the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Bangladesh Rifles (BDR), was established with personnel and structures that originated from the former Pakistani military, including the Army, Navy, Air Force, as well as the East Pakistan Rangers and Razakars. It is a common misconception that all members of the Mukti Bahini were absorbed into the Bangladesh military. In reality, the Mukti Bahini consisted of various groups, and many of its members faced significant losses during the coup, counter-coup, court-martial and gang fight, which impacted the efforts to stabilize the war-torn country.

Different leaders had varying visions for the military structure: Serajul Alam Khan supported the Gonobahini, Khaled Mosharraf favored the Confederate Army, and Colonel Taher advocated for the formation of a Red Army. These differing perspectives highlighted the complexities and divisions within the leadership of the newly formed government.

It’s crucial to recognize that each of them fought for their own agenda; none were truly championing Bengali nationalism.

There is this friend of my dad who is *unmarried,drunkard, mentally unstable and as you can guess is sexually frustrated*.He hails from a rich family and because of his condition everyone in our native place is empathetic towards him.Everyone gives him a pass for whatever he says/does given his condition.He often visits dad as they used to be school friends.He is so vocal,loud and acts so silly(for eg:There was this time he came to our home drunk and dad was scolding him for drinking too much;I passed by them to fetch water and he suddenly fell on my foot crying *,'sorry,sorry;I see you as my son dear;from today onwards I will never drink'*.It was so embarassing for me).
But this is not the problem.The actual problem is that  past few weeks he started to come to our home very frequently even if dad's not there especially once mom comes home after work.My mom didn't care about his visits as he's a close one to dad.Initially he would just wait in the sofa till dad comes or might leave if dad's not coming anytime soon.Usually mom would give him tea and snacks,converse with him during those times.But over the days I saw him starting to exhibit questionable behaviours toward my mom and my mom let them all slid by given his condition.It is so embarassing for me as a son to see my mom letting him do that to her.
Yesterday evening is when I got fed up with all his antics;He came home when dad and mom were not home(as dad and mom went for a marriage).As I was the only one at home,I made him coffee and told about them not being home.He suddenly started to act silly and loud saying that he misses my dad and my mom;*then the drunken bastard started to comment how my mom is his angel,how she's the only woman he's been ever with,how she's the only woman in his entire life,how she's the one whom he's ever spent his precious time with and other things that can't be shared in public*. Following that he fell on the ground asking to meet dad saying he can't live without meeting his friend and stuff.I was so confused and angry that I really wanted to hit him.But before such things happened he himself came to senses,for some reason forced his golden ring in my hand saying that it's his gift for me (dad returned it back today) and literally moved swiftly out of home.
This should really stop before anything worse happens.

**TLDR: Dad's mentally unstable,drunkard, unmarried, sexually frustrated childhood friend exhibits very questionable behaviour towards my mom which she allows out of sympathy or whatever and this should stop before anything bad happens.**",2,1749714460.0,TwentiesIndia,3,1.0,False

I have had periods of anxiety and depression for a long time. I’m 26M, and after a particularly bad depressive period I started seeing a therapist. Therapy/that therapist in particular didn’t do much for me, but my primary physician prescribed me a low-standard dose of an SSRI, which I’ve been taking for about a month.

The meds seem to be working very well, but I’m almost a little paranoid that I might be experiencing mania, or some form of it. One of my best friends has a form of bipolar, which he manages very well with medication, so if that’s the case I’d kind of just like to keep an eye on myself and react accordingly. 

Before starting an SSRI, I often had a really bad sleep schedule and keeping up with my ideal diet and exercise, finding motivation to do tasks, talking to people, and things like that could all be very difficult at times. Right now, possibly because I’m not in a depressive episode, that’s all surprisingly easy.

I go to bed at 9 or 10 thanks to melatonin, and will be up between 4:30 or 6:00 most days, workout a bit, make coffee/breakfast/lunch, shower, and go to work early. Work’s a breeze; it’s a fairly active delivery job, but I never run out of energy, and I can talk all day and I never run out of things to say. I get home and I don’t really want to look at a screen (kind of hard to settle and veg out) so I’ll listen to music, maybe cook, or do some errands. Repeat.

A lot of these changes are really good, but I  feel at times like I’m talking too much. I like cracking jokes and giving people a little attitude when I know they can take it, but I almost feel like a lot of the people I’m talking to are just too nice to ask me to shut the fuck up. I don’t think that I struggle to focus on the task at hand, but I have been going on cleaning/organizing sprees some weekend days.

It feels kinda silly to be paranoid about being genuinely excited to go see friends and parents, and enjoy spending time with them. But at times I stop and think “oh shit am I having a manic episode”? That’s kinda how I’m feeling though, so any input is appreciated!",1,1749714110.0,bipolar,1,1.0,False

Ground rules: this is not about who has the most Force power or coolest saber or whatever, this is about who you’d actually want going forward if you were constructing a team from scratch tomorrow, taking into account age, vibes, mental health resiliency, ability to thrive in Heat Culture (important), and general narrative equity within the galaxy. Basically it’s a Force-adjusted Trade Value Guide but for extremely online Jedi nerds who also have a spreadsheet open in another tab that just says “PLO KOON DEFENSIVE METRICS.”

⸻

Tier 1: Franchise Cornerstones You Do Not Trade

Ahsoka Tano

The first pick and it’s not particularly close. Zero baggage, elite perimeter defense, plays multiple positions, already left two toxic systems and somehow got better at everything. I have her penciled in as Kawhi Leonard if Kawhi occasionally delivered inspiring speeches and journaled about it later. Spo would love her. First name on the training camp whiteboard.

Luke Skywalker (post-ROTJ)

He’s basically running your offense through pure vibes and wisdom at this point. Think of him as Steph post-2017 — does not need to score 30 to dominate a game, makes everyone better just by existing on the floor, also has fully embraced the concept of joy, which many in the Jedi Council have not. I want him on my team, I want him mentoring my rookies, and I want him in the team group chat sending supportive GIFs.

Grogu (projected)

I’m sorry but if you’re not seeing the upside here you’re not paying attention. We’re looking at a 50-year-old with elite defensive instincts, generational charisma, already has the team buying in, still years away from physical prime. It’s literally Giannis on a rookie deal if Giannis also occasionally levitated frogs and was beloved by the galaxy’s youth demographic. You don’t trade this. You build around this.

⸻

Tier 2: You Can Win With Them But Know What You’re Getting

Obi-Wan Kenobi

High floor, extremely professional, will do everything right, just don’t expect him to carry you emotionally through a Finals run. I’m thinking Kyle Lowry vibes — deeply respected, tough as hell, might lecture a young teammate about defense but also will dive for loose Force artifacts like it’s Game 7. You need one of these guys on your roster.

Rey Skywalker

Still raw, still figuring out how to play within a team construct, but the flashes are undeniable. On the right roster could absolutely be a closer — I have her somewhere in the Jamal Murray range if Murray occasionally struggled with self-identity and cosmic lineage but still managed to cook in big moments. Huge upside, slight emotional volatility risk.

Plo Koon

People who know, know. Elite defensive communicator. Will never seek the spotlight but will absolutely be the reason your team wins playoff series. Basically Jrue Holiday but with a mask and better vibes. I want this guy in my locker room and I want my GM talking about him on podcasts as “one of our foundational culture guys.”

⸻

Tier 3: High Variance, High Stress

Anakin Skywalker (pre-turn)

The upside is borderline illegal. If it hits, you’re getting multiple titles. If it misses, your entire franchise burns to the ground and your GM has to go on a long mental health leave. This is the Westbrook comp through and through — pure talent, force of nature, terrifyingly intense, one prophetic dream away from turning on everyone. I’m taking him late first round in my fantasy Force draft but I’m not sleeping well about it.

Mace Windu

Elite defender, big moment toughness, but just a complete handful personality-wise. This is Draymond Green — you love having him when things are going well but when they’re not he’s delivering post-game interviews that leave your media relations staff in tears. I respect the hell out of Mace but I’m not making him my captain.

Cal Kestis

One of the best value plays out there if you know how to use him. Not a pure #1 option but incredibly switchable and will absolutely swing a playoff series with his hustle and instincts. I have him in the Tyrese Maxey mold — fast, scrappy, a little reckless, but trending upward and universally respected.

⸻

Tier 4: They Still Matter But We Are Lowering Expectations

Yoda

The legend, the brand, but it’s time to be honest — the modern game has passed him by. He’ll give you veteran presence, wisdom minutes off the bench, and absolutely dominate the occasional Council meeting, but he is not winning you playoff series anymore. Think late-career Duncan or Haslem on a vibes-only contract. Still valuable but not moving the needle on the floor.

Kit Fisto

I mean… fun, great smile, occasional poster dunk equivalent, but gets cooked the moment the Sith press hits. Gerald Green Force comp. If you’re relying on him for major playoff minutes something has gone terribly wrong.

Quinlan Vos

Nobody knows. The ultimate mystery box. Could be a breakout star, could be playing pickup in an Outer Rim league by mid-season. This is the Dillon Brooks bet — you’re either a genius or you’re getting fired.

⸻

If I’m building a roster today, I’m taking Ahsoka first, Luke second, and absolutely stashing Grogu for the future. I do not trust Anakin unless I have the strongest possible locker room culture and an elite Force therapist on staff. And I’m getting Plo Koon on a multi-year deal before the rest of the market figures it out.

1l9gglw,https://i.redd.it/ksh9r2ad9g6f1.png,I've built a new app with the help of another app’s users,"Hello, my name is Giacomo, I’m an aspiring indie app developer. I say ""aspiring"" because I still work full-time for a company (also making apps, but not mine). In my free time, I like to create apps hoping that one day they’ll support me entirely.

Today, I want to share the story behind my latest app: **Trio** — a 3-in-1 daily planner.  
[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/daily-schedule-trio/id6743801522](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/daily-schedule-trio/id6743801522)

A few years ago, I built a simple checklist app called [**Check Me**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/check-me-checklist-widget/id1644081033). It was one of my first apps, nothing fancy, just a clean way to make checklists. To my surprise, it slowly gained a loyal group of users.

Then I started receiving lot of feedbacks. People loved the simplicity but they were using Check Me also for other purpose like: habit tracking, task scheduling, periodically to do list. And they were asking me new features to support these use cases. At first, I resisted. Those features didn’t fit what Check Me was meant to be.

But the ideas stuck with me. I kept thinking… what if I made something new instead?  
What if I created an app that brought together the essentials of daily organization: **habits**, **to-dos**, and **events**. All in one clean, unified experience?

That’s how the idea for **Trio** was born  
Once I had the concept, I got excited. The first thing I did was design the UI, something clean, fast, and intuitive. I wanted an app that didn’t overwhelm you with buttons or clutter, but gave you exactly what you needed.

But just as I started, life got in the way, work, personal stuff. I had to put the project on hold. For months, all I had was the idea and the UI sketches sitting on my laptop.

Fast-forward to about a month ago, and I finally found the time and motivation to bring Trio to life.

Now it’s real and I can share it with you!  
Here is some of the main features:

# ✅ Today View + To-Do Queue

* Assign to do to specific days, or keep them in a flexible queue for future planning
* Support for recurring tasks (e.g. every week, every month). They will appear in the queue, every time it's needed to complete them again
* A focused Today view with all your tasks, habits, and events — no bouncing between apps

# 🌱 Habit Tracker

* Build habits that recur daily, on specific weekdays, or a set number of times per week
* Visualize your streaks and track progress over time
* Share habit progress screenshots to stay motivated or compete with friends

# 📅 Events + Countdowns

* Add events with built-in countdowns
* Choose when upcoming events appear in your Today view
* Calendar sync with your device — import events from your existing calendars automatically

# 🧩 Widgets (iOS)

* Today Widget: Glance at your day right from your home screen
* Habit Widget: Check off habits without opening the app
* Countdown Widget: Show upcoming events or deadlines — even ones from external calendars

So yeah, what started as a simple checklist app eventually led to this new adventure, shaped by user feedback and a long wait to finally build what I had in mind.

Now, **Trio** is live and to celebrate the launch I want to give a free year to everyone here on reddit, I will put the link with the promo in the comments

1l9gdkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1l9gdkk/it_should_be_perfectly_acceptable_for_straight/,It should be perfectly acceptable for straight people in relationships to have opposite-sex friendships with no need to behave differently from same-sex friendships,"Many people are uncomfortable with letting their partners be friends with the opposite sex. Those who are comfortable typically introduce some boundaries, such as not letting their partner go out for a coffee with just their opposite-sex friend, watching a movie with their opposite-sex friend or just having more meaningful conversations with them.

These boundaries are not present when it comes to same same-sex friendships and I believe it is inherently limiting everyone's life experiences for no good reason. Everything that you typically do with a male friend you should be able to comfortably do with a female friend, no matter your own sex.

If an opposite-sex friend were to hit on you and try to do something inappropriate, it is up to you to tell them to stop or end the friendship if they don't.

Broadly speaking, people who want to cheat will eventually find some opportunities to do it anyway. I prefer that my partner cheats on me and I find out at some point rather than spending my life with a person whom I think **would** cheat on me if given the chance. I want to know that I am spending my life with a good person who is in love with me, not a person who would leave me if I gave them the opportunity.",17,1749713472.0,unpopularopinion,27,0.65,False

Prompt one : “Love thy neighbour.”

Edward is a 33-year-old man living in a quiet, middle-class suburban neighborhood. His life appears, on the surface, to be rather ordinary. He works as an IT technician—a job that provides stability, but little satisfaction. His personal life has been a series of quiet disappointments.

A year ago, he went through a devastating breakup with his wife. Their marriage had barely lasted a few weeks before she discovered his secret—his homosexuality. She tore apart his character, denouncing him to their mutual friends in the church community they had once been a part of. The slander was swift and brutal. Edward found himself cast out—not just from his marriage, but from the very social network that had once been his anchor.

One of the few constants in Edward’s life now is his neighbor, Roy, who has quietly become a close friend. Roy lives next door in a house that’s a stark contrast to Edward's modest home. The house, with its three floors, basement, and—oddly—its wine cellar, seems almost out of place in this suburban neighborhood. Roy, tall at 6'4"", often towers over Edward, who stands at 5'9.

Every Saturday and Sunday evening, the two of them find themselves on Roy’s front porch, drinks in hand. It was a warm afternoon when Edward—Eddy, as Roy called him—found himself in the garden again. Trimming dead stems, watering the soil, and watching as the flowers bloomed every spring.

For a moment, he caught a strange, faint odor. He took in a deep breath, trying to pinpoint the source. At first, he thought it was the compost pile near the fence, but that didn’t quite explain it. The smell wasn’t like rotting vegetables; it was heavier, more organic.

He considered Roy’s house next door. Maybe Roy had been hunting again and had left some animal remains out to decompose? The day wore on, and the mild scent lingered. The windows were dark, and Roy had been quiet all day. There were no signs of movement, no headlights in the driveway, nothing to suggest Roy was home.

Edward’s feet itched to investigate, but he hesitated. What was he supposed to do? Knock on the door and ask if Roy had left a dead animal out for too long? He took a step toward the fence, and then stopped.

The next day, a Saturday afternoon. The sun hung low in the sky, casting a golden glow over the neighborhood. Roy appeared at the end of the driveway, walking toward Edward’s. His broad shoulders pulling at the sleeves of his T-shirt. His hair.

“Eddy!” Roy’s voice was warm and boisterous, like they hadn’t spoken in months, not just a few days. “Look at this! The garden’s looking fantastic. These roses, man.”

Edward smiled. “Thanks, Roy. It’s just a lot of patience, I guess.” He straightened up from his crouch, brushing off his knees as he dusted his hands on his jeans.

Roy’s grin widened. Roy’s smile curled into a more knowing, almost self-satisfied grin. “Well, I’ve got a bottle of 2015 Château Lafite Rothschild down in the cellar. You ever had that?”

“2015 Château Lafite Rothschild?” Edward repeated, trying to keep the tone casual. “That sounds pretty fancy.”

Roy’s eyes lit up. Edward felt a flicker of discomfort. Just a pinch of discomfort.

Edward wasn’t exactly a wine connoisseur, but even he knew that Château Lafite Rothschild wasn’t just something anyone could casually open up on a Saturday night.

“I mean, sure, sounds great,” Edward said, trying to sound as casual as possible. “If you’re offering, I’ll take you up on it.”

Roy clapped him on the back with a little more force than necessary, his eyes lingering for just a moment too long before he stepped back. Edward smiled awkwardly, watching as Roy walked back toward his house.

Eddy looked back down at his garden, the roses now seeming somehow less beautiful, less peaceful, than they had before.

Later that evening, Edward stepped inside, the familiar scent of Roy’s home—wood and leather. Edward took the glass, swirling it for a moment before taking a sip. The taste was exquisite.

“So, how’s work been?” Roy asked, casually settling into an armchair across from him.

“Same as it’s always been,” Edward said, smiling softly. Edward added, “I noticed something... Is the plumbing in your house okay? I mean, I’ve been smelling something... a little off? Could be coming from the pipes or something.”

Roy’s smile didn’t falter. He leaned back in his chair, looking almost amused.

“Rot?” Roy repeated. “We’ve had a bit of moisture in the basement recently—pipes can get a little musty down there...”

Edward nodded.

As the night went on, the taste of the wine started to lose its charm, and a faint dizziness crept up his spine. Roy, still watching him, leaned forward, his elbows resting on his knees.

“How’s that wine treating you, Eddy? Feeling good?”

Edward wiped his forehead with the back of his hand. “Roy... I think I need to—”

But before Edward could finish his sentence, the room seemed to sway again.

Roy didn’t say anything at first. He simply leaned back in his chair, his smile widening just slightly, as though he were savoring something.

“Take it easy, Eddy,” Roy said, his voice low and almost... soothing?

The words echoed in Edward’s head like a warning, but he couldn’t focus enough to make sense of them. His limbs felt heavy, his head too light.

Slowly, with the faintest flicker of dread, he realized something was terribly wrong.

Edward tried to push himself to his feet, but his body felt unresponsive. He reached out, fumbling for the edge of the coffee table to steady himself, but it seemed to drift just out of reach.

Edward’s breath hitched in his chest.

# Prompt 2 : Life in prison…

In the fractured ruins of what was once the United States, a poetical tyrant named James McAuthor has risen to power. McAuthor presents himself as a visionary leader, a man of art and intellect, cloaked in the charisma of a savior. But those who dare to oppose him whisper another name in the shadows: *The Antichrist*.

Jayson Ryan, once a respected college professor turned underground activist, dared to speak out. He published a manifesto denouncing McAuthor, accusing him of using poetry and language as tools of control—subtle, hypnotic chains that bind the minds of the people. For his defiance, Jayson was imprisoned.

Now locked away in a high-security facility, Jayson is treated as a madman. The guards mock him daily, sneering as they pass his cell. They call him *""The Prophet in Chains.""* He talks to the walls, scrawls cryptic symbols into his food trays, and mutters strange phrases under his breath. To the world, he is a lunatic. But beneath the surface of his madness, a terrifying truth waits to be uncovered.

Jayson now rots in Blackridge. officially designated for the “Linguistically Compromised”—those whose speech is considered dangerous. His cell is cold and metallic, illuminated by a single buzzing light. Time is a fog. Days blur. Nights bleed.

At first, the guards only mocked him lightly.

They mimicked his old lectures in singsong voices. *“Language is a living thing,”* one would say, clutching his chest like a stage actor. *“And guess what, teach? We strangled it.”*

But as the weeks turned, the mockery turned sharp.

The guards—there’s something wrong with them. Jayson sees it in the way their eyes don’t blink enough.

they take photos. ""Just documenting the madness,"" they say.

But Jayson knows. They’re not just guards. They’re watchers, sent by McAuthor

1l9g7x9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1l9g7x9/aio_for_yelling_at_my_mum_that_she_cant_make_me/,"AIO for yelling at my mum that she can’t make me take weight loss injections, and to worry about the effect she has on my health first?","This happened just yesterday, and I’m feeling pretty conflicted. There’s plenty of context, so strap in for the ride. I [18M] live with my mother [46F] and my little brother [9M]. My mum is multiply disabled in her spine, hips, and legs, and is housebound. She’s also clinically obese, in the 120kg [something around 260lbs] range if I remember correctly. Because of said disability, I do most of the work around the house - cleaning, laundry, grocery shopping, cooking, all that jazz. I also take my little brother to and from school on buses, an hour of mixed bus riding and waiting each way, adding up to four hours a day. Needless to say, I’m exhausted, have no time to myself or for a social life, and can’t get a job or go to uni because of my full-time carer responsibilities. My girlfriend and I live only an hour or so away from each other and we’re practically long-distance because I never have time to go over to hers or invite her over, or time or money to go on dates. But I digress.

The thing is, my mother blames her disability on her weight. I don’t disagree that it could exacerbate her issues, but I really don’t think it’s the main cause. She’s genetically predisposed to arthritis, and has fucked up her bones through years and years of fad dieting - most recently, she’s been living off of under 1000cal worth of apples, pork, and black coffee a day - notably very little calcium. In addition, she had a very physically traumatic birth [with her as the baby], resulting in her having her hips absolutely shattered at birth and having to wear basically a metal diaper for a long while, and this is also why the back of her head is flat (this was in Poland in the late 70s btw, idk how it got that bad either but this is how she tells it).

She’s always made me go on these fad diets with her, ever since I was about seven or so. At one point, it got so bad that I resorted to shoplifting candy bars and similar high-calorie snacks from grocery stores just so that I wouldn’t starve. I’m not proud of it, but it’s all I could do. One of the notable diets I remember is the Copenhagen Diet [if you don’t know about it, it’s a highly restrictive meal plan diet that keeps you under 700cal a day] when I was a growing kid. All this had much the opposite effect of what she intended, making me more inclined to eat a bunch of junk when I finally got the chance.

I’m eighteen now, and stand at 5’2 with a weight of 100kilo [about 220lbs]. I have a suspicion that my malnutrition as a kid led to me being so short, but I digress. I’m pretty happy with my weight. I like how it looks on me. I’m far happier fat than I ever was at a lower weight. It feels right, it feels like me, I like me better like this. But my mum has been getting on my ass about losing weight again, blaming my heavy breathing (caused by stress and overwork) on my weight and such. I’ve been brushing off her comments, until today.

The two of us were talking, and the subject came to pockets. She mentioned that she once lost a ring by putting it in a back pocket, and I joked that I never use back pockets because my butt is so big that nothing fits. She, out of nowhere, said “speaking of! [mom’s boyfriend] is leaving you two 7mg injections of mounjaro!”. I was a little taken aback, and asked why, to which she said “because you need to lose 20kilos at least.” I said “I’m not doing that,” she said “yes you are.”

We went around in circles with it for a while, and at one point she even offered me £25 for every kilo I lost, until I reminded her that I’m eighteen and she can no longer legally force me to do anything medically. She told me to call the cops on her, then. I said “I won’t. Unless.” Empty threat, obviously, but I was overwhelmed and pissed off at her, and didn’t know what else to say. She said “one word too many,” I said “the most important one,” and I went off to do the dishes.

I did all the stuff I have to do around the house, and my mum kept trying to casually chat to me as if nothing happened. I tried to be polite, but kept things succinct. At one point, she told me, casually, “I love you.” I responded “I love you too,” but I guess my tone must have been off because she said “that sounded tired,” sarcastically, in a way that makes it clear that it’s a reprimand and not just a comment. I said “I do love you but I’m a bit ticked off from earlier. This doesn’t change anything but it’s hard to say I love you right now,” which in all honesty I’m pretty proud of myself for phrasing so calmly, but I digress.

She got pissy with me, yelling at me that she just cares about my health and that, if I don’t lose weight, I won’t become as disabled as her when I’m her age, but within the next 5 years. I said to her that that makes no sense, and that while her weight probably made her pre-existing conditions worse, she has early onset arthritis and had her hips absolutely shattered at birth, and that probably messed her up far more than her weight has. She kept pressing that it’s about my health, at which point, and this is where I may be overreacting and/or the asshole, I snapped at her and yelled “how about you worry about the health effects of all the stress and isolation you’re putting me through first?!”

There was a beat of silence, and then I apologised for snapping and overreacting. She said it’s fine, but her tone was snippy and teary, and she started looking around the room to find stuff for me to do, i.e. trash to pick up or dishes to take out or clothes to fold, as she tends to do whenever she’s upset at me.

I did all those extra little tidbits, and since then, we’ve pretty much been pretending nothing happened, but I still feel really bad for getting so upset. I understand that her condition is really really bad and she needs me to be her carer, and that she definitely is grieving the loss of her health and wants to protect me from the same fate, but I can’t help but be upset at her trying to force me to lose weight when it’s one of the few things about myself that I actually like. I dunno, Reddit, am I overreacting here?

Watching younger guys make the same mistakes I did, so here's what I wish someone had told me before I learned it the expensive way:

1. Your appearance matters way more than you think.  Used to think ""looks don't matter, personality is everything."" That's half true but personality matters, but nobody gets close enough to see your personality if you look like you don't care about yourself. Started lifting weights, buying clothes that fit, and getting decent haircuts. People treat you completely differently. Not fair honestly but I had to live with it.
2. Most career advice is terrible. ""Follow your passion"" and ""do what you love"" sounds nice but pays terribly. Better advice: get good at something valuable, then find ways to enjoy it. Your dream job might be a nightmare with a boss and deadlines. Build skills that pay well first, then pursue passion projects on the side with actual money in the bank.
3. Networking isn't about using people. Spent years thinking networking was fake and sleazy. Turns out it's just being genuinely helpful to people in your field. Answer questions, share opportunities, make introductions. Most good jobs come through connections, not job boards. The guy who helped me get my current role? Met him in a random conversation at a coffee shop.
4. You can't negotiate from a position of weakness. Whether it's salary, relationships, or business deals - you need options to have leverage. Stay in shape so you're not desperate for any relationship. Keep your skills sharp so you're not desperate for any job. Save money so you're not desperate for any paycheck. Desperation kills your negotiating power.
5. Clean eating changes everything .Used to live on pizza, energy drinks, and whatever was convenient. Thought food was just fuel. Started eating actual meals with vegetables and protein. Energy levels stabilized, sleep improved, mood got better, even thinking got clearer. You literally are what you eat - choose accordingly.
6. Your 20s are for building, not consuming. Watched friends blow money on cars, clothes, and experiences while I was learning skills and saving. They looked cooler at 25, I look better at 32. Your 20s are when you have energy but no money. Use that energy to build skills, relationships, and savings. The fancy stuff can wait.
7. Most people don't think about you as much as you think Spent years worried about what others thought of my choices. Turns out most people are too busy worrying about their own stuff to judge yours. That embarrassing thing you did last week? They already forgot. Make decisions based on what's good for you, not what looks good to people who aren't living your life.
8. Confidence comes from competence. ""Just be confident"" is useless advice. Confidence comes from knowing you can handle what comes up. Get good at things that matter  fixing problems, making money, staying healthy, building relationships. When you know you can figure stuff out, confidence becomes automatic.
9. Your mental health affects everything else. Used to think therapy was for ""weak"" people and just powered through stress and anxiety. Finally got help at 29. Wish I'd done it at 19. Your brain is like any other part of your body  sometimes it needs maintenance. Taking care of your mental health isn't weakness but maintenance.
10. Quality beats quantity in almost everything Better to have 3 close friends than 30 acquaintances. Better to own 5 high-quality items than 50 cheap ones. Better to be great at 2 skills than mediocre at 10. Better to have one meaningful relationship than a bunch of casual ones. Focus your energy on fewer things and do them well. I realized this after how my friend who hone his skill for a decade got a into a big internship after I have applied for it a lot of times.

I hope this helps. I just wanted you guys to learn this lessons. Took me so long and I want to preach it more. So you guys don't go through what I did.

1l9g5is,https://i.redd.it/wdiokjqs5g6f1.png,How do you pick rugs for a room?,"I have no sense of design. Unfortunately, my husband (newly married) has even less than I do. Previously, the only art I had on my wall in my house that I lived in for 7 years was a single scribble drawing my husband's kindergarten cousin drew me. So it's not hard to say that I'm clueless.

Some background:
We're moving to a very small studio appt in NYC where the space is roughly 200 square feet. We are making a custom lofted bed with dresses underneath, so we thankfully save space on dressers. 

We did measurements of the place, and I made a size accurate mock up of the space. The top left square is my husband's table, limited by a radiator thing that's 7 inches into on either side of the window. The table is as wide as will fit there. The couch on the other side won't work because the notch on the top right corner is narrow, so the Ikea cube things won't fit nicely, and it'll leave an empty space where my husband's desk would be. The bottom right square is a placeholder for a dinning table, likely a drop leaf table for space saving when not using. The couch is a pull out couch we own.

The issue is:
I know we'll want carpet to soften noise and for comfort for me to sit on the ground like how I like to do (ideally by the coffee table). There can't be a rug immediately behind my husband's desk. How big should a carpet be? Round or square? Where would you place it? I'd also take any suggestions for rearranging the room.

I looked at the clock on my bedroom wall. I think I have delayed the inevitable for as long as I physically can.","# Chapter 1 Bailey

I looked at the clock on my bedroom wall. I think I have delayed the inevitable for as long as I physically can. I should go to the packhouse to go and wish our pack's upcoming Alpha a happy birthday. The bane of my life. My brother’s best friend. One day to be Alpha Miles. Today he will turn 17, and meet his Alpha wolf. In all honesty, he was egotistical enough, thinking the world revolved around him, without him adding to that by finally gaining his wolf. Not your run-of-the-mill werewolf either. Oh no, Miles Davenport was destined to be an Alpha, so he would have a strong and powerful Alpha wolf, only adding to his arrogance and strength.

The crazy thing is, Miles had once upon a time been one of my closet friends too. In my younger childhood... Friends, that kind of thing comes when your father is the Beta to the Alpha. The children spend a lot of time together, and become friends. My older brother, Jordan, became the wing-man to Miles. His closest friend and ally, who as his Beta when the time came, was only right. But as the years went on, the friendship between Miles and I changed.

Friendship faded as he grew into a more popular sports star of our school. At the end of the day, he was always going to be popular, he was the upcoming Alpha after all, but as one of the top sports stars too, he was idolized. As was my brother. All the girls in school flocked around them like they were pop stars or something, and it was bizarre. I was nothing more to him now but a source of amusement for him and his sports buddies. A geek. Not one of the beauty queens who followed him around. Simply someone to make fun of.

I had gone from enjoying time with my one-day Alpha, to hating him, in the space of a school year. He thought he was god’s gift, and in all honesty, if he was, he is a gift I would return…

“Bailey!” I heard my Mum call from downstairs, telling me I was definitely running it close now for time. I know Jordan had already headed over to the packhouse a while ago with my Dad to meet his friend and our Alpha.

“I know.” I yelled back, looking at the books on my desk, desperate to continue with the assignment I was working on. I would so much rather continue working on the assignment and gain the additional credit available, work toward going to the college I want to go to instead of going to a party for the big-headed bully, I got to consider almost family, considering he was the son of my Dad’s best friend.

I stood from my seat, and walked to my mirror, adjusting my black skater dress I had chosen to wear today. Something plain and simple, easy to blend into the background, but a dress all the same if anyone asked why I hadn’t made an effort. Along with my chunky black sandals, I looked presentable, not that anyone would be looking at me. Today, all eyes would be on the birthday boy, as they always were. He would make sure of that. I flicked back my curly brown hair, before I walked out of the door, already dreading the hours that lay ahead…

My Mum pulled the car into the parking spaces outside the packhouse, while my younger sister Morgan was flicking at the curls around my head, simply trying to irritate me. She knew I would rather be anywhere but here right now, and was loving every last moment of it. “Aww, you want to go home Bailey-boo?” she teased.

“Stop you two, come on, your Dad is waiting inside. Let us go and find the birthday boy.” Mum says, sounding cheerful, completely oblivious to the fact how horrendous this party had the potential to be. She, too, worshiped Miles. Having seen him grow up alongside my brother, she seemed to think the sun shone out of his rear-end. It had always driven me insane.

“He won’t even notice us there.” I muttered under my breath as I followed her up the steps of the back house, shaking my head at my sister and how overdressed she looked. She definitely looked like she was out to impress someone today. A small part of me wondered if she hoped she might be the fated mate of Miles. After all, he was meeting his Alpha wolf today. He will have shifted for the first time today, and today could potentially be the day he can sense his fated mate out there waiting for him! There had been so much buzz around school about this, so many of the girls were excited about the potential possibility they could be his fated mate. The one chosen for him by the moon goddess. The one destined to be with him. So many of them are desperate for it to be them. While there I was desperate for anything but. I could think of nothing worse! Yet, looking at the amount of effort my younger sister had made today, I am beginning to think she was one of the many she-wolves that was holding out that hope…

We walked through the corridors of the packhouse, and it was filled with various pack members. Today was a day of celebration within pack, the birthday of the upcoming Alpha. And not just any birthday, the day he came of age. The day he met his Alpha wolf. The walls of the packhouse were adorned with decorations, music was blaring from various speakers dotted around the multiple rooms.

“Ooff, sorry!” a giggling she-wolf said to me as she nearly knocked me off my feet as she knocked into me. I would rather be anywhere but here right now. This was far too hectic and far too loud for me. I simply glare at the back of the girl as she moves away from me, not a care in the world.

I followed my Mum and my sister, who was almost skipping as she walked, toward the main lounge area. I can only assume my Mum had mindlinked my Dad to let him know we had arrived, and he said they were there, or else we could spend all day looking around for them! It appeared almost every member of the pack had turned up to celebrate the birthday of Miles fucking Davenport.

The lounge area was laden with people, music truly blasting, and everyone seeming to have a good time. Everyone but me. I caught the eye of my brother, leaning against the wall of the lounge, the furthest away from the door we had just walked into. He nodded in my direction before simply turning away.

‘Could have made an effort, Bailey.’ he mindlinked. ‘It is a birthday, not a funeral, you know?’

I felt my heart sink at his words. Great, the insults were starting already, which meant it would only be a matter of time until Miles started too. The two of them seemed to like working together like that. Finding great enjoyment in harassing me. I was only a year younger than both of them, and had desperately hoped the name-calling and insulting would ease off as they got a little older, but if anything, they seemed to get worse. All because I wasn’t like the girls they were interested in, I was sure of it. I wasn’t like the other girls. Made myself an easy target, my Mum told me, all because I enjoyed studying. Liked reading and learning. Said, I only made it harder for myself. The plan was to make it easier for myself by finding a way out…

“Jordan says your dress looks like you are going to a funeral, Bailey.” Morgan teased, fluffing up my curls again. My long brown hair fell in thick, unruly curls down my back. They drove me mad at times. Especially when my brother and sister decide to mess with them.

“Oh well, I wore a dress, like you asked.” I snapped, moving away from them, feeling angry already, so tempted just to turn around and walk home, only to be pulled back by my Mum.

“We are going to wish Miles a happy birthday. You will stay for a while at least. I do not need to be explaining to your Aunt and Uncle yet again why you have walked out on a social event, Bailey.” Mum warned me, her tone sounding grumpy, I swear she had to have read my thoughts on leaving the party already. I am sure she hated having me as a daughter, likely wishing for one that was more sociable, and one that enjoyed being a part of everything, instead of one that would rather have her head in a book.

“Awww, Happy Birthday, Miles!” I heard my sister squeal from by my side. I swear she spoke at a pitch so high only dogs could hear. Goddess knows why she is so excited. It is only his birthday. He likely doesn’t even care, he never normally does…

As I looked up, his blue eyes were locked on me, I raised my gaze to meet his, and could see his eyes shift to a darker blue… was that his wolf? I see a snarl across his face as he suddenly storms from the room. What the hell was that about?

‘Get out here.’ Miles is suddenly mindlinking me, and I have to say he sounded far from impressed. That, combined with the angry expression on his face, told me something was off. Would he have rather I had not come? Well, he was not the only one…

‘What?’ I questioned, completely confused. Was he annoyed over how I had dressed too? Jeez, it was just a dress. Does it really matter? I would go home if it was.

‘Outside now.’ He demanded once more, sounding even more irritated this time, making me realize I had little choice but to follow his orders, so I snuck away from the ongoing party back to the doors of the packhouse.

Only to find Miles pacing along the bottom of the steps, looking a mixture of confused and angry. So why did he need me here? Someone to take his anger out on? I was not willing to be that, I was sure about that… Just as I was about to walk away, he looked up.

“Fucking took you long enough.” He snapped.

I frowned, unsure what this was all about, but it was making no sense to me as I looked down toward him from where I stood at the top of the packhouse steps. His blue eyes shifted to the dark blue once more, like they had inside, taking me by surprise. His wolf is clearly lingering…

“What is wrong, Miles? Do you want me to get Jordan?” I asked.

“No I do not! I do not want anyone knowing this.” He snarls, a growl slipping from his lips, though whether that was aimed at me or whether his wolf was angry at him, I do not know…

“I don’t think I understand…” I began.

“You soon will.” He sneers, and I simply look to him in confusion. Nothing he says makes sense to me. Until he continues. “Only today did I realize. The thought makes me sick. Why our own moon goddess would play a trick like this on me, I don’t know. I am an Alpha. A fucking Alpha. I deserve a strong mate. A beautiful mate to be proud of. Not some feeble pathetic wallflower.”

My body trembles at his words. No. I had yet to gain my wolf. I did not know this yet. Why… Why him of all people? “I am your fated mate?” I question with a shaky voice. “Are you sure?”

“Are you fucking doubting me?” he yells. “And you won’t be. The moment you have your wolf, I will decide when the time is right to reject you.”

My heart twists and contorts at the thought. Rejection was meant to be the most painful thing possible. Why would he want to reject the mate chosen for him by our own moon goddess? Am I truly so repulsive?

# Chapter 2 Bailey

A Year Later

Yet another birthday party for our beloved upcoming Alpha. Ha. Not my beloved upcoming Alpha. I hated the fucker. Breaking my heart without a second thought. What I had done to deserve that I had never got a proper explanation from him. Other than the frequent insults, of why would he want to be with someone like me? Did I look like Luna material to him? I had no clue. What the hell did Luna material look like in his eyes? Some blond bimbo, no doubt. They were the she-wolves he tended to spend his time with within our pack. The ones who worshiped the ground he walked on. That would do anything he asked of them. Ones that I highly doubted read much more than the work set of them at school.

“Bailey!” my Mum yelled at me from the stairway of our family home. “Will you hurry up?!”

“Do I really need to come to the party?” I responded. “I am telling you, Miles will not be bothered if I am not there!”

“Your Aunt and Uncle will be though. And I am not explaining to them again why you are missing.” My Mum continues yelling. “Do you not realize just how many events you have missed this year, all because you have your head in a book?”

“Yeah Bai-Bai. Such a geek. No wonder you have no friends.” My sister Morgan giggles from outside my bedroom door.

“Piss off.” I hissed. “I have friends.”

I stormed from my room, and down the stairs toward my waiting family. I planned to greet the birthday boy, not that he would care in the slightest. I know that he would rather not see me at all. And then I would sneak home.

“Ew, are you wearing that?” Morgan asked.

I looked down at the skinny black trousers I had on and the white tank top. Great. I can’t win. Nothing I wear is approved of by my sister, evidently named the fashion queen without my knowledge. Oh well, I am dressed and wearing it. I think it looked good with my chunky black sandals I had on…

I scowled at my sister and walked out of the door. “Are we going or not?” I snapped at them all, truly not able to wait for the following month when I leave to go to university. Get away from them, and this pack!

The party was well underway when we arrived, music pounding from the speakers as couples made out in every available space, so I averted my eyes as we walked through the corridors of the packhouse to the lounge where we would no doubt find Miles reigning over his people. Being all important, like he was partial to considering himself.

‘Why are you here?’ Miles’s voice filled my mindlink, before I had even fully entered the room behind my parents.

Great. ‘I didn’t get a choice. Trust me, I would rather not be.’ I snapped back.

I was getting more than a little tired of the way he would treat me. Yes, he planned on rejecting me. Decided I was not for him, but he could have left it at that. I didn’t need treating like I was some sort of social pariah because of the fact he decided I was not right for him. I do not think I deserved that. I had endured enough bullying through my time in high school, for the fact I enjoyed my education.

‘Oh. Excuse me? Are you implying you were not going to come to the party of your next Alpha?’ Miles links with some serious attitude.

‘Miles, you just asked why I had bothered coming. Now you are asking if I was not going to come? Make your mind up.’ I argued.

‘Remember who I am Bailey. You are not above me. Never will be. Could have been equal to me at most had I seen you as suitable to be my mate, but no. You were beneath that honor.’ He sneers.

I felt anger racing through me. ‘And you think I would not have rejected you?’ I snapped, moving back toward the exit, not wanting to be here anymore. Until I felt a hand grabbing the back of my tank top, yanking me back.

My eyes darted upward to see the dark eyes of Miles. Sneering down at me. Our Pack’s upcoming Alpha. The most arrogant man I think I have ever met. One, thankfully, I did not have to be mates with any longer as the stupid fucker had chosen to reject his own fated mate before even giving her a chance. “Going somewhere Bailey?” he asked, his voice full of spite.

“Well, I do believe you asked me why I was here, so I assumed you wanted me to leave.” I told him.

Miles bows his head down so it is level with mine, he inhales deeply, like he still enjoys the scent of me. He has done this numerous times of late, which I find quite bizarre. But, I ignore him as he tilts his head to look at me, “Hmm, I think my Mum and Dad may have something to say if you leave. Their clever little Bailey. Heaven forbid.” He presses his forehead against mine. “Just stay away from me, and do not spoil my fun.”

I shake my head in disbelief at him, as he stalks away. Did he even think for a moment I would be going near him if I could avoid it? I would rather be anywhere but near him!

“Bailey, why are you harassing my friend for?” I heard my brother, Jordan demand, as he suddenly approached, causing many people to turn around and look at me. Wonderful. Nothing like starting pack gossip is there. I am sure Miles would appreciate that!

“I wasn’t harassing him, he came to speak to me. Asking why I had come.” I told him, and my brother laughed. He is as much an idiot as Miles. Any of my friends who have big brothers hate how protective they are. Me? No, my big brother is the one leading all the bullying and being a total dick to me. He finds great embarrassment in the fact his younger sister is far from being one of the popular group, and is, in his words, ‘far too into her books’. I think, in all honesty, my entire family found me, in one way or another, a huge embarrassment.

“Well, he has a point. Not like you will be joining in with the celebrations. You will probably be sitting in a quiet corner somewhere reading.” He teases.

“Well, it is certainly more intellectually pleasing than any of you would be.” I smirked at him as I walked away from my brother who was standing looking confused. I am sure he had no clue what I meant. The scary thing is he will be the next, pack Beta. Heaven help our pack. Between him and Miles they only had one brain cell between them, and that was one that they shared, I am sure of it! And even then, I think it was rechargeable and started losing power and knowledge at a rapid rate! They only graduated high school because they paid people to do their work for them.

As I snuck away, out of the busy lounge to the top of the stairway, where I hoped to hide out for as long as possible, I heard footsteps behind me. I quickly turned, hoping it was simply someone on their way to their bedroom or even to one of the spare bathrooms on this floor. But, sadly, luck was not on my side tonight. No. Miles was following me. Eyebrows raised and looking quite irritated.

“Oi. I want to talk to you.” he demanded.

“You asked me to go away a minute ago, didn’t you?” I asked him.

“Don’t think so, think it was more a case of why you were here.” Miles says with a smirk. Sitting on the top step with me.

“Miles, you have the whole pack here for your birthday, I am sure whatever you need to speak to me about can wait.” I shrugged, desperately craving peace, which, considering the pounding beat of the music playing, would be difficult.

“No. Why didn’t you tell me you were leaving?” he questions, like he is irate at the fact I had not let him know. Why would I let him know?

“Why would I? We aren’t friends, Miles. You also are not my Alpha yet. It was arranged with my parents, me and your Dad, as Alpha.” I explained to him, unsure why this would even bother him. If anything, I would think he would be glad to get rid of me.

“You are going away though.” he murmurs.

“That is generally what happens when you go to college or university. Yeah.” I said with another shrug.

“There wasn’t one closer to home?” he hisses. “Because it seems to me you picked the one furthest away.”

“What does it matter to you? You hate me. I won't be here, You get your wish of being rid of me.” I snapped, truly sick of him trying to dictate to me what I should and shouldn’t be doing. I had worked hard in school, so I could do this. My parents had spoken to my Aunt and Uncle, the Luna and Alpha of our pack to allow me special permission to go to a university out of state to study, saying it was what I had dreamed of. I had nothing holding me back. And, with the fact Miles did not want me for his mate, or his Luna, I truly did not. Not that any of them knew of that. That was our own secret.

Even despite the pull to him as my mate since my wolf had arrived, I still found him truly repulsive. He sickened me. Though, the pains when he slept with the many she-wolves that visited his bed, made it even easier to detest the man that he had become. I still had no clue what I had done to deserve this treatment from this man, other than not being one of the popular group. But, I knew I deserved better than him.

Miles glanced at me, momentarily a thoughtful look passed over his face, almost caring, before a hardness replaced it. “That much is true. No more having to see the disappointing failure the moon goddess made of mating me to you. At least not for a few years. Who knows, perhaps you will meet someone while there. I suggest you do. That way you won’t have to come back, because, I, as Alpha, will be looking for my Luna.”

“Miles, I honestly do not care if you find someone else.” I told him, going to stand and head home, not wishing to spend another moment in the same place as him.

As I went to move away, he grabbed my hand, pulling me to him, so I was once more sitting level with him on the top step of the first floor landing of our packhouse. “Always so righteous aren’t you Bailey? You say you don’t care? We will see. Well, this will be on my terms. I, Miles Davenport, reject you, Bailey West, as my fated mate…” he began, and my head began to whirl as his words sunk in. The realization and excruciating pain of what was happening becoming too much for me…

# Chapter 3 Bailey

Three Years Later

I drove the long road down to pack. I hated this drive. It was like returning to hell for me. Lotus Shadow Pack. My very own version of hell. Though, three years away, studying had been truly amazing. Transforming myself into the woman I should always have been. Confident. Self-assured. Brave. Just me. And now a fully qualified teacher.

As a she-wolf, you spend so many years of your life being told your focus is finding your fated mate. Settling down with them and creating a strong matebond. A love. A family. Well, once I had come to accept that my naïve, teenage dreams would never surface, thanks to the moon goddess pairing me with a mate so incapable of loving anyone other than himself, I decided that my focus would be my career. My education had always been something I took great pride in. I loved to learn, and I had decided that I wanted to pass that gift along. I no longer cared what others thought of me. And, while at university, it felt so wonderful to be surrounded by others who felt the same way. I finally felt like I fit in somewhere.

And, I believe that is what allowed me to become the person I was meant to be. However, now, I had to return to my pack, at their orders. The agreement was, once I had completed my degree, I would return home. Unless, of course, I had found my fated mate. But, I knew within my heart, that was never to happen. For, my fated mate sat at home. Lording it over our pack. Acting like he was the best thing since sliced bread. Sleeping with any she-wolf that came near him, from what I heard, having rejected me.

I pulled up at our guarded pack gates. Harley, one of our pack warriors, currently on guard duty, stepped forward to my car window. “ID” he ordered.

I frowned at him. I do not think I have been asked for ID before when returning home, even in all the times I have visited home, though in all fairness, those visits have been few and far between. My visits were only when they were required of me. I had grown to loathe this place, and coming back had become less of a priority for me over the time I was away...

“Harley, it is me. Bailey.” I explained, trying not to smile at his mistake.

Harley looked at me closer. “Shit. Sorry Bailey, didn’t really recognize you there. You changed your hair. And you aren’t wearing your glasses. You look good.” He says with a shrug, quickly looking away, clearly embarrassed by his faux-pas.

I smirk at his response. Yes, my hair is somewhat tamer than it used to be. The curls straightened out, and my hair now neat and sleek down my back. My glasses I had worn for reading had been long gone. Having got my eyes fixed with laser eye surgery whilst away. Plus, I now wore a little simple make-up to accentuate my features. Nice to know somebody has noticed a difference…

“No problem. You still need ID?” I asked him.

He grins at me. “I think I know who you are. Nice to see you.” he nods at me in acknowledgment as the gate opens for me. “Maybe catch you around while you are back.” He adds as I begin to drive away.

I smiled in response, I guess there would be nothing to stop me catching up with any guy I wanted to now. Not that I was really bothered right now... but it was not like I had a fated mate to wait for any longer. And it wasn’t like Miles was making a point of staying single. Every time I had returned home, he had had a different she-wolf on his arm. Parading them through pack like a prized possession, only to have traded her in by the time I returned on my next visit. He was turning into quite the lothario. And quite a joke in my eyes.

I set off along the quiet, familiar roads of our sweet old pack. The evening sun was settling in the sky as I moved my car down the route to my family home. No doubt my Mum would be there waiting for me, perhaps my Dad, if he was in from work by now. My brother and sister, I was unsure. They still both lived at home with my parents, but were back and forth to friends' homes and my brother was looking to move into the Beta suite in the packhouse soon enough, in preparation for taking on the role from my father when the time came. Either way, they rarely bothered to rush home to see me when they knew I was returning. I don’t think seeing me was at the top of their priority list…

I pulled my car up on the street in front of my familiar family home. I could not believe I was home. Stuck back here. The dread within my stomach churned heavily at the prospect of many years stuck here. Miserable and unhappy, with no way out, now my fated mate had rejected me. Not that anyone other than Miles and I knew of that. No. He had decided he would be considered weak if others knew an Alpha had gone against the powerful Moon Goddess’s choice. So, this was our secret. Or he would make me pay in ways I did not want to imagine, apparently.

And, in all honesty, I did not want to think of it. He had allowed me to go away to do my degree. Doing the final bit of convincing when my Uncle, the current Alpha, and Miles’s father, along with my parents were on the fence. Or, so he said. How true that was, I would never likely know the truth, but it had been for that reason, and that alone I had chosen to do as he had asked.

If he had done the things he said, then he had allowed me to fulfill my dream of gaining my degree of teaching away from pack. To allow me to be just me, not the daughter of the pack Beta. And I have thrived because of it. But, now, I had to return. Back to where I belonged. And, while I may have gained my degree, I had no real future prospects. I was likely stuck here.

I stepped from the car, determined more than ever to find work, as I heard my Mum’s voice. “Bailey!” she greeted me from the porch steps, a big smile upon her face. “You look beautiful sweetheart.”

I smiled back at her, as I moved toward the front door. Only to see Miles leaving the house next door to ours. The Alpha home. Could I have timed my arrival home any worse?

His eyes met mine, giving me a dark stare before looking at my Mum. “Hi Aunt Brianna. You didn’t say she was home today.”

Mum smiled at Miles like she thought the world of him, though most of the time she generally did. “Ah, I think it slipped my mind. Bailey is home for good now, Miles. How wonderful is that?”

Once more, Miles gave me a dark stare. “Hmmm. Truly wonderful.” he said with some serious contempt in his voice.

‘You stay out of my way unless I say otherwise, you understand?’ Miles mindlinks me, as he moves toward his car.

“Are you not going to speak to him Bai?” Mum tries. “He will be Alpha this time next year, you know?”

“Oh it doesn’t matter, Aunt Brianna. Bailey will be excused this time. I am sure she is tired from her drive back home. But no doubt I will be seeing her around. And yes, she will have to get used to me as her senior. Her Alpha.” He says with a sneer, and at his words my stomach twists into knots. I don’t think I can stay here… I not only need to find work, I need to find work away from my pack, so I can move away to get away from my psychotic Alpha and ex-mate!

# Chapter 4 Bailey

I sit out in the garden drinking my morning coffee, with my laptop open scrolling desperately through the job vacancies, when I hear a deep growl to my left, causing me to swirl my head to look. Miles was resting his head on the garden fence from next door, overlooking our back garden, to where I was sitting. Watching me intently, the look upon his face was one of sheer disgust...

I had no clue how long he had been standing there, or what had angered him to the point of growling, but he had made me jump. “Fucking hell, Miles.” I snapped, giving him a dark scowl. I had done well the past week since arriving and stayed out of his way. Managing to ensure I avoided all pack events, and ensuring I dodged any places he was likely to be. Yes, it meant I spent an awful lot of time in my bedroom at home, but I would rather do that than have to deal with him.

Today, the sun was glorious, and I thought it would be nice to take my breakfast outside while I looked for jobs online. Sitting on the patio furniture we have in the back garden, under the warmth of the morning sunshine, my coffee was enjoyable, all until this stupid fucker disturbed me. I shook my head in his direction, wondering why he had snuck up on me. He had so many more places he could be...

“Who do you think you are cursing at?” Miles snarled.

“The creep who did exactly that. Crept up on me out of the blue for no good reason.” I rolled my eyes at him in disgust, only to see this seemed to anger him further. Though, I think anything I did would anger Miles. He seemed to hold some serious resentment towards me at the moment, but should I really expect anything less?

“I will come over there and deal with you, Bailey.” He hissed.

“Deal with me?” I questioned his choice of words. “Deal with me how? You asked me to stay out of your way. That is what I am doing.”

“What are you doing?” he chose to ignore my words, and looks to my laptop screen instead, so I slowly shut the screen down, so he would be unable to see. I do not want him knowing I am applying for work outside the area. I would not put it past him to stop it from happening. He seems to be being deliberately nasty of late, so I truly do not know what he would sink to, in order to be nasty towards me…

“Nothing of your concern.”

“I am your Alpha. So, all that goes on in my pack is my business.” He tells me with a smirk.

I shook my head with a smirk back, “Hmm, not quite Miles, you are not. Your Dad is still Alpha, so don’t be getting ahead of yourself.”

An angry look flared across his face once more. His handsome features contorted in fury. He did not like having people disagree with him. But I was not about to have him dictating to me...

“Just because you were my mate once upon a time does not give you the right to talk to me however you please, you know.” Miles snarls.

“She is your mate?” a voice questions, causing us both to whip our heads round, only to see the unexpected face of Miles’s younger brother Ellis.

I look at Miles with despair now, my heart pounding within my chest and my palms becoming sweaty. Wondering what the hell he planned to do now the secret we had kept between us for so long was out now… how had neither of us heard him coming?

“No she is not. She rejected me.” Miles said coldly, looking at me as if daring me to disagree with him.

Wait... he was making it out like I had rejected him? I looked at Miles in shock, but the look within his eyes was like he dared me to argue.

“You rejected your Alpha? What kind of fool are you?” Ellis asked as his eyes looked me up and down like a piece of dirt. Sadly, a look I am more than used to. “Do Mum and Dad know?”

Miles shakes his head. “No. I don’t want them to either. It would worry them too much, Els, please do not say anything. Bailey and I were never a good match, so perhaps she made the right choice. Please for me?” Miles is pleading with his brother, and part of me wonders if he is worried what his family would do if they learned of his decision to go against the Moon Goddess. As an Alpha, this was almost unheard of. Blaming me was gutless. But, if that is what he wants to do, then let him.

‘Do not even think of saying anything different.’ Miles’s voice reverberates through my mind via the link. ‘Or you will learn to regret it. That degree you love so much could easily be destroyed.’

I took in the words Miles had said, and the sad thing is, I do not doubt them. I would not put it past him finding a way to have my degree removed. Having me stuck within our pack. He would be Alpha soon enough, and he would be the one able to dictate what I did... I had little choice but to do as he asked. Yet i felt anger racing through my veins...

I lifted my laptop and stood from my seat. “I will talk to you however I like Miles. When you seem to think you can treat me however you like.” and with that I walked away from the two brothers, both looking at me, walking away in shock. I know I would come to regret what I had just said, but I truly no longer cared…

# Chapter 5 Asher

I pace the corridor of the packhouse for yet another night. Sleepless nights are becoming the most repetitive thing for me now. Almost tiresome… or they would be if I could actually fucking sleep! Nightmares plaguing my dreams were the thing stopping my sleep… making me fear sleep… visions of that night… reoccurring time and time again… the rogues invading our pack lands… us losing control… and them hurting my precious Isla. My beautiful Isla.

Fate had barely brought us together before snatching us apart… life could be cruel… and it made me relive that night, time and time again through my dreams… the pain as her life ebbed away… the inability to be able to save her… the pain in her eyes… the fear… it made me hate life… hate fate. And now, now it makes me fear sleep. Which is what found me pacing these godforsaken corridors every night…

“Alright Beta!” Marc, one of our young warriors, greeted me enthusiastically, telling me he had likely been out spending time with friends. Especially returning to his room at this early hour of the morning.

“Hey Marc.” I smiled, raising my eyebrows questioningly at him as he stumbled toward the stairs. He was barely able to walk in a straight line.

“I not been dinking, honest boss.” He mutters with a chuckle. These guys make me smile. How could they not? Barely past shifting age, and newly trained warriors. They clearly decided to drink themselves to the point of stupor. Which, considering we are werewolves and alcohol has little to no effect on us in small doses, they had to have been drinking excessive amounts! Likely coming up with new and different drinking challenges to see who could drink the most, that was what they so often did.

But, I can’t say I had not done the same when I first shifted and on many a younger night with friends. It was all part of growing up for many, wasn’t it? Especially for our warriors, I knew that, having helped many a drunken warrior home in the past. And I am sure they had had a good night and many good memories to look back on… if they could actually remember any of them, of course!",1,1749712556.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False
1l9g50i,https://i.redd.it/sgpsb8rj5g6f1.jpeg,Hi from Hanna & Martin – and a quick heads-up for KaffeBox subscribers,"Hi everyone - we’re Hanna and Martin, two coffee enthusiasts with a background in tech (Apple and Shopify are in our past lives). We’re excited to now be part of the KaffeBox community too.

We built [Roastguide](https://roast.guide/), a free, community-driven app for tracking, reviewing, and exploring specialty coffee. Think of it as a personal coffee log meets collective guidebook (or like Untappd/Vivino, but for coffee). After years of wishing there were a better way to keep track of what we’d brewed, learn from others, and discover new roasters, we finally decided to build it ourselves.

And, for anyone subscribed to KaffeBox: **your monthly roasts are now in the app**! That means you can open your bags, log your brews, and review your favorites - all in one place :)

We’re looking forward to being part of the conversations here, and always open to feedback or ideas if you give the app a try.",5,1749712514.0,KaffeBox,1,1.0,False

You ever feel like life is just one big treadmill? You’re running and running but going nowhere? 🙄 I was there, too. Between work, social commitments, and trying to have a life, I found myself drowning in the grind. That’s when I stumbled upon something that changed everything: *reverse scheduling*. And no, it’s not as complicated as it sounds!

So, let me share how I flipped my week upside down and magically reclaimed *20 hours* of my life. Yes, you read that right – 20 hours! 💥

### What is Reverse Scheduling?

Simply put, it’s starting with the end in mind. Instead of planning your day from when you wake up, you plan from when you want to go to bed (or however long you want to work). It’s a bit like putting together a jigsaw puzzle but starting with the edges!

### Here’s how I did it:

1. **Identify your non-negotiables**  
   - Work hours? Check.  
   - Gym sessions? Check.  
   - Family time? Double check!  
   List out everything that’s essential for you. This is your foundation.

2. **Decide your magic number**  
   How many hours do you actually *want* to work? For me, it was 30 hours max. I mean, who needs to work 40+ hours to be successful? Not me!

3. **Create your ideal end-of-day**  
   If I want to wrap things up by 5 PM, an easy way to view it is backward. If I have a project due Friday, what needs to happen this week to make that work? Spoiler alert: a lot can get done in shorter chunks!

4. **Chunk your time**  
   I started dividing my work into focused sprints. Say goodbye to marathon 5-hour work sessions! Instead, I do 90-minute chunks followed by a break. Perfect for those coffee refills and TikTok scrolls. 😂

5. **Review and adjust**  
   Every Sunday, I took a look at what worked and what definitely did not (hello, procrastination). Adjust based on what you learn. Trust me; it’s all part of the journey.

### What I Gained Back

- **Less Stress**: No more scramble to finish tasks at the last second.
  
- **More Free Time**: Like, *real* time. I picked up hobbies I thought I’d lost forever—hello, painting! 🎨

- **Better Work Quality**: Funny how focused time means better productivity and creativity, right?

### But…

It’s not just about the hours. It’s about reclaiming *your* life. Because let’s be honest, time is the one thing we can’t get back. 💔 

Have you ever tried reverse scheduling? What’s the craziest way you’ve found to reclaim time? Let’s spark some ideas and see what works for everyone! Remember, we're in this together. ✊✨",1,1749712456.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
1l9g4d5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1l9g4d5/how_to_readirresistible_boss_succumbing_to_your/,"How to read""Irresistible Boss: Succumbing to Your Touch Novel""- I got home after a long day, and my parents were waiting for me in the living room.","I got home after a long day, and my parents were waiting for me in the living room.

""Catherine, sit down. We need to talk,"" my father said, looking quite agitated.

""What's going on, Dad?"" I asked tiredly. I had worked all day, gone to college at night, and upon getting home, all I wanted was to take a shower and crash into bed. But that wasn't possible.

""Catherine, your cousin's wedding invitation has arrived,"" my mother said.

""That little tramp is not my cousin!"" I snapped, already getting angry.

""Catherine, she is your cousin,"" my mother insisted. ""You need to stop this childish behavior. Melissa already hit her and caused a scene here at home. Enough! She's my sister's daughter, which makes her your cousin.""

""I'm sorry, Mom, but she means nothing to me,"" I tried to stay calm. ""She slept with my boyfriend in my bed. That's not something she should do.""

I had been dating Claude for four years; he was my first boyfriend, and I found him in my bed, in my room, sleeping with Kelly, my cousin! I was in shock. Of course, Melissa, my best friend, went after them. Since then, things had been tensed at home because my parents insisted it was silly and that I should act as if nothing had happened and go back to being around my cousin.

""He was wrong, Catherine, since he was your boyfriend,"" my mother argued. ""Kelly, poor thing, was seduced. He dishonored her, now he's marrying her so she won't be talked about badly in town.""

""Oh, Mom! Spare me! The whole town knows Kelly is a shameless woman..."" I lost my patience.

""Catherine, watch your language!"" my father scolded me. ""Look, if you don't want to be around Kelly, fine, but you're going to this wedding. And enough with this rude behavior.""

""I'm what?"" I thought I had heard wrong.

""You're going to your cousin's wedding, Catherine. That's an order! We're your parents, and you'll obey,"" my mother spoke angrily at me as if I were the one in the wrong.

""I'm sorry, Mom, but I won't! I follow your rules, I'm a good daughter, but this time I can't. I was the one who was wronged! I have every right not to want to be the family joke anymore,"" I said, already crying.

""ENOUGH, CATHERINE!"" my father shouted, startling me. ""You're going to this wedding, and that's final.""

""But, Dad...""

""I don't want to hear it, Catherine! It's important to your mother to keep peace in the family. So you're going, period,"" my father said, leaving no room for argument.

I spent the night crying in my room. The next day, I told Melissa everything. She wasted no time and arranged invitations to a masquerade ball, a gala event. She told my parents it would be crucial for my career since the city's most important businesspeople would be there. I could make valuable connections, and our professors had promised to introduce us to various entrepreneurs who could open doors for our professional future.

At first, my parents weren't entirely convinced, but Melissa's parents talked to them and persuaded them that it would be an excellent opportunity for my future. So they agreed that I should take advantage of it.

""Catherine, you can't say no to me! I've already bought the tickets and masks, and I even convinced your parents that this is a super important event for your professional future, which was such hard work. This party is going to be incredible, and you're not going to miss it!"" Melissa looked at me with puppy dog eyes, clasping her hands together as if begging.

I was sitting at my desk at work in the middle of a Thursday afternoon, between taking messages and making calls, when Mel showed up with coffee, chocolate muffins, and this persistence about getting me to agree to go to the masquerade ball, which was the biggest annual event in our city.

""Oh, Mel, how is it that I can never say no to you? Alright, I'll go!""

I agreed to go to the ball, but I still wasn't sure. Either way, I was going to sleep at Mel's house to avoid the wedding, but I wasn't planning on going to the party. However, Melissa kept pushing until she convinced me to go. On Saturday, we got ready at her place.

""Wow, girl! You look absolutely stunning!"" She handed me a beautiful golden mask, intricately designed like lace that covered up to my nose, and I put it on. I was wearing a shimmering red satin dress, and the mask matched perfectly. ""So, are we ready?""

""Yes, we're ready,"" I replied and grabbed my purse. ""Oh, I forgot my perfume.""

""No problem, you can use my mom's new perfume. She won't mind.""

When Fred, Mel's boyfriend, saw us, he smiled, gave Mel a kiss, and said:

""Girls, you look gorgeous! I think you'll leave this party with a new boyfriend, Cat.""

""No boyfriend, Fred. Actually, I think I'd better stay, I'm not in the party mood. Please, Mel, let me stay?""

Chapter 2

There was no way out - my friend dragged me to the ball. As soon as we got in, Mel pulled us to the bar and whispered in my ear:

""It's an open bar tonight, so you're going to drink until all that sadness washes away!"" Mel handed me two tequila shots while holding two more in her hands. ""Let's down these!"" We knocked back the tequila, and Fred was already handing each of us a cosmopolitan.

Melissa dragged me to the dance floor, and I was actually having fun. When a slow song started playing, Fred and Mel began slow dancing together. I took that as my cue to head to the buffet, but I didn't make it there. I felt someone grab my hand, and when I turned around, there was a man in a black mask smiling at me - and what a smile! He kissed my hand and pulled me close, whispering in my ear with a husky voice:

""Surely the most beautiful woman in the room won't deny me a dance, will she?""

""And why not? Let's dance,"" I smiled back at him.

It was impossible to resist that seductive husky voice and that gorgeous crooked smile! He was tall with broad shoulders, had a charming smile and blue eyes - so blue they were almost violet. He had sinfully tempting lips, brown hair, and when he pulled me by the waist, I placed my hands on his chest and could feel he was a wall of well-defined muscle. Although the mask concealed his face, he was very charming and enchanting.

""I've been watching you since you arrived,"" this mysterious man whispered in my ear. ""You're so beautiful!""

""You're kind. But you're not from around here, are you?"" He had a powerful presence, radiating authority.

""No. A friend convinced me to come to this party.""

""Looks like we have something in common - my friends convinced me to come too.""

""Lucky me!""

""And why's that?"" I smiled.

""Because I was captivated the moment I saw you. You're stunning."" As he whispered in my ear, I got goosebumps, feeling my face flush and my body tingle - he truly had me enchanted.

""Even with the mask?""

""Even with the mask! You're too beautiful.""

""You're such a charmer.""

""You think I'm charming?""

""You know you are. And handsome too.""

""I'm glad you like what you see.""

""And what do you do for a living, handsome?"" - I felt a bit dizzy, not sure if it was from the drink or the delicious cologne that man was wearing. I ended up stumbling over my own feet.

""Are you okay?""

""I think I need some air.""

""Come with me."" - He pulled me into a dark hallway that led to an emergency exit and started fanning my face. - ""I really want to kiss you. May I?"" - I nodded yes.

He looked into my eyes, held the back of my neck, and our lips met. It started slow but deepened; he pressed me against the wall, and the kiss intensified even more, almost taking our breath away. When he broke the kiss so we could breathe, we looked into each other's eyes - it was like throwing gasoline on fire. He ran his hand down my waist to my leg and pulled my leg up to his waist. I was completely surrendered by then, feeling his body against mine. I went crazy with desire and pulled him closer, wrapping my leg around his waist.

""You're a great kisser!"" - I smiled at him and felt my whole body tingle.

""Oh, beautiful, you're incredible. I want you so badly, here, right now!"" - he said between kisses and slipped his hand under my dress, pulling it up and reaching my underwear. I was on fire when he put his hand inside my underwear and yelled. - ""Oh! So delicious! So hot, so wet!"" - He said and kissed me harder while unzipping his pants. With a quick movement, like someone who had done this before, he tore my underwear and caressed my entrance, as if asking for permission. He looked into my eyes again and asked: ""What do you want me to do?""

""I want you inside me now!"" I responded shamelessly, already panting with desire. I couldn't resist those eyes and that husky voice. I'd never been like this before - normally, I would have pulled away the moment he grabbed my hand, but tonight I had promised myself to have fun and live in the moment if someone interesting came along. And that's exactly what I was doing, living in the moment.

Hearing me, he entered me slowly, watching as I leaned my head against the wall and savored every inch of him - and he was huge. He took the opportunity to scatter kisses along my neck. When he was fully inside, he paused and whispered between kisses in my ear: ""Now I'm going to move."" He pulled out only to thrust back in with full force this time, and it was incredible. I was completely lost and driven wild by his movements as he moved in and out of me frantically.

We lost control and gave ourselves over completely, as if nothing else existed around us. I felt a haze in my eyes as my climax began to build, and I moaned softly in his ear. At that moment, he seemed to go crazy, lifting my other leg to his waist as I wrapped them around him. Kissing me intensely, he thrust even harder into me - it was heaven on earth. I came again, even more intensely than before, leaving me breathless. As I was coming, he whispered that he was close to his limit feeling me pulse around him, and soon I felt his hot release inside me.

We stayed there against that wall, completely breathless, his forehead resting against mine. While kissing me, he slowly withdrew, and I was thoroughly satisfied - as Melissa would say. I smiled and he looked at me, gave me a soft kiss and said:

""You're truly amazing!""

He gently lowered my legs until my feet touched the ground, fixed my dress, adjusted his pants, and hugged me. It was so intimate, so affectionate - despite the wildness of our encounter and the intensity with which we'd given in to each other, he was still gentle with me. I'd never had such an incredible experience, but I'd only ever been with my ex until now. And my ex had never cared about hugging me afterward, or worried about my pleasure - for him, it was just about getting in and out until he was satisfied. So having a man care about me, about my pleasure, take care of me - it was new, and amazingly so. He kissed my neck and whispered in my ear:

""So, beautiful, I still don't know your name."" It took me seconds to process and finally realize that I'd just slept with a complete stranger whose name I didn't even know.

Just as I was about to speak, he pulled his phone from his pocket and asked for a minute to answer it. He stepped away slightly and I could only hear him raising his voice saying:

""What did you say?"" At that moment, the stranger ran off as if he'd forgotten about me, or as if he was just running away from the woman he'd quickly hooked up with at the party.

Of course, Catherine, you're an idiot! But so what? I was just having fun too, and I didn't even know who the guy was, and he didn't know who I was. All good. I pulled myself together, looked in vain for my underwear - no idea where he'd thrown it - and left that hallway.

I went back to the table and found Mel and Fred making out. They soon stopped and focused on me:

""Mel, I think I found the Big Bad Wolf!"" I laughed, and she laughed with me.

""When we get home, I want to know everything!""

""Of course you do!"" I replied with sparkling eyes.

""Prince, I think we can go now. What do you think, Cat?""

""I'm ready whenever you are!"" I said, downing a glass of water.

""Let's go then, girls!"" Fred said and led us to the exit.

We'd barely gotten home when Mel started demanding:

""Tell me everything - who is he, how it went, how it didn't go, everything.""

I laughed and told her everything. When I finished speaking, my friend was staring at me open-mouthed and asked:

""You guys used protection, right?""

My heart started racing! We hadn't used protection. I shook my head no at her; I was in shock realizing how careless I'd been. She immediately tried to calm me down:

""No, Cat, calm down. I'm sure nothing will come of it. But you should get some tests done to make sure everything's okay. I'm going to the kitchen to make us some tea. Don't freak out!""

Chapter 3

On Monday during lunch, I met Mel. She handed me a small bag from a fancy store, and I looked at her, confused.

""My mom asked me to give this to you. She said it's perfect for you and doesn't suit her,"" Mel said with a big smile.

I opened the bag, and inside was the perfume I had worn to the ball. A huge smile spread across my face. I loved that perfume, and it was part of the best night of my life. I just hoped that my best night hadn't left me with an STD as a souvenir. With that thought, I thanked Mel and told her I'd call her mom later, then mentioned I wanted to call the lab to schedule some tests.

I called the laboratory and was informed that I needed a doctor's prescription to get the tests covered by health insurance. Thank God the company provided health insurance for employees because otherwise, I wouldn't know what to do. My salary wasn't high, and what little was left after covering college expenses went to helping at home, since my mom didn't work outside the house and my dad didn't make much as a driver.

So I made a doctor's appointment, but the earliest available slot was two weeks away, and I waited anxiously. The more days passed, the more nervous I became, though Mel did everything to calm me down. On the scheduled date, she went to the doctor's with me. With the list of tests in hand, she personally scheduled the lab work and insisted on accompanying me. Three weeks had passed since the party when I finally got the tests done. The results came back five days later, and I returned to the doctor. Of course, Mel was with me.

The doctor checked the results and looked me in the eyes:

""Miss Catherine, your health is excellent. You're healthy. But from now on, you'll need to take better care of yourself.""

I breathed a sigh of relief, but was I really about to get lectured by the doctor for having unprotected bedlife with a stranger? Well, I deserved it - not using protection was silly, I could have caught a disease. And then he continued:

""Congratulations, you're conceived! I'm going to refer you to an OB-GYN for prenatal care...""

I didn't hear anything else, just the blood pulsing in my ears. I couldn't believe this! conceived? How would I explain this? It's not possible. Me, of all people, the perfect goody-two-shoes who never stepped out of line, who always considered the consequences before doing anything, who was always responsible - the first time I let rationality slide, I ended up conceived and didn't even know who the father was! Mel held my hand and kept repeating:

""Calm down, Cat, everything will be okay!""

How could everything be okay? I didn't even know who the father was. I would have to tell my parents, their only daughter would break their hearts. They would be disappointed, hate me, and kick me out of the house. How could I explain that I don't even know what the father of my child looks like? I was already hyperventilating. Suddenly, I felt the doctor taking my hand and speaking calmly:

""Easy now, dear! The situation, from what I can see, isn't ideal, but you can't get this nervous, it will harm your baby. Now you have to take care of yourself for the baby's sake. I'm sure the people who love you will support and help you. But you need to calm down because only you can ensure this baby develops healthily and is born strong. Do you understand me?""

I looked at that short, white-haired, slightly chubby gentleman, with his glasses perched on the tip of his nose, and nodded positively. Somehow he calmed me down a bit, maybe because his eyes sparkled with a kindness and understanding that we rarely see these days. The doctor asked his secretary to bring me some chamomile tea, and while I drank it and tried to calm down, he gave all the information to Melissa, who listened attentively.

We left the office and Melissa took me to a diner, saying we needed to eat something. As soon as I sat down, I felt the tears falling. My friend hugged me and told me once again that I wasn't alone. I looked at her and said:

""The only thing I'm sure of right now is that I want you and Fred to be my child's godparents because I know you'll support them and give them lots of love.""

Her eyes sparkled, and she burst into tears, responding between sobs:

""I'll be the best godmother in the world and I'll always be close to our baby! And I'm sure Fred will be very happy too!""

She assured me she would always be by my side, made it clear that I wouldn't go through anything alone, and that she would be with me when I talked to my parents. My parents... oh! I started thinking and decided I wouldn't hide it from them for even a day; I would tell them that very night. I wouldn't go to college, I would go home to talk to them. Mel immediately supported me and said:

""Let's go then, I'm with you!""

When we arrived at my house, my parents were startled, and my mom came right over, worried:

""Girls, didn't you go to class today? Is everything okay?""

""Not really, Mom. I need to talk to you both.""

My parents immediately realized it was something very serious. We all sat in the living room and I told them what was happening, admitting I had been irresponsible by hooking up with a stranger at the party. I obviously didn't go into details, but I made it clear that I couldn't find my child's father again. The disappointment in their eyes was evident. My mother was sobbing uncontrollably, saying I was ruined. My father hadn't said anything yet. Seeing how upset my mother was, Melissa quickly went to the kitchen and came back with a glass of sugar water for her. Melissa always gives sugar water to nervous people, saying it calms them down - I never understood that.

Finally, my father spoke:

""You made a huge mistake and there's no going back.""

My parents were very simple people. My father was a tall, strong man, and my mother was an older version of me, but both had great character and solid principles they always made sure to pass on to me. Hearing my father emphasize that I had messed up made my heart ache even more. I started crying and said:

""I know, Dad, I was irresponsible. But there's nothing I can do now. I'll drop out of college to raise my child. And I'm going to pack my bags...""

""Pack your bags? You're very mistaken if you think you're leaving this house like that. You made a mistake, and you disappointed us, but we love you, we'll get through this and we'll help you. You're not alone, my daughter! And neither is this child!"" My father said this and my heart filled with hope.

""But Dad, I brought shame to you...""

""You're not the first and won't be the last single mother in this world. We would have liked things to be different for you, not so difficult. You've always been so responsible! But if this is how it is, we'll face it together. You won't leave college - more than ever, you need to grow in life to take care of your child. You're going to be a single mother, your responsibility is huge. We'll help you, and even though it will be difficult, everything will work out.""

Melissa was already crying and quickly spoke to my parents:

""Mr. Anthony, Mrs. Selina, you can count on me, I'll help with everything! Besides, I'm this baby's godmother, Cat is like a sister to me, and I'll always be around.""

My parents looked at her gratefully. I looked at those three feeling completely blessed to have them in my life, full of love for them and experiencing a totally new feeling for that little being still growing inside me, whose existence I had just discovered!

As difficult as being a single mother would be, that night at the ball was the best night of my life. I could never forget those violet-blue eyes looking at me with adoration during our furtive encounter and everything my body experienced that night. I would always have that sweet memory with me.

The following months were difficult. I kept the dress, shoes, mask, and perfume that Mel's mother gave me in a box. On difficult days, I would open that box and relive that night in my memory.

Although I had a peaceful pregnancy, people's comments and cruelty were hard to bear. To make matters worse, after they got married, my ex and my cousin moved in with her parents, who lived on the same street as us. They made sure to humiliate me with nasty comments whenever they saw me and spread throughout the neighborhood that I didn't know who my child's father was and that I was a loose woman, which was why Claude had left me. I wanted to end them! Kelly's mother, who was my mother's sister, never missed a chance to come to our house and torment us, saying how fortunate it was that her daughter wasn't like me, that she was a good girl who had married a decent man. She seemed to have forgotten that she had stolen my boyfriend and slept with him in my bed.

But I swallowed it all; it wasn't worth arguing with these people, and I didn't want to transmit negative feelings to my child. As the days went by, I loved that baby more and more. I had no idea such love could exist. Everything I did, I did for him. I would protect him from everything; I would give my life to him. And surprisingly, during the whole time of carrying with a baby, everything seemed to flow in my favor, things were falling into place and working out.

My boss was great, understood my situation, and even gave me a small raise, which was a huge help! Mel and Fred showered me with attention, they were in love with their godchild even before knowing if it would be a girl or boy. They insisted on buying everything for the nursery, which turned out beautiful. Mel accompanied me to all appointments and every test, never missing anything. She even organized two baby showers - one at the company and another at college. My child would come into the world surrounded by love.

I found out I was having a boy and decided to name him Peter. And so it was. Peter was born healthy, with a pair of huge violet-blue eyes that would never let me forget the night that changed my life, but was also the best night I'd ever had! I would never forget that man!

My son was surrounded by love from the first moment. My parents were enchanted by their grandson. Mel and Fred came to our house every day to see their godson and check how we were doing. Mel was always there supporting me in everything. Her parents also came to visit Peter and said they would be honorary grandparents since they considered me their daughter too, which I found beautiful. They also surrounded me with care. They insisted on giving the stroller as a gift, and the day Peter was born, they came to the maternity ward with a huge basket of flowers and welcome balloons.

After my maternity leave ended, my son stayed in my mother's care while I was at work and college. I worked hard and devoted all my time not spent at college or work to my son. With the help of my parents and my son's godparents, I managed everything and didn't miss any semester in college, graduating alongside my friend Melissa. It was a great moment for me and my family. With my diploma in hand, I would now pursue a better future, with the firm purpose that my son would never lack anything.

Chapter 4

When I graduated, Peter was already two years old. By then, he was walking everywhere, always clinging to grandma - which was his first word. He was a beautiful boy with straight black hair, fair skin, a cute little upturned nose, and those huge violet eyes that made me sigh. He was my sunshine! And now I would have more time for him.

After graduation, my boss called me in for a chat. He was an excellent boss and said he was very happy with my work at the company, but he knew I deserved to go far, so I should look for a job in my field, and he would understand. He assured me that my job at the construction company would be mine for as long as I wanted, and if I left and things didn't work out, I would always have a place to come back to. However, he advised that I should seek something in my field of study to provide a better future for my son. I was very touched by this and accepted his good advice.

I told Melissa, and she immediately said she would talk to her father about reaching out to some contacts. It didn't take long before Mr. Oliver Larson, Mel's father, called me to his office and handed me a card, saying:

""Catherine, I know you're an excellent girl and a good professional. I spoke with a friend, and he arranged an interview for you at Miller Group. It's for the position of CEO's assistant. If you get this job, you'll be working in your field at a global company. It's an excellent position, but it's not here in Bellwood. You would have to move to Paradise Port. I know it's a huge step, but I think you should consider it - it will be excellent for you. Anyway, send an email to the address on the card with your response, either declining the position or accepting the virtual interview.""

""Mr. Larson, I don't have words to thank you! You've always been so good to me! Miller Group is one of the largest business conglomerates in the country! Working there is a dream! I'll definitely accept the interview, and if I have to move, I will. I know it will be a great opportunity,"" I said with conviction. It wouldn't be bad to get away from those nasty family members, especially now that ""queen"" Kelly was conceived and her mother decided to ask for all of Peter's things for the child of that dishonest couple! Thankfully, my mom told her that was absurd, but it wouldn't matter anyway since I had already given everything Peter had outgrown to an acquaintance who was conceived. My mom had been very upset with her sister, as she was always dismissing my son, always referring to him as the fatherless boy, which really hurt my mom. Leaving this city, I'll only regret leaving my parents and friends behind, but I know they'll support me once again.

I thanked Mr. Larson and left the office. When I got to my desk, I spoke with my boss, another Mr. Larson, but since he didn't like being called that, I addressed him by his first name:

""Aldo, your brother got me an interview at Miller Group.""

He smiled:

""I know, he just called me. I think you should grab this opportunity. If it doesn't work out, you can always come back.""

I smiled at him and immediately sent an email to schedule the interview. I quickly received confirmation that the interview would be the next day at ten in the morning, and since I had already taken the initiative to send my resume, the interview would be brief.

That night at home, I talked to my parents, who understood, even though they were worried about how I would manage to raise a child alone in another city and got teary-eyed about being far from their grandson. They supported me as always and were happy about the opportunity I received. I asked them not to tell anyone. When Mel arrived - she came every day to see her godson - I told her everything, and she helped me prepare for the next day.

At the time of the interview, I went to the meeting room at my workplace; my boss had given me permission. I sat down and waited for the call. I was interviewed by a very kind and intelligent woman, Mrs. Mariana Taylor. It was very pleasant; we talked for two hours. She gave me all the information about the position, salary, and benefits. At the end, she said:

""Catherine, you're hired! You'll be replacing me since I'm taking a director position at the London branch, so you'll be taking over my position here. I'd like you to start as soon as possible because I'm leaving in ten days and would like to hand everything over to you before I go. And I'd rather not reschedule my departure. When can you start?""

""I just need my boss to release me, but I think I can be there on Monday."" - it was already Friday, would Aldo agree to release me today?

""Perfect. You can send me an email confirmation after you talk to him. Do you have any questions?""

""No, ma'am. Everything is clear.""

""Great! Welcome to Miller Group. I'm sure you'll do very well. I'll see you on Monday.""

She ended the call, and my heart was racing - I had done it. The job was great, the salary even better, and I would have chances to progress. It was a dream. But now it was time to rush and sort everything out.

I immediately went to talk to my boss. He was happy about it, called accounting, and had them process my settlement right away. After that, he let me go, saying I would always have a place to come back if needed, but he knew I would do very well. I thanked him for everything and left. I sent the confirmation email to Mrs. Taylor, saying I would be at the company at eight on Monday morning, and went straight to talk to Mel and her father - I had to thank them. And that's when Mel surprised me:

""Did you think you were going to take my godson away just like that? No way! My father got me an interview at Lynx World in Paradise Port. I'm moving with you, and we'll live together. What do you think?""

This was perfect! I was overjoyed, but quickly asked:

""Mel, what about Fred?""

""Fred has already requested a transfer to the Paradise Port branch at his company; he'll have better opportunities there too. He's coming in fifteen days. Friend, it's a new life for all three of us.""

I was so happy. Mel had orchestrated everything. Fred would drive us there, and she would take care of Peter while I worked until we found a daycare. She already had three daycares to visit, and her father had already made available a furnished apartment in the city for us. It was too good to be true; I was even scared. Noticing this, Mel nudged me and said:

""Learn to accept the good things life offers you!""

I smiled at her, and we went to my parents' house. It was time to break the news and say goodbye. Paradise Port is on the other side of the country, so we wouldn't see each other for a while. My parents were happy until I said I would leave the next morning - then the farewell became sad. It was hard to leave them behind, but it was necessary. With the salary I would receive, I could help them now. That was good.

The next morning, Fred and Mel arrived right on time. Mel's father had given her a pickup truck as a gift, which made moving our stuff much easier. Fred loaded everything into the truck, and off we went - it would be a full day on the road.

We arrived in Paradise Port late Saturday night. Peter was exhausted but had enjoyed himself immensely during the trip - everything was new and exciting to him. We got settled in, ordered some food, and after eating, went to bed. On Sunday, we explored the city to get our bearings. Paradise Port was a huge, modern industrial city on the coast. Its port attracted lots of business, making it a first-world urban center.

The apartment where we would be living was close to one of the daycares Mel had contacted, which was great. It wasn't far from the company either - I could get there in twenty minutes by subway. The apartment was beautiful, with a modern design, great ventilation, and huge windows that let in plenty of natural light. That evening, we dropped Fred off at the airport and headed home to rest. The next day would be a big one - I would be starting my new job, while Mel had her virtual interview and would schedule a meeting with the director of the daycare near our apartment to visit and talk.

I tucked my son into bed; he was worn out from all the fun he'd had today. As I watched him sleeping peacefully, I felt confident that we would have a really good life here. Peter now had his own room, and Mel and I had planned to buy some things to make it feel more personal and give it our own touch. I grabbed the baby monitor and went to my room. I opened one of my boxes and started organizing everything. When I opened the last box, I took out the box containing my memories from the ball night. I opened it, ran my hand over that beautiful dress, and sighed once again. I picked up the perfume and thought, ""Why not?"" Starting tomorrow, I would wear this perfume every day - my salary was good, and when this bottle ran out, I could buy another. I put the box away, left the perfume on the dresser, and went to bed full of expectations for this new life that was opening up before me.

Chapter 5

I showed up at the company at 8:00 a.m. Mrs. Taylor gave me a warm welcome and introduced me to everyone, and they were all very kind. The boss wasn't there - he was traveling and would return at the end of the week. The office was beautiful, very modern, decorated in white with stainless steel and green accents, managing to be both professional and welcoming. It was elegant, and I really liked it. I was particularly glad I had chosen to wear a black suit with a dark green silk blouse underneath and black heels. I would need to dress elegantly every day now, after all, I would be working directly with the company president.

Mid-morning, I received a message from Mel saying she had managed to schedule an appointment with the director of the daycare near our apartment during lunch hour. I explained the situation to Mrs. Taylor and asked if it would be possible to leave during that time, assuring her I would be back on schedule.

""So you have a child. How old is he?"" she asked with a smile.

""He's two years old. He's a very clever little boy. He wasn't planned, but he's the reason for my life!""

""What's his name?""

""Peter.""

""Peter. A strong name. You're not married, I know that, but what about your son's father, are you still together?"" My heart sank - how could I explain to her that I didn't know who the father was? But I don't lie, so let's face the truth. I told her that Peter's father was someone I met at a party and never saw again. She looked at me seriously, but there was no judgment in her eyes. Then she said:

""You have my respect, Catherine. It's not easy being a single mother, and it's very difficult to tell truths like this when you know they might trigger others' judgment. Thank you for your trust and honesty. Go take care of the daycare arrangements for your son, we'll continue this afternoon - no need to rush.""

I thanked her and said goodbye, heading off to meet Mel and Peter. My admiration and respect for Mrs. Taylor only grew. She's a woman in her mid-fifties, with very light blonde hair and almost transparent blue eyes. She's a beautiful and elegant woman, but most importantly, she's very welcoming. We got along very well. During the rest of the morning, she filled me in with information about the work, and I took notes on everything. At lunchtime, I left the building, and Mel was already waiting at the door with Peter. I got in the car, and we went to lunch before heading to the daycare.

Mel and I loved the daycare, and Peter was already fitting in, running around with his new little friends - he's such an outgoing boy. That made me so happy! My son was happy! We decided not to look at other daycares since this one was excellent and very close to home, just three blocks away. We completed the enrollment and sorted out all the details. The director suggested we let Peter stay until the end of the day since he was having fun and could start adapting. Mel agreed to pick him up at the end of the day.

Mel dropped me back at the company and told me she'd head home to prepare for her job interview later in the afternoon. I returned to my office, arriving before Mrs. Taylor. I sat at the desk and started reviewing everything she had already told me. The phone on the desk rang, and I wasn't sure what to do, but since this would be my desk, I answered in my most professional voice:

""Miller Group, Executive Office, good afternoon, how may I help you?""

I heard a deathly silence on the other end followed by a long sigh. Someone spoke up with obvious impatience, in a strong and slightly hoarse voice:

""Put Mariana on.""

I was startled but kept my composure and replied:

""I'm sorry, sir, but Mrs. Taylor hasn't returned from lunch yet. May I help you, or would you like to leave a message?""

""Who is this speaking,"" he asked, even more impatiently.

""My name is Catherine, I'm Mr. Miller's new executive assistant.""

""But I don't know you,"" he seemed to grow more impatient with each word.

""It's my first day here, sir. Would you like to leave a message?""

""Tell Mariana to call me as soon as she sets foot in the office.""

""Certainly, sir. And your name is?""

""Looks like I'm your boss!"" He snapped and hung up.

Wow, what a stressed-out man! This wasn't in the job description. My throat immediately tightened. Had I already made a bad impression on my boss? I was so screwed! I started thinking I wouldn't last long in this job. Shortly after, Mrs. Taylor arrived and I passed on the message with a worried look on my face. She looked at me with a smile, as if understanding my concern, and asked:

""Was he calm?""

I looked at her and couldn't help myself:

""He was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I'm pretty sure I could see his jugular vein popping out of his neck.""

She burst out laughing and then said:

""You two are going to get along great! You'll tame the beast, I'm sure of it.""

I wasn't so sure about that. Maybe I shouldn't even unpack my bags, this man was going to eat me alive!",1,1749712441.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Have any of you been right in the middle of a task, only to find your mind wandering aimlessly just five minutes later? 🌀 Yeah, me too. I was getting tired of my attention span being as short as a TikTok video. So, I figured, why not use some science-backed sorcery to combat it? Enter: **Box Breathing**. 🌬️

Picture this: seven days, just a few minutes a day. Could this really unscramble the spaghetti in my brain? Spoiler alert... it totally did! 🧠

Here's the gist of **Box Breathing** if it's new to you:
- **Inhale for 4 seconds**: Imagine filling up a balloon with the most zen vibes.
- **Hold for 4 seconds**: Let your inner calm secure itself in place.
- **Exhale for 4 seconds**: Release like deflating a stress balloon.
- **Hold for 4 seconds**: Feel the peaceful void before the next inhale.

Repeat this like a meditative mantra and voilà, you’re box-breathing like a pro! So, what happened during my 7-day test run? Here are some golden nuggets I discovered:

- **Unexpected Peace**: Day 1 felt a little awkward, NGL. By Day 3, it was like hitting a mental mute button on chaos. Less cortisol chaos, more zen. ✌️
  
- **Focus & Clarity**: By midweek, my task list didn't look so scary. Attention to the details seemed, dare I say, almost easy?
  
- **Stress Reduction**: I actually caught myself laughing at things that used to stress me out. Who am I? 😂

- **Sleep**: This wasn’t even my goal, but I found myself dozing off peacefully at night – like my body was actually in a relaxation club.

I know, I know... sounds a bit woo-woo, right? But it’s all backed by some cool science about lowering cortisol, our fight-or-flight buddy gone rogue. And trust me, if it can work on this easily-distracted noodle, it might just do wonders for you too.

Have any of you tried Box Breathing or a similar technique? Let me know if you're giving it a shot, or if you have other focus hacks up your sleeve. Let's keep this convo going over virtual coffee. ☕️😄

One second I was hidden in the shadows, and the next my claws were digging into my palms, blood dripping onto the marble floor. Control, Ava. You can’t shift here. I stood in the darkest corner of Moonlight Lodge’s ballroom. My champagne tasted like cardboard. Shadow Creek pack was still a mess after our Alpha’s death last month. Not the time or place for me to lose control. Jackson and Sophia swayed on the dance floor. My ex-fated mate couldn’t keep his hands off the Silverpeak princess. When she laughed at whatever he whispered, pain shot through my mark. My neck burned where he’d marked me. Four months ago, he swore we were meant to be. Now he’s chasing power instead of love. His plan was simple: marry the Alpha King’s daughter, become Shadow Creek’s next Alpha. Easy upgrade from dating a nobody like me. My fangs were already pressing against my lower lip. No amount of breathing exercises would stop this shift if I stayed watching them another minute. I set down my champagne and made a beeline for the bar. Maybe alcohol could drown the rage before I fully transformed in a room full of elites who’d eat me alive for the entertainment value. “Double whiskey,” I growled, not bothering to hide the gravel in my voice. The bartender’s eyes widened at what must have been the yellow glow of my irises. “Make that a Moonlight Martini for the lady,” a deep voice cut in. “And the whiskey for me.” My wolf froze mid-snarl. Just… stopped. Like someone had hit pause on her fury. I turned and looked up—way up—into eyes the color of a storm-tossed sea. They weren’t just looking at me; they were seeing through me. He wasn’t pretty-boy handsome like Jackson. This man’s face had character—laugh lines at the corners of his eyes, a slight crease between his brows from frowning too much. Dark hair with silver at the temples. His suit fit him like a second skin, but couldn’t hide the raw power underneath. But his scent—fuck. Rain-soaked pine trees, woodsmoke, and something wild that made my wolf sit up and beg. The complete opposite to Jackson’s cologne-masked scent that never made my wolf react like this. “I didn’t ask for your input,” I said, trying to sound tough while my wolf was practically rolling over. One corner of his mouth kicked up. “You’re about thirty seconds from shifting in a roomful of pack leaders. The drink has wolfsbane extract. It’ll help.” I glanced down at my hands. Claws, not fingernails. “Whatever,” I muttered. The bartender slid over the martini—swirling silver-blue like moonlight on water. The stranger leaned closer. “Drink up. Your eyes are giving you away.” I knocked it back in one go, grimacing at the bitter aftertaste. “Better?” he asked, voice so deep I felt it in my chest. The effect was almost immediate. My wolf settled, claws retracting, teeth returning to normal. “Thanks,” I said reluctantly. “Though I’m not sure why you give a damn if I make a scene.” His eyes flicked to the dance floor, then back to me with unexpected heat. “Let’s just say I have a soft spot for underdogs.” Before I could respond, people started moving aside, stepping back to clear a path. For him. The penny dropped. “You’re Blake Morgan,” I said, my stomach doing a backflip. “The Silverpeak Alpha.” The Alpha King. The one who could destroy every Alpha in the world with a single command. My wolf cowered and preened at the same time, a confusing mix. “And you’re wearing a mate mark that’s being rejected.” His gaze dropped to my neck where the silver-white mark throbbed. “Who did that to you?” The question hung between us. Telling the Alpha King that his future son-in-law had marked and abandoned me seemed like a bad idea. “Someone who decided power was more attractive than keeping his word,” I said instead. His eyes narrowed slightly. “Your control is slipping again. Come with me.” It wasn’t a suggestion. The words carried the weight of Alpha command, pressing against my will. My wolf, weirdly, didn’t mind. He guided me toward a private elevator, not touching me but close enough that his body heat reached across the inches between us. My skin prickled like I’d stuck my finger in an outlet. The top floor suite was bigger than my entire house. Floor-to-ceiling windows framed the forest and mountains beyond, silver moonlight pouring across dark furniture. He went to a cabinet, returning with a glass of water and some dried herbs. “Chew these,” he instructed. I raised an eyebrow. “You always carry herbs for random werewolves having meltdowns?” “Only the interesting ones.” Something dangerous flashed in his eyes. “The mark on your neck—it’s making you lose control, isn’t it?” I touched it reflexively, wincing. “They never covered ‘what to do when your fated mate dumps you’ in werewolf school.” “It’s strange to see a marked wolf without their mate present.” His voice dropped lower. “Especially at an event where that mate might be.” The gears turned behind his eyes. He was connecting the dots—my reaction downstairs, the mark, his daughter’s fiancé. “It’s Jackson, isn’t it?” he asked quietly. “My daughter’s fiancé marked you.” I couldn’t speak, but my silence said it all. “When?” “Four months ago,” I said, tasting the bitterness. “Right before he decided being the next Shadow Creek Alpha was worth more than honoring a fated mate bond.” Blake’s jaw tightened, the only sign that my words hit home. “And he never tried to break the mark properly?” “Apparently dumping me in a coffee shop with ‘it’s not personal, it’s politics’ counts as closure in his book.” Blake moved closer, his scent wrapping around me like a warm blanket. My wolf, who should have been cowering before the most powerful Alpha in our world, was instead practically purring. “May I?” His fingers hovered near my neck, not quite touching the mark. I should have said no. This was Sophia’s father. Jackson’s future father-in-law. But my wolf pressed forward, tilting my head to expose the mark. When his fingertips brushed my skin, lightning shot through me. His eyes darkened, pupils expanding. Something flashed in his expression—surprise, confusion, then interest. Instead of pulling away, he traced the outline of the mark. Heat bloomed from his touch, not the burning pain I’d gotten used to, but something warm and sweet that pooled low in my belly. I couldn’t deny it. My wolf was straining toward him like he was the last steak on earth. “Why?” I whispered. Why am I reacting to my ex’s future father-in-law? He shook his head slowly, still touching my neck. “I don’t know what this is. But I want to find out.” The pull between us grew stronger with each heartbeat. When he finally leaned down, it felt inevitable—his mouth meeting mine with a hunger that matched my own. My hands grabbed his shirt, dragging him closer. His arms wrapped around me, lifting me effortlessly against him. It was crazy. Completely nuts. He was the father of the woman who’d stolen my mate. The most powerful werewolf alive. And I was nobody—just a Delta’s adopted daughter with a worthless mate mark. My wolf didn’t care. She recognized something in him that cut through all that human BS. Just as his hands slid lower, a voice sliced through my mind: Ava… they took your father… I gasped, color draining from my face. My mother’s voice, shaky and terrified, crashed through our mindlink with an urgency that chilled my blood.",1,1749712082.0,NovelNexus,1,1.0,False

“Mrs. Daniel, your husband’s frozen sperm, stored here at the hospital, was taken five years ago. It was donated to Ms. Gabrielle Hawkins. Didn’t he tell you?”

Clarissa Daniel’s smile froze the second she heard that name. For a moment, she thought she’d misheard and asked again in an unsteady voice, “Is it possible there was a mistake? My husband’s name is Norris Daniel.”

The doctor tapped the keyboard a few more times, double-checking. Then he looked up and said firmly, “There’s no mistake. I can still remember, when Ms. Hawkins gave birth, Mr. Daniel even sent a thank-you banner to the hospital.”

The words hit her like a blow. Her hand, resting on the wheelchair arm, slipped off, powerless, then a buzzing filled her ears.

Five years ago, she and Norris got married.

Back then, he’d told her he didn’t want her to suffer through childbirth, and had volunteered to get a vasectomy. She’d been so touched by his thoughtfulness back then.

Still, fearing he might regret it one day, she insisted he freeze some sperm first, just in case.

Lately, He was under great pressure from his parents. In order to help him share the pain, she also wanted to have a child of their [own.So](http://own.So), she came to the hospital on her own, planning to surprise him with a pregnancy.

But instead, he’d surprised her first.

And the name Gabrielle chilled her to the bone.

Gabrielle was the older girl from next door, whom Norris had secretly loved for fifteen years. He’d planned a grand confession before she went overseas, only to be flat-out rejected.

It was during that heartbreak that Clarissa stayed by his side, warming him with her sunny optimism. Eventually, they got married.

She truly believed he’d moved on, that he’d fallen in love with her.

Now she realized he never had. He never let go of Gabrielle. Clarissa was just the consolation prize in a sad little game she played with herself.

The doctor noticed the sudden change in her complexion and asked a few concerned questions.

Clarissa forced a smile. “I’m fine,” she murmured, wheeling herself out of the hospital and heading home.

Still in a daze, she pushed the door open, assuming the place was empty, until the faint clinking of glasses reached her from the balcony.

“Norris, are you really going through with the divorce? Clarissa’s been with you for five years. Don’t you love her even a little?”

Norris’s voice was lazy, almost indifferent as he replied, “When Gabrielle needed me to get married for the sake of her stability, I agreed. But now she doesn’t need that anymore. And I don’t want to keep Clarissa tied to me out of guilt. That’s the only reason I married her in the first place.”

The voice on the balcony paused, then asked again, more seriously, “Does Clarissa know you and Gabrielle have a child together? She loves you so much. If you really divorce her, I bet she’ll disappear without a trace. You’ll never find her again.”

Norris chuckled. “She doesn’t need to know about the kid. A few days ago, I told her the company’s in trouble and that we needed to fake a divorce. Once she gets used to the idea, I’ll tell her the truth. She’ll understand. Besides, look at her legs. Where can she even go?”

Clarissa felt like her brain had exploded.

'A fake divorce?' The words echoed in her head.

She had believed him, believed the crisis was real. She even gave him the last of her dowry savings to help him through it.

But it was all a lie.

A choked sob rose in her throat, and her chest tightened as if pierced by needles.

She had been planning a future with him, thinking about surprising him on their anniversary.

But he had already erased her from his plans. Guilt was all it took to sum up her ten-year crush and five-year marriage.

She thought she had finally won his heart. Turned out, she was just a placeholder in his love story with someone else.

Looking down at her lifeless legs and remembering the pain she endured to save him, she realized how foolish she’d been.

Instantly, grief turned into rage.

Clarissa suddenly started pounding her legs with her fists, tears splashing onto her thighs, hot and unstoppable.

Suddenly, the voices on the balcony fell silent.

Clarissa froze. She hadn’t meant for them to hear. Panicking, she turned the wheelchair and headed for the front door.

A moment later, Norris came over. His expression flickered with surprise, and his voice dripped with false concern.

“Clarissa, when did you get back? You should’ve called, I’d have come to get you. What did the doctor say?”

She looked at his eyes full of love, but then her eyes welled up again.

Alarmed, Norris reached out, trying to wipe away her tears. “What’s wrong? It’s okay. If you don’t get better, I’ll take care of you forever.”

Clarissa stared into his eyes again, trying to find even a shred of real affection in his eyes. But in the end, she couldn’t bear to know and looked away.

Sniffling softly, she casually asked, “Norris, I’ve been thinking… I’d really like to have a child with you. It’s a good thing we froze some sperm back then. Do you think you can come with me to the hospital sometime soon?”

Upon hearing that, his face changed instantly. He avoided eye contact and mumbled something, clearly trying to change the subject.

“Why bring that up all of a sudden? I don’t want you to suffer through pregnancy. I’d feel awful. Besides, didn’t we agree to travel the world together? Hard to do that with a baby.”

Seeing how uncomfortable he looked, Clarissa closed her eyes. She had her answer.

She slumped slightly in her chair and said, “I’m tired. Can you carry me to the bedroom?”

He nodded and helped her inside. Once he was gone, Clarissa reached for her phone.

“Auntie,” she said quietly, “I’ve made up my mind. I want to go to the Netherlands with you.”

Her aunt's excited voice came through the speaker, but the joy didn’t last long.

“This time… how long are you planning to stay? Don’t tell me you’ll come running back after two days because you miss your husband again.”

Clarissa’s heart clenched. She whispered, “Permanently.”

There was a pause on the other end. Then her aunt’s voice came back, warm and full of resolve. “Okay, then. I’ll start the immigration paperwork.”

After hanging up, Clarissa made another call. But at that time, to her lawyer.

She was done waiting.

Her love couldn’t warm a heart that never opened to her. If Norris wanted a real divorce, then she’d give him exactly what he wanted.

She would turn this fake divorce into a real one and make his lies come true.

End of memories.

Once Clarissa made up her mind to leave Norris for good, she didn’t waste any time. Ahe met with a lawyer to sort through their shared assets and financials.

By the time she was ready to head home, a sudden downpour had started. However, she hadn’t brought a driver today and had just hailed a cab to the quiet little coffee shop where she met her lawyer. Now, with the heavy rain coming down in sheets and barely a car in sight, Clarissa found herself stuck.

She’d wait under the awning for the rain to pass and kindly refused her offer to help.

Hours passed, but the rain didn’t let up. It only grew heavier as the sky turned from gray to pitch-black. As such, her legs, still recovering, began to ache. With no other option, she finally pulled out her phone and called him.

“Norris,” she said softly, “can you come pick me up?”

The urgency in his voice was immediate. He barely got out a few words before hanging up, promising he was on his way.

That call sparked a small warmth in her chest.

Maybe he still cared. Maybe not everything between them was a lie. Could she give him one last chance?

But just as he turned the corner from his street, Norris’s phone buzzed with a message that froze him in place.

\[Gabrielle: Norris, I’m back.\]

His heart skipped a beat. Without hesitation, he pulled over, sent a quick message to his driver, and spun the car around. The tires screeched as he sped off, heading straight for the airport.

Back in the rain, Clarissa sat in her wheelchair, rehearsing in her mind what she would say to him. She’d tell him about her fears, her confusion, the aching need to believe they could still make this work.

But night fell, the storm quieted to a drizzle, and rain pooled around the base of her wheels, yet Norris never came.

Her heart sank deeper and deeper, until it felt like it had hit rock bottom.

She called him again, but there was no answer. Still, she tried again, and finally, someone picked up. But it wasn’t him.

A woman’s voice, soft, almost pleading, echoed from the other end.

“Norris, do you really not love me anymore?”

After a brief silence came Norris’s voice, low and tight with emotion.

“Gabrielle... I’m married now.”

The woman didn’t back down and asked, “But you still came for me, didn’t you? Then tell me, why would you leave your wife, who’s only five kilometers away, just to drive thirty kilometers to pick me up?”

Clarissa’s whole body went still.

She opened her mouth, tried to speak, but no sound came. Her throat burned, words trapped behind pain.

At that moment, panic set in. She wanted to hang up, to stop hearing this, but her trembling hand accidentally hit the speaker button instead.

Norris’s voice rang out clearly as he replied, “Yes. I can’t forget you. Are you happy now?”

Clarissa’s breath caught, stunned. And then, the unmistakable sound of lips meeting rang out from the other end.

In a hurry, her hand fumbled as she ended the call, but in the chaos, the phone slipped and landed in the water. She reached for it without thinking and forgot all about her damaged legs.

She fell hard onto the pavement, right into the cold rain.

For a moment, she lay there, frozen. The storm kept beating down on her, soaking her completely. And then, something inside her broke.

She buried her face in her arms and sobbed.

Fifteen years, she had loved a man who only had eyes for someone else.

Five years of marriage, only to find out it had all been built on guilt and that she had merely been a placeholder.

""Why? Why..."" she whispered over and over, her voice cracking through the rain like a broken song.

Her tears blended with the rain, her pain heavier than the cold that seeped into her bones. And eventually, darkness took her.

When Clarissa finally woke up, she was in a hospital bed.

She blinked slowly, disoriented. A glance at the clock told her it was already noon the next day.

Her phone, which someone had carefully dried out overnight, sat on the bedside table, fully functional, but still silent. No messages. Not a single word from him.

She sat up, just about to call for the discharge paperwork, when the door opened.

She turned her head, a flicker of hope sparking in her eyes, only to see the driver walk in.

The light in her eyes faded instantly.

“Mrs. Daniel,” he greeted awkwardly. “Mr. Daniel’s car got stuck last night, so he asked me to pick you up. How are you feeling?”

Clarissa forced a smile and nodded. The excuse was pathetic, but she didn’t want to make things harder for the driver. So, she simply said, “I’m alright. Let’s go home.”

As such, he quickly took care of the discharge and brought her back.

When they reached the front door, she sat outside for a long time, trying to pull herself together. Only after smoothing out her expression and faking a smile did she open the door.

But the moment she pushed it open, she heard a voice inside.

“Norris, look how much Matthew looks like you.”

Chapter 2

Third Person's POV

Clarissa’s hands froze on the wheels of her chair, stuck in the entryway, unable to go any further.

But Norris’s voice still reached her ears.

“Gabrielle,” he said firmly, “I don’t want to hear you say things like that again, especially not when Clarissa is around.”

Gabrielle’s smile stiffened for a moment. She brushed her hair behind her ear and murmured, “Alright.But one day you will tell her the truth that your divorce is not a fake one but a real one.”

Clarissa stood frozen by the door. Her heart thudded in her chest as she turned to leave, desperate to get out, but in her panic, she bumped hard into the shoe cabinet.

Silence filled the room, and then came hurried footsteps.

Moments later, Norris appeared in front of her, holding a child in his arms.

Clarissa looked up and, unexpectedly, found herself agreeing with what Gabrielle had said earlier. The child really did look like him.

When Norris saw the redness in her eyes, his heart skipped a beat. He quickly set the child down and knelt in front of her, taking her hand in his.

“Clarissa, what happened? My car broke down last night, so I asked the driver to pick you up. Where did you go? Why did he take so long getting you home? If he can’t even do his job right, I’ll just find someone else.”

His concern sounded caring, but every word pierced her like a thorn. She gave a bitter laugh. He hadn’t even bothered to coordinate his lies with the driver.

She had thought she'd grown numb to all of this, that she wouldn’t feel the pain anymore.

But her heart still ached.

Turning away, she wiped the tears from the corner of her eyes and forced a smile. “It’s nothing worth fussing over. I was with a friend.”

Norris visibly relaxed. “As long as you were with someone you trust. When did you get home? I didn’t hear a thing.”

And just like that, Clarissa understood.

All that faux concern was just a setup for this question.

He wanted to know if she’d overheard anything she wasn’t supposed to.

The warmth inside her turned cold. She pulled her hand back and replied calmly, “I just got in. I didn’t hear a thing.”

Norris’s smile faltered, and his hand hung awkwardly in the air. Even so, he didn’t press the issue.

Clarissa looked past him and noticed the woman still standing behind.

Norris quickly stood and explained, “Clarissa, Gabrielle just got back here and doesn’t have a place to stay. Coincidentally, she’s also become my mom’s new doctor, so I let her stay here for now. Don’t get it wrong.”

The way he tried to defend Gabrielle was so natural and instinctive, extinguishing the last flicker of hope in Clarissa’s chest.

She looked away and clenched her fists, trying to maintain a shred of dignity. “I understand. I’m tired. I’d like to rest now.”

Norris was caught off guard by her composure. A strange feeling tugged at him, but he didn’t dwell on it. Assuming she just needed sleep, he moved to wheel her into the master bedroom.

But she stopped him, saying, “I want to go to my own room.”

In that instant, he froze.

Clarissa didn’t understand why he’d suddenly halted until Gabrielle stepped forward, child in tow, and pointed toward a door.

“You mean that room?” she asked, her tone light, but her words sharp. “That used to be my room when I lived here. I’m used to it, so Norris said I could have it again.”

She called him with such familiarity that it made Clarissa’s stomach turn. More than that, she heard the deliberate challenge in Gabrielle’s voice.

Clarissa turned her head slowly, searching Norris’s expression, hoping for a word of support.

But he offered none.

“It’s just a room,” he said with a shrug. “If Gabrielle wants it, then let's just let her be. I’ll just get the guest room cleaned up for you.”

Clarissa shut her eyes for a moment, fighting back the tide of hurt swelling in her chest.

That room was the one he had carefully decorated for her right after they married. He’d given it to her because he knew her parents had died young, and she had no family to go back to.

He told her that the room would be her sanctuary. If she was ever angry with him and didn’t want to talk, she could go there, and he’d know to come make things right.

But now, he’d given it away like it meant nothing.

Like it was just a room.

Clarissa pressed her hand to her chest, trying to ease the tight, suffocating ache.

Then, firmly insisted, “No. I want that room.”

Third Person's POV

As soon as the words left her mouth, the atmosphere in the room grew heavy.

Norris’s brows furrowed. He couldn’t understand why Clarissa was making such a fuss over a room. Before he could say anything, Matthew came running over.

He charged straight at Clarissa, waving his arms and hitting her legs and face with tiny but surprisingly sharp blows.

“You’re a bad person! A bad lady! Don’t bully my mom! That’s my mom’s room!”

Though small, the boy’s strikes had force behind them. Clarissa’s legs throbbed from the impact. Just as she reached out to push him away, he yanked her hair instead. Pain shot through her scalp, and she instinctively grabbed his wrist to stop him.

But before she could say a word, Matthew screamed.

“Mommy! My hand hurts! She’s hurting me! She’s bullying me! Waaah!”

His wails echoed through the massive villa.

Clarissa winced as her scalp throbbed, tears springing to her eyes from the sting. Her first instinct was to look at Norris. But he wasn’t looking at her, his worried gaze was fixed on Matthew.

She followed his line of sight, and her heart dropped. Matthew’s wrist was bleeding.

Shocked, she sat frozen as Gabrielle scooped the child into her arms, tears streaming down her face as she cradled him.

Clarissa’s mind was still blank when Norris’s voice exploded in fury.

“Clarissa! Matthew is just a kid. What are you doing, picking a fight with him? I already told you Gabrielle is just staying here temporarily. Do you really have to keep holding on to the past? It's just a room. Do you have to be so petty and pick a fight with her over it?”

His blatant favoritism hit Clarissa like a slap to the face, but she forced herself to stay calm.

“Norris—” she began, her voice low.

But he cut her off sharply. “Enough! This is still my house, and it’s not your place to decide who stays where. I gave her that room. Even if you're upset, why did you take it out on a child? I’m really disappointed in you. Think about your actions.”

With that, he stormed out the door, carrying Matthew in his arms like a devoted father. Gabrielle followed close behind.

As she passed Clarissa, Gabrielle threw her a quick smile—small, smug, and unmistakably triumphant.

Only then did she understand everything.

With the red marks from Matthew’s hits still fresh on her face, she watched the three of them together like one happy family. At that moment, she realized she was the outsider.

The tears came uncontrollably then. Her breathing grew ragged, and her chest ached like she couldn’t pull in enough air. She had no idea how long she had cried. At some point, she must have cried herself to sleep.

She was just jolted awake by the ringing of her phone.

She picked it up and heard her aunt’s familiar, gentle voice on the other end.

“Clarissa, the immigration paperwork will be finalized within a week. Are you serious this time? You’re not backing out again, are you? It’s been so long. I miss you.”

Clarissa gave a bitter smile. “I’m serious. I might be bothering you for the rest of my life.”

There was a short pause before her aunt spoke again.

“What about Norris? Are you two… divorced?”

Clarissa let out a quiet, “Mm.Divorced, it's a real divorce."" Clarissa repeated painfully, remembering what Norris said.

Her aunt’s heart ached for her, but she knew comforting words wouldn’t help. So instead, she offered warmth.

“Then start packing. I’ll come to pick you up in a week. Don’t worry about bringing anything. We’ve got everything you need here in the Netherlands.”

“Daryll is still worried about you. He is the Daryll who pursued you when they were little.”

Aunt bit of kindness finally eased the weight in Clarissa’s chest.

After they hung up, she looked around the house. There really wasn’t anything she needed to take with her.

If Gabrielle wanted the room so badly, let her have it.

She could have Norris, too.

That night, Clarissa picked a clean guest room at random, curled up on the bed, and quickly drifted off.

She didn’t know how long she’d slept before a sharp sound of glass shattering startled her awake.

She shot upright and followed the noise, which had come from the master bedroom.

Confused, she wondered what kind of glass item would even be in there. But as she got closer to the door, a sudden chill ran through her. Her instincts screamed that something wasn’t right.

She rushed to the door, pushed it open, and her eyes went wide.

“What the hell are you doing?!”

Chapter 3

Third Person's POV

Glass shards covered the floor. The once-beautiful wedding photo that used to hang on the wall was now shattered and torn beyond repair.

Matthew was stomping on her face in the picture, laughing as he did, spewing crude words that no child his age should even know.

Across the room, Gabrielle turned her head with a smirk, clearly enjoying the scene. Her eyes locked on Clarissa with a mocking glint. She didn’t see her as a threat, barely even as a person.

Then she turned to her son and gave him instructions like she was coaching a performance.

""Matthew, do you want Daddy or not? If you do, then do exactly what Mommy just told you.""

The boy nodded like an obedient little soldier. Then, without a second of hesitation, he picked up a lighter and flicked it on, holding it to a diary clutched in his other hand.

Clarissa's heart seized.

“No! Don’t. Don’t do that!” she shouted, panic surging through her chest.

Frantically, she pushed her wheelchair forward, chasing him down the room. But Matthew thought it was a game. He ran in circles, always just out of reach, laughing like this was all some kind of sick fun.

By the time she finally caught up, the damage was done. The diary had burned to nothing—just a pile of gray ash.

Clarissa’s hands trembled as she picked up the one tiny, half-burnt corner left. Her shoulders shook with sobs she could no longer hold back.

That diary had been the only thing her parents left her. It documented their short lives, their hopes, and their love. It was her only connection to them. For years, in the lonely silence of her life, she'd read it to feel less alone.

When she married Norris, she had brought it with her to this house. She wanted to lock it away, but he told her not to worry.

""As long as I’m here, no one would dare touch it,"" he had said.

But he didn’t keep his word.

Now, not only had someone touched it—they’d destroyed it. And he’d let them walk in and do it.

Clarissa clutched the tiny scrap of paper tightly in her palm. Her voice was raw with fury and heartbreak as she shouted, “Gabrielle! Is this how you raise your son? Teaching him to destroy things that don’t belong to him? Did you ever teach him what basic respect even means?”

For a moment, Gabrielle looked taken aback. Her eyes reddened, and tears welled up.

“Matthew never had a father growing up. I raised him alone. Blame me if you want, but he’s still just a child. You don’t have to be so harsh. I’m sorry, okay? I’ll apologize.”

Clarissa frowned, unsure how to respond, but then she felt a heavy gaze.

She turned and saw Norris standing at the doorway, his expression dark. He strode toward them, face set in a deep scowl.

“Clarissa,” he said, “he’s a child. Why do you keep picking fights with him? Gabrielle even agreed to give you the room back. Isn’t that enough? Do you really have to drive them out to feel satisfied?”

His voice was sharp, edged with frustration.

Clarissa’s heart clenched. She held up the charred piece of the diary with shaking hands, her voice breaking as she tried to explain, “Norris, do you even know what he—”

Before she could finish, he slapped the burnt scrap from her hand.",1,1749712022.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

I’ve been more active in r/pourover, but as I’ve grown more curious about decaf and started seeking out better options, this subreddit has become one of my favorite places to learn and get inspired.

That curiosity is also part of what pushed me and my partner Martin to build [Roastguide](https://roast.guide/)  \- a free, community-driven app for rating, tracking, and exploring specialty coffee. Like a personal coffee log meets a collective guidebook (or more simply, an Untappd or Vivino for coffee).

Martin and I are two coffee enthusiasts with a background in tech (Apple and Shopify are in our past lives), and after years of wishing there were a better way to track what we’d brewed, learn from others, and discover new roasts, we finally decided to build it ourselves.

One feature I think this group will especially appreciate: you can easily **search for decaf roasts** across a growing number of roasters (currently close to 900 in the app, and we're adding more every day). We’ve made it a priority to give decaf the visibility it deserves, not as an afterthought :)

Being overwhelmed at stores and cars due to noises is also a bit newer. I use to be able to tolerate the noises but now it's difficult. I was always sensitive to loud noise but different circumstances e.g. fireworks, playground screaming, loud music (my dad use to play it very loud and I would complain a lot) but those are a little more normal. At least the last two. I know i was called weird or dramatic for the firework thing.

But growing up I never really had sensory issues, did a lot of sensory seeking behaviors but nothing seemed to overwhelm me until now. 

Or could sensory seeking turn into sensory issues down the line? Can you go from needed the complete opposite or is it mostly consistent?

I’d feel fresh in the morning, but by lunch, my breath was stale again. I even started avoiding close conversations.

That’s when I found a *Larineco gum reddit* post talking about a **remineralizing gum** that helps with breath *and* overall oral health. I figured I’d give it a try. I ordered **Larineco gum** and chewed it twice a day for a month.

Here’s what changed and why I’m still using it.

**Why Larineco gum worked when others didn’t**

Most gums cover up odor with overpowering mint. Larineco is different. It uses **Xylitol** to kill odor-causing bacteria, **Mastic** to reduce plaque and inflammation, and **Nano Hydroxyapatite** to strengthen enamel and neutralize acidity - all major causes of persistent bad breath.

It doesn’t just cover up the problem. It helps fix what’s causing it.

**What I noticed in 4 weeks**

**Week 1:**  
Dry mouth faded fast. That weird sticky feeling in the afternoon? Gone.

**Week 2:**  
My breath stayed fresher, even after coffee or meals. I didn’t need to reach for mints.

**Week 3:**  
My teeth felt smoother, and I noticed I wasn’t waking up with that awful morning breath anymore.

**Week 4:**  
Someone at work told me I “always smell minty clean.” I’ve never heard that before.

* Super easy - just chew and go

Hello, I'm posting on behalf of my girlfriend. She works at a coffee shop and recently noticed that her manager changed the time she clocked off by almost a full hour almost every night last week. The problem is the times were changed to 20 minutes before close and they're usually there until 40 minutes after close doing cleanup. 

They close at 9pm. Her manager changed her clock out time to 8:41pm. They did not close early and my girlfriend was serving customers up until 9pm. She continued performing work related duties until almost 9:40 that night.

I told her this is time theft but what can she do? What should her next steps be?",2,1749711651.0,legaladvice,1,1.0,False

Not like storms do.

Not with slammed doors

or final words

or the clean break of something broken.



No, you left like autumn does—

still warm in the corners

long after the cold creeps in.



Now, it’s quieter.

Not gone.

Just quieter.



You arrive unannounced,

a wakeup kiss, coffee still warm on your lips,

a candle flickering, shadows dancing through my heart,

a crack of thunder on a sunny day

that knows exactly where to find me.



I don’t brace for you anymore.

Your name comes and goes from my lips

and scarcely makes a sound—

except in the spaces where I used to make room for you.



You used to stay.

You used to sit on the porch of my plans

and drink coffee with my hopes.

Now you visit like a dream:

brief, familiar,

and gone before I remember.



And still, you soften the silence.

Still, you pull the ache from its shelf

and leave it humming low,

the way old houses remember

who used to live in them.

pretty sure this diet is just not for me for several different reasons plus I'm having a hard time getting enough fat without eating a whole bunch of butter or just plain fat which is not pleasant to eat whatsoever

Now as a person with celiac disease I used to eat a lot of rice and gluten-free pasta potatoes and a little bit of meat, unfortunately there's not a whole lot you can eat that's not cross-contaminated or full of that crap I mean you can't even lick the postage stamp and only a microscopic amount can make you very sick pretty much instantly so you got to be super careful on your diet. 

So if I want to go back to a regular diet how would I go about this?

I was thinking maybe just adding a couple spoons of sugar to my coffee for a few days,   maybe start with small portions of rice or gluten-free pasta

Context: Before pa maging kami ni bf, naging friends kami saglit. So alam ko yung mga past flings nya, naka apat rin siya. But one girl in particular, they lasted 4 months in a situationship daw tapos sabi nya dun na sana siya ready mag commit, but hindi raw natuloy kasi naging busy na si ate girl, and eventually parang unspoken na lang na wala na. June 2024 sila nag end pero matagal rin siya nag move on. Sabi niya,nitong November, 2024 lang. Kaya siguro unconsciously, medyo may doubt pako. Kasi mag feb palang nung nagkakilala kami. Pero ayun nga, that time na we're friends, January, mutuals pa sila sa IG. Inunfollow naman niya nung nakita ko kasi nung may something na samin parang na ask ko ano ba name nonn tas ayun kita ko nasa ig nya pa lol. Edi ayun, it started there. 

As a person na sobrang curious talaga, di ko napigilang icheck/istalk. Nakita ko mga lumang reposts, comments, kwento, style, vibe… lahat. Oo na, stalker kung stalker. Pero curious lang talaga ako. I wanted to know what kind of person she was to him. and vice versa.

And at first, hindi ko naman inisip na may mali. Tho I admit na minsan may retroactive jealousy talaga ko and napapagawayan namin. Nakailan din kaming away. Nung mga unang away, he'll reassure me, pero minsan I feel like it wasn't enough kaya nag sspiral parin utak ko sa nga next time. So nung mga madalas na namin napapagawayan yon, I understand if he gets tired to explain na so I accepted na maybe baka ako lang talaga yung mali. So I did my best na not to open that up kasi nung naging kami naman, he was honest sa story nila ni girl. pinakilala ako sa friends niya, binlock si girl, binigay accounts niya, and never ko naman siya nahuling nagtatago ng kung ano. And never naman siya nagkwento sa ex niya unless tinanong ko. Kaya dapat, okay lang ako, ‘di ba? 

Pero minsan, may mga maliliit na bagay parin na paulit-ulit na lang nagti-trigger ng thoughts ko.

Like one time, bigla niya akong tinanong, habanag naglalakad kami sa coffee shop, then we saw posters nagask sha ng “Favorite mo matcha diba?” Nagalit ako non, inopen ko sakanya na kelan ko pa naging fave yon? Then he explained na ganun lang daw talaga siya minsan parang pag distracted siya napapatanong siya nang ganon esp na din sa mga nakikita sa paligid. Pero napaisip ako talaga kasi matcha was HER thing, hindi akin. Tapos minsan, nagbobond kami with my friend and my friend blurted out na nasa Spotify wrapped nya daw si hev abi. Then HE he said sakin na, ""fave mo yun diba?""And I was like WHAT. Pero ganon din—isa yun sa hilig nung girl. Again, inopen ko yun after nang ilang days tas sabi niya na parang pang asar lang daw niya cuz he's tripping kasi parang ganun mga tugtugan ng mga batang genggeng etc. May ganon din na instances sa BLACKPINK, saw their standee kasi tapos inask nya din yon. 

Pero all that, I let it pass. Kasi may explanation naman siya. Pero habang tumatagal, parang andaming ganong tanong na akala mo harmless, pero sa utak ko parang may thread na bumabalik palagi sa kanya.

Pakiramdam ko kasi hindi pa siya over sa girl. Minsan feeling ko na nagsta-stalk pa rin siya behind my back or napapatingin siya sa mga kamukha. Usual kasi yung look ni ex like usually naka bun + eyeglasses kaya parang everywhere may trigger.

Pero for the sake of our relationship, inisip ko na baka hyperfocus lang talaga ko kaya lahat nakokonek ko. So I did my best not to make everything about her. And so umokay namannn. 


Previous Attempt: This day, nag open uli ako ng FB, tapos naopen ko uli dump acc ko na ginagamit ko for stalking, tas nag pop name ni ex sa search bar, kaya naisip ko siya istalk uli para lang ma test yung feeling ko if may mafifeel paba ko, fortunately, wala naman. NOT UNTIL I SAW THAT SPECIFIC PIC. 

It's a pic of the girl from 2022. I know medyo anlayo pero sa albums kasi ako nag check. Naalala ko rin kasi sabi ni bf stalker siya kapag gusto niya tao so nastalk nya na lahat yan if gusto nya yung tao. So that pic, naka peace sign si girl,and has this specific na pose and posture. 

For context, kasi may specific pose na laging ginagawa ni bf sa harap ko kapag nagpapacute siya, yung nagpapatawa, nagpe-peace sign, pa-charming ganon. Sobrang distinct. Tapos habang nag-check ako ng luma sa album, BOOM. Si girl. 2022 pic. Same exact pose. As in na-recognize ko agad in one second. Kasi alam ko ‘yun, yun yung pose na ginagawa ni bf. Sabi niya non sakin na paranf ginagaya niya lang raw old pic ko non pero alam ko sa sarili ko na never ko namang ginawa yung pose na yon. Diko lang pinapansin nung simula but ngayon, I think it's making sense WTF. 

So rn, I couldn’t help but think, all the time he's with me, is it really me he’s thinking of? Or are there moments where he still has her in mind?

I keep gaslighting myself na baka ako lang ‘to. Baka I’m just too observant or over lang sa pag analyze plus my retroactive jealousy.

Pero honestly? It’s not even about the girl anymore. It’s not even jealousy.
It’s just this one fear I can’t shake off.

Ayoko ng feeling na ginagamit or ginamit lang ako para makalimot.
Na baka kaya niya ako pinili is not because he chose me, but because she didn’t choose him. Na baka all this time when he's with me, he's still thinking about her. OA LANG BA KO OR MAHAL NYA PA EX NYA? WHAT SHOULD I DO😭",3,1749711130.0,adviceph,2,1.0,False

I was Elara Vance, a Juilliard violinist living my dream, with a scholarship and the loving support of my charming boyfriend, Julian Thorne.  
When he urgently needed my O-negative bl\*\*d after a supposed sailing accident, I rushed to give it, only to find him perfectly healthy days later, laughing with friends, my half-empty bl\*\*d bag casually discarded.  
My ""loving Julian"" was a monster, boasting about his ""masterpieces of revenge"" - a cold, cruel game he orchestrated for his jealous friend Seraphina.  
He'd sabotaged my career, fed me sugar pills after a staged pool accident, framed me for shoplifting, and even publicly humiliated me while declaring his love for another woman.  
Then, I overheard his final plan: to set fire to my guesthouse during our ""romantic getaway"", trapping me in his apartment like a prisoner.  
His every affectionate word, every grand gesture, was a lie designed to break me, turning my love into a searing h\*miliation and soul-deep betrayal.  
But I wouldn't be his victim.  
I fabricated my own fiery demise and escaped to London, reinventing myself as ""Nightingale,"" a celebrated violinist.  
When Julian, consumed by a disturbing obsession, dragged me back to New York, announcing our forced marriage, I knew the lavish wedding would be the perfect stage for my ultimate counterattack.

Chapter 1  
Elara Vance clutched her violin case, her heart still soaring from practice. Juilliard was a dream, a world away from her quiet upbringing, a dream made possible by hard work and the Hayes Family Philanthropic Scholarship. A scholarship Seraphina Hayes, Julian Thorne's childhood friend, had apparently wanted. Elara knew Seraphina felt slighted, but Julian, her Julian, was always so supportive, so loving. He made the glittering world of New York feel like home.

Her phone buzzed, a frantic text from Julian's number.

""Elara! Emergency! Sailing accident. Hamptons. Need O-neg bl\*\*d. Only you. Private clinic. Address attached. Hurry!""

Panic seized Elara. Julian, reckless on his sailboat. O-negative. Her bl\*\*d type.

She didn't question it. She dropped her violin at her dorm and ran, hailing a cab, her mind a blur of fear for the man she loved.

The clinic was discreet, expensive-looking, just as Julian would arrange.

A calm nurse took a lot of bl\*\*d, more than Elara thought was usual for a donation.

""He'll be okay, right?"" Elara asked, feeling dizzy.

""Mr. Thorne is lucky to have you,"" the nurse said, offering juice.

Elara pushed it away, her only thought Julian. She had to see him. He was everything to her.

Days later, Elara still felt weak, the city's summer heat pressing down. She hadn't heard much from Julian, just short texts saying he was recovering. A knot of worry tightened in her stomach. She had to see him, make sure he was truly okay. She took the subway to his Upper East Side apartment. The doorman, used to her, nodded her through.

The apartment door was slightly ajar. Laughter drifted out, Julian's distinct baritone mixed with the braying of his friends, Chad and Bryce, and Tiffany's shrill giggle.

Elara pushed the door open a little more, peering in.

Julian was lounging on his leather sofa, a drink in hand, looking perfectly healthy. No sign of any accident. On the coffee table, next to discarded food containers, was a medical bl\*\*d bag - her bl\*\*d bag - half-empty, leaking onto a stack of glossy magazines.

Tiffany pointed at it. ""Seriously, Julian, the bl\*\*d bag was a bit much, even for you. What'd you even do with it?""

Julian smirked, swirling his drink. ""Poured most of it down the drain, darling. Can't have evidence, can we?""

""This was the most elaborate prank yet, Thorne! Number nineteen, right?"" Chad guffawed, slapping Julian's back. ""Making her think you needed her precious O-neg.""

""Nineteen masterpieces of revenge,"" Julian drawled, his eyes glinting. ""Seraphina will be pleased. She was so cut up about that scholarship.""

Bryce chimed in, ""Remember the locket? The 'priceless heirloom'?""

Julian chuckled. ""A ten-dollar trinket. Watching her search Central Park in that blizzard for a fake? Priceless. She even got pneumonia. I was so ‘worried'.""

Tiffany squealed. ""And the recital! That ‘avant-garde masterpiece' you ‘found' for her? The sound of a dying cat would have been more melodic. Her face!""

""The charity gala was my personal favorite,"" Julian said, his voice dripping with contempt. ""That ridiculous chicken costume. ‘Artistic statement,' I told her. The photos went viral. She actually believed I was outraged on her behalf.""

They all roared with laughter.

Elara saw Julian then, truly saw him. He wasn't pale or injured. He was vibrant, his eyes cold and cruel as he basked in his friends' admiration. The sailing accident, the urgent need for her bl\*\*d - all a lie. Another twisted game.

""It was for Seraphina, of course,"" Julian continued, his voice smooth. ""She was devastated when Elara, that little charity case, won the Hayes Family Philanthropic Scholarship. The one Seraphina considered her birthright. Little Miss Nobody waltzing into Juilliard on Hayes money? Seraphina couldn't stand it. So, I promised her Elara would pay.""

Elara's world tilted. Her breath hitched. The floor seemed to drop away. Each memory of Julian's affection, his grand gestures, his loving words, now felt like a carefully placed shard of glass. The bl\*\*d donation, her fear, her sacrifice - it was all a joke to him. The most elaborate prank yet. Nineteen of them. Her body swayed, a wave of nausea and profound weakness washing over her. The room spun.

H\*miliation, hot and sharp, burned through her. She couldn't breathe. She turned and fled, stumbling out of the apartment, out of the building, into the indifferent city streets. The laughter followed her, echoing in her ears. She ran, tears streaming down her face, a raw sob tearing from her throat.

Her phone rang. Her father.

""Ellie-bean? Just calling to check in. Your mom and I, we've firmed up the Colorado plans. House is picked out. We'll be moving right after my official retirement ceremony next month. You still thinking about coming with us for a bit, get away from the city noise?""

His calm, steady voice was an anchor in her storm.

""Yes, Dad,"" Elara choked out, her voice hoarse. The city felt like a cage, Julian's laughter the bars. ""Yes, I'm coming. I want to come home. Now.""

The decision, once a vague possibility for a summer break, solidified into an urgent need. New York, Juilliard, her music - it all felt tainted, poisoned by Julian Thorne.

Chapter 2  
""Are you sure, Elara?"" her father's voice was gentle through the phone. ""You love Juilliard.""

""I'm sure, Dad,"" Elara said, her voice flat. The vibrant dream of New York had shattered. All she felt was a desperate need to escape.

Her mother got on the line. ""Honey, is everything alright with you and Julian? You sounded… upset.""

The question hung in the air. Elara pictured Julian's smirking face, heard his cruel laughter.

""There is no me and Julian,"" Elara stated, each word a cold, hard stone. The love she'd felt, so pure and deep, had curdled into something bitter and corrosive. The memories of his touch, his k\*\*ses, now made her skin crawl. She would never forget the image of her bl\*\*d, her life force, discarded like tr\*\*h.

She hung up and took a cab to the Greenwich Village apartment Julian had insisted they get together. Their ""love nest,"" he'd called it. Now, the words mocked her. It was just another stage for his deceptions, another way to control her, to isolate her. The rent was astronomical, paid by Thorne money, of course.

Elara walked through the rooms, a bitter taste in her mouth. She remembered Julian carrying her over the threshold, promising forever. She'd believed him. She'd imagined filling this space with music, with love, with their future. Now, every corner held a phantom, a lie.

She went to the bedroom, her heart a leaden weight. The closet was full of clothes Julian had bought her, dresses for galas, casual wear for weekends in the Hamptons. Gifts. All part of the charade. She pulled out a g\*\*bage bag from under the sink and began to fill it. Every dress, every scarf, every piece of jewelry, every handwritten note professing his undying love. Each item felt like a betrayal, a testament to her own naivety.

The door opened. Julian. He looked surprised to see her there, surrounded by bags.

""Elara? What are you doing? Spring cleaning?"" He smiled, that charming, disarming smile that used to make her heart melt. Now, it was just a mask.

""Getting rid of things I don't need anymore,"" Elara said, her voice devoid of emotion. She continued stuffing a silk blouse into the bag, a blouse he'd said made her eyes sparkle.

He frowned, a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes. ""You've been distant. Are you still feeling weak from the… donation?""

""I'm fine,"" she said, her tone clipped.

He stepped closer, reaching out to touch her arm. ""We were supposed to go to that new gallery opening tonight. Seraphina's mother is one of the patrons.""

Elara pulled her arm away as if burned. ""I'm not going.""

The easy affection he usually displayed felt like poison now, a calculated move in his long game.

Chapter 3  
Julian didn't argue. He simply took her arm, his grip surprisingly strong, and steered her towards the door.

""Don't be difficult, Elara. It's important.""

His tone brooked no refusal. Elara went, a cold knot of dread in her stomach. It was easier than fighting, for now.

At the Thorne summer house party in the Hamptons, the air was thick with money and privilege. Seraphina Hayes was there, draped over Julian's arm, her eyes glittering with a possessiveness that Elara had once dismissed as friendship. Seeing them together now, Seraphina's smug smile, Julian's easy intimacy with her, it was like a physical blow. Seraphina met Elara's gaze, a triumphant little smirk playing on her lips. The ""why"" of Julian's cruelty was standing right there, beautiful and vindictive.

Julian quickly excused himself, following Seraphina towards the sprawling gardens, leaving Elara alone by the pool. She felt exposed, vulnerable.

A moment later, Chad and Bryce appeared, smirking.

""Enjoying the party, scholarship girl?"" Chad sneered.

""Julian's busy. Guess you're not his priority tonight,"" Bryce added, his eyes cruel.

They flanked her, backing her towards the edge of the pool. Elara was a poor swimmer, something Julian knew.

""Oops,"" Chad said, ""accidentally"" shoving her.

Elara hit the water with a splash, the cold shocking her. She flailed, gasping, the deep end pulling her down. Panic clawed at her.

Then, strong arms were around her. Julian. He pulled her out, his face a mask of concern.

""Elara! Are you okay?"" He wrapped a towel around her shivering form. ""Clumsy of you.""

She developed a high fever that night. Julian insisted on caring for her, his touch gentle, his voice soothing. He gave her medication, pills he said the doctor prescribed.

""Rest, my love. I'll take care of you.""

But the fever raged on, her body aching, her mind muddled.

Days later, still sick, Elara's phone buzzed. A group text. From Tiffany.

""OMG, Julian, that pool prank was epic! She looked like a drowned rat! And the sugar pills? Genius! Keeping her sick so you can play hero? You're a legend! Seraphina owes you big time!""

Elara's bl\*\*d ran cold. The message was clearly meant for their private group chat, the one that likely detailed all nineteen pranks. Tiffany had sent it to a larger group, one that, by some horrifying oversight, included Elara.

1l9frlh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1l9frlh/the_last_walk_through_westwood/,The Last Walk Through Westwood,"So, you’re finally done with your last final. Maybe you're in Moore 100, or one of those windowless rooms in Boelter where the fluorescent lights hum like they're counting down your final seconds as a student. You flip through the pages one more time, not because you need to check anything, but because once you hand this in, it's over. Really over.

You walk out into the Los Angeles sun - that perfect, golden light that makes everything look like a movie set - and for a second, you just stand there on the Court of Sciences steps. Or maybe it's already dark, after one of those brutal 6-10 PM finals, and the campus lights are just flickering on. Either way, you're frozen. Because this is it. Every all-nighter in Powell. Every sprint across campus to make it to Bunche on time. Every moment you sat in traffic on the 405, questioning every life choice that led you here. Done.

There's no fanfare. No credits rolling. You just... walk.

You find yourself wandering through campus without purpose. Past Royce Hall, lit up against the twilight like it's posing for another postcard. You remember your first day, taking that obligatory photo on the quad, thinking four years felt like forever. Now forever is over, and Royce is still there, unchanging, while everything inside you is shifting.

Bruin Walk is still buzzing with life - students rushing to their next class, clubs trying to hand you flyers you'll never need again. But you're not part of it anymore. You drift through like you're already a memory, past the tables where you used to sit between classes, past the spot where someone from your discussion section became your best friend, past all the pieces of your life that are already becoming history.

You end up at Powell, because where else would you go? This library that became your second home, your refuge, your personal purgatory during finals week. You can still feel the indent your body made in that one chair on the second floor. The quiet floors where you had mental breakdowns over organic chemistry. The spot by the window where you'd watch the sun set over Westwood and tell yourself you'd figure it all out eventually. The cute stranger you kept seeing in the stacks, always with the same coffee order, always giving you that half-smile that made you wonder what if. You never said hello. Now you never will.

YRL feels different now too. All those late nights in the 24-hour study room, surviving on vending machine coffee and whatever snacks you grabbed from Ackerman. The way the whole building smelled like stress and energy drinks during finals week. The friends you made at 3 AM when everyone was too tired to pretend they had it together. Those moments are sealed inside these walls now, and you're on the outside.

You walk down Bruinwalk one more time, past Kerckhoff where you grabbed coffee every morning, past Ackerman where you bought overpriced blue books and scantrons. The Hill looms in the distance - maybe you lived in Rieber or Hedrick your freshman year, maybe you remember the trek up those stairs that felt like Everest after a long day. Everything is exactly where you left it, but somehow it all feels different. Like the campus is gently closing its doors to you, not out of cruelty, but because it has to make room for the next group of wide-eyed freshmen who'll call this place home.

You know that when you come back, if you come back, it won't be yours anymore. They'll renovate Boelter (finally). They'll tear down buildings that held your hardest classes and your biggest triumphs. Young Alumni Day will feel like visiting your childhood home after another family's moved in. The students will be younger, their references different, their UCLA unrecognizable from yours. You'll be just another alum wandering through, trying to find pieces of yourself in a place that's already moved on.

Then graduation weekend hits like a wave you're not ready for. Pauley Pavilion packed with families, everyone in caps and gowns, trying to spot their people in a sea of light blue. The speakers talk about your bright futures, about being the best and brightest, about changing the world. You smile for the pictures, throw your cap at the right moment, hug everyone like it's not the last time. But underneath, there's this quiet grief that no one talks about.

Your friends - the ones who became family in those tiny dorm rooms, who held your hair back after too many AMFs at Rocco's, who studied with you until dawn in the Night Powell, who knew your Diddy Riese order by heart - they're all about to scatter. Some to San Francisco, some to New York, some back home to places you've never been. You promise to stay in touch, to visit, to keep the group chat alive. But you know how these things go. Life gets busy. People change. Some friendships will survive the distance, but others... this might be the last real moment you have together.

Packing up your apartment in Westwood or Sawtelle feels like dismantling a life. Every poster you take down, every textbook you decide to keep or toss, every UCLA shirt you fold into boxes - it's all evidence of a person you're leaving behind. You walk down Gayley one last time, past Ralphs where you did midnight grocery runs, past In-N-Out where you celebrated every small victory with animal fries, past all the Thai places you swore you'd try but never did.

And then suddenly, you're leaving. Driving down Sunset or Wilshire for the last time as a student, watching campus disappear in your rearview mirror. You think about that first day move-in weekend when your parents helped you haul boxes up endless stairs, when you met your roommate and wondered if you'd get along, when everything felt too big and too scary and too exciting all at once. Was that really you? That nervous eighteen-year-old who didn't know where Bunche Hall was and thought they'd never survive quarter system?

The hardest part is the silence that comes after. No more enrolling in classes at your first pass time, praying you get the professor with the good reviews. No more checking BruinBill and wincing at the total. No more CCLE notifications about assignments you forgot existed. No more running into people you know at the Wooden Center or getting smoothies at Rendezvous. No more Tuesday nights at Barney's or Thursday nights at Rocco's. No more walking home at 2 AM down Landfair, drunk on youth and possibility.

There's no more routine to anchor you. No more 8 AMs you'd skip anyway. No more meal swipes at B Plate or late-night runs to De Neve. No more studying on the Sculpture Garden lawn between classes, pretending to read while really just people-watching. No more sunsets from the top of parking structures, the whole city spread out before you like a promise. No more feeling like you belong to something bigger than yourself.

It's okay if you feel empty. It's okay if you cry in your car in the Ackerman parking structure one last time. It's okay if you drive through campus at night just to see it lit up, just to remember. You're mourning something real, not just the end of college, but the end of a version of yourself that can only exist here, in this specific place, at this specific time.

Because UCLA was never just a school. It was where you became yourself. Where you failed your first midterm and thought the world was ending. Where you learned that you were capable of more than you imagined. Where you found your people, your passion, maybe even your purpose. Where you learned to survive on three hours of sleep and Del Taco. Where you discovered what it meant to fight through challenges and come out stronger.

The hurt means it mattered. It means that for four years (or five, or six, no judgment), this place held all of you. Your struggles with imposter syndrome. Your triumphs when you finally understood that impossible concept. Your 2 AM existential crises. Your moments of pure joy when everything clicked into place.

So take one more walk if you can. Start at the Bruin statue, touch his foot one more time for luck, even though you're not sure what you're wishing for anymore. Walk through Dickson Court as the bells play. Sit on the Janss Steps and watch students rush by, remembering when you were one of them. Breathe in that Southern California air, mixed with jacaranda blooms and possibility.

And when it's time to go, really go, know that you're taking the best parts with you. Every lesson learned in those lecture halls. Every friendship forged in those study rooms. Every moment that made you who you are. Your UCLA lives in you now, in the confidence you gained, in the resilience you built, in the dreams you're brave enough to chase because this place taught you how to fight for them.

You're not alone in this sadness. Every Bruin before you has stood where you're standing, feeling what you're feeling. And every Bruin after you will too. That's the thing about being part of this place - you're connected to something timeless, something that transcends your four years here.

1l9foyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1l9foyd/theres_prolly_something_really_wrong_with_me/,theres prolly something really wrong with me,"hi there, first time using reddit but i figured to come here just to publish my thoughts to anyone that comes across here and i also feel like i cant talk to anyone in my personal life.

i been having depression for a while now, having no motivation to do anything, suicidal thoughts though i dont think ill ever do it, been trying to stay clean from sh and i have loss of appetite.
i realised that my way of thinking and mental state is probably unusual which sorta make sense since mental disorders etc kinda run in the family (my sister has bpd and bipolar issues and my brother has anger issues along with other underlying issues) even though the family aren’t professionally diagnosed its quite obvious that we got a lil sum wrong with us.

i guess my “condition” isn’t as severe as other cases it still bothers me since i am the one living my life. i think im getting worse. one thing ive had throughout my life is obsessive thoughts, i cant stop thinking about certain things and most of them are unwanted thoughts that no matter what ill do i just cant stop thinking, like i think about it legit every second of my life.
it was especially really bad around 3rd grade when i had a crush on some dude and i was like super obsessed with him even though there were times we didnt talk or see each other my mind was just so clung onto him. this lasted for more than 4 years (i really wasted my childhood on that boy).
i also have pretty bad intrusion thoughts i guess. there were times where thoughts or voices kept telling me to do something to the point it made me extremely uncomfortable and i hated myself for it for example, i was talking to my sisters councillor or something and he had a coffee cup on the table, something in my head kept telling me to spill that cup all over and i couldnt stop it from telling me. 
it feels like i have a virus in my head and i need to get rid of it, like a little person in my brain just sabotaging my thoughts and who i am.
whenever i have conflict with someone the first things i think of is completely cutting them out of my life and villainising them for a period of time but of course i’ll always regret doing that or thinking to ever do that afterwards, i dont know why im so impulsive. another thought is that they might kill me, again i dont know why but in the moment it feels so believable like i will feel uncomfortable and disturbed.
sometimes i can be a little superstitious which causes me to be a little paranoid. sometimes ill think something really bad will happen to me if a black cat walks by, sometimes i think god or the devil is sending me signs or is messing with me. i’ll literally get a bad feeling over anything and i feel so overdramatic.

i have trouble trusting people even if they are really close or if i ask them for help there will be a lingering thought and feeling that they are lying to me or setting me up. i feel so guilty because i dont want my friends to think i see them as dumb and i hate doubting them but sometimes ill double check if what they are telling me are facts, i think ill always take things as a grain of salt.

this one time i had a fight with my brother which put me in a really weird mental state that i didnt even recognise myself, everything felt so unreal. i was on a walk trying to collect my thoughts but everything felt so fake, i kept looking at my hands and my mind started changing and believing odd things, i wanted to call one of my close friends to talk to her but my mind was telling me that she actually hated me, hated that i vent to her and thinks im only friends with her to talk about myself (all isnt true about my friend). it got dark quickly and i decided to chill at this park that was pretty far from home where i was alone, it was nearly pitch black and probably dangerous. if i was in my normal state i wouldve been a wee bit scared but i literally didnt care if someone took me or attacked me, wasnt scared at all at the time. it was a really weird mental state i experienced bc i didnt feel like myself at all i kelt thinking “this cant be my life” over and over again, i kind of experienced episodes like that but it was never as severe.

i dont think ive hallucinated or actually have voices in my head, hell i dont even know if theres really anything wrong with me but ive kinda mentioned some of these problems to my friends and they said it wasnt really normal. going to a professional and getting an actual diagnosis is too much so i dont think ill ever go to one.

but yeah, my mind is so overwhelming i cant stop thinking, theres thoughts overlapping other thoughts i cant stop thinking. i guess yourself is your own greatest enemy.

I’m entering my thesis and dissertation era soon and I could really use your advice on a new laptop.

I’m currently using a 2019 MacBook Air (Intel), and it’s seems like it's been showing its age, like it really slows down when I have Zoom or MS Teams running alongside MS Office apps, Jamovi (for stats), zotero and Chrome with multiple tabs (including canva). It’s manageable, but pretty frustrating when multitasking during online classes or research sessions.

So now I’m considering upgrading and torn between sticking with a newer MacBook (probably M2/M3 Air or Pro) or switching to a high-spec ThinkPad (like the X1 Carbon, T-series or E-series). I’d love to hear your thoughts, especially if you’ve used either for heavy academic workloads.

Some things I value:

Long battery life

Comfortable typing (I'll be writing a lot)

Quiet and cool performance under load

Good support for apps like MS Office, Jamovi, Zotero, reference managers, maybe some light SPSS or RStudio

Occasional light photo and video editing via iMovie and Final Cut pro

Durability and portability (I'll be studying at home, campus, and coffee shops)


Any recommendations or personal experiences? Would an M-series MacBook crush this workflow better than a Windows machine? Or is a ThinkPad still the go-to workhorse for researchers?

1l9fkq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/OALangBaAko/comments/1l9fkq4/oa_lang_ba_ako_or_mahal_niya_pa_talaga_yung_ex_nya/,OA lang ba ako or mahal niya pa talaga yung ex nya?,"Before pa kami maging kami ni bf, naging friends kami saglit. So alam ko yung mga past flings nya, naka apat rin siya. But one girl in particular, they lasted 4 months in a situationship daw tapos sabi nya dun na sana siya ready mag commit, but hindi raw natuloy kasi naging busy na si ate girl, and eventually parang unspoken na lang na wala na. June sila nag end pero matagal rin siya nag move on. Sabi niya,nitong November, 2024 lang. Kaya siguro unconsciously, medyo may doubt pako. Kasi mag feb palang nung nagkakilala kami. Pero ayun nga, that time na we're friends, January, mutuals pa sila sa IG. Inunfollow naman niya nung nakita ko kasi nung may something na samin parang na ask ko ano ba name nonn tas ayun kita ko nasa ig nya pa lol. Edi ayun, it started there. 

As a person na sobrang curious talaga, di ko napigilang icheck/istalk. Nakita ko mga lumang reposts, comments, kwento, style, vibe… lahat. Oo na, stalker kung stalker. Pero curious lang talaga ako. I wanted to know what kind of person she was to him. and vice versa.

And at first, hindi ko naman inisip na may mali. Tho I admit na minsan may retroactive jealousy talaga ko and napapagawayan namin. Nakailan din kaming away. Nung mga unang away, he'll reassure me, pero minsan I feel like it wasn't enough kaya nag sspiral parin utak ko sa nga next time. So nung mga madalas na namin napapagawayan yon, I understand if he gets tired to explain na so I accepted na maybe baka ako lang talaga yung mali. So I did my best na not to open that up kasi nung naging kami naman, he was honest sa story nila ni girl. pinakilala ako sa friends niya, binlock si girl, binigay accounts niya, and never ko naman siya nahuling nagtatago ng kung ano. And never naman siya nagkwento sa ex niya unless tinanong ko. Kaya dapat, okay lang ako, ‘di ba? 

Pero minsan, may mga maliliit na bagay parin na paulit-ulit na lang nagti-trigger ng thoughts ko.

Like one time, bigla niya akong tinanong, habanag naglalakad kami sa coffee shop, then we saw posters nagask sha ng “Favorite mo matcha diba?” Nagalit ako non, inopen ko sakanya na kelan ko pa naging fave yon?then he explained na ganun lang daw talaga siya mjnsan parang pag distracted siya napaptanong siya nang ganon esp na din sa mga nakikita sa paligid. Pero napaisip ako talaga kasi matcha was the ex thing, hindi akin. Tapos minsan, nagbobond kami with my friend and my friend blurted out na nasa Spotify wrapped nya daw si hev abi. Then HE he said sakin na, ""fave mo yun diba?""And I was like WHAT. Pero ganon din—isa yun sa hilig nung girl. Again, inopen ko yun after nang ilang days tas sabi niya na parang pang asar lang daw niya cuz he's tripping kasi parang ganun mga tugtugan ng mga batang genggeng etc. May ganon din na instances sa BLACKPINK, saw their standee kasi tapos inask nya din yon. 

Pero all that, I let it pass. Kasi may explanation naman siya. Pero habang tumatagal, parang andaming ganong tanong na akala mo harmless, pero sa utak ko parang may thread na bumabalik palagi sa kanya.

Pakiramdam ko kasi hindi pa siya over sa girl. Minsan feeling ko na nagsta-stalk pa rin siya behind my back or napapatingin siya sa mga kamukha. Usual kasi yung look ni ex like usually naka bun + eyeglasses kaya parang everywhere may trigger.

Pero for the sake of our relationship, inisip ko na baka hyperfocus lang talaga ko kaya lahat nakokonek ko. So I did my best not to make everything about her. And so umokay namannn. But this day, nag open uli ako ng Fb, tapos naopen ko uli dump acc ko na ginagamit ko for stalking tas nag pop name ni ex sa search bar, naisip ko siya istalk uli para lang ma test feeling ko if may mafifeel paba ko, fortunately, wala naman NOT UNTIL I SAW THAT SPECIFIC PIC. 

It's a pic of the girl from 2022. I know medyo anlayo pero sa albums kasi ako nag check. Naalala ko rin kasi sabi ni bf stalker siya kapag gusto niya tao so nastalk nya na lahat yan if gusto nya yung tao. So that pic, naka peace sign si girl,and has this specific na pose and posture. 

For context, kasi may specific pose na laging ginagawa ni bf sa harap ko kapag nagpapacute siya, yung nagpapatawa, nagpe-peace sign, pa-charming ganon. Sobrang distinct. Tapos habang nag-check ako ng luma sa album, BOOM. Si girl. 2022 pic. Same exact pose. As in na-recognize ko agad in one second. Kasi alam ko ‘yun, yun yung pose na ginagawa ni bf. Sabi niya non sakin na paranf ginagaya niya lang raw old pic ko non pero alam ko sa sarili ko na never ko namang ginawa yung pose na yon. Diko lang pinapansin nung simula but ngayon, I think it's making sense WTF. 


So rn, I couldn’t help but think, all the time he's with me, is it really me he’s thinking of? Or are there moments where he still has her in mind?

I keep gaslighting myself na baka ako lang ‘to. Baka I’m just too observant or over lang sa pag analyze plus my retroactive jealousy.

Pero honestly? It’s not even about the girl anymore. It’s not even jealousy.
It’s just this one fear I can’t shake off.

Ayoko ng feeling na ginagamit or ginamit lang ako para makalimot.
Na baka kaya niya ako pinili is not because he chose me, but because she didn’t choose him. Na baka all this time when he's with me, he's still thinking about her. OA LANG BA KO OR MAHAL NYA PA EX NYA?",2,1749710284.0,OALangBaAko,1,1.0,False

I blinked rapidly, trying to focus.","After knowing the truth, he regretted deeply...

Congratulations,"" Dr. Ray said with a gentle smile, ""you're pregnant.""

I blinked rapidly, trying to focus. Her smile never wavered as she guided my attention to the screen, pointing to two tiny dots pulsing in sync.

“Twins,” she added. “You’re having twins.”

Twins? I couldn't even grasp the reality of being pregnant. I had been so careful—so cautious. The pills Kyle had insisted I take every single day were supposed to prevent this. We had a contract—one that explicitly forbade a pregnancy. That was the deal, after all.

“I… I’ve been taking the pills,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper. My hands shook, and I placed them on the edge of the examination table, trying to steady myself.

Dr. Ray glanced at me with a slight frown. “Are you sure you've been consistent?”

I hesitated, unsure. My memory was hazy. There had been moments when I had been distracted. “I…” My voice cracked, and I shook my head. “I’m not sure.”

Dr. Ray’s looked at me with concern. “Don’t you want your baby?”

“No,” I murmured. “I didn’t think I could get pregnant.”

She helped me wipe the cool gel from my stomach. ""Well, what matters now is ensuring your health and the babies' health. I must warn you though,"" her expression grew serious, ""your uterus condition requires extra attention. You'll need proper nutrition, regular rest, and frequent check-ups.""

I nodded mechanically, my hand drifting to my still-flat stomach. Two lives. Two tiny beings growing inside me. Kyle's children. Our children.

My hands gripped the steering wheel as I tried to breathe. The drive home was a blur. I kept thinking about the contract's words.

Clause 6 - Regular contraception required.

No pregnancies permitted. The terms of our marriage were clear, clinical, like everything else about our relationship. I should not get myself pregnant as my entire life was built on pretending to be his wife while the world—and he—saw me only as a secretary.

I pulled into our driveway, staying in the car. Marriage was supposed to be about love, trust, and building a life together. But when your husband saw it as merely a business arrangement, those dreams become nothing more than wishful thinking. Kyle had made that crystal clear from the beginning.

""This is a deal,"" he'd said, sliding the contract across his mahogany desk. ""I hope you don't have any other ideas."" But I did have other ideas. I had love - years of it, carefully hidden love. So I'd signed, clinging to the hope that maybe, just maybe, time would help him see me differently.

Three years later, that hope had proven as substantial as morning mist. Our relationship existed primarily in the darkness of our bedroom, mechanical and devoid of emotion. During daylight hours, I was just another employee at K.T. Enterprises, our marriage a secret known only to Linda, his personal assistant.

When I arrived home, I moved mechanically, my hands trembling as I prepared a quick meal. Maybe it was just my nerves, but I felt hungrier than usual. I allowed myself to eat more, knowing I needed to maintain my strength.

After eating, I took a shower quickly. Standing in front of the mirror, I stared at my reflection. My body hadn't changed yet—not visibly, anyway. My stomach was still flat, no sign of the growing life inside me. But the reality of it was there, and the idea of two little beings growing inside me made my heart race. Would they look like me? Would they have my green eyes? Or would they inherit their father's dark, stormy gaze?

I couldn’t help but wonder about them. What this pregnancy would mean for our future? Would they bring hope? Or just more disappointment?

When I finished getting dressed, I settled on the couch, waiting for Kyle to return. I wasn’t sure how long I had been sitting there. My mind raced, playing out every possible scenario in which I would break the news to him. The evening stretched endlessly. My hand kept returning to my stomach, trying to forge a connection with the tiny lives within. But Kyle was late today. The minutes dragged on, stretching into hours until I finally started to doze off.

I awoke to familiar hands on my skin, and my heart rate immediately spiked.

When I wake up, I'm already in bed, and Kyle has already taken off my clothes. “Kyle, you're home,” I feel nervous, and my lower abdomen twitches slightly.

""You missed work today,"" he murmured against my neck, his breath warm. His lips brushed, a quick, possessive gesture, before he bit me lightly. I gasped, my body tensed.“You didn't go to work today.”

“I didn't feel well, so Linda and I took the day off.”

Kyle's tongue slipped into my mouth. I realized what he was going to do, but not today. I turned my face away. ""Kyle,"" I looked up at his handsome face. He had the kind of cheekbones a sculptor would create, and his jawline would never stop. His eyes were the most amazing shade of grey, and at the moment they were full of lust.

""Open your legs,"" he said. His hard part was already against my entrance.

""No, Kyle. Not today.” He stopped.

He pulled back, his grey eyes darkening. ""Why?""

""My stomach's upset,"" I said, the partial truth bitter on my tongue.

The warmth in his expression frosted over instantly. He stood, wrapping his robe around himself as he headed for the bathroom. ""Make sure you see John about it,"" he called over his shoulder. John was our personal physician. I would never go to him for a pregnancy test. I bit my lip.

""Kyle, there's something I want to tell you."" I began, but my words were drowned out by the sound of running water.

I sat up slowly, deciding to wait for him to finish his shower. That's when his phone lit up on the nightstand. A message notification caught my eye. Despite myself, I looked.

The name made my blood run cold: Taylor.

""I miss you, babe. Come see me on Thursday.""

I was familiar with the name. Everyone who worked at K.T. was probably familiar with it. Kyle Branson had built the most legendary company in ten years. This seemingly cold and rational man named his business after him and the woman he loved the most. Their initials as K.T. Enterprises. A constant reminder of the woman he truly loved, emblazoned across every building, every document, every paycheck.

I may know Taylor a little better than others because she is my younger stepsister.

Then his phone rang again, calling from Taylor.

Chapter 2 The Other Woman

Mia's POV

Kyle walked out of the bathroom. I quickly turned away from his phone, my heart pounding. He picked up the device and left the bedroom without a word to me. The door clicked shut behind him.

I pulled my knees to my chest, wrapping my arms around them. Even through the closed door, I could hear the low murmur of his voice. He always spoke to her in that gentle tone. That is a tone I'd never heard him use with me.

I pressed my face against my knees, trying to hold back my tears. My hand moved unconsciously to my stomach. What would Taylor say if she knew I was carrying Kyle's babies? My stepsister had already taken so much from me. My father, my home, my inheritance - and now she wanted Kyle back.

The memories came flooding back, making me feel sick. I was fifteen when my mother died. Cancer took her quickly, leaving me alone with my father. I thought he would be there for me. I was wrong.

A week after Mom's funeral, he brought home his new wife and her daughter Taylor. That's when my whole world fell apart. That's when I learned the painful truth. Dad had been seeing them behind Mom's back for years. He'd only married my mother for her money. Taylor's mother had been his true love all along.

I got up from the bed, needing to move. The bedroom suddenly felt small and suffocating. I walked to the window, pressing my forehead against the cool glass. Outside, the city lights twinkled like nothing was wrong.

The sound of Kyle's voice grew louder as he walked past the bedroom door. ""Thursday works perfectly. I'll make reservations at your favorite restaurant.""

My fingers curled against the glass. Thursday. He was planning a date with her while I stood here carrying his children. Children he didn't want. Children that violated our contract.

I remembered the day Taylor first came to our house. She was thirteen, two years younger than me, but she acted like she owned the place. Maybe she did. Within days, my father had moved all of Mom's things to the attic. Within weeks, he'd redecorated the entire house to Taylor's mother's taste. It was like Mom had never existed.

""You're just like your mother,"" Taylor would say to me at school, her voice dripping with contempt. ""Always in the way. Always trying to hold onto things that don't belong to you.""

The bathroom door opened, and Kyle walked back in. I quickly wiped my eyes, but I couldn't hide how pale I was. My reflection in the window showed a ghost of a woman.

""You look sick,"" Kyle said, his voice cool and detached. So different from how he'd spoken to Taylor moments ago. ""Go see a doctor tomorrow.""

I turned to face him, wrapping my arms around myself. ""Would you speak to Taylor like this?"" The words slipped out before I could stop them.

Kyle's expression hardened. ""You shouldn't mention that name. And don't compare yourself to her.""

His words hit me like a physical blow. Of course. How could I forget? I was just the backup plan. The convenient wife who stayed in the shadows while he pursued his true love.

""You're right,"" I said, my voice trembling. ""I'm not worthy. I'm just the girl you married because your board of directors insisted you needed a stable image. I'm just your secretary who pretends to be your wife.""

Kyle's jaw tightened. "" We had an agreement, Mia. You knew what this was from the start. Don't try to make it something it's not.""

I laughed, but it sounded more like a sob. ""A contract. That's all our marriage is to you, isn't it? Just another business deal.

""Yes,"" he said coldly. ""That's exactly what it is. Make sure you stick to that.""

My hand instinctively moved to my stomach before I caught myself. But Kyle had already turned away, heading for the door. ""I have an early meeting tomorrow. Don't wait up.""

The door closed behind him with a final click. I sank onto the bed, my legs no longer able to hold me up. The tears I'd been holding back finally spilled over.

How had I ended up here? When did I become this pathetic woman who accepted crumbs of attention from a man who loved someone else? Someone who happened to be the same person who had made my teenage years a total misery?

I remembered the first time I saw Kyle. It was at a high school party - one I wasn't supposed to be at. Taylor had made sure I knew I wasn't welcome, but I went anyway. Kyle was there with his friends, tall and handsome in his football jersey. He only had eyes for Taylor.

Everyone knew they were the perfect couple. Kyle Branson, the star quarterback from the wealthy family. Taylor Matthews, the beautiful cheerleader with the perfect life. And me? I was just the awkward stepsister who didn't belong anywhere.

But I fell for him anyway. Quietly, hopelessly, I fell in love with Kyle. Even after high school, when I got the job as his secretary at K.T. Enterprises, my feelings didn't change. If anything, they grew stronger.

Then came the scandal. Kyle's reputation was at risk, and the board insisted he needed to clean up his image. He needed a wife - someone quiet, someone who wouldn't cause problems. Someone who would sign a contract and stay in the shadows.

I was the perfect candidate. The quiet secretary who already knew how to be invisible. The girl who loved him enough to accept any terms, just to be near him.

Now here I was, three years later, carrying his twins while he planned dates with my stepsister.

I got up and walked to my purse, pulling out the ultrasound picture. In the darkness of the room, I could barely make out the two tiny dots that would change everything. My babies. Our babies. Even if Kyle never loved me, even if this pregnancy violated our contract, I couldn't give them up.

Tomorrow, I would have to go back to work. I would have to sit at my desk and pretend everything was normal. I would have to watch Kyle and Taylor together, knowing I carried his children under my heart.

As I lay in bed, one hand resting protectively over my stomach, I made a decision. I wouldn't tell Kyle about the pregnancy. Not yet. Not until I figured out what to do. These babies were mine. They are the only real thing in this fake marriage. And I would protect them, no matter what it cost me.

The sound of Kyle's car starting in the driveway made me flinch. He was leaving, probably heading to his penthouse apartment downtown. The one where he stayed when he didn't want to play house with his contract wife.

I curled up tighter under the blankets, trying to find warmth in the empty bed.

Tomorrow would be another day of being the invisible wife. But tonight, in the darkness of our bedroom, I allowed myself to cry for everything I might lose when the truth finally came out.

Chapter 3 Make Waves

Mia's POV

The morning sickness hit me as soon as I woke up. I barely made it to the bathroom in time. Dark circles under my eyes. Pale skin. I had to look better than this. I couldn't let anyone at work suspect anything.

Linda was waiting for me when I arrived at the office. ""Are you feeling better?""

""Yes, much better."" I forced a smile. Linda watched me carefully, but didn't push.

Linda’s expression as neutral as ever, holding out two cups of coffee. “He asked for these,” she murmured, her tone professional, yet I could sense a hint of pity in her eyes.

My stomach churned at the thought of coffee, but I nodded. ""Sure.""

I balanced the two cups carefully. Two cups. My heart sank. I already knew who the second one was for.

When I pushed open Kyle's office door, Taylor was perched on the edge of his desk. She wore a tight red dress that probably cost more than my monthly salary. Her perfectly manicured hand rested on Kyle's shoulder.

""Oh, look who it is,"" Taylor's voice dripped honey. ""How nice to see you, Mia.""

I set the cups down carefully, trying not to let my hands shake. ""Your coffee, Mr. Branson.""

""That's not how I like my coffee,"" Taylor pouted. She picked up the cup and took a sip. ""Too much sugar. Be a dear and get me another one.""

I clenched my fists. ""I didn't make the coffee, Miss Matthews. Perhaps you should specify your preferences to the coffee shop directly.""

Taylor's eyes narrowed for a moment before she laughed. ""Oh, Kyle, isn't she adorable? So defensive over a cup of coffee."" She turned to me, her smile never reaching her eyes. ""You know, Mia, attitude like that is probably why you're still just a secretary.""

Kyle didn't even look up from his computer. ""That will be all, Mia.""

I turned to leave, but Taylor wasn't done. ""Actually, Mia, wait."" She stood up, smoothing her dress. ""Could you show me to the ladies' room? This building is so big, I always get lost.""

I knew it was a trap. But with Kyle sitting right there, I couldn't refuse. ""Of course.""

The moment we entered the bathroom, Taylor's sweet facade dropped. She checked every stall before turning to me, her eyes cold.

""I know what you're doing,"" she hissed. ""Playing the perfect employee, always so helpful, so eager to please. Everyone knows you’ve always been desperate for any scrap of attention. You’re just like your mother—always looking for something that isn’t yours""

My hands trembled. ""Don't talk about my mother.""

""Why not? Everyone knew what she was - a gold-digger who trapped my father with her money. And now look at you, following in her footsteps.""

""That's not true."" My voice shook. ""My mother loved Dad. She didn't know—""

""She didn't know he was already in love with my mom?"" Taylor laughed. ""Please. She knew exactly what she was doing. Just like you know exactly what you're doing with Kyle.""

""I don't know what you're talking about.""

Taylor stepped closer. ""Don't play innocent. I've seen how you look at him. How you've always looked at him. It's pathetic, really. Do you think he'll ever see you as anything more than what you are? A convenient employee he can use?""

""Stop it."" My stomach churned. Whether from morning sickness or stress, I wasn't sure.

""You know what's funny?"" Taylor continued. ""Kyle tells me everything. About his little arrangement. About how the board forced him to find a wife quickly after that scandal. And guess who was there, so eager to sign whatever contract he put in front of her?""

I felt the blood drain from my face. Kyle had told her about our marriage?

""Oh, don't worry,"" Taylor smirked. ""Your secret is safe with me. It's too amusing to spoil. Kyle's fake wife, pining away while he spends his nights with me.""

""You're lying."" But my voice sounded weak even to my own ears.

""Am I? Where do you think he goes when he's not at your little love nest? Who do you think he's with?"" She pulled out her phone, scrolling through photos. ""Look. Last night, after he left you. And the night before that.""

The photos showed Kyle and Taylor at various restaurants, clubs, looking intimate. Happy. Real.

""Stop."" My voice cracked.

""You'll never be anything to him, Mia. I have told you, you're just like your mother, trying to hold onto things that don't belong to you. But you should remember what your mom got. ""

Something in me snapped. I couldn't take it anymore.

The slap echoed in the tiled bathroom. Anger flared inside me, and before I could think, my hand flew up, landing a hard slap across her face. The sharp sound echoed in the empty hallway.

Taylor's head snapped to the side. For a moment, there was absolute silence. Then she started to smile.

""Oh, Mia,"" she said softly. ""You shouldn't have done that.""

She grabbed her own arm and squeezed hard, leaving red marks. Then she messed up her hair slightly and let tears fill her eyes.

The bathroom door burst open. Kyle stood there, his face dark with anger.

""Kyle!"" Taylor sobbed, running to him. ""I don't know what happened! I was just trying to be friendly, and she attacked me!""

""She's lying!"" I said. ""Kyle, she—""

""I saw enough,"" Kyle cut me off. His voice was ice cold. ""Taylor, are you alright?""

She buried her face in his chest, her shoulders shaking with perfectly timed sobs. ""I just wanted to talk to her. To try and be friends. I know our past is complicated, but...""

Kyle wrapped his arms around her protectively. The sight made me feel sick.

""Please,"" I whispered. ""Kyle, let me explain.""

Taylor touched her cheek, her expression shifting instantly to one of hurt innocence. “Kyle, I… I didn’t mean to upset her,” she said, her voice soft, pleading. “Please, don’t be angry with her.”

Kyle’s gaze was cold as he looked at me. “Apologize, Mia,” he ordered, his tone hard.

I met his gaze, refusing to back down, my heart breaking anew. “No,” I whispered, my voice barely audible. “I won’t apologize.”

Kyle’s jaw tightened, and for a moment, I thought I saw something in his eyes—disappointment, maybe, or frustration. But it vanished as quickly as it appeared.

“Fine,” he said coldly. “You’re suspended. I’ll let Linda handle your work until further notice.”

The words were a knife in my heart, but I lifted my chin, refusing to let him see how much they hurt. “Understood.”

I walked away without another word, my heart aching, feeling like I had left a piece of myself behind.

Chapter 4 A New Job

Mia's POV

I sat in the dark living room, watching the hours tick by. The house felt emptier than usual. Kyle hadn't come home since the incident at the office three days ago. I knew he was punishing me, but I still waited.

The clock struck midnight. Then one. Then two. No Kyle.

My phone buzzed, startling me. A message from an old college friend lit up my screen.

""Hey stranger! Long time no see. Coffee tomorrow?""

Jeo Parker. I hadn't heard from him in ages. Back in college, we'd spent countless hours together in the art studio. He'd always believed in my talent, even when I didn't.

I hesitated before replying. A coffee wouldn't hurt, would it?

""Sure. Where?""

The next morning, I found myself at a quiet café downtown. Jeo was already there, his familiar smile warming the room. He stood when he saw me, and I was struck by how well time had treated him. His dark hair was stylishly messy, his blue eyes as kind as I remembered.

""Mia Williams,"" he said, pulling me into a gentle hug. ""Still as beautiful as ever.""

I blushed, unused to such open affection. ""You look good too, Jeo.""

""I ordered you hot chocolate instead of coffee,"" he said as we sat down. ""You never could stomach coffee in the morning.""

The simple fact that he remembered made my throat tight. When was the last time someone had noticed such a small detail about me?

""So,"" he began, ""I heard you're working at K.T. Enterprises?""

I nodded, stirring my hot chocolate. ""In HR.""

""Really?"" His eyebrows rose. ""The girl who painted that incredible mural in the university hall ended up in HR?""

""Things change,"" I said softly.

""They don't have to."" He leaned forward. ""That's actually why I wanted to meet. My design firm just landed a huge project. We're looking for fresh talent, and I immediately thought of you.""

""Me?""

""Don't act surprised, Mia. You were always the most talented girl . Remember that scholarship you turned down?""

I did remember. It had been right after Kyle hired me as his secretary. I'd convinced myself that being close to him was more important than pursuing my dreams.

""I don't know, Jeo. It's been years since I've drawn anything.""

""Just come see the studio,"" he pleaded. ""No pressure. Just look around.""

His enthusiasm was infectious. For the first time in days, I felt myself smiling. ""Maybe I could—""

""Mia.""

That voice. My smile froze.

Kyle stood at our table, his expression unreadable. He wore a crisp black suit. He looked perfect, untouchable.

""Mr. Branson,"" I said automatically, my voice small.

Jeo stood, extending his hand. ""Kyle Branson? I'm Jeo Parker. I went to college with Mia.""

Kyle ignored his hand. His eyes were fixed on me. ""A word, Mia.""

It wasn't a request. I stood shakily, avoiding Jeo's concerned look.

""Mia,"" Jeo called after me. ""Think about what I said, okay?""

Kyle's jaw tightened. He led me outside, his hand on my elbow. His touch burned through my sleeve.

""Who is he?"" Kyle's voice was low, dangerous.

""Just an old friend.""

""Friends don't look at each other that way.""

I pulled my arm away. ""What way? The way you look at Taylor?""

His eyes flashed. ""That's different.""

""How? How is it different, Kyle?""

""Because you signed a contract."" He stepped closer, crowding me against the wall. ""You agreed to certain terms. No relationships with other men during our marriage.""

I laughed bitterly. ""Our marriage? Is that what you call this arrangement?""

""It's still legally binding."" His breath fanned across my face. ""Or have you forgotten?""

""No,"" I whispered. ""I haven't forgotten anything. Including where you've been the past three days.""

Something flickered in his eyes. Guilt? Anger? I couldn't tell anymore.

""What I do is none of your concern.""

""But what I do is your concern?"" I challenged. ""That's not fair, Kyle.""

""Life isn't fair."" He straightened his tie. ""Remember our agreement, Mia. Don't make me remind you again.""

He turned to leave, then paused. ""And tell your friend to stop wasting his time. You're not available.""

""He's offering me a job,"" I said to his back.

Kyle stopped. Turned slowly. ""What?""

""A job. At his design firm."" I lifted my chin. ""I used to paint, before...""

""Before what?""

""Before I became your secretary."" The words tasted bitter. ""Before I signed your contract.""

Kyle's expression darkened. ""You're not considering it.""

""Why not? You've suspended me anyway.""

""Temporarily."" He stepped closer again. ""You're my wife, Mia.""

""Your wife?"" I met his gaze. ""Because it seems like I'm only your wife when it's convenient for you. When you need to show the board how stable you are. When you need someone to warm your bed.""

His hands clenched into fists. ""That's not true.""

""Then where were you these past three days, Kyle? With Taylor?""

Kyle grabbed my wrist, not hard enough to hurt, but firm. ""You knew what this was from the beginning. Don't act like I deceived you.""

""No,"" I whispered. ""I deceived myself. I thought maybe... maybe if I was patient enough, kind enough, if I followed all your rules..."" I snatched my wrist. ""But I was wrong, wasn't I?""

Something flickered in his eyes. ""Mia...""

""You don't get to control every aspect of my life, Kyle. Not anymore.""

""The contract—""

""The contract says I can't have relationships with other men. It doesn't say anything about taking a job."" I straightened my spine. ""Unless you're jealous?""

His laugh was harsh. ""Jealous? Of him? Don't be ridiculous.""

""Then there's no problem, is there?""

We stood there, staring at each other. For a moment, I thought I saw something in his eyes. But then his mask slipped back into place.

""Fine,"" he said coldly. ""Take the job. But remember your place, Mia. You're still my wife.""

""No, Kyle. I'm your employee who happens to have signed a marriage contract. There's a difference.""

""We'll discuss this at home,"" he said finally. Without another word, he turned and walked away. This time, I let him go.

My phone buzzed with a message from Jeo.

""Are you okay? Want to finish our conversation about the job?""

I stared at the message for a long time. And I typed back: ""Tell me more about the position.""

Chapter 5 Unwanted Feelings

Kyle's POV

I couldn't focus on work. The image of Mia with that man kept playing in my mind. Jeo Parker. Even his name irritated me.

""Linda,"" I called through the intercom. ""Get me everything you can find on Jeo Parker.""

""The designer?"" Linda's voice was carefully neutral. ""Right away, sir.""

I loosened my tie. The office felt too hot. What would Mia be doing at his design firm? Would she be alone with him? Would they work late together? Artists do that sort of thing, don't they?

The thought of them in his studio made my jaw clench. Would he teach her how to hold a brush? Would his hands touch hers? Would they work on portraits? Would she pose for him?

I yanked my tie completely off. The images wouldn't stop. Mia smiling at him the way she used to smile at me. Mia staying late at his studio. Mia letting him get too close.

""Stop it,"" I muttered, pouring myself a drink. This was purely professional concern. Nothing more. Mia was my wife. On paper, at least. I had a right to know about her work environment.

Linda knocked and entered with a thick file. ""Jeo Parker's background, sir.""

I flipped through it, my frown deepening with each page. Award-winning independent designer. Guest lecturer at prestigious art schools. His work had been featured in major galleries across Europe. Forbes' 30 Under 30. Private commissions from celebrities and royalty.

Something uncomfortable settled in my stomach. ""Find out more about his personal life.""

Linda hesitated. ""Sir?""

""Is he married? Dating anyone?""

""I'll check."" She paused. ""There's something else you should know.""

I looked up.

""Miss Williams was an art major in college. She had a full scholarship offer to Paris.""

I stared at her. ""What?""

""She turned it down when you hired her as your secretary."" Linda's voice was careful. ""Her professors said she was exceptionally talented.""

The uncomfortable feeling in my stomach grew. Why hadn't I known this? Had I ever asked Mia about her interests? Her dreams?

""Should I look into acquiring his company?"" I asked abruptly.

Linda gave me a long look. ""Is that really what this is about, sir?""

""Get our lawyers to—""

""Mr. Branson,"" Linda interrupted, something she rarely did. ""Maybe you should talk to your wife instead of trying to do something to her colleague's company.""

I dismissed her with a wave. My phone buzzed. Taylor. I ignored it.

Taylor. She used to mean everything to me. Now... now her calls felt like interruptions. When had that changed?

I drove home early, something I never did. The house was quiet when I entered. Mia was in the living room, sketching something in a notebook. She looked up, surprised to see me.

""You're home early.""

I walked over, studying her face. She looked tired. Pale. Was she working too hard? Was she sick? Or was she just excited about her new job with him?

Without thinking, I pulled her up from the couch. She felt small in my arms, familiar. Right. I lowered my head to kiss her.

She turned away suddenly, her hand flying to her mouth. Before I could react, she ran to the bathroom. I heard her retching.

""Mia?"" I followed her, concern overriding my annoyance. ""Are you sick?""

She emerged pale, wiping her mouth. ""I'm fine.""

""You don't look fine."" I reached for her, but she stepped back.

""I won't be your backup plan anymore, Kyle."" Her voice was tired. ""I won't share you with Taylor.""

""This isn't about Taylor."" The thought of Taylor felt distant, unimportant.

""Then what is it about?"" Her green eyes challenged me. ""Why are you really here?""

Because I can't stand the thought of you working with him. Because the idea of another man making you smile makes me want to destroy something. Because— ""Because you're my wife.""

""Your contract wife,"" she corrected bitterly.

I noticed her reaching for something in the bathroom cabinet. A pill bottle. ""What are those?""

""Nothing."" She tried to hide them, but I caught a glimpse of the label.

""You've been taking a lot of pills lately.""

""They're just vitamins."" She clutched the bottle tightly.

""For your new job?"" I couldn't keep the sarcasm from my voice.

""Yes, actually. I need to be healthy."" She tried to move past me.

I blocked her path. ""Tell me about this job.""

""Why? So you can try to stop me from taking it?""

""I want to know what you'll be doing.""

She laughed, but it wasn't a happy sound. ""Now you're interested in what I do? After three years of treating me like your convenient bedroom arrangement?""

Her words stung more than they should have. ""That's not fair.""

""No? When's my birthday, Kyle? What's my favorite color? What did I study in college?"" Her voice cracked. ""You don't know anything about me because you never cared to ask.""

""I know enough.""

""You know what's in our contract. That's all."" She pushed past me. ""I need to get ready for bed.""

""We're not done talking about this job.""

She spun around. ""Yes, we are. You made your choice a long time ago, Kyle. You chose Taylor. Now I'm making my choice.""

""This isn't about Taylor,"" I repeated, my voice hard.

""Then why did you spend the last three days with her?""

Because I was angry. Because I needed to prove I didn't care what you did. Because being with her felt wrong now, and I don't understand why. ""That's none of your business.""

""Exactly."" She smiled sadly. ""Just like my new job is none of yours.""

I watched her walk away, feeling strangely helpless. When had everything become so complicated? This was supposed to be a simple arrangement. A marriage of convenience. Nothing more.

So why did the thought of her working with Jeo Parker make me want to destroy everything he'd built?

My phone buzzed again. Taylor.

For the first time, I didn't want to answer. Instead, I found myself walking to my study, opening my laptop. I typed in the name of the pills I'd seen Mia taking.

Something wasn't right. She was hiding something. And I was going to find out what.

But first, I had another call to make. ""Linda? Find out everything you can about art studios. Working hours. Common practices."" I paused. ""And get me Jeo Parker's complete schedule.""

I had a feeling I wouldn't be sleeping much tonight. The thought of Mia in his studio, spending hours alone with him... No. I wouldn't let that happen.

She was my wife. Contract or not, she belonged with me.

Chapter 6 His Nonchalance

Mia's POV

Linda entered. ""Mrs. Branson called. She wants both of you home for dinner tonight.""

My mother-in-law was the only person who treated our marriage as real, who saw me as more than Kyle's convenient arrangement.

Kyle's jaw tightened. ""Tell her we're busy.""

""I already tried, sir,"" Linda replied, ""She insisted. Said, and I quote, 'Tell my stubborn son that if he doesn't bring my lovely daughter-in-law home for dinner tonight, I'll come to his office myself.'""

""Fine. We'll go."" Kyle said.

The drive to the Branson mansion was silent. I watched the familiar neighborhoods pass by, each getting progressively more exclusive until we reached the tree-lined street where Kyle had grown up. The mansion stood proud and elegant, its windows warmly lit against the darkening sky.

Catherine was waiting at the door, her silver hair perfectly styled, her emerald dress matching her eyes.

""Finally!"" She exclaimed, ""My darlings!""

She embraced me first, holding me tight. Her familiar Chanel No. 5 perfume wrapped around me like a comfort blanket. ""Mia, sweetheart,"" she pulled back, studying my face with motherly concern. ""You look pale. Has my workaholic son been keeping you up too late at the office?""

""Mother,"" Kyle's voice held a warning tone.

""Oh, hush,"" Catherine waved him off, pulling me toward the house. ""Come in, come in. Mrs. Reynolds has outdone herself with dinner tonight.""

The mansion's interior hadn't changed since the last time we visited. Crystal chandeliers cast a warm glow over the antique furniture and family portraits. Everything spoke of old money, tastefully displayed yet comfortable. Catherine had always managed that delicate balance.

Catherine smiled as the first course was served. A delicate mushroom soup that filled the room with an earthy aroma. ""Though I do miss the days when this table was fuller. Remember the Sunday dinners we used to have, Kyle? All your cousins would come...""

""That was a long time ago, Mother,"" Kyle replied.

Catherine sighed, stirring her soup. ""Everything changes, doesn't it? Eva next door just became a grandmother last month. Her daughter had twins."" She looked up at us, her eyes twinkling. ""Speaking of which, when can I expect grandchildren?""

Kyle's fork clattered against his plate. ""Mother—""

""Don't 'mother' me,"" Catherine cut him off. ""You've been married three years. Three years! Do you know how many of my friends are already grandmothers twice over?""

""Work keeps us busy,"" Kyle said.

""Work!"" Catherine's voice dripped. ""Always work with you, Kyle. A woman needs more than a busy husband to be happy. She needs to be loved.""

The word 'loved' hung in the air like a physical presence.

""The company is going through an important phase,"" Kyle said stiffly. ""We can discuss children later.""

Catherine's eyes narrowed. ""That's an excuse and you know it. When I was pregnant with you—""

""Mother, we've discussed this,"" Kyle cut in, his voice sharp. ""My priority right now is expanding the company into international markets. Children would be... inconvenient.""

Inconvenient. The word hit me like a physical blow. My stomach churned violently as the smell of the food suddenly became overwhelming. Black spots danced at the edges of my vision as waves of nausea washed over me.

""May I be excused?"" I interrupted, ""I need some air.""

Catherine's expression softened immediately. ""Of course, dear. Use the garden. The night blooming jasmine is beautiful this time of year.""

I wandered through Catherine's immaculate garden, past perfectly trimmed hedges and blooming flowers, until I reached the stone bench by the fountain.

My hand drifted to my stomach. Inconvenient, Kyle had called the idea of children. What would he say when he discovered these babies?

I closed my eyes, remembering all the times I'd sat in this very spot, dreaming of a future where Kyle would look at me the way he looked at Taylor. Where our marriage would be more than just a contract. Now here I sat, carrying his children, while he still saw me as nothing more than a business arrangement. The irony was almost too much to bear.

""I thought I'd find you here.""

I turned to see Catherine approaching, a cashmere shawl in her hands. She draped it around my shoulders before sitting beside me.

""You always loved this spot,"" she said softly. ""I remember the first time Kyle brought you home. You spent hours here, sketching the flowers.""

""I'm sorry, dear,"" Catherine continued, taking my hand in hers. ""I know my son. I failed him in some ways. After his father died..."" she paused, her voice catching. ""Kyle threw himself into being perfect. Perfect grades, perfect businessman. He forgot how to feel.""

""Catherine, I—""

""Let me finish."" Her grip on my hand tightened. ""You're good for him, Mia. Better than he deserves. I see how you look at him, how much you love him. ""

""Mother."" Kyle's voice cut through the darkness. ""Stop meddling.""

Catherine stood, turning to face her son. ""Take care of your wife, son. Before it's too late.""

The city lights blurred past us as Kyle drove, his knuckles white on the steering wheel. I gathered my courage, trying to find the right words.

""Kyle,"" I said softly, ""what you said at dinner, about children being inconvenient...""

""What about it?"" His voice was cold. ""Family is not my thing. You knew this when you signed the contract.""

My heart sank. Sure. I shouldn't get this idea in my head. I shifted in my seat, trying to find a more comfortable position, when something rolled against my foot.

Reaching down, my fingers touched smooth metal. I picked it up. A lipstick tube – Dior Rouge, the exact shade I'd seen on Taylor's lips countless times at the office. The gold case gleamed mockingly in my palm, and I could smell her signature perfume lingering on it.

Of course. She'd been in his car. Recently. This wasn't some accident. Taylor never left anything to chance. She'd placed it here deliberately, another cruel reminder that she was the one Kyle truly wanted.

""Pull over,"" I whispered, fighting back bile.

""What?""

""Pull over!"" The words came out more forcefully than I intended. ""I need air.""

Kyle's jaw clenched as he pulled to the curb. Without a word, I got out, wrapping my arms around myself in the cool night air. The car engine revved once before he drove away, leaving me alone on the sidewalk.

The city lights blurred as tears filled my eyes. How had my life become this? My head spun, whether from pregnancy or emotion, I couldn't tell.

""Mia?""

Through my tears, I saw a familiar face. Jeo stood there, concern etched across his features. Without hesitation, he shrugged off his leather jacket, draping it over my shoulders.

""You're freezing,"" he said, his hand warm on my arm. ""What are you doing out here alone?""

""I'm fine,"" I tried to say, but the words slurred. The ground seemed to be moving beneath my feet.

""You're not fine."" Jeo's voice grew urgent as I swayed. ""You need a hospital.""

""No, I just need—"" My knees buckled.

""Hospital,"" Jeo decided, catching me before I hit the ground. ""Now.""",1,1749710271.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

I’m Jainam. I sing, drum, and play guitar, sometimes all at once. I’ve put together a one-man music show called Grooovie, and it’s happening on 28th June (this month) in a cozy 50-seater space.

It’s not a typical concert. Think: chaos, melodies, emotions, energy. Some songs will make you laugh. Some might hit harder than you expect. It’s raw, fun, a little weird—but very real.

No need to be a music nerd. Just come if you want to feel something for an hour that’s not your daily scroll or the same Saturday plan.

Details:
• Name: Grooovie
• Time & Date: 28th June, 7-9pm 
• Venue: VARIETEA Vadodara
• Tickets: ₹151
• Link: https://bookmyshow.openinapp.co/5wy1d
• My instagram: https://www.instagram.com/jainam.drums?igsh=MThlaWcydmR1MjFjMA==


It’s honestly priced like a coffee, but might stay in your head longer. Would love for strangers to turn into friends, or at least leave humming. If this sounds remotely interesting, give it a shot. Bring a friend. Or just yourself. Either works.

See you there?

Hi everyone, 22m here. 

I just completed my first sleep study yesterday. It was very confusing and exhausting, and they told me to “expect results in two weeks”.

Personally, I’m far too confused about what happened during my exam to feel comfortable waiting so long for results. Basically, I’ll write my story—and if anyone relates to what happened to me, share yours!

They began the study at 7:45 PM the day before yesterday. I got there with the recommended pillow and blanket (I brought a lightweight sheet because I sleep very hot). I expected to have issues falling asleep that night, but they hooked me up to like 3 different machines, and I fell right asleep. I think I was allowed to sleep at around 10 PM. 

Then they woke me up at around 4:30 AM. They told me everything seemed fine with my breathing during my sleep that night, and they confirmed I entered all the “stages”, so basically I suppose I slept enough to confirm that I entered deep sleep and dream sleep.

This is where it became miserable. At 4:30, they told me I was supposed to stay awake for 2 hours, then I could take a nap. Well, that didn’t happen. I fell asleep way before then. They woke me up. This repeated at least 10 times the first cycle. I was very confused and disoriented every time they woke me up, and I was starting to get frustrated because I could NOT for the life of me stay awake. They told me I could NOT have any caffeine or take my prescription Adderall, which I remember asking for several times. 

The first scheduled nap came around 5:30-6 AM. I slept like a baby, and I still remember all the dreams I had. I was at a school in one dream, then I was at some “backrooms-esque” cul-de-sac with scary looking houses. There were other dreams, too, some sexually explicit, and they woke me up again after apparently 25 minutes had passed, saying that I needed to wake up and keep myself occupied.

The same thing kept happening—where I fell asleep again during the wake period. Apparently, I was trying to watch a video to keep me awake, and they found me asleep after 5 min with my phone on the floor. They had me sit in a chair during these wake periods, and despite this awkward chair I found a way to get really, *really* comfortable. Each time they woke me up, they had to re-attach some wires to my head and face. I was pulling them off accidentally in my sleep. I also remember falling asleep while the nurse was talking to me. He even had to physically shake me awake once.  

This repeated like 5 times, and I remember being woken up like 500 times. I’m not even exaggerating. I don’t even know if I remember every time I was woken up. I just remember the tech or nurse being very frustrated with me. He told me it was PIVOTAL I stay awake. Despite this, I managed to sleep and sleep and sleep. Every so often he would wake me up saying my “nap” was over, and he asked me if I had any dreams. Every time, I told him about the dreams, I remember saying “I was at school”, he re-attached my equipment, and he left. Then he woke me up again and again—saying one of the times “I was the most difficult patient he has ever had.”

I also remember falling asleep one of these times and hearing sounds in my head. I don’t remember exactly what sounds they were, but it was something disconcerting. Like someone going “aaah-“ then silence for a few seconds. Or banging noises, like knocking.

Once it was like 2:30 PM, I was finally allowed to leave. He woke me up and he told me my testing was over, and that I would receive my results in two weeks. I told him “I was going to go home and sleep more”. Embarrassing. He asked me if I would be safe driving. I told him “once I take my Adderall and get coffee downstairs, sure!”

I’m still tired from this second test. It was so, so exhausting. If I hadn’t taken my medicine, I would have most certainly gotten home and slept some more, because I felt so miserable and sleepy.",1,1749709110.0,Narcolepsy,2,1.0,False
