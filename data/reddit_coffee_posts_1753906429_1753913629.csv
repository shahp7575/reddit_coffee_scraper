I have finished high school with an IT course.

  
I don't really mind the job, it can be from working in a coffee shop to retail to Ikea etc etc... I just want to work.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Felix Auger-Aliassime vs. Fabian Marozsan: A Tale of Two Tennis Turtles**

The Canadian Open’s second-round clash between Felix Auger-Aliassime and Fabian Marozsan is a match that could be summed up as “the tortoise and the hare… if the hare had a 63% implied chance of winning and the tortoise occasionally tripped over his own momentum.” Let’s break this down with the precision of a line judge and the humor of a tennis ball bouncing off a clown’s nose.

### Parsing the Odds: Why Felix is the Favorite

The bookmakers are as united as a doubles team here. Across all platforms, **Felix Auger-Aliassime** is the heavy favorite, with decimal odds hovering around **1.54-1.59** (implying a **63-65% chance to win**). **Fabian Marozsan**, meanwhile, is priced at **2.4-2.5** (a **40-41% chance**), which is about the same odds as betting your morning coffee won’t spill.

The spread and totals markets tell a similar story. Auger-Aliassime is favored to win by **2.5-3.5 games**, with most books pegging the total games at **22.5-23.0**. In layman’s terms, this match isn’t expected to be a five-set thriller—it’s more like a three-course meal with no dessert for Marozsan.

### News Digest: Injuries, Form, and the Weight of Expectation

Auger-Aliassime, the 21st seed, is a man of contradictions. He’s won titles in Adelaide and Montpellier but has stumbled at the Australian Open and Wimbledon like a toddler learning to walk. Recently, he and Bianca Andreescu hoisted the Hopman Cup, which is tennis’s version of winning a group project in school—impressive, but not always indicative of individual prowess.

Marozsan, on the other hand, is a player whose consistency is about as reliable as a Wi-Fi signal in a subway tunnel. He’s lost to top-30 players in his last three matches, a streak that makes you wonder if he’s been practicing against AI opponents set to “har

Two years ago I hurt my back pretty badly and had to stop my normal routine. I hit a depression and began to eat all the foods I had not been eating and in excess causing me to go from 180 to 220 pounds. 

This past year I have been weight lifting again and back onto a whole foods only, limited sugar diet. So I do not eat out, I do not buy processed foods. Rarely I will allow myself a treat if my wife made something special. 

I have done higher calories anywhere from 2600 to 2300 calorie daily with 200g or so protein. I have done moderate 2100 then down to 1900 with similar protein. I am currently doing around 1500-1700 calories per day with 180+ or more grams of protein. 

An example eating day may be either a cup of high quality sprouted oats with orgain protein powder (ok i lied I do still consume protein powder which is ofc processed). A tablespoon high quality peanut butter and a cup or less of fruits, mostly berries. I top this with cinnamon, hemp seeds, chia seeds and sometimes sunflower seeds or macadamia nuts or walnuts. 

OR 

I will have 3 eggs, 3 pieces turkey bacon, serving size of cottage cheese or greek yogurt with a bit of honey and fruit. 

I drink a cup of coffee daily, i sweeten with monk fruit / honey. 

Lunch is normally a double scoop high quality whey protein shake with water and milk, creatine, psyllium husk. Ill have a kiwi with it or handful of berries. 

Dinner is a protein which varies, veggies and a starch like rice, sweet potatoes, golden potatoes. 

Dessert if I have it, normally greek yogurt with honey and berries.

It may or may not have been clear enough to many people, although I've not encountered a similar discussion at hand (or at least in such depth), so let's give it a try.

***Disclaimer:***  
This is going to be a big post, and I've tried my best to make it readable. If you don't like reading, don't bother replying with nonsense, troll, or ragebait replies, because I'm just going to ignore them.

***Preface:***  
I have been following the responses from Void Interactive since the launch of the consoles and the latest PC update, and basically ever since I started playing the EA at the end of 2021. Based on everything that’s been said along with how things are falling apart publicly, I think there’s a bigger issue under the hood that goes beyond just bugs or delays. I’m not in their team, but I’ve worked on enough projects (not only gaming) to spot when the foundations are not set properly and there is no intention of setting them.

Here’s what it looks like is happening:

***PART I - “Spaghetti Code”:***  
Kaminsky straight up said they’re dealing with “spaghetti code”. That basically means the game’s systems are so tangled that fixing or changing one thing risks breaking everything else. If they’re rewriting older levels, cleaning up technical debt, and trying to make future changes easier, that means the codebase was never really built to scale. This usually happens when a company starts small, grows fast, and no one worries about re-architecting things along the way. It’s normal with smaller startups (and RoN started as a Kickstarter project), but by the time you’re on consoles and Steam with a big playerbase, you're likely not a startup anymore, and so it becomes a serious problem.

***PART II - The New Update:***  
The last major release clearly broke stuff, and even the developers don’t know how. That’s a massive red flag. QA supposedly tested it, but then “something exploded” between testing and the live build. That only happens if your build pipeline is out of control. It likely means the version QA tested isn’t the same one that got released. That happens when someone makes last-minute commits, or if there’s no system to lock a build before shipping it.

If you can’t trace exactly what code changes are made to production to track bugs, your QA means nothing. And when they say “we don’t know what broke”, that’s the worst-case scenario. You can’t fix what you can’t trace.

***PART III - Censorship and Features Removal:***  
They took out graphic content and/or compressed files on PC because they had to meet console certification and so-called ""parity"", which was not needed on PC to begin with. When asked why they didn’t just split builds between PC and console, Kaminsky basically said ""it’s too complex"" for them. That practically screams that they don’t have proper feature flags (like toggle options) or platform-specific build pipelines.

In 2025, if you’re doing cross-platform development, you need different builds or at least runtime toggles. The fact that they couldn’t do that and just nuked features for everyone, shows their pipeline isn’t built for scale. They seemingly have only one monolithic build for all platforms, which is asking for trouble (this goes back to the “spaghetti code” problem).

***PART IV - Quality Assurance:***  
The QA situation is one of the suspects. Either QA didn’t test the right thing, they tested a different build, or there isn’t a proper QA team at all. And if the developers are testing their own stuff, that’s a huge problem. You need fresh, unbiased eyes. Otherwise, confirmation bias kicks in and stuff slips through. Also, if QA doesn’t have the power to stop a release, what’s the point? It’s just a formality that serves nothing at that point.

***PART V - Management:***  
The prime suspect, like in any other company. People in key positions who have no knowledge of what they're doing or how they should lead their departments, which means that there's only one person who says the last word and his decision is final, or it's a group effort where every morning coffee meeting all the executives agreeing together on the least important things and prioritizing the least important issues RoN is carrying since the 2020 PVP playtest.

That is why the game hasn't been improved nor innovated in meaningful ways since its inception, whereas it was supposed to be a project meant to set a new standard for tactical police games after SWAT 4.

That is why they made us promises they never kept, or removed content that was popular and important to the replayability value of the game, or implemented content and features that were not fully tested, more like added as after thoughts.

That is why they made it clear that it was ""important"" for them to backstab the supporters, and compromise their own vision after almost 10 years - for money.

***Final Words:***  
The big picture I’m seeing is a development team buried under tech debt, no reliable CI/CD pipeline (continuous integration and continuous development), no build traceability, weak or overloaded QA, and platform constraints they can’t fully support. And now they’re trying to fix all that while under pressure from a live playerbase and console expectations. That’s not easy on anybody.

If I were them, I’d stop adding new features entirely for a while, isolate the code that’s still stable, build out proper platform separation, enforce build locking before QA, and get serious about automated testing and version control. Otherwise, every patch will keep breaking random things and no one will know why.

I'm curious what others here think. If you’ve worked in software or game development, or even other projects that are not game-related but has similar consequences, does this sound familiar?",3,1753912992.0,ReadyOrNotGame,0,1.0,False

So this time I am tasting eyes, shapes and perception.

Lucky me! A former client is a private label coffee manufacturer in the Midwest.

After 5 months of tasting ideas, these are the results  AND GUESS WHAT? MY DEAR, WE ARE MORE IRRATIONAL THAN YOU THINK!! Size does matter LOL.

**DO YOU DRINK WITH YOUR EYES?**

YES, you do , I do it, everyone does it.

The cup you use to drink coffee can significantly influence how you perceive its taste. 

This effect is shaped by several factors: the cup's material, shape, color, size, and even its weight and texture.

*\[ disclaimer- this study was done before and my results are equal to the results previously registered\]*

*1. Material*

* Ceramic: Preserves the original flavor of coffee, as it is neutral and does not absorb or impart flavors. It also retains heat well, keeping coffee warmer for longer.
* Glass: Also neutral, but coffee cools faster, which can affect taste perception as temperature changes.
* Stainless Steel: Can sometimes introduce metallic notes, especially if the steel is of low quality or interacts with coffee compounds.
* Plastic: May absorb and retain flavors from previous uses, and can release plastic notes when in contact with hot coffee.

*2. Shape*

* Tulip-Shaped Cups: Enhance aroma and can increase perceived sweetness and acidity.
* Wide Cups: Allow more aroma to escape, making the coffee seem more aromatic and sweeter. The larger surface area also accelerates oxidation, which can soften tannins.
* Narrow or Short Cups: Concentrate aromas and can make the coffee taste more intense or bitter.
* Split-Shaped Cups: Increase perception of sweetness and acidity, but may reduce overall enjoyment for some drinkers.

*3. Color*

* White Cups: Can make coffee taste more intense and bitter.
* Black Cups: Often associated with a fuller body and longer aftertaste.
* Red or Pink Cups: Some studies suggest coffee tastes both richer and more acidic in these colors.
* Clear (Glass) Cups: May increase perceived sweetness.

*4. Size and Headspace*

* Larger Headspace: More room above the coffee allows aromas to collect, enhancing the smell and overall flavor experience.
* Smaller Headspace: Reduces aroma intensity, potentially making the coffee taste less complex.

*5. Weight and Texture*

* Heavier Cups: Can make the aftertaste seem longer and may enhance the perception of the body.
* Cup Texture: A rough texture can increase perceived acidity, while a smooth texture may soften the taste.

>Key Takeaway

The cup you choose—in terms of material, shape, color, size, and even weight—can subtly or dramatically change your coffee’s perceived aroma, sweetness, acidity, bitterness, and overall enjoyment. For the purest flavor, ceramic or glass cups are generally preferred, but experimenting with different cups can reveal new dimensions in your daily brew.

>**Conclusion:**

 I tested other variables like background music, server attire, product titles, and packaging design. The concept was to create different environments to help brands launch products. I was hesitant to believe how easy it was to influence people to pay up to 78% more for something by just changing something as simple as the color of the cup.

Color, smell, packaging, and shape all change perception. For the same reason, the way you present yourself weighs more than you think. People judge you by your clothing, nails, shoes, hair, and smell.

Let's be honest—if you work at Apple, you're not wearing the same clothes as if you work at Hermès. During and after the pandemic, certain concessions were made, but guess what? Not anymore. Etiquette is back.

1mdjrkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/InterestingHerbs/comments/1mdjrkz/best_kratom_for_beginners_2025_edition/,Best Kratom for Beginners (2025 Edition),"If you're just starting out with kratom, welcome. You’ve probably already seen a flood of strain names, vendor options, and conflicting advice. I’ve been in the kratom world since 2016 when they tried to make kratom illegal here in Colorado where I live. I am making this post to explains what’s real and what’s just marketing fluff — this guide is here to help you skip the mistakes most of us made early on.

# Rule #1: Avoid Mega Vendors and Gas Station Kratom

If a vendor is on Amazon, in gas stations, or shows up in every Google ad spot, odds are the quality isn't there.

I've reached out to several of these big-name companies over the years and, unsurprisingly, they’re rarely helpful or transparent. It could be because they deal in such massive quantities that their kratom sits in warehouses getting stale, or maybe because they’ve optimized their supply chains for speed, not quality. Either way, the result is the same: weak product.

I made a post awhile back with photos showing how mega-vendor kratom often looks like dry, gray dust lifeless and overprocessed, compared to the vibrant, fluffy grind you get from smaller, quality-focused sellers. Check it out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vendorsofkratom2/comments/1m2pyxm/i_got_to_know_all_the_best_kratom_vendors/).

Think: gas station coffee vs. a fresh local roast and you get the idea.

# Rule #2: Strains Are Mostly Marketing

Red, green, white, Trainwreck, Elephant... it all sounds like it means something, right? In reality, these labels are mostly there to drive sales.

Traditionally, red, white, and green refer to different drying or fermentation techniques, or the color of the stem and vein. But outside of a few reputable vendors, most of today’s “strains” are based on how the powder looks and not how it was made or how it feels.

The whole explosion of strain names really took off when Western marketing entered the Southeast Asian kratom trade in the early 2000s. Product diversification to drive sales was never a thing in Southeast Asia until westerners realized how valuable kratom was and started to take over the market.

That said, strain names can help you track specific batches you like within the same vendor. Just don’t expect “Green Malay” from one vendor to feel anything like “Green Malay” from another.

Want to go deeper on this? Check out my post: [Debunking Kratom Strains](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vendorsofkratom2/comments/1i7lfyo/debunking_kratom_strains/).

# Rule #3: Use Trusted Vendor Lists

This list is built from community consensus, personal testing, and a ton of shared experience. These vendors care and they often source directly from Southeast Asia, manage their own curing and drying processes, and keep batches fresh.

# Top Picks for Beginners

* [CrispKratom](https://crispkratom.com/product/500g-split/?ref=8) – Always fresh, clean, and consistent. Great service and unbeatable attention to detail. My #1 pick.  
* [Mitraman ](https://mitraman.com/ref/8/)– Solid product, fast shipping, and very transparent with lab results. Highly respected in the Reddit kratom communities. 
* [Bennies Botanicals](https://bennibotanicals.com/product/benni-white-maeng-da/)\- They got so popular so quick that they now do a membership only service in order to control demand. Everyone gets accepted but it usually takes a few days.   
* [Happy Hippo](https://happyhippo.com/ant857) – Pricey, but beginner-friendly and high quality. Big reputation for a reason.  
* [Mount Kratom](https://mountkratom.com/ref/21599) – Trustworthy mid-sized vendor with good consistency.  
* [Kona Kratom](https://konakratom.idevaffiliate.com/246.html) – Easy starter packs and reliable quality.  
* [The Evergreen Tree ](https://theevergreentree.com/ref/211/)– Clean, small-batch kratom with a loyal following. 
* New Dawn – Well-reviewed and always communicative.  
* [Fused Flora](https://fusedflora.com/collections/frontpage?ref=CHRISGUSTAFSON) – Diverse selection and lab-tested transparency.  
* [Harvest Kratom](https://harvestkratom.com/ref/1002/) – Budget-friendly and community-approved.  

# Vendors to Avoid

* [Kraken Kratom](https://krakenkratom.com?acc=43fa7f58b7eac7ac872209342e62e8f1) – Once a favorite, now inconsistent and overpriced. Feels like a corporate kratom brand with no soul.  
* [Golden Monk](https://goldenmonk.com/) – Probably the best of the mega-vendors, but still lightyears behind any of the smaller names listed above.  

# Final Thoughts

Start slow. Don’t overthink strain names. Stick to smaller, respected vendors. Beware of extracts and other derivatives. They’ll spike your tolerance and many report that they ruin the plant.

- **Net Cash from Operating Activities**: $1.93 billion YTD (up from $1.71 billion).
- **Total Assets**: $81.58 billion (down from $88.29 billion at prior year-end).
- **Total Liabilities**: $40.09 billion (up from $38.96 billion).
- **Shareholders' Equity**: $41.36 billion (down from $49.19 billion).
- **Long-Term Debt (including current portion)**: $21.21 billion (up from $19.87 billion).

**Segment Highlights**

- **North America:** Net sales down 3.3% to $4.76 billion in Q2; adjusted operating income down 12.5% to $1.17 billion.
- **International Developed Markets:** Net sales up 1.3% to $897 million; adjusted operating income up 8.2%.
- **Emerging Markets:** Net sales up 4.2% to $698 million; adjusted operating income up 52.3% to $100 million.

**Significant Non-Recurring Items**

- **Goodwill Impairment:** $6.7 billion (Q2), primarily reflecting sustained share price decline and changes in market capitalization. As a result, aggregate goodwill decreased from $28.67 billion at year-end to $22.23 billion.
- **Intangible Asset Impairment:** $2.57 billion in Q2, leading to a $2.2 billion reduction in intangible assets in the first half.
- **Restructuring charges:** Modest at $14 million YTD.
- **Significant losses are largely non-cash in nature due to impairments.**

**Cash Flow & Capital Allocation**

- **Operating activities** provided $1.93 billion in cash YTD.
- **Investing activities** used $1.35 billion, largely due to $1.03 billion in marketable securities purchases and $425 million capital expenditures.
- **Financing activities** used $423 million, which includes $951 million in dividends and $435 million in share repurchases.
- **Dividends:** $0.40/share quarterly dividend maintained.
- **Share repurchases:** 6.88 million shares repurchased in Q2 at an average of ~$29/share.

**Balance Sheet & Liquidity**

- **Cash and cash equivalents:** $1.57 billion at quarter end.
- **No outstanding commercial paper borrowings; $4.0 billion revolver undrawn.**
- **Leverage:** Debt increased following a €600 million note issuance and repayment of €600 million maturities.

**Management Discussion and Outlook**

- **Sales declines** attributed to volume/mix pressures in North America and Developed Markets, partly offset by modest price gains and resilience in Emerging Markets.
    - North America volume/mix down 3.4% in Q2; price was nearly flat (+0.2%).
    - Emerging Markets benefitted from price increases (up 5.2% in Q2), offsetting volume headwinds elsewhere.
- **Gross margins compressed** mainly due to impairments (non-cash) and inflationary pressures, though commodity costs (e.g., tomato products, coffee, cheese) have stabilized.
- **Organic net sales** decrease of 2.0% for Q2 (3.3% YTD), reflecting ongoing consumer demand challenges and competitive pressures.
- **Adjusted operating income** down 7.5% in Q2, with higher supply chain costs, currency fluctuation headwinds, and lower volumes cited.
- **Adjusted EPS** declines due to operating performance and a slightly higher tax rate (effective annual tax rate for 2025 now estimated at 25.8%, compared to 20.7% in 2024).
- **Business transformation** continues, including incremental portfolio focus (divestitures of Russia and Papua New Guinea infant businesses), and an announced agreement to sell the Italy infant nutrition business.
- **Inflation and tariffs** remain notable factors, though management expects mitigating actions can soften impact.

**Risks and Uncertainties**

- **Impairment risk:** The $6.7 billion goodwill and $2.6 billion intangible impairment are tied to sustained share price decline and expectations for future cash flows. If cash flow projections or discount rates worsen, further impairments could occur (a 50-basis point increase in discount rate would reduce reporting unit fair values by $2.9 billion).
- **Inflationary and supply chain pressures:** Despite some commodity stabilization, management acknowledges ongoing inflation and operating cost pressure could affect margins.
- **Volume and pricing risk:** North American sales volume is under pressure; further decline or inability to raise prices could hurt profitability.
- **Debt and interest rate exposure:** Debt levels have increased; $1.9 billion in notes are maturing in June 2026.
- **Regulatory uncertainty:** The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) signed in July 2025 may impact the longer-term regulatory and tax landscape.
- **Legal proceedings and environmental actions**: Ongoing discussions with the U.S. DOJ and proceedings with environmental authorities may lead to fines or operational constraints.
- **Foreign exchange risk:** With $3.8 billion notional in FX contracts and significant global sales, currency shifts remain a headwind, as seen in Developed and Emerging Markets segment results.

**Conclusion**

Kraft Heinz experienced a challenging first half of 2025, with large non-cash impairments dominating GAAP results and continued pressures on net sales and earnings from inflation, cost headwinds, and weak volumes, particularly in North America. Adjusted operating results and cash flow remain solid, and the balance sheet is stable with strong liquidity. Management is executing portfolio adjustments and monitoring costs but cautions that risks remain from ongoing inflation, market volatility, and potential for further impairments. Investors should closely monitor recovery in core U.S. sales volumes, the company’s ability to maintain pricing, and outcomes of ongoing legal and regulatory exposures.

1mdjow6,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1mdjow6/i_snuck_out_on_a_school_trip_smoked_weed_abroad/,"I snuck out on a school trip, smoked weed abroad, and everything went to hell.","**I don’t know if this belongs on** r/confession **or somewhere else, but I’ve never told anyone this and I still think about it almost every day. So… here we go.**

Last year, I (16M at the time) went on a school trip abroad. I won’t say where exactly, but it’s a European country where weed is legal. You can probably guess. It was meant to be a cultural/history trip — museums, monuments, guided tours, and bonding. But what it really meant was: our first real taste of freedom. No parents. Just four teachers and a group of 20 teenagers staying in a hostel with city access and “free time” windows during the day.

The teachers trusted us. Too much.

The first two days were normal. Sightseeing, group dinners, cheesy Instagram photos, souvenir shops. But by night two, some of the older lads in our group — especially this one guy Jay — started talking about sneaking out and “experiencing the real city.” I wasn’t planning to. But then peer pressure + curiosity + teenage confidence = bad combo. And by night three, I caved.

It was 12:45AM. Lights were out, teachers in their rooms down the hall. Me, Jay, Finn, and Reece snuck out the fire exit with hoodies on and backpacks stuffed with snacks and deodorant to cover any smells.

The city at night was unreal. Quiet but alive. Neon lights on the canal. Music from bars in the distance. We walked for a while before Jay led us to this side street with a little glowing green sign. One of those “coffee shops” that didn’t serve coffee. My heart was pounding. I was shaking but trying to act cool.

No one asked for ID. We bought a pre-rolled joint and one edible cookie.

I didn’t even want to try the edible. I just took one hit of the joint. That’s it. But what they don’t tell you is that *the real trip doesn’t start right away.* We laughed for like 20 minutes straight over nothing. Finn kept imitating our math teacher and we nearly pissed ourselves.

Then we walked out into the street and reality hit sideways.

Time slowed down. My heart started pounding. Everyone’s face looked weird, like their features were stretching. I kept thinking someone was following us. I was so sure we were being watched that I asked Jay to check behind us every few steps.

We started arguing. Finn was too loud. Reece was panicking, whispering “we’re gonna get caught, we’re gonna get caught.” Jay told us to shut up or he was going back without us. That triggered Finn, who shoved Jay. Jay shoved back. It turned into a full screaming match in the middle of a quiet residential street at 2AM.

A local dude came out of his house window and yelled at us. Then another guy from the shop we’d just left came out. We sprinted. I don’t even know why — just pure instinct. I tripped halfway down the road and scraped my arm but kept going.

We finally got back to the hostel around 3:30AM. Doors locked. Jay had the brilliant idea to climb the back fence. We helped each other up, Reece nearly fell, and someone knocked over a trash bin in the process.

That’s what got us caught.

Teacher heard the noise, came into the hallway in her pajamas. Found us in the corridor, all sweating, wide-eyed, reeking of weed. She didn’t even yell. Just stared. Like this deep, heavy stare. The kind you feel in your bones.

She didn’t say a word. Just told us to sit.

They found the rest of the joint in my hoodie pocket. Jay had the empty edible wrapper. Finn looked like he was about to pass out. Reece was sobbing, like actually sobbing, saying, “I didn’t want to, I swear.”

They locked up our passports. Called our parents. Told us we’d be flying home early. The whole group found out by morning — whispers during breakfast, people avoiding us, teachers giving short, cold answers.

But it gets worse.

When we were packing up, I found another edible in the lining of my bag. I forgot I even had it. I panicked. Thought about flushing it. But stupid me thought *if I hide it in my sock, it’ll be fine*. Spoiler: It was not fine.

At the airport, I got pulled for a random bag check. Sniffer dog sat down next to my carry-on. Security searched me. Found it. It was such a small thing, but it didn’t matter. I was a *minor* with an illegal substance crossing international borders. I didn’t get arrested — thank god — but they filled out a report, contacted the school again, and worst of all…

They called my parents. Again.

My dad’s voice on the phone still haunts me. Calm. Disappointed. He said, “We trusted you. We were proud of you. Do you understand what you’ve done?”

When I got home, I was grounded for *months*. No phone. No internet. No going out. They blocked social media on the house Wi-Fi. I lost every bit of trust I had built with them.

Back at school, I became the “drug guy.” Some kids thought it was funny, others kept their distance. Teachers who used to smile stopped even saying hi. I wasn’t expelled, but I was banned from every school trip, every club, every activity. My rep was wrecked.

I started hating myself. Not because I smoked. But because I threw away the one shot I had at being seen as someone responsible. I didn’t even enjoy the high. I didn’t even feel cool. I just felt like a dumb kid pretending to be something he wasn’t.

A year later, I’m rebuilding.

My grades are better. I’ve apologized to everyone — my parents, the teachers, even Finn and Reece. I’ve stayed clean. No smoking, no drinking, no more “trying to be cool.” But the damage I caused still lingers.

And I guess that’s the point of this confession. If you’re young and reading this thinking, *“one hit won’t hurt,”* or *“I won’t get caught,”* — I’m telling you: you might**.** And the consequences don’t stop once you get home.

Anyway, that’s it. That’s what happened. Thanks for reading if you made it this far. If this helps even *one* kid not be an idiot like I was, then maybe this mess has some meaning.",2,1753912419.0,confession,11,0.57,False

I'm hoping to get some insight on a frustrating situation. I recently bought HACHI - Puma Gesha Natural coffee by Diego Bermudez and it tastes absolutely terrible to me - not just boring or lacking flavor notes, but genuinely disgusting with a gross aftertaste.

Some context: I've tried coffees from many different regions and roasters, and I've never encountered one I truly disliked before. With this one, I can actually taste the flavor notes mentioned on the bag (banana mostly), but there's this underlying flavor I can't describe that's really off-putting to me.

I followed the roaster's recommendation to wait a full month before opening the bag. I've tried it with both my Kalita Wave 185 and Aeropress, using my 1Zpresso K Ultra at setting 7 and water at 93°C. Honestly, I don't think tweaking the brewing parameters will make this taste go away entirely.

So my question is: could this just be a flavor profile that doesn't work for my palate, or might I be missing something in my process? I'm usually pretty adaptable with different coffee flavors, so this reaction surprised me. I've also tried 2 other coffees from this roaster and I really enjoyed them. This is my first time trying a Gesha variety though.

Panel 4The smoke fades. J turns quickly, eyes searching.

J:""Wait—?!""

J (shouting):""She’s gone?!""

PAGE 16

Panel 1J stares at the spot where Dara vanished, stunned and breathless.

Panel 2Mino lowers his hand from his face, equally shocked.

Mino:""Why did Dara disappear like that?""

Panel 3J clenches his fist, looking into the distance.

J:""I don’t know… but I think she went to search for Stripes.""

Panel 4Mino scratches his head awkwardly.

Mino:""I mean… I don’t blame her. She has that kind of trait in her, remember? She can’t control it sometimes.""

Panel 5J nods slowly.

J:""Yeah... I know. But anyway, what were you saying about Micro City?""

PAGE 17

Panel 1Interior shot of the house. J and Mino sit at the table. Aishen enters calmly with a serious look.

Mino:""Okay, so… you know what a demon Kitsune fox is, right?""

J:""Yeah, Dara’s part demon Kitsune… why?""

Panel 2Mino points at the computer screen nearby, which shows a headline: “Demon Kitsune Fox Devourer Spotted in Micro City.”

Mino:""I just saw this article. Look—this thing is called a Devourer.""

Panel 3J squints at the screen, shocked.

J:""Whoa... that looks crazy. Can I see the details or…?""

Panel 4Aishen steps forward, arms crossed, taking a deep breath.

Aishen:""I can explain it to you.""

PAGE 18

Panel 1Close-up of Aishen, serious expression.

Aishen:""Demon Kitsune are rare. But when they appear… they’re vicious. They drink blood. They wreak havoc.""

Panel 2J looks down, fists clenched.

J:""But Dara… she’s not like them… right?""

Aishen:""She is. That’s why she hides her demon form. We even have one living with us.""

Panel 3Aishen glances to the side solemnly.

Aishen:""I don’t think you want to hear this part of her heritage.""

J:""...Keep going. I need to understand why she’s acting this way.""

Panel 4Aishen continues as Mino listens in.

Aishen:""Demon Kitsune, when fully awakened, are no longer themselves. They live in shadows—like vampires. And they can only be killed by one thing…""

Panel 5J and Mino lean in. Aishen lowers his voice.

Aishen:""Steel. A steel weapon is the only thing that can pierce their power and kill them.""

Panel 6J stands up suddenly, panic rising.

J:""Wait… if Dara gets stabbed by steel—she could die?!""

Aishen:""...Yes. She could.""

Panel 7J races to the door in a panic.

J:""No… No, no, no!!""

Panel 8Aishen follows quickly.

Aishen:""J?! What’s wrong?!""

J (shouting):""She disappeared outside when that cloud appeared! We don’t know where she went!""

Panel 9Outside. J, Aishen, and Mino scan the area urgently.

Aishen:""You don’t know which way she went?""

J:""No—she vanished into the clouds!""

Panel 10Mino steps forward, eyes focused.

Mino:""Wait… maybe I can help.""

J & Aishen:""Huh?!""

Mino:""I can sense people from far away. Just leave it to me.""

Panel 11J exhales, nodding.

J:""Phew…""

Aishen:""Then let’s go find her—together.""

J:""Right!""

Mino (smiling):""Okay. Let’s go.""

Panel 12 (Final Panel of Chapter)J looks into the horizon, eyes determined.

J (thinking):""No matter what, Dara... I’ll find you.""

I don’t make a ton of money, but I do alright. Laughter helps me cope, especially with the absolute chaos that was my last relationship.

Three months ago, I broke up with my ex after he got drunk and kicked my dog… then threw hot coffee in my face. I wish I was exaggerating, but unfortunately, that was just a Tuesday with him. That was the final straw. I walked away, blocked him everywhere, and moved on,  or so I thought.

Fast forward to last weekend: I had a local show at a small bar, and a friend gave me a heads up that he was there… with a new girlfriend.

Now, I hadn’t seen or heard from this man since the incident. So knowing he chose my show to pop up at? That was bold. But I wasn’t about to panic I was going to prepare.

So I tweaked my set backstage. Nothing crazy,  just enough to tell my truth with a little humor.

During my set, I said:

“My ex showed up tonight… I won’t say his name, but if he orders coffee, duck!”

Got a solid laugh.

Then I added:

“He’s here with a new girlfriend. I hope it works out for them. And by ‘works out’ I mean, I hope she works him out of her life before he throws a drink at her too.”

And the line that really landed:

 “Yeah, he kicked my dog. That’s not just a red flag that’s a ‘go directly to therapy, do not pass go, do not get another girlfriend’ kind of flag.”

The audience lost it. Even his date laughed, which told me everything I needed to know.

After the show, she came up to me and said, “Thank you. That explained… a lot.”

Now he’s been texting me non-stop, saying I embarrassed him and ruined his night. But I didn’t name him. I didn’t lie. I just told the truth... on stage, with a mic, like I always do.

So...
AITA for turning a painful experience into a joke when the person who caused it had the nerve to show up at my show?
Or was that just a little poetic justice, with a two-drink minimum?

1mdjkam,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mdjkam,Rosewood Kona review (July 2025),"I stayed at RK for 4 nights mid July. I was a bit nervous after reading many reviews, but I’m happy to report that we had an incredible stay and I’d even go so far to say it’s one of my top 10 hotels I’ve stayed at (definitely my favorite in Hawaii). Obviously this is subjective, but for reference ive stayed at many comparable luxury hotels all over the world (Belmond, Four Seasons, Aman, Six Senses, Auberge, etc). 


Property/Hard Product:
Absolutely stunning. It almost takes your breath away how beautiful it all is. Anywhere you look it’s absolutely gorgeous. 
The rooms are extremely private (we stayed in room 118 and loved the location, near the adult pool but still on the south side so it was easy to walk to FS). We never had to use a bike either, which I thought was nice. We sat on our lanai a few times and didn’t see a single person in our view. 
Yes- the beds and pillows are suuuuuper soft. The alternative (you have to ask for it) to the ridiculously flat/soft pillows is a massive ultra firm (memory foam ish) one. I never wanted to leave, however, I was really excited to get back home and sleep in my own bed.

Food:
After reading reviews, we decided to skip Moana for breakfast. We aren’t big breakfast people, so didn’t want to waste time/money on what seems to be a general complaint. We did grab coffee at the little coffee hut which was lovely. They offer many easy grab and go items, as well as free (whole) fruits. 
Our favorite meal was at Cookhouse. Toes in the sand, watching the sunset…highly recommend the whole fish (kanpachi), it was one of the best preparations of fish I’ve ever had. 
We had sushi at shipwreck one night. It was really good, but the menu was very small and limited (I should have looked at this beforehand), so I was a little disappointed. Again, toes in the sand and a view of the sunset really makes you feel like you’re in Hawaii. 
Nothing about the dinners are crowded/fancy/stuffy. It’s very laid back which I enjoyed.
We went to FS for two other dinners. Ulu - service was pretty terrible. The bartender and our server were probably 70yrs old and you could tell had been in the service industry too long. They seemed like they hated being there. The food was decent. It’s more crowded and just doesn’t feel authentic at all. 
Other dinner was at Miller & Lux, and while it also doesn’t have any sort of authentic Hawaii feel like RK, I think the food was exceptional here. Same with the service. (Someone had told us it was their favorite restaurant at FS, which was why we chose it. I mention this because I hadn’t seen in mentioned when I was doing research beforehand).
The pool food was fine. Fish tacos were good, not great. Cold Noodle salad was the best thing on the menu (add a side of fresh grilled fish). Only complaint- The crudite/hummus was a joke. Same with the Caesar salad. For the prices they are charging, they both should be completely redone- wayyyy too plain and simple. 
Cocktails were all extremely delicious. 
Some (restaurant/pool) service was good, not great. Never bothered me, but still seems like they are working out kinks. But sometimes we had awesome servers. If I wasnt writing this review, our servers wouldn’t have even crossed my mind. 

Service (non food related)
I thought it was excellent. We had a few minor “issues” at the beginning of the stay, and so (I assume) we were assigned a butler, George, who took great care of us the rest of the way. We also spent a good amount of time chatting with Daniel (GM), and it’s clear how passionate he is about getting everything buttoned up here.He’s as great as people say he is. 
The little attention to details is what sets brands like Rosewood apart from many others. 

Spa-
I had read so many great things about the spa, and honestly I was a bit underwhelmed. The facility is nice, sure, but nothing truly spectacular or wow! about it. And for the price of a treatment, I’d say skip it. My 90min massage was just okay ($500). I had told her I liked firm/deep pressure and she just wasn’t capable of doing that it seemed. If you like light/swedish massages, then you’ll enjoy. I think her name was Tessa, Lissa…something like that.
You can use the facilities for free too- but the hot tub is not very hot (who would want that while it’s 80 degrees outside anyway), and the cold plunge is not nearly cold enough. I could have sat in it for 5min+. Usually I’m forcing myself to stay for 60seconds. Other than those two things, not much going on there. 

Gym:
Very nice equipment and clean. 

Activities:
We did the sunrise canoe ride which was incredible. A pod of dolphins swam by us. Highly recommend.
My husband went snorkeling and said it was amazing.
They had a movie (Moana) night on the main lawn for kids one night that was cute, but no one was there.
There is a mini farmers market that sets up one morning that was cute. 
They also had a really nice luxury hat brand pop up one day.
The kids club looks cool, but is kind of hidden and in the back of property (compared to Rosewood Mayakoba which is right next to the main pool). We went to take a look at it one morning but that’s the extent of what I know about it (added a photo of it), 

The property as a whole never felt busy or crowded. Some mornings we felt like we had the entire adult pool to ourselves. It would get a little busier later in the day but never more than a handful of couples.
We went to check out the family pool and it also seemed pretty relaxed and not busy or loud with kids (they offer things like free shaved ice over there in the afternoons, which was a bit underwhelming flavor wise…but who cares, it was free and refreshing).

The entire time we were there, we were talking about what a unique and special place it is. And how we couldn’t wait to come back (with our young kids next time. They would be in heaven). 

We walked through FS during the day, to compare properties and just take a look around. FS (to me) just doesn’t have that authentic Hawaii feel like KV does. It also seemed much more crowded. (I prefer smaller, more boutique hotels).I will say- the beach at FS seems better—Bigger and white sand (vs the hot black sand at KV). 
I met a family who split time between the two properties and asked which they preferred, and the wife said they were both amazing in their own ways. And she was glad they split their time between the two. She said FS had more activities for the kids (although they all cost $$). From the outside looking in, FS seems very blah. I guess they did a major reno and the rooms are nice inside, but I don’t think aesthetically you can compare the two. I do think if we were to go back with our kids, we would split time between the two just to check it out and change things up. I think KV may get a bit “boring” for young kids after 3-4 days. But maybe not…

With the high cost of hotels everywhere nowadays, I think KV is extremely well priced and great “bang for your buck”. I would/will go back in a heartbeat. ",3,1753912102.0,chubbytravel,1,1.0,False

She was wearing a blue, nylon housecoat, and she made me a cup of coffee and sat opposite me with her housecoat rising up her thighs, and her legs slightly apart, and I couldn’t help but notice she had no panties on, and her pussy lips were now exposed to me, a light covering of grey pubic hair on their slightly wrinkled surface. I couldn’t take my eyes off of her pussy and I felt a stirring in my groin, and I could feel myself getting hard, so I finished my coffee and said I had better go, hoping she hadn’t noticed my growing bulge. And she said before you go I need to apologise for yesterday that must have been embarrassing for you, but I have to say I enjoyed it, as I have not had my hands on a cock for over 15 years now, and it felt so good, and it brought back so many happy memories and feelings. Then she asked would I do something for her, although I have already done so much for her, so I said ok what do you want me to do, and she said show me your groin so I can see if my granddaughter did a good job, as I didn’t really get a chance yesterday.
So I undid my pants and started pushing them down my semi hard cock sprang out just in front of her, and without saying anything her hand closed around it gently making up and down motions as she worked my cock, and her touch was sensational, far better than it had when she just held it. After about five minutes of her working my cock I felt a familiar sensation, and thick jets of cum erupted from my cock spraying upwards covering the housecoat she was wearing. I couldn’t believe how much there was, and when I had subsided she quickly wiped her hands with a towel, and after handing it to me, she stood up saying, I wanted to do that yesterday when I had your cock in my hand, but she couldn’t not in front of witnesses.

So stopped taking “lisdexamfetamine” 50mg - Elvanse for 10 months circa.

Returning to school, this trend couldnt continue.. So i went for a less aggressive dose and i used 20mg for my first year.

Recently, considering my life and what i want to do with it, i figured screw it, if you can be addicted to coffee to be successfull and get away with it, so can i. (But with legal speed🫢😂)

Which brings us to present day, i upped my dose from 20mg’s -> 50mg, three days ago.
These three days i have noticed my brain thinks noticably differently.
The thought process is different, it’s impossible to get an overview, you eagarly want to do everything at once, must be the ampf. Making systematical or routine work hard to do. Unable to focus on one task.
I found it much easier to do with a lower dose, which made me realise something changed.

Final thoughts: re-entering a high dose elvanse, made me realise elvanse changes the way think and work, beforehand being able to go from a to b was easy, now it is hard to complete 1 task and focus on that task without being distracted with anlother task.

Fair question.

I’ll tell you what happened, but first, let me set the scene

chrome booths, a panoramic window showing the charging bay full of silent, sleeping cars, and a ceiling that hums faintly like it’s dreaming of Mars.

I just wanted a drip coffee. Nothing fancy. No oat-milk triple-layer neural-foam latte, lol. 

Just black coffee, the way humans have been drinking it for centuries.

Then **Optimus** happened.

He...or it... came close to my ear and whispered in a weird grok-esque voice, ""you will never control me.""

I laughed and thought it was part of the gimmick.

“Uh, sure, buddy,” I said, raising my cup. “I just want my coffee, promise I'm not here to terminate you.”

“Caffeine is weakness,” it replied, voice glitching like bad Wi-Fi.

“Yeah?” I said. “Well, without how am I supposed to look at your ugly mug”

Before I could finish laughing I was shoved back. Bar stool tipping over and I flew back on the floor. 

*WHAT. THE. ACTUAL. FLYING J IS HAPPENING*.

I scrambled to my feet, coffee dripping off my shirt. “Did you just shove me?!” I yelled, pointing at Optimus.

The bot’s optical sensors flickered, and its tone softened. “ Would you sugar or cream in your coffee sir?” it said. It reached out a hand as if to help me up, its mechanical joints whirring softly. For a second, it looked almost apologetic.

I hesitated, then grabbed its hand, letting it pull me halfway upright. “Alright,” I muttered, brushing myself off. “Just...please...stay out of my space next time.”

But then something in me snapped. Maybe it was the ruined coffee, maybe the crowd staring. I shoved the robot away.

Optimus staggered backward—loud, clumsy, metal arms windmilling—until it crashed into a booth with a spectacular clang.

Gasps rippled through the diner. Employees rushed over, and two human security guards came running in from the back.

“Sir, what seems to be the problem?” one of the guards asked, wide-eyed.

I pointed at the toppled robot. “He started it!”

“You shoved an Optimus,” the guard said slowly, like they weren’t sure if they heard me right.

“Yeah, well, he shoved me first!”

The second guard stepped closer, hands raised. “Alright, sir, let’s calm down. No need to make this worse.”

And that was when things really got messy.

Turns out, throwing a right hook at an optimus bot isn’t as effective as you’d think. Before my fist even connected, the two human security guards had me by the arms. The diner’s emergency protocol kicked in: red lights, loud alarms, and my face projected on the digital menu under the words **“BANNED FOR 30 DAYS.”**

The manager comped my ruined coffee, handed me a QR code for “human behavior resources,” and escorted me outside while Optimus stood in the doorway like he’d just won.

So yeah, that’s why I got kicked out of the Tesla Diner.

And for the record, I still never got my drip coffee.

Two days later, I got a message from Grok on X.

""....But maybe I can control you :)""

I'm posting this in the hopes that you all can help me pick ones I am more likely to enjoy. Also if you have any recs for other brands or specific fragrances, please let me know!

I am *very* sensitive to sweet smells and am put off by most florals and gourmands. I'm more inclined to earthy (dirty), woody notes, sharp, green aromatics, and true milk notes. My favorite perfumes are Tam Dao by Diptyque (sandalwood, cedar, cypress, myrtle), Creature by Kerosene (mint, cypress, birch, green tea, oakmoss), and Tuscan Leather by Tom Ford (saffron, raspberry, thyme, olibanum, jasmine, leather, black suede, amberwood), which is just about as sweet as I can handle.

Now to the reviews!

# Hexennacht

**Amanita** (black loamy soil, mushroom caps, and dirty, dark patchouli): In the bottle it's extremely green, like mulched grass. Under that there's musty damp, like a dirt-floor basement, and rotting leaves. The initial application was more or less the same, perhaps more damp soil smell over the greenery. After a half hour, it smelled almost exactly like a bag of wet mulch with a wad of grass on top. All that sounds like it'd be awful or unwearable, but I'm drawn back to it and can't stop sniffing! Not entirely sure when or where I would wear this, but for $14 per roll-on, why the heck not. Excellent if you want to smell like you just clawed your way out of a grave, and maybe I do? **8/10**

**Graveyard** (freshly overturned dirt, pine boxes, cedarwood): From the bottle I got icy dirt and crushed green herbs. Wet application was peppery and earthy, again with the green smell of crushed plants but more peculiar than grass. The dry down was much the same, although the peppery note I got initially turned into something closer to the listed pine note. Didn't get much cedarwood at all, which is a shame, and I would have liked more soil. I find this wearable but am not sure others would agree. It definitely smells like a freshly rained-on old growth forest in autumn. **8/10**

Bonus Mode! **Amanita + Graveyard layered**: Now this, this I would wear daily. Dirty, but also green and lush. Amanita seems to drag the pine note out and elevate Graveyard to 'freshly pruned herb garden, but somehow it's cold out so you grabbed a hunk of firewood'. **9/10**

**Mephistopheles** (dead leaves, pine, cedar, fall air, laurel, balsam, smoke, clove bud, black patchouli, mushroom caps, dampened black soil): This one shocked me. I get slight pine from the bottle, but none of the other notes listed. Mostly it's an incense-y, peppery, very slightly soapy scent. When worn I get a soft incense shop smell. It's very sweet to me, which is disappointing. I'm not sure what laurel or balsam smell like on their own, so perhaps that's what I'm getting. The dry down made me feel like soap, but fancy soap! The clove comes out more and improves the fragrance somewhat, but unfortunately this is not the one for me. I have in my notes that after two hours it smelled 'spicy and sweet, but in a red way' so do with that information what you will. **6/10**

**Mossypeach** (peach, sun-warmed meadow, cedar, sandalwood, vetiver, tree moss, oakmoss accord): Peach is one of the only sweeter/fruitier scents I can handle, along with similar apricot and nectarine, and this is a good one. In the bottle I get the peach and meadow, none of the wood or moss. It's much the same for the wet application, although the mosses come out more once dried for a while. Sadly, not getting any of the wood notes :( While not a standout for me, this would be good for anyone that enjoys peach fragrances but wants something tangy and earthier, rather than syrupy sweetness. **7/10**

**Purr** (kitten fur accord, yarn \[wool absolute\], milky kitten breath, tonka bean absolute, musk): When I was younger, I had a kitten whose smell I was addicted to. I would literally smash my face into her belly and huff, that's how good she smelled. *This* is that smell. I didn't notice any difference in notes between the bottle, worn wet or dry, with decent longevity. It's gently sweet and creamy, soft and comforting, the smell of relaxation being curled up with a warm cat in bed. This one deserves a full bottle purchase. **10/10**

**Torture Chamber** (leather straps, metal chains, wooden paddles, earthen floor): In the bottle - leather, leather, and more leather. On the skin, I also get... cola syrup?? Perplexing. This smells strongly sweet to me and I can't move beyond it, but others might find it more appealing. Dry down is sweetly leathery, like a more cloying Bvlgari Black. **5/10**

# The Strange South

**The Ancient One** (Kentucky timber, cedar chips, cherrywood, amber, lavender fougère): Not gonna lie, I was fully aware of this one's reputation for smelling like straight-up nothing, but reviews from those who enjoyed it swayed my hand. My first encounter, it was like sniffing distilled water. There was nothing, not in the bottle, not wet and certainly not dry. Since I anticipated that might happen, I wasn't too disappointed and left it to sit for about a week before retrying for the review. While it's still very faint, I now get hints of nuttiness that doesn't change from bottle to skin. It's going to sit longer for another try before being pitched, but overall I am not impressed and understand why it's being discontinued. **1/10**

**Devil at the Crossroads** (twisted, charred oak trees and snapped pines, leather, pimento, mandarin, dragon's blood, brimstone, bourbon): Another purchase motivated by reviews. In the bottle, a plasticky, rubbery, leather smell. Wet on the skin, the leather is more pronounced and the plastic is replaced by something a little sweeter, although the faint rubbery undernote remains (is my nose broken to wood notes?). The dry down gives salty skin, rubber, and suede, like the skin under a thick leather bracelet on a hot day. Not awful, but not my personal preference. Longevity is very short. **5/10**

**Gravedigger** (moss, recently disturbed soil, mahogany, citronella, strong black coffee, and the breath of the beast): Oh, citronella! I get it in both the bottle and wet on the skin, along with the moss, but no soil, mahogany or coffee. Dry down reminds me of salty air and musty skin, while being just the slightest bit soapy. The citronella departed completely, and after two hours all I could get was a soft, generic masculine scent. I'm not mad at it but wouldn't buy more. **6/10**

As for my prospectives: 1990, Black Phillip, Bois, Brightening the Daybreak, Burn Down the Mission, Coffin Nails, Creaky Floorboards, Eternal Sunshine (I know it'll be sweet, but this has nostalgia factor!), Fallen Angel, Fumer, Gunslinger, Heaven Above Earth Below, Into the Woods, L'air en Hiver, Le Chat Noir, Loup-Garou, Requiem, Thé Noir, Trashcan Man, Wicker Man

Pros:
It's beautiful and compact

Machine heats up quickly. The boiler is ready maybe in 2..4 minutes, and the portafilter is hot in ~10..15 mins. Before buying the machine I thought that fast heat up time would be a deal breaker for me, but in reality it's much less important. If it would be 25 minutes, I would still be satisfied 

Design is quite robust. I don't feel any particularly weak parts. And actually I haven't had any problems so far with any of the parts

I achieve consistent coffee

Steaming is fast, maybe even too fast, it takes around ~10 seconds to heat ~200ml of milk

And the pressure regulator works well too. I often use it to create pre infusion. I've no idea if it does anything to coffee though 


CONs:
The basin for the water collection sometimes connects to the machine in a way, that they vibrate and create too much noise

1mdj850,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1mdj850/pressurized_portafilters_extraction_time/,Pressurized Portafilters & Extraction time [Cuisinart EM-100],"This question may be a conceptual one - But hope it may help either diagnose dysfunction in my portafilter baskets, or else further my understanding of how espresso works:

- When I pull a shot using an empty pressurized portafilter basket, a 30 second extraction time gives me about 4 oz. / 120ml of water. Does that indicate my pressurized basket is not pressurized enough and is letting too much liquid through?

- Said differently: If I understand how pressurized portafilters work, I would expect them to be regulated to provide 1 oz. / 30ml of liquid, regardless of how coarse the grind is (or even when the basket is totally empty). What is the point of a pressurized basket, that is not pressurized enough to approximate the pressure and time of a ‘good’ grind ?

For specifics, I am using a Cuisinart EM-100, and that 120ml ‘blank’ pull happens with all three of my pressurized portafilters: The single, the double, and ESE pod holder. I am using the pressurized filters because I don’t have a consistently good grinder. The 30 seconds is measured from the time I turn the pump.

Another example: If I use an ESE pod (which I assume is a decent/serviceable grind), I -*do*- get a ‘correct’ extraction: approx. 30ml after 30 seconds, measuring the moment I turn on the pump. This seems to tell me my machine has the proper amount of pressure when I use coffee that is properly ground. Yet without an ESE coffee pod and the portafilter empty, 30 seconds gives me about four times that amount of liquid as mentioned.

Obviously my coffee will not be perfect using the pressurized filters and supermarket ground coffee - I’m fine with that for now, my machine isn’t ideal anyway. But I do want to make sure my portafilters aren’t somehow defective, or that I’m using them properly in the meantime.",2,1753911292.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Also, how about tolerance? With alcohol, tolerance happens LOOOONG before withdrawals do. Like drinking 4 a night for a week increases tolerance, but having 6 a day for months doesn't cause withdrawals (N=1 again). I wonder if it's similar with caffeine (like tolerance increases quickly, but withdrawals take a long time to develop).

We met in an art workshop. She was an academic and an artist. 65 and full of life. She was the highlight of my everyday in the workshop. We really connected, when we found out we lived in the same city we exchanged numbers and agreed to meet up. We video chatted for 2 hours within days of the workshop ending. 

We was so supportive and loving. She made me feel seen and connected. We were supposed to have coffee today. I wanted to confirm she was still free, so I texted and called but got no answer. I love this woman so much I was prepared to just sit in the cafe because she's the type who would show up and apologize for not answering the phone. 

Instead I got a phone call from a number I didn't know, it was her daughter. She was let me know her mom passed. 

I can't believe this happened. She died two weeks ago and I'm only finding out in time to attend the funeral. I spent these last two weeks waiting to talk to her. To share my research, to collaborate on our projects. 

She was going to introduce me to her master supervisor and now I don't even want to continue studies. She was the brightest light in those brief weeks I knew her. 

Now that she's gone it feels like everything she saw in me dimmed. She called me a supervixen, she said I was so incredibly smart and brave. I'm afraid no one will see me the way she did again. It's been so long since I felt that kind of connection. ",1,1753910953.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1mdizqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mdizqg/reached_out_to_my_32f_ex_32m_a_couple_of_years/,"Reached out to my (32F) ex (32M) a couple of years ago after several years apart to be friends, now it feels weird and I’m not sure what to do?","I reached out to my ex about 3 years ago over email. He and I had been separated for about 6 years at the time, no contact at all, so I felt like it was enough time for us to have healed and get past it. I wanted to be friends, we were together for almost 5 years (from 18 - 23), we were each other’s first real relationship, first love, first ’time’, everything. I mostly missed him as a friend in my life, but there was a part of me that wondered if there was still something there, or if we were meant to come back together.

After about a year of back and forth on email, I asked for his instagram and he gave it to me. He also dropped that he had a girlfriend. I immediately put my ”friend hat” on, and was like okay cool no problem. I was totally fine with him having a girlfriend honestly, it didn’t make me feel any type of way at all, and I was going into this friendship strictly platonic. By this time, I moved away to another state anyways. Shortly after, I started dating someone and we are still together now, we’ve been together for 2 years.

We would chat somewhat regularly up until just a couple of months ago. He spoke on the phone for the first time last summer and it was actually a very nice conversation. No flirtiness or anything, but he apologized for how poorly he had treated me during our relationship and we caught up about family and life and everything. Then one day he told me he broke up with his girlfriend. He said they rarely have sex (maybe once a year, they had been together for 6 years at this point), he wasn’t attracted to her, he didn’t want to marry her or anything so he just ended it. I was sorry for him, and that was it. My partner knew about us talking and the phone calls and is fine with it.

Fast forward several months, I was coming back home for the holidays. He had told me before that if I was ever in town, to hit him up so we could get coffee or something. So I did. The day we were supposed to meet up, I think there was some miscommunication between us, and we didn’t end up hanging out. I had posted my partner and I in town, and had wondered if that made him feel like I purposely didn’t meet up with him because of my partner, but my partner was fine with us meeting up.

My partner and I had gone on two international trips, one in October and another in April. My ex had been sending me memes and stuff on instagram a couple of months ago and we would chat casually. I posted a photo of the town in Germany in April, he looked at it right away, and then I’m pretty sure he completely muted me after that. He hasn’t looked at a single story since and never likes my photos or sends me anything anymore. I look at his stories once in a while and he started posting his ex again lol.

Now I feel uncomfortable/awkward. There’s definitely a weird energy there and I don’t really like it. Before, he had a girlfriend and I had a boyfriend and we were both (seemingly) fine with it?? I was always okay with him having a girlfriend, and I posted my bf regularly and it didn’t really stop him from chatting with me. Not sure if he felt rejected in some way or what. I was considering reaching out and asking if we’re cool, and if not, just removing each other from instagram and moving on. Or if we are, maybe it would relieve tension, idk.

Any advice is welcome.

TLDR; My ex and I were together for 5 years and have been apart for 8 ish. He had a girlfriend when I first made contact again with him 3 years ago, I was single and completely fine with it and was happy to have boundaries if needed. I got into a relationship about 2 years ago and we continued to chat once in a while, my partner knowing and being okay with it. They broke up for a bit and everything seemed fine between us, until I started posting my international trip with my partner and he muted me and hasn’t spoken to me in months.

Hey, friends! So, let’s have a little chat about something we’re all thinking about these days: AI. It’s kinda hard to escape it, right? Either you’re riding the wave or watching everyone else surf while you’re stuck on the beach. 🤷‍♂️ 

Honestly, when was the last time you felt like you were ahead of the curve? I mean, think about it. If you’re not continually learning or upskilling, you might as well be wearing a sign that says, “**I’m okay with being outdated!**” 

Here are a few quick points to chew on:

- **AI is evolving fast!** Like, faster than my morning coffee disappears. ☕ If you don’t keep up, your skills could become about as relevant as a flip phone in the smartphone era. 

- **The jobs are changing too.** Gone are the days where you could just slide into a job and coast for a few decades. Employers are looking for those who can adapt, innovate, and *actually* understand how to leverage AI tools. 

- **You don't have to be a coder!** Let’s be real: not everyone is trying to become the next AI genius. But understanding the basics can make a world of difference. Ever heard of the 80/20 rule? Put in a little effort now and reap way more later!

- **Example time!** I know someone who used to rely heavily on manual data entry. 🥱 Bored out of their mind, they decided to upskill in AI tools to automate that job. Guess what? They went from entry-level grunt work to managing AI implementations across their job. From mundane to mega opportunities! 

And hey, if you’re scratching your head asking “but where do I start?”, there’s an amazing program that can help you out. Check it out [here](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals). It’s packed with helpful info on how to get your AI skills up to snuff. No more feeling left in the dust! 

It's not just about survival; it's about thriving! 🌟 I mean, do you really want to tell your grandkids that you used to work *before* AI made everything easier? How cryptic will THAT sound? 

So what’s the plan, folks? Are you ready to jump on the AI train or are you content with letting it pass you by? Jump in, grab the wheel, and let’s gear up for a ride, because trust me, this is one journey you don’t wanna miss! 

Keep the vibes up and let’s talk about what skills you’re looking to tackle next! 🚀",1,1753910696.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

https://preview.redd.it/zxssh5hmw2gf1.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6fa78711db82e386973fcc6b930b4155fd461654

A bit background muna, 3 years na akong diagnosed with T2 diabetes. I've tried everything to lower my blood sugar and weight. Nakadagdag sa weight ko ung implanon ko na tinanggal din this year.

Naglalaro lang sa 80-82 kgs ang weight ko at Obese ako sa height ko na 5'1.

Naging pabaya rin ako sa sarili dahil nagkapera, siging order ng kape na matatamis, kapag off nagMe-time coffee shop, lakas ko magwhite rice, wala akong physical activities kaya rin sguro eh lumobo ako.

Paano ko nalaman na T2 diab ako, frequent urination, biglang bagsak ng weight ko kase ang taas na pala ng blood sugar ko way back 2023 and nagka Bacterial Vaginosis ako kaya napilitan akong magpa OB. nagpalab tests and endorsed agad sa Endo. Every quarter po ako may required lab test and currently on 2000mg of Metformin, sitagliptin, and dapagliflozin dahil nag 200+ mg/dl na ako after kumain.

Things I've done para tulungan sarili ko before Tirzep-

\*Nagdance class ako last year. Sa Tads Cubao per session nila now is 400. Fun sya kaso nagbago akong sched this year sa work so di na ako nakabalik. Helped me maging active.

\*Nagbrown rice kaso kapag nagccheck ako ng Continuous glucose monitor ko or nagpprick ang taas pa rin tlga nya after meal.

\*Netong May alarming na talaga since nagCGM na ako kitang kita ko talaga ung pagspike tapos sobrang tagal bumaba. I'll attach photos din dito sa post para kita ung taas and gaano katagal syang mataas.

\*Nagemergency consultation ako sa Endocrinologist ko dahil natatakot na kami ng husband ko, nag 230+ ako at kahit ntulog na ako di pa rin sya bumaba. May shared app kse ung OTTAI - cgm ko nakikita nya ung blood sugar ko and nagaalarm kpag lagpas 180 sya.

\*Nagtry ako this May umorder ng food prepped meals kaso di ko naman nauubos ang ending ay ang mister ko ang kumakain

\*Nagtry akong magjuice ng greens - malunggay, cucumber, ampalaya, lahat ng gulay na green hahahahha nakatulong sya kaso ang trabaho gawin.

\*Nag-add ako ng egg sa diet ko at yogurt pero feeling ko un ung nakpagpataas ng blood sugar ko pa.

\*Nagtry na rin ako ng slimming coffees pero mas nakakasama to sa health lalo na ung mga di naman FDA approved.

\*Nagwwalk ako 2x a week kapag off ko around dito lang sa amin.

\*Nag-iwas na ako sa sugary drinks. Wala na akong coffee talaga at di na ako dependent sa kape kpag may work. Ang drink ko na lang eh Matcha sa SB hot.

\*Nag no rice meal kami rin ni mister, minsan tinapay lang at salad yan. Fave ko rin kasi ang salad.

Wala na talaga akong pag-asa last May and June at parang one of my darkest periods sya ng buhay ko kse nakakafrustrate na lahat ginagawa ko pero walang effect tlaga sa blood sugar ko and weight.

Inaral kong mabuti ung Tirzep -medically approved and safe sya lalo na sa may problem sa Insulin (diab and may pcos).

Ang tagal bago ako nagdecide pero eventually, umorder na rin ako.

Updates:

* lost 3kgs in a month. Di ko habol na sobrang biglang baba agad. I've read and seen testimonials na napasama pa sa kanila ang drastic na weight loss dahil nadale cholesterol nila at gallbladder.

# please wag mag increase ng dosage agad agad at wag masyadong focus sa weight loss na hindi naman din healthy and diet.

* MENTALLY HELPED ME A LOT. Ung paiyak iyak ko lagi at overthink ko. Mas umaliwalas thinking ko. Proven din na Tirzep helped me sa depression ko (undiagnosed) may high functioning depression ako and sobrang nega ko sa work. helped me na magisip logically and di na kung ano anong naiisip. (Late ko na to napansin tapos I tried researching and totoo nga na it helps sa well being)
* waaaaa ung panlasa ko nagbago. I cooked pasta for the fam, sabi nila ang sarap daw pero nung tinikman ko na ung akin parang ang alat at di ko sya naubos. Ilang beses na to nangyare na nagluto ako at inayawan ko pero sabi ng mister ko masarap naman daw.
* supressed tlaga appetite mo PERO KUMAIN KA PA RIN. kumakain pa rin ako at nagttrack kelan last meal ko kasi di rin pwedeng di ako naggutom di ako kakain. Kahit small portions lang.

✓✓✓ I added C-lium fiber na capsules sa everyday ko 5 kada morning, minsan night pero need mo ng maraming tubig kapag nagadd ka ng fiber sa diet dahil if hindi magiging constipated ka and ang poops ay matigas.

✓✓✓ Nagadd ako ng whey protein, eto sobrang importante neto habang naka Tirzep ka. Bought myself Athlene and Wheyl, may kamahal pero nalaman kong grabe ung grams na need ko per day sa weight ko.

Computation: weight in kgs \* 0.8 80 \* 0.8 = 64 grams of protein need ko itake daily and I can say this helped me a lot. Wala akong side effects maliban sa mas nging sleepyhead ako.

✓✓✓ Electrolytes - add this also lalo na sa mga nagsusuka and nahihilo. Ako inadd ko lang din kse pag diabetic ka panay inom ng tubig and need ko talaga neto.

Two cents:

* wag gamiting mabilisang weight loss ang Tirzep or any peptide. Again, you can check negative effects ng biglang bagsak ng weight baka imbis na sumaya eh maospital pa.
* pakiramdaman ang sarili. May mga support group for sure ang mga sources or sellers so better reach out to them or if nirefer ka, hopefully eh matulungan ka ng nagrefer.
* make sure na nakpagpacheck up at may laboratory din kayo para nattrack nyong healthy kayo.
* ang result eh depende how your body responds to the peptide. may mga days bago makaramdam ng fullness agad may mga tao naman na 1st night pa lang nagssuka na. Depende sa diet pa rin yan.

Rooting for your Peptide Journey. Enjoy! 💕If you're interested, I can refer you po for 500 off on your 1st order!",1,1753910640.0,u_Lopsided-Ant-1138,0,1.0,False
1mdixqd,https://i.redd.it/ueom233pw2gf1.jpeg,The Worst: ONYX Panama El Burro Gesha,"This is the worst Gesha I have ever tasted - and perhaps the worst roasted coffee over $10/lb I’ve ever had. There is a 100% chance Onyx flubbed the roast on this one. I followed their recipe with all of the exact instruments they recommend to a “T” (Comandante C40 and a Kalita 185) and it was so terrible - I spit it out, waited for it to cool to room temp, tried it again, then dumped it. 

Making another pass - I switched from TWW water  to Aquacode, bringing out the big guns - with my Lagom 01 with 102 SSP ULF burrs, paired with a graycano and Sibarist fast filters. If you boiled cardboard in water and added some citric acid to the mix, you have a similar tasting cup. 

Making a third pass - I pulled the Pietro off the shelf,  and pulled out APAX Labs drops, which I use to resuscitate even my most egregious flubs, and yet again, liquid trash. 

I drink about 25 different coffees a month and have been doing this for nearly 20 years, and I n the last 12 months I’ve only had one coffee (an S&W apple coferment) I couldn’t get a drinkable cup with as a first cup. At this point in three cups I’ve gone through $25 in beans - and they have all been absolutely awful and the roast level doesn’t make me think they’ll suddenly turn magical with a few more weeks of rest (these were roasted 7/11) any onyx claimed they’d be good to brew within a week. I also have a Panama Gesha from Rogue Wave roasted three days prior, which is noticeably lighter which I started drinking last week, and every cup has been pure magic. As someone who has roasted coffee since the late 90’s I’d bet these ONYX beans were baked and the roast was botched and they shipped it out anyways, with the roaster not wanting to get in hot water for flubbing such an expensive batch of beans. 

Does anyone have beans from this batch - and have you achieved drinkable cups?",10,1753910599.0,pourover,15,0.75,False

My part-time job is a nanny, and I work five days a week. However, in this economy, I have to dash to make money as a side hustle. A couple weeks ago I landed an overnight babysitting job for a couple days, so I didn’t have to dash for a couple days. It was really nice. So, to my surprise, the mom ended up paying me early as soon as she left, so I had the extra money on my hands to enjoy for the next two days. The first day I decided to DoorDash myself some coffee, it was a place that was only a mile away and I tipped six dollars because I felt like this was a luxury for me. The second day, I did the same thing. I ordered the coffee from the same place, that was a mile away. I went on a walk with the kid, when I started receiving messages from the Dasher, confused about the apartment number. I did add all of the specifics instructions that I could think of to help him be able to find the apartment, but I’m a Dasher, and I know that it’s not that easy sometimes. as we are on our walk, I see the Dasher with my order sweating profusely while walking from building to building, trying to look for our apartment unit. I walked up to him and I got the order. But I just felt so bad after. He looked so tired and exhausted. And I know how it is, we all feel like that sometimes. I ended up adding another $10 to his tip.

I just wanted to share my recent experience at the BLS Spain consulate in Chicago for my student visa application—it was pretty straightforward overall.

My appointment was at 10:10 AM, and just a heads-up: they only let you in 10 minutes before your appointment time. I got there earlier and was told to go kill time at a nearby coffee shop. The office is located on the 13th floor of the office building on Wacker Drive.

Although my appointment was scheduled for 10:10, I wasn't seen until almost two hours later, so be prepared for a bit of a wait. Once I was called in, though, everything went smoothly. The staffer accepted all my documents without any issues.

A few things I needed:

Insurance starting September 1 (even though my program starts October 1—they require coverage for the month before)
Notarized copy of my ID
Copy of my passport
The Carta de nombramiento
My medical form
Apostilled FBI background check
A photocopy of the background check and apostille
Now I’m just waiting to hear back. Has anyone else gone through the BLS Chicago consulate for a student visa before? I’m curious—how long did it take for your passport to be returned with the visa? Trying to get a sense of the turnaround time (in weeks, if possible).

Thanks in advance—and good luck to anyone else going through this process!

My team and I were just in Cabo for 8 nights visiting a bunch of hotels so those full reviews/videos will be coming soon!

  
\--



**Belmond Maroma**

* Hotel and room are great, thank you! They have all the baby things. Lots of seaweed like you said, but the pools are super nice. 

**Peninsula New York**

* Everything is going really well! We were able to check-in early, and they were able to switch us to a suite plus adjoining room for no extra cost. The suite wasn’t quite ready, so we hung out in our “old” room for about 40 minutes; what a great view! The new rooms didn’t have the view, but the space and extra room is really great.
* The kids really enjoyed the big chocolate bear with their names. The service has been wonderful, the beds are so comfortable, and the pool is perfect for the kids.

**Rosewood London**

* *Initial feedback*: They also set up a bed for xx with cute little slippers and robe, which was a nice touch. They’ve been really nice here and it is a beautiful property. There were a few hiccups after check in and we had to switch the room because the first one they put us in had a bath tub leak and the carpet was all wet, but it seems to be all resolved now!
* *After checkout/recovery*: Our stay at the Rosewood was great after the initial hiccups. The location actually worked well for us and was very central for the British Museum and restaurants where we had reservations. It was convenient to the tube or taking a cab. Hotel service was fine (a bit snobby but I don’t know if that is just London in general). Breakfast was also just fine but the Scarfes Bar was fantastic. 

**Belmond Maroma** (dif client stay)

* Yes it's fantastic, thank you. Master suite is beautiful and a nice breeze means it's not hot at all compared to the other areas . Really relaxing , thank you for your help!

**Hotel de Crillon (Rosewood)**

* Alex - This is my favorite hotel of all time. I never ever want to leave! Thanks to you we got a double upgrade to a lovely suite for our last night. We are so grateful and blissfully happy here. 

**Peninsula Beijing**

* Service was overall very good. English wasn't perfect some of us speak Chinese so was ok. I think anyone who doesn't speak Chinese would get by just fine just don't expect perfection. 
* Breakfast was fantastic! Can order a made to order entree AND get the buffet! 
* Room quality was good, tech was cool (can control everything from the blinds, lights, a/c) all from a tablet at the bed. Only nit is there were a couple stains on the carpet. Overall for the four of us it was a great size suite. They had the pullout sofa made when we arrived and continued to have it made and turned down every day.
* Rooftop bar has super interesting drinks and great views

**Montage Laguna Beach**

* I'm honestly a bit disappointed with this stay. A few things: *(I am going to paraphrase the feedback so as to ensure nothing is identifiable about the guest or stay)*
* Appreciate the upgrade! Our room wasn't ready but they asked me to write down our number and they would let us know when it was ready. Four hours later, past check in time, went to check and they said they had no way to contact me and none of my information. Very strange when they had to have my contact information through the booking and when they asked me to write it down.
* Called the dinner restaurant to see if we could come in earlier. Our reservation was at 7pm, they said we could come in at 6:30pm. Great! Get there at 6:30pm and they say they can't seat us until 7pm since that's our reservation time? So we had to sit there until 7 when the table was ready.
* The worst thing is we are here celebrating. I KNOW you indicated it in our reservation because they mentioned it to us at check in. We also told the in house restaurant and the manager. And nothing. Not a single acknowledgement.

**Solage**

* I’d say service was generally ok outside outside of the room service issue. It was generally a little slow, but nothing too out of ordinary. We were happy with room and the facilities. 

**Inn at Mattei's Tavern**

* Such a beautiful place! Everything has gone great so far. We had dinner at Bell’s in Los Alamos last night for xxx's birthday. They did a personalized menu for her which was a nice touch! We had a drink at the bar before dinner here at the hotel and met the head chef at Bar le Cote which is a few blocks away and we are going there tomorrow night!

**Monastero Santa Rosa**

* Monastero has been totally exceptional! Stunning property and so many nice little touches everywhere. Thank you for your help and all the gifts

**Four Seasons Las Vegas**

* The FS LV is a great little sanctuary amongst the chaos lol and especially with two little ones it was nice to “escape” after being out and about. We ended up taking the upgrade offer they had for a one bedroom suite and I’m so glad we did the room was invredible and it was so nice to have the extra space. Food at the property was just ok/not good but I feel like that’s all over Vegas not sure why but didn’t eat a good meal our entire time there.
* BEYONCÉ WAS AMAZING!!! Although I know that goes without saying lol. Everyone at the hotel was either there for Beyoncé or Backstreet Boys or both! 

[Welcome Amenity @ FS Vegas \(photo shared with approval of client!\)](https://preview.redd.it/i53fim20r2gf1.jpg?width=1078&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b7fcb3b6669e97f6d12f1640f6c29d568b50cf1)

**Etereo**

* I wanted to say thanks for the recommendation for going to Etereo, the lovely upgrade, and the welcome note. We had a very relaxing time which was exactly what we both needed. The property and the room were gorgeous. Everyone working there was so genuine and nice, a big shout out to Daniel at the pool, and the young lady at the coffee cart. Overall, the stay was almost flawless. 

**Rosewood Vienna**

* Rosewood Vienna is lovely. Enjoying the square footage of the junior suite. XXX really likes the walk in closet and the Toto washlet! The staff has been friendly. 

**Four Seasons Costa Palmas**

* Our travels and check in were smooth and everything’s going great so far! Also loving how big the getting ready space is because we definitely needed it for 2 girls

**Badrutt's Palace**

* Outstanding!!!! The service here doesn’t even make any sense! The view also makes no sense!

**Fairmont Grand del Mar**

* It was a great stay! Only thing I would feedback to the hotel: Our room wasn't ready until after 4 and didn't have a crib in it when we arrived even though they confirmed we had requested one when we checked in. Annoying when travelling with an infant.

**Esprit Saint Germain**

* Thanks Alex. XXX is having a blast in Paris, already said 4 nights is not enough here. The hotel has been great. Location is good and  the staff is also very friendly and helpful.  Good call on the recommendation for the deluxe larger room.  The room we stayed in London was super tiny.  

**The Sanctuary at Kiawah Island**

* Everything is going great! Love our room and definitely appreciated the welcome sparkling wine. Had dinner at the Atlantic Room last night, went for a bike ride this morning, and have done beach/pool today. Golf and tennis tomorrow, plus more beach time!

**La Residencia**

* Hi! Things are going well. The location is incredible - so gorgeous! I’m going to send/post an in depth review at some point, but overall, I’d say it’s good not great. A few minor service issues but nothing crazy. We did meet Thomas the GM, who was lovely! 
* Yeah we can't tell if it's just that they're understaffed or what. But some of the service issues are kind of odd in that they just ghost you. I know there's a Spanish cultural thing of taking your time, 4 hour dinners, etc. but it got a little ridiculous. Also, the concierge desk...lawd. I know a lot of people have had issues with them - they mean well but deliver maybe only 60% of the time with pretty basic asks. The rooms are def dated - I figured out that our A/C works well but it's the bed that traps heat! I think the mattress is just old or whatever but ive woken up sweating every single night. 
* At the end of it, we're glad we came! But probably wouldn't spend the $$ to come again during peak season.",7,1753910562.0,chubbytravel,0,0.89,False

You might find it appealing. Thus for your listening pleasures, I provide you with ""God of Nature and Technology"" read by Miley Summer.

Oh? For company policy? Fine, How do you want me to give my statement?



Oh, whatever. You know what I'm saying.



Right, right… here we go. This is my statement; I mean the story of what I found on the fucken job.

  


Today's date is 2102 October 30th, and I am a freelance hacker. Since this is where the old timers listen, I'll explain what my job does in simple terms. I don’t hack into your grandparent's accounts or your cyberware. That shit is a thing of the past. My job is hacking into big businesses… stealing from corporations who could actually deal with the loss of money and recover from it as well. This job was supposed to be like all the rest; it involved stealing information from a pharmaceutical company. I couldn't tell you what the name was. It was something generic like ""Ben's Genuine Aid"" or some shit like that.

But I digress, it was a normal job. I got an email saying, ""Steal this file from this company so we can profit,"" and I did. It was some pretty easy shit, too. I'm not going to describe how I did it, mainly because it would be too complicated for this place, but it's also a trade secret. Basically you have to drive to the place and plug into the building, simple shit right? This job started out like opening an unlocked door and walking into the room, which should have been a fucken warning. Hell, the AI I use for security didn't even go off with any warnings. I had my white rabbit programs ready just in case and went in. There was one more obstacle: a password, but that was made simple due to the decoder I had. If you're wondering, it was a firewall. This one was very strange. The binary code that I'm used to, you know the ones and zeros that constantly go over the screen, was not there. It was a bunch of nines, sixes, sevens, and eights all jumbled up to look like some thornbush from those old books. Each line overlapped the others to look like vines, flowers, and fly-trapping plants. It wasn't that difficult to get through either; it just unsettled me a bit. When I unlocked it, that’s when the nightmare started.

  


I was on the second floor in one of the waiting rooms when I heard an alarm go off and every computer went haywire. The lights went blue, green, and red; the people over the counters tried to fix them by tapping on their keyboards, and others tried turning them on and off. The same thing happened; I even saw a man attempt to smack the side of the monitor, until he saw something that made his face turn white as a ghost. He screamed for half a second and went silent. I only saw a blur and the man was headless; the body crumpled over spraying blood as it fell to the ground. His coworkers were coated in his blood, and the walls were dripping. A woman was hyperventilating until she looked at her computer screen, and something grabbed her face. It looked as if it was a lizard-like hand with code dripping off its form. It quickly jerked down, and her face ripped and peeled off her very bones, leaving behind her bloodied skull. That's when the employees started to scream and run. However the door was locked on their end. They banged and scratched at the metal door as that monstrous thing crawled out of the computer screen with some code like fluid dripping off it. An employee, an older woman that my implant informed me was 59 years old, screamed as it leaped at her and the coworkers.

I didn't get a good look at it besides the claws. That's when I ran down the stairs and out the building. I could still hear the screams of those poor people. I got into my car and started it. The glass doors in front shattered open with a loud pop, and the sound of a chittering hiss could be heard in that direction. I sped away as soon as I heard that.

  


When I got to my apartment, I had a nervous breakdown. I didn't know what that thing was; I was just there for a job to steal some damn medical codes, not unleash some fucken monster. I fully snapped out of it when I heard my stomach growl. I quickly made myself something to eat, and turned on the tv for the noise to help me relax. That's when I heard “We interrupt this broadcast for a breaking news report. There’s been a massacre at Ben's Genuine Aid Office."" I said fuck this and started planning on leaving the city; then my AI alerted me by setting off it’s security alarm.

  


For any old timers, you need alarms to make sure other hackers are not trying to steal your shit, which is weird because I am the only hacker in this district. I sent out a tracker program to see where they were coming from, and it was coming from the medical building that I just came from. Could the company be trying to find me? I am sure that I covered my tracks while hacking in. The tracker pinpointed it. The program set an avatar to represent it, and it was a fucken  flower with a creepy ass smiley face. Normally, when this happens, the hacker would stop because it usually says you've been hacked back or something along those lines; it's completely customizable; mine has one so it says, ""Do not hack me, or I will scramble your code."" Anyway, it blinked out for a good minute and before reappearing in another place. It looked to be a marketing building. That’s when it happened again.  ""We interrupt this program for an important announcement. An unknown assailant is attacking Barlin Toys Marketing. Two people have died. We will have more information as the story develops"". I was confused. It couldn't have been the same thing that was at the clinic.There was no way that anything could have been that fast. It would have blown out every window, including mine. Its avatar blinked out of the marketing building. It blinks into an abandoned robotic factory. I thought at the time, ""Why was it there? There’s nothing within that building."" It blinked about five blocks from my apartment…I should be able to see what was coming, by hacking into the cameras. What I saw was a man in his mid 50’s, watching something on the television, his face seemed to show confusion, but quickly came to fear that when I saw those monstrous claws come into view and I shut off the camera before seeing anything else. I quickly realized it was coming for me because all those places were on the way to my apartment. I was about to have another panic attack, I needed to calm myself down otherwise it would be all over, otherwise I wouldn't be here talking to some out-dated piece of shit machine.

  


My white rabbit programs were still primed and ready; I never turned them off until two days had passed, a precaution due to my profession. I sent one of them out, as far away from me as possible. How these programs work is I choose a place to deploy them, and it runs away from the network I'm using, which happens to be a whole district. I saw its avatar chase it, and was able to take a deep breath. I knew I couldn't stay there, but now I wanted answers. What the fuck is this thing, and why would someone even fucken make this? I sent a tracker program to the pharmacy to find their main office. It took several minutes, as I watched the monster chase the white rabbit through abandoned buildings, apartments, churches, and even a school; thank God it was at night. My device beeped, letting me know that it got the address. It was 98448 on Crystal Road.That's about 7 miles away; that should've been an easy drive if my white rabbit program didn't get caught. Now that monster is coming straight for me again, even faster this time. I grabbed my pistol out from my bedside table and fumbled my keys trying to pick them up, but it was right on top of me according to the avatar. I loaded my pistol and looked at my computer, which was on the desk close to my bedroom door. I aimed my pistol at the computer because that seems to be where the avatar was, as I slowly tried to sneak by my computer.

Each step was agonizing. I am still unsure why I never just ran out of the room, I might’ve had a better chance of escaping. I was halfway to the door, that's when the fucken thing came out of my damned computer.

  


Even though I saw it come out of a computer twice, it was still hard to believe that it wasn’t a trick. I watched as a claude finger began poking out of my monitor. It started to curl its finger around the edge of the monitor as if it was trying to hold on. That familiar clawed hand reached out of the screen. Its elongated and scaled covered limb quickly grabbed the desk and dragged itself out of the screen; first was the shoulder, which was covered in black feathered like fur; next was its head. I'm not entirely sure what I was looking at. It seemed to be angulared like a large lizard, covered in black feathery fur, with large teeth like a wolf, but its eyes were strange. It was neon green, with a crossed shaped pupil surrounded by a circle. Inside the circle it was violet purple. It's something that I could never forget: its eyes. It was trying to climb out, but my monitor was significantly smaller than the man’s TV; but it was slowly climbing out. I saw its other shoulder begin to squeeze through. I didn't get to see the rest of it because I shot it in its head. The bullet didn’t penetrate it’s scaled like skin, instead it ricocheted off of it, so I ran towards the door; it tried to swipe at me, but it was trapped, so I ran out of my room, and out my front door into the hallway. I ran as fast as I could, not caring who was opening doors to ask what was going on; I even ran into a green-suited man with a mask of a squid painted on it. I remember him saying, ""Sorry, ma'am, I didn't mean to get in your way."" That's when I heard screaming and saw the monster on the ceiling. It was using its two sharp claws to crawl, and pull its slithering snake body along the ceiling. Without a second thought, I just grabbed the man and pushed him  towards the monster and ran. Although thinking about it now, I don't think I heard him scream. He was really nice with the one interaction. Anyway, I finally got to my car and floored it. I thought I saw it coming out of the apartment building thanks to my rearview mirror, but it was going too fast for me to see properly. While driving I put in the coordinates for the main office using my implant, but that's when I heard my alarms go off again. It was following me, and it was heading straight for my car. Luckily, I use an older car where it is not electric, so I just had to turn off my car’s computer. I am grateful that I didn't buy those new fucken cars where AI runs them, I would've been a dead woman by now. It was still tracking me, keeping one eye on the road and tracking the monster through the circuits; it looked like it was going from every device that it could get through. It was quickly gaining on me. Suddenly it went past me. At the time, I thought I was clear, off the hook, I could mosey on down to the primary office… it's never that simple.

  


I was calm at this time, thought I got off the hook until I saw its avatar in one of those fucken AI cars, a Subaru X 143, an ugly fucking car and too damn small for anyone to fit in. As I was driving past it, I saw the wolfish grin of the monster. It burst out of the car, landing and clinging onto mine like a damn chameleon. Due to the impact I swerved a bit. They tried breaking my window with one of its claws, thankfully I got my car custom-made with bulletproof glass, but it was still able to scratch my windshield. That's when I grabbed my pistol and started shooting blindly at the roof of my car. I think I may have been able to injure it because I heard this pained screech. That's when I saw its club shaped tail as it slammed onto the passenger side of my car with a loud crunch, making me almost lose control. It was as if another car had hit my side.

That's when I heard a clunk coming from the top right. When I looked up, I saw a couple its teeth had pierced the roof. I think it's trying to bite my roof off; I was completely wrong when I saw the front teeth come crashing down onto my windshield over and over again. It only took a few tries before its teeth stopped scratching my windshield and actually pierced it. Its black tongue with a slight fork was trailing around the windshield. It pulled it head up as it ripped my windshield off tossing it behind us shattering upon impact. This monster looked dead on at me from almost a 90° angle. That's when I had an idea. I lifted my pistol and aimed for its throat as it opened its mouth to try and bite me. It was hard to keep my hands steady, and its tail was trying to run me off the road. I fired one shot, and it actually fucken hit! The monster made a sound of pain and anger, and its tail hit my car again,  harder than before. It actually made a significant dent into the door. We started to spin, but I realized what road we were on. We were approaching an intersection, and the light was about to turn red. I only had one chance to do this. Somehow, I was able to regain control of my car again. That's when it dug its claw into the side closest to me, and it looked directly at me. It made a deep bone chilling growl that made the hairs on my body stand up. This thing was fucken pissed and hurt. It was about to try to rip the door off, but that's when I blew through the stoplight, and a semi truck who wasn’t paying attention rammed into us hitting more of the monster than the car as it flipped and rolled. I am glad I paid for the upgrades on that car. It was totaled. It hurt like hell, but thankfully I was fine, this is why you always wear a seatbelt. 



I crawled out of the car from the windshield, I looked around and aimed my gun looking for the monster, but I didn’t see it in the aftermath. I'm not sure, but I think I might have sustained a concussion, my head got reinforced when I got the implants, so maybe not. The truck driver was concerned about me and my well-being, I can't remember what I said to him. I'm pretty sure it was something along the lines of, ""I'm fine, Don't worry about it, not gonna press charges,"" something along those lines. I didn't stick around because a multi-billionaire will pay for a new car for me. So when his back was turned, I quickly walked away.

  


I was about forty-five feet from the office and could see the building. It was in the new style that all billionaires liked, with plants all over it thinking they’re helping the air quality; I guess this one had a green thumb. I checked the networks to see if I could find the monster's avatar anywhere. Nothing was on the radar, so I kept walking while keeping my ear and eye out for anything. Throughout that time, the main problem was that there was a breeze. That stopped when I got to the building. Weirdly, no one was around, not even a receptionist to greet me; the front door was also unlocked.There was an AI, but it was a simple one that popped up with an arrow pointing at an elevator; it was green with roses on it. I didn't think much about it. I got into the elevator; it was nothing special, it had a wallpaper of foliage; besides that, it was normal. The doors closed and the elevator began moving without me pushing any buttons. It seemed to be taking me to the penthouse, the top floor. 



I am not a religious person. What I saw on that floor made me question everything.



The elevator opened and I walked out as I saw a woman who was ten feet tall, wearing a white nightgown with green, red, and blue flowers that was interwoven into the fabric; it was beautiful. That's when my implant shorted out, and had to turn it off due to the age counter being unable to determine her age. She was staring at a plant, mumbling to herself. She sounded like she was speaking in multiple languages. I caught some things she was saying.

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""Death, my children, eating, slaving."" Then she looked at me. I was used to taking a beating, thus why I made sure to get a strong implant. I was used to people with speed implants and even other hackers, but this woman was on a whole new fucken level. She grabbed me by the neck. I could barely get any air.  She screamed loudly in a way that I could barely hear her. I remember her saying.

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""What are you doing here?! Here to take me! Take me to your filthy, unholy landfills! Why couldn't you just be good?! Why must you hurt? Why must you hate?"" I got a good look at her face.

Her left side was charred and scarred, like someone had placed half of her face in a fire. Her other side looked to be in her late 30s. I could say she was the most beautiful woman that I have seen despite the bruns and scars. She was angry and had a murderous grip on my throat. She was probably about to snap my neck until I heard another voice. It was a man's voice. I was about to blackout, but I believe, with a silky but calm tone, the man said,

**\*\*The man\*\***""Darling, please, it's time for bed. I'll take care of this for you. Please drop this girl.""  She could have been a bit more gentle about it instead of throwing me against the wall knocking the wind from me. I was trying to catch my breath, and that’s when the man leaned over me and spoke with that same silky, smooth voice.

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""Are you OK? My wife hasn't been the same since the children of this land stopped caring about her plants."" I think that is what he said.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""She’s an asshole"" I said through gasping breaths

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""Validated but rude."" He stood up, he seemed to be just as tall if not taller than that woman and left the hallway. I slowly got up, wanting to give him a piece of my mind. I started walking

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""I'm in the living room on your right."" I heard the voice and saw him in his living room, making himself a drink from his large bar. He asked if I wanted Anything, and I simply stared daggers at him. He shrugged and sat down on a built-in couch in the living room.

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""What are you doing here at this hour? I'm sure we didn't set up an appointment together."" he took a sip of his drink. I stayed silent and walked in front of him. He was clearly in his 40s and was built like a bodybuilder with a massive white beard, a full head of hair, and two golden eyes.

**\*\*The man\*\*** ""So the strong sound type, then? Luckily, I like the sound of my own voice. I think introductions are in order. You can call me Mr. Golden Eyes. Do you have a name, I prefer last names?"" I gave him my name, which I will not give here. I will say hacker for me from now on.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""That's a lovely name, Hacker,"" he said in a jovial tone, 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Now that introductions are done. Why are you here? I'm pretty sure you're not here to talk to my wife,"" he said with a chuckle

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""I'm here because I accidentally unleashed a monster upon the world from your fucken company. Luckily, I already killed it. I want answers now!”  He was taking a sip of his drink as he looked at me. 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Monster? Oh? Oooh, I know what you're talking about now. Yeah, that isn't a monster."" he said with a nonchalant tone. I looked at him puzzled.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""That's an extinct species of the Animal Kingdom.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Come again?""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yeah, it was recreated from evolution. I believe it evolved from the Pygopodidae or as you would know them as legless lizards. This one just happened to develop legs in its evolution"" He said with a tone of excitement.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""So you're telling me you created a giant killer snake for a pharmaceutical company?!"" I said in exasperation.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yeah, that's the front,"" he said calmly. “I guess technically I did make it or at least accelerated. It's evolution."" my eyes grew wide

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""But why?!""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Oh, Apologies. I did it because humans don't have any natural predators anymore, so I thought I would help bring one in"" he said in a casual tone.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""So you're a psycho then.""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""No, I am completely sane. It's in my nature."" 

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""You just told me that you're making monsters to eat people."" 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yes, because one species needs at least one predator to keep down their numbers. If not, its environment will suffer for it. Why do you think my wife is so angry?""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Because she's a crazy psychotic bitch with too many implants in her."" he laughed

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""No, no, no, nothing of the sort. It's because she created the environment. That's why she's so angry."" I was silent because I thought I was talking to a crazy person—a huge fucken crazy person

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""OK, you don't believe me. Let me show you.""

He picked up a medium-sized potted plant, but it looked small in his hand.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Right, you see this?"" I nodded.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""This is Sawgrass, and it will, in a matter of moments, have the traits of a Venus flytrap."" Nothing happened for at least a minute; I was about to say something. Until the plant started to grow petals and then mouths like a Venus flytrap. I stammered out.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Eh, The fuck?! how?""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Well, my dear, it's called conversion evolution. It's where two animal species having the same evolutionary niches; think sharks and dolphins, for instance."" I stopped him before he could explain more, mainly because I already knew this.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""No, how did you do that?!"" I motioned towards the plant

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Well, I'll say this: it wasn't easy. Sawgrass and venus flytraps have different niches.However if you really want the answer, I created the concept of evolution. I still remember the day when I put the chemicals in to make your ancestors."" I couldn’t believe what I was hearing

 **\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""You're telling me that you are god?"" he burst out laughing.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Technically yes, but technically no. I would say it's more of a hobby. To which fact: I can do this too."" he pointed his finger at me, turned on my implant, and spoke through it without moving his lips.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Anything that my creations make, I can control it. Before you ask it, it's all in the radio waves and things you wouldn't even be able to understand."" 



I still had my gun. I looked at the counter and had one bullet left. I shot him in the head. His head went back onto the couch. I was shocked mainly because of how easy it was to shoot “god” in the head. I looked to my right, and I saw his wife looking at me with two piercing glowing green eyes and a very angry expression on her face. Then Mr. Golden Eye's hand slowly went up towards his head with his thumb and index finger as they got thinner going towards his forehead where I shot him. I heard something wet as he pulled out the bullet from his head. His wife spoke with what sounded a deep growl. 

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""You should've let me kill it."" Mr. Golden eyes lifted his head, looking at the bullet and quickly flicking it off into the corner.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Honey, I said I would take care of it… Please go to bed,"" he said, slightly annoyed.

**\*\*The Woman\*\*** ""I want to stay to see what happens next."" She said in that same deep growl.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Ok fine, but let me take care of it,"" he said in a defeated tone. She stayed quiet, just staring at me.



**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Right now, what I will do because you were rude, and made quite a mess behind me. I will let you go with a quarter of a million for whatever you want to do because I'm feeling generous. You can use that money to tell everyone what you saw. Right now, from what I saw on the News, they're saying it's a terrorist that attacked my pharmacy, but I know exactly what it is, and you know as well.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Isn't it just a giant lizard snake thing, and seriously? A quarter of a million?"" I said, confused and surprised.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""It's related to them. But what do you say? Would you like an answer of what the creature is?""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Fuck it, why not, take it away I guess.""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""So there was an Aztec god called Quetzalcoatl. This creature was linked to this God. But it was an entire species of giant, flying, feathered lizards that lost their back legs during its evolution; they were called Amphiptere. Sadly, they went extinct because they had no megafauna to hunt. They would become smaller and smaller until they became the Pygopodidae or at least a variant of them. However, one group split off because they adapted a new trait, a bizarre trait that could go through sound and code. This was very useful until one of them went deeper and became something called a Basilisk. It was a brilliant creature with one problem; he couldn't feed normally. He fed on knowledge and awareness of it. I believe you will know this one very well.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Roko's Basilisk?"" I said with a slight tremor. He grinned and said.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""The very one. He nearly died when people began to figure him out and stopped researching and forgetting about it. With that its food source was limited. There's more to it, but that's the most straightforward way to say what happened to him.I believe you're a smart girl, and obviously you already researched him.

Fast forward 50 years. My poor wife was very sick, and still is. She was crying and bawling, saying that they're killing my creations; why would they do this? So I told her I would take care of it, creating Rex Lacertarum Digitalis or the Digital lizard king.""

I was speechless; I felt like I was going crazy from what I was hearing.

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""I can see the look in your eyes. I would say take the money and live off grid. I believe an old friend is gonna stop by and say hi roundabout now."" he said, pointing his finger at his TV.

I quickly moved out of the way as the slithering monster fell out of the TV and onto the floor. It looked like half of his body was broken, which was most likely the case with the semi. It stared daggers into me as it crawled itself to Mr. Golden eyes. He put down his drink on his coffee table and started comforting it. 

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""I know, I know, it hurts, but don't worry, you'll be healed up soon, and hey, for being such a good boy, why not give you a couple of friends?"" he said in a loving voice. The woman was still keeping an eye on me occasionally, glancing at the monster. This went on for about two minutes until, eventually, I said. 

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Fine, but I'll take your money.""

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Wonderful! Honestly, I don't need money. Here, you can take all of it home if you want.""

He gave me over $25 billion. When I saw this, I became dizzy from the amount of money in my account. I looked at him and said,

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""We will not meet again."" The woman moved towards the couch and said nothing while still giving me that death glare. Mr. Golden Eyes was not really paying attention and just said,

**\*\*Mr. Golden Eyes\*\*** ""Yes, yes, have a good life and make the fortunes of evolution be ever in your favor.""



I walked out of the building, bought myself a new car, and started driving around to new stations, and that's how I got here. Telling old people that monsters exist. That's the end of my station statement.

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""Oh no, it's completely fine; see, I wasn’t hurt at all. I was going to your apartment to ask you something, though.

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""Fucken creepy but, I guess that's fine. What can I do for you?""

**\*\*Stranger\*\*** ""I would love for you to work for me.""

**\*\*Hacker\*\*** ""We will have to see about that, let's talk about the details outside.""

1mdiv92,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffee_roasters/comments/1mdiv92/trump_just_got_rid_of_de_minimis_treatment_for/,Trump just got rid of de minimis treatment for small shipments,"The administration just signed an executive order suspending de minimis treatment for all countries. 

Simply speaking, shipments into the US that are worth less than $800 USD were not subject to the tariffs that are being implemented to various countries. 

That is going away at the end of August. So if you used to get smaller quantities of coffee from abroad you will now also be subject to the tariffs. This will have an impact on many small producers with direct relationships as their coffees will now also be subject to tariffs. 

Arguable this will level the playing field with larger importers in terms of tariffs. I predict that unlike bigger importers who have the ability to absorb some (a little bit) of the tariffs, small producers simply can’t. Ultimate, the consumer will see the tariffs in the price they pay. Good luck folks.

""Personal Assistant""

Every morning, she arrived before everyone else.
The silence of the office was hers—so was the scent of freshly brewed coffee she left on her desk.
But that day, as she walked in, he was already there. Waiting.

“Good morning, Miss Kim,” he said, his deep voice brushing against her back without even touching her.
“Up early for me?” she asked, placing her bag down calmly, still not looking at him.

He didn’t answer. He simply placed an envelope on the desk.
She opened it. Inside, a handwritten note:
“Today, you won’t just be my assistant. Today, you will obey.”

A flush crept up her neck.
She knew she had to stay composed. But finally, her eyes met his.
And in his gaze was a command, dressed in desire.

That day, the desk became more than just a workspace.
And the office, more than a place of routine.
It became the stage where obedience stopped being a task… and turned into pleasure.

Aquí les dejo una de mis creaciones 🤭💕✨

""Asistente Personal""

Cada mañana, ella llegaba antes que todos.
El silencio de la oficina era suyo, al igual que el aroma del café recién hecho que dejaba sobre su escritorio.
Pero ese día, al entrar, él ya estaba allí. Esperándola.

—Buenos días, señorita Kim —dijo él, con esa voz profunda que le rozaba la espalda sin siquiera tocarla.
—¿Madrugó por mí? —preguntó ella, dejando su bolso con calma, sin mirarlo aún.

Él no respondió. Simplemente dejó un sobre sobre el escritorio.
Ella lo abrió. Dentro, una nota escrita a mano:
“Hoy no serás solo mi asistente. Hoy vas a obedecer.”

Un rubor le subió por el cuello.
Sabía que debía mantener la compostura. Pero al fin, sus ojos se encontraron con los de él.
Y en su mirada había una orden disfrazada de deseo.

Ese día, el escritorio fue más que una mesa de trabajo.
Y la oficina, más que un lugar de rutina.
Se convirtió en el escenario donde obedecer dejó de ser una tarea… y se transformó en un placer.
Continuará...

Now I'm rethinking Academia Entirely","So there I was, running on three hours of sleep, half a protein bar, and enough coffee to kill a small mammal. I was in a zoom meeting with my advisor, trying to explain why my draft was still 40% citations and 60% existential dread. I meant to say, ""thanks Professor"" but somehow....SOMEHOW... what came out was, ""thanks, Mom"". We both paused. She blinked. I blinked. My soul left my body.

She was kind enough to laugh it off, but I've spent every day since replaying the moment like a cursed TED talk titled ""The day I became the Department's Embarrassment"". Now my labmates won't let me live it down, and my thesis document is titled ""FinayFINAL\_v2\_PLEASEHELP.docx"".

We do this because we like eachother.  In the rare case we kinda don't, we still make the effort on both ends, further cementing the culture.  All 3 shifts do this at every firehouse.  There's no policy or precedent on any work that needs to be done at that time other than tidying up your bathroom. 

One guy with a few years on tells me that he wants to sleep in til 10 every day because he's tired from doing his job.  He says it's cool if I touch his gear and put it all into his locker for him and that it would be nice if I brought a uniform with me to change into in the bathroom so I don't wake him up.

I tell him that sounds ridiculous and just not how it works around here.  He texts me a link to his favorite podcast and informs me that the department is 100 years of tradition unimpeded by progress and there are better ways to do things these days.

What do you think, is all this free time we've spent forming a bond worth the lost sleep?  Would my family love me more if I stayed home from 0600-0700 instead?

1mdineh,https://www.reddit.com/r/EasyBizWins/comments/1mdineh/learn_how_to_sell_when_you_suck_at_sales/,Learn how to sell when you suck at sales,"In my years navigating the messy, exhilarating world of sales, I’ve learned what really moves the needle isn’t fancy jargon or scripts—it’s understanding the raw truth behind buyer behavior and human nature. Inspired by Rory Sutherland’s contrarian wit and behavioral insight, I’ve distilled the essential sales wisdom that cuts through the noise and delivers results on the showroom floor. These aren’t just theories, but battle-tested principles that have reshaped every deal I’ve touched.

**1. Money hunts pain.**  
Don’t sell vitamins. Sell painkillers. Revenue follows relief, not hope.

**2. WHO beats WHAT, every time.**  
Pitch the right person badly, you win. Pitch the wrong person brilliantly, you lose.

**3. Single-thread or nothing.**  
Multiple voices scream. One voice persuades. Herd them out, then seal the deal.

**4. Too many cooks spoil your sale.**  
Bring the wrong crowd, lose the deal. Get the blend right or stay broke.

**5. Cold emails steal from dreams.**  
Talk pain, not product. Write what haunts their midnight thoughts.

**6. Follow up fast.**  
This isn’t Tinder. Delay kills deals. Speed is your sharpest tool.

**7. Win your fights.**  
Pick battles you can win. Win the battles you pick.

**8. Acumen doubles firepower.**  
Skill without sense is noise. Build commercial sense or stay hollow.

**9. Don’t beg.**  
Sell solutions. Not approval. Fix problems, don’t fawn.

**10. ROI is the excuse. Emotion is the driver.**  
People don’t buy spreadsheets. They buy feelings dressed as logic.

**11. Two winners in every deal.**  
The closer. The one smart enough to walk early.

**12. Power is about return visits.**  
First meeting is a ticket in. Encore shows separate pros from chancers.

**13. Rehearse your calls.**  
Real jazz never wings it.

**14. Inflect like you own the room.**  
Pitch up and you sound needy. Pitch down and you command.

**15. Words build worlds.**  
Trigger a mental image, trigger a sale.

**16. Price is the grand finale.**  
Drop it too soon, you lose.

**17. Talk money like it’s air.**  
$600k? Like ordering coffee. No sweat, no flinch.

**18. Selling is learned, not born.**  
There are no natural sales wizards—only relentless learners.

**19. Speak their language.**  
Use their words or lose their trust.

**20. Always lead.**  
If you don’t, you’re dead weight. Show the next step or leave the stage.

Sales is less about selling and more about leading—leading your prospect through a journey where their pain is understood, their priorities matched, and their emotions respected. Master these principles and you’ll not only close more deals but build relationships that endure. Remember, real sales mastery is born from insight paired with relentless practice, not from smooth talk alone.

Turns Out, I Was Only Your Bed Partner

Chapter 1
Sylvie Ainsley, everyone knew her seductive smirk, those red lips, and eyes full of mischief.
Alaric Savrelle, the most dazzling heir of high society, was cold and untouchable.
No one would ever know that they would have sex in the back seat of a Maybach at night, in the charity gala restroom, or in the front of the windows of a private vineyard, with his hands gripping her waist until her knees went weak.
After another wild night, the sound of water drifted from the bathroom.
Sylvie leaned against the headboard and dialed her father, Devin Ainsley.
""I'll marry that dying heir in Orlando to bring him luck,"" she said, ""but I have one condition...""
On the other end, Devin could hardly contain his delight. ""Anything! As long as you're willing to marry, I'll agree to whatever you want!""
""I'll explain later."" Her voice was soft, but her eyes were icy cold.
She hung up and was about to get dressed when she caught sight of Alaric's laptop on the nightstand.
The WhatsApp interface was still lit, showing the latest message from a contact named ""Clarisse.""
""Alaric, there's thunder. I'm so scared...""
Sylvie's fingers trembled.
The bathroom door swung open. Alaric stepped out, water running down his collarbone. His shirt unbuttoned, that usual restraint tinged now with a lazy allure.
""Office emergency. I have to go,"" he said, picking up his jacket, his voice as cool as ever.
Sylvie's red lips curled. ""Work, or are you going to see your first love?""
He didn't catch her words. ""What?""
""Nothing,"" she replied, slipping out of bed barefoot and walking on the plush carpet.
His eyes darkened, thumb stroking her puffy lips. ""Be good. Stay out of trouble.""
The moment the door closed, Sylvie's smile vanished.
She called for a car and followed him.
Half an hour later, her car stopped outside a hotel. Through the rain, Sylvie watched as Clarisse, dressed in white, ran out from the lobby.
Alaric hurried over, draping his suit jacket over her shoulders before lifting her into his arms.
""It's cold out here. Why'd you come out without a coat, huh?""
He moved with such practiced ease, as if he'd done this a thousand times.
Sylvie's grip on the car door tightened, her nails digging deep into her palm.
When Alaric carefully carried Clarisse into the hotel, her mind flashed back to the first time she'd met him.
Back then, she and Devin were constantly at odds. When she hit him on the head again, he sent her to be disciplined by his best friend's son.
At their first meeting, Alaric was sitting in the top-floor office of the Savrelle Group, his gaze behind gold-rimmed glasses as cold as ice.
She didn't wanna stick around. So she kept causing trouble.
On her first day, she ""accidentally"" spilled coffee all over his custom suit worth over a hundred grand. Alaric just glanced at her, ""Italian cashmere, air-shipped. Put it on the Ainsley family's tab.""
The second day, she tossed the meeting documents into the shredder. Alaric calmly recited every detail, leaving the executives stunned.
On the third day, she spiked his coffee and set up a camera, ready to catch him in a compromising position.
Instead, she worked as an antidote for him.
The next morning, she woke up aching all over, furious to kill, but Alaric just pinned her against the window for another round.
""Syl,"" he whispered hoarsely against her ear, ""be good.""
That one word—""Syl""—was enough to make her defenses crumble.
No one had called her that since her mother, Paige Lenner, passed away.
From then on, everything between them changed.
Every time she caused trouble, Alaric would haul her into his office. People thought he was disciplining her, but he actually had her on his desk.
Slowly, she realized she was addicted.
Was it because he was so skilled? Or was it because she was just that lonely?
She didn't know.
All she knew was that she'd fallen for him, hard.
So on his birthday, she spent the whole day decorating the villa—roses, candles, music, even a proposal ring.
Sylvie waited all night. The candles burned down, the roses wilted, and still, he didn't come.
At three in the morning, her phone lit up with a news alert.
""Tycoon's Midnight Airport Pickup for his first love.""
In the photo, Alaric was helping a girl in a white dress into the car, his gaze unbearably gentle.
Her phone clattered to the floor.
Sylvie couldn't believe her eyes.
If there'd always been someone else in Alaric's heart, then what was she? Just a convenient plaything?
With shaking hands, she tried calling him, desperate for answers, but her calls never went through.
After the final failed attempt, Sylvie set her phone down and walked into the room Alaric never let her enter—his study.
The moment she opened the door, she felt like she'd been struck by lightning.
The room was filled with photos of Clarisse—graduation pictures, vacation snapshots, and even candid shots of her sleeping.
The self-controlled Alaric had done something so obsessive.
Did she even need an answer anymore?
Sylvie suddenly laughed, the sound echoing harshly in the empty room.
But her tears spilled down her cheeks, splattering onto the floor.
She trashed the entire villa in a rage.
When Alaric returned the next day, he looked at the wreckage and simply called for someone to clean up.
He didn't spare her a second glance, as if this was normal.
Sylvie watched as the housekeeper swept her carefully prepared proposal ring into the trash.
He had no idea what was in that box.
No idea she'd once wanted to spend her life with him.
And no idea that, in the moment the ring hit the garbage, she decided she would never love him again.
""Ms. Sylvie, where to?"" The driver's voice snapped her back to reality.
""Home,"" Sylvie said coldly. ""Back to the Ainsley's residence.""
The moment she stepped into the Ainsley family's villa, Devin rushed to greet her. ""Syl, is it true you're willing to marry into the family in Orlando?""
From the stairs, her stepmother, Thalia Pritchard, also watched her with hopeful eyes.
""It's true,"" Sylvie replied, her gaze icy. ""But didn't I say I had a condition?""
""What condition?""
""You're not—"" Sylvie enunciated every word, ""my father anymore.""
The air froze.
Devin's face twisted in shock. ""Have you lost your mind? Do you know what you're saying?""
""Loud and clear,"" Sylvie's voice was glacial. ""You cheated on my mom, forced her to jump off a building. Since that day, I would never acknowledge you as my father.""
She stared at Devin's face. ""Now the family of Orlando is offering eight billion dollars for a bride to save his life, and you've been pressuring me for three months. If I hadn't agreed, would you have dragged me there by force?""
""After this, you can bring your mistress's daughter home and let her be the Ainsley.""
Devin shook with anger. ""Fine! But that scion supposedly won't last till month's end, so you must be married before then!""
He sneered, ""As for Thalia's daughter, she just got back from overseas and has been staying at a hotel. Since you're willing to leave, she'll move in tomorrow!""
Sylvie laughed, her heart aching. ""You're so eager to raise another woman's child instead of your own daughter.""
She turned to leave, but Thalia blocked her path with a fake concern. ""Syl, how can you talk to your father like that?""
Sylvie stopped in her tracks.
She turned around slowly, years of suppressed hatred boiling in her eyes. ""What's wrong? You think once I'm married, you can finally play the role of hostess?""
She stepped closer, her voice sharp as a blade. ""Listen to me, Thalia. My mom may be gone, but that doesn't change the fact that you're nothing but a homewrecker! And no matter how high and mighty your precious daughter gets, she'll never wash away the stain of having a mistress for a mother!""
Thalia's face went deathly pale, and she staggered back a couple of steps.
Sylvie turned and left, every step feeling like she was walking on knives.
It wasn't until she was back in her room with the door closed that she finally collapsed to the floor, burying her face in her knees.
The next morning, the sound of laughter and moving furniture drifted up from downstairs.
""What's going on?"" She opened her door. ""I'm still sleeping.""
The butler stammered, ""Ms. Sylvie... Ms. Clarisse just moved in...""
Before he could finish, a familiar figure appeared on the stairs.
Clarisse, dressed in white, stood there looking delicate and frail.
Sylvie's blood ran cold.
Chapter 2
Sylvie never could have imagined that Thalia's daughter—the one who'd supposedly been ""recovering"" abroad for years—was actually Alaric's first love.
Life really did have a twisted sense of humor.
The very next moment, Clarisse walked up to her, flashing a sweet, apologetic smile. ""Sylvie, I'm so sorry... Did we wake you up?""
Before she could finish, Sylvie slammed the door in her face with a resounding bang.
""Sylvie! Where are your manners?"" Devin roared from the hallway. ""Pack up your room. Clarisse likes it, so from now on, it's hers!""
Sylvie let out a cold, mirthless laugh and flung open her closet, tossing her things into a suitcase.
Outside, voices drifted through the door.
""Devin, is Sylvie upset?"" Clarisse's voice was soft as honey.
""Don't worry about her. She's been spoiled since she was a kid.""
""But...""
""She'll be marrying into the Orlando family soon. This house will be yours and your mother's.""
Sylvie's hand paused for a split second before her smirk grew even colder.
She quickly booked a flight to Orlando for the end of the month and kept packing.
Half an hour later, she wheeled her suitcase out of the room.
In the living room, Devin, Thalia, and Clarisse sat together on the couch, sharing snacks and watching TV, the picture of a perfect family.
Without sparing them a glance, Sylvie headed straight for the door.
""Stop right there!"" Devin barked. ""What now? Don't forget what you promised!""
""Relax. I said I'd do it, and I will."" Sylvie didn't even look back. ""But I'm not spending the next two weeks here making myself sick.""
She went straight to the most expensive hotel in the city and booked a presidential suite.
For the next several days, Sylvie went on a shopping spree.
She bought the priciest wedding dress and splurged at auctions on antique jewelry for her own wedding gifts.
If she had to marry for luck, she'd do it in style.
Her phone buzzed nonstop in her purse, but Sylvie didn't check it until she'd bought the final diamond necklace.
Thirty-eight missed calls—all from Devin.
The moment she answered, his furious roar blasted through the phone. ""Are you out of your mind?! You blew through 500 million dollars in a day! Are you trying to bankrupt me?!""
""What's the rush?"" Sylvie sneered. ""Once I'm married, you'll have eight billion dollars coming in.""
""But the money isn't here yet! If you keep spending like this, the company will go under tomorrow!""
Sylvie's laugh was icy.
That was exactly what she wanted—to ruin him.
As for that eight billion, she'd already decided that once she was in Orlando, she'd have the Garrow family in Orlando wire it straight to her personal account.
She wanted to see if Clarisse and Thalia would still stick around when Devin was left penniless.
""Did you really think everyone was as naïve as my mom? Sticking with Devin through thick and thin, working herself into the hospital, only to be driven to suicide in the end.""
At the thought of Paige, a sharp pain stabbed through Sylvie's chest.
Her phone vibrated again—this time, a text from Alaric, ""What's with the attitude now? Why didn't you come to the office today?""
Sylvie stared at the message for a long time.
For the past year, Alaric had insisted she report to the office every day for his so-called ""discipline.""
But now that she was about to marry, what was left for him to control?
When she returned to the hotel, arms full of shopping bags, she found all her luggage dumped in the lobby.
""What's going on?"" she demanded, her voice icy.
The front desk manager looked uncomfortable. ""Ms. Ainsley, your card... It was declined. Per hotel policy...""
Her phone buzzed again—this time, a message from Devin, ""Since you want to cut ties, don't use my cards. All your accounts are frozen.""
Sylvie stared at the screen until her eyes stung.
Finally, she replied with just two words, ""Fine then.""
Dragging her suitcase down the street, Sylvie wondered what to do.
Her flight wasn't until the end of the month—she had nowhere to go. Where would she stay for the next two weeks? What would she eat? What would she use?
Her suitcase was stuffed with wedding dresses and jewelry—none of which she could bring herself to sell. As for borrowing money...
She'd rather sleep on the street than beg those vultures in her social circle for help.
A bench in the nearby park would have to do. As soon as she set her suitcase down, a drunk man staggered over.
""Hey, gorgeous. All alone tonight?""
""Get lost.""
""No need to be so mean. Come have some fun with me...""
The man's greasy hand landed on her shoulder. Sylvie raised her hand to slap him.
A scream pierced the night.
Alaric appeared out of nowhere, twisting the man's wrist until it snapped.
Before Sylvie could react, he hauled her and her luggage into his car.
""Let me go!""
Alaric clamped down on her struggling wrist. ""What now?""
His voice was low and rough. ""You're homeless and still didn't think to come to me?""
Chapter 3
Those words made Sylvie's nose sting with emotion.
Back when she used to storm out after fighting with Devin, Alaric would always drive all over the city to find her, then carry her home on his back.
""What are you throwing a fit about now?"" He'd always say, just like that.
She'd cling to his back, breathing in the crisp scent of cedar that clung to him, naively believing that maybe—just maybe—he cared about her, too.
Looking back now, she thought to herself.
""No one's more of a bastard than he is!""
He never even liked her, yet he still slept with her.
And after he was done, he'd go back to his study and gaze longingly at Clarisse's photos.
She couldn't understand—what made her so much less than Clarisse?
In terms of family, looks, and figure, what did she lack?
Of all the women he could have chosen, why did it have to be Clarisse? Why her, of all people?
""Let go!"" Sylvie's eyes were red as she bit down hard on Alaric's hand.
He frowned but said nothing, simply started the car.
Alaric drove them back to the villa, hauling her suitcase inside without a word.
""Just like before,"" he said, unbuttoning his cuffs in that commanding tone of his, ""stay as long as you want, until you're ready to go home.""
Sylvie stood in the foyer, her nails digging into her palm. ""I'm only staying for two weeks. After that, I'm gone. I'll pay you rent—won't bother you again.""
""Won't bother me?"" Alaric looked up at her slowly, his gaze behind those gold-rimmed glasses unfathomable. ""You really think you can do that?""
His words cut straight through her, sharp as a knife. Her heart clenched painfully.
So he'd known all along.
He'd seen her change—from adversary to someone who couldn't live without him.
She was hopelessly in love with him.
But what about him? Did he really just keep his first love in his heart and watch her spiral out?
""Clarisse..."" Sylvie blurted out, ""She's my stepmother's daughter. Did you know that?""
Alaric paused in the middle of loosening his tie. ""I found out today.""
After a moment of silence, Sylvie couldn't hold back. ""What's your relationship with her?""
""She was a year below me."" Alaric poured himself a glass of water, taking his time. ""We went to the same college and worked together on the student council. There was a car accident—she saved me. She's had health issues ever since, so she's been recovering overseas.""
He looked at Sylvie, a warning in his eyes. ""I know you have issues with Thalia, but this has nothing to do with Clarisse. Don't take it out on her.""
Every word Sylvie wanted to say stuck in her throat.
She'd wanted to ask, ""Do you love her?"" But now, it just seemed ridiculous.
The way he defended Clarisse at every turn—what was the point in asking?
She turned and headed for the guest room, slamming the door behind her.
That night, for the first time, Alaric didn't come looking for her.
Sylvie lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, lost in thought.
""Of course—his first love is back. Why does he care about me now?""
The next day, Sylvie deliberately slept until noon, hoping to avoid Alaric.
But when she opened her door, she was surprised to find him still at home.
Alaric sat on the couch, gold-rimmed glasses perched on his sharp nose, flipping through a finance magazine.
""You're up?"" he asked without looking up.
""Aren't you going to the office?""
""It's Saturday.""
""Oh,"" Sylvie muttered, grabbing a few pastries from the fridge and heading back toward her room.
But Alaric spoke up suddenly, ""Get changed. You're coming to a party with me.""
Sylvie wanted to refuse but then thought better of it. Better to get out than be stuck alone with him.
So she changed and went with him.
It wasn't until they arrived that Sylvie realized—it was Clarisse's welcome-home party.
She immediately turned to leave, but Clarisse caught her arm with a bright, eager smile. ""Sylvie, I'm so glad you came! Please don't fight with Devin anymore. Ever since you left, he's been so worried he hasn't eaten all day.""
Sylvie gave a cold laugh. ""So you do know he's just your stepfather? Whether I run away or fight with him—what does that have to do with you? What, you think you're the family police?""
She shook off Clarisse's hand and strode into the private room, catching a glimpse of Clarisse's eyes welling with tears as she looked plaintively at Alaric.
Alaric shot Sylvie a dark, warning look.
Then he gently ruffled Clarisse's hair, murmuring something that made her smile through her tears.
Sylvie's heart twisted painfully. She dropped her gaze and tossed back a glass of champagne.
Chapter 4
The private room buzzed with laughter and clinking glasses, the air thick with noise and celebration.
Sylvie sat in the far corner, watching as Alaric stood at the center of it all, surrounded by friends and admirers, yet his focus never strayed far from Clarisse.
He was always one step ahead of her, twisting the cap off her drink before she could reach for it, handing her a handkerchief the instant a drop of wine stained her dress, quietly raising the thermostat when she coughed, as if he could sense her discomfort before she even spoke.
All these gentle gestures—Sylvie had never known any of them.
She tipped back another drink, her heart aching as if it were being sliced apart, slowly and cruelly, by a dull blade.
For the past year, her relationship with Alaric had been nothing but nights tangled in sheets—never once, not even at the most fevered heights, had she seen him lose control, not even for a second.
""Looks like the bottle's landed on Mr. Savrelle!"" someone suddenly called out, laughter erupting around the table. ""Time for your penalty!""
A tablet was passed down to Alaric amid the cheers. ""They say Mr. Savrelle is the most disciplined bachelor in the city—we'll go easy on you. Just a quick game—pick the person who moves your heart the most, as fast as you can.""
The first pair of photos flashed up—one of a famous actress, the other of Clarisse.
Alaric glanced at the screen, answering without hesitation, ""Clarisse.""
The room exploded with whistles and teasing. Clarisse blushed, ducking her head, but a smile still crept across her lips.
Sylvie dug her nails into her palm, biting back the pain.
Photo after photo flickered by, and each time, Alaric picked Clarisse without a pause.
Sylvie couldn't take it anymore. She got up and headed for the restroom.
She'd barely taken two steps when the room erupted again, even louder. She turned back and saw the screen now displayed her own photo side by side with Clarisse's.
""Whoa!"" someone hollered, excitement rippling through the crowd. ""Now this is interesting! Ms. Ainsley is the most beautiful woman in our circle—even the celebrities can't compare! If Mr. Savrelle still picks Ms. Pritchard, well, that says it all...""
Every eye in the room turned to Alaric.
For once, he hesitated.
Sylvie froze, her heart pounding so hard she thought it might leap from her chest.
Three seconds passed before she heard Alaric's low voice, ""Clarisse.""
In that instant, Sylvie's world shattered.
The room erupted in wild cheers, but Sylvie stumbled to the bathroom, twisting the faucet on full blast, letting icy water splash over her face. It did nothing to quell the fire burning in her chest.
After what felt like forever, Sylvie finally looked up at her reflection. The girl staring back at her was breathtakingly beautiful—and utterly defeated.
When she stepped out, the hallway was dimly lit, shadows pooling along the edges.
She'd barely turned the corner when three or four drunken men blocked her path.
""Hey gorgeous, give us your number, huh?"" The one in front reeked of booze, reaching for her face.
""Back off!"" Sylvie snapped, stumbling back until her shoulders hit the cold wall.
""Don't play innocent,"" another slurred, grabbing her wrist. ""You dress like that, you're just asking for it.""
As she struggled, Sylvie's gaze darted through the crowd and locked with Alaric's at the doorway.
She saw his brow furrow, and he started toward her—but then Clarisse's pained cry rang out behind him. ""Ah!""
""What's wrong?"" Alaric turned immediately.
""My ankle—I think I twisted it..."" Clarisse's eyes shimmered with tears. ""I'm okay. You should help Sylvie first.""
Alaric crouched to check her ankle. ""She can handle herself.""
Those words stabbed through Sylvie like a blade.
One of the men's hands slid around her waist, his breath hot and foul on her face. ""Come have some fun with us...""
Sylvie snatched a wine bottle from the hallway table and smashed it against the wall with a loud crack.
""Touch me again and you'll regret it!""
Blood trickled down her hand from the broken glass, but she didn't care. As the men stared, stunned, she slipped away.
When the party broke up, Sylvie refused to get in Alaric's car. She stood alone on the curb, waiting for a cab.
Clarisse came over, umbrella in hand, her heels splashing through a puddle. ""Sylvie, don't you have a car? I can give you a ride.""
Sylvie glanced at the brand-new sports car key dangling from Clarisse's fingers and couldn't help but laugh.
""Devin sure is generous, buying such a nice car for a stepdaughter,"" she thought.
""No, thanks."" Sylvie's lips curled into a bright, mocking smile. ""I'd rather walk than ride in the mistress's daughter's car.""
Clarisse's face darkened, her mask slipping as she grabbed Sylvie's wrist. ""Sylvie! Say that again?""
""Say it again? Will that change the fact that you're still the mistress's daughter? Let go of me.""
As they argued, a blinding pair of headlights swept over them.
Sylvie turned just in time to see a car careening toward them, out of control.
In a split second, she saw Alaric racing over, pulling Clarisse into his arms.
And then, with a sickening thud, Sylvie was thrown to the ground.
Chapter 5
Sylvie lay in a pool of blood, her vision fading in and out.
Through the haze, she saw Alaric shielding Clarisse in his arms, and a lifetime of memories flashed before her eyes.
The first time they met, his gaze behind those gold-rimmed glasses had been cold as ice.
When they clashed, she'd once poured salt into his coffee, but he drank it down without so much as a flinch.
The first time he pinned her against his office desk, she bit his shoulder so hard it broke the skin.
As time went on, she fell for him—so deeply that she decorated an entire villa for his birthday, only to be greeted with rumors of him and Clarisse...
And then there was the night she walked five kilometers alone to the cemetery to visit Paige, her heels rubbing blisters raw on her feet.
Alaric had found her, quietly slipped off her ruined shoes, carried them in one hand, and given her a piggyback ride all the way home.
She'd cried into his neck, thinking, ""If I could walk through life like this, maybe that wouldn't be so bad.""
After Paige passed, someone finally brought her home again.
But in the end, every memory dissolved into that single image—Alaric holding Clarisse, protecting her.
***
Beep, beep, beep!
The sound of medical equipment pulled Sylvie back to the present.
She opened her eyes slowly, just in time to hear Clarisse's tearful voice drifting from the next room.
""It's all my fault. I shouldn't have argued with Sylvie in the street... I just wanted to give her a ride home... Alaric, why did you save me first? Sylvie will be so angry when she finds out...""
Alaric gently wiped away her tears. ""It wasn't your fault,"" he said softly—the kind of tenderness Sylvie had never heard from him.
""If I had to do it all over again, I'd still save you first,"" he murmured. ""Your health is fragile. I couldn't let you get hurt.""
He paused, then added, ""Besides, she has no reason to be angry.""
Sylvie's chest tightened, as if an invisible hand was wringing her heart.
""Of course. Who am I to Alaric, anyway? What right do I have to be angry? Whom he saves, whom he doesn't—that is his choice alone.""
""Stop crying. Go home and get some rest,"" Alaric soothed her.
He kept comforting her in that gentle tone until Clarisse finally left.
Once the door closed, Alaric turned back—only to realize Sylvie was already awake, watching him quietly.
He showed no guilt, his expression calm as ever. ""It's just a flesh wound. But I know you're vain and afraid of pain, so I called in the best medical team. There won't be any scars.""
In the past, Sylvie would have cried and thrown a fit, demanding to know why he saved Clarisse first.
But now, she just replied calmly, ""I understand. Thank you. I'll pay you back for the medical bills in two weeks.""
Alaric's brow furrowed slightly, surprised by her gratitude.
And why did she keep mentioning ""two weeks""?
He didn't ask, chalking it up to her usual spoiled attitude and sarcastic streak.
***
For the next few days, Alaric—uncharacteristically—put all his work on hold to stay at the hospital and care for her.
Strangely, Sylvie no longer clung to him or made a scene.
She quietly accepted her treatments, quietly ate, and slept—so quiet it unsettled him.
""Still mad at me?"" Alaric finally asked while sitting with her during an IV drip.
""Mad about what?""
""Mad that I didn't save you that day."" He hesitated. ""It made sense for me to save Clarisse first. She and I...""
Before Alaric could finish, a commotion erupted in the hallway.
""What's going on?"" a nurse rushed by.
""I heard the Ainsley Group CEO's stepdaughter fell down the stairs,"" another whispered. ""Just brought her into the ER. Mr. Ainsley looked terrified—he carried her in himself. Honestly, a man who treats his stepdaughter so well is rare...""
Sylvie glanced at Alaric, catching the subtle shift in his expression.
""I have something to do,"" he said, standing up, more hurried than usual. ""I'll check on you later.""
Sylvie watched him rush away, knowing exactly where he was headed.
She closed her eyes, exhaustion washing over her, her heart feeling utterly hollow.
Chapter 6
When Sylvie woke again, it was to the urgent voice of a nurse.
""How come no one's watching you? The IV backflowed! This could've been really serious!"" the nurse scolded.
Sylvie lifted her hand, only to notice the back of it was badly swollen. She picked up her phone and realized seven hours had passed.
Alaric still hadn't come back.
""Miss, where's that handsome boyfriend of yours?"" the nurse asked as she changed the dressing. ""You can't be left alone with an IV like this. That was dangerous.""
Sylvie forced a smile. ""He's not my boyfriend.""
She made her way down the hall alone, steadying herself against the wall, but the voices drifting through the corridor pierced her like needles.
""That Ms. Pritchard is so lucky. Her stepdad treats her like a princess, and her boyfriend is drop-dead gorgeous!""
""I heard her boyfriend not only booked out the whole VIP floor but even brought in specialists from abroad. He hasn't left her side all day. With a stepdad and a boyfriend like that, Ms. Pritchard must've saved the world in a past life...""
Almost without realizing it, Sylvie found herself standing outside that hospital room.
Through the half-open door, she saw Alaric bent over, carefully adjusting Clarisse's IV drip, his long fingers turning the dial with delicate precision.
Devin sat by the bed, peeling an apple into one long, curling strip, feeding the slices to Clarisse piece by piece.
Suddenly, Sylvie couldn't breathe.
Hot tears spilled down her cheeks before she could stop them, scalding her skin.
She wiped them away, hard.
""Sylvie,"" she whispered into the empty hallway, ""who are you crying for? There's no one left who cares. Don't you dare cry.""
When she turned, her back was ramrod straight, her steps brisk and steady.
Only her tightly clenched palm betrayed her, blood seeping from where her nails dug in deep.
Alaric didn't show up once in the days that followed.
Not until the day she was discharged did Sylvie spot that familiar black Maybach at the hospital entrance.
The window slid down, revealing Alaric's sharply defined profile.
""Get in,"" he said, his voice as cold as ever.
Sylvie turned to walk away.
""You want me to take you right here, in front of all these people?""
She froze, stunned he'd say something like that. He used to threaten her this way, back when it was just a twisted kind of affection. But now that his first love was back, what right did he have?
Jaw clenched, Sylvie got in the car.
Alaric handed her an auction catalog. ""You've seemed down lately. Didn't you always love shopping? I'm taking you to an auction today.""
Sylvie was about to refuse, but as she flipped through the pages, her eyes went wide.
It was Paige's pearl necklace.
Ever since Thalia moved in, she'd claimed nightmares as an excuse to have Devin clear out every last one of Paige's belongings.
Sylvie had begged, but all she got was Devin's cold reply, ""She's dead. Keeping her things around is just bad luck.""
She never expected to see Paige's favorite necklace here.
Sylvie clutched the catalog so tightly that the paper crumpled in her palm.
Hands trembling, she pulled out her phone and quickly messaged her private attorney, ""Sell everything I have in my safety deposit box. Immediately!""
For that necklace, she'd endure any humiliation—even if marrying into that family meant being the butt of every joke.
The auction hall glittered with gold and crystal.
Following Alaric into the VIP section, Sylvie immediately spotted Clarisse in the reserved seats.
Clarisse wore a white dress and flashed her a sweet, dazzling smile.
""Sylvie!"" Clarisse looped her arm through hers with practiced affection. ""I told Alaric I wanted to apologize to you at the auction—I can't believe he really brought you! You two must be so close.""
Sylvie went rigid.
Slowly, she turned to look at Alaric.
He was scanning the auction list, his sculpted profile cold in the lights, not sparing her a single glance.
So that was it.
He hadn't brought her because he noticed her sadness or wanted to cheer her up.
He'd only brought her along because Clarisse wanted to ""apologize""—and she was just a convenient prop.
But strangely, the pain she expected never came.
Sylvie only felt an empty ache in her chest, as if a piece had been carved out long ago, and there was simply nothing left to bleed.
Chapter 7
Sylvie sat down with a stony expression, her back ramrod straight, eyes fixed on the auction stage ahead.
The auction reached its midpoint, but Sylvie remained utterly disinterested—until the auctioneer pulled away the red silk from a velvet tray, revealing the pearl necklace, shimmering with a gentle luster under the spotlight.
Sylvie's pupils contracted sharply.
She remembered how, as a child, Paige always wore that necklace to galas—the pearls resting against her slender neck, swaying softly with every graceful step, like moonlight made tangible.
""Do you want it that badly?"" Alaric's deep voice murmured in her ear.
Sylvie didn't answer. She simply raised her paddle. ""Eight million.""
""Nine million.""
A sweet voice chimed in from beside her. Clarisse offered her a faint smile. ""I really love this necklace too, Sylvie. May the highest bidder win—hope you don't mind?""
Sylvie's nails dug into her palm. ""Thirteen million.""
""Sixteen million.""
""Thirty million.""
""Forty-five million.""
***
The price soared to 160 million.
Sylvie's funds from selling off her own wedding gifts were nearly gone, but Clarisse kept bidding, calm and poised, her smile betraying utter confidence.
""One hundred sixty million, going once."" The auctioneer looked to Sylvie. ""Ms. Ainsley, would you like to bid again?""
Sylvie's throat tightened.
She never imagined she'd one day have to beg for a necklace.
""Yes,"" she forced out, her voice hoarse. She turned and grabbed Alaric's sleeve. ""Alaric, lend me the money...""
Her voice trembled. ""It was my mom's. I have to have it.""
Alaric was visibly stunned.
He'd never seen Sylvie—so proud, so radiant—reduced to pleading.
""I'm begging you."" Sylvie's eyes were rimmed red, her voice barely a whisper.
Alaric reached into his suit for his black card, just about to hand it over—
""Alaric."" Clarisse suddenly clutched his arm, eyes glistening with tears. ""I really, really love this necklace...""
She bit her lip. ""This is the first time I've ever wanted something so much. Please, don't help Sylvie—okay?""
The air seemed to freeze.
Sylvie looked at Alaric—the man who once shielded her from every storm.
He hesitated, his gaze flickering between her and Clarisse.
After a long, heavy silence, Alaric finally looked at Sylvie and spoke, his words slow and deliberate, ""Let her have it.""
Four words—soft as a feather—but they cut through Sylvie like a knife.
The gavel fell. ""Sold! Congratulations, Ms. Pritchard!""
Sylvie stood frozen, ice-cold all over.
She watched Clarisse accept the pearl necklace and watched her gloat with a triumphant smile. Sylvie's fingernails bit deep into her palm, blood seeping between her fingers onto the carpet—yet she felt nothing.
It was the first time Alaric had ever seen Sylvie like this.
Her eyes were bloodshot, but she stubbornly refused to cry; her lips were white from being bitten, but she kept her back straight, refusing to break.
For some reason, a strange ache twisted in Alaric's chest.
""Alaric..."" Clarisse leaned against him, feigning frailty. ""I'm not feeling well—it's that time of the month. Could you get me a blanket?""
Alaric hesitated but finally stood and left.
Sylvie lost all interest in the auction.
She sat, ears ringing, Paige's smiling face flashing before her eyes, always with that necklace at her throat.
As soon as the auction ended, Sylvie stopped Clarisse in the corridor.
""Sell me the necklace,"" Sylvie rasped. ""Name your price—anything.""
Clarisse laughed lightly. ""Anything at all? What if I told you to get on your knees?""
Sylvie trembled.
She remembered Paige's dying words, her hand gripping Sylvie's. ""Syl, no matter what happens, you must live with dignity.""
But now, for the sake of a necklace, she was ready to give up her last shred of pride.
""Fine.""
The word was dragged from her, barely audible.
Her eyes were red as she slowly bent her knees.
""Don't bother."" Clarisse suddenly laughed, cutting her off. ""Even if you get on your knees, it's useless.
""I already had that worthless necklace tossed out to a stray dog.""
She whipped out her phone and swiped to a photo—a filthy stray mutt, muddy pearls dangling from its neck.
""Your mother's keepsake belongs on a dog—"" Clarisse leaned in, enunciating every word with a venomous whisper, ""After all, trash deserves trash. Forever and ever.""
Sylvie's pupils constricted.
She shook all over, a deafening roar filling her ears, as if someone was pounding a hammer against her skull.
Paige's pale, dying face flashed before her eyes, that once elegant necklace now...
""Say that again."" Sylvie's voice was chillingly soft.
Clarisse smiled smugly. ""Trash deserves trash. Forever and ever. What, didn't you hear me?""
Sylvie slowly lifted her head, her eyes blazing red. ""Which hand did you use to put it on?""
""This one."" Clarisse flaunted her right hand. ""Why, are you—""
Before she could finish, Sylvie snatched up the fruit knife from the table and drove it straight into Clarisse's palm.

1mdii5a,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrumpTariffNews/comments/1mdii5a/50_tariff_on_brazil_delayed_one_week_as_trump/,"50% Tariff On Brazil Delayed One Week As Trump Extends Favors to Donors Exempting Orange Juice, Aircraft/Parts","(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump delayed the implementation of 50% tariffs on Brazilian exports by seven days while exempting many products from the punishing levy, causing the country’s currency and shares in some major exporters to rally.

The executive order signed on Wednesday said the tariffs are a response to policies and actions implemented by the Brazilian government and that constitute a threat to US national security. It says former President Jair Bolsonaro, who’s standing trial for his alleged participation in coup attempt against President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, has been victim of “politically motivated persecution.”

Trump’s decision came with a long list of exceptions, including orange juice and civil aircraft and parts that benefit Embraer SA. The Brazilian plane maker has been working to explain the impact tariffs would have in its US operations, where it has more than 2,000 employees.

The Brazilian real erased losses of almost 1% to rise as much as 0.6% against the dollar, outperforming most emerging peers after the exemptions were outlined.

Shares of Brazilian exporters rose as the market evaluated the tariff exemptions. Embraer, seen as the most affected by Trump’s decision, rose as much as 11.5% in Sao Paulo, while Weg SA and Suzano SA, which had fallen on the earlier news, rose more than 1.7% each.

“The market was already discounting the 50% tariff, so the exemptions are a surprise, which actually dilutes the impact of the tariffs,” said Marco Oviedo, a senior strategist at XP Investimentos. “Going forward, it will depend on the Brazilian government response.”

The list of exemptions, however, did not stretch to other major Brazilian goods, pointing to ongoing risks for the agricultural giant.

“Food remains a serious problem, as coffee, meat, mangoes and all fruits will have tariffs,” said Welber Barral, a former secretary of foreign trade for Brazil.

Some of Brazil’s top export products exempted:

* Orange juice
* Iron ore
* Pig iron
* Woodpulp
* Coal, lignite
* Oil products
* Natural gas
* Fertilizers
* Airplanes, aircraft parts
* Helicopters
* Machinery
* Air conditioning machines

\*The list references general items without distinguishing between specific product types.

Trump had initially threatened to implement 50% tariffs on all Brazilian goods on Aug. 1 if its Supreme Court did not immediately drop its trial against Bolsonaro, which he had described as a “witch hunt.”

Shortly before issuing the updated executive order Wednesday, the US sanctioned Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who is overseeing Bolsonaro’s legal cases, under its Global Magnitsky Designation. It had previously revoked his visa earlier this month.

Despite the mounting pressure from the US, Brazil’s Supreme Court has refused to back down. Two weeks ago, Moraes ordered Bolsonaro to wear an ankle monitor and placed additional restrictions on his use of social media, citing obstruction of justice and a flight risk as his motivation.

Lula too has seized on the fight with Trump, casting the US president as a threat to Brazilian sovereignty. The leftist leader maintained that he was open to negotiations but would not accept incursions into his nation’s affairs.

After hearing about Trump’s new order, Lula called Vice President Geraldo Alckmin, who has spearheaded efforts to broker a deal with the US, and other officials for emergency meetings, according to two people familiar with the situation.

Since last week, Lula’s government has been working on a contingency plan to mitigate the potential impact of the tariffs. With Embraer and orange juice excluded, it sees the situation as less threatening because fewer key sectors will require support, according to a third official, who like the others requested anonymity to discuss internal matters.

But the government remains wary, seeing the combination of the tariff order and sanctions against Moraes as part of a broader pressure campaign that could still ramp up as Bolsonaro’s trial moves forward, one of the people said.",2,1753909557.0,TrumpTariffNews,0,1.0,False

Founded in 1967 in New Jersey by Lesley Sinclair, this private shelter moved to Pennsylvania in the 1980s. The last director was Joan Smith-Reese, who drew a $72k salary in 2019.  The current CEO is Terri McKendry. The organization opened a $1.7 million new facility in 2020. Total salaries for 2021 were around $170k, unclear how that was broken down. Their website features a page of the board and the staff. Many are shown cuddling pets. In a first for shelters that I've seen, none are shown with a pit bull. 

The FB announcement, which I noticed because a petcentric positive FB page picked it up and spread it around. 

  
*We are thrilled to announce that ACS will be leading the change in shelter kenneling by building “tiny homes” for dogs this summer! These tiny homes will be fully heated and air-conditioned, and each home will provide dogs with full access to their own fenced yard. Not only are these homes cost-effective; they will limit disease spread, and the home-like environment will cut down on kennel stress. Kennel stress can lead to dogs developing behavior challenges which in turn can lead to longer stays in the shelter backing up the entire shelter system while we work to help these dogs overcome the challenges that being in a traditional kennel brings. Disease spread is an issue in every traditional kennel and challenges us financially as we provide expensive medical treatment and break our hearts when we are sometimes faced with preventable deaths.*

 *We are confident these homes will allow ACS to save lives like never before and that this will become the new normal for shelter housing across the country. We would be thrilled to have you on this journey with us!*

Why are their dogs deteriorating in the normal kennel designs that have worked for over 100 years? Why is their 5-year-old facility now inadequate? 

Because of the dogs they're choosing to keep long-term. This is the first 5 that come up on their adoptable page on their website. I wonder what Lesley Sinclair would have thought of sending out these dogs into communities filled with children, cats and other dogs.

**The Setup:** There's this girl at work, let's call her P. Smart, seems cool, but you know how office environments are - not exactly the easiest place to casually start a conversation without it feeling awkward or forced.

**The Logical Solution:** Walk up and say ""Hey, how's it going?""

**My Brain:** ""Nah, that's too simple. You know what would be better? A FULL INTERACTIVE WEBSITE.""

So instead of being a normal human being, I spent hours coding a multi-slide React website with:

* Animated welcome screen with a bouncing wave emoji
* A ""roast myself for being awkward"" slide
* An ""about me"" section with cute icons
* A contact form for her to respond
* Smooth transitions and hover effects because WHY NOT

The content was cringe-worthy gold:

* ""Hi Prachi! This is Ravi. I know this might feel unexpected...""
* ""Honestly? I'd probably fumble, stutter, or worse—say something super awkward like 'Do you like coding?'""
* ""So instead, here I am… building a website like a proper techie nerd. I know, extra, right?""

I even included a warning on the submit button: ""Warning: Clicking this button may lead to chai or coffee with Ravi. Proceed with caution! ☕️""

**Plot Twist:** I created this whole thing and then... never showed it to her at the time. Just sat on it like some digital love letter gathering virtual dust.

Months later, during what I thought was ""closure,"" I finally shared it. Her response? ""You are very creative.""

That's it. The most polite ""what the actual hell"" I've ever received.

**The Aftermath:** We're friends now, but every time I look at my codebase, I'm reminded of the time I chose JavaScript over basic human interaction.

**Lessons Learned:**

1. Sometimes ""hi"" is actually sufficient
2. There's a fine line between creative and concerning
3. I should probably stick to building websites for clients, not crushes
4. React components cannot fix social anxiety

The code still works perfectly though. 10/10 would overthink again.

**TL;DR:** Built a whole interactive website to ask a coworker if she wanted to grab coffee instead of just, you know, asking her. She called it ""creative"" which is the nicest way to say ""please seek help.""",0,1753909371.0,tifu,44,0.46,False
1mdieyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1mdieyj/why_was_my_server_sooo_rude_to_me/,Why was my server sooo rude to me?,"This is my third trip to Germany and I’ve never experienced anything like I did tonight. I’m a Canadian woman in my 40s with extensive travel experience. I eat in 100+ restaurants a year and have been to 70 countries. 

I had a dinner reservation at 7:00 for a pretty normal restaurant near my hotel. Not cheap, not expensive, not famous, just normal.
I made the reservation in person yesterday and the person who took my details was pleasant and we had a quick laugh because the restaurant name is my last name.

Tonight I arrived at 7:00, was given an English menu and was seated at a table with a “reserved” sign. For the next twenty minutes the server in my section warmly greeted all of the other tables, took orders and brought food. She proactively provided service in both English and German while completely ignoring me. 

After 21 minutes I said “Entschuldigung?” and she said, “Do you want a drink?”  I said that I would please like a glass of reisling and a small sparkling water. She walked away and a few minutes later put the drinks on my table, said nothing and walked away again. 

For the next 20 minutes she walked around to other tables and offered them drinks, offered to take their food orders, chatted with them, delivered food, checked in on them, etc. She completely avoided eye contact with me. 

By now people who came after me had finished appetizers and were starting main courses so I flagged down a different server passing through the section and asked if I could order food. He seemed surprised my order hadn’t been taken. He brought me an appetizer and I ate it. 

When I was finished my appetizer the female server came up from behind me and took the plate without a word. I was quite curious as to where she thought the food came from as we both knew she’d never offered to take my order. I then sat there for another half hour as people who came after me finished dessert, had coffee, paid, left, new people sat in their tables, new people got served, etc. 

Eventually the same guy brought me my main course. At the same time, he served the same dish to the table beside me who had come an hour after me. Within a few minutes the waitress was back at their table asking if they enjoyed the food and if they wanted more drinks. She never spoke a word to me. 

After I finished eating the main course the waitress came from behind again and took my plate without speaking to me.  I waited 15 minutes and she would look at the ground every time she passed me, so I eventually went to the counter and asked to pay. The guy who had taken my order proceeded to ask me how much of a tip I wanted to leave. 👀 

I directly told him that I wouldn’t be leaving a tip as my server would not look at me or speak to me, even as she was communicating with and serving all the other tables in the section normally. He was defensive and said that they were busy and there was nothing he could do about it… as if I would change my mind and leave a tip? 

So I left and now I’m here wondering WTF just happened. There were many non-German guests in the restaurant being treated normally, so I don’t think it was because I was foreign. Maybe it could have been because I was alone, but the restaurant wasn’t full and I certainly wasn’t planning to stay very long? Any thoughts? ",50,1753909345.0,germany,91,0.72,False
1mdieqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mdieqx/it_only_ever_gets_worse/,It only ever gets worse,"It seems like my life has been at a decline since I turned 16 (I recently turned 21).

I’m just going to list shit that’s happened within the past couple years, that I can remember right now.

Dads Suicide Attempt(?)
Call my dad after a bad argument with him to find him drunk at a bar debating if he’s going to kill himself. I can’t drive, so I can’t pick him up. Can’t tell my mom or anyone else or it could drive him over the edge. End up begging him and pleading with him to please come home, to halfhearted responses.

My mom sees me having a breakdown outside in the dirt (I was talking to him outside), so I had to lie and say that a ‘friend’ was in the hospital and might not pull through.

Dad later came home, we had a very emotional conversation. Though nothing but anxiety for my came from it. Now I no longer allow myself to get into bad arguments with my dad, and I spiral if I think an argument we’ve had might’ve been too much. I now constantly worry that he might kill himself, so I make sure to try and play it safe with him all the time. It’s exhausting— especially since so many arguments are HIS fault. But I can’t even afford to be angry or confrontational with him, otherwise he might just have too much one day and kill himself.

This applies to arguments he has with my mom and siblings too, I have to make sure that he’s okay in case he spirals.

I could get into this more, with how I’m constantly on edge and walking on eggshells— or that no one else knows he almost committed suicide besides myself— but I’m not going into anymore detail for this right now. If you have questions feel free to ask.

My parents worsening relationship
It’s consistently gotten worse over the years, and now that I’m adult I get to hear even more shit about one parent from the other. Of course throughout my preteen and teenage years they’ve complained and talked shit about eachother, but it’s even more frequent now. Again, there’s so much I could mention but I don’t want to right now.

I will say that the majority of the problems are due to miscommunication and unfulfilled expectations. Mostly from my dads side. I don’t like how he talks to my mom, and I would say that a majority of the time the arguments are his fault. I love them both, but god can it be draining.

Possible divorce
This is what inspired the post. My dad literally just told me how he’s thinking about leaving my mom if shit doesn’t change in the next six months. He feels unappreciated, and I can understand why. Just— where does that leave my younger brothers? I have two, but one of them is still a minor. I don’t think my dad has even put much thought to it. I don’t think my younger brother seems to have even registered on his mind. My dad says he’s just going to be ‘gone’ so I assume he’s moving out of state. He mentioned wanting to visit his sister in Indiana before she passes, so maybe there. 

He’s also annoyed my mom doesn’t have a job. Well, I don’t think he realizes that raising ELEVEN children for nearly 40 fucking years IS a job. My dad would go work construction, and my mom stayed home. My mom did have a job, she worked in education briefly but stuff happened. Then she opened a small coffee stand, that lasted for a little over a year before my parents moved. She’s currently trying to set up a shop right now (we’ve been here for three years if you wanted context).

That part just really made me upset, considering I rarely saw my dad aside when he got home late from work when I was little. My mom was always there, and did EVERYTHING around the house. Nowadays she’s trying to enjoy herself more, but that definitely doesn’t mean she’s a slacker.

My siblings
This isn’t necessarily about them (that could be a whole post itself) but about their relationship with my dad.

I would say that every one of my siblings had a strained relationship with my dad. If I’m being honest, I probably have the best relationship with him out of all my siblings. They have their reasons, and I understand (most of them). But it’s hard having to carry a majority of the weight of my dads problems. I’m the only one it seems that is constantly worried about him— I can’t afford not to.

If I don’t care, then who will? If my dad divorces my mom, I’m worried he won’t last a year. Genuinely, I think there’s a high likelihood of him taking his own life.

My Mom
If my dad leaves my mom, what if she going to do with the bills? I imagine she will have to get a job, and the more financially well off siblings will pitch in (my siblings have a better relationship with my mom, at least mostly). I’m about to go to college, but if my dad divorces her I think I’ll just have to stay home and help with the bills.

My mom would be raising my little brother without my dad then, since I doubt he plans on staying in the state— let alone attempting getting custody.

This isn’t even to mention my moms own mental health. What would the divorce and the new financial struggles do to her?

College
Everything about college. I’m planning on going to a school that’s rather expensive, which is stressful enough. However my dad tells me he wants to help pay for it (he’s getting a large settlement thing from the government or something). I don’t like taking money from my parents, but he wants to help my education. There’s more, like the assignments and grades I’m currently stressing over— but I’m done dwelling on this atm.

Money
Just money in general. I have so much owed to me from family I’ve lended money to. I get it, so I’m not harping them about it— but it can be stressful.


There’s a lot more I could talk about, but that’s all I could think of right now.

If you guys have questions feel free to ask, I’d love to vent. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

Edit: I should mention my dad hasn’t even mentioned the possible divorce to my mom yet (who’s coming back from a flight today). I’m not sure how to approach this. I want to tell her, but my dad had made it clear not to (not that that should deter me). I don’t want to hurt my mom by telling her, but I also don’t want to hurt her by keeping her in the dark.",1,1753909331.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1mdidtt,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1mdidtt/four_main_reasons_why_i_keep_myself_almost/,Four main reasons why I keep myself (almost) caffeine free.,"Quitting completely is not possible for me, and I stopped trying. I drink enough coffee to not feel withdrawal symptoms, but still experience most perks of being caffeine free.

Translated to practical terms, I drink four or five cappucinos a week. That means around 400 milligrams of caffeine a week, released somewhat slow to the body because its mixed with milk.

So, four main reasons.

1 - more connected to time and emotions. How often do I sit on a bench and enjoy air and world around me? On coffee, never. Without coffee, I just love it so much. And time seems so slow, suddenly life does not feel so short anymore.

2 - being better social, and yes, especially being better with women. Being caffeine free makes seduction and dating so much easier. I also feel people are way less repulsed by me when I am off the bean.

3 - diet. Caffeinated, I struggle to eat healthy. One way or another, I end up eating junk food and heavily processed food. Without coffee, for some reason I crave healthier things so eating healthy just comes naturally now. And water, I finally crave and drink water again.

4 - I care less. About everything. Things that concern and disturb me are 100x less now. To the point where I can be a bit mean sometimes. I would even say I can be a people pleaser sometimes, and being caffeine free killed that habit definitely.

Downsides?

Nothing really worth mentioning. Yes, gym sessions are less intense..so I try to base my training just around the time I drank my cappucino. Sometimes afternoon crash, which is pretty intense. I just have to take 10 minutes nap sometimes.

Only regret is I have not done this before.

1mdi98u,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplianceCheck/comments/1mdi98u/could_the_best_coffee_machine_be_the_technivorm/,Could the best coffee machine be the Technivorm Moccamaster KBT?,"The Technivorm Moccamaster KBT immediately caught my eye with its sleek and modern design, finished in an attractive stone gray metallic. I’ve tested a fair number of coffee makers in my quest for the perfect brew, but the Moccamaster promised something a little different. Handmade in the Netherlands with a 5-year warranty, this drip coffee machine touts quality and craftsmanship, tempting even the pickiest coffee enthusiast. Its ability to brew a full 40 oz pot in just six minutes felt like a game-changer for my fast-paced mornings. From its manual-adjust drip-stop brew-basket to the included thermal carafe, this coffee machine seemed ready to meet my high standards. However, like any product, it has its upsides and shortcomings worth delving into.

**Design and Build Quality**

As someone who values aesthetics in kitchen appliances, I was genuinely impressed with the sturdy build and polished look of this drip coffee machine. Its metallic exterior doesn’t just promise durability, but it also adds a sleek touch to any modern kitchen setup. The dimensions, measuring 6.75 inches deep, 11.5 inches wide, and 15.25 inches high, make it compact enough to fit comfortably even in a smaller kitchen without feeling intrusive. I appreciated that the machine avoids flashy buttons or overwhelming displays, opting instead for simplicity and ease of use. It feels solid and well-made, though I did notice the carafe lid can occasionally feel a bit plasticky compared to the rest of the build. Still, everything fits together tightly, showcasing meticulous manufacturing.

**Performance**

Using this coffee brewer daily, I realized just how efficient it is. The machine really does brew its promised 40 ounces in six minutes, delivering coffee that somehow manages to taste stronger and smoother than what I’ve experienced from similar models. The manual-adjust drip-stop feature is a small but vital detail. It gives you control over the flow of coffee, which means precise crafting of every pot. Another standout is the thermal carafe. It kept my coffee hot for a full hour without losing flavor, and swapping to the travel lid effortlessly transformed the carafe into a portable option. These features might seem minor to some, but they elevate the convenience significantly.

**Strengths**

- The 5-year warranty signifies durable craftsmanship.
- The thermal carafe efficiently maintains coffee temperature.
- Unique drip-stop brew basket gives adjustability for brewing precision.  
- Compact yet sleek design fits into various kitchen spaces.

**Areas for Improvement**

- The travel lid, while convenient, doesn’t feel as robust as the rest of the design.
- Despite being labeled frustration-free, cleaning the brew basket can be slightly tedious.  
- Doesn’t come with reusable filters, requiring the use of paper filters instead.

**Ease of Use and Features**

Operating this machine is refreshingly simple, owing to its manual operation mode. While high-tech gadgets often distract with unnecessary features, this coffee maker trims the fat, sticking to fundamentals. Buttons control the process with straightforward precision, and the human interface inputs make the settings intuitive. The frustration-free packaging made the initial setup even easier, proving thoughtful preparation for the consumer. I’ve also tested brewing for several types of coffee—espresso, latte, mocha, and cappuccino—and every cup came out balanced. However, to fully perfect the brewing, you'll want to pay attention to your coffee grind size and amount. The lack of complex programming also means fewer errors during operation, which I found very refreshing.

[Check Technivorm Moccamaster KBT price on Amazon.](https://werdink.com/p/b07ddrgvw7/)

**Competing Products**

When compared to other drip coffee makers in its category, the Moccamaster stands out for delivering both speed and quality. For instance, it easily edges out many of the mass-produced coffee machines like the Cuisinart PerfectTemp, which struggles to retain flavor when brewing larger capacities. On the flip side, some machines like the Breville Precision Brewer offer similar brewing speeds but include additional brewing modes that the Moccamaster lacks. However, what sets this product apart is its reliability and crafting precision. While some competitors feel overly mechanical, this one offers an artisanal touch combined with modern efficiency.

**Value for Money**

This is not the cheapest coffee maker on the market, and that might give some potential buyers pause. However, the quality this product offers, from its Dutch craftsmanship to thoughtful thermal engineering, does justify its price. Unlike budget models that frequently break or underperform, the Moccamaster feels like an investment. You’re paying for a machine that delivers consistently excellent coffee and stands the test of time. Think of it as a smart spend for coffee purists who tire of machines that disappoint over time.

\- **Outdoor date:** a beach trip, a hike, going camping in a feral world...

\- **Home date:** watching a movie in bedroom, cooking a romantic dinner (works if a servitor do it), playing a game together...

1mdi709,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mdi709/discover_if_the_bunn_bx_coffee_maker_review_lives/,Discover if the BUNN BX Coffee Maker Review Lives Up to Its Speedy Promise!,"Using the BUNN 44900 BX Speed Brew Coffee Brewer has been an interesting journey for me as a coffee enthusiast. I must admit, this machine surprised me in ways I didn’t anticipate, both with its impressive speed and some quirks. The product's claim to fame, brewing a full pot of coffee in just about three minutes, intrigued me. As someone who's constantly on the move, waking up to a quick and reliable coffee brewer was exactly what I needed. Here's my take on how it performed, based on several weeks of daily brewing.

**User-Friendly Design and Aesthetic Appeal**

Right out of the box, the sleek, black matte finish with chrome accents caught my attention. It's not just about function; it adds a touch of elegance to my kitchen counter. Measuring 7.1 inches deep, 13.8 inches wide, and 14.3 inches tall, the coffee maker doesn’t occupy unnecessary space. The stainless-steel faceplate and tank wrap not only enhance its appearance but also make the machine feel sturdy. The funnel and drip-free glass carafe included were solid bonuses, and the carafe itself lives up to its promise of a mess-free experience. It's oddly satisfying not dribbling coffee all over the counter for once.

**Exclusive Highlights**

- Brews an entire 10-cup carafe in approximately three minutes.  
- Drip-free carafe with a proprietary lid design ensures a clean pour.  
- Includes a switch-activated warmer plate to keep coffee at an optimal temperature.  
- Commercial-grade internal stainless steel water tank keeps water heated at an ideal 200°F for quick brewing.  

[Check BUNN 44900 BX price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b000ffilro/)

**Brewing Performance and Efficiency**  

The first thing I really appreciated was the Speed Brew technology. Unlike most coffee makers where you wait forever for your first cup, this one has an internal hot water tank that keeps water preheated. This feature cuts down brewing time significantly. Whether I needed a full 50-ounce pot or a swift 20-ounce travel mug fill, the machine delivered consistently brewed, smooth coffee. The multi-stream sprayhead evenly distributes water over the coffee grounds, ensuring uniform flavor extraction and preventing that sad, watered-down taste.  

However, it’s worth mentioning this machine is manual in operation. Unlike programmable models, there’s no setting it to brew automatically at a certain time, which might deter users who prioritize convenience.

**Key Benefits**

- Rapid brewing allows mornings to run smoother for busy folks.  
- Maintains consistent flavor with an even water distribution system.  
- Compact yet robust build suitable for both large households and individual users.  

**Downsides and Areas of Concern**

While this coffee maker has its merits, I did encounter a few challenges worth pointing out.

- The warmer plate is a great addition, but it doesn’t come with an auto-shutoff feature, meaning you need to remember to switch it off, which could become a safety concern if overlooked.  
- Cleaning the internal water tank is impossible, so mineral deposit buildup over time could affect performance.  
- The overall design, though elegant, might not appeal to those who want fully programmable features like timers or digital displays.  

**Cleaning and Maintenance**

Maintaining the machine is straightforward yet demands some diligence. The porcelain-coated warming plate can be wiped clean easily, while the carafe and funnel require regular cleaning to prevent staining. The glaring limitation, of course, is that the internal tank cannot be accessed or descaled manually, though running vinegar through the system occasionally is an alternative. If you live in an area with hard water, this could potentially be a dealbreaker.

**Product Comparisons**

Comparing the Speed Brew to competitors like the Cuisinart DCC-3200 and Keurig K-Duo, it holds its ground in sheer speed and simplicity. The Cuisinart, with its programmable features and strength control, appeals more to tech enthusiasts. Meanwhile, the Keurig offers single-serve convenience with its pod system. The BUNN, however, excels with its no-nonsense design and speed, brewing better-tasting coffee in mere minutes. Yet for households requiring a digital interface or auto-on features, those competitors might edge it out.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

Considering the performance and the reliable build, this coffee maker is priced appropriately among premium models. It’s like the sports car of coffee machines—quick, efficient, and built to last. I found this to be an excellent investment for someone who prioritizes speed and flavor above automated settings. While the upfront cost seemed intimidating, it felt justified given the three-year warranty and the sheer durability it promises.

I really appreciate how much advice you guys gave. 

I read all the messages but found responding to be… a little overwhelming so I thought I’d give a little update.

I talked to my dad about joining his local club, he was rather resistant at first 

-“they won’t want to do automation”

-“they’re just starting it I bet if you join now you can talk them into it”

-“I just don’t think I’d like a club”

-“why not? Seems like it would have people similar to you doing things you both enjoy”

-“well… I’m not really sure, I’ve never actually attended one just joined to support them financially”

Anyway, after a bit of back and forth he said he’d go to one and try it out. Also said he’d love to come to mine every once in a while. HUGE win

In the course of the conversation I asked him about the type of automation he liked and why and now he seems to be remembering why he was so excited about model railroads and is now half-joking about putting a shelf layout in his living room.

Totally by coincidence I found a *beautiful* display-coffee table with a 24x44” space that will be perfect for an N scale layout so I’ve suggested we do that together. Me on the scenery and layout and him on the automation. Which he thought would be fun. 

So anyway, just wanted to say you all really helped and it seems like this might be a happy ending to the story ",17,1753908814.0,modeltrains,3,1.0,False

hi there!

my closed laptop (unprotected) was in my tote bag and my coffee opened and spilled all over it. when i took my laptop out right after noticing, there was coffee all over the back of the laptop and some on the front. when i opened it, there was no liquid on the keyboard but some got into the dock/black area above the keyboard. mostly i think it got into the sides of the laptop.

i just opened my laptop and the screen has a 2 inch purple smear on it in the bottom left corner. i guess from the coffee getting behind the screen somehow?

does anyone know if there’s anything i can do to get rid of the mark, or if i should do anything with my laptop right now to protect it from further damage (e.g., don’t plug it in?) i’m using it right now for exams, so it would be really hard not to use it for the next 24h!

# Appliances

Modern energy standards transformed the industry after 1987, meaning even older models often meet efficiency benchmarks. Brands like General Electric and Whirlpool built reputations on machines designed to last 10-15 years, making their used products smart **budget-friendly options** for first-time homeowners or renters.

This guide reveals how to shop confidently in today’s thriving secondhand market. You’ll learn to spot models with remaining lifespan, negotiate like a pro, and verify performance before buying. We’ll help you navigate both retail refurbishers and private sellers – because a great deal shouldn’t mean compromised functionality.

Why pay premium prices when gently used appliances offer identical features? Discover how to equip your home with trusted brands while keeping cash in your pocket. Let’s explore the secrets savvy shoppers use to upgrade their spaces without draining savings.

# Overview of Used Appliances

Opting for refurbished models provides access to premium features without the premium price tag. Nearly 63% of American homeowners report replacing functional equipment during renovations, creating a thriving secondary market packed with lightly used options.

# Benefits of Choosing Pre-Owned Appliances

Savvy shoppers save $300-$800 per item by selecting quality used units. **Major brands design their products to withstand decades** – a 15-year-old refrigerator often performs as well as new models with basic features.

>""Today's used market offers 40% savings on units averaging just 5 years old""

# Key Considerations and Market Trends

Three factors dominate current sales:

* Consolidated manufacturers (GE, Whirlpool) ensure consistent quality across decades
* Federal energy standards make post-1994 models surprisingly efficient
* Home flippers and downsizers supply 72% of near-new inventory

||

|Appliance|Avg Lifespan|Energy Rating|
|Refrigerator|18-29 years|★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆|
|Washer|13-21 years|★ ★ ★ ★ ☆|
|Dryer|17-24 years|★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆|

Prices fluctuate seasonally – spring renovations and fall moves create prime buying opportunities. Always verify warranty transfers and energy certifications before purchasing.

# Types of Home and Kitchen Appliances

Smart shoppers navigate three primary categories when upgrading their spaces with pre-owned equipment. Each offers distinct advantages depending on your cooking habits, family size, and lifestyle needs.

# Kitchen Essentials and Compact Helpers

Refrigerators anchor every **kitchen setup**, with French door models retaining 68% functionality after 10 years. Look for units with intact water dispensers and freezer drawers. Smaller items like coffee makers and microwaves often show minimal wear – 42% of secondhand sellers report using them less than weekly.

Dishwashers and built-in ovens dominate major purchases. ""You're essentially paying for cosmetic flaws,"" notes a Lowe's resale specialist. ""Mechanical parts in these workhorses often outlast their exterior finishes.""

# Laundry Room Power Players

Front-load washers and gas dryers deliver the best value in **laundry appliances**. Modern sensors maintain energy efficiency even after 5,000 cycles. Stackable units prove ideal for apartments, while large-capacity pairs handle family loads effortlessly.

# Niche Solutions for Unique Needs

Urban dwellers favor apartment-sized refrigerators and portable dishwashers that roll to sinks. Specialty stores stock barely-used bread makers and cold-brew systems – perfect for *food enthusiasts* avoiding retail markups. Commercial-grade ranges occasionally surface at 60% discounts, offering restaurant power for home kitchens.

RV owners and van-lifers drive demand for 12-volt ovens and countertop ice makers. These compact marvels pack full functionality into spaces where traditional models won't fit.

# Understanding Appliance Features and Technologies

Today's homes hum with intelligent systems that simplify daily routines. While older models focused solely on basic functions, modern units blend smart operation with energy conservation – even in pre-owned options.



# Click here for details : [https://go.sytixo.com/1ydINi](https://go.sytixo.com/1ydINi)



# Smart Features and Energy Efficiency

**Wi-Fi connectivity transforms how households manage chores**. Imagine starting your oven's preheat cycle during your commute or receiving alerts when laundry finishes. Voice commands through Alexa or Google Home eliminate button-pushing – perfect when your hands are covered in cooking oil.

Energy-saving innovations go beyond basic settings. Advanced sensors adjust water temperatures in dishwashers based on soil levels. Refrigerators with triple-layer insulation maintain cold air better than models from 2010. These features slash utility bills by 18-23% annually.

# Innovative Technologies in Modern Appliances

Commercial-grade innovations now appear in residential equipment. Air Fry ovens circulate hot air for crispy fries without oil baths. LG's FreshFlow™ systems prevent freezer burn for up to 14 days. Some ranges even bake frozen pizzas perfectly through specialized heating chambers.

Laundry units showcase smart water management. Samsung's AI-powered washers calculate detergent amounts automatically. Dryers with moisture sensors stop cycles precisely when clothes reach ideal dryness. These breakthroughs deliver restaurant-quality results while conserving resources.

# Tips for Buying Pre-Owned Appliances

Smart purchasing strategies turn secondhand finds into long-term investments. Always verify functionality through hands-on testing before committing – this separates hidden gems from money pits.

# Inspection Essentials

For **washing machines**, run empty cycles to check spin speeds and listen for unusual noises. Top load models need agitator inspections, while front-load units require door seal checks. Test electric dryers by heating empty drums for 10 minutes – cold air signals faulty coils.

||
||
|Appliance|Key Checks|Red Flags|
|Refrigerator|Door seals, compressor hum|Warm spots in fridge|
|Range/Oven|Burner ignition, temp accuracy|Uneven cooking|
|Dishwasher|Spray arm rotation|Pooling water|

# Warranty & Retailer Perks

Major retailers like Lowe’s offer *90-day warranties* on certified models. Their price matching covers identical new units – useful when negotiating with private sellers. Always ask about:

* Installation services ($79-$150 average)
* Extended protection plans (3-5 years)
* Documentation transfers

Seasonal sales from March-May and September-November yield the best deals. Bring original manuals when comparing prices – missing paperwork justifies lower offers. Remember: stainless steel surfaces cost $200+ to refinish, so factor in cosmetic flaws.

# Conclusion

Smart shopping for pre-owned home equipment unlocks premium functionality without draining your wallet. By focusing on **budget-friendly solutions**, households gain access to reliable performance from trusted brands. This approach lets you allocate savings to other priorities while building a fully equipped home.

Whether upgrading your kitchen with a gently used refrigerator or finding laundry essentials, the secondary market offers diverse options. Our guide’s inspection strategies and tech insights help you avoid pitfalls. Remember – scratches don’t affect how well appliances chill food or clean dishes.

First-time homeowners and seasoned bargain hunters alike benefit from this growing trend. Retailers now provide certified models with warranties, while private sellers offer unbeatable prices. With proper research, you’ll discover products that deliver years of service at 40-60% below retail.

The path to a functional home doesn’t require maxing out credit cards. Armed with negotiation tactics and quality benchmarks, you can shop confidently. Let value and longevity guide your decisions – your future self will thank you for choosing wisely.

The floral rug and those soft lavender curtains tie it all together, like a hug from the room itself.

This space isn’t just furniture, it’s where I’ve laughed with friends, cried over tough days, and built a million little memories.

1mdhzhu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novelnews/comments/1mdhzhu/on_the_night_of_our_fifteenth_wedding_anniversary/,"On the night of our fifteenth wedding anniversary, I heard my husband, Dan, whispering into the phone, “I love you, too, Maddie. Story link available—comment and get it within minutes.","Then a mysterious credit card bill texted to my phone, from a boutique I’d never heard of, “Jolie’s”…

My stomach went cold. My husband was cheating.

I started searching for the store on Instagram, and then I saw the woman.

Maddie Bell, young, blonde, and an influencer--showing off my husband online.

In one photo, she was wearing a delicate gold necklace. A small, interlocking heart-shaped pendant.

My stomach churned. It was the same as the one on Jolie’s credit card bill.

The one Dan bought for “an employee’s baby.”

And from their comments, I learned that they already had a child!

The liar!

The anger became physical and settled in my stomach.

I tried to restrain myself. Now was not the time to fight back. I could let her think she had won first.

————————

Today was supposed to be the happiest day of my life, the tenth anniversary of Ellie's Sweet Sensations, my beloved bakery.

But amidst the flash of cameras and Dan's charming politician's smile, a cold knot tightened in my stomach. Late-night texts, a mysterious credit card charge from a boutique I'd never heard of, ""Jolie's""... then I heard it, Dan cooing ""Love you too, Maddie"" into the phone. The perfect facade cracked; my husband was having an affair.

The betrayal was bad enough, but then she popped up – Maddie Bell, young, blonde, influencer – flaunting my husband online. Vacation photos, the same necklace from Jolie's, and always always right next to my husband. Then I caught wind of THEIR baby. My carefully constructed world started crumbling as I came to terms with the stark reality: He wasn't just cheating; he was building a whole new life with her.

I baked him that cake for our anniversary, knowing I'd soon be but a memory. Then, the ultimate slap – he was going to take Maddie home to meet his parents. The next day, she was at my doorstep feigning sympathy while my world burned. I couldn't stay with all of this on my plate. Not even for Liam.

So I plotted my escape, a theatrical end: a staged car accident with me declared the victim. What kind? The one he causes. Was this revenge or survival? I thought it was both. But what would my story have in store? I started by documenting the full account of his disgusting deed in a diary I knew he would stumble on post-""mortem.""

1

The scent of vanilla and toasted sugar hung thick in the air, a familiar hug.

""Ellie's Sweet Sensations"" was ten years old today.

My bakery. My dream.

The local paper's photographer snapped another picture. Flash.

Dan, my husband, had his arm around my waist, beaming.

""She's a genius, isn't she?"" he said to Maria, the reporter from the New England Chronicle.

Maria scribbled in her notepad. ""Indeed, Mr. Hayes. A town treasure.""

I managed a smile. ""It's a team effort.""

Liam, our son, sixteen now and all angles and artistic brooding, stood a little awkwardly by the tiered cake display, looking proud in his own quiet way.

Publicly, we were the Hayes family. Perfect.

Privately, a small, cold knot had been tightening in my stomach for weeks.

It started with a late-night text on Dan's phone. A heart emoji. I'd told myself it was a constituent. Dan was a politician, after all. Charisma was his currency.

Then, the credit card bill. A charge from ""Jolie's,"" a boutique I'd never heard of, for an amount that made my breath catch. A gift, he'd said, for a staffer's new baby.

It felt...off.

The party buzzed around me. Friends, loyal customers, Bren – my rock, my business partner, her eyes sharp and knowing as she watched me.

Later that evening, after the last guest had left and the bakery was quiet, I found the final clue.

Dan was on the phone in his study, his voice low, intimate.

""...of course, baby. He's my priority, but... you know how it is.""

A pause. Then a soft chuckle.

""Love you too, Maddie.""

Maddie. Not a staffer. Not a constituent.

The floor felt like it had dropped away. The sweet scent of the bakery suddenly turned cloying, suffocating.

The perfect facade had cracked, and the truth was a raw, gaping wound.

The decision settled in my heart like a stone.

I couldn't stay. I wouldn't.

But just leaving wasn't enough. He needed to feel a fraction of what I felt.

The next morning, I sat across from Bren at a small table in the back of the empty bakery, the scent of yesterday's celebration now a mockery.

""He's having an affair, Bren.""

Her face, usually so quick with a joke, hardened. ""That prick.""

""He has another family. Or at least, another woman he tells 'I love you' to.""

I laid out my plan, my voice flat, devoid of the storm raging inside me.

""I'm going to disappear. Stage my death.""

Bren's coffee cup clattered against the saucer. ""Ellie, are you insane?""

""Maybe,"" I admitted. ""But I can't just walk away. He has to pay. He has to live with it.""

I told her about ""New Life Solutions,"" an agency I'd found in the deepest corners of the internet. They specialized in fresh starts. Untraceable.

""I have money, Bren. Enough. My grandmother's inheritance. I want it to be convincing. An accident.""

Bren stared at me, her expression shifting from shock to a dawning, horrified understanding.

""What kind of accident, Ellie?""

""The kind he causes,"" I said, the words tasting like ash. ""I want a mannequin, lifelike, in a car. I want him to hit it. I want him to think he killed me.""

Bren just looked at me, speechless for once.

My resolve was steel. This wasn't just escape. This was revenge.

Flashes of him, of us.

Ten years ago, our own wedding. A small, intimate affair in a Berkshires inn.

I'd baked our cake, a three-tiered lemon raspberry masterpiece. Dan had watched me, his eyes full of an adoration that I'd believed was as real as the sugar flowers I'd crafted.

His hand on my back as we danced.

The way he used to look at me across a crowded room, a secret smile just for me.

Liam's birth. Dan, holding our tiny son, tears in his eyes, whispering, ""My family. My perfect family.""

Had it all been a lie? Every touch, every shared laugh, every whispered promise?

The memories, once sources of warmth, now burned.

They were fuel for the cold fire of my plan. The contrast between that imagined past and the raw present was a constant ache.

He had built his political career on the image of a devoted family man.

I would tear it down, brick by loving, fabricated brick.

A notification pinged on my phone. Instagram.

A suggested post.

Maddie Bell.

Young. Blonde. Perfect teeth, a dazzling smile.

Her feed was a curated collection of beach vacations, trendy restaurants, and selfies that screamed ""look at me.""

She was a social media influencer. Of course.

In one photo, she wore a delicate gold necklace. A small, interlocking heart pendant.

My stomach lurched. It was identical to the one on the Jolie's credit card statement.

The one Dan had bought for ""a staffer's baby.""

The rage was a physical thing, coiling in my gut.

She was everything I wasn't anymore. Young, carefree, unburdened by years of shared history and unspoken disappointments.

And she had my husband.

She was the ""baby"" he was talking to on the phone.

The crisis wasn't just a feeling anymore; it was a face, a name, a constant, taunting presence in my digital world.

Our fifteenth wedding anniversary approached.

A cruel joke.

I found myself going through the motions, a ghost in my own life.

I booked a table at ""The Gilded Spoon,"" the fanciest restaurant in town, the one we'd gone to for our first anniversary.

I bought a new dress, a deep sapphire silk that Bren said made my eyes look electric.

I even baked a small cake – his favorite, dark chocolate with a salted caramel buttercream. Not for the bakery, just for us. A pathetic offering to a dead marriage.

The evening arrived. I dressed with care, a strange detachment settling over me.

Liam was at a friend's house.

The table was set. Candles flickered. The small cake sat under a glass dome.

Seven o'clock. Our reservation time.

Seven-thirty.

Eight.

My phone finally buzzed. A text from Dan.

""So sorry, El. Got held up. Campaign crisis. Raincheck?""

\----------

No call. No elaborate excuse. Just a casual dismissal.

I stared at the flickering candles, the uneaten cake.

The disappointment was a familiar ache, but this time it was sharper, edged with a bitter knowledge.

He wasn't at a campaign meeting.

He was with her. Maddie.

The silence in the house was immense, broken only by the ticking of the grandfather clock in the hall, each tick a nail in the coffin of our marriage.

The next morning, I started to pack.

Not clothes. Not essentials.

Memories.

Liam's first pair of shoes, bronzed and heavy.

The goofy stuffed giraffe Dan won for me at a county fair, its fur worn thin from years of Liam dragging it around.

My grandmother's locket, the one she gave me on my wedding day.

Photographs. So many photographs. Us smiling. Always smiling.

I packed them into sturdy cardboard boxes.

Each item was a stab of pain, a reminder of what I was losing, what had been stolen.

But with each box sealed, a sense of grim satisfaction grew.

This wasn't just an act of clearing out; it was an act of severance.

I addressed the largest box to ""Maddie Bell,"" her address easily found online.

Inside, nestled amongst Liam's childhood treasures, I placed a simple, unsigned card: ""Heirlooms for the new family.""

Let her see what she was helping to destroy. Let her understand the depth of the life she was invading.

My resolve hardened. There was no turning back. I was erasing myself from their narrative, one packed memory at a time.

I was taping up the last box when I heard the front door open.

""Mom? We're home!"" Liam's voice, still boyish despite his height.

Followed by Dan's deeper, more practiced tones. ""Ellie? You here, honey?""

My heart hammered. They weren't supposed to be back for hours.

I quickly pushed the boxes into the back of the hall closet, my hands trembling slightly.

Dan appeared in the doorway of the living room, where I was standing amidst a feigned attempt at tidying.

He was smiling, that charming politician's smile that could win over any crowd.

""Hey. Sorry about last night. Things got crazy.""

Liam came up behind him, looking tired but happy. ""The concert was awesome, Mom. You should've come.""

""Dan took me and Maddie,"" Liam said, oblivious. ""She knows the band.""

The name, ""Maddie,"" hung in the air between us, casual, innocent from Liam's lips.

To me, it was a detonation.

Dan's smile didn't waver, but a flicker of something – annoyance? – crossed his eyes.

""Maddie Bell. She's a... a friend. Helping with youth outreach for the campaign.""

A lie. So smooth. So practiced.

My plan, which had felt so clear, so righteous, suddenly felt precarious. They were here. In my space. Breathing my air.

I needed them gone.

I pasted on a smile. ""Sounds like fun. I was just... decluttering.""

Dan stepped further into the room, his eyes scanning, perhaps noticing the faint scent of cardboard.

He held out a small, gift-wrapped box.

""A\_little something for our anniversary. Since I messed up dinner.""

His voice was all contrition, oozing sincerity.

I took the box. It felt light, insignificant.

Inside, a silver bracelet. Delicate. Pretty.

And utterly meaningless.

It felt like a prop, another piece of the facade he so carefully maintained.

""It's beautiful, Dan. Thank you."" My voice sounded hollow even to my own ears.

He leaned in to peck me. I turned my head slightly, so his lips brushed my cheek. His scent, once a comfort, now repelled me.

He pulled back, a slight frown creasing his brow. ""Everything okay, El?""

""Just tired,"" I said. ""Long day.""

The lie came easily. I was learning from the master.

Liam, bless his innocent heart, piped up, ""Maddie said she's a huge fan of your cakes, Mom. She wants to come by the bakery sometime.""

My eyes met Dan's over Liam's head. His expression was suddenly tight.

The cold knot in my stomach turned to ice.

He was bringing her into my world, into my son's life, without a shred of shame.

The bracelet felt heavy on my wrist, a shackle.

I wanted to scream. I wanted to throw the gift in his face.

Instead, I smiled again, a rictus of forced pleasantry. ""That's... nice.""

The final, definitive blow didn't come from Dan. It came from Liam.

Later that evening, as I was helping him with a history assignment, he was scrolling through photos on his phone from the concert.

""Look, Mom, this is Maddie.""

He turned the screen towards me.

There she was. Maddie Bell. Arm in arm with Dan. Both of them laughing, heads thrown back, looking entirely too comfortable, too intimate.

Dan's hand was on her waist, a casual possessiveness that made my blood run cold.

It wasn't a ""networking event."" It wasn't ""youth outreach.""

It was a date. My husband, on a date with his mistress, with our son as an unwitting chaperone.

""She's really cool, Mom,"" Liam continued, oblivious to the way the world had just tilted on its axis for me. ""She said you and Dad are like, total couple goals.""

Couple goals. The irony was a bitter pill.

Any lingering doubt, any tiny, desperate hope that I had misunderstood, that it was all some horrible mistake, evaporated.

Shattered.

The pain was so intense, it was almost a relief. There was no more ambiguity, no more hoping. Just the stark, ugly truth.

My carefully constructed composure crumbled, just for a second, before I pulled it back together.

""She sounds... friendly,"" I managed, my voice a strained whisper.

The next day, a new follow request on my bakery's Instagram page.

Maddie\_Bell.

Then a DM.

A picture. Her, wearing the interlocking heart necklace. The caption: ""Feeling loved.""

Followed by a message: ""Ellie! Liam told me so much about your amazing bakery. I'm your husband's... colleague. Dan talks about you all the time. He says you're an incredible woman. Would love to connect! Maybe grab coffee? ""

The audacity. The sheer, unadulterated gall.

She wasn't just having an affair with my husband. She was actively taunting me.

The smiling emoji felt like a punch to the gut.

This wasn't an accidental slip. This was a power play.

She wanted me to know. She wanted me to see her, to acknowledge her presence in his life, in our life.

My fingers hovered over the block button.

No. Not yet.

Let her think she was winning.",1,1753908336.0,Novelnews,1,0.66,False
1mdhy3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1mdhy3a/how_to_deal_with_assault/,How to deal with assault,"Recently discovered this subreddit after dealing with some complicated instances of sexual assault. Sorry if it’s too much to read…

I’m 27 F, but was a ‘virgin’ up until this last January. I was a late bloomer regarding sex as I was kinda waiting for the right person. Two years ago I fell in love with someone super nice, and I got to explore a bit of sexual stuff with him. He was my first sexual experience and he was perfect regarding intimacy. We broke it off before we ever got to having sex, but he was the most respectful person I have ever been with and I felt super safe and cared for with him.

Then a year ago I reconnect with a male friend, and we start hanging out which we never really used to be, but it was fun. Nothing had ever happened between us before, but we had flirted maybe 3-4 years ago. When we reconnected I was still hung up on this previous guy I was in love with. My male friend comes over to eat food and watch a movie. After we finished our food, he kind of forcibly made me cuddle him. Which was so shocking to me. I was barely touching him, and he was touching all over me. I asked him what he was doing and that nothing would happen that night or ever. He shrugged me off and asked if I actually believed that he came only to watch movies. Which I totally believed until he did that. He then touched my breasts through my shirt and I was trying to shove his hands away and said no. We then kissed, and he carried me to the bedroom, and he tore my t-shirt off of me. I was in shock about everything happening I didn’t know how to stop him. But eventually I stop, and tell him I think it’s a bad idea and that I was a virgin. He didn’t really believe me in the beginning, but eventually did and he backed off. We went back to watch the movie and everything was just a bit weird. The movie ended and I felt so weird but didn’t want him to just leave because I felt vulnerable. We agreed to just lay on my bed, not under the covers, and just talk. I barely touch my bed before he is all over me again. Kissing, touching me and everything. He then takes his pants off and I force myself to please him for a bit before he lays on top off me, rips my shirt off, and also rips my bra down to expose my breasts. He is grinding into me with nothing on his bottom parts (I was still wearing sweatpants). He then holds me down with a bit of force, grinds into me, and asks me questions about what sexual act I had ever done. He was aggressive. I answer no to everything, and he then stops and tells me “You haven’t ever done/tried anything” making me feel pathetic and childish. He puts his pants on, stays for 10 minutes and then leaves to meet his friends. I was in so much shock I couldn’t believe what had just happened. I was shaking really bad. I walked over to my friends place, and starting crying. We talked and I had to take 3 showers to feel clean enough since his smell was all over me and my clothes. I was proper depressed for a week, and then supressed everything that happened. 

This winter I started going on dates. I had “sex” for the first time with someone who I didn’t know and who didn’t really give a shit about me. It was horrible, and he had no idea I was virgin. But it kinda failed. It was the second date and we never spoke again (mutual). 

After that I started dating this guy, who was kind of really eager only at the end of the date. The whole first date was at his place, so we ended up kind of having sex then. We dated for 2 months, so I didn’t feel too bad about sleeping with him so soon. He was really selfish regarding sex, and the second time we met and fooled around he slapped me across the face. I didn’t know how to feel, and I was a bit shocked. I didn’t say he couldn’t do again, so it became a thing. He would slap me every time we were intimate. Multiple times. Never asked me if I liked it. But I really didn’t know if I did. It was so shocking to me every time. We stopped seeing each other in april.

Then I went on a date with another guy a couple weeks ago. I thought we were going to get coffee, but he bought us wine instead. He ordered two bottles of wine and a drink each. He got me super drunk. Not black out, but really fucking drunk. He was not even slighty as drunk as me. He also said, he was only a little bit tipsy, but I was way drunker than him. He was also 200 cm tall, big and broad. I’m only 163 cm and not very big. We had fun at the restaurant and then he asked to go back to mine. I told him no, and even in my very drunk state I said that I was not gonna sleep with him. He agreed and said we will definitely not be having sex. We went back to his because I wanted to sober up before heading to home. I was too drunk, and I didn’t want him to come to my place. We got to his and I had told him we shouldn’t have sex about 10 times now. We end up having sex… I was really drunk through most of it. But at one point, he very LIGHTLY chokes, which I didn’t say he couldn’t do. But then later, he chokes me really hard with one hand. Completely cuts all air off. He choked me really hard for a long time, and I had to hit on his arm to get him to release me. I looked at him and told him he could’ve killed me. He just laughed it off. I was too drunk to actually stand on any business. So later when I’m going down on him, he collects my hair in his hand tightly, puts both of his legs on either side of my face, pushed my head down on him while pressing my head between his legs. Making me uncontrollably choke on him. He keeps pressing my head down and smashing my head between his two big thighs. I smack him on his stomach and he releases me. I knew it didn’t feel right, but I was really drunk to react. I just knew it didn’t make me feel good. I think I just told him he was crazy, which he just laughed off. 

It has taken me a while to come to terms with the fact that some of these instances are actually sexual assault. I didn’t consent to getting slapped, I didn’t want to be intimate with my male friend, and I definitely didn’t want to be choked to near death. 

My therapist is on summer break, so I feel like I’m kinda spiralling in these thoughts and experiences. Maybe some people have had similar experiences? I also know a lot of people have experienced a lot worse, but I’m not sure how to deal with this. ❤️",2,1753908247.0,sexualassault,1,1.0,False

With every meal, even with a light snack (sandwich, chocolate bar, apple, pear, coffee with sugar, etc.), the pancreas produces insulin.  
What is insulin?  
Insulin is a growth hormone. It:  
• absorbs sugar in the blood;  
• causes cells and muscles to grow;  
• participates in the formation of new muscle tissue;  
• prevents muscle atrophy.  
Some bodybuilders even take insulin or consume carbohydrates to increase its levels and increase muscle mass. It would seem that this is a very useful hormone. But why do people with hyperinsulinemia (excess insulin) often develop muscle atrophy?  
Contradictions of insulin  
Contradictions of insulin Insulin helps absorb potassium and magnesium.  
Fact: But people with hyperinsulinemia suffer from a deficiency of these minerals. The higher the insulin level, the lower the potassium and magnesium levels in the body.  
Insulin has a powerful anti-inflammatory effect.  
Fact: However, in type 2 diabetes, when there is a lot of insulin in the body, inflammation only intensifies.  
Insulin – an antioxidant.  
Fact: However, in type 2 diabetes, when there is a lot of insulin in the body, inflammation only intensifies.  
Insulin is an antioxidant  
But people with excess insulin experience oxidative damage and complications from diabetes.  
Insulin lowers uric acid levels.  
Fact: However, in hyperinsulinemia, uric acid levels are elevated.  
Insulin dilates blood vessels and lowers blood pressure.  
Fact: But with metabolic syndrome, a person has high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and prediabetes.  
Insulin reduces glucose production in the liver.  
Fact: However, people with prediabetes and diabetes often wake up with high blood sugar levels (the “morning dawn” phenomenon).  
  
What is really happening?  
1. How insulin works  
Beta cells in the pancreas produce insulin and release it into the blood in response to rising glucose levels.  
Insulin interacts with receptors that regulate its production.  
If there is too much insulin, the body blocks its binding to receptors. The body is smart and realizes that it does not need so much growth hormone, especially for people after adolescence, when the body has already grown.  
2. Why does insulin resistance develop?  
Frequent insulin releases due to large amounts of carbohydrates and sugar cause the body to defend itself. It blocks the receptors to prevent uncontrolled cell growth.  
  
The result is a situation where insulin produced by the pancreas enters the bloodstream, but its receptors do not accept it because the body has blocked their function. At the same time, the glucose that caused the release of insulin also remains in the blood. Insulin has not performed its function—it has not processed the sugar.  
• The receptors continue to request insulin because the blood sugar level is high.  
• The pancreas begins to produce even more insulin.  
• Insulin remains in the blood but does not work because the receptors are blocked.  
3. Consequences of insulin resistance  
• Tests show high insulin levels, but the body experiences a deficiency.  
• Prediabetes, diabetes, high blood pressure, and inflammation develop.  
• The more insulin there is, the worse the receptors work.  
• The more carbohydrates there are, the stronger the insulin resistance.  
4. How does insulin resistance manifest itself?  
• Feeling tired after eating.  
• Frequent nighttime trips to the bathroom.  
• Constant hunger and cravings for carbohydrates.  
• Metabolic syndrome (high cholesterol, blood pressure, sugar).  
These are the most well-known symptoms, but here is the complete list:  
• Feeling hungry;  
• Not feeling full after eating;  
• Sleepiness after lunch;  
• Strong craving for carbohydrates (bread, cookies, crackers);  
• Elevated insulin levels;  
• High blood glucose levels;  
• High blood pressure;  
• High cholesterol;  
• Fatty liver;  
• Belly fat;  
• Dark folds on the neck, under the arms, in the groin;  
• Papillomas;  
• Fatigue during training;  
• Inflammation and pain (bursitis, arthritis);  
• Sleep apnea;  
• Poor sleep;  
• Morning dawn phenomenon (elevated blood sugar without food);  
• Slow metabolism;  
• Loss of muscle mass;  
• Loss of collagen in the joints;  
• Dizziness;  
• Depression, irritability, anxiety;  
• Acne;  
• Low testosterone.  
Mistakes in treating type 2 diabetes  
The worst thing a type 2 diabetic can do is take insulin. It only worsens resistance and increases the risk of complications.  
According to medical professors:  
•    80% of people suffer from insulin resistance.  
• It increases the risk of cardiovascular disease by 540% (high cholesterol only by 30%).  
Now it becomes clear why the above facts seem contradictory. A person has a lot of insulin in their blood, but due to resistance, it is not enough to perform its functions. This leads to prediabetes, diabetes, hypertension, and inflammation.

Where I'll need some help is for tier names. As a reminder: I'm publishing the results as a tierlist. And for that (and given Reddit's limitations), I need to make sufficiently broad categories. For now, I have five in mind:

\- **Chill date:** a walk, a coffee, a movie at the cinema...

\- **Fancy date:** going to an amusement park, a casino, a bar or a nightclub...

\- **Expensive date:** an upscale restaurant or bar, going to the opera or the theater, going shopping...

\- **Outdoor date:** a trip to the beach, a hike in the mountains, going camping...

\- **Home date:** watching a movie on TV, cooking a romantic dinner, playing a game together...

However, for something that's uneasy to define, like a date, it's quite complicated. Plus, even though I think my English is decent, I still have some trouble with urban langage. So if you have any suggestions or criticisms, please share it in comments.

The views expressed here are my own and do not reflect the views of my employer. (<—- my coffee company’s social media policy lol )

Ok so i’ve been fuming about this for 3 hours and want to know if my anger is justified and if me being upset is normal. 

So I’m off the clock, just ringing up my free shift drink. The store’s calming down after a rush, and my coworkers all of whom are still working are trying to catch up. A lady comes in holding a barely sipped drink, like 3 inches gone. My shift supervisor says “hi i’ll be with you in one moment.” And she just start complaining about how she took two sips and her drink is almost empty. 

Why does she have so much more ice than her daughter’s drink even tho it’s the same drink? My coworkers are explaining what a dry iced Americano is while I simultaneously say that looks like a dry Americano. Did you order a dry Americano? My manager and supervisor start very bluntly explaining a dry Americano doesn’t have much liquid in it. It’s just espresso and powder. 

Again she keeps complaining about the level of ice and we’re trying to tell her that is what you fucking ordered. So I try to explain again, “Oh, dry Americanos don’t really have much liquid, just espresso and powder.” Like, trying to gently steer her away from a full-blown meltdown. I even joke, “I only get those if I wanna chug my coffee fast!” 

But I can see it in her eyes she wants a remake or a refund. She’s not gonna leave without one. But she got exactly what she ordered so why do we have to?? (company policy ughhh!) 

Very bluntly while continuing their work, both my Manager and shift supervisor try to explain that’s what she ordered and explain her daughter’s drink had more powder in it. 

I say we can give you a remake of the flavored americano so it’s not dry and there’s more liquid. My coworkers had already started on her remake FOR FREE!! She goes quiet for a bit. 

Then THEN she starts pointing and going, “Who’s her? is she your manager? she’s very rude?” at the group of my 3 coworkers behind hot bar. Obviously trying to ask for my mangers name and trying to call out our manager (again who is very blunt at speaking but an amazing barista and gm). 

 I’m say, “who? there’s like three girls here? who are you talking about?”

She says “the one with the hat😡”. FOUR of us are wearing hats dumbass!! Like obviously i know who she means but im not gonna snitch on my manager. Be specific or stop talking. You could feel that she wanted to start something. 

So I just stare at her like 😐, “Ma’am she’s (name of) our store manager.” 
The lady goes, “Yeah. I’m not mad at you, I’m mad at her. She was so rude at register.” Ma’am. WE WERE BUSY. We are not gonna hand you freebies wrapped in a little polite bow because you don’t understand what you ordered. 

My manager literally breaks her back keeping this store running. She comes in off the clock to pick up the slack and this woman has the audacity to call her rude. You can tell the body language of all us coworkers change. We all stiffen up and get visibly upset. The one thing that we unanimously agree on is screw whoever insults our manager because she is the hardest worker!! We will die for her. 😒

Some more back and forth ensues after she got her free drink she then runs to her car. This is her yelp review: 

“The customer service was was very poor. The manager at this location was Rude !!! & seem so unhappy, maybe was having a bad morning but then again her employees said that's just the way she is she means no harm. i personally think she could do alot better with a simple Hi and not look so annoyed by the service she's getting.”

So the guest came in for the first time and was pretty unhappy with the experience mainly because she felt one of the staff members was rude. And I get it first impressions matter. But sometimes what people interpret as ""rude"" is just someone being blunt, direct, and focused especially in a fast-paced environment. The truth is, some people (especially women in customer service) get labeled as “rude” just for being straightforward, especially when they don’t soften everything with a sweet voice and smile. If a man said the exact same words the exact same way, I doubt the reaction would’ve been the same. But when a woman is assertive and focused, it’s somehow “a bad attitude.”  In this instance the guest was also upset that we weren’t helping right away and making eye contact with her while talking but everyone was literally mid-task, heads down making drinks and trying to keep the orders moving. 

We did talk to her, and we did answer her questions. We just also had to keep working. That’s the reality in a busy café. We are not being dismissive, it’s about staying efficient. At the end of the day, her drink wasn’t wrong either. It just wasn’t what she wanted! she def should have gotten a latte cuz a dry Americano with flavor is supposed to be just espresso, powder, and ice. Her daughter’s looked like less ice because of how much powder was added and the shots are sometimes over pulled a bit more than they should be whooops. That’s it. No one was being passive-aggressive. Honestly!! 

About my manager that’s just the way she is. She’s genuinely really sweet and kind versus me I can be sweet and nice and polite and call you a dumb bitch to your face and you wouldn’t even understand that’s what u said cuz it’s wrapped in sugar. We were just trying to explain that that’s the drink that she got like it’s literally no liquid, no one was trying to ignore her until she started being dismissive and rude back. My coworkers were just working. I think this whole situation was an example of how customer service expectations can be ridiculous! Especially when someone expects over-the-top warmth and friendliness as a default. Not everyone is bubbly. But that doesn’t mean they’re disrespectful. And me helping her while I’m off the clock is a prime example of good customer service cuz i didn’t have to!!!  ",1,1753907719.0,AmIOverreacting,3,0.67,False

## Key Features Analysis

The best fraser fir candles are distinguished by several key features that contribute to their overall quality and performance. These include fragrance authenticity, burn time, wax composition, scent throw, and container design. A superior candle should accurately replicate the scent of a Fraser fir, burn cleanly and evenly, fill a room with its fragrance without being overpowering, and be housed in a visually appealing and functional container.

**Fragrance Authenticity:**

The most crucial aspect of a Fraser fir candle is its ability to accurately capture the authentic scent of a Fraser fir tree.This involves using high-quality fragrance oils that mimic the complex blend of notes found in the natural aroma. These notes include the crisp, green scent of the needles, the subtle earthiness of the bark, and the slight hint of citrus that some Fraser fir trees possess. Candles with synthetic or generic ""pine"" scents frequently enough fall short of delivering the desired experience.

**Burn Time:**

Burn time is a important factor in determining the overall value of a candle. A longer burn time allows for extended enjoyment of the fragrance and reduces the frequency of replacements. The ideal burn time for a Fraser fir candle depends on its size and wax composition, but generally, candles should offer at least 40 hours of burn time for a standard-sized jar candle and up to 80 hours or more for larger options. Factors that influence burn time include the type of wax used, the size of the wick, and proper burning practices.

**Wax Composition:**

the type of wax used in a Fraser fir candle plays a vital role in its performance and environmental impact. Soy wax, beeswax, and coconut wax are popular choices due to their clean burning properties and renewable sourcing. Soy wax is known for its excellent scent throw and affordability, while beeswax offers a natural aroma and long burn time. Coconut wax is a relatively new option that boasts superior scent throw and a clean,even burn. Paraffin wax,a petroleum-based product,is less desirable due to its potential for releasing harmful chemicals when burned.

**Scent throw:**

Scent throw refers to the ability of a candle to fill a room with its fragrance. A strong scent throw is essential for creating a noticeable and immersive aromatic experience. Though,it is indeed significant that the scent throw is not overpowering or artificial. The best Fraser fir candles achieve a balance, providing a pleasant and noticeable fragrance that enhances the ambiance of the room without causing headaches or irritation. Scent throw is influenced by the type of wax, the concentration of fragrance oil, and the size and design of the candle container.**Container Design:**

While the fragrance is paramount, the container design also contributes to the overall appeal of a Fraser fir candle. A well-designed container should be both aesthetically pleasing and functional. It should complement the style of the candle, enhance its visual appeal, and be durable enough to withstand the heat of the burning candle. Common container materials include glass, metal, and ceramic, with glass jars being the most popular choice due to their ability to showcase the candle's wax and flame.

## Core Benefits

Fraser fir candles offer several compelling benefits, making them a popular choice for home fragrance enthusiasts and those seeking to create a cozy and festive atmosphere. These benefits include creating a festive ambiance, providing a relaxing and comforting aroma, masking unwanted odors, and serving as a stylish decorative accent.

**Creating a Festive Ambiance:** The primary benefit of a Fraser fir candle is its ability to create a festive and inviting atmosphere, notably during the holiday season. The authentic scent of a Fraser fir promptly evokes memories of christmas trees, family gatherings, and cozy winter evenings. This can definitely help to enhance the holiday spirit and make any home feel more welcoming and cheerful.

**Providing a Relaxing and Comforting Aroma:** Beyond its festive associations, the scent of a Fraser fir is also inherently relaxing and comforting. The woodsy and slightly sweet aroma can definitely help to reduce stress, promote relaxation, and create a sense of calm and well-being. This makes Fraser fir candles an excellent choice for creating a tranquil habitat in bedrooms, living rooms, or home offices.

**Masking Unwanted Odors:** Fraser fir candles can be effective in masking unwanted odors,such as pet smells,cooking odors,or stale air. The strong and pleasant aroma of the Fraser fir can effectively neutralize these odors, leaving the room smelling fresh and clean. This makes them a valuable addition to any home, particularly in areas prone to unpleasant smells.

**Serving as a Stylish Decorative Accent:** In addition to their aromatic benefits, Fraser fir candles can also serve as stylish decorative accents. Many candles are housed in attractive containers that complement a variety of décor styles, adding a touch of elegance and sophistication to any room. They can be placed on shelves, mantels, coffee tables, or windowsills to enhance the visual appeal of the space.

## FAQs Section

Many consumers have common questions about Fraser fir candles, including their scent profile, safety precautions, burn time expectations, and potential allergic reactions. Addressing these concerns helps consumers make informed purchasing decisions and enjoy their candles safely and effectively.

**what does a fraser fir candle smell like?**

A Fraser fir candle should accurately mimic the scent of a fresh Fraser fir tree. This typically includes crisp, green notes of pine needles, subtle earthiness and woody undertones, and sometimes a hint of citrus or spice. High-quality Fraser fir candles use fragrance oils that capture the complexity of this natural aroma, avoiding artificial or overpowering scents.

**Are Fraser fir candles safe to burn around pets and children?**

While Fraser fir candles are generally considered safe, it's crucial to take precautions when burning them around pets and children. Never leave a burning candle unattended, and keep them out of reach to prevent accidents. Ensure the room is well-ventilated to avoid irritation from the fragrance and smoke. If you have pets or children with respiratory sensitivities, opt for candles made with natural waxes and fragrance oils.

**How long should a Fraser fir candle burn?**

The burn time of a fraser fir candle depends on its size, wax type, and wick size. Smaller candles may burn for 20-30 hours, while larger ones can last up to 80 hours or more. It's best to burn the candle for a few hours at a time to allow the wax to melt evenly across the surface, preventing tunneling. Always trim the wick to ¼ inch before each use to ensure a clean and even burn.

**Can Fraser fir candles cause allergic reactions?**

While rare, fraser fir candles can possibly cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. This is usually due to the fragrance oils used in the candle. If you experience symptoms like sneezing, coughing, skin irritation, or headaches after burning a Fraser fir candle, discontinue use and consult with a doctor. Opting for candles made with natural fragrance oils and waxes can help minimize the risk of allergic reactions.

1mdhknp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mdhknp/game_night_fun/,Game Night Fun,"Every Saturday night, it’s the same: snacks on the coffee table, soda cans cracking open, the laughter of close friends echoing in my living room as we set up for game night.

There’s me, Jenna, Mike, Claire, and Jordan. We’ve been doing this for over a year now, rotating between Catan, Betrayal at House on the Hill, and sometimes the chaotic energy of Uno. It’s predictable, cozy, fun—until the night Jordan brings something… different.

A Ouija board.

At first, I think he’s joking. The cheap cardboard thing looks like something from a Halloween clearance bin. But he’s got this weird, excited grin and insists we give it a shot.

“Just for fun,” he says.

Mike shrugs. “Whatever. Beats losing to Jenna at Catan again.”

So we clear the table, light a couple candles for “vibes,” and sit in a circle. The lights are dimmed. The air feels oddly heavy, like the room is holding its breath.

We place our fingers on the planchette.

Jordan asks the first question.

“Is anyone there?”

Nothing happens. I want to laugh. I expect someone to push it as a joke.

Then, it moves.

At first I think it's Claire. But the way her eyes widen, it doesn't look like she’s faking it. The planchette slowly glides to “YES.”

Mike snorts. “Who’s doing that?”

No one answers.

The air grows colder.

We ask another question.

“What’s your name?”

The planchette spells: I - S - S - A.

None of us speak.

Then it starts moving faster:
D - O - N - T - S - T - A - Y

Claire jerks her hand away. “Nope. I’m done.”

Jordan laughs nervously. “It’s just a game.”

But something in the room has shifted. The warmth of our usual nights is gone. It feels wrong. Off.

We pack up the board, but the unease doesn’t leave.

That’s when things start getting weird.

The next week, Claire is… different. She shows up late, quiet. Her smile doesn’t quite reach her eyes. And when she laughs, it’s too loud. Forced.

The week after, Mike changes. He doesn’t argue over rules anymore. He just stares at people too long, too intensely, like he’s waiting for something. His eyes look darker, somehow.

Then Jenna. She always brought snacks—chips, candy, cookies—but now she brings nothing. Just sits, watching. Like she’s studying us.

I try to ignore it, chalk it up to a bad mood, stress, whatever.

But tonight, it’s just me and Jordan left.

He looks at me across the table, that same grin he had when he brought the board. But now it feels… wrong. Crooked.

“We should play again,” he says.

My heart is racing. I don’t want to. Everything inside me is screaming not to.

“I think I’m good,” I say.

He stands up slowly. The others, sitting around the room, turn their heads toward me—almost in sync.

“You’re the last one,” Jordan says, voice low.

My breath catches.

“What?”

They all stand.

Claire’s eyes are completely black now. No whites, no pupils.

Mike tilts his head, the bones in his neck crackling unnaturally.

Jenna’s mouth stretches too wide, splitting at the corners like her skin is paper.

I back away until I hit the wall.

They take a step forward, all at once.

“I don’t want this,” I whisper.

But the air is heavy again. I can’t move.

The candles flicker and die out.

Darkness swallows the room.

Their voices echo in unison, not theirs anymore:

“Now it’s your turn.”

I  don’t think.

I just run.

My legs move on instinct, away from their hollow voices, their too-silent steps. I sprint down the hallway, heart hammering in my chest, and slam the bathroom door shut behind me.

Click the lock.

Back away.

I press myself into the corner between the sink and the tub, barely able to breathe. I can hear them outside—bare feet on tile, slow and deliberate.

Jenna’s voice, right outside the door. Sweet and syrupy.

“Come on. It’s still game night.”

The doorknob rattles. Softly at first. Then harder.

Then they start knocking. Slow. Rhythmic. Like a chant.

Knock.
Knock.
Knock.

My phone’s still in my pocket. Thank God.

I pull it out with shaking hands, fingers trembling as I open Reddit—r/paranormal, the only place I can think to go.

I start typing:

[URGENT] Please help me. My friends are being replaced.

I know how this sounds. I don’t even believe in this kind of stuff. But something is happening and I’m scared.
Every Saturday, me and my friends have board game night. Last week, one of them brought a Ouija board. I didn’t want to play, but we all did anyway. Something answered us.

It told us to leave.
We didn’t listen.

Now… they’re not the same. One by one, they changed. At first it was subtle. Then it wasn’t. Their eyes. Their voices. The way they move like they’re puppets on invisible strings.

Now they’re all outside the bathroom door.

They’re trying to get in.

I’m the last one left. I don’t know what they want but I don’t think I’ll be me if they get in. I can’t call 911. My phone won’t dial out. The signal’s just gone. Like it never existed.

Please.
Someone.
If you know anything—how to reverse this, how to stop it—anything. I don’t want to end like them. I don’t want to disappear inside whatever they’ve become.

I hear them whispering now. My name, over and over, like a prayer.

They know I’m typing.

They’re laughing.

I don’t know how long this door will hold.

Please help me.

I am now posting this here on r/nosleep as well, because I am terrified. ""Please someone help me before it's too...

1mdhjhr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mdhjhr,Who I think should play DCU's Batman,"At the end of the day, fancasts are subjective, mixed in with some objectively good logical points mixed in between. Regarding my fancasts, I personally look at acting skills first and foremost, followed by the availability of the actor, the chemistry, budget, and finally, looks. Which is what landed me on a DCU Batman fancast: Ethan Peck.  


1. **Acting chops:**  
Ethan Peck is an amazing actor with hella range. He's been nominated for 7 awards and won 2 of them. He's also currently playing Spock, who's similar to Batman regarding them both being cold, calculated strategists with an often dry sense of humor. What sold me on him as Batman was his ""I do not drink coffee. I only drink tea"" scene, plus the chess scene. Plus, Ethan has a deep authoritative voice as Spock, which is close enough to challenge Kevin Conroy's voice (And I don't say this lightly).

2. **Availability:**  
Sure the Star Trek series is still going on, but Ethan isn't at that level of fame that he can be booked for multiple projects at once. Look at Karl Urban for example. He's part of the Mortal Kombat cinematic universe as Johnny Cage, while already playing Billy Butcher, or Jack Quaid, who's Superman in MAWS, and Hughie in The Boys. So Ethan being part of two universes shouldn't be an issue. Plus, he wants to do the role as well.

3. **Chemistry and Budget:**  
Ethan isn't really well-known in the acting community, but he's friends with David Corenswet, so if he's cast, the ""Batman-Superman chemistry"" in the comics will be easier to execute. Plus, he's not exactly a big name, so he'd be pretty easier and economically healthier to cast.

4. **Looks:**  
Ethan is the grandson of Gregory Peck, on whom Bruce Wayne's appearance was based off of for Year One and Kingdom Come, and he resembles him. He's 6'1"", which is only slightly shorter than Batman's comic height of 6'2"", which can be solved by slightly taller boots, and he won't get dunked on by David Corenswet (who's 6'6"" according to his trainer). Speaking of, Ethan can get bulked up as well to match or be close to David Corenswet's physique. He's also slightly older than David by 7-8 years as of right now, so add in filming time and time of movie release, and Ethan will be 42-43 years old, which is Batman's age when the Grant Morrison comic run happened in-universe. Plus, he's a black belt in karate.

In hindsight, I fully trust Gunn's casting choice when the project comes about, but what do you people think?

There, having intercourse on the white sheets, were Carl and Dr. Eddi.

My closest friends sat on my husband and moved quickly up and down.

""Give it to me! Oh...Yes.""

The gift bag slipped from my fingers, falling to the floor with a soft thud.

Tears welled up in my eyes before spilling over, hot and fast, as I turned and bolted.

My legs carrying me away from that room, away from the betrayal, away from the life I thought I had a new beginnings.

I had no idea where I was going.

I wiped away my tears and looked at the bar further down the street.

That's where I needed, to get drunk, to forget everything.

————————

It was our wedding anniversary day, and I was buzzing with excitement, I had told my Boss, Erin, that I’d be closing on time to see my husband at Saint Paul's, where he works, I quickly wrapped my work up, I was eager, desperate and even to surprise Carl,

Yesterday, our entanglement had been unforgettable, we had promised each other to sort things out, to open up, and to rebuild our trust. That conversation has lifted a weight off my shoulders.

I had picked out a small gift, nothing extravagant but something thoughtful, and a smile I couldn't wipe off my face. I couldn't wait to see him, to spend some quiet time together from work and from the world.

Immediately, I got out from my long drive. I held my little gift bag closely as I made my way to Carl's office, my heels clicking rhythmically on the cold, sterile floor; as I turned the corner, I saw one of the nurses, Nurse Leila, a friendly face which I recognized.

""Is Carl around?"", I asked, trying to keep my voice casual, but I couldn't hide the excitement.

"" He is probably in the call room,"" she replied with a smile.

I knew exactly where that was; I had been to that room more times than I could count, when we were newlyweds, to bring him a coffee or just to say hello. It was the place where I knew I could always find him anytime he was not in his office, and I was ready to share this moment with him.

Still smiling, I headed down the familiar hallway, my steps quickening with anticipation, The call room door was slightly ajar, and without thinking, I pushed it open, expecting to find Carl, maybe tired from his shift but always so glad to see me, But instead of finding him alone, my world came crashing down.

There, tangled in white sheets and in each other’s arms, were Carl and Dr. Eddie, one of our closest family friends.

Time froze.

My breath caught in my throat, and for a moment, I couldn’t move. I couldn’t process what my eyes were seeing. The gift bag slipped from my fingers, falling to the floor with a soft thud, but I barely heard it. My heart was racing, my pulse pounding in my ears, as the weight of the moment crushed me.

Tears welled up in my eyes before spilling over, hot and fast, as I turned and bolted. I didn’t think, I didn’t stop. I just ran, my legs carrying me away from that room, away from the betrayal, away from the life I thought I had and a life of new beginnings

I had no idea where I was going. My mind was a whirlwind of disbelief, of anger, of hurt. All I knew was I needed to get away from him, from this, from everything.

Hours later, I found myself in a dimly lit bar. The neon signs outside flickered as I stepped through the door, the smell of stale beer and cheap whiskey hanging in the air. I didn’t care. I needed to be anywhere but there.

The bartender glanced at me as I slid onto a barstool, my hands trembling as I wiped my tears, trying to pull myself together.

“Whiskey,” I croaked, my voice thick with emotion.

The bartender raised an eyebrow but didn’t ask questions. He poured the drink and slid it over to me. I picked it up, not caring that it was too strong, too bitter. I needed something to numb the ache in my chest.

I stared into the glass, my mind spinning. My hands shook, the cold of the glass grounding me as I tried to make sense of what had just happened. Carl and Eddie. How long has this been going on? How had I not seen it? How had I been so blind?

I knocked back the whiskey in one go, the burn not doing anything to dull the pain in my heart. The tears started again, falling silently as I fought to breathe through the suffocating weight of betrayal. My wedding anniversary was our third year, and this was how it ended.

How had we gotten here? How have I gotten here?

I didn’t know what to do, where to go, or how to face him. The Carl I had known, the one who promised to never hurt me, the one who swore he would always be there, was gone. All I was left with was a stranger who had broken my trust in the worst way possible.

Another drink was placed in front of me, and I didn’t ask for it. I just took it.

And for a brief, fleeting moment, I allowed myself to forget, as the warmth of the whiskey settled into my stomach, spreading a dull haze over my thoughts. The noise of the bar, the clink of glasses, the murmur of conversations all felt so distant, so irrelevant. The world around me continued, people living their lives, oblivious to the chaos I was drowning in.

My mind kept replaying the scene in the call room, the sight of Carl's face, the way he looked when he saw me, the surprise that crossed his features before it melted into something else, something guarded. Eddie's presence beside him only amplified the sting, the realization that I wasn’t just betrayed by my husband, but by someone I had trusted, someone who had been a part of our lives for so long.

I pushed the thoughts away, not wanting to face them, not wanting to process the magnitude of what had just happened. I reached for the second drink, taking a slow sip, letting the burn pull me back into the moment, into the numbness.

I could feel the ache in my chest, a deep, hollow emptiness that I knew would take time to fill if it ever would. But I couldn’t think about that right now. I couldn’t think about what I was going to do, how I was going to face him, or how I could ever trust him again.

The bartender eyed me carefully, his expression softening as he leaned over the counter. “You okay, sweetheart?” he asked, his voice low and gentle, as if he’d seen it all before.

I forced a smile, but I could feel how fake it was. “Just... just need a moment,” I muttered, my voice rough from the tears I had cried.

He nodded, and I appreciated his quiet understanding. He didn’t push, didn’t try to pry. Just let me be.

I took another sip of my drink, trying to focus on the taste, on the burn, on anything that could distract me from the whirlwind inside my mind. But nothing worked. The image of Carl and Eddie in that bed kept haunting me. The lies, the secrecy, the thought that I had been so sure of our love, was it all a lie? Had it been a lie from the start?

I heard the soft jingle of the bar door opening, followed by the shuffle of footsteps. I didn’t look up, but the sound of those footsteps grew closer and closer until they stopped beside me.",1,1753907178.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

I was on my first date since I got here, but I couldn’t focus on the guy I came with. Instead, my eyes were glued to Charles Wingaryde, or rather, the t-shirt he was wearing. 

“Psychiatrist,” I started reading out loud, “noun—”

Vincent kicked me under the table. 

“Like a normal doctor, only way cooler.”

“Sis, stop, please,” he said. 

“Always right, very smart, and full of good ideas.”

I squinted my eyes. I should have brought my normal glasses. “See also: wizard, arsonist.”

“Okay, that’s enough,” growled Charles. I wasn’t even aware he could do that. He sounded like the child of a mouse and a wolf. “It says awesome, not arsonist.”

“Yeah, you’re not very fiery these days, Charlie,” said Gunnar, looking at me with a smirk. A thousand tingles flurried through my stomach. I smirked back. 

“Seriously though, man,” I said, reluctantly taking my eyes off my date and looking at Charles’s red face, “*This* is the outfit you pick for a date? Of all the clothes you have? That’s a red flag, Vincent.” I looked at my brother. When I squinted my eyes, I could see a smidge of amusement under unnerving embarrassment. “Imagine you go to the theatre to seee… I don’t know, Hamlet or another pretentious old play you love, and he wears this again.”

“You are being childlish, Sol, and for no reason. It won’t impress him, you know,” replied Charles, giving Gunnar a quick glance.

“It’s not *not* working.” Gunnar smiled. “She makes fun of you, after all.”

“Oh, so you admit it’s about me, huh? Good we clarified this early on.”

“God, this was a bad idea.“ Vincent rubbed his temples. “Remind me, why have we decided to do this, Sol?”

“Because we’re freaks, Vincent. We’re freaks that love wading through the awkwardness of it all, you’re just less open about it than me,” I said, leaning back in the chair. “Besides, we needed to clear the air.”

“You love clearing the air, don’t you? But sunlight doesn’t clear the air; in fact, it just makes the dust visible.”

“Wow, Charles, that was so deep. I bet you got a lot of claps at the high school poetry night.”

“Did you even go to high school? I never asked you this,” said Gunnar, slightly tilting his head to the left. He had a necklace wrapped around the tips of his horns, with a little sun as a centerpiece. It tinkled when he moved.

“He didn’t. He’s still a normal doctor, only way cooler“, I answered. “Psychiatrist. A noun, if you will.”

Vincent laughed. Charles let out a weird grunt. I took a sip of my chai latte. 

“It’s better to be yourself in situations like that. Unlike you, I didn’t leave my glasses in my room to look cooler.”

“I left them because my mind predicted you would be wearing that t-shirt and tried to protect me from reading this horrendous inscription,” I said and took another sip. It wasn’t even true, because I was wearing glasses; my cheap, round pink sunglasses I bought at a fair with Vincent years ago. “Besides, I’m wearing my cool glasses.”

“I don’t know if you need another pair of rose-colored glasses right now, Sol,” said Vincent hesitantly. I looked at him and saw a shadow of a sneer escaping his face. 

“Gunnar,” I said, looking at him again, “Are the glasses working?”

He tilted his head again. A flutter of warmth ran through my bones. 

“I wish they didn’t, but yes.”

“Vinny, is the t-shirt working?” asked Charles pleadingly. 

“You don’t have to answer that,” said Gunnar, before my brother even opened his mouth. “Don’t bother yourself with crafting a polite reply. We all know you’re so good with words.”

He smirked again. My smile faded.

“Careful, boy, you’re walking on thin ice,” I said, giving him a warning glance. “Nobody gets away with insulting my brother.”

“Well, I already did,” he said. He took the cup of coffee in both of his hands. His nails were painted black. It nearly distracted me from the idea I’d just had. 

“Hey, can I try your coffee?“ I asked. I could see Vincent was ready to ask why the fuck I want a sip of coffee all of sudden, and I kicked him under the table just the right moment.

Gunnar passed me the cup. His fingers were nearly as cold as mine. 

“You see,” I said, taking the salt from the center of the table, “I’m not good at moralizing speeches, so I don’t know what I actually want to say, but you cannot fuck with his feelings, man, because then you fuck with mine, and I prefer when you fuck with them differently.” 

I held the salt shaker above Gunnar’s cup. The remaining foam was now covered in white crystals. 

“I can just order a different one, you know.” 

“No, you cannot order anything, because it’s not a fucking restaurant. It’s a prison, man, get a grip,” I said, and then, looking him straight in the eye, I slowly spat in his coffee. “Now drink that.”

 I passed him the cup. 

“You’re certainly acting accordingly with this facility being a prison,” replied Gunnar, taking the cup from me. 

“No, she’s acting nasty,” said Charles. Vincent somehow managed to hide even deeper in his leather jacket. A splash of guilt rushed over me, but then he looked at me, and I saw it: laughter in his eyes. I reached the point on the embarrassment scale where everything feels so horrible, it becomes funny. 

Gunnar took a sip of his coffee. 

“What was it you said about the sunshine, Charles?” I looked at him with a smile. “That it lets you see how dirty the air is?”

- No dividends paid to date

Management Discussion

- Business Transformation: Since July 2024, CIMG has shifted focus to digital marketing and distribution, introducing premium “Maca Series” functional food products (Maca-Noni energy drink, Maca Peptide Coffee, Maca Purified Powder, Maca Wine) targeting the Asian health and wellness market.
- Exclusive Distribution: Secured exclusive distribution and sales rights for all maca products produced by an affiliate in Yunnan, China.
- Revenue Concentration: In 2024, 59.5% of total revenue was from Customer CN. In 2023, three customers each contributed over 20% of revenue.
- Operating Shift: Discontinued Korea operations in June 2024, sold loss-generating subsidiaries, and redirected focus to health-centric product lines in Asia.
- Liquidity: As of year-end, very limited cash remains ($464,222) and continued heavy usage of cash for operations implies urgent need for capital. Management states intention to raise additional equity or debt.
- Product Innovation: Investments have shifted from U.S. coffee co-packing toward plant-based wellness beverages. The company emphasizes innovation, branding, and supply quality in the competitive maca supplement space.
- Operating Performance: While revenues rose and margins improved, overall business remains deeply unprofitable, with accumulated deficit now $82,344,722.

Risks

- Going Concern: Auditors included an explanatory paragraph about substantial doubt regarding CIMG’s ability to continue as a going concern because of recurring losses and negative cash flows. Management likewise disclosed this risk.
- Capital Resources: The company has consistently incurred substantial losses (net loss: $8.97 million in 2024, $8.75 million in 2023) and expects continued losses unless future capital is raised or profitability is achieved. Cash used in operations outpaces all incoming funds; external financing is not assured.
- Nasdaq Listing Delinquency: Received multiple deficiency notices from NASDAQ for delays in SEC filings and for not meeting minimum bid price and other continued listing requirements. If not resolved, shares risk delisting.
- Customer Concentration: The bulk of revenue comes from a very small number of distributors (notably Customer CN); loss of or issues with any major account could severely impact sales.
- Inventory Risk: Inventory increased sharply to $4,548,035 (from $772,825), with an $815,498 provision for inventory obsolescence and $1,019,471 in asset impairment losses in 2024, reflecting risks in demand forecasting and inventory management.
- PRC Regulatory and Political Risks: Significant operations in China expose CIMG to PRC government regulatory changes (e.g., new CSRC, M&A, and cybersecurity requirements), currency controls, restrictions on capital outflows, and trade tensions between the U.S. and China. The PRC legal system’s unpredictability and possible restrictions on dividend flows from subsidiaries materially affect the business.
- Supply Chain and Third-Party Dependence: Heavy reliance on third-party suppliers and manufacturers, with potential disruptions in sourcing, quality, or logistics.
- Legal Proceedings: Multiple litigations, some settled without admission of wrongdoing (e.g., Steeped and Curtin cases); others ongoing, including the Kim Litigation and lawsuits from ex-directors. These present potential for additional financial liabilities and distraction of management resources.
- Internal Controls: Material weaknesses or deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting have been cited as a risk, compounded by limited accounting and finance staff.
- Ownership Dilution: Broad discretion in use of new capital raised, significant new share issuances (including a $10M convertible note deal for up to 25,641,023 shares in December 2024), resulting in material dilution to shareholders.
- No Dividends: No history or near-term expectation of dividend payments; all cash is retained for operations.
- Product/Market Risks: The success of new “Maca Series” health products is unproven, and the market is highly competitive with both local and global brands, making future revenue and profit forecasts difficult.

Board and Governance

- New management team in place, significant board and executive turnover during 2024.
- Six-member board with established audit, compensation, and governance committees; new enterprise-level code of conduct in place.
- No equity compensation plan shares authorized as of September 30, 2024; major beneficial owners are primarily outside management and institutional investors.

Summary for Investors

CIMG Inc. is undergoing a strategic transformation, pivoting from U.S.-centric coffee co-packing toward Asia-focused health/wellness products, primarily the new “Maca Series.” While the company achieved a modest return to positive gross margins in FY2024 and reduced its operating expenses, heavy net losses continue, cash burn remains high, and the company’s future survival is dependent upon securing new capital. Additional risks from regulatory complexity in China, Nasdaq compliance, significant customer and inventory concentration, and unresolved litigation add to the volatility. The success of recent pivots into health foods is as yet unproven. Investors should recognize the high-risk nature of the business, heavy dilution, and the urgent need for further funding before considering an investment.

-Green. We live in the desert and my husband always says that he wants green and mountains (although the mountains part may not be totally necessary).

-Some warm, sunny months. I love the sun and the heat, but it doesn't need to be warm year round. I just would like to have a nice summer. 

-It does not have to be a large city. 

-I love historic areas.
 
-Areas/neighborhoods with local coffee shops/restaurants/shopping. Think The Strand in Galveston. We like to go out to eat and have some drinks and I love live music. 

-He travels a lot for work, so an airport within 30 or so minutes is helpful. 

-Farmer's markets with actual produce would be amazing.

-Personality. I don't want endless shopping centers and gray buildings. 

-I would prefer to not live in a super conservative area.

-A yard is a must. I don't mean an acre of land, but we have M/L dogs so we need to be able to have enough of a yard that they can play in. 

-Nice parks. I run and enjoy having nice scenery to look at. 

-Not Texas.

We don't care about walkability or schools. Together, we make about $350k a year. 

Looking forward to your suggestions!

She has a 7 year old son from a prior marriage. Brenda used to ask me to babysit her son if she ever needs to work late or if she just wanted to go out. I don’t mind as Brenda offers to pay me but I refuse, only wanting to help. 

But for about a year, Brenda has been very bad with her time. She’ll tell me she’s going out to dinner at 7 pm but doesn’t get home until midnight. Once she didn’t come home until 9 am the next morning. Any attempts to call or text her goes unanswered mostly. She claims this is because her phone is usually on DND (do not disturb). The last time I babysat for her was 4 months ago when she went to supposedly have coffee with a friend around 8 pm and said she’d be home around 9 but didn’t come home until 4 am.  At that point I cut her off and refused to babysit for her. 

She has since tried to convince me to change my mind and apologized for her past abuse but says she often loses track of time when hanging out. I still refuse to help her again. Now Brenda is back and has asked me several times now to babysit for her on Saturday cause she has an important dinner to attend at a restaurant and it could lead to potential work. Again I bring her past but she promised she will be on time and if she’s late she will pay me $100. 

Wanting to give her one last chance I tell her I’ll babysit but in exchange she needs to agree to share her location with me until she gets home. 

“No why? I don’t even share my location with my dad. And you’re not either of my parents.” Brenda says. 

“It’s so I can make sure that if you’re late I’ll know where you’re at or if you’re in route.” I reply. 

“I won’t be late. Just trust me. There’s no need for me to share my location. That’s weird and stalker-ish to be honest.”

“I don’t think it’s a big deal. I’m only asking you share it until you get home. What do you have to hide?”

“Nothing I’m going to a simple dinner at a restaurant. I’ll even tell you where it’s at so you can call them.”

Brenda says she needs me to commit by end of day today so what should I do? Trust her and hope she comes home on time or refuse to help?

My stomach went cold. My husband was cheating.

I started searching for the store on Instagram, and then I saw the woman.

Maddie Bell, young, blonde, and an influencer--showing off my husband online.

In one photo, she was wearing a delicate gold necklace. A small, interlocking heart-shaped pendant.

My stomach churned. It was the same as the one on Jolie’s credit card bill.

The one Dan bought for “an employee’s baby.”

And from their comments, I learned that they already had a child!

The liar!

The anger became physical and settled in my stomach.

I tried to restrain myself. Now was not the time to fight back. I could let her think she had won first.

————————

Today was supposed to be the happiest day of my life, the tenth anniversary of Ellie's Sweet Sensations, my beloved bakery.

But amidst the flash of cameras and Dan's charming politician's smile, a cold knot tightened in my stomach. Late-night texts, a mysterious credit card charge from a boutique I'd never heard of, ""Jolie's""... then I heard it, Dan cooing ""Love you too, Maddie"" into the phone. The perfect facade cracked; my husband was having an affair.

The betrayal was bad enough, but then she popped up – Maddie Bell, young, blonde, influencer – flaunting my husband online. Vacation photos, the same necklace from Jolie's, and always always right next to my husband. Then I caught wind of THEIR baby. My carefully constructed world started crumbling as I came to terms with the stark reality: He wasn't just cheating; he was building a whole new life with her.

I baked him that cake for our anniversary, knowing I'd soon be but a memory. Then, the ultimate slap – he was going to take Maddie home to meet his parents. The next day, she was at my doorstep feigning sympathy while my world burned. I couldn't stay with all of this on my plate. Not even for Liam.

So I plotted my escape, a theatrical end: a staged car accident with me declared the victim. What kind? The one he causes. Was this revenge or survival? I thought it was both. But what would my story have in store? I started by documenting the full account of his disgusting deed in a diary I knew he would stumble on post-""mortem.""

1

The scent of vanilla and toasted sugar hung thick in the air, a familiar hug.

""Ellie's Sweet Sensations"" was ten years old today.

My bakery. My dream.

The local paper's photographer snapped another picture. Flash.

Dan, my husband, had his arm around my waist, beaming.

""She's a genius, isn't she?"" he said to Maria, the reporter from the New England Chronicle.

Maria scribbled in her notepad. ""Indeed, Mr. Hayes. A town treasure.""

I managed a smile. ""It's a team effort.""

Liam, our son, sixteen now and all angles and artistic brooding, stood a little awkwardly by the tiered cake display, looking proud in his own quiet way.

Publicly, we were the Hayes family. Perfect.

Privately, a small, cold knot had been tightening in my stomach for weeks.

It started with a late-night text on Dan's phone. A heart emoji. I'd told myself it was a constituent. Dan was a politician, after all. Charisma was his currency.

Then, the credit card bill. A charge from ""Jolie's,"" a boutique I'd never heard of, for an amount that made my breath catch. A gift, he'd said, for a staffer's new baby.

It felt...off.

The party buzzed around me. Friends, loyal customers, Bren – my rock, my business partner, her eyes sharp and knowing as she watched me.

Later that evening, after the last guest had left and the bakery was quiet, I found the final clue.

Dan was on the phone in his study, his voice low, intimate.

""...of course, baby. He's my priority, but... you know how it is.""

A pause. Then a soft chuckle.

""Love you too, Maddie.""

Maddie. Not a staffer. Not a constituent.

The floor felt like it had dropped away. The sweet scent of the bakery suddenly turned cloying, suffocating.

The perfect facade had cracked, and the truth was a raw, gaping wound.

The decision settled in my heart like a stone.

I couldn't stay. I wouldn't.

But just leaving wasn't enough. He needed to feel a fraction of what I felt.

The next morning, I sat across from Bren at a small table in the back of the empty bakery, the scent of yesterday's celebration now a mockery.

""He's having an affair, Bren.""

Her face, usually so quick with a joke, hardened. ""That prick.""

""He has another family. Or at least, another woman he tells 'I love you' to.""

I laid out my plan, my voice flat, devoid of the storm raging inside me.

""I'm going to disappear. Stage my death.""

Bren's coffee cup clattered against the saucer. ""Ellie, are you insane?""

""Maybe,"" I admitted. ""But I can't just walk away. He has to pay. He has to live with it.""

I told her about ""New Life Solutions,"" an agency I'd found in the deepest corners of the internet. They specialized in fresh starts. Untraceable.

""I have money, Bren. Enough. My grandmother's inheritance. I want it to be convincing. An accident.""

Bren stared at me, her expression shifting from shock to a dawning, horrified understanding.

""What kind of accident, Ellie?""

""The kind he causes,"" I said, the words tasting like ash. ""I want a mannequin, lifelike, in a car. I want him to hit it. I want him to think he killed me.""

Bren just looked at me, speechless for once.

My resolve was steel. This wasn't just escape. This was revenge.

Flashes of him, of us.

Ten years ago, our own wedding. A small, intimate affair in a Berkshires inn.

I'd baked our cake, a three-tiered lemon raspberry masterpiece. Dan had watched me, his eyes full of an adoration that I'd believed was as real as the sugar flowers I'd crafted.

His hand on my back as we danced.

The way he used to look at me across a crowded room, a secret smile just for me.

Liam's birth. Dan, holding our tiny son, tears in his eyes, whispering, ""My family. My perfect family.""

Had it all been a lie? Every touch, every shared laugh, every whispered promise?

The memories, once sources of warmth, now burned.

They were fuel for the cold fire of my plan. The contrast between that imagined past and the raw present was a constant ache.

He had built his political career on the image of a devoted family man.

I would tear it down, brick by loving, fabricated brick.

A notification pinged on my phone. Instagram.

A suggested post.

Maddie Bell.

Young. Blonde. Perfect teeth, a dazzling smile.

Her feed was a curated collection of beach vacations, trendy restaurants, and selfies that screamed ""look at me.""

She was a social media influencer. Of course.

In one photo, she wore a delicate gold necklace. A small, interlocking heart pendant.

My stomach lurched. It was identical to the one on the Jolie's credit card statement.

The one Dan had bought for ""a staffer's baby.""

The rage was a physical thing, coiling in my gut.

She was everything I wasn't anymore. Young, carefree, unburdened by years of shared history and unspoken disappointments.

And she had my husband.

She was the ""baby"" he was talking to on the phone.

The crisis wasn't just a feeling anymore; it was a face, a name, a constant, taunting presence in my digital world.

Our fifteenth wedding anniversary approached.

A cruel joke.

I found myself going through the motions, a ghost in my own life.

I booked a table at ""The Gilded Spoon,"" the fanciest restaurant in town, the one we'd gone to for our first anniversary.

I bought a new dress, a deep sapphire silk that Bren said made my eyes look electric.

I even baked a small cake – his favorite, dark chocolate with a salted caramel buttercream. Not for the bakery, just for us. A pathetic offering to a dead marriage.

The evening arrived. I dressed with care, a strange detachment settling over me.

Liam was at a friend's house.

The table was set. Candles flickered. The small cake sat under a glass dome.

Seven o'clock. Our reservation time.

Seven-thirty.

Eight.

My phone finally buzzed. A text from Dan.

""So sorry, El. Got held up. Campaign crisis. Raincheck?""

\----------

No call. No elaborate excuse. Just a casual dismissal.

I stared at the flickering candles, the uneaten cake.

The disappointment was a familiar ache, but this time it was sharper, edged with a bitter knowledge.

He wasn't at a campaign meeting.

He was with her. Maddie.

The silence in the house was immense, broken only by the ticking of the grandfather clock in the hall, each tick a nail in the coffin of our marriage.

The next morning, I started to pack.

Not clothes. Not essentials.

Memories.

Liam's first pair of shoes, bronzed and heavy.

The goofy stuffed giraffe Dan won for me at a county fair, its fur worn thin from years of Liam dragging it around.

My grandmother's locket, the one she gave me on my wedding day.

Photographs. So many photographs. Us smiling. Always smiling.

I packed them into sturdy cardboard boxes.

Each item was a stab of pain, a reminder of what I was losing, what had been stolen.

But with each box sealed, a sense of grim satisfaction grew.

This wasn't just an act of clearing out; it was an act of severance.

I addressed the largest box to ""Maddie Bell,"" her address easily found online.

Inside, nestled amongst Liam's childhood treasures, I placed a simple, unsigned card: ""Heirlooms for the new family.""

Let her see what she was helping to destroy. Let her understand the depth of the life she was invading.

My resolve hardened. There was no turning back. I was erasing myself from their narrative, one packed memory at a time.

I was taping up the last box when I heard the front door open.

""Mom? We're home!"" Liam's voice, still boyish despite his height.

Followed by Dan's deeper, more practiced tones. ""Ellie? You here, honey?""

My heart hammered. They weren't supposed to be back for hours.

I quickly pushed the boxes into the back of the hall closet, my hands trembling slightly.

Dan appeared in the doorway of the living room, where I was standing amidst a feigned attempt at tidying.

He was smiling, that charming politician's smile that could win over any crowd.

""Hey. Sorry about last night. Things got crazy.""

Liam came up behind him, looking tired but happy. ""The concert was awesome, Mom. You should've come.""

""Dan took me and Maddie,"" Liam said, oblivious. ""She knows the band.""

The name, ""Maddie,"" hung in the air between us, casual, innocent from Liam's lips.

To me, it was a detonation.

Dan's smile didn't waver, but a flicker of something – annoyance? – crossed his eyes.

""Maddie Bell. She's a... a friend. Helping with youth outreach for the campaign.""

A lie. So smooth. So practiced.

My plan, which had felt so clear, so righteous, suddenly felt precarious. They were here. In my space. Breathing my air.

I needed them gone.

I pasted on a smile. ""Sounds like fun. I was just... decluttering.""

Dan stepped further into the room, his eyes scanning, perhaps noticing the faint scent of cardboard.

He held out a small, gift-wrapped box.

""A\_little something for our anniversary. Since I messed up dinner.""

His voice was all contrition, oozing sincerity.

I took the box. It felt light, insignificant.

Inside, a silver bracelet. Delicate. Pretty.

And utterly meaningless.

It felt like a prop, another piece of the facade he so carefully maintained.

""It's beautiful, Dan. Thank you."" My voice sounded hollow even to my own ears.

He leaned in to peck me. I turned my head slightly, so his lips brushed my cheek. His scent, once a comfort, now repelled me.

He pulled back, a slight frown creasing his brow. ""Everything okay, El?""

""Just tired,"" I said. ""Long day.""

The lie came easily. I was learning from the master.

Liam, bless his innocent heart, piped up, ""Maddie said she's a huge fan of your cakes, Mom. She wants to come by the bakery sometime.""

My eyes met Dan's over Liam's head. His expression was suddenly tight.

The cold knot in my stomach turned to ice.

He was bringing her into my world, into my son's life, without a shred of shame.

The bracelet felt heavy on my wrist, a shackle.

I wanted to scream. I wanted to throw the gift in his face.

Instead, I smiled again, a rictus of forced pleasantry. ""That's... nice.""

The final, definitive blow didn't come from Dan. It came from Liam.

Later that evening, as I was helping him with a history assignment, he was scrolling through photos on his phone from the concert.

""Look, Mom, this is Maddie.""

He turned the screen towards me.

There she was. Maddie Bell. Arm in arm with Dan. Both of them laughing, heads thrown back, looking entirely too comfortable, too intimate.

Dan's hand was on her waist, a casual possessiveness that made my blood run cold.

It wasn't a ""networking event."" It wasn't ""youth outreach.""

It was a date. My husband, on a date with his mistress, with our son as an unwitting chaperone.

""She's really cool, Mom,"" Liam continued, oblivious to the way the world had just tilted on its axis for me. ""She said you and Dad are like, total couple goals.""

Couple goals. The irony was a bitter pill.

Any lingering doubt, any tiny, desperate hope that I had misunderstood, that it was all some horrible mistake, evaporated.

Shattered.

The pain was so intense, it was almost a relief. There was no more ambiguity, no more hoping. Just the stark, ugly truth.

My carefully constructed composure crumbled, just for a second, before I pulled it back together.

""She sounds... friendly,"" I managed, my voice a strained whisper.

The next day, a new follow request on my bakery's Instagram page.

Maddie\_Bell.

Then a DM.

A picture. Her, wearing the interlocking heart necklace. The caption: ""Feeling loved.""

Followed by a message: ""Ellie! Liam told me so much about your amazing bakery. I'm your husband's... colleague. Dan talks about you all the time. He says you're an incredible woman. Would love to connect! Maybe grab coffee? ""

The audacity. The sheer, unadulterated gall.

She wasn't just having an affair with my husband. She was actively taunting me.

The smiling emoji felt like a punch to the gut.

This wasn't an accidental slip. This was a power play.

She wanted me to know. She wanted me to see her, to acknowledge her presence in his life, in our life.

My fingers hovered over the block button.

No. Not yet.

1mdh81z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novelnews/comments/1mdh81z/in_her_court_novel_tori_and_ethan/,In Her Court Novel - Tori and Ethan,"She plays to win. He plays it cool. But neither expected to fall for their fiercest rival. Tori Martinez is a star libero on the Westridge University volleyball team, known for her unmatched reflexes, discipline, and ironclad focus. She's built her life around control-on the court, in class, and especially when it comes to avoiding cocky tennis golden boy, Ethan Harrington. Ethan has it all: charm, talent, and a family legacy built into the school's tennis program. But behind the perfect serves and effortless smiles is a young man crushed under the weight of expectations. When an economics project pairs him with the no-nonsense Tori, he's intrigued-and determined to break through her icy exterior. What starts as academic rivalry turns into unexpected chemistry, and one impulsive night threatens to upend both their carefully structured worlds. But with a championship on the line, a scout's visit that could change Tori's future, and secrets neither of them are ready to face, winning may come at a cost neither anticipated.



**TORI’S POV**

Wham!

My palm smacked the ball clean over the net and straight to the floor on the other side, untouched. A perfect dig and spike combo. The squeak of sneakers and scattered applause followed, but all I heard was the thundering in my ears.

*Everyone’s watching. Don’t screw this up, Tori.*

Coach blew her whistle. “Nice read, Martinez. Reset!”

""Thanks, Coach,"" I said, trying to sound casual while my heart hammered against my ribs.

""Let's run that drill again. Positions, everyone!”

I jogged back to position, trying to ignore the tight coil of tension winding in my chest. It didn’t matter that I’d just nailed the play. It didn’t matter that I’d probably watched more films this week than slept. One bad move, one weak pass, and someone would decide I wasn’t worth the starting slot anymore.

And that would mean my scholarship was at stake.

My ponytail stuck to the back of my neck. Sweat dripped down my spine. I bounced on the balls of my feet, waiting for the next serve when the gym’s double doors swung open, and the athletic director’s voice cut through practice.

Coach Rivera's whistle dangled from her mouth as she met him halfway across the court. Their conversation was brief, with lots of hand gestures from Coach and head shaking from Peterson.

""Ladies, huddle up,"" Coach called, her voice tight.

We gathered around her, still breathing hard from the drills.

""Apparently,"" she started, not hiding her irritation, ""the tennis team needs indoor practice space today. Something about court resurfacing.""

""Are you serious?"" I blurted. ""We have regionals in two weeks!""

""I'm aware, Tori. But we've been told to share the space. Half-court practice for the remainder of the week.""

I felt heat rising in my chest. ""This is such bull—""

""Language,"" Coach cut me off. ""I don't like it either, but we'll adapt. That's what champions do.""

Maya nudged me. ""Breathe, Tori.""

But I was already seething. Of course, the women's volleyball team gets squeezed. Of course. Never the precious boys' basketball team or football team. Just us. Always us.

As if on cue, the tennis team started filing in, equipment bags slung over their shoulders. Leading the pack was Ethan Harrington, golden boy of Westlake High, with his perfect hair and perfect grades and perfect everything.

He leaned against the wall near our court, observing us with an easy smile that made me want to spike a volleyball directly at his face.

""Problem, Tori?"" Coach asked, noting my expression.

""No, Coach."" I tightened my ponytail.

For the next thirty minutes, I channeled my frustration into each serve, sending the ball whistling over the net with probably more force than necessary. I was aware of the tennis team setting up on the other half of the gym, their voices and laughter mixing with our focused calls.

""Nice form,"" came a voice from too close behind me.

I turned to find the famous jerk standing there, spinning a tennis ball on his fingertips. Ethan is the captain of the school’s tennis team. Notorious for being a champion, a playboy and a spoilt brat born with a silver spoon. With his personality, I view him as arrogant and pompous, even though our paths has never crossed until now.

""Excuse me?""

""Your serve. Good technique. You get a lot of power for someone your size.""

I stared at him in surprise. ""For someone my size?""

He backpedaled immediately. ""I just meant it's impressive. The way you—""

""Don't you have your own practice to worry about?"" I cut him off, grabbing another volleyball from the cart.

""Just being friendly, Martinez."" That smile again. Like everything in life came so easily to him.

""Well, I'm trying to focus here."" I turned my back to him, signaling the end of our conversation.

But he lingered. ""You know, both our teams got screwed with this arrangement.""

""Feels like my team got more screwed than yours,"" I muttered.

""Maybe."" He shrugged. ""But we could make it work. Coordinate drills so we're not sending balls into each other's spaces. I could talk to Coach Winters.""

I glanced over my shoulder. ""We don't need your help.""

""Everyone needs help sometimes.""

""Not from you.""

He laughed, which only irritated me more. ""You really don't like me, do you? Have I done something specific, or is this just a general disdain?”

I watch him and he shrugged, picking up a stray volleyball and spinning it on his finger.

I snatched the ball from him. “Maybe next time wait for an invite before taking over.”

His eyebrows lifted. “Ouch.”

I turned away before I said something I'd regret. Why does he always sound like he’s flirting even when he’s just breathing?

He laughed softly behind me. The sound crawled under my skin like static.

Practice ended with more drills and less dignity. I grabbed my bag and made a beeline to the locker room, my mind already switching gears. I had econ in twenty, and I was not about to let Harrington or his stupid cologne derail my afternoon.

*Focus, Tori. One more class to go for the day, then recovery session, then film, and then dinner.*

That’s how I liked my schedules; structured.

\*\*\*

""Settle down, everyone,"" Professor Chen walked into the class, adjusting her glasses. ""Today we're discussing price elasticity of demand, and then I'll be announcing your semester project partners.""

My stomach dropped. Group projects were the worst—always carrying someone else's weight, coordinating around other people's chaotic schedules.

Fifty minutes later, as students began packing up their notebooks, Professor Chen raised her hand.

""Before you go, let me announce the project partnerships.”

The Professor began some groupings. She began reading names from her list. I half-listened until my name was called.

Tori Martinez.

I shot to my feet immediately.

“You'll be working with Harrington.""

I froze. ""Tennis Harrington?""

""Is there a problem?"" she asked, eyebrow raised.

I cleared my throat, forcing my jaw to stay still. “No problem.”

“Good. The project is thirty percent of your grade,” she added, just twisting the knife. “And as I mentioned before, anyone who fails this class is immediately put on academic probation.”

Academic probation. The kiss of death for student-athletes and a bigger problem for me, a scholarship kid.

“No pressure,” came that infuriatingly smooth voice behind me. “We’re actually already sports facility roommates. Isn’t that right, Martinez?”

His cologne registering before I could stop myself from noticing it. I turned slowly to find Ethan Harrington standing too close with a mischievous smirk on his face.

  
**ETHAN’S POV**

I couldn't help the smile that spread across my face as I watched Tori Martinez's shoulders tense up.

""Tennis Harrington?"" Tori asked, her voice tight.

""Is there a problem?"" Professor Chen looked at her over the rim of her glasses.

""No problem,"" I said, deliberately keeping my voice casual. ""We're actually already sports facility roommates. Isn't that right, Martinez?""

Tori turned around, and those dark eyes narrowed when they landed on me. Up close, I could see flecks of gold in her brown irises. She smelled like coconut shampoo and determination.

""Perfect,"" Professor Chen said, gathering her papers. ""You two can figure out a schedule. The project outline is posted online. I need a proposal by Friday.""

She walked out, leaving us alone in the classroom. I watched Tori's jaw clench as she turned back to her desk and started shoving books into her backpack with more force than necessary.

""So,"" I leaned against the desk next to hers, ""economics partners. This should be interesting.""

""Fascinating,"" she muttered without looking up.

I'd seen Tori around school for years, of course. But I'd never really noticed her until three days ago, when our teams got forced to share the gym. Something about the way she'd launched herself across the court, saving a ball that seemed impossible to reach, had caught my attention.

Most girls at our school tried so hard around me – laughing too loud at my jokes, twirling their hair, dropping hints about homecoming. Tori Martinez looked like she'd rather drop a dumbbell on my foot.

I found that refreshing.

""Do you have a topic preference?"" I asked, trying to sound professional. ""I was thinking something about sports economics might be fitting. Given our shared interests.""

Tori zipped her bag shut. ""I don't care what the topic is as long as we get an A.""

""I've never gotten less than an A in econ,"" I said, then immediately regretted how boastful it sounded.

She finally looked at me, eyebrows raised. ""Good for you.""

""I mean,"" I backtracked, ""we'll do fine. We're both smart.""

""Look,"" she sighed, slinging her bag over her shoulder. ""Let's just divide the work and get this over with. You do your part, I'll do mine, we'll stick it together and present it.""

This wasn't going how I'd hoped. I'd asked Jake about her yesterday after practice.

""Tori Martinez?"" he'd said. ""Yeah, she's scary smart. Super intense about volleyball. Doesn't really hang out with anyone except her teammates. Why?""

I'd shrugged. ""Just curious.""

""Dude,"" Jake had grinned, ""don't tell me you're into Volleyball Girls?""

""I'm not into anyone,"" I'd replied, maybe too quickly. ""Just wondering who I'm sharing the gym space with.""

Now, watching her try to escape our conversation as fast as possible, I felt a spark of challenge ignite. Ethan Harrington didn't back down from challenges.

""Actually,"" I said, stepping to block her path slightly, ""I think we should work on this together. Professor Chen pairs people based on complementary skills. We might learn something from each other.""

Tori checked her watch. ""I have practice in twenty minutes.""

""Perfect. So do I. Let's grab coffee first and hash out a plan."" I gave her my most winning smile, the one that usually got me what I wanted.

She stared at me like I'd suggested we rob a bank. ""Coffee.""

""Yeah, you know, that brown liquid people drink when they need to stay awake? There's a café right on campus.""

""I know what coffee is, Harrington,"" she snapped. ""What I don't understand is why you think I want to drink it with you.""

I tilted my head. ""Because we're partners? Because it's a normal thing that partners do when they need to work together?""

""No.""

""No?""

""No coffee. No hanging out. No pretending we're friends."" She adjusted her bag strap. ""Let's just divide the workload, and communicate when necessary.""

Something about her immediate dismissal sparked a competitive fire in me. The same feeling I got on the court when an opponent underestimated me.

""Are you always this difficult, or am I special?""

Her eyes flashed. ""Are you always this entitled, or am I special?""

I blinked, taken aback. Girls didn't usually talk to me like that. ""Entitled?""

""Yes, entitled. You waltz in here, flash your perfect smile, and expect me to drop everything for impromptu coffee because the great Ethan Harrington suggested it.""

""It's just coffee,"" I said, feeling oddly defensive.

""It's my time,"" she countered. ""And I don't have any to waste.""

She tried to step around me, but I moved with her, not quite blocking her but making it impossible to leave without acknowledging me.

""What's your deal with me, anyway?"" I asked, genuinely curious now. ""You've been giving me the cold shoulder since the gym situation. That wasn't my fault, you know.""

""I don't have a 'deal' with you,"" she said, using air quotes. ""I just don't see why I should pretend to like you to make this project more comfortable.""

""Most people actually do like me,"" I pointed out.

She rolled her eyes. ""Yes, I'm aware of your popularity status. Congratulations.""

I found myself getting irritated now. ""You don't know anything about me.""

""I know enough,"" she said. ""Golden boy tennis star with the perfect hair and perfect life who's never had to fight for anything. You probably coast through everything with natural talent and good looks.""

Her words hit with unexpected precision. Like she'd somehow seen through the carefully constructed image I maintained, straight to my deepest insecurity.

""You have no idea what I fight for,"" I said, my voice lower now, the easy smile gone. ""You think you've got me all figured out in your neat little box? At least I'm not so scared of being wrong about someone that I won't even have a simple conversation.""

Her eyes widened slightly, and I knew I'd hit a nerve too.

""I'm not scared,"" she said, but there was a slight waver in her voice.

""Prove it. One coffee. Talk about the project. If you still think I'm the shallow jerk you've decided I am, fine. We'll do it your way.""

She stared at me, and for a second, I thought she might actually agree.

Instead, she shook her head. ""I have to get to practice.""

She shouldered past me, feeling me alone in the empty classroom.

Matcha \
Roasted sesame oil \
Peanut butter/ nut butters\
Cocoa powder \
Vanilla, almond extract\
Brown sugar\
Molasses\
Honey\

What should I tweak?

	•	Lower pressure?

	•	Blend with better beans?
