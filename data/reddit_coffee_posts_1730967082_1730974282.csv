Now, since i've started working in a office I restarted drinking coffee, and it became an excellent discovery.

I bought pods for office and pouder for moka for home, i also bought an aluminium moka for only one cup. I started a new daily routine, a ritual that can relax me.

But now... i don't like moka coffee anymore... i don't understand way, but i car drink only coffees from pods or caps...

I'm asking if simply my tastes changed since i use to drink pods and caps coffees, or if something with my moka is wrong.  
Moka coffee flavour is a bit too bitter and acid, and sometimes i also think it smells a bit burnt. Everything started when i forgot moka on fire for five minutes too much, with only water because that was a cleaning cycle.

Match-fixing monopoly groups vs fair-play businesses - moment has come to choose freedom over fear

RAHUL GANDHI

INDIA WAS SILENCED by the East India Company. It was silenced not by its business prowess, but by its chokehold. The Company choked India by partnering with, bribing and threatening our more pliant maharajas and nawabs. It controlled our banking, bureaucratic, and information networks. We didn't lose our freedom to another nation; we lost it to a monopolistic corporation that ran a coercive apparatus.

The Company controlled the terms of trade and obliterated competition. It dictated who sold what and to whom. It wiped out our textile industry and manufacturing system. I do not know of any product innovation or market development the Company performed. What I do know is that it secured a monopoly for the cultivation of opium in one region and developed a captive market of opium addicts in another. Yet, while the Company plundered India, it behaved as a model corporate citizen in the UK. Its foreign shareholders loved it.

The original East India Company wound up over 150 years ago, but the raw fear it then generated is back. A new breed of monopolists has taken its place. They have amassed colossal wealth, even as India has become far more unequal and unfair for everybody else. Our institutions no longer belong to our people, they do the bidding of monopolists. Lakhs of businesses have been decimated and India is unable to generate jobs for her youth. Bharat Mata is mother to all her children. The monopolisation of her resources and power, this blatant denial of the many for the sake of a chosen few, has wounded her.

I know that hundreds of India's brilliant and dynamic business leaders are scared of the monopolists. Are you one of them? Scared to talk on the phone? Scared of the monopolists colluding with the state to enter your sector and crush you? Scared of IT, CBI or ED raids forcing you to sell your business to them? Scared of them starving you of capital when you need it the most? Scared of them changing the rules of the game mid- way to ambush you?

You know that describing these oligarchic groups as businesses is misleading When you compete with them, you are not competing with a company, you are fighting the machinery of the Indian state. Their core competence is not products, consumers or ideas, it is their ability to control India's governing institutions and regulators-and, in surveillance. Unlike you, these groups de cide what Indians read and watch, they in fluence how Indians think and what they speak. Today, market forces do not determine success, power relations do.

There is fear in your hearts. But there is also hope.

In contrast to the ""match-fixing"" monopoly groups, there is a larger number of amazing ""play-fair"" Indian businesses, from mi- cro-enterprises to large corporations, but you are silent. You persevere in an oppres- sive system. Consider Peyush Bansal, a first generation entrepreneur with no political contacts, who started a business when he was just 22. He went on to co-found Lenskart in 2010, which reshaped the eye wear sector. Today, Lenskart provides em- ployment to thousands across India. Then take Faqir Chand Kohli who, as a manager, built Tata Consultancy in the 1970s. It was a triumph of ambition over fear, the guts to take on giants like IBM and Accenture in their backyard. TCS and other pioneers transformed global IT services from a boutique process to an industrial process. I have never personally known Bansal or the late FC Kohli. It could well be that their political preferences diverge/diverged from mine. So what? It seems that companies like Tynor, InMobi, Manyavar, Zomato, Fractal Analytics, Araku Coffee, Tredence, Amagi, iD Fresh Food, PhonePe, Moglix, Sula Vineyards, Juspay, Zerodha, Veritas, Oxyzo, Avendus, from the younger lot, and L&T, Haldiram,
Aravind Eye Hospital, Indigo, Asian Paints,
HDFC group, Bajaj Auto and Bajaj Finance, Cipla,  Mahindra Auto, Titan, from the older lot-most I hardly know personally-are a tiny sample of homegrown companies that have innovated and chosen to play by the rules. I am sure I have left out hundreds of names which fit the bill even better, but you understand my point.

My politics has always been about protecting the weak and voiceless. I draw my inspiration from Gandhiji's words about de- fending the last voiceless person in the ""line"". This conviction made me support MNREGA, the Right to Food and the Land Acquisition Bill. I stood with the Adivasis in the famous confrontation of Niyamgiri. I backed our farmers in their struggle against the three black farm laws. I listened to the pain of the people of Manipur.

But I realised I had missed the full depth of Gandhiji's words. I failed to pick up that ""line"" is a metaphor-that, in fact, there are many different ""lines"" in society. In the ""line"" you stand in, that of business, it is you who are the exploited, the disadvantaged. And so, my politics will aim to provide you with what you have been denied - fairness and freedom to operate.

The government cannot be allowed to support one business at the expense of all others, much less support benami equations in the business system. Government agencies are not weapons to be used to attack and intimidate businesses. That said, I do not believe that fear should be transferred from you to these big monopolists. They are not evil individuals, but simply the outcome of the deficiencies of our societal and political environment. They should get space, and so should you.

This country is for all of us. Our banks should overcome their fascination for the top 100 well-connected borrowers with their attendant NPAs and be made to dis- cover the profit pools in lending and sup-porting the play-fair businesses. Finally, we must not underestimate the power of social pressure and resistance in moulding political behaviour. There is no need for messiahs. You are the change that will generate wealth and employment for all.

I believe a new deal for progressive Indian business is an idea whose time has come.

1. Accessing library songs (albums or playlists) is so very much quicker in Plex rather than Plexamp - iOS apps. This is particularly noticeable on a very remote (coffee house miles away from a macOS Plex media server!). Plex is remarkably virtually instant in showing and playing a track. Plexamp whirrs away‚Ä¶.getting there after 5+ seconds.

2. Elan has previously confirmed that both apps use the same audio subsystem. However I can discern a slightly ‚Äúlighter‚Äù ‚Äúmore open‚Äù audio in Plex as against Plexamp (both chromecast and airplay) Could this also be a function of how the two apps trigger/handle WiFi ? 

3. Possibly different in cause ‚Ä¶ lyrics appear quicker and seem more in synch in Plex

1glmpnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee_Machines/comments/1glmpnt/wanted_quality_grinder_at_relatively_affordable/,Wanted: Quality grinder at (relatively) affordable price,"Hi!

I looked through the old posts but didn't find anything newer than 4 years ago, so I thought I would pose the question fresh.

My husband loves fresh coffee, to the extent that since I've known him he always grinds fresh beans every day, uses local beans, and either uses a French press or a pour over method to make his coffee every morning. He has expressed interest in upgrading his cheap blade grinder (sorry if the terminology is wrong) and wants to upgrade to a burr grinder. I have $150-$175 to spend on him for Christmas. Any recommendations on which grinder is the best option?

I looked at the Baratza in that price range, but I saw a number of reviews that said the grinder broke within a year. It's hard to tell what is user error and what is actual defect. I also looked at a Cuisinart option for 1/3 the price and it looked nice, but I also feel like a brand like Baratza that sells $800+ grinders probably knows a thing or two and the lower model will still be worth it.

I'll take any guidance I can get. I don't drink coffee myself so I have to rely on others to tell me what's actually good. TIA!!

Update: thank you all so much for your help and advice! The coffee sub is really a welcoming place! I'll be checking out the Baratza site for their refurbished options and if that doesn't work out I'll check out the Encore. Thank you all so much!!",3,1730972105.0,Coffee_Machines,2,1.0,False
1glmpel,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1glmpel,I made a card game,"I've been spending the past year and a half
developing a card game in my down time,
focused on a balance between simplicity and strategy. I am an avid Magic the Gathering player, however as much as I love the game for it's mechanics and interaction, I have always struggled to get my friends and family interested because of the steep learning curve and time commitment required for a game (commander is my preferred format).

This got me thinking - could I make something with all my favorite elements of card games? The interaction of Magic, the bluffing of Poker, and the ease of casual party games (eg. UNO, Unstable Unicorns, Loveletter).

I started by considering the audience for the game. It had to be the sort of thing that could find a home in casual settings like on a coffee table, office staff room, at a bar or pub but likewise present at a competitive games tournament.
I wanted it to be quick to learn, so that people could share it with friends without any prior card game experience, and have a quick game whilst having a coffee, on a train, or as a refresher between rounds of Magic the Gathering.

I settled on making a competitive turn-based game with a simple ""draw a card, play a card"" mechanic. It revolves around the player being a villain, raiding a town and attempting to stash the most loot.

The element of suspense that brings the fun to the game is that until your loot is stashed, other players can interact with it - but players can only make one action per turn so there's this fantastic balance of pushing your luck and trying to read your opponent's next move. It's tactical and psychological and spiteful and I couldn't be happier with how it turned out. 

The design process started with getting a standard deck of cards and a Sharpie, and deciding the basic objective of the game. I decided to make the win condition point-based, and then worked backward to think how a player might accumulate points. Point collection should be a challenge, so I considered how other players might be able to prevent that point collection.
After I had worked out the rules, I mocked up some placeholder artworks and went about designing the look of the cards in Photoshop. I've always loved graphic design and I certainly enjoyed the design process of finding a cohesive ""look and feel"" for the cards. I printed these out on 250gsm cardstock at a local office supply store and cut them out by hand. This process went through many iterations based on player feedback before I was happy with the look of the cards.

It's worth me mentioning here that whilst there is a stigma around AI-generated artwork, this project certainly would have been abandoned at the early stages without it. I'm not talented enough to illustrate myself, nor am I affluent enough to afford a professional artist for a passion-project, but it's allowed me to take my ideas and see them become reality. I truly believe that AI is a fantastic tool that creators can embrace to enhance their work and help bring their ideas to life. This project was always a passion project and not a money-making exercise, but if it ever takes off, the first thing I'll be doing is hiring a professional illustrator to re-do all the artwork. (I've got my eyes on [Pig Hands](https://www.instagram.com/pighands?igsh=bHVtbW45eDZyZ3N5), who did some incredible artwork for recent Magic the Gathering sets). 

After months of designing, chatting with playtesters, and redesigning, I got a test deck printed at [MPC.](http://makeplayingcards.com) From there, I did a little more refining to the overall look and feel of the cards, and now I'm absolutely stoked to say that the final product is truly ready to share with a wider audience.

The feedback for the final version of the game has been overwhelmingly positive, and above all else, the satisfaction of watching people play something I put together and actually genuinely enjoy it is so wholesome and was absolutely worth the time and effort.

If you're interested in checking it out, have a look at my [website](http://www.stashcardgame.com) or l've also got some info on [Boardgamegeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/428018/stash-card-game).

1glmocm,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1glmocm/kf6_one_week_on_review/,KF6 - one week on review ,"So my KF6 arrived a week ago and here are my thoughts on it so far

First question people probably have is why not the 7 or 8? Well the UK pricing verges on insane as you move up the model range and i thought i would not need any of the functionality of the more expensive models (more on that later). 

Unboxing and set up was dead easy, the one screen display has a run through of what to do, aside from water hardness - the number of blocks (5) on the test strip did not correspond to the number of blocks on the display (4) but as the water in my area is very hard it wasn‚Äôt a real issue for me. 

Drinks - this machine makes a much stronger shot of espresso compared to my previous delonghi machine. I am trying to get the strength and body combo just as we like it but are yet to get it spot on at the moment. We have tried our third set of beans to get a taste we like and are getting close, but a full on strong espresso bean on the maximum strength setting makes for a very strong tasting drink. 

I haven‚Äôt made a latte yet as they aren‚Äôt my thing. However the cappuccino is pretty good and is consistent, far more than i would ever expect to get milk doing it manually. My favourite milk based drink is the macchiato adding a nice bit of foam to a shot. 

Any drawbacks? One minor one, you cannot alter the order of milk/coffee on the KF6 like you can on the 7 and 8. A very minor issue and probably doesn‚Äôt hugely matter but something i wasn‚Äôt aware of when purchasing. 

Good things? Makes consistently good strong coffee. For our tastes the shorter drinks menu is not an issue, but may be for some so the 7 or 8 may be a better option. The self cleaning function for the milk tube is a nice touch and makes it pretty hassle free after using the machine for milk drinks. Overall very pleased with the machine.

I've reached that age where 'I'm just tired' no longer explains why I look like I haven't slept since 2019. So, I decided to try out these brightening eye masks from DRMTLGY. Here's what happened.

# First Impressions

So I'm standing in front of my bathroom mirror, holding what looks like transparent jellyfish for my face. The marketing promised me I'd look ""well-rested in 15 minutes,"" which honestly sounded about as realistic as my plan to start meal prepping with any consistency.

But to be fair, these little half-moon-shaped pieces of hope actually feel fancy. The moment I pulled them out, they were dripping with serum - not in a help, I'm drowning way, but more like a this is what luxury feels like way.

I'll admit, my first attempt at applying them was less than graceful. But after a few tries, I got the hang of it.

# My Favorite Features

**The Cooling Effect:** You know that feeling when you press cold spoons against your eyes after crying through the entire season finale of your favorite show? These masks deliver that same cooling sensation, but without the weird looks when your partner catches you with silverware on your face. The cooling effect isn't just for fun (though it does feel like your face is getting a mini vacation to Antarctica) - it actually helps reduce puffiness.

**Hyaluronic Acid:** This ingredient is basically like giving your under-eye area a tall drink of water. And unlike that guy who ghosted me after three dates, hyaluronic acid actually commits to hydrating your skin cells. 

**Caffeine-Infused:** Yes, there's caffeine IN the masks. It's like having a barista for your face. The caffeine constricts the blood vessels and reduces puffiness, which is basically like Spanx for your eye bags.

**Niacinamide:** It brightens, it strengthens.  It's great at tackling dark circles.

**The 30-Pair Value Pack:** Because one pair isn't enough when you're fighting a lifelong battle against looking like you've been studying for finals for 20 years straight.

# Real World Performance

I've worn these masks in various situations with pretty good results.

* After a wedding where I danced like nobody was watching (but everyone definitely was)
* When my neighbor's rooster decided 3am was morning
* Before a high school reunion where I needed to look like I've made better life choices.

But let's be honest about what these masks can and can't do. They can't make you look like you're 21 again (unless you're currently 20). Although they can reduce puffiness, make you look more refreshed, and the give better under-eye hydration than most fancy creams.

# Pros

**Quick Results:** These work faster than my morning coffee kicks in, which is saying something considering I mainline espresso like it's oxygen these days.

**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** My face usually treats new products like personal attacks, but these masks are gentler than a butterfly landing on a marshmallow.

**They Stay-Put:** Once you master the application (which, admittedly, took me longer than I'd like to admit), these things stay put.

**Visible Difference:** They actually make you look like you've slept 8 hours (even when you've only managed 4 and spent the other 4 scrolling through random Wikipedia articles).

# Cons

**The Price:** The cost makes me cry a little. It's like my money saw a spa menu and decided to order everything.

**Initial Sliding:** There's definitely a learning curve with application. The first few times, they slid around all over the place.

**Addictive Results:** You might get used to looking well-rested. Side effects may include actually having to maintain this level of appearance.

# Final Thoughts

These masks are perfect for:

* Anyone who's ever been asked ""Are you sick?"" when they're just tired
* People who want to look alive without performing necromancy
* Those who understand that ""just drink more water"" isn't always the answer
* Anyone who's ever tried to convince themselves that dark circles are a fashion statement

They might not be for:

* People who actually get 8 hours of sleep (who are you and what's your secret?)
* Those who think cucumbers on eyes are still cutting edge
* Anyone expecting miracle-worker-level results without putting in the 15 minutes

Thing kinda blew up, and that caused me to wanna give a small update and clear some stuff up.

So first, let me stress that my field is very niche, with few employment opportunities. It is also, as some of you suggested - niche.

1. Okay okay, seriously now. As some of you actually guessed the field is medicine in a small county. This means that there aren't many spots on the residency program, but also a pretty constant influx of students & interns. The field is pretty lucrative - shitty hours, yes, but great money & a lot of prestige. 

2. Some asked about an exit interview at the end of the trial- had one of those. Said I didn't really vibe with the culture & certain aspects of the way they did things. Didn't name Jerk.

3. As a young (relatively speaking) specialist in my field in a not very large department - I get to weigh in on potential colleagues, so if I say someone sucks, that bears some weight. And if a department starts having issues attracting the best candidates because its chief resident is a jerk, that's gonna be an issue.

So with that out of the way, let's get to the update.

A lot of you were very curious as to what had actually happened to him. So, I reached out to some friends. He's still a doctor (obviously), but he just went into another specialty, which given how long he worked to become chief resident is telling. He does okay probably?

The reason for the update - it turns out I know his wife. I LIKE his wife - she was a year ahead of me in medschool. Got curious so I texted her. Turns out she's not actually his wife anymore - she's his ex. They got divorced. Had coffee with her, still a lovely woman. She's not on reddit but apparently this thing got on out at some point and reached her? Well I told her about this and she couldn't believe it was me. Except she could, because she suspected it was me because I apparently sound like a twat when I express myself in writing, which she remembers from my days at the student council equivalent and my many, many emails. So... okay? Still, had a good time. We're getting coffee again on Sunday.

Anyway I didn't have anything to do with his firing, but after he was let go, presumably quite unamicably, he decided to move abroad after not being able to get into another department here. This didn't come to fruition but it DID cause a rift in their marriage, which then led to divorce. So... maybe I kinda torpedoed his marriage too?

And yeah, that's about it for the update. Will let you know if I get beaten up in a parking lot though, as some of you suggested I might.",78,1730970397.0,pettyrevenge,13,0.85,False

Please understand and to give a brief bit of unrelated background. I'm a normal guy, some bisexual tendancies. I suffered a lot of abuse when I was a child to being a young teenager. I don't want to get into that aspect of my question and story. Please give some consideration (I know it's the internet). I've just come to a place after a lot of work or relaxing around sex. It's all going positive. I'm not a virgin, I've had bad relationships which now make sense after doing therapy work. I've had good relationships where I have been a good lover to my partner. 

It's only recently I had an orgasm. Full ejucalate release when I have been doing some body positivity and acceptance. I've gotten fit as hell physically as well as mentally so a lot of shifts. 

I am just getting back to being open to having sexual relationships. 

I know size doesn't matter and it matters to some that have preference. I'm happy and fine with my üçÜ. 

That's all good.

Recently I had an encounter with a lovely American woman who I connected with via an app.

She was quite open that she just wanted to fun trip in the UK. Was leaving in a couple of days. We got a coffee went for a wonder. Went for a drink and had a night together. 

It was only oral and heavy make out. 

She brought up something which feels a little embarrassing but wasn't humiliating. It was a really good experience but even with my limited experience I hadn't had someone talki to me about it. 

Everything on my body was neatly trimmed. I had done some nice manscaping. I do Martial Arts daily and swimming so I've lost around 40kg over the last 6 years. 

She was larger but beautiful. Really cute and very confident. Really confident in her sexuality and she did take control in the bedroom. A bit of a soft dom but I'm a big guy and a Hella cute sub. 

She was mainly clothed as we made out. 
Very sensual. 
We made out, I could feel her wetness. 

She said to me. Your a tasty treat and had me on my back. She was very vocal. I felt comfortable. 

I still have a little insecurity on my üçÜ size but felt fine being naked and at this point it was hard and throbbing. I think she seen me trying to push it bigger, I just felt visually underwhelming when she was on top, holding my shaft. She was really comfortable but she knew. 

She went Honey, you dick is great size. It's really cute, nice skin and tone. I'm circumsized and my head is big but a little soft. She kept massaging it. She got me to stand. Up. Said some really positive body affirmations. I felt get and like putty. 

She had a hold of my shaft and was making eye contact. And kept grabbing my butt.

She lifted it up. 

And said. 

The only thing that's small is your cute little baby balls. Look at those tight little tests. They are so frickin cute. She was really firm on my body but was lightly touching them. 

My knees shaked so I lay back down. 

She keep saying some soft things. Talking about how my small balls had a cute jiggle. She did say I have not seen balls like yours it's hide away. 

She made me cum 3 times in a space of 5 mins. I had a submissive feminine moan. It might be that I am just getting comfortable cumming. 

She was so hot and went omg I didn't think you were a premature cummer. Coming with someone is new to me. I felt great. I did massage and go down so she was really happy. 

I didn't see her fully naked. 

She did Domme me.

1glm388,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueEnjenir/comments/1glm388/the_summary_of_rust_systems_programming_part_1/,The Summary of Rust Systems Programming Part 1,"Variable binding



The let keyword

let¬†introduces a variable binding:

let x; // declare ""x""

x = 42; // assign 42 to ""x""

This can also be written as a single line:

let x = 42; 



Type annotation

You can specify the variable's type explicitly with¬†:, that's a type annotation:

let x: i32; // \`i32\` is a signed 32-bit integer

x = 42;



// there's i8, i16, i32, i64, i128

//    also u8, u16, u32, u64, u128 for unsigned 



This can also be written as a single line:

let x: i32 = 42;



Uninitialized variables

If you declare a name and initialize it later, the compiler will prevent you from using it before it's initialized.

let x;

foobar(x); // error: borrow of possibly-uninitialized variable: \`x\`

x = 42; 



However, doing this is completely fine:

let x;

x = 42;

foobar(x); // the type of \`x\` will be inferred from here



Throwing values away

The underscore¬†\_¬†is a special name - or rather, a ""lack of name"". It basically means to throw away something:

// this does \*nothing\* because 42 is a constant

let \_ = 42;



// this calls \`get\_thing\` but throws away its result

let \_ = get\_thing(); 



Names that¬†start¬†with an underscore are regular names, it's just that the compiler won't warn about them being unused:

// we may use \`\_x\` eventually, but our code is a work-in-progress

// and we just wanted to get rid of a compiler warning for now.

let \_x = 42; 



Shadowing bindings

Separate bindings with the same name can be introduced - you can¬†shadow¬†a variable binding:

let x = 13;

let x = x + 3;

// using \`x\` after that line only refers to the second \`x\`,

//

// although the first \`x\` still exists (it'll be dropped

// when going out of scope), you can no longer refer to it. 



Tuples

Rust has tuples, which you can think of as ""fixed-length collections of values of different types"".

let pair = ('a', 17);

pair.0; // this is 'a'

pair.1; // this is 17 



If we really wanted to annotate the type of¬†pair, we would write:

let pair: (char, i32) = ('a', 17);



Destructuring tuples

Tuples can be¬†destructured¬†when doing an assignment, which means they're broken down into their individual fields:

let (some\_char, some\_int) = ('a', 17);

// now, \`some\_char\` is 'a', and \`some\_int\` is 17



This is especially useful when a function returns a tuple:

let (left, right) = slice.split\_at(middle);



Of course, when destructuring a tuple,¬†\_¬†can be used to throw away part of it:

let (\_, right) = slice.split\_at(middle);



Statements

The semi-colon marks the end of a statement:

let x = 3;

let y = 5;

let z = y + x;



Which means statements can span multiple lines:

let x = vec!\[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\]

.iter()

.map(|x| x + 3)

.fold(0, |x, y| x + y);

(We'll go over what those actually mean later).



Functions

fn¬†declares a function.

Here's a void function:

fn greet() {

println!(""Hi there!"");

}



And here's a function that returns a 32-bit signed integer. The arrow indicates its return type:

fn fair\_dice\_roll() -> i32 {

4

}



Blocks

A pair of brackets declares a block, which has its own scope:

// This prints ""in"", then ""out""

fn main() {

let x = ""out"";

{

// this is a different \`x\`

let x = ""in"";

println!(""{}"", x);

}

println!(""{}"", x);

} 



Blocks are expressions

Blocks are also expressions, which mean they evaluate to a value.

// this:

let x = 42;



// is equivalent to this:

let x = { 42 }; 



Inside a block, there can be multiple statements:

let x = {

let y = 1; // first statement

let z = 2; // second statement

y + z // this is the \*tail\* - what the whole block will evaluate to

};



Implicit return

And that's why ""omitting the semicolon at the end of a function"" is the same as returning, ie. these are equivalent:

fn fair\_dice\_roll() -> i32 {

return 4;

}



fn fair\_dice\_roll() -> i32 {

4

} 



Everything is an expression

if¬†conditionals are also expressions:

fn fair\_dice\_roll() -> i32 {

if feeling\_lucky {

6

} else {

4

}

}



A¬†match¬†is also an expression:

fn fair\_dice\_roll() -> i32 {

match feeling\_lucky {

true => 6,

false => 4,

}

} 



Field access and method calling

Dots are typically used to access fields of a value:

let a = (10, 20);

a.0; // this is 10



let amos = get\_some\_struct();

amos.nickname; // this is ""fasterthanlime"" 



Or call a method on a value:

let nick = ""fasterthanlime"";

nick.len(); // this is 14 



Modules, use syntax

The double-colon,¬†::, is similar but it operates on namespaces.

In this example,¬†std¬†is a¬†crate¬†(\~ a library),¬†cmp¬†is a¬†module¬†(\~ a source file), and¬†min¬†is a¬†function:

let least = std::cmp::min(3, 8); // this is 3 



use¬†directives can be used to ""bring in scope"" names from other namespace:

use std::cmp::min;



let least = min(7, 1); // this is 1 



Within¬†use¬†directives, curly brackets have another meaning: they're ""globs"". If we want to import both¬†min¬†and¬†max, we can do any of these:

// this works:

use std::cmp::min;

use std::cmp::max;



// this also works:

use std::cmp::{min, max};



// this also works!

use std::{cmp::min, cmp::max}; 



A wildcard (\*) lets you import every symbol from a namespace:

// this brings \`min\` and \`max\` in scope, and many other things

use std::cmp::\*; 



Types are namespace too

Types are namespaces too, and methods can be called as regular functions:

let x = ""amos"".len(); // this is 4

let x = str::len(""amos""); // this is also 4 



The libstd prelude

str¬†is a primitive type, but many non-primitive types are also in scope by default.

// \`Vec\` is a regular struct, not a primitive type

let v = Vec::new();



// this is exactly the same code, but with the \*full\* path to \`Vec\`

let v = std::vec::Vec::new(); 



This works because Rust inserts this at the beginning of every module:

use std::prelude::v1::\*; 

(Which in turns re-exports a lot of symbols, like¬†Vec,¬†String,¬†Option¬†and¬†Result).



Structs

Structs are declared with the¬†struct¬†keyword:

struct Vec2 {

x: f64, // 64-bit floating point, aka ""double precision""

y: f64,

}



They can be initialized using¬†struct literals:

let v1 = Vec2 { x: 1.0, y: 3.0 };

let v2 = Vec2 { y: 2.0, x: 4.0 };

// the order does not matter, only the names do



Struct update syntax

There is a shortcut for initializing the¬†rest of the fields¬†from another struct:

let v3 = Vec2 {

x: 14.0,

..v2

};



This is called ""struct update syntax"", can only happen in last position, and cannot be followed by a comma.

Note that¬†the rest of the fields¬†can mean¬†all the fields:

let v4 = Vec2 { ..v3 };



Destructuring structs

Structs, like tuples, can be destructured.

Just like this is a valid¬†let¬†pattern:

let (left, right) = slice.split\_at(middle); 



So is this:

let v = Vec2 { x: 3.0, y: 6.0 };

let Vec2 { x, y } = v;

// \`x\` is now 3.0, \`y\` is now \`6.0\`



And this:

let Vec2 { x, .. } = v;

// this throws away \`v.y\` 



Patterns and destructuring

Destructuring with if let

let¬†patterns can be used as conditions in¬†if:

struct Number {

odd: bool,

value: i32,

}



fn main() {

let one = Number { odd: true, value: 1 };

let two = Number { odd: false, value: 2 };

print\_number(one);

print\_number(two);

}



fn print\_number(n: Number) {

if let Number { odd: true, value } = n {

println!(""Odd number: {}"", value);

} else if let Number { odd: false, value } = n {

println!(""Even number: {}"", value);

}

}



// this prints:

// Odd number: 1

// Even number: 2



Match arms are patterns

match¬†arms are also patterns, just like¬†if let:

fn print\_number(n: Number) {

match n {

Number { odd: true, value } => println!(""Odd number: {}"", value),

Number { odd: false, value } => println!(""Even number: {}"", value),

}

}



// this prints the same as before



Exhaustive matches

A¬†match¬†has to be exhaustive: at least one arm needs to match.

fn print\_number(n: Number) {

match n {

Number { value: 1, .. } => println!(""One""),

Number { value: 2, .. } => println!(""Two""),

Number { value, .. } => println!(""{}"", value),

// if that last arm didn't exist, we would get a compile-time error

}

}



If that's hard,¬†\_¬†can be used as a ""catch-all"" pattern:

fn print\_number(n: Number) {

match n.value {

1 => println!(""One""),

2 => println!(""Two""),

\_ => println!(""{}"", n.value),

}

}



Methods

You can declare methods on your own types:

struct Number {

odd: bool,

value: i32,

}



impl Number {

fn is\_strictly\_positive(self) -> bool {

self.value > 0

}

}



And use them like usual:

fn main() {

let minus\_two = Number {

odd: false,

value: -2,

};

println!(""positive? {}"", minus\_two.is\_strictly\_positive());

// this prints ""positive? false""

}



Immutability

Variable bindings are immutable by default, which means their interior can't be mutated:

fn main() {

let n = Number {

odd: true,

value: 17,

};

n.odd = false; // error: cannot assign to \`n.odd\`,

// as \`n\` is not declared to be mutable

}



And also that they cannot be assigned to:

fn main() {

let n = Number {

odd: true,

value: 17,

};

n = Number {

odd: false,

value: 22,

}; // error: cannot assign twice to immutable variable \`n\`

} 



mut¬†makes a variable binding mutable:

fn main() {

let mut n = Number {

odd: true,

value: 17,

}

n.value = 19; // all good

} 



Traits

Traits are something multiple types can have in common:

trait Signed {

fn is\_strictly\_negative(self) -> bool;

} 



Orphan rules

You can implement:

one of your traits on anyone's type

anyone's trait on one of your types

but not a foreign trait on a foreign type

These are called the ""orphan rules"".

Here's an implementation of our trait on our type:

impl Signed for Number {

fn is\_strictly\_negative(self) -> bool {

self.value < 0

}

}



fn main() {

let n = Number { odd: false, value: -44 };

println!(""{}"", n.is\_strictly\_negative()); // prints ""true""

} 



Our trait on a foreign type (a primitive type, even):

impl Signed for i32 {

fn is\_strictly\_negative(self) -> bool {

self < 0

}

}



fn main() {

let n: i32 = -44;

println!(""{}"", n.is\_strictly\_negative()); // prints ""true""

}



A foreign trait on our type:

// the \`Neg\` trait is used to overload \`-\`, the

// unary minus operator.

impl std::ops::Neg for Number {

type Output = Number;



fn neg(self) -> Number {

Number {

value: -self.value,

odd: self.odd,

}        

}

}



fn main() {

let n = Number { odd: true, value: 987 };

let m = -n; // this is only possible because we implemented \`Neg\`

println!(""{}"", m.value); // prints ""-987""

}



The Self type

An¬†impl¬†block is always¬†for¬†a type, so, inside that block,¬†Self¬†means that type:

impl std::ops::Neg for Number {

type Output = Self;



fn neg(self) -> Self {

Self {

value: -self.value,

odd: self.odd,

}        

}

}



Marker traits

Some traits are¬†markers¬†- they don't say that a type implements some methods, they say that certain things can be done with a type.

For example,¬†i32¬†implements trait¬†Copy¬†(in short,¬†i32¬†is¬†Copy), so this works:

fn main() {

let a: i32 = 15;

let b = a; // \`a\` is copied

let c = a; // \`a\` is copied again

}



And this also works:

fn print\_i32(x: i32) {

println!(""x = {}"", x);

}



fn main() {

let a: i32 = 15;

print\_i32(a); // \`a\` is copied

print\_i32(a); // \`a\` is copied again

}



But the¬†Number¬†struct is not¬†Copy, so this doesn't work:

fn main() {

let n = Number { odd: true, value: 51 };

let m = n; // \`n\` is moved into \`m\`

let o = n; // error: use of moved value: \`n\`

} 



And neither does this:

fn print\_number(n: Number) {

println!(""{} number {}"", if n.odd { ""odd"" } else { ""even"" }, n.value);

}



fn main() {

let n = Number { odd: true, value: 51 };

print\_number(n); // \`n\` is moved

print\_number(n); // error: use of moved value: \`n\`

} 



But it works if¬†print\_number¬†takes an immutable reference instead:

fn print\_number(n: &Number) {

println!(""{} number {}"", if n.odd { ""odd"" } else { ""even"" }, n.value);

}



fn main() {

let n = Number { odd: true, value: 51 };

print\_number(&n); // \`n\` is borrowed for the time of the call

print\_number(&n); // \`n\` is borrowed again

} 



It also works if a function takes a¬†mutable¬†reference - but only if our variable binding is also¬†mut.

fn invert(n: &mut Number) {

n.value = -n.value;

}



fn print\_number(n: &Number) {

println!(""{} number {}"", if n.odd { ""odd"" } else { ""even"" }, n.value);

}



fn main() {

// this time, \`n\` is mutable

let mut n = Number { odd: true, value: 51 };

print\_number(&n);

invert(&mut n); // \`n is borrowed mutably - everything is explicit

print\_number(&n);

} 



Trait method receivers

Trait methods can also take¬†self¬†by reference or mutable reference:

impl std::clone::Clone for Number {

fn clone(&self) -> Self {

Self { ..\*self }

}

}



When invoking trait methods, the receiver is borrowed implicitly:

fn main() {

let n = Number { odd: true, value: 51 };

let mut m = n.clone();

m.value += 100;



print\_number(&n);

print\_number(&m);

} 



To highlight this: these are equivalent:

let m = n.clone();



let m = std::clone::Clone::clone(&n);



Marker traits like¬†Copy¬†have no methods:

// note: \`Copy\` requires that \`Clone\` is implemented too

impl std::clone::Clone for Number {

fn clone(&self) -> Self {

Self { ..\*self }

}

}



impl std::marker::Copy for Number {} 



Now,¬†Clone¬†can still be used:

fn main() {

let n = Number { odd: true, value: 51 };

let m = n.clone();

let o = n.clone();

} 



But¬†Number¬†values will no longer be moved:

fn main() {

let n = Number { odd: true, value: 51 };

let m = n; // \`m\` is a copy of \`n\`

let o = n; // same. \`n\` is neither moved nor borrowed.

} 



Deriving traits

Some traits are so common, they can be implemented automatically by using the¬†derive¬†attribute:

\#\[derive(Clone, Copy)\]

struct Number {

odd: bool,

value: i32,

}



// this expands to \`impl Clone for Number\` and \`impl Copy for Number\` blocks. 



Generics

Generic functions

Functions can be generic:

fn foobar<T>(arg: T) {

// do something with \`arg\`

} 



They can have multiple¬†type parameters, which can then be used in the function's declaration and its body, instead of concrete types:

fn foobar<L, R>(left: L, right: R) {

// do something with \`left\` and \`right\`

} 



Type parameter constraints (trait bounds)

Type parameters usually have¬†constraints, so you can actually do something with them.

The simplest constraints are just trait names:

fn print<T: Display>(value: T) {

println!(""value = {}"", value);

}



fn print<T: Debug>(value: T) {

println!(""value = {:?}"", value);

}



There's a longer syntax for type parameter constraints:

fn print<T>(value: T)

where

T: Display,

{

println!(""value = {}"", value);

} 



Constraints can be more complicated: they can require a type parameter to implement multiple traits:

use std::fmt::Debug;



fn compare<T>(left: T, right: T)

where

T: Debug + PartialEq,

{

println!(""{:?} {} {:?}"", left, if left == right { ""=="" } else { ""!="" }, right);

}



fn main() {

compare(""tea"", ""coffee"");

// prints: ""tea"" != ""coffee""

} 



Monomorphization

Generic functions can be thought of as namespaces, containing an infinity of functions with different concrete types.

Same as with crates, and modules, and types, generic functions can be ""explored"" (navigated?) using¬†::

fn main() {

use std::any::type\_name;

println!(""{}"", type\_name::<i32>()); // prints ""i32""

println!(""{}"", type\_name::<(f64, char)>()); // prints ""(f64, char)""

} 



This is lovingly called¬†turbofish syntax, because¬†::<>¬†looks like a fish.



Generic structs

Structs can be generic too:

struct Pair<T> {

a: T,

b: T,

}



fn print\_type\_name<T>(\_val: &T) {

println!(""{}"", std::any::type\_name::<T>());

}



fn main() {

let p1 = Pair { a: 3, b: 9 };

let p2 = Pair { a: true, b: false };

print\_type\_name(&p1); // prints ""Pair<i32>""

print\_type\_name(&p2); // prints ""Pair<bool>""

}



Example: Vec<T>

The standard library type¬†Vec¬†(\~ a heap-allocated array), is generic:

fn main() {

let mut v1 = Vec::new();

v1.push(1);

let mut v2 = Vec::new();

v2.push(false);

print\_type\_name(&v1); // prints ""Vec<i32>""

print\_type\_name(&v2); // prints ""Vec<bool>""

} 



Speaking of¬†Vec, it comes with a macro that gives more or less ""vec literals"":

fn main() {

let v1 = vec!\[1, 2, 3\];

let v2 = vec!\[true, false, true\];

print\_type\_name(&v1); // prints ""Vec<i32>""

print\_type\_name(&v2); // prints ""Vec<bool>""

}



Macros

All of¬†name!(),¬†name!\[\]¬†or¬†name!{}¬†invoke a macro. Macros just expand to regular code.

In fact,¬†println¬†is a macro:

fn main() {

println!(""{}"", ""Hello there!"");

} 



This expands to something that has the same effect as:

fn main() {

use std::io::{self, Write};

io::stdout().lock().write\_all(b""Hello there!\\n"").unwrap();

} 



The panic! macro

panic¬†is also a macro. It violently stops execution with an error message, and the file name / line number of the error, if enabled:

fn main() {

panic!(""This panics"");

}

// output: thread 'main' panicked at 'This panics', src/main.rs:3:5



Functions that panic

Some methods also panic. For example, the¬†Option¬†type can contain something, or it can contain nothing. If¬†.unwrap()¬†is called on it, and it contains nothing, it panics:

fn main() {

let o1: Option<i32> = Some(128);

o1.unwrap(); // this is fine



let o2: Option<i32> = None;

o2.unwrap(); // this panics!

}



// output: thread 'main' panicked at 'called \`Option::unwrap()\` on a \`None\` value', src/libcore/option.rs:378:21 ",1,1730969177.0,TrueEnjenir,0,1.0,False

I just wanted to share something that's helped my mental headspace in the past few months, and especially since the election, in the hopes that maybe it might work for others.

A few months ago, I was reading an article on the NY Times about some political thing that was making me furious, and at the end of it, I was served a link to another semi-related article that also made me angry, and then a third link sent my rage over the top. 

And then something burst, and I decided I didn't want to participate in this stupidity anymore. It's like we've all voluntarily agreed to exist in a world where the best way to generate ad revenue is to keep us clicking through article after article that assures us time and again that our worst fears are very real, and the world is about to end. Doesn't matter who you are, what your politics are - everyone is getting their own personalized version of endless rage, sadness, and terror.

Fuck that. 

Except, I still want to stay up to date on the news. 

So I had a crazy idea and subscribed to the print edition of my local paper, the LA Times ($28/month), and resolved to put aside all online news. 

It has changed everything for me. The print version is like night and day with trying to follow any kind of news app or aggregator. Instead of being force-fed what your dopamine addiction wants, it instead gives you...a lot of average or boring news. Which actually makes you realize how much larger the world is than just the most controversial issues of the moment. Yes, they're there, and they're likely page 1 - but when you finish reading it, you're not served 20 links that will double and triple down on that. 

And the craziest thing is how the damn paper is out there, every morning, before 7am. I can't get over that even now, with the death of the news industry, how it's there like clockwork. It's something I now actually look forward to, and I figure - hey, whatever happens today, if it's THAT important, someone will tell me about it; otherwise, better to wait 24 hours for someone to get the facts in order.

I feel like an old man, going out to get my paper each day, and then reading it with my coffee. But it is SUCH a pleasure. I tried to do the same with the e-version, but I found myself just clicking the links that appealed to me. With the paper, it's more like a curriculum - you flip to A5, and some article on the endangered something or other covers half a page, and you're like - dammit! someone felt it important to give this square area of newsprint to the endangered something or other, I better see what the deal is!  

And best of all - the paper doesn't know what you're reading! 

Above all: I feel sane. 

I dove back into online news on election night, and after weeks on my diet, I felt INSTANTLY terrible. Separate from the actual news (which is awful), it felt like I was clicking my way into a spiral of misery. 

I'm not saying the world right now is good. But the online algorithm is built to magnify the actual truth of the situation by a thousand-fold.

To William Ernest Lex Jacobi. My Brother.

If you're reading this, I am in prison. An anonymous contact has sent you this letter and a lead-encased box. Here, they don't call me by name. My prisoner number is 181938. Sometimes, I wonder who allowed me to be alive today. Was it the judge, the law, the jury of my peers, destiny, God... or him?

We used to rule Manhattan, my brother. Our inherited wealth was enough to expand the empire that Father built. At first, I felt it was a shame that you chose science over our father's vision. But now, I am proud of you for getting that scholarship to a prestigious university. Since the day He took to the skies like a lightning bolt, our criminal empire has fallen. Gangs no longer run the streets and the Manhattan underworld is unrecognizable.

But my brother, this letter isn't about me brooding what I've lost. What if I told you that I made a god bleed?

You're not better than I am, brother. So, don't make sanctimonious statements against me after you read this. I have seen your work on those dishonest debtors. How you had this obsession of creating a perfect man or perhaps... you are trying to become one.

The bodies, the blood, the brains in the basement. Father was more merciful to them than you were.

I can almost see the look on your face, the flush of envy spreading as you read these words. Now everyone knows the perfect man exists‚Äîand it isn‚Äôt you. You, pale with that furious little tic in your jaw. Go on, let the hatred simmer, the anger gnaw at you. Maybe it‚Äôll even give you the strength I didn‚Äôt have.

You might be wondering how I managed to get involved in a scuffle with a god. So let me take you back to a few months ago when our empire... scratch that. MY EMPIRE was at its peak. Father was long dead, rest his soul. The outer circle of our vast criminal network only knows me as Baal. I fashioned myself after the Canaanite god, exuding a sense of power and a little bit of flamboyance. Because who could judge us? Who could stop us?

There was this journalist... I couldn't remember her name. Was it Laurie? Lana? Lois? Such things slipped my mind, but it started with an L.¬†

So let's say, Miss L.¬†

She was incessant and annoying. The police on my payroll tried to pay her off to look the other way. But she refused. She went around digging where she shouldn't be. She wanted to be a ""hero"" who would expose Manhattan for the crime-ridden city it is. She knows this ""clean"" city is putting up a fa√ßade.

So I planned to kidnap her. She was attending a gala hosted by her workplace. For a woman as beautiful and feisty as Miss L, she was quite the loner. So, I had my men approach her and invite her to the car. We pulled out our knives in a subtle manner for extra persuasion. A nerdy, milquetoast man came close to spotting us. He said we were making the woman uncomfortable. I put my arm over his shoulder and told him I would buy him coffee for a talk. He took the bait, and my men took Miss L for a ride. It was a short talk for that nerd. He refused my fifty-grand offer to avoid trouble, but Miss L had already left him.

I took another car and went back home. Miss L had been waiting for me... in the basement, tied up and surrounded by my men like a feast of pigs. I gave her one last offer, but she spat in my face and refused.

So, I wanted to make an example of her. You were not around then, my brother. So, forgive me for rummaging through your laboratory. One of the oddities I found was a green scalpel. I could've picked a jackknife or any ordinary blade. But, I picked your favorite scalpel. I saw you cut through bones with it.¬†

Perfect!

As I was about to carve the fucking reporter like a pumpkin, he came.

He stood above me at the top of the stairs, Vasiliy‚Äôs limp body dangling from his grip. Vasiliy, a six-foot mountain man of fat and muscle, hung like a ragdoll, utterly helpless in the hands of this √úbermensch.

My men didn‚Äôt hesitate; they raised their rifles and aimed their pistols. First, there was a click. Then, there was gunfire. But he just stood there as the bullets bounced off him like harmless raindrops. Then this demon, draped in shadow, laughed. He laughed, my brother, mocking me and my men.

Then his eyes flared. A deep crimson glow, like something straight from hell.

Our guns melted like slag, and we had to throw them away lest we burn our palms. The hiss and smell of burning metal filled the air as I stumbled back, bolting toward your laboratory.

I slammed the steel doors shut and ducked behind rows of your ‚ÄúPerfect Man‚Äù experiments‚Äîstill, silent corpses on gurneys, their faces half-done, some mouths stitched shut. The air reeked of formaldehyde and something else, something rotten. You were never merciful, brother; I see that now, surrounded by the remnants of your ‚Äúwork.‚Äù I heard muffled screams through the door as he made his way with my men.

For a heartbeat, silence.¬†

Metal screeched as he tore through five hundred pounds of bulletproof steel. The door buckled like cardboard, and there he was. His demon eyes pierced through me, burning red-hot. He wasn‚Äôt here to speak; he was here to end me.

""Weapons, yes,"" I thought to myself.

My hand shot out, finding a lever on the wall, hoping for a weapon, anything. I yanked it down and the lights cut out. The room was black, except for those relentless, crimson eyes.

A surge of electricity flowed through the morgue. Then, there were sounds of stone scraping against flesh.

I awakened your ""Perfect Men.""

I heard the groans and mumbles of men supposed to be dead. Only the faint shuffle of feet and low, guttural groans grew louder as they closed in. The √úbermensch was silent and still, a predator waiting. His glowing eyes were the only pinpoints of light.

A Perfect Man lunged, fists swinging with bone-crushing force. The room swallowed them back into shadow, leaving only the shuffle of fighting and the sound of ragged breathing until‚Äîflash!

A flare of light ripped through the dark, illuminating the chaos for a split second, as the √úbermensch's eyes ignited, sending a scarlet beam of death through the air. The Perfect Men writhed and twisted, some of them catching fire as they advanced. One lunged through the searing heat, landing a powerful blow to the √úbermensch's jaw. The sound of impact reverberated through the room. For the first time, the √úbermensch staggered, stunned but not in pain.

Another Perfect Man tackled him like a freight train. They crashed to the concrete floor and rolled in the dark. I saw the undead clawing at the √úbermensch's throat. Their hands, straining with monstrous strength, tried to choke him.

Flash! His eyes blazed again, shooting searing red fire across the room. The Perfect Man *(choking the √úbermensch)* stumbled back, smoke rising from his face. Yet, he lunged forward, refusing to relent. Two others joined, attacking in tandem. The √úbermensch swung his arm like they were made of steel. It cracked their undead ribs and flung one into the wall. But the others surged on, clawing and punching, using their bodies as weapons. The darkness swallowed them whole again, leaving only grunts and the clash of fists.

The caped demon snarled, grabbing the attacker by the head and twisting sharply. But as that Perfect Man fell, another one grabbed the √úbermensch's arm, twisting it backward. Another slammed into his ribs with enough force to crack stone. They fought like cornered beasts. Relentless and mindless, they were driven only by whatever spark of life animated them. The √úbermensch's red eyes glowed even brighter, and he let out a laugh‚Äîa cruel, taunting laugh‚Äîas he wrenched free, flinging two of them across the room in one motion.

The entire room is on fire now. The blaze should be enough to consume the √úbermensch and the monsters you created, brother. I climbed up a ladder and escaped into the garden. But he was there, waiting for me.

His hands held the twisted, lifeless bodies of the Perfect Men. He scattered them across the floor like broken dolls.

""Where do you think you can go that I cannot follow you?"" said the √úbermensch.

I was desperate, my brother.

What was the point of going up against someone you knew you could never escape, who could take you apart with just a thought?

This was the moment I fought a god.

Ever since I was a child, I saw that the world was ugly. So I hurt it. I hurt it again, and again, and again. They begged, they screamed, they bled, they died. But this was different, he was not concerned about what I was going to do. And I understand that. I know it was useless. I know I was a dead man.

So I pulled out your green scalpel and I stabbed him in the eye. The blade pierced through with a sickening pop. The god screamed in pain. His voice tore through the air, a guttural, raw sound that almost destroyed my ears.

His hand shot up, gripping the scalpel, his fingers closing over it like a vise. With a twist, he crushed it into splinters, fragments of green metal scattering to the floor. I didn‚Äôt wait to see the rage in his one good eye‚ÄîI spun around, legs pounding as I bolted for the back gate, heart hammering, his furious roars chasing me into the darkness.

I flung the gate open, breathless, only to freeze. He was already there, a shadow stretching across the ground in the faint light, blocking my escape.

He cocked his head, one hand resting loosely at his side, the other dripping blood from where the scalpel had bitten. His voice sliced through the silence, low and icy.

‚ÄúTell me‚Äîwhere haven‚Äôt I already followed you?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt blink, his good eye fixed on me, gleaming with cold amusement, as if this was all just a game he was tired of winning.

""You‚Äôre already at my feet, defeated. You‚Äôve surrendered,"" said the *superhuman*, each word precise as if the outcome had been decided long ago. ""You are already sitting in a jail cell. It‚Äôs over.""

There was no choice. I knelt, not because I wanted mercy, but because I knew‚Äîhe had no mercy left to give. I waited for him to end it. But this god showed mercy after all.¬†

And so here I am, locked in this prison, watching as my empire burns to ashes outside these walls. I spent the next six months watching my gangs fall one by one to this superior man. While another three were spent communicating with my remaining contacts gathering shards of your broken scalpel and collecting what remains of your laboratory. They encased your equipment in a box of lead when they found out some of them were radioactive, especially your scalpel.

I hope you found this letter useful, brother.

Signed,¬†

So, there's this person. We've known each other ever since I first sat in a school chair. When other kids ran away from me happyly screaming ""plague"", she stuck with me and we chased them together. They were the only person who actually wanted to hang out with me. We swore to be best friends forever.
Until 6'th grade came around. At age 11, I was rejected by my only friend because ""Disney is for babies"" and anyone associating with me would be emiedetly thrown in the same ""gross, weird, teacher's pet ""childish"" castout) box as me.
Our friendship was donzo
(She still showed up for candy after rejecting my trick or treat invite on Halloween tho lol)

Fast forward to the end of my first year of highschool.      I'm after my first breakup (a really ducked up one at that) and fresh out of the closet as a pan enby.
It's Saturday, I'm eating breakfast with my mom and my uncle bursts through the door saying we got mail. I continue without batting an eye until he says I've got something too.
He gives me a taped peace of paper with only my full name written on it.

I open it up and...

It's a heartfelt apology letter.   From her.

(You can probably tell where this is going by now)

A few moments past by and now we're texting eachother. She changed so much, but at the same time she stayed exactly the same. (She was apologizing to me every so often while I told her I forgave her and that they're great, time and time again)
A couple of days later I realized I might have caught feelings for her, so after veryfying she's not only into guys, I invited her to a date by giving her a heart shaped letter and quickly dashing off.  

The next day I received a letter confirming the date and asking for a specific time, dried rose petals and caramels attached.

The date itself was awkward. We watched Coraline while sharing Pocky and my dumb 15 year old ass asked if we could kiss at the end. (Which was even more awkward because it was my first kiss and I just froze while she kissed meüò¨ (my first relationship was so weird we didn't even kiss so I had zero experience lol))

After that we met here and there while our convos got more and more scarce cuz I do that thing where I'm afraid to text someone frequently because I don't want to come off as annoying and scare the person off. (Also there was this thing where I realized that she disappeared from my chat list so I added her back and she was 'shocked' about it)
 The next few months were silent with like a one meet up offer that never came to be until her 17'th birthday came around and I was like ""hey, I can take her to that nice cafe my mom showed me as a b-day gift"", so I texted her about it and she agreed, saying she'll be free in two months. But something felt... Different...
Suddenly she was calling my sunshine and gushing about how sweet and cute I am while using this emoji ü•∞ CONSTANTLY.
So I happyly waited.

A few days before her birthday I asked if our meeting is still a thing and got no response.
The day before our meet up time a sent her a random meme and got no response.

She set me up.

After that I basically accepted it as the second betrayal and it was really hard to not do something awful because of both rage and sadness. (I thought of doing an animatic of 'House of memories' and posting it online on multiple occasions or writing her a rage paragraph calling her out but I thankfully resisted)

A few months later I discovered she moved to the other side of the city by complete chance thanks to my mom encountering her grandma while she was heading home from work.

I tried moving on. I talked to my therapist about it and she said that I should write her a goodbye letter and throw it in a fireplace, so I did.
On a winter night I wrote a letter, thrown it in a bowl, attached a fresh rose and watched it burn on my outer windowsill.

It didn't work.


My emotions calmed down but she was still on my mind.

So I tried ignoring it.

I got into relationships with other people but she was still in the back of my head.
I had a ""what if"" dream about them at least 2 times a month.
Her kiss was the only one that actually felt GOOD.
 Not a single person managed to level up with the level of love I felt for her.
I also picked up on my brain subconsciously picking people similar to her, which hurt me.


In May this year, I realized that perhaps it was my time to apologize.
Looking back I was WAY too flirty and quick with our relationship, but every single time I asked her if she was okay with it she agreed (which happened pretty often) so my thoughts we're really mixed.

Which didn't stop me though...

On May 31 I sent her a photo of a hand written apology letter. (I didn't know her new address so I had no choice really)

Their response was what I expected. She assured me that it wasn't my fault cuz she was the one that ghosted me instead of saying she's busy.
To which I replied with with a gif of a mixed expression. She replied to it saying that I shouldn't be sad.
I simply said ""I'm not sad, I just simply don't trust you anymore""

They replied with  ""I don't blame you""

The conversation ended at that.
But there was one problem.
One of the messages she sent was a voice message. Which after hearing her voice again... I felt how the feelings that I thought we're half gone came back like a whip.
I tried ignoring those feelings again.

A few weeks later I asked her what she thought of me, hoping that she would reply with something like ""acuatiance"" and I would finally escape from this hell.
She replied with pal.

Three days ago, due to the situation in the US, I realized that these might be the last moments of my life, so I decided I would end this once and for all so that, if I pass away, I pass away without any romantic feelings for her.
I tell her exactly how I feel, face to face. No sugar coating, no lies. It might end with us both feeling extremely bitter, but it will be the truth.

So two days ago, I sent her her a simple text.
""I want to meet with you""

They're back to the ü•∞ emojis and the sweetsy talk, and, thanks to my uncontrollable people pleasing tendencies, I have gotten myself into a coffee date with a possibility of shopping afterward.

I am freaking out. I don't know if I should still tell her the truth because she seems super excited for the date and I don't wanna ruin her day.
I'm really torn. On one hand I really think they might be the one, and on the other I don't want anything to do with her anymore. I can't back out now and I've got 8 hours to think of a planT^T Pls help",2,1730967718.0,actuallesbians,1,1.0,False
