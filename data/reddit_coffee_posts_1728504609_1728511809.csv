We agreed last night to meet up between 10-11am. At around 9:30am, I get a message from the person saying that they just woke up; good, me too. I messaged back saying “let’s meet up at 11-11:30am, just to be safe”; they agreed that sounded good. I proceeded to take a little longer in the shower than intended, and I generally run late (a curse I’m trying to break, but it’s challenging); I got out of the shower at about 11:15, intending to leave right after getting dressed, the place we were meeting at being only about a 10 minute walk from my place. Then I looked at my phone and saw a message from them saying they were already at the place we were going to meet at, and it was from 10:52am. I tried to message them back immediately when I saw it, saying I was on my way and to apologize for running on the late side, but my messages wouldn’t send. They had deleted their profile on the app we had been communicating on, and I hadn’t asked for their number yet. I had no way to contact them. So I went to the place we intended to meet up at, and they weren’t there, as I suspected they wouldn’t be. I feel like a giant a**hole now, and they likely think I stood them up on purpose. So, AITA for running late, or are they for being early and not waiting around to hear from me before deleting the only means by which I had to contact them?

Once upon a time in the bustling town of Rivertown, there lived a woman named Clara. Clara was known for her kind heart, infectious laughter, and her love of good food. Standing at 5'5"", she weighed 120 kg and had always struggled with her weight. Though she was confident in herself, Clara yearned to be healthier, more energetic, and to live life to the fullest.

One day, while scrolling through her phone, Clara stumbled upon an ad for Java Burn, a supplement that promised to boost metabolism and help with weight loss when taken with coffee. Skeptical at first, Clara spent days researching and reading reviews. She found countless stories of people who had transformed their lives with it. Inspired, she decided to give it a try.

[""Clara's Transformation: A Journey to Health and Happiness with the Secret of Java Burn""](https://wrightlossspace.quora.com/Claras-Transformation-A-Journey-to-Health-and-Happiness-with-the-Secret-of-Java-Burn)

Clara made a promise to herself to commit for at least three months. Every morning, she would mix Java Burn into her coffee and start her day with a short walk around her neighborhood. At first, she didn’t notice much of a change, but after the second week, she began to feel more energized. The morning walks turned into evening jogs, and she even joined a local Zumba class with her friends.

As the weeks passed, her clothes started fitting looser, and the scale began to show results. Her energy levels soared, and she felt more vibrant than she had in years. After three months of consistency, Clara stepped on the scale and couldn’t believe her eyes. She now weighed 76 kg, having lost a remarkable 44 kg.

But it wasn’t just the weight that had changed—Clara’s entire outlook on life had transformed. She felt stronger, more confident, and filled with a newfound sense of accomplishment. Her friends and family marveled at her determination, and Clara became an inspiration to many in Rivertown.

In the end, it wasn’t just Java Burn that helped Clara on her journey; it was her dedication, her commitment to a healthier lifestyle, and the realization that she was capable of so much more than she had ever imagined. Clara’s story spread throughout the town, reminding everyone that change is possible, as long as you believe in yourself and take that first step forward.",1,1728510631.0,loseweight00,0,1.0,False

It was a massive study of over 30,000 participants in 32 countries. It demonstrated that people who drank 1 serving of soda per day, no matter what kind of sweetener, from high fructose corn syrup to stevia (and caffeine for good measure), increase their risk of stroke by 22%. 2 per day, 37%. More, up to 264%. Fruit juices, fruit-based drinks, as well as excessive amounts of tea and coffee, all raised the likelihood by a significant degree. The only thing that didn’t was water, and the amount necessary to lower your risk of stroke depended on the area of the world you lived in due to fluctuating factors such as temperature, humidity, and cultural practices that have been mitigated by advantageous genetic mutations. This was true for tea, as well. And now we find that all sweeteners, natural and artificial, cause imbalances in gut bacteria and overall digestive health. I can’t drink plain water. I hate it.

The shots I am pulling have been relatively watery with little crema. Basically, it would take about 7 seconds for it to start pouring and only 15-16 seconds to complete the pour, yielding around 55g.

Currently the grind size is set to 8 and I’m using the single wall double filter basket. In terms of dose, I found that the default 13 seconds grind time for a double delivers way too much coffee, almost like a mountain. It’s impossible for me to tamp the 13 seconds grind because it’s just too much. But if I do manual dosing to perfectly match the top edge of cap on the tamper to the top of filter basket (after tamping, of course), the tamped coffee grinds would measure only around 14g. Moreover, the shots would only take 6-7 seconds to start pouring, 15-16 seconds to finish pouring, with the pour coming out inconsistently with little crema. 

Has anyone experienced similar issue before? Do you also find 13 seconds way too long with Breville Pro or similar machine? Could it be the coffee bean I’m using?

I'm trying to get some feedback from the Reddit community to see if this product makes sense to launch.

I'm a former FP&A consultant turned tech entrepreneur now on my second start-up. I sense (through prior experience) there is a big gap in the market for a simple-to-use online platform that can help first-time entrepreneurs model their business economics before they launch to determine viability. It seems so obvious but haven't really found a good solution (most people still use Excel, which takes a long time).

I want to build a tool that basically gives anyone with the ability to build a full financial model of their idea and assess economics and cash needs. in minutes I.e. if i start a coffee shop, I want to add one or more product line and charge $5 for a coffee, these are my costs, this is how many employees I want to have, this is how much rent I want to pay, etc...

Ultimately the goal is to have someone be able to budget and generate three financial statements + cash flow / investor returns + valuation super quickly.

For some context: I've built probably dozens of custom FP&A financial models for everyone from start-ups to large F500 organizations and with a little bit of work I think you could build a really cool product using some of the things I've built in the past. The goal is to save a ton of time for people and get a much more better handle on projected cash flow and what your business could be worth.

Longer-term if this is successful I'm thinking of integrating this with QuickBooks to make it easy for folks to budget.

I'm trying to gauge market interest and see and have created an Invite List to assess whether this is worth building with my team of developers. See here: [https://qlrhcyop.forms.app/join-our-waitlist](https://qlrhcyop.forms.app/join-our-waitlist)

1g02olf,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_mclarke77/comments/1g02olf/the_obsidian_staircase/,The Obsidian Staircase,"I was fetching myself a glass of water in the middle of the night when whatever had eviscerated my roommate attacked me. It chased me through the flat. Fear, like liquid fire, coursed through my veins. It was gibbering. Shrieking. I’d been so desperate to escape I’d leapt through my living room window. Luckily, in the aftermath I was found by a neighbor and soon ended up in the hospital. 

 

When I’d first returned to my senses all I could see were those dark claws slashing. That wriggling, monstrous torso. That human face. An insectoid body. Human limbs and arthropod claws fused together into some horrendous amalgam. 

 

I felt nausea boil in my stomach. 

 

I thrashed and yelled. 

 

I was blind to the doctors and nurses around me. They held me down and sedated me. When I woke up again I was calmer. A doctor was by my bedside and pulled up a chair next to me. He looked like he was in his fifties and his hair was black and speckled with grey. “Good afternoon, Mr. Anthony Wyndthorn. My name is Dr. Joshua Stern.” He paused. He seemed to be in the middle of picking the correct words. “Well, there’s no easy way to say this so I’ll just say it. Sometime last night you and your roommate” he glanced down at his clipboard, “Benjamin Harper were attacked by some kind of wild animal. What species is, of course, not yet known. Unfortunately, Ben did not survive. At least that’s what I heard from the cops before they left. You were unconscious until earlier this afternoon. You were very lucky you didn’t break any bones. We gave you the standard shots and course of antibiotics. Your wounds have been washed and stitched. We’re going to keep you overnight just to make sure everything’s in order.” He then suddenly added, “You understand?” Then he eyed me for a long moment. “How’re you feeling?” I stared back at him hotly. My gaze betraying my annoyance. “Well I feel just fucking great, don’t I? Don’t I look great? What do you think?” My voice was croaky but it echoed through the room. Dr Stern looked back at me. “No need to be snippy. I just want to gauge the extent of your injuries. You’ve suffered a major trauma. Not just physically, but mentally.” His gaze softened. Suddenly I broke eye contact with him. The memory of seeing Ben’s corpse flashed through my brain. 

 

The blood. The viscera. 

 

I couldn’t even tell what parts of him were left over. He’d been skinned. And eaten mostly to the bone. Then that thing. It had come out of the shadows of his room. Leapt at me. My breathing quickened. I felt my limbs shake from terror. I winced in pain. I was covered in bruises and scratches and moving, even slightly, caused me great discomfort. Dr Stern continued to eye me. “We have therapists you could chat with before you leave. I’d highly recommend it actually. It will help you to heal faster psychologically.” I looked back up at him. My annoyance gone. All I could feel was terror and sadness. Ben had not been my favorite person but he’d not deserved to die like that.  “Maybe I will. But not right now. I think I should just rest. Could you give me something to help me sleep?” Dr Stern agreed and left me the details of a local therapist he recommended. Before he left my room he turned to tell me, “and the cops want to interview you tomorrow morning. Just so you now. It’s just to get your side of things.” Then he smiled. I couldn’t help but smile back, his was so genuine. “Okay, well I’m off home to the missus. Take that pill there if you need help sleeping. Hope you feel better.” Then he was gone. 

 

I was alone in my room for the first time since I had awoken. My brain was still groggy from all the sedatives and I finally got a good look at my room. It was relatively nice for what must have been a public hospital. I had an ensuite bathroom but the room was small and the door to my room was within arms-reach of my bed. I turned my head and tried to sit up slightly. I yelled in pain as my stitches pulled in my side. “Ahhgh” I grunted.  I then realized they’d tied some kind of gauze and brace around my stomach. I guess it was meant to hold me together or stop me from messing with my stiches? I rolled onto my side with great effort and with many more grunts of pain managed to get to my feet. I hobbled over to the bathroom and peed. I tried for a number two but it was a no go. Too painful. Oh well. I limped slowly back to my bed and slumped back down. I felt like I’d been sliced all over my stomach and chest. As I lay in bed I realized that’s probably exactly what happened. I drank a bunch of water and nibbled on some cheese biscuits they’d left me for my tea. Then I took my blue sleeping pill and got myself as comfy as one could get in those scratchy hospital linens. As I lay in the dark of my room I felt an anxious sweat bead my forehead as I played the events of the last twenty-four hours over and over in my brain.

 

I had awoken in the early hours of that fateful morning. It had been a Sunday. I felt that horrendous sticky heat one gets from drinking way too much alcohol. I had hot coals in my throat from all the shots and cigarettes I’d chocked down the previous night. Ben and I had gone out with some friends. It had been pretty wild. 

 

I don’t remember how I got home. All I remember is waking up with an unendurable thirst. With eyes half-open, I groped and shambled my way through our dark flat to the kitchen. I noticed something was wrong when my barefoot stepped on something cold and slimy. I heard a loud squelch. “What the hell is that?” I mumbled. I groped for the lights but couldn’t find them. I was still too asleep and half-drunk, so I did not understand what was happening. I pulled out my phone and turned on the flashlight. There on the floor, just beneath the fridge, was some kind of goo. It was translucent but had a slight blue tint. It smelled sweet like honey but not quite.  My forehead was a knot of confusion. Then I noticed the fridge was slightly ajar. It was an old fridge, one of those models with rounded edges from the 1950s that just never stops running. It was dark blue with a silver outline. I saw traces of the same goo on the sides of the fridge door as I pulled it open. 

 

When I saw what was on the other side I simply gaped. 

 

My mouth hung open in disbelief. 

 

My eyes stared unblinking. Within the fridge. Well, there was no fridge. The inside of the fridge was completely gone. No light. No  half rotten veggies. No left-over Chinese food. No. In place of all these things was a worn stone staircase. Cut from a shiny, black stone; I believe it resembled obsidian. The maw of the doorway yawned as cold as the arctic. I felt an icy wind blow softly from within the doorway. Small icicles had formed on the circular roof which sat above the darkened staircase. I gaped still and slowly studied the impossible staircase. The light of my phone cast long shadows. The stairs were coated with a thin film of that same slime and seemed to go on forever down and deeper until darkness swallowed them up below. “No fucking way. Nope. Not today.” I said stupidly and slammed the fridge door shut. 

 

My heart was beating hard. I felt confused and sick. I spun around when suddenly I heard something scuttle in the corridor. I then noticed, using my phone’s flashlight, that a line of that goo ran from the fridge all the way through the kitchen into  Ben’s room. I saw through the kitchen doorway that his bedroom door was open. 

 

I should have just run at that moment. I should have run and never looked back. 

 

But I looked through the doorway. Transfixed, I stumbled forward. In the blue glow of the moon I saw Ben lying on his bed, spread-eagle. But when I looked closer I saw that it was not him. It was what was left of him. And I saw the thing that did it come scuttling out of the dark. I heard a horrible clicking noise. A click-click-click of giant pincers. I heard a loud trilling sound. Then I saw the thing come out of the dark. It was humanoid but only slightly and I only say this because it’s the one word I can think of. Imagine a person except every limb is twisted the wrong way so that this thing was forced to run on all fours, with limbs bent all backwards. It had two heads. One faced me and it was a human mask stretched across something else; the mask was all out of shape. The other face was at the end of a hideously long neck that was held in the dark. Its body was a wriggling mass of human flesh and some kind of carapace, like that of a crab or arachnid. It had ten segmented limbs that ended in large claws. Those claws lashed out at me. What felt like hot blades sliced through my chest and stomach. I screamed in pain, nearly fell over. I just managed to back away. The creature stepped back too. I felt something sticky cover my wounds. It was that slime. I looked up again. That whole creeping creature was covered in blue slime. I felt bile rise in my throat as I sprinted away screaming a primal scream of pain and terror. It didn’t sound human. 

 

The thing chased me. It came scuttling on its arthropod legs, slashing at me; clipping my ankles once or twice. My panting and its trilling filled the darkened flat. I wondered if perhaps a neighbor had heard the noise? Could the police be coming? 

 

The way the thing moved toward me reminded of a giant spider. As I entered the living room I realized there was no way I was going to have time to unlock and leave my flat through the front door. 

 

I knew I didn’t have time to reach my phone and call someone. And then *wait* for them. 

 

I needed to get out now. Right now! 

 

 

 

 

In desperation I picked up the nearest chair and hurled it at the large window. The chair smashed clean through with a loud crash. I prayed the fall wouldn’t be too bad and leapt right through. I didn’t remember anything else until I woke up here. 

 

I kept my eyes closed as I lay in the hospital bed. My heart was hammering in my chest as I remembered how that thing had nearly got me. Where had it come from? Were there more staircases like that nearby? I shivered at the thought. By around nine o’clock that evening the nurses made one last visit to collect the left-over food I had for tea. They gave me my evening medication and then left.

 

I went over those memories again and again. I was deciding what I would tell the cops and what I would omit. I would stick with the wild animal story. I mean, how a wild animal could just appear in a flat in the middle of a city, kill one person and maim another, then just disappear completely? It’s crazy to me. But I’m also not interested in sounding like a crazy person to the cops. If I told anyone about the fridge. About the creature. It’s true nature. Well, I would end up in some terrible mental institution. So, I’ll just stick with whatever crazy story they have. Agreeing with their madness is better than drawing attention because of my own. 

 

As all this raced through my head I felt a warmness start to spread through my body. I realized the sleeping pill must be working. My thoughts slowed. My breathing calmed. Soon I was fast asleep.

 

My ears heard a clicking noise as I awoke. My door stood open. I yelled as my eyes opened and I saw that creature standing down at the end of the hallway. It stood still for a moment. It trilled. I yelled, “Help! Help! Nurse! Anyone?” The hallway remained dark and silent. No one answered me. Were they dead? What had happened? I tried to sit up but my wounds screamed at me to stop moving. Then the thing started walking towards me. It scuttled so like an insect it sent shivers rippling down my spine. My lungs burned with fear. I tried desperately to get up. But I could barely move. The pain was excruciating. I yelled as I pulled myself to a sitting position. But it was too late. As I turned to see where the thing was I bellowed. It was hovering right over my bed. It’s horrifying masked face staring down at me. Its eyes were wrinkled and hidden behind disfigured flesh. It pressed a large claw against my cheek. Then it stood back and used another claw to grab my left ankle. I felt all the bones therein snap. The pain I felt cannot be fully described. It was like someone had spilled liquid fire on my leg. I screamed brutally; with full force.

 

I think I may have blacked out because the next thing I remember I was on the cold floor. I blinked and moaned. I was being dragged along by that thing. My ankle screamed with pain and white-hot pangs leapt up my leg. I used all my strength to lift my head and look where I was going. The thing was dragging me through the hall. A fluorescent light started to flicker as we approached a door. The thing winced at the sudden light and reached up and smashed it so that the flickering ceased immediately. It lurched forward and pushed the door open. Inside was a small communal space. It must be where the hospital staff come to take breaks and make coffee. Of all the pieces of furniture within this room the one the monster cared about most was the door of a large pantry. 

 

A chill spread through me. 

 

Another doorway? It wanted to take me? As the terrifying thought ripped through me I twisted my ankle but to no avail. The thing moved slowly but pulled me inexorably toward that wooden door. It stretched a segmented appendage forward and knocked three times on the pantry door. There was a pause. Something seemed to rippled through the wooden surface of the door. Even in the dim light of the hospital I could see it. All I could hear was my heavy breathing and the soft clicks of the monster. Then it pulled the pantry door open slowly. I knew the chances there would be no staircase was zero, but I still hoped it would be filled with normal food like a normal pantry. But of course there was the black staircase, gaping up at us. I moaned in horror and tried to kick at the thing. Again it was useless. Then the thing bent forward and suddenly I felt its grip on my leg loosen. Then my leg fell and hit the floor. I was momentarily stunned. It was too. 

 

As it realized it had lost my leg it turned to grab me again. I mustered all my strength and kicked the thing as hard as I could. It screamed as it tumbled forward, already bent out of balance. I heard it continue to click, shriek and trill menacingly as it fell down those stairs.  As the sound of it faded from my ears I lay still. My body felt cold. Could I have lost too much blood? Was I going to die? My entire left leg was now numb. I slowly shambled onto my right leg. I shut the pantry door. Then out a strange instinct I knocked on it three times. As I did I forced my eyes closed and willed the doorway locked. The stairway gone. Then I opened the panty door again. I yelled with delight when I saw that there was very normal almost out of date food in that pantry. I was really overjoyed. 

 

The cops have a new ridiculous theory. They now believe a madman was responsible for my initial assault and the brutal murder of Ben. That he had followed me to the hospital to finish me off and was then also responsible for the assaults last night. 

 

I was found unconscious in front of the pantry by the first nurse from the morning shift. She also found the bodies of everyone else. This thing had killed everyone. Every nurse, patient and doctor on that floor had been torn to pieces. Among these dead were Dr Stern and many nurses who had helped me. I tried really hard not to think about them. I had really liked Dr Stern. I must have been too out of it to notice. What upsets me more than all the death is that the thing hadn’t killed me like the others. No. It had wanted to take me away. To take me to its home? Its dimension? I really have no idea. I shiver at the thought. I’m still in the hospital but the cops have left someone behind go watch over me. They are looking for some psychopathic killer. They’re wrong of course, but at least we agree there is something dangerous after me. I’ll take their help. And hopefully I’ll be out of the hospital soon. Then I’m moving far away. 

 

 

I still wonder: have I killed that thing? Or just pissed it off? Would it be back? I guess, only time will tell.

Hundreds of years before the start of the series, before the existence of a transnational communications system, when Kingdoms as we know them today were only starting to be established, Remnant was a more dangerous place for mankind in many ways. Back in the day, brute strength was required to survive, and many weaker men would be plucked out of the gene pool, allowing mankind to grow ever stronger and recently, more intelligent. 300 years before present, it wasn't unusual to see Huntsmen who were absolutely huge, up to 8 feet tall in many cases, and bearing such gigantic, carved muscles that many of them would make Arnold Schwarzenegger look like Jerry Lewis. Their bodies were adapted to build muscle mass very easily and maintain their inflated mass with minimal effort. These men quite literally resembled Gods. Legends persist of how they would take down gargantuan (for the time) Grimm by themselves, and there are rumors that some would use their bare hands to dispatch them. Individual Huntsmen are remembered through public art, statues and frescoes, adorning the Kingdoms and smaller towns they singlehandedly protected in the infancy of these settlements, and the Huntsmen Academies of today often have dedicated monuments, and name their accolades as tribute to a few of the greatest heroes to inhabit their kingdoms.

Today, people of such might are much more scarce, thanks to Remnant becoming a more technologically advanced and overall safer place to live, which allows for the meek to survive and reproduce. More importantly, weapon technology has improved and the nature of aura has been better understood by the academies. Since getting a huntsman license in the modern age doesn't require you to reach such an enormous size and strength, this has allowed far more men, and a large number of women brave enough to take the challenge, to enroll themselves as defenders of mankind. However, this does come at a cost. Individual huntsmen and huntresses would probably be significantly weaker compared to the ones of bygone days, especially as new forms of Grimm appear, each new variety posing an escalating danger to mankind. This is why huntsmen are now commonly organised in teams in order to counter the threat. Today, you may occasionally find very tall men and women in Remnant, these individuals who are also very robustly built and muscular in addition to their heights, yes, even the women, are descendants of these mighty men who once guarded Humanity from extinction.


2. Fauna of Remnant


Compared to Earth, the environment of Remnant has been developed far less by human activity, thanks to the threat of Grimm. Therefore, there is a far greater degree of biodiversity in the more pristine landscapes of Remnant, and this means more animals, many of which are weirder than what you can imagine living on Earth today, such as horned Giraffe/Moose lookalikes, four tusked Elephants, Antelopes with trunks, Turtles with giant horns, polar Rhinoceros and Camel species, giant Ducks etc. somewhat reminiscent of Ice Age Earth. Because of this, mankind doesn't just have Grimm to watch out for when walking through the forest, they also have to be wary of whatever undiscovered predators might be lurking around. In addition, the wildlife doesn't have a great fear of mankind as you would see on Earth, as Humans haven't been able to pose any substantial threat to many of these species, therefore, a lot of them have a far more docile and tame behavior, especially if their habitats have no natural predators, such as in islands or isolated mountains.

I must mention, a lot of this does depend on how large the land area of Remnant is, as this would naturally give rise to a greater variety in animals. And it also depends on how the God of Light repopulated Remnant, whether it be through the Adam and Eve way, dropping a hundred Adams and Eves on Remnant or allowing humanity to evolve from monkeys.


3. High Society of Atlas


Atlas, the most technologically advanced city in Remnant, has developed it's own unique culture distinct from the rest of Remnant, thanks to it's bloody beginnings and modern affluence. Human colonization of Solitas was completed through 3 waves of migration, the first two barely survived the sub-zero temperatures and the lack of available food, but the hardened survivors were crucial to the success of the third wave in establishing the first permanent settlement, known as Mantle, their descendants still inhabit the historic old town on the floating city. Despite the first couple of decades being characterized by mass die-offs, the settlement quickly became the epicenter of pioneering technology and innovation while developing a very militaristic culture, seeking to colonize other parts of Remnant, all of these factors ensured that the kingdom emerged from the Great War as the world superpower. Coupled with the energy boom through mining dust and technology associated, the Atlesians have managed to make themselves incredibly wealthy, having built a near perfect, high trust society for themselves above the industrial sprawl of Mantle.

In contrast to their ancestors, the average Atlesian elite is rather slightly built, usually with not much in terms of muscle mass as they've eliminated the use for it. Most Atlesian men are very well educated, showcasing their great intellect (the most prized virtue in the modern kingdom) in their manner of speech, and they have a talent when it comes to charisma and friendliness. It's very easy for these young men to get themselves high paying jobs, even easier if your father owns the company you're trying to break into or runs a dust quarry, these jobs demand little in terms of labor and allow them to enjoy their free time at high-end restaurants, cocktail bars and parties with their co-workers. The women also have an easy time in life compared to those in other parts of Remnant, without the need to do menial work, they are allowed to pursue their creative hobbies, art, music, entertainment etc. and capitalize on them, groups of these socialites are a very common sight in the streets, department stores and cafes of the grand city and they also have a culture where they are expected to be exceedingly friendly, kind and generous to those around them. The wealthy, comfortable, stress-free lifestyle of young Atlesian elites has also made them rather eccentric, and somewhat child-like in their idealism, in contrast to the more pessimistic and jaded attitudes of some of the inhabitants in other parts of Remnant. They usually marry and start families young, which is easy when everybody in Atlas is a family friend of each other, and they tend to age very well, a mix of their natural beauty, healthy diets and care for their bodies, this is why you see a lot of girls travel to Atlas in search for some cute, rich boys.

Atlas is not only the center of defense technology and finance, it also has a vibrant theatrical scene, producing popular and acclaimed musicals and launching the careers of aspiring stars worldwide. The musical scene of Atlas is incredibly lively, the prevailing genre being Big Band music which is very important in the lives of Atlesians. It's also well known for the grandiose architecture that comes out of the city, often considered the most beautiful in Remnant (with Mistral not far behind) along with the Atlesians themselves. And finally, since Atlas is a highly intellectual society, there is a vibrant philosophical movement in the city, residents would often flock to coffee houses and libraries to hear the debates between the great minds about human behavior, the best economic and social models to follow and more.

Part 1:

The story starts nearly 10 years ago.

I moved to a new city to live together with a girl (let's call her Annie) I was dating, didn't know anyone else there. In time I meet some of her friends, including her ex-boyfriend (let's call him Jake) and his then-girlfriend (let's call her Eloise), both of whom we get on with really well and hang with regularly. I felt strongly attracted to Eloise almost from the get-go.

A couple months down the road we're at a party, Jake and Eloise are there too. We're chilling in an old caravan in the outside area (it was an alternative party venue) with the four of us, just chatting away. At some point Jake invites Annie to go dancing with him, she goes with. Eloise then comes and sits close me - it's just the two of us. She looks me in the eye meaningfully and goes ""You know, if I have to choose between trying something or never knowing, I'm the type of girl who would.""

She knew that Annie and I were practicing ethical non-monogamy, and apparently she and Jake wanted to try that out as well. I learned later that it was mostly because Jake was still in love with Annie and wanted to get back together with her, but I didn't know at the time.

I got the message from Eloise clearly, but unfortunately nothing materialized that evening due to circumstances. Over the next couple of weeks we're texting and trying to find a time to meet up, but it never works out.

Pretty soon, Jake and Eloise completely stop hanging out with us, which I regretted because I alway got on well with both of them. Didn't know/understand why at the time, but it had everything to do with Jake's feelings for Annie. I was getting blackballed by that entire group of friends by association.

Fast forward another couple months and things end between Annie and I. I'm stuck in the new city with few friends, I try reaching out the Jack and Eloise to hang out, but they don't seem to want to talk to me anymore.

I get on with my life, don't see or hear from Eloise for 7 years.

--

Part 2:

Fast forward to two years ago. I stayed in the same city and built a life there. In a relationship with a great girl for nearly 6 years at that point. Still ethically non-monogamous, but largely too busy with work, gym, projects and life together to really colour outside of the lines more than very occassionally.

One day I find myself a bit bored, and I check out some Instagram stories. I see that Eloise posted a picture of herself that screams ""I'm looking for a man/attention."" I think she looks fantastic and remember what we talked about in the past, so I decide to shoot my shot and react with the fire emoji to her story. She responds almost immediately and we start chatting away like nothing ever happened. We agree to meet up and reconnect. Takes a while to get something set up, but we finally manage to meet up for a date night. She makes it clear beforehand that it's in fact a date by saying ""I'm not an expensive date"".

We start the night off at a cocktail bar, talk the hours away and really vibe. The mutual attraction is obvious. She explains some the stuff that happened in the past, and that it wasn't really her choice to cut contact with me. She tells me she's broken up with Jack for about a year now, and that things didn't end well between them. The night progresses and we go dancing together in different places, keep on talking, just generally having a great time. Around 3 am we decide to head home separately, but we still chat on the phone for an hour once when we're both in our own beds.

The next day I'm just absolutely pinging, unable to focus, my thoughts utterly consumed with her. It's like the universe is screaming at me that this is destiny, there's some connection that transcends our current lives. I tell her this, and she says that she feels similarly. I'm ashamed to say that for a while I felt like I just had to be with her no matter what, consequences be damned. This in spite of the fact that I did then and still do love my current partner (of 8 years now) immensely.

Over the next couple of weeks Eloise and I chat almost daily, mutually express that we had a fantastic time together, and try to find a time to meet up as we're both busy with work and the other parts of our lives. She has a two week holiday in Greece and some work stuff abroad, so it ends up being six damned weeks that we have to wait, during which I'm constantly pining, any contact we have is like crack to me.

In the mean time we're sending flirty messages, she e.g. asks about what's the kinkiest stuff I've done, sends pictures of herself, et cetera. All this time I'm just dying to see her and want nothing more than to express what I feel physically, want to cook for her, cuddle, ..

We live less than 15 minutes away from eachother, and it seems crazy to me at the time that you wouldn't want to just make/steal some time here and there to be able to be close to each other.

In any case, the next time we can link up ends up being at her place for her 30th birthday party, with all of her friends there. I get there, ring the bell, she comes down to let me in. She jumps up, hugs me, and absolutely squeezes the shit out me as she's hugging me. We go up, she introduces me to her friends, and I start talking to everyone, getting to know them.

Her best friend and roommate (female) goes to the kitchen, pours me a drink and brings it to me. This is an important detail, because when I finish it a bit later I notice some kind of residue at the bottom of the glass. but don't really think anything of it and just go for a refill.

I don't get much of an opportunity to talk to Eloise as she's chatting with her friends, and I understand that she's having her friends vet me so I let them. One of her male friends is also there, visiting and staying with her for a couple of d ays because he usually lives in France, and it's obvious that she's in some way involved with him. The guy is around 185 centimeters tall, has amazing bonestructure in his face, and is clearly very intelligent. I'm generally quite confident but I have to say I was a little bit intimidated. In spite of that we get on as well as possible considering the situation, and I get the sense that he respects me.

Regardless, I'm really frustrated because after waiting for 6 weeks, him staying at her place means no chance for privacy. The night continues and at some point we head out at some point and go to some dance cafes. At some point Eloise and I are in the common part of the toilet area at the same time and she winks at me and goes ""Hey there, come here often ;-)?"". At that point I was quite out of it and it's one of the few things I remember of the night.

I was way way more out of it than I should have been considering the amount I had to drink, something I realized only later when I found pictures on my camera roll I couldn't remember taking at all,

After a couple hours out and about I was feeling kind of defeated and very much frustrated, and decided to just head home.

The next day I text her, we make a tiny bit of smalltalk and I try to set up a next date. Then, radio silence for 3 weeks. We get to chatting again and she tells me that she got some negative feedback from her friends following the night out. I tell her that it's possible, that I was way more out of it than I should have been, but take responsibility nonetheless and would like to hear what was said. She said let's meet up face to face and talk when we can.

There's some more back and forth during the next couple weeks/months but nothing ever works out or materializes.   
  
I get frustrated enough that I pour my heart out over chat and tell her I want her in my life, that I need to know whatever I'm feeling means, that I don't want to make the mistake again of letting her slip away in spite of what I felt.  
  
There's some more talk about reconnecting in person but it just doesn't happen. At some point after weeks of being consumed by anguish and hurt, I just decide to let things go and forget about her.

Part 3: current day.

Out of nowhere, after 2 years of 0 communication she messages me on WhatsApp saying she's getting into local politics. We chat a bit and I tell her she should tell me her program points over a coffee sometime, to which she agrees. Last Friday I ask if she has time to grab that coffee, and we agree to Saturday around lunch time at a coffee shop that also serves food. We said to play it by ear as she's doing some kind of rally/promotion thing and the previous weekend it ran on for nearly 2 hours.

Around 1pm I head into the city and let her know I'm on my way. She texts back saying sorry, she's in some other city trying to print posters last minute. I tell her alright, I have a rare weekend without plans and she can make it up to me later.

She ends up running around the entire province to get the posters with no luck. We chat for a long while Saturday night after she messages me, tells me it has a backup plan for Sunday. Mentions in passing that she's single again.  Sunday evening she sends me a single-view picture of herself. We chat again for a while, and I tell her I'm headed to bed, but let's find time to reconnect IRL sometime soon, to which she reacts 100!

Monday night late night she texts me about her poster-hanging adventures, and again on Tuesday. Today around 6pm I ask her on chat if she has any big dinner or postering plans for the evening.

She says  yeah, headed to three big cities in the province. I ask her if she needs any help. Tell her I was hoping to take her to dinner or cook for her, but that I just really want to see her.

She replies ""I wish, didn't even have time to eat the previous day"".

Nothing since.

--

I'm at my wits end with this.

My brain is telling me that this whole thing is terrible for me and that I should just cut contact completely and permanently, At the same time, something in my soul is just  yearning like my life depends on it.

I don't want to be on my death bed without knowing if this was something real or my brain playing tricks on me.

If I'm being strung along I don't understand the point of it. Is it a case of me having feelings and her just wanting to smash? I can't figure it out..",0,1728508384.0,dating,3,0.5,False

My best friend and I are looking to celebrate my birthday in Milwaukee as a day trip next Tuesday (Oct. 15). I want to pack in as much as I possibly can. I have an idea of some things I would like to do however I don’t know any specific places that would be good to go to. 

We’ll be getting there around 12:30 and would like to stop at locally owned cafe then find some kind of metaphysical shop. Or just some kind of thrifting/vintage shops. Afterwards I’m looking to do something that will take up a bit more time like go karts, a trampoline park, something very hands on. Would love some restaurant recommendations for after this! For the last bit I’d love to either do some bar hopping or find a really good brewery. 

For context: 
I’m 22 F and my friend is 23 NB. We’re in the punk scene, so any shows that may be happening would be great. Like I mentioned above we love coffee, thrifting, spirituality, hands on activities, and I’m open to slightly touristy things. I would like to pay for as little transportation as possible so ideally it would all happen in a relative area but ofc I’m willing to hop on the bus or pay for ride share if it really comes down to it. What I have written above is just a general outline, so it’s flexible.

What’s the best method to do so? ,"So I managed to get Anna to level 7 in her Paralogue thanks to following IcedCoffeeGaming’s video guide on how to do so with the four best earlygame units (Alear, Yunaka, Celine & Chloe). I decided that I wanted to train her because I didn’t use her in my last Engage run & because I want to give her some favouritism as a unit I like in my current Engage Maddening run. However, when I tried to level Anna in Jean’s Paralogue with Micaiah equipped on her as it is the recommended way to do so (according to community consensus + Youtube), I can barely get her to above lvl 8. Not only that, the enemy AI starts doing really weird stuff I don’t want it to do if I go a tile too high with one of my units (I.e. Yunaka or Chloe), targeting the wrong Ally NPC or attacking someone like Yunaka, when I want the enemy to damage Alear or Alfred instead.

What’s the best, efficient strategy of leveling Anna up to lvl 9/10 (however much she can level up to anyways) with Micaiah? When should I use GS on Anna & how can I effectively AOE heal with my other units when I get them purposely damaged by the enemy? My team comp is as follows: F!Alear with Edelgard Ring (Steel Sword weapon) Chloe with Sigurd Ring (Fensailr with Sigurd Engraving) Celine with Celica Ring (Fire with Celica Engraving) Anna with Micaiah Ring (Compact Axe +3, no engraving) Alfred with Marth Ring( Slim + Steel Lance) & then Yunaka with Iron Dagger + Louis with Javelin. These two have S Bond rings equipped, but I don’t remember which ones. Most of my team is around Lvl 6-lvl 9 & I’ve also given them one S rank meal, with Alear getting a few extra stats thanks to Clanne’s cooking. 

Edit: Forgit to mention, I’m not using any DLC emblems (except Edelgard) in my current run, so Starsphere for Tiki is unfortunately not an option for me to do. ",1,1728507901.0,fireemblem,10,0.66,False

Can you recommend me an alternative in the same price range that is similar in both grind and build quality?  
Another candidate would be the 1zpresso J-Ultra, but that costs double the price of the k4 (220$).   
Also, if I understand correctly, the k6 would not be good for me, since it is mostly for lighter roasts.

I had gone up to visit her at school one night and we were having a great night with all her friends until we went to the bar and I got in a little bit of a fight with a guy there. I left because I was pissed that that happened and embarrassed that I let that event happen. She followed me out and we started talking on the sidewalk and I know I swore a lot and was yelling but she took some of it as yelling and swearing at her. I wanted to walk by myself back to her house to let off some steam so I walked without her. It was night time and she was pissed i let her walk out by herself. That’s the sum of it. 

I slept on the couch left her a note saying how sorry I was that I hurt her feelings and embarrassed her in front of her friends and how much I love her and left in the morning at her request. 

A few days later we have a talk about it and we break up. I apologized sincerely for it and told her many times that’s not me and not the person I ever want to be. She said that she doesn’t know what to do and that she still loves me and cares about me a lot. She said her friends said that she had to either be all in or all out of the relationship and she said she couldn’t be 100% all in right now. She was crying and saying she doesn’t know if she made the right decision. We were holding hands and hugging the entire time and at one point we were both crying and she asked to kiss me one last time. 

2 days later she texts me and says that she’s doing really really bad and thinks that she should’ve taken more time to think about the decision like I had said and she couldn’t go to sleep until I got home the night before because we have our locations shared. We talked on the phone for a little bit and she said that she talked to her parents and siblings about it and they said that it sounded like her friends talked her into it. While we were on the phone we talked about all the things we had planned and she was sad we weren’t gonna be able to do them. After talking about the bad stuff we just talked like we were still together and it was a great conversation and we both said it was so nice to hear the other persons voice. 

Sorry about the whole book I wrote lol. We haven’t talked since then and this Sunday would be 2 weeks since we talked and she’s coming home. I want to try to meet up with her for coffee and try to get back together but take it slow. I know I messed up and don’t want any of that to happen again and I know we both still love each other.

My boyfriend A (currently 25) and me N (26) have been dating since July 2020, we decided to move in with each other in June of 2021. When we first started dating A tells me that L would tell him that she didn't like him and that she would do anything to get rid of him. I didn't think that she would say or do anything like that. We got an one bedroom apartment and having the time of our lives. My twin sister L was living with her boyfriend at the time her their own apartment. A few months later in Oct. she finds out her boyfriend cheated of her so she calls me to ask if she can move in for a short period of time. A and me said yea that is fine because that was really shitty of him. Lets fast-forward to Jan. and she has a new boyfriend. I start to ask her like hey when do you think you will be moving out and that is when she says actually I have an idea. A looks at me and I'm like ok what is this idea? She recommended that her and her boyfriend and A and I move into a two bedroom apartment. I'm like sure because we are twins and we have this bond no one understands. We have always been really close and did everything with each other till college and she started dating and moved out. Anyways so we upgraded to a two bedroom apartment in June of 2022. We split everything in half on the bills. Everything was in A and my name, we paid and L and her boyfriend paid us half back.

 In Oct or so she eventually breaks up with this guy too. She starts seeing this guy from her job and she is not paying us the full amount she owes anymore for the apartment. She is going out and drink and buying the green stuff to smoke. They are not quite at all in the bedroom. I have told her like the walls are thin and A and I can hear everything so if you could like maybe say hey we plan to have fun so A and I can go step out, nope we do not ever get a warning. In Jan. of 2022 A and I have a chat and come to a decision that we can not afford another year in this two bedroom apartment because we are paying for everything. We are paying the monthly rent, streaming services, food, toilet paper, and the Wi-Fi. We have a sit down with L and let her know that in June we are not staying in this apartment and plan to be moving. She gets upset saying that she thought this was going to be long term and that she is going though a hard time with money. We till her sorry and maybe ask another friend to roommate with them. 

So A and I move out in April to our new one bedroom apartment that we currently are in. L moves in with her boyfriend and in Sept of 2022 they have a fight and he takes his stuff and moves out. She is doing ok for awhile and she has a really good job and then crazy story happens that I don't care to tell because it has nothing to do with me. She has to leave this job and gets a job that doesn't pay as well. L stops paying her car insurance in Oct. 2023 that is through our parents that they charge her $100 every month. She ask our parents for money because she can not afford her rent all by herself. Our parents tell her she can move back in with they so that she can be safe and stable, but no she wants ""freedom"". 

She calls me in Dec. 2023 crying and upset because she can not afford anything and she has been hurting herself because no one wants to stay with her. I feel bad because it hurts my heart that she thinks that way. I talk to A about it and he says she is only using me and that she is not going to pay us like last time. She makes me feel bad and sorry about her so that I will help. I get A to let her move in with us again...... She has the bedroom and we live out in the living room area. All we have are two desk with gaming pcs and we couldn't fit all that into the bedroom so I just it would make sense since we are always on the computers that L would have the bedroom. Plus we all have cats. L cat doesn't get along with ours and my 2 cats shouldn't be locked away in a small bedroom. 

I wished I listened to my wonderful boyfriend. I keep thinking she is family and I should help with. I want L to be the person she use to be before the alcohol and the vaping. I can't help myself but to help her and she keeps Fing me over in the end. 

My current problem is that since she moved into this one bedroom apartment in Dec. 2023 she has caused fights between A and me. In Feb. 2023 she get a new boyfriend they come in and out of the apartment all day and night. She doesn't care if we are asleep when they come in high and giggling and opening and shutting the bedroom door and the bathroom door. Over time the new boyfriend moves in...not asked or said anything he is just here all the time. We only ask L to pay $500 for rent/bills. She hasn't been paying she lets this guy move in and he doesn't pay. A and I are always fighting about money that she owes us. her not moving out, and not having space for anything that we want to better our lives. I keep telling myself I can't hurt her or kick her out because she is my twin and I would feel like poop. We told L and her boyfriend that we are getting a trailer and that if they can show us that they can pay rent and pay us the money she owes that they can come with. In time they started paying us money. Life is going well and then BOOOOOM! They break up at the end of Sept. she is not paying us back still from what she owes. A wants me to drop her because she is not a positive person. She post on Snap and FB that she is sad and doesn't want to talk to anyone. Post videos of her crying for attention. She is always giving me issues that she doesn't have money to pay me back. She will walk in the apartment with fast-food bags and Dutch Bros coffee in hand almost every day. Every time she leaves the apartment she has to get coffee. I get it I love coffee but I brew coffee at home and I can make Pumpkin Spice Lattes here. Anyways I need advice and I need to know would I be the A-hole to kick my twin out? 

My boyfriend shared one of Charlottes videos to me on TikTok and I'm sorry I feel in love with this whole channel. He wanted me to share my story on here to see if other people agree with him. He tells me he sees the red flags and that I'm a doormat to my twin and wants it to stop he feels like this would open my eyes more. I feel like since I know how he feels about my twin that he is bias so here I am. ",9,1728507520.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,14,0.91,False

I (25F) met a guy (26M) by matching on  Raya, following him on IG and he DMed me. We texted all day and the next day. He’s a musician with a couple million followers, and he had a concert (he’s on tour) that day so he said he’d like me to go. I went, had a great time, and then went over to his apt after. We hung out, talked, and ending up hooking up. I drove him to the airport, and he texted me an hr later saying “what a lovely night” “excited to see you when I get back” etc. and we texted for the next 3 days, and I left him on read for 12 days because he said “well I can’t wait to hangout when i’m back” and I assumed that meant that he didn’t need to talk until then. (he had 3 shows, 6 interviews, and threw a first pitch at an MLB game) I knew he was busy and I was too, so I was using this as time to learn to grow out of my anxious attachment. 

12 hrs after he landed back in LA, he called me at 1pm and asked to see me. said he was at a coffee shop nearby reading his bible. (this makes me think he actually likes me.. seems wholesome and was during the day) I was on set, so I couldn’t but he called me again that night and asked me to hangout with him and his friend (even more famous than him). disclaimer: I only add the fame information because I don’t think 2 celebrities would be comfortable inviting over just a random girl/hookup if they didn’t trust/like me. 

I went over, stayed the night with him at his apt again, and we had some deep and intimate conversations. learned about each other, and cuddled/shared intimacy. and it felt good. the next morning he was in a hurry, had a ton of things to do that day so I said bye and he kissed me 3x. I called him the next day and asked if he was free to see him before we both leave town again for 12 days. (we both work in entertainment and travel for work) he said he’d like to see me but was going to be in studio all day but would text me if he could make it. didn’t text me. it’s been 5 days and i’m sad that we don’t talk between seeing each other, as obviously that makes me feel inherently like a hookup/sneaky link. His 2 best friends know about me as we’ve spoken on the phone in front of them and met them both. he says we should do things that take place during the day, but simply haven’t had the time as we were both in town for only 2 days at the same time since we met. 

this week, he’s on the east coast at a premiere and going to an event with family. we didn’t make plans to see each other next. i’m not sure what to do. we don’t owe each other anything, and I don’t want to scare him away by reaching out if he doesn’t want anything. but i’m interested in him and don’t want to give off the impression i’m not. but I also don’t want to bother him :’) advice please!!

I (23 F) have been no-contact with my dad since 2016. I moved out of his abusive household to live with my mother when I was 16. I had to talk to him again in 2018 when he sent my younger brother to a wilderness/rehab facility when he was 17 for smoking weed. I was the only person my brother would talk to, but since my father put him into it, I still had to communcate with my dad during that period. There is a lot of history with a whole childhood of both physical and mental abuse that caused the cut off in the first place. I am starting to do better but to be honest I am still in the trenches of the healing process. I have been no-contact with him after that event. I havent even seen him. But somehow (I'm guessing through relatives that still talk to him) he knows that I live in a collegetown in upstate NY, about 5 hours away from his home in NJ. Monday, he texted me:

""Hi I am going to be in [Town] this weekend. I was hoping to see you. I know it's been a long time. Maybe just coffee ""

I used to have his number blocked but because I switched to a new texting app, it did not come with the same settings. I haven't messaged him back, and have been panicked all week thinking about it. 

I honestly have so many feelings about it that I don't even know what to do and they are all coming out at once. He isn't really dangerous persay, and he doesn't even know what my car or house look like, but I am really stressed about it. All I want to say to him is: ""You are not welcome in my town. Stay the f*ck away from me and stay the f*ck out of my life"". That phrase keeps repating over and over again in my head. I just feel suddenly so unsafe in my safe place. 

The thing is, it is so easy to never come here. There is nothing in my town that you need to come here for. Yes the foliage is beautiful now and there are some pretty sights, but you can go to anywhere else in the Northeast to see that. The only reason I think he might be here is to take his stepchild (who i think is roughly college-aged) to tour colleges, which feels awful on so many levels. I love it here, and to think he would go out of his way to come here and that he might want to see me makes my skin crawl. I know it sounds dramatic but I honestly just don't know what to do. Im scared that he will come back. I just want my place to be peaceful.

First time espresso machine owner - I had been on the fence for awhile, but decided to get a Breville Barista Express on sale for prime day(s).  When previously looking it was _way_ too easy to go down the rabbit home then I'm looking at thousands of dollars, so I feel this is a good entry point for me :)

I'm sure I'll have more operational questions soon, but I've watched many videos and most folks end up pulling shots pretty much the same.  For example some folks pre-weigh their beans and only load 18g into the hopper...while I've seen others just have theirs set to dose the proper amount.

Are milk:espresso amounts generally pretty standard?  Like, for a honey latte or similar 200ml of milk, honey, then espresso - does order matter?  Do you typically stir the ""flavor"" into the pulled shot or how do you prevent it from sitting at the bottom? 

What are some accessories that are ""nice to have"" vs necessary and everywhere in between? 

1. I have a kitchen scale large and small that looks like it'll fit under - neither have timers.
2. Is a bottomless portafilter worth it from the get go? 
3. Different tamp/WDT/puck prep? 
4. I'll probably stick to lattes or cappuccinos - for glasses do folks like using something like [this](https://flurglassware.com/products/flur-iced-coffee-glasses) for iced drinks and [these](https://flurglassware.com/products/flur-latte-glass?variant=42945951629503) for warm drinks? 
5. Dosing funnel? 
6. Anything else?  I'm sure like with anything else there are a ton of things you can buy but it's not all super necessary and it seems many folks can just start dialing in shots with a stock setup.",1,1728506942.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

1g01ka5,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1g01ka5/friends_and_family_a_new_beginning_chapter_15/,"Friends and Family: A New Beginning, Chapter 15","Jim and his girls were greeted by the surprise Autumn was talking about.  It was lying on the wicker couch on the front porch. 

But it wasn’t just any surprise.

It was Sydney Cavanaugh!

Sydney was covered up by a large pink blanket.  All Jim and the girls saw were legs encased in black pantyhose and feet in black high heels.  Lindsay gave Sydney a light shake.  She said, “Sydney.  Sydney Cavanaugh.  Sydney, come on, honey.  Wake up.  It’s downright cold out here.”

Which was true.  The temperature had already dropped to around forty.  It wouldn’t get much colder overnight.  That would be good because the car show was tomorrow, and no one wanted it to be much colder.  And it would be sunny tomorrow.  Another good thing.

Sydney slowly got up.  As she did, a sliver of her white slip showed at the small slit at the bottom of the back of her black skirt.  Sydney was also wearing a green floral print blouse.  Jim helped her up.  Sydney asked, “Could one of you please get my big bag over there?”

Sydney pointed to where her big black duffle bag was.  Lindsay picked up the bag.  Lindsay also saw some clothes on hangers and in big plastic bags, as if they maybe had come from a dry-cleaning place.  Valerie, who was behind Lindsay, picked up those clothes on hangers.  Sydney said, “Thanks.  Valerie, please be careful and try not to let those clothes get wrinkled.”

Chelsea was carrying Caitlyn, who was fast asleep.  Chelsea said, “Dad, I’m gonna go ahead and take Caitlyn in.  I know she’s ready for bed.”

Jim nodded his head in agreement.  Lindsay carried Sydney’s big black bag inside.  Jim had Valerie hand him those clothes on hangers.  Lauren put her arm around Sydney as they walked into the house, along with Jim and his daughters.  Lauren told Sydney to sit down on the couch.  Sydney smoothed her skirt as she sat down, and she crossed her legs.  Jim gently laid the clothes on hangers down on one of the recliners.  Jim said, “Sydney, you just sit there and relax, okay?  I’ll make you some hot cocoa.”

Sydney nodded her head.  Jim stepped into the kitchen.  Lauren took a large mug out of one of the cabinets.  Jim took a pod of Swiss Miss Cocoa out of the pod holder, and he put it in his Keurig.  The mug of cocoa was ready in about a minute.  Lauren put a few marshmallows in it, and she handed it to Sydney.  Meanwhile, Jim took a can of Coke out of the refrigerator.  Then Jim sat down in a recliner across from where Sydney was sitting.  Then Jim asked, “Okay, what happened?”

Sydney said, “Jim, I was asked to leave the house this evening just before Mom and the others left for the beauty contest.”

“Why were you asked to leave the house?” Lauren asked.

Sydney said, “Tim and his two daughters showed up at the house this afternoon.  Mom called me at work.  She said I needed to get to the house as soon as possible.  I asked Rachel to close and lock the office.  When I got there, Mom sat me down, and she had a talk with me.  She said that Tim and his girls had been evicted from their house and they needed a place to stay.”

At that moment, Jim seemed rather confused.  He knew Tim and Autumn were now romantically involved.  Jim saw the U-Haul truck at Autumn’s house in the first week of November when Julie had that meeting at her house concerning the beauty contest, the upcoming car show and her plans for Salem Church.  That was when Jim asked Mark if Tim and Autumn were becoming serious and maybe considering marriage.  Mark said they were becoming serious, but he was unsure if marriage was in their plans.  Jim asked Sydney if Alex was still at the house.  Sydney said, “Yes, Alex is still home.  She still has her own room, just as I did.”

Jim got up and went to the front window.  He opened the curtains.  He saw a Corvette.  A red 1968 convertible.  Jim also tried to look for another car.  He wondered if Sydney’s red Camaro was in the driveway.  It was.  Sydney said she would have to go back to the house in the morning to get her car, as well as the last of her things.

Sydney continued her conversation.  “Mom said Carmen and Cara would need a room of their own.  It had to come down to Alex or myself.  Alex can’t afford to leave home right now, so Mom told me I would have to leave.  Mom said it broke her heart to make this decision.  I didn’t want to leave this neighborhood, let alone my house.  But Mom said she would let Alex stay, so that would mean I would have to go.  So, I packed some of my things in my duffle bag, and I ended up here.  I slept on the porch until you and your girls got home.”

Sydney also explained that she and Jim were now in a relationship, she felt it best to come to his house.  Jim said, “It’s okay, Sydney.  I’m glad you came here.  I do have a guest room you are more than welcome to use.  Please stay as long as you’d like.  You know you are always welcome here.”

Sydney softly said, “Thank you, Jim.  I’d like that very much.”

At that moment, Jim’s mind went back to that warm summer evening in Lansing, North Carolina, in August of 1984.  That was the moment when Jim and his friends made that special moment to remain friends, no matter what life would throw at them.  Sydney was one of those friends.  Now, more than ever, Jim and Sydney knew they would need each other.  True, Jim and Sydney were not in a relationship in the summer of 1984.  Sydney did not have a boyfriend at the time.  But of course, Jim was in a serious relationship with Candi Robertson, who would eventually become his wife. 

Sydney took another sip of her cocoa.  Then she asked, “How did the beauty contest go?”

Jim answered, “It went well.  Caitlyn won her age group.  Kristyn and Christie also won in their respective age groups.”

“My beautiful niece won, huh?”

“Yes, Sydney.  She did.”

“I’m sorry I wasn’t there this evening.  I guess I was too upset with Mom making me leave the house.”

Jim looked at Sydney for a moment as she finished her cocoa.  It looked like her eyes were about to well up with tears.  Jim put his hand on Sydney’s shoulder, and he said to her, “It’s okay, Sydney.  As I said, the beauty contest went well.  And we brought in a lot of money for the church.”

Sydney softly said, “That’s nice.”

“Sydney, I know you’ll be at the car show tomorrow.”

“Yes, Jim.  I most certainly will.”

Sydney gave Jim the empty mug.  Jim asked her if she would like another mug of cocoa.  He told her it would not be any trouble.  But Sydney said, “Thanks, Jim.  But I’m good.  And I’m also tired.”

Lauren looked out the window.  She said, “Sydney, it looks like you left your blanket outside.  I’ll go out and get it.”

While Lauren went out and got the blanket, Jim escorted Sydney upstairs.  They stopped by Caitlyn’s bedroom.  Chelsea was putting Caitlyn in bed.  Jim and Sydney stepped into the bedroom.  Chelsea said, “Hi, Sydney.  Dad, Caitlyn just brushed her teeth.  She also used the toilet.  She fell asleep on the toilet.  I ended up carrying her in here.”

Jim said, “She did have an eventful evening, winning her age group in the beauty contest and all that.  I know she’s ready for bed.”

Sydney smiled as she looked at Caitlyn, asleep in her bed.  Caitlyn still had her Tinker Bell clock radio.  Chelsea turned the radio on a new Charlotte radio station specializing in classic R&B.  She kept the volume low, and she set it to turn off in an hour and a half.  Jim put the covers over her, and he gave her a kiss on her cheek.  Caitlyn had a new bedside lamp.  It was based on the Disney movie “The Little Mermaid.”  Jim turned off her lamp, but there was still a faint light in the room, thanks to a night light.  Jim, Sydney and Chelsea all stepped out of the bedroom.  Jim left her bedroom door ajar.

Chelsea went to her bedroom while Jim and Sydney stepped into the guest room.  Jim always kept the guest room looking nice.  The room had a beach-like feel to it.  It had pictures of palm trees on all but one wall.  On the remaining wall was a picture of the old houses of Charleston, along The Battery.  It had a small TV, a large bed, a dresser and a mirror.  On the nightstand, there was a clock radio and a lamp made out like a lighthouse, something Jim bought at a garage sale some years back.  Sydney thought it was nice.  She was always impressed by how nice Jim kept his house. 

Jim turned on the lamp.  Then he turned the sheets and blankets on the bed.  Sydney said she would be willing to stay in the guest room.  Even though Jim and Sydney were now in a serious relationship, they decided they would not sleep in the same bed together until marriage.  It just didn’t seem like the thing to do.

Jim stayed in the room with Sydney for a few minutes.  They sat down on the bed.  Jim asked Sydney if she wanted to watch something on TV, but she said no.  Jim turned on the clock radio, which was set to the same Charlotte radio station Caitlyn was listening to.  Whitney Houston was playing.  *Run to You*.  Jim looked out the window and he saw a fire truck racing down East Morehead Street toward Kings Drive.  Sydney slowly got up and walked to where Jim was standing.  She put her arm around Jim.  Sydney said, “I feel so bad I didn’t show up at the beauty contest tonight.”

Jim said, “It was good, and everyone had a good time.  Everybody there was wondering about you.”

“Mom made her decision this evening.  I had to leave the house right away.  I just didn’t want to face anyone.  So, I just packed some of my things and walked to your house.  Then I fell asleep on your porch.”

“I can’t believe you did that, cold as it is outside.  You could have caught a cold.  I’m just glad you at least had a blanket with you to cover up with.”

“I still have some of my stuff at the house.  I know Mom wants me to go there and get it.  My car also.”

Jim could see the house across the street from his.  He was able to see Sydney’s red Camaro in the driveway, along with Tim’s classic red Corvette and an unfamiliar dark gray Ford truck.  Jim figured it belonged to Tim.  Autumn’s own car, a new Chrysler 300, was probably in the garage.  Jim couldn’t see it because the garage door was closed.  Then Jim looked in the other direction, at the Charlotte skyline.  It was lit up.  As always, it looked beautiful.  Sydney said, “It always struck me how beautiful things around us could be this time of year, with the holidays coming and all that.”

Jim agreed with that.  Over the next few days, the houses all over Dilworth would be decked out for Christmas.  There would be Christmas lights of every color all around.  Jim also knew he would soon have to start doing his Christmas shopping, especially for his five daughters.  He knew Lauren was wanting a new laptop computer.  Caitlyn was wanting a new bike.  Valerie was wanting a remote-control car (a Corvette).  Jim was not sure what Chelsea and Lindsay were wanting.  Jim thought he’d get Chelsea a new tablet since he felt she would possibly need it for school.  Chelsea was already in college.  She would soon be working part-time at a nearby Walgreen’s.  Before long, Chelsea would be shopping around for a car.  Jim hoped it would be either from Queen City Chevrolet or Faulkner Motors because it would probably hurt Jim or Walter if she didn’t.  Jim did think about getting Lindsay a new guitar.  The one she had now was a little too small for her, and she was now ready for a better one.  But that didn’t stop Lindsay from doing well tonight at the beauty contest when she played her guitar.

Jim got ready to leave the guest room.  He and Sydney hugged each other, but they didn’t kiss.  Jim felt maybe Sydney wasn’t in the mood right now.  He just walked out the door, and Sydney went on to bed.

Jim walked downstairs to the kitchen.  He saw Chelsea and Lindsay getting them a nighttime snack.  A box of Ding-Dongs, a big bag of potato chips (plain Ruffles) and some onion dip made with sour cream and onion soup mix.  Chelsea and Lindsay were already sitting down at the table.  Jim decided to join them.  “You girls do know onion dip can be murder on your breath, don’t you?” Jim asked the girls.

Lindsay answered, “Yes, Dad.  We know.  But we do like it with potato chips.”

Then Chelsea said, “Dad, people know food of all kinds can be bad for us.  But it doesn’t stop them from making it.”

Jim said, “I know.  It may be junk food, but we all enjoy it.”

Lindsay said, “Yes, Dad.  But I guess this world would be a boring place without junk food.”

Then Chelsea said, “Lindsay, you were good on that guitar tonight.”

“Thanks, Chelsea.  And Dad, you and Mark did a good job on that sound system.”

“Thanks, girls.  I think the beauty contest was a tremendous success.”

Chelsea looked at both Jim and Lindsay, and she said, “It would have been nice if more girls took part.  Especially one.”

Jim said, “Okay, you two.  I think Valerie did a good job tonight as a judge.  She wanted to be a judge, so I guess I couldn’t stop her.”

Lindsay said, “Yes, Dad.   We know Valerie did well.”

Then Jim said, “I know we’re all looking forward to the car show tomorrow.”

Chelsea asked, “Dad, do you think the same ones who took part in the car show a few months ago will take part again this time?”

Jim answered, “Maybe.  Or at least some of them will.  I understand Joseph Daniels is planning to enter another car.  And there may be a few new additions.  I hope the car show’s a success.”

“Dad, I’m sure it will be,” Chelsea said.

Jim, Lindsay and Chelsea ate some more, and then they all went on to bed.  They all wanted to get all the sleep they could because they all wanted to be fresh and rested up for tomorrow.

 

😊

 

Jim and the girls were all up by eight o’ clock the next morning.  Before Jim could start breakfast, the doorbell rang.  Jim walked to the front door.  Walter was standing at the door.  Jim opened the door, and he let Walter in.  “Hi, Dad.  It sure is good to see you this morning,” Jim said.             

Walter had a big bag in his hand.  It was from Bojangles’.  Walter said, “Thanks, Jim.  I just enjoy visiting with all my relatives.  I guess you’re wondering what’s up with this bag.”

“Yes, Dad.  I am wondering.”

“Jim, it just so happens I got breakfast for you and your girls.  Kate and I and the others have already had ours.”

Jim and Walter walked into the kitchen.  By the time Walter put the big bag on the kitchen counter, all five girls were already down the stairs and in the kitchen.  Walter told Jim and his girls to help themselves to what was in the bag.  They all thanked Walter, and they dug in.  There was steak, country ham, smoked sausage and bacon and egg and cheese biscuits in the bag.  Jim’s favorite was steak, along with ham.  After the biscuits were gone, Jim told the girls to go upstairs and get ready to go to the car show.  They were ready in about twenty minutes.  Walter said he needed to go back to his house and get ready, so he left.  Walter said he would see Jim and his girls at the car show.

Just as Walter left, the phone rang.  Jim went to check the caller ID to see who it was.  After he saw it was Julie, he answered the phone.  Jim said, “Hi, Julie.  what’s going on?”

Julie said, “Jim, I need to have a word with you.”

“Sure, Julie.  What about?”

“Jim, about that church building we visited the other day.  I would like that to be kept a secret until Sunday morning.”

“Sure, Julie.  I haven’t told a soul about it.”

“Thanks, Jim.  I’ll announce it tomorrow after the morning services.”

“Julie, you don’t have to worry about me keeping that secret.”

“It’s okay, Jim.  I knew you would keep it a secret.  I did tell Mark about it this morning.  He’s going to keep it a secret, just like you’re doing.”

Jim said, “I’m sure he will.  Does anyone else know about it?”

Julie answered, “You and Mark, and I also told Kendra, Ariel and Simon.  You know by now Kendra and Ariel are on bed rest and won’t be at services for a while.  Simon will be staying home with Ariel.”

“Is anyone staying with Kendra?”

“Jim, I asked Mark about that.  He said one of his daughters will be staying with Kendra.  Mark said Kellie will be staying with Kendra during church services in the morning.”

At that moment, Jim heard someone walking down the stairs and into the kitchen.  It was Sydney, and she was wearing an oversized Carolina Panthers T-shirt (the T-shirt was one of Jim’s, but he said she could wear it if she needed to).  Jim turned and gave her a wave.  Then he said to Julie, “I just saw Sydney walking downstairs.  I guess she just woke up.”

Julie asked, “What is Sydney doing at your house?”

At that moment, Jim walked out the front door as quickly as he could with the cordless phone, and he sat down on one of the chairs on the front porch.  He said, “Julie, I finally found out why Sydney wasn’t at the beauty contest last night.  She was sleeping on my front porch while we were all at the beauty contest.”

“Really?  Why, Jim?”

Jim answered, “Julie, it looks like things between Autumn and Tim are getting more and more serious.  So much so, Tim had decided to move in with Autumn, and he brought Carmen and Cara with him.”

“Jim, I don’t understand.  Did Autumn ask Sydney to move out of the house?”

“I suppose so.  Alex and Sydney had their own bedrooms.  One of them had to go, so I guess Autumn chose to let Alex stay and ask Sydney to leave.”

“Oh, Jim.  That’s cold.  I guess Carmen and Cara needed a room of their own.”

Maybe there was some truth in what Jim just said.  Between Alex and Sydney, it seemed Sydney had a larger income than Alex.  Alex worked as a sales associate at the Belk store in Northlake Mall.  Jim and the others all knew Alex didn’t really have a huge income.  On the other hand, Sydney had a good income as an interior decorator.  Sydney’s interior decorating business had really been taking off.  With help from Rachel, there were a lot of clients, with a waiting list for more. 

Jim said to Julie, “From what I was told, Tim and his girls had been evicted from their home and they had nowhere else to go.  They ended up at Autumn’s house.”

Then Julie asked Jim, “Any idea why Sydney ended up at your house?”

Jim said, “Sydney and I are now in a relationship.  Maybe she thought my house would be a good choice.”

“Jim, you and Sydney didn’t sleep together, did you?”

“Julie, I did not.  I didn’t think it was the right thing to do.  I’m sure Sydney thought the same thing.”

“Good, Jim.  Remember, you two are not married.”

“Julie, I am aware of that.  You know Candi and I saved ourselves for marriage.  I’d like to do the same thing with Sydney.”

“Okay, Jim.  I best go and get ready.  I’ll see you at the car show, okay?”

“Yeah, Julie.  Sure.  I’ll see you there.”

Jim hung up the phone.  At that moment, Valerie and Lauren stepped onto the front porch.  Valerie said, “Dad, Sydney said she would like some coffee.”

Jim looked at the two girls, and he said, “Sure, girls.  Make her a cup.  Use the Keurig.  You girls know how to operate it.”

Valerie and Lauren stepped back into the house.  Just as they got to the kitchen, Jim walked to the front door and shouted, “Make me a cup, too.  Okay?”

Just as Jim sat back down, April Lynn, Malachi and Stacy showed up.  April Lynn said, “Hi, Jim.  I just spoke to Ashley.  She said something is going on here.”

Then Malachi said, “Yeah, Jim.  Let’s have it.”

Jim said, “Me and my girls came home from the beauty contest to find Sydney sleeping on my front porch.”

Stacy said, “See, everyone.  I told you.  I knew something was up.”

Jim said, “Stacy, something was up.  Apparently, Autumn told Sydney to move out of her house.  She allowed Alex to stay.”

April Lynn took a swig out of the bottle of Pepsi she had with her.  Then she said, “Jim, I don’t understand.  What happened last night?”

Jim answered, “From what Sydney said, Tim and his girls were evicted from their house and they ended up at Autumn’s house.”

Malachi asked, “Why did Sydney get thrown out of the house?”

Right then, April Lynn gave Malachi a murderous look.  Then she said, “Malachi, I don’t really like that term.  Thrown out or kicked out or whatever.  I think being asked to leave is a much better term, okay?”

Malachi put up his hand and said, “Yeah, sister.  Sure.  I’ll try to watch it.”

Then Jim said, “Tim and his daughters got evicted from their house and they needed somewhere to go.  Autumn and Tim are now getting serious, so I guess Tim made the choice to move in with Autumn.  I’m also guessing Autumn asked Sydney to leave so that Carmen and Cara can have a room.”

Stacy said, “I hope Autumn didn’t play favorites, choosing Alex over Sydney.”

Then Malachi said, “Stacy, surely not.  Maybe it’s because Sydney has a larger income than Alex.  I know Alex doesn’t really make a lot, working at Belk in Northlake Mall.”

April Lynn took another drink of her Pepsi, and then she said, “I know that.  Alex has told me quite a few times about going to school and trying for another profession.  I would like to see her do that.  I know it would do her a world of good.”

Jim said, “April Lynn, I agree with you.  Maybe if Alex went back to school and tried for another profession, it just might make her a better person.”

Jim knew what he was talking about.  It went back to something he heard once on a sitcom.  *Concentrating on your life can make you a better person*.  When Jim heard it, he took it to heart.  Since Candi’s tragic death in a plane crash, Jim had been trying to concentrate on his life.  That included raising his five daughters as only as he could.  He also tried to concentrate on his job at Queen City Chevrolet.  And he also continued to make good on that promise he made to his friends to always stick together, while also making new ones along the way. 

Malachi had a question for Jim.  “Are there any wedding bells ringing for you and Sydney?”

Jim tried to find an easy answer for what seemed like a hard question for him.  But he came up with one.  “Malachi, I guess you could say that.  For years since Candi’s death, I guess I thought there was no one out there for me.  I guess I spent all that time focusing on three things.  My job, my daughters and my friends.  Now, I am starting to realize something.  Maybe life is worth living.”

Then April Lynn said, “I’m wondering if there will be wedding bells for Tim and Autumn as well.”

Stacy said, “Maybe it’s starting to look like it.”

Then Malachi said, “And Jim, you know there will be a day when you will have to hand your girls off in marriage.”

Jim put up his hand and said, “Let’s don’t even go there.  Okay?”

April Lynn said, “Sure, Jim.  Your daughters are still young.  As you know, your Lindsay and my Ryan are an item.  But we are in no hurry to see them get married, are we?”

“No, April Lynn.  We most certainly are not.”

Then Sydney walked out the door, carrying two cups of coffee.  One was for her, and the other was for Jim.  Sydney asked him, “Jim, did I get your coffee the way you like it?”

Jim answered, “If you put sugar in it, then yes.”

Jim took a sip.  Sure enough, there was sugar in it.  Jim always liked his coffee black with sugar.  Occasionally, Jim would take cream in his coffee, whether it be Cremora or Coffee-Mate or a pumpkin spice cream in the fall, just like this time of year.  Chelsea walked behind Sydney.  Chelsea asked April Lynn, Malachi and Stacy if they wanted a cup of coffee.  Malachi and Stacy said they were good.  April Lynn put up her bottle of Pepsi and said, “Thanks, Chelsea.  But I got my bottle of Pepsi.”

Then Malachi asked, “Sydney, you want to talk about it?”

Sydney did not say a word.  She just looked at everyone, and then she turned around and walked back into the house.  Malachi said, “I take it she doesn’t.”

April Lynn said, “Yes, I guess that’s pretty obvious.”

Jim said, “I guess she’ll tell you all about it when she’s ready.”

Then, they heard the blast of a horn.  It was coming from a classic Ford Bronco, small and orange in color, with a white top and white stripes on the sides and on the hood, and a spare tire attached to the back, covered with a white wheel cover.  It stopped in front of the Faulkner house.  There were three people in the Bronco.  Jonah and Catalina (known as Cat), the Marlowe twins.  And seated in the back, Allison Marlowe.  All three got out of the Bronco.  Jim asked, “What in the world is that?”

Allison answered, “This is the car we’re going to enter in the car show.”

Then Jonah said, “Allison, let me tell them about the car.”

Allison said, “Okay, Jonah.  Tell them.”

Jonah said, “What you see is a 1976 Ford Bronco Explorer.  It has a 302 cubic inch V-8 engine, a three-speed manual transmission, and I put in an AM/FM radio with a CD player.”

Then Cat asked, “Neat, huh?”

Jim said, “Yes.  I’d say so.”

Then Malachi asked Cat and Allison, “Did you two help your brother with that Bronco?”

Cat said, “I did.  And I enjoyed it.”

Then Allison said, “I didn’t.  But Jonathan did.”

Jim asked, “Allison, how come you didn’t help with the Bronco?”

Allison answered, “I guess I just wasn’t all that interested.  Maybe cars just aren’t my thing.”

Then Malachi asked, “Did Zoe help with the Bronco?”

Allison answered, “Some.  But she did enjoy it.”

“Allison, you are coming to the car show, aren’t you?” April Lynn asked.

Allison answered, “Yes, April Lynn.  I wouldn’t miss it for the world.”

Then Malachi said, “You all, I guess we best be getting on home and getting ready.”

Stacy looked at her watch and said, “Yes, we best get on home.  I know Jim and his bunch will be needing to get ready.”

April Lynn, Malachi and Stacy got up and walked to where Jim, Allison and the Marlowe twins were standing.  April Lynn said, “Jim, we’re leaving for home.  But we will see you at the car show, no doubt.”

“Yes, April Lynn.  I’ll see you all at the car show.”

April Lynn, Malachi and Stacy left.  Allison, Jonah and Cat stayed for a few more minutes.  Jim asked them if they wanted a cup of coffee, but Allison said, “No thanks, Jim.  We’ll need to get on to the car show in just a bit.”

Right then, Jim saw Simon walk out of his house to get his morning newspaper.  Simon was still in his robe and pajamas.  Simon walked to where everyone was.  As soon as he got there, Simon asked, “Jonah, what is this?”

Jonah answered, “It’s a 1976 Ford Bronco Explorer.  My sisters and I are going to enter it at the car show.”

Simon said, “It looks pretty good.  Would it be okay if I got a look under the hood?”

Jonah said, “Sure.  I’ll pop the hood open.”

Simon and Jonah walked to the Bronco.  Jim walked right behind them.  Jonah popped open the hood, and Simon opened it.  Simon got a look at the engine.  He gave out a whistle, and he said, “Wow, Jonah!  Looks sharp.”

Jonah said, “It’s a 302 cubic inch V-8.  Runs good.”

Simon said, “I’ll say it does.  I’ll bet this thing has some scat to it, doesn’t it?”

“You bet, Simon.  This bad boy will do zero to fifty-five in less than ten seconds.”

Simon asked, “What kind of transmission is in this thing?”

Jonah answered, “A three-speed manual.”

Simon said, “That’s good.  With something this small, a three-speed is really all you need.”

Jonah said, “A three-speed is all I wanted.”

While the guys were checking out the Bronco, Cat was having a good time changing the gears.  Allison was sitting in the passenger seat beside her.  Jim said, “Catalina Marlowe.  Stop fooling with the gears!”

Then Simon asked, “How about your sound system?”

Jonah said, “This thing did have an old AM radio.  But I replaced it with an AM/FM car stereo.  I also put in speakers both in the front and rear.”

“What brand?” Simon asked.

Jonah answered, “Pioneer.  The best in the business.”

Simon put his arm around Jonah, and he said to him, “Jonah, my man.  I am proud of you.  Pioneer is a good brand.  You made a good choice.”

“Thanks, Simon.  I feel the same way.  I made a good choice.”

Cat was still changing the gears.  Now Allison was in on it.  But Jonah had about enough of it.  Jonah shouted, “Okay, girls!  Quit switching cogs!”

Cat and Allison finally stopped and got out of the Bronco.  Then Jim said, “Jonah, you’re gonna have to take us for a ride in it sometime.”

Jonah said, “You bet, Jim.  I’ll be happy to.”

Then Cat looked at her watch and said, “Jonah and Allison, I hate to cut this visit short, but we best be getting home and getting ready for the car show.”

Jonah looked at his watch, and he said, “Yes, Cat.  You’re right.  We best get going so we can get a good spot.”

Then Allison asked, “Simon, will we be seeing you and your wife and son at the car show?”

Simon answered, “No, Allison.  I’m afraid not.  As you know, Ariel is on bed rest.  But Nelson will be there.  He’ll be riding with Mom and Alex.”

Jonah said, “That’ll be good, Simon.  But we will miss you and your wife.  You just do what the doctor says.”

Simon said, “Thanks.  I’ll be thinking of you all having fun at the car show.”

Jonah, Cat and Allison got in the Bronco, and they left for their house.  Then Simon went back to his house.  Meanwhile, Jim and his daughters got ready for the car show.  Jim made him another cup of coffee.  Valerie and Caitlyn walked into the kitchen.  They were both wearing T-shirts and jeans.  Jim asked them, “Are your sisters still getting ready?”

Valerie answered, “They are still upstairs.  Chelsea’s almost ready.  Lauren’s trying to get into the bathroom.  She said Lindsay’s taking a long time getting ready.  I guess she wants to look pretty for Ryan.”

Then, there was a scream from upstairs.  It was from Lindsay.  “I am almost ready!  I want to look my best, all right!”

Jim quickly walked upstairs.  He saw Lauren waiting outside the bathroom door.  Jim asked Lauren, “What in the name of peace and goodness is going on?”

Lauren answered, “Lindsay’s been in there a while.  She says she wants to look her best.”

Jim said, “I guess there’s nothing wrong with that.  But we do need to get ready because the car show does start soon.”

Lauren said, “I know that, Dad.  But I do need to get in the bathroom and get ready.  Lindsay could be…”

Before Lauren could finish what she was trying to say, Lindsay opened the bathroom door.  Lindsay said, “Lauren, you know I have to look my best.  After all, Ryan is going to be at the car show.”

Lindsay was wearing a white shirt with a silk scarf around her neck and a black skirt.  She looked pretty, all right.  Jim said, “Lindsay, you do look pretty.  I know Ryan will be impressed.”

“Thanks, Dad.  I sure hope so.”

Then Lauren asked, “Lindsay, are you wearing perfume by any chance?”

Lindsay answered, “Yes, I am.  But I didn’t overdo it.  It’s just a little bit.”

Jim said, “Lauren, I guess she is growing up.”

Then Lauren got a look at Lindsay and said, “Sis, your legs look a little rough.  I do hope you are planning on wearing pantyhose because they’ll make your legs look better.”

“Yes, I am, Lauren.  Suntan, in fact.”

Fifteen minutes later, Jim and Lauren were back in the kitchen.  They both had a doughnut and a can of Coke.  Not long after, Lindsay stepped into the kitchen.  Thanks to the suntan pantyhose (as Lauren suggested), Lindsay’s legs looked more attractive.  Lindsay was also wearing black high-heeled shoes and hoop earrings.  They looked pretty on the twelve-year-old girl.  Jim said to her, “Lindsay, you do look pretty.  I know Ryan will be impressed.”

Lindsay said, “Thank you, Dad.  I hope so.”

Then, Valerie and Caitlyn walked into the kitchen.  Caitlyn said, “Lindsay, you sure do look pretty.”

“Thank you, Caitlyn.”

“Any reason why you are dressed up?” Valerie asked Lindsay.

Lindsay answered, “I like dressing up.  I do have a boyfriend, you know.”

Valerie made a face, and she said, “Boyfriends!  Yuck!”

Then Jim said, “Now hold on.  Lindsay is twelve years old.  As far as I’m concerned, I feel she is entitled to a boyfriend.  And Valerie and Caitlyn, the time will come when you two will have a boyfriend.”

Lauren added, “And I promise you two this.  Having a boyfriend can be a very special thing.  He will do things for you, like hold a door open for you, hold your hand, and when you are older, he will take you out on dates.”

Right then, Sydney and Chelsea walked into the kitchen.  They must have heard what was being said.  Sydney said, “In the meantime, don’t rush into anything.”

Valerie said, “Don’t worry.  I won’t.”

Then Chelsea said, “And Lindsay, you are only twelve.  This is no time to make wedding plans, or even planning names for your children.”

“Wedding plans?  Children?  What’s this all about?” Jim asked.

Chelsea said, “Dad, I found a wedding magazine on Lindsay’s bed a few days ago.  She marked one page.  It said, ‘My wedding dress.’”

“Really?” Jim asked.

Then Chelsea said, “Not only that, there was a small sheet of paper in that magazine.  It listed names for her children.”

Lindsay suddenly became upset.  She said, “Chelsea Lynn Faulkner!  I don’t think there’s anything wrong with planning my own wedding.  You should have not looked at that magazine.  That was none of your business.”

Jim said, “Lindsay Michelle Faulkner.  Don’t talk to your sister like that.  Or any one of us for that matter.”

Lindsay gave Chelsea a somber look.  Then she said, “I’m sorry, Chelsea.  And Dad, wasn’t it you who said it’s never too early to plan for your future?”

Jim answered, “I did say that.  It was also me who said the future is coming whether we want it or not.”

Then Chelsea brought up something else.  “I found something else on Lindsay’s bed.  A surfing magazine.”

Lindsay said, “I can explain both magazines.  Ryan got them for me about a couple weeks ago.  I guess he wants to plan our wedding as much as I want to.”

“And the surfing magazine?” Lauren asked.

Lindsay answered, “I guess he wants to plan our honeymoon as well.  He says after our wedding, he wants us to go to California.  He wants us to go surfing in the ocean near Los Angeles.”

That got a laugh out of everyone.  Jim asked, “Couldn’t Ryan look up some surfing opportunities in either North Carolina or South Carolina?”

Lindsay answered, “I asked him.  But he said the Pacific Ocean is the best for surfing.  He also said he’s saving up to get him a classic Volkswagen Van because he says it’s his dream vehicle.  He also said he can drive us all the way to Los Angeles.”

Sydney said, “Good Lord, Lindsay.  It’s going to take Ryan at least four days to drive all the way from Charlotte to Los Angeles.”

Jim put his hand, and he said, “Okay, girls.  Lindsay, I will say it again.  You are only twelve years old.  You have plenty of time.  But right now, let’s focus on now.  We got a car show to go to.”

Then Sydney said, “Yes.  I’m going to go to Mom’s house and get my Camaro.”

Jim said, “Okay, Sydney.  We’ll see you at the car show.”

“Who’s riding with me?” Sydney asked.

Valerie said, “Me and Caitlyn will.”

Then Lindsay asked, “Sydney, is it okay if I ride with you?”

Sydney answered, “Sure.  Let’s head for Mom’s house.”

Then Jim said, “Okay.  I guess that leaves me and my two oldest girls.  Let’s get going.  I’ll get my Impala out of the garage.”

Jim backed his Impala out of the garage.  By the time he backed onto Bethany Street, his three oldest girls were out of the house.  Chelsea was the one who locked the house.  The two girls got in, with Lauren agreeing to ride shotgun.  It took Jim about ten minutes to get to Dilworth Elementary School.  The car show was to be held in the parking lot.  When Jim got there, the concession trailer was already set up, as was the stage.  Some cars were already in place.  It looked like this car show was about to be another success.",0,1728506423.0,writers,1,0.33,False
1g01hzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1g01hzn/i_got_sample_hauls_which_means_a_ramble_and/,"I got sample hauls, which means a ramble and reviews! (BPAL / Hexennacht / Nui Cobalt / Poesie / Sorcellerie / Black Hearted / Osmofolia)","Hello everyone!! This is my first proper post here 😻

So I just wanted to start off with a little ramble about how I got into this sub - I jumped headfirst back into this hyper-fixation whilst looking for Christmas presents for my siblings. They both love interesting fragrances, and my sister especially is huge into the whole witchy/punk vibe. Lovesick Witchery came up on my radar, and I got absorbed into looking through their catalogue. I ended up grabbing a bunch for myself too! Naturally, it led me here looking up reviews, and I got absolutely enamoured with the whole subreddit!!

I'm not too much of a stranger with more niche perfumes - My signature fragrances are from Lush (Vanillary, American Cream, Tender is the Night massage bar) I've bought from some indie/etsy shops, and I was obsessed with the Solid Perfumes and soaps from [ContactCaffiene](https://www.contactcaffeine.com/) (a furry oriented shop that specialises in caffeinated soaps but offers scent sticks and wax melts of the fragrances) for years when they shipped to the UK! Last year I dipped my toes in again with 4160 Tuesdays and found another few scents I adore (Dark Queen and The Orange Tree).

But finding this subreddit, spending hours reading through stuff has just brought me so much joy and reinvigorated my love for it all. I love sniffing interesting things, and expressing myself through scent!! I adore the atmospheric and memory oriented descriptions and names, it's all interactive art to me and I adore it!

I have my aforementioned order from Lovesick Witchery on the way, and I've also ordered from SimonsNest and Solstice Scents! I plan on creating separate review posts for each of those houses, but whilst I've been waiting with my nose pressed to the window, I grabbed some samples from some wonderful users in the Sunday Swap posts! :D

Please also note that these are all my own thoughts!! I can get headaches easily with some heady scents, and it does effect my review, but of course you yourself may adore it :D

I am also not the best at picking out individual notes, so these are all sniffies from an excited newbie 💙

I will be rating 1-5 stars and this is what they generally mean!

* ⭐- *Wouldn't wear personally. Notes I personally don't like, or too strong and gave me a headache.*
* ⭐⭐- *I can appreciate this one, but probably doesn't suit me personally. May have given me a headache.*
* ⭐⭐⭐- *May wear for specific things. Interesting, but may not wear it out. I appreciate what it was attempting.*
* ⭐⭐⭐⭐- *I really like this one! It may not project as much as I like or last very long on me. I may not wear it as a signature, but I really dig it.*
* ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐- *WOW, I love this, I want to buy more! Would wear it out and regularly. Will add to my main rotation for sure.*
* 💫 - *Just means half a star, since there isn't an emoji for it*

So let's GOOOO!

* Lavender Honey Cake 🍯💜

>*Every crumb sticks to the fork: a dense, lightly-spiced cake glazed in raw honey gathered from bees who thrive on lavender nectar.*

Starts off as a really lovely sweet cakey lavender, and quickly dries down into a floraly honey, but I cant pick out the lavender anymore. Only lasted about 3 hours on my skin. Nice but not sure it's my thing, but I'm intrigued and will try again!

⭐⭐⭐

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

* Mouse 🐭🌾

>*Golden hay, vanilla bean, toasted amber, hazelnuts, white carnation petals, and cream.*

I really wanted to like this one as my fursona whose really near and dear to me is a mouse, but sadly I just get a heady sweet/caramelly amber that's not my thing, and it doesn't seem to evolve too much on the dry down. I think I'm finding out that strong amber notes are just not for me, but if it's there lightly it's okay.

⭐⭐

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

* New Orleans 💐

>*Reminiscent of hothouse blooms on a humid night, ripe, but touched with decay. Sweet honeysuckle and jasmine with a hint of lemon and spice.*

A very strong floral jasmine right off the bat. Almost headache inducing. Not a huge fan but I keep sniffing my wrist?? Hmm.... interesting. It settles into a much lighter jasmine, but I'm not getting the other notes. Maybe an incling of honeysuckle? I love jasmine but this one's a little much for the first hour, so I can't see myself wearing it. Adding half a star for the dry down!

⭐⭐💫

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

* Embalming Fluid 🧪

>*A light, pure scent: white musk, green tea, aloe and lemon.*

I got this one as a lil freebie! From the first sniff I get very strong, clean soap. Almost citrusy, a little floraly!

It's like I've gone shoved my face right up to a fancy soap from a gift shop and sniffed, but the other notes aren't clear to me.

Later on it's still very soapy, calmed down to very light, some of the tea and lemon is coming through, but still definite soap. It's not for me, but I can see why people would love it!  Definitely enjoyed it more on the dry down. Might try at night. EDIT: I tried at night, its a really nice after-shower scent! I don't think I'd wear it out, but it makes you feel extra clean. It was a long time ago, but it smells almost identical in my memory to [ContactCaffiene's Lucky Fox soap](https://www.contactcaffeine.com/product/soap-lucky-fox)!

⭐⭐⭐

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

* Thanatopsis ⚰

>*A meditation upon death. Inspired by William Cullen Bryant’s poem. A deep, solomn earthen scent containing pine, juniper and musk.*

Another lil freebie! Off the bat I get some musky, incensy lime. I'm kind of digging this?? I looked the notes and there's no lime, but pine, which makes sense. It doesn't smell cleaning-producty or citrusy but like a very chill pine incense. Drying down into a very sweet, powdery pine, almost like pine baby powder but less baby-y, lol. It's uni-sex leaning masc and not overly sweet  but comforting.

EDIT: It's been a couple days of using this on and off and I am in love with it. I love to wear it to bed and around the house. I'm only knocking half a star off because it only lasts a couple of hours!

* Just Because 🧡☕

>*Scent Description: creamy orange blossom, caramel woods, a splash of black tea*

Right away I'm getting a strong patchouli note which is giving me a headache, so I'm a bit surprised that no patchouli is listed in the notes! I'm not smelling orange or tea, but maybe some florals which is what the orange blossom is? It does give me the retail perfume vibe, and it's not suiting me too well, sadly. Doesn't seem to change too much for me on the dry down, but remains quite strong. Maybe one to give to mum!  


⭐

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

* Spellbound & Snug 🔥✨

>*Notes: fizzy cream soda, butterscotch ribbons, marshmallow whipped cream, rosewood desks and squashy armchairs, a cheerful fire*

I was so surprised from this one. I get the leather notes right off the bat and I LOVE it?? I am learning that leather is gooood. I should have known i'd like it in perfumes from when we used to have a proper leather sofa and I babied it a lot with leather cleaner and added scent, LOL.  
  
Despite the notes, it's definitely not gourmand. The butterscotch isn't overly sweet at all, and the leather note really really shines through and reigns it in from being too cloying! It's not an overly masculine leather, but a very, very cosy one, like you really are melting into a huge comfy leather armchair with a vanilla/butterscotch diffuser on somewhere in the room. Love it, cosy to the max!

Will definitely wear this in my usual rotation!! I'm tempted to knock half a star off because it's only strong for an hour or two before fading into a lovely vanillary leather, but I really do adore it, so it gets to keep it's star. Magical. 😸

* We're All Mad Here 🐈🍇

>*Notes: boysenberry, black peppercorn essential oil, swirls of vanilla buttercream frosting, soft fur musk, smoked tonka bean*

The berry notes for this are quite bright despite the fur musk note! This very much reminds me of a lighter and less complex version of Dark Queen by 4160 Tuesdays. Wheras We're all Mad here is a light-hearted purple cat nibbling summer fruits with frosted cake, Dark Queen is a darker, more serious and sensual wild cat grazing on thorn-berries. It's definitely not a bad smell, I think I need to spend more time with it again! Out of the two I'd definitely pick DQ as a going out kinda scent, but both are still unique in their own way.

* Chill Ghost 👻🍞

>*Notes: a loaf of warm bread just pulled from the oven, clean cotton sheets, marshmallow*

This one was a freebie, thank you! Chill Ghost is very warmly sweet just like bread. I can definitely feel what they were trying to do but sadly the musk note hit me a little too hard and stuck in my nose cloyingly which gave me a headache. We cry!

* Alexandrite ❤

> *incense, blackberry, raspberry, blueberry, plum, strawberry, dark patchouli, oudh.*

Very Patchouli forward at the start. It's a very pretty scent and I can smell some complexity in it, but unfortunately becomes too strong for me for a while! After a couple hours it's lovely and calmer. No silage but I enjoy sniffing my wrist when it calmed down and it's lasted a long time.

* Smaug 🐉🥇

>*dragon’s blood, smoked vanilla, fire-red musk, aged dark patchouli.*

Funnily, I had this one left to try on my wedding anniversary, where we were planning on chilling and watching The Hobbit move 3! :D This one is very strong, as a dragon would be, and interestingly, smells strangely just like bubblegum + incense in the bottle. Despite that, it dries down quickly to be a comforting hippy shop smell. Surprisingly sweet, just very strong so I will only just be using a tiny little bit at a time to avoid headaches.

* Exsanguinated 🧛‍♂️

> *Mulled wine infused with blood orange, pomegranate, and cherry, smoldering dragon's blood resin, and a velvet-lined mahogany coffin strewn with red roses.*

I loved the imagery that this one invoked, so I was really hoping I'd love it. However, it's very strong and a little soapy on me which gave me a big headache. It's both fruity and incency. I can definitely pick out the white wine with a hint of rose, but it's not a light smell. Sadly just didn't work on me.

* Swindle: Frosted Lemon Cake 🍰🍋

> *Tangy-sweet lemon pound cake with vanilla royal icing.*

Immediately sweet and buttery, there's a mouth watering hint of lemon and you can absolutely smell the sweet drizzled icing. - Very strong cake! This is nice smelling but not sure if I want to smell like I've literally rubbed a sweet lemon cake over my body? But maybe I DO.....? I'm actually kinda gobsmacked at how accurate the notes were, rather than just being a concept, lol! Will try again and see how it dries down, but for now:

* Nag Champa 🌀

> *A single note that lies somewhere between the oil and the incense. Mysore sandalwood, white champaca flowers, Himalayan cedar wood, Indian frankincense, and smoky incense sticks.*

Wow I was expecting an incense punch in the face but it's surprisingly light! Less hippie shop and more a 'grown-up' nag champa blend, and quite like a retail fancy perfume. I like it, but I don't think it's my thing. Actually, I think my mum would love this.

>*Notes:  Dark, salted vanilla, buttercream, a swirl of honey, and a whisper of jasmine*

From the bottle, it's very sweet, caramelly and comforting. I almost get something a bit boozy but it disappears when I put it on. It's a nice caramel, maybe leaning a little artificial, like a cheap coffee syrup, but it's definitely not a bad smell and I don't find it cloying. I can definitely pick out the honey too, but no jasmine sadly! Not sure I'd wear this one much but it's very pleasant.

Wow, very sweet, very PINK! Almost smelt like Turkish Delights, with a candy-like rose and is reminiscent of a body spray aimed at young teen girls. It's definitely reminiscent of a school girls perfume, which makes sense! This one didn't last too long on me, and I'm not sure it's for me, but I appreciated the nostalgia - may be fun to wear out but would have to re-apply!

**What we learned, and what we already knew**  
  
And that's all we have for now, sample wise - I hope you enjoyed my silly little sniffie thoughts, and I'm SUPER excited to get my other samples in!!  
I really want to get my hub's opinions on the next ones I try to include (though it's usually ""hmm this smells like old-lady"" kind of thoughts. 😂  
He's said I've become a wine-taster of perfumes (with endearment) but I one day I'll get an ""MMM"" out of him for sure! 🤣

What I've learned is that I am probably way pickier with gourmands than I thought, or haven't found the right house other than my usual's yet! (I'm still addicted to Lush Vanillary, after all) I also really like sweet powdery and leathery-ness, as well as woodsy but not overpowering scents!

What I already knew was that I love orange-y scents, and am forever hunting for an Orange/Vanilla Creamsicle smell - they just don't do ANYTHING orange-vanilla related in the UK and I'm forever sad about it!! 😭 I've tried layering Vanillary and The Orange Tree together but it doesn't quite hit the way I want it too.

I'm also searching for a dupe for the Tender is the Night massage bar from Lush (Jasmine/Vanilla/Ylang Ylang)! Specifically the massage bar (That they discontinued it... :c), because it has that powdery-sweetness, and is very vanilla/jasmine forward, however the EDP and lotion they made as a LE are WAY too floral forward for me. Forever searching for good Jasmine/Vanillas...

If you have any recommendations, I'm all ears, and hope you have a wonderful day - keep on sniffin'! :3

### Devotional: Love in Every Moment: Cultivating Time for Your Marriage

**Scripture Reflection:**

*“And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.”* — 1 Corinthians 13:13 (NIV)

**Devotional Thought:**

In the busyness of life, it’s easy to forget the essence of love in our marriages. Most of us prioritize work, kids, and our various commitments, often pushing our relationship with our spouse to the back burner. Yet, love is a conscious decision, an action that requires cultivation, time, and intention.

Every moment we spend nurturing our marriage is like watering a precious garden. When we invest time in our relationship, we create an environment where love can grow, bloom, and bear fruit. This doesn’t necessarily mean grand gestures; it can be found in the ordinary moments—sharing a cup of coffee, taking a walk together, laughing at a shared memory, or simply listening to each other.

Take a moment today to pause. Reflect on the everyday moments you can cherish with your spouse. What small acts can you incorporate into your routine that will remind you both of your love? Perhaps it’s leaving a sweet note, texting a loving message during the day, or simply setting aside time after dinner to talk without distractions.

**Prayer:**

Heavenly Father, thank You for the gift of love within marriage. Help us to cultivate love in every moment, recognizing that even the smallest acts reflect our commitment to each other. Teach us to prioritize our relationship amid life’s busyness and to find joy in the simple moments we share. May our love for each other be a testament of Your love for us. In Jesus’ name, Amen.

**Action Step:**

Choose one small way to express love to your spouse today. This could be a heartfelt compliment, a surprise favor, or dedicating uninterrupted time together. Celebrate the moments and watch how they strengthen your connection, one loving interaction at a time.

**Reflection:**

At the end of the day, take a moment to reflect on how this act of love impacted both you and your spouse. How did it make you feel? How did it contribute to your overall marital bond? Let this be a reminder of the significance of love in your everyday life.

### Conclusion:

Love is not just a feeling; it’s a commitment we live out in our daily interactions. By consciously choosing to cultivate love in every moment, we strengthen the ties that bind us. Let’s embrace the routine, the mundane, and the beautifully ordinary, knowing that these moments accumulate to create a lasting legacy of love in our marriage.

But this time I wasn't invited. I called and asked one of them (A) and said they it's late and didn't want to go for one. I went for the coffee break anyways and had told one other person (B) that goes with us that I was going alone since everyone was busy.

As I am having my coffee I got a call from (B) that both (A) and (C) are on this side of the building might as well finish my coffee together with them. I go to that side of the building and find them chilling without (B) and asked if they were gonna join us. (A) said yes but (B) never joined us.

At the time of logging out and heading home I asked (A) why didn't he ask me to go for a break as well if you both (A) and (C) were going together.
He replied saying I was about to go back to the up and told (C) you can hangout with me for the rest of the break but as he was about to call me I showed up. 


I realized I was just lied to, and I don't know how I should confront this. Am I jealous that they didn't include me with them or am I just being childish about it and should just ignore it even though this is not the first time this has happened.",1,1728506054.0,Adulting,0,1.0,False

1g01d0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD_partners/comments/1g01d0g/marriage_to_someone_with_adhd_a_success_story/,Marriage to someone with ADHD: A Success Story,"I posted this on a different thread earlier and seeing a success story seemed to resonate with a lot of people. Someone asked me to create its own post for it, so here you go (with extra details for context/compiled from other posts).

General Info: I (32F) and my husband (32M, dx) have been together for 11 years, married for 8. We do not have kids.

I am a very ""I need to know our schedule and have a structured routine"" kind of person. I like quality time and generally don't have many hobbies outside of reading, random artistic pursuits, and spending time with friends and family. My husband is very independent, has a never-ending list of things he wants to do, hates being interrupted, and generally doesn't like pre-planned schedules. I am sensitive to the way things are worded or emphasized when spoken, and he is a very ""short and to the point"" answer type of guy. As you may be able to guess, our first few years of marriage were *hard* because we didn't realize our differences were so stark until we were living under the same roof.

There are many ways to make life with an ADHD partner easier, but it also **requires** ***both*** **partners to be committed to the effort**. It requires the desire to **choose your words wisely and maintain respect** for the other person even when things get hard. We are not the type to yell, name-call, or threaten divorce. Those go beyond ""ADHD"" problems and more into ""you're not the respectful type of partner I want to live with"" territory and if those boundaries cannot be respected or are not actively worked to be changed, then I don't think the relationship will be a happy or successful one regardless of the changes below. 

It might sound like things are great, and they are...now. It took many years of discontent, resentment, and almost throwing in the towel to get to this place. We made significant lifestyle changes, which is why I say that ***both*** **partners are critical for this success**. It takes trust, patience, and optimism. Each time the structure/system falls apart, you both have to give grace. Accept that it happened and just get right back up on the horse. The ""downtime"" gets easier and faster each time and it helps to allow yourselves to recognize that. 

With that said, here are some things we learned and implemented throughout our journey:

1. **Create a home that makes you happy** We moved to a new home and area of our city that felt significantly less soul-sucking than where we were. We both felt suffocated and bored by the very suburban area that we lived in, which added to our overall feelings of discontent. We moved into a more energized area of our city and we both feel significantly ""lighter"". We have very minimal decor, lots of storage and white painted walls to avoid physical and mental ""clutter"". Our new home has sunlight come through the windows and even windows that can actually open. We are both energized by the outdoors.
2. **My husband changed jobs** so that he could work remotely and have a bit more of a flexible schedule. He had originally been working full time on top of grad school so graduating helped, but not as significantly as we expected, which was interesting. I think he was super burned out at his job and leaving it was the biggest help of all. Side note: in general, people with ADHD do much better in careers that allow for frequent task switching or physical movement to keep from getting bored/losing focus. My husband is a software developer, which is a challenge. The remote work and flexible schedule were game changers for him because he no longer felt like he had a manager breathing down his neck.
3. **My husband stopped taking his meds** (Adzenys) because they were making his anxiety go through the roof. He wasn't eating or sleeping properly when on them. Now, he takes them only when he knows it's extra needed for work. The impact of the meds now isn't nearly as bad as it used to be, which has me thinking that his burnout and anxiety from work/school were the main reasons they were so problematic initially.
4. **Clear delineation of chores for both partners**. You CANNOT touch the other person's area unless they ask for help. Do not offer. Do not quickly/quietly help behind the scenes. Just let them figure it out. An ADHD person will create a plan in their head and it's fragile. If you interrupt the plan, it's like it never existed and they won't restart it until you likely argue about it again. You're only hurting yourself if you interrupt. I handle anything related to the dog and laundry and all lunches. He handles anything related to the cat and dinners. We split yard work and household chores as needed, usually on weekends. One of us (usually me) will make the list and we'll split the tasks and pick a day/time to tackle them at the same time. We try to make it fun by grabbing a coffee at our local cafe before heading home to tackle them for a few hours with party music in the background to keep our energy up. If one of us starts to feel tired, we don't try to keep that person going. We've learned that trying to ""push through to the end"" causes a fight, so we just stop and come back to it later. If I don't want to stop, I can keep going but I am not allowed to be upset by doing the rest alone.
5. **Clearly defined finances**. All money goes into the same account. We have multiple savings accounts that get money auto-drafted into them. Travel. Emergency. Car. Home improvement. Any purchases that come from the joint account only need to be run by the other person for awareness / approval if over $150. We don't do this anymore, but when we first got married, we set up an allowance system to help us learn each other's spending habits and therefore learn how to trust. We each had our own checking account that was auto-filled with an allowance each month. It's for any ""fun"" spending that you don't want to run by the other person (gifts, meals with friends, concert tickets, art supplies, shopping spree, etc).
6. To make ADHD-life easier, found ways to **lower the ""barrier of entry"" to less desirable task**s. We have cleaning supplies and in every bathroom (especially Clorox wipes). We have a lightweight Dyson Animal V6 vacuum for quick and easy cleaning (FB marketplace always has some listed). We have Alexa with Smart Lights to start dimming at 8pm to signal that it's time to ""wind down"" and they slowly dim on in the AM to help with wake up. We also have a smart thermostat to adjust temperature at ideal times for sleeping and waking up. We have a Litter Robot to make scooping less frequent and weekly clean out easier (FB marketplace). We have HelloFresh delivery to reduce grocery shopping and cooking effort/brainpower. We go to Costco for bulk supplies to also reduce shopping. We have Amazon Prime for quick and easy delivery. We have a shared Google calendar that we both put Events into so we're always in the loop. We have a Slack account with channels for To Do, Travel, House, Random, and Work related topics. We can dump thoughts there throughout the day to avoid feeling overwhelmed or overwhelming the other. We go to the gym together every morning because the gym helps ""settle"" the brain and going together helps with consistency. My husband also drinks coffee after the gym for additional ""settling"" and will sometimes take an Ashwagandha pill if he knows there is something stressful coming up that day. We go to bed together and make sure we get 8hrs of sleep. He uses an eye mask which helps prevent him from waking up a lot or waking up too early from racing thoughts.
7. For resentment and communication, we learned a ton from our **Gottman-trained couples counselor**. We have a **""check in"" date every Sunday AM** where we walk ourselves to our local cafe and go through our check-in topics. (3-5 things you appreciate about the other person and why, at least 1 thing that's going well as a couple, discuss any unresolved issues from the previous week, share what we need to feel more loved and supported in the coming week, plan for upcoming activities in the week ahead). 6 second kiss every morning before work. 20 second hug every evening after work.

Hi! I just was wondering if anyone had any theories on this dating experience i had. I’m just struggling to wrap my head around what happened and I’m feeling down. 

I’m a female, 26, and the guy was also 26.

I met a guy on a dating app and we hit it off. We went on a first date and then a second. On the second date, he was saying things like, “I can’t believe we have so much in common,” and “I’ve never felt this attracted to someone after a first date.” We really did seem to align in terms of values, etc, so I was feeling good.

On the third date we went out for drinks and then we slept together. He even asked me to spend the night and I did. A few days went by before I heard from him but I asked if he had still wanted to get together the next weekend. He said yes, and apologized for being busy and not reaching out sooner. He said he was really excited to see me. The fourth date, we played tennis, got coffee and then watched a movie at my place. We hooked up again. Then, he left a little later and agreed we should do something again the following weekend. He texted me when he got home. Then days went by, and I hadn’t heard from him. I was a little nervous there was a shift compared to before but I tried not to worry. I waited about 5 days and then texted him and asked if he was still interested in doing something the following weekend. The next day he responded and basically said that he enjoyed getting to know me but was looking for something longterm and didn’t feel the romantic connection that he was looking for. I responded nicely and then it appears he blocked me. 

I guess I’m just feeling a little down. I felt like there was a good connection and I feel slightly used. It also just makes me worry he only felt a sexual connection or something. And I was surprised given the things he was saying about us having stuff in common, etc, that I guess I don’t understand the lack of “romantic connection.” I don’t regret hooking up, but I guess I just wish he could’ve recognized this feeling before we did it twice. I also don’t get why he blocked me, since it ended pretty cordially. I didn’t try to argue or anything. Just was wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar or not. I just feel confused and a little dumb. I don’t understand what changed.  ",2,1728505804.0,Bumble,3,1.0,False
1g01bjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1g01bjx/what_is_the_decongestant_in_generic_adderall/,What is the decongestant in generic Adderall? ,"TL;DR: took 10mg generic Adderall XR by Burrell Pharm for the first time in months and 20 min later I felt a “Sudafed-like” decongestant action. 

Story:
I’ve been having a sinus headache for a few days now causing symptoms bad enough for me to finally want to reach for medication. I’ve also been feeling hungover… without drinking. I read that Sudafed isn’t the best decongestant to take with Adderall either, but I have yet to speak to a pharmacist. So I sent my hubby to the store to get some Afrin while I stayed home with the kiddo. 

I also had recently heard a podcast about women with PMDD, PPD and/or in perimenopause who have been tested successfully in taking an increased dose during a specific phase of their menstrual cycle to function better. I’ll post the link to the podcast in comments. 

Background: I’ve been taking brand name Adderall for a couple months now and I think I’ve found a sweet spot at 40mg XR, still trialing tho. Doc has me on bupropion 150mg XR as well. 

I have a couple 10mg of the generic left over from when I was beginning my trialing. Being that I’m about a week out from when I should be expecting my cycle to start and I have been feeling this hangover-like sx for a couple days, I thought I would give the podcast Dr’s findings a try on myself.  I took 1 separately from my normal meds, about 3 hours later. It was  about an hour after breakfast and coffee, and it was taken with water. 

20 minutes after I took it I started to feel similar sinus clearing effects as I do when I had taken Sudafed in the past. This happened while hubby was still at the store grabbing the nasal spray for me. 

I’m curious as to what ingredient is in the generic - that the brand name does not have - that is a decongestant. A simple google search isn’t helpful at all. ",4,1728505802.0,ADHD,16,0.67,False

So although my scale says 20g, it could really mean 20.9g, and for fairness let’s say the 300g of water is really 300.9g. That’s a ratio of 1:14.4!

Until I get a more precise scale, I’ve been diluting my doses to correct for this range of error. But that’s only bc I prefer light body to heavy body. Another way to correct for this is to add beans until you juuuust hit your target. ",1,1728505764.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

Even got told I don't need scans as my headaches have been happening for years and its not the first time. Dismissed by a GP saying i couldnt have CH cause I'm not an old man. I really don't want to be dismissed and need the neurologist to understand. 

I had the odd headache from 17 to 21 then 21 is when clusters started and got told by a GP it was migraines and thought for years it was migraines. 

After years of having them I understand them more. My clusters last 4-6 weeks, 1-4 times a day. Hot, sharp burning pain in my right eye (feels like a knife on fire being twisted in my eye). Same times every day and waking me up during the night. Very easily triggered in a cluster by: being too hot, too tired, alcohol, change in routine, etc. I can not sit still or lie down...pacing about crying in pain wanting it to stop...one thing I'm not sure about is if my eyes droop, water and/or nose runs...I'm just too distressed and crying during CH. I use coffee and icepacks to help. Pain medications don't work and everything the GP has given me hasnt worked. Outside clusters I get shadows.

How do I go about the appointment knowing I will most likely I won't be in a cluster? What if the neurologist doesn't believe me? What if they've never known someone with CH? Is there somethings I should say? Any advice?

Random but my mum has had a brain tumour for years (non cancerous)...should I mention that? 

'Mirgrains' have known to be in some family members.

My main goal is to get an official diagnosis so I know I'm not crazy. I'd like to have it on record for GPs to see and for work. You never know when your might need it!

Side note: I did micro doses of magic mushrooms a few times over summer (for fun lol) and I'm not sure if that will keep CH away for a while...also don't know if it should mention this...probably shouldn't...

TLDR: Seeing a neurologist for the first time and probably won't be in a cluster, any advice on how to navigate the appointment?

Telegraph [archived](https://archive.ph/EwcSg) / [unarchived](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/royals/how-the-duchess-of-sussex-transformed-fashion-brands/) (misleading article about Meghan’s impact on named brands).

(The above epiphany apparently hit her like a sack of spuds in 2017, when she was seen on her first official walkabout carrying a bag by Edinburgh brand Strathberry, which then sold out to such an extent that Strathberry was able to expand its workforce. It was then that she realised her power as a fashion influencer. NOW READ ON.)

Meghan’s recently been associated with Cesta Collective bags and, previously, Clevr Blends, producers of flavoured sawdust linked with a Chinese state accused of genocide: Page Six [archived](https://archive.ph/T25iP) / [unarchived](https://pagesix.com/2021/04/04/meghan-markles-coffee-has-ties-to-china-state-accused-of-genocide/).

We know she’s invested in both, which means that she gets a share of profits - so it’s definitely worth her while to influence the life out of them (if only the Sussex Squad could afford to buy this crap).

However, the Princess of Wales also knowingly invokes the Kate Effect.

On 29 April 2023, 17-year-old Issy Phipps no longer had to deal with her depression.

Later, in May, the Princess of Wales visited Maidenhead, where Issy had played rugby. There, her mother Sophie Renton and her cousin Sophie McGown met the Princess and presented her with a pair of earrings, the Issy Star, which McGown, founder of EARSASS, had created in honour of Issy.

McGown of course hoped that the Princess would wear them one day. And that day came:

The Princess wore them on a visit to Birmingham on 10 October 2023, World Mental Health Day. £5 of the £25.50 earrings were to be donated to mental health charity BraveMind. £15,000 is 3,000 pairs of earrings.

The apt is on Seigel St in Bushwick, about a 7 minute walk to the Montrose Ave L stop, 7 minute walk to the Lorimer St M/J stop, and around a 10 minute walk to the Broadway G stop. Its on the second floor with roof access and in-unit washer/dryer. The apt has lots of natural light, a big kitchen with a brand new oven that was installed a couple weeks ago and lots of counter space. The bedroom in the pictures is the bedroom that is available. It has its own private bathroom and a decent sized closet. The apt also has an “office” room that can be used as a shared work space, which can be seen in the photos as well. The rent would be $1725, not including utilities (WIFI, electric, gas) which would usually run you about $200 a month on top. 

I’m a graduate student so I will be going in and out for classes during some weekdays, but usually will go out on the weekends. I’ll sometimes have a couple friends over for drinks and enjoy being social, but also value independence. Like I said, I don’t really have a preference for a male or female roommate, but ideally they would be closeish in age. I enjoy watching soccer and movies, and hanging out outside. 

The room would be available to move in late October, or November (the lease does start in November).

I am not a connoisseur with a golden palate, so maybe they aren't fine but they're definitely inoffensively drinkable to me. 99 out of 100 times I do not take milk, so I am either having the shot straight or Americano-style and its usually delicious.

I am just curious if I am leaving some opportunities for better results on the table with my grinder. I've been eyeing up the Wacaco Exagrind. At $175nzd, it is probably the most I would feel comfortable spending on a manual coffee grinder. Would I have an appreciably better experience with it over my C2? Is there a much better grinder at a similar price point that I should consider? Is my C2 perfectly fine and I should look elsewhere for improvements? Are there other means by which I would see improvements, like a different basket, etc?

You were here right now

We would be sitting in bed doom scrolling

Go for a walk around the block listen to the alarm birds

What are they trying to tell us?

It's the swooping season and noisy miners click wings

Random recounts algebra ass and songs stuck in his head

I'm listening to music ignoring the silence

Waiting for synchonisation songs to occur

What do you wanna do today?

It's early nothing's open for an hour

Give me your feet to rub

Invisions you in grey sweatpants I focus on one place

That's all it ever was the burning fire of passions desire

I get it this is close enough

Read don't react

And I'm still sitting here with you breathing deepens

Tingling sensation through my core

Stomach complains drink more water less coffee

Have a day off from eating sugar

Yesterday we saw seeing a woman carrying a snake 

Why are snakes attracted to us?

Medusa looks in the mirror a broken smile

I smell like blood and cigarettes

I look up at you occupying space at the end of the bed

Do you want me to read you something I wrote?

Friction welded kintsugi 

I had hypergraphia

Frontal lobe seizures

How much damage have we done to ourselves?

Reminds you it's gonna be alright, yeah yeah

Hands you my switch go kill a dragon for me

I haven't invested any points into anything

Feel free to level the character how you choose

So I might change my play style teach me Master

Of silence there's no other as strong

Thinking about a year from now 

Flips red gold coin it lands on its side

You send out your higher self to meet me on the astral

I yell at you get off me

Push you away violently voice up against you 

Electricity sparks when we touch 

Do you wanna short fuse some power outlets?

Pushing the bubble out 

Telling you the story of quest I con

Contraption you move with your mind

Records who can do it

Scrying tools draw sacred geometry

Training ground

Super slide

Portals of bad cgi open satanic rituals live broadcast

I have an angel on my shoulder but a devil in my head

Feeling like the insanity has stopped physically

I was going to purchase the APM because one of the agents on Amazon said they would refund me the difference (they had a deal) once I received the item. I purchased it immediately because it would come to $278. However, now the agent says that’s not possible, and at this point, I don’t want it anymore.

In the meantime, I saw the B&W PX7 S2e for $249. I bought it, received it, and I’m loving it. They even gave me a partial refund of $53 since there was a static sound coming from the 3.5mm jack. Other than that issue with the cable, there’s no problem.

A PX7 S2e for $200? Why not!

Now that I’ve learned I can use a cable, I have a few questions:

1. Is there any way to use the cable without draining my phone’s battery while it’s connected? Would a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter help prevent this?

I figure if I can make them at home, I can adjust the sugar as needed, or use alternatives.

Don't have a coffee maker, or any kind of coffee making supplies, so this question is also to kind of get an idea of what I'd need to purchase to get into this sort of thing.",0,1728504817.0,starbucks,5,0.17,False

I’m a mechanical engineering graduate from RWTH Aachen University and have also worked as a software developer alongside my studies. During the last two years, I dived deep into the world of Finite Element Analysis, especially for structural mechanics, which ultimately led me to develop my own FEM solver. Today, I’m excited to share my project with you all!

# FEMaster Features:

* **Open Source**: Free to use and modify.
* **Syntax Similarity**: Familiar syntax for elements, nodes, sets, and surfaces, inspired by Abaqus.
* **Solid Elements Only**: Supports C3D4/5/6/8/10/15/20/20R elements.
* **Linear Load Cases**: Focus on linear static, linear static topology optimization, and linear frequency analysis.
* **Custom Coordinate Systems**: Support for various coordinate system definitions.
* **Constraint Types**: Includes Kinematic Coupling, Tie Constraints, and Connector Elements.
* **Visualization**: Compatible with ParaView for visualization.
* **Multithreading Support**: Efficient handling of multiple cores for parallel computations.

I used it at my institute to simulate systems with >5 Million DOFs in less than 10 minutes which I consider to be very solid. Running the solver, after having it compiled is as simple as:

`./bin/FEMaster.exe path/to/file.inp --ncpus 4`

Running my solver on an `.inp` will yield a `.res`. Using the [`tovtk.py`](http://tovtk.py) python script which is also present in the project, one can visualise the `.res` files in vtk:

`python -m python.solution.tovtk path/to/inp`



# Feedback & Discussion:

I’d love to hear your thoughts on the project and would greatly appreciate any feedback or suggestions! Feel free to check out the repository, try it out, and let me know what you think!

P.S. I’ve also put together some slides that I presented at my institute. I’ll share them here as well:

1g00wv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1g00wv0/grief_and_acceptance/,"Grief, and acceptance.","Trigger warning possibly?

I want to say that, I’m experience prolonged grief. This is obviously going to turn into just one more vertical of CPTSD, or it already is and I’m just masking the trauma as grief.

Idek how to start, or what I’m looking for. Maybe anything to bring me back to the ground. Right now, I’m experience a massive state of depersonalization. 

Long story short,

My ex-wife over the course of a year, after abandoning me and taking our kids out of state then apologizing and promised the works or whatever and came back, I am always acceptance to reconciliation. Or in this case, I’ll always be a naive gullible idiot that too often extends the benefit of the doubt.

I can not take away from the work that she did, but what I can say is that it feels like a facade. We went to counseling, and in counseling our therapist made sure it was well known that it wasn’t a marital issue, and was individual issues. I am always agreeable and accountable to the things I need to work on, or become aware to. In therapy, my wife directed all of everything including her own individual counseling about problems with me (I know because she would tell me what the therapist would say based on her concerns or vents about me, about me. Which always felt garbage because it’s almost negatively influential to give advice about me without me or my perspective there). Whatever. It just seemed all she cared about was treating me poorly, and then doing everything in her power to convince any and everyone that her perspective was the cold hard justified truth.

She would stone wall me relentlessly, she would deprive me of sex and physical intimacy(this one was so discouraging, I loved just spending time in the shower with her and her presence), she would deprive communication, she would only talk to me about things she wanted or wanted to do. I essentially accepted her breadcrumb of love, in hopes that reconciliation could be achieved.

Well,

1. She took me on a date after a month long limbo of confusion for me as she drove me to the brink of suicide a month prior by devaluing my beyond belief. I am a terrible father, I don’t provide for the family, I’m not present, God looks down on me, my existence is a problem. Those are the things she said to me that I knew were false, but believed in those moments and turned to suicide due to shame and self condemnation.

2. I didn’t commit, but I def was actively going to with her gun. Anyways, the month after was nothing. Never addressed the issue, I continued to journal and be introspective and pick up the areas I believed I needed growth in and that others pointed out.

3. The date was in my opinion her method to lower my guard. This is where the season in the pit begins.


The Pit

1. The date had me feeling high, and euphoric. Filled with hope. We came home, she told me she wanted to be more incorporated into the financial whatever. I said okay, showed her a 3 month budgeting and financial plan I had been working on. She convinced me to advance all of that money to front load whatever and instead of stressing for the next few months to knock out whatever immediately and just cruise the next few months. I’m such a fucking idiot, that I said yes that sounds great! 

2. The next day she expressed that she wanted to take space, so that we could get to a place of peace and continue working on our marriage. I begged her not to leave, but that I wouldn’t force her to stay. My trauma at this point was ripping me up inside as I was in denial of what I knew would happen. She let me work on a separation plan that was 6-8 pages long, focused purely on reconciliation and facilitating our affairs with the kids and financials while apart. She read it and made a few suggestions, agreed to it then because I was wanting to be trusting of her I allowed her to take the children out of state.

3. Adios buddy. She was supposed to return in a week to do a few things. At this time, my side business was booming. I had partnerships with advertisers and social casinos, whatever. One day I was playing with a few dollars on some random ass game, and unexpectedly hit some jackpot that I won 50k ish dollars with.

4. That jackpot win was at like 3am in the morning as I was struggling being apart from my family and couldn’t sleep. When I won that, I was incredibly excited to share with my wife at the time that I won that and we could do all these extra things I knew she wanted to do and that I wanted to also.

5. 7am in the morning comes around, and I FaceTime her. I won roughly 54k or around there, and after I won I sent my father money as he just had some gastro surgery and was out of work. I still have 40k+ remaining. When I told her how much I won, that I sent whatever to my dad and had all of this left to do whatever with, I didn’t get the reaction I expected. She raged, and raged, relentlessly and I didn’t even know why she was so angry. She was angry that I didn’t pay the bills before she woke up, but I wanted to wait to do anything with the money til she woke up so she could prioritize with me. 

6. It didn’t matter anyways, we argued about why she was so angry and finally said if I don’t come back are you going to continue to pay my bills? That’s when I accepted the reality of things, but also is when I self sabotaged so incredibly harshly that everything around me collapsed.

7. I gave her money for her car, other bills, and teeth. The rest I retained and just held onto. But when we got off the phone, she stopped sharing her location and went no contact.


This post is getting long so I apologize. I’ll shorten the rest and if anything needs addressing, ask in the comments and I can maybe explain more specifically there. 

I spent 40 something days paralyzed. I didn’t eat, or sleep barely. The only water I drank was in my cup of coffee that I sipped throughout the day as I sat in the insufferably hot garage. I was traumstized even being in my own home because I would often see or hear my kids or my wife in areas of the house they weren’t in, which would make me believe they were home. Instead it was their echos of their vocals that haunted me. 

After 40 days, I became aware of my mental state when my doctor told me I had dropped from 165 pounds to 118 pounds in 3 months.

After becoming aware, it felt impossible to move in any direction. I felt unbearable pain. I reached out to 30-40 people trying to find other people to help, and I gave away every last penny I had. Later that night (end of April/may) time frame I tried to hang myself. It didn’t work, and I leaned on my faith in God to endure the pain and agony.

Afterwards, I had to sacrifice my business in order to send her money for the kids. As she wasn’t transparent about her situation, she only reached out using the kids as the weapon for financial abuse. I was forced into poverty, which wouldn’t have been the case had I not mistakenly given all of my money away anyways. That’s on me, but I wish you could see what I saw at the time and regarding hope and life, it didn’t exist and in any ways today still doesn’t.

In court, she strangled me in a controlling lynch by weaponizing my emotion strain and grief so that I was agreeable to her terms before we went before a judge. Ultimately in the end, I ended up with 50% or a bit more custody, $2000 a month in child support, the only one who has to drive to pick up and drop off the kids (she lives an hour away from me purposely as she moved as far as she could from me to make things difficult since the state made her move back to Texas), I got all of the community debts but got to keep my home.

And LASTLY, just at the end of August right after signing this mediation agreement (2-3 weeks) the studio I worked at shut down, and everyone was laid off.

When that happened, this depersonalization happened. And I don’t know how to find my way back. I don’t know how to want anything else in life ever again, or find interest anywhere. In many ways, my conscious state wants to survive and live and my subconscious wants to slowly choke me to death as I struggle to sleep, and starve. It’s been 8 months since this all started in March, and I don’t know what to believe and what not to, who is an enemy and who isn’t, which way is right or left, or anything anymore. I’m so insanely crippled mentally I lost confident in my ability to even persevere through this. I have no support system, no nothing. Just been sitting in the pit, with no strength to get up.

Thanks for listening guys and gals, I know in many areas I contributed to my own demise. Trust me I have spent enough introspective journaling and shit I have like hundred of journal pages, lamentations, poems, etc, I know where I could have gone better, but I still don’t know the truth in regards to what. She has done everything in her power to smear me, run a narrative that I’m dangerous to her and the kids(That’s false to me as I am the primary caregiver for years while she worked out of the home because she didn’t want to be a mother and a wife 24/7 and besides that, anything I have ever felt or done dangerously was always self directed and not done to do anything to anybody else but to escape whatever trap I was backed into. I’ve never physical touched her or the kids in an aggressive or abusive way ever.) If she truly feared, I can respect her perspective on it. But I also know my own perspective and intentions and my own truth. So I can understand and disagree, but I’m not going to invalidate the truth for either of us. 

That’s all I guess. Now I am just suffering day to day getting to the next moment or second and stuck. God bless.",1,1728504759.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

So, we linked up and he was doing his normal thing, greeting people, getting butt scratches and whatnot. He went up to this gentleman sitting on the bench, they chatted a little, the guy took a sip of his coffee, then went to take a bite of his sandwich and boom! My dog snatched right from his hand. 
As I was making my way over there, he grabbed the other half and scarfed it down, wrapper and all! 
It happened so fast and I was so slow, there was no stopping him. I said sorry to the fella, but let him know I could not replace his sandwich. What a start to a Wednesday, hope you guys have a great day!
