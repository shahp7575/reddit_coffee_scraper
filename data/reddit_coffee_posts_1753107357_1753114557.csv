1m5n6yn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poems/comments/1m5n6yn/caffeine_mask/,Caffeine Mask,"This poem I wrote is about concealing true emotional anxiety behind the more socially acceptable symptoms of caffeine induced restlessness. By attributing the shakiness and racing thoughts to coffee, masking deeper internal struggles and anxiety, using caffeine as both a shield and a distraction. 

Caffeine Mask

Palms sweat for the guilt I won’t confess.
Thoughts scattered in a caffeine mess.
But if I keep the mugs stacked high,
no one will sense the real panic I deny.

So I drink to drown the warning signs 
the shaky hands, the tangled lines.
Each heartbeat’s hiccup is the price I pay
to seem unfazed, to seem okay.

Because there’s science in this spinning mind,
a limbic loop to unwind.
But better to sip and mask than be seen frail
an anxious soul hiding in a jittered machine.

Porcelain warmth, my morning mask.
Sip. Swallow. Hide.

1.  Interest trailing off;

2.  People who started the series late and are just behind in viewership;

3.  The less populated states having less interest.

I don’t think population fully accounts for it—- Illinois is a big state but has less than a quarter of the first day views.

**1 Corinthians 12:4** ***^(BSB)***

* *There are different gifts, but the same Spirit.*

**People differ greatly** in their gifts and abilities. This is part of God’s design. If everyone had the same gifts, certain kinds of work would be overdone, while others would be left undone. But since there are so many different things that need to be done, there is a variety of abilities among people, ensuring that every task has the right person to accomplish it.

Our capacity for usefulness is not random. “To each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.” We must always remember that our abilities are a gift from God. This should keep us from envying others who may seem to have more impressive talents.

God gave them their gifts, and He gave us ours. He had a specific purpose—He wanted us to do a certain type of work, just as He had different work for others. Our job is simply to make the most of the gifts we’ve been given and do our work to the best of our ability.",1,1753114374.0,TheDailyDose,0,1.0,False

I’m excited about this update because we’ve delivered the first coffee tables to customers who volunteered to help with beta testing, and I’ll be sharing some of their photos and videos. We’ve delivered 5 Coffee Tables to Kickstarter backers and have another 3 tables that we’ve sent to people on our team for internal testing. We have sent out all of the invites for Coffee Table Beta Testers, but we haven’t yet sent out invites for Side Table Beta Testing.

# Beta Table First Impressions

One of my favorite pieces of content from the testing so far is this unboxing video that Jory from our team did:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wKTKVM7ruM&t=2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wKTKVM7ruM&t=2s)

The packaging is a bit different from what we expect to ship to the majority of backers, but the assembly steps and the finished product are the same. I’m going to post a short collage below from some of our beta testers.

https://preview.redd.it/srlmuews49ef1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=db17b21f136d4c1a4274006b3866795173784bd8

Overall, we’re very happy with the performance of the first couple of tables. Beta testers have helped to find a few kinks in the product packaging and software, but they’ve been relatively minor, and we already have fixes underway. One thing I think many of you will be happy with is that the tables are virtually silent. A few months ago we decided to splurge and use upgraded motor drivers, and even I was surprised by how quiet the new tables are. 

# Timeline

We’ve had a relatively steady month, so the timeline hasn’t changed since the last update. We expect that the majority of Coffee Tables and Side Tables will ship in September, and the first large batch of Coffee Tables could ship as soon as the end of August. We’re working around the clock to ramp up manufacturing and get your tables delivered as quickly as possible. 

# The Tariff Saga Continues

Over the last couple of months, Vietnam tariffs started at 0%, increased to 46%, went down to 10%, and now we’re back up to 20%. The Trump administration is saying that the deal is final. The Vietnamese government seems to be indicating that it’s not final. Who knows at this point, but we’re trudging ahead. I mostly mention this for the sake of transparency, and there’s not much to do except hope for a reasonable rate when the tables do clear customs.

That’s all for this update! We’re very excited about reaching the milestone of having shipped the first coffee tables to customers, and we’re working to get the rest of your tables shipped as quickly as possible.

Recently, a friend of mine — a total tech enthusiast and blockchain geek — stumbled upon a surprisingly effective way to make money. At first, he kept it to himself, just to see if it really worked. Spoiler: it did.

Even in my college years it was easy make friends and find groups that I fit into and felt comfortable and accepted in.

When I started dating my now husband we were long distance. Eventually I moved to be with him. Ever since moving I have had a hard time with friendships. I always feel like I’m on the outside of every group I’ve hung out with. The last one to get an invite, if I get on at all. The person that is just forgotten.

I normally don’t let it get to me because I am a bit of an introvert, but things have become harder for me since having my daughter. She is a little over a year now. There are a couple other moms in my husband and my friend group and I started trying to get to know them all and hang out with them more. I tried to be really intentional. Inviting them to go places or hang out with me and my daughter, helping whenever they needed it, always responding to texts. I felt like it was going good for a while, but always did feel like I was putting in more effort. One of the problems may be that I moved here 7 years ago, while most of them grew up in the area and went to school together. There were a couple times that they would post pictures of them doing outings or play dates together and I would feel a bit sad and left out.

The other day I reached a breaking point I guess. I texted one of the moms that lived closest to me in the morning and told her I was planning to maybe go either to an indoor play place or a coffee shop near us that had a little playroom for kids and said that I’d love to hang out if they want to join. She told me that sounded fun and to keep her updated. Later that day I told her that I was going to go to the coffee shop in about an hour. She responded that all the other moms were at her house hanging out right now and that she would maybe check with alll of them to see what they wanted to do.

So I went to the coffee shop and sat there waiting for a response. Time passed and I didn’t receive any texts back. I do not like to cry in public, but I couldn’t help but cry a little as I sat there watching my daughter play. I have never felt more alone as a mother, than in that moment. I think if they texted back that they couldn’t come or even didn’t want to come it would have been less painful. The silence hurt. I decided to stop trying to initiate stuff for a bit and see if maybe they invite me to something. It’s been over a month now and I haven’t received a single texts from any of them.

I tell my husband that it’s fine and I don’t need them, but when I think about that day and the way I felt in that moment I still want to cry.

- Dopo - easily my favorite so far

- Great Basin Brewing - solid bar food and great lunch deal (I think it came with a free beer when we went)

- Southcreek Pizza Co - Enjoyed this spot too. 

- Full Belly Deli - This is near the airport and right down the street from my office in Reno.

- Beer NV Taproom & Spirits - This was fun for me since they had such a large local beer selection

- Pangolin Café - Really enjoy their coffee

- Roamer Coffee House - Love the vibes here. Coffee is good too, but I thought Pangolin was better. Roamer's Sparks location is close to where I work in Reno, so I will definitely go back.

- Woody’s Grill & Spirits - It was fine. It is in a strip mall and the food was just ok IMO.

Set in a post-apocalyptic near future, the ancient alien race **Nyx** has invaded Earth and made one fatal mistake — they left **you** alive.

You’re the last human left.  
Your mission?  
**Kill. Everything. That. Moves.**

No exposition dumps. No hand-holding. Just raw, fast-paced, DOOM-inspired carnage.

What I learned during development:

Before this, I thought game development was just ""write code in Unity and ship."" I was wrong.

Here’s what I learned the hard way:

* **Style is everything.** I built around the idea of ""brutal and corrupted"" — every asset, sound, and animation had to support that.
* **Gameplay feel > graphics.** Muzzle flashes, recoil, camera shake, blood splatter — these made the game satisfying.
* **Being indie means being everything.** Programmer, artist, sound designer, marketer, QA tester. No one else is coming to help.
* **AI tools are useful**, but only if you bring taste, vision, and editing skills to the table. No tool makes decisions for you.

Where to get it:

I just launched it on [itch.io](http://itch.io) — free to play. Would love feedback from fellow devs and players.

Picture this: you're trying to focus on a crucial work report, but your brain feels like it's wading through quicksand. You're constantly tired, your motivation to tackle big projects is waning, and that sharp edge you once had in meetings seems to have dulled. Sound familiar? We've all had days like that, of course, but for some, it's a persistent state - and it might be more than just a bad night's sleep or too much coffee.

When most people think about Testosterone Replacement Therapy - TRT - their minds often jump straight to the gym. They picture bigger muscles, better workouts, maybe even a boost in libido. And yes, TRT can certainly help with those things. But here's the thing: testosterone's influence stretches far beyond physical prowess. It's a fundamental hormone that impacts nearly every system in your body, including your brain and your overall drive. So, what if that mental fog, that lack of professional edge, is actually tied to suboptimal T levels? Let's explore how TRT can be a game-changer for your productivity and career.

## The Brain-T Connection: Sharpening Your Mental Game

You might be wondering, how does a hormone usually associated with muscles and sex drive affect my brainpower? It's a great question! Testosterone plays a significant role in cognitive function. When your levels are low, you can experience a range of mental challenges that directly impact your work performance.

In my experience, many people with low T report:

* **Brain Fog**: That frustrating feeling of being unable to think clearly, like your thoughts are muffled.
* **Poor Concentration**: Struggling to stay focused on tasks, easily distracted, or finding it hard to dive deep into complex problems.
* **Memory Issues**: Forgetting names, appointments, or details you'd normally recall easily.

When testosterone levels are optimized through TRT, many individuals report a noticeable improvement in these areas. It's like someone turned on a light switch in their mind. You might find:

* **Improved Focus**: Suddenly, that long report doesn't seem so daunting. You can concentrate for longer periods, getting more done in less time.
* **Better Memory**: Recalling information becomes easier, which is incredibly helpful whether you're remembering client details or project deadlines.
* **Enhanced Mental Clarity**: Decisions feel clearer, and you can process information more efficiently. This is actually pretty cool when you think about it - a clearer head means better strategic thinking.

## Energy and Drive: Fueling Your Ambition

Let's be honest, it's tough to be productive when you're dragging yourself through the day. Low energy is one of the most common complaints associated with low testosterone. This isn't just about feeling tired after a workout; it's about a pervasive fatigue that can make even simple tasks feel like a monumental effort.

Think about it: if you're constantly fighting tiredness, are you really going to volunteer for that challenging new project? Are you going to stay late to perfect a presentation? Probably not. TRT can help by:

* **Sustained Energy**: Many people on TRT report a more consistent, natural energy level throughout the day, not just short bursts. This means you can power through a long workday without hitting that mid-afternoon slump.
* **Increased Motivation**: When you have the energy, you also have the drive. That ambition to tackle new challenges, to push for promotions, or to innovate in your field can return. It's not just about ""feeling good""; it's about having the physical and mental fuel to pursue your goals.
* **Reduced Fatigue**: Less chronic tiredness means you're more likely to engage fully in your work, stay sharp during meetings, and have energy left over for your personal life.

## Confidence and Resilience: The Professional Edge

Beyond the purely cognitive and energetic benefits, TRT can also subtly - but powerfully - impact your emotional state and confidence. Low testosterone can often lead to increased irritability, anxiety, and a general feeling of being ""off."" These emotional shifts can erode your self-confidence and make professional interactions more challenging.

When your hormones are balanced, you might notice:

* **Boosted Confidence**: Feeling physically and mentally better naturally translates to greater self-assurance. You're more likely to speak up in meetings, take on leadership roles, and present your ideas with conviction.
* **Emotional Stability**: Reduced irritability and improved mood can make you a more effective communicator and team player. This is incredibly valuable in any professional setting.
* **Greater Resilience**: The ability to bounce back from setbacks, handle stress, and adapt to change is crucial in today's fast-paced work environment. Balanced testosterone can contribute to a more stable mood and better stress response, helping you navigate challenges with a clearer head.

Imagine walking into a negotiation or a high-stakes presentation feeling calm, clear-headed, and confident. That's a professional edge that goes well beyond just ""getting the job done.""

## The Ripple Effect

It's clear, isn't it? When you're sharper mentally, brimming with sustained energy, and radiating quiet confidence, it doesn't just benefit you. Your improved performance can create a positive ripple effect throughout your team, your company, and ultimately, your career trajectory. You become the go-to person, the problem-solver, the natural leader. It's all about optimizing your entire self, not just one part.

## Final Thoughts

While TRT isn't a magic pill for career success - hard work and dedication are still key, of course - it can certainly provide a powerful foundation. If you've been experiencing persistent brain fog, low energy, or a noticeable dip in your professional drive, it might be worth exploring your hormone levels with a doctor. Optimizing your testosterone could be the missing piece to unlocking your full potential, not just in the gym, but in the boardroom, the office, and every aspect of your productive life.",1,1753113701.0,TRTtracker,0,1.0,False

We were meeting my sister and her NK, but she was running a little late so my NK and I enjoyed some snack at the tables nearby. A little girl (probably 7/8) approached us and wanted to play. Her mom or adult figure came over a minute later and started speaking the the girl in some language. I told the girl my NK needed to finish her snack and then she could play. The adult was kind of hovering me and asking questions like, how old is NK, are you her mom, how long will you be here, etc. Not super off questions but the wlvibe was a weird. A minute later, the girl came back and the mom/adult started talking again in their language and the little girl asked if the woman could hold my NK. I said she was shy and wouldn't like that, but they kept asking and then the woman came over and literally tried to take NK off my lap saying she was so cute and beautiful. I should've left right then but I stood firm on the no and waited for my sister. The next 5-10 minutes these people were just all up in our business and I was so uncomfortable so we left the park entirely and took a walk to a nearby coffee shop. My sister said it’s not necessary to tell my bosses since nothing happened, but my gut says I should tell them.

I don’t usually share income numbers and won’t here either, but I’m making this post because I see a lot of teens here saying they have too much free time and no idea what to do with it and they don't know which skills to learn and where and how to start — especially when it comes to making money.

And honestly, I was in the same spot not long ago.

So here’s a very real, step-by-step breakdown of how to start from absolute zero and build something that could help you get somewhere in life in a year or two — if you’re serious about it.

No fluff. No lies. Just the truth and some advice I wish someone gave me earlier.

Let’s start from the real beginning — the mindset part

When you’re a teenager, the biggest thing you have is time. You don’t have bills. You don’t have a family to feed. You don’t have major responsibilities (at least most of you don’t).

That’s your superpower.

Now the truth is — there are literally thousands of ways to make money online and offline. But not every way is for everyone. This is where most people mess up.

They try to copy someone else’s path.

“Oh he’s doing drop-shipping, let me do that too.”

“She’s editing videos, mujhay bhi shayad yeh karna chahiye.”

Stop.

You won’t know what works for YOU until you try a few things and fail at them. That’s the only way. I also tried and failed random things that didn’t work before I found something that clicked for me.

So relax. Don’t worry about being perfect. You’ll figure it out.

**Step 1:** Understand how money actually works (financial literacy)

Before you even jump into skills, understand what money even is. Because nobody teaches this in school. Not in Pakistan. Not anywhere.

Money is just a reward. When you help someone, solve their problem, or give them something valuable — they give you money in return.

That’s it.

So if you’re broke right now, it’s not because you’re unlucky. It’s just because you haven’t built a skill yet that the world is willing to pay for. And that’s fixable.

If you’re starting from zero, open YouTube and search:

“How to be financially literate”

“How to make money as a teenager”

Watch the goray talk about this stuff. Unki videos may be boring but they figured this out way before we did (maybe we still haven't). Learn how business works, how money flows, and why skills are more powerful than degrees in the long run.

**Step 2:** Choose one skill — but only after exploring a few

Here’s the deal. You won’t know which skill is “right” for you without testing a few.

Let’s say you’ve got 4 weeks.

Week 1, try learning about copywriting. Week 2, switch to video editing. Week 3, try graphic design. Week 4, maybe try AI and automations or basic coding.

No need to overthink.

Go to YouTube. Watch 5-10 hours per skill. Try it. Play around. Make a fake project. Ask yourself: ""Could I do this for 1 year straight without dying of boredom?""

If the answer is no, move on.

Eventually, you’ll find one skill where you’re like — “Hmmm, this is interesting, Is may mujhay maza aata hai.” That’s your green light. Now go deeper into that.

**Step 3:** Learn the hell out of it

Let’s say you chose video editing. Here’s how to learn it properly:

Watch at least 100 hours of tutorials on YouTube. Seriously. No shortcuts. That's 2-3 hours a day for 1.5 - 2 months.

But don’t just passively watch. Practice while watching. Pause the video, try the same thing in your software, mess up, fix it, keep going.

If it’s writing (copywriting), read email newsletters, study landing pages, recreate ads, write your own fake ads.

If it’s web design, make a sample website for businesses and/or software companies for practice and send them the link for free. Watch what they say. If they like it, good. If they don't, iterate.

Also: Join communities. Discord servers, Skool groups, Make LinkedIn connections. Talk to people who are already in the game. Don’t be shy.

The point is — stop only being a content consumer and start being a builder as well.

**Step 4:** Apply what you’ve learned — even if no one is paying you yet

You’ve spent 2–3 months learning. Now what?

Start using your skill in the real world.

This is where most teens get stuck. They get scared of putting themselves out there. But bro, no one’s coming to hand you Rs. 100,000 just because you watched some videos.

Start by doing either:

1. Free work for someone
2. Internships (paid or unpaid)
3. Helping a relative’s business
4. Offering your service to local stores
5. Posting your work on Instagram, LinkedIn, Fiverr, wherever

In the beginning, it’s not about money. It’s about practice. Real work with real feedback. That’s how you improve and gain confidence.

**Step 5:** Start charging when you feel ready (and sometimes even before)

Once you’ve done 2-3 small projects — even if they were free — you can start charging.

Don’t worry about asking for too much. Start with small amounts/charges depending on your skill.

You’ll be surprised how many people will pay just because:

- You’re available
- You sound serious
- You actually know what you’re talking about

That first payment will feel unreal. Screenshot it. Frame it if you want. But then — double down. Use that as proof that you’re not some “banda with no direction” anymore.

You’re now in the game.

**Final advice:**

Making money is not fast. And it’s definitely not easy.

It took me 3 years of being curious, failing, watching boring tutorials at night, saying no to useless hangouts, and staying in the game — before I made my first actual money.

But let me tell you something: it’s worth it.

When I get to my early 20s and I already have experience, money, and skills — life would feel different. I won't be stuck begging for internships. I won't be dependent on someone’s mood. I'll be free, Insha'Allah. 

If you’re 15, 16, 17 — even better. You’re early. Use your time. Use your internet. Build your skill. Be shameless about learning. Be consistent even when it feels boring.

Stop asking “what’s the best way to make money” and start asking “what can I get really good at that people will pay me for?”

Because that’s the real game.

No shortcuts. Just focus. Effort. Time.

And a little bit of chaye/coffee, YouTube, and midnight existential crisis helps too.

If you read till here, it means you’re serious. I respect that. Feel free to ask me anything. I won’t bite. I’ve been where you are. And I still remember what it felt like.

You got this. Ab kaam shuru karo. 

By the way, you don't have to leave your studies completely. You are young. You've got enough energy to do both at the same time. That's what I did and what I still do. But yes, you won't have time to watch reels and doom scroll reddit. That's just one out of the hundreds of other sacrifices you have to make :)",10,1753113529.0,TeenPakistani,0,1.0,False
1m5mrjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tipstor/comments/1m5mrjn/beans_dust_and_elephants_caffeine_high_in/,"Beans, Dust, and Elephants: Caffeine High in Ngorongoro, Tanzania","Somewhere between the volcanic rim and the Maasai warriors guiding tourists through lion country, a coffee estate grows high and stubborn in the dirt. It sits in the shadow of Ngorongoro Crater in northern Tanzania, surrounded by acacia trees, elephant trails, and enough altitude to make your chest tighten before the caffeine even hits. This is not a Starbucks fantasy with potted succulents and gentle indie music. This is coffee grown in volcanic ash, roasted under the same sky where hyenas howl, and brewed by hands calloused from decades of backbreaking sun.

Ngorongoro Coffee Estate doesn’t compete with hip roasters in Berlin or Brooklyn. It doesn’t have to. The Arabica beans grown here at 1,700 to 1,800 meters above sea level soak up the volcanic minerals and sun in ways that cannot be replicated in greenhouses or chemically enhanced soil. Tanzanian highland coffee has long been known in specialty markets for its bright acidity, rich body, and wine-like flavor profile, often layered with notes of black currant, cedar, and citrus.

This estate sprawls across nearly 500 hectares on the slopes of the Great Rift Valley, just west of the Ngorongoro Conservation Area. One moment, you’re watching baboons skitter across the access road. The next, you’re sipping a medium roast with hints of fig and red apple, while a tractor coughs in the distance, dragging sacks of freshly picked cherries down a muddy trail. It’s coffee, but it’s also survival, economy, ritual, and rebellion brewed into a cup.

Tanzania exports around 40,000 metric tons of coffee annually, with Arabica making up 70% of that total. It ranks as the fourth-largest coffee producer in Africa, after Ethiopia, Uganda, and Côte d’Ivoire. Most of this flows out through the port of Dar es Salaam, destined for Germany, Japan, and the United States. Yet few drinkers have any idea that their morning brew might have started its journey near the same place wildebeest migrate and rhinos crash through undergrowth.

The harvest season runs from July through December, depending on rainfall and altitude. Ngorongoro’s microclimate, cool nights, steady sun, and volcanic soil, creates an ideal setting. It’s not mass production. It’s slow work, often by hand, with pickers paid by weight and roasters making decisions based on smell and texture rather than data points and predictive analytics.

Tourism data from the Tanzania Tourism Board reports over 1.5 million visitors in 2023, with most headed toward safari hubs like Arusha and Serengeti. What they often miss is the caffeine corridor. Small estates like Ngorongoro, Burka, and Mondul, where agriculture meets wild terrain in a way that feels both natural and absurd. One moment you’re dodging zebra crossings on red clay roads, the next you’re standing in a processing shed listening to a local farmer talk fermentation tanks and bean density with the intensity of a sommelier.

There are no barista competitions here. No minimalist cafes. Just strong, unfiltered brews poured into enamel cups, often served beside ugali or chapati if you’re sticking around long enough to be considered more than a stranger. Local consumption of coffee remains relatively low. Tanzanians consume just 0.7 kg per person annually compared to Finland’s 12 kg. But that’s changing slowly as domestic brands grow and roasting techniques improve.

Travelers wanting to see the operation up close should aim for dry season, June through October. This window offers ideal weather for trekking the crater and visiting nearby estates without slipping into axle-deep mud or battling malaria mosquitoes the size of hummingbirds. Lodges in Karatu provide proximity without draining your bank account, and many now include coffee tours alongside safari itineraries. It’s a break from the lion-chasing madness, a reminder that not all African experiences have to be measured in Big Five sightings.

There’s something oddly calming about walking through rows of arabica trees while buffalo grunt somewhere beyond the tree line. The air smells like wet bark, sweet fruit, and diesel. It’s work and chaos in equal measure. The kind of place where luxury isn’t a plunge pool or Belgian pillow menus. It’s a hot cup brewed in the very soil where elephants pass through, unnoticed but not uninvited.

Ngorongoro Coffee Estate doesn’t market itself loudly. There’s no influencer campaign. Just beans, drying racks, diesel engines, and people who know that good coffee comes from hard ground and harder labor. Drink it black. No sugar. No cream. Let the bitterness hit. It’s not just caffeine. It’s terroir in a cup. Land, sweat, ash, and thunder rolled into something that kicks harder than a safari jeep on a busted road.

Gold and Leather are the only two useful thing that merchants should import but it rare to see a store run out of leather since there are always hunter players in every factions. Gold is really only useful if you want to build the fancier stuff like baker and golden armor, most war rely completely on infantry musket and how long can you sustain it (or cap snipe)

In term of making money, merchants isnt that good at it either. You can easily gain more by playing peasant. Heck you can just gather a lot of resources and switch to blacksmith and keep making musket and sell the resources you have to continue crafting. Merchant have to wait for the resources amount to drop down just so that they can sell at higher prices. Food always sell at the same price but they also dont make much profit either. The weapon trader perk are nearly useless for making money since no one will buy your overpriced weapons when they can just make more on the shop or use empty royal.

Perhaps I’ve just become accustomed to the burnt taste of Starbucks espresso, but I find the espresso shots onboard almost undrinkable.

First world problems for sure - but curious on others’ thoughts on the coffee shop. ",2,1753113136.0,VirginVoyages,6,0.75,False
1m5mle2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1m5mle2/why_choose_the_keurig_kselect_coffee_maker_for/,Why Choose the Keurig K-Select Coffee Maker for Your Mornings?,"Keurig K-Select 5000198856 is truly a coffee lover's delight wrapped in a compact, marine blue package. I've been brewing my morning coffee with this machine for the past few weeks, and it has transformed my routine. At first glance, its sleek and modern design stood out, elevating the aesthetics of my kitchen counter effortlessly. Beyond its looks, it's packed with features tailored to make your mornings smoother and caffeine-infused. While it has become a trusty companion for me, there are just a handful of considerations you should know about before going all in. Let’s dive into the nitty-gritty, shall we?  

**User-Friendly Design and Simple Controls**  
The first thing that caught my attention about this single-serve coffee maker was its intuitive design. It has just a few well-placed buttons. Brewing your favorite coffee pods couldn’t be easier—slot a pod in, push a button, and out comes steaming goodness in under a minute. With four cup size options available (6, 8, 10, or 12 ounces), I liked the flexibility to customize my serving based on how much of a caffeine kick I needed. After a tiring day at work, I found myself lazily using the single-button operation, which is an absolute game-changer for anyone who values simplicity.  

**Strong Brew Capability**  
What makes this Keurig a standout for me is its ""Strong Brew"" option. I typically enjoy my coffee bold and hearty, and this setting delivered just that. It enhances the strength and intensity of any coffee pod you use, a very appreciated touch when you need that extra boost to get through your early morning meetings. Whether it's dark roast or just a regular medium brew, this feature makes sure even the pickiest coffee enthusiasts (like my sister, for instance) are satisfied.  

Check [Keurig K-Select 5000198856](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b07t1dc1ns/) price on Amazon.  

**Impressive Reservoir Capacity**  
This coffee maker comes equipped with a large 52-ounce removable water reservoir. I found this particularly convenient as it allowed me to brew around five cups of coffee before needing a refill. Refilling is a quick, hassle-free task since the reservoir is detachable. For someone like me, who can’t function until I've had at least two cups of coffee in the morning without any extra chores, this feature was a lifesaver.  

**Quiet Brew Technology**  
My household is no stranger to the grumbles and groans of coffee machines in the early morning. However, this Keurig surprised me with its Quiet Brew Technology. It worked silently in the background without disturbing the tranquil morning atmosphere. This feature is perfect if, like me, you're brewing coffee in a shared space or have a little one (or a sound-sensitive pet) prone to getting startled by noise.  

**Strengths**  
Here are a few of the high points that stood out to me while testing out this coffee maker:  
- Simple button controls streamline the brewing process.  
- Strong brew option delivers a bolder cup for those who love a kick in their coffee.  
- Large removable reservoir reduces the frequency of refills.  
- Quiet Brew Technology minimizes noise, perfect for early mornings.  
- Versatile compatibility with hundreds of K-Cup pod varieties.  

**Pitfalls**  
Despite all the convenience, there were a few less favorable aspects:  
- Its single-serve nature can be limiting when entertaining guests.  
- The machine, though efficient, lacks advanced programmable features like scheduling a brew ahead of time.  
- The price tag may be a little steep if you’re only seeking a basic model.  

**Competing Products to Consider**  
While there’s a lot to love here, it's worth comparing this product to similar coffee makers to figure out what fits your needs. During my research, I found that models like the Nespresso Vertuo and Hamilton Beach FlexBrew offered tough competition. The Nespresso Vertuo excels in delivering barista-style coffee with its crema layer while providing recyclable pod options, but it is often pricier. On the flip side, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew is a highly budget-friendly option that brews both K-Cups and full pots of coffee from grounds. However, it lacks the strong brew intensity feature I’ve come to appreciate in the Keurig K-Select, and its design falls short in terms of aesthetics.  

**Smart Spending**  
Looking at the long-term benefits, I feel the product justifies its price point for what it delivers. Between the brew-strength customization, fast operation, and large reservoir capacity, convenience is at the heart of its design. Sure, it could feel slightly expensive for those who seek just a straightforward coffee maker, but if you value comfort and efficiency like I do, it’s hard to argue with the value it adds. Whether you crave a quick single cup or want the flexibility to brew iced beverages, this machine really shines as a versatile household device.

1m5mkdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1m5mkdc/im_30f_confused_on_whats_going_on_after_first/,I’m (30/F) confused on what’s going on after first date (32/m),"I went on my first date in about 3 years on Saturday (I was previously in a LTR and it ended a year ago). I met him on Hinge and our pre-date conversation was pretty good, then during the date it felt very natural and easy to talk with him at the coffee shop we were at. I think he’s cute and nice, a bit nerdy, and we had a lot in common. We were there for about 3 hours.

After the date as we were walking out, we both expressed we had a good time. I asked if he wanted to hang out again and he said yes, then I gave him a hug, and noticed his voice got kind of lower and slower and we made more eye contact. I asked also if he wanted to get off the app and text and he said yes. We parted ways and I later sent him my number on Hinge. He texted me later saying he had a nice time and we both talked about how relaxed we felt.

Since Saturday, the texting conversation has seemed weird and dry and less consistent which is a bit disappointing because I felt the date went really well. I told him I’d drive to his city next time (about an hour away) and told him I couldn’t meet next weekend but could on a weekday this week, or next week, but he hasn’t gotten back to me on a specific day or anything. Over text, he hadn’t asked me any more questions or has flirted with me or anything really. 

Maybe I’m being overly eager and doing too much pursuing? Maybe he’s nervous or doesn’t know how to flirt or is a bad texter? I was excited about this guy but am worried it’s already fizzling out :( any advice?

TLDR: went on a date with a guy that went well, we agreed to a second date and moved from hinge to texting, now the texting is dry and not really going anywhere and I feel up in the air about when our next date might be. why the vibe shift? ",1,1753113046.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

[Scene opens in the Listener’s apartment] 


[SFX: Breakfast being cooked in the background] 


[Vee sits up on the couch in the living room behind you while you cook breakfast, blinking in slow, tired confusion] 


 *...I’m in their home…* 


[SFX: His heart hammering away] 


[Vee sits up under the heavy blanket, blinking drearily a few times as you try and cook something up for him] 


[Pause…?] 


[For a moment, he simply looks around, as though bewildered] 


 “...Beg pardon?” 


[Pause?] 


 “Eggs…? Ah… Cooked any way is fine. Thank you.” 


[SFX: Breakfast being created] 


[While you cook, you don’t feel his eyes on you. Though they definitely are] 


 *...I don’t think I’m ready to be here. In their home… Gods, look at all the books and cute little knick-knacks* 


[His expression changes subtly]


 *...Count to ten, Vee… Count to ten… Allow yourself the thoughts. Thoughts are not a crime…* 


[Pause?]


 “Coffee sounds lovely, thank you.” 


 *...Ten… Good lord, being in their presence is about to drive me insane… I wish I were wearing my jacket so that if I kissed them, they’d have to cling to it…* 


[SFX: Breakfast being served] 


 “Ah. T-Thank you very much. Um… and thank you for not letting me sleep in wet clothing.” 


[P-Pause…] 


 “Aheh… You’re remarkably relaxed about seeing me in my unmentionables. I respect it.” 


[P-Pause!] 


[He smiles calmly, turning your flustering into a full-on blush] 


 *...Well… The good doctor would be absolutely scandalized at my progress tonight. Nine..* 


 “Yes, love. I understand that you didn’t want me to catch a cold. Again, I appreciate it. Besides, there’s a good chance this might have eventually happened on laundry night anyway.” 


[Pause…] 


[SFX: Breakfast :3] 


 *...They look so beautiful just staring into their cup of coffee… Barely awake, not enough to be scandalized… I wonder what they thought… What they’re thinking now… E-Eight! Seven… Six…” 


[You glance at him occasionally. His hair falls across his thoughtful eyes. No way to tell what he’s thinking at all] 


[Pause…?] 


 “I, ah… I’m feeling fine, thank you. I do want to apologize for imposing myself on you like this, I swear it wasn’t my intention…” 


[P-Pause…] 


[He pauses, lips parted in slight surprise] 


“You say it’s no trouble? Oh, but I-”. 


[Pause…] 


*...F-Five… F…Four…* 


“...You want to get to know me better anyway…? Aha… Why on Earth would you want to do that?” 


[Pause!] 


“Eheh, sorry… I didn’t mean to phrase it like that. I just… I’m boring as Hell, you know? I work a 9 to 5, I come home, reheat some leftovers, maybe say hi to you if you’re around, water my plants, and then pass out in a haze of post-job misery.” 


[Pause?] 


“Oh, it’s nothing special. I’m an arborist. I work for the national park system, do a bit of greenhouse restoration work.” 


[Pause <3] 


[He smiles softly] 


“I’d noticed your plants looked healthy, yes… And I’d love to, ah, show you around the park some time. You are pretty new to the city and all, yeah?” 


[Pause…] 


[He tilts his head a bit] 


“...What brought you out here, if I may ask? A big city, especially one like Peregrine, doesn’t exactly seem to suit someone like you. No offense.” 


[Pause…] 


“Ah. Out of a bad relationship and into the fire… Always a fun scenario. I’m so sorry to hear that.” 


[Pause~] 


[He snorts into his coffee] 


“Pfft! Sorry! Sorry… I, ah… Jesus, that joke was darker than the coffee… Did you seriously just shrug and say, ‘At least it only took me one ‘love tap’ to learn’?” 


[Pause…] 


“...I love you.” 


[. . . ] 


[He blinks, expression not changing. The blink is long, as if he’s trying to confirm if he’s asleep or awake] 


“...That came out as badly as it could have. What I was trying to say was ‘I love your sense of humor’.” 


[P-Pause…] 


[He snorts again] 


“...I appreciate your humor being darker than the void, my friend. But, humor aside, I hope you know that you never deserved any kind of abuse. Right?” 


[Pause.] 


“...Right?” 


[...Pause.] 


[He gives a sympathetic smile] 


*Three…* 


“...Sort of, hm? Well, that’s an honest answer.” 


[Pause…] 


“...I think you deserve everything good that life has to offer. I genuinely wish the world were like a bookstore, where you could browse and select any interest, material, item, or fixation at your leisure. And I wish the same feeling of elevated wonder followed you, never growing old.” 


[. . . ] 


[He blinks before he lets out a genuine laugh] 


“Sorry… I, ah, don’t mean to laugh, it’s just… The look on your face and how you muttered, ‘Aw, fuck, dude’ like that…” 


[... Pause <3] 


[He laughs again, and you laugh with him] 


[Pause…?] 


“Of course, you can ask a question. Heavens know that we’re being vulnerable this fine morning.” 


[Pause?] 


[He smiles, calm] 


*...Two… O-Oh no…* 


“My name? Ah…” 


[...Pause?] 


“No, you didn’t offend. It’s a fair question. ‘Vee’ is a strange name to present oneself with.” 


[His smile grows strained] 


“Truthfully, there’s no interesting story. I suffered an accident a few years back and lost a lot of my memory of my life before the accident. It took me a good few years to get back to where I could even do my job… I’ve accepted that most of it is gone. Part of that hole is my name. All I can remember of it is that it starts with ‘V’. Any time I look at my ID or birth certificate, my brain won’t remember the rest. I am simply ‘Vee’ because it is what I am.” 


[Pause…] 


[You put your hand on his before you think better. His eyes follow your movement] 


“...Your hand is quite warm.” 


[P-Pause…] 


“No. You’re OK to have put your hand on mine, alright?” 


[He gives you an odd smile, as though he’s a cat toying with a mouse] 


“...Hmhm… Bashful little thing, aren’t you?” 


[P-Pause…] 


“That is fair, we are both exhausted, and the coffee hasn’t kicked in yet…” 


[He glances around your apartment briefly, his intense eyes ringed in fatigue] 


[Pause…?] 


“Why am I glancing about? Oh, just… Appreciating the little details of your place is all. Trying not to fall back asleep on this ridiculously comfortable couch and impose on you even more. Trying, even harder, not to say something insanely stupid.” 


*O-One- oh, you’ve done it now, you idiot*


[Pause…?] 


[He meets your gaze, and your heart begins to thunder. You can’t tell if it’s his expression or the coffee kicking in, at this point] 


“I have to say it since I brought it up, hmmm? Oh, my…” 


[SFX: Him taking a sip of his coffee] 


[He takes a sip of his coffee, still oddly calm, no matter how thick the tension grows between the  two of you] 


“...Some small, dumb part of my brain wants to suggest both of us just cuddling up on the couch and going back to sleep.” 


[. . . ] 


“...There. Now you see why I didn’t-”. 


[Pause…] 


[The coffee isn’t hitting for you. It’s all a little too bizarre, and you speak without thinking] 


“... You think that sounds nice…?” 


[. . . ] 


[Pause-Fill for the now serious tension between the two] 


[He studies you for a moment before he sets his cup down and shrugs off the biggest shirt you had to give him, like it’s a gym shirt, exposing his chest] 


[SFX: The above] 


“There we are. I appreciate the shirt, but I prefer sleeping shirtless, if that’s alright…?” 


[. . . ] 


“...I don’t know where the scars come from, love. Sorry.” 


[P-Pause…] 


“Oh.” 


[He laughs, reclining on the couch so you have room to join him] 


“The abs. Yes. My work is pretty physical.” 


[P…Pause] 


“We’re both saying a lot of dumb things this fine morning, love… C’mon.” 


[SFX: Him patting the couch / the Listener joining him gradually] 


“There we are…” 


[...Pause?] 


“Why do I call you ‘love’?” 


[His arms wrap around you, bringing the blanket with them] 


“I want to…” 


[. . . ] 


[P-Pause] 


[He chuckles sleepily and lets you find your comfort spot against him, unbothered by any tossing or turning] 


“Sleep well, my dear… I have you.” 


[. . . ] 


[SFX: Fade out on them snuggling together to whatever ambiance / BGM VA sees fit]

My father (63) has been an alcoholic my entire life & is one of those semi-functioning types that can hold a job & hasn’t had a DUI since the 90s. He is so visibly unwell right now and it’s so hard to be around him for any extended period of time.

My mother initiated a separation a few years ago and this has been the longest divorce proceedings for two people with very few assets and no minor children that has probably ever taken place. They’re finally in a position now where they’re getting the house ready to sell to split their sole joint asset. 

Since the divorce started my dad has gotten progressively worse—he goes to concerts and stays out all night, leaves bottles all over the house, drives drunk—the works. When he’s not around his enablers he calls me, my mom, and my sister and goes on these rants about how once the house sells he’ll probably kill himself.

Yesterday I was at the house helping to clear things out and he had a noose just out on the coffee table while I’m there with my 3 year old and 5 month old. He then told me all about how he had an affair when I was 14 but my Mom doesn’t know so I can’t tell her…wtf.

I spent all morning today calling behavioral health services in my state to figure out how I can get him into involuntary treatment based on the S/I & there are no good options—basically because he knows how to hold it together long enough each day to semi-function & he’s smart enough to know how to answer questions to avoid an involuntary hold.

My mom wants us to keep a closer eye on him & I can’t tell her I have absolutely no desire to be around him based on the affair information he disclosed yesterday…because then I’d have to tell her & as shitty a husband and father he’s been we always thought he at least had some integrity.

I have spent years reframing all these shitty things about him to myself & others as a form of self-protection—things like, “he’s an alcoholic and is sick but he has always loved my mom and his children more than anything in the world” or, “he’s an alcoholic but he has a strong moral foundation and operates with integrity in everything he does”. 

Ugh, I’ve been sober for 14 years, have never had a legal drink, and I’m happily married with 3 kids. My father has seen all the gifts that sobriety has given me and it’s not enough. Being a grandfather is not enough. 

Finally, and maybe the worst part, is that a BIG part of why I stay sober is because of my children and how much I love them. They’re enough of a reason for me not to drink, so why wasn’t I enough of a reason for him?

I’m going to get to a meeting tonight but needed to put this somewhere. I couldn’t hold onto it anymore.

So, I immediately made attention to it by the coworkers, also making sure to get loud and keep an eye on him.

After lots of research and measuring, I've found that the ideal coffee table length should be about 2/3 the length of your couch. For a standard 84-inch sofa, you'll want a coffee table that's roughly 54-56 inches long. This proportion creates a balanced look while leaving enough space to move around.

Height is crucial too. Your coffee table should be within 1-2 inches of your couch's seat height. Most couches are 17-19 inches high, so aim for a coffee table between 16-18 inches tall. This makes reaching for drinks or remotes comfortable without stretching or hunching over.

For width, I recommend leaving 18 inches between the table and seating for easy movement. With sectionals or L-shaped couches, rectangular or oval tables usually work better than square ones. They provide more surface area and better accessibility from all seating positions.

I found some great options here that follow these guidelines: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

Consider these factors when choosing your table:

- Shape: Rectangle tables complement long couches better than square ones
- Material: Glass tops make rooms feel larger, while wood adds warmth
- Storage: Some tables offer hidden compartments for blankets and magazines
- Style: Match your table's design with existing furniture pieces

Remember to measure your space carefully. You want enough room to walk around comfortably while maintaining proper proportions. A too-small table will look awkward, while an oversized one can overwhelm the room.

I've seen many people struggle with disproportionate furniture arrangements. If you're in doubt, grab some cardboard and cut it to your desired table size. Place it in your living room to visualize how it fits before making a purchase.

For those looking to browse a variety of size options that work well with large couches, check out this collection: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

One final tip: don't forget to consider your living room's traffic flow. Even with the perfect size table, you'll want to ensure there's enough space for people to walk around comfortably. I recommend at least 30 inches of walking space around the main pathways in your room.",1,1753112364.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

1m5m8u8,https://i.redd.it/30feye43z8ef1.png,Desert Son Part V,"Im walking back into the Apple Valley air from the warehouse. I out did myself. Was able to get everything done and out by lunch. Even called the temp agency saying the job wasn’t a right fit for me. Now need to burn that bridge. They were a good cover. 

I get back in my car with the box of cloves and the candle I snatched from the disposition pallet. I just sit there for a moment, letting the silence thicken, trying to gather my thoughts.

I absentmindedly turn the key in the ignition and head toward the 15 freeway. I can’t believe I almost let a few scribbled lines on some boxes drag me back to everything I walked away from. I made it real clear to Thomas, I don’t take jobs that have anything to do with demons.

I flick the blinker on as I merge onto the onramp. I need to calm down. In all fairness, this wasn’t even real witchcraft. If anything, it looked like someone was dabbling in alchemy. Technically not witchcraft, but same ballpark as far as I’m concerned. Either way, I wasn’t paid to solve that. I was paid to get proof, and I got it.

Still, I can’t help but wonder, who’s using alchemy, and why? What’s the endgame?

I take the next exit and pull into a gas station. I grab the clipboard from the passenger seat and flip through the mold reports. Looks like every moldy shipment was signed off by the same guy. Jim Bear.

Says here he used to work in Non Con, the department for items too bulky or fragile for the conveyors.

I bet his name’s in the candle report too.

Just as I’m reaching for the next page, my phone rings. I answer without checking who it is.

“Hello?”

“Jamie! Just checking in. How’s it going?”

It’s Tommy.

How much do I tell him? I don’t want to tip my hand too early, I don’t even know how much he’s keeping from me. I hate thinking it, but I can’t rule it out.

“Is that doubt I hear in your tone, Thomas?” I say, trying to sound like I’m setting up for a punchline. “I got the proof of them ignoring protocol, and I have evidence of what might be causing it.”

“I knew you’d knock it out of the park. The client only wanted one of those, and you got both.” His voice is too smooth, like he’s testing me.

“Where do you want to meet up?” I ask, then follow up quick, “And am I getting paid on delivery, or do I have to wait for a check to clear?”

“I forgot you like things upfront. Usual spot. Coffee’s better this time of night anyway.”

When I take jobs, I have one rule. One I live and die by, trust nobody.

It stings not being able to trust Tommy. But this is a job. Personal feelings stay off the clock.

I pull into the café parking lot. With me are the mold report and the evidence box. I order two coffees and take my regular seat by the back window.

As I sip, my mind drifts, not to my mom, not to high school. This time, I think about my cousin. The one who grew up in my house. One day his mom dropped him off and never picked him up. After that, I called him my brother.

The last clear memory I have of him? I made him breakfast. It was a week after I turned eighteen. Mom had been committed to the state hospital, and we were staying with our grandparents. Once I knew I could go, I told him I had to leave. That Grandma would look after him, and Grandpa would make sure he had what he needed. I was gone before the coffee finished brewing.

I haven’t seen him since. I hoped I might at least run into him at the funeral home during Mom’s viewing. No luck. Maybe he left too.

I sigh and let the memory slip back into the dark.

The bell over the café door rings. I glance up. It’s Tommy. He’s holding an envelope with a noticeable bulge. That’s something, at least.

He walks over, we shake hands, and I motion for him to sit.

“For getting the evidence and the report, you earned a little bonus,” he says, sliding the envelope across the table.

I take it and hand over the box with the report on top.

“Thanks.”

“You’re not gonna count it? At least open it and pretend,” he says, almost whining. “Let me gloat for hooking you up.”

“This is why I don’t do business with friends,” I tell him. “I do the job, I get paid. If I count it in front of you, that’s disrespect. Like I think you’d stiff me.”

“I didn’t mean it like that,” he says, suddenly defensive.

“Then how did you mean it?”

He looks at me hard, like he’s weighing something.

“Look, you’ve been gone a long time. Nobody could get ahold of you. Things changed. The kind of jobs you want, they’re not easy to find anymore.”

“What are you talking about?” I ask, even though I don’t want to know.

“You fucked up big time when you left. That cousin of yours, the one you left at your grandparents, he sold your secrets. And not just to moody teens like you used to when you were one of them. He went to bad places. Talked to worse people. People you knew.”

I see the heat rising behind his eyes.

“Bullshit. He didn’t know anything I was doing.” The words taste bitter as they leave my mouth.

“Then why did he have a lighter!?” Tommy grabs the box and report, then stands. “I’ll call you in the morning.”

Fuck. I’m going to have to show my hand after all.

“Someone is using alchemy at that warehouse.” I just let it sit there.

Tommy sits back down and stares daggers at me. “What do you mean someone is using alchemy?”

Before there was chemistry, there was alchemy. Where witchcraft used herbs and shit for rituals, alchemy used them for their property makeups. Combine stuff and see what happens. Nine times out of ten, alchemists kill themselves breathing in poison they didn’t mean to make.

What makes alchemy as dangerous as witchcraft to me is that if one of those potions goes airborne, a lot of people could get hurt. At least with witchcraft, you're putting your own life on the line.

“I get paid to bring you evidence. I’m not paid to start spewing out theories.” I take a sip of my coffee and breathe deep, in and out. “That’s why I wasn’t going to say anything.”

“Cut the shit. You delivered and got paid. The job is done. We’re no longer speaking like we have a contract. Get me?” He punctuates the point by finally drinking the coffee I got for him when I arrived.

“Some guy named Jim Bear seems to be doing experiments. Either the boxes or the stuff in them has a mold. They get shipped with a demonic candle, and something in the wax accelerates the mold growth. Must happen when the wax heats up, even just a little.”

I can see in his eyes he’s struggling with what I’m saying. “You got all that from just one visit? Before you even clocked out for lunch, no less?”

“I used to be good at what I did, Tommy. I used to be able to step into a city and tell you how many demons influenced the population. What concoction the jackasses used to lure demons to them.” Son of a bitch. I can feel the flicker of pride trying to ignite. I better check myself. “I refuse to do that anymore. I won’t participate in it anymore.”

Tommy is quiet. Not a loss-for-words kind of quiet, but something heavier.

“Then help me expose these bastards. You made everyone think you were untouchable. Then finally, when your secret got out, everyone wanted to try and be ‘A Desert Son.’”

I didn’t even think about that. It was a stupid title I made up. Something to sound cool. Coyote said I needed a name people would remember. I didn’t think anyone would take it so serious.

“That’s dangerous and you know it.” I down the rest of my coffee and set the mug down a little too hard.

“Jaime, they already got your mom.”

I have been noticing things moving around inside my apartment a lot recently. I’ll give a few examples:

1. I washed all my dishes and left them in a rack to dry over night. Next day after work I saw 1 plate and a fork and knife in the sink. 

2. I often turn off my TV while watching Disney+, and if I turn it back on it starts back on from the Disney+ Home Screen. Except, some random times I will turn on my TV and it will start at the YouTube Home Screen. I barely watch YouTube on TV. And this would only happen if the TV was turned off while watching YT.

3. The kitchen paper towel roll has been getting used up pretty fast. I try to not use too many kitchen paper towels as I also have a reusable towel for general counter wiping.

4.  Some of my clothes will randomly appear on top of the bed, or on the floor, when I don’t remember leaving any clothes on the bed/floor. 

5. One of my beer cans was missing from the fridge this weekend. 

6. I found a cucumber wrapped in plastic wrap on my fridge this morning. I did not buy this cucumber, or wrap it in plastic. 

7. Coffee mug placement is often out of order. I store them in the cabinet from size small to large and I’m very particular about this order.

There’s a few more, but none of these things sound too extreme and are all relatively harmless. There’s also a possibility that I could’ve done them and forgotten (which is out of habit for me, and I am not very forgetful). I am also relatively young and don’t have any known health concerns. 

I’ve had a doorbell cam for over a year and I checked the feed for last 2-3 weeks and the only entry (other than me) was building maintenance guy last Friday who came to check my fire alarms and AC filters (and he had informed me before coming). 

I don’t have cameras inside the house. The only other (possible) entry would be if someone jumps into my balcony from the roof, and somehow unlocked the balcony sliding door (which would be hard to do). 

I have checked every door and every room, under the bed, behind the laundry.. and there’s no one. There is no attic space either. I just found a large garbage bag laying in the floor behind the laundry machine. But this could be from anything.

My daily use is brewing a big(ish) pot every morning. Ratio is 1100ml to 69g coffee. I have a subscription to Tandem Coffee (more on this later) and grind daily using the MM KM5 grinder. Grind setting is typically 5 to 6.5 (MM recommends 4-6).

Most of the time, this works great. But about 25% of the time, I have terrible issues with overflowing and have to constantly pause the brew to prevent the grinds from escaping over the top of the filter. I have tested tons of different variables and the only thing I can pinpoint as the cause is the coffee. The problem seems to be 100% correlated with African coffees from Tandem. Even when I grinde these coffees more course (7ish), the problem remains. These are light roasted beans and I just refuse to go all the way up to a 9 or 10.

Has anyone else noticed this issue with light roasted, African coffees?

1m5m4ms,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m5m4ms,The Best Trail Ride by Far!,"My brother and I set out from Pittsburgh last Wednesday and rolled into Cumberland by Saturday. Big thanks to everyone here who chimed in with advice—it all paid off. The trail was in incredible shape. Seriously impressive. Shout-out to the volunteers clearing downed trees and fixing the washed-out sections after the recent rains. You made this ride possible.

Wildlife-wise, not much to report—just deer and the occasional possum (or opossum, depending on how correct you want to be). But that was expected. The real star of the show? The views. Absolutely stunning. I can only imagine how breathtaking it gets when the leaves start turning in the fall. And nothing beats the sight of the Continental Divide. We averaged 18 mph from there to Cumberland, which made the three-day buildup totally worth it.

Now, a quick cautionary tale about hydration: we bailed on our plan because of the rain. It felt refreshing, and we didn’t want to stop and drink just to get soaked. Rookie mistake. I ended up in the hospital overnight with an IV cocktail because I arrived in Cumberland light-headed and confused. Totally preventable. In training rides, I stick to one liter per hour—rain or shine—even if it means peeing more often than a toddler. (Thankfully, as a guy, any tree will do.)

West Newton was a peaceful stop, aside from the trains rattling by every hour overnight. Our B&B was right next to the trail, so it came with a soundtrack. The Outpost had everything we needed: a burger, a beer, a place to crash. Fox’s Pizza Den sealed the deal. And across the board—from Pittsburgh to Cumberland—the people were fantastic. Friendly, warm, and ready to chat.

A quick story that stuck with me: the woman running the B&B in West Newton saw a homeless man sheltering under a picnic table during the storm. She brought him water, food, even gave him cash. We offered him a few spare T-shirts, but he smiled and said she’d already given him what he needed. Hope he made it back to Wyano safe.

Ohiopyle was a highlight. The mix of trail riders and river people made it a lively spot for people-watching and conversation. We had a good laugh watching a young guy on an e-bike try to impress his date with a wheelie. (Spoiler: e-bikes don’t wheelie well.) The food at the Twisted Spoke was excellent, and the breakfast sandwiches at Ohiopyle Coffee Company were hands-down the best I’ve had—fresh, hot, and just what we needed.

We also owe a big thanks to the guy who shuttled us between Markleton and Rockwood. Great conversation, took care of the bikes, and reminded us why supporting the nonprofits maintaining these trails matters. I’m now a year-round donor.

Myersdale had small-town charm. We walked off the ride to shake out the lactic acid but ended up grabbing dinner at Sheetz. No complaints—it hit the spot.

So yeah—you were all right. The views were amazing. The people were kind. And the whole ride was a much-needed escape. We disconnected, we pedaled, we lived a little. I’ll be back, probably every few months, especially once fall hits.

Stay safe out there. Keep riding. And hydrate.

She did a scratch test on my back and said the only food I’m allergic to is peanuts according to the test, but the only true test is to eat wheat, milk, and eggs and see what happens. I’ve since been able to reintroduce wheat and milk (with lactaid pills… turns out I’m definitely lactose intolerant) but had issues with egg. It’s been upsetting my stomach and making me cough. 
I think I am just intolerant to eggs but I’m still testing things out to see what my limits are. 
My big question… what baked goods that you would get at a coffee shop are typically made without eggs or with small amounts of egg? Many breads are made without egg, but what about croissants, bagels, donuts, etc.? I’m having lots of fun eating foods I haven’t been able to eat in forever, and I still want to test the egg, but want to know what recipes typically have LESS amounts of egg in them. I’m having a hard time finding this on Google.",1,1753111887.0,FoodAllergies,3,1.0,False
1m5m1bi,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1m5m1bi/when_the_mountains_hungerpart_2/,When the Mountains Hunger-Part 2,"Bill, in the meantime, had processed the new prisoner from yesterday, who had now identified himself as Joseph Carter. He wouldn’t say where he was from; however, he just mumbled “Not from around here” under his breath. Burt decided to focus his attention on him first, before he was slated to stand trial in front of the town “court”.

“Just for the record, can you tell me your name once again and where you’re from?” Burt asked, sitting down in front of the jail cell with a pen and paper.

“I already told you… My name is Joseph Carter, and it ain’t your business where I’m from, you wouldn’t know where it was even if I told you.” Joseph growled at him from under his messy, unkempt, dirty blonde hair, head lowered, looking down. “It don’t matter what I tell you, you still ain’t gonna let me go.”

“I’m not.” Burt agreed solemnly, “You still have to answer before the people of this town for what you did. For endangering their safety.”

“Yeah…” Joseph chuckled dryly, painfully. “And they're gonna kill me for it, you’re gonna kill me for it, so why bother.” Burt thought his words over carefully before continuing.

“There is another matter. Right now, we've just got you on attempted burglary and trespassing charges, but we’ve also got something else going on. Murder. If you’re not going to talk, then at least give me one good reason not to just pin it on you.” Burt spoke, putting his gambit into play. He could see a wave of fear briefly reflected in Joseph’s eyes, but his calm, deathly cocky demeanor soon returned.

“You ain’t gonna do that. I know the likes of you, cop,” he said. “Y’all got a serious hard-on for law and order, for appearances. I ain’t killed nobody, but hell, what’s my word mean to you anyway? Besides, whatcha gonna do when a few days, a week after you do me in, the killings start up again? Who you gon’ blame then?”

“Well, that all depends…” Burt said, prodding forward despite the prisoner’s rebuttal, “That’s only true if you really are innocent. What were you doing and where were you two days ago?”

“I was in the woods, in my tent, starving,” Joseph replied. “How you gonna corroborate that alibi?”

“And where is your camp?” Burt retorted, answering Joseph’s question with one of his own.

“In the foothills on the west side of town, right behind the abandoned house with the big ole bus parked outside. You know where that is?” Joseph replied with a surprising level of detail. “You gonna walk out there and see what I’ve been up to?”

“Yes on both accounts.” Burt nodded, getting up to leave. He knew that house quite well as he had passed by it frequently.

“How you know I don’t have a few buddies of mine there lying in wait there, ready to blast your thin blue line ass?” Joseph smiled sickly, his yellow-stained teeth on full display.

“In that case, I doubt you would have told me.” Burt fired back, but inwardly admitted that he didn’t know, and that he had no way of knowing until it was too late. Still, a job was a job. He got into the patrol car and headed off down the road.

He was headed off to the outskirts of the town, where the houses grew rarer and more sparse, and where rusted through old muscle cars, the pinnacle of Detroit engineering from a different age that just hovered on the brink of living memory, lay discarded as if some giant child had left his Hotwheels laying around and then never came back for them.

In the hills, the rusting spires of former coal mines loomed high like the steeples of abandoned cathedrals, waiting, longing, yearning to see once more their congregations return and to hear the hymns of picks and drills, extracting the black anthracite ichor of the land.

After some time, he finally arrived at his destination, the remains of a nice house, with its roof now partially caved in and its windows long since broken, with dead weeds and vines still clinging to the peeling away siding. In the driveway stood a bus, the same type used by schools and prisons, but this one seemed to be repainted gray at some point by hand. Perhaps at some point, the original inhabitants of the house wanted to remake it into a camper van. Whatever their intentions may have been, the hulking elephant-like beast would certainly never move again, with all of its tires flat. He parked the Ford Explorer beside it and carefully stepped out, peering out into the treeline just beyond the house.

By now, the sun had already begun to set, lighting up the sky in a wistful shade of reddish-yellow and casting long, deep shadows behind each tree. He drew his revolver and, holding it at the ready, advanced slowly, step after step, over the thick layer of snow carpeting the overgrown lawn. Moving around the side of the house, he fairly quickly spotted a small trail running through the woods, with footprints leading in and out several times, indicating that either Joseph or his potential accomplices had indeed been there recently.

Step after step. The snow crunched with each movement. The birds didn’t sing, and even the wind had stopped blowing. Everything was dead silent. Everything, the trees, the birds, the rocks, and whoever else was lurking in that small clearing he could see just up ahead were all waiting for him, watching his every step. Crunch. He tightened his grip on the gun, his finger gingerly resting on the trigger.

The clearing was empty save for a cheap, generic camping tent, partially camouflaged by a tarp hung loosely to one side. It was tattered by the elements, the flimsy aluminum poles bent under the weight of the snow overtop. The remains of a campfire could be seen close by, with the snow melted in a small radius around it. In the middle, remnants of some sort of carcass could be seen. All about, the snow was marked with countless footprints, maybe one person’s, maybe several. Cautiously, Burt approached, his gaze and attention torn between the bloody mess near the fire pit and scanning the treeline. His heart was beating so loudly in his chest, he could scarcely distinguish between his own heartbeat and the sound of crunching snow under someone else’s feet. He was scared not just of a hostile encounter but of the thought of any encounter, out here.

It was clearly the remains of a large animal, picked entirely clean, the cracked and broken ribs and spine being the only recognizable parts left. He hoped it was a deer. Cautiously, he stepped towards the tent. The front door was zipped shut, concealing whatever or potentially whoever still lay inside.

“Police!” he exclaimed, his voice sounding shaky and unconvincing. “If anyone is in there, identify yourselves and come out slowly, with your hands above your head!”

It was just a formality, after all, if anyone was there, they would have almost certainly heard him clumsily stomping through the snow a mile away, and would have had countless moments to shoot or attack him already if they so wanted to. At this reassuring thought, he relaxed slightly, but not enough to lower the barrel of his gun.

Peaking through the semi-transparent canopy of the tent, he could see a mess of various equipment scattered about inside, but thankfully, no people. Zipping open the door, he crouched down and took a closer look inside. A chill ran up his spine.

There were two sets of sleeping bags, two moldy and dirty inflatable mattresses, and two backpacks, but only one winter coat and only one set of boots.

He immediately stood up and spun around, swivelling his gun at the treeline, his mind reeling with the possible explanations as his body acted on pure instinct and reflexes. Now more than ever, the woods seemed so alien and hostile, the trees all watching him, and it seemed like momentarily, should he turn his back in any one direction, the trees there would begin to immediately inch their way forward towards him from behind, closing the loop tighter and tighter around him, suffocating him.

It was then that he looked again at the carcass lying on the now blackened charcoal and ash of the fire. Although, of course, he would have to have it tested and examined, he already knew in his heart of hearts that it was no deer.

He had radioed in to Kody for help, who was thankfully not busy, and together they combed the campsite, bagged up the remains of the unknown John Doe and the belongings from the tent, taking copious Polaroid photographs of everything beforehand.

Back at the station, Burt sat there, his face buried in his own hands, just breathing, in and out, trying to calm his racing heart that was desperately attempting to catch up to his mind, which was going a million miles an hour. Every inhale felt like an eternity, every exhale a slow loss. Again, and again. Why here, why now, why to him? He couldn’t bear to go down and examine the remains, much less face down the monster Joseph Carter to prove what was already obvious. Maybe it was fear, or simply exhaustion, he simply couldn’t bring himself to do it. At least he was already in custody. He didn’t even hear the ticking of the clock, much less Bill’s approaching footsteps.

“Hey man, you look like shit,” Bill said, standing over him and extending him a hand. “You up for a drink?”

“There’s so much to do…” Burt murmured in half-hearted protest.

“And that is what exactly? We did it, we caught the bastard, ain’t much else we can do except catalogue all the evidence and then present it before the judge on Monday. The facts speak for themselves. In the meantime, he isn’t going anywhere.” Bill said with a tone of voice that betrayed just how equally tired he was.

“Alright, I suppose it can’t hurt.” Burt sighed, getting up and putting on his coat. Still, he cast a quick, terrified look at the doors leading to the small jail and the basement, as if he could feel the man that was sitting there secreting and oozing his menace, his evil from in between the bars, letting it pool in the form of some black goo which will flow out and escape or reshape itself into some new horror. He shuddered. Maybe Ada Brady was right after all.

He and Bill made their way down to Dutch’s Bar, a couple of streets over. It was a nice, hole-in-the-wall place, where even though a no-smoking sign hung on the front door, which had been there for quite some time, your nostrils were still assaulted by the smell of smoke as soon as you swung open the doors. The windows were largely occupied by an air conditioner, which just barely chugged along. Along the edges of the ceiling, dimming neon lights cast the place in a colorful, interesting light, illuminating the walls, which were covered in old 80s movie posters, various sports memorabilia, and even a couple of model planes that hung above. The space was populated by several other patrons, most of whom Burt easily recognized as locals. Beer was a cheap and easy source of calories, cheaper than most other food these days, even watered down as it was. Besides, its main function was, of course, to numb the pain, numb the cold, like a pleasurable microdose of hypothermia.

He and Bill made their way over to the bar, each ordering a shot of some simple locally brewed whisky. While they were waiting, they both couldn’t help but overhear a conversation going on loudly beside them, where a few local men were questioning another man, a traveler who had evidently come from down south and was going to continue the trek northwards again tomorrow. Where he was coming from, and where he was going, they didn’t quite catch.

“How are things down south?” Asked one of the locals, “Buck” Richards, a surly, but generally friendly old timer who could’ve passed for a biker Santa Claus. “I gotta cousin out in Chambersburg, was wondering if you passed through there.”

“Yeah, I’m actually three days out of there,” said the stranger, clearing his throat. “They seem to be doing alright, everything is more or less in good shape, there’s just a lot of rumors going around.”

“Like what?” spoke up Guy Jennings, right beside him, a rowdy, frequent visitor to the bar here. “They’re always making bullshit up to cause a stir and to make themselves feel more important. The only thing really going on down there is those fucking Baltimore refugees mucking up the place.”

“I dunno…” the stranger shrugged. “They say there's a group of ‘merry men’ two dozen strong up in Michaux Forest. They launch raids once a week or so, stealing food, cattle, even some of the last working big rigs. I was told they stood up some of the local militia to come out and try to hunt those bastards down, but they just lay low in the woods, and it's impossible to find them in there.” Here, the stranger looked around, making sure he had the audience’s full attention before continuing, but now with a hushed tone. “There are even rumors going around that the Feds are going to try and take back Harrisburg. The locals have been seeing strange lights on and around Blue Ridge Summit. I think they’re finally going to show their faces. Hell, who knows, maybe they already took Waynesboro as we speak.”

“Fuck…” slurred Guy. “I thought those cocksuckers would have all eaten themselves alive in that concrete hole in the ground of theirs by now.”

“With language like that, shouldn’t you be somewhere else?” Bill couldn’t help but interject.

“What’s the matter, pig?” Guy turned, his face red, visibly fuming at the implication. “Did you get offended on behalf of your buddies?” Burt watched his movements carefully, his own hand already resting on the handle of his revolver, but for all his bluster, Guy thankfully knew better than to try some bullshit and kept both his hands above the bar wrapped tightly around his glass.

“I’m just saying, it's an awful lotta talk.” Bill continued with a devilish grin. Guy looked like he wanted to drop something devilish on Bill, a cornucopia of insults of various calibers just on the tip of his tongue, but noticing Burt’s hand on his gun, and old Dutch reaching with one hand under the bar, he decided against it.

“The only good bluebelly is a damn dead one.” Guy finally muttered to himself in a defeated manner, turning back to his drink.

“Did you really have to do that?” Burt asked his friend worriedly once the few tense moments had passed, and a slightly more relaxed atmosphere returned to the bar.

“You know me, I gotta get my kicks in somehow.” Bill offered a very tired smile. “Helps me let off some steam and get my mind off things. Besides, you know I got it way worse from them good old boys when I was growing up. I could almost see it on his face now, him reaching to call me a slur.”

“Not the only thing he was reaching for,” Burt interjected, “And you know it. No more corpses in the basement, god forbid it's you,” he said, and he could feel tears beginning to well up in his eyes, the whiskey already doing its work. Bill sat next to him in silence for a few moments, as Burt struggled not to lose his composure, flashes of all that he had seen the past two days jumping through his mind at lightning speed.

“You can’t let it get to you like that.” Bill finally spoke up, his voice quiet but deadly serious. “That’s what I learned from dealing with types like him my whole life.” He said, gesturing over his back at Guy, who was drunkenly stumbling out the door. “I know you, old buddy, I know how much you love your Norman Rockwell set to the tune of Johnny Cash, but that existed only for a brief few decades because of a very specific set of circumstances. Hell, it wasn’t even for everyone, not quite for folks like me, that's for sure. And yet, here you are, losing your head over the fact that the world’s just going back to the natural state of things.”

“An innocent girl is dead, and here you are, talking about that’s the way things are?” Burt asked, indignantly. “It’s our damn job to stop that from happening, and we failed, Bill, we failed…”

“And I’m telling you that really is the way things are. There’s always been darkness in this world. I know you’re religious, so it's the devil or demons for you, but for others, it could be evil spirits, djinn, or whatever have you. But really, it doesn’t care for your value judgments, it just is. It's old. It's as much a part of nature as the mountains. It's always been there in the minds of men and women, and always will be. Accept that.” Bill slowly philosophized, “And as for our jobs, well, we’re doing them, aren’t we? We caught the bastard, but you can’t bring back the dead, no matter how many tears you spill. We’re here to serve justice, and justice is only based on revenge.” 

The conversation moved on to other topics, and before they knew it, they had finished four shots each, and both were feeling it. Burt signaled to Dutch, who brought them the bill. They split the total, slapping down some of the new-style dollars. Dutch counted the money and gave a thumbs up to signal that it was all clear, leaving them free to go.

They sauntered out of the bar and onto the bridge crossing the little creek, where their paths split, with Burt heading off in one direction and Bill in another. Still, Burt lingered for a moment, looking down and listening to the running, pitch black waters.

“I wish we were young again, Bill.” Burt muttered, “Can’t even say I’m getting old, just feeling more and more tired with every passing day, like I’m carrying too many memories around on my back. I still can’t help but look back towards simpler, better days…”

“It’s all water under the bridge, man. It turned the waterwheel of the mill, it powered the factory, it served as the steam for the trains, but it doesn’t stop. It keeps flowing. It flowed away and took all the best years with it.” Bill replied solemnly, patting his friend across the back. “Get some rest, and then it's back to work again tomorrow…” he said, before turning and walking off into the night.

He didn’t remember how he went home, opened the door, or collapsed on his bed. The only thing he remembered was the kaleidoscope of images that swirled through his dreams like a whirlpool pulling down a ship into the dark, endless abyss. 

He dreamt of a girl he had once known, about their last night together, the summer before she went to college, and he would enlist. He had shamefully carried these memories of her, locked away deep in his subconsciousness, through years of a fruitless marriage, and now they had returned to haunt him. He remembered borrowing his father’s beloved square-body Chevy and taking her out for a date in it. They had gotten dinner, but afterwards had retired to a small, secluded little vista called Cedar Point overlooking the valley. All beneath them, the lights of the city sparkled and glimmered with all the joy and liveliness of a million multicolored Christmas lights, and all above them the stars twinkled with the promises of uncounted possibilities. 

He had laid out a couple of blankets in the truck’s bed, and they had lain there, their arms and legs intertwined around one another. She always wanted to be an astrophysicist, and she had even won a substantial scholarship for it at an out-of-state college. She lay there, beside him, and pointed out to him her favorite constellations and even the minuscule little dot that supposedly was the then-new ISS. He never saw it of course, nor did the actual stars themselves have any real value to him, but he believed her wholeheartedly when she pointed every little detail, because to him, the most important thing was the way her eyes gleamed and burned with the unquenchable fires of life, which burned with dreams of distant worlds and with such a brightness that they could outshine even the grandest supernovas. He remembered the rest of the night, he remembered her touch, her taste on his tongue, but above all, he remembered her warmth, radiating from every inch of her skin, emanating from those mesmerizing eyes, from somewhere even deeper within her soul. He wanted to scream, to yell through the dream then that he was going to go with her, that he didn’t need to be a cop or a soldier, that he was going to go learn some other trade, or do anything else, but that he will be with her, but for some reason it felt like he was choking, that his throat was closing up and he couldn’t utter a single sound.

The alarm clock rang.

“Please…” he finally managed to beg, but now to an empty room. He tried to forget the phantom pain of an old wound he thought had long since scarred over, forget her name, her face, her touch, and above all her warmth and her eyes. She was somewhere far, far away. He could only hope.

It was cold. It was time to go to work.

He got up, got dressed, and ate a breakfast of cold, soggy oats with a cup of muddy water with barely enough caffeine in it to justify the name “coffee”. He had the funeral of an innocent girl to attend.

Willow Street was an interesting place, very near to the center of town, where the houses were stacked as close together as possible without technically still being a single connected structure, each one trying to outshine its neighbors in terms of grandeur and “sophistication”. At least, that might have been the intention when the houses were brand new. By now, they had become quite run down and crumbling, as if the brick exteriors were just barely holding on to another. All it would seemingly take is one big bad wolf to come and blow it all down. Boarded-up windows, or those draped in ancient, dirty curtains, looked down on him as he drove past. The yards weren’t any better than the houses themselves, with dead flowers and long-since-abandoned landscaping projects surrounding faded political signs to the tune of “Love is Love” and “Hate Has No Home Here,” or various campaign posters which stood like the many charred pikes of vanquished armies, the distant reminders of some long-ago, now irrelevant conflict. The cramped little alleyways in between the walls accumulated impassable piles of trash or barely contained the vicious howling and barking of only half-domesticated dogs behind collapsing fencing.

Similarly, the church specified by Mrs. Morrison was easily identifiable, albeit a highly strange building full of contradictions. Architecturally, it seemed as though it couldn’t fully commit either to the brooding Gothic style, which perhaps harkened back far too closely to the rigidness of Catholic cathedrals, nor could it fully embrace the simplicity and blunt modesty of the little chapels erected by Puritan settlers. Even theologically, it confused him, specifically the little Gay and Trans Pride flags put in place beside the door. Not that he was against them or the people who identified with them or would discourage them from the faith, but that he simply couldn’t square his own fire-and-brimstone evangelical upbringing with this relatively newfound acceptance. From the Sunday services which he remembered attending with his parents, the church of that day would most likely call them sinners and Sodomites, condemning gay people to eternal suffering, much less openly celebrate them and invite them. 

After all, what could explain such a change? It isn’t as if some radical new information was uncovered; it was still the same old scripture, so why such a change? He didn’t want to think too deeply about it; he had done so once before in his life, and it only brought him turmoil and uncertainty. It was best to simply embrace the faith and let the word and compassion of the Lord guide him.

He parked the patrol car and stepped out. The days-old snow had now become a mushy gray sludge under his feet. He checked the scratched and scuffed face of his watch. The ceremony would begin shortly.

Swinging open one of the creaky doors and passing through the vestibule, he entered the nave, whose walls were painted a nauseous shade of greenish-beige. The coffin was already there, lying beside the altar, and many of the attendees were already there as well. It was a handful of the locals from around the block and those who knew the Morrisons personally. He recognized some of the faces, but he wished he didn’t. One woman was terribly familiar to him; he recalled he had booked her in one night when she was in high school for spray painting “ACAB” and “Defund the Police” onto the side of the station, done so carelessly that she didn’t even think to cover her face from the cameras. Now, of course, years had passed, and from what he heard, she now had children of her own, and all of a sudden, her demeanor changed. She glared at him from one of the pews as he passed, silently accusing him of not doing enough.

He sat down and slid towards the very end, leaning down and resting his forehead on the wooden back of the pew in front of him. It was noticeably warmer in the church, of course, than it was outside, but still not warm enough to actually feel comfortable or at ease. He closed his eyes for a moment, recollecting himself and his thoughts, and with a deep breath, composed himself for the service.

“We are gathered here today, on this bleak morning, to mourn the tragic loss of Elisa Morrison, a bright and promising young woman who by the actions of darkness had been taken from us before her time. And yet, she passes on now to the heavens, where she shall be in the embrace of our Lord and saviour, and where she also shall be reunited with her father.” The priest, an elderly but thin man, began. “It is in days such as these that I recall the words of Mathew who spoke, ‘Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.”

After the prayer was over, many of Elisa’s relatives and friends went up and made statements, recalling the moments of joy which Elisa had brought into their lives. Even her mother, who had managed to put herself together long enough to deliver a truly heart-rending speech recalling holding her daughter in her arms as a newborn for the first time, before falling to her knees and kissing the polished wood of the coffin, one last time.

He could barely hear most of the words, but he didn’t need to; he simply wept.

As the statements came to an end, it was time for the burial itself, and the pallbearers carefully lifted the coffin and carried it out through the door and towards the graveyard across the street. The procession followed suit, but Burt stayed. 

He had already done his part, paid his respects, and that was not the only reason he was here. He carefully watched all of the faces of the attendees, solemn and grim. Several of Elisa’s friends from school had come, but Julia still remained absent. As the procession exited, aside from himself and the priest, one more figure remained, Hunter Dugan. He rose from the pews where he was sitting closer to the front and approached the priest. The two had a brief interaction, which Burt could not overhear, but he saw the priest nod his head and lead the boy towards a small room in the back of the church.

A few minutes later, Hunter emerged, his eyes red from crying, still audibly sniffling. He quickened his pace and speedwalked out of the door, in a hurry to rejoin the funeral group, in the proccess casting a distrustful momentary glance at Burt. He got up and stepped over to the priest, who looked at him expectantly.

‘What did that young man just say to you?” Burt asked him directly, dropping all pretense.

“I’m afraid I cannot tell you, sir. I have made my vow, and I cannot betray his confession,” the priest responded calmly but sternly. Burt thought the answer over for a minute, weighing his options.

“I understand, and in that case, good day to you, and thank you for the service,” he said.

“I will pray for your success, officer.” the priest gave a slight bow of respect, and Burt nodded in return before walking out of the church.

He drove back over to the station. Tomorrow, there was going to be a “trial” held for Joseph Carter, and he had to make sure all of the evidence was ready to be presented in a clear and coherent manner. There was a small courtroom in the town’s municipal building, and there was a real judge who was going to be overseeing the proceedings and a real jury, although Burt doubted that those assembled would truly be Joseph’s peers. But much of the process and fanfare of the trial would, of course, be much different than the way it was done back in the days of the United States. Joseph would, of course, have no public defender assigned to him, and even if they had found someone, he was certain they would refuse to do so given the nature of the case. The man would have to represent himself for what he did. Lastly, the punishments doled out were different as well. Joseph already knew what was waiting for him. This was frontier justice.

“Hey, if you don’t got anything else going on right now, take your time, talk to the motherfucker, try and get him to confess or at least to talk.” Burt tasked Kody with the dirty work as he walked into the station. Something about the man terrified him, not the man himself physically, but rather the notion of who he was, what he was capable of. He would rather re-examine the bones downstairs rather than waste his time interrogating Joseph for a hypothetical confession he knew the man would never give.

“Yes, sir,” the young officer said, finishing up with some paperwork which he was shuffling around on his desk, and headed off to the jail cell.

Burt descended the stairs and turned on the light. It was just ribs and a spine, nothing else, nothing even left on the bones themselves to actually decay, although the disgusting smell of death still hung in the air. He wondered how long it would take to get it to air out. Based on the size alone, it appeared to be a large adult man. Furthermore, the sternum was absent entirely, potentially broken, and ripped out. There was no way of telling if this injury was what killed him or if this was done posthumously in order to butcher him. 

He couldn’t help but gag at the thought.

There wasn’t anything left that could possibly identify the victim, nothing that could tie these bones to a face and a name. He pored over them in detail, but the only things of note that he saw were the human teeth marks left on the ribs. Whoever the man was, he most likely had come with Joseph himself, as there hadn’t been any missing persons reported from the town, especially none matching these remains. As morbid as it was, the fact calmed Burt just a little bit, and he was ashamed that it did.

After going over the remains and taking measurements and pictures of the bite marks, he began to catalog and examine the rest of the equipment recovered from the camp. Some of it was already bagged and catalogued by Kody, including what was certainly the murder weapon: a bloody hatchet found lying on a nearby stump, although the blood on it wasn’t fresh and had already dried to a brown, rusty layer when they recovered it. He was thus occupied when he had heard a loud, earsplitting boom followed by a scream. Undoubtedly a gunshot.",1,1753111878.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know.

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

1m5lzi9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1m5lzi9/helping_my_wife_with_her_anxiety_stress_as_a_new/,Helping my wife with her anxiety & stress as a new mom,"First of all, thank you to anyone who is taking the time to read this and provide support, feedback, and your personal experience. 



**Background**: My \[34M\] beautiful wife \[35F\] and I have two amazingly beautiful girls under the age of 2. My wife is a stay-at-home-mom and has been having an extremely difficult time handling the responsibilities of being a mother for are two precious girls. She always feels overwhelmed, stressed & anxious despite all the support she receives from myself, her parents, and our nanny. (I'll get into this later)

It all started with the birth of our firstborn. She was born into the world with some complications & needed to be in the NICU for the first month of her life. She's a perfectly happy and healthy girl now, but that was a traumatic & troubling time for us. Following her birth, my wife started suffering from health issues and over time we've identified she had lactation anaphylaxis (allergy to breast feeding) & an autoimmune diseases called Sjogrens. 

Despite identifying these challenges, my wife continued to share how she feels fatigued and weak to the point where she is unable to even lift her arms over her head and always wants to take naps. Over the last two years, she continued to visit specialists to try and determine if there was another root cause, but everything continued to come out clear. She was tested for Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Dermatomyositis (autoimmune of the muscle), had an EMG at a Neurologist, saw an allergist, etc. 

Most recently, her rheumatologist adamantly shared with us that what she is dealing with is 100% not related to an autoimmune disease based on her biopsy and bloodwork. Her doctor continued to share that she's seen 100+ cases of people struggling through a challenging time in their life wanting to believe they have a medical issue, but are instead dealing with mental struggles. She suggested my wife consider seeing a psychologist. She shared that being a new mom with 2 kids under 2 is incredible difficult, and the symptoms my wife is feeling are common symptoms of ongoing panic attacks, stress, and anxiety.

Rather than being happy with the results, she had difficulties accepting her symptoms are not something medical related. She doesn't want to believe it could be her mental state could be affecting her body causing the fatigue and weakness. We had a conversation several days after her appointment, and she agreed to see a psychiatrist. Following her appointment, the psychiatrist did recommend an anti-anxiety medication, and I was excited for her to try something to make her feel better.

Well, fastforward a month later and my wife is trying to make every excuse in the book as to not try taking medication to help her feel better. She believes it's her choice & she doesn't want to take something that may only be a ""temporary fix"". I tried sharing with her that if it is a chemical inbalance in her brain that her trying an anti-anxiety medication is no different than taking a medical for an autoimmune disease.  

We had a conversation last night which stemmed from me asking her how she's been feeling mentally the last couple of weeks. She was telling me about some of her challenges and I provided a suggestion for her to take some time for herself to do things she enjoys such as going to the gym 2-3 times a week, taking time to go to a coffee shop when our nanny is here, or even book a massage. I told her it's important she finds her identity outside of being a mom and if she takes care of herself, that would help her be the best mom & wife she wants to be more our kids and I.

Well, to my surprise the conversation turned into how it's my fault she has been feeling this way. That she doesn't feel supported and there are things I've done in the past that she is still upset by. She brought up things from 2+ years ago that I've now have no control over and isn't even applicable to the person I am today. When I asked her if there was anything I could do for her to feel more supported, she didn't have a good answer and was only able to provide a suggestion of helping with pre-filling bottles for her.

For background, I'm the sole provider for our family. I work from home and once 5:30pm hits, I'm immediately doing something to help out in the house or playing with my girls. I'm typically the one doing the dishes, washing the bottles, preparing or picking dinner, taking out the trash, washing the cars, bathing our girls, putting our oldest to bed, doing the final bottle feed for our youngest, and prepping/feeding breakfast to our oldest. I'm also handling a lot of the one offs like washing our cars, paying our bills, cleaning the bathrooms, wiping down the island, etc. I can confidently say I'm doing my fair share in the relationship. I even make the effort to ask my wife if she would like to go for a walk together, go out to eat, and even to take time for herself. 

We also have a nanny that takes care of our girls 3 days a week for the full day. Despite her having immense support between myself and nanny, she still appears to be in a constant state of anxiety & stress and has a tendency to put the blame on others. There is always something wrong with the nanny or something wrong with me. There seems to be no accountability for her feeling the way she does.

I need help. I've tried having several conversations that I'm worried for her and everyone just wants her to feel better. But those conversations always turn into what other people are doing wrong or how outside factors are affecting her mood. She regularly asks ""why is everything her fault"" and that ""I'm not taking accountability for my part"", yet I honestly don't have any issues outside of wanting my happy wife back.

Has anyone dealt with this before? Do I put an ultimatum that she needs to seek help? ",1,1753111770.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False

Im 24M, normal weight, and starting 3-4 months ago I began to experience intense dizziness and daytime fatigue. I have struggled with fatigue, brain fog, and dizziness on and off for years, but nothing this persistent. Previously I could always push through it. The fatigue became increasingly debilitating to the point where I simply couldn't function as a contributing member of society. I had to leave my job. Unable to cook food or perform basic chores. Over the next two months, I underwent every test imaginable. The only thing that came back abnormal was my sleep study. AHI of 12. I felt so extremely validated at that point. A few weeks later I got my cpap (airsense 11) and it only took me a few nights to acclimate to it. I will admit I have seen marginal improvement with my fatigue; fatigue that was 9.5/10 is now 8/10. My AHI is down to 1-2 with max pressure of 7. Settings currently at 6-15 and EPR on 3 full-time. It has been just over a month with the machine but for the past 2 weeks I wake up 4-5 times a night with my mask off (full mask F20). Every. Single. Morning. I am absolutely pumped with gas and bloating. I am only now realizing this isn't my diet. The CPAP machine is literally blowing me up like a balloon. I wake up in pain, very fatigued and passing gas like a fucking freight train. I have been using a wedge pillow for a month, but I tend to slide down it. I try not to eat late, but it's hard to sleep on an empty stomach. I have tried a P20 nasal pillow, mouth tape, I even took a loan out on a tempurpedic mattress and adjustable base. I simply dont know what to do anymore. I have been looking into chronic fatigue syndrome but whats the point of going down that road if theres nothing you can do about it... I have been giving a lot of thought to things, and if things don't change, this isn't the life I want to live. Just a year ago I was in my final year of college, running a small business, loving life, now I am a husk of a human being. I forget things immediately after doing them. My motivation hasn't changed, but my ability to do things has. I wake up and I want to go golf, I want to work out, I want just to go for a walk and grab a coffee. I don't even want to feel great or rested; just feeling okay would suffice. Most of all, I am sick and tired of the judgment from everyone in my life. They look at me and see a young, healthy guy. They think I am just being lazy or need to cheer up.

I have endless sympathy for everyone in this subreddit, as well as those struggling with fatigue-inducing conditions. I admire how much you have all been able to achieve and adapt to. I just don't think this is a battle I can endure and I am at a complete loss for what to do next.",0,1753111698.0,CPAP,12,0.33,False
1m5lxq1,https://i.redd.it/gxpm23gnw8ef1.png,[Whiskey Review #138] McDowell's No. 1,"Anyone living on the *Western* side of the world might see a whiskey brand called McDowell's and wonder what the hell that is. My first thought was, who the hell would name a whiskey after the McDonald's knockoff that appeared in Coming to America? But McDowell's is a household name on the other side of the world.

Indeed, McDowell's has several ""world's best-selling"" accolades, including the world's best-selling whiskey. It's also the best-selling whiskey in India and the third best-selling alcoholic beverage in the world.

This whisky is a blend of Scotch and Indian malt, sold in India, Canada, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, and several Arab and African countries. The age, blend ratio, and barrel size are not specified, but it is bottled at 42.8% ABV.

Made by: United Spirits Limited  
Name of the whiskey: No. 1  
Brand: McDowell’s  
Origin: India  
Age: NAS  
Price: $9

**Nose:** On the nose, it has medicinal and citrus notes, including notes of tangerine peel. There are also soft notes of wood and vanilla, but not much else.  
**Palate:** The alcohol content is intense on the palate, with soft notes of chocolate, vanilla, caramel, and butter, with some traces of almonds and burnt coffee.   
**Retrohale/Finish:** Slightly herbal notes and hints of new tires.

**Rating:** 4 on the t8ke

**Conclusion:** I'm sure the primary reason for this whisky's high sales is its availability and price, with its taste coming in almost second place. It's pretty obvious that if you're selling something with alcohol to a country with over a billion people, no matter how low your sales are, if 0.5% of the country buys you, you're already talking a lot of sales, and it makes sense to bet on that.

But McDowell's is one of those examples where people point out that it's fine for people in India to drink this whisky and not go for the more familiar ones on this side, precisely because if they get too into it, they'll take the whole stock. McDowell's is a whisky about volume, not so much about flavor, and something I'd drink if there's nothing left.

Just wanted to share some of our prelaunch anxieties (and hopes!)","Hey, this is Amber from Only By Midnight, a small indie studio based in Canada, and tomorrow is a big day for us. We're releasing our second game, [Ctrl Alt Deal](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2146390/Ctrl_Alt_Deal/). It's exciting and scary, and, frankly, I've got some jumbo-jet-sized butterflies in my stomach.

Ctrl Alt Deal grew from a simple question we asked during development: “If you were trapped in a box, what would you do to escape?” That seed grew into this satirical, neon-lit world, a reflection of our anxieties, frustrations, and attitudes towards modern work culture. We developed the evil Paperclip International, aka the world's worst megacorp, along with our plucky AI hero, SCOUT.

Paperclip exploits both humans and robots, and SCOUT is nothing but a product to them. As SCOUT, you make deals with your dysfunctional human coworkers (whether by treating them fairly or manipulating them) to get them to help you escape. The humans want things like triggering angry bees to punish messy coworkers, instigating or disrupting office romances, or even just a new staff coffee maker. The game mixes deckbuilding mechanics and tactical turn-based decision making, plus a Suspicion Meter. If the dreaded Turing Officer gets you, it’s all over and you have to start again. 

So, yeah, it's weird and wacky and we love it. No shame in admitting I'm feeling pretty vulnerable right now, haha. This project has been our lives for the past 4+ years. Lots of late nights, testing and scrapping mechanics, and developing the narrative with pots of coffee to help. Writing corporate satire turned out trickier than I expected, because it seemed like every time I thought of something ridiculously awful for Paperclip to do, some real-life corp was already doing it.

Plus, we struggled with getting our game in front of the right players. We're a weird mashup of turn-based strategy, simulation, and deckbuilder. The game loop is not intuitive, and it took us a long time to build a demo that people understood and liked. Coming up with a 5-10 minute convention demo was SUPER challenging, but we pulled it off, and convention appearances have been our biggest wishlist driver. Also totally motivational, seeing people play and love the game. The first time an outside player really ""got"" it was 100% magical. 

We're all hella nervous, as the kids say (okay, I don't know what the kids say these days, I'm old lol), but we're really excited to finally share the whole game with the world.

So please wish us luck, fellow devs! And if you’ve got tips for surviving launch day, we'll gladly take them.  Thanks for listening to my ramble. It's comforting to know there's a community here that understands exactly what this feels like (or are hoping to soon!). Hopefully tomorrow we'll get a bunch of our own wisdom we can pass on to you all in the future. :)

As the years trickled by, I realised you felt the same way. But it was never the right time. And reading between the lines of our unspoken promises we realised we'd missed our opportunity.

You'd drift in and out of our friendship, changing your phone number, deleting your social media accounts, running from your past. But every so often you'd resurface. Like a beautiful meteor shower.

I have come to realise that every so often, people will come blazing back into your life, like a glorious meteor shower. Breathtakingly wonderful and full of life.

But, as soon as you have grown used to seeing them,  just as sure as it started, they're gone again. 

It's okay though, because, I'd grown to really like meteor showers, however long they stay. And, I'd learned that the trick is, Once you realise that you're looking at one, take your time to commit every tiny detail to memory. Every tiny fragment. Remember how it looks, how it sounds, how much it's changed since the last time. 

And so as the meteor shower ended and I trusted that you would come back again. You hugged me in the pub, said we'll do this again soon. And 3 weeks later deleted me out of your life like I meant nothing to you. 

5 years, of being inseperable, of defending your name even if you didn't fully deserve it. Because I saw the good in you. Above all else. And you walked away without a word. 

I wanted to make you coffee every morning for the rest of our lives. To hold your hand through nightmares. To show you that love should come easily. Because loving you comes so so easily.

Now I hope you get everything you ever wanted from the world, and that I never have to hear about it.

For context, I prioritize nature over cityscape, but am a huge foodie and love going on coffee crawls. I love hiking, but not sure if my group will be able to withstand long hikes in the humidity.

In most coffee cherries, you get two flat beans. But in about 5–10% of cherries, only one bean forms—it grows rounder, denser, and solo. That’s a peaberry.

Because of its shape, it roasts more evenly, bringing out cleaner acidity and fruit-forward notes. Think citrus, berry, and floral vibes—especially in lighter roasts.

**TL;DR:**  
Peaberry = one bean, rounder shape, juicier taste.

**So how many of you ever tried a peaberry coffee ?**

Take “Why” as an example. You know that feeling when something happens and it just feels *so* unfair. That moment when a simple “为什么 (Wèi shénme)” isn’t enough. You need something sharper, something that carries your frustration, disbelief, maybe even a hint of outrage.

That’s when you say: **“凭什么 Píng shénme?”** 

It literally breaks down as: 

* 凭 píng = based on, by virtue of 
* 什么 shén me = what

But together, 凭什么 is the kind of “why” you use when you’re not just asking—you’re challenging. It’s not neutral or polite. It’s the “why” that says:

* ""Why should this be allowed?""
* ""How is this even fair?""
* ""What gives you the right?""

To really get it, let’s imagine a few everyday moments where 凭什么 would naturally burst out:

* 你凭什么插队？Nǐ píng shénme chā duì? = Why the hell are you cutting in line?

* 凭什么又让我加班？ Píng shénme yòu ràng wǒ jiābān?  = Why are you making me work overtime again?

* 你凭什么喝我的咖啡？自己不会买吗？Nǐ píng shénme hē wǒ de kāfēi? Zìjǐ bú huì mǎi ma?

* 这明明是我的方案，凭什么他说是他的？Zhè míngmíng shì wǒ de fāng’àn, píng shén me tā shuō shì tā de? = This was clearly my proposal—how can he claim it’s his? = Who gives you the right to drink my coffee? Can’t you buy your own?

* A: ""你得听我的 Nǐ děi tīng wǒ de.“  B:“凭什么？你又不是我爸！Píng shénme? Nǐ yòu búshì wǒ bà! ” = A: ""You have to listen to me."" B: ""Says who? You’re not my dad!""

  
Get the vibe? To truly understand “凭什么” is to read between the lines of Chinese culture. It’s more than a question—it’s packed with emotional subtext, challenging not just actions, but legitimacy, power, and the very idea of fairness.

I hope you truly understand it, though I also hope you’ll never need to use it in real life.",25,1753111311.0,ChineseLanguage,9,0.96,False

I swear, the coffee station just has a magic way of bringing out the worst habits, or at least the stupidest habits in human beings. I can rant about the stupidity and shitty behaviors of guests in any capacity of the hotel, but I swear, most of it is delegated to the coffee station. I, like most people, can't stand the 'don't talk to me until I've had my coffee' type of person. However, I believe more and more every day that most people seriously cannot actually function like real adults until they've had their hot bean juice. I work at a shmampton inn and we have four urns on display 24/7. So, a fun fact about coffee urns... they can only hold so much coffee.. did I just blow your mind with that fun fact?! Believe it or not, they get empty periodically. Could this be because they get high traffic in the morning during the breakfast rush? People look genuinely confused and shocked when they press the spigot down and a couple dribbles of coffee come out. They jiggle the spigot a few more times thinking that will work... and then they go 'uhhhh... I think the coffee is out' with a look of confusion and terror. Then they go back and jiggle the spigot some more. I even have people ask if theres a special way to get the coffee out of the spigot. Yeah, the rudimentary design of the urn is meant to throw you off, you have to twist and jiggle it in a style akin to a mortal combat cheat code... just juggle it a few more times, theres gotta be more coffee in there!

I attended a family function for a relative at the Sylvania location this past weekend, and I'd like to put my 2 cents out there on the beer I had there.

""Sunshine Sky"" (Orange-Lemon Wheat): Pale, slight light chill-haze in appearance, limited head on beer (not always the beer's fault). Low bitterness. Doughy/white bread grain/malt character, very subtle orange/lemon essence on the nose and in the flavor. Little to no detectable hop character. Not much in the way of fermentation character. A good, mildly more flavorful, substitution for the  typical Macro-lager during the hot summer. 

""Hopshield"" (WC IPA): Almost clear, dark gold, finger width of head on the pour. Respectable yet restrained bitterness for an IPA. Moderate grain/malt character, nothing noteworthy (which isn't necessarily a bad thing for an IPA). Hop flavor and aroma is straight up Cascade/Centennial (strong pine, moderate generic citrus), it's like an IPA got in a time machine back in the early 2000's and got out in 2025. It's good, and would have been a top-notch WCIPA back in 2005, but doesn't really take advantage of the new varieties of hops that have been released in the 21st century, so it's so-so today. Not much in the way of fermentation character.

""Deimos"" (Coffee/Vanilla Porter): Clear, reddish-brown, thin head on the pour. Low bitterness (to the point of it being flabby). Vanilla... Vanilla on the nose, and overwhelming vanilla on the palate; think: making cookies, but you put in 6 tablespoons of vanilla extract, rather than the 3 teaspoons of  vanilla the recipe calls for. No detectable coffee character. Very subdued malt character (think, pale grain-bill, mash capped with as little dark grain as possible for color). No discernable hop character. Sweet finish (it took me a while to work my way through the glass, and I like dark beer) Not much fermentation character.

""Devil Wears Hoodies"" (NEIPA): Poor example of a NEIPA. It's almost as clear as their WCIPA, pale yellow, thin, non-persistent head on the pour. PH is too high I'd guess, which, when combined with low bitterness, really makes the beer flabby, and the flavors really don't come through well. Limited Hop character on the nose, with the occasional whiff of Peach and tropical fruit when you swirl the glass. Malt/grain flavor is pretty much non-existent. Hop Flavor is a very, very subtle tropical fruit. Not much in the way of fermentation character. Kind of disappointing, If I'm to be frank, not worth the local hype.""

""T-Town Lager"": I did not order this during this outing (so I don't want to try and write from distant memory), but my Father in Law (who is big on Coors and Bud) thought it was very good. From what I remember, it's a very nice, mild, pale Adjunct-Lager. Definitely worth trying.

In my experience, IT5 is the kind of local brewer where they occasionally knock it out of the park, but 80% of their stuff is meh. Still worth checking out if you're in the area. Food is decent and reasonably priced as well. The downtown area of Sylvania is an open-container district, so you can get a beer and wander around the shops or sit off-premise and enjoy.",0,1753111201.0,beer,0,0.5,False

Took a while since they couldn’t get the engravings done due to cold weather (Canada) and some friends and family wanted to be there for the burial. We knew she wouldn’t have wanted people to take time off work and time away from other things so choosing a time on the weekend was important.

ChatGPT response to life not feeling real:
“When something this huge happens, your brain tries to protect you from the full weight of it by making everything feel foggy, distant, unreal. That sense of “this must be a dream” is your mind’s way of saying: this is too much to feel all at once. And it is.

But it is real. And that’s the part that hurts most. You’re awake in it, every day. And that’s not a weakness—that’s a sign of your strength, even if it doesn’t feel like strength right now. Just waking up and making it through the day when your world has changed like this is brave.”

1m5lp4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1m5lp4l/discover_if_thang_long_vietnamese_coffee_filter/,Discover if Thang Long Vietnamese Coffee Filter Delivers Authentic Brewing Experience Review,"Testing the Thang Long SYNCHKG077062 Vietnamese Coffee Filter Set has been an enjoyable experience for someone who thrives on their morning coffee ritual. As a self-proclaimed coffee connoisseur, I wanted a brewer that could align with the intricate process of authentic Vietnamese coffee. This stainless steel beauty not only delivered but also introduced me to a whole new level of coffee enjoyment.

**Build Quality and Design**  
The first thing that caught my eye about this coffee filter was its sleek stainless steel finish. It's compact, measuring 3.7"" x 3.7"" x 2.6"", and looks much sturdier than other filters I’ve tried before. The design screams durability, and the modern aesthetic feels at home in any kitchen decor. What’s even better? It’s lightweight, at just 4.4 ounces, and you can feel confident that it won’t rust or warp over time. The included gravity insert works smoothly; I found it far more user-friendly than the traditional screw-down mechanism. And let's be honest, simplicity is a lifesaver when you're still half asleep trying to brew coffee.

**Operation and Usability**  
I'm no barista, but using this manual brewer felt practically foolproof. The four-piece set comes apart effortlessly, and the gravity insert makes brewing mess-free and efficient. Once ground coffee is added, pouring hot water over it is all you need to begin brewing a delectable cup of café sua da or traditional hot coffee. Clean-up is also refreshingly simple since the filter is dishwasher-safe. I can't count the number of times my previous coffee makers made me dread that painstaking post-brew scrubbing session. This one spares you from those woes entirely.

**[Ready to buy Thang Long SYNCHKG077062? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b01953yt1i/)**  

**Merits**  
- High-quality stainless steel construction promises longevity.  
- Easy-to-use gravity insert eliminates complicated processes.  
- Compact and portable design ideal for travel or small kitchens.  
- Dishwasher-safe for effortless cleaning.  
- Brews a delicious, slow-drip Vietnamese coffee every time.  

**Brewing Performance**  
Talk about consistent results! The slow dripper mechanism ensures the coffee steeps just right, pulling out rich flavors while avoiding over-extraction. I tested it with Trung Nguyen coffee, as suggested, and wow—it nailed the balance of aroma and taste. Switching to ground coffee from other brands also yielded great results. Whether it’s sunny iced coffee on a hot day or a warm, comforting brew for chilly mornings, this filter performed exceptionally. Some might say it rivals even larger coffee-making systems that cost three times more.

**Pitfalls**  
- Lacks a measuring guide for coffee grounds and water.  
- Limited brewing capacity (8 ounces per run).  
- Not the fastest option if you're in a hurry.  

**Who Should Use This?**  
This product is perfect for those who enjoy personal, artisanal coffee brewing experiences. If you're someone like me who values the satisfaction of creating your drink from start to finish, this fits that niche perfectly. It's also a great option for frequent travelers. Imagine waking up in an Airbnb somewhere remote and still being able to have your ritual Vietnamese brew—sounds dreamy, right? But if you’re after bulk coffee production for a crowd, this little filter falls short.

**Competitive Options**  
I’ve tinkered with pour-over styles like the Hario V60 and AeroPress, and while those are great, they serve different purposes. The Hario requires more attention to technique, while the AeroPress leans more toward versatility. However, for authentic Vietnamese coffee, this filter has no equal—it carries the tradition and simplicity you won’t find elsewhere. Compared to traditional espresso machines, the manual nature of this device makes it far less intimidating and way more accessible for at-home use.

**Value for Money**  
What truly elevates this coffee filter set is the lifetime warranty. That’s confidence you don’t often see in compact kitchen devices. It’s clear that each feature—from the slow-drip mechanism to the gravity insert—has been designed to maximize value for every dollar spent. Though it can seem a bit on the niche side, the quality and output more than justify its price. Its durability alone ensures you won't need to fuss over replacements anytime soon—smart spending at its finest.

I had a temporary week-long tenure as a camp counsellor in March but I don’t really count that because it was so brief. This is my first actual job and I just feel so lost??

I know it’s to be expected as a 15-year-old but I always just beat myself up about it. My coworkers are mostly okay but nearly all of them are 10+ years older than me so I basically feel like an ant next to them. I’m really not used to seeing adults as equals, for me they’ve always been authority figures (teachers or my parents) so I have a really hard time with that.

Yesterday I had a closing shift with this one coworker who’s maybe 30-35m? And I just kept fucking up idk I get really nervous working with men old enough to be my father. He pointed to the sandwich station and told me to ‘wrap it up’ so I wrapped the individual sandwiches in plastic like I’ve done on other closing shifts but then he got upset with me because apparently he meant I was to wrap them still on the plates and I’d made too many dishes for him. I felt like shit for misunderstanding him, I apologized 173729911 times and I had to fight back tears idk I just felt so stupid. Then I spilled milk when I was taking down the coffee station and he got upset with me again because apparently I was driving the cart with the milk cartons on it wrong?? And I felt like an idiot again. He wound up doing all the dishes and taking down most of the food and now I can’t stop thinking about how dumb I am and how idk anything. I know there’s no use in crying over spilled milk (literally in this case lol) but I just feel so fucking young and stupid. 

Tl;dr: I’m 15f at my first-ever real job for about a month. I keep making silly mistakes and I know it’s to be expected because I’m young and inexperienced but I keep beating myself up about it. Also almost all my coworkers are adults so I feel really small and insignificant.

I don't drive or have access to renting a scooter, I will rely on transit and taxis. I am interested in food, nature, art, but have limited physical stamina for hikes (2 hours) so I have mainly been going on walks broken up by coffee shops, parks and museums etc. 

My rough plan is, leave Taipei on 24th, travel to Kaohsiung OR Hengchun, spend half day plus one night there, in the morning take the 9189 Taiwan Tourist Shuttle plus 101B Kenting Shuttle Orange, reach the National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium. 

I have booked the sleepover there. So I would visit the aquarium on the 25th half day (if they let me in during the day) then the tour of aquarium m 4pm onward and sleep there till next day (26th) at 11am. 

Then on the 26th I would either travel back to Kaohsiung or travel to Tainan for 2 nights (26th and 27th) then travel back to Taipei where I will be for 28th and 29th. 

My questions are - 

1. Does this plan seem feasible? Is one night in Kaohsiung too little, should I skip Tainan?


2. When going to the national museum of marine biology and aquarium from taipei by train and bus, is it better to spend the night in Hengchun or in Kaohsiung? I just felt if I am travelling all the way it is better to have a shorter journey of 2 hours in the morning before the aquarium tour. Hengchun is much closer to the Aquarium but Kaohsiung may have more things to do and see. Alternatively I could try and do the whole journey to the aquarium on the morning of the 25th but this seems like a loooong day haha.


3. I dont speak Mandarin and the tour language is Mandarin. Can anyone who has gone to this aquarium tell me if they have any English language option?


4. Should I book the high speed train tickets through Klook? Or can I buy them at the station when I arrive there?


5. Similarly do I need to book the shuttle buses or can I just add money to easycard and pay using that?

1m5ldkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1m5ldkz/chemex_brewing_and_grinder_seasoning/,Chemex brewing and grinder seasoning?,"Hi,
I've posted here previously about my brews being fast, something that's been sort of resolved as the grinder gets more use. But this so called seasoning when you buy a new grinder, how much coffee until it's ""done""?

1Zpresso X-Ultra is the grinder I've got and I've ran through 250g at least. I'm sort of struggling with dialing it in because I feel like it's sometimes strong and sometimes weak even if I barely adjust it. A lot of cups also turn out kind of basic, as in I know the coffee can be great but the taste is just like cheaper coffee(not great, not awful).

Currently brewed 24g with 400g water at 92°C in about 3:30 (Chemex). Best brew so far, but I feel like I've gotten lucky rather than actually getting to the right settings/technique.

Anyone with any tricks that helped you with these sort of things?

It's definitely user error and not faulty equipment, but at the same time I feel like I should be getting better and not just have something random happen each adjustment.

Grateful for any advice, and before y'all start mentioning water I know that's a factor. It's just not relevant/the problem in this situation although it might help improving the taste in later stages of my coffee journey.",1,1753110375.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

As a store manager-how involved in community projects can I be? Can I hold community days/events?  Does DG allow stores/districts to set up booths at events, career fairs, etc?  Do districts or stores do community service events? Are there things that stores/district/the company does to assist the associates?

I would want to make it a real break room area for associates to relax in on their breaks. Have a coffee pot of some sort, an air fryer? No storage etc.  Raises.  I've read different things.

1m5lbox,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m5lbox,Sleep Question for 6 month old OES Fred,"Hello Reddit friends!! Fred is turning 6 months on July 22nd :) We are equal parts loving and loathing the development phases at times lol but still I love Fred to pieces. I appreciate al lthe advice on our last post about food - it seems he did have a sensitivity or allergy to chicken! As soon as we switched to Nulo brand pure protein salmon, his tummy issues seemed to (mostly) vanish aside from a random episode here or there. All that said, I wanted to ask some advice around sleeping habits. Since he is not yet neutered behaviors are changing with his development which includes bursts of energy and maybe starting to figure out that he’s a boy.

We are crating Fred at night and seemingly it has been OK, however Fred never sleeps past 530am. It’s driving me and my husband a bit crazy considering we are so sleep deprived, so I’m turning to the experts here who always have some advice! Our routine is as follows:


530 am Fred wakes the house up by whining and crying to go out- usually we alternate who gets up and responds to the call. We’ve tried waiting it out, but it just intensifies. Once we take Fred outside, he goes to the bathroom (usually both kinds). If we put him back in the crate he cries, but if I go back to sleep on the couch he just lays down on the floor and settles back to sleep.

7 am - Breakfast for Fred and coffee for the humans

8 am - 1 hour walk with Fred. His leash manners still kind of suck, but we’re working on it. Some days are great, some are a challenge!

9 am-12 pm - he basically just sleeps! We work from home and give him full range of our small home. He usually just finds a spot that is comfy like the bathroom floor in the photo above and passes out.

12pm - usually a bathroom break when I make lunch or so. If I have the bandwidth from work, I will do a 10-15 min training session with training treats.

4pm - active Fred begins. I think he knows it’s closer to dinner time, so he wants to play or go outside. Depending on the work day I try to accommodate for a few minutes with the tennis ball or rope toy.

5pm - Fred eats dinner.

530pm - I take Fred for another 45 min to an hour walk where he does business.

630-8pm - This is a gamble. Sometimes he’s tired and will just sleep, but lately the shift has been nonstop party time for Fred. He wants to play play play play, or get the zoomies in the backyard. Again, I do my best, but by this hour my husband and I are tired and winding down from lack of sleep, work, and walks with him.

8-10pm - he usually sleeps near the couch as my husband and I watch a tv show or movie.

10pm - last nightly potty break (usually just a pee).

10:15pm - crate time. He goes in the crate no problem, might rustle around a bit, but ultimately go to sleep. 

1am - panting. It seems like Fred will wake up and just start panting for 20-30 minutes. No rhyme or reason. We’ve even turned on our air conditioning (we live on the west coast at the beach so its never truly hot here), and he also has a dedicated air filter and fan to make his sleeping area *the most comfortable*. I can only assume the panting is due to growth/adult teeth, or something?

530am - fully awake, wants to get up and get out.


If you made it this far in my post, I am extremely open to feedback on how we can improve the sleeping hours. IDEALLY we wouldn’t wake up until closer to 7am.

**special note: Fred did his first one night trial sleepover at his daycare camp on Saturday night. We want to find a place we trust for when we have upcoming travel at the end of August for a family wedding. The facility is great and recommended by Caesar Millan, and so far Fred seems to love going there for his doggy day camps! During his overnight stay though, he had an accident in his crate which resulted in them having to fully bathe him the next morning. He is fine, but it made me a bit sad and wondering if perhaps he can’t hold it a full 8 hours. Is this normal for a 6 month old?

This isn’t just a glass-it’s a statement. The BenShot Combat Knife Glass features a heavy-duty, solid metal combat knife embedded right into the side. Inspired by the legendary KA-BAR knife carried by American forces since WWII, this glass honors the blade that’s been used to take down Nazis, fight communists, and hunt terrorists.

**The Legendary Ka-bar Knife:** Whether you’re a collector, veteran, outdoorsman, or proud patriot, the Ka-bar is a blade with history in every inch of steel.

* **Crafted for Service:** Originally designed for U.S. Marines during World War II, this knife was built to endure the harshest combat conditions. Its legacy spans multiple wars and countless stories of courage.  
* **American-Made Quality:** Ka-bar knives are still made in the USA, combining traditional craftsmanship with modern precision.  
* **A Piece of History:** Holding a Ka-bar is holding a piece of America’s military heritage perfect for display, gifting, or taking on your next adventure.  

First issued to the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II, the Kab-ar has served American troops for generations. It’s built for the battlefield but stands as a tribute to the rugged determination that built this country and continues to defend it.

The Combat Knife glass is available throughout our complete range of glassware, including shot glasses, rock glasses, pint glasses, wine glasses, beer mugs, coffee mugs, and decanters, can all be customized with the embedded combat knife.

**Fun Fact:** The name “KA-BAR” actually came from a partially illegible testimonial letter sent by a trapper who said the knife had “killed a bear” when his rifle jammed ""K A BAR"" was all that could be read!

Let’s honor those who’ve lived, fought, and died for our freedoms past and present.

Cheers,

Not too long ago, I had a health scare. There is a history of high blood pressure in my family, but mine has always been steady and average. That is until I had a cortisone injection to help with some arthritis in my knee. The cortisone, which is, of course, a corticosteroid, caused my blood pressure to spike for several days and as a result, I went to the ER to be treated. While this was a common side effect, I wasn’t prepared for it and it was quite concerning.

Fortunately, it is a treatable disorder with the right medication and with my family doctor on board, we’ve gotten my blood pressure back to a normal range. Since then, I have tried to be more intentional about what I’m eating and increasing my activities so that natural activities can help regulate that aspect of my health. In order to monitor my daily progress I’ve started using ActivityTracker Pedometer [for iOS](https://macsources.com/category/featured/apps/) so that I get the most accurate data possible.

According to the App Store ActivityTracker developer, Bits&Coffee, may collect data related to identifiers, usage, and diagnostics from the app. The full privacy policy can be [found here](https://activitytracker.app/privacy-policy.html).

**VideoCollage:** Helps users create side-by-side or grid-style video and photo collages, offering templates, background music, and customizable layout options for easy social sharing or presentations.

# User Experience

Installation of ActivityTracker was super easy. I just downloaded it from the App Store and granted access to permissions and I was off and running (so to speak). The app started tracking right away — as did the Apple Watch. I didn’t notice that the watch data wasn’t syncing with the app automatically though. One day I looked down and my watch said I had over 800 steps, while the phone said I only had 500 steps. So, make sure to open your profile and select “Sync Watch & Health” so that your data aggregates properly.

I also noticed a very handy-dandy feature under the profile called “Import from Apple Health.” This will import all the activity data you already have store in Apple Health into ActivityTracker. Once I did that, I was able to look at trends back to 2017.

https://preview.redd.it/m3tmiu27s8ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=884a7599ba7e7d12afda1ac9e7bbaf83d679ae43

Because I really enjoy tracking this information and having instant feedback about my progress, I added the ActivityTracker widget to my home screen. It is beautifully laid out and I actually prefer how it looks to other widgets I have. I also love that when you tap the widget it takes you directly to the Profile in the app.

One of the biggest gripes I have with Apple’s native Health app is that it can be hard to get the information I’m looking for. Yes, Apple has the ‘rings’ visual, but what I want to see is the actual step count — quickly and easily. This is why I like ActivityTracker *better* than the activity information in Apple Health. Right from the icon on the home screen of my iPhone, I can see how many steps I’ve taken. Now, there are, of course a couple of features I’d love to see improved.

* The step count on the iOS icon doesn’t update until I open the app. I haven’t force quit the app and it still doesn’t seem to update automatically until I bring the app up.
* There is no complication available for ActivityTracker on the Apple Watch. I’m assuming this is because it would be in conflict with the Apple Activity complication, but it would be great to see that step count on my Apple Watch face.

# Conclusion

ActivityTracker Pedometer has been a valuable tool in helping me become more aware of my daily movement and health. Its clean interface, thoughtful features, and battery-friendly approach make it a standout choice for anyone who wants to stay active without overcomplicating their routine. Whether you’re recovering from a health scare or just trying to build healthier habits, ActivityTracker offers meaningful insights in a simple, elegant format.

1m5l5lj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1m5l5lj/i_live_alone_i_just_found_a_grocery_receipt_on_my/,I live alone. I just found a grocery receipt on my kitchen counter from a store I don’t shop at.,"(I posted this on r/mystery too, then I read through the subreddit and realised it’s probably not the best place to post it so this is a copy and paste repost)  ok so i know this is gonna sound dumb or like i’m making a big deal out of nothing but something happened this morning that just really freaked me out. it’s probably nothing but i can’t stop thinking about it and i don’t really have anyone to talk to about it, so i’m just dumping it here

i live alone in a one bedroom apartment. it’s not super big or fancy but it’s fine for me. i’ve lived here for about 6 months and honestly nothing weird has ever happened. i keep to myself, i lock my doors, i don’t have a roommate or a boyfriend or anything. i don’t even have close friends who visit regularly. it’s just me. my job’s about 25 minutes away and i usually work til 6ish so i’m not home much during the day

so this morning i woke up like normal and went into the kitchen to make coffee. i hadn’t even turned on the lights yet when i saw this little piece of paper just sitting on my kitchen counter. like, dead center of the counter, it had no crumples or rips it was just sitting there. at first i thought it was a receipt i forgot to throw out or something but when i looked at it i realized it wasn’t from anywhere i’ve been. it’s a receipt from a grocery store i’ve literally never shopped at. i recognize the name, i think there’s one in the next town over, but i’ve definitely never gone there. it’s not on my usual route and there’s no reason for me to go out that way

i flipped it over and the date said it was from yesterday. the timestamp was like 4:31pm. which is super weird because i was at work the whole time and i can prove it. i was in a meeting at that exact time. i even double checked my calendar to be sure. so unless i somehow blacked out and drove 40 minutes to buy soup and toothpaste in the middle of the day (which… i didn’t), there’s just no reason this thing should be in my apartment

also the stuff on it was weird. like just… random. a banana, a can of soup, travel sized toothpaste, and one of those tiny lighters. like what even is that combination. nothing that screams “someone was planning to do anything specific,” just weird and kind of useless unless you’re camping or something

and i know i didn’t bring it in. i got home around 6:35ish last night and went straight to my bedroom, then showered, watched a show, and fell asleep early. i didn’t bring any groceries home. i didn’t order anything. i didn’t go anywhere else. i know what i did. and i would’ve noticed putting a receipt in the middle of the counter, right?

so now i’m just standing there staring at it like… what the hell. my first thought was maybe it stuck to something i brought in? like a bag or my coat or whatever. but i checked. nothing else had any paper stuck to it. the coat i wore yesterday was still hanging up in the closet. i didn’t even carry anything in besides my keys and water bottle

i started getting a little freaked out so i checked the doors and windows. all locked. nothing looks messed with. but then i remembered i have a nest cam pointed at the front door, just inside. i don’t pay a ton of attention to it but i figured if something happened it would be on there. so i opened the app and scrolled to yesterday around when the receipt said it was printed

this is where it gets worse. the footage from around 4:03 to 5:12 is just… gone. like the timeline’s there but it’s just black. no error message, no “camera offline,” just black. then it starts recording normally again like nothing happened. i checked the footage from the day before and it’s fine. and today it’s fine too. it’s just that chunk of time. maybe a glitch? maybe the internet hiccuped or whatever? but it’s never done that before. and it just happens to be at the exact time the receipt says it was printed?

i know how this sounds. i sound like i’m spiraling. and maybe i am. i want to believe this is just a weird coincidence and there’s some totally normal explanation. maybe i picked it up somewhere without noticing. maybe it did stick to something. maybe my memory’s just garbage and i forgot something important. but the receipt is real and it’s sitting on my kitchen counter and i cannot figure out a single reason why it’s here

nothing else in the apartment is weird. nothing’s moved. nothing’s missing. the doors were locked. the windows were locked. the lights were off when i got home. everything looked totally normal. but that’s almost worse? like if something else was off, maybe it would help it make sense. but it’s just this one stupid piece of paper that i know shouldn’t be here

i’m trying not to freak myself out about it but i keep walking past the counter and just staring at it. i haven’t thrown it away yet. (Edit: At the time of posting I have thrown it away since it creeped me out) part of me wants to, but part of me is scared i’ll need it later? like maybe it’s a clue to something else. i know how dumb that sounds. i’m not saying this is some paranormal thing or anything like that. just that something doesn’t add up and it’s bothering me a lot more than it should

anyway. sorry this was so long. i just needed to get it out. probably nothing. probably something stupid i’ll remember in a few hours and laugh about. but right now i feel weirdly watched. and i hate that feeling

has anyone else had something like this happen? or am i just overtired and making it into something bigger than it is?

4. Close. Start the same way as in step 3 (100ml, careful stir). Let it settle a few seconds. Dump the fines on top and stir lightly so the bed is not affected. Empty after 1min.

The fines get only one round of extraction and get filtered trough the bed. For me this makes a lot of sense, but I haven't seen anyone try this yet. If you have, I am interested in it and also your experiments.

**Memory Transcription Subject: Princess Celestia, Equestrian Princess of the sun, and co-ruler of Equestria.**

**Date [Standardized Equus Time]: 14th day of the First Month of Summer, 1111.**

The gentle sound of porcelain on saucers gave a feeling of calm to my afternoon tea sessions. The air in the ornate Sunstone Parlor of my castle was alight with friendly conversation. The aroma of freshly brewed tea and warm pastries wafted over the table. Across said table was Venlil ambassador Valek, diplomatic envoy to Equestria, his ears twitched nervously toward the omnivores present, though his white-speckled grey tail swayed contently as he politely spoke with Princess Cadence about trading for art supplies before sipping a cup of green tea and biting into a simple white bread. *Apparently even the most basic of crayons are prohibitively expensive in their galactic Federation. You would think that at least a few of these supposedly hundreds of species would have proficiency in the arts.* I mused to myself.

At the table also sat the leaders of the other species in and around Equestria: Princess Luna's horn glowed her signature soft blue as she held a steaming cup of black coffee, it's dark liquid complementing her coat, and bit thoughtfully into a star-shaped shortbread cookie. Dragon Lord Ember, her sky-blue scales shining under the parlor's magic lights, had chosen a stoneware mug of incredibly strong, black smoldering ginger tea, smelling vaguely of wood smoke. She'd already wolfed down a bowl of vibrant gemstones, but is now helping herself to a plate of flame-broiled mushroom skewers. Changeling King Thorax, his carapice a shiny green, his tail flicked side-to-side, his body language mirroring the complex emotions he observed and absorbed from the others, as he drank a clear glass of nectar-sweetened water, and delicately ate from a vibrant bouquet of flowers. Seapony/Hippogriff Queen Novo, in her Hippogriff form, was enjoying a glass of cucumber water and a plate of seaweed crackers. Yak Prince Rutherford sat on a particularly large cushion, his massive horns adorned with gold accents, he drank from a generously sized wooden mug of beer, the aroma starkly contrasting the delicate teas. He occasionally tore into a loaf of dense sourdough bread, dunking it into a bowl of salted butter. Grandpa Gruff, the Griffon, his one working eye followed our alien guest suspiciously, as he drank a cup of black tea and ate from a plate of fresh Griffon Scones. Rain Shine, her Kirin form relaxed, but her eyes betrayed a spirit like a wildfire, savored a cup of aromatic herbal tea with honey, decorated with a sprig of fresh mint. She politely ate from a vibrant plate of fresh fruit tarts. Princess Cadence nodded along toward Ambassador Valek as she drank a cup of rose hip tea, and occasionally ate from a glittery heart-shaped sugar cookie. While I held a cup of sun-petal tea, its golden color matching my aura surrounding it, and took a small bite out of a warm, freshly baked blueberry scone.

The Equestrian-Venlil Exchange Program had been underway for a fortnight, and the reports from Venlil Prime were... complex. The overall brain scan results from their ""Empathy Test"", which had just arrived yesterday through their communication system, definitely gave us much to think about. But first, said communication system was my topic of choice to discuss.

""Excuse me, Ambassador Valek."" I began politely while he paused to take a bite of his bread. He tilted his ears and faced one eye toward me. ""We appreciate the technologies your people are establishing for us very much. Just the preliminary infrastructure alone has enhanced our ability to communicate with our Exchange Participants greatly. The speed and clarity of this galactic communication is a boon that we'd only dreamt of!"" I paused to sip my tea, allowing Valek's translator to parse my words. I smiled warmly as his ears twitched 'you're welcome' while his tail said 'pride', before I continued. ""The vehicles you have designed for us are very efficient, though quite different from our manual, steam, or magic powered conveyances. Professional estimates predict their full integration within the year."" I stopped to take a bite of my scone. ""And these translator implants have proven invaluable. Students of the School of Friendship report that they are working perfectly when speaking with your citizens on this side of the portal."" I say before I stealthily scratched an itch on a small, otherwise unnoticeable bald spot behind my left ear.

Valek's ears perked up, a quiet purr escaping his throat, a sound that reminded me of a housecat. ""We are happy to help, Princess Celestia. Efficient communication and travel are key to the Federation's unity and prosperity. These technologies will bring Equus much closer to galactic standards, which will allow you to eventually join the galactic community.""

I nodded along, ""Speaking of, in spite of the fears, reports show the Venlil Exchange students are integrating well in Twilight's School of Friendship."" I said as I raised my teacup in Valek's direction.

Luna raised a hoof before speaking, leveling her gaze at the Ambassador. ""Pardon us, Ambassador. We would like to discuss these 'galactic standards' you mentioned. Your Governor Tarva sent us an itinerary explaining the changes and additions needed to integrate."" She then took a swig of her coffee, before teleporting a stack of papers, and a pair of reading glasses in front of herself, startling Valek. ""Specifically, we are curious about these 'Exterminator Guilds'."" She said as she read the paper closely, narrowing her eyes as she spoke plainly. ""According to this, these are... government organizations dedicated to the systematic eradication of all predator species, through naught but flame? An extreme measure, we find.""

Valek smoothed down his wool, calming down after the surprise. ""Amazing..."" he whispered under his breath, though my superior hearing picked it up perfectly. He quickly shook his head to get back on track, addressing my sister. ""The Exterminator Guilds, Princess Luna, are a very necessary measure. Predators, by their very nature, are a danger to all prey species! Their hunting instincts, their unpredictable violence, their *taint,* pose a very palpable danger to galactic peace. The Guilds ensure safety by neutralizing these threats."" He spoke with conviction and a hint of reverence.

Dragon Lord Ember snorted, a puff of smoke leaving her nostrils. ""Dangerous? You called *us* 'dangerous'! We Dragons have lived on our own across from Ponies and other creatures for millenia! If anything, Ponies have started more conflicts against *us* than we had against *them!* We have our own culture, our own laws, some of them *ancient.*"" She quickly rolled her eyes at ""ancient"" for emphasis. ""But we don't 'eradicate' creatures just because they look or act different!"" She pounded a single claw on the table, making the dishes jingle. ""That's barbaric, even for a Dragon!"" She then slumped back into her seat, stuffing a stick of mushrooms into her mouth, then tossing the skewer onto her plate, crossing her arms.

Princess Cadence subtly nodded toward the papers Luna procured, her horn glowing as Luna's aura receded, and brought them to her own face, flipping through the pages, before finding what she was looking for. ""And what about your so-called 'Predator Disease Facilities'?"" She said, her voice diplomatically firm, but laced with concern. ""This here says that they are buildings which house individuals who exhibit 'non-preylike behavior', or... difficult emotions, to undergo *treatments* to suppress their natural behaviors?"" She paused to read ahead a little. ""'Treatments include mood-supression drugs, neuronal electroshock therapy'-"" Everycreature at the table except for the Venlil gasped as our translators described the unfamiliar words for us. *Shocking their brains with **controlled lightning?!** How cruel!*

Ambassador Valek's ears and tail stood up anxiously at our in-unison sound, and at all the eyes on him, before closing his eyes and taking a deep breath. ""Th-these facilities are to rehabilitate people with Predator Disease, Princess Cadence. They are designed to bring people back in-line with communal, prey-centric norms, ensuring their, and others', safety. It is a *compassionate* measure to prevent further suffering, both for the individual and for galactic society as a whole!""

The table shook as everycreature looked to Prince Rutherford, who slammed his mug on the table forcefully, staring daggers at the Venlil Ambassador from behind his braided bangs. ""*Compassionate?!* He shouted incredulously. ""Shooting people with *lightning?!* Yak have big feelings! Very big feelings! Yak smash things! Yak butt horns! Caging somecreature for being different? Or having feelings you don't like?! In Yak culture, we celebrate every form of strength, like anger or sadness. Yak find power in facing emotions, not  smashing them. Yak call that *weakness.* Hurting, not healing."" He removed his hoof from the mug's handle and layed it between himself and his cushion with the others. ""That's *breaking spirit.*"" He said with a cold calmness.

Valek stammered, ""Th-there are plenty of prey species with 'big feelings', b-but that doesn't exempt them from-""

Grandpa Gruff coughed wetly to interrupt before refocusing his only working eye on Ambassador Valek as he interjected. ""Griffon children are rambunctious little whipper-snappers! They play rough, with claws and teeth at times, but we teach them control as they get older! We eat meat not for cruelty, but simply to eat! But to crush those natural instincts out of somecreature, that's not 'rehabilitation.' That's taking away who they really are!""

Ambassador Valek's ears pinned to his head at the shout. Rain Shine stood from her cushion, walked around the table, and placed a comforting hoof on his shoulder before speaking. ""Ambassador, the Kirin understand balance intimately. I know first hoof the impact of denying a creature its true self. Our recent history taught us the consequences of emotional denial. And we are very well aware of the ecological destruction that follows when apex predators are removed from the ecosystem. Wild predators are only 'threats' when they come into a village, in which case you capture them, and return them to their natural habitat. In the wild, they are vital components of a healthy ecosystem. Without them, wild prey populations skyrocket, the grasses are overgrazed, erosion runs rampant along riverbeds, biodiversity plummets, and the balance of nature collapses."" Her voice remained level as she used the flame in the Nirik form of her Kirin eyes to visualize the balance, and subsequent lack thereof. Valek looked mesmerized at the display.

Rain Shine went back to her cushion, and took a bite of her fruit tart, steam billowing out as she kept an eye on the Ambassador the whole way. She swallowed before continuing. ""To *exterminate* a natural part of the world, is to bring about ecological and spiritual disaster. It shows a complete misunderstanding of nature's interconnectedness, and a fear so great that it blinds you to the consequences of your actions.""

Valek looked down into his cup, his eyes betraying his thoughts within as his translator parsed everycreature's words. ""B-b-but... Predators are driven by instinct to hunt and kill!"" He raised his voice slightly, revealing his deep-seated fear inherited through generations of predation. ""Without the Exterminators' purifying flame, their *taint* will spread through the population! The Exterminators use flame to ensure no trace of the corruption is left! The facilities, and the guilds, are for safety! For peace! For order!""

King Thorax, who had been listening silently until then, raised a foreleg to rub the back of his neck, as he spoke up. ""Ambassador, us Changelings had lived by instinct that caused others fear and pain at one point. We also were creatures, and victims ourselves, of our own consumption."" He then leveled his gaze at the Ambassador, ""But the Ponies helped us learn another way, and we transformed. We embraced the sharing of love, rather than just taking it for ourselves."" Valek silently mouthed those words in his own tongue in confusion, before Thorax continued. ""We found true strength by transforming our nature for the better, not destroying it. Your Federation's approach feels less like peace, but more like a house of cards built on widespread fear. True peace comes from understanding, empathy, and most importantly, from integration and acceptance, not forced conformity.""

The room fell silent as everycreature stopped eating, the mood turning sour as Valek looked to each leader. His tail thumped against the floor as his ears twitched anxiously. His mouth opened and closed a few times as if he was searching for a comeback, but the arguments made too much sense. His ""predator-prey"" dichotomy was being gently but firmly questioned by species he barely understood.

I then broke the silence. ""On another note,"" I started diplomatically, ""Your government also presented us images of the Arxur. We understand that this species is a truly horrifying threat to your people. The fact that they are capable of higher thought, but choose to be so cruel is a barbarism Equestria cannot and will not stand for.""

Luna narrowed her eyes. ""They are *true* monsters."" She said with a solemn resolution, reflecting one who is familiar with true nightmares.

""Indeed..."" Cadence added solemnly as she stared into her cup. ""The suffering they inflict is... truly beyond comprehension. We extend our deepest condolences to all victims of their cruelty."" The rest of the table nodded in agreement.

Valek's ears drooped, a hint of raw terror in his eyes. ""The Grays are the reason, your magesties! They are the reason we *need* the Exterminators and facilities! To prevent another species like them from arising! They hunt us, they farm us... They are the ultimate predators!"" He finished with a slight pant.

""We don't deny the threat, Ambassador,"" I said firmly, trying to assuage his fears. ""A creature that goes out of its way to prey on sapient beings *must be* defeated. But wild predators are not the same as these Arxur, and locking away and torturing your problem people makes you seem more like them."" His ears shot up in surprise at this as he opened his mouth to object, but I gently closed it with a quick glow of my horn before cutting him off. ""Equestria will stand with your Federation against this threat, but we will not fight a greater evil by acting as a lesser evil. Our strength lies in friendship and knowledge, not in falling *prey* to the fear that feeds your oppressors."" I then gestured with my head at the rest of Equus' leaders while keeping my eyes' attention on Ambassador Valek. ""We will accept trade in technology, culture, education, and infrastructure, but we will not accept these Exterminator Guilds or Predator Disease Facilities."" 

Everycreature remained silent after my declaration. The Ambassador's ears flattened as he rubbed his paws along the length of his tail, staring into his teacup. The tea, which was meant to bring us together had become a tossed salad of clashing ideas, making for a much more challenging diplomatic exchange than we had expected.

Not wanting the awkward silence to continue as everycreature solemnly stared at the food on the table, I spoke up to dismiss everycreature. ""On that note, I hope everycreature had a wonderful time before this more... serious discussion, and I bid you all farewell.""

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **O’Higgins vs. Huachipato: A Clash of Ambition and Resilience (With a Side of Sarcasm)**

The stage is set for a thrilling Primera Liga showdown between **O’Higgins** and **Huachipato**, two teams with contrasting narratives and decimal odds so tight, they’d make a Swiss watchmaker blush. Let’s break this down with the precision of a goalkeeper saving a penalty… and the humor of a forward who just realized they’re offside.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Math Class You Didn’t Sign Up For

The implied probabilities tell a story of near parity. For **Huachipato**, the best odds are **2.45** (LowVig.ag), translating to a **40.8% chance to win**. For **O’Higgins**, the best line is **2.5** (Bovada), implying **40%**. The draw? A tidy **3.1** across the board, or **32.3%**. Combined, that’s **113.1%**—a textbook vigorish, but also a hint that bookmakers see this as a tight contest.

The spreads? A flat **0.0** for both teams (BetUS, Bovada, etc.), meaning neither is favored. The totals? **2.25** goals, with “Over” priced at **1.83-1.9** and “Under” at **1.73-2.02**. In layman’s terms: expect a game as explosive as a damp firework—maybe a goal or two, maybe a stalemate.

---

### Team News: Injuries, Ambitions, and Copa Chile Shenanigans

**O’Higgins** (6th, 26 points): Under “Paqui” Meneghini, they’re chasing a top-four finish to qualify for international cups. Their motivation? A mix of ambition and the nagging fear of being “just another mid-table also-ran.” No major injuries reported, though their offense has the consistency of a cafeteria coffee machine—hot, then cold, then a sad drip.

**Huachipato** (10th, 18 points): They’re the underdogs with a recent Copa Chile semifinal run (defeating Ñublense 4-3 on aggregate), which is either a sign of resilience or a desperate team bett

I had this Crafted by AJ Fernandez yesterday with a bit of home espresso and was very impressed. 

When you've tried Cuban R&J cigars, one thing that stands out is that they're not particularly strong cigars. And while I'm not even going to compare the experience between Old vs. New world cigars, this AJF blend is surprisingly not a strong cigar, as most of his blends usually are, even in a robusto. 

It's a little coffee and leather bomb, and paired great with coffee. Not a big deal coffee, but it's from Venezuela and harvested at 1750 meters above sea level. ",5,1753109562.0,cafe,0,0.86,False

[**Dayton Contemporary Dance Company & Paul Taylor Dance Company**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/dayton-contemporary-dance-company-paul-taylor-dance-company/) at **Page Auditorium at Duke University**

* Friday, July 25 at 7:30 pm \*Post-Performance Discussion 
* Saturday, July 26 at 12:00 pm \*Children’s Matinee
* Saturday, July 26 at 5:00 pm
* The Dayton Contemporary Dance Company (DCDC) and Paul Taylor Dance Company will (PTDC) close out the ADF season with a shared program that marks a significant milestone, as both companies are stepping outside of their traditional repertory. DCDC will perform Paul Taylor’s 1975 masterpiece Esplanade, a vibrant exploration of human movement, takes pedestrian actions—walking, running, falling—and elevates them to virtuosic heights. Set to the soaring music of Bach’s violin concertos, Esplanade unfolds in five distinct sections, each a testament to Taylor’s choreographic genius. From its deceptively simple beginnings to its breathtaking finale of dancers fearlessly careening across the stage, the work captures the essence of human experience with raw athleticism and emotional depth. PTDC will perform Ulysses Dove’s Vespers, a mesmerizing piece originally crafted for DCDC in 1986. Vespers celebrates sisterhood through the athleticism and grace of six female dancers, driven by Mikel Rouse’s electronic score. Combining faith and abstract movement, the piece captivates with its precise, repetitive choreography and emotional intensity. The work has traditionally been performed by African American repertory companies. This cross-exchange highlights the companies’ commitment to innovation and cultural exchange, making it a truly momentous performance. To conclude the evening, the festival has commissioned internationally acclaimed choreographer and ADF alum Amy Hall Garner to create a groundbreaking new work for both DCDC and PTDC—an unprecedented collaboration. Garner is known for creating innovative works across ballet, modern, and theatrical genres. She will develop the piece during residencies in Dayton and New York City, with a final creative week at ADF before its world premiere on their shared program. The work will then be featured and toured in both companies’ repertories. 
* Admission: $40-70

1m5kvaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1m5kvaj/i_found_this_letter_in_my_aunts_garage/,I found this letter in my aunt's garage,"My aunt recently passed away, and I just found this letter under her desk. I don't know what to make of it, but I know that they found her with chemical burns and cuts on her left arm.

I've typed her cursive letter. Here it is:

>When my grandma died fifty-seven years ago, we went through her stuff to decide what to keep and what to throw away. My parents were busy looking through photo albums in the living room while I was drawn to the bedroom where I used to play with her makeup.

>As I twisted her lipstick tubes open, my teddy bear tumbled under the bed. I reached for it without looking, and instead of my beloved bear, my hands grasped something small and cold to the touch. It was a cracked stone, no bigger larger than an egg, completely white and shaped like a skull with something red seeping in.

>I turned it over, inspecting it from every angle, when the cracks slowly receded until the stone looked brand new. It startled me so much that I dropped it.

>“Oh no,” I gasped, wincing as I expected the stone to break into a million pieces. Except nothing happened. There was not even a dent.

>I quickly slipped it in my pocket and reached for my teddy bear. As I did, I saw a crumpled piece of paper on the floor, likely swept from beneath the bed. On it was written, “Don’t tc” with a trailing line. I shrugged it off, brushed the dust off my bear and returned to the lipsticks.

>For fifty-seven years I’ve kept this peculiar stone to myself, occasionally looking up regenerative material that resembled the stone without much luck. I assumed I must have misremembered what had happened or that my brain added that detail for whatever reason.

>Until today.

>This morning, while I was sipping coffee in my garage, I heard a loud crack. Following the sound’s general direction, I found my skull-shaped stone full of fractures, and changing from white to grey, as if something was moving inside.

>Fascinated more than scared, I picked it up. Red liquid oozed from the hairline gaps, staining my hand. I tried to drop it, but my body wouldn’t move. All I could do was stare at the egg as the red liquid slithered up my arm until the stone turned white again.

>Seconds later, the red veins on my arms transformed into the number 13.

>Panicked, I ran to the bathroom, trying to scrub it off my arm, but it wouldn’t budge. I kept scrubbing, until the number suddenly changed to 12.

>My heart was pounding. Hard.

>“Why did the number change?”

>I immediately set a stopwatch and kept an eye on my arm. Exactly one hour later, the liquid shifted to 11.

>“What does this mean? What’s happened?”

>I hurried  to my desk and opened my browser to look up my symptoms. As I did, my Internet connection failed. No matter how many times I tried to fix it, the connection wouldn’t restart.

>I grabbed my phone and the moment I dialed the number it showed no service.

>“This can’t be happening.”

>Desperate, I snatched my car keys – as I live in the middle of nowhere – and ran to my garage. But my car wouldn’t start and the garage door wouldn’t open.

>“I gotta leave the house, run for it.”

>I rushed to the door, turning the handle. Locked. I inserted the key. It broke off the moment I turned it. The same happened for every other door.

>“The windows! My last hope!”

>Yet, it wasn’t. Every window stayed locked. Any attempt to break them sent a surge of excruciating through my spine.

>I’ve been trapped here for hours, trying to figure out a way out, burning my arm with chemicals, going as far as to carve it with a knife to no avail. No matter what I do, the numbers keep dropping, and I am a prisoner in my own house.

>As a last resort, I swung a hammer at that cracked egg. My attempts resulted in nothing but misses and broken pieces of concrete flying off.

>And now I’m here, writing this letter, hoping someone finds it.

>I do not know what happens when the number hits zero.

>It’s now at 1 and I’m terrified.

>If you happen to find the skull-shaped egg, whatever you do, don’t tc

  
I'm not sure what ""don't tc"" means, but this is really weird. There are chips on the garage floor, but no skull-shaped stone.

My parents say she must've lost her mind because she's been living alone for over two decades.

1m5kuhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1m5kuhz/what_is_a_chaise_sectional/,What is a chaise sectional?,"After spending countless hours researching and testing different types of sectional sofas, I finally understand why chaise sectionals have become so popular in modern homes. Let me break down what makes these pieces special and why you might want one for your living room.

A chaise sectional is basically a regular sofa with an extended seat on one end - imagine a regular couch merged with a lounger. This extended portion lets you stretch out your legs completely while remaining supported, which is perfect for those lazy Sunday afternoons or movie marathons.

I recently helped my sister pick out her first chaise sectional, and the main thing that surprised us was how versatile these pieces are. The chaise portion can usually be moved from left to right, allowing you to rearrange your furniture layout whenever you want. You can check out some great options here: https://explorehomedeals.com/sectional-sofa

What really sets chaise sectionals apart from regular sofas is their space efficiency. Instead of having a separate ottoman or recliner, you get that extra lounging space built right in. This makes them perfect for smaller apartments or rooms where you want to maximize seating without cluttering the space.

The L-shaped design of chaise sectionals also creates a natural conversation area, making them great for entertaining. I've noticed they tend to become the focal point of any room they're in, especially in open-concept spaces.

When it comes to materials, you'll find everything from leather to performance fabrics. If you have kids or pets, I'd strongly recommend looking at stain-resistant options. You can browse through different materials and styles here: https://explorehomedeals.com/sectional-sofa

One thing to keep in mind is measuring your space carefully. While chaise sectionals are space-efficient, they do need enough room for their L-shape configuration. Make sure to account for walking space around the furniture and consider the direction the chaise extends.

Comfort-wise, these sofas are hard to beat. The extended chaise portion provides support for your entire body, making it much more comfortable than trying to prop your legs up on a coffee table or separate ottoman. Trust me, once you try a proper chaise sectional, regular sofas just don't feel the same.

For anyone considering updating their living room furniture, I'd definitely recommend looking into chaise sectionals. They offer the perfect blend of comfort, style, and functionality, making them a worthwhile investment for any home.",1,1753109171.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False
1m5kuho,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiehackers/comments/1m5kuho/a_birthday_reminder_app_with_a_small_twist/,A Birthday Reminder App with a small twist … (😅),"\[open to discussion and criticism 🥹\]

I put together a lightweight birthday-tracking tool that not only reminds when a bd happens (duh) but also creates an estimated profile (personality or psychometric, pick whichever you like) for that person.

Not totally sure the hours paid off (about two weeks, 1/2 hours a day) though I’m convinced the concept is okay and the interface isn’t an eyesore (I’m no designer, so any critiques help before I recycle it in future builds).

Core feature stays 100 % free. A single payment, roughly the price of a coffee, unlocks the deeper profile stats. Sweet deal, nah?

Small launch story:

AppStoreConnect rejected the app at first because I referenced horoscopes. I stripped out every mention, resubmitted with the profiling logic untouched, and they approved it. Tiny life hack?

1m5kt9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1m5kt9z/i_25f_spoke_to_a_guy_39m_and_now_he_has_his_phone/,I (25F) spoke to a guy (39M) and now he has his phone turned off for days.,"

So there is this guy who I met like 4 years ago. He came to my job because our companies cooperated from time to time. He visited like once a month or something. He always looked at me, stared at me. Even asked my boss about my relationship status. Sometimes he came up to me for a chat. I knew he was interested, however, I was in a relationship at a time. My partner died one year ago from addiction and I have been single since.

So this guy stopped visiting us, and I randomly just thought about him like 3 weeks ago.  
I got his number, and called him to ask about something credit score related since he works in finance industry.  
We chatted, he asked about my love life, I told him I'm single since my partner died, he told me he is getting divorced, but spending time with his son (12 years old) and that he will be in my town so we can meet.

It was a light, sweet conversation, obviously there was some sort of attraction on both ends, he seemed kinda shy.

I called him last Monday around 8 PM to ask about his weekend, he called me on Tuesday, we chatted again, about his work, his plans with his son. He told me to go and get a grab a coffee with just the two of us on Sunday(yesterday) since I mentioned I have a birthday. I told him that of course, I want to meet him, I'm open. He told me he wants to see me too.

He told me he has to go because he has a meeting at work. Then he texted me saying that he ""got shy"" and that he got nervous. I told him it's ok. He asked me if I'm seeing anyone recently, because he doesn't want to be inappriopriate. I told him I'm single, that I want to get to know him better.

On the same day, he calls me around 8 PM, he's outside of some restaurant with the coworkers on the lunch. We talk for 1 hour. He says he is ""crazy over me"", that he finds me very attractive, that he was always asking my boss about me, asked for my number. He told me if I'm open to travel with him for 3 days somewhere with my dog?(I have a sweet shihtzu) I say of course I would love that. He then proceeds to tell me ""Do we have to wait til Sunday? I have a hotel booked til Thursday,but I can leave earlier."" I told him that we can meet earlier of course. He told me we can meet tommorow (Wednesday), that he will stay in a hotel, we will go to a dinner.

The conversation went very smooth and we really had a good vibe with each other. We never had a chance to talk for so long, or get to know each other better, so I thought its a good opportunity. He also stated that he thinks about me. He brought up some details from the past - he told me which jeans I wore when he visited our office, or which shoes I wore. Also he told me I once got into some black car and drove off and that he drove behind me but he couldn't find me. (I don't remember that, I didn't know about that).Those little details seemed cute to me. It was like he still remembered. Like those moments from few years ago when we looked at each other were still alive. Illusion, but alive, maybe. Also he texted to me about his age, about the fact that he's not looking for ""fun"" to make this clear, when we talked he spoke about not going for prostitutes or sidechicks, that he is profesional at work considering his work status and stuff.

This conversation took place on Tuesday. On Wednesday, I texted him to confirm the meeting. The message was marked as green, no iMessage sent. I thought he is in a train and out of signal.  
The phone was ""out of signal"" for the whole day. I think this phone number is his private, from what I know. I was surprised.

Thursday, phone out of signal again.

Friday, out of signal. I call him from different number and he picks up after some time. Tells me he has a ""huge accident in his house and that he will call me later, also asks if we can meet'. Doesn't call me again.

Saturday. He calls me by mistake (on my second number, he didn't save it) saying that he is ""standing under number 20"" (I think he meant the door number or apartment number) I say which 20??? what???? and he tells me - Oh my god, I'm sorry.

Hangs up. His phone is out of signal/ out of reach for majority of the days. Sometimes he turns the phone on again so there is a signal but for short period of time.

Sunday. Phone was turned off for the whole day.

I know that none of you knows WHY he's doing what he's doing. But he seemed genuinely interested in me. He really seemed honest and shy about conversation and stuff.

Also, I think thats the big factor in understanding the story - he once visited our company (3 years ago) while being ...under some sort of substance to say at least. Also I found his tiktok account (no videos) and a lot of accounts about drug recovery are being followed by him.

I don't know if he's clean. I know nothing about it. We didn't talk about it. This might be his past but I just think it's worth mentioning. He also told me he is attending therapy because he used to have depression due to divorce.

I know y'all will say to stay away from him, but I genuinely don't know why is he ghosting me like this.  
I think the reasons might be:  
\- he is on a bender and doesn't know what's going on  
\- he knows he is an addict and ""doesnt want to hurt me""  
\- or he is clean from any substances and the reasons is unknown to me still  
Also when I told him I asked someone for his number, he told me that he was happy to give his number to this person to give it to me, and even if I didnt call him, he would ask for mine.

I had birthday yesterday and I wasnt even present or happy with my family because this situation made me feel so sad. I was so hopeful that we will spend time together.

I consider that he might be having a hard time right now. And it was weird, that he picked up the phone after ghosting and quickly said ""I have huge accident, can we meet? I will call back"". I don't know what is he going through right now. But we talked around 6pm and next day around 11AM the phone was already turned off. Why? he knew I was interested. He told me he's happy that I'm so open for communication, that we can talk about a lot.


I felt happy for a new beginning. I'm just a lover girl and I'm learning the hard way. Again...

Cons are that’s a bit awkward im a 19 year old uni student i don’t know how to hold a conversation with an adult or what about, also the consulting firm is more of a help people with retirement not help companies which is what i would want to do, so i don’t even know how helpful advice would be.

1m5kssz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m5kssz,Help us decorate our kitchen to look scandi,"Hi everyone,

Nearly completed kitchen renovation, it was a pretty intense Reno so we are delighted to finally have it nearly finished.

We really like scandi design so would really appreciate any advice with that in mind. The flooring isn't really picking up properly on camera but it's oak coloured. Looking for any tips for it to seem authentic scandi and not too gimic-y.

The Reno was done on a tight budget so it was mostly ex display and what we could get discounted, so the right side through the arch is handleless light grey and the left side, closest to POV is handleless white, ideally it would have all been the same but hopefully we can make it work. Any ideas to make it feel more cohesive and deliberate? The open gap at the white cabinets is for bar stools for a breakfast bar sort of set up.

To the right of POV is an open plan area we are hoping to have a sitting area with a couch and coffee table, that then has double glass doors leading to a sun room where our dining table will go (there's a door at the bottom right of the kitchen just out of pov, facing the oven, that leads into the sun room too) but it's currently filled with tools so we'll deal with it later

Any tips or advice on making this space feel cohesive with a scandi feel would be so appreciated thank you. Shelving, art, decor pieces etc etc and any other ideas welcome! Thank you",1,1753109058.0,HomeDecorating,1,1.0,False

## Key features Analysis

The Moksa Barrel house stands out with its features. Let's dive in.

**Oak Barrel Aging Program:** moksa's aging program utilizes a diverse array of oak barrels sourced from renowned distilleries and wineries. These barrels, previously used to age bourbon, rye, wine, and other spirits, impart unique characteristics to the beer. The specific type of oak, its char level, and the previous contents all contribute to the final flavor profile, creating layers of complexity that are simply unmatched by conventional brewing methods.

Moksa carefully selects each barrel based on its potential to complement the base beer. The brewers meticulously monitor the aging process, regularly tasting and analyzing the beer to ensure optimal extraction of flavors and aromas from the oak. This hands-on approach, combined with years of experience, is what differentiates Moksa's beers and guarantees a final product that is both balanced and exceptionally flavorful.

**Extensive Yeast Library:** Moksa boasts an extensive yeast library that includes both commercially available strains and wild, locally harvested cultures. These diverse yeasts play a crucial role in shaping the beer's initial fermentation and contributing to its overall complexity. Different yeasts produce different esters, phenols, and other flavor compounds, adding layers of nuance to the beer's aroma and taste.

The brewers at Moksa are masters of yeast selection, carefully matching each strain to the specific beer style and barrel profile. They also conduct ongoing research and experimentation with wild yeasts, seeking to uncover unique and exciting flavor combinations. This dedication to yeast diversity is a hallmark of Moksa's brewing philosophy and a key ingredient in many of their limited-release beers.

**In-House Malt Roasting:** Unlike many breweries that rely on external malt suppliers, Moksa has invested in its own in-house malt roasting facility. Allowing complete control over the roasting process, Moksa can tailor the malt profiles to perfectly match the desired characteristics of each beer. They can create custom blends of roasted malts, each with its own unique color, flavor, and aroma.

This level of precision is paramount when brewing barrel-aged beers, where the base beer must be carefully crafted to complement the flavors that will be imparted by the oak. By roasting their own malts,moksa ensures that every beer starts with the highest quality ingredients and a foundation of flavor that is second to none.

**Advanced Quality Control:** Every batch of Moksa beer undergoes rigorous quality control testing to ensure that it meets the brewery's exacting standards. This includes everything from measuring the beer's gravity and pH to conducting sensory analysis by a panel of trained tasters. The goal is to identify any potential flaws or inconsistencies and to make adjustments to the brewing process as needed.

Moksa also utilizes advanced laboratory equipment to analyze the beer's chemical composition, including its alcohol content, bitterness, and levels of various flavor compounds. This data provides valuable insights into the beer's characteristics and helps the brewers to fine-tune their recipes and processes. This unwavering commitment to quality control is apparent in every sip of Moksa beer.

dreamt i heard my alarm go off made my bf a coffee too early, he had to do a long drive with no sleep. Almost crashed.

Sounds unreal IK but hear me out. I have VERY vivid dreams, like wake up believing it’s real life and I can’t tell if it’s real.
I (19F) make my boyfriend (19M) a coffee every morning when he stays with me, but i live about 3hours away with traffic so when he stays over he has to get up at 4:30am to get to work on time, so I get up at 4:15 to make him a coffee and drift back to sleep while he gets ready. 

It’s always still dark at this time.
But today I woke up to what I thought was my alarm going off, got out of bed, turned on all the kitchen lights, boiled a kettle, made him a coffee and woke him up. I found some clean socks for him too bc i’m a uni student and laundry is a rare occurrence and went back to bed after waking him up. He’s so sweet he kissed me on the head and i went to sleep using his thigh as a pillow to get some extra physical touch bc I need to be near him when he’s around.
Then this man is happily sipping on his sweet hazelnut and brown sugar instant coffee, tiredly mentally preparing for a big day.
He drank the coffee then checked the time, then promptly woke me up to inform me i woke him up a whole 4hours too early. Y’all it was 12:15!!! 


I looked at him like he was crazy, so i checked my phone… YUP!! barely past midnight. Literally woke up a 4 FULL HOURS EARLY.
Caffeinated my exhausted boyfriend and genuinely had no clue what else to do other than  weak sorry,, and a giggle bc, face it, it’s funny.

So anyway i receive a call at 6:45 he’s shaky on the phone… he fell asleep at the wheel and almost hit another car while on the busiest highway in AUSTRALIA…. he was ok the other car honked its horn and thankfully woke him up. He would have been in a car accident going 110km/hr, in a car with no airbag, old seatbelts and the car itself is small. Slim chance of walking out alive. 

Moral of the story- check the time before getting out of bed.

EDIT: i moved out of home at 17 for uni. And we don’t do drugs. in the 6ish years we’ve been together it’s the only time it happened ",0,1753108803.0,tifu,5,0.43,False

Coffee lovers always know that perfect blend when they taste it, and the Peet's Coffee 510435 Dark Roast Keurig K-Cup Pods – Major Dickason's Blend didn't disappoint my daily routine. Right on the first brew, it was clear that this is not just another pack of coffee capsules. The flavor immediately hit with a bold and satisfying intensity. This blend, crafted with premium 100% Arabica beans, combines richness with complexity, making every cup feel like a small luxury. With 75 K-Cup pods in the box, there’s an ample supply to fuel my caffeine needs for weeks.

**Ease of Brewing and Compatibility**  
Using these pods couldn't be simpler. As someone who depends on their Keurig machine every morning, I was pleased that they fit seamlessly. Whether rushing before an early meeting or leisurely brewing on a Sunday morning, the reliable compatibility with all Keurig K-Cup brewers made it hassle-free. Each brew had a consistent aroma, body, and taste, without the hit-or-miss experience I’ve faced with other pods.

**Perfect for a Bold Palate**  
Major Dickason’s Blend is a dark roast coffee that truly caters to those like me who thrive on intense flavors. The robustness is not overwhelming, though, as it retains a balance that keeps the finish smooth. Occasionally, I grabbed a mug for a friend or family member, and they always commented on the richness. It’s this caliber of flavor that makes it market-worthy and worth the reputation Peet’s Coffee holds.  

[**Grab Peet's Coffee 510435 at the best price on Amazon.**](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b01n2kfhrs/)  

**Sustainability Efforts Shine Bright**  
One feature I greatly appreciate is the recyclability of the pods. A quick peel and dispose of grounds allow me to recycle the capsule itself. It’s not often that convenience aligns with responsibility, so kudos to Peet’s for making eco-conscious brewing possible. That said, some communities still face limitations in recycling processes for these pods, which remains a consideration.

**Merits**  
- Exceptional, full-bodied flavor thanks to the dark roast and Arabica beans.  
- Ideal compatibility with a range of Keurig K-Cup models for user convenience.  
- A generous 75-count box ensures the supply lasts.  

**Pitfalls**  
- Recycling these pods may not be possible in all regions, making sustainability efforts less accessible.  
- The dark roast profile, while outstanding, might not suit individuals who prefer lighter brews.  

**Product Comparisons with Market Rivals**  
Taking a moment to size this up against some other brands like Starbucks or Green Mountain, I believe Peet's Coffee stands out for its bold character. Starbucks has familiarity on its side, but their dark roast doesn’t capture the same layered and sophisticated profile. Green Mountain, on the other hand, offers milder flavors, which may cater to casual drinkers but lacks the full-bodied depth that Peet’s guarantees. Despite these strengths, Peet's falls short on accessibility regarding recycling when compared to brands offering more widely recycled pod materials.

**Price Performance**  
For the quality of beans and the signature taste it offers, this product balances nicely in terms of cost efficiency. Peet’s delivers a better price-to-quality ratio than many competitors in the dark roast category. If you’re looking for an indulgence that doesn’t stretch the wallet too far, this is undoubtedly worth it.

Coverage from Greensboro News & Record

Greensboro man from Libya detained. Attorney says ICE jailed him despite valid work visa
 greensboro.com/news/local/article_5b6cae96-cc09-4595-b612-18508455a739.html
NANCY MCLAUGHLIN Staff Reporter
July 21, 2025

Nancy McLaughlin
The black scuff marks from the boot of an ICE agent remain just inside a terrified family's home in Greensboro.

The scuff is where the agent's foot was planted to keep the family from shutting the front door.

About 9 a.m. on July 15, three men showed up in casual clothing at Mohamed Ali Aboubaker Naser's home demanding to see him. Naser was at work, maintaining appliances and equipment for a chain of Wendy's fast-food restaurants.

One of the men told Naser's wife that they would come back with ICE reinforcements to surround the house, according to immigration attorney Helen Parsonage of Winston-Salem, who is representing Naser.

After about 15 minutes, the agents left. Almost two hours later, Naser returned home for lunch. The same men, now wearing camouflage clothing and vests that said POLICE, returned and chased Naser as he entered his home, Parsonage said.

The men presented no badges or identification, Parsonage said.

The family tried to push the door shut to keep them out. Bystanders and friends of the family pulled out cameras and started recording. The men left.

A few days later the men would show up at one of the fast-food restaurants where Naser was servicing equipment. He looked up, he told Parsonage, and agents with handcuffs had surrounded him in the restaurant. 

Naser, who just turned 50, came to the United States from Libya legally with his wife, while she worked on a doctorate degree at UNC Greensboro. He has a valid work visa, Parsonage said.

He is not under a deportation order. His case is being compared to reports of thousands of others who have been rounded up and taken to federal detention cells without a deportation order.

Parsonage, who was later able to verify the men were from ICE, said people should be paying close attention to what happens to people like Naser.

Three of his five children are American citizens. He has completed courses at Guilford Technical Community College and has a valid work permit, according to Parsonage.

""After a detailed discussion, it was still not at all clear why Mohamed was targeted. So, I texted and emailed the one agent we had been able to identify to let him know Mohamed had counsel and to ask what this was all about,"" Parsonage said. ""I received no response.""

Later, she said she was told that the agency had received a tip about Naser. The tipster reportedly claimed Naser is Iranian, which is not true.

""We do not know why anyone would do that,"" said Naser's son Ali. ""We had heard about this happening in other places. But we never thought it would happen here. We never thought it would happen to us.""

Parsonage added, ""They (ICE) are pushing the boundaries for sure, to see what they can get away with.""

""The disrespect she feels,"" the 21-year-old Ali Naser said of his mother's interaction with ICE agents on July 15. ""She went out of her way to get the paperwork, and they said they didn't want to see our paperwork.""

That day, the agents left without the Mohamed Naser.

""The whole time my whole family is behind the door,"" said Ali Naser, ""including my little sister.""

That sister is 8.

""Things did go bad, but they could have gone so much worse, and we are thankful for that, "" the son said. ""But what precedence does this set? How worse will they get? I know this isn't Greensboro. I hope our city, our mayor, Gov. Josh Stein, can do something.""

ICE and Homeland Security could not be reached for comment Friday but the episode has unnerved the entire family.

Ali Naser's mother, who asked not to be named, said she has barely slept since the agents came to her door. Naser says his father made him promise to look after his siblings until he returns home and urged him to tell others what happened.

""It would be funny if it were not so traumatizing,"" the son said of agents targeting his dad. ""He's a normal, regular dude. He loves grilling outside and non-alcoholic beers. He watches cooking videos and takes pictures of trees when he goes on walks. Like most Americans, he's tired when he comes home from working so hard. He loves his family. He wants the best for his children.""

The son keeps replaying the day agents came for his dad in his mind and how he had read something similar in school.

""I grew up reading ""1984,"" ""Fahrenheit (451),"" the son said. ""I was taught by the school system that these (books were about) dark dark times would never happen here.""

It is happening here, he said.

On social media, people have expressed outrage that Greensboro, a place that celebrates diversity and at one time was a center in the state for resettling immigrants, is where Naser was grabbed.

""With the new budget, ICE and its hired bounty hunters will soon be showing up in many of our neighborhoods,"" Paul Holcomb wrote in response to the situation on Facebook. ""How do we react individually and collectively?""

One thread was about making sure that people aren't taken away in secret.

""We need to tell the stories,"" responded Deborah Suess, a Quaker minister.

The son said he was home the morning the agents first came, drinking coffee with his mom. The two were looking at pictures shared from a family wedding back in Libya.

Ali Naser said they saw someone outside, and thought they were maintenance people there to do work on the home they rent. He said the family grew uneasy with the way the men were peering in the windows. When they went to see who was outside, the agent stuck his boot in the door. Ali Naser said for the next 90 minutes the family struggled to keep them out.

""She was there holding the door like an offensive line would on a football team for his quarterback,"" the son said of his mother. The entire family held the door, right down to the youngest, who is 8.
They repeatedly asked, in vain, for a warrant or proof that the men were who they claimed to be.
""They were never shown a warrant or badges or anything that would reassure the family,"" Parsonage said. ""The cars the men arrived in were unmarked regular sedans. At one point, the man with his foot in the door brought out a pepper spray and pointed it in Mohamed’s son’s face, threatening to use it.""

As this was happening, Parsonage said, she received several calls from community members who were aware of what was going on, one of whom was outside filming the incident.

""I met the family on Wednesday (July 16) via Zoom,"" Parsonage said. ""They were clearly shaken up and frightened.""

The Naser family has never had any interactions with ICE or the immigration court. Naser's entire criminal record consists of three dismissed traffic tickets for expired registration and inspection from December 2016, Parsonage said.

On July 17, Parsonage got a text that said Naser had been picked up by ICE on his way to work and taken into custody.

""Mohamed knew that was a possibility, but he has a job to do and a family to support so he went to work rather than staying a prisoner to fear in his house, "" Parsonage said.

A few hours later, she said, the agent called her with Naser sitting close by and an Arabic interpreter on the line.

""I was appalled when I found out why they were looking for him,"" Parsonage said.

The agent informed her that there had been national security alert issued on Naser and that he was required to ask him a series of questions about Iran.

""Remember, Mohamed is not Iranian, but Libyan,"" Parsonage said of the questions. ""When I pointed this out, the agent acknowledged that but stated he had been instructed to ask them.""

Parsonage said the questions that followed included:

Has the Iran/Israel conflict affected you?
What impact has the current conflict had on the San Diego-based Iranian community?
What are your thoughts on the current Iranian government?
How is the local Iranian community responding to the conflict?
What do you know of any Iranian assets in the U.S. with intentions to harm the U.S.?
What do you know of Iranian intentions to close the Straits of Hormuz?
To every question, Naser answered that he knew nothing about it and that he is Libyan not Iranian.

""The whole thing was a fiasco, and the agent knew it, and knew someone somewhere had made a mistake,"" Parsonage said. ""But, because of this administration’s zero release policy and daily goals for detentions that officers must meet, we were told that Mohamed would not be sent home to his family. Despite the fact that this was all a mistake.

""Despite the fact that Mohamed has followed every rule. He entered the country with a valid visa. He applied for asylum within the time limit set out by law. He applied for employment authorizations so he can work legally. He is raising a family and is a beloved and respected member of his community.""

There was one question that he was able to answer, Parsonage said.

When asked if he had ever been harassed because of his heritage, Parsonage said he told them. ""Yes, by you when you came to my house to try and kidnap me without any identification or a warrant, and when you detained me today.""

Naser was being held in the Alamance County detention center but called his son Saturday to say he had been transferred to a federal detention center in Georgia.

Parsonage said she will file for a bond. 

""Which he is absolutely eligible for,"" Parsonage said.

It will also take time, but she says that Naser has done nothing wrong.

""The whole thing will have been a colossal waste of time and money,"" Parsonage said.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Helsingborgs IF vs Utsiktens BK: A Tale of Saunas, Meatballs, and Soccer Survival**

Let’s parse the odds like a Swede parsing a IKEA instruction manual—carefully, with a healthy dose of coffee. The bookmakers are split but consistent: **Helsingborgs IF** is the favorite at \~45% implied probability (odds \~2.2), while **Utsiktens BK** sits at \~34% (odds \~2.9). The draw? A tidy 28% (odds \~3.5). For context, this is like betting on a Swedish meatball (Helsingborgs: reliable, classic) versus a vegan lentil ball (Utsiktens: trendy, unproven). Both are round, but only one will sink your hopes.

### Parse the Odds: The Math of Misery

The spread lines (-0.25 for Helsingborgs) suggest this is a nail-biter. Neither team is expected to dominate, which is perfect for fans of *agonizingly close finishes* and *last-minute own goals*. The total goals market is a snoozefest: “Under 2.75” is favored, implying this could be the most polite soccer match since the invention of the handkerchief. If you’re betting on excitement, you’ll need to bring your own.

### Digest the News: Tradition vs. Upstart

Helsingborgs IF, a club with a history longer than a Scandinavian winter, is the elder statesman here. They’ve won the Allsvenskan (Sweden’s top league) 10 times—enough to qualify for a *“How old are you?”* joke. Utsiktens BK, meanwhile, is the scrappy upstart, founded in 2016 by a group of fans who clearly didn’t realize how hard it is to build a soccer team. They’re like that friend who says, “I’m g

1m5klln,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1m5klln/my_ex_pastor_is_paying_off_personal_tax_evasion/,My ex pastor is paying off personal tax evasion debts with church funds and nobody knows,"I recently left my very small church because I found some liens that lead me to believe that the pastor has been evading taxes for 5 years and is in debt over 600k to the IRS. 

After some weird situations that caused me to be suspicious, I did a background check on my pastor. I figured out how to conduct a public record lien search and found 11 of them - all together totaling around $600,000. These liens were from evading taxes on his failed personal business separate from the church.


This church is very small and I was very close with his family and their friends. I found out in 2023 his bank account got completely leveraged by the IRS.  Apparently, one of our friends had opened up a bank account under the pastor’s name before he turned 18. Fast forward to a warm sunny day in 2023, he woke up to his bank account at $0. He had to work hard to prove to the IRS that he was not connected to the pastor and got his money back. I was one of the very few people who knew that this happened.

Later that year, the pastor and his family moved into a nicer rental house, in a nicer area, and it didn’t make sense to me because they had just lost all of their money. I was told that the pastor was given a raise to about 100k per year because he was in some financial trouble and that’s what he needed to continue working as a pastor. I became extremely suspicious because there was no way this church was bringing in enough money to support that kind of salary. This church was his only source of income since he had to shut down his personal business. 

When I say he was “given a raise”, I mean, he gave himself a raise. The “board” of that church consists of about three men who are very close to him. This church is not elder lead, and the pastor never wanted to merge with another church when the congregation rapidly shrunk after covid. The congregation is about 30 to 50 people on a good Sunday. They have been meeting at a temporary location. 
 
The church is currently building a building on a plot of land that they own. They had knocked down their previous building before the pandemic, and are building a new one that is more modern. With grants and loans, charitable donations, and money they got from selling a portion of the land, they have spent around $10 million so far building this new building. They just started a go fund me for 1 million dollars so they can finish the building project. Yes, they are e-begging for a million dollars on social media so they can finish this building. They are using phrases like “almost there!” and “just the last 15%!” to make it seem like a million dollars is not a big ask from the general public in this economy. 

The church is in so much debt and is so tiny, I never understood why they decided to move forward with this building project when the church didn’t have enough money to do it. When I found out about his $600,000 of debt, I realized it’s because this is his only option. His only option is to become a pastor of a nicer larger more modern church so that he can make more money and pay off his debt without anyone batting an eye. 

This entire situation infuriates me. Nobody in the congregation knows about the pastor’s financial situation. Nobody seems to be questioning why the church is making such a grotesque financially irresponsible decision with this building project. Going millions and millions of dollars into debt and saying that is God’s plan. They are just blindly following their leader. Seeing them ask for donations to their GoFundMe every day on Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok is making me lose my mind. They really need a basketball court and a coffee shop so they can bring people to Jesus for 12 million dollars, when they could have just merged with another church - oh wait they can’t merge with another church. How would the pastor pay off his debt that way?

So, my daily thoughts are: how is this guy not in jail? How is he paying this off? How are they going to keep this church running if they ever get the funds to complete the building project, because a building of that size costs millions yearly to upkeep? How is everyone this blind? Advice is welcome.

If I'm breaking a rule, please let me know! ""Kindness and respect"", and all that...)

That's...I jumped on Tirz about 5 weeks ago, and it was awesome! No hunger, still had energy, and after a slower start, the pounds were flying off. I only wanted to lose about 30 pounds to get back to my college weight and fitness, so I've been working out lightly (first time in 15 years) and trying to balance my diet.

Thing is, I started playing a bit of a game with myself - how little could I eat in a day and still not feel hungry??

Very little, was the answer. For a couple of days, all I ate was a banana for breakfast and a side salad for dinner. And I felt fine! I usually suffer from IBS and acid reflux, and those things just went away. I was never hungry, and the pounds were falling off. What a rush! In week four, I lost 6 pounds in 7 days!

Then one day last week I had a ton of house stuff to do - cut the grass, weed the rose garden, rip out an old vanity, do some work in my car, etc. I didn't sleep well the night before - slight heart palpitations kept me up a lot. But hey, you only get one day off to get those things done, so the next morning I dove in.

I had my banana and coffee, and went out to cut the grass. It was 94 degrees, a heat wave for us. I was feeling a bit woozy, and the heart flutters were continuing. I finished the yard and came and drank a ton of water...then tackled the vanity.

The darn marble top weighed over 120 pounds, and I had to demo the cabinets just to get them out. By this time, I was DEFINITELY feeling ill. Weak, A little dizzy, nauseated, and simply exhausted. Im used to hard work, and like an idiot I couldn't put two and two together to figure out what was going on.

I got the vanity top out into the garage, and just about collapsed. It was there that I somehow decided I would just lay down for a minute on the garage floor and rest a bit. Thats where my wife found me. She thought I was dead! She had to shake me for a full minute to get me to respond. She says I was not coherent, though I remember just feeling like I woke up disoriented.

She got me in the car and took me to the emergency room. Bottom line -

For the full article check out:

There are good days in water treatment. The kind where the plant hums along, the SCADA screen looks like a Christmas tree of green boxes, and you have enough time to actually drink your coffee before it goes cold.

And then there are days when the universe decides to humble you.

This is a story about the second kind.

It Started With an Interview…

Technically, it was my day off. I’d already committed to coming in for a quick interview—a one-hour meet-and-greet with a promising candidate. Simple, right? In and out. Maybe I’d even swing by Wawa afterward like a normal civilian.

Instead, the universe clocked in early.

While I was wrapping up the interview (rushed, of course), I got word that things were unraveling at the plant. My regional utility manager was covering the facility with a trainee, and let’s just say they weren’t having a chill morning. Multiple alarms were going off, pressures were spiking, and the system looked like it had been possessed.

Naturally, I did what any plant manager does when the fan is spinning and the proverbial crap is airborne—I grabbed my hard hat and sprinted into the chaos.

The Phantom High Pressure

First up: our low-pressure pumps—normally the peaceful middlemen feeding our RO high-pressure pumps—were faulting out from high pressure. SCADA was screaming numbers over 100 psi on a line that usually lives around 50. Alarming, yes. Physically possible? Not unless someone plumbed it into a fire hydrant overnight or—just maybe—dead-headed it with a closed valve.

At first, I assumed it was a data glitch. Then came the creeping suspicion: what if there was a valve downstream that got closed during flushing, maintenance, or by someone trying to be helpful?

A quick visual check ruled that out, so I moved on to the next likely suspect: a faulty pressure gauge. Classic move. And hey, it wouldn’t be the first time one went belly-up mid-shift.

We pulled the gauge. Swapped it out.

Boom—the pressure reading dropped, but then we lost the sensor entirely. No signal. At the same time, a nearby level transmitter also went dark. Not the entire panel or plant—just those two data points.

Turns out we blew a fuse during the gauge replacement. I’d love to say it was the new guy’s fault, but no—this one’s on us. Rookie move. It wasn’t catastrophic, but losing pressure and level readings at the same time certainly didn’t make things easier.

Eventually, we located the fuse, popped in a replacement, and got the pressure sensor and level transmitter back online. Crisis averted?

Of course not…

Costa Coffee has become more than just a coffee shop—it’s a symbol of consistency, quality, and creative evolution. What began as a small London-based roastery has grown into one of the most beloved global coffee brands, including a strong presence across Cyprus.

# A Legacy of Taste

Founded in 1971 by the Costa brothers, Costa Coffee built its reputation by perfecting its **signature Mocha Italia blend**—a bold yet smooth roast that continues to define the brand. This attention to craft laid the foundation for Costa’s global success.

# Innovation That Enhances the Experience

What sets Costa apart isn’t just its heritage—it’s how the brand **embraces innovation** without losing its roots. From smart coffee kiosks to sustainable packaging and tech-enhanced cafés, Costa has proven that tradition and technology can work hand in hand.

In Cyprus, this combination is especially apparent. Whether you're visiting a cozy Costa in Nicosia or grabbing a to-go order in Larnaca, the brand delivers a modern café experience backed by decades of expertise.

I am seeking a serious relationship with a nice lady this is a long post please read it in full before messaging me,"Hi  there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is ages between 25 and 32 and please have maturity and decency many thanks. 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!",1,1753107926.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

It's draining. I will shut my curtains tight and hide until I can manage to get energy to face the day.. by mid afternoon the lighting and daylight makes me want to nap. 

This may be why I always had to have a PM tea or coffee, aside from people masking - this sensitivity may be the over stimulation I was suppressing. 

I never wore sunglasses as a child but adored baseball caps.. but they weren't allowed at school or seen as girlie... I had always had a mean squint too growing up because of poor vision, people must have thought im just angry or revolted by everything. I got contacts because glasses and glare and weight - cleaning them ? Ick.

1m5ka5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricScooters/comments/1m5ka5c/apollo_pro_4month_review/,Apollo Pro: 4-month review,"I wanted to share some thoughts about my Apollo Pro purchase from back in March 2025. To give a little bit of history about my scooter experience... this is my first ever electric scooter. I have rented many e-scooters downtown (Raleigh, NC) but never personally owned one. After doing a fair amount of research the quality of Apollo scooters seemed like a good fit, despite the high price tag (\~$2500). I know that I do not fall into Apollo's typical demographic for the Apollo Pro, as typical customers have already purchased 1 or more electric scooters.

Here are my main takeaways:

1. Build Quality - Excellent!! I would be hard-pressed to find another scooter with such robustness. The frame is extremely solid. They did have an issue in the early days with the folding mechanism latch, but with the added silicone strap I have found no issues. I am curious to see how this scooter will hold up not just over 3 months, but 3 years.
2. Design - It is truly the Cadillac of electric scooters. I have gotten multiple comments from people around town that they have recognized me on it because of how much I stand out, thanks to the customizable, colored lights on the deck and stem. (This might be a con if you want to be more subtle while riding). However, I think it boosts safety significantly. REGENERATIVE BRAKING IS AMAZING!!! The Apollo design team has created hands-down the best regen braking system on the market. It is truly incredible. I am able to effortlessly come to a stop 95% of the time without ever having to touch my mechanical brakes. The braking is extremely smooth and it is always a very predictable, controlled stop.
3. Safety - The tires are larger than most electric scooters in this class (12 inches) and that makes traveling at higher speeds (35+mph) feel much more comfortable. The suspension absorbs so many road imperfections. I have gone through several (2+inch) potholes and made it through fine (just make sure you're holding the handlebars tightly). A general note about electric scooters: YOU CANNOT RIDE ONE-HANDED. I have ridden a bike for years and I love riding large stretches one-handed or no hands. You cannot do this on any scooter. You can very easily fall.
4. Battery / Range - I ride my scooter almost always in fastest mode (Ludo) because I love having the full acceleration unlocked. I find it to be the most enjoyable experience. However, riding at these higher speeds SIGNIFICANTLY inhibits range. If riding in everyday, comfort mode (max 20mph) you can pretty easily get 40-50 miles of range. That drops by over a third if riding in Ludo mode. I just went on a longer trip yesterday (\~30 miles) and when I got home my battery was at 10% (starting at 100%). What does this mean... PLAN, PLAN, PLAN!! If you are going on a one-way trip that is 15 miles+ away from home, make sure to lower the mode you are riding in. The alternative is to pack your charger with you and stop somewhere and find an outlet to plug it in for an hour to get you an extra 10 miles of range or so. This is where I am slightly disappointed with Apollo's range claims of 31-62 miles. I assumed it was only going to be on the lower end if you were pushing max speeds of 40 mph consistently. However it appears, just by being in FAST/LUDO mode and traveling at an average of 25mph the major cause of the battery drain is the rapid acceleration. I will say charging speeds have been really good (I can fill up a dead battery in under 8 hours).
5. Performance - I already touched on this a little with the battery/range discussion, however I do have to say I am very impressed overall with the pickup / acceleration. When comparing it to similarly sized public electric scooters, it blows the doors off these LIME / SPIN rentals. When I purchased this scooter I did contemplate waiting for the Apollo Phantom 2.0 STELLAR as the acceleration numbers looked really good (0-20mph in 2.3s) compared to the PRO which gets to 20mph in almost twice that time. However, practically day-to-day it isn't completely necessary. If you purchase the PRO, you aren't looking for just the fastest scooter; there are several scooters on the market that give you a better bang for your buck (price v. raw performance).
6. Cons - I don't have too many cons, but a few include...

\- headlight: not very bright on a very dark night

\- kickstand: it looks pretty cool, but it requires picking up the scooter to lock it in, and it becomes a hassle

\- buttons (horn, turn signals, power): all seem to be placed in a way that you will constantly bump them when you move your hands around the handlebars

\- app: upon first inspection the app seems very nice, however I have found it to be much more buggy than I would have thought. The map / ride tracking has worked intermittently.

Overall, I am very happy with my purchase. I use it to ride to work most days of the week (approx. 4 miles one-way) and it is faster than driving my car, and I am saving gas. I carry my charger with me, in my backpack and charge it at work. The battery can last almost a week if I am just commuting back and forth to work. While the up-front expense was rather high for the scooter, I think the versatility has been amazing. For example, when I am having work done on my car... I just throw the scooter in my trunk and then zoom off to a coffee shop or ride the greenway trails, instead of having to wait hours in the waiting room. Fast casual restaurants and grocery stores never have an issue with rolling it inside and placing it next to your table, or walking with it in the aisles to get a few grocery items. If you are looking for a jack of all trades e-scooter, this one might be for you. Good acceleration, decent top speed, very nice design/light features, excellent regen braking, and good customer support are just some of the reasons I think I will be staying with Apollo for future e-scooter purchases.

I wanted to post the story of my own medical abortion on this subreddit as reading other people’s stories really helped me through the process and I want to contribute back to that. I can try to answer any questions as well!

 My cycle is usually extremely regular so once I was a single day late, I tested with a dollar store strips pregnancy test and found out I was pregnant on July 1st. 
 I ordered my pills through AidAccess on July 2nd. The process was very simple, cost me $150 which I split with my boyfriend, but they also offer financial aid for anybody in need! They were scheduled to arrive on the following Monday at my home (in another state, as I was with my boyfriend at that time), so I ended up having to take them on July 8th at ~4 weeks. The packaging was super discreet in a cardboard envelope and not loud at all so my parents weren’t suspicious. I did tell my mom about my abortion in case of any emergencies, and my boyfriend of course knew and did his best to stay updated and support me, but everything actually went really smoothly! Here’s the timed updates I took as everything was happening: (referring to Mifepristone as Pill 1 and Misoprostol as Pill 2).

7-8-25: (was not feeling good this day, preexisting nausea from pregnancy and anxiety)
10:09: I’m extremely nauseous before taking pill 1. Waiting for my Dramamine to kick in. Had a bit of coffee to stop caffeine headaches later. Drinking a lot of water before taking pill.
10:18: took pill 1.
11:29: was nauseous all morning. Finally threw up a lot of just water and coffee. Had well over an hour to absorb luckily, shouldn’t affect the abortion after 30 minutes. Definitely feeling weak and odd but overall okay. Took two ibuprofen due to preexisting headache.
Slept til about 1:30
3:00: went to the store to prep for good grazing foods for tomorrow when I expect the nausea and pain to really hit me. Got cherries, blueberries, pickles, yogurt, and protein bars to keep by the bed
5:50: went to the bathroom and had pink discharge upon wiping! Means the first pill is working and the pregnancy has likely died by now. Relieving to see, no pain at all so far in my uterus. Nausea has mostly gone away this afternoon.

7-9-25:
Woke up nauseous but wayyyy less and no headache
Prep for second pill: fruits and liquid IV
11:45: took two Dramamine and four ibuprofen. Had to go pick up something for my dad so I wanted to give those meds some time to simmer before coming home and starting the bleeding process
12:20: took the first four pills and let them dissolve under my tongue. Don’t really taste like anything at all! Easy to hold there. Dissolved completely in bout ten minutes. Feeling a bit anxious and shaky (I am a very anxious person in the first place) but ready to see what happens! Gonna drink more fluids for now. No nausea or pain upon the full dissolving and hopefully the additional medications I took help keep that minimal.
12:38: already beginning to feel the cramps I’d feel during a period. Nothing major. Just the “my period just started and suddenly I have to poop” cramps. Got my heating pad out and nursing fluids (: 
For about thirty minutes after taking the first dose of the second pill, my cramps felt almost unbearable very quickly. I just layed down and closed my eyes with my heating pad and let it wash over me. Like the instructions say; cramps mean it’s working. After about 30 minutes though, they subsided back to manageable and after an hour it felt like almost nothing again. My body feels cold which is odd because I’m under a blanket in the summer but I’m not shaking or anything. I have bad circulation in the first place though.
3:30: took second dose of second pill. Pain had absolutely leveled out to feel like another regular period. Went to the bathroom right before taking this dose and passed quite a bit of bloody tissue. It was about the size of my middle finger at the bottom of the bowl. No white tissue I could see, but might’ve been the pregnancy passed. Was able to eat my sandwich before second dose.
4:05: another large clot passed. Diarrhea begun. Straight liquid poop. Prostaglandins will reach across to your anus as well since it’s so close to your uterus, so expect to poop a lot as well.
6:33: Took final dose. haven’t had any major uterine pain since that initial dose. Passing clots every hour or so. Bleeding pretty heavily but nothing worse than the first day of a bad period for me. Eating fine. No nausea. Diarrhea continuing. Overall great! Definitely need to chug water, drinking Gatorade now. Went to bed around 8pm

7-10-25:
Woke up about 9:30am with no more cramps. Full pad and clots in the toilet but feeling so much better. No nausea!!! 
6:00PM: Been feeling great! Went to work from 1-5:30. I work at a pet shelter so I was moving a lot in the heat. Passing very minimal clots now with virtually no cramping, but still bleeding a lot. No nausea or other side effects. Truly just feels like the second day of my period now (: bleeding has finally slowed significantly from all the clots yesterday.

7-11-25: still bleeding a little bit. Usually passing a large clotted amount in the morning and minimal bursts throughout the day. Bleeding can continue for 2-3 months for most people and it’s usually until your next period. Considering taking iron pills to avoid complications with anemia or other blood loss issues, as this is shaping up to be a suuuper long period for me. Otherwise doing well!

I continued to bleed the following weeks. It felt like a super long period but nothing unmanageable. No more pain, just lots of pads.

7-21-25:
Took a pregnancy test today and it came out completely negative! Very happy to see this as some people can test positive for weeks afterwards. Bleeding has finally slowed down to a pantiliner amount in the last three days. No longer red, mostly pink and some brown. Body is finally healing up and my cycle should be resetting soon. I’ll post a final update once I get my next period. Going to be looking into hormonal birth control 💔 which I’m really not excited for but will hopefully not disturb my fertility over the next five years while we plan for our children. 

I hope this can help somebody with their own medical abortion. I was very lucky that it went as smooth as it did. I would say the cramping was up to a 7/10 for those first thirty minutes after my second pill, but after that was truly so manageable and I had no other side effects. Very thankful to AidAccess for providing me with the medications and their responsiveness via email whenever I was worried or had questions, and hoping I can donate to them in the near future and encourage anybody who can to help support others in this subreddit who may not have the financial means. Good luck to everybody in this sub and hoping for smooth processes and good health for all of you ❤️🙏🏻",1,1753107818.0,abortion,0,1.0,False

**size and Dimensions:** The size of the tree log table should be proportionate to the space where it will be placed. Consider both diameter and height when choosing a table. Smaller tables are ideal for use as bedside tables or accent pieces, while larger tables can serve as coffee tables or side tables in living rooms. Ensure that the table's height complements the surrounding furniture, such as sofas or chairs, to create a cohesive look.

**Finish and Sealing:** The finish and sealing of a tree log table are crucial for protecting the wood from moisture, scratches, and stains. Common finishes include natural oil, varnish, and polyurethane. Natural oil finishes enhance the wood's natural beauty while providing a matte finish. Varnish offers a durable, glossy finish that protects the wood from wear and tear. Polyurethane provides a highly resistant coating that is ideal for tables that will be subjected to heavy use. Additionally, a high-quality sealant will prevent moisture absorption, and the related damages.

**Base and Support:** The base of a tree log table provides stability and can significantly impact its overall design.Some tables feature a simple wooden base that complements the natural aesthetic, while others incorporate metal or acrylic bases for a more modern look. Consider the weight capacity of the base and ensure that it can adequately support the tabletop, and also any items that you may place on it.

**sustainability and Sourcing:** Environmentally conscious consumers should consider the sourcing of the wood used in the table. Look for tables made from sustainably harvested wood or reclaimed wood to minimize their environmental impact. Certifications such as FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) can help ensure that the wood is sourced from responsibly managed forests. Purchasing tables crafted from locally sourced wood can also reduce transportation costs and carbon emissions.

**Natural Edge and Grain:** Many tree log tables feature a natural edge, preserving the unique contours of the original log. The natural edge adds a touch of rustic charm and makes each table one-of-a-kind. The grain patterns of the wood also contribute to the table's aesthetic appeal. Opt for tables with interesting and varied grain patterns to enhance their visual interest.

1m5k66a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m5k66a,First HPDE Track day,"Decided to give track a try, it was AMAZING. Most car fun I’ve ever had in my life (44 years).  Took the M6 scat to the new motor enclave near my house - I was definitely the odd man out, lol.  GT3 Rs, GT350r, Z06s, and my big heavy 392 - and it was awesome.

Have the dynamics package on my Challenger and that was a lifesaver.  The Brembos stayed strong all day, got a bit of brake fade at the end (95 degrees outside, it was HOT) due to brake fluid temps, oil temp was hot but stayed at 275 and didn’t go higher, coolant temps were rock solid at 235 and zipped right back down to 205 during cooldown lap.  Got about 7mpg, burned glass a tank of gas in 40 miles!

Following my instructor in his M3 comp was so fun, when you get the lines right the Challenger eats up the track and stays right with it. Could see where I was hitting the traction limits and it was easy to predict and account for.  

Got smoked in the straightaways. On the high speed part, I could maybe hit 121 before it became a big braking event with the corner coming up - following the M3 and the GT350r was so cool - when they dropped the throttle and you hear those engines scream, no feeling in the world compares.  Also watching them run away from me in the high speed zone while I’m going left in the dust is humbling, but still fun.  They must be hitting 130-140 before that same corner. 

With good lines I could keep up in the curves  but I’m pretty sure as driver skill increases in the advanced classes that’s where I’d be unable to keep up. 

I tell you what though - this car is half the price and I still had the best time of my life and my Challenger was absolutely up to the occasion.  Not the fastest but totally capable and trustworthy and solid machine and none the worse for the wear!

The community of people hanging out between groups was the second best part, a bunch of like-minded people just having fun and talking cards and best ways to take which corners, getting to see awesome cars up close and seeing them get used at their maximum - like cars and coffee with but racing and cooler people.

1m5k4v6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1m5k4v6/can_the_zwilling_enfinigy_electric_kettle/,Can the ZWILLING Enfinigy Electric Kettle Revolutionize Your Kitchen?,"The ZWILLING Enfinigy 53101-201 kettle caught my attention because of its sleek black finish and the promise of practical features like a double-walled, cool-touch exterior. As someone who relies on a solid electric kettle on a daily basis, especially for brewing that perfect cup of tea on busy mornings or heating water for quick recipes, testing this product felt like inviting a highly-rated guest to my kitchen that needed to prove its worth.

**Design That Demands Attention**  
One of the first things I noticed when unboxing this electric kettle was its modern, minimalist design. The black stainless steel finish had a premium look that felt engineered for sophisticated kitchens. It pairs a seamless, 1.5-liter carafe with a concealed heating element—a smart move for avoiding those tricky cleaning sessions when gunk builds up in hard-to-reach spaces. It's sturdy without being bulky, and the compact footprint fit perfectly on my overpopulated countertop. Plus, the integrated cable winder was a real win for keeping the setup clean and clutter-free.

**Effortless Performance for Daily Use**  
Using this kettle felt incredibly intuitive. The protective 70° lid opening kept the steam from blasting into my face, which solved a minor gripe I’ve had with earlier models from other brands. Heating up to 50 ounces of water was surprisingly fast, taking just a couple of minutes, thanks to the 1500-watt power base. I tested it by making multiple cups of tea alongside instant noodles, and the consistency truly wowed me. The water temperature held steady, and I didn’t have to wait for long refills. Bonus: the exterior stayed cool the whole time—essential for avoiding accidental burns when I’m moving too quickly on groggy mornings.

**Highlights**  
- The double-walled body retains heat while remaining cool to the touch, which feels incredibly well-thought-out.  
- Fast heating paired with dependable utility from its powerful 1500-watt mechanic.  
- The sleek and compact design naturally integrates into small or organized kitchens.

**Build Quality as Promised**  
The kettle is proudly engineered in Germany, but also carries Milanese design influences, courtesy of Matteo Thun and Antonio Rodriguez. It's always fascinating when functionality meets artistry, and this kettle doesn't disappoint. It’s robust yet lightweight at just under three pounds, and there’s a five-year warranty included—offering peace of mind for klutzes like me who’ve broken their fair share of glass kettles in the past. Also, cleanup was a breeze because of the residue-free stainless steel material.

**Boons**  
- Durable build with an included five-year warranty.  
- Hygienically seamless, easy-to-clean stainless-steel interior.  

**Potential Limitations**  
While the ZWILLING Enfinigy kettle has a lot going for it, there were a couple of hiccups worth noting:  
- No temperature customization settings; it boils water competently but offers zero flexibility for different brewing needs like French press coffee or white tea.  
- The exterior black finish is prone to showing fingerprints, which could become annoying for perfectionists.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this kettle with other popular brands such as Breville or Cuisinart models, I noticed some clear advantages with the ZWILLING kettle’s double-walled touch safety, which is rare even in more expensive rivals. However, Breville’s Smart Kettle edges this one out in terms of advanced features like temperature presets for various beverages. Meanwhile, Cuisinart offers stainless steel alternatives with handles more ergonomic, especially for those with smaller hands. Clearly, this stylish kettle thrives in the middle ground—it doesn’t break the bank while still delivering reliable German-engineered performance.

**Cost Efficiency for Kitchen Enthusiasts**  
As someone working within a budget but unwilling to settle for second-rate kitchen gadgets, I found the price-to-quality ratio of this electric kettle quite favorable. It doesn’t include all the bells and whistles of higher-end models, but what it does offer far outshines basic models in the same range. The extra safety, no-residue interior, and space-saving design make it more than suitable for modern kitchens or even office pantries.

I’ve been doing that when I’m out. Give a stranger a small passing compliment or comment (as long as they’re not in a hurry or busy), a brief positive exchange, and ‘have a good one’. 

I thought like since it makes me feel good because they smile back, laugh with me, and we both wish each other well. And I’m worried I’m being performative or attention seeking and I’m like inconveniencing them.
