I'm biased because tiramisu is one of my favorite desserts, but I still haven't found the perfect tiramisu ice cream. 

Weirdly, the star of this pint is the shortbread. I had a bite with the mascarpone base, ladyfingers, and espresso swirls...kind of blissful. I also really liked that there wasn't a strong liqueur flavor that you get with a lot of tiramisu ice creams/gelato.

All in all I would guy again and maybe pry off the top ganache. The rest is pretty good. The mix ins weren't that well dispersed, so I just had a lot of mascarpone base and was a bit underwhelmed. When you get the mix ins it's great.",2,1746932885.0,icecream,0,1.0,False

1kjr869,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kjr869/ocd_im_not_sure_what_would_help/,OCD (Im not sure what would help),"I love my job, but one of my coworkers makes it annoying. She always gets on me, saying I don't clean or leave things messy, which is sometimes true, but also not entirely true. We work at a Starbucks inside a Kroger; the kiosk isn't that big, so we don't have much space, but enough for at least two or four people (four is a reach).

I will admit I have a habit of leaving things out because, once that thing is done, I go on to the next step. If I'm making a drink and I pour the milk—okay, milk is done. It's step-by-step, so I do leave things out, but after I'm done, I put them back. It might be a little delayed, like a minute, but I do put them back. I am good at cleaning. I'm one of the best closers, and I have a 100% cleaning and i actually enjoy wiping things up.

During slow moments, it's easy to catch up on things. I usually do dishes or work the register. When you're on register, your job is to release it—mine is to do what I've been taught: drop off the register, take orders, clean dishes, and work the oven. I'm usually on register, as I said, but I can't make tricks. I do make drinks. I don't like making drinks, but I do make them. During rushes, it all gets mixed up because I might get pulled to Uber Eats during downtime and help make drinks, which is fine during a rush. We can have one thing going halfway to a different department. And we can have mobiles coming in, not to stop my coworker. We can call Anna; she likes to stop mid-rush and clean. She hates clutter and thinks I leave a mess after rushes and during rushes, which is understandable because it's a rush, especially now that we have new cups and old tops that don't fit.I clean during rushes, keeping up with everything listed above.  The hot and cold bars are usually the messiest, or sometimes I'm not doing dishes fast enough. I'm unsure; I dislike stopping mid-rush to clean because customers become upset, which has happened before.

 We had downtime for cleaning. Customers came, and I took three orders. The first customer asked if something was wrong with her drink because she hadn't received it yet; she saw the customer after her receive their Pike Place Roast. Making house coffee, including the Pike Place Roast, is part of my register duties. I turned around, and Anna was cleaning, not even working on the customer's drink.


She says I don't make enough drinks and that she does all the work. She said she would stop making drinks because I didn't do enough. Today, I was going to pull milk, use the bathroom, and do something a manager wanted. She knew this; I delayed everything to help her and leave her at a good point.  She stopped making drinks because I wasn't doing enough, meanwhile I actually worked from 9:00 am to 3:49 pm.  I left at 4:00 pm after taking orders, doing dishes, and working the oven. 
 
She told me today, after I agreed to clean something (which I have no issue with, just a time and place issue), but she interrupted me, saying that because she has OCD, I have to be clean.

I have health issues i have one of the most painful skin conditions. (HS) I'm blessed and lucky it's stage one, but stage one doesn't mean I have less pain, just less frequent pain. I don't like using my issue to cheat out of working days; I go in. At most, I just say, ""Hey, I'm moving slowly today, sorry,"" but things on my half always get done. I don't like it when people use their issues against someone else because it's their issue.
With her ICD, I've noticed that when things aren't done, she gets mad at me. She'll get on me while I'm taking customer orders. I told her I would do it, but when I was going to, I realized I was missing milk; I couldn't do it without milk. I went to get milk, and since we had customers, I took their orders. I didn't do what she wanted quickly enough. Customers have told us to calm down and work together because, during these moments, while I'm taking orders, she'll criticize me. 

I don't usually respond because I'm working with someone; it just gets difficult because I feel like I have to do things when she wants and abide by her cause she'll get mad. I've told her after she got on to me and said I'm not cleaning up after you any more as if that hurt me I said You don't have to worry about me care about yourself. I love my job I just hate working with her. I don't know what to do

Stay with me as this is a juicy story.

My Mother and Father have been going through a seperation for over three years now, My mother is moving to Iowa and I want to go live with her. As of posting date, I have helped her empty her RV and we are having her sleep in my house with my dad and my two sisters. My dad is a difficult woman (yes my dad is transgender, cry about it. I can't do nothing) and has been complicating things. 

My dad is unreasonably strict, grounds me at least once a month for petty things, puts large amounts of stress on me for school and can barely afford to pay bills as he spends at least 200 dollars a week on stuff for himself.

We are more than likely going to end up having to take this to court instead of settling it quietly. My dad has yet to be informed about any of this information.

My Mother on the other hand is on her way to becoming a very successful woman. She spends more time with me than my dad spends on the couch watching YouTube and drinking coffee. (which is a lot) She Loves me unconditionally and has a boyfriend up in Iowa (who if they get married would be my Step father) who would treat me infinitely better than my current father. Moving to Iowa would also give me a restart as I have already screwed my own life into the ground, I get bullied, failing school from personal issues, Worked like a dog at my house, treated like dogsh-t, ECT..

Now that you have been caught up on the  happenings, my question is who is more likely to win the case if this heads to court. I'm getting anxious due to me probably having to testify in Court. I know that Alabama law states that the child's preference is taken into account but isn't the deciding factor. ",2,1746932226.0,legaladvice,0,1.0,False

1kjr3at,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1kjr3at/aio_wifes_relationship_with_coworker_makes_me/,AIO wife’s relationship with coworker makes me uncomfortable to say the least,"Let me start this off with saying that I absolutely trust my wife, completely and wholeheartedly. But I think her judgment is either lacking or she likes the attention she is getting.

So a couple years ago one of my wife’s male coworkers made a comment directly to her that he would hook up with her if he was single. She came and told me about it immediately, and told me that it made her uncomfortable. Since then they have become close friends and over the past 6 months or so have been talking constantly outside of work, and go to lunch, and grab coffee together almost daily. She told me a couple months ago that he had made more comments about how her ass is the only reason he likes coming into the office, has told her how all Mexican men cheat in their wives (he’s Mexican), and has told her the only reason he’s still with his wife is because she takes complete care of him almost like mothering him. And I told her I didn’t like that and I was upset and she defended his actions and said that’s just how he is with every girl he is close with and his wife doesn’t care because she knows he won’t actually do anything. 

Now, I’ve been taking Wellbutrin for ADHD for a few months and it has caused massive anxiety, and this situation had me completely spiraling. We recently got Life360 for our teenage kids but one day I got an alert that she left work, not unusual as it was around lunch time. I was busy working so I didn’t check it till about 20 minutes later and freaked out when it showed her at a hotel. My ex wife cheated on me so my reaction to this was not great, I went like straight into a panic and asked her where she was. She told me that her, her male coworker, and their boss were having lunch outside by the river, which was right next to the hotel. 

The next evening as we were packing to spend a long weekend alone together she could tell something was wrong and kept asking, so I sat her down and told her how I was uncomfortable with their relationship and gave her all the reasons why. She apologized profusely and said she had no idea I felt this way. Then she offered to distance herself from the situation and do whatever I needed to be comfortable. And said she wouldn’t talk to him outside of work anymore. She also talked to him and she told me that he felt terrible and liked me and never wanted to disrespect me. Then I screwed up Monday morning (or maybe not, I don’t know). When she was getting ready for work she put a thong on and I have never seen her wear one in my life, so I asked her about it. Later that day she started accusing me of scrutinizing everything she does and she’s feeling like she’s being controlled, and suggested I turn off my Life360 alerts so I don’t obsess over it all the time (which I wasn’t at the time but then felt like maybe I should be). This made me more anxious and made me feel like she was gaslighting me and trying to get me to be less aware of what she’s doing. 

I’ve started weaning off the Wellbutrin because I felt my reaction was extreme. I’ve never been an anxious person and I’ve never been the jealous type, even to the extent my wife has said that she wishes I was sometimes. I’m feeling more back to normal but I’m still not comfortable with their relationship or the things he’s said or her reaction to the things he’s said. She has never once told him it was inappropriate or asked him to stop. We are likely going to his party next weekend and I plan on confronting him and laying down some boundaries, and I kind of hope his wife overhears me layout the things he’s said and that I won’t allow that to happen again. Because I really don’t know if she is ok with that or if my wife was just saying that and she should know how he talks to other women. AIO with being upset about this?

Thinking of getting a Timemore E01,"After several years using a Timemore C2, I was thinking of upgrading and getting an electric grinder. After reading some online reviews, and taking into consideration my price range (around 300 €), I had narrowed it down to the following models:

- Baratza Encore ESP
- Wilfa Classic
- Fellow Opus
- Fellow Ode 2

The Wilfa is far too bulky for me, and I don't really need the huge hopper, plus I don't super like the design. The Baratza is still too bulky but at least the design is a bit slicker imo. The Fellow Opus feels a little plasticky. I know the gold standard has been the Ode 2 but I don't really like the fact that it can't handle espresso. Even though espresso is not currently on my radar, I don't like knowing that it's flat out not a possibility, which is what you get with the Ode 2.

Earlier today I was looking at grind settings for the C2 and discovered that Timemore had 2 new electric models, the E01 and the 01S. The E01 looks much nicer and the reviews I've seen seem convincing, however I can't find a lot of info online and am a bit torn. I also don't super like the fact that it doesn't have a cord and relies solely on battery. That said, it seems like it's quality built, is quite compact and sturdy and am really considering.

Any advice? Anyone has one and care to weigh in? Amy other electric grinders I might have overlooked?

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress. The type of connection I want strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavor.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations and thoughts. I also adore writing conversationally, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography is also something I dabble in, although not as much as I'd like. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, and coffee.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.

1kjqy24,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kjqy24,"Need Advice- Young Female ratty, chewed through cage and escaped into males cage.","Hi everyone,
I could really use some advice and insight on a situation that just happened.

I recently brought home a pair of young female rats, about 7–8 weeks old (I've had them for two days), and I also have a pair of older males, around 6–7 months. The boys and girls are housed on opposite sides of my room with no interaction, as I’m waiting to get the boys neutered before attempting any intros or bonding.

Last night while watching TV in the dark, I suddenly heard one of my males, Lou, squeaking and running around like crazy. I panicked, thinking he might be having a seizure or something. When I turned on the light, I was shocked to see not one, but two white bodies in his cage — Cream, one of the girls, had somehow chewed through the bars and made her way into Lou’s side.

Currently, Lou and his brother Marley are separated when I’m not around, as Lou has quite nasty hormonal aggression. He’s caused some bad injuries in the past — even to me — and I was terrified he might’ve hurt Cream. Luckily, after getting him out and checking her over, she had no visible injuries. Lou, however, seemed really shaken and kept seeking my attention.

I’ve now zip-tied plastic lids over the hole she chewed through, which is the best temporary fix I could come up with until I can afford a new cage (hopefully in about a month).

My questions are:

Why would such a young female try to get into the males' cage?
What's the most secure way to cover or repair the hole temporarily?
Any tips for managing young female behavior? This is my first time owning girls.
All four rats will eventually be bonded once the boys are neutered, but for now, I’m just trying to keep everyone safe. I never even saw her leave the girls’ cage — it happened so fast and quietly. Any help or experience would be hugely appreciated!

Thanks in advance!

(The two adorable monsters are in the first and second pics. 1 being cream and 2 being Lou, plus their cages mates Marley as 3 and coffee as 4)

The camera hovered above a dazzling metropolis, its silver towers slicing the morning mist like spears of ambition. Skies were alive with drones and autonomous craft flitting between designated paths, obeying a strict ballet of algorithmic control. Streets below bustled with people, many not walking but gliding on micro-platforms or exo-assisted frames. The camera tilted downward and began to zoom into a single vehicle—a sleek, dark blue cruiser with glowing trim, whispering silently down one of the mid-level flyways.

Inside the vehicle, Jack Rainer sipped recycled coffee from a biodegradable cup, eyes glazed as his mind reviewed the day's agenda. He wasn't driving—no one really did anymore. Personal control of vehicles had been outlawed a decade ago after the last manual crash sparked a city-wide transit audit. Now, every movement was curated by a central AI transit authority known simply as *Grid*. Jack liked the name. It made the world feel safe and predictable.

His morning routine was interrupted by a ping in his earpiece—three quick pulses. A call.

“Tom,” he muttered, accepting.

“Jack!” Tom’s voice exploded through the headset like a trumpet blast. “We got a game going on today at noon. Be there.”

Jack chuckled, adjusting the seat to lean slightly back. “Tom, you know I’m working today.”

“Jack, just listen.” Tom's voice dropped to a conspiratorial tone. “If we win today, you’ll get ten times your work credits.”

Jack blinked. “What? A whole kingdom?”

“Yep. If we take the core vault, it pays out in empire units. We split it based on buy-in. You’re sitting on twenty-five percent. If I get Rusty to join, it’ll drop a bit, though. Fair warning.”

Jack laughed. “And then I can finally pay you back for that patch of farmland you sold me last year.”

Tom didn’t miss a beat. “Hey, that farmland was legit.”

“That farmland was a dump, Tom. Literally a dump site. You sold me an old reclaim station buried in compost.”

“Urban farm potential!” Tom shot back. “OK, Jack. Good luck on the move-up.”

He hung up.

The vehicle hummed softly as it veered toward Sector 8’s SkyHub Tower, where Jack’s workplace—a data services firm called NovaFold—occupied the 97th to 101st floors. But Jack didn’t even glance up as they approached. His thoughts were already elsewhere.

*Ten times the credits.*  
In today’s economy, credits weren’t just currency—they were class. A person’s access to housing, healthcare, even network bandwidth depended on their earned or acquired credit stack. Owning a “kingdom,” as Tom put it, wasn’t just hyperbole—it meant you could buy naming rights for a block of the city, sponsor new urban development, or, if you were frugal, live for fifty years without ever working again.

Jack gave a quiet command: “Grid, redirect. Prep game loadout. Route to Zone Delta.”

“Confirmed,” came the polite AI reply. “Redirecting to *Gravemind Arena*. Estimated arrival: 11:47 a.m.”

Jack pulled up a translucent interface from his seat console, fingers dancing over the icons. The *game* was technically a simulation—fully legal, sanctioned by the Government of Collaborative Labor as an “aggressive creative outlet.” Thousands played daily, ranging from unemployed youth to corporate strategists. In the simulation, groups competed in high-stakes challenges that mimicked ancient feudal warfare, but with futuristic rules: digital battlegrounds, terrain morphing, zero-death scenarios. Lose, and your virtual assets were wiped. Win, and the system rewarded you with real-world credit multipliers.

He wasn’t just a low-level analyst anymore. Jack was a captain in one of the better-known guilds—The Copper Sons. And this raid? It wasn’t just any game.

It was a move-up.

Each month, top-tier guilds could compete in sanctioned ""ascension"" matches—multi-hour campaigns that pulled strategic and tactical data from all previous matches and evolved dynamically. Winning one didn’t just mean credit. It meant recognition. Sponsorship. A seat at the table.

The vehicle descended like a hawk gliding into position, softly touching down on a floating pad near Gravemind Arena, a black polygonal dome with streaming light panels pulsing across its skin. Jack stepped out, fully dressed in what appeared to be civilian clothes but were embedded with haptic threads and neural sync points. Inside, he’d become someone else.

The entry scan passed in seconds. Jack walked through the staging hall to the Copper Sons' chamber. Tom was already there, hunched over a display table, fingers sliding miniature representations of territory lines and control nodes.

“Rusty’s in,” Tom said. “That puts you at 19 percent.”

“Fine,” Jack replied, accepting a neural sync helmet from the gear wall. “But I want front line. No backdoor stuff. Let me earn the killpoints.”

Tom smirked. “Wouldn’t dream of it.”

The simulation initialized in a blink.

They were dropped into a desert biome, the sun overhead brutal and red. The enemy, *Guild Twelve*, controlled three fortress towers, each shielded by kinetic domes. The vault sat buried beneath a central pyramid—the kind used in old-world burial rites but now pulsing with nanofiber vines and turrets.

Jack’s squad hit fast. They sliced across the left flank with magnetized hover sleds, scattering drone swarms with EMP bursts. The battle was pure chaos: traps folding terrain, gravity reversals, momentum nullification. Through it all, Jack held the spear—literally a seven-foot energy spike—and drove it into the heart of the enemy's second-in-command during a narrow breach.

With each kill, credits tallied silently. With each capture, their ""empire value"" rose.

And then came the vault.

A final stand.

Turrets fell. Support lines collapsed. Jack found himself inside the vault's outer shell, oxygen down to 10% simulated, limbs dragging from neural lag. Rusty covered him, launching a viral worm into the last firewall node. And then—entry.

Jack dropped to one knee inside the throne chamber. A floating glyph asked him one question:

**""Who do you crown?""**

“Jack Rainer,” he said, voice barely audible.

**Crown confirmed. Empire Units issued: x10. Distribution by stake. Adjusted balance: 19%.**

The screen blinked. Game over.

When he awoke back in the real world, the arena's chamber felt impossibly still. He sat up, chest rising and falling in time with the flickering light from the dome’s center core. Tom was already checking his balance on the display wall.

“You’re a rich man, Jack,” Tom said.

“I don’t feel rich,” Jack replied, pulling off the sync helmet.

“Then you’re doing it wrong.”

They both laughed.

Outside, the sun had lowered. Jack returned to his vehicle, watching the sky begin its slow turn toward twilight. Grid had already plotted a route home, but Jack hesitated.

“Grid,” he said. “Pause route.”

“Command acknowledged.”

He looked out across the city. Somewhere out there, he now owned a piece of the future. Maybe even the resources to rebuild that old patch of land Tom had dumped on him. Maybe he’d turn it into a true farm this time—vertical fields, solar racks, a few chickens if licensing allowed.

The vehicle lifted into the air again.

The camera followed, pulling back now, up and out from the cabin, past the dome of the Gravemind Arena, past the hover routes and transit corridors, past the lights of the ever-moving city. As Jack’s cruiser moved off into the great electric dusk, the skyline burned gold.

The game was over.

The kingdom was his.

I write to you today not as a concerned citizen, but as a broken one—both spiritually and emotionally. I used to live in a modest home near Vinewood Hills, where the most excitement I expected was a distant police siren or a mild earthquake. But that was before GTA Online turned this city into a lawless sandbox from hell.

Let me walk you through a typical Tuesday:
	
•	6:45 AM: I wake up to the sound of explosions. Not fireworks. Not construction. But someone’s Oppressor Mk II “accidentally” nuking a Prius three blocks down. The driver then proceeds to spin donuts in midair and shoot a homing missile at my mailbox. It’s the third one this week.
	
•	7:00 AM: I attempt to make coffee. Just as the kettle whistles, a tank rolls through my backyard. A tank. Not military, mind you—just some guy named “xX_N0Sc0p3B0ss_Xx” livestreaming his chaos spree.
	
•	7:10 AM: I leave for work. I don’t make it far. I’m carjacked at a red light by a shirtless man in pink shorts and a monkey mask. He apologizes, then immediately blows himself and my sedan up with a sticky bomb. Insurance has stopped taking my calls.
	
•	7:15 AM: I respawn in an alley behind a taco shop and get sniped before I can say “Passive Mode.” My ghost now haunts Vespucci Beach.

Meanwhile, the police? They exist only to lightly jog after criminals or accidentally run over pedestrians while yelling, “Stop right there!” One officer used my garden gnome for target practice.

And don’t get me started on the noise. Every 30 seconds, a twin-turbo lowrider blasts past my window playing bass so loud it resets my Wi-Fi router.

Even my cat has given up. She lives under the fridge now and only emerges when the server crashes.

So I beg you: please shut down GTA Online. Or, at the very least, restrict the weaponized vehicles, airstrikes, and people dressed as aliens with miniguns. Or move the entire operation to Cayo Perico. Or North Yankton. Or a volcano.

Yours in eternal respawn limbo,

And all we do as Humans and plants and bacteria here is just slowing down the Entropy for some determined future of our reality: Heat Death. Slowing it down and riding the wave of entropy, borrowing some energy from the Sun to manipulate it a bit and turn into a cup of coffee or a girlfriend. To enjoy life a bit. So all we get literally comes from the Sun and we are all its creations. Creating dramaturgical potential, our personal one, for some of the general steps of reality. In a given location of space-time.

https://preview.redd.it/i0j64kngd20f1.png?width=1752&format=png&auto=webp&s=eab1fbed9d1124c3c5d327b485c9535c280e739c

It's common knowledge that the sun showers Earth with an immense amount of energy, from the visible light we see to various forms of electromagnetic radiation. Our atmosphere and surface absorb a significant portion of this energy, driving processes like photosynthesis, weather patterns, and the overall vitality of our planet.

But here's where it gets interesting: Sun produces all energy and matter we are using and consist of. We are maximum united with it. In our modern world we created so many games we forgot about the main cause of all of them, the Sun. Sun has a story, and it transmits its story forward in time. Because of fundamental law of Entropy. And our life stories and all our problems and accomplishments are always only a substories of the main one: the Sun. It has all answers.

https://preview.redd.it/py8qj27ld20f1.png?width=1060&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4d1009045e331b515e91d0d274cc3ead0e8096e

 Entropy, a concept deeply rooted in the second law of thermodynamics, suggests that systems tend to move towards in a state of disorder or randomness. In the case of Earth and the sun's energy, this law implies that the absorbed energy isn't indefinitely stored or utilized within our planet.

So, how does the Earth loose energy? One major mechanism is through the reradiation of energy back into space. The Earth, being warmer than the frigid vacuum of space, emits infrared radiation. This outbound radiation carries away a substantial portion of the absorbed solar energy, maintaining a balance. 

https://preview.redd.it/6oo60qrmd20f1.png?width=2036&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfc911730b5e9e80b48fdddc97fc19467794a084

Ultimately, a fraction of the sun's energy doesn't just bounce back into space directly from Earth's surface. Some of it is utilized in driving various Earthly processes, but a significant portion finds its way back into the cosmic void.

Plants are remarkable organisms practice a form of alchemy known as photosynthesis, where they harness the sun's energy, combining it with water and carbon dioxide to create a magical elixir – glucose. 

https://preview.redd.it/6sjkfqjod20f1.png?width=754&format=png&auto=webp&s=11ceafec17d2ecb01a66cc963420af4cd525cbd6

Contrary to popular belief, plants are selective about their recipe for glucose. While they do extract some minerals from the soil, the primary ingredients are **sunlight** and water. Through the miraculous process of photosynthesis, plants convert solar energy into chemical energy stored in glucose, essentially creating their own form of solar batteries.

  The structures of plants, from leaves to stems, act as reservoirs for this stored solar energy. Think of them as living batteries, charged by the sun. This energy-rich compound, glucose, becomes the currency that powers various cellular processes within the plant.

Here's where it gets fascinating. When we burn wood or other plant material, we're essentially releasing the stored solar energy in the form of heat and light.

https://preview.redd.it/te7zpt8qd20f1.png?width=920&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d8270ea29bc1dfa25969ed705bb9fcbb2e1888

This process, although ancient, is a tangible manifestation of the sun's energy returning to the environment. It's a beautiful reminder that the energy we use for warmth and light has ancient origins.

   Beyond direct combustion, the journey of solar energy extends to more complex forms. Plants, over millions of years, transform into fossil fuels like coal and oil. These fuels, when burned, release the stored sunlight in a manner that sustained Earth's ecosystems long before humans arrived on the scene.

https://preview.redd.it/khdekl5sd20f1.png?width=1848&format=png&auto=webp&s=efa4c24fd3c4d472a9123736497745e7861367f4

So if we look at all of this through process philosophy, and especially computational dramaturgy, you can say “Sun plays stories of our lives”. Because it gives energy that is washed away in time, but we surf it on a surfboard of a free will. Creating an illusion of consciousness and a free choice. Remaining the part of a fully computational world.

   If you are a fed up with life clerk or a big Boss that punishes his enemies, remember, you still only have time and energy for that because you are literally fed and created by the sun. Visible light from the Sun shapes your desires and its energy made your hot bathtub hot.

  This kind world perception, when you are not a main character is very healthy and saves a lot of money used for drugs from anxiety. Relax, you are not important. Enjoy life.

1kjqgid,https://www.reddit.com/r/plural/comments/1kjqgid/how_a_lack_of_sleep_affects_us_as_a_system/,How a lack of sleep affects us as a system,"As most probably know, a lack of sleep significantly impacts your mental health, regardless if you are a system or not. It can increasing the risk of mood disorders, anxiety, and depression, and potentially exacerbating existing mental health conditions. Sleep deprivation can also impair cognitive functions like decision-making, judgment, and problem-solving, further affecting emotional regulation and well-being.

That being said, we simply wanted to talk how a lack of bodily sleep affects us as a system..

Knowing that a lack of sleep can worsen symptoms you may already have/experience, we noticed that for us, on the nights where we get little to no sleep, we experience a lot of things by tenfolds. We dissociate more, communication between headmates becomes harder to accomplish, we tend to have such a harder time telling if we're switching or not (hard to tell who we even are atm) and even leads to a lot of emotional regulation issues, causing a lot of our other mental health issues to also get worse. It makes our depression get worsen. Episodes of derealization or depersonalization become more frequent. We are constantly on the verge of an anxiety attack by the littlest thing, and in general just makes us constantly unstable emotionally.
Three hours ago we isolated ourselves and cried ourself to sleep for a nap, even though we rested for a bit, everything is still cranked up to an 8 emotionally/mentally.

As for a solution for this, we found that practicing proper sleep habits helps everyone within the system, and we recommend that even as a system, you practise healthy sleep habits.
(Do as we say not as we do)
Here's a few things we sometimes do that helps us get a goodnight's rest.

Set A Shared Sleep Routine.
Agree as a system (as much as possible) on consistent sleep/wake times. Even if headmates have different preferences, aim for a compromise that supports the body's needs.

Carefully Choose Sleep-Fronting Headmates.
Some systems designate specific headmates to front near bedtime—those who are calm, grounded, or good at helping the body rest. If you don't have a dedicated headmate, ask your fellow headmates who would be willing and comfortable with sharing the bed/body with you during bedtime that you know takes rest seriously. Rotate roles if needed, or assign ""rest guardians"" who make sure others aren't keeping the body awake. Don't be like me where I invited a headmate who lives off coffee to sleep in the body, because SHOCKINGLY sleeping does not get done. Pick your headmates wisely.

Practise Internal Quiet Time.
It's basically like meditation. Set a designated quiet or low-activity period before sleep (30–60 minutes) and use grounding techniques, light inner world visualization, or calming internal conversation to reduce system-wide activity. 
Encourage all fronting or nearby headmates to focus on body sensations: deep breaths, muscle relaxation, or heartbeat awareness.
Grounding helps anchor the system in the present and prepares the body for sleep.

Journaling Before Bed.
Write down thoughts, switches, emotions, or tasks from different headmates. This helps offload mental clutter and reduce anxiety-driven insomnia.

Make Agreements on Late-Night Switching.
If switching at night is common, agree on ""quiet hours"" or ""no-switch unless necessary"" rules, unless a headmate is taking over to help the body rest. This is something we are currently still working on as a system because MULTIPLE SOMEONES think it's okay to do whatever they want regardless of time..

External Aids.
We find that external aids are the most important for us, mainly because it signals to everyone that it's time for rest. Weighted blankets, calming music, white noise, or specific scents (lavender, for example) may help soothe multiple headmates at once. If there is a specific activity that you as a collective or the frequent fronter like to do to unwind, this would be the time to do it.
For us, we tend to do word searches before bed some nights, and have been considering doing it more often as of late as we notice it helps us relax a lot more than rewatching a youtube video.

We have no idea how to end this but I guess... What are some struggles do you deal with as a system when you lack sleep? What are some things you do to help with sleep as a system? We're curious in knowing how others tackle this problem too.

The battlefield was silent, no motion to be seen. A guardsman sat motionless, watching his very lifeblood leave his body. It was cold, and he was frightened; more frightened than he had been when the countless number of the enemies of the Emperor flooded from the hills. The guardsman feared the end.

His weapon had claimed forty upon forty enemies before they had wounded him; he had thought the emperor was with him as he fought to defend this world. Now among the piles of the dead, he was the last to draw breath. He knew that he would join the others; what lay beyond death was uncertain, and the uncertainty frightened him.

And then he saw her.

Striding elegantly among the dead, a lady wrapped in a red robe made her way across the battlefield. The gray, gloomy sky seemed to part for her, surrounding her with light. She inspected each of the fallen carefully before she knelt down to touch those who had fought for the Emperor. Closer and closer she ventured to guardsman.

""Oh, Stranger,"" the guardsman spoke, ""You must help me.""

The woman glanced towards him, her face radiant. As she approached, the guardsman felt warmth flowing through his body. The stranger knelt beside the guardsman, and draped her cloak around his body.

The stranger did not speak, she only smiled. Her face was the most beautiful the guardsman had ever seen. A hand as pure and flawless as the lady's face entwined itself with his, becoming stained red with his blood.

""Oh, stranger,"" the guardsman spoke, ""Please speak to me.""

""What words would you have me give?"" the lady answered, in a voice as gentle as a hymn.

""Words of comfort, dear stranger - words of comfort. I have failed the Emperor.""

""And how have you failed the Emperor, dear soldier?""

""I fear I will die, dear stranger. I fear I will die.""

The stranger laughed, ""Oh, dear soldier. You have not failed the Emperor. You have given your life protecting him, a noble gesture - but you have also given your life defending his children; the noblest of gestures. Your time protecting the Emperor is over - soon it will be time for the Emperor to protect you.""

The guardsman stirred, sitting upright and leaning into the shoulder of the lady, and he began to weep.

""Oh, stranger, I am not ready to meet the Emperor.""

The lady drew the guardsman close, embracing him as he wept.

""All fear the time when it comes; the end is a mystery. Oh, soldier, I will tell you not to be afraid of what lay ahead for you. I have seen beyond, and I know that it is your time.""

""Oh, stranger, give me your name. If you are who I believe you are, your words will bring comfort.""

""Death, dear soldier. I am known to you as Death.""

The guardsman felt her pure, soft hand wipe away the tears staining his cheek and draw him closer to her breast.

""Lady death, tell me of the Emperor before I meet him.""

""I cannot, dear soldier. I cannot. The Emperor knows you and soon you will know him. The Emperor knows all of his children, but not all of his children know the Emperor the same. I cannot tell you how you will know the Emperor - but I can tell you not to fear him; he will accept you into the afterlife he has prepared for you.""

The lady lay the Guardsman on his back, and crossed his arms about him. The blood slowed.

""Lady Death, lady Death - please do not leave me to face the Emperor alone."" the Guardsman spoke weakly.

""Dear soldier, I will never leave you. I will never leave you.""

It seems the strip has only whitened the lower half of my teeth in a perfectly straight line, I put the strip over the whole of my teeth, I made sure of this because near my gums were the yellowest parts and I wanted them whitening. I don’t think I used the strip wrong as I followed the directions to a T as I’m very anxious when it comes to my teeth.

My teeth aren’t too bad, I don’t smoke or drink coffee/tea, the only staining thing I consume is blackcurrant juice. I brush regularly and when I use abrasive toothpastes my teeth seem to get more yellow if that’s even possible. I have reflux so I’m aware that’s wearing down my enamel, is that why they’re yellow? Why has it whitened in this pattern? And why is it patchy? Is there a way I can get it fixed without getting them professionally whitened? 

Sorry for the photo quality, I can’t get it any clearer, but you can see the line going across the middle of all my teeth on both the top and the bottom. (The shiny things are tooth gems) any advice would be helpful!!",2,1746928856.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

I really enjoy the brewing aspect of Coffee Talk, but it’s pretty story-heavy and I’d like something that doesn’t require as much attention. I’ve also been playing Potion Craft but something about it just doesn’t hit where I want it to. I think it’s because the process for making potions is more complicated than the brewing system in Coffee Talk.

I’ve also really been enjoying Storyteller, especially with how simple and easy it is to just jump right in with the gameplay.

I would prefer if the games were compatible with controller, but I’ll take any recommendations! (even if they don’t fully match what I’m looking for lol)",9,1746928798.0,CozyGamers,8,1.0,False

1kjq1oj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kjq1oj,One of my girls escaped and got into my boys cage???,"So I recently got a pair of females, there about 7-8 weeks old I’d say, I’ve only had them two days, and I also have a pair of males about 6-7 months old they are separated on opposite sides of my room and have no interaction as I’m waiting on the boys to get done. I was watching a show and heard my male rat Lou running like crazy making terrified squeaks I try and see what’s happening and I’m thinking why is he running around like that panic thinking maybe he’s seizing or something but then I see two white body’s in the cage, currently both my boys are separated when I’m going to bed or not in the house as Lou does have quite nasty hormonal aggression, I get up turn the light on and find out one of my girls, cream had chewed through the bars and found her way into his half of the cage with no evidence of how exactly she got into the boys cage I have no idea how this happens I assume of how small she is she figured somthing out, with taking Lou out the cage and placing him in my bed for now until I was able to remove cream from his cage, he was quite scared and kept trying to keep my attention, finally getting her out, I was thinking maybe there would be a few cuts or stuff like that as Lou is tend to be quite aggressive to his brother Marley, who I first assumed it was in the cage with him. Now they are back in their own cages, he keeps softly squeaking in the direction of the girls cage, I’ve had to place two plastic lids zip tied over the hole, this was the only thing I had which I thought she wouldn’t eat thru any she currently hasn’t, I’m unable to buy a new cage for the girls until least a month away. Do any of you have ideas why she would have gotten into the boys cage in the first place? Or how I can try and keep the hole covered as best as I can as this is the first time I’ve had female babies, and I have no idea what’s the best thing to now do, I separated them as soon as I noticed and I don’t know how long she had been in there for I hadn’t even noticed her leave her cage as I was sat in the dark. I had checked over cream after getting her out the cage and couldn’t see any marks to cuts on her, as I was terrified he’d hurt her pretty badly as he is known to fight nasty, he has taken some pretty nasty bites out on me in a grump cuz I said no, as well as causing quite a few scars and scratch marks n cuts on his brother too including ripping some fur out hence they are now separated when I’m not here to supervise and they do get a few hours together every day and it’s cut down depending on how long until they start fighting sometimes it’s even 10 minutes before they get separated again, this is just until I have the money to get them both done as I do plan on bonding both my girls and boys together once the boys have been neutered

   I woke to the sound of a racoon chirping and the rustling of leaves in the summer breeze. My ears were ringing and my head pounded. The cold damp earth below me was beginning to seep into my clothing. I stretched out my left arm in desperation as the last thing I could recall was Jenn laying distraught on the ground before I collapsed. I prodded my hand against the ground until I found her foot. Latching onto it, my instinct was to hold tight as I let out a sigh. I called quietly to her, “Jenn?” Then I let go and shot up with the full recollection of all that had happened. My head continued to pound without any indication of slowing down. My eyes locked onto her unconscious body. I crawled over to her, placed my right hand on her left shoulder, and began to shake her. I did so carefully, but hard enough to wake her. “Jenn I need you to get up now,” I repeated three times as I shook her. I looked around at the moonlit surroundings to find that all of the trash that once littered the area had been completely removed. Jenn began to shift and stir. She let out an exacerbated moan as she pulled up her right hand to her head. With her left hand she reached out and gripped the wrist of my right hand. Once more she let out an exhausted and beaten moan. ”Jon,” she asked? I shifted my left hand to rub her head. “I’m here sweetheart,” I said. Jennifer began to rise slowly. She opened her eyes and looked at me, then to her surroundings. “We need to go Jenn,” I said with urgency. She nodded her head in agreement. I stood, reached out my hand, and pulled Jennifer up to her feet. We both walked with haste through the mud, trees, rows of corn, hay field, and grass back to the house. Every sound in nature had us snapping our heads to look in defense. I gripped her hand tightly the whole way. 

   I let Jenn slip in the back door first, quickly following her in and locking the door behind me. “Go change,” I commanded Jenn. I grabbed my gun and holster off of the kitchen island before following her upstairs through the darkness of the house. My heart raced and my mind continued to swell. At the top of the stairs light pierced through the windows of the house before giving way to an extraordinary boom. Thunder rolled over and shook the house. A few more streaks of light painted the windows before I entered the bedroom. Jenn was hastily putting on a pair of blue jeans as I shuffled over to the dresser so I could grab my black jeans. I threw on a basic black t-shirt and threw Jenn a green floral top. I walked into the wardrobe to grab my black trench coat and her white rain jacket. Jenn, fully spooked, was struggling to dress herself as she continued to panic more. I moved over to her and placed her jacket on the bed. Once again I placed my hand on her shoulder. Jenn jumped at my touch before realizing it was just me.

	“What did we just see,” Jenn asked?

	“I wish I could answer that question.” 

	“What do we even do right now,” Jenn questioned. “Who do we call or turn to?”

	I moved my hand to her back and answered, “I hate to say this but I don’t think the Police are a good idea.”

“Why not Jon?”

“What are they going to say when I tell them an alien that can speak telepathically that has some sort of nano technology was in our backyard?”

I continued, “I think the only other option here is to go to Sawyer since he was there on Friday.”

Jenn looked up at me with confusion, “What do you mean he was there on Friday?”

“That pain we felt when we woke up from our dreams and as we got closer to that creature,” I explained, “I felt the same pain shortly after that meteor struck the park.”

“You did?”

“I didn’t think much of it at the time. I thought it was just tinnitus or something until we woke up earlier.”

“You mean the pain in our heads?”

“Yes,” I said. “Regardless, we all saw that strange fluorescent liquid in the crater.”

   Jenn, now fully dressed, stared up at me with terrified eyes. I grabbed her jacket once again and handed it to her. I released my trench coat from the death grip of my arm and threw it on. The rain of the storm was now tattering the windows heavily. Streaks of lightning continued to brighten the room. Jenn held my hand tightly and I gently lifted her from the edge of the bed. “Let’s go sweetheart,” I said calmly. 

   The two of us exited the bedroom and headed downstairs. As we passed through the kitchen I turned to look out the back door as if I thought I would see him once again. Nothing but the pouring rain and flashing blue of lightning appeared in the clear window. Jenn opened the door to the garage and moved through with haste. I followed quickly behind her, making sure to grab the keys hanging on the wall by the door. Jennifer was in the car before I even got into the garage. As I stepped through the door I smacked the door switch and then rushed to the driver side of the car. The rain rushed in through the door as it reeled open. I was briefly pelted by water. The floor quickly began to pool with water. Just as quickly I reversed out into the pouring of rain and darkness of night. I looked at the console of the Escape to scan what information was there. It had not occurred to me to look for how much time had passed. The rush of adrenaline and confusion pushed me forward to find answers. “2:41am,” the clock read. ‘It’s nearly been 2 hours,’ I thought to myself. Jenn and I sat in complete silence through the rushing rain and booming lightning. The full 6 minute drive was spent in quiet contemplation of the recent events. The burst of rain began to let up as we pulled into Sawyer’s driveway. As I parked I noticed Logan’s car in the drive as well. No surprise there. The two of us exited the vehicle and headed for the door to the main house. Despite the fact that the rain was slowing down my hair still became soaked as soon as I exited the car. 

   As we made the short walk to the door Logan came outside seemingly on que. “Heeeeeeeey,” he said with a big smile, “I didn’t know you guys were coming over.” Logan chucked his empty beer bottle into the recycling bin as he wrapped his other arm around my shoulder. Jenn broke her grip from me as Logan lodged his way in between us. His cheerful, and clearly drunk, nature was enough to bring a smile to my face regardless of the duress I was under. Logan quickly dragged us inside where we were just as quickly met by Sawyer and Lukas. Not like I expected any different. They both were in their usual spots surrounding the kitchen island. 

“Jon?” Sawyer asked as soon as he saw me. He had that quiet look of pleasure to see me but was clearly confused at mine and Jennifer’s sudden appearance.

“We need to talk.”

Lukas shifted his body towards me. “You good Jon?”  

   I looked at him and then to Sawyer to continue: “No. I’m certainly not good.” The weight in the room dampened as I said this. Logan walked over to the couch and flopped onto it. There was a pause between all five of us. My eyes darted around and repeatedly squinted as my thoughts consumed me.

“So what's up?” Sawyer asked me.

“An alien.”

“Dude shut the hell up.”

“Sawyer I’m not speaking out my ass man.”

“What is bro on about?” Luke laughed to himself and shifted back to Sawyer. 

“I mean it quite literally,” I said. “Jenn and I walked out to the old junk pile in the forest. There was a creature there and it attacked us.”

Jenn got closer to the island and spoke up for herself. “It was there. It wasn’t just a creature either. It spoke to us and antagonized us. Like it was toying with us.” 

“So you’re telling me you saw an alien,” Sawyer laughed but only for a moment. Lukas once again shifted to me with the most confused look on his face. Sawyer stood with his mouth half opened.

I continued: “Jenn isn’t lying. It spoke to both of us. The only reason we went looking was because it woke us up from our dreams.”

“Nah dude.” Luke interjected.

“The thing looked like it was 8 or 9 feet tall,” I explained. “Skin as red as blood. Two wings, both as long as myself. A head like a dinosaur. Spikes all over its body. Some sort of barbs at the end of its tail.”

   Sawyer, Lukas, and even Logan were staring at me in complete disbelief. None of them knew how to react to what I was saying. They were waiting for the punchline but only I knew one wasn’t coming.

“Sawyer, you know what happened a few nights ago. The meteor that hit the park. The glowing liquid in the crater. Sure the meteor could just happen but we all jut choose to ignore that liquid.”

“So what the hell are you doing here then? Why haven’t you gone to a police station or something?”

“Yeah. Sure. Dial 911, ‘hello operator I was just attacked by an alien.’ That’s going to go over so well.”

“Okay point taken but what then?”

“I don’t know dude,” I questioned. “I guess my only thought was to find everyone that was there at the park. I don’t know.” 

Jenn backed away from the center of the room to come closer to me. She grabbed my right bicep and turned to look at Sawyer. “I seriously cannot deal with this right now. Sawyer, I need a drink. An Alcoholic one.”

“Uh yeah,” Sawyer replied after first looking at me. “You know where it's all at, Jenn.”

“Jenn, you need to come back right away,” I declared. 

   Jenn slowly let go of me. She resisted doing so but began to back away from me. Keeping her eyes locked on me, Jenn inched backwards towards the door behind us. I could tell she was looking at me as she moved. I turned away from the guys to look back at her. She was terrified. Despite the look on her face she was able to force out a smile as she made eye contact with me. I fully turned myself and took two steps over to her. I grabbed the edges of her shoulders and kissed her on the forehead. I let go of her but Jenn held onto me for a moment longer before letting go. She turned around and walked the short distance to the door. Jennifer turned back to look at me once more. I smiled the warmest smile I could conjure and then she opened the door and stepped outside. 



   Jenn regretted leaving the house without us as soon as she closed that door. The cool mist of rain hit her and she began walking to the guest house. As she looked up to find the door of the guest house the asphalt, brick, and grass all seemed to stretch a mile away. Jennifer’s chest tightened as her chest pounded harder. Her heart was going to explode out of her body at this rate. Jenn focused on the door and began to walk forward. Surely the stretch between grass and path became shorter as she moved on. With only a dozen steps she was placing her hand on the handle. A gust of the summer air hit her as she did. The mixed scent of new plant life and the gentle rain filled her and allowed her to relax briefly. As she opened the door a bee zipped out past her face. She nearly fell over and the anxiety returned with it. “I’ve had enough of this shit,” she whispered. 

   The air in the guest house was cool, as always. Brett never turned the temperature down. Not even in the winter. The air conditioner was bellowing as it shot out cold air. Jenn looked around the room like she’d never seen it before. She saw Brett sleeping on the couch. He was stiff like a board and completely unphased by her opening the door. Jenn moved forward and past the couch so she could reach the bar behind it. Stepping behind the bar she knelt down to the glass door of the mini fridge. The usual mess of snacks and candies were strewn about the underside of the bar. She opened the door and an even colder plume of air rushed out. Jenn rummaged through the cans and bottles within before grabbing the bottle of Blue Raspberry Vodka. As Jenn pulled the bottle out she sighed. Jenn stood and snagged a chocolate bar and glass on her way up. “It's ok Jenn, just breathe,” she said aloud. She closed the door of the fridge and looked at herself in the reflection of the glass in her hand. The room in the reflection was filled with an uncharacteristic, blinding, white light. Suddenly her head tightened as she felt a sting of sharp pain and once again her vision went red for a moment. She turned around with a snap, fear in her heart, and the items still firmly gripped in her hands. 



   Logan was now up from the couch again. He stumbled over to the kitchen and sat down at the island. I too walked over and took a seat, keeping eye contact with Sawyer. The four of us looked at each other with both disbelief and astonishment. I for one was still processing everything I had seen in the last few hours. 

Sawyer spoke up asking, “Can you describe it more?”

“Well like I said, it was somewhere near nine feet tall. Honestly it looked like a human and a dinosaur had a baby mixed with few other things. The skin was blood red but looked tough and leathery. It had scales but they didn’t completely cover the body. I was standing upright like a human anyway. Two legs, two arms, hands, and feet. Thing was built like Chris Hemsworth in his Thor costume. The wings on its back must have been five feet at the least and pure white. Pure white except for the right wing which seemed to have a pretty serious burn right in the middle. The face was like a Spinosaurus or a Velociraptor? A mix of the two really. Long tail with barbs that seemed to be flexing or something. Honestly it seemed like he was doing a lot of stretching.”

“Man why you thinkin bout Thor like that,” Logan asked through his drunk thoughts. Logan opened his mouth ready to speak more.

Sawyer cut him off, “Why did you just call it a he?”

“It kept speaking to me,” I replied. “Or well it kept speaking to us I should say.”

“How,” Lukas asked plainly.

“Well at first it was just garbled noise that sounded vaguely like speech. But when we were face to face it spoke to us. Not with its mouth, but in our minds. And well the voice seemed masculine.”

“So what was HE saying then,” Lukas inquired.

“Well,” I choked out. “He was antagonizing me. He kept calling me Johnny the same way my Grandfather always does.”

Logan's jaw dropped and he said, “dude he can read minds? That’s pretty sick, I can't lie, man.”

“Logan shut up.”

“He kind of has a point though,” Sawyer shifted to look at Logan. “I mean if that’s really what he was doing then why else would he do that?”

“Fair point,” I said. “I don’t know guys.”

Luke put his hands on Sawyer and Logan’s shoulders before asking, “So what’s our plan then?”

Looking at Lukas I replied, “I guess we need to go find the others?”

“Well then thank God most of us are right here,” Luke said.

“We only need to find Sia, Cass, and Sam,” Sawyer exclaimed. 

I pulled out my phone, “We better get started then.”



   When Jennifer’s eyes adjusted she saw a blue hallway with beige and white stripes running down the walls on either side. Pure white tiles paved the floors and reflected the blinding light of the fluorescent bulbs into her eyes. Doors of solid oak wood with hook handles and room numbers stretched the hall. The bottle of Vodka slipped from her grip and slammed to the floor. The thick plastic bottle bounced three times before falling flat and rolling away from her. She stepped back and reached both hands out to grip the counter of the bar. Instead there was nothing there. She fell over onto her back, slamming her head to the tile below. As she stood up the double doors on her right burst open. The doors slammed into the stoppers on the wall hard enough that Jenn could feel the vibration through the floor. Jenn quickly lifted herself up, crawled backwards frantically, and pressed her back up against the wall. Four Doctors pushed a hospital bed through with haste. All four were in full dress with face masks and shields on. The patient on the bed was wailing in extreme pain. Sores covered the man’s face and neck. He was holding a vomit bag but it looked as though he had already vomited on himself a few times. Clearly it was of no use. The wheels of the bed rattled and skated over the smooth tile which created quite the racket. Four more doctors followed suit, filling the hall with noise and talk. The noise became hazy as Jenn began to panic. The Doctor at the front left side of the bed moved ahead of the group. “What are you doing there,” he yelled at Jenn. “Get out of the way lady!” Jenn shot up and pressed her whole body against the wall. All eight Doctors glared at her as they rushed by. Her chest tightened, her heart raced, and her breathing was on the verge of hyperventilation. A Nurse came walking down the hallway from the direction the Doctors were going.

“Miss, do you need help with something?” 

“Uuh n-no thank you,” Jenn forced out. “I-I’m fine.” 

The woman’s voice became insidiously deep and she said, “okay Dear.” 

   As she said this, the lady's eyes became lizard-like and yellow. Jenn felt her head strain suddenly and her vision became red again. Jenn turned and started rushing to the end of the hall where the man on the hospital bed came through. Her mind set on the double doors with a laser focus. She rushed for them in hopes of getting out. The magnets on the doors released and they slowly shut themselves. Jenn began a mild sprint to them fearing she would not be able to get through. A man stepped out of a room on her right and she crashed into him. Both were sent backwards in the collision and the man spilled his coffee on himself. Jenn once again whacked her head on the tile. Both the man and Jenn propped themselves up.

“Aw jeez thanks a lot asshole,” he scolded. “What kind of Goddamn rush are you in?”

“I-I’m so sorry,” Jenn struggled to say as she got up. “I don’t k-know what’s going on a-and…”

The man also stood and he cut her off, “No! No! I don't want your stupid apology lady!”

Jenn saw the door at the end of the hallway. It was stretching away from her. The hall was getting longer. “I uh I…”

“Nothing to say huh,” he questioned as he shoved her.  “What a joke.”

   Jenn was not moved by his pushing but did take a step back of her own will. Her eyes did not come off of the doors but the hall kept getting longer. Eventually the hall stopped moving and from the end as she could see it, the hall started warping. It became like waves and twisted unnaturally. The rippling and waving stopped just under her feet causing her to stumble. The waves kept passing her and she was rocked back and forth. Jenn once again began to fall but this time was able to catch herself on the safety rails on the wall. Suddenly the waving stopped and the hall snapped straight again. Jenn held the rail with death's grip. She then felt her weight shift dramatically as gravity seemed to invert itself and her grip meant nothing on the smooth rail. Jenn crashed down into the fluorescent light below which completely shattered under her. She slammed into the wall hitting her head. The double doors at the end of the elongated hallway began to speed back towards Jenn at an alarming speed. Once again the hall began to wave but more violently. Jenn was thrown up and once again crashed into the light. She felt a piece of glass puncture into her left side and a few more pieces cut at her back. And again she was thrown and forced to endure the pain of the glass shards. Jenn screamed out in agony and began to cry. The waves stopped and gravity shifted once more. Then Jenn fell face first onto the tiled floor. All of the glass from the bulb came showering down on her. The music of falling glass on tile chimed through the hall as it made that twinkling noise. Jenn lied there and cried herself a pool of tears. Blood from her back began to seep through her clothes and run down her back. A puddle of blood began to form beneath her. The hall returned to its original form, the glass shards disappeared from the floor, and the light returned to normal. Jenn pushed herself over and sat up. The blood too disappeared along with the cuts to her back and clothing. She continued to cry as the pain from the cuts and crashes continued to swell. She could still feel all of it as though it was all still on her.

“Are you fucking mental woman,"" the man snickered. His eyes turned yellow and lizard-like just as the Nurses did. He continued, “no wonder everyone finds you to be a pathetic, whimpering, and weird loser!”

   She turned and ran from the man. Jenn decided not to go to the double door and instead pushed through the door on her left. As she did this she looked back through the door, horrified by the man and Nurse, then she missed a step. Jenn tripped and tumbled down the stairs behind her. She rolled down them heavily and once again found herself face down on the floor of the landing where the staircase turned. Jennifer pushed herself up with a groan. She looked through her tears back up at the top of the staircase. The door closed itself with a click. She watched intently for a minute but the man did not come through. Jenn staggered and limped to the edge of the step leading down. Taking her eyes off the door she shifted her attention to the staircase and began to walk down. At the bottom were more stairs and another door. As soon as she came to the door she exited with no plan of what to do next. Through the door was another hallway on the left and a nurses station on the right. Jenn moved herself towards the openness of the nurses station. The thought of another enclosed hall sickened her. Phones were ringing endlessly. Behind the noise was that constant beeping of pulse monitors and many indistinct voices. Looking up, Jenn saw the ICU sign, a place she didn’t wish to be. 

“Are you alright, miss,” a female voice asked? 

   Jenn answered, “Yes yes I’m fine.” Without looking at the female nurse Jenn turned her head in the direction of her. She scanned every sign in a desperate struggle for an exit. Before her eyes could zero in on the red glow of an exit sign she found her eyes trained on one room. “4C” was posted over one of the ICU rooms. The curtain covered the glass wall and door that separated the room from the rest of the space.  Suddenly Jennifer was filled with an overwhelming sadness that completely overshadowed the pain she was in. The tears once again flowed from her eyes, not tears of the body, but tears of the heart.  Fully aware that she was disregarding the nurse’s voice he slowly walked towards the room. Jenn placed her hand gently on the door handle and pushed down until a quiet click sounded. She pushed the door open slowly and was quickly greeted.

“Hello,” a frail voice asked.

“M-mom?”

“Jenny,” she asked. “Is that my girl?”

Jenn broke past the curtain quickly and knelt down beside her mother. She took her hand and said, “Mom I missed you so much.” 

“What do you mean sweetie,” she questioned. “You were here just a few hours ago?”

“Mom, I don't know what’s going on.”

   Jenn continued to sob. Her mother lying in the hospital bed was all too real. Her frail and decaying body was just as it had been. Her mothers hair was completely gone. Completely destroyed by the radiation treatments. She was thin and her skin fully tightened to her bones. Unrecognizable from the woman Jenn knew in childhood photos. Jenn had no idea what to do or think. Had she lost her mind completely?

“Oh Jenn. What’s gotten into you? Why are you crying like this, sweetheart?”

“I didn’t think I’d ever see you again!”

“I don’t get it sweetheart. I’m right here. I haven’t moved an inch.” 

“I love you so much Mom. I never got to say goodbye!”

Jenn's mom began to choke up and cry saying, “Jenny why are you talking like I was dead?” 

“Because you are dead Mom,” Jenn bawled. “You’ve been dead for 3 years.”

Jennifer squeezed her mothers hand tightly. Every second of the pain she felt during her mothers cancer treatment swelled back up within her. 

Jenn spoke softly, “the one time I wasn’t at the hospital…” 

“Jenn you haven’t left my side in almost two months,” her Mom insisted as she propped herself up.

“Exactly. I never had to leave. You died when I did. Grandma, Pup, and Josh never should have told me to go. I was fine where I was.”

   Then her Mom coughed. The cough was deep and dry. She coughed again. The second was deeper and dryer. Jenn gripped her mother tight. The heart rate on the monitor began to tick upwards. It sped up and spiked further. Then her Mom coughed a few more times. Her Mom groaned with every cough. Each one sapped her of what little energy she had. On the tenth cough she spat out blood which splattered onto the sheets and dribbled down her chin. Jenn got up quick and leaned over her mother. Her left hand stayed firmly planted on her moms wrist and she placed her right hand on her Moms shoulder. Once again her Mom coughed only this time she also sprayed blood onto Jenn. The pulse monitor continued to speed up. The sound overwhelmed Jenn. “Holy shit Mom,” Jenn questioned with intent panic. Her mom began to cry out in agony. She whimpered and moaned in overwhelming pain. 

“I love you my little girl,” her Mom said through a wail. 

“No Mom,” Jenn cried. “I love you. Please don’t leave me again.” 

“I love you so much Jenn.”

“Help,” Jenn screamed. “Somebody help!”

   Jenn’s Mother coughed again and spat out even more blood. The exertion of the cough caused her to collapse from her upright position. Jenn tried to catch her as she fell but was not able to. Jenn stared in horror at her mother who was now covered in blood. Her Mom strained her body, pushing herself into the hospital bed. She coughed again and dug her hands into the bed. Jenn called again for help. She let go of her mother and frantically looked for the remote that had the help button. Jenn scrambled to the other side of the bed and found the remote hanging off the side. She grabbed the remote and hit the button as soon as it was in her hand. As she did, her mother coughed again and blood pelted Jenn’s right side. Then the sound on the monitor gave way to a flatline. The constant ring of the flatline consumed her ears. She heard nothing but that deafening ring as four doctors, her Grandma, Pup, and Brother Josh rushed into the room. Jenn was completely frozen in place, eyes locked onto her mothers lifeless body. Her Mother’s face was covered in a mixture of tears and blood. The doctors scrambled in an attempt to restore her moms vitals. Time seemed to slow as Jenn looked on at the Doctors who were now performing CPR. Jenn fell into the chair behind her. Her jaw was basically on the floor but she was so shocked by what she had just witnessed that she was no longer crying. She looked up to her family members and saw all of them looking down as they cried. Jenn watched a tear fall from her Grandmother's eye. As she followed its path it stopped midair, fully suspended. Jenn’s eyes widened as she saw this. She looked up and found that the whole room was frozen. The sound from the medical devices and the flatline had completely ceased. Everything stopped inside and outside the room. Jenn had no time to question what was happening as she felt an intense and excruciating surge of pain run down her spine. Jenn wretched and reached to put pressure on her back. Jenn stretched her legs out from the chair in an attempt to reduce the pressure brought on by the pain. She let out a welp of pain and continued to press at her back. The pain began to creep up her back and into her head. Just as quickly, it seeped in and enveloped her whole body down to the pads of her feet. Jenn continued to wriggle and tense as the pain consumed her. Reaching up to her head she rubbed at her temples. Just as with her back, the action did nothing to soothe her pain. She ran her fingers through her hair and as she pulled away from her head a mass of her hair pulled away as well. Jenn held the strands in front of herself and looked at them with fear. Jenn felt her head begin to itch like a wildfire. She looked over to her mothers hairless head and then back at the hair in her hand. Then the hair on her head began to fall away onto the floor. Her skin began to itch considerably as rough patches built up all over her. Jenn screamed out. The tears began to pool up behind her eyes again. Blood began to rush out of her right nostril and quickly bled down to her lips. Jenn let the tears out. They streamed down her face and mixed with the blood. The iron taste in her mouth soon became overwhelmingly salty. Jenn cried out again. Looking up at her mother again she noticed that her hair had grown back and her skin seemed to glow with clarity. Jenn looked on in confusion. Her mother then suddenly began to look more nourished. Jennifer’s skin began to tighten at the same time and her body became gaunt and starved. Jenn gasped as her body constricted. Breathing became terribly difficult. Jenn began to wheeze and wince. Then she coughed. Blood shot out from Jenn’s mouth and splattered down her chest. She grabbed at her chest and lifted her blood covered hand up to eye level. Fully petrified, Jenn continued staring at the blood as it rolled down her hand. A light flashed into Jenn’s eyes. She tore her mind away from her blood stained hand to look at what was blinding her. The tear was glowing like a flashlight right into her face. As soon as she put her eyes back on the tear, the glowing stopped and it became black as night. Then a yellow color formed around the tear until it looked like the silhouette of an eye. It turned up and looked back at Jenn before it disappeared from view. The four doctors and Jennifer’s family members all turned like statues until they all faced her. All of them reanimated and locked their eyes onto Jenn. Her mother then shot up and also locked onto her daughter. 

“Don’t be afraid,” her mother said in a sickeningly deep voice.

   Her mouth was filled with razor sharp teeth. A long tongue came out from her mouth and licked some of the blood off of her face. She began to cackle as the group then began to smile viciously. The congregation began to laugh maniacally. They pointed fingers at her and grabbed their chests as they bellowed. Jenn cried uncontrollably as they laughed at her. 

“You’re useless,” one Doctor said.

“You’re weak,” Josh said.

“You’re so annoying,” Grandma and Pup said in unison.

“You’ll die just like I did,” her Mom said.



   Thunder rattled the house. The rain was once again scattering wildly against the windows. For the third time my call went to voicemail. Cassidy’s name faded off my screen as I ended the call. Sawyer looked over at me in disappointment as he also got no answer from Sam. I looked at him and shrugged. He shrugged back but we both knew it was too late in the night.  Lukas set his phone down on the counter. 

“Sia isn’t answering either,” he said. 

“We’re just gonna have to pack up and go to one of them,” I answered.

“Yep, let’s do it,” Sawyer said as he stood up.

Just then the door opened. The sound of the downpour perfectly masked the sounds of the steps that came through the door. 

“Jenn,” I called out. “Don’t get comfy, We’re leaving.”

“Oh alright,” a male voice replied.

   Sawyer, Luke, Logan, and I all turned our heads and saw Kody in the entrance. Kody was a tall and thin guy with a high level of confidence. Kody always held himself like that of someone high class despite his middle class background. He wore nice clothes, cleaned up well, and took incredibly good care of his curly blond hair. The look would always shatter whenever he opened his mouth. He spoke like a toddler that just learned the word shit and never really cared what he said regardless of how intelligent or unbearably asinine it was. Still his tone was always that of the upper class deserving of respect. As usual he was in grey slacks, a blue polo, and he was wearing his grey track jacket. 

“Where are we going?”

“What is everyone just showing up at will tonight,” Luke said with a laugh.

My gaze focused on Kody and I asked, “Sawyer where is Jenn?”

“I don’t think she came back in yet.”

   I shot up and rushed to the door. Sawyer, Lukas, and Logan all got up to follow me. As I came up to the door I grabbed Kody’s arms just at the biceps. “You’re part of this too now.”  I reached my right arm to the door knob and swung the door open. I turned away from Kody and rushed out. The rain pelted me and quickly soaked my clothing to my skin. The rest of the guys all took the time to throw their jackets on. I was already halfway across the gap between the house and guest house by the time they stepped through the door.  I couldn’t even see through my glasses. The rain covered the lenses like a blanket. I was moving purely off muscle memory. I burst through the door of the guest house. The rain dragged in with me. A flash of lightning and a crack of thunder burst in with me. Brett woke up with a bit of a startle. He sat up and looked at me. Rain splashed in through the open door which showered over Brett. I moved past him quickly, keeping my eyes open for Jenn. The guys rushed in and closed the door with a thud.

“What’s going on Sawyer,” Brett asked softly.

   Kody shrugged at him and Sawyer shook his head. I spotted Jenn, back down, on the floor of the kitchen. Blood was flowing out of her right nostril and pooling up as it dripped onto the floor. Jenn was shaking, or more like nearly convulsing. Her head was twisting back and forth. She was foaming at the mouth and moaning quietly. I immediately kneeled down and hunched over her. Rain water dribbled off of me and sprinkled onto her face.

“Jenn,” I yelled. I grabbed her and shook her firmly. “Jenn wake up sweetheart.”

   Jenn had become pale from the blood loss. Her eyes shot around under her closed eyelids. I grabbed her face gently with both hands. “Jenn you have to snap out of it,” I said. I had no clue what to do. I could not hold my hands steady on her face due to the thrashing. Still I attempted to hold her still. 

“Wake up baby,” I spoke as I lightly slapped her right cheek.

   Brett and the rest of the guys all huddled around me and Jenn. Looking onward with a mixture of fear, confusion, and concern. I reached my right arm under her back and lifted her up to me. My right arm and hand were now covered in blood from the pool below her. She was still shaking sporadically in my arms. The blood from her nose started to drip down to the floor. I grabbed her right hand with my left and squeezed. A few tears streamed down my face but I did everything to hold them back. Jenn’s hand also tightened on mine. Her shaking began to settle down. I took a deep breath in and sighed with relief as a few more large tears beaded down my face. 

“Come on baby,” I pleaded. “Wake up from this.” 

   I bent my head down to kiss her forehead. As my lips made contact I felt a rush of pain in my head and my vision went red. I reeled backwards because of the pain. I still had Jenn tight in my grip. Jenn took a deep, suffocated breath of air and her breathing became normal. The spasms stopped as well and she was still. The drips from her face down to the floor slowed to a near halt. I moved my left hand to caress the right side of her face. The blood on her cheek transferred to my hand but I did not care. I looked longingly at her, praying for her to open an eye. She took another deep, less exacerbated, breath in. She opened her left eye a little and then her right. She could barley hold them half open. She took short shallow breaths in and after a few seconds she spoke.

“J-Jon?”

“Jenn.”

   I smiled at her and I saw a small grin form on her face. I used the bottom of my shirt to wipe away the saliva and blood from her mouth. Then I kissed her with a few more tears running down both our faces. Jenn passed out in my arms and went limp exhausted from the night. I panicked a little bit as soon as I placed a hand on her I could feel her chest rising and falling. I let out a sigh of relief and looked back at the group.

“What the fuck just happened Jon,” Kody asked.

   As he asked this we were all startled by the sound of Lukas' phone ringing on full blast. All of us turned to look at him. As he pulled his phone out of his pocket I could see Sia's name on the screen.

We work hard, live within our means, and recently bought a house we’re proud of. We don’t go around bragging, but we’re not hiding our lives either. We enjoy nice things, take trips, and share the occasional photo. Nothing over the top.

His family, though, especially his sister, always has something to say. Whenever we’re around them, it’s passive-aggressive comments like “money isn’t everything” or “some people forget where they came from.” She’s made little digs about our house, our food choices, even our dog. And she constantly posts vague stuff online clearly aimed at us, like calling out “people who think they’re successful just because they can afford fancy coffee and vacations.”

The part that really frustrates me is that her husband came to us a few months ago, totally stressed because they were behind on their mortgage. We gave him a few thousand dollars to help out, no questions, no conditions. She doesn’t even know. We didn’t tell anyone because we weren’t trying to embarrass them.

And to make matters worse, when their grandfather passed away, we covered the full cost of getting the whole family, including her and her husband, to the funeral. Flights, hotel, everything. We never asked for a dime back. We just wanted to make sure everyone could be there to say goodbye.

Despite all that, the jabs and the judgment haven’t stopped. So I told my man I was done. We stepped back from the group chats, stopped showing up to every event, and have just been keeping our distance. We’re not rude, we’re just protecting our peace.

Now his family is acting like we’re the problem. Saying we’ve changed, that we’re punishing them for not being where we are in life. But nobody knows what we’ve done behind the scenes to help them out and show up when it counted.

We never did any of it for recognition, but part of me is starting to feel like maybe keeping quiet just made us easier to resent. AITA for finally setting a boundary?

1kjpuuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CercleMusic/comments/1kjpuuf/moby_cercle_odyssey_los_angeles_convention_center/,Moby @ Cercle Odyssey Los Angeles Convention Center (9:30pm),"My first-draft review; providing it here to be timely. This version is missing images and some other niceties. The edited and revised version will be published tomorrow on my blog. 

TLDR: Not a magical dancefloor and not worth the price of admission. But ticket prices on the secondary market have crashed to \~25% of their original value, and at this price, it might be worth checking out. Last night's highlights include Moby performing his hits with a roster of six other live musicians. Lowlights include a broken concept, terrible acoustics, and amateurish lighting design. Cercle as an organization have lost sight of the dance magic that made their events popular. 

WORD ON THE STREET POPS CERCLE'S BUBBLE

We attended Moby's performance for Cercle Odyssey in Los Angeles last night. The event was part of new series marketed as ""the world’s first immersive 360° nomadic installation"" in which artists including Moby, Black Coffee, The Blaze, Whomadewho, Monolink, Mura Masa, Ben Bohmer, Bonobo, and Max Richter perform for roughly two hours ""in the round"" -- in the center of a room surrounded by their audience. 

Despite the impressive roster of talent, these events are, unfortunately, unsuccessful, and aftermarket ticket prices have crashed as disappointed attendees have shared their impressions in scathing online threads. After the Mexico City series of events sold out, word of mouth soured appetites for future events, and of the remaining 19 events scheduled for Los Angeles and Paris, just two are ""sold out."" 

What's going wrong for Cercle, an organization that prior to Odyssey had built a powerful brand that music lovers trusted by producing over 250 high-end music events, including its own festival? I went in to investigate the situation first-hand last night, and have some thoughts. 

KOYAANISQATSI = LIFE OUT OF BALANCE 

During the stage reset time between the laughably-short 30-minute DJ set by Eli & Fur, Cercle distracted our attention by playing a six-minute excerpt from the award-winning film, Koyaanisqatsi, an 86-minute documentary without narration or dialog that features beautifully filmed montages accompanied by a minimal score by Philip Glass. Cercle explained they were showing us this excerpt because the film had been an inspiration for Odyssey. 

The film's title, pronounced ""koy · aa ·nuh · skaat · see"" is a Hopi word for ""life out of balance"" (meaning, literally, ""chaotic life"") and the film shows, through its juxtapositions of natural and man-made settings, how the modern world's embrace of technology might be contributing to modern chaos. 

This event demonstrated the truth of the film. Cercle's biggest mistake is the concept -- from what I can tell, they invested so much in the video production, and spent so much on the visual element of the event, that it distracted not just the audience, but the event production team from the quality of the musical experience. 

Cercle states on the Odyssey website that they wanted each event to ""unfold like a living painting with videos projected onto the walls and ceiling, all synchronized live with the music."" They likely believed this would be a path to success because the heart of their brand was about putting music into beautiful settings such as the Eiffel Tower, hot air balloons over Cappadocia, the Giza Pyramids, and other gorgeous destinations around the world. They likely believe that the beauty of these settings was important to the success of their prior events (and it's hard to argue the hundreds of millions of views [their YouTube videos of these events have accrued to date](https://www.youtube.com/@Cercle/videos)). 

But needing a fancy location ultimately limited the growth of the firm, because beautiful settings aren't that easy to book. I imagine the board meeting in which Cercle's leadership team twisted their mustaches and proposed replacing natural beauty with the technology of projection.**Exec 1**: We can’t just book the pyramids or the Eiffel Tower over and over, and most of the world can't get there. Shareholders demand growth!

**Exec 2**: We will host events in warehouses—

**Exec 1**: Warehouses? Hideous! That's not the Cercle brand!

**Exec 2**: S’il vous plaît, let me finish. In zese warehouses, we shall project video of stunning places. Our target consumer lives in screens — zey won’t know ze difference.

**Exec 1**: Genius.  

Actually, to be fair, I seriously doubt Cercle exec team are mustache-twisting villains, and yet it's hard to read positive intent into the decisions that led to the design of Odyssey. It failed on the most critical elements of a proper dance party. 

# THE CAMERA PROBLEM

One of the big selling points for me for the event, when I purchased tickets without knowing who the headliner would be, was the promise of a camera free event. At the event check-in, our phones were put into Yondr pouches so that our eyes would ""be the sole witnesses to the experience ahead."" 

And yet, once we entered the space, we noticed cameras everywhere. Not snuck in by attendees, but wielded by official photographers. We had surrendered our phones at the door only to encounter an environment bristling with surveillance on the inside. Photographers with heavy DSLRs rigs moved around the space catching crowd reactions to the music. Yet other photographers held cell phones aloft to capture ""authentic""-looking vertical footage that could be used for marketing the events on social media. There were cameras mounted over the entire floor -- a fact that we were reminded of when the event floor was shown from above on the large video screens.

Cercle, on their website, require people going to their event to agree to the following: 

""By going to this event, you irrevocably consent to being filmed and photographed, and allow Cercle to use your image and your voice in any media, for any purpose, anywhere in the world and in perpetuity without limitation and without financial compensation.""This wasn't a camera-free event, and it wasn't even a phone-free event. I'm thankful for the fact that I wasn't surrounded by a group of phone zombies holding their phones aloft the entire time, but I didn't feel safe at all to dance as if nobody was watching, because I was perpetually under a lens.  Just a couple days after publishing my article on how [the panopticon](https://www.magicaldancefloors.com/p/wheres-the-party-at-not-on-phone) fucks dancefloors, I had unwittingly stepped into one. 

Cercle likely calculated that they would have an easier time getting punters to buy tickets if they promised a post-event recording, so the heavy use of cameras was necessary to deliver on that promise. But what happened to simply attending a party, without needing a digital memento? 

# TOO QUIET, MUDDY SOUND 

I found the sound to be too quiet, first of all. Wearing my 17dB filters in my 1of1custom earplugs, I found the sound too quiet. Consulting my Apple Health data the morning after, I learned that the room's ""exposure without sound reduction"" measure averaged 94dB, with a range of 75dB to 105dB. The better rooms I've been in tend to measure about 103dB on this same measure of sustained exposure, which is a massive gap -- a 103dB room sounds about twice as loud, to our ears. 

The sound pressure levels had likely been tamped down due to the acoustics of the space. The bass was muddy and boomy, with unintentional reverb in the cavernous Los Angeles Convention Center Space. I don't know if acoustically transparent projection screens were being used, but I thought I could also hear faint slapback from the high frequencies bouncing off of the vinyl sheets onto which all the visuals were being projected. 

One Redditor [wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/CercleMusic/comments/1kj5ra5/what_a_garbage_show_la_moby_cercle_odyssey/), ""Music always comes first. The sound was horrible - muffled and low. It sounded like I was in a cafeteria. I could hear everyone speak."" 

Another agreed, ""This person is not over-exaggerating when they say it was muffled garbage in a cafeteria. There was no clarity and delineation of the different musicians. You couldn't make out what the singers were saying. Moby was doing cool hybrid live dance tracks, and you couldn't hear his beat played by hand on the drums on top of the track. It was muddy one note bass with everything buried in the mix."" 

Cercle partnered with L-Acoustics for the sound, but there's a story here that we'll probably never know about why the sound was problematic. It may have been venue-specific, or it may have to do with a deeper flaw with the sound design, as attendees in Mexico City were lodging similar complaints about the sound. Ultimately, the Cercle event is designed to deliver a standardized experience across locations. It's all done inside a box that's 50 meters long by 10 meters high. Perhaps the acoustic treatments (or lack thereof) around the Odyssey boxes is insufficient, perhaps the screen-centric nature of the experience muddies the sound. 

Regardless of reason, not nailing the sound is a cardinal sin, especially for an event with such a sizable production budget.

# VISUALS DETRACTED; SEVERELY UNDERCOOKED LIGHTING

Overall, the lighting was entirely too bright. The screens that surrounded us on all sides, and the screens overhead infused the space with ambient light that -- in combination with the omnipresent cameras -- made us feel like subjects lit up for the camera.  Some 16 or so 50,000-lumen 3DLP projectors from Panasonic provided crisp visual projections, but harshed the vibe with their high-lumen output. A good dance party is mostly dark. This one was too bright at all times. 

Short folks -- like my girlfriend 5'4"" -- could only see the top third of the screens anyway, so all they did for her was provide a lot of unwelcome ambient light that made it hard for us to feel comfortable. At one point, she remarked, ""I feel like I'm surrounded by Microsoft screen savers,"" but then later upgraded it to ""Apple TV screensavers."" There was a sort of soulless aestheticism to these videos that betrays Cercle's lack of creative vision.

What's more, the lighting sequences were actively bad. The primary moving heads used were Claypaky Sharpys, a light that costs about $7,000 USD per fixture. There were at least 150 of these in use throughout the venue, with about \~110 of them in the room with us. I can tell when someone has lovingly programmed lighting sequences and spend a lot of time obsessing over the brilliant effects that can be experienced in dancefloors such as Yuma, Despacio, Berghain, Wall of Sound, etc. These moving heads were hardly programmed to move, stuck to a few color sequences, and were minimally programmed.

Moby played three or four of his more ""ravey"" records, and the lighting was positively embarrassing during these moments, with all the lights popping off here and there, chaotically, without much grace. The green lasers fired off near the end of the event felt cheesy. It was some normie's idea of rave lighting -- absolutely disgraceful. Whoever was on the lights needs to be given more time, and perhaps more education, so that they can do the job these artists deserve. 

# MOBY SAVES THE DAY

Luckily, Moby's an experienced performer and his performance, after the laughably short ""DJ set"" by Eli & Fur gave the event some redeeming value. Here's some of what he played for us: In the first half of the event, Moby's tracks were more artsy and epic -- like the soundtrack to a beautiful nature documentary. He played downtempo, trance, and house with lots of strings, melodic angel choruses, and uplifting vibes. Songs included:  

* In This World
* Bed 
* Dark Days (Tonic Water Remix) by Moby & Lady Blackbird
* Go (with live bongos by Moby)
* God Moving Over the Face of the Waters 
* Porcelain

About halfway through, Moby got on the mic for the first time to talk about his first-ever performance in Los Angeles in 1991. He and Jason Bentley helped build out of plywood for this rave, and he admitted to being a ""little rave kid"" at heart.  He played several ravey tracks, then returned to something like his greatest hits catalog: 

* Bring Back My Happiness
* Morningside
* Natural Blues
* The Broken Places
* Feeling So Real (Siona Remix) by Moby, Miss Monique
* Where Is Your Pride (Essel Remix) by Moby & Benjamin Zephaniah
* Honey
* We Are All Made of Stars
* Bodyrock

Moby and team struggled a bit with the ""in the round"" nature of the stage. He tried to move around the stage and give equal time to people on all four sides of the stage, but his movements seemed a touch awkward as he navigated turns at the corners. For the budget, Cercle probably could have put Moby and the other six artists on the stage with him on a rotating platform.

# BUT DOES IT DANCE?

Cercle Odyssey's design undermines dancefloor vibrancy. 

By putting the performer on a raised stage in the center of the room and lighting them, the choicest dancing real estate is given over to the performer. The design makes it clear that everyone should face the center, and the rectangular stage had four times the length of ""rail"" of a typical stage. There were rails (aka crowd barriers) all around the stage, and everyone who got to the rail held on for dear life, as did most of the second and third rows behind them. This means that about half the room was hard-locked into facing the stage at all times, and these folks generally danced a lot less because of the constraints of being in proximity to the railing. 

The event certainly wasn't oversold (it hadn't sold out) and there was plenty of room to dance. But the dominant presence of the stage combined with the overwhelmingly bright screens around the room meant that the performers and the visuals were commanding 90% of audience attention. On healthy dancefloors, the action is on the dancefloor, not up on a stage or on screens around the room. 

The crowd were mostly polite to each other. Los Angelenos in their 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, and 60s, with an average age of maybe 35. They didn't show a ton of entitled behavior, outside of a few very yappy finance bros and two obnoxiously drunk women. 

Unfortunately, Moby's set list also made catching and holding onto a dance groove pretty difficult. The tempo of the music bounced around from slow ambient to house to techno, and the pause and applause between songs stopped all dancing entirely. It was a concert, and concerts rarely have great dancefloors.

The VIP area's entrance and exit sent snooty VIPs (who danced even less) through the GA area, and they were often so insistent on their need to get to or from the VIP section that they barged through dancing groups mid-song without a care. 

Four front-of-house staff sat on their laptops at the foot of the stage on one side of the rectangular stage, dampening dance energy with their stillness and their forest of equipment.

The Yondr pouches were also awkward hindrances to dance. They slapped against bodies that dared to move, and the chintzy straps that held them dug into our skin uncomfortably once we worked up a sweat. 

Even the merch experience wasn't designed for dancing. Those who purchased merchandise had to carry it into the event with them -- there were plenty of folks saddled with merch shopping bags gamely dancing a little, but it was obvious that the shopping bags were not helping them feel like busting a move.

# WHY EVEN BOTHER WITH CONCERTS? 

It's become clear to me at this point in the Magical Dancefloors journey that concerts aren't raves, and that concerts rarely (if ever) offer vibrant dancefloor experiences. 

Cercle Odyssey made some promises in the marketing of this event that suggested that they cared about creating and curating a great dancefloor. I'm dumb to have fallen for it, especially at the cost of $200 per ticket. That's on me. But I'm grateful for the experience because it's helped me draw a sharper line between magical and muggle dancefloors. 

I do have one more concert experience to review: I attended Phish at the Hollywood Bowl recently and am eager to share some thoughts from that experience. Stay tuned!

It didn’t happen all at once. It wasn’t like he woke up and checked the Fuck Inventory and saw a flashing red “0” next to “FUCKS REMAINING.” No, Mitch had been slowly bleeding fucks for years—leaking them in meetings where people asked dumb questions, hemorrhaging them in traffic while influencers filmed themselves in the fast lane, misplacing them during family dinners where someone inevitably brought up Facebook conspiracy bullshit.

But that Tuesday—mid-sip of lukewarm gas station coffee, standing in line behind a woman FaceTiming her ex about “what a narcissist he is”—Mitch hit critical fucklessness. He blinked. Something inside him evaporated. And just like that, no more fucks.

He didn’t yell. He didn’t make a scene. He just walked out of the line, left the coffee on the counter, and said to nobody in particular, “Fuck this.”

Then he kept walking. Out of the store. Out of the town. Out of every obligation stitched into his calendar by other people’s expectations. He didn’t call work. He didn’t respond to texts that said, “Hey, quick favor…” or “Can you just…” or “We need to circle back.” Fuck your favor. Fuck your circle. Mitch had transcended.

His inbox, full of unread emails labeled “URGENT,” grew louder with silence. His voicemail begged for fucks, but there were none to spare. He got one call from someone who asked, “Do you even care anymore?” And Mitch, with a serene calm usually reserved for monks or stoners on mountaintops, said, “Fuck no.”

He slept when he wanted, ate what he wanted, laughed too loud at nothing in particular, and let people assume whatever the fuck they wanted about him. He was free—not happy in some cheesy, motivational poster kind of way, but in a raw, unfiltered, sun-on-your-face-while-everything-burns-behind-you kind of way.

One day, someone asked him, “Don’t you worry about what people think?”

Mitch just smiled. “I ran out of fucks,” he said. “And it turns out, life runs a hell of a lot smoother when you stop giving them to people who don’t deserve them.”

He paused, lit a joint, exhaled slowly, and added, “Fuck ‘em.”

You start off with points to use. We got 2,000+, plenty for vacay.  And 2, we got a cash option for no extra fee. With this, we pay a far reduced rate for a whole week. (Pennys on the dollar) This is probably 30% of retail price to stay. A week. (My wife, who is better at Numbers than I, said it’s even less than 30%). And if you don’t wanna stay for a week, you can get out of the property sooner and still be way ahead with what you paid.

The club also comes with its interval club-a partnership of international hotels. I have yet to sort out whether the interval club alone has 30,000 cribs, or that’s combined with Hyatt’s luxury all-inclusive. Ah, but who’s counting.

Here’s the kicker, you can rent out properties you book, undersell the resort (room, property, villa, whatever) and pocket the difference.  Now, this is some real money coming from a side hustle.

observations based on previous comments: 
 - if you call this a timeshare, you don’t know what your talking about. Period. 
- if you think the sales Presentation was a waste of time of your time… I know of people pocketing $50k in six months, up to 100 k in less than 18 months by renting out properties they previously booked. 

So bore me again!  Otherwise, I advise, drink a cup of coffee if your that impaired, or a glass of wine, and have fun by trying to try stump them with questions.

(It wasn’t boring, by the way—an education in vacay real estate investing, which has kept our  family earning a cool $60k in just the winter, plus through-the-roof equity, is always a good convo, IMO.)

We parked and walked to meet them at a craft shop. I smoked a cigarette on the way from the car to the shop. When we got there my 6 year old niece waved to me from inside with a big smile so I threw my cigarette butt in the gutter, stomped it out to make sure it wasn't lit, and rushed inside to hug my niece. We were in the shop for about 10 minutes then came out to the street to walk down the block for a coffee.

HOWEVER, their pfp is of someone that looks like a man, so I thought ok maybe they’re trans. That’s fine, I wouldn’t be against dating a trans person but I’d like it to be a mtf not ftm. Their pronouns listed in their bio are he/him too. 

This is where I might ruffle some feathers but: their pronouns are he/him. How does that even work. Isn’t a lesbian someone who identifies as a woman, born female or not, who is attracted to non-men? So if you’re mtf & identify you’re a man imo. 

Please no hate. I’m just confused. I’m very progressive esp on social issues but I just don’t really get this. Also trying to stay safe because I don’t know this person and while I’m always happy and willing to make new friends, I don’t wanna end up on Dateline or anything.

This school is really designed for only a specific demographic to thrive in. As a gay, mixed, first generation, and low-income person, I do not fit in at all. I even went to the LGBTQ+ center too and still didn't feel welcomed or feel like I fit in. Being at UVA has brought my mental health down drastically and has caused me to become even more lonely and isolated since I don't connect with the people here.

I'm not into Greek life and that is the MAIN thing at this school. I hate partying, drinking, etc. and that seems to be all anyone wants to do here. In my opinion, I find it all to be trashy and disgusting to be honest.

Since I'm a third year now, my chances at making friends are over. I will probably just make more acquaintances (which is rare in itself and usually mean nothing anyways), but not lifelong friends. I just don't know what to talk to people about, I can't carry a conversation, I connect with no one, and if I don’t have a reason to talk to people, then I just don’t. Plus, no one here even tries to befriend me or talks to me, so I dislike them for that too. Not to mention, it's too late for me anyways. Groups are already established and there is no place for me in them. There aren't any clubs that are willing to accept 3rd years either. It’s very limited, which is not how it should be at all. I'm just so sick of being here anymore and see no point in any of it. Life sucks and I'm over it. UVA has not made my life better, either.

Anyways, I like fashion, psychology (for personal reasons), WGS is interesting, I like cars, technology, stand up comedy (depending on who it is), I listen to comedic podcasts, interior design is cool, watching YouTube, watching tv, and I like coffee. It's not much to really connect with anyone at this school, though. I've really wanted to try out tennis because it seems quite fun, but I have no idea how to get into that. I have no one to play tennis with either, so I can't play it anyways.

I decided to give them formal notice, I made sure to pin it inside my forehead, but they ignored it. Thirty days later, I managed to clear them out by listening to a combination of white-noise and tinnitus. And for a while, it was quiet, too quiet.

Then one day, I was taking the elevator with my neighbor who lives in apartment 3B, she complained to me that she keeps hearing existential whispers inside the cutlery drawer. Then I kept receiving more and more complaints from the rest of my neighbors and other tenets, one of them said he caught one of the voices taunting his roomba, telling it to vacuum the family cat. Eventually, they unionized, and I got served legal papers, it was full of legal jargon that I didn't understand, and I remembered that one of the voices had said he used to be a lawyer in another mind. So, I looked for the apartment he now haunted and slipped the paper under the door and asked him to explain it.

Basically, I was considered liable under ""Psychospiritual Infrastructure Code 19b"" since I was ""the original host"". The legal battle was long and exhausting, carried out across negotiating-coffee-tables and attempts to reach settlements in shower thoughts. The judge said that the voices ""significantly contributed to the ambiance of my personality"", and that evicting them constituted ""emotional gentrification"".

Then, one night, they decided to sneak back into my head while I slept. One of them claimed he was there to pick up some thoughts and daydreams he had left behind, another one said he needed a place to stay as he was in between minds.

I figured out that they're sneaking in using my subconscious while I was busy dreaming, so I decided to change the password on it. I was unable to do even that, because they had hired my sleep paralysis demon as protection or a bouncer. He accepted their money because he ""needed a dental plan and the right to blink"".

In the past, I have gone to my favorite local coffee shop and spent like 7 bucks a day on my iced vanilla latte, like most people. All I cared about was that it was sweet and tasted good, but not too sweet that you can't actually taste the coffee. (lame I know haha). That’s about mh entire history with coffee. 

Recently, I went in on the Breville barista express after getting tired of buying a 7 dollar latte every day, so equipment wise I know I have more than enough for what I’m gonna be doing lol. 

My first question is about beans. I’m in Boston, I’ve been looking for local roasters to pickup beans, but I’m wondering if online ordering is better given the variety.

Second, I need to figure out how to actually taste espresso lmao.

Every time I have tried a shot of espresso, it's like alcohol for me lol, just bitter and impossible to actually taste what ""flavor profile"" it provides. I always see people drinking whiskey or gin, and I could never; it all tastes the same to me lol. It almost feels like that with espresso, except the difference is I could actually see myself enjoying the taste of it. Anytime I have tried coffee without anything in it, it just tastes objectively bitter and bad, but I want to learn how I can adapt my palate to really get an understanding of how to taste these different tasting notes, brew methods, and beans. I'd love to learn more about enjoying espresso and know/taste the difference between good and bad espresso. There are so many videos out there that it is easy to get lost among all of the different opinions/methodologies. Between James Hoffman, lance Hendricks and all of these creators it’s just a lot at once, and I don’t understand half of it (although do enjoy watching it) 

Lastly, I see a lot of videos on making straight-up espresso and cappuccino with these machines, but I haven't found anything else on how to make more ""Americanized"" drinks lol. I know a lot of that milk, ice, and syrup will drown out the actual espresso, but I'm still curious as I know nothing lmao, and I have definitely had better quality lattes than others.

1kjphqi,https://i.redd.it/9yh0b49f020f1.jpeg,Cat suddenly afraid of kitchen,"My cat (1 year old ex-street-cat adopted 3 days ago) has suddenly started avoiding the kitchen and seeking more affection/reassurance from my partner than usual. He's also begun seeking out lower/covered places, including under the coffee table, under chairs, inside of bookshelves, and wedged between the couch and coffee table. Attempts to give comfort on the couch surface result in him dropping into the ""trench"", but he readily accepts pets once he's in more enclosed areas. Normally very food motivated, he is reluctant to go near the kitchen (where his food and water are) unless my partner is actively standing over him. 

Our laundry room is off the kitchen, and our washer and dryer are older (read: loud), and our A/C (also somewhat loud) has been running all day due to a temporary heat wave. Are we overwhelming him with sounds? Our current hypothesis is that he's afraid of the washer and/or dryer, but wanted to get y'all's take on this in case we're missing something obvious. We're first-time cat owners and want to do right by him - any thoughts, tips, or suggestions are welcome to try and make him more comfortable. ",1,1746926714.0,CATHELP,1,1.0,False
1kjphef,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1kjphef/modern_architecture_is_much_better_than/,Modern architecture is much better than gothic-style,"I'm going to be frank with you; the bustling Shibuya crosswalks, the aesthetics of New York City. The feeling of leaving the airport, seeing the skyline, jazz in the background; all of these architecture is just better.

First of all, most Gothic architecture isn't even meant for public use in any real sense. It simply doesn't make sense why use them at all. Cathedrals with their massive domes and  aren’t places where you hang out, grab coffee, or meet friends. They're cold, echoing spaces designed to make you feel insignificant in the face of divine power. That might have been cool in 1400 but life isn't that. Yes, I'm religious, and yeah I think these are impressive but tbh; life is so much more than this. ""High-church"" ism used to be a centre of life until you realize that 90% is just exterior while 10% is like a stand and some chairs. Hindu temples are better, Buddhist IG but when you really think about; Gothic architecture serves no purpose. It doesn't really do anything

Ok, sure, but we're arguing about which looks better, right? Before, you comment that all new architecture is simply glass-repetition, uno reverse card. What's so interesting about gothic places anyways? Pointed arches, stained glass windows, it’s the same, copy-pasted across Europe. Castles are nice and all, but the stone-style is simply eye-redding and DO NOT get me started on the houses. It's walking through town squares and cemeteries to go to brick, wood or quartz houses; which are impressive but also really not interesting. The style of all the gothic structures just repeats over and over. Sure, there's variation, some, but not a lot. It’s heavy, it’s sombre, and worst of all, it doesn’t adapt. Every Gothic building is locked in its medieval mindset. It's simply a picture of old religious people who thought that this style would work, even if it clearly doesn't. Let's not forget about lots of other things. The domes, the glass, pretty but it's not that appealing. The Middle Ages are SO BORING and the 'grand' 'divine' architecture from that time represents that. IDK if it's because I hate the style or I personally find mediaeval history boring, I predict it's both.

Now, obviously BOOMERS love to complain that modern buildings are glass boxes,"" but that’s unpopular. Modern architecture is actually diverse, sure it can be minimal and clean, but it can also be wild and expressive. Look at Tokyo with its chaotic layering of neon signs, or NYC with its skyline. Modern buildings house art galleries, pop-up stores, rooftop gardens, and underground clubs. They're built for real people doing real things, not for priests chanting Latin. It's literally living, NYC is 'the city that never sleeps,' while average English townships are cities that never wake up. UK is considered to be like a boomer kind of area, and it's all thanks to the architecture.

And then we come to cyberpunk cities And honestly, the coolest direction cities have ever gone. Think of places like Shibuya, Seoul, or even parts of Hong Kong, where neon lights clash against  glass, and everything is alive. A dystopia to you is simply a utopia to me. Add some vapourwave and synths and we've made beauty. These cities feel electric, unpredictable, and thrilling. Jazz playing in the background, vibrant alleyways, everything makes you feel like you're in urban heaven, that the city is living, and you're one of its cells. They’re not perfect, but they’re alive, and that’s worth more than a thousand cathedrals.

**65. Kalle Strawman, later Kivi Charmcaster.**

Outside of the castle walls, Kivi travelled to Tartosa where he met his wife Kinsley, and they restored a small bookstore together. There they met some fellow survivors - Kynn, King, and Kimberly. Together the group saved Tartosa from a mysterious supernatural ""curse"", and made the town safe again.

Armed with ElectroMagnetic Pulse generators, Kivi and his friends headed into Windenburg and freed Castle Sigworth from the AI horde. Soon the castle became a popular trade hub, with it's comfortable bedrooms & spacious dining hall. The strong walls gave a sense of safety which was beyond value in a post-apocalyptic world.

They then went on to save his wife's homeland, Henford-on-Bagley, from an eternally raging storm. With both their homelands, and their adopted home of Tartosa, free from their respective apocalyptic horrors, the team went on to save Forgotten Hollow and Ravenwood from a bloodborne disease which had affected the local vampire population, engulfing them in a mindless bloodlust.

Finally Kivi felt that he had redeemed his family name - as much as one person could. Kivi and his wife Kinsley took their children across the sea and built the foundations of a new town - the Willow Creek settlement.

Their goal was to revitalise the surface world and bring back civilisation.

Kivi worked as a manual labourer, building a home for their family, and leading the construction of a town hall and a new school.

Kinsley dreamt of being a teacher and homeschooled their children. When others began to joint heir settlement, Kinsley continued working in daycare on the weekends, and during the weekdays she ran the new schoolhouse. Though she lamented the lack of a formal educational system.

Together they raised five children, and met up with their old friends many times before they finally decided to retire. They left the settlement in the hands of their grown children, and spent the last years of their lives travelling in the Eastern Continent - back to the lands they had saved.

**66. Lumi Charmcaster.**

Lumi and her siblings carried on their parents' work. Lumi pursued a career in botany, bringing small-scale gardening to the area. Her husband Nyon continued Kinsley's efforts in education, opening the region's first highschool.

Lumi's younger siblings contributed too - Laulu became a handyperson, bringing basic appliances and plumbing to the off-grid settlement. Lemminkäinen took charge of the food stores, bringing in a rudimentary retail system. Loviatar dedicated their life to fishing, bringing in much needed food to the household, and teaching the skill to others. Even little Louhi contributed, forming the first post-apocalyptic scouts organisation.

Lumi and Nyon had four kids of their own. Nyon passed away too soon, as death finally caught up with him. His wife and children would never forget him. Lumi stayed to look after their grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren, before returning to the Eastern Continent where she spent the last days of her long long life with her old friends.

But the story wasn't over for her! She continued ""living"" her best life as a ghost, joining the thriving community in Ravenwood. She would never return to the Western Continent - uncertain how a ghost would fare on the open seas.

**67. Muru Charmcaster.**

Muru married Lari Kingsley - a half-cat-sim. Despite being the generation above her, they were closer in age than Lari was to any of his siblings. His father, King, had travelled with Muru's grandparents, and the family had eventually joined them in Willow Creek before Lari was born.

Muru and Lari had gone to school together, and as time passed their friendship had turned into a romance. The two supported each other as they aimed for their goals. While Muru dreamed of innovative building techniques and complex architecture, Lari was passionate about food. He dreamed of not only creating safer ways to store food long term, but to also bring back fine dining.

Eventually they would achieve their goals, with Muru becoming a civil designer, and Lari becoming something of a celebrity chef.

As the first generation in their family to be born in the developing Willow Creek settlement, Muru's siblings set high goals for themselves too.

Mertsi - Mechanical Engineer, creating amazing feats of architecture previously beyond the reach of the settlers.

Matteus - Education Professor, continuing their father's work in education and allowing others to pursue skills such as medicine. Matteus would go on to open the first university above the surface in hundreds of years.

The youngest, Mielikki - Tech Guru Start-up Entrepreneur , providing support for daring new enterprises, and generally helping others achieve their goals.

**68. Noora Charmcaster.**

With the infrastructure built by the previous generations, life was stable and comfortable in the thriving Willow Creek Settlement. Though there were still many advancements waiting to be made, Noora's generation saw a gap in society - a lack of recreational activities and creative arts.

Her siblings pursued art, literature, sports, and comedy, bringing an array of recreational businesses to the region.

Noora followed in Grandma Lumi's footsteps, being something of a green thumb herself. Noora became a florist, wanting to show that gardening could be done for beauty as well as practicality. She ended up marrying Quinn, a handsome sim whose family had immigrated to Willow Creek when he was a teenager. Quinn felt that the settlement had reached a stage where law and order was needed. He became a very popular politician and was influential in developing a political system modelled loosely after that of his parents' homeland, Mt. Komorebi.

**69. Onni Charmcaster.**

Onni kept her old name even after she transitioned. Some might have found that odd, but her wife Maria always accepted her unconditionally. Even when Onni couldn't decide on a career, and decided to create her own - becoming a freelance crafter and supplying the settlement with any odds and ends they might request. In her downtime she would tinker around and inadvertently discovered several small ways to drastically improve their everyday lives.

With Onni's lax work schedule she was in a perfect position to support Maria as she pursued a career in business management. Maria fought to improve work conditions for all, and was the first to institute paid days off, maternity leave, and retirement.

Though they didn't look alike nor share any common personality traits, Onni and her siblings enjoyed a peaceful life. The eldest triplet, Omena, went into politics like their father. The settlement had been thriving, and the family found themselves living luxuriously thanks to their vast garden of money trees. Omena wanted to give back to the community, and focused on the charitable side of politics.

Oivi, the youngest, didn't really fancy the idea of a hands-on job like Onni, nor did she want to spend so much energy socialising like Omena. All she wanted to do was sit inside her comfortable house and read. However, she knew she was expected to work if she wanted to continue living in the family home, and so she selected a career that her uncle assured her was easy - journalism. She'd have a bit of a head start in the field since her uncle was such a famous author, and, being a Charmcaster, she had close connections with all sorts of newsworthy sims - such as her father, the national leader of Willow Creek.

Onni and Maria decided to put off having children until Maria had achieved her career goals, but eventually they were delighted to welcome three daughters into their lives. Sadly they would have little time with their children before a tragic fire took the lives of several sims, including Onni and Maria.

**70. Päivi Charmcaster.**

Orphaned, Päivi and her sisters were raised by their aunt Omena. Sometimes it felt like she only took them in because it made her look more generous, and took the spotlight off of her status as a single mother. Aunt Omena would get the children all dressed up and trailing nicely behind her for every public appearance and charity benefit.

Still, Päivi and her sisters were raised well, and their aunt never showed favouritism towards her own child over her nieces.

Desperate to get out of the spotlight, Päivi took an office job with a Mt. Komorebi company which had recently opened a branch in Willow Creek. The job was demanding, and the office hours were unforgiving, but being busy with work was the perfect excuse to get out of any publicity situation her aunt may try to drag her into.

Doing nothing but working and sleeping as she made her way up the career ladder, it won't come as a surprise that Päivi met her partner at work. Together the two of them rose through the ranks of the company, finally reaching the top and becoming Willow Creek's first power couple - though they were never really able to articulate what exactly their company does. Regardless, their experience in the corporate world led to deeper understanding of work-life balance, and they co-wrote a self-help book titled ""Work easier, not stupider"".

Her sisters went in the opposite direction, one devoting her life to becoming the lead fashion stylist of Willow Creek, and the other sort of drifted about for a while before, to everyone's surprise, becoming the most sought after professional athlete on the continent.

And their cousin, Omena's son, descended from the most influential people in the entire country? Well he used his mother's money and connections to open his own cafe. It was his in name only, as his long-term girlfriend actually did most of the business side of things. He spent the rest of his life lounging around and occasionally making some coffee here or there when the mood stuck him.

**Training**

I took a 5 year hiatus from running and during that time, I developed an addiction to alcohol that culminated with outpatient detox in November of 2024. I was drinking a 5th of Vodka daily as a minimum (it always ends with Vodka...) from 2022 until my detox. Prior to 2022, a 5th would last me around two days.I don't wish withdrawals on anybody and I still take Gabapentin daily to stave off alcohol cravings. During the detox, I decided that this was a second shot at having a productive life outside of just drinking, working and wondering how quickly I could end a work meeting so I could go have a drink.

A few days after the withdrawal shakes went away and I finished my dose of Librium, I bought a Garmin Enduro 3, downloaded Strava, Carb Manager and started the work. I initially went out for runs at a pace of 11:54 min/mi. I utilized the run-walk method and quickly learned that it was going to take a lot to even finish a mile without feeling like I would have a panic attack and pass out.

I started utilizing Garmins Daily Suggested Workouts at the end of November for a duration of 14 weeks. I found that the Daily Suggested workouts of base building were extremely helpful as a (once again) beginner and in November I ran a total of 8.6 miles. December 2024 - 77.2 miles, January 2025 - 84 miles, February 2025 - 115.8 miles, March 2025 - 145.9 miles, April - 144.6 miles. 

In November after a week of sobriety, I had found out that my bloodwork was just trash. My total cholesterol was 211 mg/dL (range is 0-199) and my triglycerides were 261 mg/dL (range is 0-150). These are just two of the metrics amongst others that were not looking good. My blood pressure upon waking was routinely 180/100 during the first few weeks of being sober. My blood pressure while being an alcoholic was even higher than this, pushing 190/120 on multiple occasions with a resting heart rate of 80-90 bpm. There was a long period of time during my addiction where I avoided doctors, hospitals, or really anywhere medical where a professional would put 2 and 2 together and call me out. This avoidance brought on immense anxiety which only made me drink more. There were multiple days at a time during the span of my addiction where I chose alcohol over food, even though I had food readily available. Mind you, this whole time, I held down a corporate 9-5 and lived in Downtown Chicago (shoutout to Streeterville). By the end of December 2024, I was in a 1000 calorie deficit/per day and tracking all of my calories via Carb Manager. My meals were pretty simple, breakfast consisted of eggs and beef sausages, lunches were always 85/15 ground turkey and dinners were a combination of healthy nuts with 90/10 ground beef. I averaged 1800 calories per day during the December 2024 - end of April 2025 timeframe. I went from 215LB on November 175th to 163lb as of this post, today. I most recently had bloodwork taken in February and my total cholesterol dropped down to 170 mg/dL (range is 0-199) and my triglycerides have dropped to 145 mg/dL (range is 0-150). As one could imagine, not only was I dropping weight and having better bloodwork, but I was feeling amazing and could not believe how much damage my body took and how it was actually able to bounce back. Nothing fits anymore.

As you can tell by my mileages above, I *really* got into running as a healthy addition to my sobriety (along with having a psychiatrist and going to Alcoholics Anonymous twice a week). I had no idea if I’d ever race, but, in February a coworker had suggested that I sign up for the JP Morgan Chase Corporate Challenge 5K and I figured, why not? I had 10 weeks to get in a training block and I have coworkers that are extremely supportive and have run it every year. I started a 10 week training block with Garmin Coaching and I finally got in the speed-work that I had been avoiding during the first four months of returning to running. By the time I had started the 10 week training block, I was able to comfortably run up to 10 miles at a pace of 10:30 min/mi in Zone 2 with a HR range of 130-152 bpm. I was able to knock a few PR’s that I was really happy with at the end of this 10 week block, including a 5:55 min/mile and a 5K time of 27:20. I noticed that runs weren't necessarily easier but they felt easier. My pace would drop alongside my heartrate so I was getting faster and faster.

This block consisted of the following workouts per week;

Sunday (base): 1 mile WU, 5 mile base run, 1 mile CD  
Monday(threshold) : 1 mile WU, 20-40 min threshold, 1 mile CD  
Tuesday(rest): Active Rest Day (usually golfed a local 9 hole course or went to the driving range)  
Wednesday(V02 max): 1 mile WU, 10x 0.5 mile sprints at 177+ HR), 1 mile CD  
Thursday(base): 1 mile WU, 5 mile base run, 1 mile CD  
Friday(base): 1 mile WU, 8-10 mile base run, 1 mile CD  
Saturday(long run): 10-15 mile base run

I averaged around 35-40 miles per week with this training block and peaked at 47 miles. I cut out my calorie deficit in the last three weeks of the training block because I had already hit a weight that I was very happy with (170LB) and lesson learned, I was recovering much quicker due to eating maintenance calories. One week prior to my 5K, I PR’d my mile time and hit 5:55 min/mile. I was ecstatic and had never run this fast before, even during my teen years when I was a skinny 140 LB kiddo. I knew that I wouldn’t be able to keep up this pace in the 5K but I knew that I could probably pull off 7:45-8:00 min/miles as long as I tapered correctly and didn’t let the adrenaline consume me before the race. 

**Pre-race**

T-1 day. The anxiety is already setting in and my resting heart rate has gone from an average of 45bpm to 70bpm. During my last taper run, I tried imagining myself running with a crowd and I had a huge adrenaline dump and my HR went from 150bpm to 170bpm without increasing pace or effort. I knew that I had to accept the fact that no matter what happened during the race, I already came so FAR and if I decide to walk during the race, so be it.

Day of race. I drove into work (Downtown Chicago) because I really did not want to spend over an hour in the train going back to the suburbs when I know I could drive back home in about 30 minutes. Felt pretty anxious all day but still managed to keep my routine. Had an easy breakfast with coffee and then had a chicken salad for lunch. Luckily the race was at 6:50PM which is near the time I usually go for runs so I was able to not divert too much away from the usual day. The end of the work day was spent with colleagues stopping by to wish me luck and telling me how happy they were to see me get ready for my first race.

The race was at 6:50pm so at 5:00pm, I changed into my REI half tights, pinned my bib to the awesome t-shirt provided by my company (I remember thinking this can’t be happening right now), put on my Vaporfly 3’s and headed to my car to drop off my work clothes. Once I dropped everything off, I headed to Grant Park to find my companies tent. “It’s cold” I thought as I walked to Grant Park. “I can’t wait to run so I can just get warm already”. I walked leisurely to Grant Park (about a 15 minute walk from where I work) but my heart rate was already coasting around 130bpm and I knew I needed to just relax once I found the tent. Tent found, dropped off my stuff and chatted with some colleagues who have been lifetime runners. Excited, nervous, cold. I looked down at my green bib on my shirt and started making my way to the “green corral”. I was shocked at how many people there were. 

**Race**

Red corral just took off and I’m finding that my heart rate has dropped to around 80bpm right before we start. I tell myself “hey, it’s just another run. Remember to push it”. The horn sounds and we go. It takes about 5 seconds between the sound of the horn and for the people directly in front of me (couple hundred people probably) to start moving. I hit “start” on my watch and the timer begins. Holy shit people are running FAST. I am pushing it and I am being passed as if I were moving 3mph. I don’t know much but I know that I don’t want to cook myself in the first mile and then crash out. It IS a 3.5 mile race but I was really focused on my 5K time because I had a PR that I wanted to break. “it’s so cold” and variations of that thought are what I am thinking about during the first half mile. 

One mile, 7:07 pace. I quickly glance down at my watch and I am surpassing the splits I thought I would have. “Am I going too fast?”. 1.5 miles in and I seriously consider stopping. My lungs are burning, the transition from being cold and shivering to sweating and running feels really weird. A loud crowd of runners suddenly turned into laser sharp focus, nothing but footsteps, heavy breathing and the occasional sound of a crowd cheering us on. About 2 miles in, we go under a bridge and the temp goes from 45F to probably 60F. “Oh wow, that feels amazing”. I think about stopping again but I have too much momentum, quitting is absolutely not an option at this point unless I feel that I am going to be injured. 

2 miles, pace 7:37. “Okay, I’ve definitely slowed a bit but still doing good. I turn my music off because the sound of thousands of footsteps is so cool. This is not an every day thing and I don’t get to experience this during my solo training runs. During this mile, we’re passing on a portion of lower wacker drive and I can see the building I used live in during my time in Streeterville. I take a brief second to think about all of the physical falls I had in that apartment - from being absolutely wasted, to the daily dry-heaves before I left the apartment.

3 miles, pace 6:02: Not much thinking going on at this point of the race. Making sure I continue breathing and don’t trip over anyone. I pass up a lot of people and it. feels. good. “Half a mile. Half a mile. Half a mile. Half a mile left” is the only thought I had until I hit 3.1 miles and **PR’d from 21:47 to 21:25**. I’m ecstatic that I hit a PR, followed up with being mad that someone decided this race should be 3.**5** miles. 

3.5 miles; Official Time: 28:06.

**Post-race**

I cross the finish line, grab a water and head to the company tent. My faster colleagues were already grabbing a snack as I was walking into the tent. My buddy PR’d his 5K, with a time of 16:28. We celebrate and quickly start shivering due to being sweaty and the temp now having dropped even more as the sun went down. Cold is the keyword of the day. I feel nauseous and at one point I contemplate excusing myself to go see if I’ll throw up. Luckily, I didn’t throw up. As everyone is getting ready to leave and head to a bar that our company had rented out, I start the 15 minute walk back to my car to drive home.

A few lessons learned.

1. Moving forward, I will not be in a calorie deficit while in a training block. Recovery is slowed and injury risk rises. 
2. Racing has me hooked. 
3. I’m proud of myself for not leaving any gas in the tank (especially when it came to that last mile).
4. I need to pace myself better. I feel like running my 2nd mile at 7:37 and then running my last mile at 6:02 shows that I have improvement to make when it comes to pacing. I spent minimal time looking at my watch and tried my best to run by effort however it’s pretty clear that I cooked a bit too much in my first mile.

I just bought “Daniels Running Formula” and I’m hoping to start another 5K Training block in the next few days. Not 100% sure where I’ll go from here but I know I want to race again, and soon. 

Hopefully this was an interesting read for some of you. To those that have/are struggling with addiction, you are not alone. Life is so much better without drugs/alcohol. For every 1 “fun” alcohol story, I have 100 stories of struggling and not having a good time. I know that I am a much better person when I am sober, for myself and those around me.

I wake up every morning with the same mantra; I don’t know if I’ll be sober tomorrow, but I’ll do everything I can to stay sober today. 

Cheers.

However, at a reunion panel during 2025 Awesome Con, Sean Astin said, ""I was sort of offended that they had that idea, that they wouldn't let the kids see the pirate ship, so that they could capture their real reaction. Like, what? We don't know how to do real? We did real reactions all the time. But I remember wanting to perform in such a way, because I had had a sneak peek of it. So I wanted to perform in a way that really made them think that they had captured the honest reactions, so they would for 40 years be like, 'Oh, we got these kids to do this thing!'""](https://www.buzzfeed.com/noradominick/ke-huy-quan-goonies-oscars-playing-with-puppies)

You can't really get, you know, into a good book or anything 'cause you don't know when they're gonna call you. So, on the set, I would watch everybody, because this was all about women in the workplace. And part of my deal with Jane Fonda, if I was in the movie, that I would get a chance to right the theme song. So, I didn't have a chance to get my guitar, go back to the trailer all the time, so I would just kinda roam around on the set watching everything that was going on. And I would take my nails because with the acrylic nails, it makes, like, a percussive sound...""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A--OfgitbAA)

Director Steven Spielberg told Entertainment Tonight, ""I wasn't in direct communication with M&Ms. I simply made the request. It was M&Ms in the screenplay.""

Steven continued, ""I was just told that we weren't given permission to use M&Ms, so I said, 'Well, what's my next favorite candy?'

11. [Per Digital Spy, the Die Hard producers were contractually obligated to offer the leading role to Frank Sinatra, who was 70 at the time, before any other actors could be considered. The offer had to be made because he starred in the 1966 film The Detective, which was based on the book that preceded Nothing Lasts Forever. Die Hard was adapted from Nothing Lasts Forever, making it a loose sequel to The Detective. However, the singer turned it down — as did Clint Eastwood, Sylvestor Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Richard Gere, James Caan, and Mel Gibson.

Just pick a rack.'…And then I thought of an idea of teeth and I thought of an idea of a walk, and I knew it had been there.

We took a fictional character and put him in a new light. What if it wasn’t all goodness and there was some evil intent? Warner Bros paid us $375,000 for the script. About a year later, we had a meeting with [original director, later executive producer] Richard Donner about rewrites.

I always understood myself as straight — I had serious and long relationships with cis women — but, over time, I realized that the experiences that really touched me the most were with trans women.
There is something different there... something that makes me vibrate, that moves me in a deeper, more affective way. It's not just physical attraction — it's connection. And this made me question a lot of things, especially coming from a conservative environment, where the fear of judgment (from others and myself) was always present.
Today, I am in the process of understanding and accepting this more calmly, seeking to talk to people who can listen to me without judgment, with empathy. I'm not looking for a fetish, or something shallow — I want to live something more truthful, without so much guilt involved.

About me: I like history, curious about other cultures. Enjoy nature, mountains, sunsets, beach, campsites and strong coffee. I'm a fan of films, series, books, podcasts and games.

I have a young Kentucky Coffee tree planted by the City in the sidewalk outside of my house. It has holes in the base of the trunk and that section feels a bit squishy. Up top the tree appears to be thriving, with lots of new growth.
