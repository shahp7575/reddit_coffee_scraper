","Hi everyone,

I'm trying to decide where to stay in Tokyo and would love some advice. After doing some research, I‚Äôm leaning toward Ueno and Shinjuku. I'm also considering splitting my stay into two areas: starting with Ueno for the first 4 nights and then moving to Shinjuku for the weekend.

I have many activities/places on my list. My main priorities are convenience for traveling around Tokyo, easy access to public transport, and getting to and from Narita Airport. I want to have the best overall experience, I enjoy walking around, shopping, exploring street food, coffee shops, and lively streets both day and night. Nightlife is a bonus too.

Does splitting the stay between these two areas make sense, or would you recommend sticking to just one? Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",1,1731773295.0,JapanTravelTips,0,1.0,False

Below there is some context to my questions, but in short:

To what extent are you researching and/or developing new models/trading strategies as opposed to implementing existing ones on new assets or doing other more process-related tasks like, e.g., data handling/exploration?

How mathematical is your job (does the content transcend, e.g., MSc level mathematics)?

Some context to these questions:

I have been working in risk management at a large financial insititution in Europe for a short period of time and am underwhelmed with the ""challenges"". Due to standardizations and regulations, all risk models boil down to basic linear regressions. Even though I work along other mathematicians (even with PhDs), our work consists mostly of data handling/exploration and reading/writing model documentation. From time to time, I am allowed to do some research on (the optimization of) models/tests diving deep into subjects familiar to what I learned during my MSc applied (financial) mathematics. I am looking for a role allowing me perform this kind of research most of the time. For these reasons and to give some more perspective, I am also considering a PhD, but in a different field, partly because there are (almost) no PhD positions on financial mathematics.",2,1731773116.0,highfreqtrading,0,1.0,False

Ive been in this position at other jobs before so I am quite familiar with the behaviour support services field as this isnt anything new to me. 

My boss (the psychologist) refuses to train me. She says she has no time for it and she doesnt know how to. Shes is completely unbareable to work with. She has unrealistic expectations on our client‚Äôs abilities and on staff such as my self. She demands so much from me but doesnt want to show me how to do it. Pretty much everything i have done so far was self taught, but even that is good enough for her. I have sent emails, and texts stating that I do not feel supported and need more training but she has done nothing about it. In fact she says, ‚ÄúI know my job, so I cant train you on your job. you need to figure that out with someone else.‚Äù 

During our clinical meetings, she over looks my opinions and ideas. When she does throw away my ideas and suggestions, SOMEHOW shit blows up in her face but then passes my ideas as hers when im not around. 
She wants me to send a VERY detailed summary of my day with time stamps so she can know what im working on and if i need more work to do, but when i actually do need more work to do, she says she cant help me. 

She talks down on the front line staff that work directly with our clients as if theyre peasants. Im very compassionate and have been promoted from the direct support worker position so I know all about the hard work they do. I always try to help them out when i can and buy coffee and food for them to show my appreciation. I literally got into trouble for it. 
Im always advocating the staff to make sure they feel comfortable, supported and have the training they need because our clients have aggressive behaviours. She says im ‚Äúbabying the staff‚Äù and they need to figure it out on their own. 

The company has a 2 star rating online with an insanely high turnover rate. You can imagine how many people in different positions feel the way i do. This just a wake up call that i need to check online before accepting jobs üò≠lol 

Im so frustrated because i feel like the expectations arent clear and unrealistic. I want to leave but I feel alot of guilt. Its very challenging to land a full time job these days and i dont know how long i can take of this madness.

One evening as I walked home from a coffee shop job, two men attacked me from behind. Hair pulling, punching my face and kneeing me in the head to break my nose, almost passing out, and I didn't fight back as I can't. 

I didn't have much to steal, an ipod back then or my own self, I feared for the worst. 

Since that day, there have been other circumstances such as the person I had started a relationship with went and desired sex and cheated. My christian friends moved on and didn't include me in a new house. My job role ended as COVID made me redundant. 

Today I have to care for my mother with multiple scelrosis and have been under/unemployed for years regardless of thousands of applications. I have been unable to date as no income. Live in childhood bedroom. Often lie on the floor as body in pain, and am exhausted from being alive.

On the night I was attacked, I lay on the road.

I don't feel like I've ever got up again.

No one helped. I was left to handle life alone.

Why does God walk by every time I struggle.

Is he a hypocrite, asking us to stop to help others when he doesn't?

I can't help as I need help.

For years.

God walked by then, and kept walking.

I am looking for the best beginner setup as someone who wants to venture into the espresso making world. 

  
Drink: I mainly drink one milk based drink and one-two espresso a day. I do have friends/family that visit that enjoy straight espresso, but I will be mainly using this machine for myself most days.  I usually prefer medium-dark roasts although I'd like to start using light roasts at some point if i'm able to pull a shot that's not sour. 

  
I am looking for a machine with a speedy warm up. 

  
After reading through the sub, I initially was looking into obtaining an excellent grinder with a basic introductory machine such as a Timemore 064S paired with a bambino plus, but I've seen a lot of negative post recently regarding the longevity of the Bambino and its consistency. Next, I looked into the Ascaso Steel DUO PID, but I don't have 20AMP capability.  Truthfully, seattle coffee gear rates a lot of these machines at  Intermediate level.I don't want a machine that I will need to tinker with the insides often and can come with a maintenance plan

1gsq5ia,https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/1gsq5ia/never_felt_like_these_my_whole_life_long_distance/,Never felt like these my whole life long distance relationship ,"I love my partner too much we have been in a long distance relationship for a year and a month ago he came to see me when I saw him I didn‚Äôt feel butterflies or nerves but I felt at home and at peace. I felt like I already knew him. When my boyfriend cries I can‚Äôt help crying and when he is sick or when I remember moments of suffering from him I cry just as much. When he gave me my first kiss I will never forget it was at the skating rink it was my first kiss and it was wonderful after the first kiss I could not stop I wanted to kiss him more and more. When he kissed me I felt how wet I got. I wanted to hug him and never let go when he left it was hard but I knew I would see him again. My family said a lot of negative things but I didn‚Äôt let him and I defended him. With him I have told him my biggest secrets and there is nothing I can‚Äôt tell him. I write him poems and songs.

For the first time in my life I felt jealousy a day ago and it was a very strange thing for me. I with him did what I said I would not do and that was to have a moment in the movies me and him it was risky but it was wonderful. I cried and looked him in the eyes and hugged him. I told him to forgive me for having doubts whether I loved him or not and he hugged me and looking into my eyes he told me that nothing was wrong that he knew I loved him and I told him how do you know and he said I see it in your eyes. When he left it hurt too much and I cried a lot waiting for him to come back. I was sad that I could not be with him again on Saturday.

I remembered the moments when we went to eat tacos and he got his hands dirty and I cleaned them, when we ordered those pistachio and triple chocolate ice creams and he didn‚Äôt like the pistachio and I tried to take away the pistachio flavor and give him only chocolate. I remembered when I gave him food in his mouth, kissed him, hugged him and how my smile was big and intact. I am not a person who smiles a lot but with him it was impossible not to smile. I felt like taking his hand and never let go. I love to admire him when he is doing something I try to memorize every corner of his face as a work of art. I love when our eyes meet and we smile at each other and he tells me ? and laughs and I swim and laugh. I can‚Äôt help but think of him most of the time and always when I pass places I know he likes I say so. When he graduated I wish I could have been there even if I wasn‚Äôt there watching him grab his hard earned degree made me cry. Sometimes I have feelings in my heart that I don‚Äôt know how to explain.

This is my first relationship and it will be my only one. Sometimes I feel something warm in my heart that comes and goes. If I could make one wish it would be to be together forever and ever. There is nothing I wouldn‚Äôt do for him even if it was giving my life or taking a bullet for him. I know that many people say that a Capricorn is cold and unfeeling but I feel that when we fall in love we are totally devoted to this love we feel. I know his favorite food, I know his favorite snack, I know how he likes his coffee and the brand of coffee he likes. I will never forget Nestl√© dolce coffee. I dream of a white house with flowers and peace. Me and him together living our life next to each other and the other with two children a beautiful and cute family. I don‚Äôt know anyone‚Äôs birthday but my siblings, my own and a cousin. However, I don‚Äôt forget his day. I had doubts at the beginning if what I felt was love or if I was in love with him in the end I think it was just my fears because he only needs to take my heart and give it to him. There is nothing I would not do for him and there is nothing I want in this life if it is not with him.",0,1731772375.0,love,1,0.5,False

1gsq4ti,https://www.reddit.com/r/taiwan/comments/1gsq4ti/has_louisa_gotten_way_worse_or_maybe_im_just_more/,Has Louisa gotten way worse? Or maybe I'm just more in tune with how bad it has always been...,"I moved to Taipei 6 years ago. I remember around that time Louisa being an okay place to go and chill or study or whatever. It was clean and efficient and the employees were relatively fine and the food and drinks were decent for the price. It wasn't gonna win any awards, but I feel like I pretty much knew what I was going to get regarding quality and vibe. 

Fast forward to now. I haven't spent a lot of time in Louisa'ses since COVID, but the few times I have gone, things seem really wrong. 

First of all, the employee (singular) seems really stressed and unhappy and wayyy to busy (the other workers having seem to have been replaced by touch screens). Garbages are not being emptied. Damaged furniture seems not being rehabbed or replaced. The sandwich I got was weird. The self-ordering didn't really work. They were out of ingredients. The app was clunky AF. 

Granted, I don't have a huge sample size, and maybe it's just the ones I've gone to are going downhill, but the times I've spent there hasn't made me want to go back. 

So, anyone know what's happening? Did it get bought by a private equity firm? Or was it always like this?  I'm really just curious because I remember reading it had surpassed Starbucks as the most popular coffee brand in Taiwan, and it seems like they could do better. ",3,1731772321.0,taiwan,4,1.0,False

Until this school year, I was the one that picked up our son from school after classes every day but since I started a new job my husband has to do it on fridays because I can't no longer make it in time. He was not happy about it and we had many arguments about the issue. He is always late to pick him up.

A month ago, it was friday morning and my husband had already left for work. I was going to take our son to school but he was sick so I let him stay home. I should have told my husband this so he wouldn't go to pick him up at the end of the day but I totally blanked.

My husband got home late that day and I just then realised and apologised for my mistake but he wasn't upset about it. He had apparently ""gone shopping"" and brought gifts for us. After a few weeks acting overly affectionate towards me, he confessed what had happened.

There is this teacher at our son's school named Janice (27F). Apparently she is the one that always waits with our son when my husband is late to pick him up on fridays. So, when he arrived that friday and was told that our son wasn't there, he invited Janice to go have a coffee to thank her for all those times she had to wait. One thing lead to another and they had sex in his car.

I was beyond shocked by this. My husband told me he never felt so bad about anything in his life. He swore it didn't mean anything for him and begged me not to leave him. I honestly was out of words. I ask him to leave our house and he has been staying with his brother. I don't know what I am going to do. He wants to try couples' counseling but I feel it would be too humiliating for me. I am not sure if I am ready for divorce either.

This week, I finally built up enough courage to go talk to Janice. She apologised profusely in a way that felt very real. She told me that my husband had lie to her and said we were divorced. She started crying and promised me she would never have done it otherwise. I honestly belived her and felt so bad for her. We even hugged. That conversation really made me feel better about the whole thing.

I confronted my husband about it but he told me it was her that was lying. He said she perfecly knew he was married and that he could prove it. He had apparently recorded the whole sexual encounter in his car with his phone. You couldn't see everything that well but you could listen perfectly. He showed me an exchange they had after finishing sex. He tells her ""I need to convince my wife that I was out shopping"". She chuckles and says ""Good luck"".

Should I go confont her again? She lying about it to my face was so sleazy. It makes me feel like an idiot for believing her. My husband says we should change our son to another school and just leave Janice alone. He says she doesn't matter and we should just focus on fixing our marriage.",10,1731771843.0,AITAH,22,0.81,False

I'm having quite hard time keeping my cadence up for this faaaaast moving, quick-changing and extremely impersonal world, so therefore I've realized that apps are not my thing.. I can actually explain more about myself here. So yeah, let's give this a chance :))

I'd say I'm a funny, energetic ,sarcastic and yet chill, calm and somewhat depressive type of guy . I care about my looks, I know what I want from life, partner, work .. anything.. I have my matters in order. I know this sounds very disciplined and rigid but I have sooo much leeway for anything and everything.

I like to spend my time with loads of stuff like, having a pint with friends every now and then, going to gym 3 times a week, playing games, watching movies/series, playing guitar, reading books, lying down on the rug watching the ceiling while listening to Pink Floyd.. Idk there's loads of stuff :D

I also enjoy deep chats, philosophy and endless banter especially no-holds-barred type of banters are fun.. honestly any no-holds convo can turn into something funny LOL :D

Maybe we can walk in the parks holding hands talking about the movie we watched yesterday and about the characters ? We can read poets to each other and maybe learn different things every other day and share them? We can prank each other , come up with weird jokes to see the reaction :D .. all those lovely stuff.. live in a wee village and have late nite drives together ? We can go for an ice-cream at 3 am and settle for a terrible garage coffee LOL ..

I'd say I'm quite caring, protective, solution-oriented, open to communicate and more than anything straightforward guy .. but as you might've guessed already those just doesn't come from the day one.. feelings are feelings because we can't control them , right ?

What I'm looking for ?

I'd say someone who has her life in somewhat order , who's in touch with her emotions, who's honest or should I say blunt (in a nice way :D ) , who's loyal and who's curious about things in life.. who knows what she wants.

I'd say I'm an ambivert so I like going out for gigs, stand-ups, pints with peeps, but also love to have a coz night in so would prefer someone who'd be okay with this kind of cadence.

Things I think could be deal-breaker for some people:

\- I'm Atheist. But I do respect to religions as long as the respect is mutual and it's not your total personality

\- Got 4 tattoos.

Other stuff :

188cm (6 2 )tall , 90 kg (200 pounds) , fit but no abs LOL \*crying in distance\* , green eyes, caucasian, brown hair, beard and moustache

1gspu7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/neurodiversity/comments/1gspu7y/am_i_neurodivergent/,Am I neurodivergent?,"Hello! I don't know how to start this post... it just feels scary to talk about it as I've been repressing my concerns for years. Y'all are probably sick of these types of posts as well but I have no one else to ask. So here it goes...

The title says it all. A family member of mine was diagnosed with ADHD which came as a huge surprise, as they were really good at ""masking"" their symptoms (sorry if the terms are wrong, I'm happy to be educated by the community about their use). This event basically made me revisit some questions about myself.

I'm currently 23 but I've always felt like something was... off with me. My childhood felt average but I remember always having these ""quirks"" others couldn't relate to a complete level.

- I am very sensitive to certain textures. Like seatbelts touching a car seat (I hate the sound and feel), certain clothing make me want to explode, or foods that taste good but feel awful to eat cause of the texture, things getting stuck on my nails, etc.
- I hate layered clothing. Like wearing an undershirt, certain underwear, socks, whatever. They make me feel like my circulation is blocked even though that's far from true.
- I love routines, lists and such, straying from them gives me anxiety. When I'm stressed, I often also make lists to calm down.
- I have ""childish"" interests that live in my head for months sometimes. They sound to me like these ""hyperfixiations"" people talk about. Example (but there's been many other instances): I re-watch MLP, obsess over the story and characters, think about the things I like or dislike, how I'd redesign things as an artist, etc. After a few months, I toss the interest in the ""later"" pile and find something else, until that same interest comes back.
- I suck at sarcasm. Both at reading and practicing it.
- I had to teach myself certain social interactions cause others were doing them. Like eye contact, it's so uncomfortable, but I do it.
- It's often hard for me to calm my thoughts down. I feel my my brain is always on 100 km/h with so many things going on at once.
- I often focus on a lot of things at once and have trouble tuning background events out. Example, I go on a coffee with friends and hear every guest conversation, every dog bark, a certain smell that bothers me, air temperature, etc. and it's so exhausting cause I just wanna chill with my buddies.
- I have severe social anxiety and have struggled with depressive episodes since I was 14.
- I don't miss people when they're not with me. But when we meet again, I'm overwhemed with joy and realise that I did miss them. It feels terrible cause I always have to lie that I did miss them... am I just a bad person?
- I often shut down my emotions if something traumatic happens. It's also best for me to be completely alone when coping.
- I hate loud noises. As a metalhead, that's especially hard cause I can't go on concerts without getting a panic attack.
- My spacial awareness is awful. I'm also clumsy.
- I often experience the so-called ""brainfog"" (but that could be my fibromyalgia).
- My mood is often neutral/numb or an extreme version of any emotion. It feels like a swing sometimes.

There's probably more that I just can't recall at the moment. Feel free to ask me though!

Only once have I talked about my issues and was told I'm overrracting. Am I? Please tell me... Cause to me, it feels like my ""quirks"" are being brushed off because of my so-called ""pretty privilage"" (people say I'm good-looking) and being skilled at this ""masking"" thing. It usually takes a lot of my energy to just appear ""normal"", not to mention that going outside my safe space (a.k.a. home) just drains me so so much...

There are a few things that make me question if I'm neurodivergent:
- I, apperently, have really high IQ... that doesn't really matter in this instance. However, it's also my EQ that's high. I was told that reading people well is not an autistic trait.
- I am very organised and on-time. Not sure if that's relevant though, maybe regarding ADHD?
- Someone said I'm too ""high-functioning"" to be autistic. Dunno what that means, I'd love to know.

I'm from the Balkans, so these things aren't really talked about or are even frowned upon. My education on neurodivergence is close to none, and all of my ""knowledge"" was obtained on the internet. So, I'm sorry if there's anything offensive in the things I've wrote here, I promise that is not my intention. I'm just confused and want some ideas on what's going on with me. Not looking for an actual diagnosis, of course.

Take her to the guest room and we FT mom while I clean up the bed. Get in bed with her and tell her I have a bag if she has to throw up. She passes out. 

The rest of the night, she threw up four more times. But, each time, she would nudge me and say, ‚ÄúDad, I‚Äôm ready to throw up.‚Äù

Gave me time to grab the bag and generally kept the bed clean. I don‚Äôt think I had that kind of self-control at her age. Or presence of mind.

Would some of you more experienced with bokashi kindly help me understand if this method will help reduce the smell of my small composts contained in 19 gallon HotFrog tumblers?

TLDR: my current compost in too-small tumblers smells like fresh, human poo and I wonder if bokashi would help mitigate this without changing anything else.

Here's the longish-backstory:  
I live alone in suburbia, have very little actual ground/yard space, and became enamored with the idea of turning the yard clippings, vege scraps, and spent coffee into compost to use in the ground and possibly amend my rain-gutter-bucket system.  Researching various options, I decided vermicomposting was not for me, and since I didn't have space for an actual compost pile, thought I could see if a smallish tumbler would work.  I didn't worry about brown/green ratio and initially had much success (smelled and looked great!). 

Later I rescued a couple stupid little parakeets and incorporated their waste (blank newsprint with their poop, feathers, bird kibble, all finely shredded) into the compost, but I couldn't tend to the small garden much due to time so very few actual garden clippings went in - but veges and coffee remained the same.  Now all my compost attempts have been ""failures"" -- they are sludgy and all smell like fresh, human poo.  Not that rank raw sewage smell, but a fresh pile of steaming, solid poo from a human that ate too much protein the night before.  The amount of shredded newsprint that goes in is considerable, so I figured this was sufficient brown, but evidently not...?

Bokashi is interesting.. perhaps composting fermented product would reduce the smell?  I know ideally one should bury bokashi in the ground, however, we have possums and coyotes in the neighborhood and I'm concerned they would dig up the goods, so my thinking is to bokashi ferment then transfer to the compost tumbler.

Will this help me reduce/mitigate the poo smell?  I don't really know what else to do, and currently I'm not sure how to change the ratios (no, I'm not buying wood pellets or collecting leaves from the street , there are pesticides and herbicides used and I don't trust the small pile compost to remove these).  Also, and again, no space for a normal compost pile, and I'm not prepared for vermicomposting yet (though it's probably the best solution to this, I do not want to do it now).  It's possible I shouldn't even be composting, but it should be fun :p

I'm having quite hard time keeping my cadence up for this faaaaast moving, quick-changing and extremely transactional world, so therefore I've realized that apps are not my thing.. I can actually explain more about myself here. So yeah, let's give this a chance :))

I'd say I'm a funny, energetic ,sarcastic and yet chill, calm and somewhat depressive type of guy . I care about my looks, I know what I want from life, partner, work .. anything.. I have my matters in order. I know this sounds very disciplined and rigid but I have sooo much leeway for anything and everything.

I like to spend my time with loads of stuff like, having a pint with friends every now and then, going to gym 3 times a week, playing games, watching movies/series, playing guitar, reading books, lying down on the rug watching the ceiling while listening to Pink Floyd.. Idk there's loads of stuff :D

I also enjoy deep chats, philosophy and endless banter especially no-holds-barred type of banters are fun.. honestly any no-holds convo can turn into something funny LOL :D

Maybe we can walk in the parks holding hands talking about the movie we watched yesterday and about the characters ? We can read poets to each other and maybe learn different things every other day and share them? We can prank each other , come up with weird jokes to see the reaction :D .. all those lovely stuff.. live in a wee village and have late nite drives together ? We can go for an ice-cream at 3 am and settle for a terrible garage coffee LOL ..

I'd say I'm quite caring, protective, solution-oriented, open to communicate and more than anything straightforward guy .. but as you might've guessed already those just doesn't come from the day one.. feelings are feelings because we can't control them , right ?

What I'm looking for ?

I'd say someone who has her life in somewhat order , who's in touch with her emotions, who's honest or should I say blunt (in a nice way :D ) , who's loyal and who's curious about things in life.. who knows what she wants.

I'd say I'm an ambivert so I like going out for gigs, stand-ups, pints with peeps, but also love to have a coz night in so would prefer someone who'd be okay with this kind of cadence.

Things I think could be deal-breaker for some people:

\- I'm Atheist. But I do respect to religions as long as the respect is mutual and it's not your total personality

I am a 30-something midwesterner searching for my forever person. I am quiet, empathetic, introverted, intelligent, and kind. But once I am comfortable with someone you will forget how quiet I am. I love deep conversations about life and philosophy. I‚Äôm a big fan of foreign films (Ingmar Bergman is one of my favorite filmmakers. I guess god‚Äôs silence just resonates with me). I love going to art museums and pretending to know something about art. I enjoy reading (I‚Äôm especially a fan of Russian literature). And I love listening to music. I‚Äôm drawn to bands like Bright Eyes, the National, the Mountain Goats, Okkervil River, and Father John Misty, to name a few. 

I‚Äôm tall and I have an average build. Brown hair and green eyes. I stay active by taking long walks. These also help me clear my mind. I‚Äôve been told I look like Garrison Keillor (I‚Äôve been told I sometimes write like him too). 

I‚Äôm looking for someone who has similar interests. Who loves deep conversations, coffee, long walks, and books. I can be a bit intense at times. Admittedly, I may over idealize love sometimes, and well, everything else too. I‚Äôm looking for someone who shows me the real thing is better than the version in my head.

If anything I said strikes a chord in you please reach out. I would love to hear from you. I am looking for a friendship that could turn into something more with the right person. But I‚Äôm always happy making platonic friends too. My apologies in advance if it takes me time to reply. I hope everyone finds who they are looking for. I know how painful this whole process can be.

Thanks to all who helped me wait and prepare.  I have lost and gained about 100 pounds 3 -4 times in lifetime, and got into exercising. 

 In last 5 years, I stopped eating gluten and dairy to try and help inflammation, MS.  I lost 30 pounds from these changes. I felt relatively ok, and had no interest in losing weight.    But this past year, my ability to exercise has diminished as I gained some weight back and arthritis kicked in.   So, 2 months ago I decided to lose weight.  

I decided I wanted to count calories until I get used to eating this way and it can be more intuitive. I am tracking on my fitness Pal.  I was prepared yesterday with 100 ounce water bottle.  Coffee, shake in am: 1/2 cup cottage cheese a couple of hours later, and a lot of water.  Then I took the shot.  

Then I waited to see how I felt.  I felt something I thought was hunger.  But I don't know.  I think it is just what you feel when you digest food. I had tofu and stir fry veggies for dinner.      I am night time eater.  I made it through evening wth 20 almonds and an apple.

This is an amazing change.  But I entered all the food and my fitness pal said I went over my calories (77 grams of protein)

Bam--I am on a diet.  I ate 1300 calories instead of 1200.  It tells me I will lose weight more slowly.  What happened?  All of a sudden I am on a diet.   What happened?  I am uncomfortable.

Maybe my title caught your eye, I'm kinda new to this whole r4r thing but I figured I'd give it a shot!!

I'm a busy college student in southern Ohio, feeling pretty lonely and just overall seeking a really good connection with someone! Like, REALLY good connection, I'm practically trying to find myself in another person :'D

I'm ultimately looking for my bestfriend, my ride or die, someone that just absolutely gets me, and I get them, you know?

Anywayyyy, here's a bit about myself!:

I'm a trans guy, I've been on testosterone for almost 4 years now and had top surgery! I'm also queer! I'm short, and I like to dress in an 80's / granola boy aesthetic! 

I'm really into nature, like REALLY into nature. I've kinda struggled with religion my whole life, but recently I've been connecting more with the fact that I have a strong connection to nature and everything in the universe, which maybe sounds dumb? But nature really gives me a lot of comfort, and I feel connected to everything which is so great- but also it HURTS to see how badly our planet is being treated :') I'm really passionate about the climate crisis and environmental protection!

People say I've got golden retriver energy, I get hyper and really excited sometimes, I love going on walks, receiving affection, and I also say the most random stuff, like I have no filter, but I've been told I'm funny because of it :3

I do have ADHD which makes me extra silly, and I also have anxiety that I manage pretty well :D

Some things I like are: drinking tea every morning with my breakfast, procrastinating school stuff by taking a nap on occasion, the journey across campus for a sweet treat, autumn, rustic/nature/cabin aesthetics, listening to music 24/7 to make the world around me much less scary, anddddd getting attention!

Okay sorry LOL some more conventional things I like are going on walks/hikes, video games, shows/movies (currently watching Beastars!), reading, Wikipedia rabbit holes, true crime (like the interviews on the YT channel EXPLORE WITH US), pinterest, anddd recently I've started getting into pokemon cards! :3 I currently just open virtual packs using Pok√©mon TCG Pocket because I'm broke currently LMFAO but I want to start collecting physical cards very soon >:3

Also, you could also say I'm a furry I guess? I mostly just like the art and silly little fursona drawings, and I chronically use :3 

I don't really want kids, and I dream of one day living in either Oregon or Washington, just somewhere in a blue state where I can keep my rights lol and also be close to a lot of forests and nature to explore!! My dream home is something rustic and durable, while also owning land to grow my own vegetables and be self sustaining in this INSANE world- (maybe unrealistic goal? but that's what a dream home is for!) Also, I really want a golden retriever :D

Phew! If you've read all that and you're still here, here's what I'm looking for!

I'm basically looking for someone really similar to me who I can connect with, talk about literally anything with, text, call, hangout with, play video games, watch movies, explore nature, get coffee or food with, etc. literally whatever! I wanna mutually rant about climate change and the devastating political situation of the country and controversial topics that we both share the same opinions on and just all the stuff like that! 

Hopefully you'd be patient, sweet, funny, gentle, not insane, actually able to text and communicate properly as if it's a conversation instead of that really painful dry texting that feels like I'm texting a robot üò≠üò≠ also like.. I hope you smell really good and also like having a clean space, because I CANNOT deal with super messy or gross spaces or bad smells- I've got a really sensitive nose :'D

Aside from that, I figure the right person will just magically find me üôè (PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU)

SO! If you felt like you really related and connected with what I've written, send me a chat with an introduction of yourself and who you are as a person!! I'll be here :3",1,1731770563.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1gsphmp,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/1gsphmp/emotional_abuse/,Emotional abuse? ,"I started dating someone right after I came to live in United States. He seemed really nice, loving, affectionate etc. but he also had a side to himself. 

These are the examples of how he first started controlling the small things and then emotionally abusing but I‚Äôm not sure. 

I was a smoker when I met him- he knew it from the start. But after we started dating it became I don‚Äôt like it when you smoke coz I hate the smell. So I was like, okay, I won‚Äôt smoke around you. Then it became dont smoke, it‚Äôs not good for you. Then it become I cannot be with a smoker. 

We decided collectively that I will get an iud, in that my paps smear came positive for hpv the day I got my iud. So, I told him. While I was in a lot of pain. He started a conversation about how many partners have I had, why did I sleep around with so many people, how many people did I sleep with. And questioning if I was loyal to him even after we started dating. Which I was, all along.

Then it was mocking my family dynamics which is dysfunctional. Then mocking my lack of friends in the country and the friends I have had in the past which were predominantly men. Questions like - are you friends with guys coz they do things for you that girls won‚Äôt? In the lines of helping me move etc.

Telling me how I‚Äôm so reliant on him for everything and wouldn‚Äôt make it in the country without him, I make such little money that I won‚Äôt be able to survive in the city with this much. Ps, I dint take money from him for anything. And shared rent/grocery etc after I moved in 11 months after dating him. 

I used to cook and clean all the time while he would clean the house (one in two or three weeks, write the rent check, pay the utilities and take care of menial issues around the house). But it was still that I dint do enough. Cooking all the meals took a lot of my time and effort and cleaning after. Irrespective, I started helping him with those things as well because I was like it‚Äôs okay, if someone feels burdened, let me help. 

I‚Äôm a hyper sensitive person and if I would feel bad about something I would go in my shell for sometime (yes it wasn‚Äôt right, but I always avoid talking when I‚Äôm upset because I don‚Äôt want to say things that are hurtful). But those would become so big that it would end up with us wanting to break up because we cannot get through to each other. It came down to how I‚Äôm mentally unstable, moody and erratic while taking similar jabs at me that would hurt me and expecting me to not have a reaction because if I would I was erratic and need therapy. 

Last straw - I had a biometric appointment and he asked me two days prior if I got the printouts. I said no, he said that if I want him to get the printouts to send it to him right away since he wants to get it before anyone reaches work. I sent it. Cut to next morning, he asked me to make coffee for him (which I always do) I jokingly said we‚Äôll do our own work. To that he said that are you sure, means you‚Äôll get the printouts I sarcastically said yes. Which I understand could be misconstrued. I made the coffee, he drank the coffee. In the evening he came without the printouts and I felt bad - I have shingles and the email was just lying in his inbox. So I got the printouts and said that I felt bad that he dint and he needs to take accountability. Cut to - him mocking me for being in capable of doing anything without him and always relying on things for him and mocking my mental health that I need to see a therapist.

I feel like he is a nice guy who loves me and was affectionate, honest and loyal. But there was no scope for having a thought process that was different from his. He is always right. In my head I was flagging the green flags he had and underplaying the red. Not forgetting that he multiple times blamed me for cheating for no reason. Not saying I‚Äôm perfect. I can be a handful and stubborn but I always try to deal with my own issues without spilling it over the other person. I‚Äôm still confused if this is abuse and if I should breakup. 

He also said that I have had zero contributions to his life. He is inherently a very negative person and I would emotionally uplift him in my best capacity even when I felt that he was playing the victim card. He has also distanced himself from every friend because they somehow wronged him and did not treat him the way he deserved or wanted. Over time I have had multiple heartaches and felt unsupported and misunderstood. And belittled coz every small and big support or contribution was rubbed in my face. Even if I dint ask for help.

I'm having quite hard time keeping my cadence up for this faaaaast moving, quick-changing and extremely transactional world, so therefore I've realized that apps are not my thing.. I can actually explain more about myself here. So yeah, let's give this a chance :))

I'd say I'm a funny, energetic ,sarcastic and yet chill, calm and somewhat depressive type of guy . I care about my looks, I know what I want from life, partner, work .. anything.. I have my matters in order. I know this sounds very disciplined and rigid but I have sooo much leeway for anything and everything.

I like to spend my time with loads of stuff like, having a pint with friends every now and then, going to gym 3 times a week, playing games, watching movies/series, playing guitar, reading books, lying down on the rug watching the ceiling while listening to Pink Floyd.. Idk there's loads of stuff :D

I also enjoy deep chats, philosophy and endless banter especially no-holds-barred type of banters are fun.. honestly any no-holds convo can turn into something funny LOL :D

Maybe we can walk in the parks holding hands talking about the movie we watched yesterday and about the characters ? We can read poets to each other and maybe learn different things every other day and share them? We can prank each other , come up with weird jokes to see the reaction :D .. all those lovely stuff.. live in a wee village and have late nite drives together ? We can go for an ice-cream at 3 am and settle for a terrible garage coffee LOL ..

I'd say I'm quite caring, protective, solution-oriented, open to communicate and more than anything straightforward guy .. but as you might've guessed already those just doesn't come from the day one.. feelings are feelings because we can't control them , right ?

What I'm looking for ?

I'd say someone who has her life in somewhat order , who's in touch with her emotions, who's honest or should I say blunt (in a nice way :D ) , who's loyal and who's curious about things in life.. who knows what she wants.

I'd say I'm an ambivert so I like going out for gigs, stand-ups, pints with peeps, but also love to have a coz night in so would prefer someone who'd be okay with this kind of cadence.

Things I think could be deal-breaker for some people:

\- I'm Atheist. But I do respect to religions as long as the respect is mutual and it's not your total personality

\- Got 4 tattoos.

Other stuff :

188cm (6 2 )tall , 90 kg (200 pounds) , fit but no abs LOL \*crying in distance\* , green eyes, caucasian, brown hair, beard and moustache

I want to know if it was just my bias that rated this just above MID or if it was the majority experience.

Here are my grumpy points... 

I found so much of Nancy's dialogue to sound like AI, it threw me off. 

I played classic style point and click and that was a pain in the ass. Just play modern. It's a modern take, you might as well just accept its not going to feel like a classic (talking to myself mostly).

Definitely recommend Amateur, because senior detective I got stuck so many times. I did not find the next steps to be as intuitive as in other games. It got frustrating, and I did not find her notes to give many clues like in older games. I guess I could have taken more notes, like I used to, though.

I miss having the place to stay, the friends to call, and having to go there to make phone calls or receive mail or messages. It felt weird to be in Prague for a week with nowhere to stay. Another biased to classic games gripe..

The character development was okay, but I also miss the little details of getting to know the characters by things they leave behind on their desk, in their spaces, etc. There also used to be so much extra info, kind of like an escape room where only 5% of what you find is actually plot necessary but it adds to the ambiance and makes it feel so much more real. I think there was so much more love for the storytelling in the old ones. It was like immersing in that world. This felt like dipping toes in. It was fun to learn some Czech phrases, but we never had to use them or be tested. I just felt there was a lot of opportunities missed for little fun puzzles of this nature.

Making coffee was freaking complicated lol. I wish there were a few less recipes to learn and more opportunities to earn hints or story progression from serving the people. Also I wanted some disgruntled customers for wrong orders. Seems like a good way to stack on realism and gameplay hours since they already developed the whole mini game.

......... 

Overall I will always return to these games. As much as I b*tch about it I'm grateful they came out with another one and this one was certainly an improvement over MID. I'm just gonna keep wishing for a true return to the classics, time period included. Why not do a throwback at this point? Aren't most of the dedicated players from the OG squad? Do we really think this is attracting new players at this stage?

I promise I'm not a Karen lmao. Thanks for listening to me get this all off my chest. Sending love to this community. This is a place close to my heart. ALLLLL the beautiful  nostalgia lives here. ü•π",4,1731770086.0,nancydrew,0,1.0,False

To solve this, I have created [Handles](https://handles.club), which is a completely free (forever) service to get a personalized handle.

Are you an Alice who loves to travel? Then you could be \`@alice.loves.travel\` instead of \`@alice123.bsky.social\`! Are you a Paul with a great head of hair? Perhaps \`@paul.has.hair\` is the perfect handle for you. Do you write news, take flights, post pics, follow fitness, post travel or have fish? Then perhaps \`@redditor.takes.flights\`, \`@redditor.posts.pics\`, \`@redditor.follows.fitness\`, \`@redditor.posts.travel\` or \`@redditor.has.fish\` is the handle for you.

The process is simple at [Handles.club](https://handles.club):

1. Enter your name and pick from the list of handles
2. Update your handle in your Bluesky settings
3. Keep your new handle for as long as you like (or change it!)

We met for the 5th time 2 days ago. 
He asked me to meet last week, and he stayed in town just to meet me, his family is in another city and he usually drives home during the weekend. 
5 days ago he told me he wants to play chess, since last time we went out we couldn't play chess because we were outside and it was extremely cold, and in my city everything closes at 19 so we couldn't even sit in a coffee shop. I told him next time he can come over and we can play chess together in my place, as I have my own apartment. He agreed. 
2 days ago he came over, we played chess, talked, laid on my bed, and when it was 4 am already I told him he can sleep on my bed, I said I don't mind, since he lives really far and there was no public transportation at that time. 
So we slept on the same bed, we laid really close to each other but nothing happened, I didn't really want anything to happen as he just got out from a relationship and he is probably still thinking about his ex gf. 
Now I know that sharing the bed is something very intimate, this is why I m wondering if he thinks that I m offering something, as we ve only met 5 times before. 
Also he was the one to lay close to me the whole time and stare at my lips while I was talking, WHILE HE WAS LITERALLY 3 CM AWAY. So there was some tension. 
Now idk how to feel about this
Like idk how he perceived this whole situation, what does he think of me rn..

He was acting weird and ""melancholy"" after meeting her so our daughter asked about her and he told her about their tragic love story, which is literally just their parents being againts their relationship. My daughter, who was a hopeless romantic, was deeply moved by their love story and pushed his dad to pursue his ex and cheat on me. And well, he cheated and i found out.

The day I found out about my ex cheating was a blur, I was crying so hard that day that I barely even understand what they were saying. But I remember my daughter saying ""Mom, dad made us happy for years, it's time for him to be happy too."" I honestly would have laughed if she said that to me today, but at the time, I was crying so hard it didn't register how ridiculous she was. 

When we separated, our daughter declared she was staying with me, patting my ex on the shoulder and saying ""I'll take care of her, dad, dont worry"". I just rolled my eyes at the time cause I was no longer speaking to them both. The first day my ex was gone, she surprised with breakfast in bed, which I shoved down on the floor in front of her. She cleaned it without complaint and after that day, I started locking my door to avoid such incidents. She cooks for me all the time, and everytime she did, I just ignore it. In fact I didn't eat much at the time, because my ex would often come by and drop off groceries. Whenever the hunger gets too unbearable, I would order delivery and eat in my room.

Fast forward to 3 months, my ex came crying back, saying I was actually the one he loves. Which I honestly predicted because although he was very much hung up on the past, he was very sweet and loving to me. Our marriage was literally something out of a movie, even after 17 years of marriage, we still acted like newlyweds. Date nights every weekend, cuddles, and playing video games together. We never even fought, we just banter playfully. The day he came back he told me how they always fought, about how she wasnt as understanding and loving as me, about how he missed my cuddles and playing video games with me. Of course I just ignored him. After that day, he started staying at our house. He tried to sleep in our room the first night, but i stood up and slept in the living room. After that he started sleeping in the guest room. That day too, i remember my daughter telling me, as she sat with me on the living, ""Aren't you glad mom, dad is back. We're gonna be a family again."" I would have laughed at her face if i wasnt busy treating her like air.

After that day, they started doing everything they to make it up for me. My ex even started bringing me home flowers everyday. They gave me gifts, cooked and clean for me, and all the while, I just kept ignoring them, not uttering a single word. 

3 days ago was the first day my daughter confronted me. Which is probably because it was her 17th birthday. I used to make homemade cakes for her and decorate the house depending on what her current interest is. That day she was  crying in the kitchen, and i just ignored her and walked past her to get coffee. She started talking to me, asking me why i couldnt forgive them. She told me i was being cruel, that they already did everything they could. She cried and cried, telling me all the stuffs we used to do on her birthday, about how happy we were, about how she wants to go back to that. That day i looked at her for the first time in six months and i felt nothing. I wasnt moved or anything by her tears. I didnt feel anger or hurt. I didnt feel sorry for what i did. After we stared at each other for a while, i just went back to my room without talking to her..

That day was also the day my parents came and talked to me. Theyre trying to get me to forgive my ex and daughter. They never asked me before to forgive them. They said the same things my daughter said, that i was being cruel. When i confided to my bestfriend, she told me that maybe its time to forgive them. That my daughter was still so young and she made a mistake but shes still my daughter. In all honesty, i dont feel like i did anything cruel, since they were the ones who betrayed me first. And although im not mad anymore, i honestly dont feel anything for them anymore and i feel like its just a hassle to even try and be family with them. But people i know are insisting i just forgive them.

Am i really the one being cruel here?",174,1731769336.0,AITAH,176,0.81,False

1gsoz3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_CapableWhole78/comments/1gsoz3h/its_okay_im_only_24/,"Its okay, I'm only 24.","I have always dreamed of having a peaceful life by the time I turn 24 or 25‚Äîowning my own apartment, car, appliances, and a personal space to call my own. Unfortunately, those plans haven't turned out as I had hoped. Now that I'm 24 years old, I find myself still living under my parents' roof, without a car or my own apartment. However, I am fortunate to have found a job that I believe is a good starting point and will serve as a stepping stone toward my dreams.

One of my biggest aspirations is to open my own coffee shop, which would also sell flowers. I envision it as a place where customers can relax, enjoy a warm drink, and immerse themselves in a peaceful atmosphere while reading a book and taking in the calm surroundings. I‚Äôve always enjoyed seeing people casually talking, enjoying their time, and noticing the smiles in their eyes and on their faces. Those moments give me a warm spot in my heart. I still want to achieve my dreams, maybe not right now, but I know that when the time is right, I'll have my own coffee shop.

But for now, I‚Äôm enjoying my life the way I want to remember it when I turn 50 or 60. I remember the first few weeks and months after I graduated from college. Those weeks and months felt like a crisis to me‚Äîunemployed, not knowing what to do with my life, and feeling a lot of pressure on my shoulders because I‚Äôm the eldest. I remember many nights filled with self-doubt about my capabilities, skills, and neglecting my own growth. There were nights full of tears in my eyes because I hated myself for feeling like I lacked something and wasn‚Äôt as good as other people my age.

But then it hit me that I shouldn't be so hard on myself‚Äîthat I shouldn‚Äôt compare my journey and abilities with those of others. I shouldn‚Äôt put so much pressure on myself, dictating what I should have achieved at the age of 24. Not everyone had it easy when they were my age. Not a lot of people have the same privileges in life. And I‚Äôm not alone in this; many people have experienced moments like this‚Äîmaybe even my father, who likely had similar struggles when he was 24. I think I should not allow myself to put so much pressure on me because everyone has their own path in life.

Maybe at the age of 24 or 30, you still haven‚Äôt achieved your dreams or figured things out, and that‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs okay not to achieve all the things you want, or to be the smartest, prettiest, sexiest, or happiest person in the world. Not everything in life has to be beautiful or perfect. It‚Äôs life. You‚Äôre allowed to fail, to breathe, to take a long break, to cry out loud, and to live the way you want. Your life should not be defined by the people around you or by society‚Äôs standards. Your life should be defined by you, and only you.",1,1731769036.0,u_CapableWhole78,0,0.99,False

**Scene: Monk's Caf√©. George is sitting in a booth with a notepad, furiously scribbling. Jerry and Elaine walk in and sit down across from him. George looks up, wide-eyed and triumphant.**

**George:** (pointing to his notepad) I‚Äôve cracked it, Jerry! I‚Äôve cracked the whole INTJ-INTP thing!

**Jerry:** (dryly) Oh good. I was worried I‚Äôd have to live another day not knowing how to classify overthinking.

**Elaine:** (laughing) What, did you discover a secret handshake or something?

**George:** (leaning in conspiratorially) No, no, no. It‚Äôs even bigger than that. You see, the INTP‚Äîget this‚Äîthey‚Äôre obsessed with being mistaken for INTJs or INFJs. They think it‚Äôs, like, the elite club of personality types.

**Jerry:** (mocking) Oh no, not the elite club! Do they have jackets? Secret decoder rings?

**George:** (ignoring him) It‚Äôs true! They try to act all strategic like an INTJ, but they can‚Äôt actually commit to a plan. And the INFJ? Forget it! INTPs love pretending they‚Äôre empaths or whatever INFJs are supposed to be.

**Elaine:** (sarcastic) Oh, sure. ‚ÄúPretending to feel.‚Äù That sounds like a blast.

**Jerry:** (pointing to George‚Äôs notepad) And you figured this out by‚Ä¶ what? Observing people who don‚Äôt even know you‚Äôre watching them?

**George:** (defensive) I did research, Jerry. Forums, YouTube, Facebook groups.

**Elaine:** Ah. (leaning back) George, why do you care so much? You‚Äôre not an INTJ, an INTP, or an INFJ.

**George:** (exploding) I care because it‚Äôs infuriating! These people are running around trying to convince everyone they‚Äôre these misunderstood geniuses when they‚Äôre just... I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ personality imposters!

**Elaine:** (grinning) Imposters, George? Really? What‚Äôs next, you start calling them frauds and take them to court?

**Jerry:** (laughing) ""Your Honor, I present Exhibit A: this INTP pretending they have a five-year plan.""

**George:** (ignoring them) I‚Äôm telling you, it‚Äôs a whole thing. INTJs don‚Äôt even care if you think they‚Äôre elite. They‚Äôre too busy running the backend or whatever it is they do. They're always hiding behind something. A screen. Sunglasses. A wall. A bench. But the INTPs? They want the title. They‚Äôll argue with you for hours about why they could‚Äôve been an INTJ‚Ä¶ if only they cared enough to try!

*Kramer stumbles coming out of the bathroom but somehow manages to land gracefully, brushing himself off as he struts toward the booth.*

**Elaine:** (smirking) So, what‚Äôs this whole thing about INTJs being the ‚Äúelite‚Äù? Because I‚Äôve met plenty of hoodie-wearing kids who were supposedly ‚Äúbrilliant INTJs.‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt sound too elite to me.

**Kramer:** That‚Äôs it! That‚Äôs exactly it, Elaine! INTJs aren‚Äôt the elite‚Äîthey‚Äôre the rebels, the outcasts. That‚Äôs why those goth types like to mistype as them and the INFJ. They think they‚Äôre dark and mysterious. But real INTJs? They‚Äôre not trying to be dark‚Äîthey just *think differently*. They're obsessively curious. 

**Elaine:** (raising an eyebrow) Oh, really?

**Kramer:** You might have one INTJ for every one hundred people, and you‚Äôd never notice them. One in a while they are the hoodie guy in the back of the classroom, head down on the desk, because school? It‚Äôs boring. It‚Äôs beneath them. If they aren't the hoodie guy, they're only calculating the approximate amount of work to scrape by. While everyone else is asleep, they‚Äôre up all night working on something spectacular that no one else would even understand.

**Elaine:** (sarcastic) So they‚Äôre geniuses because they‚Äôre antisocial?

**Kramer:** (grinning, leaning in) No, no, no! It‚Äôs not about being antisocial‚Äîit‚Äôs about seeing the world differently. And you know what happens? The INTPs step in and fill the gap. They‚Äôre like the system‚Äôs pseudo-facto INTJ. They‚Äôre not the real deal, but they try to act the part.

**Elaine:** (skeptical) What‚Äôs the difference?

**Kramer:** Oh, there‚Äôs a *massive* difference. INTJs look like they‚Äôre plotting to tear the system down‚Äîand sometimes, they are. But INTPs? They *are* the system. They keep it running, perpetuating it, all while wearing that same ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got it all figured out‚Äù look. It‚Äôs a cover, Elaine‚Äîa big, shiny cover.

**Kramer:** (leaning in) Another difference? One mirrors, and the other projects. INTJs mirror to protect their internal inward processing with deflection. They take in information and project it inwards into themselves. INTPs? They use their internal outward projection to take what is inside and push it out to others. They‚Äôre natural rivals. INTP is the school board, the administration‚Ä¶ Hilary Clinton. INTJs are the anarchists in the mind of an INTP‚Äîthey‚Äôre the Marxists, the anti-fascists, the rebels. But not the ones you‚Äôd ever see.

**Jerry:** (nodding) School doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúchallenge their potential.‚Äù That‚Äôs what they always say. Isn‚Äôt ‚Äúanti-fascist‚Äù kind of stigmatized now?

**Kramer:** (leaning in dramatically) Jerry, it‚Äôs not just that. Society seems to unfairly and unilaterally scrutinize anything they do. Marx, Newton, Tesla, Darwin, Jung, Nietzsche, Hitchens, Galileo, Machiavelli, Kubrick, da Vinci‚Äîall of them. They see through the system. They know it‚Äôs broken, so they‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs crack it open.‚Äù But what happens? Society tries to crush them. Meanwhile, the INTPs? (gestures broadly) They *are* the system! They designed it! They maintain it. And when INTJs speak out about the public education system? INTPs repress them, deny the criticism, refuse to hear it.

**George:** Kramer, some of those were E and P types.

**Kramer:** I‚Äôm following the Triadic Coding Method. It‚Äôs much more accurate. You‚Äôre not an introvert just because you can give a speech in public. If someone knocks on your door and your anxiety shoots through the roof‚Äîthat‚Äôs how you know you‚Äôre an introvert.

**Elaine:** (ignoring and laughing) So what? The INTPs built the school, and the INTJs are too cool to pay attention?

**Kramer:** (snapping his fingers) Exactly! INTJs can‚Äôt make it through the system very easily because it‚Äôs not designed for them. It‚Äôs all memorization and busywork. You ever notice how some of these hoodie-guys sleep all through class or just don't pay attention, don't do their homework, but then get 100% on a test? Those are the INTJ. The INTP is the one with an 8 sleeve color-coordinated binder that they lug around to every class. Some of them wish to be the rebel, they wish to be INTJ or INFJ, and so they pretend to be them. They hate them with an absolute passion and so they become them. INTP thinks in black and white, true or false, it is the school system. INTJ hate that stuff! But INTPs? Oh, they thrive in it. The system loves them, and they love the system.

**Jerry:** (smirking) Makes sense. INTJs are out there criticizing their school for not offering enough, and the INTPs are debating whether the syllabus is too unfocused.

**Kramer:** (wildly gesturing) Yes! Yes! And here‚Äôs the kicker, Jerry‚Äîthey don‚Äôt even see it! These INTPs, they think they‚Äôre these big, free-thinking philosophers, but what are they really doing? Reinforcing the system, Jerry! The whole MBTI‚Äîit‚Äôs a mess! They‚Äôve got Hillary Rodham Clinton as an INTJ when she‚Äôs clearly the poster child for an INTP!

**Kramer (Cont):** Stephen Hawking, James Cameron, Patrick Stewart‚Äîall INTPs! And they‚Äôve got the nerve to claim Einstein? No way! Einstein hated the education system, thought memory work was a total waste of cognitive power‚Äîthat‚Äôs an INTJ mindset, Jerry! INTJs see the inefficiencies, the waste, and they hate it! But the INTPs? Oh, they suppress that truth in the system! They‚Äôll deny it, they‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúOh, those quotes aren‚Äôt real,‚Äù but they *are* real! Maybe not word-for-word, but they capture the essence, Jerry‚Äîthe essence!

**Kramer:** (dramatically) And what do the INTPs do? They‚Äôre out there saying, ‚ÄúOh, this law makes sense,‚Äù or ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs tweak the curriculum a little.‚Äù Meanwhile, the INTJ is in the parking lot, redesigning the entire school from the ground up because the whole thing doesn‚Äôt work! And what happens next? The INTPs put their foot down, keep the INTJs under control! It‚Äôs a system, Jerry‚Äîa system!

**Elaine:** (leaning forward) So, wait. Are you saying INTJs want to burn it all down?

**Kramer:** (dramatically) Not just burn it down, Elaine. Burn it, rebuild it, *optimize* it! Make education better for children. Give kids the tools to train the parts of their brain where they‚Äôre most intelligent. Not just these INTP memory games, treating stuff like Jeopardy as the peak of intellectual achievement. Memory isn‚Äôt intelligence! INTJs are the error correctors‚Äîthey see a flaw, and they *have* to fix it. But INTPs? They just sit there, pointing out what‚Äôs wrong without ever offering a better solution. Why? Because they thrived in school. And the education system? It only teaches a handful of skills, and one of them is error identification.

**Jerry:** (mocking) ‚ÄúThis desk is uneven, but let me write you a 20-page paper on why desk design is flawed as a concept.‚Äù

**Elaine:** (laughing) Meanwhile, the INTJ‚Äôs already built a desk that folds into itself for efficient storage.

**Kramer:** (grinning) That‚Äôs right! INTJs are the hoodie guys, the weirdos in school that people have a weird fascination about. They don‚Äôt make it through the system because the system isn‚Äôt built for them. But INTPs? Oh, they love it. They‚Äôre grading the tests, writing the textbooks, and telling you why your answers are wrong without the freedom to elaborate. It is this or that. That's it.

**Jerry:** (leaning back) So INTJs reject the system, and INTPs are the system. Sounds like a real clash of the titans.

**Elaine:** (mocking) More like the clash of the hoodie versus the tweed blazer.

**Kramer:** Why do you think they feel targeted. Why they feel secretive. Because they're still going through the inquisition kept alive by the P types. The INTJ‚Äôs in a hoodie, scribbling their grand plan for world domination in a notebook, and the INTP‚Äôs in a blazer, arguing over whether domination is even a valid concept.

**Jerry:** (grinning) And neither of them gets anything done.

**Elaine:** (pointing at Kramer) But who wins? Hoodie or blazer?

**Kramer:** (pauses, thinking deeply) Oh, the blazer wins. Always. Because the blazer is the one running the system. The hoodie guy doesn‚Äôt stand a chance. The INTP doesn't have to do anything so long as nothing changes. If things change. Boom, they're out and destabilized.

**Jerry:** (shrugging) Yeah, but you can‚Äôt ignore the hoodie guy. They‚Äôre the ones who come back 10 years later with a billion-dollar startup.

**Elaine:** (nodding) Or a manifesto.

**Kramer:** (bursting in) Jerry, you gotta have both‚Äîthe blazer and the hoodie! The blazer runs the world, but the hoodie? That‚Äôs the spark! And listen, this TTI reassessment redefining judging into ‚Äúconjective thinking.‚Äù They used data from tens of thousands online and found INTJs are self-deprecating, introverted, hyperfocused, caring, workaholic supervillains with childlike curiosity. None of it makes sense, Jerry, but it‚Äôs all true!

**Jerry:** (nodding) Classic ‚ÄúI could‚Äôve been great, but I‚Äôm too lazy‚Äù routine.

**Kramer:** (smacks his hands together) That‚Äôs it, Jerry! That‚Äôs what it means when people say an INTP is lazy. You throw out an idea, any idea, and what do they do? Shut it down! Ich habe eine schlechte K√∂rperhaltung.

**Newman, passing by:** Well, that explains why your shadow looks like it's shrugging.

**Jerry:** What the hell did you just say?

**Kramer:** It's Deutsch. German. Deutschlander Spreche. It's a way to tell someone that they're being annoying, that they're too much. Just like the INTP. ""It‚Äôs flawed,"" they say. ""It‚Äôll never work,"" they say. What's wrong with what we have.

**Elaine:** (grinning) And what do they do to fix it?

**Kramer:** Nothing! Zip! They don‚Äôt want to do the work! That‚Äôs the point! INTJs? Oh, they‚Äôre error correctors. They‚Äôll see a broken thing, and they can‚Äôt sleep until they fix it. But INTPs? (shaking his head) They‚Äôre archival. They collect information, hoard it like squirrels, but when it‚Äôs time to actually *use* it? Forget about it.

**Jerry:** (calmly) So you‚Äôre saying they‚Äôre intellectual squirrels?

**Kramer:** They‚Äôll nitpick your ideas to death, but try asking them for a better one. ‚ÄúOh, no, that‚Äôs not my job. I don't have time for your nonsensical drivel.‚Äù

**Elaine:** (laughing) Lazy *and* smug. That‚Äôs a winning combination.

**Kramer:** (dramatic) Oh, it‚Äôs worse than smug, Elaine. It‚Äôs a refusal to take responsibility! That‚Äôs what makes them lazy! Responsibility is like garlic to a vampire for these people. The second they have to commit to fixing something, they vanish! Poof! They are the type to admit to needing therapy but never go. INTJ drive themselves to the ER crying about needing mental health help. INTP project and tell everyone else they're mentally ill for suggesting anything against the establishment. They claim to not uphold the system but that's all they do. Actions are louder than words, and an INTPs word is useless.

**Jerry:** (grinning) And then the INTJ comes in, sees that their counter type hasn't done anything, gets mad, fixes everything, and gets blamed for being too bossy.

**Kramer:** The INTJ is like, ‚ÄúFine, I‚Äôll do it myself.‚Äù And the INTP? They just sit there, arms crossed, going, ‚ÄúWell, I could‚Äôve done that if I wanted to.‚Äù

**Elaine:** (mocking) ‚ÄúBut it wasn‚Äôt worth my time.‚Äù

**Kramer:** Elaine! That‚Äôs their line! ‚ÄúNot worth my time!‚Äù You ever notice that? It‚Äôs their go-to excuse for not doing anything. You could be standing in a burning building, Jerry, flames licking at your ankles, and the INTP would be like, ‚ÄúWell, you know, technically, fire suppression systems should‚Äôve been installed years ago.‚Äù

**Elaine:** (laughing) Meanwhile, the INTJ‚Äôs running around stabbing water lines to put out the fire, and then gets sued for property damage.

**KRAMER:** Bingo! The INTJ‚Äôs putting out fires‚Äîliterally and figuratively‚Äîwhile the INTP‚Äôs sitting there, writing a paper about how fires even started in the first place. You know why INTJs succeed? Because they don‚Äôt care what you think. They‚Äôve got a sensitive psyche, just like the INFJ, ISTJ, and ISFJ‚Äîthey take in information and project it inward. But here‚Äôs the catch: if they take in the wrong information, it throws them off balance.  

**KRAMER:** (leaning in) The INTJ, though? They might be the type with the **most** cringe. They **embrace** the cringe. They **are** the cringe. And you know what? They don‚Äôt care. Not one bit. That‚Äôs why they're basically unstoppable. Look at the good that came from not listening. They'll walk down the street blasting the Inspector Gadget Theme, Jerry, they don't give a damn!

**Elaine:** You make it sound like INTJs are cringe basement dwellers and INTPs are just freeloading philosophers.

**Kramer:** Oh, they are! INTP? Big thinkers, big debaters, but ask them to lift a finger? (smacks table abruptly) Not gonna happen!! INTJ? Complain about how the system is broken, boom, one pops out of the shadows. 

**Jerry:** (sipping coffee) Well, they say history is written by the victors. Guess the INTPs are busy chronicling all the INTJ victories.

**George:** (defensive) Well, I could be an INTJ. I‚Äôve got the hoodie! I‚Äôve got the plans!

**Elaine:** (laughing) George, your ‚Äúplans‚Äù usually involve sneaking out of paying for a meal or faking a disability. Not exactly the stuff of world domination.

**Jerry:** (grinning) Plus, an INTJ wouldn‚Äôt spend an entire afternoon trying to justify stealing napkins from Monk‚Äôs.

**George:** (shrugging) They put too many out! It‚Äôs wasteful!

**Kramer:** What about Newman? He‚Äôs got a system. He‚Äôs always scheming.

**Elaine:** (laughing) Newman‚Äôs not an INTJ. He‚Äôs a Campaigner, an ENFP. Always trying to rope people into his plans, but they‚Äôre usually too convoluted to work.

**Jerry:** (dryly) You‚Äôre looking for the quiet, hoodie-wearing guy in the corner. That‚Äôs not exactly our crowd.

**Kramer:** What about the Soup-Nazi? He‚Äôs got structure. Rules! Precision! Demanding. Controlling. That‚Äôs an INTJ if I‚Äôve ever seen one.

**Elaine:** (laughing) No way. The Soup Nazi‚Äôs a Logistician, an ISTJ. It‚Äôs not strategy‚Äîit‚Äôs order. He‚Äôs just making sure the line moves smoothly and nobody ruins his system. He‚Äôs not plotting the rise of an empire.

**Jerry:** (nodding) Yeah, the Soup Nazi‚Äôs not thinking five steps ahead. He‚Äôs just thinking, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask for bread.‚Äù

**George:** (throwing his hands up) So what you‚Äôre saying is, we don‚Äôt know any INTJs? Not a single one?

**Jerry:** (pointing at George) And that‚Äôs why none of them are here. They‚Äôd take one look at this table and think, ‚ÄúJust keep walking. You‚Äôre almost to the door.‚Äù

**George:** (glaring) Oh, sure, blame me.

**Elaine:** (smirking) Well, you *do* spend most of your time creating chaos.

**Jerry:** (confused) No, George is an *idiot*. INTJs thrive in chaos. INTPs can‚Äôt handle it. Though, to be fair, I don‚Äôt think George‚Äôs *personal* chaos is the kind they‚Äôd survive in. INTJs like *structured* chaos.

**Kramer:** (shaking his head) That‚Äôs contradicting! They can‚Äôt be rebels causing chaos and then demand social order. That‚Äôs unreasonable, Jerry!

**Jerry:** (grinning) Why not? Have you read anything by an INTJ? They all say the same thing‚Äî‚ÄúFrom greater chaos comes greater order.‚Äù It‚Äôs their *pinnacle belief*.

**George:** (gesturing to himself) Well, there you go. That‚Äôs me!

**Elaine:** (mocking) Oh, sure, George. Your chaos involves lying to get out of a gym membership and eating an entire Entenmann‚Äôs cake in one sitting.

**Jerry:** (nodding) INTJ chaos would be, ‚ÄúI overthrew the system and replaced it with a self-sustaining utopia.‚Äù George‚Äôs chaos is, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt figure out how to unsubscribe from a mailing list,‚Äù so I burned down the post office. 

**George:** (crossing his arms) I‚Äôm still calculated. I‚Äôve got *plans*!

**Elaine:** (grinning) Yeah, plans. Like when your *mother* caught you... you know... doing the *thing*.

**Jerry:** (deadpan) Master strategist right there.

**Kramer:** (smirking) He's definitely a master something.

","I'm experiencing an issue with my Sage (Breville) Barista Touch Impress. When I prepare espresso, I set the grind size to 3 (fine), and the automatic dosing functions correctly.

However, after making a caf√© cr√®me at grind size 19 (coarse) and then returning to grind size 3 for espresso, the automatic dosing grinds too much coffee for a few times. I have to manually stop the grinding at about 3/4 of the progress bar. After a few uses, the dosing returns to normal, but this problem recurs every time after I have used the grind size 19 for a caf√© cr√®me.

1gsou0o,https://i.redd.it/6ozm27l71a1e1.jpeg,So you just ‚Äúruined‚Äù your new cast iron‚Ä¶,"So many posts like this lately‚Ä¶ here‚Äôs my answer to all of them‚Ä¶

Order some take out. Calm down. Breathe. These things were thrown around and strapped to chuck wagons as pioneers traversed the country. If you didn‚Äôt crack or warp it, it‚Äôs fixable. Surely you‚Äôve seen the pans that have been dug out of garages and left in backyards on here. I‚Äôve seen pans in worse condition for sale for a couple hundred dollars. 

Now that you have the pity party out of the way, clean this tough bitch up. Scrape it, scrub it, whatever‚Ä¶ get that shit off of it. Toss a layer of seasoning on it. This pan will outlive you and your grand children‚Äôs grand children. You WILL NOT ‚Äúruin‚Äù it. I have several pans that are over 120 years old. They were HORRIBLE when I got them and cleaned up to new condition. 

THEN start slow‚Ä¶ you have to build up seasoning.  Control your temps. Spend $30 on an infrared thermometer. It will save you a ton of frustration. Always PREHEAT pan. Well‚Ä¶ almost always, but you‚Äôll get to that. Cook bacon (not the maple flavored, that gets sticky). Bake some corn bread (melt lots of butter in preheated pan before adding batter), make a pizza (preheat pan with olive oil before adding dough)‚Ä¶ do simple things. These build up seasoning fast. Remember, you CAN preheat in the oven while you prep and move it to the stovetop.

Get a metal fish spatula and use it in your CI. Trust me, it will only make the pan better. 

THEN‚Ä¶ whatever you plan to cook‚Ä¶ steaks, burgers, bacon, eggs, pizza‚Ä¶ search on this sub for right temp. I promise someone has already cooked it and has posted the temps. Using your THERMOMETER start cooking at those temps. BE PATIENT‚Ä¶ food does tend to initially stick and then release as it cooks, so DON‚ÄôT TOUCH IT. This is hard. I know, but DON‚ÄôT. 

Cooking eggs? Search it on here‚Ä¶ Cooking cornbread? Search it on here. People have posted great recipes WITH the technique. 

Cast Iron is the most amazing cookware. It‚Äôs all I use. My kitchen is 99.9% Cast Iron. Even my bakeware is CI. I have one stainless steel Revereware pot. Literally everything else is CI or enameled CI. 

If you do what I tell you, you will become a much better cook and learn to absolutely LOVE your CI. It‚Äôs all about technique. The seasoning is just a helper. I‚Äôve cooked eggs on a new factory seasoned pan. I promise. It will become your favorite pan and you will buy more. You will have this pan the rest of your life. One day you will be old and laugh at this.

Your assignment this morning? 

First, grab a cup of coffee. 

Second, immediately order those 2 things I linked

Third, clean the pan. Use the techniques people have posted. You cannot be too rough. Worse thing you will do is remove factory seasoning‚Ä¶ no big deal. Seasoning comes and goes. It‚Äôll be pretty one day and ugly the next. It‚Äôs about function, not looks. If it‚Äôs not rusting, then there‚Äôs still seasoning and it‚Äôs fine. 

Fourth, season it a time or 2 with Grapeseed oil or Crisco/canola. READ THE FAQs on seasoning and search the sub to learn from other people‚Äôs mistakes. This is an easy step, don‚Äôt over think it and have faith when we tell you to ‚Äúwipe off all the oil‚Äù.

You can have the pan ready to go by this afternoon. BUT read and research this sub while you wait for your Amazon order to come. Take notes if you have to. Then when the order is delivered, get cooking!!! You have the opportunity to create a family heirloom, something that future generations will cherish. Embrace that and take the time to learn how to use it properly. 

BEFORE ANYONE SAYS ANYTHING‚Ä¶ yes this is reinforced (can hold up to 350 lbs) and screwed into floor joists. IT‚ÄôS FINE. My husband is quite capable.

(M24)

To preface, I‚Äôm not timid at all. In fact I‚Äôm extremely confident and fairly outgoing and adventurous. 

I don‚Äôt have a problem talking to women, I‚Äôm not scared to approach and I can strike up a good convo with solid banter.

And I will talk and joke etc. especially when out on a date or dating a girl.

But most of the time I‚Äôm just quiet. I sit in peace. If we‚Äôre out for coffee I‚Äôll just sit in peace and enjoy the moment and speak if necessary. I don‚Äôt speak for the sake of it.

I‚Äôm not the type of person to just yap yap yap. And it‚Äôs not in my personality and I‚Äôm not going to do a full 360¬∞ personality change just to become a yapper. 

What goes through a woman‚Äôs head when I‚Äôm just sitting there quiet? Does she think I‚Äôm an asshole? I have 0 personality? I don‚Äôt like her? Just curious. 

I‚Äôve had multiple relationships and didn‚Äôt really care about any of them to notice the intricate details of how they reacted towards it. I didn‚Äôt notice tbh.

BUT I have been in one relationship where I was in love and did notice her and the small details (my last relationship) and she didn‚Äôt mind at all. We would sit quietly smiling at each other in a kind of cheeky way, almost like we were having a telepathic convo. 

I guess this is why I ask, going forward after 4 years of dating one person, I‚Äôve been on a few dates and saw a girl for 3 months. But she said I was too ‚Äúharsh‚Äù and ‚Äúnot available‚Äù. 

So now I‚Äôm thinking, (lightbulb moment) maybe it was the fact that I‚Äôm just quiet. 
The reason I notice this now is I‚Äôm at a cafe and this guy next to me is on a date I assume with this girl and dude is YAPPING. And I thought to myself, bro I could never. 

I do however often get asked ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong‚Äù ‚Äúwhy are you so quiet‚Äù which one girl in particular hounded me about to the point where I said ‚Äúi don‚Äôt like wasting words‚Äù

Anyway, here I am, ironically yapping. 
What goes through their minds?

I am a long time Sasquatch believer, have attended conferences and been a participant on here for years (new account because I got off Reddit for a few years and came back) and I know that people sometimes share topics on here that are mocking but this is NOT one of them. It‚Äôs kind of funny and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I get memed for this but I don‚Äôt care. What happened actually blew my mind. 

This happened two weeks ago. My wife and I were going to Canton, Texas for the flea market (locally famous once a month gathering that brings thousands of people in). I found this very cool cabin on Airbnb that was out in the sticks. The cabin was raised on stilts, like what you would see in a flood prone area, but was not in a creek or river bottom. It was surrounded by what appeared to be at least 100 acres of VERY thick woods with a probably another 60 acres of hayfield bordered by a creek. Think 12 miles from the closest town, down an FM, down a county road a mile or two to the gate entrance, then down a dirt road a 1/4 of mile to the house. The cabin was surrounded by a walk around deck with chairs and a cooker, where you could sit 20‚Äô or so above the ground and observe probably one acre of cleared area around the house, which is completely surrounded by thick woods. We saw deer, coons, squirrels, all sorts of stuff in the open area. 

We got there the first night, walked the place (hiking trails and dirt roads), then went to dinner when it started getting dark. Came back and I sat out on the deck listening for a few hours. Heard wild hogs, heard a bobcat scream, heard what sounded like some deer fighting. Animals everywhere. 

The next morning, I woke up before daylight and wanted to sit on the deck to see if I could see any deer. The sun started to come up. This is what happened. Having my coffee, I ripped a loud, very distinctive sounding fart, and approximately 5 seconds later, the EXACT same sound came from the woods less than 50 years away. I sat there stunned for 30 or so seconds. I immediately thought damn, is one standing over there watching me for the last day and finally decided to interact? I whistled a certain way to see if that would be mimicked too but no other sounds came from the woods.

Nothing else happened the rest of the weekend. Could it have been a bird? I find it hard to picture a bird doing it but I suppose it‚Äôs possible. I listed for mockingbirds from then on but didn‚Äôt hear one.

I‚Äôve been working at a boba chain for a while now and it‚Äôs in a busy city with a bunch of international college students (BrownU). I‚Äôve gotten a fair amt of customers who know little English and I thought learning some common phrases would be helpful, as well as learning how to say our different drinks. 

Context: SE asian american, hs student, HSK2 lvl üò≠. I know how to say basic things like cup sizes, sugar and ice lvl, but im not sure how to greet customers and etc.

Toppings:
Boba (normal sized tapioca)
Pearls (smaller)
Pudding
Aloe
Mango jelly
Diced mango 
Diced strawberry
Lychee popping boba

Common scenarios and how to encounter them?
- ppl tend to ask if theres caffeine in certain drinks 
-  certain drinks we can‚Äôt change the sugar or ice lvl so how would i say something like ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt adjust the sugar/ice lvl bc of our recipe‚Äù üò¢
- how should i handle payments? Saying things like, ‚Äúyour total is __‚Ä¶ okay your change is __ have a good day‚Äù

1gsokfu,https://www.reddit.com/r/conservativeterrorism/comments/1gsokfu/prices_will_rise/,Prices will rise ,"Asked how he would lower grocery prices during a September town hall in Michigan, Trump said tariffs would help U.S. farmers. Trump has called for a 60% tariff on products made in China and a ‚Äúuniversal‚Äô‚Äô tariff of 10% to 20% on all other foreign goods that enter the United States. In some speeches, he mentioned even higher percentages.

As of 2021, the U.S. imported 60% of its fresh fruit, 38% of its fresh vegetables ‚Äî excluding potatoes and mushrooms ‚Äî and 10% of its beef, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

---(

Does Trump understand Americans eat year around but many farms in USA can't grow in winter?  Even what we do grow is seasonal and we either do without or import. 

Does he realize we import things no one grows here? 

Did he forget how his last trade war over tariffs with China crippled our soy bean farmers so much he had to send them welfare checks? 

Name one coffee or tea plantation in US. Does he realize how our farms dependent on the very immigrant labor he threatened to deport?

Over the past year, I‚Äôve noticed significant improvements in my ability to think, learn, and solve problems. This realization inspired me to summarize some key takeaways that have been transformative for me.  

---

## 1. Embracing Fragmented Learning  

By ""fragmented learning,"" I don‚Äôt mean scattering your efforts over short bursts of time‚Äîthat's usually unproductive. Instead, I‚Äôm referring to the practice of tackling individual, specific questions or topics that genuinely spark your curiosity. Unlike the structured, systematic education we receive in school, this method starts with a question like, *What is this concept? Why does it exist? What problems does it solve?*  

For instance, when learning about a new technology, I prioritize understanding the problem it addresses, why that problem exists, and how the system or framework is designed to solve it. Similarly, I enjoy diving into cultural history‚Äîif I encounter a fascinating custom, I‚Äôll research its origins, evolution, and societal significance. Over time, this process builds a rich, interconnected knowledge base.  

---

## 2. Don't Let Questions Go Unanswered  

When solving a problem, the goal isn't just resolution‚Äîit‚Äôs to explore the surrounding system. A single question can be a gateway to understanding an entire domain.  

I learned this lesson while managing support tickets at a previous job. Often, the issues I encountered were in areas I was unfamiliar with. To resolve them, I had to analyze logs, trace them to code, and infer the purpose and logic behind certain modules. I‚Äôd construct hypotheses about what the system was doing and test them. This approach often led me to spend hours exploring a single problem, but the insights gained were invaluable.  

If I couldn‚Äôt solve the problem myself, I‚Äôd ask a colleague for help and later revisit the issue to consolidate my understanding. This practice, when repeated, naturally builds a systematic understanding of a technology or subject.  

---

## 3. Overcoming the Pitfalls of Conventional Education  

Traditional education often instills two habits that hinder effective learning:  

### 1. Blind Reliance on Textbooks or Authoritative Sources  

Many students believe they need to learn from a single, comprehensive resource from start to finish, chasing perfection. This approach often results in low efficiency and poor retention.  

Why does this happen?  

- **Quality of Resources**: Many textbooks and courses are suboptimal. I‚Äôve found that revisiting topics through better-structured online content, like certain YouTube or Bilibili courses, can make previously incomprehensible concepts clear.  
- **Adapting to Personal Models**: Even excellent resources cater to specific audiences. The key is to map new knowledge onto your existing mental models. While this may initially lead to misunderstandings, these can be corrected as your understanding deepens. It‚Äôs better to have an imperfect but integrated grasp of a concept than to leave it as an abstract, disconnected idea. As the philosopher Wang Yangming said, *‚ÄúThere is no principle outside the mind.‚Äù* Knowledge must resonate with your own thinking to become truly yours.  

### 2. Fear of Complexity  

Many people shy away from unfamiliar or seemingly advanced concepts, a mindset rooted in traditional education's rigid grade-level progression. However, most knowledge isn‚Äôt as daunting as it appears. By breaking complex topics into smaller, self-contained modules, even sophisticated systems can be understood piece by piece.  

---

## 4. Cultivating Curiosity  

At some point‚Äîthough I can‚Äôt pinpoint exactly when‚ÄîI began to develop a natural curiosity about the world. This curiosity drives me to constantly ask questions and search for answers online. Recently, I‚Äôve started recording all the questions I ponder, whether I find answers to them or not. This habit not only sharpens my critical thinking but also provides a steady stream of learning opportunities.  

---

## 5. The Power of Coffee and Exercise  

Having hobbies that keep you physically active can significantly enhance your mental clarity. Over the past year, I‚Äôve made jump rope and badminton regular parts of my routine, aiming for two to three sessions a week. I‚Äôm not great at badminton, but I love the post-game moments‚Äîsitting quietly, feeling the sweat, and letting my mind settle into a state of reflection.  

Coffee has also become a vital tool for focus. A single cup can enhance my ability to think deeply and work efficiently for an hour or more. The combination of physical activity and caffeine has been transformative for both my mental and physical well-being.  

---

## Closing Thoughts  

These habits and insights have reshaped the way I approach learning and problem-solving. If there‚Äôs one takeaway from my experience, it‚Äôs this: stay curious, be patient with your questions, and let your learning journey evolve naturally. Small, consistent steps can lead to profound growth.

I love the endless options and the friendly and fast service but I feel like within the last year I‚Äôve been disappointed with all the times I‚Äôve gone and i feel like it‚Äôs gone downhill. What used to be 5-10 min waits have turned into 30-40 min wait times (not during sticker days) and my drinks have been subpar. I usually order drinks with white coffee, but the last few times they‚Äôve  given me it with regular espresso. 

I love the iced golden eagles but man they LINE that up with caramel and i have an inch of it at the bottom of my cup, that goes for any drizzle you ask for. I ask for lite caramel and it‚Äôs still the same way with an inch of caramel. I hate complaining and I usually stop on my way to work.

Story:
I had recently gotten out of an abusive relationship that involved moving countries and divorce. It was a few months out of that relationship, and I was in the depths of my depression/recovery (frankly just learning how to enjoy coffee and morning sunshine again without being yelled at).

I‚Äôm having lunch with Eileen. Eileen is on a kick asking questions about my life. It feels similar to a dinner interrogation with APs.

Are you motherucking kidding me.

The flavor profile? Oh, it's exquisite. Notes of wet cardboard, hints of burnt rubber, with a delightful aftertaste of pure regret. But who cares about flavor when you can brag about your ridiculously long extraction time, am I right?

I've been ""enjoying"" pulling long lately. And by ""enjoying,"" I mean I've convinced myself that this is what peak coffee performance looks like. Who needs crema when you can have a cup full of bitter, watery disappointment?

UGC not only builds trust but also significantly reduces the content creation burden on marketing teams. Here's how you can make the most of it.

The Benefits of UGC

UGC offers numerous advantages beyond building trust. It allows marketing teams to focus on strategy and curation rather than constant production, which is particularly valuable for smaller businesses or those in niche markets. By analyzing UGC, brands can gain invaluable market insights, understand product usage, and identify features that are most appreciated or need improvement. Additionally, UGC can enhance SEO efforts by incorporating natural, conversational language that potential customers might use in searches, improving a brand's visibility in search engine results.

Authenticity and Relatability

UGC is powerful because it represents authentic experiences and opinions from real users. Unlike traditional marketing materials, UGC captures genuine moments of product use in everyday life, providing potential customers with relatable and trustworthy content. This authenticity is especially impactful in industries where trust is paramount, such as healthcare, finance, or high-end consumer goods. For instance, a skincare brand might benefit from users sharing before-and-after photos or detailed reviews of their experiences over time.

Legal Considerations

Before leveraging UGC, consider the legal aspects, particularly intellectual property rights. Ensure you have clear policies and user agreements that outline how you intend to use submitted content. This will protect both your brand and the content creators, fostering a positive and respectful relationship.

Tips for Acquiring UGC

Brands can employ creative strategies beyond basic contests and hashtags to stimulate UGC creation. For instance, creating ""unboxing experiences"" with visually appealing packaging and unexpected extras can encourage customers to share their initial reactions on social media. Interactive elements can also improve UGC. A coffee brand might include a QR code on its packaging that, when scanned, opens a mobile app, allowing customers to record and share their morning coffee ritual. Collaborations with UGC creators can be taken further by involving them in brand ambassador programs, product development, or limited edition releases.

Implementing UGC in Your Marketing

Decide where and how to use your UGC. Consider integrating UGC into the entire customer journey, from awareness to post-purchase support. For example, incorporate user-submitted questions and answers into product pages or feature customer success stories in email marketing campaigns to re-engage past purchasers. To maximize UGC impact, create dedicated spaces for it on your website or app, such as a community forum, a customer photo gallery, or a section for user-submitted tips and tricks.

Pro Tip: Analytics and Refinement

Analytics play a crucial role in a successful UGC strategy. Tracking metrics such as engagement rates, conversion impact, and sentiment analysis of UGC can help refine your approach over time. By understanding what types of UGC resonate most with your audience, you can tailor your strategy to generate even more impactful content.

Conclusion

Leveraging UGC can transform your marketing strategy by providing authentic, relatable, and valuable content that enhances trust, improves SEO, and provides market insights. By creatively acquiring and strategically implementing UGC, brands can boost visibility, drive sales, and build stronger connections with their audience. Start incorporating UGC into your marketing strategy today and watch your brand thrive.

These **Apple Cookies** are a cozy combination of spiced apple goodness and chewy oat perfection! Topped with a sweet glaze, they‚Äôre guaranteed to be a hit for any occasion. üçÇ‚ú®

# Ingredients

# For the Cookie Dough

* 2 sticks unsalted butter
* 4 Granny Smith apples (around 8 oz. each), peeled and grated
* 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 1 1/2 cups (200 g) all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 2 cups (160 g) old-fashioned rolled oats
* 2 teaspoons cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
* 1/4 teaspoon allspice
* 1/4 teaspoon cardamom
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

# For the Glaze

* 1 cup powdered sugar
* Pinch of salt
* 2 to 3 tablespoons milk

# Instructions

# Step 1: Brown the Butter

In a medium pan over medium heat, melt the butter. Let it boil, foam, and then quiet down. Once it turns a deep golden color and smells nutty, remove it from the heat. (Keep an eye on it‚Äîdon‚Äôt let it burn!) Pour into a heat-safe bowl and let cool for at least 10 minutes.

# Step 2: Cook the Apples

Return the pan to medium-high heat and cook the grated apples for about 5 minutes. Stir occasionally until most of the moisture has evaporated, and the apples reduce in size and begin to stick to the pan. Transfer to a large plate and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes to cool.

# Step 3: Prepare the Dough

Preheat your oven to 375¬∞F (190¬∞C) and line two large baking sheets with parchment paper.

In a large bowl, mix the cooled brown butter, sugar, vanilla, and apples until smooth. In another bowl, whisk together the flour, oats, salt, baking soda, and spices. Gradually add the dry mixture to the wet mixture and stir until just combined‚Äîdon‚Äôt overmix!

# Step 4: Shape and Bake

Using an ice cream scoop, portion the dough onto the baking sheets, leaving about 1 1/2 inches between each cookie. You should get about 8 cookies per tray.

Bake for 17 minutes, or until the tops and edges are golden brown. Halfway through, rotate the trays between the top and bottom racks to ensure even baking. Let the cookies cool on the trays for 10 minutes.

# Step 5: Make the Glaze

In a medium bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, and a pinch of salt until smooth and pourable.

# Step 6: Glaze the Cookies

Drizzle the glaze over each cookie and let it set for a few minutes before serving.

These cookies are the perfect blend of fall flavors and chewy textures‚Äîpair them with a warm cup of tea or coffee for ultimate coziness! ‚òïüç™
