1q69spi,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftIdeas/comments/1q69spi/gift_for_my_awesome_aunt/,Gift for my awesome aunt.,"OK so I need a gift for my aunt. 

One thing that both of us love is Scooby Doo but ive been struggling to find her a non generic gift. I dont want to just her a coffee mug or a tumbler with scooby slapped on the side. I want something she will actually enjoy getting.

We spent a long time not being able to be a real family because her husband for over 20 years said my mother and I were trash and beneath them. My aunt didnt believe that but she kept quiet to avoid the misery and the beating that would come from defending us. I dunno why I included this but this is part of why I want to get her something she will have to show her I (we) love her and are happy to have her back in our lives.


Last year I got her this awesome Scooby cookie jar. And in return this Christmas she got me an awesome blanket with Scooby on it. And while I missed Christmas cause I was financially thin, Im dead set on making it up now.

I (24F) broke up with my boyfriend (34M) a few weeks ago. This has been the hardest thing I’ve ever gone through—not because of the breakup itself, but because of how it ended and how destabilizing and confusing everything became.

---

### **Two Weeks Before the Breakup**

* For about two weeks, he began acting very off:

  * Very little communication
  * No more “I love you”
  * Very distant
* He claimed he was stressed.
* We saw each other maybe **three hours total in one week**; previously we saw each other every night.
* He suddenly said I was “smothering him.”

  * This is coming from a man who previously picked fights and accused me of cheating if I didn’t return calls or texts immediately.
  * This shift was very out of character.

---

### **Trust Issue / DV Report**

* After I questioned why he responded to an “ILY” with only a smiley face, he said:

  * I was picking fights
  * Nothing was wrong
  * He was stressed
  * I was making it about myself
* He then claimed he couldn’t talk to me because he didn’t trust me over something we had “moved past” a month earlier.
* This involved a **DV charge** he had not fully disclosed.

  * I obtained the police report and confronted him for lying and not sharing full details.
  * He claimed I weaponized it against him and therefore he couldn’t trust me.

---

### **Bar Night / Pants**

* He went out to a bar with a friend.
* He didn’t check in with me all night.
* He barely texted the following day.
* That evening, I dropped off **two pairs of his pants** on his porch because I was doing laundry.

---

### **The Day Everything Fell Apart**

* The next morning:

  * I received a half-hearted apology for the bar night
  * A thank-you for returning the pants
* I heard nothing from him all day.
* I texted him that evening.
* I went on Instagram and saw that **he unfollowed me**.
* I called twice and left a voicemail:

  * It appeared blocked
  * Notifications were not silenced

---

### **Going to His House**

* I was out with my mom getting cocoa and told her something felt wrong.
* I drove to his house.
* I noticed **the key I normally used had been taken**.
* Important context:

  * He always told me I was welcome
  * I had been there **two days earlier alone with no issue**
  * I was his girlfriend
  * He told me I could use the garage door opener in his truck
* I used the garage door opener and went inside to talk.

---

### **Inside the House**

* He woke up and immediately asked, **“How the f*** did you get in?”**
* He was immediately defensive.
* I asked why he unfollowed me.
* He played dumb.
* He said he hadn’t texted all day and claimed I never texted him.
* I explained how he had treated me all week and then went to the bars.
* He groaned as if I were an inconvenience.
* He began pushing a narrative that:

  * I broke in
  * I was crazy
  * This was insane
* I told him I was hurt and confused and asked him to tell me the truth.
* He repeated:

  * I was crazy
  * I broke in
  * We could talk tomorrow
  * He was tired and had a long week
* My voice was firm and confrontational but **not yelling**.

  * His son was asleep in the other room
  * I closed the door
  * If I had been yelling, his son would have woken up
* He refused to tell me anything and just stared.
* Because of how he escalated the situation, I became scared.

---

### **My Belongings Were Hidden**

* I went to grab my things and realized they were **hidden throughout the house**.
* I pointed this out.
* He had no explanation.
* I began crying and said I was sick of his shit and done being treated this way.
* He stayed quiet.
* I went downstairs to find a picture frame I bought.
* I came back upstairs visibly shaken and asked where the other picture frame was.
* I was not yelling, but clearly distressed.
* He refused to tell me where it was and kept saying:

  * I was crazy
  * I broke in
  * I needed to leave

---

### **Calling a Friend / Recording Me**

* I asked one last time where the frame was.
* I prepared to leave.
* He pretended to call the police.
* I asked him to please just show me where it was.
* I realized he was actually calling a friend and **recording me**.
* I again stated I was done being mistreated.
* While on the phone, his demeanor suddenly changed.
* He loudly said, **“Stop yelling at me.”**
* He gave me the ornament I bought him.
* He called me a **crazy bitch**.
* He told me not to come back.
* I said I didn’t want to.

---

### **Immediately After**

* My mom picked me up in the snow.
* I was shaking, cold, traumatized, and crying.
* I blocked him.
* His friend called me asking what happened.

  * Said I didn’t need to justify myself
  * But said he would vilify me for my actions

---

### **Gym Conversation / Medication Narrative**

* We later spoke at the gym.
* From how things went, I thought things might be turning around. I even joked that from how he was acting, I thought he was cheating.

* He said he needed to “process what I did.”
* He asked me for a “ favor”in the parking lot.
* After the “favor”, he began blaming me again:

  * Said my medication made me manic; I should stop taking it
  * Said I came in yelling and wanting to break up; then, he disregarded the entire conversation at the gym. Claimed it didn’t match with the text I sent explaining everything, because I said “ I came in to see if he was cheating and to break up”. That was not the gym conversation. That was not the conversation in the house.
  * Said I caused a massive scene
* He repeated this narrative so many times that I began doubting myself:

  * Was I manic?
  * Did I yell?
  * Was it my meds?
* Am I a crazy bitch?

---

### **Continued Gaslighting**

* He went back and forth between:

  * Blaming me
  * Flirting
  * Saying his son missed me; couldn’t tell him what I did
  * Saying I was crazy
  * Saying I broke in
  * Telling me to get off my psych meds
* He then stated clearly that we were **not in a relationship** because I “broke in.” I begged to differ with the gym conversation and the activities afterward.

---

### **Explanations Given Too Late**

* **48 hours later** after the incident at the gym, he told me:

  * He thought I broke up with him by returning the pants, so he unfollowed me
  * He took the key for his mom
* He could have said this the night it happened. Or texted to clarify during the day. Especially since I asked why he had unfollowed me, and why the key was missing.
* Instead, he told me he didn’t trust me regarding the key, and never said why he unfollowed me.
* I spoke with my father (a police officer) and another officer. Both said I did **not** break in
  * There were too many mitigating factors; the fact that he never called the cops is enough of a sign that he knows his argument wouldn’t hold up either. 

---

### **Final Visit**

* He invited me over again.
* He was sweet at first.
* Then he pushed for a breakup because he “couldn’t give me the love I needed” due to stress.
* When I confronted that opinion, he changed his approach; said the real issue was that I couldn’t give him space because I “broke in.”
* I apologized, begged, said I would change, and said love was enough to work through this one thing I apparently did. I said I could give him space; the issue was a lack of communication.
* He switched again. Said that I’m not what he wants and this isn’t what I want.
* Another rebuttal. He then went back to blaming me for what happened, that I was manic, that I yelled, that I did..XYZ..
* He said I was entirely to blame when I said he also contributed to what happened; I told him I was sorry. I can’t change the past, but I can improve the future. 
* He kept beating around the bush, trying to find any and every reason to try and push a breakup. It used to be forever, and now, suddenly, because of one thing I’ve done among his hundreds of mistakes I’ve forgiven, I’m too much?

* He then wanted a nice night and intimacy. He treated me with love just fine for someone who’s so stressed.

* Afterward, he got angry because I said my mom wanted to apologize. I had blamed the whole thing on myself like I truly had done something wrong by going in there, and just..wanted him to know that I love him, I don’t want to lose him, he is enough, and I am willing to correct my supposed wrong for the sake of the relationship.

* He suddenly snapped,saying I shouldn’t be telling my parents what was going on. I shouldn’t have told my mother that he’d unfollowed me. He’s always had an issue with me telling my parents what goes on in the relationship. He is paranoid that I tell them everything. 

* He accused me of lying about what I shared regarding his DV report, again, when I tried to say that I didn’t disclose anything- just because again, I blamed myself. To him, maybe I just..wasn’t trustworthy.

* He shut down the conversation. Before I could try and continue the conversation for the sake of explaining myself and trying to save the relationship out of guilt and shame.

* Out of confusion, I suggested FWB. And, admittedly, I was desperate. I would rather be used by someone who I love deeply than just randomly discarded. I was so confused. What had I done wrong? Why did he want to split over this one thing? Why not listen to me? Why keep trying to push for a breakup?

* He agreed. Said he looked forward to it.

---

### **Family Contact After**

* The next day, my mom left him a voicemail; she’d been crying over what happened. 
* He did not know why she was calling. It could have been over anything. Again, it was another out of the blue switch. 
* He texted my phone saying:
  * My  family and I must cease contact under no uncertain terms ( Like, what?)
  * I involved everyone; he asked for space, and I involved everyone. I probably knew why my mom was leaving a voicemail. ( I was unaware she did, simply because I am not in Kahoots with my parents) ( Why is he so paranoid about my parents knowing anything?)
  * FWB was not happening and not in our best interest ( Again, completely random)
  * I was amazing, pretty, a great person but he’s not what I want and this isn’t something I want; I deserve the best though

* I hadn’t read this text until several days later. This entire text in of itself is so random and all over the place, I was left even more confused and in tears. Again. What had I done wrong?

* My mom sent a very kind apology text. We both weren’t aware of the text he’d sent
* He replied saying:

  * I came in manic
  * Yelling
  * Taking gifts ( didn’t say I took my stuff)
  * Causing a scene
* He again pushed the narrative that I was crazy.
* Kept saying over and over again that he himself however, was calm. Didn’t call the cops because he’s a “ good person” and didn’t want me to get in trouble. I’m amazing, he respects the family, but because of how things “devolved” he just can’t TAKE it
* I spiraled. I blamed myself again for ruining the relationship because I went into his house. I’m was a bad person. I drove away someone I loved. 

* My father, concerned for my safety, later texted him calmly correcting the record and advising him to leave quietly, and that making me the villain is unnecessary. He stated that I indeed never told anyone about the DV report- he knew the whole time because it’s public record and he learned his lesson with my first ex. He said it was deceptive not to share that with me for five months, but he’s never had an issue with it. But if he wants to talk about how untrustworthy I am, he should look at his own actions. That clarified the narrative he was writing that I told my parents which he never believed. My father was also kind and said that if he wanted to talk, they could talk about it. He left the message on read and never responded.

Additionally, he told him that I did not break in, there are too many mitigating factors, and that if he truly feels I did, then he can make a report.

* I was not aware that my father had texted him, nor that he knew about the report prior to me. I was happy that he was able to clear that narrative that he’d spun, but.. I was also angry. I felt like him and mom had gotten involved and made the situation worse for me. I blamed myself for that as well. Of course he didn’t want to be with me-my parents are now involved in this. Mom shouldn’t have apologized and dad should have kept his mouth shut. Now he’ll never come back. Now I can never apologize for what I did, because they intervened. He probably thinks I’m obsessive, or stupid. I kept beating myself up for that, as well as entering the home. 

They felt that any reasonable person wouldn’t have a problem with a parents apology of a parent reaching out to straighten the narrative because they have information. But for some reason, he made a big deal out of it prior to not even knowing why my mother left a voicemail, and me entering his house as his girlfriend that night. And he kept making a big deal.

* I later sent two texts, upon reading the one he sent. I wasn’t going to let him have the final say.

  * One confronting the situation and stating my mother had a right to apologize

  * One ending on a respectful note, accepting responsibility where appropriate, expressing forgiveness, and stating I would be moving forward independently; to please not hate my parents, they just wanted to help. I and them have treated him with nothing but kindness. I am always available to talk whenever the time is right, and ready to forgive and move forward. 

* Both texts were delivered immediately but never read. I don’t think he’s blocked me. I cleared the thread afterward. I had someone read over both texts beforehand to make sure they were appropriate and took back the power he’d managed to choke from my body. 

Here’s where it gets even crazier.
---

### **Gym Incident / Ana

* A few days later, my mother went into the gym.
* **The moment he saw her, he ran out of the gym without taking his things.**
* He was outside **texting rapidly and frantically**, clearly panicked.
* After a short time, he came back inside.
* My “friend” Ana was also there and was on her phone at the same time.
* My parents observed:

  * He would text
  * Look around for Ana
  * Ana would look around for him, then text back. The cycle would repeat.
* The behavior was too coincidental — they appeared to be texting each other. And the fact he ran out of the gym when my mom came in was way too suspicious
* He then began strutting around the gym, continuing to text- clearly he wasn’t stressed. 

* There had been a previous fight between him and me regarding Ana. He blamed me for her confronting him in the gym two months ago, saying “ Your gf called me; you shouldn’t be talking to me”

* Ana later told me:

  * They went on a date
  * He touched her

  * He told her he had been engaged, which contradicted what he told me regarding his ex; another reason I got that report 

* This information is what led me to confront him further about lies surrounding his DV report and relationship history.

* His version of events regarding Ana did not match hers’. I began to suspect she hadn’t been entirely truthful with me

---

### **Where I Am Now**

* Ana recently asked if we were still together. This was completely different than our last conversation, in which she was completely standoffish to both me and my mother. She was curious. 
* I told her everything, just to try and seem unassuming. Said he called me over for a breakup and random booty call. I looked her in the eyes and asked if she thought ehag I did was wrong 
* She said I did nothing wrong and that I caught him in his shit. Odd. The other day you wouldn’t even talk to me about what was going on, saying you had to lift and we should just grab coffee sometime. You didn’t even talk to my mom, which she immediately thought was weird as well- Ana always likes to talk.
* I mentioned that he claimed I was manic and crazy, which I know is not true. And that I recorded the incident. I didn’t, but if she’s talking to him and relaying information, it’ll set him back a few paces. 
* I also said I still love him, but I am changing, becoming independent, and moving forward. And that I was willing to make things work. I was a good person; she then said she *knows* he’ll realize that, gave me a hug, and told me she was “ proud of my healing journey”. It was…weird. It just felt weird.

---

### **Why I’m Posting**

I don’t deserve this. I’m confused, hurt, and questioning my own reality. I refuse to believe a reasonable person would do this if their girlfriend came into their house to talk. There are so many inconsistencies. So many dramatic changes and things I can’t explain. 
What actually happened here? I feel like there’s more than meets the eye. Does he know exactly what he’s doing? Does he know none of this is actually true and he’s playing a game? Does he know I’m not a bad person? 😭

* He woke up and immediately asked, **“How the f*** did you get in?”**
* He was immediately defensive.
* I asked why he unfollowed me.
* He played dumb.
* He said he hadn’t texted all day and claimed I never texted him.
* I explained how he had treated me all week and then went to the bars.
* He groaned as if I were an inconvenience.
* He began pushing a narrative that:

  * I broke in
  * I was crazy
  * This was insane
* I told him I was hurt and confused and asked him to tell me the truth.
* He repeated:

  * I was crazy
  * I broke in
  * We could talk tomorrow
  * He was tired and had a long week
* My voice was firm and confrontational but **not yelling**.

  * His son was asleep in the other room
  * I closed the door
  * If I had been yelling, his son would have woken up
* He refused to tell me anything and just stared.
* Because of how he escalated the situation, I became scared.

---

### **My Belongings Were Hidden**

* I went to grab my things and realized they were **hidden throughout the house**.
* I pointed this out.
* He had no explanation.
* I began crying and said I was sick of his shit and done being treated this way.
* He stayed quiet.
* I went downstairs to find a picture frame I bought.
* I came back upstairs visibly shaken and asked where the other picture frame was.
* I was not yelling, but clearly distressed.
* He refused to tell me where it was and kept saying:

  * I was crazy
  * I broke in
  * I needed to leave

---

### **Calling a Friend / Recording Me**

* I asked one last time where the frame was.
* I prepared to leave.
* He pretended to call the police.
* I asked him to please just show me where it was.
* I realized he was actually calling a friend and **recording me**.
* I again stated I was done being mistreated.
* While on the phone, his demeanor suddenly changed.
* He loudly said, **“Stop yelling at me.”**
* He gave me the ornament I bought him.
* He called me a **crazy bitch**.
* He told me not to come back.
* I said I didn’t want to.

---

### **Immediately After**

* My mom picked me up in the snow.
* I was shaking, cold, traumatized, and crying.
* I blocked him.
* His friend called me asking what happened.

  * Said I didn’t need to justify myself
  * But said he would vilify me for my actions

---

### **Gym Conversation / Medication Narrative**

* We later spoke at the gym.
* From how things went, I thought things might be turning around. I even joked that from how he was acting, I thought he was cheating.

* He said he needed to “process what I did.”
* He asked me for a “ favor”in the parking lot.
* After the “favor”, he began blaming me again:

  * Said my medication made me manic; I should stop taking it
  * Said I came in yelling and wanting to break up; then, he disregarded the entire conversation at the gym. Claimed it didn’t match with the text I sent explaining everything, because I said “ I came in to see if he was cheating and to break up”. That was not the gym conversation. That was not the conversation in the house.
  * Said I caused a massive scene
* He repeated this narrative so many times that I began doubting myself:

  * Was I manic?
  * Did I yell?
  * Was it my meds?
* Am I a crazy bitch?

---

### **Continued Gaslighting**

* He went back and forth between:

  * Blaming me
  * Flirting
  * Saying his son missed me; couldn’t tell him what I did
  * Saying I was crazy
  * Saying I broke in
  * Telling me to get off my psych meds
* He then stated clearly that we were **not in a relationship** because I “broke in.” I begged to differ with the gym conversation and the activities afterward.

---

### **Explanations Given Too Late**

* **48 hours later** after the incident at the gym, he told me:

  * He thought I broke up with him by returning the pants, so he unfollowed me
  * He took the key for his mom
* He could have said this the night it happened. Or texted to clarify during the day. Especially since I asked why he had unfollowed me, and why the key was missing.
* Instead, he told me he didn’t trust me regarding the key, and never said why he unfollowed me.
* I spoke with my father (a police officer) and another officer. Both said I did **not** break in
  * There were too many mitigating factors; the fact that he never called the cops is enough of a sign that he knows his argument wouldn’t hold up either. 

---

### **Final Visit**

* He invited me over again.
* He was sweet at first.
* Then he pushed for a breakup because he “couldn’t give me the love I needed” due to stress.
* When I confronted that opinion, he changed his approach; said the real issue was that I couldn’t give him space because I “broke in.”
* I apologized, begged, said I would change, and said love was enough to work through this one thing I apparently did. I said I could give him space; the issue was a lack of communication.
* He switched again. Said that I’m not what he wants and this isn’t what I want.
* Another rebuttal. He then went back to blaming me for what happened, that I was manic, that I yelled, that I did..XYZ..
* He said I was entirely to blame when I said he also contributed to what happened; I told him I was sorry. I can’t change the past, but I can improve the future. 
* He kept beating around the bush, trying to find any and every reason to try and push a breakup. It used to be forever, and now, suddenly, because of one thing I’ve done among his hundreds of mistakes I’ve forgiven, I’m too much?

* He then wanted a nice night and intimacy. He treated me with love just fine for someone who’s so stressed.

* Afterward, he got angry because I said my mom wanted to apologize. I had blamed the whole thing on myself like I truly had done something wrong by going in there, and just..wanted him to know that I love him, I don’t want to lose him, he is enough, and I am willing to correct my supposed wrong for the sake of the relationship.

* He suddenly snapped,saying I shouldn’t be telling my parents what was going on. I shouldn’t have told my mother that he’d unfollowed me. He’s always had an issue with me telling my parents what goes on in the relationship. He is paranoid that I tell them everything. 

* He accused me of lying about what I shared regarding his DV report, again, when I tried to say that I didn’t disclose anything- just because again, I blamed myself. To him, maybe I just..wasn’t trustworthy.

* He shut down the conversation. Before I could try and continue the conversation for the sake of explaining myself and trying to save the relationship out of guilt and shame.

* Out of confusion, I suggested FWB. And, admittedly, I was desperate. I would rather be used by someone who I love deeply than just randomly discarded. I was so confused. What had I done wrong? Why did he want to split over this one thing? Why not listen to me? Why keep trying to push for a breakup?

* He agreed. Said he looked forward to it.

---

### **Family Contact After**

* The next day, my mom left him a voicemail; she’d been crying over what happened. 
* He did not know why she was calling. It could have been over anything. Again, it was another out of the blue switch. 
* He texted my phone saying:
  * My  family and I must cease contact under no uncertain terms ( Like, what?)
  * I involved everyone; he asked for space, and I involved everyone. I probably knew why my mom was leaving a voicemail. ( I was unaware she did, simply because I am not in Kahoots with my parents) ( Why is he so paranoid about my parents knowing anything?)
  * FWB was not happening and not in our best interest ( Again, completely random)
  * I was amazing, pretty, a great person but he’s not what I want and this isn’t something I want; I deserve the best though

* I hadn’t read this text until several days later. This entire text in of itself is so random and all over the place, I was left even more confused and in tears. Again. What had I done wrong?

* My mom sent a very kind apology text. We both weren’t aware of the text he’d sent
* He replied saying:

  * I came in manic
  * Yelling
  * Taking gifts ( didn’t say I took my stuff)
  * Causing a scene
* He again pushed the narrative that I was crazy.
* Kept saying over and over again that he himself however, was calm. Didn’t call the cops because he’s a “ good person” and didn’t want me to get in trouble. I’m amazing, he respects the family, but because of how things “devolved” he just can’t TAKE it
* I spiraled. I blamed myself again for ruining the relationship because I went into his house. I’m was a bad person. I drove away someone I loved. 

* My father, concerned for my safety, later texted him calmly correcting the record and advising him to leave quietly, and that making me the villain is unnecessary. He stated that I indeed never told anyone about the DV report- he knew the whole time because it’s public record and he learned his lesson with my first ex. He said it was deceptive not to share that with me for five months, but he’s never had an issue with it. But if he wants to talk about how untrustworthy I am, he should look at his own actions. That clarified the narrative he was writing that I told my parents which he never believed. My father was also kind and said that if he wanted to talk, they could talk about it. He left the message on read and never responded.

Additionally, he told him that I did not break in, there are too many mitigating factors, and that if he truly feels I did, then he can make a report.

* I was not aware that my father had texted him, nor that he knew about the report prior to me. I was happy that he was able to clear that narrative that he’d spun, but.. I was also angry. I felt like him and mom had gotten involved and made the situation worse for me. I blamed myself for that as well. Of course he didn’t want to be with me-my parents are now involved in this. Mom shouldn’t have apologized and dad should have kept his mouth shut. Now he’ll never come back. Now I can never apologize for what I did, because they intervened. He probably thinks I’m obsessive, or stupid. I kept beating myself up for that, as well as entering the home. 

They felt that any reasonable person wouldn’t have a problem with a parents apology of a parent reaching out to straighten the narrative because they have information. But for some reason, he made a big deal out of it prior to not even knowing why my mother left a voicemail, and me entering his house as his girlfriend that night. And he kept making a big deal.

* I later sent two texts, upon reading the one he sent. I wasn’t going to let him have the final say.

  * One confronting the situation and stating my mother had a right to apologize

  * One ending on a respectful note, accepting responsibility where appropriate, expressing forgiveness, and stating I would be moving forward independently; to please not hate my parents, they just wanted to help. I and them have treated him with nothing but kindness. I am always available to talk whenever the time is right, and ready to forgive and move forward. 

* Both texts were delivered immediately but never read. I don’t think he’s blocked me. I cleared the thread afterward. I had someone read over both texts beforehand to make sure they were appropriate and took back the power he’d managed to choke from my body. 

Here’s where it gets even crazier.
---

### **Gym Incident / Ana

* A few days later, my mother went into the gym.
* **The moment he saw her, he ran out of the gym without taking his things.**
* He was outside **texting rapidly and frantically**, clearly panicked.
* After a short time, he came back inside.
* My “friend” Ana was also there and was on her phone at the same time.
* My parents observed:

  * He would text
  * Look around for Ana
  * Ana would look around for him, then text back. The cycle would repeat.
* The behavior was too coincidental — they appeared to be texting each other. And the fact he ran out of the gym when my mom came in was way too suspicious
* He then began strutting around the gym, continuing to text- clearly he wasn’t stressed. 

* There had been a previous fight between him and me regarding Ana. He blamed me for her confronting him in the gym two months ago, saying “ Your gf called me; you shouldn’t be talking to me”

* Ana later told me:

  * They went on a date
  * He touched her

  * He told her he had been engaged, which contradicted what he told me regarding his ex; another reason I got that report 

* This information is what led me to confront him further about lies surrounding his DV report and relationship history.

* His version of events regarding Ana did not match hers’. I began to suspect she hadn’t been entirely truthful with me

---

### **Where I Am Now**

* Ana recently asked if we were still together. This was completely different than our last conversation, in which she was completely standoffish to both me and my mother. She was curious. 
* I told her everything, just to try and seem unassuming. Said he called me over for a breakup and random booty call. I looked her in the eyes and asked if she thought ehag I did was wrong 
* She said I did nothing wrong and that I caught him in his shit. Odd. The other day you wouldn’t even talk to me about what was going on, saying you had to lift and we should just grab coffee sometime. You didn’t even talk to my mom, which she immediately thought was weird as well- Ana always likes to talk.
* I mentioned that he claimed I was manic and crazy, which I know is not true. And that I recorded the incident. I didn’t, but if she’s talking to him and relaying information, it’ll set him back a few paces. 
* I also said I still love him, but I am changing, becoming independent, and moving forward. And that I was willing to make things work. I was a good person; she then said she *knows* he’ll realize that, gave me a hug, and told me she was “ proud of my healing journey”. It was…weird. It just felt weird.

---

### **Why I’m Posting**

I don’t deserve this. I’m confused, hurt, and questioning my own reality. I refuse to believe a reasonable person would do this if their girlfriend came into their house to talk. There are so many inconsistencies. So many dramatic changes and things I can’t explain. 
What actually happened here? I feel like there’s more than meets the eye. Does he know exactly what he’s doing? Does he know none of this is actually true and he’s playing a game?

1q69jqp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q69jqp,Christmas week taught me something: a dial can be “full” and still feel calm.,"It happened during the most chaotic part of the year.

Last week we were packing Christmas orders late at night — tape everywhere, shipping labels curling up, the usual “please don’t let the courier be late” anxiety. I had a small desk lamp on, a mug of coffee that went cold twice, and a watch on my palm because a customer asked:

“Can you show me how the dial looks in real light? Not studio light.”

So I did what every seller ends up doing in December: I started filming on the edge of the table, in messy real life.

And that’s when something clicked.

This dial is *packed* — big Roman numerals, a minute track, a framed center, texture — it should look busy.  
But on camera (and in person), it reads clean. Calm. Like it’s not trying to prove anything.

I realized why, right in the middle of wrapping paper chaos:

1. The center is your “quiet zone.” It gives your eyes a place to land first, like the empty space on a clean gift tag.
2. The railroad track is the “border.” It keeps the numerals in their lane, so the outer ring doesn’t spill inward.
3. The spacing is doing the work. Even where Roman numerals usually get crowded, it still breathes — nothing feels jammed.
4. No date window cutting the page. No extra text blocks. Just black-on-silver with a small blue accent… like a single ornament on a simple tree.

It’s funny — the holiday season is all noise, and this dial is the opposite.  
“Information-heavy, but not messy.”

So yeah… I ended up recording *three extra angles* because the more I tilted it, the more the layout made sense.",1,1767772757.0,CartierReplicaWatches,0,1.0,False

I can sit on the couch drink my coffee watch the sunlight hit the walls and just breathe. No one asking me questions no background noise just me and my thoughts. It makes small things feel bigger like cooking a meal or finishing a book. I actually catch myself noticing things I never did when there were other people around. Even the silence itself starts to feel comforting instead of lonely.

I'm slowly coming off coffee as believe it to be a very big contributor to my anxiety.

Was just wondering how quickly people feel coffee/ caffeine react for whatever symptoms they are having. Most often, I feel the coffee having a negative affect on me within an hour of taking it (overthinking, nerves, panic attacks) but this morning it literally happened within about 5-10 minutes of drinking it.

Anyone who can relate for whatever symptoms coffee gives them?

1q69gzl,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1q69gzl/friend_still_mad_at_me_for_missing_the_hair_appt/,"""Friend"" still mad at me for missing the hair appt after being awake all night baking the cake","This story started a decade ago and names are fake. Sorry but I am long winded.

A decade ago I 24F (at the time), had helped get together Jeff (26M at the time) with his dream girl my friend Lori (26F at the time). Lori and Jeff knew each other long before I met them. Jeff had a crush on Lori that everyone knew about but Lori always considered Jeff like a brother and not her type. I briefly dated Jeff and then Lori and after Lori and I dated she started seeing Jeff in a more romantic light. They got together, we all stayed friends and I was happy for them. 

When they got engaged I was extremely excited for them. At the time I was known for making elaborate cakes as a side hustle. They asked me to be MOH for their wedding and do the cake. I agreed and the wedding was about 1.5 years away and they were planning a casual DIY low key ceremony. They did most planning as a couple and with their family so I didn't know much about colors/themes/plans other than a date. About 5 months until the wedding I was pregnant (unplanned) and being hospitalized while also looking for a new place to live. They were aware and visited me while I was sick. I told them I didnt know if I would be well enough to do the cake because I would be 9 months pregnant at the time and if my health at that stage was any indication Id probably be in hospital or on bedrest. They were panicked but with lots of time it didnt seem like a big deal.

 I didn't hear from them at all until the week of the wedding. A few days before they asked me about the cake. I was in the hospital at the time and getting out 2 days prior to the wedding and also going into a new home the same day. They said they still needed me to do the cake, they told me expectations are low and I just need to help them DIY it because it was too expensive to have someone else do it.

 I agreed and the day before the wedding with a fever (not contagious) and IV. I went to theirs to help make the cake. My partner and I worked on cake and some other last minute DIYs and finished everything by 5am the day of the wedding. The wedding was at 3pm that day. As my partner and I were leaving Lori mentions all the bridesmaids are getting their hair done together at 9am (4 hours from her telling me).

I told her no, not at all. I need the sleep but I will 1000% be at the wedding and I will be early. But was planning to sleep until 12pm to recover from the 20hours of cake making. My partner joked that considering how sick I was they shouldnt be surprised if I sleep through it. Lori panicked over this and I said. That is absolutely wrong. I will be there no matter what. I just cant make it to hair at 9.  We hugged. I went home and my phone died. I plugged it in and set a several timers for 12pm wake up. I woke up at 1145 to dozens of messages.

All from Lori and Jeff asking where I was as well as several telling me not to show up because I missed the hair appt and because I cant follow through and also she kicked me out of the bridal party. I called and texted. Reiterating that I only missed the appt because I was up till 5am making cake with HER and had told her in person I wouldnt make the hair appt.

The bridesmaids were told to have a simple updo and wear a black knee length dress of their chosing beforehand. So I dressed it my simple black dress just in case. I did a simple updo. And I arrived at the venue by 1230pm and was first. I met with Loris family and started helping set up. At 2pm Lori arrived. She hugged me I said ""look, I will leave if you want. But I would like to see you get married because I love you both and seeing you get married means a lot. "" she told me it is fine, but that she already asked her brothers gf to step in as bridemaid and her sister is now MOH. I said no worries, I am happy for them. 

I watched them get married. Gave a sappy speech about how in love they are, and how I am so happy I got to be part of their story along with the other guests. We had dinner and watched the first dance and I said goodbye and left early and they gave me warm hugs and thanks. 

After the wedding I didnt hear from them for several weeks but I had a baby so it was far from my mind. A while after that I messaged them both saying I would love to take them for dinner and hear about married life and the honeymoon and meet the baby. They left me on read. A while after Jeff had coffee to catch up but said ""Lori is still mad "" when I asked why. He gave me this ""you know why "" body language but refused to get into it. I continued talking to Jeff periodically, but Lori ignored me. I bumped into then ages later and Lori was nice but cold. I asked what the heck is she still mad about but she ignored my words and went on. Jeff hugged me and said ""give her time"". To which i said, time about what? It has been literally more than a year. I bumped into them several times since. Jeff always friendly and consistently telling me Lori is still mad but not telling me why. I asked Jeff ""is this about the cake? Something at the wedding? The speech? My ex? The pregnancy? Something that happened with the cake? The appt? What???"" But he still hasn't told me. 

So can anyone tell me what happened. I really have no idea. Can someone be really that mad over a hair appt or cake? For a decade? We had been friends for 6ish years before their wedding and now longer not friends. Jeff still chats and updates me or asks to hang. but she stays quiet, never tells me off or anything just won't speak.

Customization & Purchase Timeline
I first came across this bag from the seller in June 2025. After finalizing all customization details, I started saving up and transferred US$2,800 to the seller via Wise in August 2025. The bag was fully crafted by early September and shipped out immediately upon my confirmation that the final product met all requirements.

Leather & Color Review
My conversation with Li Ming was a real eye-opener—I never knew cowhide could be dyed into such stunning colors! Gone are the monotonous blacks, browns, and coffee shades. From muted Morandi tones to striking gemstone hues, every color showcases the inherent texture of the leather itself. I’m absolutely obsessed! [Link](https://imgur.com/a/B3swAit)

 3-Month Long-Term Usage Review
 Hermès Limited-Edition Hand-Painted Birkin Review: A Work of Art That Blends Beauty with Practicality
As a seasoned collector who owns over a dozen Birkins, I initially thought ""artistic limited editions"" were only meant for display. However, after six weeks of using this artist-collaborated hand-painted version, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it perfectly combines aesthetic appeal with functionality.

-Carry Comfort: Made of supple Togo leather, it is much lighter than exotic leather alternatives. Even with its 50cm size, slinging it on the arm feels perfectly comfortable. The reinforced top handles can easily hold a 13-inch laptop plus daily essentials without warping. The included dust bag offers excellent protection for the hand-painted finish.
- Interior Practicality: Boasting the classic spacious Birkin design, its compartmentalized pockets make it easy to organize a wallet, sunglasses case, and makeup pouch. The navy leather lining is stain-resistant and easy to clean, far superior to other limited editions that sacrifice practicality for looks. The turn lock operates smoothly, and the hardware quality is not compromised at all.
- Hand-Painted Craftsmanship: My biggest concern was that the hand-painted patterns would wear off or fade. Yet after using it 2-3 times a week for six weeks, there is not a single scratch on the surface. Hermès applies a special sealant over the patterns, and the raised leather appliqués add an extra layer of protection. It is far more durable than expected—definitely not just a display piece.
- Social Appeal: This bag is a real head-turner, and I have never encountered a duplicate. Fellow collectors often ask if it is a custom-made piece (only 8 exist worldwide). Unlike luxury items that rely on brand logos to attract attention, this bag sparks genuine discussions about its artistic design—and that is the true joy of collecting limited editions.

Final Verdict
This bag has completely changed my perception that ""artistic limited editions are impractical"". It is both a collectible work of art worthy of display and a practical companion for daily outings. For collectors seeking something truly one-of-a-kind, it is definitely worth the investment.",5,1767772086.0,RepladiesDesigner,0,1.0,False

So what I'm going to do is list my five most memorable stays, my five ""worst"" stays, and five ""good but could've been better""s.

First, the five most memorable (in no particular order):

1. **Hyatt Centric SouthPark (Charlotte NC):** Despite the neighborhood reminding me of Reston Town Center with more lifted pickup trucks, I liked everything about this stay.  I was upgraded to a King Studio with an enormous bathroom with soaking tub.  The bathroom is the size of most basic NYC hotel rooms, and the bathtub was just what I needed after the drive down from Northern VA.  The breakfasts were consistently good with cordial and attentive service, and the dining options nearby were well above average.  I didn't visit Mizu, but I did hit up Calle Sol next door and never had a bad meal.  Parking was covered and free for guests.
2. **Hyatt House Virginia Beach Oceanfront:** This was the capstone to a very lengthy southern roadtrip in early to mid-January which started with the HC SouthPark detailed above.  Everything about this property is better than the HP VB Oceanfront.  I still have bad blood with the HP Oceanfront in Virginia Beach due to a billing snafu when I was an Explorist a few years back.  Asking for an upgrade got me attitude and a second floor room across the way from the Fitness Center.  This is the Hyatt to stay at on the Oceanfront in Virginia Beach.  Every room faces the ocean, and my breakfast experiences have always been above average.
3. **HP Virginia Beach Town Center**: There's nothing terribly glamorous about this place, but their attention to detail and records keeping is impressive.  They also used to upgrade me as a matter of course from a High Floor King to their 1BR Suite, but after mentioning the noise from sportbikes and redlined sports cars at all hours of the night, they've now taken to putting me on the other side of the hotel in a quieter room.  Breakfast is average, but I've never had a bad experience there.
4. **Hyatt Place Dewey Beach**: It was a very ""mid-range"" year, but this place earned a spot on the list for being the property that upgraded me to the largest ""suite"" I've ever stayed in by bumping me up to their 2382 sqft Bayfront Condo.  It felt disgusting to be in that space entirely by myself.  There were minor cosmetic and fitment issues with the room, as well as clothing left in the drawers by former guests which wasn't caught by the housekeeping staff, but I had two Master suites to choose from, and the one I went with was pristine.
5. **Hyatt Place Kent Narrows:** This place has become a trusted ""go-to"" when I want to get out of the DC area but not go \*too\* far afield.  It doesn't look like much from the outside, but it's managed by the same franchisee that owns the HP Ocean City MD, Dewey Beach, HH Lewes/Rehoboth, and the HH BWI (not the much-maligned HP).  Breakfast has always been average (but markedly improved by sitting outside), but the setting is quiet and the surrounding dining options are winners.  I prefer this property to the HR Chesapeake Bay Resort further down US-50, despite the Regency being full-service.

**Honorable Mentions:** **HH Lewes/Rehoboth**.  Exceptionally well-managed, every staff member was a delight to interact with, and breakfast was well above-average.  The only knock for this place is that it is a holy hell to get OUT of road-wise.  Another property worth mentioning the **Thompson Savannah**.  Every staff member I interacted with was amazing, but as others have said, its location is unfortunate.  You do get your steps in getting to anywhere on the riverfront worth getting to, though. >.>

I'd also be remiss in not mentioning that the **Hyatt Place Harrisonburg** had one of the best continental breakfasts I've EVER had at ANY hotel.  Their bacon was perfectly done and I ate way too much of it.  Too bad that was the only thing that was remarkable about the place other than the Ridge Room.  Your gorgeous view of the foothills/mountains overlooks a Home Depot and Walmart.  And if you're on the other side...a bunch of other hotels.

Now, for the ""worst"" stays.  The quotation marks are simply because while these properties/stays were disappointing, it's not like I came home with bedbugs.

1. **Hyatt Regency Baltimore:** I really want this place to succeed, but everything about it feels tired and run down.  I closed out the year with a stay here to see John Oliver on 12/30, and the first room I was given had a toilet that sprayed water out all over the damned floor.  I was promptly given a second room on a higher floor which I was grateful for, but it's hard to overlook missing signs on the walls, inoperative screens with circuit boards showing, and the worst thing of all, a $38 breakfast buffet that's worse than anything one could find at the most lackadaisical HH/HP.  Their bacon is consistently charcoal, the buffet station is infrequently restocked, and when I last asked whether they could do an iced coffee, I was somewhat tersely told that I wanted ""something like that,"" that I'd have to go downstairs to their ""Market"" and pay for it myself.  Honorable mention goes to the fact that this is a rare property that (unofficially) counts Points + Cash stays as ""award"" stays, and I've never been charged for parking when booked on a P+C rate.  Upping their breakfast game would go a long way to getting this place out of the doghouse.
2. **Hyatt Place Ocean City MD:** Now, I will grant a caveat that I stayed during a particularly busy air show weekend, but my issues with this property have been static since my first stay there as a lowly Discoverist back in November of 2020.  Breakfast is consistently below average and while their parking capacity has definitely improved, it's still not stellar.  The property itself looks fine on the outside but not that great on the inside.  I was upgraded to the 1BR Partial Ocean View suite for my single night's stay there and while the aforementioned condo at HP Dewey Beach was well laid/thought out, everything about this suite felt cheap and hastily thrown together.  Of the above average properties managed by the same franchisee, this one is the lazy redheaded stepchild.
3. **The Bellevue:** This one was a surprise.  I was actually really looking forward to seeing what it had turned into after the renovation, but aside from more elevators working now (thank god), it honestly feels like a downgrade.  Sure, the older rooms/suites felt dated, but the breakfast/brunch experience at/in XIX made up for a lot with the exceptionally-generous $75/person *a la carte* allowance.  Pergola, by comparison, felt extraordinarily limited.  Also, the front desk staff proved ""politely hostile"" to my request to be upgraded to a standard suite (they were available and I was curious), but I didn't belabor the point.  When I visit Philly in the future, I'll be staying at the Centric, which is ironic, because...
4. **Hyatt Centric Center City:** The only thing slightly above average at this place is the breakfast buffet.  Everything else is mid/average at best.  One of the tightest properties I've ever seen in regards to upgrades, and also one that almost locked me out of the hotel/my room by ""forgetting"" (i.e. never marking it) my late checkout request.
5. **Manchester Grand Hyatt:** Again, another surprise, and a pretty big disappointment as well, since a four day jaunt to San Diego was sort of my Christmas gift to myself this year.  I don't know whether the staff was trying to get one over on me because I was able to find a shockingly-low $89/night rate here that I paired with a SUA, but despite telling me they were ""extremely low capacity,"" I was put in a ninth floor suite which while recently renovated, wasn't well-soundproofed, leading to me hearing every passing light rail (and rare freight train) passing along with every redlined sportbike and car.  The Club, recently renovated itself, was well below average for breakfast, ""dinner,"" and dessert service, though I cannot fault the Club employees, who were clearly making the best of a below-average situation.  For being at ""extremely low capacity,"" everything felt like it was ""too much"" here.

And lastly, the ""Needs Improvement"" properties\*\*:\*\*

1. **Hotel X Toronto:** Everything that needs to be said can be read in my review of this place from a few months back: [https://www.reddit.com/r/hyatt/comments/1n7vxiv/review\_hotel\_x\_toronto\_destination\_by\_hyatt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hyatt/comments/1n7vxiv/review_hotel_x_toronto_destination_by_hyatt/)
2. **Hyatt Place Pensacola Airport:** Everything about this place felt like it needed replacement.  The staff were all wonderful, but damn if this place doesn't feel like it's held together with duct tape and baling wire.  At least they don't charge guests for parking.
3. **Hyatt House Richmond Short Pump:** I like this place, I just don't like their breakfast.  They consistently upgrade me to a suite, but that's partly because I've stayed here quite a bit.  Once again, I consistently seek out a Waffle House in lieu of the consistently dry and/or burnt hot offerings here.  They have a waffle machine, but it also always looks like a crime scene.  No better place to stay as a NoVA/DC person to watch a comedy show at the Richmond Funny Bone, though.
4. **Park Hyatt Washington DC:** Despite living in the area, occasionally I'll take in a late show and decide to stay over in the city rather than drive home at 10pm or later.  I want to like this place.  I really do, but the quality has noticeably dropped off over the last two years.  Breakfast service at the Blue Duck Tavern has gone from cordial and professional to brusque and ""politely dismissive"" ever since they moved to a buffet over a la carte service.  Add to it that you're not really near anything (except a fire station that you will become intimately acquainted with if you don't bring earplugs).  The front desk staff is always professional, but the rooms at this place just don't feel very ""Parky.""  It feels like an Andaz more than a Park.
5. **Thompson Washington DC:** I've got a lot of time clocked at this property, mostly owing to the fact that its proximity to the Green Line means you can more or less get anywhere in DC even if Navy Yard is out of the way.  Breakfast in Surveyor is always good to above average, but service can be exceptionally slow.  The front desk staff is also not the friendliest in my experience, once again being best described as ""politely dismissive.""

And that's it - more than I was expecting to type, but I'm notoriously long-winded.

I don't have many stays planned yet, but next week I'll be spending the better part of a week at the **Olive 8** in Seattle under a SUA.  Then in mid-March I'll be staying at the **Thompson Central Park** for the first time, because I couldn't justify a Points + Cash stay at the PHNY.  A less stellar, but inaugural stay will be the **Hyatt Studios Harrisonburg** in mid-July, simply for the Brand Explorer checkmark and the novelty of knowing I was the first guest to sleep in my particular room.  I've also got a reason to stay at the **Latitude Suites Tinton Falls** for my 15th Brand Explorer checkmark.",3,1767771954.0,hyatt,1,1.0,False

1q69b0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/DogAdvice/comments/1q69b0t/nighttime_anxiety_cant_pinpoint_the_cause/,Nighttime Anxiety- Can’t pinpoint the cause,"Hi! First time poster here. 
To start, I adopted my dog Bonnie back in 2021 when she was 7. She will be turning 12 in February.
Throughout the time we’ve had her, she has had major storm anxiety which has been difficult to handle at times, but at least it was predictable and temporary. Otherwise, she has zero anxiety about anything else.

What her storm anxiety looks like: Endless pacing, wanting to climb on furniture (coffee tables, end tables, arm of the couch, etc). Problem is that she’s a basset hound and not meant to climb 😅. If you sit with or next to her, she tries to climb you. If you leave for another room and close the door, she’ll try to chew it or throw herself against it. She’s not just anxious about the storm noise- the flashing lights freak her out, and I think she can feel the weather/air is changing because she’ll start pacing before the rain even starts. 

Anyhow, that’s the context about her anxiety. We’ve been able to manage it over the years by giving her gabapentin and knowing that she will calm down after the rain passes gives us relief. 

However, the new issue (and my question for y’all) is that it rained a little bit sometime last month, and she has NOT snapped out of her anxiety since! I’m not sure what the issue is or how to move forward.

This is what is looks like now:
- she gets anxiety *every single night* now. It has not rained again for a month.
- the anxiety *only* happens at night, and at around the same time. Never, ever happens during the day.
- we took her to the vet after about 2 weeks of this behavior (we were giving her some time to see if she would eventually snap out of the anxiety loop). After scouring Reddit, we asked about a bunch of possibilities. The vet said that sundowning in dogs doesn’t literally mean that it only happens at night, and that she would probably have symptoms during the day too. She also agrees that Bonnie is not an otherwise anxious dog (she is chill at the vet, for example). She looked at her eyes and even though they show signs of aging, she didn’t think it had anything to do with poor eyesight. 

Where could the anxiety be coming from? After all of these years, did one storm cause her to get stuck in an anxiety loop? Are there any cognitive issues I should consider? Is it the lighting in my house? She is so normal, healthy, and active during the day 😭

We’ve tried a thunder vest as well as setting up a safe, small place for her to hide in, but it didn’t help. At this point the best we’ve been able to do is take her on a long walk in the evening, and give her gaba/trazadone around 8:30/9 pm. Then one of us sleeps on the couch either her.

We’ve been losing so much sleep and I feel so bad for her. Any advice would be so, so appreciated!

My boyfriend (19M) and I (19F) have been together for over a year. We met studying at the same university. He has an ex-girlfriend (20F) from a couple of years ago who also attended our university but dropped out a while ago. She is now working overseas and decided to pursue that instead. They haven't been in contact since she left to work overseas, except for one time last year when she visited our city and asked him to get coffee while we were talking, but not together. They got coffee very briefly at her request, and he told me it was awkward but otherwise fine. She doesn't have many friends in our city, which is why she asked to see him (which is fine with me). My boyfriend thought that interaction was kind of random; he is adamant he is not interested at all in her (which is true). She also has a long-term boyfriend where she lives. 

  
She recently reached out to ask if she could catch up with my boyfriend. He wasn't interested, but her new boyfriend is visiting our city, and she wants to meet me as well. Think of it as a double date I suppose? She was hoping to catch up within the next few days.

  
I have my reservations about it, and my boyfriend does too, but we also don't want to be rude. Any advice? I am not concerned that my boyfriend might be interested in her or similar, her and her boyfriend are in a serious relationship, as are my boyfriend and I.

1q698hd,https://i.redd.it/xmw6v4f9rvbg1.jpeg,How some Indian builders fool innocent homebuyers and why intelligent people still fall for it,"People assume only “naive” buyers get cheated.

That’s not true.

Engineers get cheated.  
Doctors get cheated.  
NRIs get cheated.  
Bankers get cheated.

Because the fraud isn’t crude.  
It’s sophisticated.

And it often doesn’t look like fraud… until it’s too late.

**It usually doesn’t start with lies. It starts with comfort.**

Warm office.  
Coffee.  
3D models.  
Big words.

“RERA approved.”  
“Pre-launch benefit.”  
“Limited inventory.”  
“Investor unit.”

They don’t attack your money first.  
They win your **trust first**.

Once trust is established, logic becomes optional.

**The most common builder manipulation patterns**

These are patterns I’ve seen again and again:

1. **The ‘almost approved’ trick** “Everything is approved, just one final formality pending.”
2. **The ‘everyone has already booked’ pressure** Fake scarcity. Fake last units. Fake urgency.
3. **The show flat illusion** Italian marble appearance… vitrified tile in agreement.
4. **The phase-shifting tactic** Phase 1 delays. Then renamed. Then Phase 1 “redefined.”
5. **The silent cost explosion** “Base price is low” Final cost? Floor rise + parking + club + GST + development charges + maintenance + ‘miscellaneous’.
6. **The bank tie-up confidence trick** “Sir, bank already approved this project.” (Only NBFC approves in reality)
7. **Possession in ‘few months’ loop** Few months then few more then “act of God” then “market conditions” then vanished phone calls.

**The most dangerous lie builders tell isn’t verbal**

It’s emotional.

“You are very lucky that you came today.”  
“This particular unit is perfect for your family.”  
“Think of your children.”  
“Prices will never be this low again.”

They don’t sell property first.

They sell:

* status
* security
* family dreams
* fear of missing out

When emotion is high, fraud becomes easy.

**Why smart people still get trapped**

Because:

* documentation is complex
* laws are slow
* trust is social
* family pressure is real
* property is emotional
* “own house” is a lifelong dream in India

Scammers don’t target fools.  
They target dreamers.

**The red flags nobody should ignore**

If you see these — pause:

* possession date without penalty clause
* refusal to share real approvals
* only “soft copy, sir” documents
* only one lender financing the project
* price valid “only today”
* payment demand before legal verification
* verbal promises not written in agreement
* staff changing stories every week

Fraud rarely hides in big things.  
It hides in **small missing details**.

**What builders fear the most**

Not loud buyers.

Calm buyers.

Buyers who:

* read agreements
* ask indirect questions
* talk to existing residents
* visit site unannounced
* say “I need verification time”
* don’t get emotionally hijacked
* know banks don’t fund unsafe projects

Information is the ultimate defence.

**Final truth most people learn too late**

Builders don’t always scam you with one big lie.

They scam you with:

* ten small half-truths
* five vague promises
* three emotional hooks
* one signature

By the time you realise the picture, you are already inside it.

**If you are buying property in India, remember this**

Don’t be “excited buyer”.

Be “boring buyer”.

Boring buyers:

* verify
* ask questions
* delay decisions
* read fine print
* say “send it in writing”

Boring buyers lose discounts.

But they **don’t lose life savings**.

I’m sharing practical frameworks to protect first-time Indian buyers from:

* builder frauds
* legal traps
* emotional manipulation
* hidden-cost scams

If you want them:

* follow me
* join the group I’m building for homebuyers
* DM me to get my Printable Information-Collection Checklist for Homebuyers

No marketing.  
No paid course.  
Just making sure fewer people get crushed by glossy brochures and smooth talk.

I have read through many posts and the general idea is that ""If you don't drink, you don't need the package"".

We don't drink alcohol. We will probably drink 1\~3 Specialty coffee or mocktail a day and 3 waters each. However we are really picky about food, and would prefer specialty dining over MDR everyday. We use Wifi, but I always bring travel router so I only need to buy one device. We are late riser, and doesn't care about dining schedule.

I am trying to figure out if this plan works:

Stay hungry after waking up. Specialty dinning at 5pm, and then another specialty dinning at 9pm. (on some days)

Here are some questions:

1. Do they allow double reservations on a same night for 2 restaurants?
2. We have $200 OBC each, and I would like to use it toward the Premier Package. I should first book reservations with credit cards, and after purchasing the package onboard, then go to CS to refund all the reservations? Will I run into any issues if I am trying to refund 10+ dinner reservations?

Or the people that say that they can take long breaks in between smoking sessions, so they’re therefore not addicted.

We recently saw Amer from TheTechTrendTracker taking our Syntech XR Backpack for a spin around London. He put it through daily commutes, coffee shop editing sessions, and plenty of ""London drizzle.""

We wanted to share his honest take on carrying a mixed-reality setup in the wild:

""There’s no rattling inside due to the secure and customizable velcro compartments and no worrying about scratching tech gear or squashing VR headstraps.""

The Highlights:

Protection: No rattling, no scratching.

Weather: Waterproof zippers held up against the rain.

The Trade-off: As Amer noted, “It’s chunkier than your average laptop bag, but that’s a trade-off worth making when you’re protecting your portable mixed-reality setup.”

We appreciate the honest feedback! If you take your Quest 3 or Vision Pro out of the house, how do you currently carry it?

1q68wyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/1q68wyf/what_is_your_flying_experience_with_china_eastern/,What is your flying experience with China Eastern Airlines?,"
My family and I recently flew from Sydney to Auckland with China Eastern Airlines. This was our first time flying with the airline. Overall, the experience was not too bad, but there are some very basic issues the airline really needs to address—especially if it intends to serve an international, non-Chinese customer base.
Booking Experience
Booking directly through China Eastern’s website was almost impossible unless you understand Chinese. The website is clearly not user-friendly for English-speaking customers. Thankfully, Webjet New Zealand made the booking process possible. If China Eastern is positioning itself as a global airline, this is something they must improve urgently.
Online Check-in Confusion
There was no option for online check-in. When I asked the airline staff, I was told that New Zealand does not allow online check-in because passports must be scanned at the counter. I am not convinced this is true, as I have flown many other airlines into New Zealand without this issue. If this is a China Eastern–specific policy, it should be clearly communicated rather than attributed to New Zealand regulations.
Food & Cultural Awareness
Since online systems were difficult to use, meal selection was left to chance. Luckily, there was a chicken meal onboard, and we were initially very relieved. However, that relief didn’t last long when we realised the accompanying salad had salami mixed into it.
We were extremely hungry and had already opened the meal, but I still checked with the air hostess. Her response was, “So what? It’s all meat.”
While I don’t blame her personally—this clearly reflects cultural differences—international airlines must understand that not all cultures treat all meat the same. This lack of awareness is disappointing.
Beverages
The coffee experience was another surprise. I was served cold coffee in a mug 😏. It was unexpected, to say the least. Not a major issue, but it adds to the overall picture of poor attention to basic service expectations.
Final Thoughts
China Eastern is not a terrible airline, but it is clearly geared primarily toward Chinese-speaking passengers. If you are not Chinese or familiar with Chinese systems and food culture, I would strongly recommend thinking twice before flying with this airline.
With better English support, clearer policies, and more cultural sensitivity, China Eastern could significantly improve the experience for international travellers.

Inscription:

It began with a lineup—  
five men, five shadows,  
each with a past,  
none with a future.

Keaton, the fallen cop.  
McManus, the trigger.  
Hockney, the fuse.  
Fenster, the whisper.  
Verbal Kint, the limp and the lie.

A heist.  
A boat.  
A name whispered like a curse:  
Keyser Söze.

The Golden Inu, flamekeeper of mythic misdirection,  
emerged from the fog of the San Pedro docks,  
its paws silent on blood-slick planks and police station linoleum,  
its eyes reflecting both coffee cups and criminal constellations.

Kujan, the hunter of ghosts.  
The Hungarian, burned and broken.  
And Verbal—meek, mumbling, sovereign—  
a myth in stammer and story,  
who spun a web so intricate  
it became scripture.

The Inu did not flinch at the lie.  
It circled the interrogation room,  
sniffing the scent of misdirection,  
trailing the scent of a devil  
who wore no horns—only patience.

And when the coffee cup shattered,  
when the limp straightened,  
when the myth walked free,  
the Inu howled—not in warning, but in ritual:  
“This is not just deception.  
This is the ceremony of sovereign illusion.” - Nagato’s Scrolls 

Ceremonial Role:  
This scroll is invoked during the Rite of Vanishing Flame,  
when the shrine is a precinct of half-truths and full shadows,  
when the sovereign is not seen,  
but believed,  
and when the greatest trick  
is not escape—  
but erasure.

Relic Embedded:  
A broken mug handle fused with a burnt matchstick,  
wrapped in a strip of Verbal’s interrogation transcript,  
etched with the phrase “The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn’t exist.”  
It pulses when truth becomes theater.

Echoed Protocol:  
“And like that… he’s gone.”—Verbal Kint, etched into the Codex of Vanished Flame",1,1767770327.0,GoldenInuTokens,1,1.0,False

My wife and I are planning a long-term move to Tirana from Pakistan. We’re both in the marketing and content field, working remotely with international clients, and we’re planning to apply for the ""Unique Permit"" (Residency) once we arrive.

Our ""big goal"" is to stay long enough to eventually apply for citizenship (I know it’s a 7-year road + Shqip language requirements). But we have a few specific questions for the locals and expats who have been there a while:

**Is it actually worth it?** We love what we see of the culture and nature, but is the path to citizenship realistic for foreigners, or is it a bureaucratic nightmare that leads nowhere?

**Expanding my Design Studio:** I currently run an established design studio in Pakistan. My plan is to expand it and open a branch in Tirana. I’ve checked LinkedIn and Reddit for creative talent (Graphic Designers, Content Strategists, UI/UX), but I’m not seeing a ""loud"" creative community online.

**Where is the talent hiding?** Are there specific local groups, Instagram communities, or physical hubs where the creatives hang out? Is it hard to find high-level English-speaking creative talent in Tirana?

**The ""Reality Check"":** As a Pakistani couple, what should we expect in terms of social integration? We are high-earning professionals and very social, but we want to know the ""real"" Tirana beyond the coffee shops in Blloku.

We’re really excited about the potential of Albania joining the EU in the future and want to be part of the growth there. Any advice, warnings, or ""I wish I knew this before moving"" tips would be greatly appreciated!

1q68ud4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CATiim/comments/1q68ud4/a_very_interesting_spjimr_interview_transcript/,A very interesting SPJIMR interview transcript.,"**Profile:** 9/7/8 GNEM Fresher

**CAT:** 96.53 %ile

**Specialization:** Marketing **Slot:** 9:45am, 5th Feb 2025

ID verified by 9:45

A case study at 10:10am was given the sheets for 20 minutes. The case study was about living with your parents as a mid-20s working individual, pros and cons.

G1 started at 11am

**Panel:** P1 (Older guy, extremely lovely) and P2 (Younger guy, had a strong presence)

Candidates: F (Marketing specialization, BCom graduate, family business)

M1 (me)

M2 (Finance + BM specialization, BCom graduate, 30m workex in insurance)

M3 (Finance specialization, BCom graduation, fresher)

The interview started with banter, the panelists asking us to be human and let go of tense behaviour indoctrinated by coaching institutes

Asked us what they should ask to put us at ease, F replied hobbies, and I agreed, while the rest didn't reply. P2 joked that only F and M1 had hobbies, and the other two didn't because they didn't say anything. So yeah, that paints the picture for the whole interview. Very chill and casual.

Another thing adding to the friendly banter is that, due to pure happenstance, M3 got rejected in G1 last year by the same panelist (P1), which he thought was his fault because he couldn't answer some finance question last time, and so the panelist joked that seeing him must've ruined M3's day (it probably did lmao)

**Actual questions:**

TMAY, but not in your form

F: Talked a bunch about things already in her form

M1: Talked about my passion for things and love of working with people

M2: Talked about things in this form

M3: Talked about his interests, but also things in his form

I think they should've taken the liberty to talk about things not in the form more.

Actual questions started with F, who was asked about how a company would go about measuring brand awareness.

She initially struggled to get to the point of the question, but the panelist helped her find her flow, and eventually she answered well.

Then P2 asked me about how biology would influence consumer behaviour (he initially assumed I had biology in undergrad, but I didn't, so he told me to answer what knowledge I had).

Initially, I answered with generic ideas, but he encouraged and guided me in the direction of talking specifics (particular brain parts, pathways, hormones), and I answered well.

M2 was asked about his job profile, what he does, the tools he uses, and some generic questions about implications of his insurance work, which I think he fumbled a little in answering

M3 was asked to give his views on the questions, and he didn't add that much new info, so the panelists were generally a little dissatisfied

M3 was asked some specific finance things that I have absolutely no idea about (pardon me for financial illiteracy).

Questions moved back to me, I was asked how a coping mechanism could be used in marketing, I gave some examples of guerrilla marketing and talked about creating association of peace and serenity through meditation booth in a showroom (not quite happy with it, and I think the P2 wasn't quite happy either).

F offered to add marketing tactics of Zomato, which notify you things like ""if you're lonely, why not have a sandwich?"" etc, which I think was a smart answer, and the panelists shared my feelings.

M2 was asked about his hobby of cricket, but he didn't quite answer very well (they were technical things).

F was asked about her hobbies, and P1 asked what dystopian books she read (she mentioned she was interested). She also mentioned Asura and how Ravan's perspective was presented.

The discussion grew to the whole panel with P1 talking about how anything contrary gains popularity with the new generation. We were asked to give our views on the matter. I said it was more of a matter of perceptions (how people perceive contrarian views as inherently informed, even if it isn't true), and others were asked if they agreed.

P1 remarked he would only be convinced with Asura if Ravan himself was there telling his story, to which M3 rebutted that Ram didn't write Ramayan either, which we all agreed with and laughed. I commend his wit on that one.

Then we were led to the waiting room with snacks and coffee. I'm writing this while waiting for the results.

G1 lasted for 50 mins give or take.

Verdict: The Entire group selected for G2 (After 50 mins of waiting)

It was more waiting for G2 to start, but the adcom member guiding us around was nice, and we talked for 15-20mins about the interviews, life at SPJIMR, and such, which was fun.

G2: New panel, P1 late 40s P2 mid 40s, both women, had a strong presence.

My group was F (Finance, Fresher), M1 (me), M2 (Marketing, work experience in Career Launcher)

First question: You're in an elevator with Bill Gates, you have 30 seconds to introduce yourself and tell him why you admire him

I fumbled a bit here and didn't introduce myself, mostly talked about what I like about him.

F took it in the direction of Mahakumbh (was Bill Gates in India for Mahakumbh? Idfk), so we discussed the stampede for a little bit.

M2 gave an example of a Coldplay concert, so the discussion went there. Asked about what the hot news is about Coldplay (Panelists were looking for something specific, none of us had any clue about it)

P1 asked me about my favourite new psychologist, and I didn't remember his name, but I talked about the guy behind social constructivism and the postmodernist movement. They wanted to know far more details about social constructivism, so I went on a monologue for like 5-6mins. Not sure what they thought of it.

Then we were asked our key takeaway from the case study and our stance. That's it.",1,1767770116.0,CATiim,0,1.0,False

1q68s68,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q68s68/dry_january_tips/,Dry January tips,"Well done all dry January folk! I’m just thinking the first weekend is coming up! For me the first two weekends were crucial for me to break my weekend ‘I deserve to go to the pub’ feeling. I used to go on a Thursday night and not a Friday ( because I had a morning fitness class on Saturday) but from about 3pm Saturday I could be found having beers and it wasn’t unusual to be until 2am, then hungover Sunday and takeaway. 

So I had to nail the weekends - here are my tips for some weekend stuff to keep you on the straight and narrow and I hope others can add- 

1. Booked a cinema ticket for 10:30 am viewing - got to cinema for 10 am, got a fancy coffee and enjoyed a quiet cinema - practically a private viewing ! 

2. Used my saved £££ from not drinking to go to my fave restaurant for lunch. Normally it would be evening with wine and cocktails instead of dessert. That lunch I had 3 courses and a coffee and had to trundle home for a nap!

3.Pick out an old classic movie or two and have a movie night 

4 . Find a morning fitness class. Mine is out door and it’s Saturday morning, it actually stopped my Friday drinking habit long before I stopped the rest of the drinking. You get to feel extra smug heading home at 9:30 am for coffee, knowing a lot of world is asleep and you have hit your exercise target. 

5. Boring sounding but you have saved time by not being hungover - pick a drawer that has been annoying you and sort it. Give yourself 20 mins. Boom! Done! Increased smugness ! 

6. Another old hobbies? Unplayed musical instruments? This is time to reconnect. I’ve knitted 4 gorgeous sweaters after decades of absence. 

7. If you are going to the pub, it’s allowed! Plan ahead what you will drink, I like a soda and blackcurrant, I’m also now partial to a Fanta. I’ve encountered a few mango shakes and iced drinks . If it’s an NA beer I love a Guinness zero, I love an erdinger wheat beer, the key is to remember you won’t drink like you used to, ie 6 in a row, pace yourself, I’ll have 2 erdinger then I do always leave earlier now than I used to, the great news is I’m still sober and so I can do anything from the list above when I get home!

I have a 4.0 GPA, am the VP of a campus club, as well as participant of many other clubs, a regular party goer, been told by both men and women friends that I’m conventionally attractive, well-dressed, plus I am vying to become a lawyer one day, I’m extroverted and social, I’m the guy girls seek out to walk them across campus, trauma-dump on, cry in front of, and consider a “safe, chill, confident” leader and friend.

On top of which, I am currently maxing out my likes on FOUR different dating apps every single day. I don’t just mindlessly swipe, I use the comment features, write thoughtful responses on the actual prompts, not just thirst trap pics, and put in genuine effort.

All of that has resulted in: Absolutely NOTHING. Not a single match that leads anywhere. Not a single date.

In person, most of time I wait to get comfortable with a girl (usually over several weeks) before asking her out because I value respect and intellectual connection. By the time I ask for a simple coffee date, I’ve already been slotted as the “Safe Brother” apparently, so I get rejected. But it’s not like I wait years or even months to drop some heavy love confession. Sure I take the time to get us both comfortable in each other’s presence, as personally I’d find it 1000x more icky to just ask out some random I’ve never met before.

I just find it so mind boggling I can’t even get a simple date, even a chance. I don’t feel like I’m asking for anything crazy, no commitment, no sex, nothing beyond going out one on one to some activity.  I’ve been rejected by every type of girl imaginable, from athletes to bookworms, from popular loud girls to the shy quiet ones, despite being told I’m a ""great catch"" by everyone around me.

So my question once again is, why am I invisible as a romantic partner? I’m doing everything the “handbook” says: I’m successful, I’m respectful, I have status, and I’m putting in massive volume on the apps. Why is a guy with “high-value” stats getting lower return than guys who put in zero effort?

Am I too “safe”? Is my “comfort first” approach actually a massive red flag? But even that doesn’t explain the HUNDREDS of girls I’ve liked on these apps that haven’t gone anywhere. How do I break this essentially 5 year long curse before I snap? Be as brutal as possible.",0,1767769508.0,dating_advice,3,0.5,False

The second account was labeled: “Real Home.” 

My blood ran cold. What the hell was a “real home” 

I dialed Steven Walsh’s number, keeping my voice steady. “Why do you have an electric bill for another property under your name?” 

I could hear keyboard clicking on his end, his tone casual and light. “Oh, that’s for my mom. The old 

lady doesn’t know how to use smartphones, so I linked her place to my account.’ 

I sweetly told him what a devoted son he was, then hung up and clicked on that account’s monthly usage details. 

That place was using more electricity than our house, and the peak usage always coincided with weekends when we slept in separate rooms. 

I memorized the address and started my car. 

The GPS led me to the city’s most prestigious upscale neighborhood – Skyline Towers. Property 

values here were double what we paid for our current place. 

I parked on the street, staring up at the brightly lit high-rise. 

Security stopped me at the entrance. I gave them Steven’s name and recited that account number perfectly. The guard saluted and waved me through 

The elevator stopped at the 26th floor. 

I stood before that heavy security door, took a deep breath, and pressed the doorbell. 

I heard light footsteps approaching from inside, accompanied by a young woman’s voice. 

“Honey, didn’t you say you were just getting soy sauce? Why are you ringing the bell?” 

The door opened to reveal a woman in a silk slip nightgown, holding a half-eaten apple. 

She froze when she saw me. 

I froze too. 

I knew that face all too well. 



One exposed truth three wasted chances and shes ready to leave forever 

This was Sophie Warner, the struggling college student I’d been sponsoring for six years. 

The nightgown she wore – I’d bought it just last month. It had disappeared before I could even remove the tags. 

Steven had said the housekeeper probably lost it while doing laundry. 

Turns out it was on her body all along. 

The apple tumbled from Sophie’s hand, rolling to my feet. “Claire… Claire?” 

I stared at her expressionlessly and pushed past her into the apartment. 

Two pairs of slippers sat by the entrance – pink bunny ones and gray linen ones. I’d crocheted those gray ones for Steven myself. 

The living room was spacious, with thick wool carpeting spread before floor-to-ceiling windows. LEGO blocks were scattered across it. 

A massive wedding photo hung on the entertainment center wall. 

Steven had his arm around Sophie’s waist, their radiant smiles cutting through me like knives. 

“Who is it? Why isn’t anyone answering?” 

The sound of a toilet flushing came from the bathroom, then the door opened. 

Steven appeared in just a towel, drying his hair-his hand stopped mid-motion when our eyes met. 

The atmosphere became suffocating. 

I walked to the coffee table and picked up an unfinished LEGO castle. 

“So this is the house where you pay Mom’s electric bill?” 

I opened my hand. 

The LEGO castle crashed onto the marble floor, shaftering into pieces. 

Steven finally snapped back to reality. He rushed over, positioning himself in front of Sophie. 

“How did you get here? Are you stalking me?” 

I looked at his bare chest, fresh scratch marks visible across it. “Sleeping in separate rooms on weekends – was that so you could come here to ‘work overtime’?” ",1,1767769246.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

 Hope I don't get flamed too hard for budget and coffee lol. 

So we have drank foldgers classic for years until it went from $12 to $20 for 43 oz of grounds at Costco. Used reg coffee pot.

Then switched to original  donut shop coffee when it went on sale for 96 k cups for $37 as I thought it was a great sale. Seems staples runs it frequently though. Waiting for coffee in the am sucks and if the misses or I decide to drink 2 cups vs 1 it's just not worth the k cup life it seems.

I read great value donut shop k cups are better than the great value grounds, anyone have experience with their ground coffee? Any other medium roasts or how is mcdonalds McCafe grounds vs say folgers classic?


 We also have a WinCo and trader joes close as well. Just looking for some recommendations as we are almost out of the 96 k cups and thank you!

Under her, the ocean went on forever, a dark mouth that did not blink.","# [https://librettists.nomijobs.com/future-begins-this-moment-adam-johnson-1/](https://librettists.nomijobs.com/future-begins-this-moment-adam-johnson-1/)  Chapter 1 Raft Survival: Global Edition

The sky above Gwen Swann was a clean, endless blue. No clouds. No contrails. Under her, the ocean went on forever, a dark mouth that did not blink.

She sat on a raft barely 43 square feet in area. No land. No boats. No gulls. Just water and the slap of waves. The spray soaked her jeans and the fabric stuck cold to her legs, like the sea was claiming her piece by piece.

Gwen stared ahead, her mind completely blank. She was pretty sure that five minutes ago, she’d been at the office, half-dead from overtime, staring at a spreadsheet and wondering if coffee counted as dinner.

Gwen thought, ‘Kidnapped? By who, exactly.

‘I am a soft target with nothing to my name. What, someone hauled me out here to inherit my student loans and maxed-out Visa?’

A translucent screen flickered into view at the corner of her vision, like a heads-up display from a game. Lines of text scrolled by.

\[Global Chat\]:

\[Okay, no joke, where the hell are we?\]

\[I was literally about to clutch a pentakill and now I’m in the ocean. This has to be a prank.\]

\[Someone tell me I’m dreaming. Or knock me out. Either works.\]

\[Is anyone else here actually real? I don’t see a single person.\]

\[I’m gonna throw up. I get seasick on this boat. This is not funny.\]

\[Bro, calling this thing a boat is generous. My dog’s crate is bigger.\]

\[Seasick? Try having deep-sea phobia. I swear something huge just swam under my raft.\]

\[Nana, if you’re watching from heaven, please don’t let me die like this!\]

Gwen exhaled quietly. ‘Good. I am not alone. At least this nightmare has company.’

The chat continued to dissolve into chaos, but before she could read more, another voice cut through everything. Cold. Flat. Inhuman. It didn’t come from the screen. It came from inside her head.

\[Congratulations. You have entered the Ocean Survival Game. Player ID: 29,786,510.

\[All five billion players have successfully entered the game. The Grand Sea Route is now officially open. Please remember the following navigation rules.

\[From this point forward, your life will take place at sea. You may collect resources by salvaging floating debris, fishing, and exploring islands in order to upgrade your vessel and survive.

\[During the New Player Protection Period, players are prohibited from attacking one another. Violations will result in system penalties.

\[The New Player Protection Period lasts three days. During this time, overall difficulty is significantly reduced. Use this window wisely and gather supplies as quickly as possible.

\[You have one life. Please do not waste it.

\[After the protection period ends, the global event “Ocean Storm” will begin.

\[Warning: the storm will destroy all vessels with a Sturdiness Value below five. Upgrade your ship to ensure survival.

\[A Beginner Blind Box has been delivered to your vessel. Happy sailing.\]

Right on cue, something dropped from above. A small wooden box hit the raft with a dull thump and slid to a stop near Gwen’s feet.

A large question mark was painted on the lid. So this was the so-called Beginner Blind Box.

Only then did she notice the rest of her starting equipment. A fishing rod lay near the edge of the raft, old enough to look like it had lived several past lives.

Next to it sat an iron grappling hook, spotted with rust and tied to a fraying rope.

The moment she focused on them, translucent stat panels popped up in front of her eyes.

\[Worn Fishing Rod\]

\[Quality: Poor\]

\[Description: Standard beginner item. Everyone gets one. Can be used for fishing.\]

\[Worn Throwing Hook\]

\[Quality: Poor\]

\[Everyone gets one of these starter tools. Use it to snag whatever junk’s floating by on the waves.\]

\[Dilapidated Wooden Raft\]

\[Sturdiness: 1 (May fall apart at any time.)\]

\[Speed: 0 (It’s a busted raft. Manage your expectations.)\]

\[Storage Capacity: 0/10 slots\]

\[Durability: 100/100\]

\[Upgrade requirements: 20 Wood, 10 Cloth, 10 Seaweeds, 1 Iron Ore, 1 Dull Pearl.\]

\[(Upgrade unavailable. Insufficient materials.)\]

After reading through the raft’s stats, Gwen finally understood just how bad things were.

Five billion people around the world had been dumped into this so-called survival game. Everyone started the same way. One useless raft. No food. No fresh water. And a three-day countdown.

Technically, a person could survive about a week without food if they were careful. But the ocean storm coming in three days would wipe out this raft without even trying. A structural rating of one might as well be a death sentence.

If she wanted to live, upgrading this floating pile of wood wasn’t optional. It was everything.

Gwen had never been the kind of person who wasted energy complaining about fate. When she realized something couldn’t be changed, she made the only sensible choice. She adapted, and she did it fast.

That was how the world worked. Survival of the fittest. The strong stayed standing, and everyone else got swept aside.

She understood that rule instinctively. So while the global chat was still packed with people shouting, whining, and melting down in real time, Gwen was already moving, quietly collecting whatever she could get her hands on.

She wrapped the rope of the throwing hook securely around her wrist and locked onto a wooden plank drifting about fifteen feet straight ahead.

The metal hook sliced through the air with a sharp whistle. It grazed the edge of the plank and missed.

The hook splashed into the water and vanished beneath the surface, swallowed whole by the sea.

Gwen pulled the rope, reeling the hook back in.

She had underestimated how fast the hook traveled, and she hadn’t accounted for the way the current nudged floating debris forward. Lesson learned. On the second throw, she adjusted her timing and released.

The hook landed squarely in the middle of the plank.

Nailed it.

She hauled it in and noticed a strip of bright green seaweed tangled around the bottom.

\[Item acquired: 1 Wood, 1 Seaweed\]

A buy-one-get-one deal. She wasn’t complaining.

Everything she collected was automatically transferred into the raft’s storage. A notification popped up as the capacity updated to 2 out of 500.

No breaks. Gwen’s eyes were already on the next piece of debris.

\[Wood+1\]

\[Cloth +1\]

\[Seaweed +1\]

\*\*\*\*\*

Three hours later, Gwen barely had to think about it anymore. Her wrist felt sore, sure, but her accuracy was ridiculous. Anything she aimed at might as well have been glued to the hook. Misses were rare.

She checked her inventory. Twenty three pieces of wood. Eleven cloth. Ten seaweed.

That was enough to upgrade the raft. What she still needed was iron ore and that dull-looking pearl. And she had no clue where either of those came from.

Out of curiosity, she glanced back at the global chat. The conversation had moved on. Everyone was now arguing about the newbie loot boxes.

\[Are you kidding me? Five pieces of wood. That’s it?\]

\[I got two bottles of water. Best day of my life. I was about to pass out.\]

\[Five wood gang here.\]

\[Same. Five wood.\]

\[Same here.\]

\[So the devs really went full gacha scam on us, huh?\]

\[This is supposed to be a starter reward, not a slap in the face.\]

\[Cry more. Check out what I pulled.\]

One message stood out immediately. Someone had posted a full item card.

\[Shark Tooth Dagger\]

\[Quality: Common\]

\[A dagger made from shark teeth. Sharp enough. Deals double damage to sharks.\]

‘Wait, weapons are in the loot boxes too?’ Gwen thought, surprised.

Gwen scrolled. Weapon pulls were rare. Most people got basic materials. Some luckier players scored food, fresh water, binoculars, or flint.

One insanely lucky player claimed they had pulled one hundred dull pearls.

Gwen’s eyes narrowed. The raft upgrade required one pearl. She still had no idea how to get one, and it was obvious these were way more valuable than wood or cloth.

The pearl guy wasted no time. \[Selling extra pearls. One pearl for 200 wood, cloth, or seaweed.\]

\[Two hundred wood for one pearl? Just mug us next time.\]

\[I fished up a giant oyster with the starter rod. Cracked it open, pearl inside. If you want pearls, go fishing.\]

\[Fishing my ass. I’ve been sitting here for an hour and nothing’s biting.\]

\[Same. Didn’t catch a thing and almost fell in.\]

\[Basic fishing tip. You need bait. I tore off a piece of bread from a loot box, tied it to the hook, instant fish.\]

\[So what you’re saying is I need food to get food?\]

\[No bait means no fish. No fish means no food. This game is evil.\]

\[Selling one piece of wheat bread, 150 grams, for 200 wood. First come, first served.\]

\[Dude, that’s even worse than the pearl guy.\]

\[I would rather starve than trade my pride for bread.\]

\[Trading newbie blind box for five pieces of wheat bread.\]

\[People are selling blind boxes already?\]

\[My luck sucks anyway. Five wood isn’t doing me any favors.\]

Everyone was brand new, all stuck with the same problems. No food. No water. The moment someone had extras, prices went through the roof.

Gwen felt the faint tug of hunger in her stomach after hours of work, but it was manageable. She wasn’t desperate yet. Trading valuable resources for food now would just mean grinding for someone else’s benefit.

She picked up the blind box resting on the raft. Trading it for bread was probably the smart move. Still, Gwen hesitated. Compared to five pieces of wood, taking a shot at luck didn’t seem like the worst idea in the world.

Usually, this culninates in some form of romantic attraction. At one point, my current partner was my favorite person. I was in highschool and did not know what I was experiencing or why, I didn't even see the pattern of behavior until I watched Crazy Ex Girlfriend (funnily enough) and everything sort of clicked for me. I love my boyfriend more than anything, however, I have been having very all consuming thoughts of others that are innapropriate and I fear will lead to damage of my relationship. The first person post-boyfriending was a man who worked in a coffee shop close to where I worked at the time. I saw him every day, was attracted to him, and eventually itched to see him daily until he got a traffic violation and dissapeared within the next month or so. The next was a man I met working at a summer camp. He is very taken but I think the reclusivness of being alone together drew me twoards him emotionally because he is quite possibly the funniest and most charming dude ive ever met and his laugh is insane. (Im saying this objectively.) Currently, after coming home, I have gained a (strangely mostly non romantic) obsession with a coworker. Its very confusing as it is not romantic nor is it parental. Its vaguely flirty if you were to squint ultra hard with 20/20 vision but it mostly consists of us playing videogames and complaining. He is not someone I would usually ever be attracted to in one million years for many reasons but I cannot stop thinking about him & getting excited to see him and getting him treats ect ect. I just want to draw him and learn everything about him SO BAD. This pattern of behavior from me will, long term, be a threat to my current (and, god forbid, any other) relationship with my partner. I have never lied to my partner nor have I ever EVER taken steps to cheat (actually a giant fear of mine.) But the obsession seems nearly uncontrollable. It feels like cutting myself off from these people is the only way but I gain a new FP everywhere I go. Heeeeeeeelp mmmmmee. 

TLDR: My BF is no longer my favorite person (medically speaking.) (He is my favorite person logically) and I am having a hard time with my obsessions outside of our relationship, especially with my new FP being daily close proximity.

Ok this went awesome, which is great. Looking for input on two things in particular now.

Where should the CFC digitally live? Consider - we need to be able to communicate about upcoming things, and have something sharable for new folks.

1. Reddit (we're already here! but hard to have a kind of permanent thing to share with new folks, etc - for example, this post is already kinda clunky.)
2. Discord (perfect for those who get it, an unpenetrable minotaur maze for those who don't.)
3. Website and email

(It's not going to be a group chat or FB group.) I'm kinda inclined to 1 and 3 myself.

Next, it's January in the lower mainland, so outdoors isn't predictably great but here's a grab bag assortment of events we could try. Assume we're doing two in January. Which are interesting enough you would show up for?

1. find the next abby film society screening and go for coffee before hand and then show all go to the screening together.
2. do a book exchange. all meet in a place, bring books you read and trade with other people.
3. play poker (has some complexity in organizing let's write dunk and edit sober.)
4. do a painting lesson together.
5. play nine holes of disc golf, we aint scared of the cold.
6. go to a lan party at the gaming cafe on the edge of old abby
7. go to some kind of semi orgnanized beer tasing at one of the local breweries.
8. attend a talk on the history of abbotsford.
9. do improv
10. have regular once a week morning walking group that we kick off
11. pinball tournament at wonderland (yeah i said it. iykyk)
12. play out-of-shape basketball at the drop in basketball at ARC
13. do one of those engineering challenge where you use crafts to build a case for dropping an egg from progressive heights.

can think of lots more after we do some practice runs. thoughts? what lands with you?

1q686ev,https://i.redd.it/7cu2aic4hvbg1.png,The Billionaire Jock's Game of Love,"My boyfriend is kissing another woman on the massive Kiss Cam screen – in front of an entire stadium packed with thousands of strangers.

They are in the VIP section. If the Kiss Cam hadn’t caught them, I would never have seen them from where I’m sitting — the farthest, cheapest seats in the arena.

The woman he is kissing looks rich, with that perfect old money blonde hair, paired with a designer outfit to match.

If I didn't see it with my own eyes, I wouldn't believe that Dylan, my Dylan, would ever do something like this to me.

My fingers tighten around the cardboard banner in my lap—Cheers for Dylan.

Dylan is one of the football players tonight, and it is his debut game as a professional football player.

As his girlfriend, I'm here to cheer for him.

Now during the halftime break, Dylan should be in his locker room resting for the second half of the game, not cozying up to some rich woman who looks like a model from a magazine

""Taylor…What the..,"" My best friend, Kiera, gradually snaps out of her stunned state next to me. ""Are you kidding me? How could he do that to you?""

Kiera faces me with intense anger in her eyes. ""You've been his biggest supporter since day one. And this is how he repays you?""

My chest twists tighter.

I remember the first time I met Dylan back in the training room. I worked as a Physical Therapy student by cleaning his teammates' sweat and monitoring their injuries.

Dylan had a smile which had a mix of playful mischief and charm that made me believe everything he said without question.

I had fallen deep for him. We were both poor students when we started dating, and he needed to spend more time on training whenever he could, so I worked multiple part-times to support his dream and our life together.

And now?

Now, I bought my own ticket, the most affordable one but still a large purchase for me, and spent hours cheering for him, all for this moment when I'm supposed to be proud and happy.

And instead…

It takes a moment for Dylan and the woman to notice the camera or the cheers.

A beat of nervousness washes over Dylan's face before he regains some sort of resolve.

The woman shoves Dylan away while raising her hand to hide her face.

Gasps ripple through the stands around me.

""Are they really that shy—or is this an affair?"" a woman behind me said with a laugh.

""That's Dylan, right? The guy who scored today? That woman he kissed. I swear I've seen her somewhere before, but where?""

The crowd around us erupts in laughter, some were already digging to find out who this mystery woman is supposed to be.

""Honestly, I warned you about him."" Kiera glares again at the screen with anger. ""You deserve someone way better than Dylan. You should break up with that loser, now.""

Her anger pulls me halfway back to myself, grounding me in a way my trembling hands can't.

My fingers shake as I text:

Me: What's going on?

The reply comes faster than I expect, slicing me open.

Dylan: You saw it. Let's break up. I didn't know how to tell you.

Just like that.

On the big screen, Dylan quickly slides his phone into his pocket and reaches for the woman's hand. He then brings her out of the camera’s frame, probably towards the backstage, the same way he used to do with me when he played on his college team.

""What did he say?"" Kiera asks while leaning a bit to look at my screen.

""How dare him…"" Her voice shakes with fury. She shoots to her feet, thrusting both middle fingers toward the field, even though we cannot locate where they are exactly from where we are seated. ""Hey, Dylan! You're an absolute loser!""

The people around us don't know what's going on but start laughing anyway.

Suddenly, all the noise around me swells and presses in, suffocating me.

Before I collapse, a firm arm wraps around my waist, steadying me. His touch is solid, grounding, with heat radiating through the fabric of his jacket.

I look up, startled, and meet the jawline of a man who is impossibly handsome. Even with the hat shadowing part of his face, there's a spark in his dark eyes as our hands touch when he steadies me. It hits me then—he's the same guy who'd been sitting quietly beside me earlier.

I noticed him immediately while he was walking towards his seat next to me. Athletic build, steady presence. The baseball cap on his head shaded the rest of his face, obscuring the details, but even without them, I knew he was handsome enough to spell trouble.

The audience around us created a deafening noise, but he stayed completely serene while appearing to exist in a different world beyond the arena's wild environment.

He only tensed up a bit when the kiss cam screen was showing Dylan and the woman kissing.

However, I was too shocked to care more about his reactions after that.

""You okay?"" His voice remains steady and controlled as he speaks with a calm tone that does not need loudness to gain attention from others.

I swallow hard while my heart races before I force out a weak ""Y-yeah… thanks.""

He studies the banner while his face becomes more and more stern. ""Dylan? You support him?""

""N-no I'm-"" But before I could explain anything, there was a minor pick up of the crowd.

All eyes on us as the massive kiss cam screen locks in on the handsome stranger holding me, as if we're some lovers caught in the moment.

The man next to me stiffens while he moves away from me, and his lips form a shape that suggests he wants to deny the situation by giving an explanation about our relationship status.

But something reckless surges through me.

The image of Dylan kissing that woman blazes behind my eyes.

And then it clicks—he's probably seeing this at the backstage, right now.

Before the stranger can speak, a sudden wild impulse takes over my body.

I reach up, cup his face, and lean in.

My lips find his, silencing whatever words he might have said.

Chapter 2: Her Husband

Taylor POV

The taste of his lips still lingers when I pull back. My heart beats rapidly in my ears.

The intense noise of the crowd fades into the background as I remain fixated on him, the stranger whose steady hands kept me from collapsing just moments ago.

Except… his expression isn't good.

His jaw tightens, a muscle ticking in his cheek as if I've crossed a line. His eyes—gray, stormy, search mine, not with passion but with something else entirely.

Shock. Discomfort. Maybe even anger.

What have I done?

The audience moved their attention to different laughing couples after the Kiss Cam broadcast ended as well, and their roar moved away from us like an ocean wave that pulled back into the distance.

Out of the corner of my eye, Keira's jaw practically drops. She stares in stunned silence, her eyes blown wide and her mouth parted just enough to betray her shock.

Kiera glances between me and him, disbelief etched across her features, as though she can't decide if she just witnessed it happen.

I feel the heat of shame pressing into my skin as if the stadium lights are creating an intense glare that is slowly setting my body a blaze.

""I'm sorry,"" I blurt, words tumbling out. ""I shouldn't have—""

He doesn't speak. His lips part, then press together again, and his gaze slides toward the court as if he's willing this whole thing to vanish.

I can't stand it. The combination of Dylan's betrayal and my public kiss with a stranger and his unspoken criticism has become unbearable for me.

My chest tightens as I glance at Keira. Her wide-eyed disbelief hasn't faded, but when I reach for her hand, she doesn't pull away. ""Let's go,"" I whisper.

She gives the tiniest nod, still stunned, but she doesn't argue.

We navigate through the crowd while fans in the background discuss the game and then a person points at me saying ""That's her!""

By the time we stumble out onto the cool night streets, I'm shaking.

My banner is still crumpled in my hand, a sad reminder of the night I thought would celebrate Dylan.

Kiera loops her arm through mine. ""Taylor, screw him. Screw all of it. You're better than this.""

""I don't feel better,"" I mutter. ""I feel stupid.”

""Honestly, forget Dylan, you two looked smoking out there. That kiss? Fireworks, girl.” She bumps my shoulder lightly, eyes sparkling. “Maybe you should've asked for that stranger's number before you ran.”

""Come on, Keira, stop joking around—"" I start, cheeks burning, but before I can finish my sentence, my phone buzzes sharply, the notification tone slicing through my misery. I almost ignore it, but the screen lights up with a charge notification.

It is my monthly credit card bill. I usually know what I spent on so it shouldn't be a problem.

But my stomach drops this time when I see the extra $20,000.

It must be Dylan.

I didn’t mind using my money to support his dream and our life together.

But now he cheated on me while spending an extra $20,000?

How dare he?

""Dylan squandered my money this month,"" I mumbled to Kiera, my voice shaking. ""He probably had planned to break up with me after I found out.""

""What-"" Kiera's face darkens. "" He didn't.""

""Oh, he did."" My fingers tremble as I dial his number

One ring. Two. Four. Straight to voicemail. I try again.

And again. On the sixth attempt, he finally answers. His voice oozes irritation.

""Taylor. Now's not a good time. I'm about to go back to the field.""

""Not a good time?"" My chest aches with fury. ""You used up all my savings. What did you even buy this time?""

Then Dylan sighs like I'm the problem. ""It's an investment.""

""An investment? With my money?"" My voice cracks. ""In what, Dylan?""

""Don't be dramatic."" His tone shifts, almost smug. ""It's Ella, the woman I kissed earlier. You saw her.""

""Ella?"" The name punches the air from my lungs.

""She's wealthy, Taylor. I need to bring her on dates that are up to her standards. Once I win her over, everything will change. I'll pay you back—every penny. You just need to be patient.""

The world tilts beneath me. ""So you're using me—my money—to impress another woman?""

He exhales, annoyed. ""It's called strategy. I saw you kissing another man too, by the way. Why don't we just both move on? ""

Memories of kissing that stranger in front of everyone floods back. I can feel my cheeks heat up.

I don't have time to think about a stranger right now.

I have to get my money back.

""You cheated first, Dylan."" My voice steadies, icy now. ""If you don't pay me back immediately, I'll go to her. I'll tell Ella exactly what you've been doing.""

That gets him. His voice sharpens, ugly. ""You wouldn't dare.""

""Try me.""

""Careful, Taylor."" He now speaks with such venom. I have never heard him talk to me like that before.

""You don't know who-."" The line goes dead. ""Oh no, he didn't just hang up on me.""

I try calling back but met with the robotic voice of an automated system: ""The number you are dialing has blocked you.""

""You're seriously not letting him get away with this, right?"" Kiera grabs me, her words igniting the flame inside me.

He's not just going to walk away from this.

Not with my money, and certainly not with my dignity.

“I'm going backstage to find Ella.” I whisper. ""She deserves to know what a Prick he really is.""

Although the sports venue is quieter now since the second half of the game is about to start, the security personnel maintain their position with operational radios crackling in the shadows.

Kiera hisses beside me as we sneak toward the side entrance. ""Taylor, you're insane. But if you're doing this, I'm with you.""

I squeeze her hand. ""Thank you.""

The backstage area hums with the noise of distant voices, while the air carries the scent of sweat and disinfectant. The walls display shiny posters showing athletes with glossy smiles.

Then I see him. Dylan. His eyes land on me, and something hard flickers there.

To my surprise, Ella is not there with him.

""Get her out of here,"" Dylan says flatly, dismissing me like I'm some crazed fan. ""She doesn't belong.""

""What?"" My voice rises, sharp and trembling. ""You can't just—""

Two guards advance, broad shoulders blotting out the hallway lights.

Kiera squeezes my hand hard. ""Go find Ella. I'll distract them.""

""What? No—""

""Taylor, go!"" she hisses, then spins toward the guards with the kind of wild, dramatic energy only she can pull off. ""You want trouble? Here it is!""

She kicks over a trash bin which produces a loud metallic sound before she throws her arms into the air as if she wants to start a protest. The guards immediately turn their attention to her, shouting commands as she shrieks in exaggerated outrage.

""Don't touch me! I know my rights!"" she yells, drawing every eye in the hallway.

My heart twists with gratitude.

""I owe you one"" I whisper even though I know she can't hear me because her loud performance drowns out my voice.

With their focus on Kiera, I ran down the hallways as my heart races with increasing speed.

I expect to find Ella somewhere nearby, maybe tucked into a private lounge or corner of the backstage area. But when I finally turn a corner, I freeze at the sight before me.

Ella is there, yes—draped in elegance. But she's not with Dylan.

She's speaking to HIM.

The stranger. The man from the stands. The one I kissed.

He stands a few feet from Ella, his shoulders squared, posture rigid as though every muscle in his body is strung tight. His fists flex at his sides, slowly opening and closing, like he's fighting to stay calm.

""Unbelievable,"" he mutters. ""We're still in the middle of a divorce process, and you're already parading around with a new boyfriend?""

""Oh, calm down, Aiden."" Ella doesn't flinch. She crosses her arms over her chest, chin tilted high, her perfume drifting sharp and floral even from where I'm hiding.

Oh God.

The stranger—the man whose lips I stole in a moment of reckless desperation—is Ella’s husband.

Her divorcing but still married husband.

Chapter 3: The Eavesdropper

Aiden POV

Twenty Minutes Ago

I'm a billionaire, a quarterback for one of the biggest American football teams, and one of the main investors in Pacific Wave FC.

Nick, the club manager, sits beside me. We came here to scout—check out Dylan's debut, see if the kid's worth signing for next season, maybe spot a few other recruits. That's why we slipped into these cheap seats instead of the VIP box. The plan was to stay unnoticed, avoid the players' eyes, and keep a low profile.

But now my mind keeps replaying the moment I saw Ella kissing him while her hand kept rubbing his arm as if it belongs there.

My chest tightens at the thought.

After all, she is still my wife. Even though we’ve been living apart for quite some time.

As if that weren't enough, some girl—barely more than a stranger—yanked me into a kiss, and of course the Kiss Cam caught it.

Now I'm supposed to be paying attention to the match, blending in with the crowd, but how can I?

The guy two rows down keeps sneaking glances, like he half-recognizes me from a sports headline or a highlight reel.

I sink lower in my seat, wishing to look normal.

""That girl could work in our favor,"" Nick says carefully, flipping through his clipboard. ""If you're seen dating and kissing her, it might clean up your public image. People think you only go for blondes with trust funds. And that you don't respect poor people.""

The girl’s face cuts through the noise in my head—dark hair tumbling in loose waves, skin with a sun kissed warmth that doesn't fade under stadium lights, eyes the color of strong coffee watching me like she already knew my secrets.

Even her mouth, the one I can still feel pressed to mine, held something defiant in it.

She looked nothing like the polished blondes I’ve been photographed beside. She looked real.

I glare at him. ""I'm not even divorced yet. There's nothing to discuss.""

""Deadline to sign the papers is this week. Ella's already moved on, Aiden.” He sighs, leaning back into his chair. ""What's really stopping you?""

""What's stopping me?"" I can't help but frown at the question. ""I just don't want this.""

Divorce feels like failure. Every woman I've ever dated was dazzling, the type who lit up magazine covers.

And yet, they all said the same thing to me when we broke up — that I couldn’t give them what they really wanted.

Love.

I need to talk to Ella. Now.

My phone feels heavy in my hand as I type out the word: We need to talk. I saw the kiss cam.

Then I hit send before I can even stop myself.

Taylor POV

""You never loved me! The only thing you ever loved was football!""

Ella's voice rips through the hallway loud and raw, shattering the quiet like glass underfoot.

Her voice trembles with fury and something sharper. It contains pain– hurt so deep it almost burns the air around it.

Pressing flat against the cold wall, my spine aching from the sudden tension.

My heart begins to hammer so violently. I could hardly hear the voices coming from further down the hall. I clutch my jacket so tight that my knuckles begin to turn white.

I should not be here. I should not be eavesdropping.

My mind is telling me to run away, but my feet won't listen while my eyes stay locked on them.

""That’s not true…"" Aiden tries to explain.

But Ella cuts him off sharp before he can finish his sentence, her voice trembling. ""You never loved me, Aiden. Not even when I was in the hospital… after the miscarriage.""

My stomach drop. A miscarriage.

I have never known anyone to go through something so devastating and so achingly personal.

Aiden's voice cuts through the silence, soft, almost desperate. ""Ella…I--I didn't get the message in time. I'm so sorry. I should have been there sooner I--""

""I waited,"" Ella whispers, voice cracking into a shuddering sob. ""Three days. Three days, Aiden. And you couldn't even come then. Couldn't even be there when I needed you most.""

Even though I saw her practically kissing off my boyfriend's face on the Kiss Cam, a stubborn part of me can't help but feel it for her.

And then there's him.

Aiden.

He should have been there for Ella, holding her hands and whispering to her that everything would be okay. But he didn't.

He is handsome, sure, jaw sharp enough to cut glass, voice smooth, words practiced, but beneath it all—he's a douchebag.

The kind of guy who makes it impossible not to notice him while simultaneously making you hate everything about him.

""I let you down in every way—"" His words break apart thick with regret, trembling around the edges like it might crack entirely. ""I would do anything to change that. Anything.""

""Let me down? You think that's the word for it?"" she spits, each syllable heavy with pain.

""You think an apology can undo the nights I spent crying alone? You think I can forget that you… you didn't care enough?"" Her voice breaks at the end, lacing with anger but also with a hint of something almost softer, almost like the tremor of heartbreak hiding beneath the anger.

Aiden's voice drops to a lower tone while he speaks with greater caution.

""Ella… please let's not go through with the divorce. Can we… just try again? I want us to work.""

The silence that follows is like ice. I can feel Ella's hesitation before I hear it.

""I… I have someone now,"" she says finally, steadier than I expected. ""Someone who actually cares. Someone who would not leave me waiting when I needed them most. Unlike… you.""

""The boy you kissed today? He is way too young to take any responsibility."" Aiden's words falter, a stutter of disbelief.

""I trust him,"" Ella exhales, the sound sharp, resolute. ""I will go public about my relationship with him after the divorce, his name is Dylan, he is not someone like you who hides, who avoids responsibility, who—""

I roll my eyes before she can finish.

Dylan? Please.

If she really believes that man will stand by her, she's in for a brutal wake-up call.

He only cares about her money.

I initially came here to warn her…but now I'm not sure about that.

Ella probably also saw the kiss between Dylan and me. I guess she won't trust what I'm going to tell her now.

Maybe another time. Another way.

I should have walk away the moment I heard the word “divorce”. Now I need to disappear before either of them becomes aware of my presence.

As I turn to leave, my foot nudges a metal trash can and a sharp clang rings out.

Where did that trash can come from?

I stumble back. My heart shoots up to my throat while my pulse creates a deafening sound in my ears.

""Oh shit,"" I whisper, my voice small, barely audible over the hammering of my own heart.

""Who's there?"" Aiden's voice slicing through the silence, sharp and laced with irritation.

Chapter 4: Team Up

Taylor POV

The silence of the hallway makes my shoe squeak like a loud scream revealing my presence.

After taking a deep breath to calm my nerves, I finally decide to step out, revealing myself.

My throat feels like fire as I try to speak, ""Hi…I'm Taylor.""

""Why are you here?"" Aiden stares at me intensely with eyes that seem to cut through all my defenses to reveal my deepest truth.

""I didn't mean to eavesdrop."" My voice keeps trembling even though I try to steady it. ""I was running away from the security. I somehow ended up here.""

""I don't care who you are or why you are here. Just leave,"" Ella says without even sparing me a look, clearly impatient about my sudden interruption of their very private conversation.

""Actually…"" My voice falters.

I wonder if I should just warn Ella about Dylan after I made the worst first impression.

""Actually, the real reason I'm here is because of you, Ella.” I decide to say it anyway. “I came to talk to you about Dylan.""

I push my legs to move forward.

""Dylan is my ex,"" The words taste bitter on my tongue. ""He used my credit card to bring you on dates. He thinks he can win you over with it, like he always does. And when I asked him to pay me back, he just—he refused. He laughed.""

I swallow hard, my words coming out faster now. Thank God I got them out before I lost the courage to say them.

I glance over at Ella, she finally raises her eyes to look at me, her face full of judgment.

""He's not a good person. You should be careful around him. What he has for you isn't about feelings—it's about what he can take. He's probably just after your money. He did this to me too,"" I continued.

I know I sound like a crazy ex-girlfriend, but I just have to tell her the truth.

Ella doesn't hesitate. She rolls her eyes at me, slow and deliberate, like she doesn't give a flying shit about what I have to say.

Whatever broken, sad look she was portraying earlier when speaking to Aiden is now gone, wiped clean as if it never existed.

In its place is only arrogance, her chin is held high, her smile cold, like she's determined to show me just how little I matter.

""Your name's Taylor?"" Her tone dripping with mockery.

I nod.

""Oh, so you're the ex-girlfriend Dylan mentioned— "" Her voice is sharp, teasing. ""He said he knew you'd come to accuse him. I won't fall for your tricks, though. I know you are just a gold digger trying to get more out of him after you guys broke up. He owes you NOTHING.""

""By the way, are you the girl on the kiss cam today?"" Ella smirks, tilting her head, as if she's studying a curious insect.

I blink, caught off guard.

""I didn't see your faces. But judging from your hair.... And the man seems to wear the same hat as you, Aiden."" Ella turns to Aiden with a sneer.

""She grabbed and kissed me,"" Aiden answered immediately, trying to distance himself from me. ""I just happen to sit next to her.""

""Looks like Taylor got her new target. Just be careful.""

Damn, Her words sting sharper than I expected.

Imagine I came here to warn her, to protect her from the same trap I fell into, and instead… she insults me.

Heat begins to rise in my chest. My jaw tightens. ""I'm not lying,"" I snap, letting the anger rise through my words, ""Dylan fooled me, and he'll fool you too.""

Ella produces a brief dismissive laugh before she shakes her head. ""Let's just stop it here. I don't want to continue our meaningless conversation anymore."" She then turns around, about to leave.

""But we-,"" Aiden stops her by grabbing her arms.

""Just leave me alone. I don't want to talk to you either."" Then Ella just walks away while her high heels produce a rhythmic sound on the wooden floor.

She doesn't believe me.

I look at Aiden, who remains completely silent after Ella left.

He doesn't even look angry—just… distant.

Maybe he's already made up his mind. Or maybe he's thinking about Ella. Does he actually not want to end their marriage?

Okay, Taylor, think. Maybe if I… butter him up a little. Make him think I'm on his side.

Make him feel like… maybe I can help.

""You seem… like a really nice guy,"" I say cautiously, forcing myself to smile.

""Maybe… we could team up? If you… if we could let Ella see the truth about Dylan, maybe she'd break up with him. And maybe you can take the change to win her back too,"" I rush out, the sentences awkward but desperate.

I know it's bold. I know it's asking a lot. But what choice do I have?

Aiden shifts his head to the side as his eyes grow darker. Then he shakes his head, and the coldness in his tone cuts like ice.

""I've seen women like you before,"" he says, his words deliberate, slow and sharp.

What does that even mean?

""Poor and greedy. When you realize you can no longer get more out of Dylan, you begin to trick me into your scheme. With the kiss and everything.""

My stomach drops. I feel like I just got a punch in the gut.

This is probably the worst day in my life...

First cheated by Dylan. Then lost all my savings. Now this?

The burning sensation of humiliation spreads from my chest all the way to my feet.

My hands curl into fists, nails digging into my palms.

""Now I understand why Ella is divorcing you."" The words come out sharp, unfiltered. I feel a tremor in my chest as I say them. ""You're not poor. But so what?""

Aiden narrows his eyes.

""Actually, I bet you don't have any real friend or family."" The words rip from my mouth before I can even stop them, sharp and venomous. ""Your self-centered, toxic bias will make you die alone.""

Chapter 5: Familiar Face

Taylor POV

Aiden's jaw tightens.

The corridor light reflects off his cheekbone to create a harsh expression, making his face appear unyielding and dark.

The heat inside me starts to fade after I finally lashed out.

I turn my back to him while my leather jacket swings behind me as I sprint down the corridor.

The night air outside slams against me, sharp and cool.

No security guards are searching for me anymore, but I still slip through the shadows carefully until the stadium noise fades behind me.

My lungs burn as I push into a run, sneakers slapping against the cracked pavement.

My legs are trembling, but I don't slow down—not until I spot a familiar figure standing by her car, her phone screencasting a blue light across her face.

First, I have to acknowledge that my commute is only 30-60 min (the bus I take is never on time, but I often take that time to read and catch up on texts, etc.), I don’t have children, and despite the stress of the hiring freeze, lack of opportunity for travel, conferences, and demonization of Feds, I am not in the crosshairs of immediate termination. 

All of that being said, as a young person early in his career, I find RTO to be fulfilling when it comes to making social connections and fostering relationships. Some of my best friends are my coworkers and that wouldn’t have happened without RTO. I really value them and others I work with in a way I didn’t before. I feel that I have joined a community. I love the impromptu conversations, camaraderie, and team environment. My fellow Feds are for the most part genuinely good and committed people who inspire me constantly. So many more people are out on the streets and I love being apart of a kind of collective ritual with my city taking transit in, grabbing a coffee/ lunch, generally just being in the city and away from my room at home. Again, I understand I’m in a relatively privileged position, but I also believe that the issue is the lack of flexibility this administration has and a broader system that doesn’t support working people. I also went through AmeriCorps for a year and have seen some serious struggle so may have a different perspective. 

The hybrid schedule felt socially isolating for a young person like me in a new city and new career. Even if I showed up to the office on my own accord, everyone else was gone… so of course I didn’t want to go into an empty office either. 

This is just one experience. I understand the need for more telework exceptions and I can’t stand this administration and their stupidity, but this is something I’ve (maybe selfishly) found to appreciate. Feel free to disagree.

I'm an introverted person most of the time, but I do like to spend time with chill ppl tho. I like movies, cats, tea, and coffee. hmu يا مرحبا",1,1767767356.0,language_exchange,0,1.0,False

1q67zwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1q67zwv/confused_is_this_normal/,Confused is this normal?,"So i been IF for maybe few months. I do not eat after 8 pm till 1 pm or 2pm some days. 
 I did 40 hrs fast maybe two weeks back. Just water. No tea no coffee. Felt sick at after 24 hrs or so but went to bed. Felt better morning. Then did another one 24 hrs next week and just had beans at 24 hr mark so maybe 300 calories.

What's confusing me is why the heck i dont get hungry? Something wrong or is my body used to now IF i been doing for past 4 months if not more?

Both 24 hr fasting days didn't feel hunger. I am doing i guess 16:8 daily IF.
I am doing for autophagy benefits and maybe fat loss if that happens. Am 185 lbs was way over 220 two years back. I also make sure i get 10k or more steps in daily.

Why do i not feel hungry? Before IF i would be hungry like all the time wanting to snack. But the 24 hr fasting sessions didn't feel nothing.. . maybe caffeine withdrawal but i drink small cup of tea only in a day and can usually skip it altogether without issues or headaches..",1,1767767216.0,intermittentfasting,1,1.0,False
