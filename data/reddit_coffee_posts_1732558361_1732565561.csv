I was like, what is going on my UIC fellows? Are you guys serious? I would suggest apology first! Then I realized that I was reading the comment section for the library crush post, not the advice post.

1gzs9ck,https://www.reddit.com/r/TimHortons/comments/1gzs9ck/officially_done_with_this_restaurant/,Officially done with this restaurant,"Just went to a Tim Hortons close by at the lunch hour today. I rarely attend that location, and when I do it's usually to just buy a coffee or a donut, and nothing more. But today I felt a little hungry and also under the weather, so I thought I'd eat in for once...

Problem #1, the line. You can tell they rely on a business model that relies hiring the fewest amount of people to create the longest lines that people will stand in. The line up winded and snaked its way around a corner and I was waiting a good 20 minutes before I even got up to the till to place my order. But then after I placed my order and thought ""That took longer than expected,"" at least I was relieved my food would soon be ready. It was only a simple chicken wrap after all...

Problem #2, the other line.
How very wrong I was. I saw at least 10-15 people standing off to the side waiting for their order, but before if I just ordered a donut or cookie, it was usually ready right away. I thought it might take 2-3 minutes but not much longer. Instead, I just stood, and waited, and waited, and waited. At one point, they'd handed me the coffee but the wrap wasn't ready so after 10 minutes I thought they'd forgotten my order. I asked the lady at the till if she remembered about my wrap. Her answer, ""Yes sir, you're just #7 in line right now,"" like it was the most normal thing in the world. After I had already been standing there for 10 minutes. 

**I wanted to explode with anger at that point, but realized that was pointless, because it was not her fault. They were simply overworked and understaffed. Everything this coffee chain does is based on a business model, stretched to its logical limit. They deliberately hire the amount of people that will create the longest line that people will be willing to stand in rather than leave, to maximize the profit margins for the franchise owners, all while underpaying the people who actually take your order, who have to work frantically just to keep up.**

**Moreover, they intentionally create two lines, and split the waiting time between ordering and receiving, to create the illusion of efficiency and trick you into staying. If they didn't, then nobody would stand in a 40 minute line, so they would have to hire more workers, which would mean less profit for those at the top. So, why not split the line in two, to make you think you'll be served in only half the time, and by the time you figure it out, you'll already have wasted a good amount of time waiting, not to mention paid for your order. Let that sink in for a second. They are deliberately manipulating you. Your time, your patience, mean nothing to them. They'll stretch it as far as it can go, to the point of indecency, simply for the sake of padding the bottom line. That's their business model in a nutshell.**

And finally, Problem #3, Everything else.
What I've written so far would already be plenty enough reason not to go there ever again, but just to rub salt in the wound, I waited 40 minutes paid around $11, for a wrap that I found to be very bland and of at best mediocre quality, when for just a couple of dollars more I could have gotten a tastier meal at McDonald's, without the waiting, and which wouldn't have really been any more unhealthy than the processed junk I ate at Tim's. There's been much talk about inflation, especially as it relates to food, but *even by 2024 fast food standards*, this was appalling, especially with all the waiting and the quality of the food.

Of course, Tim's has already been going downhill for a while, it's nowhere near the restaurant it was 10-20 years ago, and I had mostly stopped going, but just this one time I thought I'd give it a try, but never again. My money, my time, and my patience are worth more than the horrible experience they offer. I might occasionally go (though not to that location) during less busy times, to get coffee and a donut like before, or the occasional box of Timbits, but when it comes to eating an actual meal there, they can kiss my three letters as far as I care.

1gzs8gn,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyZapper/comments/1gzs8gn/a_keto_diet_grocery_list_for_beginners_31/,A Keto Diet Grocery List For Beginners - 31 Must-Have Items,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s5gkhpfofs061.jpg?width=2064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c175eb97f2ac90ce1058d2578c321ac507fab89f

Starting the keto diet can be a little overwhelming-the high-fat, low-carb diet, known for its dramatic weight loss results, requires an overhaul of most people's typical shopping lists. That means saying goodbye to some of the easy items you might keep on hand for lazy nights (we're talking to you, quick-cooking rice and frozen french fries), and hello to some slightly more perishable foods that are higher in fat and protein like meat and full-fat dairy. 

But before you go filling your grocery cart with bacon and cheese galore, know that you'll want to opt for good-for-you sources of unsaturated fat and protein-like fish and avocado, instead, says Lyssie Lakatos, RDN, of the Nutrition Twins. ""Since this diet is primarily coming from fat, choosing healthy sources of fat is important,"" she says. So, healthy fat = good; protein = good; but what about everything else? Don't freak-while, yes, tons of stuff is off-limits on the keto diet, there are plenty of yummy things you can eat. To help, a few dietitians weighed in on what they'd put on their keto diet grocery shopping list-so all you really have to do is save it and go to the store.  But first. . . some items to take off your list

There are a few aisles you can skip (the cookie aisle is probably one of them) if you're committing to keto. Here are the non-keto-friendly items you will no longer need to stock your fridge and pantry with. 

Pasta and other grains When you're cutting carbs on keto, pasta, rice, and noodles have to be the first to go (unfortunately). Your local grocery store might have a special health foods section where you can find low-carb or gluten-free pastas and noodles, though. 

Starchy veggiesPotatoes are off limits, and so are other starchy, high-carb vegetables like carrots, believe it or not. Colorful, leafy greens are going to be key staples to add to your basket or cart. 

High-sugar fruitsWhile fruit is something that is usually recommended for a healthy, balanced diet, the keto diet restricts some fruit, says Marisa Moore, MBA, RDN, LD.  Some fruits, like apples, bananas, and pears, are higher in carbs, which break down into sugars, so they're not typically part of a keto eating plan. 

LegumesIf you eat vegan or vegetarian, certain legumes, like beans, lentils, and chickpeas, might be a regular part of your diet for extra protein. On keto, though, they're too high in carbs and too low in fat to be compliant. 

Sugary foodsYou're going to want to bypass any aisle that includes candy, doughnuts, snack cakes, and cookies, as the sugars in any processed sweets should be avoided on the keto diet. Your keto-friendly grocery list

Ok, now that we've gotten the bad news out of the way, here are all the yummy items you can stock up on when you're following a keto diet. There's plenty to be excited about putting in your cart!

Low-carb veggies

Not all vegetables are created equal for keto followers. High-carb veggies are a no-go. Instead, opt for low-carb options like cauliflower, broccoli, spinach, bell pepper, celery, cucumber, eggplant, and asparagus, says Pegah Jalali, RD, a nutritionist with Middleberg Nutrition. 

Frozen veggies are cool, too. Sydney Greene, RD, also of Middleberg Nutrition, recommends frozen cauliflower in particular. ""It's very low carb yet high in fiber and vitamin C. Use cauliflower in place of bananas for a creamy smoothie without the extra carbohydrates,"" Greene says. 

Avocados

Tammy Lakatos Shames, RDN, of Nutrition Twins, describes avocados as one of the very best keto foods, jam-packed with both nutrients and healthy fats. ""I like to have them with some hemp or flax seeds sprinkled on top and some parmesan cheese,"" says Jalali.  

Berries 

Raspberries are a perfect sweet treat for people on the keto diet, since they're the fruit with the fewest carbs, says Jalali-though blueberries and blackberries are great, too. Blackberries and raspberries specifically are a solid option because they contain 8 grams of fiber per cup, too, Moore adds. Salad greens

Pre-washed greens, like spinach, kale and arugula, are a huge timesaver. ""Having greens on hand makes it super easy to throw together a quick salad or add some quick nutrients-folate, vitamin C, fiber, magnesium-to your proteins,"" says Greene. 

For a quick, keto-friendly breakfast, Greene suggests scrambling two whole eggs and a handful of spinach to get a good serving of healthy fat, protein, and fiber. 

Grass-fed beef and organic chicken

Keep grass-fed beef and lamb, along with organic chicken, on hand, recommends Jalali. ""Our clients particularly love Applegate's Great Organic Uncured Beef Hot Dog,"" says Shames-they're non-GMO and made with grass-fed beef, sans nitrates and preservatives. 

Bone broth

Another option? Sip your meat-based protein. Greene loves Bonafide Provisions Bone Broth, which uses bones from grass-fed cows. ""The amino acids found in the broth support a healthy gut,"" says Greene. Tuna, salmon, or sardines (fresh or canned)

If you opt for fresh fish, grill, bake, or pan-fry it in a healthy oil (olive or avocado) and serve with a low-carb veggie like broccoli or cauliflower rice. 

If you choose canned, mix it with mayo and serve over greens, suggests Jalali. For a simple keto lunch, Greene suggests combining a can of tuna with half an avocado in a collard green wrap. 

Cheese

Go for grass-fed, organic, and full-fat options in the dairy aisle, recommends Jalali. For cheese, one easy-to-find option-readily available at groceries and convenience stores alike-is Organic Valley's full fat cheese. ""It fits in the keto diet perfectly,"" says Lakatos. Always read the nutrition info before purchasing pre-shredded cheeses, cautions Jalali, who says they sometimes contain a stabilizer that adds carbs-so just make sure your shredded cheese has zero grams of carbs. 

Greek yogurt and sour cream

These can be used interchangeably on the keto diet, as they all have similar amounts of carbs-Greek yogurt has five grams per serving and sour cream has seven. Just make sure they're plain options-added flavors also add carbs. 

Quark

Quark is a German food that's somewhere in between yogurt and cheese in flavor and consistency-you can add it to smoothies, or use it as a spread or topping. ""It's rich, creamy, and a favorite among our clients who are keto followers,"" says Lakatos. 

Eggs

If you're on a keto diet, opt for Eggland's Best Eggs, says Lakatos. ""They have double the omega-3s and six times the vitamin D of other eggs, thanks to their all-vegetarian hen feed which provides high-quality, keto-friendly nutrients. ""

Moore suggests meal prepping hard boiled eggs and keeping them in the fridge throughout the week for easy on-the-go breakfasts. If properly refrigerated and not cracked, they'll last for 7 days in the fridge. 

Nut milks

Milk can actually have a good amount of carbs, so nut milk is a good alternative on the keto diet, says Lakatos. Unsweetened coconut, hemp, and almond milks in particular are good options, as they contain no carbs and more than four grams of fat-a perfect combo for keto dieters. Almond milk specifically is versatile for a variety of recipes, like a chia seed pudding or a breakfast smoothie, says Moore. ""Simply blend frozen berries with leafy greens and plenty of almond milk for a frosty drink in less than five minutes,"" Moore suggests. 

Avocado, olive, hazelnut, and coconut oil

The keto diet is all about fat, so clearly all healthy oils are welcome on this keto grocery list. Cooking food in the oils is one thing-but you can also amp up your fat intake by drizzling some oil on your cooked meal, as well. 

Grass-fed ghee

Ghee, like the oils above, is a pure fat, which means its free from carbs or protein, says Jalali. ""Ketogenic diets are more than 60 percent fat so having pure fats for all meals helps keep you on track,"" she says. If you can't find ghee, you can also use butter. 

Seaweed

This low-carb snack has just one gram of carbs, and is full of iodine, which supports a healthy thyroid, says Greene. Some even come in individual grab-and-go packets so you can store them in your desk at work or in your purse. 

Olives

You can add olives to salad or have them as an on-the-go snack. ""We find these to be a lifesaver for our keto clients,"" says Shames. Olives offer a healthy monounsaturated source of fat; some even come in different flavors (like taco or sriracha). Pistachios 

Shames recommends single-serving packages of pistachios, too. ""Ninety percent of the fats found in pistachios are the better-for-you mono- and polyunsaturated type,"" says Shames. ""Plus, pistachios provide a good source of plant protein and fiber for a trio that can help to keep you fuller longer. ""

Almonds

Another nut that's high in fiber, healthy fat, and protein is almonds. Moore always recommends them as snacks for clients who are constantly busy and need snacks to keep them satiated throughout the day. You can easily pack single-serve packages ahead of time. 

Nutritional yeast

Nutritional yeast provides B12, a nutrient that many of us-especially vegans and vegetarians-just don't get enough of. It's also a source of protein without many carbs at all, says Lakatos. 

""Keto followers can sprinkle it on their meals for a cheesy flavor and they often use it to make keto-friendly breads and tortillas,"" says Lakatos. 

Chia seeds and flax seeds

You can use these seeds to coat meats, include them in bake goods, or make keto-friendly oatmeal and pudding, says Jalali. These pantry items are high in fiber, but low in carbs. 

Healthy frozen foods

Added items like frozen cauliflower pizza and frozen frittatas can make eating keo simple on mornings and nights when you're strapped for time. Nora Minno, an RD in New York City, loves this pizza, which contains only 16 grams of carbs for the whole pie.  Tofu

""Tofu is a great way to add plant-based protein into a diet that is typically heavy in animal protein and fat,"" says Minno. ""A 3-oz serving contains 80 calories, 4 grams of fat, 9 grams of protein and only 3 grams of carbs. You'll also be getting important micronutrients like calcium, iron, and potassium. ""

Low-carb pasta alternatives

""Shiratake noodles are a great low-carb pasta alternative with only 2 grams of carbs and 0 calories per bag,"" says Minno. 

Nut butter

A high-quality nut butter is a great keto snack, topping for flax crackers, and ingredient for keto fat bombs and desserts, says Lara Clevenger, RD and founder of The Keto Queens. 

Grass-fed beef tallow

Beef tallow is rich in omega 3 and CLA and is a ""high quality saturated fat which has a high smoke point and is great for cooking,"" says Clevenger. 

Chocolate

Yes, you can totally add chocolate to your shopping cart on the keto diet! Clevenger recommends Choc Zero. ""It's sugar-free chocolate, non-gmo, and contains no sugar alcohols or soy lecithin. It's not super bitter like some chocolate bars and tastes great and has a very good texture,"" she says. 

Keto-approved condiments

One of the trickiest things to shop for while keto? Dressings and condiments. Clevenger recommends low-sugar ketchup and BBQ sauce from Alterna Sweets. ""These sauces taste amazing and they all contain only 1 gram net carb per tablespoon,"" she says. As for salad dressing? Clevenger reaches for Primal Kitchen brand. ""These are sugar-free and keto-certified. ""Alternative flours

""Almond flour is one of my favorite baking ingredients,"" Moore says. It's also one of the most common keto-friendly, gluten-free, alternative flours.  ""The almonds provide satiating fiber and protein plus healthy fats,"" Moore adds.  She recommends it for making pie crusts and baking cookies and muffins. 

Coconut flour is another low-carb flour alternative that Moore suggests adding to your pantry. However, keep in mind that you can't just substitute the same amount in a recipe that calls for regular four. ""Because it is highly absorbent, you'll likely need to add more liquid to baked goods that use coconut flour,"" Moore says. 

Keto-friendly sweeteners

For a natural sugar substitute that's keto-compliant, consider stocking up on monk fruit, says Moore. Whether you're baking or looking to sweeten up your coffee, monk fruit is an option that won't take you out of ketosis. Erythritol is another common keto-friendly sugar substitute. Again, you'll want to use in keto-specific recipes since you can't swap in the same amount for a recipe that calls for sugar. 

Keto protein bars

To keep you full during the day, try a keto protein or energy bar that's high in healthy fats (like nuts and oils like avocado oil) and protein, but low in carbs. Keto Bar is a great option-they make a delicious chocolate peanut butter flavor. 

Keto granolas

You won't be able to buy regular cereals, as they'll be too high in carbs, but low-carb or grain-free, low sugar granolas like Lakanto Healthy Quick Breakfast Granola or Lark Ellen Farm Granola are a better choice. You can add milk to them or eat them with yogurt and breakfast is solved.",1,1732564814.0,HealthyZapper,0,1.0,False

","https://preview.redd.it/cq34fxiwr33e1.png?width=1225&format=png&auto=webp&s=bacbd0d8486ff81c1e22e15403511a54ebb8a8ac

Ever feel like your content is just floating out there, unnoticed? You‚Äôre not alone. In 2024, timing is **everything**. Social media is evolving fast, with new trends shaping the way we engage. Knowing the *best time to post* on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter can mean the difference between a viral hit and a quiet miss. Let‚Äôs dig into what really works this year.

# Why Timing Is More Important Than Ever

Social platforms are crowded. With millions of posts hitting feeds daily, finding the sweet spot to post isn‚Äôt just helpful ‚Äî it‚Äôs critical. Algorithms prioritize recent, engaging content. If your post doesn‚Äôt land when your audience is scrolling, it‚Äôs buried before anyone sees it.

Add in 2024‚Äôs **social trends**, and you‚Äôll notice people are more active at specific times based on the platform and their habits. This means you‚Äôve got to align your posting with when they‚Äôre most likely to be online.

# Facebook: The Classic Hub

Facebook's audience is a mixed bag. From college students sharing memes to grandparents commenting on family photos. Here‚Äôs a trick. In 2024, evenings are where it‚Äôs at. Think after dinner, when people are winding down and looking for something to scroll through.

* **Pro Tip**: Engagement spikes on weekdays. Mondays and Fridays tend to be golden because everyone‚Äôs either starting or ending their week.
* Watch for **video content** taking the lead. If you're uploading reels or stories, pair them with these times for better reach.

# Instagram: Where Trends Live

Instagram isn‚Äôt just about photos anymore. Stories, reels, and carousel posts dominate, and timing matters more than ever. Morning coffee scrolls and late-night binge sessions are your best bet. Catch them during those quiet moments.

* **Pro Tip**: Midweek action is üî•. People get into their routine, and that midweek boredom kicks in. Perfect for a scroll break.
* Reels are **king** this year. Pair trendy audio with posts and hit the upload button during prime hours for better traction.

# Twitter: Fast, Fresh, and Unfiltered

Twitter (or X) thrives on the now. It‚Äôs fast-paced, conversational, and very real-time. The best times? During commute hours and lunch breaks. Think about it. People are catching up on news, arguing over trending topics, or just checking in.

* **Pro Tip**: Keep it short, sharp, and snappy. If you‚Äôre adding visuals, they should grab attention instantly because people are scrolling at lightning speed.

# Trends To Watch in 2024

The *best time to post* is influenced by more than just schedules. Trends dictate how people interact with content.

* **AI-powered suggestions**: Platforms like Instagram are already pushing content based on user activity. That means even your timing strategy needs to consider what the algorithms want.
* **Cross-platform posting**: Share your TikToks on Instagram reels or your tweets on Facebook. Repurposing content boosts visibility.

# So, What‚Äôs the Takeaway?

In 2024, the *best time to post* isn‚Äôt just about luck. It‚Äôs about strategy. Know your audience, stay consistent, and align your posts with their habits. Timing plus good content equals the sweet spot for success.

Behind every other sociable office workers apolitical facade,  usually lies a set of beliefs just as incoherent  as your average libtard but with double the schizofrenia, and false sense of intelligence. Sometime in the last 12 months a shocking quantity of people really have gotten down with the idea of eating raw meat, raw milk, and vaccines causing autism. ""Small local farmers"" are once again the politically agreed upon sacred cow for food production, and more and more Americans believe that 99% of all food preservation techniques really should be abandoned. 

These positions are largely [ahistoric](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/surprisingly-intolerant-history-milk-180969056/). Small farmers are not only incredibly unproductive due to the simple logistics of modern farming, they have proven themselves untrustworthy with regards to human help. They do it every day on social media, claiming they ""do safe farming"" and this somehow deleted the pathogens inherently found in cows, while also retaining ""the good ones"" that they claim is the value of their raw milk. Vibes based agriculture is here.


Not only that, 97% of American farmland is owned by small farmers. It's hard to get a figure, but they seem to produce at most 25% of the food supply. This makes small time farming first and foremost a gigantic, oversubsidized, waste of space. Materially, they do a lot of work and own a lot of private property and do very little eith it. And now some of them are also willing to charge you a premium to circumvent food safety. And the fantastic thing for natural selection is that the number of raw milk and even raw meat and meat only consumers has vastly surpassed those that rightly want the united states to take a more precautionary food additive policy. No no no, we have to abolish safety regulation for small businesses. 


I hate small businesses, and if you're a Marxist. You should too. You may falsely believe the popular American narrative that small businesses are more social and communal than corporate businesses due to ownership proximity to its workers. What you will find is that small business owners in truth hate their workers far more than any financially driven disdain and oppression the corporation has. Because in their financially illiterate minds, the only thing standing between them and their intergenerational wealthy, never-work-again petit bourgeois delusion is their lazy greedy workers. Small business workers are, and have always behaved this way because they do not understand that under capitalism, the small business is either in a worthless market, or holding space for big capital to get around to replacing and putting out of business. See: pre-starbucks coffee shops for businesses holding space, and book stores for businesses that don't really have any earning potential. 


Its generally a bad arrangement for the person who writes your checks to see you as their primary competition. This is the conditions of most workers under small businesses.



Anyway.


I get it. We're doing the both sides thing and push back against historically ignorant conservatives dreaming of what could only inevitably be the self Inflicted famine that 
propagandists have accused communist states of daily for decades. The silver lining here is that RFK's requests are internally contradictory-you can't deregulate, cut and simultaneously increase standards and protections of the FDA at the same time. And trump hates most of his cabinet members most of the time, never keeping them around for long.



But log off and talk to your conservative neighbors, family, coworkers. The line between them and the dumbest Twitter feeds you've ever seen is getting blurry. These are smart people. Nobody is immune to propaganda. And the liberal conservatives all suddenly have really strong opinions about extreme dieting, which in terms of American history is really nothing now.


If you feel that your average trump voter is giving off really centrist answers about their beliefs, expose vague anti woke or anti government sentiment so they can fill in the gaps with their opinions. Try it. It's a fantastic way to lose respect for people.",6,1732564710.0,stupidpol,2,0.8,False

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caff√® Nero app (scanning the app when paying). 

I go for the Christmas special Millionaire hot chocolate as I don‚Äôt like coffee and ¬£2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Steps:

* Download the Caff√® Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/JNe8xFjdvLb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caff√® Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the ‚Äúwallet‚Äù section then ‚Äúvouchers‚Äù. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

I work in an office, standard 9-5 type place, but a handful of us get in early every day. The coffee machine is old so it takes a while to heat up and it's always out of water every morning. I started to notice everyone pretty much waited for me to turn the thing on and refill the water container even if they got in before me. At first I didn't mind, but it became incredibly frustrating when people were in before me and didn't start the process, but as soon as I got everything going and got my cup there's a line of people filling the break room. So I waited one day and grabbed some snacks in the break room, saw someone walk in, look at the machine, walk away, double back, and walk away again because it wasn't on and filled rather than doing it themselves. So what I started doing is making my cup of coffee, dumping the water out, and unplugging the machine and replugging it in so it has to reheat up because these lazy assholes were pissing me off so much. Like I said in the beginning, someone saw me unplugging it this morning and dump the water out and I hope they bought my story because I got zero push back. AITAH?",2,1732564049.0,AITAH,4,0.75,False

Besides the Aiden I‚Äôd be buying, I primarily use a Chemex and Aeropress to brew coffee so it seemed like the Ode would fit best. However, I do hope to own an espresso machine in the next few years or so (probably something like the Bambino Plus).

Would it be shortsighted to buy the Ode in case I do end up one day having an espresso machine? Or is the Ode worth buying over the Opus since pour over coffee is my primary brewing method for the foreseeable future?

She normally pays for her groceries then gets coffee at the end of her shopping trip, but this time she got coffee before paying, and when she was done just spaced and walked out. Then she went back inside and bought bread (waited in line and payed for it) because she forgot to get it the first time. Clearly an accidental situation.

She received a phone call from the police asking her to come to the station with a receipt which she obviously does not have, and when she arrived the police called the store and refused to explain my wife‚Äôs point of view on the situation and just asked if the store wanted to do the usual (press charges).

# Training

I was a D3 runner and ran throughout high school and college, I was pretty good but hardly amazing, 25:20ish 8k XC, 14:57 5k, 3:56 1500, but that was 10-15 years ago now. I fell off pretty quickly after college, I‚Äôd start running the spring and max out at maybe 2-3 \~5mi runs per week over the summer before stopping completely in the winter. I‚Äôd stopped running completely for a few years before I started running seriously again in Apr 2023, after a couple work friends had put together an easy challenge group on strava. I quickly remembered my love for running especially with the new developments in shoes and smartwatches. I slowly built up my mileage throughout 2023, peaking around 50 mpw before taking \~3 weeks off for a long vacation.

In January I decided I was going to race again, and set my sights on a local half-marathon for the spring with the Philly marathon in the fall. I used a Pfitz 12/55 AM plan for the half, since my eventual goal was marathons and I wanted to get used to that training instead of a half-marathon specific plan. I pretty much guessed at 6:45 for mp and 6:20 for threshold. In retrospect these paces were on the easy side since I ran 78:40, blowing my sub-80 goal out of the water. I slowly rebuilt to 55 mpw, targeting a Pfitz 18/70 plan for Philly that started mid July.

18/70 got off to a bit of rough start. I had some patellar tracking issues a week or two before the plan started and went to PT for those, but I ran through it. In the 2^(nd) or 3^(rd) week I had a twinge in my hamstring during an LT workout, I tried running through it but the pain wasn‚Äôt going away so I ended up taking a couple days off, missing a long run and hill workout then doing a couple easy runs. Luckily this was about the last of it. The rest of the training went well, I was using 6:15-6:20 MP and 5:55 LT for paces. With 10 weeks to go I ran the Philly Distance Run in place of the 20mi long run and skipped the 6mi LT that week, ended up running 75:45 which was quite a bit better than expected, I was just hoping to run my previous PB (78:40) or slightly better since it was the middle of a training block. I adjusted my paces to 6:00-6:05 MP and 5:40-5:45 LT based on that race. The 7mi LT was a bit of a miss after adjusting the paces, but otherwise the rest of the block went well. I‚Äôve never taken well to taper so I felt kinda rough the last 2-3 weeks and was worried I‚Äôd overcooked the last 3 long runs (I absolutely did) but told myself it was just mental and that all the training was there. I did have some hamstring and calf pain in my right leg during the taper but I ran through it and it went away in the last week, I also still would have raced if it didn‚Äôt.

It's worth noting this was my first marathon and I was pants-shittingly nervous the last week.

# Pre-race

I live about an hour outside the city so I was up promptly at 4am, did a \~10 min shakeout run, wolfed down 2 english muffins and made coffee and hopped in the car with my girlfriend around 4:45. We drove to my Dads house just outside the city and he drove us the rest of the way to the starting area and parked (big shoutout to my dad here, fuck parking), no traffic on the way in thankfully, we arrived at the entry gates around 6:15. This did end up cutting my ideal warm-up a bit short, I probably should have just done my usual 10-15min jog outside the gates then changed shoes and stripped down to race fit+jacket outside the security area but I went straight in and did a \~6 min job before getting changed in the gear check line. Luckily the race was also running a tad late (15 mins or so). It ended up being 42ish at the start with low wind so near perfect. I‚Äôd been debating arm sleeves but ended up deciding against them, but did wear gloves. I thrifted 2 jackets to wear on the start and ditched them after speeches.

For fuel I‚Äôd decided on 1 Maurten Caf-100 before the start, then alternating non-caf and caf every 4 miles up to 16 where I‚Äôd switch to my 250mL soft-flask of 4 scoops of Skratch Hi-Carb. I had also meant to eat a Maurten bar an hour or so before the race but I forgot it in the pre-race confusion.

# Race

I‚Äôd love to say I had a plan other than stick to 6:00 ish with some give on the hills, but no I really didn‚Äôt. I started around the front of A corral and ran what felt like MP. ¬†My watch (Apple Watch S8 using workoutdoors) was a bit off the first 2 mi, claiming low 5:40s but I trusted my body, turns out I was right on. A pack formed a bit ahead of me and started breaking away, and the dormant XC athlete in me told me to run with them, but I suppressed it and stuck to my guts and let them get away, I caught many of them in the end. I‚Äôm so used to running alone at this point that it‚Äôs difficult for me to use other runners to my advantage, so I mostly just set my own pace and stuck to it. The plan was 6:00s but I really wanted the sub 6 average and I hit 5:55 ish for most of the race.

The one thing that struck me throughout the race was how familiar everything was. My running career really started in HS in Philly and I‚Äôd run almost the entire course over many runs throughout the years. It was so, so cool to run through my home city, through the buildings, streets, and monuments I‚Äôd walked past, the parks I‚Äôd run through, the assorted historic neighborhoods we‚Äôd toured in high school, and of course the godforsaken river loop. I still can‚Äôt get over how perfect a morning we were blessed with.

It's crazy to me how hard a 14mi MP tempo can feel during training and yet 16 miles into the race I felt amazing. It wasn‚Äôt until Manayunk (\~20mi ish) when the miles really caught up with me, up until then I‚Äôd thought I‚Äôd be able to drop to 5:40s at the end for a fast finish, but every mile in Manayunk started to drag and I wondered just how far out the turn around was. I also learned around then that I‚Äôd used slightly too much powder in my flask and it was like drinking syrup. I got a couple sips in, probably half of it in total down but not nearly as much as I‚Äôd wanted. As we exited Manayunk and descended into no-mans land I was hurting and I knew it was going to be a rough finish.

Somehow, I persisted without falling apart, in the last 3 miles I was pretty much just yelling at myself not to walk, and just to finish the race. If you‚Äôd asked me my pace in the last 3 I would have said 7, 8 minute miles maybe, how I managed to hold it together and only fall to 6:10s is beyond my understanding and one of the gutsiest moments of my entire running career.

As I came up the accursed ‚Äúhill‚Äù coming up to the art museum, wishing that some higher power would smite me, I saw that I hadn‚Äôt relented, that my not-even-A-goal was miraculously (literally) in sight, and I powered through. 2:36:54, 5:59 pace.

# Post-race

Really wish they had put actual seats in the finisher area, but I would also probably still be sitting there if there were. My legs have never been so dysfunctional. I managed to make it out and get my gear though, and after waiting for some old teammates to finish we made the long walk to the car. I really would have liked to hang out in the city longer but un/fortunately I had a thanksgiving dinner to attend, so that‚Äôll be another day.

Next year I‚Äôm currently thinking I‚Äôll run Burlington in May, and hopefully qualify for New York with my Philly time. I‚Äôll target 80mpw and might try a JD plan instead of Pfitz since it seems more flexible, and my work gets busy in spring.

In the end I couldn‚Äôt ask for a more perfect race, on a more perfect day, in the city where it all began, for my first marathon and the real start of my post-collegiate career. Thank you Philadelphia.

I pay money, I get my things/service, I leave. I am trying my best to be polite and reasonable, and judge the business purely on the things they provide.

But after I move to NYC, I start to get the sense of ""things around me""...it's hard to describe, although I can still be absolutely anonymous at any time and retreat to my apartment being cozy and alone, I start to feel strongly the presence of the ""umwelt"" (physical environment, people, things happening around, etc etc). Weirdly, I start to think I should know the people better if I see them often. 

I one day asked the gym front desk lady her name (btw I'm F so that's not too awkward) - I just saw her the most frequently. Our gym is pretty small and cozy and people kinda know each other by the face and nod to each other if no other interactions. Honestly we don't talk beyond I say ""hey \[her name\]""; 

Then I asked the name of the barrista/onwer of the cafe I frequent. We talk about coffee sometimes. 

I attempted to ask the fruit guy's name (I see him the most, just downstairs) but it seems that his English is not very good...

I wonder how common it is in NYC to know your business owners personally. How much do you know about them, and do you talk? Do you consider them being your acquitances, or even friends? ",0,1732563833.0,AskNYC,7,0.5,False

","After going through hell and back with Vyvanse, I found out stimulants are not for me. The focus was great, the mood effects, for someone who was already very uppity, did not mesh well. I tried to manage my symptoms with diet/exercise, and all that other BS‚Äî it didn't work. (I mean exercise helps, I hate that, but I digress.) 

So now I've been prescribed guanfacine/Intuniv to help with my emotional regulation and general sense of overwhelm. I've been on it nearly two weeks now and holy crow, is this what normies feel like all the time? I'm calm (well... calm for me.) I still have emotional ups and downs, but instead of tsunami waves that take over, I feel like I'm in control. My RSD which was CRIPPLING after I stopped taking Vyvanse, seems like it's manageable. My brain still has many voices and thoughts, but it feels less like a house on fire with everyone screaming and more like a boisterous environment. I love it. 

The negative‚Äî the acid reflux and heartburn. It's not *terrible* since I've adjusted my diet. Not drinking alcohol. Only having 1 coffee, after breakfast and a warm cup of water with ACV. No spicy food, etc. I understand it takes a while for a body to get used to a new medication, but I was wondering if anyone else experienced a similar side effect and did it ever go away? I can keep the adjusted diet for a few weeks or even a couple months if need be. But a life without spicy food and the occasional nice glass of wine doesn't seem worth living, yknow? (And yes just ONE glass of wine wreaks havoc on my digestive system.)

I've been on the meds for 2 weeks‚Äî week 1 I was on 1mg, and week 2 I've been bumped up to 2mg. I'm so torn about how I feel mentally versus physically. Hoping this sorts itself out, but in the interim, I was curious about others' experiences. 

TLDR: Started guanfacine/Intuniv two weeks ago, bumped up to 2mg after the first week. Mentally feeling great. Physically, anything that can trigger heartburn/acid reflux does. Did you experience this? If so, did it ever go away?",1,1732563766.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False
1gzrsn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToastPOS/comments/1gzrsn1/abbreviations_for_menu_items_not_updating_for_all/,Abbreviations for Menu Items Not Updating for All Dining Options,"Hi! This might be a niche problem but hoping someone has come across it before. Support has been mainly clueless as to what is the problem. In Toast Admin, we have added abbreviations or shortened names for many menu items in the POS field as well as the kitchen field in order to fit all the important descriptions of said items. This mainly impacts on drink tickets at our coffee bar. For example, item name might be ""Pumpkin Spice Latte - 16oz"" and we want the shortened name on the POS and drink tickets to show ""PSL 16oz"". 

The issue is: when our staff selects ""Dine-In"" as the dining option, the abbreviations are present on the drink tickets. However, when they select ""Takeout"" as the dining option, the abbreviations are not present and default back to the  full menu item title. We have several locations on Toast and it impacts us across the board. I've tried changing the ""Behavior"" configurations in Dining Options so that ""Takeout"" acts like ""Dine-In"", but I'm met with error messages saying one of my locations is using that dining option type already. IDK anymore. Has anyone run into this or maybe know more about how the Name fields for menu items behave across dining options? Appreciate any help. Thanks!",1,1732563752.0,ToastPOS,0,1.0,False

Well, I've just spent the past few days in the UAE, Qatar, and Pakistan, and it's now become quite apparent that the same phenomenon can be observed in these countries as well. I visited a few museums in Abu Dhabi and Doha that had attendants in every single room and gallery, presumably to make sure you don't touch anything, as well as more attendants wandering around outside, in common areas, doing who knows what; I guess they make sure people don't get lost. There are people who just stand outside the bathrooms (not the bathroom attendants, who are a completely different set of people present as well).

Right now I'm staying at what might be described as a mid-range guest house in Karachi, and  it seems like they've got someone for everything: an armed guard out front, a person to open the door for you (despite it not being locked or difficult to open), someone to carry takeout bags for you (even if you have to go outside to pay the delivery man, there will be someone to walk with you back to the room holding the food...), someone to fill your water bottle from the water cooler (it's in the kitchen and they won't let you in there as a guest, even though it's right next to the door), someone to turn on the AC in the lobby if you decide to sit there for a few minutes.

I just spent the day at a nice coworking space and they seemed very overstaffed; once again, an armed guard out front (all the nice caf√©s, shops, and restaurants around here seem to have armed guards sitting out front, often of a certain age and with a long beard), someone to open the door, someone to serve you coffee from a MACHINE (every other coworking space I've been to has had the same kind of  self-service coffee machine, but here they have someone stand next to it to press the button for you...), someone to bring a glass and fill it with water from the water cooler (once again they won't let you do it yourself).

Afterward I visited a small bookstore that had \*three people\* on duty, one to man the cash register and two to just walk around in case you need help; it's one small room.

I guess when you have such a densely populated country you kind of need to invent jobs for people to avoid a massive unemployment crisis. I still find all these people waiting on me all the time to be pretty annoying, though; sometimes I just want to be left alone. What other cultures are like this?

My husband likes to sit in our family room and watch football, sport shows, etc. We have an open floor plan home where the kitchen & family room are merged and our large screen tv is in the central hub of the house on the first floor.  

My husband spent most of the weekend watching games while I was out & about with our houseguest. About 9pm Sunday night, I found myself alone in the family room & sat down to watch a show after clearing dishes, etc. Apparently my husband had gone upstairs to take a shower. Upon returning to the family room he asked if I was ‚Äúkicking him out‚Äù.  I said no, I was just watching tv. He said he‚Äôd go to our bedroom to watch his show. I detected a bit of irritation in his voice but I ignored it.  

This morning I came downstairs to make  breakfast; my husband was leaving to run an errand. While I went upstairs he told our guest not to turn off the tv or change the channel because he was watching a show and wanted to rewind what he missed while out. So our guest and I didn‚Äôt touch the tv while drinking our coffee & having breakfast. 

When my husband  returned an hour later, I mentioned privately that I didn‚Äôt change the channel but I thought it was a bit much of him to ask that we not considering he wasn‚Äôt even home to use the tv and it‚Äôs an ESPN show which will obviously run again today. He got angry and said I was trying to make him feel like a jerk; that it wasn‚Äôt a big request. I pointed out that it‚Äôs a shared living space, that he tends to commandeer it, and he‚Äôd used it all weekend without interruption as I was gone & our DD was on her tablet or in our room.  It felt a bit unfair. I told him that it seemed self centered and a bit entitled. I truly attempted to give my perspective without being hostile but he still got mad even though I had complied with his request & hadn‚Äôt changed channel.  AITA?

Reasons why I could be the *sshole:  There is a tv in our bedroom & guest room. Our houseguest and/or I could‚Äôve gone to those areas to drink our coffee & watch a bit of morning news before work. I may be childish for arguing over a tv at all.",1,1732563343.0,AmItheAsshole,18,0.67,False

I'm more focused on fitness related activities and hobby groups like board games. 

I know the generic advice is to avoid people like this but I just want to know why? 

My reasons for losing interest in parties:

1. All you do is just talk and dance. I hate small talk and dancing. I prefer in-depth conversations over a cup of coffee than generic topics like the weather or ""my job sucks"". 

2. Most of the time, these parties are way too late in the night. I live 30 miles from the main central business district and driving home half-awake sucks. 

3. Because I drive a lot, I can't drink alcohol which these parties often tend to have plenty of. I don't drink anymore and being a teetotaler is often a red flag to a lot of people. 

4. Loud-ass music. I have tinnitus. I hate overly loud music as well as the party beats they play in clubs.

I am not able to add the option for my customer to select their grind size on the product options page unless I add inventory for each variant, which doesn't work for me. 

I would like to give the customer the option to customize their order. 
Once they click checkout, I want to add a pop-up that asks the customer how they would like their coffee Ground (whole bean, medium, fine, etc.)

I'd like to upsell the customer with the option to upgrade their order for free shipping.

1gzriez,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hair/comments/1gzriez/this_is_how_ive_gotten_my_hair_loss_under_control/,This is how I've gotten my hair loss under control- ,"For context, my hair used to be very very long + looked quite healthy. It was not super thick/ thin. 

I have fine, dark brown hair that is naturally wavy, but I like to blow dry it straight. 

About a year ago, I noticed my hair becoming more dull, with split ends- Then it started to fall out (more than usual, for me). 

Obviously, I freaked out... + Researched tf out of everything I was experiencing. 

Now, knock on wood, I seem to have the situation kind of under control/ heading in the right direction, + this is everything I changed.

DO:
1. Shower head filter

A lot of places have hard water, which can contribute to hair loss/ dullness. Buy a little shower head filter online + install it. If anything, it'll give you some peace of mind. 

2. Vitamins/ Supplements 

I now take Vitamin D, Magnesium, Saw Palmetto, DIM, Zinc, Fish Oil, + Viviscal. Sometimes an iron pill as well. 

I know... It's a lot lol... I don't take every single one every day, but I take all of them a couple times throughout the week. 

Oh I also eat a few brazil nuts every day for selenium or something haha- Idk if that's been helping, but I don't think it's hurting me.

3. Diet/ Hydration

Make sure to eat enough protein. 
DRINK WATER.

Reduce caffeine. If you like coffee (I do), try decaf- Or just stick to 1 caffeinated drink per day. 

4. Hair Products

Make sure your shampoo/ conditioner isn't a brand that is known to cause hair loss!! 
Research tf out of every single thing you put in your precious hair. 

Beware Olaplex... Lmao, I learned the hard way- That Olaplex should only be used occasionally. Not every time you wash your hair. They have great products, just make sure you use them sparingly. 

I like RedKen + Moroccan Oil + Aveda products (for the most part). 

HEAT PROTECTANT. If you use styling tools, make sure to use heat protection. Research them, find one you like, + be consistent. 

I'm currently using Color Wow Dream Coat Supernatural Spray... I love it so far :)

5. Washing Schedule 

Don't wash your hair too often. I try to go at least 3 days between washes- Most times, I can go 4, but I never go more than 5 days. 

If your hair gets flat/ dirty looking quickly, try washing only the very front pieces. This way, you can avoid washing your entire head, but still look/ feel nice + clean. 

On the last day before I wash it, I usually opt for a claw clip style-

6. Styling

Anddd you'll all hate me, but I love to blow dry my hair. I know, it's probably the reason for the dullness/ hair loss, but I can't live without a nice, sleek blowout. 

To avoid excessive damage, I've invested in a nice hair dryer (Dyson Airwrap). It causes less damage + I have a lot of fun with the attachments. 

I blow dry my hair straight after almost every wash. Taking the time to section, spray with heat protection, + dry on low heat with a round brush, means I only have to style my hair once every 3 or 4 days. 

Plus, putting the work in to do a nice blowout, means that I don't have to go over it with a straightener or curling wand. 

7. Sleep

Sleeping enough is super important. 
A silk pillowcase is also nice :) 

Make sure you're getting 7 to 8 hours almost every night. Taking a magnesium supplement will help you sleep better btw!

8. Stress 

This one is really hard to fix. Honestly, I'm still working on it-

My job is extremely stressful + I was in a pretty bad car accident a few months ago, both of which I suspect contributed to my hair issues.

To reduce stress, I've done the following:
-  Journal
-  Go for walks outside 
-  Switch to decaf (Seriously, reduce caffeine)
-  Prioritize sleep
-  Talk to someone you trust (Friend, parent, partner, therapist)
-  Mindfulness/ meditation/ prayer

DON'T:
1. Chemical Hair Treatments

If you're worried about hair loss, DO NOT GET A BRAZILIAN BLOWOUT. Worst mistake ever. 

I would also caution against keratin treatments and bleach. It's just not great for people prone to hair loss- 

2. Starve

Rapid weight loss is known to cause hair loss... Beware restrictive diets + medications that cause weight loss. You'll probably notice dull and thinning hair as a side effect. 

OK! This is all I can think of for now! ü©∂
I really really hope this helps someone who is experiencing hair loss-

Maybe I missed something but afaik it doesn't get specified later on why does he drink coffe if he hates it.   
So as a fellow ADHDer the first thing I though of is that he drank it to somehow calm himself, since coffeine can have a calming effect on people with this condition. (Also, I just drank some coffee for the exact same reason before reading this part of the book so the connection was kinda obvious.) He obviously was in a terrible mood so for me this is the most probable explanation.

My workflow has improved significantly, however, I still am yet to make a great cup.

I've been following a lot of the advice Lance Hendrick mentions in his videos (specifically his V60 dialing in video).

Currently I am doing a 1:17 ratio on a honey-process El Salvador from square mile coffee using the following recipe:

15g coffee at an 8 grind size on Fellow Ode 2 (fairly coarse)

Water 95¬∞C

2 Pours:

First pour of 45g and bloom for 1:30min
Second pour at ~6g/s until 250g final weight
Slight swirl to settle bed after reaching final weight (not immediately after pouring)

Total brew time between 3 to 3:30mins.

So far I've had one cup which was very close (interesting my first cup with the grinder) where I could taste most of the flavour notes and I truly enjoyed but believed it could be better, all the rest have been meh.

I've been messing around with different grind sizes and bloom durations but nothing seems to be giving me a full-flavoured cup, everything just seems muted with no prominent flavours coming through.

Would anyone have any suggestions as to where I might be going wrong? I've noticed a lot of fines being produced, is that to be expected or do I maybe have some aligned issues on the Ode?",3,1732562908.0,pourover,4,1.0,False
1gzrfsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs_Archives/comments/1gzrfsr/metallic_glasses_status_and_prospects_for/,"""Metallic Glasses: Status and Prospects for Aerospace Applications"" (AAWSAP DIRD) Analysis","[This DIRD](https://documents2.theblackvault.com/documents/dia/AAWSAP-DIRDs/DIRD_01_Metallic_Glasses_for_Aerospace_Applications.pdf) is rather dry, but upon a second look it's interesting for a few reasons. It's talking about a relatively new kind of metal (first publicly discovered in the 50's by German scientists) that are not crystalline. This allows them to be manufactured like thermoplastics and also allows for the creation of metal foams with incredible strength to weight ratios, increased insulation, increased deformation resistance, shape retention, etc. This new class of material is literally pioneered by trial-and-error mixing of metals, which means the ability to run complex computations for predictive analysis could cause an explosion in new advanced materials science. 

In this 2017 article titled, ""[Metallic glass, the next disruptive material for Future Space and Military applications, coming of Age](https://idstch.com/technology/materials/metallic-glass-a-promising-future-spacecraft-and-military-material-coming-of-age/)"" it details the most recent advances pushing this new material to potentially displace stainless steel and traditional alloys. 

In this 2004 article titled, ""[Glassy Metals May Be Materials of the Future](https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/glassy-metals-may-be-materials-of-the-future)"" the author explains how the amazing properties of this metal remind him of old UFO lore.

>The wispy metal strip in my hands is 8 inches long, 1 inch wide, and as thin as aluminum foil.

>‚ÄúTry to tear it,‚Äù says William Johnson, a materials science professor at Caltech in Pasadena.

>I pull‚Äîfirst gently, but soon with all my might. No go.

>‚ÄúSee if you can cut this,‚Äù suggests Johnson‚Äôs postgraduate assistant Jason Kang, handing me a mirror-bright piece of the same metal. It‚Äôs an inch long, a quarter inch wide, and thinner than a dime. I bear down with a heavy-duty pair of wire cutters. The metal will not cut. I try again, squeezing with both hands until my fingers ache. Nothing.

>But the most amazing act in this show is yet to come.

>‚ÄúWatch,‚Äù says Johnson. From a height of about two feet, he drops a steel ball onto a brick-size chunk of the metal. The ball bounces so high and for so long‚Äî1 minute and 17 seconds, with a metronomic tick, tick, tick‚Äîthat it looks unreal, like some kind of cinematic special effect. ‚ÄúWhen you try that with regular steel, it goes ‚Äòclunk, clunk, clunk‚Äô and stops,‚Äù says Johnson. If the metal were glued to an unyielding surface such as concrete (instead of sitting on Johnson‚Äôs oak coffee table, which absorbs a lot of the energy), ‚Äúthe ball would bounce for more than two minutes,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done it.‚Äù

>It‚Äôs all astounding, yet oddly familiar. In the typical science fiction film circa 1950, there‚Äôs that scene in which scientists return from the just-landed flying saucer and tell the Army brass that no tool known to humankind can cut, burn, bend, or otherwise scar the hull. But the metal in front of me is decidedly terrestrial in origin‚Äîit was developed in Pasadena, specifically in the lab down the hall from Johnson‚Äôs office.

>It is called metallic glass, or amorphous metal, and it appears to be nothing less than an entirely new class of material that can be used to build lighter, stronger versions of anything. ‚ÄúEverything from an Abrams tank to an F-16 jet to a bicycle can be made out of this, and because it is two to three times the strength of conventional alloys, you can halve the weight or more. That‚Äôs not evolutionary, it‚Äôs revolutionary,‚Äù says Johnson. ‚ÄúThis is the structural material of the future.‚Äù

Reducing weight by more than half while maintaining or even increasing strength is something can change how we try to analyze UFO events. For example, when determining assumptions to try to calculate the energy requirements this will drastically reduce the value of the conclusion such as in the Nimitz event. It should also change the way we analyze heating due to frictional forces. Foams are known to create amazing insulative properties when made out of materials with high melting points. 

I'd also like to point out that I've been a bit obsessed with the [vacuum balloon concept](https://medium.com/predict/vacuum-balloon-technology-may-be-closer-than-you-think-26a9f0fc47b4?sk=b9855057a7bf48c25ff4a070e5385d05) for years and it is now apparent that metallic glass foams are prime candidates for actual practical vacuum balloon designs and not just prototype demonstrations using polymers and/or glass foams. 

Is metallic glass reverse engineered technology? I don't personally think so at this point, but it's conceivable if a real UFO was retrieved and it used this technology, it could eventually be reverse engineered and maybe skip some time intensive trial and error research or massive investments in computational power. It's a provocative idea for sure. Reverse engineered NHI technology or not, it's fascinating technology that we do understand and it's hard to ignore the idea that if there are more advanced than us NHI crafts out there that they wouldn't be using this kind of technology in place of traditional metals.",1,1732562895.0,UFOs_Archives,1,1.0,False

Here‚Äôs some context, I have an ex-friend from roughly 2 and a half years ago. Let‚Äôs call her Smurf. We mutually decided to end the friendship because it was getting super toxic, she wasn‚Äôt respecting my boundaries and would randomly show up to my house, blow up my phone if I didn‚Äôt respond and the friendship was deteriorating. 

I‚Äôve been focusing on developing healthy friendships since then and I legit haven‚Äôt heard from her since‚Ä¶ until this last weekend 

I slept in and woke up around 10am. I remember coming downstairs and having breakfast. I decided I wanted to go to the local supermarket to re-up on some groceries. I open my front door and lo and behold, there‚Äôs a basket full of trinkets and gifts at my front door. It‚Äôs not in a box, no sign of an address and it‚Äôs perfectly perched on my welcome mat.  

I bring it inside and inspect everything. There‚Äôs 3 mini Yankee candles, a coffee mug, a bath bomb, a pair of fluffy socks and a box of chocolates. Beneath this all is a letter. I open it up and it‚Äôs handwritten and signed with my ex-friends name. I won‚Äôt share all except what‚Äôs important. She essentially stated that this was a gesture to apologise for her behaviour when we used to be friends. I immediately noticed the seal on the chocolate box was broken. I opened it and they all looked fine but I had this gut feeling not to eat it. I didn‚Äôt even want to unwrap the bath bomb or look at anything else. It felt super random.

It wasn‚Äôt packaged in a delivery box or had a return address which means she must‚Äôve hand delivered or got someone to put it outside my front door.

Today I received texts from an unsaved number (Smurf). She was asking if I had received the gifts and if I‚Äôd liked them, and if I had read her letter, as if we were friends and speak on a regular basis. I didn‚Äôt respond until a couple hours and I was honest with her, I said I didn‚Äôt expect it, although it was a kind gesture it was super random. She said it was her way of saying sorry. She then became super fixated on whether I ate the chocolates yet or not. FYI I‚Äôve dumped the entire basket in the trash this morning, I wanted to give it to a neighbour but I decided against it. 

I haven‚Äôt responded to her yet and she keeps asking if I‚Äôve eaten them.

Very calm and grounded. When we initially matched we had good chats - and he was telling me that he gets anxious and nervous a lot so excuse the late replies on his part (very sweet). A couple days later he actually said he enjoyed the conversation and would love to meet up for coffee - and I saw that message a few days later because my friend passed away. I explained and apologized and said I‚Äôd still love to meet him but I need to grieve this loss and take some time, and suggested we keep in touch on instagram. And he was very understanding and compassionate- that struck. I see guys being nice, but compassionate? That‚Äôs rare. 

So fast forward about 2 weeks later I dropped him a message on Instagram and it was just small talk and general conversation from there. I told him last week that ‚ÄúI know we said we‚Äôll reschedule coffee so let me know when you‚Äôre free and let‚Äôs meet up!‚Äù - so since then we‚Äôve been going back and forth trying to figure out some time bc both our schedules are crazy. And whatever small spots I could find in my calendar didn‚Äôt work for him since he said ‚Äúbut it wouldn‚Äôt be enough time‚Äù - fair enough. And it‚Äôs nice he WANTS to spend time. But tbh the million back and forth did kill the spark and I‚Äôm sure he felt that too. 

Then we actually locked in some time last Friday - Lo and behold I got sick. Dropped him a text that it‚Äôs a raincheck and I‚Äôm avoiding travel and cancelled all my meetings too, and to lmk if Wednesday works.  Again he said ‚ÄúNo problem at all. I‚Äôll let you know about Wednesday because I might have to drop in at work.‚Äù So that‚Äôs a no. And I told him ‚Äúgreat, we‚Äôll figure this out and I‚Äôll wait to hear from you‚Äù

Today is Monday and I haven‚Äôt heard back. I really like the guy. What do I do? Should I swallow my pride and ask for a do-over?

This seems extra important with the uptick of scout bots regarding the Reddit post about the scout network.

Obelisk Protection Plugin Features:

Wealth Threshold Protection: Set a custom GP threshold to activate protection
Configurable Ground Marker: Shows a ""Protection Active"" text when risky
Intelligent Risk Calculation:

Checks both inventory and equipped items
Excludes the 3 most valuable items from risk calculation

User is doing wilderness slayer with 3 items and isn't at risk of losing wealth, obelisk functions as normal while the plugin is active


How it Works:
When you're in your POH and about to use the Wilderness Portal Obelisk, the plugin will:

Calculate the total value of your items
Compare it to your set threshold
Prevent teleportation if you're carrying too many valuables
Optionally display a ground marker to warn you
keeps your wilderness slayer intact while 3 iteming intact

Configuration Options:

Set your personal wealth threshold (default 1M GP)
Toggle ground marker visibility
Customize marker color

Installation:

Open RuneLite
Go to Plugin Hub
Search ""Obelisk Protection""
Install and configure!
if you haven't quit out of runelite in the past hour, you may run into a buggy version. Simply close out of runelite and reopen it to get the latest version of the plugin

I, 28 Female, and my boyfriend, 30 Male, met at a party thrown by a famous actor that we are both friends with. It was a pool party on the 1st of July, and we were both there. At first, we did not really see each other or were interested. After a few drinks, it got dark, and things started to get heated. Everyone was a little drunk and handsy with each other. I was in the hot tub with one of my friends when he came and joined us. After a little while of talking, he started to kiss me and grab me down there. I was shocked, but I did not stop him because I actually liked it; it was a while ago, you know. My friend left the hot tub to give us some space, and that‚Äôs when it really got heated. We decided to have some privacy and go to the bathroom upstairs and lock the door. We had the most amazing sex, and after that, we started seeing each other more often. We went on some romantic dates, and we even went to Thailand together for a few weeks. Once we came back home, we decided we wanted to meet each other's parents, so we scheduled that. First, I got to meet his amazing, sweet, and supportive parents and grandma. I stayed over for dinner and helped his grandma make the most amazing empanadas because he has Spanish roots. We had an amazing time, and my mother-in-law was already in her head planning the wedding. That just feels amazing if you have supportive in-laws, if you are so in love, and you know for sure that this man is the one! After a week, we took a flight to San Diego, where my parents live, so he could meet them. Once we arrived at the airport, our parents and my little sister picked us up with a huge bouquet of red roses; they were beautiful. I wanted to grab the roses, but she did not let go and gave them to my boyfriend. I did not think much of it at the time, but looking back, it was probably where it all began. We stayed in San Diego for about four days and then got back to our hometown. Once we got back, he acted a little strange; he sometimes did not want to kiss me or touch me, and we did not have sex as much as we used to. I thought maybe he was just not feeling well, or maybe because he had so much stress at work, so I moved on from it. A few weeks later, it was around Christmas, and both of our families came to us to celebrate Christmas and New Year's at our place. We had a huge house that I bought back in 2022; it had five bedrooms and four baths, so we had enough space to let them all stay with us. My mom was super nice to my boyfriend and was always in his presence. The night before Christmas, I woke up, and he was not next to me. I listened to see if I could hear him on the toilet or maybe in the kitchen or something. I did not hear anything, so I left it and went back to bed. Christmas morning I woke up, and he was next to me again. I left it and woke him up so we could make breakfast for our family. We got out, had coffee, and started making breakfast. Once we were done, we decided to wake up our parents. He told me he would do it so I could get ready. Our parents were awake, and he came into our closet to get himself ready as well. I could not let the thing from the night go, and I asked him where he was because I woke up and could not find him. I think he was a little shocked because he turned all red and did not answer immediately. He said he was in the bathroom downstairs because he had some stomach ache and did not want to wake me up. I did not say anything and chose to believe him. We then moved on and spent the day with our family and had a great time. One thing that really stood out to me, and my little sister, is that our mom was super close with my boyfriend. For my sister to notice that really bothered me, so I asked him again if everything was alright and why he was always with my mom or disappearing with her. He told me that they were planning something, but he could not tell me about it because it was supposed to be a surprise. The evening came, and we all had presents for each other. My mom had a present for my boyfriend, and you will never believe what it was‚Ä¶. It was a bondage set‚Ä¶ LIKE WHAT. I was shocked, and so were my parents-in-law, my dad, and my sister. I laughed it off, and we went on with unwrapping presents. Later, we went to bed, and I asked if we were ever going to use that because it‚Äôs kind of scary for me. He said probably not, laughed, and said it was more like a joke that my mom got him this as a present because she did not know what else to give him. I said okay, whatever, and went to sleep.

That night I woke up again, and guess what? He was awake and had just come back to bed, and again he had stomach problems‚Ä¶.. I went back to sleep, kind of angry but also in denial, because it could never be true that he was doing something with my mom; there is no way.

When I woke up, I went to the only bedroom that was not occupied those few days and saw that the sheets were a little messy, not like I would put them. I then decided that I would set an alarm for the time that he was not in bed the last two nights to figure out where he really was at that time. It actually felt awful doing this because if I'm wrong, it would mess up my life, but if I‚Äôm right, it would mess up even more lives, including my dad's and my sister's.

The night came, and I set an alarm for around 2 AM; that is when my boyfriend was gone both nights. He didn't even give me a goodnight kiss. It was really hard to get to sleep with all of these feelings, but I tried anyway. My 2 AM alarm went off, and again, he was not in bed with me. I took my phone and put on the flashlight. I first looked everywhere on the second floor, but he was nowhere. Then I went downstairs; I looked in the bathroom where he said he was the last two nights, and he was not there. I looked in the kitchen and in the unoccupied bedroom, but still no one was there. I was so confused‚Äîthen where was he? I went back upstairs and decided to check in the bedroom where my mom and dad were supposed to sleep. I checked with my little flashlight, but just my dad was in the bed, and unfortunately, I woke him up. He asked me what was going on, and I told him that I could not find my boyfriend and that my mom was not in bed with him. He said maybe my mom was with my sister. That could be, so I checked my sister's room, but still no mom. I went back to my dad and told him that she was not with my sister and that I checked the whole house, but no one was here except for him, my sister, and my parents-in-law. My dad was so confused also, so he put on some clothes and started to search together with me. I talked to him and told him about my feelings and what I think might be going on. He did not say much because it could be, but I think he hoped this was not the case. We looked everywhere; we checked if the cars were still there, and they were. Then we thought maybe we should check out the pool and the hot tub. Once we opened the door to the patio where the hot tub is, we heard it; we heard the hot tub running‚Ä¶. Our hearts started pounding. We looked around the corner because we did not want to be seen, and there they were. They were moaning and using the bondage set that my boyfriend got from my mom for Christmas. We went back inside, and my dad and I did not know what to do. But we said we need to do something. Do we do it now, or do we confront them later? We decided to do it now. We went up, and it was awful to see them doing what they did‚Ä¶. My mom and my boyfriend, whom I was so in love with‚Ä¶. Writing this story, I still can‚Äôt believe it. We confronted them, and they just kept going, and they really did not care. They said they were caught anyway, why would they stop? They kept aggressively moaning and stealing the show. It was awful. That same night, I packed his stuff, and so did my dad. It was devastating to see him like that. I told my dad that he and my sister could stay with us for the time being. The next morning, we waited downstairs for them. We told my sister, who is just 18 years old, what had happened and what was going to happen. She was scared and in tears about the situation. My ex-parents-in-law came downstairs, and shortly after that, my mom and ex-boyfriend followed. Their stuff was in the hallway, and I gave him the keys to our car so he could take them. I said it in front of his parents, and they were shocked. But, like I thought, he could not care less. He and my mom told us that they were so passionately in love and had the best sex ever, and they wanted to get married and have children. Hearing that was the last straw, and I just completely broke down and screamed that they had to leave. My ex-parents-in-law didn‚Äôt know what to say because it did not feel real. We talked for a little bit and decided they had to stand with their son because, like they said, it was the best thing to do. They went, and my father, sister, and I stayed in my home, just processing it all. My dad then got the divorce papers two weeks later, signed them, and sent them on their way to the court. It got settled really quickly.

Then we did not hear much from them over the last few months, but just one week ago, we received an invitation to their WEDDING!!! Yes, their wedding. I can‚Äôt believe they‚Äôre pulling this through‚Ä¶.

1gzrbw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1gzrbw7/why_do_women_like_men_who_get_to_the_point/,Why do women like men who get to the point?,"This post might not be ''politically'' correct, but I just want an honest perspective from women. I've been quite successful with with beautiful women in my life and if I can pinpoint something that really helped me get with you beautiful gals was getting to the point.

When I was younger and not so successful in my late teens and early 20s I would spend an entire day with a girl, walking around, doing activities, going to cafes/bars etc... Sometimes it would be an entire day and sometimes like 5 hours or so. There would always be kissing/romance, flirting and what not. But I didn't get the second dates I wanted or have any bedroom fun.

Then I moved in with this guy let's call him ''Alex'', and he was pretty cool dude. Alex was always bringing girls back all the time and things got quite noisy. One day I asked Alex what he did different than me and we compared our dates. It turns out that a first date with him was just him meeting the girl nearby his apartment and walking to the nearest supermarket and picking up some coffee or water or wine or whatever and bringing the girl back to our place.

Seriously, no bars/cafes/activities nothing. That's why I mentioned this post maybe not being politically correct. Sometimes he would even skip going to the supermarket and just walk straight back to ours.

At the apartment he would play music or sing or do some type of indoor activity. This part is important, having something cool to do at home.

So I decided to give it a try. And surprise, surprise. All of a sudden I was having bedroom fun, getting girls wanting to be my girlfriend, getting a lot of second dates.

I felt like I skipped so many steps. There really wasn't much ''getting to know each other'', and more about just joking, having fun and me being more ''ballsy'' with going for it.

It really went against everything that I was taught as a kid. I was always taught to take my time with women, be patient, give a lot of space. And I was doing that with every girl I met and was really not doing well at all.

I can't stress just HOW LITTLE SUCCESS I had with being more passive and laid back.

I changed this one thing and all of a sudden there was like a new world opened up.

Nowadays when I go on dates I do something a little in-between, hang out at a bar for an hour and a half or something like that before I invite the girl back. But I will never forget just how much more success both short term and long term I had. I really can't even describe how many potential relationships and real relationships I got later on just from getting to the point.

1gzrak2,https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1gzrak2/metallic_glasses_status_and_prospects_for/,"""Metallic Glasses: Status and Prospects for Aerospace Applications"" (AAWSAP DIRD) Analysis","[This DIRD](https://documents2.theblackvault.com/documents/dia/AAWSAP-DIRDs/DIRD_01_Metallic_Glasses_for_Aerospace_Applications.pdf) is rather dry, but upon a second look it's interesting for a few reasons. It's talking about a relatively new kind of metal (first publicly discovered in the 50's by German scientists) that are not crystalline. This allows them to be manufactured like thermoplastics and also allows for the creation of metal foams with incredible strength to weight ratios, increased insulation, increased deformation resistance, shape retention, etc. This new class of material is literally pioneered by trial-and-error mixing of metals, which means the ability to run complex computations for predictive analysis could cause an explosion in new advanced materials science.

In this 2017 article titled, ""[Metallic glass, the next disruptive material for Future Space and Military applications, coming of Age](https://idstch.com/technology/materials/metallic-glass-a-promising-future-spacecraft-and-military-material-coming-of-age/)"" it details the most recent advances pushing this new material to potentially displace stainless steel and traditional alloys.

In this 2004 article titled, ""[Glassy Metals May Be Materials of the Future](https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/glassy-metals-may-be-materials-of-the-future)"" the author explains how the amazing properties of this metal remind him of old UFO lore.

>The wispy metal strip in my hands is 8 inches long, 1 inch wide, and as thin as aluminum foil.

>‚ÄúTry to tear it,‚Äù says William Johnson, a materials science professor at Caltech in Pasadena.

>I pull‚Äîfirst gently, but soon with all my might. No go.

>‚ÄúSee if you can cut this,‚Äù suggests Johnson‚Äôs postgraduate assistant Jason Kang, handing me a mirror-bright piece of the same metal. It‚Äôs an inch long, a quarter inch wide, and thinner than a dime. I bear down with a heavy-duty pair of wire cutters. The metal will not cut. I try again, squeezing with both hands until my fingers ache. Nothing.

>But the most amazing act in this show is yet to come.

>‚ÄúWatch,‚Äù says Johnson. From a height of about two feet, he drops a steel ball onto a brick-size chunk of the metal. The ball bounces so high and for so long‚Äî1 minute and 17 seconds, with a metronomic tick, tick, tick‚Äîthat it looks unreal, like some kind of cinematic special effect. ‚ÄúWhen you try that with regular steel, it goes ‚Äòclunk, clunk, clunk‚Äô and stops,‚Äù says Johnson. If the metal were glued to an unyielding surface such as concrete (instead of sitting on Johnson‚Äôs oak coffee table, which absorbs a lot of the energy), ‚Äúthe ball would bounce for more than two minutes,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done it.‚Äù

>It‚Äôs all astounding, yet oddly familiar. In the typical science fiction film circa 1950, there‚Äôs that scene in which scientists return from the just-landed flying saucer and tell the Army brass that no tool known to humankind can cut, burn, bend, or otherwise scar the hull. But the metal in front of me is decidedly terrestrial in origin‚Äîit was developed in Pasadena, specifically in the lab down the hall from Johnson‚Äôs office.

>It is called metallic glass, or amorphous metal, and it appears to be nothing less than an entirely new class of material that can be used to build lighter, stronger versions of anything. ‚ÄúEverything from an Abrams tank to an F-16 jet to a bicycle can be made out of this, and because it is two to three times the strength of conventional alloys, you can halve the weight or more. That‚Äôs not evolutionary, it‚Äôs revolutionary,‚Äù says Johnson. ‚ÄúThis is the structural material of the future.‚Äù

Reducing weight by more than half while maintaining or even increasing strength is something can change how we try to analyze UFO events. For example, when determining assumptions to try to calculate the energy requirements this will drastically reduce the value of the conclusion such as in the Nimitz event. It should also change the way we analyze heating due to frictional forces. Foams are known to create amazing insulative properties when made out of materials with high melting points.

I'd also like to point out that I've been a bit obsessed with the [vacuum balloon concept](https://medium.com/predict/vacuum-balloon-technology-may-be-closer-than-you-think-26a9f0fc47b4?sk=b9855057a7bf48c25ff4a070e5385d05) for years and it is now apparent that metallic glass foams are prime candidates for actual practical vacuum balloon designs and not just prototype demonstrations using polymers and/or glass foams.

Is metallic glass reverse engineered technology? I don't personally think so at this point, but it's conceivable if a real UFO was retrieved and it used this technology, it could eventually be reverse engineered and maybe skip some time intensive trial and error research or massive investments in computational power. It's a provocative idea for sure. Reverse engineered NHI technology or not, it's fascinating technology that we do understand and it's hard to ignore the idea that if there are more advanced than us NHI crafts out there that they would be using this kind of technology in place of traditional metals.",6,1732562546.0,UFOs,2,0.88,False

1gzr8yu,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragranceclones/comments/1gzr8yu/in_the_search_of_a_signature_scents/,In the search of a signature scent(s),"Hi,  
  
I started on a journey to find the signature scent and never knew a topic I would love so much that spend hours each week watching various reviews and making detailed notes. The journey so far is exciting.

**Background**:  
Exactly 1 year back, around black Friday, I started my quest. Until that time, I used to use: Jacques Bogart Silver scent(which I still love to this day), David off Cool water, Ck one, Ferrari Black. These were my go-to scents, I used to replace a bottle every time it was about to get over. When I used to go to the airport, I would try various perfumes, I didn't even know names of niche and designer brands, I was so naive. So for instance, Until a year ago, I never visited Creed or Tom Ford booths at the duty free. I used to visit CK, JPG, Boss, Paco Rabanne mostly.  

Then one day it got me thinking, what if I could get these quality perfumes, which I see at the airport, for cheaper, as in at some 50-75% discounts, wouldn't that be cool. I made an entry in my to-do list to check once back.

**Come Zara**:  
I came across a post that Zara sells dupes and clones of almost all top perfumes. I had a Zara near my house, so I researched for all the Zara perfumes for men, watched countless videos, and made a list of products to buy. I went ahead and bought: Zara Oud Vibrant edition, Zara Silver and Zara Gold. When I sniffed these at the Zara showroom, I loved all 3, and bought them quickly. Never knew longevity and projection was weak for all 3.

**Meet Lattafa - new budget king**:  
I started wearing all 3, and I loved Zara silver, the juice was refreshing tbh. However, I soon discovered that longevity is pathetic at least on my skin and clothes. May be I was going nose blind, or so I thought. I continued like this, and 1 day out of frustration, starting searching if I was the only one who had this experience. I found many users complaining about these and 1 post said that you could have bought Lattafa in response to a complaint. Until then I had never heard about Lattafa, Afnan, Armaf, Ajmal, I would have brushed them off as cheapies. After all, Zara was an established brand, and these were unheard of, or I was living under the cave lol. I again started my deep research, and decided to buy Lattafa Asad and Ramz Silver. I wanted to buy Afnan 9 pm instead of Ramz Silver, but having lost money in Zara, I thought to tread cautiously. Afnan was 2.5x times the price of Ramz Silver back then, thought it's better to lose a bit less in case both turn out like Zara.  
  
I got both Asad and Ramz Silver within 4-5 days (online) and used Asad the 1st day, and boy oh boy, I was blown away, by the fragrance, even in longevity and projection section it was quite good as compared to Zara. I wore Asad for 1 week, everyday, and then remember I have Ramz Silver too. The day I sprayed it, I was blown away, I never expected a thing from Ramz Silver, but I found it awesome. The opening was a bit harsh, but after 30 min, it was just wow, also IMHO it projected better and stayed much longer with me (on my skin and clothes). 

**More Clones (Badee, Velvet Oud, Qaeed, Najdia)**:  
Having tested the blood, now I was daily searching for more perfumes. I didn't want to take a big risk, with another brand, so I researched all Latafa perfumes and decided to buy: Badee al oud amethyst, Velvet Oud. To be honest, didn't like both. Velvet oud was way to skanky for my liking. Badee was alright, but not worth the hype.  Ordered Qa'eed, Najdia next, and they were alright. I liked Najdia, but longevity for me wasn't more than 20 minute. I quickly left them in the cabinet. Then, I came across Frank Olivier Oud Touch on Amazon, and pressed the buy button quickly. It was quite cheap and heard it's a clone of Dior Ispahan, a 250$ perfume. I loved it, doesn't feel feminine despite having rose in it. I wear it at night many times.

**Enter CDNIM**:  
I was reading this forum, and CDNIM kept popping up. I was like: WTH is CDNIM. Google was my friend and got to know about CDNIM. Quickly bought one, and was delivered in 3 days. Was totally blown away by the quality, I was back in the business and trust in clones was restored. I still love CDNIM a lot, it has gotten better with time over last few months. Success of CDNIM blind buy suggested that I should treat other ME brands as well apart from Lattafa.

**Re-enter Velvet Oud**:  
I read a post on Reddit that you should macerate all ME fragrances and they become better.  (Reddit has been a true friend, and I love this community). I bought Velvet Oud in the summer time, so it sat in the wooden cabinet for 6 months or even more. Now, when I use it, it's one of the best perfumes in my collection. It's smells sooo nice, stays forever with me, and gets compliments. Who would have thought lol. Even Qa'eed has become better, even though it requires like 15 sprays.

**Recent Buys**:  
Rochas Moustache and Detour Noir. Fragrance wise both are excellent and both are cheapies. Will have to test thoroughly to check longevity. They were delivered today, so can't comment on longevity. Will have to circle back. So far loving both. I wanted to buy MA Tux instead of Rochas, but Tux/Winsome were tough to come by. Heard Rochas was quite hyped before, but now there are many clones of Tuxedo and hence it is available for cheap.

**Decants**:  
All my buys were blind buys as it's difficult to sample ME perfumes, where I live. Recently I ordered 1 ml decants of:  
Mancera Red Tobacco  
Mancera Instant Crush  
Mancera Cedrat Bois  
Mancera Black Gold:  
Montale Arabians Tonka  
Maison Margiela REPLICA Jazz Club  
I have thus far tried, Red Tobacco, Instant Crush and Replica Jazz Club, all are good, but didn't last long 1ml sprays were quite low in quantity. Also I thought decanter sent 0.5 ml instead of 1. So need to try these in a mall.  I have heard many good things about Mancera and Montale perfumes especially in Projection and Longevity department, and one of the scents can be my signature scent in future. So far I am comfortable only spending equivalent of 100-120$ on a 100ml bottle, so Montale and Mancera fit the bill. I know brands like JPG, Boss, and Spicebomb extreme can be great at this price, but I am still researching.

  
**Journey ahead**:  
I am yet to discover what to I like, fresh, spicy, woody or something else. I am intrigued by sweet tobacco scents.  
I researched, all top brands and tried to find out a close clone for each one of them. If I love the clone, I might get the Original too.

Some of the clones on my list to buy in next 1 year:

\- Armaf Hunter Killer / Paris corner Wild and Tobacco (Mancera Red Tobacco)

\- Lataffa ameer al oud (Replica's By the Fireplace by Maison Margila)

1gzr7wg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gzr7wg/update_aitah_for_being_disgusted_and_just_saying/,UPDATE AITAH for being disgusted and just saying OK when my Fianc√© broke up with me? ,"To start, Alex moved out pretty quickly after the breakup. He has been staying with a friend, and we sorted out everything like mail, subscriptions, and the lease.

I‚Äôm also in the process of adopting a cat. Her name is Luna, but I have been thinking about changing it since my family already has two pets named Luna, a Moon, and Qamar. She is still at her foster home for now, but I have visited her a few times, and I already adore her. She is a scrappy little tabby who follows her foster mom around like a shadow, and I can‚Äôt wait for her to move in during the first week of December. I‚Äôve already gotten her bowls, toys, and a bed by the window ready.

Now onto what happened. Last week, I was out showing someone around the city. He is the son of my parents‚Äô friends who recently moved here for work. My parents asked me to help him get familiar with the area, so I agreed. It was nothing special, just walking around, grabbing coffee, and pointing out useful spots in the city.

Apparently, Alex saw us.

I didn‚Äôt even realize he was there, but later that night, I started getting texts from an unknown number. I guess he got a new number since I blocked his old one. The texts were just weird. He accused me of flaunting my ‚Äúnew relationship‚Äù in public, said I must have been seeing this guy before we broke up, and told me that everything he suspected about me was true.

I didn‚Äôt respond. I wasn‚Äôt going to entertain his paranoia. The messages kept coming though. They went from angry to desperate, with him saying things like, ‚ÄúAt least admit you were lying to me,‚Äù and, ‚ÄúWas anything about us even real?‚Äù It was exhausting and honestly a little scary to see how quickly he spiraled.

For the record, this guy isn‚Äôt my boyfriend. He‚Äôs not even someone I‚Äôm interested in. He‚Äôs just the son of family friends who needed help settling into the city. The whole thing was completely innocent, but Alex has twisted it into some kind of betrayal in his head.

What gets me is how little Alex seems to know me. I‚Äôm not the type of person to jump into a relationship so soon after everything that happened. Even if I were, it wouldn‚Äôt be any of his business. We are done. I‚Äôve made that clear.

After I didn‚Äôt respond to his texts, Alex started calling. I didn‚Äôt pick up, but the voicemails were a mix of angry rants and desperate pleas. I ended up blocking his new number too. It feels ridiculous that I have to keep doing this, but I guess this is where we are now.

Then this weekend, I went out to a bar with my friends. A few hours in, guess who walked in? Alex.

I don‚Äôt know if it was a coincidence or if he followed me there, but as soon as he spotted me, he came straight over. He was clearly upset, asking to talk, and I told him no. My friends stepped in, and thankfully, he left without causing a scene, but it ruined my night. It felt like I couldn‚Äôt escape him, no matter where I went or what I did.

When I got home later that night, I was completely drained. I had just started to relax when I heard a knock on my door. It was Alex, standing there in tears.

He started crying, saying he missed me, that he didn‚Äôt understand why I was ‚Äúdoing this to him,‚Äù and that he didn‚Äôt know how to move on. It was like all the anger from earlier had been replaced with this desperate sadness. I didn‚Äôt let him in. I told him he needed to leave, and if he didn‚Äôt, I would call someone to make him leave. He begged me to listen, but I just closed the door.

I spent the rest of the night feeling shaken and honestly a little scared. I don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs going through. I wrote his best friend about the situation but the plea of talking to him. He said he would. 

I‚Äôm seriously considering getting a new phone number and possibly even talking to someone about how to handle this legally if it keeps happening. It feels unfair that I have to go to these lengths just to have some peace, but I don‚Äôt see another option.

Most of my nights are with a coworker named Linda (fake name for here) and she's been so nice to me and has taught me most of the tasks needed for closing and she is very friendly. She even drives me home after as we're neighbors (didn't know of her before working there ). 

She's in charge of closing the sandwich/pie post of the shop which includes cleaning the toasters/oven and removing the food to throw away or store .

Meanwhile as a barista im In charge of cleaning the coffee machine after closing , the blenders for smoothies , the mixers for iced coffee , the sugar jars which always leave a mess on the counter , the orange juice machine and cleaning the creams and spoons etc. all this while also removing the tables and chairs from outside .  In the outside section Linda has always helped me and even done it herself as I had customers to do or was running behind while being new .

Tonight she was kinda passive aggressive but in a polite way if that makes sense ?
She waited for me only to do the outside cuz she said it's expected of me cuz I'm a man .
It's important to add here that I'm built like a scarecrow and she's tall and has visibly more muscle than me and we're about the same age (she's like 6 years olders ) 
 
I don't complain and go do the outside. I come in where I make 3 coffees for customers and resume my other closing tasks . I finish everything and cleaning cream is the only thing left and it's a bit messy as it's sticky and makes the sink a mess so with a spoon I take the cream out in the trash and leave the tube for cleaning in the sink . She commented that I'm too slow. And her mood changed to more serious and didn't talk much (she talks a lot).

Might I add that I also throw all the trash which are a lot and the trash cans are like one minute away from the shop .

In the drive home she didn't talk much even as I tried to make small talk . She then mentioned that she don't understand why were a half hour late .

The shop closes at 8 pm and we were out by 8:25 pm 

In my head 25 minutes seems normal no????? For closing a normal to smaller sized shop.


She goes on to say that she finishes the closing with other people in even 7-15 minutes . Mind you these other people have like 20 years of experience. She herself has 7 years of experience and I have only 1 month and I've only done like 2 weeks or less of closing.

I try my best ALWAYS at this job as it's my first job ever and I'm gonna be only working for a year or so till I get my degree and look a job in that field. But even so I still try my best at this barista job ",1,1732562072.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

¬†

This is my story as a 28-year-old man who for most of his life has struggled with mental health and its physical symptoms, and how I eventually learned tools to combat the challenges to the degree that now I live a happy, content and fulfilling life. I wanted to tell my story so that it could give hope for others who struggle with similar problems.

¬†

I am not a licensed doctor, therapist nor do I have any formal education or affiliation with any of the psychological branches and methods I am describing. I do not claim at any point that what works for me works for someone else. However, I do strongly believe that most of the things I describe are universal and many of them have enough scientific evidence for them to work for most of the people.

¬†

I try to be as brief and simple as possible since I have come to believe in the aforementioned quote the more I grow older. To illustrate my examples, I will use metaphorical examples that come from my personal interests, mostly in gaming and films.

¬†

So, let‚Äôs go.

¬†

**1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Trauma is NOT what has happened to you, it is HOW your mind and body react to it.**

¬†

In everyday language we tend to think that trauma is something extremely severe that does not happen to most of the people. We talk about traumatizing experiences and happenings as if they were the original cause of it. While the concept of trauma differs regarding which branch of psychology is talking about it, I am a proponent of the understanding that trauma is something surprisingly mundane and common for everyone of us.

¬†

Trauma is also possible to heal, regardless of its original cause, precisely because it is not what has happened to you, but how your mind and body react.

¬†

I have background in linguistic studies, and one of the falsest statements people say all the time is that ‚Äòwords are just words‚Äô. Words are never just words, words create our realities. When we say that we, someone or something are something, it activates specific areas in the brain and forms the way we see the world and what we call ‚Äòreality‚Äô. Just like people do not necessarily see colors in the same way as others, the same applies for everything else. This is why it is so important to consciously challenge the way how language makes us unconsciously limit the world around us.

¬†

I, like everyone else, have had traumatic experiences in my life. For years I tried to understand and analyze them intellectually, which only helped me halfway. The rest of the process, and in my opinion where the proper healing process begins, is when you will realize that the experiences you have had do not define you as what you are now or what you can be in the future.

¬†

This is the reason I am not going through my traumatic experiences. Not because I could not talk about them, but I see no reason to, since they do not define me anymore unless I allow them to. Often people do the mistake by inadvertently reliving traumatic experiences, analyzing their over-generational traumas and trying to understand them intellectually, which is helpful up until the person understands how the trauma inside them has formed, but after that this kind of ruminating and analyzing often only does disservice and actively prevents the healing process.

¬†

There is a lot of scientific evidence on how even the most severe traumas can be healed, and with severe I am talking about serious physical and mental abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder that is triggered by war experiences, for example. The methods used for this process are often surprisingly simple. TRE (Tension, Stress and Trauma Release Therapy) and other forms of somatic psychotherapy, as well as EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) have been shown to work for people with severe traumatic experiences.

¬†

Which leads us to the next point‚Ä¶

¬†

**2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mind and body are NOT separate entities, they are inseparable from each other.**

¬†

One of the biggest lies in the whole Western world ‚Äì and possibly in other cultures as well ‚Äì is the idea that mind and body are separate entities. They are not. Even though many of us nowadays understand at least to some degree how, for instance, mental problems create physical symptoms, we still use different words from them. I think we should not; however, I have not come up with proper single term yet, neither in English nor my native language. Maybe in the future, but for now I will come up with an extremely stupid word ‚Äòmind-body‚Äô.

¬†

What this means is that we should put much more emphasis on how to treat our body, not just our mind. In the modern society a lot of our basic needs are fulfilled quite easily: we buy our groceries from the shop, we drive to the workplace, etc; and for this reason we have to come up with solutions how to artificially simulate situations that satisfy our evolutionary needs.

¬†

Keeping your mind-body in good shape does NOT mean that you should become a professional athlete. You don‚Äôt need to go to the gym nor exercise as long as you taste the blood in your mouth. Just go out for a walk. Seriously. Walking is one of the greatest healing moments you can give your mind-body. Humans were created to walk a kilometer after kilometer in search for food and shelter, and we should pay enough attention to these instincts. The best exercise is when you do something. Just something is enough.

¬†

The therapy methods I described in the previous point are all based first and foremost on the bodily experiences. They aim to release the tension trauma locks inside your mind-body, rather than making you to intellectually understand it. This is not to say, however, that understanding your traumas and problems intellectually is a bad thing, quite on the contrary. So that it becomes absolutely clear, I want to emphasize that I am not dismissing the importance of other psychotherapy forms. They are extremely helpful in many cases, and not everything can be solved solely by somatic methods. You can‚Äôt just shake your narcissism out of your mind-body without a commitment to healing and psychotherapeutic methods, but for a lot of the challenges that modern people face, I believe that somatic exercises and methods are extremely helpful.

¬†

Some of these methods that I have found useful include TRE exercises, physiological sigh and voo sound, aside from taking long walks and going to the gym.

¬†

**3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† You are not lazy, you just channel your energy in the wrong direction.**

¬†

COVID pandemic was a generational traumatic experience that affected everybody regardless of where they lived or what their social or economical status was. It affected me as well. I felt triggered easily, anxious all the time and not finding joy from the things I used to find before.

¬†

After the worst lockdowns I went to the theaters to watch a Japanese animated film *Lonely Castle in the Mirror*. It is about a depressed and anxious teenage girl who has dropped out of school. Her mother tries to help her and gets her to a special weekend school meant for socially isolated youngsters. However, even this becomes too difficult for her and she isolates herself in her room and through her mirror enters a fantasy world into a castle where she meets other youngsters in a similar situation than her.

¬†

This film was very touching for me in the way it depicted mental health and the inner struggles depressed and anxious people have. The most touching scene for me was about a teacher who tries her best to help the girl and even comes to her home to meet her, trying to persuade her to continue coming to school. The girl is so ashamed of her struggles that it is difficult for her to express herself, and then the teacher says:

¬†

*‚ÄúI understand that you are not lazy. You just struggle so much inside.‚Äù*

¬†

People who struggle with their mental health are not lazy. Actually the opposite. They struggle, combat, and battle every single day so much that most of their energy is directed inwards and reinforce negative behavioral models, and for this reason they have no energy for what ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô people consider easy and mundane tasks.

¬†

The first law of thermodynamics states that it is not possible to create or destroy energy, only to transform it, and yet people so often try to destroy the energy inside them. It is ridiculous even to try. What we should do is to try to transform this same energy into something we label as ‚Äòpositive‚Äô, whether we transform it into kinetic energy, creating art or helping others.

¬†

Unfortunately, it is not always so easy as being said.

¬†

**4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Even though you KNOW what to do, it matters nothing unless you FEEL you can.**

¬†

A lonely person knows they should get outside and meet people so they could have friends. An overweight person knows they should exercise more and eat less and more healthy. An alcoholic knows how bad alcohol is for them. And yet they relapse over and over again. And an important reason why this happens is because even though they know what to do, they don‚Äôt feel it.

¬†

In my first point I talked about traumas, and how wallowing in them often leads to reinforcing them. This is related to the point I‚Äôm making right now, that is that unless you feel you can improve or heal, nothing matters. We commit the same mistakes over and over again, fall into the trap of over-generational traumas, since we unwillingly strengthen these impulses, and in the core of this is our own beliefs about what is improvement and how we can do it.

¬†

This is exactly the reason why most people react to self help so negatively, since they state the obvious truths but never tell you how to reach them. This is because you either have a preconceited understanding of how (you feel) things are, or your mind-body is in such a heightened sense of overstimulation that you cannot reason your way out of the situation. What you need to be able to do first is to solve these two issues, and only then use your ‚Äòreason‚Äô and ‚Äòintelligence‚Äô. (I put them in quotes trying to express sarcasm on how people rely onto them‚Ä¶)

¬†

Also, our brains are not wired to understand negation, or lack of something. If I tell you not to think of a pink elephant, you will think of a pink elephant. The only way for you to not to think of a pink elephant is to think something else; to do something actively, not trying to not to do something. This is why trying to avoid something often ironically leads to reinforcing the existence of the things you are trying to get rid of.

¬†

All of this process starts with acceptance. Acceptance simply means ‚Äòletting it be what is‚Äô. All of the labels we give for things and people are creations of ourselves and people around us, and they are true to us only if let them to be. How we can physically cultivate our mind-body into this is by techniques like meditation and grounding. Meditation works as a practice in a similar way as going to the gym, but the problem is it does not work when you are agitated enough. In those situations you should be able to calm the areas in your mind-body that put you into evolutionarily triggered fight or flight response situation. Some good ways for doing this in my personal experience are physiological sigh or tapping.

¬†

Acceptance does NOT mean you just passively give up in front of bad circumstances. On the contrary, acceptance releases the built-up energy inside you so you could channel it into changing things. The reason people don‚Äôt have energy to change things they feel are bad or unfair to them, is often that they waste so much energy in the process of not being able to accept things. Paradoxically only when you accept, you can at least try to improve things.

¬†

If you want a cautious example of how trauma works at a both micro and macro level, you should watch *The Godfather* trilogy, which in my opinion is the greatest depiction of trauma I have ever seen in art. It is such a great depiction that most of the viewers don‚Äôt even recognize it being a depiction of trauma at all, which speaks for itself.

¬†

And after you‚Äôve watched all of *The Godfather* films, watch *Megalopolis*, a film that the writer-director Francis Ford Coppola made decades later by self-financing his vision since no studio would finance it. It deals with many of the same themes but instead offers an optimistic, utopian future on how to improve and break out of the cycle.

¬†

And there is a way for that.

¬†

**5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Wu wei ‚Äì go with the flow and let things happen.**

¬†

Over 2,000 years ago in ancient China loose philosophical ideas emerged as what is nowadays called Taoism. The core idea of Taoism is that a force called Tao is everything that is ‚Äònatural‚Äô in the universe and that humans should not interfere with it. Tao is often translated and explained in English as ‚Äòthe way of things‚Äô, natural order of things or something like that. Taoists believed that suffering of humans is rooted in the friction that happens when humans actively decide to work against Tao. Taoists believed that humans should act according to Tao, and this action ‚Äì or non-action ‚Äì was called *wu wei*, which often translates into English as ‚Äòeffortless action‚Äô or ‚Äòaction through inaction‚Äô.

¬†

In the 1970s a Hungarian-American psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi coined the term ‚Äòflow‚Äô that closely resembles what Taoists call wu wei. The difference was that Csikszentmihalyi didn‚Äôt want to call mundane tasks such as brushing teeth or driving car as flow, since he thought flow was something active and limit-breaking, something like creating art or competing in sports.

¬†

I do not consider myself as a Taoist, nor do I really like talking about what I feel as mundane things in such a mystic tone, but I do like to use the term wu wei, because it captures the essential philosophy I believe in.

¬†

In our early childhood we act according to our wu wei. We do not overanalyze nor think of the future, we just are. And then something happens. We mimic the fears and limitations of our caretakers unconsciously, and give up our wu wei to get acceptance from them, therefore suffocating the connection to wu wei and authenticity of our true self. In the meantime, we learn a lot of useful intellectual tools that are absolutely necessary for us, but we sacrifice a part of our identity in the process. This detachment is called dissonance in psychology, and it is a cause of great deal of mental health issues and chronic pain we feel trapped in our limited sense of mind-bodies.

¬†

The good part is that this connection is always to be found again. We just need to remind ourselves of its existence and listen to what our mind-body TRULY says.

¬†

What wu wei is NOT, that people often confuse it with, it is not immorality, laziness or an excuse to just chill out and show middle finger to the society‚Äôs demands. Our true essence is not just to lie depressed in the cave, we are made to thrive for improvement, to actively search, seek, experience and experiment, and the most important of everything, to help others. When you truly commit to your wu wei, you will do what you need to do. Animals need to hunt their food, otherwise they will die. Trust me, for most of us life is not that difficult.

¬†

**6.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Maybe God does not play dice, but you should give it a try.**

¬†

Aside from films, I find an immense amount of joy in playing board and card games. The game I play the most is backgammon, a board game for two people that involves a great deal of tactical and strategic consideration but also an element of randomness. Unlike in chess or go, in backgammon you can lose a match even though you would play everything mathematically correct. However, the more you keep playing, the more you will eventually win since what we call ‚Äòluck‚Äô ‚Äì I really dislike the term as it implies it is something positive ‚Äì evens out according to the laws of probability.

¬†

Backgammon is called the cruelest game for a good reason. Even the tiniest mistake can cost you the whole match, and you can never rely on arrogant assumptions that you should win against a weaker opponent. It shows no mercy for what we call ‚Äòthe ego‚Äô. In backgammon you are playing against your opponent, but also yourself and the mechanics of the game.

¬†

Playing backgammon at a competitive level, against much better players than myself (and worse!), has without exaggeration made me a much better person. It has taught me humility, respect and calmness. There is an evolutionary reason why humans tend to play sports and games, because they teach us something very important: how to take everything that comes towards you, adapt into it and act accordingly, while simultaneously pertaining your inner desire to improve.

¬†

In backgammon, or in any other game I play, I‚Äôm not afraid of losing anymore, but go into the game simply by wanting to have fun. Everything else is secondary and will come if it will.

¬†

**7.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† You can walk the horse by the river, but you can‚Äôt force it to drink.**

¬†

We all want to be liked by others, as that is one of the most fundamental evolutionary truths for us. We do this at any cost. We want others to understand us, to accept us and to see the world the same way we do.

¬†

However, a lot of this need comes from the detachment of one‚Äôs authenticity and wu wei, and we try to fill this void by forcing others to approve us. We take absurd ways trying to make others like us, and precisely because of that many won‚Äôt. And some won‚Äôt anyway, no matter what you do.

¬†

The reason you want someone to like something that is meaningful for you is because you care for it. There is no real connection to this unless you decide there is. And for your own health‚Äôs sake you should break this imaginary connection even though it hurts. And trust me, it definitely does. It has been shown in scientific studies that for instance a broken heart really activates the same areas in the brain as physical pain. This is once again evolutionary psychology that was created to keep us alive, because your herd abandoning you could lead into death.

¬†

Once again it comes down to acceptance. You need to be able to accept that not everybody likes you, that when someone hurts you emotionally it will really hurt you physically. This for me personally has been the most difficult of them all, because I like people. I try my best to be nice and gentle and helpful. I try to be nice also for them who are not nice for me. And still I, despite all of this growth, feel really hurt when people hurt me. And it is okay, and I know that accepting this is the only way to really get past it.

¬†

One of my all-time favorite films is Japanese film *Tokyo Story* from 1950s. It is about an elderly couple living in the countryside who decide to see their children and grandchildren who live in Tokyo and take a long trip to Tokyo for the first time in their lives. However, when they arrive at Tokyo, they realize that their children and grandchildren live in a very different society and don‚Äôt have time aside from working and building new Japan after World War II. In the end of the film there is a famous heartbreaking scene where the elder couple‚Äôs daughter-in-law smiles almost straight to the camera, tears rolling down her face and says, ‚Äòlife is disappointing, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äô

¬†

*Tokyo Story* shows how much it can hurt when people you want to like don‚Äôt show you the same emotions back. Yet it is still a very beautiful, optimistic film about everyday joys in life, and eventually shows that people can find beauty and fulfillment amongst any experiences.

¬†

**8.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† When everything else fails, just stop giving a fuck.**

¬†

For a long time, I suffered from insomnia. I solved it by starting to drink coffee in the evenings. My eventual reasoning was that if I couldn‚Äôt sleep anyways, at least I want to make myself a little bit better during the night by having a good cup of coffee. Eventually my insomnia was relieved by itself.

¬†

I believe all of us have experience of this. We put an immense amount of effort into something just to find out it doesn‚Äôt work after all. At some point eventually we will just say ‚Äòfuck it‚Äô and move on to something else, and the problem subsides ‚Äì and often is solved by itself.

¬†

Problem-solving is once again an evolutionary important trait in humankind. We love problem-solving so much that we create our own problems if our surroundings do not give us enough stimuli. What we need to learn is to characterize real problems from imaginary ones.

¬†

Our brains cannot understand the world if we do not come up with categories, generalizations, heuristics and rules. But a great deal of our suffering comes from the false sense of hope that adhering to strict rules gives us on a short-term but not long-term basis. Because the nature, the world, the universe, does not follow what our brains call ‚Äòrules‚Äô. Things just are. So, whenever you feel that you are too stuck in your own journey of spiritual awakening and self-transforming or whatever, just remember that it should not mean a fuck unless you are enjoying it. If you are not, just stop doing it.

¬†

Be creative. Do not listen to anyone (definitely not me!) who says something that your wu wei does not approve. Do not give a fuck.

¬†

Now, after reading this fucking long essay that I promised would be brief and simple, go with your wu wei and take a good, long walk. And please watch some of the films I mentioned.

¬†

Thank you for reading this. I hope it has given you some tools for you to deal with your inner struggles, hope that change is possible and understanding that we ourselves create most of our problems, and that it is possible to recover from them and live a good, content and mostly happy life.

*Ody Vasilias*

I wake up, looking at my ceiling, as I question my career choice. Being a judge is too much, especially when your husband is a defence attorney. Looking at him,¬† when he sleeps, I heave a big sigh. I brush his frizzy black hair out of his face, planting a kiss on his cheek as I pull the thick blue comforter off of me. I look back at Polites, drool running down his olive coloured face, flushed with sleep. As I pull on my black dress shirt and slacks, I go through my work email.

I‚Äôll let Polites sleep. He just got a tough case. A 34 year old, single father of two allegedly robbed a grocery store, no casualties, but a few people injured. 1 count robbery, 2 counts assault. Going through the case of Polly Phemus, I sit at the kitchen table of our too-big house. A soft hand lands on my shoulder, sleepily, Polites kissing my head, ‚ÄúMorning Ody,‚Äù He sets a cup of black coffee in front of me, sitting beside me in his navy suit. Tomorrow is the day of Polly Phemus‚Äô trial. ‚ÄúMorning Pooh Bear,‚Äù I respond, a soft smile making its way onto my lips. Pooh bear, a pet name he picked up, by being so soft and sweet. And his killer bear hugs.

""Please don't go too hard on him, Ody,"" he asks me, sadness heavy in his green eyes, registering that I'm looking over the case, methodically fiddling with the paper.

""Polites. I will give him what he needs. I know you're a good lawyer, one of the best, but if he is guilty, I don't care if you're my husband. I will make sure he gets what he deserves, whether that be good or bad."" This tears me apart. I hate disagreeing with Polites, but I want to bring justice to people.

""Please Ody. He has children. He was just trying to feed them. Most people don't have jobs that pay you more money than you know what to do with.""¬†¬†

""We'll just have to see,""¬†

""Sorry if I put you in a bad position, love. But he needs this. He‚Äôs a good man Babe, despite his charges"" He says, picking up his briefcase and keys, heading to his car, ‚ÄúI have to meet with Mr. Phemus. Sort some things out. Innocent until proven, Ody,‚Äù¬† He looks at me, and I can tell he‚Äôs mad, but trying to hide it.¬†

We‚Äôve been friends since we were young boys, and I could read Polites better than anyone. He‚Äôs my Pooh Bear.¬† I tried to tell him he was too soft for that job, but he countered that his softness is what made him good at it. I can‚Äôt lie. He is a good lawyer, just too nice. Too trusting.

I down my coffee, and put the empty mug in the sink. Grabbing my long black tailcoat, and my satchel, I head out the door, into my car. Driving to the court house I think a lot about what Polites said. He just wants the best. The best for Polly Phemus, and the best for Polly Phemus' children.¬†

I pull into the parking lot, respectably early, heading into the court house. Checking into the front desk, I look around, at all the people. Some lawyers, some criminals, some just people who couldn't afford their parking ticket.¬† Some deserve gentleness more than others. I walk into the second courtroom, and start with minor cases, a bunch of them. Parking ticket this, petty theft there, vandalism, the list goes on, my nerves building for tomorrow, as I finally get a lunch break.¬†

I find myself zoning out. Tomorrow. I will *not* let tomorrow be the first fight in our happy marriage, especially not over a case. Not *this* case, not any case.

Slowly, I start to eat the lunch Polites dropped off for me, thinking. The people who Phemus assaulted will want justice. Phemus‚Äô children want a father. Polites want the children to have a father. I want Polites to be happy. So many hard choices, none of which I feel like making.

Throwing my wrapper in the garbage, I get up and start pacing, trying to get my gears to turn faster. Someone walks past, looking at me like I‚Äôm a psychopath, and I give them a small nod. Just your everyday judge almost having a mental breakdown, nothing much.

I do a few more cases, guilty, not guilty, guilty, not guilty, no contest, defence attorneys claiming the wildest things to ever be heard. I wonder if Polites is going to be like that tomorrow. ""No Judge Vasilias, Mr. Phemus was not in fact there when the robbery happened. Oh? It showed him on the cameras? I'm sure it was some sort of mistake! My client was at his house! Alibi? I object.""¬†

Luckily, I don't take my husband as some sort of idiot attorney. He's different. He got his degree at Harvard afterall.

Finally, after a jam packed work day, I park in the driveway next to Pooh's car, and unlock the front door. The delicious smell of burgers wafts through the air. The lights are turned off, small candles and rose petals leading me to our dining area, Pooh sitting on the other end, a candle between us. A red and white tablecloth is laid across the table, trying to make the dinner fancy. He's so sweet, mimicking our first date: A picnic blanket laid on the grassy hill, candles lit, rose petals... And greasy take out burgers. An inside joke.

He holds up a half empty glass of wine, and hands it to me, planting a kiss on my cheek, ""I love you Ody. Let‚Äôs have a nice night. No work talk, no case talk. Just us..‚Äù He says, murky green eyes looking at me with such love, shining in the moonlight. He nuzzles his face into the crook of my shoulder, putting down the wine glass. As I melt into his hug, I let all the stress and worry of my job melt away with it, breathing in Pooh.

After a while, we make our way to bed. I stroke his silky hair, my other arm wrapped around him protectively. My bare chest presses against him, as I slowly drift off, my hand resting on his face.

\*\*\*

    The annoying alarm sound ‚ÄúRadar‚Äù blares through my phone‚Äôs speakers, sun creeping in through the crack in the curtains. I roll over, and nudge Pooh awake. That man can sleep through anything, I swear. Zeus could slam his thunderbolt into this house, and Pooh would still be asleep.
    
    This morning, after getting my suit on, I put the coffee pod in the machine, and start making breakfast, my nerves still going strong. I have never been *this* nervous for a case. Although I don‚Äôt think the case is the thing I am worried about.¬†
    
    I‚Äôve only been a judge for a few months, so I've been getting pretty slow cases. This is my first big case as a judge. I *am* worried about the decision I‚Äôm going to make. Because this decision won‚Äôt *just* affect Phemus. It‚Äôll affect everyone close to the defendant too. Like Phemus‚Äô young children. How would they react? Hopefully it won‚Äôt affect my relationship with Polites.
    
    Last night, Polites buttered me up real well. He showed me a picture, with two brown haired children hugging Phemus, ‚ÄúThose are Provata and Pravato. Phemus‚Äô children. They sure look like they love their father.‚Äù
    
    I‚Äôm in a good mood. Everyone deserves a second chance. Even criminals.
    
    Pooh comes down the stairs, half stumbling, half walking, like he just crawled out of bed. Which he did. He straightens his rumpled dark grey suit, adjusting his light grey tie. His round glasses are basically falling off his face. He looks ready to win this case. No. Matter. What.

*Polites Isopedomenos*

    I lay my hands on Ody‚Äôs slim shoulders, as I come up behind him, my hands right where his dark brown hair comes to an end, ‚ÄúMorning Ody Boatie,‚Äù I say, like I do every morning, even though this mornings different. Mine and Ody‚Äôs biggest case is today. Of course they *had* to put him as my judge. I sigh loudly, as I look down at Ody‚Äôs phone as he scrolls through a news article about boats, and how a boat sank right off the coast of a Greek island. Seems to have been struck by lightning. I can barely read it over Ody‚Äôs freckled hooked nose. I sit down beside him, swinging my legs into his lap, my dress pants crinkling.
    
    He pours me a nice big glass of chocolate milk, (not to be confused with taco milk) and puts down an egg and cheese sandwich in front of me. As I scarf my food down, Ody stares blankly at the oak table. He cooks when he‚Äôs nervous, but doesn‚Äôt eat when he‚Äôs nervous. I eat when I‚Äôm nervous. The perfect couple.
    
    I remember in 7th grade, our first year of final exams. He lost over 5 pounds, he was so nervous. At least when I was there, he would try to eat.
    
    In my head, I go over every way I can think of to defend Mr. Phemus. Him having children gives me leverage to win this case, that's something I could use. If I‚Äôm lucky, I can get Mr. Phemus away with a few months of probation. I *will* make sure he gets away with probation. That is my job, afterall.¬†
    
    I stand up, my chair pushing out loudly, as my long legs try to make their way out from under the table. I drop my plate off in the dishwasher, as I toss Ody, a Lotus smoothie, his favourite, in case he gets hungry later, which I know he will.
    
    I grab my files from the counter, making sure all of my notes are there. This should be enough to win the case. I shove all the papers into my messy unorganised accordion folder, and bolt, the front door squealing on its hinges, ‚ÄúBYE ODYYYY.‚Äù He‚Äôs just now coming out the door, heading for his car.
    
    My phone connects to the bluetooth in my chrome blue truck, and my music blasts over the speakers, my windows rolling down. I sing along, ‚ÄúThis life is amazing when you greet it with open arms,whatever we face, we‚Äôll be fine if we‚Äôre leading from the heart‚Ä¶‚Äù I shout out the windows, enjoying myself. Once I get a block away from the court house, I roll up my tinted windows, and quiet the music. I‚Äôd rather not let this get out and affect my work. I pull into the courthouse parking lot next to a rickety old car.
    
    Stumbling out of my truck, I grab my briefcase folder. The door of the car next to me opens, and my client steps out. He runs a hand through his buzzed hair, towering over me. I see that he‚Äôs freshly shaven, and wearing a light brown suit, complimenting his olive skin, and almost black eyes. Judges always like a clean appearance. I know Ody does.	

""Hi, Mr. Isopedomenos. I'm here early like you told me to be,"" Phemus' voice wobbles, like he's scared. I don't blame him. I'm scared too, though that wouldn't really be the best thing to say to him.

""Let's go, Phemus. Just remember. Let *me* do the talking. I know the judge very well. He will critique every detail. He hates when people talk over him, or out of turn. But don't worry Mr. Phemus. We have the advantage. We always have the advantage. As much as I hate to go against the judge, I will appeal your case if I have to. Your children will get to keep their father with them, one way or another.""

""Thank you Mr. Isopedomenos. I do not know what I would do without your help... My children are very thankful their daddy has a good lawyer. I just hope the judge will see that I am a good person like you did.‚Äù

We walk into the court house, and I buy him coffee, and me orange juice (coffee is disgusting, tartarus spawn), keeping us sharp and awake. Ody walks into the courthouse behind us, his black tailcoat almost touching the ground. Holding a large coffee. He gives me a small nod in acknowledgement, but his light brown eyes say what he will not, ‚Äú*Good luck. I love you*‚Äù he trips a little bit over his own feet, a tint of red going over his olive, freckled face, and crawling up his neck.

I give him a¬† ‚Äú*I- love- you- too-. I -would- wish- you- good- luck- but- only -one- of- us -can- have- luck -in- this -situation- and- I -really- need- it,‚Äù* ¬†look in the sweetest way I can.

1 hour later, Mr. Phemus and I walked into the courtroom. Phemus sits down next to me, being very quiet, his hands folded in his lap. The jury starts filing in, the gallery coming in behind them, the giant wood doors shutting behind them. The Jury isn't an issue. They‚Äôre always suckers for single parents. The wooden doors swing open, and we all stand, as Ody comes in.

He goes to the raised dais, and sits behind his desk. He bangs the gavel, ‚ÄúCourt in session. This is a hearing for Mr. Polly Phemus. 1 count of robbery, 2 counts simple assault. How do you plead, Mr. Phemus?‚Äù

I look at Ody, with slight admiration, ‚ÄúMy client pleads guilty,‚Äù Phemus is just staring at the desk we‚Äôre sitting behind. Guilty plead gives more leeway

    ‚ÄúOkay, Mr. Isopedomenos. The maximum sentence for simple assault is 5 years. Robbery is life. With all things considered-‚Äù Ody looks at me, with a sweet look. A soft smile plays onto his lips, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to let you off with 2 years probation.‚Äù
    
    ‚ÄúThank you Judge Vasilias. My children will appreciate this very much.‚Äù Phemus nods at Ody.
    
    
    
    \*		\*		\*
    
    Ody closes the front door behind him, hanging up his tailcoat, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm home, Pooh,‚Äù

I go to the front door, like an excited child. Which I basically am, minus the child part, ‚ÄúHeyyyy ODYY,‚Äù I grab him by his black tie, giving him a kiss, ‚ÄúI see you got over your stoic facade, and felt human emotions for once,‚Äù I joke with him, wrapping my arms around him from behind, propping my chin on top of his head, ‚ÄúThank youuu,‚Äù Ody looks at me,¬†

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do it for you Polites,‚Äù he says softly.

    ‚ÄúYeah, yeah.‚Äù I roll my eyes, hearing no malice in his voice.
    
    ‚ÄúHow about we grab a treat from the store to celebrate,‚Äù
    
    ‚ÄúWe should stay in,‚Äù I say, yawning.
    
    ‚ÄúCome on, we deserve the treat. We can get ice cream. Mint chip.‚Äù
    
    ‚ÄúOkay. You got me. But we‚Äôre taking my truck.‚Äù
    
    I change into a baggy snoopy hoodie and plaid pj pants, matching with Ody. I sling my arm over Odys shoulder as we walk to my truck. Sitting in the driver's seat, Ody gets in, putting on his seatbelt. I push my glasses up my nose, swinging out of the driveway.
    
    The store is only 2 minutes away, and we pull up to the front of the store. We run up front, the spring air chilly. I keep Ody close, holding his hand. The warm store air envelops us as we walk in, heading for the ice cream aisle.
    
    We gather up a ton of snacks and put them on the only checkout conveyor that is still open. A young cashier rings stuff through. The person in front of us is done, when the bell chimes, the store door opens. An unusually¬† tall man in a black hoodie walks in, hands in his pockets. From what I can see of his face, he looks familiar. As he comes towards us, I feel the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

*Ody Vasilias*

    As I look at Pooh, he seems unsettled, ‚ÄúWhat's wrong?‚Äù I ask him. He has a confused look,
    
    ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù He looks around. A tall person holding a bag comes towards us, speed walking. The man-ish figure comes up, and looks at the cashier, ‚ÄúGive me the money.‚Äù I look in his hoodie pocket, and there is something in it, weighing it down.¬†
    
    The cashier looks at the person, eyes wide with fear. He opens the cash register, and removes the cash. There's not much, since most of this country is dominated by credit and debit cards, but the kid scrambles to take it out. He hands it to the person dressed in all black, fumbling. ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt think so,‚Äù Pooh says, stepping towards the robber. I put a hand on his chest, trying to get him to stop, ‚ÄúPolites. No. They will catch him.‚Äù¬†

The robber starts to run, the money in his bag. He looks so cliche, dressed in black, running away with a bag of money. Polites breaks from my hold, and runs after the guy,

‚ÄúPOLITES,‚Äù Pooh runs right to the robber, knocking into the mountain of a human. The guys shrugs Pooh off, but Pooh continues to fight back. The person reaches into their pocket. Pooh stops, as he gets sight of the person's face. ‚ÄúPhe-‚Äù¬† A sharp noise shatters through the silence. A gun. That's what was in their pocket. Pooh clutches his chest. He stumbles a bit, and lays himself on the ground . Phemus. It was Phemus. The criminal I let off.

My ears ring as I rush towards Pooh, a sizable puddle of blood surrounds him, the smell of iron taking over the room. The kid cashier is on the phone already, stuttering. I lean down next to him, panic nearly blinding me. His whimpers and cries make my heart ache. We‚Äôve binge watched enough medical shows together, that I immediately put pressure on the wound, Pooh screaming. Tears are running down both of our faces. Blood is still coming out of the wound, in squirts. I push harder, his breaths becoming laboured. As he screams again, I see blood coming up from the back of his throat.¬†

    Two cops arrive shortly before paramedics, and the rest is a blur. I sit by Pooh's side, holding his hand as the paramedics roll him into the ambulance. His grip slackens so much, I'm starting to lose hope. The looks on the paramedics' faces are not reassuring. Once we arrive at the hospital, they make me stay in the waiting room.
    
    I look down at my blood covered clothes and hands. A doctor comes by, giving me news about Pooh, and fresh clothes. The doctor leads me to an unused hospital room with a connected bathroom, ‚ÄúHere. You can shower here. Don‚Äôt want you smelling like blood if your special friend wakes up,‚Äù He leaves me alone. The worst part wasn't when he called Polites my ‚Äòspecial friend‚Äô. It was when he said *If* Polites wakes up. Not when. It's my fault. I showed empathy, and this is my payment, my husband struggling to stay alive, not even able to breathe on his own.

*Polites Isopedomenos*

The smell of bleach floods into my nose, waking me up. Looking to my side, Ody is sitting in a flimsy white chair, a blanket covering his small form.¬† My chest is feeling tight, sharp pains shooting through as I try to move into a sitting position. Ody‚Äôs eyes flutter open and shut, till he catches sight of me moving. His eyes shoot open, like he‚Äôs been wide awake for hours.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù My voice is a croak, struggling to get out of my mouth, ‚ÄúWow. I got shot.‚Äù. I wince, upping my morphine drip.

‚ÄúPolites, I swear to gods, If you ever *dare* to try something like that again, I swear,‚Äù He says all this, while trying to hug me, and not hurt me, tears overflowing from his eyes, ‚ÄúGods, I love you, so, so, so much. I can‚Äôt even believe I let you convince me that letting him off easy would be okay, but it's my fault, I should‚Äôve known better, I should‚Äôve known something bad would happen‚Ä¶‚Äù He snuggles up against my side that wasn‚Äôt shot, and holds me, calming us both down, ‚ÄúI know we‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù

\*	\*	\*

It's been 3 weeks. I‚Äôm finally released from the hospital. Ody has been all over me, making sure I won‚Äôt spend a second alone, or go a second without something that I want. Finally, I find myself alone. Ody went into the bathroom to take a shower, leaving me alone for the first time since I‚Äôve gotten home.

Today is Polly Phemus‚Äô trial. He has no chance of getting off with less than 3 years of prison.¬† I slip out of our bed, each breath a challenge. That happens when a bullet pierces your lung. -1000/10 experience. With a great deal of effort, I make it to the closet putting on a suit.

Ody steps out of the shower, his dark hair still dripping. He gets into a suit, one of his old ones, from when he wasn‚Äôt yet a judge. He grabs my hand, leading me into his boring black car, my head touching the ceiling.

Stepping into the courthouse, we‚Äôre holding hands, for once not coming for work. We sat in the gallery, watching the trial go on. Phemus gets a hefty sentence. 15 years. Phemus‚Äô children were in the stands next to us, 6 and 8 years old. They‚Äôre crying. Phemus is being pulled away in shackles, ‚ÄúWait! My children!‚Äù.¬† I look at his children. They shouldn‚Äôt have to go into the foster system because of what their father did. ‚ÄúPlease! My children, Pravato and Pravata,‚Äù

I stand without even thinking, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll look after them,‚Äù Ody looks at me like I have a few screws loose. The look I give Ody makes him stand down. I want this. And deep down, Ody wants children as well.

‚ÄúThank you‚Ä¶ Thank you Mr. Isopedomenos.‚Äù He‚Äôs dragged back to the holding cells, officers on his either side. I look at Ody, ‚ÄúI know it was impulsive-‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt.‚Äù He interrupts me, a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth, ‚ÄúOur house won‚Äôt be so empty anymore,‚Äù Happy tears glimmer in his eyes, as he pulls me closer.",1,1732562035.0,shortstory,0,1.0,False

The Left Right Game had long since abandoned logic. The road stretched endlessly, twisting reality with every turn, and Alice felt the wear of it deep in her bones. Left. Right. Left. Right. The rhythm was numbing, a funeral march for her sanity. The car had fallen into a heavy silence, save for the engine's low growl and the faint crackle of static on the radio, which seemed to creep louder the longer it played.¬†

She didn‚Äôt notice the diner until it appeared suddenly in the headlights, as if it had leapt into existence from the black void of the road. The building was ugly, squatting in the gravel lot like a toad, its neon sign flickering faintly: ‚ÄúMEAT & MYTHS CAF√â.‚Äù

‚ÄúWas this here before?‚Äù Alice asked, her voice hoarse from disuse.

Rob grunted, slowing the car. His hands tensed on the wheel. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

The building didn‚Äôt belong‚Äînot to this place, not to this world. The longer Alice stared at it, the more wrong it became. The windows were smeared with grime, their panes dimly reflecting the pulsing neon light. The diner‚Äôs roof sagged, as if it was groaning under some unseen weight. The gravel lot surrounding it was eerily smooth, like no car had ever parked there.¬†

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not stopping,‚Äù Rob said firmly, his voice leaving no room for debate.

Alice‚Äôs stomach growled loudly, a betrayal that echoed in the tense silence. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a diner. Look, I need to eat. I can‚Äôt keep going like this.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll find somewhere else.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere isn‚Äôt anywhere else.‚Äù She gestured at the unending void beyond the diner. ‚ÄúUnless you want to drive us straight into oblivion, this is all we‚Äôve got.

Rob hesitated, then sighed. ‚ÄúFive minutes. If something feels wrong‚Äîanything‚Äîwe‚Äôre leaving.‚Äù

As they stepped out of the car, Alice immediately regretted it. The air was wrong here‚Äîcold and damp, with a metallic tang that clung to the back of her throat. The gravel crunched underfoot, the sound unnaturally loud, like it echoed through an empty cavern.

Rob hesitated. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe neither,‚Äù Alice muttered, but she pushed open the door anyway.

‚Äî-

The door to the diner creaked open with an unnatural groan, the kind of sound you might expect from an old coffin lid in a horror movie. The smell hit Alice first‚Äîan unholy mixture of burned grease, copper, and something sweet and sickly, like spoiled fruit left out in the sun too long. It clung to the back of her throat, making her gag.

Inside, the diner was dimly lit by a single greenish fluorescent bulb that buzzed like a dying wasp. Shadows stretched unnaturally in the corners, too long and too dark for such weak light. The d√©cor was kitschy in the worst way: peeling wallpaper with a faded cow-print pattern, vinyl booths patched with duct tape, and walls crammed with cryptid paraphernalia. But the details were‚Ä¶ wrong.

A poster of the Mothman looked as though it had been drawn by a child, except the eyes were smudges of crimson that seemed wet. A stuffed jackalope sat on the counter, its tiny glass eyes cracked, leaking some kind of cloudy fluid. A stuffed raccoon mounted on the wall had human teeth. Its grin stretched far too wide. One wall featured a collection of ""missing persons"" flyers, each face distorted, each name blurred like it was being erased from existence. 

The only other occupants sat in the far booth. The first man, tall and wiry with wild hair and frantic eyes, was hunched over a mountain of notebooks. He was muttering to himself, his hand twitching as if itching to scribble more notes. Across from him sat a shorter man with broad shoulders and a sharp grin, an unlit cigar clamped between his teeth. His mug of coffee‚Äîor something pretending to be coffee‚Äîgave off a faint wisp of steam, though the air was far too cold for it.

The taller man noticed Alice and Rob first. His head snapped up like a startled bird, and his expression lit up with manic glee. ‚ÄúWait! You‚Äîyou‚Äôre playing the Left Right Game!‚Äù He scrambled to his feet, clutching a notebook to his chest. ‚ÄúI knew it was real! I knew it!‚Äù

Rob immediately stiffened. ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Wendigoon!‚Äù the man exclaimed, as though that explained anything. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been following this for years! It‚Äôs all connected‚Äîliminal spaces, unmarked disappearances, SCP foundations, cryptids, you name it!‚Äù He slapped his notebook with shaking hands. ‚ÄúYou have no idea how deep this goes.‚Äù

‚ÄúPretty sure they don‚Äôt care, buddy,‚Äù said the shorter man, standing and stretching lazily. His grin widened as he sauntered toward them, his boots clinking on the tile. ‚ÄúName‚Äôs Papa Meat. Welcome to the edge of nowhere. You hungry?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Rob said flatly, gripping Alice‚Äôs arm as if ready to bolt.

Papa Meat chuckled, the sound low and sharp like a knife scraping bone. ‚ÄúBad idea, starving yourself out here. Things get‚Ä¶ hinky when your stomach‚Äôs empty. That‚Äôs when the road starts whispering to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúOr when the shadows start crawling into your brain,‚Äù Wendigoon added helpfully. His grin twitched nervously, as though he regretted saying it out loud.

‚ÄúOr when you burst into flames,‚Äù Papa Meat added casually, tapping the side of his head. ‚ÄúBut hey, maybe that‚Äôs just me.‚Äù

Alice blinked. ‚ÄúBurst into flames?‚Äù

Papa Meat‚Äôs grin turned sharp. ‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt worry. It‚Äôs a metaphor.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs it?‚Äù Wendigoon muttered, casting a wary glance at the faint scorch marks on the floor near the counter.¬†

Rob cleared his throat, glaring at the pair. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not here to chat. We‚Äôre just passing through.‚Äù

‚ÄúPassing through!‚Äù Wendigoon laughed, a high-pitched, hysterical sound that didn‚Äôt match his gaunt face. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what everyone says! Then they stop for a bite to eat, and boom‚Äînext thing you know, they‚Äôre part of the legend. Or missing.‚Äù He snapped his notebook open and jabbed a finger at a crude map that looked like it had been drawn in a frenzy. ‚ÄúSee this spot here? Right where we are? No one ever leaves the same way they came in. Ever.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not helping,‚Äù Papa Meat drawled, rolling his cigar between his teeth. He leaned casually against the counter, where the waitress stood motionless, her back still turned. ‚ÄúIgnore him. He‚Äôs been here too long. Poor guy‚Äôs cracking up like a cheap snow globe.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine‚Äù Wendigoon hissed, though his twitching hands told a different story. ‚ÄúAt least I‚Äôm not pretending this place is normal.‚Äù

Alice shivered, glancing toward the counter. The waitress hadn‚Äôt moved since they walked in. Her head was tilted at an unnatural angle, and her hair hung limp and greasy, obscuring her face. Something about her silhouette looked off‚Äîtoo thin, like she‚Äôd been stretched.

‚ÄúCan she‚Ä¶ hear us?‚Äù Alice whispered.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about her,‚Äù Papa Meat said, his grin never faltering. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just here for ambiance. Like the music, you know?‚Äù He gestured toward the jukebox in the corner, which was belting out a warped, haunting version of some old country song. ‚ÄúThis place is all about the vibe.‚Äù

Rob wasn‚Äôt buying it. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with this diner?‚Äù

Wendigoon stiffened, lowering his voice. ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt exist yesterday.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd it won‚Äôt exist tomorrow,‚Äù Papa Meat added cheerfully. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs here now. That‚Äôs the magic, baby.‚Äù

Alice‚Äôs stomach churned. ‚ÄúWe should go.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot before you try the Special,‚Äù Papa Meat said, straightening. His voice was low now, dangerous. The grin stayed on his face, but his eyes darkened, gleaming like embers under ash. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs free. On the house.‚Äù

Wendigoon made a strangled noise. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch it. Don‚Äôt even look at it. That‚Äôs how they get you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs they?‚Äù Rob demanded.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find out,‚Äù Papa Meat said, his tone breezy but laced with something predatory. He gestured to the waitress, who turned slowly, her head swiveling far too far on her neck.¬†

Her face was pale, featureless. No eyes, no mouth‚Äîjust a smooth, blank surface. But something moved beneath the skin, bulging and squirming, as though her features were trying to claw their way out.

The lights flickered, and a low, wet noise echoed from behind the counter, like raw meat being dragged across tile. The waitress raised a hand, impossibly long fingers curling toward Alice and Rob.

‚ÄúTime to go,‚Äù Rob said, pulling Alice toward the door.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look back!‚Äù Wendigoon yelled, his voice breaking. ‚ÄúNo matter what you hear, no matter what they say,‚Ä¶don‚Äôt look back!‚Äù

Papa Meat chuckled, his voice trailing them as they fled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be back. They always come back.‚Äù

As Alice stumbled out into the gravel lot, she swore she felt heat on her back‚Äîlike flames licking at her heels.

  
‚Äî-

The cold outside the diner wasn‚Äôt the same as before‚Äîit felt alive now, charged with static and bitter heat, as though the air itself were confused about its own temperature. It carried with it a strange heaviness, thick with static and the faint smell of burning hair. Alice stumbled toward the car, her legs trembling, her mind racing to keep up with what she‚Äôd just seen. The gravel underfoot was no longer gravel; it squished like damp moss, leaving behind oily stains on her shoes.

‚ÄúGet in,‚Äù Rob said sharply, yanking the driver‚Äôs side door open. Alice hesitated, glancing back at the diner.

The neon sign above the door flickered violently, the letters shifting, twisting, and stretching into a shape she couldn‚Äôt quite comprehend. For a fleeting moment, the buzzing sign didn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúMEAT & MYTHS CAF√â‚Äù anymore‚Äîit said something else. Something in a language she didn‚Äôt know but instinctively feared. Her vision swam as she stared, nausea rising in her throat.

‚ÄúAlice!‚Äù Rob shouted, snapping her out of it.

She climbed into the passenger seat, slamming the door shut just as the shadow of the waitress appeared in the doorway of the diner. She was standing completely still, but her head turned to follow them as Rob started the car. The engine roared to life, but it didn‚Äôt sound right. The hum wasn‚Äôt mechanical‚Äîit was organic, wet, like something breathing deep inside the engine block.

Rob threw the car into reverse, the tires spinning in the gravel. They jerked backward, and Alice felt a wave of relief‚Äîbrief, fleeting relief‚Äîuntil she glanced out the window.

The diner was no longer behind them.

It was ahead of them.

‚ÄúRob, stop!‚Äù she screamed, her voice cracking.

He slammed the brakes, the car skidding to a halt. The diner sat there, unchanged, waiting for them, its neon sign buzzing mockingly. The windows were dark now, but Alice could see faint, pale shapes moving behind the glass‚Äîshapes that weren‚Äôt human, shapes that weren‚Äôt anything she could name.

Rob‚Äôs hands gripped the wheel so tightly his knuckles were bone white. ‚ÄúWhat the hell‚Äîwhat the hell is this?‚Äù

Alice looked behind them. The gravel lot stretched into the void, infinite and featureless, no road, no exit, no trace of where they had come from. She felt her chest tighten. They weren‚Äôt just trapped. They were being kept.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the diner,‚Äù she whispered, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt want us to leave.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs ridiculous,‚Äù Rob snapped, but his voice lacked conviction. He threw the car into drive and hit the gas. The engine screamed, the car lurched forward, and for a moment, Alice thought they might break through.

But the closer they got to the diner, the further away it seemed. The building stretched impossibly, the doors and windows elongating like melting wax. The neon sign buzzed louder, each flicker sending a jolt of nausea through Alice‚Äôs body. She felt her stomach churn as if the road itself were twisting beneath them.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs moving,‚Äù Rob muttered, his voice shaking. ‚ÄúThe damn diner is moving.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Alice said, her voice barely a whisper. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre the ones moving.‚Äù

The gravel shifted under the car like a living thing, bucking and writhing, forcing the tires to skid. The headlights flickered, and in the brief flashes of light, Alice saw shapes in the darkness‚Äîfigures emerging from the void. They weren‚Äôt people. They weren‚Äôt animals. They were tall, lanky silhouettes with limbs that bent in wrong directions and heads too wide, too flat, too full of teeth.

Alice screamed as one of the figures darted toward the car, slamming a hand against the passenger window. Its fingers were long and thin, tipped with what looked like shards of broken glass. It didn‚Äôt have a face‚Äîjust a gaping void where its mouth should‚Äôve been, a hollow that hissed with static.¬†

Rob stomped the gas again, but the car barely moved. The diner seemed to swell around them, the buzzing sign now a deafening roar. Alice clutched her ears, but it didn‚Äôt help. The sound was inside her head, burrowing into her skull like tiny, wriggling insects.

‚ÄúLet us go!‚Äù Rob screamed, slamming his fists on the wheel.

The buzzing stopped abruptly.

The silence was worse.

\---

The headlights flickered once more, and suddenly they weren‚Äôt alone in the car. Papa Meat sat in the back seat, grinning, his unlit cigar dangling from his mouth. The faint scent of smoke curled around him, though nothing in the car was burning.

‚ÄúLeaving so soon?‚Äù he drawled, his voice smooth and unsettlingly calm. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt even try the Special.‚Äù

‚ÄúGet out of the car,‚Äù Rob growled, twisting in his seat to face him.

Papa Meat raised his hands innocently, but his grin widened. ‚ÄúRelax. I‚Äôm just here to help. Don‚Äôt you want to know how this ends?‚Äù

Alice turned, her breath catching in her throat. Wendigoon was now sitting beside Papa Meat, hunched forward, his hands wringing nervously. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt leave,‚Äù he said, his voice shaking. ‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôre leaving, but you‚Äôre not. You‚Äôre just‚Äîjust looping back. That‚Äôs what it does. It loops you. It eats you alive, piece by piece.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the *hell* are you doing in here?‚Äù Rob roared, twisting in his seat.

Wendigoon ignored him, flipping through his notebook with frantic energy. ‚ÄúMm, mm, yes, fascinating. You‚Äôve‚Äîyou‚Äôve disrupted the system by trying to leave. Oh, oh, bad move, bad move. Uh, now it‚Äôs‚Äîit‚Äôs alive, see? It‚Äôs‚Äîit‚Äôs *thinking,* adapting.‚Äù He jabbed a finger at a crude diagram on the page, his hand shaking. ‚ÄúThe diner doesn‚Äôt want you to leave because‚Äîwell, uh, well, because it *can‚Äôt let you go.* You‚Äîyou‚Äôre part of the equation now.‚Äù

Rob‚Äôs grip tightened on the wheel, his knuckles white. ‚ÄúShut up.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, no, no, no, can‚Äôt shut up now, can we? No, no, must, uh, must explain,‚Äù Wendigoon stammered, his manic grin widening. ‚ÄúYou see, uh, the diner‚Äîit‚Äîit‚Äôs not just, uh, here. It‚Äôs‚Äîit‚Äôs *everywhere.* It‚Äôs a‚Äîa liminal space, yes, yes, a‚Äîa crossroads between‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up!‚Äù Rob bellowed.

Alice stared at Wendigoon, her stomach twisting. His eyes were wide, bloodshot, darting back and forth like he was watching something no one else could see. His smile was too big, too forced, and his expression was breaking down, turning into something desperate and broken.

‚ÄúDoes‚Äîdoes this seem fun to you?‚Äù Alice whispered, her voice barely audible. ‚ÄúDoes this seem *normal*?‚Äù

‚ÄúFun?‚Äù Wendigoon‚Äôs head jerked toward her, his expression twisting into something darker, something almost feral. ‚ÄúNo, no, no, not fun. Uh, fascinating. Horrific. Inevitably, uh, tragic.‚Äù

Wendigoon‚Äôs grin widened, and his voice shifted into a broken, half-hearted impression: ‚ÄúAh, yes, yes, the diner is, uh, like life, huh? Uh, uh, finds a way. Only‚Äîoh, this is the kicker‚Äîit‚Äôs not life finding a way, no, no. It‚Äôs death. Death. Hah! Clever girl.‚Äù

Alice stared at him, her skin crawling. The impression wasn‚Äôt funny. It wasn‚Äôt even close. It was wrong, disjointed, like someone trying to mimic human humor without understanding it.

‚ÄúWhy are you in the car?‚Äù she whispered, her voice trembling.

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Wendigoon said, leaning forward. His smile faltered for the first time. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to be *in* there when it starts to burn.‚Äù

‚ÄúBurn?‚Äù Rob demanded, spinning around fully now.

Before Wendigoon could answer, the temperature in the car spiked. The air grew thick, choking, and Alice felt a bead of sweat roll down her neck. She glanced out the window. The diner was glowing now‚Äînot with the sickly neon light, but with flames. They crawled up the walls, licking at the roof, but they weren‚Äôt normal flames. They didn‚Äôt flicker or spread. They *pulsed*, alive and sentient, twisting around the building like a lover‚Äôs embrace.

From within the flames came movement‚Äîshadows, impossibly large and grotesque, pressing against the windows. Pale, limb-like shapes clawed at the glass, leaving smears of darkness that didn‚Äôt fade.

‚ÄúOhhh,‚Äù Wendigoon breathed, staring at the flames like a man hypnotized. ‚ÄúThere it is. There‚Äôs the good stuff.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat good stuff?‚Äù Alice demanded, panic rising in her voice.

‚ÄúThe fire,‚Äù Wendigoon whispered, his voice reverent. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not fire. Not really. It‚Äôs, uh, how do you say it‚Äîmmm‚Äîit‚Äôs hunger. Pure, unfiltered hunger. Burning doesn‚Äôt matter here. Not to it. No, no, it *consumes* in other ways.‚Äù

Papa Meat rolled his eyes, leaning back casually. ‚ÄúDrama queen. Don‚Äôt listen to him. The road likes to play with its food, sure, but you‚Äôre not on the menu yet. Not until you do something‚Ä¶really stupid.‚Äù His grin turned sharp, and for a moment, his eyes flickered‚Äînot with light, but with flame.

Alice felt the heat rising in the car, the air growing suffocating. ‚ÄúRob,‚Äù she whispered, her voice barely audible. ‚ÄúDrive. Just drive.‚Äù

Rob slammed the gear shift into drive again, the tires screeching as the car lurched forward. ‚ÄúGet out of the car!‚Äù he shouted, ‚ÄúNow!‚Äù

The diner‚Äôs sign exploded in a burst of orange light, flames licking the edges of the building. But instead of burning away, the fire seemed to grow the diner, its walls twisting and pulsing like something alive. The windows shattered outward, and from within came a sound‚Äîa low, guttural noise, like a thousand voices screaming underwater.

And then the car broke through.

For a moment, Alice felt weightless, as though they were falling into nothing. The roar of the fire, the screams, the static‚Äîit all fell away, leaving only silence.

When Alice opened her eyes, they were back on the road.

The diner was gone.

The gravel was gone.

The backseat empty.

But Alice couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something had followed them.

And in the rearview mirror, just for a moment, she thought she saw the flicker of a neon sign.

1gzr14b,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gzr14b/am_i_over_thinking/,Am I over thinking?,"Backstory: I went on a date on Sunday, we met up at 11am and walked around, got some coffee. We walked around a park in the rain, it was nice, and we both found the conversation easy. We share a lot of the same opinions and felt like we got on well together.

Before parting ways we spoke about a second date, organized it for Tuesday night, she invited me round hers, we‚Äôre trainee teachers so the plan was to help each-other with lesson plans, and then we were going to cook together.

We hugged at the end of the date, she gave me her umbrella because I was walking back to my car and it was about a 20 minute walk. She said she wants the umbrella back though and I should bring it on Tuesday.

Today: I got in from work and had a voice note from explaining that she‚Äôs had a migraine all day, that she felt ill (to me she sounded sick in the voice note) and was letting me know now instead of last minute that tomorrow might need to be canceled.

I don‚Äôt know what to do, I‚Äôve sent her a text explaining that it‚Äôs okay, and if she would like to reschedule. 

But now I‚Äôm stupidly overthinking the situation and it‚Äôs gotten me down. 

Am I assuming the worst or am I just generally other thinking the situation?

1gzr0mt,https://i.redd.it/sc18tyqyj33e1.jpeg,A couple wonderful days of hauls,"Really great haul this week. All from the local used bookstore. There‚Äôs something about a used bookstore that the new ones can‚Äôt compete with: the hunt, the smell of old paper, the thrill of never knowing what will be on the shelves the next time you arrive, what treasures you might find at a song. 

Some days, when I know theirs copies of the latest books, those shortlisted for the Man Booker or the Pulitzer, sitting cozy between their hardcovers on the shelves fresh from the press. I know they‚Äôll be there and I know I‚Äôll enjoy reading them, but they don‚Äôt offer the same gratification of frequenting the aisles of the used store. You don‚Äôt get the joy of checking for that authors name every couple of days, getting your hopes dashed until finally there they are as if they‚Äôve waited your arrival and wonder ‚Äúwhat took you so long?‚Äù.

Last Thursday and Friday were what used store dreams are made of. I walked in with my coffee and saw Elena Ferrante‚Äôs book on one of the displays. My heart shot into my throat. I collected the piece and continued through my list. A few titles recently added to my list followed. If the book is there the first time you look for it it never sparks the same thrill, but it‚Äôs still wonderful to know you‚Äôve snagged the only copy. Then I went toward the counter and turned to find the savage detectives also on display. I‚Äôd been looking for Bola√±o here for weeks and this is the first copy I‚Äôve found of his. I couldn‚Äôt believe my luck. 

I hope all of you have had this feeling as well. Happy hunting!",20,1732561872.0,bookhaul,1,1.0,False

The magenta sun cast long shadows across Tzzk'rix's hydroponic garden as he tenderly adjusted the nutrient flow to his prize-winning crystal melons. Life on Agricultural Colony P-789 was peaceful, predictable, and most importantly, completely devoid of anything remotely resembling an ""adventure.""



""Perfect,"" he chittered to himself, his mandibles clicking in satisfaction as he recorded the day's growth measurements. ""Another successful harvest cycle without a single near-death experience.""



His communicator buzzed. Again. For the forty-seventh time that morning. He ignored it, just as he had ignored the previous forty-six notifications. The Empire could wait - his melons needed him.



The crystal melons sparkled in the dying light, their faceted surfaces refracting tiny rainbows across his exoskeleton. Nothing like the sweat-inducing horrors of that Australian ""vacation"" three years ago. His therapist said he was making excellent progress, though he still couldn't look at a coffee cup without flinching\[1\].



The communicator's buzzing grew more insistent, developing an almost angry undertone. Tzzk'rix adjusted his farming apron and continued pretending he couldn't hear it.



A shadow fell across his garden. A very large, distinctly shuttle-shaped shadow.



""Oh, void take it,"" he muttered, watching his prized melons crack under the heat of the shuttle's landing thrusters. ""Not again.""



The shuttle's door hissed open with unnecessary dramatic flair. Commander K'thax emerged, all four arms crossed in what Tzzk'rix recognized as the universal gesture for 'you're in deep trouble, soldier.'



""Shadow Strike Commander Tzzk'rix,"" K'thax's voice dripped with sarcasm. ""Or should I say... Farmer Terry?""



""I was just about to check my messages,"" Tzzk'rix lied, trying to shield what remained of his crystal melon patch. ""Been terribly busy. Very important agricultural duties.""



""Forty-seven ignored communications,"" K'thax's upper right arm twitched. ""Including one marked 'Urgent: Fate of Empire at Stake' and another labeled 'Your Mother Wants to Know Why You Haven't Called.'""



Tzzk'rix's antennae drooped. ""The melons needed precise attention during their crystallization phase?""



""The High Command requires your... unique expertise."" K'thax managed to make 'unique' sound like a terminal disease. ""We have a situation on Earth.""



The word 'Earth' sent Tzzk'rix's nervous system into overdrive and several scales fell off. His secondary heart started palpitating, and his chromatophores flickered in distress patterns that spelled out 'NO' in seventeen different languages.



""Absolutely not,"" he backed away, clutching a broken crystal melon like a shield. ""I'm retired. Completely retired. Look, I have a garden! And... and... a collection of exotic fertilizers!""



""It's about their young.A simple mission this time.""



Tzzk'rix paused. ""Their... offspring?""



""We need someone to infiltrate a human educational facility. Someone with experience in human behaviors. Someone who has survived their recreational activities.""



""But surely there are others-""



""You're the only operative who's ever returned from a human 'vacation' with all limbs intact, albeit with several interesting new phobias.""



""The coffee wasn't my fault! And those 'drop bears' are real! I know they're real!""



K'thax's mandibles twitched in what might have been sympathy. ""I repeat. The mission is simple. Infiltrate. Observe their young. Report back. No hiking, no spicy food, no bungee jumping.""



""Their young,"" Tzzk'rix repeated slowly, remembering the docile Draknid hatchlings he'd helped raise before his military career. His eyes darted around like he wanted to bolt.



K'thax's antennae curled in amusement. ""So you'll do it?""



Tzzk'rix looked at his ruined garden, then at the setting sun. His sense of duty warred with his hard-earned survival instincts. ""I suppose... for the Empire...""



""Excellent! Your bio-modification begins tomorrow. We've made some upgrades since last time. The sweating issue should be mostly resolved.""



As K'thax turned to leave, he added casually, ""Oh, and you'll be handling something called a 'kindergarten class.'""



Later that night, as Tzzk'rix packed his emergency beacon (now upgraded with triple redundancy), he wondered why the word 'kindergarten' made his commander's mandibles twitch so violently. After all, he'd survived Australian wildlife.¬†



His last thought, as he locked up his greenhouse, was that at least this time he wouldn't have to drink any coffee.



\---



The bio-modification chamber hummed ominously as Tzzk'rix endured his second transformation into human form. Three years of peaceful farming hadn't prepared him for this moment.



""We've made significant improvements,"" Chief Medical Officer V'lax announced, her tentacles dancing over holographic controls. ""The sweating issue should be mostly resolved, and we've added a new feature - your skin won't change colors when stressed.""



""Mostly resolved?"" Tzzk'rix's mandibles clicked nervously.



""And the coffee resistance has been upgraded to maximum capacity,"" she added, ignoring his question. ""Though I still wouldn't recommend testing it.""



The transformation process felt like being turned inside out while solving complex mathematical equations in zero gravity. When it was complete, Tzzk'rix examined his reflection - tall, lean, with what humans would consider an ""approachable"" face. Perfect for a substitute teacher.



""Remember,"" Commander K'thax briefed him, ""you're 'Mr. Terry' from Canada. We've prepared extensive documentation about your teaching credentials.""



""Surely watching young humans can't be worse than-""



""Don't say it!"" K'thax interrupted. ""Every time someone mentions Australia, the medical bay's PTSD sensors overload."" Somewhere an alarm sounded.



Happy Valley Elementary School loomed before him like a fortress. Tiny humans swarmed the entrance, their high-pitched vocalizations piercing the morning air. Their energy signatures were off the charts.



""Mr. Terry?"" Principal Johnson extended her hand. ""Welcome to Happy Valley! Don't worry about the scorch marks on the playground equipment - the fire department says they're mostly cosmetic.""



Tzzk'rix's bio-suit registered a spike in anxiety. ""Scorch marks?""



""Oh yes, little Timmy discovered chemistry last week. Such an enthusiastic learner! We've since implemented a strict 'No Unauthorized Explosions' policy.""



The tour of the school revealed what Tzzk'rix could only describe as organized chaos. Tiny humans ricocheted off walls with impossible energy levels. Art projects that defied the laws of physics adorned the halls. And was that... a hamster giving him a suspicious look?



""This will be your classroom,"" Principal Johnson gestured to Room 23. ""Mrs. Henderson had a family emergency - something about her sister's pet iguana achieving sentience. The usual substitute is out with a medical emergency - the doctors say she'll stop speaking in rhymes any day now.""



Inside the classroom, evidence of recent chaos was everywhere. Glitter - the most persistent form of human biological warfare - sparkled ominously on every surface. Crayon drawings depicted scenes that would make military strategists weep.



""One last thing,"" Principal Johnson added cheerfully. ""We've had to ban sugar in the classroom after The Great Cupcake Incident of Last Tuesday. We're still finding frosting in the air vents.""



As she left, Tzzk'rix noticed a crude drawing on the wall labeled ""My Family Fighting Dragons."" The dragons were losing.



His internal communicator buzzed: ""Status report?""

""Preparing for first contact with human offspring,"" he replied. ""Request permission to upgrade bio-suit's armor rating.""



The first tiny humans began filtering into the classroom. Their energy signatures made ghost peppers look tame.



""Are you our new teacher?"" a small female with pigtails asked. ""Mrs. Henderson let us keep Gerald.""



""Gerald?""



A class tarantula waved from its terrarium.



Tzzk'rix's bio-suit began sweating despite the upgrades. It was going to be a long day.



""Don't worry,"" a boy with missing front teeth grinned. ""We only lost two substitute teachers this year!""



His emergency beacon suddenly felt very, very light in his pocket.



The morning bell rang. Somewhere in the universe, his crystal melons were probably wilting in sympathy.



Tzzk'rix's bio-suit hiccupped. This was definitely worse than Australia.



\---

  


""Mr. Terry"" - stood before his classroom of twenty-five kindergarteners, who stared at him with unnervingly calculating eyes. His bio-suit was already beginning to malfunction under their intense scrutiny.



""Good morning, tiny hu- I mean, children,"" he managed, trying to sound cheerful rather than terrified. ""Your regular teacher had an emergency, so I'll be-""



""Why do you sweat so much?"" a small girl with pigtails interrupted, her hand still raised even as she asked the question.



""And why does your face glitch sometimes?"" added a boy missing his front teeth.



""I have a medical condition,"" Tzzk'rix replied, using his standard excuse. ""It's very common in Canada.""



""My mom's from Canada,"" another child piped up. ""She never glitches.""



Before Tzzk'rix could formulate a response, the classroom door burst open. Mrs. Henderson's assistant rushed in, looking frantic.



""Mr. Terry! Emergency staff meeting - just five minutes. The children are having their morning snack, everything's laid out. They're only allowed the sugar-free options in the blue containers!""



She disappeared as quickly as she'd arrived, leaving Tzzk'rix alone with twenty-five pairs of eyes that suddenly gleamed with disturbing intelligence.



""Snack time!"" the children chorused with suspicious enthusiasm.



Tzzk'rix approached the snack table, checking the blue containers. His relief at finding everything properly organized lasted exactly thirty seconds - the time it took him to realize the children had somehow orchestrated a complex snack-switching operation while his back was turned.



""These fruit snacks taste funny,"" he muttered, examining one. His bio-suit's chemical analyzer kicked in too late. ""Wait... this isn't sugar-free!""



""SUGAR RUSH!"" screamed a tiny boy who had already consumed an impossible amount of contraband candy.



The classroom erupted into chaos. Children bounced off walls with physics-defying energy levels. His combat training hadn't prepared him for this. Even the drop bears seemed preferable.



""Mr. Terry,"" a small girl tugged his sleeve, ""why do you have antennae?""



""I don't have-"" he reached up in horror, feeling his bio-suit glitching from stress. He quickly smoothed his hair over the betraying appendages.



""Those are just... fashion accessories. Very popular in Canada.""



""Then why did they just move?""



""The air conditioning!""



A boy performing acrobatics off his desk called out, ""My dad works at NASA and says aliens exist. Are you an alien, Mr. Terry?""



""Preposterous!"" Tzzk'rix's voice modulator squeaked. ""I am a completely normal human educator who enjoys normal human activities like... consuming dihydrogen monoxide and... performing photosynthesis- I mean, eating vegetables!""



""Photosynthesis is what plants do,"" a particularly scholarly-looking child corrected. ""We learned that yesterday.""



His bio-suit was now working overtime to maintain his human appearance as the sugar-charged children circled him like tiny predators. One of them had started taking notes.



""Your eyes went sideways,"" observed another child, now standing impossibly close. ""Like a lizard.""



""And you're sweating rainbow colors,"" added his note-taking colleague.



""That's... that's just the light reflecting off my... completely normal human perspiration!""



The classroom hamster, Gerald, watched from his cage with what Tzzk'rix swore was knowing suspicion. Even the class tarantula seemed to be judging him.



""If you're really human,"" challenged a girl who had somehow acquired war paint made from glitter, ""why does your hand have six fingers sometimes?""



Tzzk'rix looked down in horror to see his bio-suit glitching between human and Draknid form. The children had formed a circle around him, their sugar-enhanced energy making them move with terrifying speed and coordination.



""I can explain-"" he began, just as his antennae popped out again.



""ALIEN TEACHER!"" they cheered in unison, far too delighted by this revelation.



""Can you teach us alien math?""

""Do you have a spaceship?""

""Can we see your real face?""

""Are there alien kindergartens?""



The questions came rapid-fire as his bio-suit continued its spectacular malfunction. Gerald the hamster turned his wheel with smug satisfaction, as if he'd known all along.



""This is a Level 7 violation of infiltration protocols,"" Tzzk'rix muttered to himself, watching as his carefully constructed cover story crumbled before the terrifyingly perceptive minds of sugar-enhanced human children.



""Level 7 what?"" asked the note-taking child, who had somehow acquired a voice recorder.



Just then, the classroom door opened. The assistant poked her head in, took one look at the chaos - including Tzzk'rix's now partially visible scales - and sighed.



""First time with the morning sugar rush, huh? Don't worry, they'll crash in about an hour. Oh, and your antennae are showing again.""



She closed the door, leaving Tzzk'rix to wonder if perhaps the entire human species was in on the secret and just enjoyed watching him suffer.



""Can we learn alien languages now?"" asked the girl with pigtails, bouncing literally off the walls.



\---



""Now, let‚Äôs make friendship bracelets!"" Tzzk'rix announced with forced enthusiasm, hoping this activity would be less chaotic than the morning's sugar-fueled pandemonium.



The children's eyes lit up with an intensity that made his bio-suit's threat detection systems activate. He'd learned that look meant trouble.



""Can we use the sparkly beads?"" piped up Sarah-Jane, the same girl who'd earlier presented a detailed theory about his ""fashion accessories"" being alien antennae.



""Of course! Just remember to-"" Before he could finish his safety briefing, twenty-five tiny humans descended upon the craft supplies like piranha attacking their prey.



""Mr. Terry!"" Tommy called out, already somehow tangled in twelve feet of craft string. ""I made a quantum entanglement!""



""That's not how quantum-"" Tzzk'rix caught himself. ""I mean, very creative, Tommy. Let's untangle you before you create a temporal paradox- I mean, before recess.""



His bio-suit hiccupped, causing his right hand to briefly display six fingers. The note-taking child from earlier immediately added this to her growing ""Evidence"" notebook.



""Mr. Terry,"" she asked innocently, ""why does your hand keep doing that?""



""Carpal tunnel!"" he squeaked. ""Very common among Canadian teachers. We spend too much time... um... wrestling moose.""



The class hamster, Gerald, gave him what could only be described as an eye-roll.



Paint appeared next - though Tzzk'rix couldn't recall authorizing its distribution. The children wielded their brushes like tiny Jackson Pollocks on a sugar rush.



""Look, Mr. Terry!"" exclaimed Billy, holding up what appeared to be an anatomically accurate diagram of a spaceship. ""I drew your house!""



""That's not my- I mean, what a lovely drawing of a... completely normal human house,"" Tzzk'rix stammered, his chromatophores flickering in panic.



""Why's it got an anti-gravity generator?"" asked Emily, peering at the drawing.



""And a flux capacitor?"" added the ever-observant note-taker.



""Those are... Canadian architectural features. For the snow. Yes. Snow protection technology.""



His bio-suit chose that moment to malfunction spectacularly, causing his hair to briefly stand up like antennae. The children cheered.



""Do the color change thing again!"" demanded Jessica, brandishing her paint brush like a weapon.



""I don't- That's not-"" Tzzk'rix spluttered, but his suit betrayed him, cycling through several non-human colors.



""COOL!"" the class chorused. Gerald the hamster seemed to be smirking.



""Mr. Terry,"" Tommy had somehow managed to create an even more complex string theory, ""why does your voice sound like bells when you're surprised?""



""And why do you have an extra knee sometimes?"" added Sarah-Jane.



""And how come you keep calling our snacks 'fuel packets'?"" Emily chimed in.



The classroom door opened, offering brief hope of rescue. Instead, Principal Johnson poked her head in, took one look at the chaos, and smiled.



""Having fun with arts and crafts? Oh, Mr. Terry, your skin is doing that rainbow thing again. My cousin has the same condition - must be something in the Canadian water!""



She left before Tzzk'rix could respond, leaving him to face his increasingly suspicious students.



""Time for clean up!"" he announced desperately, hoping to distract from his latest bio-suit malfunction.



""But first,"" the note-taker raised her hand, ""can you explain why you tried to eat the clay earlier?""



""I thought it was a protein supplement- I mean, I was testing it for safety!""



The class hamster actually facepalmed.



As the children began their cleanup routine - which somehow created more chaos than the actual activity - Tzzk'rix sent another message to Command: ""Request immediate curriculum update. Earth children possess disturbing levels of observational skills and pattern recognition. Suspect possible psychic abilities. Also, require new bio-suit - current model apparently not child-proof.""



The hamster watched him with knowing eyes as he helped untangle Tommy from his string theory gone wrong. Somewhere in the universe, his peaceful farming colony was probably missing him.¬†



At least they hadn't discovered his emergency beacon. Yet.



\---



Tzzk'rix stood at the edge of the playground, his bio-suit finally stabilized after the morning's arts and crafts chaos. The relative calm lasted exactly thirty-seven seconds.



""RECESS TIME!"" twenty-five tiny voices screamed in unison as they burst through the doors like a swarm of locusts high on sugar-free juice boxes that were definitely not sugar-free.



""Remember,"" called out Mrs. Henderson's assistant before disappearing again, ""just make sure nobody eats the wood chips or trades their lunch for rocks again!""



The playground, which had seemed peaceful moments ago, transformed into what Tzzk'rix could only describe as a miniature gladiatorial arena. Children swung from impossible heights, scaled walls like gravity was optional, and appeared to teleport between play structures.



""Mr. Terry!"" Sarah-Jane called from upside down on the monkey bars, ""Watch this!""



His bio-suit began sweating before she even started her move - a triple flip that would have earned respect from his combat instructors.



""That's... that's not physically possible,"" he muttered, checking his sensors for anti-gravity anomalies.



""I can do better!"" Tommy launched himself from the top of the slide, performing what appeared to be advanced aerial acrobatics.



""CONTAINMENT BREACH!"" Tzzk'rix yelped before catching himself. ""I mean... please be careful!""



The note-taking child appeared beside him, clipboard in hand. ""Mr. Terry, why do you keep military terminology when you're stressed?""



""I... watch a lot of science fiction movies. In Canada. Where we all talk like this. Normally.""



Gerald the hamster, visible through the classroom window, appeared to be taking notes of his own.



A high-pitched scream drew his attention to the sandbox, where an intense negotiation over a plastic shovel had devolved into what the children called ""sharing time"" but looked suspiciously like advanced tactical warfare.



""They're playing 'cooties'!"" warned Billy, running past at speeds that shouldn't be possible for such small legs.



""Biological warfare?"" Tzzk'rix squeaked, his bio-suit beginning to malfunction again. ""Is that authorized for this age group?""



""Tag! You've got cooties!"" Jessica touched his arm and ran away giggling.



His bio-suit went into full decontamination mode, causing him to sparkle briefly in the sunlight.



""Ooh!"" the children chorused. ""Do the sparkly thing again!""



""That's just... Canadian sunscreen reaction,"" he stammered, trying to control his malfunctioning epidermis. ""Very common in... maple syrup country.""



The playground had developed distinct territorial zones: the Slide Kingdom, ruled by a five-year-old queen who demanded tribute in the form of juice boxes; the Monkey Bar Militia, performing increasingly impossible acrobatic feats; and the Sandbox Syndicate, conducting complex negotiations involving plastic dinosaurs as currency.



""Mr. Terry,"" Emily tugged his sleeve, ""can you settle a debate? Jimmy says aliens aren't real, but I saw you change colors during art class.""



""That's... that's just... I have a very rare condition called... Human Normalness Syndrome!""



The note-taking child's pencil scratched faster.



His bio-suit chose that moment to hiccup spectacularly, producing a rainbow sweat pattern that would have made a chameleon jealous.



""COOL!"" the children abandoned their territories to watch the light show.



""Is this part of your Canadian condition too?"" asked the ever-observant note-taker.



""Yes! We call it... Aurora Borealis Syndrome! Very common in... igloo season.""



Gerald the hamster had somehow acquired tiny sunglasses and appeared to be judging him through the window.



As recess wound down, Tzzk'rix's mission report consisted of one line: ""Human offspring appear to have mastered both anti-gravity and complex sociopolitical structures by age five. Recommend immediate revision of species threat assessment.""



The children lined up to return to class, covered in sand, victory, and what he hoped wasn't actually war paint.



""Best recess ever!"" they cheered. ""Mr. Terry, will you do the color-changing thing again tomorrow?""



His bio-suit, finally regaining stability, produced one last rainbow sweat drop in response.

In a medium bowl, whisk together 2 cups of flour, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined.

# Step 4: Coat the Blueberries

In another bowl, toss most of the blueberries with the remaining 2 tablespoons of flour. Gently fold them into the cake batter. Save a handful of uncoated blueberries for sprinkling on top.

# Step 5: Bake the Cake

Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Sprinkle the reserved blueberries on top. Bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes before inverting onto a wire rack to cool completely.

# Step 6: Make the Glaze

In a medium bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar and lemon juice until smooth. Drizzle the glaze over the cooled pound cake, letting it cascade down the sides.

# Time to Serve!

Slice your **Lemon-Blueberry Pound Cake** and serve with tea, coffee, or a dollop of whipped cream. It‚Äôs fresh, fruity, and oh-so-irresistible!

He‚Äôs been doing the silent treatment for days after a fight where once again I asked why he won‚Äôt kiss me, have sex, pay  attention to me, etc. and then his daughter came over was visiting all weekend so I had to play like everything was normal. 

He dropped her off last night‚Ä¶ when he got home I asked if we could talk about this silent treatment thing he‚Äôs doing and he said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just get a good nights sleep and talk about it tomorrow.‚Äù

He turns me down for sex. He said he doesn‚Äôt have to say I love you everyday. He said he doesn‚Äôt have to hug or kiss me or anything everyday. Only on his terms not my terms. He said I watch too many movies that I live in a fantasy world. That couples don‚Äôt do those things everyday.

I asked him today when the last time he said o love you to me was and he said when he was on tour and I pulled out a calendar and said that was a month ago and he LAUGHED! He said ‚Äúwhy would I say it to you just because you want me to? I‚Äôll say it when I want to say it‚Äù

I‚Äôm about 25 weeks currently. Before we found out, I was planning on leaving him but everytime I tried to he would get angry and punch holes in the walls, break things, scream at me, etc.  After doing this for a while, it would turn into him sobbing on the floor and I found myself in a position where it was hard to leave. When we found out about the pregnancy, I was planning on terminating it. I‚Äôm in college, work part time. He can‚Äôt hold a job for more than a couple months. He promised he would go to therapy and he would fix his problems. This didn‚Äôt happen. He is still raging (punching walls, breaking things, etc) over very small things, things I can‚Äôt even understand because it‚Äôs so minuscule. (Example of a recent fight: I get one coffee in the morning before class and decided that day I didn‚Äôt want one.) 
My question is this: I‚Äôm going to leave him either way. I‚Äôm finishing up undergrad next year and am attending law school in a different state then where we live currently. Is there anything I could do to ensure he can‚Äôt interfere with this move without giving him full custody of the baby? I don‚Äôt trust him or his family (who I‚Äôve recently found out act the same way he does). Thanks in advance. And sorry if this was longer than needed, I‚Äôm very stressed and worried about what our future holds.

Hoping this is ends up being as therapeutic as Xanga. Or maybe the start to a long overdue book? 

Me: 35f mom to 14m (name change: Z). Long term live in partnership of 5+ years with 46m (name change: H). 

I‚Äôm not sure where to start, not that it really matters. So I guess we‚Äôll go with what‚Äôs on my mind today. 

On Halloween of this year, I was out doing last minute shopping for boo bags. Halloween has always been my most favorite. I was wrapping up my shopping as a call came through from my doorbell. The first thing I can see when the video starts, a holstered police gun. The first thing I hear, pounding on the door and my mom screaming hysterically in the background. 
I answer and begin asking if everything is okay. The officer is demanding that I open the door. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry sir, I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on? I‚Äôm not even at home?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhere are you? We need to see you immediately.‚Äù 
‚ÄúI, umm, just walked out of Ulta? Is everything okay? I can see my mom in the background. Can you please tell me what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù
Very confused look on his face. ‚ÄúWell, your mom placed a call for a well check stating that you had videos online talking about harming yourself and son and this is a very critical situation. You need to get home immediately so that we can sort this out.‚Äù 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry sir, but I‚Äôm not returning to my home with her in this state making claims like that. I understand that you are doing your job, but I‚Äôm not even sure what is happening right now.‚Äù Then proceeded with, ‚Äúplease have her at least call me and explain;‚Äù as he motioned for her to do so I grabbed his attention again over the doorbell camera to inform him of a conversation I had only had the day before with my brother. 

You see, my brother had gotten a call from my mom‚Äôs current husband 2 days before that my mom had come home very upset and shaken claiming that she saw my brother‚Äôs dad at a gas station. That he approached her for a hug, she panicked and punched him in the nose. Claiming that she even drew blood. (For context, he was extremely abusive.) However, when my brother called to check in with his dad, the incident never occurred. Matter of fact, my brother‚Äôs dad moved 3+ hours away and very rarely leaves his hidden treehouse in the mountains. And not to mention when she had called me later that next day herself, she never even brought it up. I thought it was odd, but wanted to give her a chance to talk about it on her own so I acted as if I didn‚Äôt know.
So back to the state trooper, I give him the briefest version of this as my phone begins to ring. It‚Äôs my mom. I let the officer know and take the call. 
‚ÄúGET YOUR ASS HOME RIGHT NOW. I AM SO SICK OF DEALING WITH YOUR SHIT.‚Äù
‚ÄúWoah mom. What is going on?‚Äù
‚ÄúI HAVE BEEN GETTING PHONE CALLS AND MESSAGES FROM PEOPLE ABOUT HOW YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT HURTING YOURSELF. I AM SICK OF THIS. NO ONE IS TAKING CONTROL OF THIS SITUATION SO IT IS TIME FOR ME TO STEP IN AND TAKE CONTROL OF YOU. YOU DO NOT NEED TO WORRY ABOUT Z ANY LONGER. I WILL TAKE CARE OF HIM FROM NOW ON AND FINALLY HAVE YOU COMMITTED LIKE YOU NEED.‚Äù
‚ÄúI have no idea what you are talking about. I am not coming home with you acting like that. And you will never take my son away from me.‚Äù I hang up with the resolve of a pissed off 90s kids slamming the phone into the receiver. 

This isn‚Äôt the first time she has made threats like that. 
Before he was born and I considered an abortion. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do that to me. If you don‚Äôt want it, I‚Äôll take it.‚Äù
When he was around 2/3 and I popped him across his cheek because he hit me and the gentle parenting shit wasn‚Äôt working and I was a human for an instant and reacted. His little cheek was red and swollen. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt deserve to have that sweet boy. It‚Äôs time you sign over rights before I take them from you.‚Äù 
Around 4/5, when untreated bipolar disorder had finally bubbled up so much and forced me into bipolar psychosis. ‚ÄúYou clearly cannot handle this. You need to sign over your rights.‚Äù 
Around 6/7, when I realized I was struggling with my mental health and asked for help.
And then continuing on sporadically when the world just seems a little heavy and I voice that. So I stopped voicing it so much. Until a week before Halloween I made a TikTok. Taking about the struggles of having a mental health disorder. A separate video ranting about how I just want my kid to do the damn dishes. Me, just trying to find human connection through my pain and experiences. 

So, I then have to call the school and let them know I‚Äôm on my way to get him and to please not release him to anyone else. Emergency situation going on. Calling his therapist to reschedule his appointment that we were now running late to because of this fiasco. Talked to the state trooper again since because a well check was called in so I legally have to meet with them now to prove that I am fine. 

Typically when my mom has gone a little off the handle I can hide it from my kid. Frantic phone calls and meeting with the police cannot be hidden. Not when Z is in the car for all of it. Not to mention he is approaching 15 and if you have kids then you already know they know more about things than they let on. So there was no hiding this. No making sure to preserve his and his grandmothers relationship. He saw it first hand. 

Before agreeing to meet with police, I confirm that my mother will not be told where the meeting will take place. The state trooper reassures me that it will just be himself and the county sheriff who was fielded the well check call. 
I pull in to the backside of a Dollar General parking lot to the two officers from different branches of our law enforcement. My kid is in the car. Likely reeling through emotions he still won‚Äôt talk to me about. 
‚ÄúHello ma‚Äôam,‚Äù the state trooper introduces himself and then the sheriff. And ask me to please provide them my side of events. 
I relay as much information as I can. Taking accountability for posting a TikTok talking about struggling with mental health, but also pointing out that in this one video, I repeat myself multiple times talking about how I want to live. To live as much as possible. The county sheriff said, ‚Äúit sounds like you need to set some boundaries with your mom.‚Äù 
I laughed. Probably a little too hysterically for the situation. 
‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, I know it‚Äôs hard to set boundaries with our moms, but this could really help save that relationship.‚Äù 
‚ÄúSir, I‚Äôm sorry, I realize it‚Äôs not supposed to be funny, but I am 35 years old and have been trying to set boundaries with this woman for years.‚Äù 
‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre going to have to be consistent.‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah, because that worked out so well for me today. My brother had to move 4+ hours out of state and she still tries to overstep his boundaries.‚Äù 
The state trooper steps up at this point with a sad look on his face. ‚ÄúLook, this isn‚Äôt my place and I wasn‚Äôt even supposed to be here. I just happened to be parked and saw an erratic vehicle speeding that refused to stop. I pulled in behind her at your house and she starts saying you were trying to hurt yourself. What I can tell you right now though; I don‚Äôt know your situation. I don‚Äôt know if you have the finances to or if you‚Äôre married. But if I were in your shoes, I would be moving immediately and going complete no contact. I spent less than 15 minutes with her. Hearing her and seeing her behaviors. It was triggering for me because I have similar family issues. From personal experience I can tell you that it will not get better. Put the boundaries in place the best you can and go no contact. Ultimately the decision is yours, but behavior like that doesn‚Äôt just go away.‚Äù 

I thank the officers for their time and apologize for the craziness of the whole thing. Next stop, my grandparents. Why you ask? Because in the midst of all this, my mom thought it was a good idea to call my mid 80s grandparents to be at the house too. {Reflection point: who does this? If she really thought I had harmed myself, her first thought was to contact my 84 yr old grandmother to see my lifeless body? It makes zero sense. Not to mention she never even called or texted me directly before this happened. Didn‚Äôt call/text my partner that I live with first to verify any of this before calling the police.}

Before I can feel comfortable going to see them I have to make sure that my mom won‚Äôt be around so I‚Äôm having to tell my nana to not tell her own daughter where her own daughter is. It‚Äôs  crazy that I even had (have) to think that way. My poor nana. Pure defeat and sadness all over her body. Fear. 
‚ÄúSweety, why would you say such horrible things on the internet?‚Äù 
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt. Nothing that was said about the videos was true.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, I just don‚Äôt understand how your mom could act that way for no reason. You had to have said something. I don‚Äôt know how all that internet stuff works so I don‚Äôt know what you said, but you had to have said something serious for that to happen.‚Äù
‚ÄúNana, would you like to see for yourself what was said?‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to do that.‚Äù
‚ÄúHere is the video‚Ä¶‚Äù I watched her face as she listened to me speak of the challenges of living with this illness. Smiled at the fight in my voice saying I want to live.  
‚ÄúWell this can‚Äôt be the same video. You just said you want to live. I don‚Äôt understand why your mom would act that way.‚Äù 
‚ÄúIt is the same video. There is a lot that I don‚Äôt tell you about mom because it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to you because she is your baby. But at this point she has hurt me to a point beyond repair. What she did is extremely dangerous.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThank you for sharing your side with me. I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôve never seen it before,‚Äù looking at me with heartbreak and as if she‚Äôd seen me for the first time. 

I left wondering how much has been said about me over the years that I will never know. And how much of an impression it‚Äôs made on the people she‚Äôs spoke to about me. What truths did she share? Or what fabrications and exaggerations did she add? I mean I always knew she embellished stories. Master manipulation class 101 growing up. But this. My own nana? 

Needless to say, my life has been a shitstorm since. And if you can read into the fact that I was vulnerable enough to share the struggles of depression and parenting on TikTok, then that should tell you even more about where my mental state was prior to the Halloween incident. That day was actually the first good day I had had in a long while. I woke up feeling rested and excited for a fun evening with my partner and son and friends. And then come 1pm and the entire day just turned to shit. 

The following days I attempted to hear her out and give her a chance to tell her side. All over text message so I could fact check it as I went. (Super sad, I know.) I sat with H as I asked my mom why she didn‚Äôt call him first. She said she did. I ask H to break it down. Her call came after she spoke to the police. And even on the phone with her, he told her that I was fine, but yet she insisted, telling him he needed to step aside, he doesn‚Äôt know how to handle me, she needs to take control of me. She said similar things to my brother about how she needed to take control of me. Each person I talked to, that was the common word used; control.

It‚Äôs been almost a month now. My mom has reached out multiple times with apologies that take zero responsibility. I don‚Äôt reply. My son did have a school function that I thought would be unfair of me to not share with family. So I texted the group thread between myself, nana, and mom. That was last Wednesday. The messages from her have ramped up. Asking me about my holiday plans. That Z won‚Äôt answer her texts. Links for therapists (yeah‚Ä¶.). And then today.

Phone vibrates. Message from Mom. ‚ÄúWant to get coffee and talk?‚Äù

[Copy/Paste Messages]

Me: ‚ÄúNo. I need space. Z needs space. I thought I was doing the right thing by giving you the opportunity to at least go see the show that he is so proud to be part of, but I fear I have given you the wrong impression that what happened was okay. Or that I‚Äôm somehow just over it. Or that Z is over it. I would very much appreciate if you would stop trying to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù with the therapist posts. If anything when you send them you are pouring gasoline on a steady growing flame. To be perfectly honest, I don‚Äôt know if this is something that can ever be repaired.  But for now, give me space. Give Z space. When I‚Äôm ready to actually speak to you, I will let you know.‚Äù

Mom: ‚ÄúI guess I just don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm being punished for listening to Eris (name change. Context: distant relative who called my mother making the claims of self harm videos). I swear, I thought you were actively trying to harm yourself. You have hurt me on many occasions, but I would never disown you for that. It‚Äôs like grieving a child that is still on this earth.‚Äù 
Immediately followed by: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not fair to completely push me away over a complete misunderstanding, especially since I‚Äôve advocated for you for so long. Looked past so many wrongs and loved you through it all! My heart is broken.‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúYou are not being punished. 
Learn accountability.
Your response alone only validates further that I am making the right decision for myself and my child to maintain some distance. I love you and there have been many things throughout my life that you have done to support me. Be there for me. And I appreciate you for being there. But that is your job as a parent to be there for your kid. I‚Äôm sorry you are grieving. You‚Äôre not the only one.‚Äù

She responded again only in defense of her ‚Äúlove‚Äù for me and Z. 

I feel so proud of myself for sticking up for me. For advocating for me. For saying the things that have needed to be said for a very long time. But at the same time I am feeling beyond defeated. And my heart is crushed by the weight that this grief carries.

\-Doused them in H2O2 (5%) for witch they bubbled and made the fluid a deep rusty red. 

\-waited for 2 days then added pure vinegar (roughly 10% of the fluid was vinegar when I was done)

\-waited 5 more days then added more H2O2 (as some had evaporated) and added a ton of salt.

\-waited a month, adding H2O2 and vinegar as it evaporated, adding a little salt when I saw the nails stop bubbling

\-After that, I took the solution and put it through a double layered coffee filter (using gravity) when I was done 2-3 days later, I had this clay like dark red clump at the top of the filter, and a clear red solution in the bottom.

\-I then over a month waited for the fluid to evaporate naturaly, and these clear almost perfectly square crystals formed.

  
I want to know what the clay like red stuff is, aswell as what the clear crystals are. if anyone knows, Id like to know. Im hopeing the crystals are some iron salt.",1,1732561116.0,InorganicChemistry,1,1.0,False

Sometimes, I've got leftover coffee, and need to find something to do with it. In summer, I might make ice cubes for iced coffee, but it's too cold where I am right now to do that. I have also been known to replace some or all of the liquid in a boxed cake mix with leftover coffee, but I didn't have any on hand, and it wasn't on sale at the store. So here's what I came up with, and I thought I'd share in case someone else might like it.

Coffee Beverage

400mL cold coffee

100mL dates (see instructions)

milk of choice

Add coffee to a measuring jug. Add dates until the level of liquid equals 500. Allow this to sit overnight. I do room temp, but if it's especially hot, I might do it in the fridge.

After soaking, blend the coffee and dates until smooth, using either a conventional blender or an immersion blender.

Pour half of this mixture into a mug, and add milk of choice to taste. Stir well.

Enjoy!

I need some advice about a situation in my relationship that's been weighing on me. I‚Äôve been dating an amazing girl for four months now, and everything seemed perfect at first. We clicked instantly, and one of the main things that attracted me to her was her traditional values. She doesn‚Äôt have many close guy friends, which I appreciated, and we agreed that I‚Äôd take care of everything financially when we get married. We‚Äôve been progressing really fast, with both of our parents knowing about us, and we‚Äôve even gone on vacation together and planned a couple more.
She‚Äôs been incredibly loving, respectful, and attentive, and I‚Äôm proud to be with her. But here‚Äôs where things started to get complicated.
On our last vacation, I noticed something that made me uneasy. She got a message from an ex-colleague (a guy) who sent her a reel, and it turned out she had been sending reels to him as well. We had an understanding that there wouldn‚Äôt be any guy friends while we were together, and this didn‚Äôt sit well with me.
Now, before you label me insecure, let me explain: I made my expectations clear from the start. I take care of her in every way, financially and emotionally, and when we went on vacation, I paid for everything‚Äîflights, hotels, meals, you name it. That‚Äôs just how I am in relationships, and I wanted her to understand that I expect her to respect the boundaries we set.
When I confronted her about the guy, she deleted her Instagram, which had a lot of guys on it that she‚Äôd met for casual coffee dates. She did this to respect my feelings, and I appreciated it. But there was still another issue that came up: she had been chatting with another guy who she had history with, even while we were together. This made me feel betrayed. I had removed everyone from my life, and I expected her to do the same, but she hadn‚Äôt. In the moment, I wanted to break up, but I assumed it was out of innocence on her part‚Äîshe didn‚Äôt realize how serious it was for me.
We had a lot of heated arguments, but in the end, she apologized, and we decided to move past it.
Now, here‚Äôs where things stand. We‚Äôre back to being long-distance, and anytime she‚Äôs unavailable for a few hours, my mind automatically goes to the worst-case scenario: Is she talking to some guy I don‚Äôt know?
She has a group of friends, some of whom are guys, and I‚Äôm okay with that because I know who they are. But it‚Äôs the guys I don‚Äôt know that make me uncomfortable, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm alone in feeling that way. I‚Äôve been wanting to ask her for reassurance‚Äîthat she‚Äôs not talking to any guy friends I don‚Äôt know‚Äîbut I‚Äôm worried she might get offended. We‚Äôve talked about this before, and she‚Äôs apologized, so I don‚Äôt want to make her feel like I don‚Äôt trust her.
I‚Äôm really struggling with whether I should just trust her and let it go, or if I should bring it up one more time to make sure we‚Äôre on the same page. Our families are involved now, and we‚Äôve got another vacation coming up that I‚Äôm paying for, so the stakes feel higher.
It‚Äôs honestly a really uncomfortable situation to be in, and I don‚Äôt know what to do.


TL;DR: My girlfriend and I have had some trust issues regarding her communication with other guys. I want to ask her for reassurance, but I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôll be offended and think I don‚Äôt trust her. Should I let it go, or ask for reassurance one last time?

My partner lost his temper, started yelling/screaming at me, and threw a steak knife into the sink","Not sure if I'm overreacting because of how much this has upset me and the massive fight that ensued after he acted like this. Basically what happened is this:

My partner and I are long-distance, I live with my family normally but I flew a long distance to see him for a few weeks. I barely got any sleep last night, had to wake up after sleeping 3 hrs to do a virtual meeting, and barely had time to prepare myself any breakfast. After I was dead tired, with a migraine, and feeling terrible (I have a chronic health condition). We planned to go to coffee afterwards and I was pretty out of it and had to finish some graduate coursework, so I was delayed in getting ready and kept him waiting. I apologized for making him wait, but he was extremely mad. He started talking disrespectfully to me for keeping him late and then got angry with me because I left the cutting board and knife in the sink (I normally clean up after myself, but this time I was dead tired and did not have time/feel up to cleaning the cutting board/knife).

He started talking about how inconsiderate, selfish, and disrespectful I am and I told him that he was being disrespectful and rude to me. He did not like me confronting him, so he started yelling/screaming at me, and eventually pounded his fists on the counter and threw the steak knife in the sink. He has some anger issues and has yelled, screamed, insulted me, and thrown things multiple times -- each time, he will apologize after, admit it's wrong, and then promise not to do it again/refrain from doing it for a period of time, while begging me to forgive him. I told him how much I hate it when he throws things around. He's smashed his phone, thrown a broom (making it break), thrown a trash can lid (causing it to be dented), and pounded his fists on the table/wall. He has never thrown anything at me or hit me, but I've told him that I hate it when he behaves this way because it's intimidating and unnerving for me.

I walked out of the house after he did this and stayed away (in a coffee shop) for 4 hours. The whole time, my heart was beating out of my chest, I was so anxious/upset that I couldn't think straight. He said he would apologize when I returned.

Tomlan Game Studios is a (very) small indie game development company, set up by me (Tomlan) - a lover of a wide variety of games from D&D to Increlution. Legacy Looper is my first title and is an incremental, text-based strategy looper/prestige game where you level up attributes, defeat monsters and leave legacies to improve the skills of future adventurers. You can see the trailer and screenshots on the Steam page.

  
I aim to release the game in March 2025, in a completed, bug-free state (as much as is humanly possible!). No early-access builds that you have to wait ages to get the bugs fixed on. When you pay for the game, you get the whole game - no microtransactions either... ever!

To do this, we are currently running a 100-person closed-Beta to make sure all the wrinkles are ironed out before launch.

  
Legacy Looper's price tag is approximately the price of a cup of coffee - $3.99/¬£3.39.

  
If you like the look of it, please add it to your Wishlist on Steam to be notified of updates/release.

Our staff went from 4 fully trained baristas, with the addition of a kid who can do all the tasks but make coffee, to 3 baristas plus the kid because one of my coworkers was arrested for indecent exposure and is no longer going to be on service. 

This all happened very suddenly and forced us all to make adjustments. The main adjustment being that one barista is stuck working an 8+ hour shift a couple days a week with the kid who can't make coffee. This means no breaks for the barista. We already didn't get our two 10 minute breaks, but it went from that to no lunch break either. I struggle with a chronic pain condition so breaks are essential for me. We are legally owed them, but it feels like asking for special accommodations just to take them.

My boss was leaving to go abroad for 2 weeks in a couple days so I went to her and explained that I can no longer work as a solo barista because that means no breaks and I just can't physically and mentally keep it up. She said ok and adjusted the schedule. 

I thought everything was going to improve from there, but a couple days go by and one of my coworkers calls in sick, with no plans to cover their shift. This meant I would be by myself from 6AM-4PM with no break. I told my boss that I was not ok with that. She made attempts to find someone to help me and even went so far as to suggest the coworker who exposed himself in public, which I obviously shut down. I told her I would stay until 12 and she accepted that, but she worked herself up so much that she decided to shut down the business for the 2 weeks she's away.

With this being such a small town, everyone was in shock about the decision to suddenly close up shop and I feel that because I set a boundary for my health, that I'm being treated like the bad guy here.",91,1732559567.0,AITAH,105,0.93,False

This year, my IMAM Exchange match was none other than the incomparable u/poxteeth, someone whose posts and insights on IMAM and elsewhere long held my respect and appreciation. What can I say? She's an amazing person sharing similar tastes to mine with her own distinctive style and flair that set an incredibly high bar to meet for wrapping gifts, let me tell you. ;)

I've enjoyed our regular conversations about scents and life, and she brings such a creative perspective to the world. This exchange brought so many wonderful chats throughout the day and someone I can declare -- much like u/hedgiecake said of her partner -- knows me probably better than I know myself. She introduced me to lesser-known houses or retread some of the first indie parfumiers in this fascinating journey. Seriously -- the level of thought and care in this parcel demonstrates how well she knows her art and indie maker community. It's inspired me to branch out and haunt some of my broader marketplaces, for one, and ask why no beekeeper/honey maker in my area sells less than 24 ounce jars of the stuff. For real.

Words aren't enough to adequately convey my gratitude for the incredibly thoughtful gifts and discoveries made along the way, as well as those delicious bonbons that didn't survive more than a day. We tried. We really tried.

This exchange covered a lot and I'm trying to touch on the highlights or it will resemble a dissertation:

* **Splendiferous Ravens**: This sumptuous art card matches the ravens speckled around my great room. The raven candle was extraordinary!
* **Coffin Clutches**: For real, she packed the full-size perfumes and a heap of samples in these black coffins that are to die for.
* **Gewgaws**: The pumpkin candles! The giant raven candle! The sparkly, whimsically icky bugs hidden away and an exciting spider wrapped around a serpentine drink shaker. And the **Grim Steeper,** stolen by my kiddo for tea, while I retained the delightful **cat bottle stopper**. The additions tucked in were seriously Christmas morning.
* **Chocolate**: Oracle chocolates (The Magician), Endangered Species chocolate (Cinnamon, Cayenne, and Cherry 60% dark), homemade chocolate lavender bonbons that were \*incredible\*. u/poxteeth is a baker and it shows!

**Honey**: I need to call out several of the honeys tucked in here because they're truly to die for. Bright Raven Farms and Apiary does not know what they unleashed. Sweet, flavourful, sylvan in the best way, White Pine honey needs to be eaten with a spoon guiltily on the greyest days. Never in my life have I tasted any honey as good as this and their gift set moved to my top holiday gift. Waiting for more White Pine will be undoubtedly the hardest thing.

August Teas has found my name and number, and clearly created two of these just for me. Innsbruck and Breathless are being carefully rationed until the full-sizes come in. Poxteeth showed \*so\* much consideration in these selections, finding flavour combinations that we'd discussed as favourites but in the most innovative blends. Mmm. I'm set for the cold season with some great options.

* **A Field in Innsbruck**: blackcurrant, juniper, honey, spruce
* **Avalon**: baked apples, burnt caramel, petrichor
* **Breathless**: armagnac, dried plum, dark cherry, whipped cream
* **The Library**: buttered toast, brown bread, almond
* **Silencio**: ripe pineapple, black pepper, cocoa bean

**Azura's Alchemy Lab, tea samples**

If these aren't the sweetest fandom products, I'll eat my hat. My little one is desperate to get his hands on Baggins' Apple Pie and I look forward to sampling these. So far I've only sniffed them to save 'em for December's grey, dark days. Moving Castle Brew smells like heaven to me. The almond and saffron are something special!

* **Tom Bombadil's Herbal Tea:** Green Rooibos, Carrot, Apples, Lemon balm, Zest and Orange
* **Baggins' Apple Pie**: Rooibos, Roasted apple pieces, Cinnamon and Vanilla.
* **Spriggan's Grove Burgeons:** Beautiful combo of pear, mangosteen, mango and green tea
* **Evening Tea with Argonian Maid**: Sencha green tea, Lung Ching green tea, horsetail, nettle, pineapple, orange peel, freeze-dried blueberry and cane sugar.
* **Moving Castle Brew:** Black tea, Candied Almonds, Cinnamon, Saffron

**Megan's Marvelous Medicinals, historical spice blends**

Poxteeth is the real baker here, and I'm the... less good at it food-maker. These, however, lift the game. We've gone gaga for the Roman Imperial blend in some recent cooking. They are generous bags and smell so good. Nordic Warming Blend needs me to find just the perfect mix -- probably a magical cake of some kind -- and I'm open to suggestions!

* **Viking Blend:** organic dill, organic ground fennel seed, organic ground brown mustard seed, grains of paradise, organic clove
* **Nordic Warming Blend:** organic cardamom, organic cinnamon, organic mace, grains of paradise, organic clove
* **Roman Imperial Blend**: organic marjoram, organic summer savory, organic ground coriander seed, organic ground white pepper

**Food!**

We both have a strong passion for hot sauces with rich flavour profiles. It was a joy to receive these two special additions, and a \*\*lavender syrup\*\* being liberally drizzled into my London Fog tea lattes. Fun fact, London Fogs originated in my hometown!

* **Mojo's Sauce, Sunshine Carrot**: The tropical fruit flavors of Locally Grown Scotch Bonnet Peppers blended with Fresh Lemongrass Juice, Ginger Juice, and Organic roasted Carrots -- This stuff is sunshine in a bottle. Went beautifully with some Thai noodle salad for dinner and it's killer drizzled with an eggs benny combo.
* **Earthquake Spices, Sun Burst**: Sun Burst is truly a Savory blend of Heat, from Scotch Bonnet Peppers, and the Tangy taste of lemon with a sweetness brought on by the pineapples -- Ahhh, so *vibrant*. Finding lots of places to pair it, chicken has been spot on.

**Perfumes**

I'll preface this by saying it's going to take me a \*while\* to get through all these splendid creations. I have sniffed a good many of them and tried to come up with a prioritization strategy.

Wylde Ivy has an unheard of 100% hit rate for me. That's just how it went. Midnight Dreary made a difficult grey day sing, but Lost Lenore and An Agony of Desire last all day and transport me to a seaside New England cafe, curled up with a cup of tea and a very good book to while away a few hours. An exceptionally satisfying sample set.

**Wylde Ivy, A Midnight Dreary Deluxe Sample Set**

* **A Midnight Dreary**: The warm and utterly addicting scent of a dark Victorian study, worn leather chairs, guttering candle light, forgotten coffee, books warmed by low fire, and rain on the window panes. **Incredible.**
* **An Agony of Desire**: Bright bergamot and mandarin soaked with crushed plums and pierced with pink peppercorns all encircled with faint tendrils of incense smoke. **Bergamot and plum are favourite notes. I'm FSing this one the first chance I get.**
* **Lost Lenore:** A demure and ethereal fragrance that is all romance and femininity.  Notes of plump pink roses just beginning to hand their heads, fading love letters, ambergris, dried heather, and white amber sugar. **Another 5/5. Throw is sensational, the scents are so well blended.**
* **The Moon Never Beams:** A pale and haunting blend of split vanilla beans, tonka infused cream, vanilla sugar musk, and just a whisper of vanilla orchids. **White gossamer and mystery. It clings to the skin.**
* **The Kingdom by the Sea**: The fragrance of salt sprayed stone, sun bleached cedarwood, black amber resin, flowering wood sage, and sweet dune grass. **As I was in Cape Cod the week this arrived, I can tell you it's spot-on for the North Atlantic coast, a sparkling dream of dark memories.**
* **Bonus sample: In Love with Melancholy:** Notes of crushed vanilla beans, aged cedarwood, port stained parchment, and slumbering fireplace embers. **I'm in love with** ***it***\*\*. A rare situation where smoke doesn't amp on my skin!\*\*

**Deep Midnight, Custom Sample Set**

One of my first houses and a favourite. We both purchased from Deep Midnight and seriously, what's not to love? Boudica was guaranteed to be a favourite, in no small part because I love my namesake note and mead. Elspeth and Onyx is everything it's cracked up to be, blending two very unexpected notes into a juicy melange of pumpkin and blackberry. Oh does it work. It works so well. Deep Midnight's fruit notes are spectacular, and Grimalkin was stolen by my kid to sniff at during homework time as a pick-me-up, so take that as a recommendation. It's really good.

* **Grimalkin:** Butter rum, pumpkins, cream, leaves, mocha coffee, earth and dried currants
* **Elspeth & Onyx:** Sweet Pumpkin, Sugared Black Amber, Blackberries, Oakwood, Cedarwood, Dark Chocolate
* **Haunted Hayride**: Pumpkins, Roasted Marshmallows, Candy, Soft Hay, Frankincense
* **Agnes In the Shadow:** Pear, Raspberry, Coconut Milk, Tomato Leaf\*\*. Surprisingly complex with the tomato leaf adding some wet greenery to the warm pear and singing raspberry.\*\*
* **Boudica**: Honey mead, highland heather, roasted grains, firewood, leather, fog and forest. **Looove it.**
* **Making Biscuits**: bread, sugar, fire, pumpkin, cardamom\*\*. A cozy autumn scent that snuggles close to the skin.\*\*

**Press Gurwitz perfume, No. 14**: Warm and rich blend with accents of vanilla, cardamon and pine

* This is a new house for me and it's a beautiful example of simplicity and elegance in action. Their ginger and cardamom notes in No 5 and No 14 dance on my skin. No 14 is really delightful as the woodsiness doesn't become anything close to PineSol. It feels like and encompassing, a little bit like **Forest Cat from Poesie**.

**Possets, Asmodeus:** Deepest pumpkin, brightest suave French lavender, and a thrill of cardamom, light skin musk

* Today's scent and boy, does it deliver. The musk is surprisingly chocolatey on me, but I'm digging how the cardamom and pumpkin play together. They almost create a cocoa note that's vaguely boozy. Sleek and clean, this lavender isn't dusty (a problem for me with many lavs) and it's a right devil. Debauched, an adult gourmand that's sexy and inviting, not overpowering.

**Possets, Lovechild Gingerbaby:** fresh ginger nestled on a soft bed of pear and pure Madagascar vanilla

* A sniff of this for ginger and pear felt like pulling over a cozy blanket. It's truly one of those scents that envelopes you in comfort.

**Cirrus Parfum, It's Just Pears:** A fresh, juicy, slightly overripe and musky Bartlett pear - spiked with brandy over a honeyed amber base

* A decadent scent that runs close to the skin for me. I'm a pear-lover (Arcana **Anthropophagia** is my gold standard; **Wandering Star** stands out in this field too). It's Just Pears delivers on that with quiet throw and a juicy golden finish. It's not nearly as in-my-face as Anthropophagia, which makes it an excellent choice for the office and busy places. I'm all about honey and pears. Mmm. This one really has a pretty finish.

**Debaucherous Alchemy, Pumpkin Regal Whipped Soap**: Sweet golden pumpkin puree, liquid red amber, autumnal spices, sweet cream, juicy apricots, wild honey

https://preview.redd.it/znw04oq1c33e1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=492a8694e4e641c1e30154457f48b56f624c84dc

**Decants:**

* **Alkemia, An Autumn Wandering**: sweet maple wood, black currant, damson, garnetberry, charred rosemary, lemon verbena, japanese pumpkin, madagascar vanilla, tonka, and sunwarmed oak leaves
* **Alkemia, Salome: Queen of the Night**, black grapes, plums, skin musk, cognac, bitter orange, crushed vanilla, tonka bean, sandalwood, vetiver, cedar, and red oud
* **Cocoa Pink, Genevieve:** sweet milk, bourbon vanilla, sandalwood, burning sage & smoke
* **Cocoa Pink, Witches Delight:** Soft buttery vanilla cookies dusted with orange and black sugar, fresh cranberries, blood orange oil, dark brown sugar, Turkish mocha whipped with shards of bitter almond, roasted hazelnuts tempered with a cool blast of iced vanilla. **We're really lucky I can't eat this perfume because I damn near did. What on earth magic is this?**
* **Sorce, Serpentine**: Ripe figs, fig leaf, cardamom, caramelized honey, vanilla, Peru balsam, Cedar, Iso E Super **Fig has swiftly become a favourite food and scent. Serpentine does dangerous things with a honeyed fig, enough I ran out to the store to get one. Then sniffed my arm, the fruit, and decided the perfume is better. This feels like being Cleopatra or Zenobia, feasting on fresh decadence.**
* **Sorce, Venus in Fleurs:** ripe mango, carnivorous plants, humidity, jasmine sambac absolute, vanilla absolute
* **Pineward, Noki: l**ychee, mango, mint, rhubarb, cassis, sandalwood, ambergris
* **Pineward, Hayloft:** hay, lavender honey, crocus, sweet vernal grass, bison grass, toasted almond, hazelnut, oats, dusty wheat.
* **Solstice Scents, Devil's Millhopper**: heather, fern, spring-fed waterfall, new spring leaves, earth, oak, wild violet, coumarin. **Of course I wanted desperately to try this one for my name and the sniff alone tells me we're going to be very good friends.**
* **Debaucherous Alchemy, Coyote Red**: bamboo, cypress, night blooming orange blossoms, moroccan rose, desert willow, chaparral, red amber, mysore and smoky vanilla
* **Wylde Ivy, Fireborn:** black cocoa powder, crushed tonka beans, ambrette seeds, roasted coffee, dewy vanilla beans, crystallized amber, dried orange peel, with a hint of woodsmoke

**Random samples:**

Most of these samples I'm rationing to start December with as I go through my silly, overstuffed collection and curate more thoughtfully. I love starting with new things (hello, I'm a magpie) and the Debaucherous Alchemies are just what I need to set off a crazy month with the right note. Dreamy, moody, intense, cozy, and passionate -- that's what they can provide. Of course, i couldn't help myself...

* **Debaucherous Alchemy, Haunted Honey**: Decades' Old Dark Honey, foraged from Ancient Oaks, and Cypress, White Carnation, Dark Fruits, Black Amber, Beeswax Absolute and a dab of Labdanum.
* **Debaucherous Alchemy, Buttermilk Nectar:** Apricot, Mango Nectar, Butterscotch, Milk, Wildflower Honeycomb
* **Debacherous Alchemy, Veil:** Santal, Pinyon Pine, White Sage, Dense Fog, Black Roses, Orange Blossom, Silkwood, English Lavender, Golden Amber, Smoky Oud,  Sandalwood, Dark Musk, Ghostly White Heirloom Pumpkins and whispers Autumnal Spices.
* **Pineward, Mint Cocoa**: prototype, no notes
* **Possets, Churpz**: Sweet gourmand, no notes
* **Press Gurwitz, No. 4**: bergamot, sea salt, fig, and musk
* **Press Gurwitz, No. 5**: ginger, verbena, and vanilla. **See my notes above for #10, but this one makes verbena and ginger sing together. A total eye-opener of a scent in the best ways.**
* **Wylde Ivy, The Lure of the Lights:** Vanilla mist, white woods, warm rice milk, almond flower, wild heliotrope, and just the barest hint of white spices
* **Wylde Ivy, Sugar Rose:** delicate rosewater, moist raw sugar cane, and whipped vanilla with just a touch of wildflower honey and tropical fruit nectar
* **Wylde Ivy, Idyia**: Neroli blossoms steeped in vanilla infused sugar water with a touch of twilight amber and a drizzle of wildflower honey. **I bought this FS for Poxteeth and nearly bought a FS for myself. It's stunning. The vanilla and neroli may be the epitome of a slightly oceanic summer-to-autumn transitional. I could wear it whenever.**
* **Wylde Ivy, Thaleia:** delicate rosewater, moist raw sugar cane, and whipped vanilla with just a touch of wildflower honey and tropical fruit nectar

I've written a great deal here, but I genuinely cannot than u/poxteeth enough for her sublime friendliness, many great conversations, and sparkling wit. She is a gem that made my 2024 to know and befriend, and that embodies the spirit of the IMAM Autumn Exchange so well. Thank you to her and the other organizers for making this possible and building community. I'm still learning the intricacies of presentation and finding the perfect gift (crossing one province and four states to do that was fun as I explored!) and she's been such a fantastic partner in raven crimes.

¬†

The Celestial realm, Deep inside the Great Library, in a Meeting room‚Ä¶

41^(st) of Anael, the first month of snow.

Just after Midnight

¬†

Discussion had dragged on for hours as Maxwell and some dozen lesser and small gods worked deep into the night on ways to find and eliminate, or if needs must recapture the rogue elemental.

‚ÄúIt would help if we knew what kind of elemental it was.‚Äù One small god, who was also just small, said in frustration as it paced across the table on stubby legs while sipping coffee from a thimble. ‚ÄúIf we could determine the type we are dealing with, it would make things easier.‚Äù

‚ÄúJudging by the imprisonment location, I would hazard the guess that it is either air or fire.‚Äù Another small god replied.

Max looked up from yet another research book, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been down this road before, Lemon, Greg.‚Äù

The small small god glared at Max, ‚ÄúMy name is-‚Äù

‚ÄúLemon.‚Äù Max stretched. ‚ÄúYour given name is three sentences long, and more descriptive than most High Elves‚Äô names.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine. Heretic.‚Äù Lemon declared. ‚ÄúI was thinking that making a dedicated finding artifact would work best-‚Äù

‚ÄúWe already discussed that as well.‚Äù A slim, log/rock/vine god said.

‚ÄúWould you all let me finish?!? Please?!?‚Äù Lemon nearly screamed. ‚ÄúI mean, I know I‚Äôm small, but I‚Äôm not stupid!‚Äù

The rest of the gods fell silent.

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù Lemon sighed. ‚ÄúNow, a dedicated finding artifact as they are *currently* made can only find a single type of item, and ‚Äúelemental‚Äù is too broad for our purposes. What I was thinking was a compound, sliding scale item similar to the one that Bjorn is testing so he can find his bladed projects in his back shed.‚Äù

The room went quiet. Some of the gods didn‚Äôt even breathe. Then the uproar started.

City of Dragon, Snows Provence, Kingdom of Garthia

It contracted its growing body, retrieving long tentacles of itself from the throats of its food. *Hmm. This food had names. Jacob, Penelopy, and Jason. I wonder if I should eat food with names? Doesn‚Äôt matter, I need to grow.* Using newfound strength from the young food, raising the window and oozing down the side of the house was easy.

\-

The Celestial Realm

Max and Lemon wandered down the street to Bjorn‚Äôs forge. When they knocked on the door and got no answer, Lemon began to walk away, but Max smiled and pulled the door open, stepping in.

Lemon gasped, eyes going wide, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just going to break in and steal his item?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you mean ‚ÄúThe Strategic Transfer of Equipment to Alternate Locals‚Äù, then yes.‚Äù Max smiled, ‚ÄúIf you mean ‚ÄúTheft‚Äù, then no. I leave theft to the governments of the world, as they don‚Äôt like the competition.‚Äù

Lemon slumped. ‚ÄúFine. I‚Äôll stand watch in case anyone decides to be offended.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood.‚Äù Max meandered into the old forge and began searching for the item in question.

Three hours, a face full of coal powder, and a nail in his boot later, Max stumbled out of the forge. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt find it.‚Äù

Lemon looked up from a bench across the street from the forge, ‚ÄúOkay. Guess we will have to ask him in the morning. I suggest we head to bed.‚Äù

Max grunted assent, and departed.

\-

It lay in the gutter below the window. *I think I need a name. How about Benny? No, doesn‚Äôt sound right. Walter White? No, that leaves a cloud of something in the air.* *~~Frank Castle? No~~**. Kim? Nope. Joseph? No. Karl? No. Hugo? No. Maxwell? No. Hmm‚Ä¶ I suppose I will find a name somewhere else‚Ä¶ Brick? Maybe‚Ä¶* It rolled down the gutter, then across a street and into an unguarded basement. *I should decorate this place. A couple of throw pillows, and maybe a news reporter? What‚Äôs a news reporter?*

Yup, Late and short. There will be a new one on Thursday (Thanksgiving day in the USA). Florida has been a blast, but my pasty white ass should not be sunburned in the middle/end on November (Remember, north of the equator means cold from October to March)!

I got almost all of my Florida bucket list checked off: Swam in ocean, Fished (successfully) in the ocean, went on a fishing cruise, Saw the Everglades, Saw a gator in the wild, road a swamp boat. The only things missing are: Hunting Iguana and Wild Hog. :(

Mom Listen and I visited/saw: Blowing Rocks Preserve, The Jupiter Inlet Lighthouse and Museum, a lot of the inter-coastal waterway, Mar-a-lago (from the road; its over hyped). Maybe if I start one of those new-fangled Facebook Pages, I will post pictures and stuff there...

Everything is lined up for this Sunday's Twitch Stream @ 8pm CST (UTC‚àí06:00) (Monday @ 2AM UTC ).

Last year I didn't train hard enough and crashed out at mile 16 and was deep into the pain cave for the rest of the race. Tired legs and nausea. Knowing this, I spent 2024 as the year iwas going to make amends for that and do my best to conquer this course. This included upping my training and racing schedule. I got a PR half in Atlantic City in April with a 1:25 time, ran a 1:02 at the Broad Street 10 miler, and a 3:11 full in June on a much more difficult course (imo). 2 weeks prior to this marathon I ran an 18:50 5k and a 1:08 10 miler at the Rocky Run and finished top 100 in the Mount Drago climb.  I was feeling so confident going into this race as I had my plan in place and felt like I did perfect amount of work for myself including hitting over 1,400 miles total earlier this month. 

Pre-race

Up at 4:10 am I had my usual pre-race breakfast of overnight oats and coffee (to get things moving) and relaxed and stretched before my Uber arrived, not wanting to take the subway and then walk in the cold for a mile.  I made it to the porta lines, got in and checked my bag with enough time to spare.  I also randomly met a first time marathoner who was also shooting for a 3:00 time while walking to the bag check and wound up hanging out and running with him for the first half of the race (more on that later). Got to my corral without a rush and was ready to go. 

Race

The first 13 miles could not have gone better for me. I was cruising and the guy I was running with was a great person to talk to and we kept eachother motivated and in the zone. Not pushing too hard and making sure we attacked hills and keeping eachother honest. We picked up one other runner around mile 6.5 but dropped him at around mile 8.5 before the zoo when he had to stop for a gel. We did pick up someone else who was going for a 3:00 time as well at about the same time and it was great to have 2 people there to help pace and motivate eachother. We felt good coming out of the mile 9 hill and again when we came over the mil 12 hill before turning on Girard Ave and into the second half of the race.  Then it all fell apart for me.

I had timed my gels for every 30 minutes and made sure I was taking gels I was used to and comfortable with eating. As we made the turn to reservoir drive from mile 13 I ripped open by gel and noticed that the entire top had come off. If you've ever eaten a gel you know that you gotta take it slowly, but in my haste is chugged the whole gel and wound up with too much in my mouth at once. I coughed trying to swallow and got most of it in my windpipe and I had to pull over, losing my 2 friends I just made. I dealth with a coughing attack, most of the gel coming out through my nose and a whole lot of snot. I reached for the spare tissue I had but it must of fallen out of my bag earlier without me noticing. I had to figure outhow to continue on while clearning out my nose and getting the gel that was stuck in my throat and nasal passages. Miraculously I was able to continue without stopping but I could sense somthing was up with my body after that. 

I hit mile 16 on Kelly drive and knew something was up, my stomach was not in the right place. Too much sucking down snot from my gel mishap and a wave of nausea hit me like a brick.  Knowing I couldnt give it 100% I slowed my pace down and trucked along.  Without my running buddies I was left to my own mind for the next 2-ish hours. Being passed didn't help as I couldnt find someone to run with, and those I did pass were nursing injuries and I wasn't going to ask if they needed a partner to run with, knowing they might need a minute or were going to drop. So I pushed on and entered the pain cave. I saw my friends pass me between mile 19 and 20, still one pace for their 3:00 goal and yelled encouragement to them.

Coming out of Manayunk I was down bad: nauseaus, depressed, and in physical pain. With no one to talk to I crawled along and cried a little between miles 24 and 25. The only solaces in the last mile were having my friend grab me on boathouse row and hug m and give me enouragement to push on. Honestly if I had that the whole second half i think this race would have been different for me. As we cleared boathouse row I yelled (or encouraged lol) 2 people who had stopped to walk, telling them to keep going and push. I was so happy to see both of them beat me and one hugged me and we thanked each other for the extra push at the end because we all need that in these types of events. 


Post-race

Licking my wounds I reluctantly grabbed my snacks and tried to find a place to relax and keep warm. I ate what I could and started walking back to the subway, realizing an uber might be a better option for me at this time and called one about halfway into my walk. 

I made it home in one piece and posted on socials about the race and my personal failure only to be reaached out to by friends and people whom i've never met on threads to offer words of encouragement. It takes the sting out of the day and gives me new perspective. I know I'll attempt this again next year. For now, I'll just focus on trying to walk up steps in the meantime.

I recently tried to do some hormone testing and my DHEA came back high. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve been particularly stressed as I‚Äôve been unable to work, and I don‚Äôt think I have a single symptom of pcos. I‚Äôm wondering if this could be an adrenal issue because I have to sleep a lot, like 10-12 hours a night. I‚Äôve found that 15+ hours of sleep is the only thing that allows me to have a normal day. I have also found while drinking electrolytes that salt energizes me, almost like coffee. There are other small things I could potentially relate to adrenals issues, but I‚Äôd like a physicians opinion. I‚Äôm so tired of being exhausted and it‚Äôs been very difficult to find an answer, I‚Äôve found a few potential issues but adrenals have always been a question mark for me",0,1732558381.0,AskDocs,2,0.5,False
