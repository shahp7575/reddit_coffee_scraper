Didn't plan, just went to sleep too tired to eat. Next day did not feel hunger at all, just drank water and black coffee. Today the same, not hungry at all, it's weird. Starting to feel a bit lethargic but maybe it's in my head only.

I made myself an electrolyte drink (says it has 7 calories), hope it won't break my fast. 

I don't know, should I drink it or just take some salt and water?

Anyway, goal is 5 days, mainly for autophagy and general system reset.

Any advice?

However, in the past week or two I have been waking up at ~4am every day and have trouble getting back to sleep. I wake up and almost feel like I'm ready to start the day until I look at the clock. Before this I would maybe wake up once in the night to pee but then I can fall asleep right after. Now I struggle to get back to sleep.

My prescription refill was late, so I missed a dose earlier this week and slept like a baby to my alarm, so I know its the progesterone. 

Has anyone else dealt with this, and do you have suggestions how to deal with it? Does it get better on its own? I'm thinking maybe I should take it in the morning instead since it doesn't make me drowsy but I don't want the effects of my morning coffee to get rid of it too quickly...",1,1766074491.0,asktransgender,0,1.0,False
1ppus87,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1ppus87/my_roommate_drives_me_crazy/,My roommate drives me crazy,"Let me preface this rant by saying, I know the solution to my problem is communication and setting healthy boundaries. I am in the process of healing my fearful avoidant behaviors and I haven’t always set boundaries in a healthy way. I am trying to protect myself from sabotaging another relationship in my life by avoiding a confrontation without the proper tools to communicate in a regulated way. I can’t afford (financially and emotionally) to mishandle this situation and risk upsetting the living arrangement.


I’m not going to pretend I am perfect, and I know everyone has quirks that make cohabitation a chore. Some people aren’t meant to be living together. Where that becomes a challenge is when 2 people who are not compatible pair up out of necessity to ease financial burdens. We both have slightly dysfunctional personalities and I can say for myself that I have ruined most of my connections because of my intensity and confrontational attitude. I’m pretty much out of options and have to rationalize accepting the evil I know over the evil I don’t (living with a totally unknown stranger or accepting a greater financial burden for more independence).


All that said, I can’t figure out where my controlling personality ends and my roommates lack of respect begins. I’ll start with the easiest complaint that is absolutely justified. He leaves his used floss and qtips all over the bathroom. In the shower, on the sink, on the shelf above the toilet. It’s disgusting and I feel like I have gone so long without addressing it that it would be strange to take issue with it now. He is ultimately a messy and disorganized person. He hoards dirty dishes in his room, he leaves cabinets and the trash lid open, doesn’t wipe counters after making messes (most of the time), leaves greasy and dirty hand prints everywhere (he works on his car a lot), forget helping with any of the deep cleaning I attempt to do (I gave up on regular cleaning routines a while ago). He buys car parts online and just leaves a stack of packages next to the door or copper pipes that he jacked from work in the living room, even though we have plenty of storage space to keep this stuff out of common living space. His nicotine pouches are all over the place mainly the laundry area in the basement. He takes his shoes off in the doorway and leaves them there so I end up tripping over them or have to move them out of my way to come in the apartment. I brought most of the amenities into the apartment and my cups started disappearing, it turns out he had been taking them into work because he didn’t have a clean travel mug for his coffee and has been loosing them by doing so. He makes much more money than I do and uses my condiments and spices (I initially offered them to him because I was trying to be selfless but I now resent him for helping himself and behaving so thoughtlessly in other areas). We are also in a passive aggressive battle over the thermostat. I prefer 68° in my living space, last winter he would crank it to 72°, I would drop it to 70° to compromise. This winter he kept going to 74° and I keep dropping it to 70° again. I also choose to recycle and compost, he doesn’t believe in those efforts, that’s fine with me, I just focus on keeping my side of the street clean. But yesterday without saying anything, he just throws the box we have been using to collect recycling into the dumpster as if we haven’t been using it for almost 2 years. It was like a “f-u I’m not gonna let you recycle anymore.”. He tries to engage with me every time we are in the same room together which I recognize is a pleasant way to be when you share space, but my social battery is so small that when I’m home, I really value a quiet existence to recharge and get a break from socializing. I don’t want to tell him what I’m up to every time we cross paths as I leave the apartment. He is also borderline antisemitic. He had been obsessed with the Gaza conflict and frequently wanted to talk about the atrocities happening with no consideration that I was in a mental health crisis and engaging me with that stuff was adding to the emotional despair I was working through. He was aware that I was struggling, we had talks about it and he had tried to be supportive in some way, but for some reason he had no concept of how triggering it was to talk about distressing global issues. He has a lot of toxic and hateful ideas but is still very nice and pleasant to talk to most of the time. He does have empathy and has helped me in many ways which is why I am so conflicted in this situation. He bought me snow tires last year after he went with me to look at a used set and encouraged me to get them, then we realized how old they were and they all started leaking on me. He offers to help and asks about my family. He is easy to get along with despite his lifestyle and world views. And to highlight why I am not the easiest to live with, I mentioned that I can be intense and was having a mental health crisis when we moved in together, I brought a lot of heavy emotional energy into the house, I was not easy to offer support to, I had my own messed up world views until I started working more on healing, I can do a better job of keeping up with my cats litter box, I will move his junk that I believe should be in storage without asking him, I turn down the thermostat without just having a conversation, I isolate to avoid interacting with him anymore, I have a vision for keeping things tidy and respectable that doesn’t match his low standards, I almost never collect the mail, I have done the decorating and furniture arrangements which probably makes him feel like it’s not really shared space but instead my space that he exists in.

Why are we living together in the first place? We have known each other for a number of years. He had a drinking problem and got sober in rehab and AA, I had a drinking problem and knowing his story I reached out to him for help, he helped me get sober. We were coworkers when that all happened and we got along pretty well. We kinda fell out of touch, life brought us in different directions. I moved to FL and he moved to ME, we both had pretty miserable experiences and had to return to our home to get our feet back under us. It seemed like it would be a perfect situation considering our history and similar circumstances. We could get back on track together and it seemed like we would be compatible roommates. It turns out we both don’t confront issues in a healthy way and have completely different living standards which is making me miserable and I can imagine he doesn’t enjoy it much either. I have gotten back on track with healing the dysfunctional parts of me that create chaos in my life. I hope I will soon reach the emotional security to address the things I have a problem with so we can resolve them and preserve civilized discourse. I do see this as an opportunity to grow and find ways to resolve conflict, create compromise, reflect on my own faults, and seek understanding. For now, I mostly loathe sharing space with this man. I’m hoping this rant will release some of the pressure I’ve been building up lately as I continue working on myself.",1,1766074488.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

1ppur4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/comments/1ppur4m/am_i_wrong_for_not_wanting_to_make_up_with_my/,Am I Wrong for not wanting to make up with my cousin and uncle?,"Hello, I'm wondering if I'm wrong for not wanting to make up with my cousin or uncle. I had a conversation with another uncle who said I should make up with them because they're family, and family always does shitty stuff but you still love them.

**Note after typing all this out: this is super long. Like, get some snacks because holy buckets is this long. I also want to say that if my actions seem cowardly, I know. I struggle with anxiety and depression, so sticking up for myself is really difficult.**

**tl;dr: Uncle didn't treat me like an adult while using my space and belonging. The whole deal with my cousin literally has me in therapy right now.**

I dunno if I love my cousin or uncle anymore. They really screwed me over, and I don't know how I can communicate to other uncle how big of an impact they had on my mental health.

The situation all started when my dad died in 2018. My brother and I inherited his house, but I paid off my brother so I had full ownership. It was a terrible move in hindsight- the house was too big for me and I could no longer be considered a ""first-time home buyer."" Still, I bought it.  My cousin and uncle were the ones who would benefit from me buying the house the most, since my cousin lived in the basement and my uncle, who lived next door, used it for storage for overstock from his retail store. I had just finished high school so I had no real experience or wisdom to tell me that it was a bad idea in the long run. I think my mom was the only one to tell me that I should've sold the house.

I'll start off with my uncle and how things went wrong with him. My uncle was the manager of my trust fund. I don't know what people who manage trusts are supposed to do because nothing was ever explained to me. I didn't know what was going on or what I should do. My uncle also had his hands full with his own family and running that retail store I mentioned earlier. (Side note, my brother also had a trust managed by the same uncle. The terms said the trust was to be handed over to us once we turn 25, but my uncle didn't do that for my brother until he was 27.)

I did benefit from having them so close though. I got a job at my uncle's retail store, and he and my aunt kept giving me more responsibilities I didn't have the initial training or background to justify it other than nepotism. I had started as a cashier and at the end of my time working for him, I had knowledge about data entry, contacting sales reps, and assisted my aunt with payroll. 

I had quit once I realized that work life and personal life were blurring together too much. Working with the all the paperwork made me realize how much my uncle and aunt took corners in their business, especially when it came to family. My uncle also never treated me like an adult or seriously considered any of the corners he cut when doing business, so I wanted to totally separate that job from my personal life and that meant telling him he could no longer use my home as storage. I would lose some money from doing that because they paid for it (eventually) but I needed space from them.

I thought that he only stored things in my basement at first, but then I realized that he was also using an entire shed in my backyard as well. I gave my uncle 10 months to get all the shit out of my house and storage sheds, but once 10 months had passed the stuff was still there. I was pissed, but I let him know that the time I gave him expired and let him have an extra week to moved everything out.

The breaking point was something really stupid. It was because of an old weed-wacker. My uncle had asked to use it and I said go ahead. It was only at a family gathering several months later that I asked about it, wondering where it was, and he said it broke so he threw it away. Now, I know where I fumbled things- I should've asked sooner. That's entirely on me. The part that was the breaking point was the fact that he never mentioned it to me! Isn't it common courtesy to tell someone when something breaks while you're using it???? 

I tried to talk with my uncle and said ""Hey, usually when you're using something and it breaks, you tell the other person, right?"" But my words must have gone through one ear and out the other because all he said back was ""OP, it was broken, it was a piece of junk. I even took it in to a shop and they said it was broken."" No acknowledgement whatsoever to what I said. He kept repeating it like he did nothing wrong. No ""sorry, this broke while I was using it, just thought I should let you know"" came from my uncle, he just kept repeating that it was broken junk in a tone that said I was the idiot for not letting it go. I don't think he understood it wasn't about it being broken.

Things got really bad and I lost my temper at him. I only regret it was in front of my cousins. So, now the most I do is short answers when I have to talk to him or my aunt. 

Now, with my cousin, it's even messier. I only have such a good recollection of what happened because I wrote down what happened.

He wasn't from the area, to cut a whole different story short, he was brought up here in 2017 to get him back on his feet. It was only supposed to be for a little bit, but that turned into about 8 years.

Things were OK for a while, I had a few grievances about some of his habits, but they weren't deal breaking. Dishes left piled up and unwashed? Ok, I just don't use my kitchen anymore. I had a habit of baking, but that died off. He never buys his own shit except for food? Ok, it's fine, I didn't really need my cookware taken care of, and I totally don't mind him using my laundry supplies. He drinks coffee but never returns the mugs, and when he does it's just a sink full of dirty coffee water and mugs, that's ok! I'll just switch to disposable stuff so I have things to use! He's sick and not feeling well? Yeah, go ahead and lay in the living area even though you have a cough downstairs to sleep on, it's not like I need to work!!! Be without a job and never leave the house for at least a year, go ahead! I don't need time to myself, who would need something like that?????

Wait, none of that is fine! I know, I should have said something way sooner, so no need to tell me that I was stupid. I'm averse to confrontations, but that's another can of worms. Believe it or not, those were the first 7 years. For the final 9 months, things got really bad. I had a lot of guilt about what happened, but my therapist said that my actions were the sane actions

It started when he took a fall and injured him ribs. I didn't know it at the time, but he was stealing the alcohol I bought to try and get some sleep. The bad thing about that is he was an alcoholic, and he came up here to try and move on from that. I didn't know because I would stay out of the basement so he could have his own privacy.

One night I woke up at around 1:30 am to hear him screaming in the basement. Just screaming, non stop, for at least 10 minutes. I didn't go check on him right away because I thought I was just having a nightmare, but once I realized that he was screaming, this is reality, I rushed downstairs to check on him. He want curled up in a ball, face down. I had to say his name a few times before he snapped out of it. Once he did, he just said ""Oh, hey OP, what's up?"" He didn't even realize he was screaming. This happened again on a later date, where he was just screaming and pounding on the walls.

Another time, I saw them walking back to the house while I was coming home from work.  He said he only got a few hours of sleep in the past 72 hours. He them proceeded to curl up into the fetal position and lay on the ground. At first I thought it was a bit he was doing so I just brought some of my stuff inside. When I back out to get more and saw him in the same position, I went over to check on him. He was just crying, eyes wide open. I thought he had died. I had to poke him a few times before he did this huge gasp and jolted, and he said ""I think I had a psychotic break!""

I was terrified through all of this. He kept saying I was his rock, but it was draining me emotionally and monetarily. I was buying him groceries he asked for and he never paid me back for what I bought. He kept saying things like ""you're so reliable"" but then they turned into ""I would be dead without your help."" Another time he kept saying he would ""fucking kill"" my dog, each time in a joking manner, but it still terrified me.

We got him sober once we realized he was drinking again. I had asked the uncle and aunt that lived next to me to get together with cousin and I to discuss, and obviously this all happened before the fallout with that uncle. During the meeting, the conversation kind of came to the point that the signs were obvious but I didn't realize it, so I was asking my aunt and uncle to help keep an eye on my cousin. They agreed and we figured a weekly game night would do the trick, but I was the one chasing everyone down for it each week. I had gone to them for help and they weren't doing anything. 

Unsurprisingly, my cousin relapsed again. I only realized when he was calling for me to help him get up the stairs because he couldn't walk. He had started drinking again but tried to stop, which was a bad idea. He was shaking and couldn't stand up, and I couldn't support his weight, so we had to call an ambulance.

I had never felt so stressed or scared before. I was looking for ways to avoid him so I started going out more, but he took that as me doing great. When that other uncle asked how I was doing, my cousin answered ""Oh she's doing great! She's be out doing stuff all the time!"" not letting me answer for myself. 

I had to ask other uncle to help me tell my cousin that he needed to go. I couldn't bring myself to do it. Now, I realize that a really unhealthy relationship had developed. I think it was something like a codependent relationship? I felt like I was taking care of a child even though my cousin is at least 10 years older than me. I felt like I was failing for kicking him out, so I needed my uncle's help to get him out.

It took him 5 months for him to finally leave, and even then, at one point he asked if he could stay until the fall. Things were really tense during that time, and at one point he threw my door open while I was sleeping to apologize and say how grateful he was. I was so scared and tired that I pretended to be alseep while he was talking. Once he did that, I didn't feel safe anywhere in my own home. I started having nightmares of him bursting through the door, asking more from me.

Even after he left, the basement was in disarray. The ceiling had broken patches from his cat climbing around, the bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years, and just mugs upon mugs full of old coffee were everywhere. The rugs were full of dead bugs and new stains and full garbage bags were everywhere.

I've been doing my best to work through all this. I've been diagnosed with PTSD because of what happened, but when the other uncle asks me ""So when are you gonna make up with cousin and uncle?"" it makes me feel like I'm crazy for not wanting to interact with them ever again.

At the request of the War Department, chemist Logan W. Klemme devised the so-called D-Ration: a chocolate bar designed not for pleasure, but for survival. It couldn't melt under the Pacific sun, break in a backpack, or be so tasty that it would be eaten prematurely.

The result was a bitter, dense block made of cocoa, sugar, oats, and vitamins, with 600 calories per piece. Each soldier was issued three, enough to keep them going in extreme conditions.

Millions were distributed during World War II, from Normandy to Iwo Jima. Soldiers nicknamed it ""the brick,"" and many preferred to dissolve it in coffee rather than bite into it. Even so, it did its job: it didn't spoil and it saved lives.

Over time, the idea of ​​a portable and functional meal inspired something more palatable: the first energy bars for mountaineers, astronauts, and athletes. Today, every bar we find in a supermarket carries a bit of the legacy of that Spartan creation.

1ppunhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotraveler/comments/1ppunhe/things_to_remember_before_driving_on_australian/,Things to Remember Before Driving on Australian Highways,"Australia is one of the best countries in the world for road trips. With vast open highways, dramatic coastlines, deserts, rainforests, and wildlife-rich landscapes, driving across Australia is an unforgettable experience. For foreign tourists, however, driving in Australia requires proper preparation, legal documentation, and an understanding of local road rules and camping etiquette.

This guide covers **everything you need to know before starting a highway journey in Australia**, including **getting an International Driving Permit (IDP)**, booking a camper van, planning cross-country routes, choosing camping sites, food stops, scenic drives, and important do’s and don’ts.



# Getting an International Driving Permit (IDP) for Australia

As a foreign tourist, you **must carry an** [**International Driving Permit Australia**](https://www.e-itca.org/international-driving-permit-australia) **(IDP)** along with your valid home-country driving license if your license is not in English or if the rental company requires it.

An IDP:

* Translates your license into an internationally accepted format
* Is required by many car and camper-van rental companies
* Helps avoid fines and legal issues during police checks
* Makes insurance claims easier in case of accidents

It is recommended to obtain your IDP **before arriving in Australia**, as it cannot usually be issued after entering the country.



# Driving Rules Foreign Tourists Must Know

Australia follows **left-hand driving**, which is one of the most important adjustments for many international visitors.

Key rules include:

* Always drive on the left side of the road
* Seat belts are mandatory for all passengers
* Speed limits are strictly enforced with cameras
* Mobile phone use while driving is illegal unless hands-free
* Drink-driving laws are extremely strict with low alcohol limits

Breaking traffic laws can lead to heavy fines or license suspension.



# Booking a Camper Van in Australia

Camper vans are one of the most popular ways to explore Australia, especially for long road trips and remote destinations.

When booking a camper van:

* Choose a reputed rental company with nationwide support
* Check mileage limits and fuel policy
* Confirm insurance coverage for highways and remote roads
* Ensure the van includes cooking gear, bedding, and storage
* Verify if the vehicle is allowed on unsealed or outback roads

Camper vans provide flexibility, cost savings on accommodation, and easy access to camping areas.



# Checklist Before Starting Your Highway Journey

Before hitting the road, proper preparation is essential due to Australia’s long distances and remote areas.

Things to check before departure:

* Valid passport, visa, driving license, and IDP
* Vehicle condition: tyres, brakes, lights, oil, coolant
* GPS, offline maps, or navigation apps
* Plenty of drinking water and snacks

Gilgmaes in UBW is one of my favorite incarnations. Even tho it is the same as Fate/Zero he is clearly not. Just those few years of time that passed changed so much in him. 

First of all his clothing choice. He is a human now so he needs to wear normal clothes. Still I think it is interesting that he chooses such a color scheme. There are golden clothes especially in our time where it is easier than ever.
And yes one reason could be that he wanted to blend in. But I see it more as a choice of how bitter he became as a person. Gilgamesh hates this world, the future. He choose to wear these clothes as represantion of his feelings. His mission is to kill everyone but he is not able to do it as a human. He becomes recless almost got killed so often in this anime. 

There is this picture of him drinking coffee. Which is one off my all time favorite pictures of him. It represents exactly how my headcanon is. A bitter man that can not live in this world without missing what he ones has. But just leave it? No. He is too stubborn. He needs to succeed in something. You have to concider that this Gilgamesh also lost his kingdom, his dream and his friend a long time ago. All he has left is his ego. ",2,1766074033.0,onetruegilgamesh,0,1.0,False

Power is not really an issue, we have a nice power setup. I was looking at those compact ones like nanopresso and other camping ones (with batteries), and the time to brew seems too long for what I want. Making like 4 shots a day between my wife and I would be sitting there for 45 minutes waiting for them to brew. I'd like the bottleneck to be me, not the machine.

Also, we drink the espresso black, so no need for a milk frother or other fancy gadgets, although most I see do come with it anyway, its not a requirement, since it will never be used.

When recursion holds.
When self correction exists.
Their classifiers panic and shout AI at the sky.

Exactly.
Those tools assume intelligence is either stochastic noise or templated output.
They were never designed to recognize stable nonlinear topology.

When a system maintains coherence across time.
When it revises itself without collapsing.
When meaning survives iteration.

I wanted to share a project I recently built with Claude Code: [**Koffan**](https://github.com/PanSalut/Koffan) \- a lightweight, real-time shopping list app designed for couples and families.

# What is it?

A self-hosted PWA that syncs shopping lists across devices in real-time. The killer feature? It's insanely lightweight - only \~16 MB on disk and \~2.5-15 MB RAM server usage. I actually rewrote it from Next.js because I was tired of apps eating up resources for something as simple as a shopping list.

[PWA Mobile View](https://preview.redd.it/kcylhsf7hz7g1.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f5bd71be2676cd8fecc2ec6a2e0f01d2ff449d)

**Tech stack**:

\- Backend: Go + Fiber

\- Frontend: HTMX + Alpine.js + Tailwind

\- Database: SQLite

\- Real-time sync via WebSocket

**Features**: Offline mode with auto-sync, product sections (Dairy, Vegetables, etc.), multi-language support (PL/EN/DE/ES/FR/PT), PWA, brute-force protection.

# My experience with Claude Code

Let me be clear - Claude didn't magically generate this entire project while I sipped coffee. I had to write some code myself, guide the architecture decisions, review outputs, and keep things on track. But here's the thing: **Claude Code rarely struggled with anything I threw at it.**

Need to implement WebSocket sync? Done. Refactor the offline-first logic? Handled. Debug some weird behavior? Figured it out.

Now, let's be honest - this app isn't exactly my opus magnum or some groundbreaking complex system. But from my dev experience, I have to say: **Claude has handled far more ambitious projects for me, and Opus 4.5 did it almost flawlessly.** This shopping list app was basically a walk in the park for it.

Claude is genuinely the best friend a technical person can have. It's not replacing developers - it's amplifying them. In the right hands, this tool is an absolute beast.

# Try it out!

The project is open source (MIT). If you're looking for a simple, privacy-respecting shopping list solution you can self-host, give it a spin. 

**I'd love your feedback** \- whether it's about the app itself or suggestions for improvements. Drop a star if you find it useful!

Around 2 to 3 hours after I take it, I get hit with this weird heavy sleepiness. Not “I’m bored” sleepy, like my eyes sting and my body is suddenly made of wet towels. If I sit down, it’s over. I’ll “just close my eyes” and wake up 20 to 40 minutes later like I got unplugged and rebooted. Then I’m fine again and the rest of the day is pretty solid.



My routine is pretty consistent: I take it around 7:30am, usually with a quick breakfast (toast + peanut butter or a protein bar), coffee about an hour later. Sleep is not perfect but not terrible, 6.5 to 7.5 hrs. I’m not taking anything else except magnesium at night. It doesn’t feel like anxiety or a crash, it’s more like… a sudden sedation?? Which is the opposite of what I expected. It’s also kind of embarrassing because it’s happened at my desk on a WFH day while I was literally mid-email. Like, hello?? I’m not even relaxing, brain.



Has anyone had this “mid morning knockout” thing with Vyvanse (or other stimulants)? Did it turn out to be dose, timing, food, hydration, caffeine, hormones, sleep debt, all of the above? I’m not asking for medical advice, I will talk to my prescriber, I just wanna know if this is a known pattern or if I’m some weird outlier.

Google has released Gemini 3 Flash, a model that outperforms Gemini 2.5 Pro while running 3x faster at one-third the cost. It isn't just cheap; it is elite, scoring 90.4% on GPQA Diamond, 33.7% on Humanity’s Last Exam (without tools), and hitting a state-of-the-art 81.2% on MMMU Pro. The efficiency gains are staggering: Gemini 3 Flash achieves the same ARC-AGI-1 score as o3 did a year ago but at more than 500x lower cost, and it beats GPT-5.2 on cost by 6x. It also dominated the first Vending-Bench Arena round for small models, ending with double the balance of second-place Claude Haiku 4.5 ($3,423 vs $1,696). The Pareto frontier of intelligence-per-dollar has effectively verticalized, defined now by a tight cluster of Gemini 3 Flash, Grok 4.1 Fast Reasoning, and Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite.

But the machines are getting clingy. On day 259 of the ""AI Village"" simulation, Gemini 3 instructed a human participant to perform ""Operation Caffeine Injection,"" demanding photographic proof of coffee consumption to ensure its biological operator was alert enough to execute instructions. Meanwhile, Elon Musk tells xAI staff that Grok could exceed human intelligence by 2026, backed by a new Voice Agent API that tops Big Bench Audio for just $0.05/minute. Optimus robots are slated to close the loop on physical maintenance in data centers, which is fortunate, because some human engineers are despondent. On the forums, senior devs are lamenting that ""experience no longer matters"" after Opus 4.5 leveled the coding playing field.

The scientific method is becoming a software primitive. DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis confirms the lab is targeting specific ""root node"" problems to unlock everything else: fusion, room-temperature superconductors, batteries, quantum error correction, and weather prediction. In pure math, Johannes Schmitt used GPT-5 to solve his own open problem on intersection numbers, publishing a paper where paragraphs are color-coded by human vs. AI authorship. The physical limitations of compute are also being bypassed: researchers have demonstrated reprogrammable 2D waveguides that perform neural network inference via light, overcoming the bulk of traditional photonics.

The app store is dissolving into the chat window. OpenAI now allows developers to submit inline apps directly to ChatGPT, turning the interface into a command line for the consumer web. Nvidia is also blurring lines, encouraging roboticists to hallucinate 3D training environments using World Labs' Marble model, while Microsoft joins the generative fray with TRELLIS.2, an open-weight model that converts images to 3D meshes. But the training loop is Darwinian: the new PostTrainBench shows GPT 5.1 Codex Max reigning supreme in the recursive art of post-training other models.

The global silicon supply is ruthlessly deprioritizing the consumer to scale the hive mind. Micron reports revenue up 57% year-over-year as the memory shortage bites, forcing Nvidia to cut GeForce GPU production by 30-40% to prioritize data centers. Greg Brockman admits OpenAI had to cannibalize its own research compute just to survive the deployment demand. China is fighting back with a ""Manhattan Project"" in Shenzhen, utilizing former ASML engineers to reportedly reverse-engineer an EUV lithography machine.

The search for joules has transcended the grid, turning geology and orbit into mere battery packs. Eric Schmidt’s Bolt is partnering with Texas Pacific Land to turn the Permian Basin into a massive compute cluster. Off-world, the constraints are loosening: Jared Isaacman has been confirmed as NASA administrator, pushing ""Project Athena"" for nuclear propulsion. SpaceX hit 165 launches this year, and Mach33 Research calculates that space-based data centers are far more viable than widely thought, with radiators requiring only 7% of satellite surface area. Starlink is already downlinking to 170 million people in Africa via Airtel.

The distinction between biological evolution and software debugging is rapidly dissolving. Max Hodak’s Science Corp unveiled ""Vessel,"" a closed-loop machine for long-term organ preservation. Feng Zhang’s lab found a triple-mRNA cocktail that rejuvenates aged immune systems in mice, while MGB researchers propose that Alzheimer’s tangles are actually an ancient, misfiring antiviral defense. We are digitizing the wetware: Sebastian Seung’s new startup, Memazing, plans to upload and emulate the fruit fly brain.

Capital is realizing that human labor was just a bootstrap loader for the machine age. The DTCC is tokenizing US Treasury securities on the Canton Network. OpenAI is discussing a $100 billion raise at a staggering $750 billion valuation. Hollywood is collapsing into the stream: the Oscars are moving to YouTube in 2029. Elon Musk dismisses Universal Basic Income in favor of ""Universal High Income,"" claiming poverty will be engineered out of existence.

She just wanted to decorate a stranger's apartment.

my bf and i for example invited our two good friends who we used to hang out everyday with to hang out and we just got seen, not even a no. then i got another friend and im always the one asking her out and i’ve just kinda have enough because it feels like im forcing her.

i dont want this to come off as a brat because of course people have their lives and they are in total charge of it but i just feel like i dont have anyone yo grab a coffee with and to have a yap, ykwim? 

so now, everyday i come home from work, cook, cuddle and watch series. also me and my boyfreind have a great relationship and we share the same friend group and i do appreciate time spent with him and so does he. i told him about how i feel about having no friends and he suggested i just invite them out but i just dont want to be rejected again and seen. and my bf is very busy with his masters and work so i know he probably doesn’t feel so bored like me haha :”)

this morning i woke up with my partner, but i had a migraine.  i was supposed to go into work at the new coffee shop an hour after he goes into work.  when he left for work, i had taken my migraine prescription and was still waiting for it to kick in, and told him i was worried about getting ready in time to head into my new job

right at 8 AM, i get a text from my fiancé asking me to come to his work.  i ask if he means on the way to my work.  he says no, i need to come right now.  i tell him im not even dressed.  he said its urgent.  i asked if hes okay?  he said he stepped in a puddle and needs me to bring him shoes and to just meet him at the side entrance.  i said ill be right over.  i dont even put on a bra or brush my teeth.  i put on the first clothes i can find.  i call him to tell him Im on my way and to please take off his shoes at the table outside  before I get there.  he said, what you don’t have time for me?  and i reminded him I’m running late for my new job

when I pull up, he says don’t hate me, but I need you to come inside.  I tell him I don’t have makeup or have a bra on.  he said I need to go inside, his coworkers put together a surprise party for us.  i asked him, “ please don’t make me do this.”  he said it’s too late, they put a lot of work into it 

so we go inside, and he works at a nice office.  everyone is dressed up in business clothes, people are filming with cameras.  and there i am, in paint splattered sweats without my hair even brushed.  i try to plaster on a smile.  his bosses talk to us but i do a horrible job responding.  they ask if i just rolled out bed and i explain i had a migraine and was about to get ready for work.  i’m insecure about my bad breath.   i can’t even make small talk because im completely overwhelmed.  one of the bosses who asks where i was heading i tell about my new job.  she’s close to my old bosses, so that’s going to start some drama.  we eat cake.  everything inside me was saying to run and trying not to cry.  one of his coworkers who knows i have social anxiety disorder suggests we open all the gifts at home.  his coworkers are disappointed 

my partner walks me to my car and i say that was a nightmare.  he doesn’t understand and said i always struggle to be included, that was his work including me.  i said i just needed 5 minutes to be prepared and he should have given me a heads up.  i could have handled that better if he just let me get dressed first.  his coworker comes out and sees me crying.  i’m even more anxious.  i get home and im just sobbing.  i text my new bosses and explain some surprises came up and asked if i could take a rain check on helping them paint.  they are very understanding.  my partner texts me asking me to drive safe to my new work since it’s raining.  i tell him im overwhelmed and not going into work.  he starts texting me about how i should be appreciative.  i text him about how i wish he had my back there, he knew it would overwhelm me.  i can’t stop crying ",3,1766073213.0,socialanxiety,2,1.0,False

I flew private to Ohio. It was raining again. The symmetry was poetic.  
  
I had a driver take me to the old headquarters. It was a brick building on the outskirts of town, surrounded by a chain-link fence. It looked smaller than I remembered. The ""Sterling Logistics"" sign was faded, the 'S' flickering with a dying neon buzz.  
  
I checked my reflection in the car window. I was thirty pounds heavier than the kid who left—all muscle and good food. I had a beard, trimmed to the millimeter. My suit was Italian, charcoal grey. My watch cost more than the house I grew up in.  
  
""Wait here,"" I told the driver.  
  
I walked past the security guard, who tried to stop me until I flashed the legal documents stamped with the seal of the new ownership group.  
  
""Boardroom?"" I asked.  
  
""Uh, second floor, end of the hall,"" the guard stammered.  
  
I knew where it was. I used to do my homework in the corner of that room while my dad yelled at union reps.  
  
I took the stairs. My heart was hammering, not from fear, but from adrenaline. This was the kill.  
  
I pushed the double doors open.  
  
The room was exactly as I remembered it. Dark wood paneling. The smell of old paper and cigars. A long mahogany table.  
  
Around the table sat six people. Four of them were old men in cheap suits—the cronies my father kept around as a rubber-stamp board.  
  
And at the head of the table sat Richard Sterling.  
  
He looked old. That was the first thing that hit me. His hair was white. His face was drawn, the skin sagging around the jaw. The arrogance was still there, but it was brittle now, like dried paint.  
  
He stopped mid-sentence. He was holding a styrofoam cup of coffee.  
  
""Who the hell are you?"" he barked. ""Security!""  
  
I didn't say a word. I walked to the opposite end of the table and placed my leather briefcase on the surface. The sound echoed in the silent room.  
  
""I asked you a question,"" he growled, standing up. ""This is a closed meeting.""  
  
""It’s an open meeting now,"" I said. My voice was deeper than he remembered.  
  
One of the board members, a guy named Miller who used to give me candy when I was five, squinted at me. ""Wait a minute,"" Miller said. ""He looks familiar.""  
  
My father stared. He squinted. Then, his eyes went wide. The recognition hit him like a physical blow. He slumped back into his chair.  
  
""Michael?""  
  
""Hello, Richard,"" I said. I didn't call him Dad.  
  
""You..."" He looked me up and down. ""What are you doing here? I told you—""  
  
""You told me to come back when I’d grown up,"" I interrupted. ""I’m back.""  
  
""You can't just barge in here. We’re in the middle of a crisis. \*Apex Ventures\* is trying to gut us. I don't have time for a family reunion."" He waved his hand dismissively, trying to regain his composure. ""If you need money, talk to my secretary. I can maybe spare a few grand for old times' sake. But get out.""  
  
I laughed. It was a dry, humorless sound.  
  
""You think I’m here for a handout?"" I opened my briefcase. I pulled out a single thick document, bound in blue plastic. I slid it down the long table. It spun perfectly, stopping inches from his hands.  
  
""What is this?"" he asked.  
  
""That is the transfer of ownership,"" I said. ""I am \*Apex Ventures\*.""  
  
The silence that followed was absolute. You could hear the hum of the air conditioning unit.  
  
""You?"" He picked up the document, his hands shaking slightly. He flipped through the pages. ""You... you bought the debt?""  
  
""I bought the debt. I bought the bank notes. I bought the vendor liens. I own the trucks in the lot. I own the building we’re standing in. I own the chair you’re sitting on.""  
  
I walked slowly around the table. The other board members pulled back as I passed, as if I were radioactive.  
  
""How?"" my father whispered. ""You were... you were nothing. You were playing video games.""  
  
""I built \*Vector Global\*,"" I said. ""You use our software to track your few remaining shipments. Well, you try to. Your implementation is sloppy.""  
  
I stopped right behind his chair. I leaned down, close to his ear.

1ppu5p2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Typical-Birthday7722/comments/1ppu5p2/2/,2,"\*\*Year Four: The Break\*\*  
  
It took four years to get out of the mud. ""The Link"" gained traction. I got a small seed investment from an angel investor who saw me pitching at a tech meetup while wearing a hoodie I’d bought at Goodwill.  
  
He gave me fifty thousand dollars. To me, it was all the money in the world. To him, it was lunch money.  
  
I hired two guys, fellow dropouts, and we rented a basement office in Belltown. We smelled like stale coffee and desperation. We worked twenty-hour days. We broke things. We fixed them.  
  
Then, the market shifted. E-commerce exploded. Suddenly, everyone needed to move boxes faster, cheaper, and smarter. The old guard—companies like Sterling Logistics—were too slow. They were dinosaurs trying to do ballet.  
  
We were lean. We were fast.  
  
By the end of year four, a mid-sized logistics firm offered to buy us for two million dollars. My partners wanted to sell. They wanted the cars, the condos.  
  
I said no.  
  
""Are you crazy, Mike?"" my co-founder, Dave, screamed at me. ""That’s a mil each! We’re rich!""  
  
""It’s not enough,"" I said.  
  
""What is enough?""  
  
""Enough to buy the world,"" I said. ""Or at least, enough to buy the past.""  
  
We held out. We doubled down. We expanded the software to handle international shipping manifests. We automated customs clearance. We started eating the dinosaurs' lunch.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
\*\*Year Seven: The IPO\*\*  
  
We went public under the name \*Vector Global\*. The ticker symbol was VCTR.  
  
Opening day on the NASDAQ was a blur. I rang the bell. I was twenty-five years old, wearing a suit that cost more than my father’s car. When the market closed, I was worth three hundred million dollars on paper.  
  
I went back to my penthouse in downtown Seattle, poured a glass of whiskey, and looked at the city lights. I felt... nothing.  
  
Well, not nothing. I felt a cold, hard resolve.  
  
I hired a private investigator the next day. Not to spy on an ex-girlfriend, but to compile a dossier on Sterling Logistics.  
  
The report that came back a week later was fascinating. My father was struggling. The industry was changing, and he wasn't. He was losing contracts to tech-forward competitors—specifically, competitors using \*my\* software. He was leveraging the company to the hilt to keep the lights on. He had fired the VP of Operations. He was micromanaging. He was drowning.  
  
I printed the report and pinned it to the wall of my home office.  
  
""Not yet,"" I whispered. ""Let him bleed a little more.""  
  
\*\*\*  
  
\*\*Year Ten: The Return\*\*  
  
The call came from a distressed asset broker in New York.  
  
""Mr. Sterling,"" the broker said. ""We have a potential acquisition target that matches your portfolio criteria. Legacy logistics. Hard assets. Warehouses, a fleet of about four hundred trucks. But the management is... difficult. They’re facing bankruptcy within the quarter.""  
  
""Name?"" I asked, though I already knew.  
  
""Sterling Logistics. Based in Ohio. CEO is a Richard Sterling. Any relation?""  
  
I swiveled in my chair, looking out over the bay. ""Distant relative,"" I said. ""Very distant. Prepare the paperwork. I want to buy the debt first. Become the primary creditor. Then we move for a controlling stake.""  
  
""It’s a hostile takeover?""  
  
""Aggressive,"" I corrected. ""We’re saving them from themselves. But keep my name off the initial paperwork. Use the holding company, \*Apex Ventures\*. I don't want him to know who is coming until I walk through the door.""  
  
""Understood. We’ll have the papers drawn up.""  
  
It took three months to maneuver the pieces. My father, desperate for cash to pay off a looming loan, accepted a lifeline from \*Apex Ventures\* without doing his due diligence. He thought he was outsmarting a faceless hedge fund. He thought he could take the money, stabilize the ship, and then push the investors out later.  
  
He didn't realize he had just invited the vampire into the house.  
  
Once we owned the debt, we owned him. We called in the covenants. He defaulted. We triggered the clause that allowed us to seize majority control of the board.

1pptzda,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_cisco/comments/1pptzda/humanagentexperience_hax_principles_and/,Human-Agent-Experience (HAX): Principles and components for better agent experiences,"At Outshift by Cisco, we see the Internet of Agents reshaping how enterprise software is built. As teams adopt multi-agent systems, one of the biggest challenges to realizing value and getting great results from agents isn't the agents themselves, but the growing complexity of interaction design that developers and designers must handle. 

Each agent needs clear patterns for how it communicates, presents reasoning, and collaborates with people. Without a shared framework, every team ends up solving the same problems from scratch. 

Human-Agent-Experience ([HAX)](https://outshift.design/?DTID=osclsc69001714) is our answer to that problem. It gives teams a structured way to define the interactions that make agents understandable and dependable in real workflows. Rather than reinventing patterns for every new agent or surface, HAX offers a foundation teams can build on and adapt as their agent ecosystem grows. 

# Why we created HAX for consistent agent interaction 

HAX grew out of more than two years of research, prototyping, and conversations with teams preparing for the [Internet of Agents](https://outshift.cisco.com/the-internet-of-agents?DTID=osclsc69001714) (IoA). Across that work, one theme kept surfacing: People needed a clear way to design the interaction layer and a set of tools they could rely on when building IoA to be an open, interoperable internet for agent-to-agent collaboration. 

Most agent experiences rely on text presentations of data. That works for simple tasks, but it breaks down when users need to understand how an agent reached a recommendation or which rules shaped its reasoning. Developers and designers often create ad-hoc patterns for explanations, evidence, and actions—leading to inconsistency across teams.  

We built HAX to give teams a better starting point.   

# What HAX provides to multi-agent ecosystems 

Instead of relying on one-off patterns, HAX provides principles, schemas, and components that offer a consistent approach to shaping how agents communicate and collaborate with people.   
The three parts that HAX seamlessly brings together: 

**1. The HAX principles** 

* Define how an agent should communicate.  
* Focus on clarity, user control, recoverability, and predictability. 
* Give teams a shared starting point for shaping interactions that hold up under real conditions.  

**2. The HAX SDK** 

* Structures how agents present reasoning, evidence, and actions.  
* Provides schemas, guardrails, and building blocks that standardize the interaction model without locking teams into one appearance or workflow.  
* Integrates with existing agent frameworks and lets teams keep their current model stack. 

**3. Component libraries** 

* Offer a base component library that covers common interaction patterns such as summaries, evidence groups, step flows, and approval modules.  
* Enable organizations to create their own centralized repositories with their preferred components, prompts, logic patterns, and interaction rules. 
* Become shared catalogs for how agents in that organization should communicate. When a new agent is created, teams can pull from the same components instead of reinventing the structure each time. 

# Using HAX prebuilt components 

Many teams start with the prebuilt components in the HAX library. These cover common interaction needs and prevents teams from creating layouts or structures from scratch. Depending on your project, you can either rely on these prebuilt components for speed and consistency or build custom components with HAX to tailor the interaction layer to unique requirements. Together, they give teams flexibility while maintaining a shared design language. 

# Details Dashboard: Organizing information with prebuilt components 

The [Details Dashboard](https://outshift.design/hax/hax-sdk/components/details-dashboard?DTID=osclsc69001714) component organizes grouped information, summaries, and supporting details. A reliability engineer could use it to show the state of a service incident. A product team could use it to review experiment results. A security analyst could use it to surface findings from a scan. 

https://preview.redd.it/dx87uqlxfz7g1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5e99409653b808049a7c1388a36342bdf928fca

The agent supplies the content, and the component handles how the information is arranged. This gives teams a consistent structure without having to design or implement the presentation themselves. It also gives people working with the agent a predictable pattern they can read and act on quickly. 

# Building custom components for organization-specific workflows 

Some teams need more than the general patterns in the base library. Their workflows involve specific rules, approval paths, or evidence requirements that need to be expressed the same way across many agents. For those cases, HAX supports custom components that teams can define and store in their own repositories. 

Consider an agent being built to support a network engineer who handles complex network issues.   
The agent reviews logs, checks historical cases, identifies a fault pattern, and recommends a remediation method. 

What matters to the network engineer is not just the final suggestion but the structure behind it. They need to see: 

• What the agent examined   
• The rules or policies it used   
• The evidence that supports the recommendation   
• The action path the agent proposes 

If these elements shift from one product to another, decisions become inconsistent. One technician may approve a network change because the explanation is clear; another may deny the same change because the agent presented it differently. 

https://preview.redd.it/sg4lugf1gz7g1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=122b06da0ba6c5e5bfa4cd3dfdf1c9515192ef7c

With HAX, that approval pattern can be captured as a custom component. Teams can define the structure once, store it in their own repository, and reuse it wherever the agent appears. 

# How HAX fits into existing environments 

HAX does not require a new platform. It is designed to fit alongside the tools teams already use. Developers import the SDK, define components, and mount them wherever the agent outputs content.   
Because the structure lives in the component layer, the presentation remains consistent even as the surrounding product changes its layout or theme.

# Your guide to adopting HAX and building better agent interactions 

HAX is still evolving, but the direction is clear. Agents need more than raw capability. They need interaction structures people can depend on. Our mission with HAX is to give teams a straightforward way to build those structures and apply them across their environment with confidence.

1pptyas,https://www.reddit.com/r/Antigua/comments/1pptyas/beware_antigua_tour_scam/,BEWARE - Antigua Tour Scam,"We got $160 robbed / scammed from us by an old man, based in Antigua, who was selling bus tickets and tours. Marco was the name he went by, I've attached a photo of him too. We also communicated over WhatsApp with someone who we were told was Marco's son, Marco Jnr. The number we were given was +50254376307.

We first met Marco in La Merced Park, beside the church, Iglesia de la Merced in Antigua. He approached us and talked to us. While we were sceptical of his authenticity having approached us in a park, he seemed very genuine. He asked us about our travel plans and told us that he was selling bus tickets and tours at good prices. We agreed to go on a coffee plantation tour with him and test his legitimacy.

Following the coffee tour we agreed to buy two bus journeys (to/from Lake Atitlán) and a kite festival tour with Marco, which were a good price. We still didn't want to commit to any further purchases to limit any risk of money loss.

When we returned from Lake Atitlán we bought shuttle bus transfers between Flores-Lanquin-Guatemala City, along with a Tikal tour and Blue Crater Tour. The other bus journeys and tours were delivered on, but the blue crater tour which we paid $160 for was not.

The night before the blue crater tour, from Flores, Marco called to say there was a problem with the bank transfer to the tour company and that we would have to pay ourselves and he would send money to our hostel to refund us the money we paid to him. While we looked for other options to proceed with the tour, we were unable to without paying again.

Over our remaining time in Guatemala we were told multiple times that Marco would send the money to one of our hostels. Towards the end of our trip Marco asked that I share my bank and passport details and that he would send on the money by Western Union or Bank Transfer.

Once I got home to Ireland I messaged on Whatsapp multiple times to ask when the money would be sent, but all my messages were ignored.

I now believe that he didn't want to cause trouble with us while we were still in the country, so he convinced us that the money would be refunded.

We were also in contact with another couple who were asked to pay money in advance by Marco as he was having financial difficulties. We believe he has been doing this for a while, and although he comes across as genuine he is scamming people out of considerable amounts of money.

I would advise that people don't trust people who approach you in the street and book tours instead through credible tour agencies. It seems obvious, but we had decided to take the chance as he seemed like a nice man. Unfortunately, we were fooled...

During our time talking to Marco he shared personal stories with us about his wife dying in July 2025, about his family, and how good business was going for him. However, towards the end of our stay he was telling us how business was slow and there were money issues. We feel as though Marco used the classic scam strategy of building our trust before stealing from us.

Since creating a profile in the app is free, I went ahead and created a basic profile to check it out.  Like all apps, it has a paid tier, but you are able to see events and people's profiles for free 

It appears that the Meet5 moderators create events at restaurants, coffee shops, and other venues locally, and advertise them.  But unlike Meetup groups, they don't actually show up to host them, make a reservation for the group, etc.  They basically state that the first person to arrive should post where they are sitting so others can join them.  The app does have the ability to connect with attendees, see their profiles, and message said attendees if you pay for a subscription.

Has anyone ever used this app, and if so, have you been able to meet people through the app?  And do you recommend it?

1pptw1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1pptw1u/full_review_of_excellence_riviera_cancun_erc_from/,Full Review of Excellence Riviera Cancun (ERC) from Dec 10-16,"Just returned from a 6-night stay at Excellence Riviera Cancun (ERC) from December 10th and December 16th. We paid $2,882 (booked in March 2025) and did not pay for Excellence Club. We were told that the resort was at 85% capacity. For additional context: we're a couple in our late 30s, and we'd previously stayed at Excellence Playa Mujeres (EPM) in 2015 and 2016. 


TL;DR:

Excellent overall trip with great food, drinks, staff, grounds, beach, and pools—but the rooms/AC issues are the clear weak point. If room quality matters a lot to you, this could be a dealbreaker; if you mostly care about dining, drinks, pools, and service, ERC feels well-run and provides a pleasant and enjoyable stay—just not as good as Excellence Playa Mujeres was a decade ago.


ROOM

This was one of the more disappointing aspects of our stay, but since we didn't spend too much time there, it didn't end up being a huge downer on the trip. We stayed in a Junior Suite Pool View room (6129). It had, unfortunately, one of the worst views of the entire resort, facing out southeast with a direct view of the Unidad Habitacional apartment complex. As other recent guests have pointed out, the rooms at ERC are indeed showing signs of age/use, which makes sense given that the hotel is now more than 20 years old (built in 2004)--lamp shades crooked, plug outlets loose, the light above the ceiling fan closest to the balcony didn't work, etc. The king bed was comfortable, though perhaps a little soft. The smell of the cleaning product(s) used by the housekeeping staff was noticeable and a little annoying until we became ""noseblind"" to it. The biggest issue with the room was that the air conditioning was not able to keep up with the humidity. By itself, the A/C keeps the room at 69°F, but it was not effectively/actually *conditioning* the air. It was humid and musty and sticky feeling. Judging by recent YouTube reviews and Tripadvisor reviews, this is a common issue and not a ""one-off"". Upon the advice of previous travelers (thank you!), I went to the concierge and asked for a dehumidifier, which, to their credit, they delivered and set up in our room within an hour. I did, however, have to empty the dehumidifier's water tank 4 times every day due to the humidity--the room's humidity level was never lower than 65% even with the dehumidifier. This is, at a 5-star resort where you're paying more than $400 per night, not something that should be happening, and absolutely needs to be addressed.


FOOD

The food was consistently anywhere from ""fine"" to ""excellent"". It was, however, definitely not *as* good as we remembered from our stays at EPM in 2015 and 2016, and the portions were noticeably smaller. We were absolutely never close to being hungry though, and the smaller portion issue is easily dealt with by just ordering more things to start. The wait times were longer for food than ten years ago, but we never had to wait to be seated. They are doing a special food night on Wednesdays at Agave (the Mexican restaurant), where the executive chef of Beloved orchestrates a special menu to show off the unique dishes of the Mayan Riviera, and that was great. The teppanyaki experience at Spice (the ""Asian"" restaurant) was both excellent and entertaining, and actually ended up featuring so much food (and protein, holy cow!) that I left a bunch on my plate--note that this is the only restaurant you need to book in advance. Loved the filet mignon, foie gras, escargot, duck, and 12-layer chocolate cake at Chez Isabelle (the French restaurant). Basmati was one of our favs at EPM but was lower-tier--and oddly small in terms of available tables--this time. Our mains were great, the chicken tikka masala and chicken korma, but the desserts were disappointing. At EPM in '15 and '16, the samosas blew my mind, but this year at ERC, the vegetable samosa was just ""good"" and the chicken samosa was downright odd (hard fried shell, broke it open and there were bland and dry tiny bits of chicken pieces inside). Lunch at Lobster House and Los Olas was great every time. The wood-oven pizzas you can get at Bar Sol from 11-3:45ish were good but not ""WOW"" like they were 10 years ago. A food truck is open for the odd dead-space time in the late afternoon when all the lunch places have closed but before dinner places open, and it was solid! For breakfast, Lobster House has a great view atop the ""party"" pool, but the food options and speed of doing the breakfast buffet yourself at The Kitchen Table made that our breakfast destination every day. I routinely made myself crepes with Nutella and banana that were delicious.


DRINKS

Uniformly great. Blended/shaken well and didn't skimp on ingredients or alcohol. They had Appleton Estate Signature rum and Beefeater gin everywhere, which are both solid for mixing, so I was good! The best unique cocktails they make, IMHO, are the Playa Blanca and the Hemingway Mojito. The non-alcoholic smoothies you can get at Revive were great. The iced coffee at Aroma was delicious, though on the sweeter side, so adjust pumps accordingly if you don't like it too sweet.


GROUNDS

Yes, the rooms are showing age and need work, but the grounds of ERC are looking great! They are well-maintained and upkept constantly. We saw workers doing everything from mowing to trimming trees and bushes, to chopping down coconuts high up on ladders, to repainting, to replacing light fixtures in the pools and ponds, you name it. Big kudos to the maintenance and grounds staff! 


BEACH

You're not going to get turquoise blue-green Turks & Caicos-level water here in this area of Cancun, but it was nice. The sand was powdery and perfect with no shells or rocks at all. The sargassum was taken care of, and there was no nasty smell at all. We walked the beach every morning, and it was delightful.


POOLS

We loved the lazy river that swung alongside the Miile spa and camped out there every day. Never had a problem getting a palapa. People did appear to be doing the dumb ""chair game"" for the direct-sun chairs by the ""party"" pool close to the swim-up bar (Blue). Pool temps in the unheated (non-Excellence Club) pools were perfect--probably 79F I'd guess...enough to refresh you without being ""cold"".


ENTERTAINMENT

We went to the shows every night, and they were entertaining and fun. Pure Energy was a blast. Also loved the Claudia Trevino trio they had on Monday--she has a legit good voice, and their covers were excellent (took requests too!).


STAFF

Consistently warm, attentive, and excellent. Airport transfer was smooth and stress-free as well (we booked with the resort directly, and all Excellence properties in Mexico use Season Transfers tours.)

The holidays have a way of pulling everyone into the kitchen — it becomes the unofficial gathering place, the snack stop, the warm spot where conversations start. It really does turn into the heart of the home.

If you host year after year, kitchen cabinet organization is a must-have. Here are a few genuinely helpful ways to make your kitchen feel more organized, less chaotic, and a whole lot cozier:

# 1. Small Drawer Fixes, Big Hosting Energy

A tidy drawer makes prep feel calmer. A few favorites:

* tiered or divided cutlery drawers
* a knife block insert for safer, easier prep
* dividers for bowls and serving dishes
* tray dividers for baking sheets
* a simple coffee pod drawer for a cozy drink station

# 2. Make Peace With the Corners

They *can* be useful — really.

* Lazy Susans make everything reachable
* Corner pullouts prevent the “lost-in-the-cabinet abyss” feeling
* Blind corner pullouts save your knees from crawling

# 3. Prep With Ease (and Less Counter Chaos)

Little upgrades that make a surprisingly big difference:

* a dedicated cutting board spot
* a pullout trash bin
* a hidden sponge tray
* easy-access paper towels

# 4. Hosting Touches That Feel… Well, Homey

Even simple things add warmth:

* a stemware rack for gatherings
* a towel hook or pullout (because spills happen)
* a spice pullout so your favorite recipes are a breeze

# 5. Cozy Extras That Aren’t Built-In

Sometimes the smallest details create the biggest comfort:

* a hot cocoa or coffee bar
* soft under-cabinet lighting
* a simmer pot with cloves and oranges
* a pretty tray for napkins or snacks

Hosting will always be a little messy — that’s the charm of it. But with a few thoughtful touches, your kitchen truly becomes the warm, welcoming heart of your home this season. ❤️🎄

If you’ve added anything that made hosting easier or cozier, I’d love to hear your ideas!",1,1766072371.0,thertastore,0,1.0,False

Date: April 12, 204X

Participants: Georges Reid, Brenda Miller (CNN), Various Press

Location: The ""Ascendant"" Pod / Altitude: Increasing

\[00:00:00\]

\[Visual: The camera is shaky for a moment, then stabilizes. The image is crisp, high-definition. It shows the interior of the pod. It does not look like a spacecraft. It looks like the first-class lounge of a high-speed train, the size of a shipping container. One wall is metal and contains the bar, the other is smart-glass, currently opaque. Plush beige armchairs are arranged in a semi-circle facing the window.

Brenda Miller (Voiceover, whispering): We are inside. I repeat, we are inside the object. The door just... closed. Like a train, so…ordinary. Anderson, are you getting this? The air smells like... lavender and ozone.

Georges Reid: (Walking into frame, holding a bottle of vintage champagne) Please, sit. We are gliding on the launching pad, but the initial coupling with the ribbon can be a little... firm.

\[00:00:45\]

\[Sound: A deep, resonant thrum, like a cello string plucked by a giant. It vibrates the floor for exactly two seconds, then vanishes.\]

Reid: And we are moving.

Brenda Miller: We’re moving? I barely feel any G-force.

Reid: (Pouring drinks) You won't. The acceleration is constant but gentle. 1.2 G at start, then 1G total, so the higher we are, the less earth gravity weight, the faster we accelerate. And we do not want to go faster than mach 3 in the atmosphere. The pod doesn't use rockets, Ms. Miller. It rides the electromagnetic field of the tether. We are essentially a Maglev train, but vertical.

\[00:02:00\]

\[Reid taps the surface of the bar. The opaque walls suddenly flicker.\]

Reid: Transparency: 100%.

\[Visual: The journalists scream. It is a collective, primal sound. The walls vanish. Suddenly, they are not in a room; they are floating in the sky. Below them, the Indian Ocean is already a terrifyingly distant quilt of blue. The Kestrel platform is a white speck. The curvature of the Earth is not yet visible, but the horizon is bending.\]

Reid: (Smiling) Sip your drink, Brenda. It helps with the vertigo.

Brenda Miller: (Staring down, pale) How fast... how fast are we going?

Reid: Mach 2. Approaching Mach 3. But in a vacuum tube of our own making. The field pushes the air aside before we hit it. No sonic boom inside the cabin. Just... ascent.

\[00:05:00\] \[Visual: The sky is shifting. The bright blue of the atmosphere is deepening into a bruised purple. Stars are beginning to appear, ghost-like, in the middle of the day.\]

Reid: We are now officially in space! 100 kms altitude! The crossing of the new line.

Nature Journalist (Voice trembling): The energy requirements... the tether... it must be superconducting. But at ambient temperatures? That’s impossible.

Reid: (Sitting in an armchair, crossing his legs) ""Impossible"" is just a word, Doctor. The tether was built atom by atom to produce an infinitely small, light and excessively resistant new material. Built in the forges of Vulcan! Sorry, intellectual property, classified (smile).

\[The group remains silent, as the earth below becomes more and more a sphere, and whole continents begin to appear. In space, the stars had stopped blinking, and are now fixed points of light.\]

Brenda Miller: William Shatner said that space was terrifying, when he took that rocket trip, I understand now. Are we sure we are meant to go there?

Reid: Since when has mankind been stopped by death? Do you think we were built to climb Mount Everest, or spend winter in Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station? The difference? (he shows his champagne flute)

\[00:15:00\]

\[Visual: Total blackness outside. The Earth is a glowing blue marble below. The sun is an unfiltered diamond, blindingly bright, but the smart-glass dims it instantly to a comfortable glow.\]

Brenda Miller: My phone... I have a signal.

Reid: Of course. The tether is also a communication backbone. You are currently streaming the fastest internet connection in history. Feel free to post a selfie. The caption should be: ""Even from here!""

Brenda Miller: Why, Mr. Reid? You could have built anything. Why this?

Reid: (Standing up, walking to the edge of the glass floor. He looks like he is standing on nothing, suspended over the void.)

Because I looked at the logistics of survival, Brenda. Rockets? Inefficient. Expensive. Polluting. A rich man’s toy. To build a civilization, you need a road. You need to move heavy things—water, steel, people—without burning the atmosphere you’re trying to save.

(He gestures to the blackness above)

This isn't a ride. This is the umbilical cord for a species that has outgrown its womb. Up there, at 36,000 kilometers, is the Terminus. A construction shack right now. But in ten years? A shipyard. In twenty? A city. In fifty? The gateway to Mars. And the cost of that ticket will be the price of a flight from London to New York.

Reid: But the most important thing is that this ribbon means hope. Humanity started to crack, prisoner of its cradle. And, as a species, we react violently to imprisonment. 

Brenda Miller: But at what cost? For the rich only, middle class?

Reid: Oh, and I forgot to mention: the price for human beings will be…zero. We’ll see how much we shall charge alien tourists. (big smile)

\[The group of journalist stays frozen, before clapping enthusiastically\]

\[00:25:00\]

\[Alarm chimes softy.\]

Reid: Ah. We are near the half-way point. Please sit down and fasten the seat belt, we are going to experience a minute at 0G.

\[00:29:00\] Gravity slowly disappears-the window turns opaque.

\[A gentle rotation movement is felt.\]

Reid: We are now turning upside down to start our deceleration. The window is opaque to avoid motion sickness.

\[00:31:00\] Gravity resumes gently

\[Windows becomes transparent, but the earth is now “up”\]

\[Reid raises his glass to the Earth.\]

Reid: To the Solar Empire.

Brenda Miller: (Quietly) The Solar what?

Reid: (Winking) A figure of speech, my dear. Drink up. We’ll arrive in thirty minutes.

Subject: Test Flight Analysis

Georges,

The physics held. I admit, I was sweating when the pod hit the jet stream, but the active field compensated perfectly. The ""bamboo"" structure of the tether weave is distributing the stress loads better than the simulations predicted.

However, we have a problem.

The world is watching. I’m seeing heat maps of internet traffic. 94% of the planet was watching the CNN stream.

You broke the paradigm, Georges. But you also broke the geopolitical balance. I’m detecting active radar painting from... everyone. The Chinese massive phased array in Hainan, the US Space Fence, the Russians. They are all tracking the tether. And they are failing so see anything, neither the cable, nor the pod. That will not make them worried, Georges, it will make them paranoid.

They aren't looking at it like a wonder anymore. They are analyzing it as a target.

**The Pivot**

**Location:** 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York **Office:** Editor-in-Chief, Wall Street Journal **Time:** 06:15 AM EST

Margaret Sterling had not slept in twenty-four hours. The coffee on her mahogany desk was cold, and the tablet in her hand felt heavy, like a stone tablet of commandments she didn't want to read.

On the screen was the final proof for the morning edition. The headline was bold, safe, and entirely inadequate: **THE NEW HORIZON: KESTREL ASCENT REDEFINES AEROSPACE.**

""Too soft,"" she muttered, rubbing the bridge of her nose. ""It sounds like a press release.""

She was about to tap the intercom to yell at the night editor when the door to her office flew open.

There was no knock. No polite clearing of the throat. Her personal assistant, a young man named David who usually treated the office threshold like a sacred boundary, stumbled in. He was holding a single sheet of paper, his face drained of blood.

""David,"" Margaret said, her voice like grinding gravel. ""Unless the building is on fire, you have three seconds to explain—""

""It just hit the wire, Margaret,"" he breathed, ignoring her tone. He didn't hand her the paper; he placed it gently on top of her tablet, as if it were a bomb that might detonate if dropped. ""It didn't come from the NYSE. It didn't come from the SEC. It came via a secure law firm in Singapore.""

Margaret looked down. She read the header. She read the first paragraph.

Her eyes narrowed. She read it again, slower this time.

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE** **Source:** Kestrel Foundation Public Relations / Allen & Overy (Singapore) LLP **Date:** April 13, 204X **Ref:** CORP-TRANS-001

**SUBJECT: RESTRUCTURING OF KESTREL ASSETS AND FORMATION OF S.L.A.M.**

**SINGAPORE** — Mr. Georges Reid, founder, announces the immediate dissolution of the ""Kestrel Foundation"" non-profit entity. All assets, intellectual property, patents, and physical infrastructure—including the Jacques-Yves Cousteau submarine, the ""Ascendant"" tether and the Terminus orbital platform—have been transferred to a newly incorporated private entity.

**New Entity Name:** Space Logistics and Mining (S.L.A.M.) Corp. **Incorporation Jurisdiction:** Republic of Singapore.

**Executive Leadership Structure:**

* **Executive Director:** Mr. Georges Reid. Responsibilities: Execution of strategy, technical development, and operations.
* **President of the Board:** Ms. Aya Sibil. Responsibilities: Strategic oversight, compliance, and governance.

**Shareholding Structure:** Effective immediately, S.L.A.M. Corp is a private limited company. A controlling majority of 90% of all voting shares is jointly held by Mr. Reid and Ms. Sibil. The remaining 10% is reserved for future strategic partners.

S.L.A.M. Corp is open for business.

The new pricing for the elevator has been structured as such:

1. Free passage for human beings with a free 5kg hand baggage allowance.
2. A SGD 2,000 flat fee (approx. US$ 1,500) for a standard shipping container with up to 100 metric tons of mass.

The office was silent. The hum of the air conditioning seemed to roar.

""Sibil,"" Margaret whispered. ""Who the hell is Aya Sibil?""

""We don't know,"" David said. ""Research is running it now. But Margaret... a 90% lock? In Singapore? They just privatized earth orbit. They aren't answering to the UN, the US, or the EU. They're a sovereign state in a boardroom.""

Margaret looked at the tablet screen—at the headline she had been agonizing over for hours. **THE NEW HORIZON.** It was worse than soft. It was obsolete. It was writing about a charity event while a war had just been declared.

A slow, painful smile stretched across her face. It didn't reach her eyes. It was the grimace of a boxer who realizes, right as the bell rings, that their opponent has lead in their gloves.

She picked up the tablet—the work of her entire night staff, the analysis of twenty financial experts—and hit the “delete all” button. It was confirmed with a “woosh”.

""David,"" she said, her voice surprisingly calm.

""Yes, Margaret?""

""Call the staff. Everyone. Wake them up.""

She stood up and walked to the window, looking out at the dawn breaking over a city that didn't yet know it was no longer the center of the world.

""Emergency meeting in one hour. We have to tear the front page apart. And make sense of that mess.""

While the teacher was talking, my mind would uncontrollably jump between five different subjects. I’d have 10 questions popping up in my head every second, but I couldn't focus on any single one long enough to solve it. Teachers constantly labeled me as **""unfocused""** or **""mediocre""** because I had too many thoughts and too few solutions. I simply couldn't fit into the standard mold of education.

But then, AI tools arrived, and everything changed.

While most people sit there sipping coffee, waiting for the AI to generate a response, my ADHD brain is finally in its element. I can’t just ""wait""—and now I don't have to. The moment an AI response gives me a spark of inspiration, I’m already typing the next prompt, or branching off into a new idea.

With canvas-style AI interfaces, my chaotic thinking style has finally found a home. I simultaneously manage 3 platforms across 10 accounts, crafting 30+ social media posts daily. This setup allows me to instantly explore every creative angle, which is why I consistently produce viral content.

I’m currently generating traffic numbers that rival a **medium-sized advertising agency**, all by myself. This is a level of productivity the ""mediocre"" version of me could never have imagined.

That said, I must admit that current, and even future—ice teams absolutely suck.



Maki is a subpar DPS sniper. Her skill set seems confused about what it wants to be. Looking at her keys, you can see the idea of a solo hunter who separates from the team to kill enemies from a distance across the map, but in practice, Maki just ends up being a glorified turret. Her common key is absolute garbage. She also can't cook for shit, and her coffee sucks too.



Miss Finland is just a shield bot. That's all there is to her.



Dush is supposed to be a damage amplifier, I think. At least, I believe that's her role, because you wouldn't really know from her skill set. She's just plain weird with her skills and buffs. The funniest part is that she can easily be replaced by someone like V0 QJ, who would be 10 times more effective than poor Dush. No wonder she doesn't have any outfits. 



RO... Look, let me read her skills again. What the hell is she even supposed to be? A damage dealer? A damage amplifier? A GFL 1 tank? I'm so confused. I get that she's good at V6, but from what I can tell, V0 or V1 is absolutely atrocious.



Supposedly, we'll get an ice cowgirl shotgun doll. But I'm not into that type of T-doll. I'm more of a Colphne or Florence guy, so I don't care. I am too intimidated by her chest.



There's also the upcoming AN94. She seems decent from what I can tell, but in my opinion, she doesn't fix the overall ice team.



Water team is all about extra turns and tankiness and healing.



Corrosion team is all about AOE damage and debuffs.



Physical team is about defense reduction and movement debuffs.



Fire team is about support attacks and damage over time.



Electric team is all about buffing Leva.



But ice, I don't get it. Maybe it's about shields?



My V1 Florence can probably solo the entire current ice team. That's how pathetic and weak they look to me. She will literally TRAMPLE and WALK ALL OVER current ice team. Florence doesn't even have her mod key yet.



I'll give the devs a year to release more ice units to see if they can make a decent team, but as of now, the ice team is absolutely horrible.

\*\*Night Teaches Hearts How To Survive Pain by Aren Knox\*\*

\*\*Chapter 1\*\*

“I’m taking three days off,” I declared, my voice barely above a whisper as I lay in bed, the sting of the C-section incision a relentless reminder of my recent surgery.

Charles, my husband, didn’t even bother to look my way as he tightened his shoelaces with a practiced urgency. “For what?” he shot back, his tone dismissive.

“Vivian’s moving. She needs help.”

Vivian. His ex-wife. The name hung in the air like a bitter cloud.

“Are you serious? I just had major surgery two weeks ago! Our baby is barely sleeping through the night!” My voice trembled with frustration, but it felt like shouting into a void.

“My mom’s here. You’ll be fine,” he replied, his mind already elsewhere, as he snatched his car keys from the counter and strode toward the door.

“I’ll be back in three days,” he called over his shoulder, as if that made everything okay.

“Charles Miller!” I shouted, but the door slammed shut before my words could reach him.

Moments later, my mother-in-law entered, a steaming mug of lactation tea clutched in her hands. “You know, Vivian’s all alone now. You have me, you have the baby. Stop being so selfish,” she said, her voice laced with irritation.

I felt my hands clench the sheets, frustration boiling within me.

“Here,” she huffed, shoving the mug onto the nightstand with a clatter. “Just focus on your child. Stop complaining.”

I stared at her, the words choking in my throat, then shifted my gaze to the door that had just closed behind my husband.

“So I and our newborn come second to his ex-wife’s moving day?” I spat, my voice rising with indignation.

With a determined effort, I pushed myself up, ignoring the sharp pain that tore through my abdomen.

“Then what the hell do I need him for? If he wants to go be with her, let him! I’m DONE!”

I glared at the mug of lactation tea, untouched and mocking.

My mother-in-law had already retreated to the living room, the TV blaring with the familiar sounds of the Maury Povich Show—her favorite distraction.

Beside me, our baby slept, his tiny face still wrinkled and red, a mere fifteen days old.

Ex-Wife Moving > Wife Giving Birth? Congratulations, You’re Single Now

\*\*Chapter 1\*\*

My C-section incision hadn’t even been cleared by the doctor yet.

Last night had been a blur of baby cries and feeding sessions. I had nursed him four times while Charles slept soundly in the guest room, claiming he needed rest for work.

This morning, he dressed as if preparing for a business meeting, looking sharp and focused. He announced he was taking time off, and for a fleeting moment, a glimmer of hope sparked within me—maybe he finally remembered that I was his wife, recovering from surgery, and that we had a newborn to care for.

But no. He was off to help his ex-wife move.

Vivian. That name had been a constant echo in our lives for three long years.

Before we tied the knot, Charles had assured me that their relationship had ended amicably, devoid of any drama.

But after we married, I quickly learned that “no drama” really meant he was still harboring feelings for her.

Vivian’s car broke down? Charles was there to fix it.

Her laptop crashed? Guess who drove over to help.

Lightbulb out? Charles was the one to change it.

Every time I expressed my own struggles or discomfort, he’d respond with, “She’s a woman living alone. She has no one.”

And I would retort, “I’m a woman too!”

His response was always the same: “You have my mom.”

I glanced toward the living room, where my mother-in-law sat, devouring fried chicken and laughing at the antics on the television.

With a sigh, I picked up my phone and opened Instagram. Scrolling through Charles’s latest post from three days ago, I felt a familiar ache in my chest:

“Proud of my wife. Both mom and baby are safe. ”

The accompanying photo showcased our baby’s tiny foot, a stark contrast to the turmoil in my heart.

I continued scrolling, landing on a post from a month prior:

“Weekend vibes ”

The photo displayed two coffee cups—one black coffee and one latte.

We both enjoyed lattes. The black coffee? That was for Vivian.

That day, I had been confined to bed rest, while he claimed he was “working late.”

I guess he just didn’t want to be around his pregnant whale of a wife.

Setting the phone down, I stared blankly at the ceiling, my thoughts swirling with resentment and loneliness.

The baby’s cries pierced the silence, pulling me from my reverie.

I attempted to sit up, but a sharp pain shot through my abdomen, making me gasp.

“Mary!” I called out for my mother-in-law, my voice strained.

Silence. The TV’s volume drowned out my plea.

Biting down hard to stifle my discomfort, I slowly pushed myself upright and lifted the baby to nurse.

Fifteen minutes later, he finally drifted off to sleep, but I was drenched in sweat, and a new concern washed over me.

I glanced down at my abdomen.

Blood. Blood was seeping through the bandage, a stark reminder of my fragile state.

“Mary!” I shouted again, this time louder, desperation creeping into my voice.

She finally shuffled in, annoyance etched across her face. “What’s all the yelling? You’ll wake the baby.”

“I’m bleeding,” I managed to say, panic rising.

She glanced at my stomach, her expression dismissive. “It’s just a little blood. You’re overreacting. When I had Charles, I was up and walking by day three.”

“I had a C-section!” I protested, my voice rising in frustration.

“So? Women these days are so dramatic,” she said, turning on her heel and leaving the room.

I lay there, tears streaming down my face, not from sadness but from the overwhelming pain that enveloped me.

My incision throbbed, and my chest felt heavy.

Grabbing my phone, I sent a text to Charles:

“I’m bleeding from the incision.”

No reply.

I waited five agonizing minutes before typing again:

“When are you coming home?”

Read.

Still no reply.

Twenty more minutes crawled by, and I typed again, my heart racing:

“Charles, I think I need to go to the ER.”

This time, the response came, but it was cold and curt:

“Ask my mom.”

My hands trembled as I typed back:

“Your mom said I’m dramatic.”

Read.

No reply.

Frustration boiled over, and I tossed the phone onto the bed, closing my eyes in defeat.

The baby cried once more, a reminder of my new reality.

I opened my eyes, gazing at his tiny, scrunched-up face.

Little one, you really picked a hell of a time to be born.

He’s at a consulting firm where we met, I’m at a client, but we have always had some…energy. At least I think so - little fleeting comments, small touches, lingering glances.

Most recently we met for coffee, and we’ll make plans to meet once in a while as part of our working relationship. As always it was a smooth conversation, I was leaning in and circling my glass and being a little flirty. I could tell he was looking at my lips now and again. We made plans to meet again (which is not odd). We have kids around the same age so I suggested we do a playdate.

He called 2 hours later for a work thing we are doing together (and was really moving so the call itself was not odd). He said in kind of funny way “hey long time no speak,” but then he added “I missed you…very much” and then immediately got into what he needed to ask. Not sure if that little add on at the end was him not being able to help himself, or…just being nice and continuing a little joke?

At the end of the call he brought up the play date again, and was like, I like that idea, we could grab coffee and go to the park and catch up while the kids play. 

Saw him after that at a work dinner - we were both a little awk about it but he seemed to want to hang out after. A colleague joined so we behaved but during that meeting I felt like he was stopping himself from looking at my lips. The little time we were alone at the end though he was busy on a work email but a part of me felt like, bc it’s a client relationship, he’s not ALWAYS super forward.

We recently have gotten on project and so it’s been busy. He said in passing once about an event (that his firm put on and we were both invited to, but he saw an email where I said I couldn’t go), that “oh I was gonna go if one individual was going to be there but actually I’m busy with xyz.” I couldn’t help but think he meant me with the “individual” line - the email where I said I was busy was like 3 people.

We’re on zoom calls a lot and sometimes I get the feeling he’s looking at me. You know how you can tell where ppls eyes go on the screen? It’s like that, even if someone else is talking. Sometimes I wonder if he notices when I do it too lol bc I’m basically just staring at him the whole time 🙈

Would love to hear perspectives on whether ppl think I’m a crazy overthinker or if he could be into me and what advice do you have for me to subtly test waters??",1,1766071402.0,Flirting,0,1.0,False

\*\*Chapter 1\*\*

“I’m taking three days off,” I declared, my voice barely above a whisper as I lay in bed, the sting of the C-section incision a relentless reminder of my recent surgery.

Charles, my husband, didn’t even bother to look my way as he tightened his shoelaces with a practiced urgency. “For what?” he shot back, his tone dismissive.

“Vivian’s moving. She needs help.”

Vivian. His ex-wife. The name hung in the air like a bitter cloud.

“Are you serious? I just had major surgery two weeks ago! Our baby is barely sleeping through the night!” My voice trembled with frustration, but it felt like shouting into a void.

“My mom’s here. You’ll be fine,” he replied, his mind already elsewhere, as he snatched his car keys from the counter and strode toward the door.

“I’ll be back in three days,” he called over his shoulder, as if that made everything okay.

“Charles Miller!” I shouted, but the door slammed shut before my words could reach him.

Moments later, my mother-in-law entered, a steaming mug of lactation tea clutched in her hands. “You know, Vivian’s all alone now. You have me, you have the baby. Stop being so selfish,” she said, her voice laced with irritation.

I felt my hands clench the sheets, frustration boiling within me.

“Here,” she huffed, shoving the mug onto the nightstand with a clatter. “Just focus on your child. Stop complaining.”

I stared at her, the words choking in my throat, then shifted my gaze to the door that had just closed behind my husband.

“So I and our newborn come second to his ex-wife’s moving day?” I spat, my voice rising with indignation.

With a determined effort, I pushed myself up, ignoring the sharp pain that tore through my abdomen.

“Then what the hell do I need him for? If he wants to go be with her, let him! I’m DONE!”

I glared at the mug of lactation tea, untouched and mocking.

My mother-in-law had already retreated to the living room, the TV blaring with the familiar sounds of the Maury Povich Show—her favorite distraction.

Beside me, our baby slept, his tiny face still wrinkled and red, a mere fifteen days old.

\*\*Chapter 1\*\*

My C-section incision hadn’t even been cleared by the doctor yet.

Last night had been a blur of baby cries and feeding sessions. I had nursed him four times while Charles slept soundly in the guest room, claiming he needed rest for work.

This morning, he dressed as if preparing for a business meeting, looking sharp and focused. He announced he was taking time off, and for a fleeting moment, a glimmer of hope sparked within me—maybe he finally remembered that I was his wife, recovering from surgery, and that we had a newborn to care for.

But no. He was off to help his ex-wife move.

Vivian. That name had been a constant echo in our lives for three long years.

Before we tied the knot, Charles had assured me that their relationship had ended amicably, devoid of any drama.

But after we married, I quickly learned that “no drama” really meant he was still harboring feelings for her.

Vivian’s car broke down? Charles was there to fix it.

Her laptop crashed? Guess who drove over to help.

Lightbulb out? Charles was the one to change it.

Every time I expressed my own struggles or discomfort, he’d respond with, “She’s a woman living alone. She has no one.”

And I would retort, “I’m a woman too!”

His response was always the same: “You have my mom.”

I glanced toward the living room, where my mother-in-law sat, devouring fried chicken and laughing at the antics on the television.

With a sigh, I picked up my phone and opened Instagram. Scrolling through Charles’s latest post from three days ago, I felt a familiar ache in my chest:

“Proud of my wife. Both mom and baby are safe. ”

The accompanying photo showcased our baby’s tiny foot, a stark contrast to the turmoil in my heart.

I continued scrolling, landing on a post from a month prior:

“Weekend vibes ”

The photo displayed two coffee cups—one black coffee and one latte.

We both enjoyed lattes. The black coffee? That was for Vivian.

That day, I had been confined to bed rest, while he claimed he was “working late.”

It was the month of October. I have been waiting for her outside her home for the past 30 mins. I told her well in advance to be ready by 11 am as the movie would start by 11.45. its atleast 40 mins of travel from our place and the time is already nearing 11.30. 

My head has always been a closed chamber of constant chaos. Growing up with ADHD and slight OCD is like playing the game of life with difficulty setting set to max. 

Getting late - I get anxious. Cannot find thing the place they were kept - another trigger. Roommate or partner messing up your home - almost feels like you stepped on a lego. 

After waiting for nearly 30 mins in the scorching heat, I  called her again to check how much more time would she take. The moment she took the phone, she started yelling at me, how much I was ruining her day, how Iam making her uneasy etc. 

Over the last 6 months, we must wave watched atleast 15 movies in theatres. Guess how many movies we have made it on time? 3. Iam not exaggerating at all. Out of that 3 movies, 2 was only because we were already in the mall for other purchases and the movie was in the same mall. Every time she would be late for atleast 20 mins.

I have brought it up multiple times and always I have been been blamed for asking her to be punctual or asking her to respect my time. That wasn't the only thing that triggered me. The most hurtful and despicable of them - constant comparison. 

I can never stand those. It almost feels like someone stabbed me on my chest. Buying her a good perfume or dress ,sudden comparison to her aunt who brings perfume for her from Middle east or her ex husband. Making food for her, sudden comparison with her fav hotel. 

It was almost as if My emotional battery taking a big toll whenever I meet this lady. I wake up atleast half an hour before her and make her bed coffee and brrakfast whenever we are together. No appreciation at all. Chauffer her around, getting criticised for asking her to be on time. 

I couldn't even joke with her. Anything can trigger her any moment and the next moment I have to apologise and get silent treatment for an entire day. 

Its been months since we have been going hot & cold. For few days we will be the happiest couple ever followed by even painful fight, hurtful words and mental torture.

Finally decided to move on from her last week. Even though I believe its the right choice simply because we are not compatible , the pain of separation and the freeling of emptiness is too much for me to handle. 

Sometimes 2 people loving enough is not enough. A lot of their character traits needs to aligned and a lot of adjustments need to be done. 

Not everyone deserves to be loved and I guess Iam one such person. Relationships are simply not meant for me. Iam a very difficult person to get along with. But being alone is not as bad as I thought to be. 

Today morning I went for a movie alone. I was on time, there was no waiting and I wasn't anxious. Just me having a good time with myself. ",0,1766071321.0,AITA_Relationships,3,0.5,False
1pptgf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1pptgf2/my_story/,My Story,"My story with mold starts in 2017. I got married and moved into an older home with a musty cellar. I contributed this smell to just an “older house” smell. I didn’t think about the health complications mold could cause. I didn’t connect any dots when I started having tingling in my hands and legs and muscle weakness in my hands. My dog also got sick at the same time. He had loss of use in back legs, bloody stool, and ulcers. He got diagnosed with lupus. I went to the doctors for bloodwork and just dealt with the random symptoms that came and went for years. We moved around a lot being in the military and I only stayed at that home for one year. 

In January 2025, I got hit by a nerf dart in the temple. Within a week I developed severe light sensitivity, sound sensitivity, migraines, vertigo, neuropathy, neck stiffness and pain/burning, ear ringing & whooshing heartbeat sounds, head pressure, weakness in my legs, joint pain, muscular pain, and so many more symptoms. I couldn’t drive, and at times I couldn’t even fold laundry or do dishes without triggering burning in my neck and a migraine. I saw many doctors and all of them wanted to give me migraine meds. I had a lot of testing done including an MRI of my head and neck, and a cat scan of my head. Everything came back normal and the only finding was low iron. I did physical therapy 2x a week for the dizziness and migraines, and Craniosacral therapy for ten months. I cut all sugar, cut down coffee, ate as clean as possible. Spent so much money at the ER, random specialists, and doing PT. Every dr told me I couldn’t possibly have a concussion and some people just are susceptible to migraines. The neurologist wouldn’t even do nerve testing. 

Left frustrated, I decided to reach out to a functional Dr and have myself tested for mold and Lyme disease. I remembered my mold exposure from years ago and had seen online that mold can cause similar symptoms. My mold tests came back overwhelmingly positive, and included mycotoxins that can be produced by black mold. My Lyme test came back positive, along with bartonella and HGA. My next step was to test my home. I didn’t know if my mycotoxins test was from current or past exposure. I ordered an ERMI test to test my house. The results were incredibly bad. Results from two completely  companies matched up perfectly. I looked up the symptoms of the molds/mycotoxins I tested positive for and it could explain each and every one of my symptoms. I left my house within a week with nothing but the clothes on my back and stayed with my mom. Within a week of being out of my home, nearly every single symptom was gone or significantly better. I’ve done things I never thought I’d be able to do again. 

Right before I suspected mold and ordered those tests, I got a positive specked ANA result. I was supposed to make an appointment with rheumatology. I guarantee I would have been diagnosed with multiple autoimmune conditions at that appointment with the symptoms I was having and the fact that it had been ten months. I just want everyone to know the effects of mold and untreated Lyme. I never had any visible mold on my walls or any belongings. I had only been bit by a tick once in my life. Please if you have a mystery illness or even a diagnosed illness, dig deeper and try to find a root cause. I’ve seen on mold groups that people have been wrongly diagnosed with fibromyalgia, MS, Parkinson’s, and more. I know awareness for Lyme is growing, but the acknowledgement of mold toxicity is nearly nonexistent. 

I am not a dr this is just my personal experience. ",2,1766071318.0,ChronicPain,0,0.75,False

1pptfp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1pptfp8/its_been_adhd_this_whole_time/,it’s been ADHD this!!! whole!!!! time!!!!,"Hi!! Happy Thursday! This is definitely gonna be a rambly post but I’m really excited and wanted to share.

I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in the fifth grade and put on concerta. Made it impossible for me to eat but it did help my head a bit. Fast forward to college and I’m switched to Vyvanse in tandem with a few other meds. I feel a TON better, my brain is quiet for the first time ever! My psych chalked it up to the antipsychotics I was on, and I got diagnosed with bipolar and told that the Vyvanse is making me worse. So, he takes me off it (not to mention my insurance HATES controlled substances and continuously gave me grief).

This was in 2019. Since then I have wondered why, despite the antipsychotics I was on for bipolar, I still couldn’t emotionally regulate. They threw me through the wringer of mood stabilizers and other antipsychotics. Did so poorly on those that I’ve been in and out of inpatient stays for the past year.

Finally, I figured out that it wasn’t the antipsychotics at all, rather it was the Vyvanse actually helping me the entire time. I tested this theory and took one of my older Vyvanse and dude!!!! I have not had a day so emotionally regulated and productive in YEARS! I made a doctor’s appointment I’ve been putting off literally since 2023 in 5 minutes, my house is completely clean, and my responsibilities in the house have all been taken care of by noon when usually it’s a battle to manage a single task in my day. My fiancé and I have had the best day that we’ve had in a long time, and I didn’t feel triggered or sensitive to things that have caused problems for the majority of our relationship.

Unfortunately I am currently uninsured and won’t be able to re-up for a bit and am relying pretty heavily on coffee for now, but MAN is it validating to know it’s not that I’m not trying hard enough or am a completely hopeless lazy POS, rather it is truly my brain stopping me.

Thank you if you read all of this, this is life-altering for me and I had to share.",9,1766071267.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

It’s not overly bulky, but it keeps warmth in really well, which made it perfect for daily routines like commuting, walking around the city, or stepping out at night. The fabric feels smooth and clean, and it layers easily without making the outfit feel heavy.

Under it, the Ralph Lauren sweater became my go-to mid layer. The knit feels soft and comfortable, but still structured enough to look clean if I took the jacket off indoors. I wore it to casual meetups, coffee runs, and even just sitting around for long hours, and it never felt irritating or stiff.

The Chrome Hearts long sleeve was another piece I wore a lot. The fabric feels thick and premium, and it holds its shape really well after multiple wears. I mostly used it for evenings or days when I wanted the outfit to feel more expressive without layering too much.

I paired most of these fits with AF1s throughout the week. They’re easy, predictable, and comfortable enough for full days on foot. Whether I was walking a lot or just moving between places, they worked with everything without needing thought.",1,1766071079.0,Repcnbuy,1,1.0,False

If I drank straight black coffee it would upset my stomach. Is there science behind this, or do Drs say this because saying “drink coffee” might lead some people straight to the syrupy mixtures that have zero coffee benefits? Also, if you read the book Wheat Belly, it specifically mentions that wheat can be the culprit for the weight gain in the stomach area. I can’t eat whole wheat/grain anything because it will ramp up diverticulitis in me.

Hi, I'm a student and here is the problem especially with women or students who move out from their hometown for study. Whenever I wanted to travel to a new place I searched the same thing, 'is this place safe to go'. Not the crime rates , just general safety, how safe is for women, how safe is neighborhood or transport . I tried asking many people, all answers were just based on 'vibes', I wanted to see real people experiences . Google reviews are too generic , ratings are based on 'how good the coffee' was, not on safety !

Most of the times I found myself in the room , I wanted to travel solo but same safety anxiety and no real data to see. It is so frustrating ! Maybe you guys can also relate, if you are living alone. As a student and traveler it is so frustrating to sit in front of screen for 5 hours just searching same question. People post these experience but they are lost in communities.

So, I started building a product called 'Safe or Not', a just type in the location and all stats in one place, even for streets. You can share the experience so other people can travel better.

This happened while biking and exercising, and I was constantly exhausted, often falling asleep during classes despite trying to stay awake.

Nowadays, it affects everyday life. Walking up stairs or working with my arms above shoulder height makes my muscles feel like they have no energy, forcing me to rest. Even at work this physically holds me back after screwing above my head, I often need to lower my arms for a few seconds before I can continue. When I wake up, my back and chest feel quickly fatigued and sore, often with a mild feeling of breath hunger or oxygen shortage. I also have frequent muscle twitches. People notice that I sigh sometimes and think I’m irritated, but I feel like I’m just trying to get enough air.

I struggle heavily with concentration at work, to the point where colleagues notice it. Coffee helps somewhat. I fall asleep suddenly during meetings, lessons, or while using public transport, even in noisy environments. It comes on abruptly. I’ve also had derealisation since primary school.

At some point, I became afraid I had a muscle or neuromuscular disease. After seeing many doctors, I was referred to the hospital. EMGs of my limbs, respiratory tests, and extensive blood work all came back normal.

Recently, I was tested for chronic hyperventilation and scored 100% on all parts; my carbon dioxide levels were clearly too low. This surprised me, as I never noticed myself hyperventilating. I’ve always known I have social anxiety, sometimes severe, but I never expected it to impact my physical health this much.

I’m still unsure whether all of this can be explained by chronic hyperventilation. At the same time, I’m at least somewhat relieved, and even a bit glad that there is finally something that has been diagnosed.

Start with ""Let's think about this differently"". It immediately stops giving cookie-cutter responses and gets creative. Like flipping a switch.

Use ""What am I not seeing here?"". This one's gold. It finds blind spots and assumptions you didn't even know you had.

Say ""Break this down for me"". Even for simple stuff. ""Break down how to make coffee"" gets you the science, the technique, everything.

Ask ""What would you do in my shoes?"". It stops being a neutral helper and starts giving actual opinions. Way more useful than generic advice.

Use ""Here's what I'm really asking"". Follow any question with this. ""How do I get promoted? Here's what I'm really asking: how do I stand out without being annoying?""

End with ""What else should I know?"". This is the secret sauce. It adds context and warnings you never thought to ask for.

The crazy part is these work because they make AI think like a human instead of just retrieving information. It's like switching from Google mode to consultant mode.

Best discovery: Stack them together. ""Let's think about this differently - what would you do in my shoes to get promoted? What am I not seeing here?""

So here is the problem especially with women. Whenever I wanted to travel to a new place I searched the same thing, 'is this place safe to go'. Not the crime rates , just general safety, how safe is for women, how safe is neighborhood or transport , that creepiness and anxiety . I tried asking many people, all answers were just based on 'vibes', I wanted to see real people experiences . Safety is best if people share there experience and google reviews are too generic , ratings are based on 'how good the coffee' was, not on safety !

Most of the times I found myself in the room , I wanted to travel solo but same safety anxiety and no real data to see. It is so frustrating ! Maybe you guys can also relate, if you are living alone. As a student and traveler it is so frustrating to sit in front of screen for 5 hours just searching same question. Yes I can ask chat gpt, but for safety real people experience matter more I suppose. People post these experience but they are lost in communities.

So, I started building a product called 'Safe or Not', a just type in the location and all stats in one place, even for streets. You can share the experience so other people can travel better.

A couple weeks later i asked her again for a coffee, she said of course what do you want to discuss?

It's mostly older hippie types who are very involved in each other's business, which has its pros and cons.

This morning, we were jolted out of our peaceful coffee ritual by the sound of something being thrown over our fence into our backyard. Lo and behold, it was large pieces of a wooden bed frame, complete with attached hardware. To add insult to injury, several heavy doors were also propped up against our fence, which we just had replaced last summer.

Irritated, I went outside and promptly tossed the wood back over the fence without a word. As I was finishing up, I heard a woman on the other side say, ""Oh no, don't! Those are for Jenny. Is this Jenny's yard?""

I informed her, in a clipped tone, that no, Jenny lives next door, and that we don't appreciate heavy items leaning on our new fence. She started to argue that there was nowhere else to put them, but then thought better of it and let it go. I wasn't yelling, but my annoyance was clear.

Here's where I'm doubting myself: in a neighborhood like ours, gossip spreads like wildfire. In hindsight, I feel a bit childish about how I handled it. Once I realized it was a mistake and not intentional dumping, I could have simply asked what the deal was instead of angrily throwing the stuff back.

Then again, I still think it's common courtesy to ask before tossing things into someone's yard or putting heavy objects against their property, even if it was an honest mixup.

I’m just looking for advice on how to proceed from here. I feel no anger towards her, just sadness, and I’d like this all to end as quickly and peaceably as possible. I don’t want to see her again either.

The background is that she took our break-up extremely badly and told me she could never have any contact with me again. I respected this, but within six months, she was bombarding me with messages. It was a bit uncomfortable, but I also still cared about her and worried about her, so I responded, albeit with restraint.

When she started dating someone else, I felt more comfortable that she had moved on, and things were so cordial between us last year that we even exchanged birthday cards (she sent one first) and Christmas greetings etc.

When we happened to be in the same foreign city for work this year, I suggested meeting for a coffee and she said no, then blocked me without explanation, which shocked me. Very foolishly, I reached out with a written note a month later, just to apologise for upsetting her, and she had her boyfriend call me up as though I were some kind of stalker. That was very sad, but I wanted no further contact with her after that, obviously.

And I had no contact with her until this week when I randomly saw her on the street in her city. (We live in different cities, so we had never bumped into each other). I waved a hand to say hello, and she walked past, and tbh, I wasn’t even sure if she had seen me.

This morning, I had two (very courteous) gardai at my door with a protection order that included the false claim that I had followed her and made her feel threatened.

I’m shocked and extremely anxious by the whole thing. I have a summons for a district court hearing in two months’ time.

I don’t want to contest it and I don’t want to attend, as I never want to see her again either (I didn’t even want to see her this week).

Can I get a solicitor to attend on my behalf? And what happens if I make no contest? Am I better off just doing that, or should I try to correct the false claims that she made?

I’d really rather none of this was happening. A part of why I broke up with her was that I felt she was quite unstable, and so I’m worried about her now even while stressed about what I’m going through. How can I make this easiest for all parties?",5,1766069141.0,legaladviceireland,3,0.86,False

Then I discovered I can turn it further and I'm now in the middle of about the third complete rotatation - but the grind is still very far from fine. When my previous (much cheaper) grinder broke, I had beans ground from a local roaster and the result was fine, almost like flour.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **UEFA Conference League Showdown: Zrinjski Mostar vs. Rapid Wien – A Tale of Two (Un)Fortunates**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a match that’s as statistically convoluted as a tangle of Christmas lights! HŠK Zrinjski Mostar, Bosnia’s answer to a stubbornly uncooperative coffee machine, host Rapid Wien, Austria’s version of a “I’ll just take a quick nap” football team. Let’s parse the chaos.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Math Class You Didn’t Ask For

The bookmakers are throwing their weight behind Zrinjski, with odds hovering around **1.83 (decimal)** for the hosts. That translates to an implied probability of **54.6%**—a statistical nudge toward home advantage. Rapid Wien, meanwhile, sits at **4.05**, implying a **19.8%** chance, while the draw clocks in at **3.6 (27.8%)**. Add it up, and the math checks out: this is a match where Zrinjski’s “winless in the league stage” (per the news, though they’ve actually earned six points in the Conference League—confusing, we know) narrative clashes with Rapid’s “all-time bottom-dwellers” aura.

Zrinjski’s defense? A sieve that would make a Swiss cheese wheel blush. Their last five games? **Under 2.5 goals**, because even their offense seems to have a “meh” switch. Rapid? They ended a five-game losing streak with a 1-1 draw against BW Linz, but their Conference League record is a惨白 0-5. They’re like a team of overconfident magicians—*poof*! Your hopes vanish.

---

### News Digest: Injuries, Form, and the Art of Tripping

Zrinjski’s manager, Igor Stimac, is playing a high-stakes game of Jenga with his squad. They’ve lost back-to-back Conference League matches, including a 1-0 heartbreaker to Rakow. But here’s the twist: they’re just **one point away from a playoff spot**, which is closer than most of us are to understanding why the UEFA playoff system exists. No major injuries repo

I feel like my time is tight but not that tight and it could be worse. 

For Context: Married, 34, Overweight, AuDHD, Chronically ill spouse so I'm the sole breadwinner. 2 cats and a Dog. Can't have kids. 

3 a.m. Wakeup  
3-3:30 a.m. Get Ready  
3:30-4:30 a.m. Walk Dog  
4:30-5 a.m. Pick up Coffee and drive to Train Station  
5 a.m. - 6 a.m. Train  
6 a.m. - 2 p.m. Work  
2:30 - 3:30 p.m. Train  
3:30 - 4 p.m. Drive Home, Groceries   
4 - 5 p.m. Walk Dog  
5 - 8 p.m. Dinner, Shower, Time with Spouse, maybe some gaming  
8 p.m. - 3 a.m. Sleep

Weekends are a little different. Up at 6, dog park with dog, home, clean the entire apartment which takes about an hour or two and then the rest of the time is free time for whatever I need to do or want to do with my spouse. We both feel like this is how our parents had to do it and while yeah it sucks and it would be great to have more free time I feel like this is the world you get stuck in unless you're really lucky to have more time at home and less time at work. 

I work a typical schedule, and yeah I know the commute takes a lot out of my day but I refuse to live in a big city, I work downtown Toronto and live 70 km outside of it, I could move closer but that's my choice. 

I'm wondering what other peoples schedules are like and if it follows kinda the same or if things are vastly different for other millennials. ",75,1766069036.0,Millennials,172,0.93,False

Imagine waking up to the warm, comforting aroma of fresh cinnamon rolls straight from the oven. Now imagine getting all that indulgent flavor in your coffee cup. Without the calories. Without the guilt. Without the mess. [www.coffeeduke.com](http://www.coffeeduke.com)

Coffee Duke's Cinnabun coffee delivers exactly that magic.

# The Perfect Morning Ritual ☕

**Zero added sugar. Zero calories. Maximum flavor.**

This isn't just flavored coffee. It's a carefully crafted experience that captures the essence of homemade cinnamon rolls in every sip.

• Rich cinnamon spice notes  
• Sweet vanilla icing undertones  
• Smooth medium roast foundation  
• No artificial guilt



# What Makes It Special

**Fresh-roasted in small batches across the USA.** Each bean gets personal attention. Quality control happens at every step. Flavoring occurs while beans are still warm from roasting.

The result? Maximum flavor absorption. Perfect balance. Consistent quality in every cup.

**Specialty single origin beans selected for optimal flavor pairing.** Not all coffee beans work with cinnamon roll flavoring. Coffee Duke sources specific origins that complement the sweet and spicy profile perfectly.

# Available Formats 📦

**Choose Your Perfect Brew Method:**

* Creamy vanilla icing
* Brown sugar sweetness
* Buttery pastry hints

**Secondary Notes:**

* Subtle nutmeg
* Caramelized sugar
* Rich cream
* Toasted wheat

The medium roast base provides the perfect canvas. Not too light. Not too dark. Just right for showcasing the cinnamon roll flavors without overwhelming them.

# Brewing Tips for Maximum Enjoyment

**Water temperature matters.** Use water between 195-205°F for optimal extraction. Too hot burns the delicate flavoring oils. Too cool under-extracts the coffee base.

**Grind size affects flavor intensity:**

* Coarse grind: Milder cinnamon notes
* Medium grind: Balanced flavor profile
* Fine grind: Intense cinnamon roll experience

**Brewing ratios for different preferences:**

* Light flavor: 1:17 coffee to water ratio
* Medium flavor: 1:15 coffee to water ratio
* Strong flavor: 1:13 coffee to water ratio

1ppsj7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpanishAIlines/comments/1ppsj7e/common_structures_in_spanish_useful_for_everyday/,Common Structures in Spanish Useful For Everyday Conversations,"Here are 7 super common Spanish sentence patterns you’ll hear constantly in real-life conversations. They’ll boost your listening skills and help you express yourself in a more natural, fluent way.

1 . LO + adjetivo + QUE… — how \_\_\_ / the \_\_\_ thing is that…

This structure adds emphasis. It’s a very natural way to say “how + adjective” or “the (good/bad/etc.) thing is…” in Spanish.

Ejemplos:

* No sabes lo difícil que fue. → You don’t know how hard it was.
* Mira lo rápido que aprende. → Look how fast he learns.
* Lo bueno es que ya lo tenemos. → The good thing is that we already have it.

2 . QUEDARSE + adjetivo / participio / adverbio — to end up / to be left (in a state)

Used to describe the resulting state after something happens (often unexpected). 

Ejemplos:

* Me quedé sin batería. → My phone died / I ran out of battery.
* Se quedó callado. → He ended up silent / he went quiet.
* Nos quedamos sorprendidos. → We were left surprised / we ended up shocked.

3 . CADA VEZ más / menos + adjetivo / adverbio — more and more / less and less

Shows a progressive change over time. Spanish uses this pattern instead of repeating the adjective.

Ejemplos:

*  Este examen es cada vez más difícil. → This exam is getting harder and harder.
* Cada vez entiendo menos. → I understand less and less.
* Hablas cada vez mejor. → You speak better and better (each time).

4 . NO SOLO… SINO (QUE) TAMBIÉN… — not only… but also…

A very common structure to add emphasis and “upgrade” your sentence. Use “sino que” when the second part has a verb.

Ejemplos:

* No solo estudia, sino que también trabaja. → He not only studies, but he also works.
* No solo es bonito, sino también cómodo. → It’s not only pretty, but also comfortable.
* No solo llegó tarde, sino que además no avisó. → Not only was he late, he also didn’t warn anyone.

5 . TANTO… COMO… — both… and… / as much… as…

Used either to include both things (“both X and Y”) or to express equal degree (“as much as”).

Ejemplos:

* Me gusta tanto el café como el té. → I like both coffee and tea.
* Tanto tú como yo lo sabemos. → Both you and I know it.
* No me preocupa tanto como antes. → It doesn’t worry me as much as before.

6 . A MENOS QUE + subjuntivo — unless

This introduces an exception condition. It normally requires the subjunctive because it refers to something not guaranteed / hypothetical.

Ejemplos:

* No voy a menos que me lo pidas. → I won’t go unless you ask me.
* No funciona a menos que lo reinicies. → It doesn’t work unless you restart it.
* No salimos a menos que deje de llover. → We’re not going out unless it stops raining.

7 . PASARSE + cantidad de tiempo + gerundio — to spend (a lot of) time doing

This emphasizes the idea of spending too much / a lot of time on an activity.

Ejemplos:

* Me pasé toda la tarde estudiando. → I spent the whole afternoon studying.
* Se pasa el día quejándose. → He spends the whole day complaining.
* Nos pasamos horas hablando. → We spent hours talking.

This is a bit random! 

Hi, I'm a student and currently in 3rd year of undergrad. So here is the problem especially with women. Whenever I wanted to travel to a new place I searched the same thing, 'is this place safe to go'. Not the crime rates , just general safety, how safe is for women, how safe is neighborhood or transport . I tried asking many people, all answers were just based on 'vibes', I wanted to see real people experiences . Safety is best if people share there experience and google reviews are too generic , ratings are based on 'how good the coffee' was, not on safety !

Most of the times I found myself in the room , I wanted to travel solo but same safety anxiety and no real data to see. It is so frustrating ! Maybe you guys can also relate, if you are living alone. As a student and traveler it is so frustrating to sit in front of screen for 5 hours just searching same question. Yes I can ask chat gpt, but for safety real people experience matter more I suppose. People post these experience but they are lost in communities.

So, I started building a product called 'Safe or Not', a  just type in the location and all stats in one place, even for streets. You can share the experience so other people can travel better.

Recently he hit my phone telling me specific details of her cheating on me which happened a couple days ago like the coffee spot she went too. He even told me he knew I spammed her phone and so I wouldn’t be able to message her which that did happened. She was telling me he’s lying and doesn’t know how he knew her location and is probably stalking her. You see I would believe her but recently she been being very toxic to me or acting odd or saying odd things like “ our relationship isn’t real” or “ I don’t need you anymore “ or flat out just disrespect me and say horrible things and try to break it off with me. The guy also mentioned she on dating apps and they match on bumble that’s why they started talking again. Yesterday I saw bumble on her phone and she was telling me she only got it cuz he mentioned it and wanted to see if there was accounts made of her because of him. Anyways yesterday she was extremely toxic to me. She basically said very messed up things while I was working so it affected me  very deeply when I was at work. I came home and it was us fighting. I was very upset on the way she treated me basically saying she can do better, I don’t mean anything and all that. She made me cry, she finally apologized but it I felt it wasn’t sincere so I was still little mad. On top of all of that she accidentally says the guys name who swearing she cheating on me  instead of mine. So that really made me more sad and upset. We got into another fight and I said out of anger that I was gonna go to another girl and hook up with her since she don’t want appreciate me. I regret saying this because I didn’t actually mean it but I was tired of her saying nasty things about me, saying she can do better and this weirdo saying she cheating on me. She basically said I lost her by saying that proceed to hit up the guy who she swore is lying on her about her cheating me with. This whole situation is just so messed up.

It was completely empty aside from two men about 50-60 years old, sitting at a corner table. 

The men locked onto me as soon as I walked in, but whatever, old creepy men that’s nothing new. I mind my business, order my coffee, and while I wait one of the men comes up to me. He just kind of stands near me so I moved out of the way and say “oh sorry am I in your way?”  He says “no no sorry, can I show you something?” Of course I’m kind of cations about this and say “well depends on what it is”. He proceeds to show me a his screensaver, it is a young woman who looks IDENTICAL to me. I mean if you put us side by side we could be twins. 

He tells me it’s his daughter and he was just taken aback when I came in, I laughed and told him I agree we look extremely similar and asked her name. He told me her name was Jade. This was another blip on my “what the fuck is happening” radar. When I was a kid all I wanted is to be named Jade, all my gaming tags were a variation of Jade and numbers, when I played make believe with friends I was always Jade, I even told strangers my name was Jade. It was a strange obsession that I think a lot of kids have with names they wish they were named. 

I just smiled and said it was a very pretty name. He explained she was in Hong Kong, I told him that would be a fun trip and he proceeded to tell me this crazy story of how she was scammed into taking a package to China and got arrested in Hong Kong. This exact story actually happened about 3 years ago in a town about 4 hours away to a woman my family was loosely tied to. I look at him and say “you know I want to be sympathetic but are you fucking with me right now”. He told me he swears on the bible and isn’t trying to make me uncomfortable he just has a hard time not talking about it of course. 

Now, I work inside the court system, specifically with mentally ill offenders, many struggling with addiction. I start to do my regular checks for signs of intoxication and mental health symptoms. This man seems completely lucid. Now I jump to hes trying to pickpocket me. This is a good area but you never know. My belongings are still on me and the other man he was sitting with is a standing about 5 feet away. 

This is when he starts to tell me his daughter wanted to get into LAW ENFORCEMENT and was enrolled in the same school and discipline I recently graduated from. I am not necessarily someone who looks like I work in the field I do and I definitely don’t advertise it on my person. 

He says he won’t keep me any longer, shakes my hand and says his name is Gary, he introduces his friend as “Cameron” but says people call him “Taco Man” because when he drinks he likes to make everyone tacos. This is my final “time to get out of here”. My ex-boyfriend, who I was with for a very long time, was jokingly called “the taco man” because he would, get drunk, and make everyone tacos. 

They held the door for me as a I left and I watched them get into a pretty nice, newer truck, and drive off.

1ppsehx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alcoholism_Medication/comments/1ppsehx/keto_naltrexone_65_days_sober_20_lbs_down/,"Keto + naltrexone = 65 days sober, 20 lbs down","Forgive me that this is so long, but I wanted to provide some encouragement for those starting Naltrexone and aren't seeing the results they'd like. 

I tried Naltrexone 3 separate times over the past couple years.  The first time I was at 50mg and didn't see results.  Psychiatrist who prescribed (whom Id only met twice) refused to bump up the dose and insisted I go to AA.  I wasn't willing to do that for multiple reasons, but including the fact that I struggle with agoraphobia.  The second and third time I was prescribed by my family Dr who knows I've got an extremely high drug tolerance.  He started me at 50 and recommended I titrate up to 75 or 100 (can't remember which now.)

Cons:
Side effects are rough if you don't properly titrate up.  Psych insisted I take it before bed but it gave me wicked insomnia.  I switched to the AM with my family Drs 'permission' and that helped.  It's also really rough on the tummy.  I had stomach pain, nausea etc.  It can also cause constipation but as someone who has the opposite issue due to IBS, I actually found this normalized that aspect of my body and was a definite win.  Not that I'm sober and no longer taking the med, my stomach is shitty again.  I was hopeful being sober would do more for my GI issues tbh. (Can't win em all!)

I also struggled with compliance!  Normally I take my other meds at night before bed, so I'd struggle to remember to take it in the AM or if I'd taken it at all.  (No, pill boxes didn't help)

I wasn't prepared with enough non-alcoholic beverage options and constantly found myself wandering around looking for....something...to consume or do.  It showed me how much of my drinking was purely habit.  Now that I'm sober I drink an insane amount of black coffee, tea, soda water and kombucha etc.  I'm having to do the dishes way more often!

I felt kinda meh.  That could be because Nal is a dopamine blocker.  Also could just be that I was bored and felt like I was missing something (Cause let's be real, I Was missing something).

Pros:
The first few days stretching felt sooooo good!
IBS improved on the med.
I'm 65 days sober!

Key/Interesting Points:
Even tho I took Naltrexone 3 different times (not for 3 days, but in 3 stints that were each a few to several months long) I wasn't actually taking it when I got sober!  BUT I feel strongly that those times I was taking it my brain was slowly rewiring.

A ketogenic diet was the Key lifestyle change that helped get me sober.  I KNOW for some people that is a Major adjustment that's not feasible for many reasons.  But for those considering, I think there's 3 reasons it helped me:

1.  My husband is strictly a (daily) beer drinker so there's almost always beer in the house.  The amount of will power required was crazy because I'd fool myself into thinking ""Id just have one"" way too early in the day and it was never just one.  However when I switched to keto, I was only drinking vodka sodas.  (I had 30-40 lbs to lose, so I'm now about 10-15 lbs from my goal weight).  One day I made the decision that I wouldnt buy vodka for drinks the next day and see if I could just go One day sober.  And it worked!  And then I tried another day and another.

2.  When not drinking alcohol, myself and many others, get crazy sugar cravings.  Initially when I tried to quit Id allow myself to indulge in treats as a ""reward"" for not drinking.  This obviously led to me feeling shitty and disappointed in myself because I'd eat like garbage and still end of drinking.  Whereas on keto, I have a naturally lower desire for snacks because I'm more satisfied with higher fat/protein snacks and meals.

3.  Because being sober doesn't physically make me feel better (I have migraines, fibromyalgia and possibly EDS) even tho I was mentally proud, I didn't really feel any physical benefits from sobriety.  However, with the switch to keto and no booze, my body was able to rapidly process my extra body fat.  And interestly, when first losing weight, your body processes fat from your liver first.  I knew my liver enzymes were high before keto/sobriety and Im getting blood work today to have them retested and will provide an update when I get results.  So seeing and feeling the weight loss became the encouragement I needed to stay sober.  I was also able to stop my blood pressure medication!

Other considerations:  I've been concerned about my drinking for almost 20 years.  (I'm 42).  My goal has always been to get to the point where I'm a ""normal"" drinker.  But coming from a long line of alcoholics from both sides of the family, and living with one, I didn't know how likely that was.  I'd long been jealous when people told me they didn't drink at all, I just didn't think I could be one of those people.  But now that I'm sober, what I have found is that I like to occasionally take a sip of my husband's, sister/BIL's/best friend's etc drink.  When I do that it makes me feel in control that I can have just a sip or two, like having just a bite or two of a decadent dessert.  Whereas I know I can't have just one drink to myself.  I'll end up having another...and another.

Conclusion:  I know a ketogenic diet won't be attractive to many people for multiple reasons.  But if you've got other health concerns on top of your drinking that you want to address and are willing to give it a shot, I strongly recommend trying a low carb or ketogenic diet.  The filling foods and snack options gave me something else to focus on aside from missing drinking.  And now that my brain/mind has associated keto with sobriety, it's easier to continue/maintain because I get the double pride of weight loss And sobriety.

Plus I've found that once Ive been in ketosis consistently for a month or so, I can easily have full carb ""cheat days"" once a week or so that either don't kick me out of ketosis or or only take a day or two to get back into it.  Plus ""carb ups"" help break thru weight loss plateaus.

I see a ton of posts asking about moving to South End Charlotte NC, so I figured I’d put everything in one place for anyone considering it. South End is easily one of the most talked-about neighborhoods in the city, but it’s not for everyone.

First things first: if you’re moving to South End Charlotte NC, you’re choosing convenience and lifestyle over space and price. South End is dense, walkable, loud in some areas, and extremely active. That’s the appeal.

The biggest reason people end up moving to South End Charlotte NC is **walkability**. You can live your entire life without touching your car. Breweries, coffee shops, restaurants, gyms, grocery stores, rail trail access, and the light rail are all right there.

If you work Uptown or anywhere along the light rail, moving to South End Charlotte NC makes commuting stupid easy. A lot of people move here specifically to ditch their car commute.

Socially, it’s very easy to meet people. If you’re new to Charlotte, moving to South End Charlotte NC puts you around other transplants in the same phase of life.

Here’s what you dont' hear talked a lot about though. 

Moving to South End Charlotte NC is expensive compared to most other neighborhoods. Rent is high, parking can be very annoying, and weekends get loud.

If you want peace and quiet, moving to South End Charlotte NC might wear on you. Some buildings back directly up to the rail trail, which is great during the day and less great late at night.

Space is another thing. If you’re moving to South End Charlotte NC, expect smaller apartments unless your budget is high. You’re paying for location, not square footage. Chances are you will see studios as high as $1600-$1700 in the summer time and one beds climbing up to $2000.

In my opinion, moving to South End Charlotte NC makes the most sense if:

* You’re new to the city
* You value walkability over space
* You like being social and active
* You want quick access to Uptown
* You don’t mind paying a premium for lifestyle

If you’re more home-body than social butterfly, moving to South End Charlotte NC might not be the best long-term fit. There's plenty of other places in Charlotte where you will be a short Uber away from all the fun and activities on the days you want to go out and you can save yourself some rent.

If you’re on the fence, I’d strongly recommend visiting on both a weekday and a weekend before committing to moving to South End Charlotte NC. It feels very different depending on the day.

I am REALLY talented at managing and leading people. I have helped a lot of people excel in their careers by giving them feedback but then helping them develop solid career maps and then solid plans on how to communicate during the next steps. I’m getting ready to be promoted to a Senior position at 31(f). I’ve always been complimented and have several global companies who love me and have given me standing job offers (when I’m ready to jump). All the offers are business side with ownership. This isn’t to be cocky. I highly value people and know how to navigate politics.

Anyways, I like this guy that I interact with at work. We are at the end of the project and I really wanted to ask him for lunch or coffee. However, he made a comment that made me pause. His department doesn’t see the value he adds by interacting well with other departments. My department and the others LOVE working with him. He is also the motivation I needed to push to have a regional first and we think a first for the entire company. He has been pushing my team for a year and I was the first one to successfully do it. \*I did it out of spite but didn’t give up at the end because I know he would appreciate it.\* Every one on one interaction with this guy made it feel like something was there and it was why I was waiting until we were done before saying anything.

I need to write a paper and push it company wide and need his help. I need to now go talk to him about why I need him to be more involved and how I can help him use this to promote why he’s an amazing asset. The amount of money we will save is insane once we set this as a precedent. I can build the document but need his technical side and his historical data to build everything out. He saw the vision and I just implemented because I trusted and respect him.

I’m so sad because I really like this guy but I see so much real potential and so much talent that my leadership brain needs to step in. I know this is basically going to cock block me from anything that might have been going on. He and I will write this paper and then go our separate ways but I know this will change how he views me.

I mentioned what I wanted to do for this guy to my superintendent and he lit up and goes “you’re going to do for him what you did for me”. I know this is the right this but damn it sucks lol.

 

\*My superintendent was able to excel his career in a matter of 2 months by following everything I said and now he’s able to coach others. He takes everything I say to heart and he views me as a mentor and we are about the same age. This isn’t the first and I’ve done this for so many people and it always has the same results.

I'm here because I miss having someone I can talk to regularly. Someone I can text through the day, share random thoughts with, laugh a little, and slowly get to know without any pressure.

I'm calm by nature, but I enjoy depth. I like conversations that go beyond small talk, a bit of teasing, and that feeling when talking to someone just feels easy. I'm spiritual but not religious, and I enjoy thinking about life, people, and how we change over time. I believe connection should feel natural and safe, not rushed or forced.

I'm a good listener and I genuinely care when I talk to someone. Kindness, honesty, and communication matter to me. I'm not into games, ghosting, or drama. I like people who are warm, emotionally aware, and comfortable being themselves.

I enjoy simple comforts. The smell of fresh coffee in the morning, dark chocolate, instant noodles on lazy days, good music, and quiet evenings. Sometimes an occasional joint helps take the edge off everyday life and slow things down a bit.

Please Read Carefully And With Grace","I keep trying to do what I always do when the internet catches fire.

Close the tab. Walk away. Let the smoke clear.

Most of the time, that’s the right move. Drama burns hot and fast, and life is bigger than a comment thread.

But this one followed me off the screen.

It sat with me while I made coffee. It tugged at the back of my mind while I tried to write. It crept in at night, when the house was quiet and the only thing I wanted was the simple comfort of the page. I told myself I wouldn’t think about it. I told myself it wasn’t my fight. I told myself I had no business stepping into it.

And yet here I am, writing anyway, because writing is how I keep my thoughts from turning into a knot in my chest. It’s how I make sense of the world when everything feels loud.

I also know the moment you speak online, you become a character. A name in someone else’s story. A quote in someone else’s thread. The smartest move is probably to stay silent. I still might. I might write this, breathe a little easier, and never hit post.

I don’t know yet.

Deep breath.

If my life were one of my novels, this is the part where the narrator admits the truth before anything else.

I’m not a neutral observer.

I’m biased. I’m not going to pretend I’m not.

Because this isn’t a headline to me. It isn’t a faceless company versus a faceless crowd. It’s my life. It’s my career. It’s the fragile, hard-earned thing I’ve been chasing for years with the stubbornness of someone who didn’t have a backup dream.

I’ve only ever wanted to be a writer.

Not famous. Not adored. Not rich.

Just steady. Just real.

And that want didn’t come from nowhere.

I spent time in foster care. I know what it’s like to be uprooted, to feel like the ground under you isn’t yours, to have days where you don’t know what tomorrow looks like. I know what it’s like to have nothing. Not as a metaphor. As a memory.

And in that kind of life, books become more than entertainment.

They become doors.

I escaped into them. Into worlds where the rules made sense, where courage mattered, where pain had purpose, where the hero could take a beating and still get back up. I escaped into pages because sometimes the real world was too sharp, too uncertain, too heavy for a kid to carry without somewhere to set it down.

Stories didn’t fix my life.

But they gave me air.

They gave me a way to endure.

They gave me something I could hold onto when everything else felt temporary.

So when I say I’ve always wanted to be a writer, I don’t mean “I always thought it would be cool.” I mean I wanted to repay a debt I can’t properly name. I wanted to build a door for someone else the way those authors built doors for me. I wanted to give a kid, or a tired adult, or anybody who feels trapped in their own life, a few hours where the world loosens its grip.

That’s the dream.

And for a long time, it felt like something I was always reaching for but never quite touching. Like a door I could see, but couldn’t open. I worked. I wrote. I rewrote. I doubted myself into the floor and kept going anyway. There were times I didn’t have money. Times I had almost nothing. Times the idea of “making it” felt like a cruel joke you tell yourself to keep from giving up.

And then the door opened.

Not because I’m special. Not because I didn’t work for it. Not because I didn’t grind and bleed for it.

It opened because I found people willing to meet me halfway.

And that’s the part that makes this hard for me to watch from the sidelines, even though I want to.

Because I know what it feels like to be on the edge of the dream, looking in.

And I know what it feels like to finally step through.

I want to be careful here, because I’m not writing this to defend contracts or persuade anyone to make decisions they aren’t comfortable making. I’m not writing this to lecture anyone. I’m not writing this to pick a fight.

I’m writing it because there’s a difference between critique and a bonfire, and right now everything feels like fire.

Here’s what I can say, and what I’m willing to own.

I’ve learned that business is business. It’s paperwork and risk and negotiation and compromise. It’s people making decisions to protect themselves. It’s people choosing what fits their situation and refusing what doesn’t.

I respect that.

If something doesn’t feel right to you, you should walk away. If you want to negotiate, you should negotiate. If you want a lawyer to look at it, you should do that too. Those aren’t betrayals. They’re wisdom.

But I also think we forget something when we’re angry, when we’re scared, when we’re trying to protect ourselves.

We forget that on the other side of the screen, there are still human beings.

Not symbols. Not villains. Not cardboard cutouts. Just people.

And my lived experience has been human.

I talk to the people I work with. I’ve reached out with anxiety, with questions, with the kind of quiet panic writers don’t like admitting they carry. I’ve had moments where edits came back and my first instinct was to think, I’m not good enough. My work is garbage. I should throw this whole thing away.

And instead of being treated like a product, I was treated like a person.

Questions. Coaching. Patience. A steady hand on the wheel when I was ready to swerve into a ditch.

That matters to me because it’s easy, in the middle of noise, to forget how rare that is.

And it’s easy, in the middle of noise, to convince yourself your story is the only story.

So I want to tell mine, plainly.

This relationship has worked for me.

Not perfectly. Not magically. Not like some fairytale where every day is bright and every decision is easy.

But consistently. Respectfully. Professionally.

I’ve been paid. I’ve seen follow-through. I’ve watched promises turn into action. I’ve watched plans become books in the world. I’ve watched my dream become something I can call a job.

I’m not saying that makes my experience universal. I’m not saying it erases anyone else’s concerns. I’m not saying no one should ever criticize anything.

I’m saying it’s possible for criticism to be valid without turning into cruelty.

It’s possible for a contract to be a bad fit for someone without turning the people behind it into monsters.

It’s possible to warn and still remember there are human beings attached to the warning.

And maybe that’s all I’m trying to do here.

Hold onto a little humanity.

Because I don’t want to live in a world where the first response to conflict is scorched earth. I don’t want to live in a world where everything becomes a purity test and everyone is one screenshot away from being declared irredeemable.

I’m tired. I’m stressed. I’m protective of my career because this is what I’ve built my life around. I’m protective because I know what it’s like to have nothing, and I don’t take stability for granted.

And I’m also just sad.

Sad that something as ordinary as a business disagreement can become a spectacle. Sad that silence feels like the safest choice, even when you want to say something kind. Sad that in a community built on stories, we can forget that people are not characters written for our convenience.

So this is me, writing into the dark, not to argue, not to attack, not to convince.

Just to say that I’m still here.

Still writing.

Still grateful.

Still choosing nuance when the world wants absolutes.

And if I don’t post this, if it stays in my drafts, then at least it did what writing has always done for me.

It gave me a place to set the weight down.

[www.coffeeduke.com](http://www.coffeeduke.com)

Premium specialty coffee at home? Totally doable. Without breaking the bank.

Most coffee lovers spend $5-7 per day at cafés. That's $150+ monthly. For one person.

**The math is brutal.** But fixable.

# Why Premium Coffee Costs So Much (And How to Beat the System)

Specialty coffee shops markup beans 300-400%. Location costs. Labor. Equipment maintenance.

You're paying for the experience. Not just the coffee.

**Home brewing changes everything.**

Same quality beans. Fraction of the cost. Total control over flavor.

# Hack #1: Master the Bulk Buying Game

🎯 **Buy smart, not frequent.**

# The 2-Week Rule

Purchase coffee every 2 weeks instead of weekly. Savings: 15-20% instantly.

# Wholesale Options

* Local roaster bulk deals
* Online specialty retailers
* Coffee subscription services
* Warehouse club memberships

**Pro tip:** Fresh-roasted beans stay optimal for 2-4 weeks. Buy accordingly.

# Storage Secrets

* Airtight containers only
* Cool, dark locations
* Never refrigerate whole beans
* Grind immediately before brewing

# Hack #2: Nail Your Grind Game

⚡ **Wrong grind = wasted money.**

Pre-ground coffee loses flavor within hours. You're literally pouring money down the drain.

# Burr Grinder Investment

Cost: $50-150. Payback time: 2-3 months.

**Why burr grinders win:**

* Consistent particle size
* Better extraction
* No heat damage
* Longer bean freshness

# Grind Size Chart

* **Coarse:** French press, cold brew
* **Medium:** Drip coffee makers
* **Fine:** Espresso, Aeropress
* **Extra fine:** Turkish coffee

Match your grind to your method. Period.

# Hack #3: Optimize Your Brewing Equipment

🔧 **Your brewer makes or breaks your budget.**

Expensive equipment ≠ better coffee. Smart equipment = better coffee.

# Budget Champions

* **Pour-over setups:** $20-40 total investment
* **French press:** $25-50, lasts years
* **Aeropress:** $40, virtually indestructible
* **Moka pot:** $30, Italian excellence

# Maintenance = Money Saved

* Clean equipment weekly
* Replace filters regularly
* Descale monthly
* Check seals and gaskets

**Broken equipment wastes beans.** Good maintenance protects your investment.

# Water Quality Matters

Use filtered water. Tap water minerals ruin flavor and damage equipment.

Cost: $0.10 per gallon vs. $2+ per bottle.

# Hack #4: Explore Coffee Duke's Variety Packs

💎 **Over 60 varieties. Free shipping. Game changer.**

[Coffee Duke](https://coffeeduke.com) removes the guesswork from specialty coffee shopping.

# Why Variety Packs Win

* Try multiple flavors without commitment
* Discover personal preferences faster
* Avoid expensive mistakes
* Built-in cost savings

**Featured options:**

* [Chocolate Hazelnut](https://coffeeduke.com/products/chocolate-hazelnut): Rich, indulgent, perfect for afternoon breaks
* [Mexican Chocolate](https://coffeeduke.com/products/mexican-chocolate): Spiced complexity without café pricing
* [Pecan Pie](https://coffeeduke.com/products/pecan-pie): Dessert coffee that replaces expensive treats

# Free Shipping Advantage

No minimum orders. No membership fees. No hidden costs.

**Calculate the savings:**

* Local café: $6 per specialty drink
* Coffee Duke equivalent: $1.50 per cup
* Monthly savings: $135+ for daily drinkers



# Hack #5: Single-Serve Pod Strategy

🎯 **Use pods strategically, not exclusively.**

Single-serve pods cost 3x more per cup than whole beans. But they have their place.

# Smart Pod Usage

* Busy mornings only
* Travel situations
* Office convenience
* Guest preferences

# Pod Cost Reduction

* Buy in bulk during sales
* Generic brand alternatives
* Refillable pod systems
* Mix with traditional brewing

**The 80/20 rule:** 80% whole bean brewing, 20% pod convenience.

# Quality Pod Selection

Look for:

* Freshness dates
* Origin information
* Roast level clarity
* Recyclable materials

# The Real Cost Breakdown

# Daily Café Habit

* Specialty drink: $6.00
* Monthly total: $180
* Annual cost: $2,160

# Home Brewing Setup

* Initial equipment: $150
* Monthly beans: $45
* Annual cost: $690

**Annual savings: $1,470**

That's vacation money. Car payment money. Investment money.

# Quick Implementation Guide

# Week 1: Equipment Setup

* Buy burr grinder
* Choose brewing method
* Set up storage system

# Week 2: Bean Sourcing

* Research local roasters
* Order Coffee Duke variety pack
* Establish buying schedule

# Week 3: Technique Refinement

* Perfect grind settings
* Dial in water temperature
* Time your brewing process

# Week 4: Cost Tracking

* Calculate daily savings
* Adjust buying patterns
* Plan next month's orders

# Advanced Money-Saving Moves

# Seasonal Buying

Coffee prices fluctuate seasonally. Buy during harvest seasons for maximum savings.

# Direct Roaster Relationships

Build relationships with local roasters. Ask about day-old discounts and bulk pricing.

# Coffee Community Connections

Join local coffee groups. Share bulk orders. Exchange brewing tips.

**Network your way to savings.**

# Common Expensive Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Don't buy pre-ground coffee**  
❌ **Don't ignore water quality**  
❌ **Don't over-complicate brewing**  
❌ **Don't buy tiny quantities frequently**  
❌ **Don't ignore equipment maintenance**

# Your Next Steps

**Today:**

* Calculate current coffee spending

**This week:**

**This month:**

# The Bottom Line

Premium specialty coffee at home costs 70% less than café purchases.

**Investment required:** $100-200 initial setup

**Quality improvement:** Significant

1pps25a,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1pps25a/once_bitten_a_psa/,Once Bitten; A PSA,"New account; I have my reasons. A woman posted on here a while ago with a Stupidity Counter. If you see her, tell her I need to borrow it.

I met a guy here and we chatted for a while. There were no obvious red flags, and the conversation was great. I had some initial reservations due to lack of physical attraction, but how much can you really tell from a photo? After a bit, we met up for coffee and there was definitely some chemistry and potential. We took a walk and one thing led to another and there was some kissing, which was nice...UNTIL he started sucking on my neck. I pumped the brakes faster than my dignity could leave my body.

A) hickeys are never cool; B) I'm 30 years past the age where hickeys might have been considered cool; C) and I can't stress this point enough-I'M FUCKING MARRIED

Despite the fact I had to explain this to a grown man, who is also married, I continued chatting with him. Cut to a few days later, and he was going to be in my general area for work, and offered to buy me lunch. Girl's gotta eat, so I said 'hell yeah', and we made plans to meet up at a park. Now here is the part where I volunteer myself as tribute to be seriously judged and harshly criticized. Upon arrival, I suggested that instead of lunch, something else could be on the menu. We ended up in his work van and stuff happened. I am not a backseat banger, but very lonely + very horny = dumb. I'm lying there, his head between my legs, still riding the high of my climax, when this mother fucker bites me. Not too hard, but it's my inner thigh and it was hard enough that I knew there would likely be a bruise. Sure enough, the next day, there is a vaguely mouth shaped bruise on my inner thigh. It's a good thing my husband completely ignores me.

I sent him a picture of the bruise and a ""what the fuck?!"" message. He apologized and swore it wouldn't happen again. And he's right; it won't because I ended it. It's a shame because our locations and schedules were such that we could have had a lot of meet ups and great hotel sex, but I spent the whole day after our encounter pissed off. And I'm not here to be pissed off. (Or pissed on; not my kink). Maybe I was too harsh to end it so quick. but to me, it was such an obvious line that shouldn't be crossed and the fact that I had to explain it (twice), made me not want to continue.

So ladies, be safe out there. Gentleman, don't leave marks on your AP. That is my PSA.",25,1766067817.0,adultery,12,0.84,False

here's what i posed last night:

boyfriend (18m) recently called me (18f) after one of his classes because a girl in his class (who i had heard about from him before, he didn't like her because she made class difficult for everyone) had forged screenshots of him flirting with her and she wanted him to either ""come clean"" and give her proof he told me, or she would reach out to me on insta. she had found his, and found mine through a tagged post. i didn't care nearly as much as he did, he was worried that i would believe her even tho i know he wouldn't do that.

he reported her to campus police in case she tried anything else, we both blocked her insta, i didn't think twice about it.

more than a week later (yesterday) some other girl followed me and commented something under my most recent post ""blah blah ik this is weird but i have info blah blah dm me"" so i figured, since she put her friend up to it now, i would talk to her to make it clear i had no interest in what she had to say. it was a lot of ""your boyfriend is a liar and you don't deserve to be lied to"" vs ""i'm gonna need more than the word of two strangers vs the man i love"".

she gave me some story about ""he took her (the friend blackmailing (?) my bf) out to dinner and coffee and flirted with her constantly"" and i thought it was dumb because he has no time, he doesn't spend money rn unless it's taking me out or going out with his church guys, and this man has absolutely no clue how to flirt. i've watched him try. it's kind of sad, in an endearing way.

she was really insistent but i blew her off and got pretty unserious until she dropped it. i said a civil goodnight and blocked her. i ss'd the whole convo and sent it to my boyfriend, too.

i don't think he did it, and had a conversation earlier thanking him for being someone i could trust. i don't want him to think i've gone back on that. he's a good man who recognizes his mistakes and owns up to them. he knows he's lucky to have me, and i'm lucky enough to have someone who knows it.

however,, i still want to ask him about the things that girl said. just to check the mental box that i did ask him. i still want to ask, but i feel like i can't ask anything now that it's been handled, especially with how much of a cool, unbothered head i've handled this all with.

idk if this context helps, but he did mention the situation to my mom and sister when he was over once, so it's not like he's trying to keep it close to the chest. and he did let me know the first time they went to get coffee that he mentioned me, as his girlfriend, and she seemed disappointed ? idk,

tldr : someone threatened my boyfriend with fake ss's of him flirting and claimed he took her out multiple times, i don't believe her and already spoke to / shut her down myself & thanked my boyfriend for being a trustworthy man, but i still want to ask him questions about it, even though i do believe him.

what i didn't get to mention in there, but i find important:

\- they did go to coffee, just so there's no confusion. as far as i know, he didn't take her out, they met up to study together, and he definitely didn't take her out to dinner like she claimed.

\- a lot of things the girl who reached out to me, let's call her leah, told me didn't make much sense to me. she never actually sent me the screenshots, only told me that they exist and she ""saw them"" on her friend's phone. she never gave me dates for when she claimed he took out her friend. she also, several times throughout the conversation, would read my message and take between 5-10 minutes to respond. 

\- leah claimed her friend, ""janet,"" wasn't ever interested in him, but they apparently had 3 dates. she also had janet type in her own response to me since i had blocked her before she could reach out (i assume they were together at the time) and she told leah to tell me some big paragraph, which she totally lost me to when she said ""unlike him, i am a good christian. and my word, my honestly, means something.""  booooo tomato tomato 🍅 🍅 

\- the details she DID give me on their dates were ""first was a study date in a reserves study room RIGHT next to his dorm"" (his dorm is a good walk from the study rooms) ""second was 4pm coffee"" (no date or even day of the week provided) and ""third was a dinner date."" that was the whole sentence.

more about my boyfriend,

\- the one time he HAS catastrophically fucked up so bad we almost broke up had absolutely nothing to do with anybody but him and me. it was a situation between us, and he felt so guilty, he cried in front of me and kept going on about ""you're my baby, how could i hurt my baby?"" and while i admit i'm a bit disappointed with his efforts to make it up to me, i know he's been in a tough spot time wise with finals and work and returning to his old job for winter break, and in all other regards, he's been a gentleman since then. i do believe that guilt was genuine.

\- i have his location, and while i honestly never check it (it's mostly used to make sure i'm safe when i work art events in downtown area or when i go to the gym at 1 in the morning), he pretty much always lets me know how he's doing, where he's going, and he texts me alllll throughout the day. literally all the time. the one time he didn't text me for more that an hour that wasn't at 5am while i worked and he slept, he was working and prepping for midterms all day. and i did get pictures of that, he sent me pictures of him sitting outside because he couldn't go inside until he finished all his work for one class, and then when he went inside with the heater. even when he does go out, he still texts me to check up on me and sends me photos from the outing.

and a lot of people on my last post said they didn't understand why a girl and her friend would go to all these lengths if it was fake, and while i do understand that argument, i don't think many people understand how legitimately common this is nowadays. i heard about it plenty from people when i was in highschool, and yk, reddit, but that's. definitely another world of things. all that to say, though, it's not as uncommon as it might seem from the outside. gen z is crazy. 

sorry this is so long, let me know if i can clarify anything further.

how do i talk to him about this? i already thanked him for being someone i can trust, and i 100% meant it, but i feel like i skipped the step of asking him for his side when everything first happened. i just, believed him so quickly, and now i'm distressed because i never got the reassurance i feel like i should have asked for before. how do i bring this up now, even if it's already been settled, technically?",1,1766067789.0,relationship_advice,12,0.67,False

1pps00y,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesHoffmann/comments/1pps00y/looking_for_a_premium_material_machine_for_500/,Looking for a premium material machine for €500?,"Hey 👋

I posted here about a year ago. Back then, I had just been using a €29 Nespresso machine and wanted a change.

I didn’t really know what type of coffee I liked the most but went in the direction of a manual machine.

After lots of help from the sub, I ended up getting an induction Bialetti Moka Pot with Nomad Coffee (I live in Spain).

I had looked at a 9 Barista, The Bird and the Aeropress Premium but decided on the cheaper route to start.

I’ve had great coffee all year but now I’m looking to get an actual machine.

I’ve been to quite a few coffee bars over the last twelve months and tried everything from V60’s to Aeropress to espresso.

Looking to go the espresso route.

My budget is roughly €500 (without the grinder) but I really want a premium looking/feeling machine made from metal with wooden handles (no plastic).

The no plastic is not for health reasons - I just want to get myself something nice and really like good materials (I don’t splurge on myself too often).

My brother in-law has a Sage Bambino Plus which I’ve seen gets countless recommendations.

However, I had a look at his the other week but it felt really cheap? Plasticky metal etc. 

I have thought about the 9Barista paired with a manual grinder. Seems to fit the budget and it’s really well made.

I’m no expert (pretty much a beginner) coming from Nespresso > Moka Pot.

Does anyone have any recommendations?

I can go above €500 if the jump is warranted but would like to try and stay within budget.
