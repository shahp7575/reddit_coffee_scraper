1qducy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/comments/1qducy7/30m/,[30/M],"I’m a 30-year-old software engineer currently living in the northeast of Scotland, though I originally come from the Highlands. Growing up surrounded by mountains, lochs, and wide open spaces had a big influence on who I am, and I still feel most at home when I’m outdoors or somewhere a little quieter than city life.

By trade, I work in software engineering, which suits both my problem-solving mindset and my curiosity for how things work under the hood. I enjoy learning new technologies, refining my skills, and building things that are both functional and thoughtfully designed. Outside of work, I tend to gravitate toward hobbies that balance creativity, learning, and a bit of adventure.

Cooking is one of my biggest passions — I love experimenting with new recipes, trying different cuisines, and refining techniques, whether that’s slow comfort food or something more technical. Alongside that, I’m *really* into coffee. Brewing methods, beans, grind sizes, tasting notes — all of it. Making a great cup of coffee is both a daily ritual and a hobby in its own right.

I’m also a big fan of video games, particularly ones with strong storytelling, immersive worlds, or clever mechanics. They’re a great way for me to unwind and also tie into my interest in other cultures and languages. I enjoy learning new languages and reading about different cultures, histories, and ways of life — understanding how people live and think elsewhere in the world is something I find genuinely fascinating.

When I want to disconnect from screens, you’ll usually find me hiking or out with a camera. Scotland offers no shortage of landscapes worth exploring, and photography gives me an excuse to slow down and really notice my surroundings. I enjoy capturing natural scenes, light, and atmosphere more than anything overly staged.

Overall, I’d describe myself as curious, fairly laid-back, and thoughtful. I enjoy meaningful conversations, learning new things, and finding joy in small details — whether that’s a well-pulled espresso, a great view at the end of a hike, or finally understanding a tricky concept.

- we started at the mall of America (park in the east ramp, transit station is in the basement) and took the light rail to the Fort Snelling stop. From there we had to walk around the parking lot, maybe a quarter of a mile. 

- you can drive, and park in the Fort Snelling Park& Ride South lot, the protestors are less than a block away. 

- when we arrived around 10am, there were maybe 8 people there, and they were really happy to see us. 

- there was a literal pile of frozen pallets of water. if you go, consider bringing a warm pack of water bottles and taking a frozen one when you go. let it thaw, bring it back next time you go. maybe a Styrofoam or other insulated container to help keep things from freezing too quick. 

- there were lots of donated granola bars, frozen apples and bananas in the pile. They could use regular donations of hot coffee, tea, warm food.

- bring a garbage bag and help pick up if you can. there is a dumpster near the protest site in the parking lot for 100 Federal Building. 

- there is a single porta potty halfway between the light rail station and the protest corner. Apparently ice keeps trying to lock it (it's not in the Whipple parking lot) and people have broken the locks a few times. 

- many of the protestors were simply heckling the ice agents going in and out of the Whipple parking lot. some excellent insults, lots of creativity. some agents responded, one threw an empty paper coffee cup. 

- they could really use hand warmers and especially toe warmers. 

- try to check the supplies they have and don't overdonate - cops love to steal or ruin supplies during actions like this, so try to bring some and keep some in reserve to bring next time

- there isn't really anywhere to sit, and much of the sidewalks were covered in ice in places, so a lot of people were standing in the street. 

- Unicorn Riot was there, super excellent independent journalists, love you guys 🫶

- I talked to a couple of people who have been there day after day, and they say the numbers are thinning. Several people asked us to tell our friends, to try to get more bodies down there, even if it's just for an hour or two. 

- I exchanged numbers with several regulars there, to try to keep in touch and so they could let me know what supplies they need most. I've also connected with some locals who have received donations from friends, so I'm doing to keep going and bringing supplies. 

I'll try to answer any questions that people have, I know a lot of people are curious, and I encourage you to try to go if you can, especially early in the day. ",4,1768507836.0,TwinCities,0,1.0,False

They treat agents like smart, autonomous teammates/junior dev with their own volition and intuition and then wonder why the output is chaotic, inconsistent, or subtly/less subtly broken.

An agent is not a “better ChatGPT.” The correct mental model when using agent to write your code is to be **an orchestrator of its execution**, not let it be independent thinker and expecting ""here is a task based on custom domain and my own codebase, make it work"". You have to define the structure, constraints, rules, and expectations. The agent just runs inside that box.

ChatGPT, Gemini, etc. work *alone* because they come with heavy built-in guardrails and guidelines and are tuned for conversation and problem solving. Agents, on the other hand, touch *all* content they have zero idea about: your code, files, tools, side effects. They don’t magically inherit discipline or domain knowledge. They have to get that knowledge.

If you don’t supply your own guardrails, standards, and explicit instructions, the agent will happily optimize for speed and hallucinate its way through your repo.

Agents amplify intent. If your intent isn’t well-defined, they amplify chaos.

What really worked best for me is this structure, for example:

You have this task to extend customer login logic:  
\[long wall of text that is probably JIRA task written by PM before having morning coffee\]

*this is the point where most people hit enter and just wait for agent to do ""magic"", but there is more*

To complete this task, you have to do X and Y, in those location A and B etc.

Before you start on this task use the file in root directory named **guidelines.txt** to figure how to write the code.

And this is where the magic happens, in guidelines.txt you want:

* all your ins and outs of your domain, your workflow (simplified)
* where the meat of the app is located (models, views, infrastructure)
* the less obvious ""gotchas""
* what the agent can touch
* what the agent must NEVER touch or only after manual approval

Hello,

I’m planning to move to Austin this coming March, and after touring over 10 different apartments, I’ve narrowed my decision down to Paseo and 415 Colorado. I’d really appreciate any advice or insight.

Context:

•	I’ve already applied to an apartment in both buildings

•	Pricing is essentially the same once incentives are included

•	Age: 24 (M)

•	Work: Commute to the Domain, with 1–2 work-from-home days per week

•	Budget: 3.5-4k

•	I’ve interned in Austin for several summers and have previously lived downtown

⸻

Paseo Pros:

•	Outstanding, wide-ranging amenities with many comfortable places to work during the day, plus a restaurant, coffee shop, and excellent outdoor spaces (a major draw for me)

•	Strong focus on community and lively shared spaces

•	Young, energetic atmosphere right on Rainey

•	Short walk to the Austin Rowing Club, which I occasionally frequent

•	East-facing unit with incredible views of Lady Bird Lake

Paseo Cons:

•	Very large building (\\\~500 units plus \\\~50 hotel rooms), which raises concerns about crowding—especially in shared spaces like the gym

•	East-facing unit on Rainey, so potential noise from nearby bars

•	Increased traffic concerns due to smaller streets and the upcoming Waterline development

•	Slightly longer commute via I-35 compared to MoPac

⸻

415 Colorado Pros:

•	Solid selection of amenities with enough variety to avoid feeling repetitive when working from home

•	Beautiful outdoor space

•	Extremely central location, easy walk south into downtown or out to 6th Street

•	More personalized community events

•	Smaller building (\\\~330 units), which feels more manageable

•	Slightly nicer unit layout with more efficient use of space

415 Colorado Cons:

•	Surrounding area feels more like a business district than a neighborhood

•	Fewer amenities than Paseo, and they’re generally smaller

•	Gym isn’t as well equipped as Paseo’s

•	Unit appliances weren’t as nice compared to Paseo

Any advice or perspectives, especially from those who have lived in or currently live at either building, would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",1,1768507724.0,AustinHousing,0,1.0,False

I wanted to better understand how outside employment or side work is handled in practice.

I’ve read the Standards of Conduct and conflict-of-interest guidance. I was unable to find a policy who explicitly prohibits outside part time employment unless it’s conflict of interest , but I’m hoping to learn how this typically plays out day-to-day. For example:
	•	If someone is licensed as a realtor and does occasional real estate work on weekends, would that generally be allowed if it’s disclosed and unrelated to their government role?
	•	Similarly, what about something clearly unrelated, like working a few shifts at a coffee shop on weekends?
	•	In these kinds of cases, is disclosure usually sufficient, or is formal written approval required?
	•	Are certain types of outside work more likely to be restricted even if done outside government hours?

Chapter 12 released 

Mike had gotten into a routine for the last 9 days; bike 4 miles, hitch a ride with the police cheif, visit Will and catch a ride home with Joyce. Rinse repeat. It had only been a little over a week since Will had come back but Mike felt like his friend would be in the hospital forever. 

Part of him had decided that he would. And without hesitation he knew he would be there for Will that whole time. He hadn't been able to be there for El but Will was still here. He had a chance to save some one that he cared about. He wasn't about to waste that. 

No matter what if he had to stay by that hospital bed for 70 years even, telling the same stories and looking at that same hopeful face, he would do it. He would do anything to keep Will okay. Mentally as well as physically. 

He peddled strongly, letting the familiar bike path almost drive itself; from memory, his mind able to drift somewhere else. He thought about yesterday, how he had been thrown into a flashback, trembling and shaking. How Will had comforted him with no judgment. That soft smile and gentle touch. Will may have come back from the dead but to Mike he was still an angel. Something pure and untouched despite going through Hell to get back to him. He still had this glow. This light that never went away.

It really was amazing. He thought to himself, letting the image linger a little longer. those hazel eyes and eager grin. That youthful chuckle and determination. Dwelling on it made his knees almost buckle mid peddle for some reason and he blinked it away, uncomfortable at the effect.

It didn't take much longer to make it to his little ""bus stop"" where the cheif was waiting. Jim hopper. He had learned the name from Joyce. She seemed to like the cheif quite a lot, though when questioned about it by Johnathan she would deflect and talk about this old highschool friend she had bumped into on the regular. Mike didn't try to eavesdrop but he couldn't help being there and sometimes got a bit of a lore dump on the Byers family by mistake. 

They didn't seem to mind the company though. Mike almost considered them his second family from the amount of times he had been over at their house, enjoying a cozy dinner or late night gaming session with his best friend. It was almost as if they expected him to do this, to show up everyday just to make Will feel better. 

The cheif was speaking into a radio, almost mumbling about waffles or something. ""Uh hey?"" Mike tried to wave but he was still speaking into the radio. ""Hello?"" His voice had a slight edge to it this time but the cheif didn't react.

Mike rolled his eyes. ""Hey Jim, hey Jim hopper!"" His raised voice finally snapped the cop out of his weird, wistfull trance. He fumbled the radio and almost jumped. ""Wheeler. Hey kid. How many times do I have to tell you, just call me Hopper."" 

Mike shrugged and threw his bike in the trunk, opening the passenger side door and hopping up on the seat beside him. ""Fine whatever. Hopper."" He gave him a look that said ""you happy?""
Hopper cleared his throat and pushed the car into drive. 

The truck rumbled along not so quietly due to the rusty engine. ""Waffles huh?"" Mike broke the silence. Hopper flinched with a startled blink. ""What?"" He gripped the steering wheel slightly. 

""Whats so important about waffles?"" He muttered. Hopper sniffed, makinghis mustache twitch, eyes darting around nervously. ""I don't know what you're talking about kid."" He insisted making Mike's gut clench suspiciously. ""You know. Waffles, I heard you muttering about it into that stupid radio."" He pressed

Hopper swallowed, furrowing his brows. ""Alright fine kid, it's just a cop thing okay?"" He sounded upset.
Mike blinked. ""Like a code word?"" 
Hopper nodded. ""Yes. Like a code word."" His gruff tone signaled the end of their conversation. He gave up on the small talk and rested his head on his arm, gazing out the window.

A few moments of silence blended into several minutes when the cheif cleared his throat again. ""Look kid I can't talk about work outside of work  its... unprofessional. ""He sounded apologetic. Mike just murmured agreement but Hopper tried again.

""So this has been going on for quite a while now hasn't it?"" He changed the subject. Mike turned his head. ""Huh?""
""With Will."" 

Mike bristled uncomfortably. ""What about him?"" Hopper raised an eyebrow. ""Just that you're still trying to be there, at the hospital. Are you worried about him?"" He sounded curious. 

It was none of his business! Mike opened his mouth to say so but no sound came out. He looked down. ""No he can take care of himself."" He defended honestly. ""I just want to see him. I want to see him."" He insisted loudly. Hopper had an annoying twinkle in his eye when he nodded. ""You're quite good friends aren't you?""

Mike ignored him, an uncomfortable heat spreading through his cheeks. What was so wrong about visiting a friend in the hospital? A friend who had almost died? He shook it away angrily. Whatever. He didn't care what other people thought anyway. 

They pulled up to the hospital soon after that, Mike jumping out the car as usual. ""Slow down kid."" Hopper grunted the same phrase he always did at the eager attitude the boy wore.
But like every day, Mike didn't slow down and he wasn't listening. He was only thinking about the moment ahead: seeing Will.

He had made it across the parking lot and made it up to the doors when his heart stuttered. He froze, hand reaching towards the door. Wasn't that? It couldn't be, could it? But despite the gnawing disbelief in his chest, there he was. His best friend. 

Will was standing upright all on his own. His hospital gown was gone and he was back to wearing that yellow and red vest. His hair looked like it had been combed slightly by his insistent mother and his rosy cheeks wore a slight smile. He was holding the Will the wise figure and sipping on a cup of cocoa. 

Mike's eyes moistened with surging relief. ""Will."" He whispered. He shook himself and threw open the door. ""Byers!"" He rushed forward, slamming into him in a crushing hug.  ""Mike?"" Will giggled, thankfully the cocoa was in a closed lid coffee cup so it didn't spill. 

They pulled away. Will's joyful expressions was heart melting and Mike spoke first. ""Wh-what are you doing here I thought-"" he stammered excitedly. 
Will was beaming. He placed the figure back in his jacket pocket. ""I- I don't know I just woke up and they told me I could go!"" His eyes were puffy from the emotional send off he undoubtedly had received. ""I get to go home!"" He exclaimed. 

Mike couldn't help his relieved chuckle as he fist bumped his shoulder. ""Just wait until the party hears this, they are going to freak out!"" He gave a small bounce.

Mike glanced up at Joyce, hopeful. ""Mrs. Byers? Can I- can we?"" He could barely form the words he was so happy. Joyce smiled kindly. ""Not tonight. Will needs to come home."" She looked fondly down at her son. ""He can come join you at your house tomorrow okay? We have just missed having him around the house. You understand right?"" She sounded sympathetic. 

Mike's stomach lurched and his face dropped. ""Oh uh yeah yeah. I get it.""
Will seemed just as disappointed, gaze dropping to the floor. Joyce folded her arms. ""But I suppose I wouldn't mind having another mouth to feed."" Her eyes crinkled kindly. ""I am very grateful to have you to keep him company. Why dont you come have lunch with us?""

The boy's subdued nature flipped immediately and they hugged again. ""Yessss!"" 

Joyce laughed briefly. ""Okay okay but sweetie remember don't leave the house-"" she chided.

""After dark."" Will finished. ""I know I know I won't."" He swapped a grin with Mike and they linked arms, dashing to the Byers' car.

Im M25, as far as i can remember i was picky eater. Food was often forced and some screaming from parents was involved (rarerly got physical but it wasnt bad i think). Still living with parents and my mom does just extra meal just for me for my whole life. I never got tested for any mental condition. When im forced or persueded by peers to eat something that ick me i get a sense of fight or flight response. 

I remember one time i was at my ex house and her mother gave us something i wasnt happy to eat. I was mentally ready to just live in that moment from house. I felt like i was closing off from the world around. Some kind of tunnel vision and i remembered that it was always like this. Just when i got older i dont have these encounters with food i dont like that often.

  
I suspected for some time i may be on spectrum, some friends suggested that. I heard that this condition can be a part of it. It makes sense, i think that these reactions to just eating are not ""normal"". I always felt shame when i was at school trip and there was eating in the big room and everyone was eating their food but me was picking the most bland things.

  
how do you guys get trough this, i dont know if i want to spend my life like this

One of the most insidious sources of burnout and anxiety is the feeling of being completely ‘undefined.’ When your boundaries are blurry, your goals are shapeless, and you feel like you are just reacting to the needs of the world, you lose your anchor.

We often think we need a massive, life-altering definition—a five-year plan or a complete identity overhaul. That’s too much pressure. When things feel undefined, the most powerful move is to *define something small.* I call this the **1% Definition Rule.**

### The Tip: Define Your Smallest Boundary

Don't try to define your life. Define where your energy goes *right now* by identifying one single boundary you will enforce in the next 24 hours. This is your 1% definition—a tiny, concrete island of clarity in the sea of overwhelm.

**How to Implement It Today (3 Steps):**

**1. Identify the Energy Leak (The Un-Defined Space):** Think about a recurring situation that drains you the most. Is it checking work emails after 7 PM? Is it agreeing to coffee dates you don't want? Is it allowing a specific family member to interrupt your focus time?

**2. Craft the 1% Definition:** Write down one clear, actionable sentence that defines what you *will not* do in that specific scenario. It must be simple and non-negotiable for the day.

*   *Example Definition:* “I will not check my email app or reply to work messages between 7 PM and 7 AM.”
*   *Example Definition:* “I will end the conversation precisely when I feel my energy dip, without justifying the exit.”
*   *Example Definition:* “I will take the first 15 minutes of my morning for silence, and I will not look at my phone during that time.”

**3. Enforce and Observe:** Implement this small definition immediately. Notice the momentary discomfort when you enforce it, but pay closer attention to the feeling of spaciousness and integrity that follows. 

Starting small gives you undeniable proof that you have the power to draw lines. That small, 1% definition is the first brick in rebuilding a life that feels truly yours, not just a reaction to the demands of the undefined world around you. You are allowed to define yourself, even if it's just one boundary at a time.",1,1768507268.0,Empowish,0,1.0,False

I think about you in the morning, walking in the cold. I walk slowly on purpose so I can think about you longer. I think about you at night, when I miss you in the middle of parties, where I get drunk to think about something other than you, with the opposite effect. I think about you when I see you and also when I don't see you. I would love to do something other than think about you, but I can't. If you know any tricks to help me forget you, let me know.

I just had the worst weekend of my life. I've never missed anyone so much. Without you, my life is a waiting room. 

Is there anything more horrible than a hospital waiting room, with its neon lights and linoleum floor?

 Is it human to do this to me?

What's more, in my waiting room, I'm alone. 
There are no other seriously injured people with blood spilling out to reassure me, no magazines on the coffee table to entertain me, no numbered ticket dispensers to help me wait for my wait to come to an end. My stomach hurts so much and no one can cure me. That's what being in love is: a stomach ache for which the only remedy is you.

Alice. I didn't know that this name would play such a prominent role in my life. I had heard of unhappiness, but I didn't know it was called Alice. Alice, I love you. Two inseparable phrases. Your name isn't Alice, your name is “Alice-I-love-you.”

the global hit game-show where one very lucky lady has the chance to pick from three rich eligible bachelors…

But, there's a twist.

[Ooh…]

Ladies and gentlemen: What's. The. Twist?

[“One of them is a serial killer!”]

That's right!

[Applause]

So, with that violently in mind, please welcome today's leading men:

First, we have Charles. Charles is a heart surgeon. But, is he crazy about your cardiovascular health—or: Just. Plain. Crazy!?

[Cheering]

Next, please say hello to Oglethorpe. Although an airline pilot by trade, his real passion is Cajun cooking. He'll steal your heart, all right. The real question is: Will. He. Then. Fry-It-Up-And-Eat-It!?

[Cheering]

And, finally. Last but not least. Mo-Samson. A former Marine, Mo-Samson is now the proud owner of a nightclub, right here in downtown L.A. Will he make you feel the beat, or: Will. He. Beat. You. Until. You. Can’t. Feel. Anything?!

“Thanks, Randy,” says Felonious Hunk, basking in the crowd's love, his slicked-back black hair reflecting the studio lights. “And thank *you,* Lost Angeles.”

[Applause]

He turns—just as a platform rises from the floor:

A ragged, scared woman is on it.

Hunk looks at her: “Good afternoon, my dear. Perhaps you'd like to say your name *for the benefit of the thousands here in attendance and the millions more watching around the world!*”

“...paula.”

“Speak up, please!”

“Paula,” Paula says, louder.

“Excellent. Excellent. Welcome, Paula—to

Now, tell us: how much money do you make, Paula? What's your salary? Your tax bracket? Come on. Don't be shy. We won't judge.”

“I'm… unem—unemployed,” says Paula.

“Un-employed?”

[Booing]

“Not by choice. I want to work. I really do. But its hard. It's so hard. The job market’s—”

“I'm going to stop you right there, Paula.”

Paula goes silent.

“Do you know why?” he asks.

“Yes,” says Paula softly.

“Tell us.”

“Because… those are excuses, and: excuses. are. for. losers.”

“Verrry good!”

“And, ladies and gentlemen, what do losers deserve?” Hunk asks the riotous, cheering, mad audience.

[“Losers deserve to die!”]

[Applause]

“They do indeed. But—” Back to Paula: “—hopefully that doesn't happen to you. Because you're not a loser, are you, Paula?”

“No.”

“You're here to win, aren't you?”

“Yes, I am.”

“And what better way to do that than to *win at the oldest  game of all:* The Game of Love! And to do it before an adoring live studio audience, on the hit game show

Isn't that right?”

“Yes,” says Paula, forcing a smile.

“Now, for the benefit of anyone tuning in for the first time, I'm going to go over the rules of our entertainment. First, Paula, here, will have fifteen minutes to ask five questions of each of tonight's three bachelors. Two are hot, fuckable and wealthy; one is a psycho killer. Choose wisely, Paula. Because whoever you choose will take you out…” [Laughter] “on a date. What happens on that date—well, that depends on who you choose, if you know what I mean, and I. Know. You. Do!”

Hunk runs a finger ominously along his throat.

Sticks out his tongue.

[Applause]

“I mean, the odds are in your favour.

“66.6%

“Or, as we call it here

[“The Devil’s Odds!”]

“And we want our lovely Paula to succeed, don't we, folks?”

[Cheering. Booing. Shouts of: “Get off the fuckin’ dole!” “I hate the pooooooor!” “Show us them tits, honeybunny!” “Pussy-fucker! Pussyfucker. Pusssssssyfuuuuucker!” “Shout out to New Zork City!”]

“Let's not get ahead of ourselves. There'll be time for tits later. Dead. Or. Alive! Because whatever happens on your date, Paula, you have agreed for us to film and broadcast it live—isn't that right?”

“Yes…”

“We'll. Be. Watching.”

“Now, Paula. Let me ask you this, because I'm sure we're all just *dying* to know: is there anything that we *can't* show? Anything at all?”

She looks down. “No.”

“No matter how pornographic, how cruel, how just. plain. weird. We'll be there!” [Applause] “But if—*if*—something were to happen to you, Paula. Something very, very bad—and, believe me, none of us wants to see it, and I'm sure it won't happen—” [He winks to the audience.] [Applause] “—but, if it does, and you are *assaulted disfigured maimed paralyzed severely burned severely brain damaged quartered cut sliced beaten choked made into leather eaten enslaved or killed,* would that be a crime, Paula?”

“No.”

“And why not?”

“Because—because… I'm already dead.”

“Yesss!”

[Cheering]

“Ladies and gentlemen, did you hear that: the lady is Already Dead! That's right, voluntarily, without coercion and with our freely provided legal help, Paula, here—prior to coming on the show—has filed paperwork in Uzbekistan, whose national laws are recognized by the great city of Lost Angeles, to declare herself *legally deceased* (pending the outcome of the application), which means that you, folks, are officially looking at a

[“Deadwoman!”]

“Uh huh.”

Paula gazes out at the crowd. “And you know what that means,” yells Felonious Hunk to a building full of energy.

[“You. Can't. Kill. What's. Already. Dead!”]

—and we're backstage, where a handful of bored network execs sip coffee from paper cups and talk, while the sounds of the show drift in, muted, a mind-numbing rhythm of [Applause] [Laughter] and [Cheering].

“Who's she gonna choose?”

“Who cares.”

“Which one of them's the serial killer?”

“Oglethorpe, I think.”

“I would have bet on Charles.”

“This is despicable. You all know that, right?” says a young exec named Mandy. Everybody else shuts up. “From a legal standpoint—” someone starts to say, but Mandy cuts him off: “I'm not talking about a legal standpoint. I'm talking about ethics, representation. This show is so fucking heteronormative. It absolutely presumes heterosexuality. All the women are straight. All the bachelors are men. As if that's the only way to be. Bull. Shit. The lack of diversity is, frankly, disturbing. What message does it send? Imagine you're a kid, struggling with your identity, you put on an episode of Date of Destiny and what do you see: a man dating a woman, a man fucking a woman, a man slaughtering a woman. That skews your perspective. It's ideological violence.”

“She's not wrong,” says a male exec. “I mean, woman-on-woman would do numbers. Muff diving, scissoring, whether fatal or not…”

“Shh! She's about to choose.”

*You should stop reading. You don't have to participate in this. Put down the phone, hit back in your browser. Close your laptop. This is disgusting: dehumanizing. Deprive it of an audience. Starve it of attention. It's not fun. You don't want to see Paula get hurt. You don't need to see her naked. You don't want to see her taken advantage of, abused, punished for making the wrong choice. Maybe it wasn't even the wrong choice. Maybe she didn't have a choice. Not anymore. Close your eyes. Please. Please.*

—on stage Paula is biting her lip, her eyes jumping from bachelor to bachelor to bachelor. “Choose, Paula!” says Felonious Hunk. [Whooping] “You have ten seconds. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four…”

“Oglethrope.”

**A FAMILY OF THREE watches TV in an OPEN CONCEPT LIVING ROOM.** TERRY, 36, is bored as fuck playing with LIL BUD, 10, who's fantasizing about stabbing his fat math teacher to death. DONNA, 33, is slicing vegetables on a custom-made KITCHEN ISLAND, high on the prescription meds that get her through the day.

“She shoulda chose Mo,” says Terry.

“I think it's Charles.”

“Shut up. He just brought her home. We'll see what—”

“Damn.”

[Stretch-and: SNAP]

“Is that real? Like, can a human spine actually do that?”

Lil Bud starts crying. “Look away. Look away,” says Donna. “Terry. TERRY! For chrissakes, cover his eyes.”

Terry does—Donna has stopped slicing, placed her knife down on the counter—but Lil Bud is peeking through his dad’s white-knuckled, trembling fingers, as Donna puts her own hand over her gaping mouth. “No. No. No.”

“No…”

[Pounding]

They’re all staring.

The screen flickers, bleeding different colours of light into the room, bathing their faces in whites and pinks, yellows and dark.

[Breathing]

[Bang.]

[Breathing]

[Bang.]

[Breathing] 

[Breathing]

Red.

“What’s he—” asks, sobbing, Lil Bud.

“Shut-the-fuck-up, son.”

Blue. Flash.

[M-m-moaning]

“Just watch.”

-ing to an absolute blackness—flickering light returning gradually, illuminating the living room: the family of three, all together, unable to look away. Unwilling. Unwanting. “Is she…” “No, not yet.” Donna pukes all over the counter.. [Faint breathing] “Is that…” “Her skin.” “Yes.” “No...” “Yes,” Lil Bud whimpers. Donna wipes her face. Terry turns up the volume: [Hissing] [Silence] [Drilling] [Silence] “This is like the best episode ever.” “She got eviscerated.” “When I grow up,” says Lil Bud, barely: “I—” “Wow.”

**ON THE SCREEN: OGLETHORPE,** naked, covered in blood, snaps his head sideways to look directly into the camera:

Smiling, bits of meat between his teeth, one eyeball hanging from its socket by a thread (“What even is that?”) he leaves what remains of one pile of Paula, and crawls forward until his lusting, satiated face fills the entire frame, as if he’s looking through: looking in: and, as he keeps pushing

the TV screen—membranous—distends.

“Holy fuck,” says Terry.

Lil Bud’s gasping.

Donna picks up her puke-covered knife from the counter.

The screen is bulging—two feet into the living room. Like a basketball being forced against a trampoline. Three, four feet. It’s tearing. The screen is fucking tearing. And a blood-wet head is pushing through. And all Terry can do is stand and watch. “Do something!” Donna yells, moving from the kitchen island towards the TV, when—***plop***—Oglethorpe’s smile penetrates the room, his face birthed into it—fluid gushing from the stretched-out tear, dripping onto the brand new hardwood floor.

Next a hand, an arm. Followed by a shoulder.

Donna stabs him.

The knife sticks in Oglethorpe’s neck.

Blood-froth forms on his lips.

He steps out of the grossly-distended screen and fully into the open concept living room.

The screen itself falls like useless folds of excess skin.

Like a popped balloon.

Terry mov—

Oglethorpe grabs the hilt of the knife lodged in his neck, and in one motion rips the blade out and swings it, slicing Terry’s face.

Terry covers up.

Someone screams *outside the house.*

The wound in Oglethorpe’s neck: two ends of a severed, spewing vein jut out. He grabs them, ties them in a knot.

He kicks Lil Bud in the head.

Donna runs toward him, but Oglethorpe stops her, grabs her, dislocates her shoulder, then shoves three fingers deep down her throat, picks her up by the face and throws her across the room. She smashes into a stainless steel refrigerator, before collapsing into a heap on the tiles.

Terry’s face is a flowing red curtain.

Oglethorpe grabs his own hanging eyeball and rips it free.

Donna writhes.

Terry is trying to breathe.

Oglethorpe throws the now-severed eyeball straight into Terry’s gaping mouth—who starts to choke on it—who’s waving his arms, and Lil Bud bites Oglethorpe in the foot before getting up and (“R-u-n,” Terry chokes out.) is now running for the hallway, for the front door, fiddling with the lock. Back in the living room, Oglethorpe smashes a glass table, collects a long shard. Laughter. Lil Bud gets the lock open. Donna begs, pleads. Turns the knob, pushes open the door and runs into **a suburban street of utter madness.**

Car alarms. Broken windows. People fleeing.

Oglethorpes chasing.

Limbs.

Heads and guts, all tossed together and crackle-bonfire’ing.

Oglethorpe laughing, dragging a neighbour’s still-living, arms flailing, torso across a freshly-refinished asphalt driveway, staining it red. The man’s husband runs out, and another Oglethorpe crushes his skull with a spade.

To hisleft you notice police sirens the lines you’re reading inthedistance start to come apart & lose their meaning forced apart like slats ofthis as one of the Oglethorpes comes toward you. What is this? What’s hap—pening? “Please don’t do it. No. Ple-ee-ase.”

pushing through between the lines of text on your device. Fingernails dirty with dead human *I told you to stop reading* essence. *Now it’s too late* in the day thestreetlights turn on and Lil Bud gets Oglethorpe’s hand is sticking out of your screen, curved fingers feeling around like snakeheads, trying to touch something.

You back away.

But you can’t back away far enough.

A wall. Oglethorpe’s arm is out to the elbow, palm finding a solid surface, using it to pull more of himself out of your screen.

Go on, try negotiating with him. See what he wants.

Answer: to kill you.

You can smell him now. I know you can.

Try begging for your life.

Stop crying. Beg for your life!

*I’ll… I’ll… I’ll do any-y-y-thing. Ju-st l-l-let me go.* Even a few minutes ago your room felt so safe, didn’t it? [“Yes. It. Did.”] You were just reading a story. *I told you to stop fucking reading it!* Question: who else is there with you? Oglethorpe knows, because he’s right there with you. The screen’s broken. It would have been safer to read a book. Once upon a time these were just words. Now they’re

His hot breath on your face.

His hands.

Nails scrape your soft, fleshy arms.

Tongue licks your neck.

Your heart’s pounding you into place and y-y-yo—

Blink.

Wish this was a dream.

Wish it.

1qdtrrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildToAttract/comments/1qdtrrl/how_to_flirt_like_you_actually_know_what_youre/,How to Flirt Like You Actually Know What You're Doing: The Psychology That Works,"okay so i've been studying the psychology of attraction for like 2 years now because honestly? i was terrible at this. read a bunch of books, listened to research on podcasts, watched way too many youtube videos about social dynamics. and i've noticed that most people (myself included at one point) completely misunderstand what flirting actually is.

we think it's some scripted performance where you deliver smooth pickup lines and hope for the best. but here's what i learned from actual research and experts, not from some pickup artist selling courses.

1. stop trying to impress, start trying to connect



this is probably the biggest mind shift. flirting isn't about showcasing how interesting you are. it's about creating a playful, comfortable space where both people feel seen. Dr. Monica Moore (a psychologist who literally studied flirting behaviors for decades) found that the most successful flirts weren't the most attractive or witty people. they were the ones who made others feel good about themselves.

practical move: ask questions that go slightly deeper than surface level, but keep it light. instead of ""what do you do?"" try ""what's the best part of your week usually?"" or ""what's something you're looking forward to?"" then actually listen and respond to what they say. people can smell fake interest from a mile away.

2. use the triangular gaze (sounds weird, works stupidly well)



read about this in The Like Switch by Jack Schafer (ex FBI behavior analyst, insanely good read on building rapport). when you're talking to someone you're into, let your eyes move in a triangle: eye to eye, then briefly down to their mouth, then back up. it's subtle but signals romantic interest without being creepy.

the key word here is briefly. don't stare at their lips like a vampire. just a quick glance every now and then during conversation. it creates this low key tension that feels natural.

3. touch (but make it make sense)



ugh this one stresses people out but it doesn't have to. research from Oxford University showed that light, appropriate touch increases attraction and connection. but you gotta calibrate it right.

safe moves: touch their arm lightly when you're laughing at something they said. a brief hand on the shoulder when you're moving past them. high fives (yeah i know it sounds middle school but it works). the goal is just to break that physical barrier in a way that feels organic, not forced.

if they lean in or reciprocate, good sign. if they pull back slightly, respect that boundary immediately.

4. be genuinely curious, not interview mode



there's a difference between interrogating someone and showing curiosity.

bad: ""where are you from?"" ""what do you do?"" ""do you have siblings?"" (this is a job interview)

better: follow the thread of conversation naturally. if they mention they're tired, ask ""late night or early morning?"" if they say they just got back from somewhere, ""okay you have to tell me the best thing you ate there."" it flows better and shows you're actually paying attention.

if you want to go deeper on communication skills and understanding attraction patterns, there's an AI learning app called BeFreed that pulls from psychology research, dating experts, and books on social dynamics. You type in what you want to improve, like ""become better at flirting as an introvert,"" and it creates a personalized audio learning plan. You can customize the depth too, starting with a quick 10-minute overview or going into a 40-minute deep dive with real examples. It also has a virtual coach you can chat with about your specific struggles, which is helpful when you're trying to figure out why certain interactions feel off.

5. playful teasing > compliments (sometimes)



i used to think compliments were the move. and yeah, they work, but they're kinda expected. teasing (the kind that's lighthearted, never mean) creates way more spark.

Matthew Hussey talks about this a lot (dating coach, has some solid youtube content). the idea is to gently challenge them or joke around in a way that's fun, not insulting.

examples: they mention they're competitive, you say ""oh great, another one. i'm already scared."" they're wearing a band shirt, ""okay but have you actually been to their concert or are you just here for the aesthetic?""

it works because it's unexpected and shows confidence. but read the room. some people don't vibe with teasing and that's totally fine.

6. mirror their energy (but not like a robot)



there's legit neuroscience behind this. when you subtly match someone's body language, tone, and energy level, it builds rapport on a subconscious level. if they're leaning in, you lean in. if they're speaking softly, lower your volume a bit. if they're animated and using their hands, get a little more expressive yourself.

don't copy every single move because that's weird and obvious. just generally match their vibe. it signals compatibility and makes the interaction feel more natural.

7. create inside jokes early



this is so underrated. inside jokes = instant intimacy. something funny happens during your conversation? reference it later. they mispronounce a word? playfully bring it up again. you both notice something ridiculous? that's your thing now.

The Art of Charm podcast (great for social dynamics btw) talks about how shared experiences, even tiny ones, create bonds faster than almost anything else. inside jokes are basically mini shared experiences you can build in real time.

8. be okay with silence



everyone panics during conversational lulls but honestly? comfortable silence is a green flag. if you're constantly scrambling to fill every gap with words, it signals anxiety.

sometimes just smile, take a breath, look around, then naturally continue when something comes to mind. it shows you're comfortable in your own skin and not desperate to perform.

9. end on a high note



don't overstay your welcome. when the conversation is really flowing and you're both laughing, that's actually the perfect time to exit. say you need to get back to your friends, or you have to head out, but you'd love to continue this sometime.

people remember peaks and endings. if you leave when things are great, they'll remember the interaction as great. if you linger until it gets awkward or boring, that's what they'll remember.

get their number or social by making it specific. not ""we should hang out sometime"" but ""i'm checking out this new coffee place saturday morning, you should come."" specific plans convert way better than vague suggestions.

10. stop overthinking every tiny thing



this might be the most important one. attraction isn't some precise formula where if you say the wrong thing everything explodes. most people are way more forgiving than you think. they're probably nervous too.

one book that really helped me chill out about this stuff was Models by Mark Manson (same guy who wrote The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck). his whole thing is about being authentic and vulnerable instead of playing games. turns out people are attracted to realness, not perfection.

look, you're gonna fumble sometimes. you're gonna misread signals. you're gonna think of the perfect thing to say three hours after the conversation ends. that's normal. the goal isn't to be smooth 100% of the time. it's to be present, genuine, and playful in the moment.

and honestly? someone who's into you will appreciate your authentic awkwardness way more than a rehearsed performance anyway. just get out there and practice. it's a skill like anything else. you'll get better.",2,1768506566.0,BuildToAttract,0,1.0,False

For me, it’s the way Brazil treated both the formerly enslaved Black population and the immigrants who arrived afterward during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

While Brazil is often seen as a multicultural ""melting pot"" with diasporas from all over the world, it’s important to note that a primary reason the government heavily encouraged immigration (mostly European, but later Asian) was to replace the Black workforce.

Brazil was the last country in the Americas to abolish slavery (1888). In the years leading up to abolition, there was a heated debate about what would happen to the massive population of soon to be free people and a lthough some congressmen had decent proposal, with stuff similar to the US Homestead Act to at least provide land for self-sustenance, the government ultimately decided to end slavery without providing any support or reparations.

Scientific racism was getting really popular with our elites and the ruling landowner class argued that ""former slaves were too used to coercion and wouldn't make good paid workers."" This led to the ""replacement model"" bringing in Euros to ""whiten"" the population and take over the jobs. But even those immigrants were mistreated; they were promised land, but many had their passports confiscated upon arrival and were trapped in debt bondage on coffee plantations.

It’s interesting how little this is discussed, both here in Brazil and abroad. Does your country have a similar ""hidden"" historical shame?",4,1768506503.0,AskTheWorld,26,1.0,False

1qdtqb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1qdtqb3/how_to_make_small_talk_people_actually_want_to/,How to Make Small Talk People Actually WANT to Have with You: The Psychology That Works,"Let's be real: most small talk sucks. It's that awkward dance where you're desperately trying to fill silence with ""How's the weather?"" while internally screaming. But here's what I've learned after diving deep into communication research, social psychology books, and analyzing hundreds of actual conversations: the people who make small talk feel effortless aren't just naturally gifted. They're using specific techniques that anyone can learn.



I used to think I was just ""bad at small talk."" Turns out, I was doing it completely wrong. After studying everyone from FBI negotiators to top podcasters, I realized small talk isn't about talking at all. It's about making the other person feel something. And that changes everything.



 Step 1: Ditch the Interview Mode



Most people treat small talk like a boring job interview. ""Where are you from?"" ""What do you do?"" ""How's work?"" This isn't conversation, it's data collection. And it's why people's eyes glaze over.



Chris Voss, former FBI hostage negotiator and author of Never Split the Difference (this book is insanely good for understanding human communication, not just negotiations), talks about how questions can feel like interrogations. Instead of asking questions, try making observations or sharing something first.



Bad: ""What do you do for work?""

Better: ""This event is way bigger than I expected. I almost turned around when I saw the crowd.""



See the difference? You're giving them something to react to instead of putting them on the spot. It's lower pressure, more natural, and actually creates connection.



 Step 2: Go Deep Fast (But Not Creepy)



Surface-level chat about weather and traffic keeps you stuck in boring territory. But you can't just jump to ""What's your biggest fear?"" either. The trick is going one level deeper than expected without getting weird about it.



Use what psychologist Arthur Aron calls ""escalating self-disclosure."" His famous study showed that strangers who asked each other increasingly personal questions (but still appropriate) felt closer than people who stuck to small talk. You're not trying to be their therapist. You're just skipping the bullshit.



Instead of: ""How was your weekend?""

Try: ""Did you do anything this weekend that actually recharged you, or was it just catching up on life admin?""



This invites them to share something real without being invasive. Most people are dying to talk about something meaningful, they just need permission.



 Step 3: Master the Follow-Up



Here's where most people fail: they ask a question, get an answer, then immediately pivot to something completely unrelated. It feels disjointed and makes the other person feel unheard.



Celeste Headlee, NPR host and author of We Need to Talk (seriously one of the best communication books out there, she interviewed thousands of people and breaks down exactly what makes conversations work), says the secret is threading. Take one detail from what they just said and pull on it.



Them: ""I just got back from hiking in Colorado.""

Bad response: ""Cool. I went to Florida last month.""

Good response: ""Colorado hiking is next level. Was this a solo trip or did you drag friends along?""



You're building on what they gave you instead of steering back to yourself. This is how you turn small talk into actual conversation.



 Step 4: Use the ""Hook, Story, Question"" Framework



This one's a game changer from Vanessa Van Edwards, behavioral scientist and founder of Science of People. When you're sharing something about yourself, don't just state facts. Make it interesting.



Hook: Something unusual or emotional

Story: Brief context (20 seconds max)

Question: Hand it back to them



Example: ""I just started learning guitar and I'm absolutely terrible at it, but there's something weirdly meditative about sucking at something new. Have you picked up any new hobbies lately that humbled you?""



You're vulnerable (which builds trust), entertaining (which keeps attention), and inclusive (which invites them in). This beats ""I play guitar"" by a mile.



 Step 5: Read the Room (and Their Body Language)



Not everyone wants to chat. Some people are in their heads, tired, or just not in the mood. Joe Navarro, former FBI agent and body language expert, talks about recognizing when someone's ""open"" versus ""closed.""



Open signals: facing you, relaxed posture, making eye contact, leaning in slightly

Closed signals: turned away, arms crossed, short answers, looking around



If someone's closed off, don't take it personally and don't force it. Give them an easy out: ""I'll let you get back to it, but it was good chatting."" They'll appreciate you reading the situation.



 Step 6: Make Them the Expert



People love talking about things they know well. When you position someone as the expert, they light up. This comes from Dale Carnegie's classic How to Win Friends and Influence People (yeah, it's from 1936, but the psychology is still solid).



If someone mentions they're into photography, cooking, rock climbing, whatever, ask them to teach you something small. ""What's one tip you'd give someone just starting out?"" or ""What's the biggest mistake beginners make?""



Suddenly they're not making small talk, they're sharing their passion. And you look genuinely interested because you are.



 Step 7: Embrace the Pause



Silence makes people uncomfortable, so they fill it with garbage. But Krista Tippett, host of the podcast On Being (incredible for understanding deep conversation), intentionally uses pauses to let people think and respond authentically.



When someone finishes talking, wait two full seconds before responding. It feels long, but it gives them space to add something else, and it shows you're actually processing what they said instead of just waiting for your turn to talk.



 Step 8: Exit Gracefully



Ending a conversation badly can ruin an otherwise great interaction. Don't just say ""Well, bye"" and walk away like a robot. Give them a positive note and a reason.



""This was actually a great conversation, I gotta grab another drink but let's continue this if we run into each other later.""



Or if you want to stay connected: ""I'm gonna go say hi to a friend, but we should grab coffee sometime if you're up for it. Can I get your number?""



Clear, friendly, not awkward.



 Resources Worth Checking Out



If you want to actually get good at this, Charisma on Command (YouTube channel) breaks down specific conversational techniques from interviews and shows exactly what works and why. Their analysis of talk show hosts like Conan O'Brien is gold.



For a more structured approach to improving social skills, BeFreed is worth looking into. It's an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia alumni and former Google experts that pulls from communication books, behavioral research, and expert insights to create personalized audio lessons. You can set a specific goal like ""become more confident in group conversations"" or ""master small talk as an introvert,"" and it builds an adaptive learning plan just for you. 



What makes it useful is the depth control, you can do a quick 10-minute summary when you're short on time or go deep with a 40-minute session full of examples and context. Plus you can customize the voice (the smoky, conversational tone works well for this kind of content), and there's a virtual coach you can chat with to get book recommendations or clarify concepts. It connects a lot of the dots between books like the ones mentioned here and makes them more actionable.



For managing social anxiety that makes small talk harder, Finch (app) is surprisingly helpful. It's a self-care app disguised as a cute bird game, but it has daily social goals and reflections that build confidence over time.



The Fine Art of Small Talk by Debra Fine is the most practical book I've found on this. She was painfully shy and engineered her way into becoming a professional speaker. The exercises actually work.



 The Real Secret



Here's the thing nobody tells you: small talk isn't about being interesting. It's about being interested. When you genuinely care about the person in front of you, even for five minutes, everything else falls into place. You stop performing and start connecting.



Most people are starving for real conversation. When you offer it, even in small doses, they remember you. Not because you said something brilliant, but because you made them feel seen. And that's way more valuable than being the funniest person in the room.



Stop trying to impress people. Start trying to understand them. The small talk will fix itself.

1qdti4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/German/comments/1qdti4w/everything_i_wish_someone_had_told_me_about/,Everything I wish someone had told me about learning German,"hey everyone,

here’s what i wish someone sat me down and told me when i was starting out. a lot of it only clicked through trial-by-fire with my fiancé and her family.

we live in an incredible time where there’s so much german content at our fingertips. almost too much to the point you can easily drown in options. so to pay it forward, i put together a comprehensive guide of my tips and resources for anyone who needs a better self-study system. it's a combination of linguistics research, practical advice from other successful german speakers and my own personal experience as a chronic procrastinator and easily distracted learner.

this is mainly for A2-B1 folks aiming for B2. if you're starting from zero, you need to get a foundation of basic grammar and vocab first. if you're already B2+, you probably don't need this.

**disclaimer:** some of these techniques and resources may not be right for you. everyone's brain is different, so experiment with different methods. find what clicks for you, your schedule, and timeline.

**CORE VOCAB**

learning vocab is like eating your vegetables. you've gotta do it every damn day, regardless of your level. without a foundation of core vocab, listening practice is just noise.

once you know the most frequent 800-1000 words you'll understand a majority of everyday spoken language. you can unlock most movies and news around 5000 words. regardless of the exact numbers, you need these building blocks as your foundation so you can start learning through immersion ASAP.

if you haven’t heard of SRS (spaced repetition), [ANKI](http://ankiweb.net) is the king of vocabulary memorization. **10-25 new vocab cards per day** is the sweet spot for most people. i'm a visual learner so i put images on the back of mine. some people do audio and example sentences as well, but keep it simple.

**leverage cognates**. you already know more vocabulary than you think, because thousands of german words are very similar to english (e.g. Haus, Wasser, Musik, gut). this is a massive shortcut for building vocabulary. watch out for false friends though... i remember the first time someone asked if ""I had my Handy"" lol.

skip Duolingo. it's a dopamine casino designed to create the illusion of progress.

**LISTENING**

once you've got your base vocabulary locked in (even 100 words is enough to start with beginner content), listening is the easiest skill to practice passively and on the go.

30 minutes in the car = 30 minutes of free listening practice.

there is a ton of free content out there. just spend some time finding content that is:

1. at your level of comprehensible input - i.e. in the goldilocks zone of understanding
2. is interesting to you, so you actually pay attention

**music**

music is my favorite hack for comprehensible input. find music you like, listen to the songs on repeat to train your ear. then you'll be even more motivated to translate a few lines of song every day to collect more vocabulary and grammar. it's always fun when you find a song you love and then find out what they are actually saying. Bosse and Die Toten Hosen are a couple of my recent favorites.

**podcasts**

\- Easy German Podcast (B1-B2, casual conversations \*THE BEST\*)   
\- Slow German mit Annik Rubens (A2-B1, clear speech)  
\- Coffee Break German (A2-B1)  
\- Apokalypse & Filterkaffee (B2+, daily news)  
\- Deutsch - warum nicht? (A1-B1, Deutsche Welle classic)

**youtube**

the best way to do this is to create a new account and watch only german content. the algorithm will pick it up fast. use the language reactor plugin to get subtitles in german and your native language at the same time.

channels:  
  
\- Easy German (A1-B2, street interviews)  
\- Learn German with Anja (A1-B1, entertaining, personable)  
\- Deutsch lernen Extra auf Deutsch (13 episode sitcom aimed at german learners)  
\- Kurzgesagt (B1-B2, science, clear narration, lots of cognates)  
\- Deutsch mit Marija (A2-B2, grammar explanations)  
\- Dein Sprachcoach (A1-B1, practical phrases)

**tv shows and movies**

the key unlock for me was rewatching my favorite shows or movies dubbed in German. when you already know the plot, your brain can focus on comprehension of the language instead of trying to follow what’s happening. (pokemon is my go to).

if you don't want to replay the same old hits, the next best thing is a simple plot line and everyday common scenarios. if you needed an excuse to watch trashy reality tv, you now have one.

**comedy**

\- Ladykracher  
\- Knallerfrauen  
\- Stromberg (german office)

**reality tv**  
  
\- Germany's Next Top Model  
\- Das Perfekte Dinner (cooking)  
\- Der Bachelor

**netflix**  
when you’re ready to jump in the deep end.

\- Dark (sci-fi thriller)  
\- How to Sell Drugs Online Fast (coming-of-age dark humor/crime)  
\- Babylon Berlin (1920s noir)

some people have strong opinions on english vs german vs no subtitles. just do whatever best suits your current level and the complexity of the content.

the key is to get your ears used to the sounds. don’t do what i did at first, which was try to translate or look up every single word i didn’t know. embrace the exposure.

**SPEAKING**

production is the biggest struggle and also the most anxiety-inducing. my #1 advice here is to speak early and often, before you feel ready.

talk to yourself. talk to your dog. talk to anyone who will entertain your “stuck in the present tense” caveman-speak. something i learned in my linguistics class in college that's stuck with me is that you're not just training your mind, you're training your mouth to move in new ways.

also don’t sleep on the fact that **speaking is** **the gateway to more comprehensible input.** ""Wie sagt man...?"" and Was heißt...? are arguably the two most powerful tools in your tool box. 

**learn to speak in chunks, not individual words.**

this one helps a lot with the “stop translating in your head” issue. without boring you too much on the concept of a lexical item, native speakers comprehend words in 2, 3, and 4+ chunks of words that when combined form a natural phrase, fixed expression, or idiom with unique meaning (e.g. Alles klar, Das stimmt, Guten Morgen).  the sooner you stop thinking in individual words and start using these bigger chunks, the sooner you begin to speak automatically without translating.

**filler words and transitions**

an often overlooked area of focus is the glue that ties your sentences together. knowing even a handful of words like “genau”, “also”, and “na ja” go a long way in maintaining rhythm and sounding more like a native speaker.

**conversational practice tools**

if you’re tired of speaking to yourself and need a sparring partner, tools like chatgpt and [boraspeak](http://boraspeak.com/?lang=german) are great daily drivers for speaking practice. you can use these as a general conversation partner, to get grammar and pronunciation corrections, or for more structured practice repeating real-world scenarios.

to practice pronunciation, use the **shadowing technique** to listen to a native speaker and then repeat their sentences for 10-15 minutes at a time.

the gold standard is going to be speaking with **a tutor** or taking a class. i've had decent results with online tutors on [italki](http://italki.com/), but they are expensive and can take a while to find one that vibes with you.

**language exchange partners** are free but inconsistent and hard to find. i'd avoid personally.

that said, if you can find **a study buddy** who's at a similar or higher level to you, it will be a game changer because you can study together, share notes, and keep each other accountable. the best is just taking turns talking about your day. you’re not going to get the feedback of an expert, but having a real person on the other side of the table always beats talking to yourself.

**READING**

honestly this is the most boring skill for me. i prefer to listen and read at the same time with subtitles, but some people swear by it. just don't jump to anything that's too complex immediately.

**books**

i would start with a book you already read in your native language and loved, along the same lines of reusing content you enjoy and already understand. the classic is Harry Potter (shoutout to Tom Vorlost Riddle).

some other good options are:

\- Emil und die Detektive (A2-B1, classic children's)  
\- Tintenwelt series (B1, young adult trilogy)  
\- Der kleine Prinz (german version of Le Petit Prince)

**graded readers**  
\- Klett  
\- Andre Klein

**news**  
\- Deutsche Welle (A2-B1)  
\- [nachrichtenleicht.de](http://nachrichtenleicht.de) (A2-B1)  
\- Der Spiegel (B2+)  
\- Die Zeit (B2+)

**word counters for the data nerds**  
i personally haven’t used them, but for those who like to track exactly how many thousands of words they’ve read, i think there’s a few like LingQ and Readlang.

**WRITING**

**write a daily journal entry.** i love this one. it helps you structure your thoughts, learn high frequency vocab that you'll actually use to express yourself, and get ready for speaking. it's also cool to go back and see your progress over the weeks and months.

check out the r/WriteStreakGerman  subreddit for daily practice and corrections.

**KEY TAKEAWAYS**

\- immersion. immersion. immersion. surround yourself with german 24/7. that means when commuting, doom scrolling, cooking, etc.

\- creating new habits is good, but integrating german into your existing life is even better

\- it's never too early to start speaking, don't wait until you feel ""ready.""

\- consistency beats intensity, don't burn yourself out

\- don't rush the foundation. but once you have it, your ability to learn from comprehensible input will snowball

so yeah, that's pretty much everything i've got. hope it helps and most importantly, just get out there and **talk about things you enjoy with people you enjoy.** if you’re having fun, you’re going to improve.",8,1768505963.0,German,3,1.0,False

Well this experience has been a traumatising one. I have some how unleashed an unworldly huge poo, to the point it sticks out of the water and the girth of it makes it impossible to flush. My partner and I get sickly around these sort of things and are both too intimidated to confront this abomination.

My partner is already screaming at me because we have family coming over tonight for a barbecue and need our toilet available tonight. I'm just really glad it's not going to be hot today as it already has a strong pungent to it.

So my question is does anyone have recommendations for a plumber that specialises in unclogging massive smelly poos?

Obviously everything has gone up in price but I'm now paying $19.99 / lb for ground coffee at Trade Fair which seems insane. I was just paying $8.99/lb not too long ago. I've tried Mighty Oak based on recommendations on reddit for high quality coffee but its even more expensive.

  
Does anyone have any economical recommendations in the neighborhood? I live near 30 av, do not own a coffee grinder myself (I tried, and it makes a mess of everything and you need a really expensive unit to grind coarse enough for cold brew (if anyone has any suggestions that can change my mind feel free to share)).

She messaged me first. Nothing unusual. Just a normal opener.

A few messages in, she asked very directly:  
“Are you rich?”

I answered honestly. I said I didn’t really know what rich meant  depends on who you ask. She pushed a bit. I deflected with humor and told her I already had a sugar mommy. Half joke. Half shield.

She laughed. That’s when she knew I wasn’t the sugar daddy she was fishing for. And oddly, that’s when the conversation settled.

We talked about normal things. Delhi  the AQI, how people live with it. Kerala  rain, food, slower days. College, random life stuff. No pitch. No pressure.

She didn’t sell a story. She didn’t ask for money. She stayed because the agenda was gone.

Later, she opened up.

She said she wanted to finish her studies, get into a corporate job, climb fast using whatever advantages she had, retire rich, stay single, and live alone with a small Shih Tzu. No marriage. No emotional dependence.

She spoke about sex like it carried no feelings. Not provocatively  more like a conclusion she’d already reached.

When I asked why, she explained.

She was orphaned young. Lived with relatives. It was her uncle who abused her. After that, intimacy stopped feeling safe. Sex became transactional  controlled, detached, survivable.

She didn’t dramatize it. She didn’t ask for sympathy. She said it calmly, like something she’d already organized in her head. She didn’t sound broken. She sounded organized.

What stayed with me was that she knew I wasn’t her client yet she spoke openly anyway. Maybe because when someone isn’t trying to take something from you, it’s easier to talk.

Before ending the conversation, I wished her well. Told her I hoped she finished her studies and got where she wanted to go.

I added, casually, that if I was ever in Delhi, I’d like to grab a coffee or go for a walk.

She smiled and replied without missing a beat:  
“I only go out with sugar daddies.”

And that was it.

No awkwardness. No bitterness. Just the conversation ending where it was always going to end.

I still think about it sometimes. Not because of the sugar daddy part  but because it felt like listening to someone explain how they learned to survive, not how they wanted to live.",5,1768505769.0,Coconaad,2,0.86,False

The real gateway drug in my experience is caffeine. Before I started drinking coffee, I was a teetotaller. I even avoid cocoa, vanilla and other spices, nutmeg and so on to avoid their Psychoactivity. But not long after getting a Nespresso and taking up coffee drinking to seem more sophisticated, I started smoking tobacco. Drinking Green Tea, Coca Cola, and some times even red bull. I started eating more Dark Chocolate. And even started drinking Red Wine and Drinking Lotus Flow - including Blue Lotus tea! I was hooked on all this stuff  at the tender age of just 20 and my I think my health started taking a hit as a result. Now I am 24 I vowed I would go cold turkey on this bullshit theobrome, caffeine, nucifera and other nasty drugs now only thing I  do regularly is cannabis if you can even call that a drug.

I’m planning to move to Austin this coming March, and after touring over 10 different apartments, I’ve narrowed my decision down to Paseo and 415 Colorado. I’d really appreciate any advice or insight.

Context:

•	I’ve already applied to an apartment in both buildings

•	Pricing is essentially the same once incentives are included

•	Age: 24 (M)

•	Work: Commute to the Domain, with 1–2 work-from-home days per week

•	I’ve interned in Austin for several summers and have previously lived downtown

⸻

Paseo Pros:

•	Outstanding, wide-ranging amenities with many comfortable places to work during the day, plus a restaurant, coffee shop, and excellent outdoor spaces (a major draw for me)

•	Strong focus on community and lively shared spaces

•	Young, energetic atmosphere right on Rainey

•	Short walk to the Austin Rowing Club, which I occasionally frequent

•	East-facing unit with incredible views of Lady Bird Lake

Paseo Cons:

•	Very large building (\~500 units plus \~50 hotel rooms), which raises concerns about crowding—especially in shared spaces like the gym

•	East-facing unit on Rainey, so potential noise from nearby bars

•	Increased traffic concerns due to smaller streets and the upcoming Waterline development

•	Slightly longer commute via I-35 compared to MoPac

⸻

415 Colorado Pros:

•	Solid selection of amenities with enough variety to avoid feeling repetitive when working from home

•	Beautiful outdoor space

•	Extremely central location, easy walk south into downtown or out to 6th Street

•	More personalized community events

•	Smaller building (\~330 units), which feels more manageable

•	Slightly nicer unit layout with more efficient use of space

415 Colorado Cons:

•	Surrounding area feels more like a business district than a neighborhood

•	Fewer amenities than Paseo, and they’re generally smaller

•	Gym isn’t as well equipped as Paseo’s

•	Unit appliances weren’t as nice compared to Paseo

Any advice or perspectives, especially from those who have lived in or currently live at either building, would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",2,1768505622.0,askaustin,2,1.0,False

The results were horrifying.

$847 total. On things I literally forgot I bought within a week.

Coffee runs. Gas station snacks. Amazon impulse purchases at 2am. App subscriptions I don't use. ""It's only $5"" repeated 170 times.

That's a car payment. That's half my rent. That's money I constantly complain I don't have for savings or emergencies, meanwhile I'm spending it on shit I can't even remember buying.

The worst part? I was on my laptop going through my bank statement and kept seeing charges I had to Google because I genuinely didn't recognize them. Turns out they were MY purchases from two weeks ago that I'd already completely forgotten about.

The ""it's only $5"" mentality is killing me financially. Each purchase feels insignificant so I don't think about it. But small leaks sink ships, and apparently I've been slowly drowning my bank account $5 at a time.

Starting to actually track and budget this month. If I can cut even half of this unnecessary spending, that's $400+ back in my pocket monthly. For literally nothing except not buying shit I don't need and won't remember.

[Breville Oracle Jet],"Hi all, I hope you are well. I have recently upgraded from a Nespresso machine to a Breville espresso machine after my neighbour discovered her husband was cheating on her and gave away all of his items, one of which was the coffee machine to me! I am in the process of learning how to use the machine and I’m wondering if I should use the single or the double wall filter for a bag of lavazza beans from Costco (I understand the recommendation is to get freshly ground beans but that is sadly out of my budget for right now!)

I was using the double wall filter originally and my coffee came out well (at 37 seconds but I know this is not ideal). Then i learned after the fact that a double wall filter is meant for pregrounded coffee and I should use the single wall (although my shot came out to 47 seconds). Now I’m learning that a single wall is actually meant for fresh beans. I’m assuming even though it’s a recently opened bag of beans, because I don’t know the date of production, lavazza doesn’t count as fresh beans so should I go back to a double wall filter?",1,1768505501.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

1qdt72b,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qdt72b/my_job_gave_me_a_small_raise_to_work_the_night/,"My job gave me a small raise to work the night shift, I just found out why.","Hi Reddit!

I’ve never made a post like this before, but I’ve been having a couple of problems at my job. For some background I’ve been working the night shift at this “24/7” (well, its actually more like 22/5) car dealership. I know that's kind of weird, but we’ve had a lot of management changes recently. There have been 6 site managers in the last 3 years, each of them has their own ‘quirks’ that they like to bring with them.

Just to illustrate what I mean: 2 bosses ago they put these little cartoon mascots all over the display room, 3 bosses ago they replaced all the phones with walkie-talkies, 5 bosses ago they started only stocking white tires (“it's cleaner”), and 6 bosses ago, that's when they started the night shift.

Initially I wasn’t too interested, but they told us that the night shift came with a five dollar pay increase, me and my friend jumped right on that! It was great at the start, but eventually my friend finished his degree and moved out of the country. At some point I guess they lost track of the fact that you need 2 people on the night shift and just never replaced him, even though I kept asking.

So that's one problem, and it was 2 bosses ago. Since then I’ve been too afraid to make waves, I stopped going to employee meetings, I stopped asking questions, I kind of need the money.

Anyway, that's not really my question, but to ask it, first I must give you yet more backstory. So without my friend I’m kind of alone at the dealership, which honestly has been fine. I get maybe 1 to 2 customers a week, it's usually someone who for whatever reason needs a car somewhat urgently, these interactions don't last more than 50 minutes at the longest. I’ve had a couple of ‘sketchier’ people come by, sweaty, jittery, trying to pay with cash, but honestly they don't care about you, they're just focused on what they want.

But. Something changed about 2 months ago. A man walked into the showroom. He looked completely average, a white man, mid 50s with neatly combed greying hair, and a matching greying moustache. He was dressed in a neat dress shirt and a blue cardigan. His voice was warm and polite, “Do you mind if I browse the lot?” I said, “feel free, do you need any help?” “I think I’ll be alright, thank you.”

He walked the lot for around 20 minutes before leaving. Not that strange, people do it all the time at a car lot, normally people don't ask to look around, but I think the darkness makes them feel like they should. Every day for the next week, he came back to the lot. He looked at cars, kicking their tires, knocking on the windows, feeling for scratches. He didn’t come into the showroom often, just picked up some brochures on his way out.

Eventually, maybe after a week and a half, I decided to leave the showroom and talk to him, maybe coax him into a sale. The lot at night has always made me a bit nervous, especially with some of the customers we get, but I try to push through it.

I walked into the lot, in the light of the lot’s overhead flood-lamps I saw him crouching beside the tires of a 2024 Toyota Camry SE in Predawn Gray (with a black SofTex interior). “Hello sir, can I help you with anything, I’ve noticed you here a few times, is there anything I can clear up?”

The man jumped a bit, he was seemingly surprised that someone would be there. For some reason his reaction made me feel calmer, he seemed utterly normal. “Oh, no I’m just browsing,” he replied, “If I need to leave, that's fine, I just like looking at the cars.”

At this point, I wasn’t really surprised by the response, “Oh that's perfectly fine, please let me know if there's anything you need, the showroom is always open.” I smiled an ironic smile, most of the customers get that the job isn’t great. “Well, if it gets boring in there, you feel free to come out and see me,” he seemed to realize what I meant, returning with a pitying smile.

After that night I continued to see him in the lot, it wasn’t until a few days later when I decided to take him up on the offer. For the next few weeks we walked the lot together for the 45 or so minutes that he tended to stay. He told me about his job (manager of a cardboard distribution hub) his family life (a wife, two kids, and a pet dog), his antique engraved rice collection, all pretty normal stuff.

I always got the impression that he was a little unsatisfied, wanted a better job, kids that listened to him, more rice probably. After those couple weeks he started to joke that I was his ‘second family.’ I know that's weird but, it's just hard to explain how that environment makes you feel. You’re so entirely alone that any human connection in those 8 hours is more meaningful than anything else the rest of the day.

Things were great, for about a month, he started bringing me lunches, just a sandwich, or a bag of chips, or he’d show me funny pictures on his phone, just stuff, friend stuff.

Then one day another customer came in mid way through his visit, a tall skinny man with an oversized hoodie, sweaty, greasy blonde hair and a stressed expression, “Hey, I need a car.” My new friend looked uncomfortable, “is this going to be a problem?” I told him it was fine, he looked at the greasy man, before leaving the dealership in a hurry.

The blonde man looked annoyed, “Hey, I need a car!” He just pointed at a car out the window and bought it on the spot, luckily not with cash. If you think thats weird take it up with my managers. When the transaction ended I looked out the window expecting to see my friend walking around the lot, but he was gone.

I heard a loud crack on the window and almost fell from my chair. It was the blonde man waving his keys at me, pounding on the window, “This white tire shit man, this is tight, clean as hell!” I like interactions like that, they're kind of nice.

The next day my friend came back, he didn't come into the showroom, just walking around the lot, kicking tires, on retrospect, harder than normal. I decided to see what he was up to and went out to see him, and noticed a quiet, tense expression on his face. I asked him if anything was wrong, “Hi, -friend-, how are you?”

He didn't say anything, just stood there facing the car, but in the low light I could see his eyes were looking at me in the reflection of the window. “Uhhh… hello, are you okay?”

He stood there for another second, his thick eyebrows furrowing in the window, then suddenly turned around, a bright smile on his face, “Oh, don’t worry about me, I’m doing perfectly fine!” “Sorry, I just had a long day, you know how it is, I’m sure.”

The rest of the night was fine, we talked a little bit about the cars, nothing deeper than that. He stayed shorter than usual that night, maybe 15 minutes. Thinking back, I think he was wearing the same clothes as the day before.

The next two days were my days off, nothing happened.

There’s about an hour when the dealership is completely closed, and the lot is left completely unattended during the transition between shifts. I came in a bit earlier than usual during that time to drop off my stuff and walk to a nearby coffee shop (that I heard about reddit actually). I parked my car at the back of the dealership, and started walking around to the front.

Just as I was about to turn the corner I noticed a man standing in front of the doors exactly how- sorry I can’t call him my friend anymore, let's just call him “Harry.” Harry was standing in front of the store just as he had the previous night, just staring.

Something about it just freaked me out. Maybe it was the fact that it wasn’t quite dark yet, and I was seeing him in nearly normal lighting, but it's just not right to see someone like that. I didn’t want him to know I saw him like that, so instead of going to the coffee shop I returned to the back of the store and went into the dealership through the back door.

The sense of danger hadn’t fully set in, I started thinking about how nice he had been, maybe he just needed someone to talk to. I slowly walked into the room, making sure to obviously turn on lights as I did. By the time I reached the show room he was no longer standing in front of the door, instead, he was examining the hood of a car just outside of the dealership. I walked up to the front doors and unlocked them.

He whipped around to look at the door, before just as suddenly returning to the hood of the car. He stayed there for a few minutes as I set up the computer system and clocked in. I think he was trying to avoid looking too eager.

After a few minutes he came into the showroom carrying a paper bag and a cup of coffee, “Hi again, sorry about how I was acting last time, I hope I didn’t freak you out or anything.” He looked the same as ever, maybe nicer than he normally did with a fresh hair cut, cleanly shaved, and a strong smell of cologne.

“Oh, no worries Harry, I completely understand.”

He smiled, a broad smile, eyes wide, “I knew you would understand, you always understand.” “Look, I have something to ask you, but first, here I brought you lunch!”

I tried to smile, but clearly it didn’t look right. He continued, “Why don’t you eat that as I tell you about my week, and don’t worry, the food is fresh, I just bought it.” I instinctively reached out and grabbed the food as he held it out to me before opening it.

“Yeah I got the food from that new coffee shop, I know you wanted to try it.”

I really hate this part, I don’t know how he knew it was me. I couldn’t have told him that, I only found out about it on my day off, all I did was reply to a comment online about it. In the moment it didn't register, “Wow thank you so much! Yeah I was actually just about to head over there!”

He looked excited as a I went to take a sip, almost too excited. As I went to set the cup down he looked disappointed, “Oh, is it too hot? Well let's just talk for a minute, you can eat the sandwich.”

He continued, “I’ve been having some problems with my family lately, they just don’t get it, they aren’t what I need, they aren’t perfect, not like you…”

I stopped rummaging in the paper bag, “I… what?”

He ignored what I said, “You’re what I need, and I’m what you need, we’re the real family!” He was sweating now, the beads running down from his hair, his voice got louder, “They had to go, you understand right, they would have stopped us!”

I fully pulled back at this point but I couldn’t move, I felt totally trapped in the building. At that moment a woman had begun walking up to door, Harry saw where I was looking and practically sprinted over to the door to lock it, “Sorry ma’am, we’re closed right now!”

I didn't see what happened to her, but I guess she left. As he ran over to the door, I ran through the building to the back door. I could hear him stomping after me, “WHAT’S WRONG, WHAT DID I DO - IS IT THAT MAN - DID HE -.”

I ran out the door, the outside now dark with the exception of the street lights. Rather than trying to climb the fence behind the dealership I sprinted into the lot, hiding behind a standee of Chip the living tire.

I heard the door slam open, and heavy breathing as he ran into the lot. He wasn’t yelling anymore, clearly realizing that it would draw attention. I saw his feet as he walked by, he wasn't trying to hide his presence, as he walked through the rows of cars I could hear him whispering, ""Im sorry if I scared you, I was just worried, you shouldn’t talk to him, that, that sweaty disgusting man, he made me realize what I had to do. For us!…""

He walked further away, and I couldn't hear him anymore just his heavy footsteps as he walked through the lot. Once I thought he was far enough I went to pull out my phone, before realizing it was still in the building. I did however have my management assigned walkie talkie which was completely useless in this situation.

I decided my best shot was to run. I ran for it, towards the road, as fast as I could. He didn't bother trying to hide anymore, he sprinted at me, faster than I would have thought a man like him could.

He caught up to me, shouldering me against a 2025 Ram 1500 Rebel with the Twin Turbo Hurricane Engine (420 horsepower and 469 lb-ft of torque). He grabbed my arm, strength equally as surprising. I could see tears in his eyes as he tightened his grip, he almost looked afraid, ""Please, I can't lose you, don't you know what I've done to be with you, you can't take that back.""

I have never felt more afraid than in that moment, I did everything I could to get away from him. I flailed my entire body, scratching him in the face, kicking him wherever I could, and yelling as loud as humanly possible, ""HELP ME, PLEASE SOMEONE, IF YOU-""

He pushed me to the ground, I didn't stop yelling. He started again, his now bleeding face covered in an expression of intense anger, “WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME, YOU LOVE ME, my family they didn-“

I returned the favour, kicking his knee as hard as I physically could. He buckled under the blow, and fell to the ground whimpering.

I ran, just ran as long as I could, eventually I reached a convenience store where I was able to call the police. They arrived within a few minutes. They tell me Harry was still there, on the ground, whimpering.

Anyway, sorry for going into so much detail but this whole experience has really put me off of selling cars. I'm wondering, should I maybe find a new job, or ask for a raise, I think I'm willing to risk losing the job at this point. Let me know what you guys think about my situation, or if you've had any similar experiences asking your boss for a raise.",8,1768505290.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Not in a spotless museum way, more like, I need to know where my stuff is. I’ve got a small entryway table where my keys go, meds in one kitchen cabinet, socks in the top right drawer, that kind of boring system. A couple weeks ago I mentioned to my friend group that I’d been overwhelmed lately and my place was a mess. Two of my friends (late 20s/early 30s) offered to come over and help me do a reset. I said yes, and I genuinely appreciated it.

They show up with coffee, music, the whole ""we got you"" vibe. At first it was great. We bagged trash, broke down a pile of boxes I’d been avoiding, and I even felt lighter. Then it got weird. I stepped into the bathroom for like 3 minutes and came back to them swapping things around. They moved my pantry stuff into different cabinets ""so it makes more sense"", put my daily meds into a cute basket on an open shelf (where anyone can see it), and relocated my keys to a hook by the door I do not use because it swings and hits the wall. They also decided my nightstand was ""cluttery"" and put half of it in a random drawer in my desk. I asked where my charger went and got, ""Relax, it’s in a better spot now.""

I tried to laugh it off in the moment because I didn’t want to be ungrateful. After they left, I spent an hour hunting for stuff and putting it back. I texted them the next day like, hey thanks again, but please don’t rearrange my place like that, it stressed me out. One friend replied ""we were trying to help, sorry you’re so controlling."" The other said I ""made it awkward"" and that they won’t help me again if I’m going to nitpick. That’s not what I want. I just want help to be, you know, what I asked for.

Now I’ve told them a hard rule: if you’re at my place, don’t move or organize anything unless I specifically ask you to. If you want to suggest something, cool, tell me, but don’t just do it. They’re acting like I slapped their hand away and one of them said I’m ""punishing kindness"" and being a jerk about it.

AITJ for setting that boundary even though they meant well?

TL;DR: Friends came over to help me clean, but they rearranged my things without asking. I asked them not to do that again and set a rule that no organizing happens unless I request it. They say I’m a jerk.

[WP] As you buy the sword from the old man in the antique shop he tells you it glows blue in the presence of Orks. You laugh since they don't exist. On the way home, it starts glowing blue.

https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/s/Rg99sUJLB8

——

“Hey Jeff. It’s glowing.”

I looked down as Sandra spoke. I had told her about the orc thing after she met me in town. It was indeed glowing.

And not subtly. It was strapped to my back in the scabbard that the old man had sold me. It didn’t quite fit all the way in, which I had originally thought was a bit of a con, but the small sliver of blade that stuck out was lighting up the space between the streetlights.

I looked up at the house we were outside. It looked like all the others on the street. “Maybe the people who live here are orcs.”

She looked dubious. “Maybe they aren’t. It’s not like you can just ask them.”

“Why not? This day is already weird.”

The rotund lady who answered the door had a sour expression on her face. “Who are you and what do you want?”

She looked like she wanted to say “Go away and leave me alone” in colourful metaphors, but was summoning a monstrous effort to be polite.

I realised that my shortsighted plan to say “Are you an orc?” probably wasn’t going to cut it, so instead the eloquent and sophisticated “Erm, uh, ah.” escaped my lips. Deers in headlights probably looked less uncomfortable.

The lengthening silence while she stared at me kicked my brain into gear, and I struggled to think of a way to not call this rather unfortunate looking woman something offensive.

“I was told there was someone here who could help me find an orc.”

She looked dubiously at me. Then she looked at the face of Sandra behind me, lit partially by the glow of the sword.

“You’re one of his customers, aren’t you?” she sighed. “Why does that old man not explain things to these younguns?”

She turned around and went back inside, leaving the door open.

We stood, looking at each other.

“Well? Come in, then. You wanted an orc. You found an orc. I’m retired though, so if you want me to come on some adventure with you, you’d better have some sort of de-aging magic on you.”

Against my better judgment, I shuffled into the hall. “I didn’t know that was a thing.”

“It’s not. That’s what we commonly call a ‘joke’. You might want to try one of them. I’ve heard they can be excellent ice-breakers.”

Sandra stood outside, hissing at me, “Jeff! What are you doing? This is crazy. Come on out. I’m not going in there.”

“None taken!” came the voice of the lady from a small room off the hall. “Do either of you want coffee? I might have some tea too. Don’t drink it myself, but I understand you humans do.”

I looked back at Sandra. Her jaw was tight, and her voice strained. “I can’t do this.”

“I have biscuits!”

“She has biscuits.”

The fear in her eyes was replaced by disbelief. “Why are you doing this to me?”

“To you? What are you talking about? You don’t have to come in.”

“You don’t get it, do you?”

“Obviously not. I’m..”

The lady was standing next to me, a plate of custard creams in her hand, one of them disappearing into her mouth.

She pushed the plate towards us. The muffled noise she made sounded like “Want one?”

It’s hard to be scared of someone stuffing biscuits into their mouth, and Sandra relaxed somewhat, but she shook her head.

“Suit yourself. More for me.”

She ambled down to the larger room at the end of the hall, and sat down in a recliner facing an old TV. It was playing an old rerun of some sitcom. I didn’t recognise which one, but the canned laughter was familiar.

Sandra was mouthing obscenities at me, but followed me through to the room.

I looked at the sofa off to the side. It looked unused. There was a magazine on the seat, with a dragon on the cover, and what looked like some kind of druid holding a green jewel up to the light. Dagons dragons, apparently. I moved it to the table next to the sofa and sat down.

Sandra perched on the edge of the seat next to me, ready to bolt.

“You are a jumpy one, aren’t you. Mage? Or pixie? Ears look fake.”

Sandra touched her ears with uncertain hands. She appeared glad they were unchanged.

“Are you an orc?” I blurted out.

“Said so, didn’t I? You knew anyway, what with that huge glowing sword on your back. No sense hiding from what’s obvious. What about you though? No offence, but you look too scrawny to be a warrior.”

She paused. “Ok, maybe a little offence. That old man keeps giving out magical weapons and items like they are going out of fashion. Had some poor lad the other week get stuck in a bag of holding. Took three of us and a couple of ladders to get him out.”

“So what are we supposed to do?”

“Supposed to do? Anything you like. It’s a free country. Well, an expensive country, but you know what I meant.”

“But, the sword. The glowing. You’re an orc. The old man keeps giving magical things out.”

“Yes?”

“I want to do something.”

She sighed. “You want a quest?”

“Yes?”

“Can you gather a hundred sticks from the woods?”

“I suppose so. Why do you want sticks?”

“I don’t, but I don’t think you’re going to be any use to me either, and this will keep you busy for a bit.”

“Oh.”

The disappointment must have shown on my face.

“You want a better quest?”

I nodded. “I want to know what’s going on as well. I didn’t understand.”

She had pulled a book out from somewhere. A large, handmade book, with weird shapes on the cover. A metal snake bit its own tail on the spine. She opened it up and leafed through, the quill pen in her hand waving to and fro as she did.

“How about… rescue a fair maiden from a dragon?”

Sandra’s hurried “Wait” battled with my “Sure.”

“Done and done.” said the woman, her face changing in a horrifying moment, teeth protruding from her lower jaw. She expanded and stretched, growing muscles where she had been fat before.

I knew fear then. Her eyes glowed, and I was unable to look away.

My eyes widened as Sandra screamed, and I could see her in the corner of my eye arching her back in agony.

I felt my sternum crack and tear inside. My insides were churning and ripping and the pain was immense. My arms and legs burned.

Sandra was clutching her head and waving it side to side. Something translucent and slimy burst out from her spine.

Everything hurt.

With barely a thought, my hand reached over my back and drew the sword with one swift motion. It was blazing now. It hurt my eyes, and I could barely see the woman in the gloom of the forest.

Wait.

The forest?

My jaw ached and stretched. I could feel.. a beard growing?

Sandra was gingerly touching her ears as they grew points and gossamer wings unfurled behind her.

The woman was holding the tome in one green orcish hand. The other held a staff. She wore purple full length robes trimmed with fur.

Her voice sounded different around the fangs.

“Gyhan. Orc mage. At your service. But we’ll still need sticks if we’re going to have a fire tonight. Can’t burn earth. The gnolls get uppity if you do that.”

She looked at me. “A hundred will do.”",1,1768505075.0,WriteEveryDay,0,1.0,False
1qdt2xy,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1qdt2xy/my_job_gave_me_a_small_raise_to_work_the_night/,"My job gave me a small raise to work the night shift, I just found out why","Hi Reddit!

I’ve never made a post like this before, but I’ve been having a couple of problems at my job. For some background I’ve been working the night shift at this “24/7” (well, its actually more like 22/5) car dealership. I know that's kind of weird, but we’ve had a lot of management changes recently. There have been 6 site managers in the last 3 years, each of them has their own ‘quirks’ that they like to bring with them.

Just to illustrate what I mean: 2 bosses ago they put these little cartoon mascots all over the display room, 3 bosses ago they replaced all the phones with walkie-talkies, 5 bosses ago they started only stocking white tires (“it's cleaner”), and 6 bosses ago, that's when they started the night shift.

Initially I wasn’t too interested, but they told us that the night shift came with a five dollar pay increase, me and my friend jumped right on that! It was great at the start, but eventually my friend finished his degree and moved out of the country. At some point I guess they lost track of the fact that you need 2 people on the night shift and just never replaced him, even though I kept asking.

So that's one problem, and it was 2 bosses ago. Since then I’ve been too afraid to make waves, I stopped going to employee meetings, I stopped asking questions, I kind of need the money.

Anyway, that's not really my question, but to ask it, first I must give you yet more backstory. So without my friend I’m kind of alone at the dealership, which honestly has been fine. I get maybe 1 to 2 customers a week, it's usually someone who for whatever reason needs a car somewhat urgently, these interactions don't last more than 50 minutes at the longest. I’ve had a couple of ‘sketchier’ people come by, sweaty, jittery, trying to pay with cash, but honestly they don't care about you, they're just focused on what they want.

But. Something changed about 2 months ago. A man walked into the showroom. He looked completely average, a white man, mid 50s with neatly combed greying hair, and a matching greying moustache. He was dressed in a neat dress shirt and a blue cardigan. His voice was warm and polite, “Do you mind if I browse the lot?” I said, “feel free, do you need any help?” “I think I’ll be alright, thank you.”

He walked the lot for around 20 minutes before leaving. Not that strange, people do it all the time at a car lot, normally people don't ask to look around, but I think the darkness makes them feel like they should. Every day for the next week, he came back to the lot. He looked at cars, kicking their tires, knocking on the windows, feeling for scratches. He didn’t come into the showroom often, just picked up some brochures on his way out.

Eventually, maybe after a week and a half, I decided to leave the showroom and talk to him, maybe coax him into a sale. The lot at night has always made me a bit nervous, especially with some of the customers we get, but I try to push through it.

I walked into the lot, in the light of the lot’s overhead flood-lamps I saw him crouching beside the tires of a 2024 Toyota Camry SE in Predawn Gray (with a black SofTex interior). “Hello sir, can I help you with anything, I’ve noticed you here a few times, is there anything I can clear up?”

The man jumped a bit, he was seemingly surprised that someone would be there. For some reason his reaction made me feel calmer, he seemed utterly normal. “Oh, no I’m just browsing,” he replied, “If I need to leave, that's fine, I just like looking at the cars.”

At this point, I wasn’t really surprised by the response, “Oh that's perfectly fine, please let me know if there's anything you need, the showroom is always open.” I smiled an ironic smile, most of the customers get that the job isn’t great. “Well, if it gets boring in there, you feel free to come out and see me,” he seemed to realize what I meant, returning with a pitying smile.

After that night I continued to see him in the lot, it wasn’t until a few days later when I decided to take him up on the offer. For the next few weeks we walked the lot together for the 45 or so minutes that he tended to stay. He told me about his job (manager of a cardboard distribution hub) his family life (a wife, two kids, and a pet dog), his antique engraved rice collection, all pretty normal stuff.

I always got the impression that he was a little unsatisfied, wanted a better job, kids that listened to him, more rice probably. After those couple weeks he started to joke that I was his ‘second family.’ I know that's weird but, it's just hard to explain how that environment makes you feel. You’re so entirely alone that any human connection in those 8 hours is more meaningful than anything else the rest of the day.

Things were great, for about a month, he started bringing me lunches, just a sandwich, or a bag of chips, or he’d show me funny pictures on his phone, just stuff, friend stuff.

Then one day another customer came in mid way through his visit, a tall skinny man with an oversized hoodie, sweaty, greasy blonde hair and a stressed expression, “Hey, I need a car.” My new friend looked uncomfortable, “is this going to be a problem?” I told him it was fine, he looked at the greasy man, before leaving the dealership in a hurry.

The blonde man looked annoyed, “Hey, I need a car!” He just pointed at a car out the window and bought it on the spot, luckily not with cash. If you think thats weird take it up with my managers. When the transaction ended I looked out the window expecting to see my friend walking around the lot, but he was gone.

I heard a loud crack on the window and almost fell from my chair. It was the blonde man waving his keys at me, pounding on the window, “This white tire shit man, this is tight, clean as hell!” I like interactions like that, they're kind of nice.

The next day my friend came back, he didn't come into the showroom, just walking around the lot, kicking tires, on retrospect, harder than normal. I decided to see what he was up to and went out to see him, and noticed a quiet, tense expression on his face. I asked him if anything was wrong, “Hi, -friend-, how are you?”

He didn't say anything, just stood there facing the car, but in the low light I could see his eyes were looking at me in the reflection of the window. “Uhhh… hello, are you okay?”

He stood there for another second, his thick eyebrows furrowing in the window, then suddenly turned around, a bright smile on his face, “Oh, don’t worry about me, I’m doing perfectly fine!” “Sorry, I just had a long day, you know how it is, I’m sure.”

The rest of the night was fine, we talked a little bit about the cars, nothing deeper than that. He stayed shorter than usual that night, maybe 15 minutes. Thinking back, I think he was wearing the same clothes as the day before.

The next two days were my days off, nothing happened.

There’s about an hour when the dealership is completely closed, and the lot is left completely unattended during the transition between shifts. I came in a bit earlier than usual during that time to drop off my stuff and walk to a nearby coffee shop (that I heard about reddit actually). I parked my car at the back of the dealership, and started walking around to the front.

Just as I was about to turn the corner I noticed a man standing in front of the doors exactly how- sorry I can’t call him my friend anymore, let's just call him “Harry.” Harry was standing in front of the store just as he had the previous night, just staring.

Something about it just freaked me out. Maybe it was the fact that it wasn’t quite dark yet, and I was seeing him in nearly normal lighting, but it's just not right to see someone like that. I didn’t want him to know I saw him like that, so instead of going to the coffee shop I returned to the back of the store and went into the dealership through the back door.

The sense of danger hadn’t fully set in, I started thinking about how nice he had been, maybe he just needed someone to talk to. I slowly walked into the room, making sure to obviously turn on lights as I did. By the time I reached the show room he was no longer standing in front of the door, instead, he was examining the hood of a car just outside of the dealership. I walked up to the front doors and unlocked them.

He whipped around to look at the door, before just as suddenly returning to the hood of the car. He stayed there for a few minutes as I set up the computer system and clocked in. I think he was trying to avoid looking too eager.

After a few minutes he came into the showroom carrying a paper bag and a cup of coffee, “Hi again, sorry about how I was acting last time, I hope I didn’t freak you out or anything.” He looked the same as ever, maybe nicer than he normally did with a fresh hair cut, cleanly shaved, and a strong smell of cologne.

“Oh, no worries Harry, I completely understand.”

He smiled, a broad smile, eyes wide, “I knew you would understand, you always understand.” “Look, I have something to ask you, but first, here I brought you lunch!”

I tried to smile, but clearly it didn’t look right. He continued, “Why don’t you eat that as I tell you about my week, and don’t worry, the food is fresh, I just bought it.” I instinctively reached out and grabbed the food as he held it out to me before opening it.

“Yeah I got the food from that new coffee shop, I know you wanted to try it.”

I really hate this part, I don’t know how he knew it was me. I couldn’t have told him that, I only found out about it on my day off, all I did was reply to a comment online about it. In the moment it didn't register, “Wow thank you so much! Yeah I was actually just about to head over there!”

He looked excited as a I went to take a sip, almost too excited. As I went to set the cup down he looked disappointed, “Oh, is it too hot? Well let's just talk for a minute, you can eat the sandwich.”

He continued, “I’ve been having some problems with my family lately, they just don’t get it, they aren’t what I need, they aren’t perfect, not like you…”

I stopped rummaging in the paper bag, “I… what?”

He ignored what I said, “You’re what I need, and I’m what you need, we’re the real family!” He was sweating now, the beads running down from his hair, his voice got louder, “They had to go, you understand right, they would have stopped us!”

I fully pulled back at this point but I couldn’t move, I felt totally trapped in the building. At that moment a woman had begun walking up to door, Harry saw where I was looking and practically sprinted over to the door to lock it, “Sorry ma’am, we’re closed right now!”

I didn't see what happened to her, but I guess she left. As he ran over to the door, I ran through the building to the back door. I could hear him stomping after me, “WHAT’S WRONG, WHAT DID I DO - IS IT THAT MAN - DID HE -.”

I ran out the door, the outside now dark with the exception of the street lights. Rather than trying to climb the fence behind the dealership I sprinted into the lot, hiding behind a standee of Chip the living tire.

I heard the door slam open, and heavy breathing as he ran into the lot. He wasn’t yelling anymore, clearly realizing that it would draw attention. I saw his feet as he walked by, he wasn't trying to hide his presence, as he walked through the rows of cars I could hear him whispering, ""Im sorry if I scared you, I was just worried, you shouldn’t talk to him, that, that sweaty disgusting man, he made me realize what I had to do. For us!…""

He walked further away, and I couldn't hear him anymore just his heavy footsteps as he walked through the lot. Once I thought he was far enough I went to pull out my phone, before realizing it was still in the building. I did however have my management assigned walkie talkie which was completely useless in this situation.

I decided my best shot was to run. I ran for it, towards the road, as fast as I could. He didn't bother trying to hide anymore, he sprinted at me, faster than I would have thought a man like him could.

He caught up to me, shouldering me against a 2025 Ram 1500 Rebel with the Twin Turbo Hurricane Engine (420 horsepower and 469 lb-ft of torque). He grabbed my arm, strength equally as surprising. I could see tears in his eyes as he tightened his grip, he almost looked afraid, ""Please, I can't lose you, don't you know what I've done to be with you, you can't take that back.""

I have never felt more afraid than in that moment, I did everything I could to get away from him. I flailed my entire body, scratching him in the face, kicking him wherever I could, and yelling as loud as humanly possible, ""HELP ME, PLEASE SOMEONE, IF YOU-""

He pushed me to the ground, I didn't stop yelling. He started again, his now bleeding face covered in an expression of intense anger, “WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME, YOU LOVE ME, my family they didn-“

I returned the favour, kicking his knee as hard as I physically could. He buckled under the blow, and fell to the ground whimpering.

I ran, just ran as long as I could, eventually I reached a convenience store where I was able to call the police. They arrived within a few minutes. They tell me Harry was still there, on the ground, whimpering.

Anyway, sorry for going into so much detail but this whole experience has really put me off of selling cars. I'm wondering, should I maybe find a new job, or ask for a raise, I think I'm willing to risk losing the job at this point. Let me know what you guys think about my situation, or if you've had any similar experiences asking your boss for a raise.

I saw some people were asking about a TL:DR so:  
  
I just really dont know if I want to sell cars anymore, I thought it was fun but its actually kind of lame because the pay isnt that good and the customers act weird sometimes but on the other hand its actually kind of fun because the customers are usually pretty chill and the pay is not so bad, its really just kind of a hard decision because the market is really tough right now and I just financed a juicer and its like $45 dollars a month so I'm like do I get a new job or just like ask for a raise, or maybe even just keep working, Im not sure so if you guys have any ideas, or if you want to let me know if you've had any similar experiences I feel like its probably pretty common except the part where the guy tried to attack me and stuff but overall Ive actually had a good time working there and there are some good perks like Ive been using Duolingo while on my shift since I get like 3 customers a week, another thing that I didnt really mention in the main post, my chair has been kind of squeaky lately and I just dont know if its worth the hassle to like oil it or whatever you do there, Im just trying to think of like positives and negatives you know.",1,1768505045.0,stories,3,0.6,False

IGNORE BELOW 

Dubai’s commercial property market continues to offer strategically located opportunities for discerning investors and business owners looking to secure prime retail and mixed-use spaces. Whether you are planning a luxury jewelry art gallery with an adjoining premium coffee experience or a curated boutique that blends cultural sophistication with daily hospitality, selecting the right location and floor-plate size (1,500–2,000 sqft) will be critical to connecting with both Arabic and European audiences and maximizing visibility and footfall.

Preferred Areas & Market Positioning

1. Al Quoz & Alserkal Avenue – Creative Heart of Dubai

Alserkal Avenue in Al Quoz has established itself as one of the region’s foremost cultural and creative hubs, renowned for its contemporary galleries, design studios, and experiential spaces. The district attracts both local art enthusiasts and international visitors, making it highly suitable for an art gallery with a sophisticated retail experience. Its mix of visual arts venues and café culture aligns well with a concept that blends artisanal jewelry with curated hospitality offerings. �

Occupi +1

Commercial properties for sale in Al Quoz and Alserkal can vary widely in size and price, with opportunities including converted industrial spaces and adaptive-use units. These spaces often feature high ceilings and unique architectural character — ideal for gallery installations and experiential retail. While dedicated commercial units for sale can be limited, the area remains highly sought after for creative retail and mixed-use projects.

2. Jumeirah Road – Boutique & Lifestyle Appeal

Jumeirah Road is synonymous with boutique luxury, lined with fashion houses, gallery-style retail, and upscale eateries. Properties here are highly desirable for brands seeking a strong street presence and direct access to affluent residents and tourists alike.

While listings for standalone retail units in your size range may be competitive, the demand for premium retail spaces continues to be strong. Investment in Jumeirah Road can position your gallery and coffee space within walking distance of lifestyle anchors and cultural corridors, offering strong brand positioning and visibility.

3. Al Wasl – High Visibility & Boutique Retail

Al Wasl Road (also known locally as Al Wasl Street) has become a popular destination for boutiques, premium retailers, and specialty cafés. Retailers in this area benefit from high-end residential catchments and easy access to neighboring commercial and leisure hubs. Boutique retail units here typically range from small units to medium-sized spaces that fit well within your desired 1,500–2,000 sqft range. �

Anika Property

Investment & Buyer Strategy

When searching for for-sale commercial properties in these areas, it’s important to recognize that inventory levels and pricing vary. Sites like Bayut and Property Finder list many commercial buildings, shops, and mixed-use spaces across Dubai — but exact matches within your size range and target locations are not always readily available online. �

Property Finder +1

In Al Quoz, for example, traditional commercial listings are limited — but opportunities often arise through off-market transactions, joint-venture developments, or creative conversions of existing industrial units. � For Jumeirah Road and Al Wasl, boutique retail spaces may appear in retail-led developments or street-facing shops, sometimes through niche property brokers.

Bayut

Why These Locations Work for Your Concept

Alserkal Avenue offers a cultural destination vibe that draws both local collectors and international art lovers — ideal for an art gallery context. �

Occupi

Jumeirah Road combines luxury branding with everyday visibility, perfect for showcasing high-end jewelry alongside a refined coffee lounge.

Al Wasl brings high pedestrian flow from upscale neighborhoods and boutique shopping-oriented audiences. �

1qdsyk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1qdsyk0/in_your_opinion_how_do_you_differentiate_a_crush/,In your opinion: How do you differentiate a CRUSH from LIMERENCE? (+ My Story I guess),"I have a hard time differentiating a crush on someone from being limerent for them and I would like to ask you guys when you know a simple interest in someone is turning into something stronger, beyond the path of no return.

I am a M25 and got really obsessed with an W35 (at least 35) from my workplace since November/25. I had a time time accepting this obsession, since my life is really good and I have an easy time finding dates - which are usually no strings attached.

But this woman made me obssessed and I knew nothing would ever happen: our company is very strict, she's super Catholic (all her church friends are married with kids and she's the single aunt) and also our lifestyle/vibes are 100% different.

However some ""coincidences"" happened at work and she started to give me mixed signals: she flirted with me in the kitchen, dropped her phone when I appeared in her desk to ask help with something. And in the December Corpo-Party she was drinking a lot (she doesn't know how to properly drink, got hammered with a few beers) and was hugging everyone, until then she froze when I got next to her friends (visibly froze and looked away when she saw me - as if I didn't even exist, didn't even say 'hello').

This obsession started to ruin my mood and I felt bad when she didn't come to work, I felt bad going back home from work, I got nervous around her, was scared to say good morning.

We had a few exchanges and I was reading into her signals way too hard. I told my friends about her behavior around me and they all said *""There's a chance she's interested but considering her background and the company y'all work for, she's being extra cautions or trying to control her feelings""*. And I agree with them, some signs were there but since I couldn't risk my internship and specially not her job/rep, so I was at a limbo, obssessed with her, looking up her personal life and details etc... But too rational to risk doing something.

By Christmas 2025 I decided to stop giving in to this shit and cut this feeling from my head - I decided to kill the Limerence. I stopped trying to force coincidences (going to the kitchen the same time as her, passing through her desk, even stopped looking at her - even though our desks are pointed at each other). COLD TURKEY.

Then right after I started to avoid her, she started to interact with me even more than before. And I stopped caring about her like before, stopped being obssessed, naturally stopped looking up her socials etc.

So this week I FINALLY came back to my normal self, taking things well, in a good mood, joking around and being myself. And to completely test myself I started to say *""Good Morning \[her name\], how you doing?""* in a very casual way (which I was terrified of doing before) and she initially replied normally. Then as each day passed, she had a huge smile on her face everytime I approached her desk in the morning and started to smile harder everytime (and God her smile is fucking gorgeous). She now expects me to greet her every morning and acts really sweet.

Now she does everytime, I catch her looking at me during work, everytime I pass through her desk she looks at me when I do. Things she didn't do AT ALL before, she's now doing a lot.

Today I went to the kitchen and bam she was there. I started chatting with her and goddamn what a woman. We started talking about our previous jobs, about coffee, about stupid things. I talked to her, she laughed hard at my jokes (which were really unfunny btw), she had the initiative to talk, looked at me with a huge grin and was such a good vibe. I wasn't nervous at all, UNLIKE before Christmas/25 which my legs trembled next to her. Our longest and best conversation so far, such chemistry.

I stopped seing her as an LO and I just see her as the woman from work whom I have a crush on and we flirt sometimes - I don' t feel bad about not being with her in the weekend, I don't feel bad when she doesn't come to work. I'm not thinking about how next week will go. I still want her a lot but I'm not feeling bad about it, the feeling I have is not bothering me nor ruining my mood as before. The feeling is good. It's like a normal crush on a good-looking and sweet woman.

  
This made me wonder the difference between each feeling. How do you guys tell each apart? (and feel free to judge me or talk about my situation if you want lol - I used it as an example to explain how I perceive each feeling)",2,1768504784.0,limerence,1,1.0,False

1qdsxqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1qdsxqc/i_feel_like_im_going_crazy/,I feel like I’m going crazy,"Apologies for the word dump, I just have so much to say. Also throwaway account because you never know.

For context: I (24M) started talking to an old coworker (F21) again and this is the most comforting crush I’ve ever had. I could absolutely be wrong but I feel it’s reciprocated, and i haven’t felt like this so strongly before. The last time we hung out in person it was genuinely just supposed to be just coffee with a friend for me.

But the coffee ended up turning into a six hour hang out across some stores and sitting in the car chatting. It was genuinely the most fun I’d had in so long, and the whole time where I thought I’d be so nervous, she was just so warm and easy to talk to. She’s also the sweetest girl ever, I start blushing because she just says the nicest things about me to my face. And best of all I truly believe she’s listening to me completely when I talk, which means so much to me. I was absolutely devastated having to go home, I didn’t think it would affect me as much as it did though.

Before we said good night though we talked about me visiting her at her new place. And I genuinely wanted nothing more than to have the chance to talk again. The problem being that we are a state away due to our jobs. However, we have talked since then and because I have business close to where she’s at, I’m gonna visit her pretty soon. Now we’ve chatted a bit on the phone and over text, planning a FaceTime and figuring out logistics for my trip.

I know it sounds crazy and there’s so much going against me, but I feel I have to see this through. My therapist and I talked about doing things even if they are scary, and to start letting myself live with fewer regrets. And I deeply believe I would regret not seeing her if I can.

Now here’s where I think I’m crazy. I feel like she’s feels the same way?? She keeps saying how excited she is to see me, and I feel like our conversations have been flirty recently. There’s other stuff as well but that’d make this wayyy too long. I’ve talked to my friends about this, and they keep saying that they agree she’s into me as well. But there’s NO WAY! She is simply incredible and I just am going crazy because I swear this has to be flirting and showing interest. I’m just so dumbfounded but also taking it well I feel. I’m honestly not setting expectations for the trip, but I’m just so excited to see her regardless. I’m being appreciative of her time and I’m also just happy im doing something like this even though it scares the hell out of me.

But yeah just wanted to say to the void that I’m excited regardless of what happens, and I’ll enjoy the moments I’m getting now. It’s worth being vulnerable for this.",1,1768504734.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False
1qdsxnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/cafe/comments/1qdsxnf/researching_barista_wrist_how_are_you_dealing/,"Researching ""Barista Wrist"" – How are you dealing with RSI/Shoulder pain at high-volume shops?","Hey everyone, I’m an Industrial Design grad student (and coffee nerd) researching the long-term physical impact of manual tamping.

I’ve been reading papers on ""cumulative loading"" and how tamping often hits 4000+ Newtons of force, which is over the safe limit for repetitive work. I’m curious to hear from the pros:

1. **The Pain:** Have you actually dealt with ""Barista Wrist,"" tennis elbow, or shoulder issues? How long into the job did it start?
2. **The ""Fix"":** Does your shop use PuqPresses or auto-tampers? If not, do you have a specific ""posture"" or technique you use to stay safe during a rush?
3. **The Gear:** If you could change one thing about the physical handle or shape of your tamper to make it less ""painful,"" what would it be?

Looking for some ""ground truth"" for my project. Thanks for any insights!",1,1768504729.0,cafe,2,1.0,False

I’ve been reading papers on ""cumulative loading"" and how tamping often hits 4000+ Newtons of force, which is over the safe limit for repetitive work. I’m curious to hear from the pros:

1. **The Pain:** Have you actually dealt with ""Barista Wrist,"" tennis elbow, or shoulder issues? How long into the job did it start?
2. **The ""Fix"":** Does your shop use PuqPresses or auto-tampers? If not, do you have a specific ""posture"" or technique you use to stay safe during a rush?
3. **The Gear:** If you could change one thing about the physical handle or shape of your tamper to make it less ""painful,"" what would it be?

Looking for some ""ground truth"" for my project. Thanks for any insights!",1,1768504644.0,starbucksbaristas,5,0.67,False
1qdsw2j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qdsw2j,Streetwear Essentials Lineup — Quick Breakdown,"I’ve broken down this batch to separate the aesthetic wins from the functional annoyances. Here is the honest truth about the fits and the flaws.



Supreme Jacket



LINK: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7647428862&spider\_token=482c](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7647428862&spider_token=482c)



The Verdict: A solid daily driver. The medium weight makes it versatile for different seasons, and the print clarity is on point.



The Catch: The ""Swish"" Factor. The material is noisy when you walk. Also, the main zipper feels cheap and tends to snag on the fabric if you zip it up too fast.



Stussy Sweater



LINK: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7647472368&spider\_token=8cfc](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7647472368&spider_token=8cfc)



The Verdict: Captures that effortless Stussy vibe. It’s breathable and the print is clean.



The Catch: Paper Thin. ""Light"" is an understatement—it’s very thin. You will likely need an undershirt. Also, the neck tag stitching is messy and scratches the back of your neck.



Ralph Lauren Socks



LINK: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7637367932&spider\_token=ae91](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7637367932&spider_token=ae91)



The Verdict: Initially, the knit feels dense and has good elasticity. They look great with low-top sneakers.



The Catch: Durability Issues. They shrank significantly after one trip through the dryer. Also, pilling (fuzz balls) appeared on the heels after just two wears.



Ralph Lauren Sweater



LINK: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7637130258&spider\_token=0cc0](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7637130258&spider_token=0cc0)



The Verdict: A classic staple. The knit texture is soft, and it really does look better the more you wear it.



The Catch: Sizing Roulette. It runs small. You definitely need to size up one or even two sizes. I also had to snip a few loose threads around the pony logo.



Carhartt Shorts



LINK: OOS



The Verdict: These nail the crisp, structured workwear look. The loose fit is perfect for a relaxed silhouette.



The Catch: Cardboard Fabric. They are incredibly stiff and rough against the skin until you wash them a few times. The buttonhole was also sewn so tight I struggled to button them.



Van Cleef & Arpels Necklace



LINK: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7648565258&spider\_token=316f](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7648565258&spider_token=316f)



The Verdict: Visually, it’s a winner. The metallic finish is clean and the clover details are refined, not gaudy.



The Catch: Feels Hollow. It lacks the weight of real gold/precious metal, feeling a bit ""toy-like"" in hand. The clasp is microscopic—good luck putting it on by yourself.



Carhartt Denim Jacket



LINK: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7644421349&spider\_token=af2b](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7644421349&spider_token=af2b)



The Verdict: A tank of a jacket. The structure is firm and gives you that boxy, stable workwear silhouette immediately.



The Catch: ""Fufu"" Smell. It arrived with a strong chemical odor that needed a heavy wash to remove. The rigid denim restricts arm movement until broken in.



Chrome Hearts Hoodie



LINK: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7659095112&spider\_token=3bde](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7659095112&spider_token=3bde)



The Verdict: Heavyweight and imposing. The sharp embroidery makes it a standout piece to anchor a street outfit.



The Catch: Heavy Hood & Fragile Zip. The hood is so heavy it pulls the collar into your throat. The dagger zipper pull feels delicate and gets stuck often.



Gallery Dept T-shirt



LINK: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7641862654&spider\_token=3c34](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7641862654&spider_token=3c34)



The Verdict: The textured print and loose fit give off that cool, ""I don't care"" artist vibe.



The Catch: Uniform Distressing. The ""vintage wear"" looks too manufactured and identical, rather than natural. The paint splatter is thick rubber, creating a sweaty spot on your chest.



Stussy T-shirt



LINK: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7644555657&spider\_token=15be](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7644555657&spider_token=15be)



The Verdict: The easiest shirt to style in this haul. Throw it on and go.



The Catch: Sheer Fabric. The white blank is slightly see-through in bright sunlight. Be careful with high-heat drying, as the print feels prone to cracking.



Balenciaga T-shirt



LINK: OOS



The Verdict: The cotton is very soft, and the print placement is accurate. It has that signature designer drape.



The Catch: Tent Sizing. Even for ""oversized,"" this is massive. Size down or you'll look like you're wearing a dress. The collar ribbing is weak and gets wavy easily.



Patagonia Hat



LINK: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7647468502&spider\_token=f6bb](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7647468502&spider_token=f6bb)



The Verdict: A clean, structured shape that works for hiking or coffee runs. The embroidery is neat.



The Catch: Shipping Damage. It wasn't shipped in a box, so it arrived flat as a pancake (needs steaming). It’s also a shallow fit—not great for big heads.",2,1768504635.0,FashionRepsEurope,0,1.0,False

1qdsufp,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qdsufp/my_32f_best_friend_36m_is_suddenly_distant_and/,My (32F) best friend (36M) is suddenly distant and refuses to talk about it,"Hi everyone. My (32F) best friend (36M) has become really distant with me lately, and I don't know what's going on.

We've been friends for 10+ years, and mostly hang out online either playing games or just chatting because we live quite far apart now. We usually meet up in person once or twice a year, usually with other friends. Over the last few weeks he has been really quiet, distant, and non-responsive with me. This is unusual for him, as we usually talk daily.

For some important context, I'm a very introverted person with ADHD and generalized anxiety disorder, and over the last year I've gone through some things that have been really stressful and upsetting, including losing a family member whom I was the primary carer for during the end of their life, then my young dog passed away very suddenly and unexpectedly. I had to go low/no contact with my parents, who emotionally abused me and neglected me as a child, after they did something terrible and when I confronted them about it they blew up at me. My husband then became very ill, and for a few months was signed off work and needed a lot of support. All of this happened very close together, along with a few other stressful life events, and I never really had an opportunity to process my own grief. This was all over a period of 6 months, and I was constantly exhausted. When everything calmed down and my husband returned to work, I had an emotional breakdown and became extremely depressed. I am in therapy, and am processing trauma and grief, including some childhood trauma that the whole situation with my family brought up.

Throughout this, I remained in close contact with my friend, but I was tired and we didn't play games as much, and I wasn't able to travel (nor did he as it was too expensive). We talked every day, and I made sure that at least every other week (sometimes more frequently) I made time to hang out with him and our other friends in some way. We played games, watched movies remotely together, or just chatted in a voice call.

Over the holidays, we all hung out together and I was starting to feel a bit better. I was really optimistic for the new year. My best friend sent me a lovely message on New Year's Day saying that he hoped this year was better, and was really warm and his usual self. We made vague plans for when he comes to visit us later in the year. I responded warmly too, and everything seemed fine. But the days following he was quiet. I continued talking to him like normal, but he was unresponsive or cold, with very short responses. I asked if he was okay, and he said he was fine, just had some stuff on his mind. I told him if he needed to talk I was there, and he reiterated he was fine and to just worry about myself. I thought that was an odd way to word it, but I left it alone even though I was starting to worry that maybe he was annoyed with me over something. I had noticed several times especially just before the holidays he had made sort of jokey but slightly barbed comments about me not hanging out as much, things like, ""Well for us to do that you'd need to actually play games with us"" or ""Yeah, but it's a shame that won't happen because you prefer sitting on the couch all night."" He has made similar comments in the past when he's known I'm feeling down or struggling, and it hurts my feelings.

The weird part is he's warm and friendly with me in group chats or when we hang out with our friends, but in private it feels like he's shutting me out.

I feel like he's upset with me because I haven't spent as much time with him over the last few months, but I haven't felt able to do anything. I literally finish work, eat dinner with my husband, and then feel so exhausted that I have a quiet evening reading a book or drawing. He knows this, I've told him I'm struggling. I've still kept up messaging him, often initiating conversation, and our other friends. I've still made time every week or every other week to hang out. It also occurred to me that I don't think he's ever invited me to do anything, it's always been me doing the inviting. If this is what's bothering him, I feel like it's unreasonable for him to be upset with me, but am I wrong? It's really upsetting me because I feel like he thinks I'm a bad friend. He made a passing comment a few days ago in our group chat about how he realized he needs to reassess what's important to him. 

While I've been hanging out with him a little less, I thought that we were closer than ever because we had deeper conversations over the last year. Several times he's asked me things like how therapy is going and what I'm working on, and when I respond in-depth he changes the subject, so maybe he doesn't actually care about that and I've misunderstood. Maybe he just values spending time together more than having those kinds of conversations. I also feel like I'm not a bad friend, I have supported him through his own family drama, stood up for him when he fell out with a mutual friend, and when we were all out together during a friend group holiday just over a year ago, his wife had a panic attack and I took her back to the hotel and hung out with her so he could stay out with our friends. When he was in an accident and needed surgery, I took his wife out for coffee to keep her calm while she waited, and helped her with groceries and chores so she could just focus on him. I thought I was being a good friend, but at the moment it feels like I'm not meeting his expectations. The big problem is he never communicates them to me. He's told me in the past that he distances himself from people to prevent himself from being hurt when he feels like they're pulling away from him, but I haven't been doing that so I don't understand.

I will say that something I am working on in therapy is because of my childhood I notice patterns and become very anxious and fearful, and assume it's about me with no information. I often go into a sort of fawning behavior to try and smooth things over. I have been trying in this situation to act mostly normal, and if he doesn't respond, I don't chase him for an answer. But it's really difficult and is causing me a lot of stress.

Part of me feels like I should ask if I've done something to upset him, but I don't want to make this all about me when he's repeatedly made it clear he doesn't want to talk about whatever is bothering him. I also think I'm not emotionally ready to have him tell me that he's angry with me whilst I'm still trying to work through the childhood trauma. I keep bouncing between being upset and anxious, and then a bit resentful, because I realized that I am always checking in on him but when he knew I was having a hard time he never once checked in on me, he just made jokes about me not making time for him and our other friends.

After writing all this down, I feel like if I read this post I'd say that he wasn't being a very good friend, but a big part of me is telling me that it's my fault and that I should be doing more to fix this. I guess I could just use some perspective from strangers, and any advice for what to do or how to move forward.

\*\*TLDR:\*\* My (32F) best friend (36M) suddenly became cold and distant with me, and doesn't want to talk about it. I suspect it might be because I haven't been able to hang out as much lately, or am not meeting his expectations as a friend, but he never communicates with me about any of that. I need some perspective because right now I'm blaming myself and very stressed. I have baggage that isn't helping.",1,1768504535.0,relationships,7,1.0,False

**LONGMONT, CO** — The Longmont City Council kicked off the new year with a blend of tradition and forward-looking strategy during its regular session on January 13, 2026. The evening was marked by the swearing-in of a new council member, a heartfelt tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and the beginning of a robust debate over the city’s identity and operational future.

# A New Face at the Dais

The meeting began with the administration of the oath of office to Alexander Kulkoffer, the newly elected council member for Ward 3. Kulkoffer, who was elected by acclamation, was sworn in by City Clerk Dawn Quintana.

""I am humbly proud to be here and I can't wait to serve next to each and every one of you,"" Kulkoffer told his new colleagues later in the evening. His arrival prompted a reshuffling of board liaison roles, with Kulkoffer stepping into positions on the Visit Longmont board, the Sustainability Advisory Board, and the Longmont Downtown Development Authority (LDDA).

# Honoring a Legacy of Service

In observance of the upcoming national holiday, Mayor Joan Peck (Susie Hidalgo-Faring) proclaimed January 12 through 19, 2026, as ""Honoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Week"" in Longmont.

Members of the MLK planning committee accepted the proclamation and invited the public to a commemorative program at Silver Creek High School on Friday, January 16. Minister Glenda Strong Robinson, a 47-year resident of Longmont who marched with Dr. King in 1968, offered a poignant reminder to the chamber: ""Freedom isn't free, folks... somebody died for all of us... to be sitting in the spaces that we're sitting in now"".

# The Great Flag Debate

One of the most spirited discussions of the evening centered on a proposal to reconsider Longmont’s city flag. Council Member Diane Christ moved to schedule a study session to discuss both the installation of a new flagpole at the Civic Center and the potential redesign of the 52-year-old city flag.

""Maybe this is a good time to reconsider and come up with a commemorative flag... to mark our 150th \[state\] and 250th \[national\] anniversary,"" Christ suggested.



Public commenter Matthew Spencer supported the move, noting that many residents are unaware the city even has an official flag. However, the motion passed 5-1, with Council Member Mitzi Marcen in descent, signaling that while the conversation will move forward, the current design still has its defenders.

# Mapping the Year Ahead: The Retreat

The council spent a significant portion of the meeting planning their upcoming retreat, scheduled for March 27 and 28. Assistant City Manager Sandy Seader presented several options for the session, including the possibility of holding the retreat at the new Ascent property or Sandstone Ranch.

Council members reached a consensus on several key retreat objectives:

* **Team Building:** Utilizing leadership assessments to improve communication and efficiency between council members. +1
* **Operational Capacity:** A ""holistic"" review of city staff capacity and financial resources to ensure the council’s goals are attainable. +1
* **Public Engagement:** Exploring new frameworks for community outreach beyond the traditional ""Coffee with Council"". +1
* **External Facilitation:** The council voted unanimously to hire an outside facilitator to lead the retreat, ensuring staff can participate as equals in the planning process. +1

# Public Concerns: From Cameras to Golf Courses

During the ""Public Invited to be Heard"" segment, residents raised diverse concerns:

* **Privacy:** Several speakers, including 21-year-old Jacob McCollum, voiced opposition to the city’s use of ""Flock"" safety cameras, citing concerns over government surveillance and the erosion of privacy. +2
* **Golf Standards:** Resident Paul Stalls reported a ""decline in standards"" at the Ute Creek Golf Course, specifically citing the removal of ball wash stations and improper disposal of range balls. +2
* **Airport Oversight:** Public commenter Scott Stewart urged the council to address a ""lack of communication"" and inconsistent policy application at the city's airport during their retreat. +2

Got into reading about traditional arts-書道, 華道, that sort of thing. Tea ceremony (茶道) kept popping up everywhere so started reading more about it.

Learned all the vocab- 茶室 (tea room), 茶碗 (tea bowl), 亭主 (host)-but never actually tried making proper matcha myself. Figured I knew enough from reading, right? Bought some powder ages ago and just mixed it with hot water like instant coffee. Tasted rank. Thought that's just how it was.

Finally watched some videos of actual tea ceremonies and realized I'd been doing it completely backwards. Wrong temperature, wrong amount, no whisking, just stirring with a spoon like an absolute muppet. Felt proper stupid.

This is obviously out living room. We plan on putting two small accent chairs directly opposite of the couch and coffee table. That still leaves a good amount of room in front of the door and windows. We also plan on getting some curtains mainly for accent/decoration. 

We don't go in and out of the house with that door. We have another front door we use most of the time, but I don't want to do anything that blocks usage of the door. So what can we do? Besides the cat tree😂 that can be moved. My wife also wants to do some hanging plants in front of the windows which is great, but any other ideas? Anything would be great!

I'm a 38F Canadian currently living in Germany and I'm looking to exchange letters with some lovely folks (or unlovely, if that's how you identify :)). 

Years ago as part of a school project we spent an academic year writing to a penpal on the opposite side of the country. It ended up being one of the most memorable experiences of my childhood and to this day, I still think fondly on my penpal (dear Emily from Nova Scotia, I hope you're doing well and life has been kind to you in the years since). Lately I've been reminiscing and doing more personal writing and I've become aware of the real desire to once more have a long term correspondence with someone(s). 

To be honest, I'm not really sure what I'm looking for -- certainly I don't care if we have similar interests, as I find it fascinating hearing about lives completely removed from my own experience. I'm also not operating under the expectation of regularity; if it's one letter a month or one letter a season, I'm very open to an exchange. If it's email, great. What I'm after, simply, is that peculiar and wonderful connection that comes from exchanging words with strangers.

  
A bit about me to perhaps help: I'm a devoted pet mum (thanks to that girl who grew up in rural, isolated Canada and who was obsessed with James Herriot, I don't think I could ever be without housepets) and enthusiastic theatre rat. I love films and the arts, reading, and cooking. I think almost anything can be cured with nature and the things that can't certainly won't be harmed by going out for a walk in the woods. I like where I currently live but I think I'm doomed to wander in perpetuity so I'm sure another international move is on the horizon. I love the idea of coffee in milk but in practice, can only ever drink it (in wildly irresponsible quantities) black. I love kindness -- not the idealistic notion of it but a genuine, hardwon practice of leaving the world a little nicer and making someone's day even at the cost to onesself. There is nothing that will ever convince me that the best lullaby isn't the sound of rain dripping against leaves and down the eaves of a quiet, dark house. 

If anyone would like to try give it a go, I'd love to hear from you! 

Until then sending you all the very best,

Part 1: The Foundation & Mindset

**Disclaimer**

I’ve spent a lot of time contemplating whether I should share this. What you’re about to read goes deeper than just 'prep tips'; **it’s an autopsy of my entire thought process.** I’m laying out the skeletal structure of how I approached the MCAT while balancing life as a father and a professional.

There isn’t a “TLDR” because this is my personal experience and I refuse to summarize it. Also, by not having a TLDR, I am hoping to weed out the people who aren’t serious about reading/hearing what I have to say.

**This is for the people who lack resources and time.** I was a victim of this. I thought that I couldn’t improve because I wasn’t smart enough. But the real reason was, I just didn’t have enough time to figure this out.

With that being said, I truly hope this can help those of you who just don’t have enough time to think through the entire process.

**Why the Guide?**

I truly believe that to be a physician, an inherent desire to help people has to be woven into your nature somewhere.

I know it’s a total cliché. You can’t find a pre-med talk where someone doesn't mention ""wanting to help people"". **But for me, it's the reality. Working as an ICU nurse is how I showed that in my previous years.** I love helping patients and seeing them get better, and I want to carry that same energy into medicine. Here’s how I start, by helping future colleagues and friends. 😉

**Who I am**

I just took the MCAT on 1/10. My FLs were on a steady climb from 499 (FL1) to 515 (FL5) (FL6 was 513). I know. Some might say, “515? I’m aiming for 525!”

Yeah, I get it. I might not be the ""ideal"" person to give advice because this was my third attempt at this monster, and my highest FL score was 515. I took it in 2023 (488) and 2024 (497). But if I’m being really honest, I didn’t actually study for those first two. I figured I could just wing it. I graduated college without actually studying for any exams, I passed the NCLEX without really trying, and I thought I could procrastinate my way through this, too. To be fair, I think that’s how I’ve approached ""studying"" my entire life.

The answer to why I lived that way came from my psychiatrist: **I had an undiagnosed ADHD.** He told me that people who aren't diagnosed until later in life usually have a higher mental capacity to compensate; you’re smart enough to get by, pass your classes, and learn just enough to survive without ever actually learning how to study.

That works fine, until you hit a wall like the MCAT. He said some people hit that roadblock and some don't, depending on how far they try to go. **But once you hit it, you're paralyzed.** You have no idea what to do because you’ve never actually trained yourself to study. And that’s exactly how I ""studied"" for my first two attempts. But I wanted to see what I was truly capable of. And it made the world’s difference.

**Thus, I wanted to share what I did differently this time.**

Let’s dive in.

**Are You Serious About Medical School? Or…**

Before you start memorizing your amino acids, there’s a question that some don’t even bother to answer.

Question is: Are you serious about this? I mean, really?

Are you doing this because you want it? Or is it because your parents want you to? Or maybe for the ""glorified status"" that comes with the title?

Look, I’m not saying there’s anything inherently wrong with those reasons, but if your reasons are only external, you’re going to struggle. Why? Because the moment you hit a snag, you’re going to start pointing fingers.

Once your thoughts are settled, do the following:

*Step 1: Set a timeline*

**Think about how much time you can devote to this.** The general recommendation for a ""successful"" score is **300-500 hours of total study time**.

And be real. Nobody, not even a ""full-time"" student, is actually studying 8-10 hours a day. They have classes, assignments, and exams. Let alone those of us working full-time. Unless you are sitting at home, bored out of your mind with absolutely zero responsibilities, 8-10 hours a day is neither the norm nor the expectation.

*Step 2: Make it Real*

**Register for the MCAT.** Then, make it known. Create accountability by putting yourself in a corner. Tell your parents. Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend. Tell your friends, your roommate. Make it public.

**Choose your Recipe**

Think of building your study strategy like ordering coffee for the first time. You want the best-tasting drink on the menu, but you have no idea where to start. So, you look at the options and ask for a recommendation. Then come the questions: Hot or iced? What kind of milk: Whole, Oat, Slim, 2%, Non-fat, or Almond? Do you want vanilla, caramel, or hazelnut syrup? Sugar-free? Extra shot? A splash of heavy cream?

It’s overwhelming. You get confused and end up just asking for the first thing on the menu. Why? **Because there’s a reason a ""standard"" menu exists.**

Building your study strategy is no different. You are picking your own ingredients. Your study techniques to craft your ""coffee."" There are pre-made combinations (the popular study methods) and there are the unique, crazy recipes you find online.

# Part 2: What’s, How’s, and Why’s

**Why Are You Aiming 520+?**

Let’s do a quick stat check.

The 50th percentile for this exam is 500. The MCAT is designed to be a perfect bell curve, meaning **68% of all test takers fall within the 489 to 511 range**.

According to the AAMC matriculation data, a 511.9 is the average for those who actually get in. I graduated BSN with a 3.6. I still have some science courses that I didn’t take yet: O Chem II, Physics II, and Biochemistry. When you're a non-traditional student or someone with a GPA that doesn't scream ""Stellar,"" you can't afford to be average.

**I needed to push myself into the 512–521 range (2 SD).** That’s the ""safety zone"" where admissions committees stop looking at your past mistakes and start looking at your potential.

Yes, there’s value in the idea of ""shooting for the moon to land among the stars."" But keep in mind that scoring above a 521 (within 3 SD) means outperforming 97.5% of everyone taking this test. At that point, you don’t just have an ""insane"" score; you are an outlier. So, while aiming high is great, it’s not going to help if there’s a massive, unrealistic discrepancy between where you are now and where you want to be.

**The 4 Phases of MCAT Prep**

* **\[Phase 1: Priming - learn the language of science\]**
   * **<Memorization vs. Conceptual Understanding>**

The goal of this phase is learning the language of the test. This phase is about how your mind should be wired and primed. It should be to the point where everything around you starts to sound like the MCAT. **You need to reach a level of obsession where your daily life triggers your memory.**

**Most people approach the MCAT like they’re studying for a vocabulary test**. They try to brute-force memorize every single bolded word in the books. Don’t do that. That’s a trap.

* **<The infamous High Yield Content>**

People obsess over ""High Yield"" topics because they’re looking for a shortcut. They think High Yield means ""this is the only stuff that will show up."" Let me set you straight: **High Yield isn’t a shortcut; it’s your foundation.** It’s the material that is guaranteed to be there, the concepts that form the backbone of the exam. You have to realize that once you’ve mastered the High Yield, **everything else becomes High Yield.**

* **<Then, what is Low Yield?>**

I'm sorry, I'm going to say it. **""Low Yield"" is essentially the term people use for the things they are too lazy to learn**. It’s that obscure functional group, the niche metabolic pathway, or the physics equation you’re praying won't show up on test day.

Low yield is the tie-breaker. If you want to be in that upper tier, you need to know the material that the other 85% decided was ""too niche"" to study. **To you, nothing should be low yield.**

* **<Using AI as your 24/7 MCAT Tutor>**

I used AI to act as my personal, 24/7 MCAT tutor, and it saved me weeks of aimless reading. Here is what I did:

I uploaded the MilesDown Review Sheets and the AAMC Content Outline to AI. (You must provide the versions with answers/explanations included. If you just give it a list of topics, the AI might hallucinate or feed you logic that isn't aligned with the AAMC)

Whenever I hit a concept during the ""First Pass"" that didn't click, **I didn't waste time re-reading the same paragraph in the book.** I asked AI: ""Explain this to me like I'm an 8th grader,"" or ""Break this down into a simple logical flow.""

This turns passive reading into active learning.

* **<The Anki Protocol: Choosing your weapon>**

The ultimate goal of your studying is **Free Recall**, or at the very least, **Cued Recall**. It doesn't matter if it’s JackSparrow or MilesDown. **The ""best"" deck is the one you actually do every single day.** Anki is a game of consistency, not a search for the magic pill.

Here’s the breakdown of the popular decks: 

|**Deck Name**|**Style & Format**|**Best For...**|**Estimated Prep Time**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**MilesDown**|Visual, organized, Cloze deletions (fill-in-the-blank)|People who want a solid foundation quickly and like visual cues/videos|1.5 - 2 Months|
|**AnKing**|Updated MilesDown with better tags and community edits|Someone who wants the MilesDown style but with more polish and customization|1.5 - 2 Months|
|**Pankow**|The gold standard for Psych/Soc (P/S) Based on the 300pg KA doc|Anyone aiming for a 130+ in P/S|1 Month (Simultaneous)|
|**JackSparrow/CaptainHook**|Very dense, traditional Q&A style, organized by Kap chapters|People who want to see every detail and don't mind the grind|3 - 4 Months|
|**Aiden/Bouras**|Extremely comprehensive, massive card count|People with a very long timeline who want to leave absolutely no stone unturned|6+ Months|

* **<How to Approach Content Review>**

If I could go back, I would completely gut the way I handled content review. Taking endless notes and making pretty flashcards feels like work, but it’s mostly a waste of time. The only ""correct"" or least wasteful way to do content review is to **approach it with a ""First Pass"" mindset.**

Use the text as a checklist to **identify your content gaps.** When you hit a topic you don't understand, don't just stare at the page. Go to your resource that explains it best for you. If it doesn’t make sense, keep digging until it clicks.

* **\[Phase 2: Locating your “Fractures” through Practice\]**

**Most students stay in Phase 1 for too long because it’s comfortable.** But Phase 2 is where the comfort ends. This is the “X-Ray” Phase.

The goal here is to **apply stress to your knowledge base until it cracks.** You are purposely putting yourself under pressure to locate your fractures; those hidden gaps in logic, misremembered formulas, and conceptual weaknesses that a textbook won't show you.

* **<Other Resources>**
   * *Your Mindset Using Other Resources:* A hot take here: **You don’t NEED UWhirl.** Don’t listen to the people who say you can’t get a 515+ without it. It’s just a tool, and any tool is useless if you don't know how to use it.
   * *The ""Find Your Weakness"" Mindset*: Whether you’re using UWhirl, BP, or any other resource, the purpose is the same: **Identifying what you don’t know**. You are doing them to expose the gaps in your logic. When you get a question wrong, that’s your lead.
   * *Get into the Rhythm*: The biggest mistake people make is dividing the total number of questions by the days they have left. Don’t do that. **Your mental condition fluctuates daily.** If you force yourself to finish 59 questions when your brain is fried, you’re just clicking buttons. Forget the ""forced habit"" of completion.
   * *No Training Wheels*: When you’re in the thick of it, take all the time you need, but never look up the answer or a hint while the clock is running. If you can’t find the answer in the passage or your head, struggle for it. That struggle is what ""feeds"" the brain. **You must learn to figure it out from the passage alone.**
   * *The Life-Saving Grace, PoE*: On the MCAT, you don't always look for the ""right"" answer. **You eliminate the three ""wrong"" ones.** Mastering POE is how you survive when your content knowledge hits a wall. **It turns a ""I don't know"" into a 50/50 or a 100% win.** This is your safety net.
* **<The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly>**

If you’re going to spend money or time on resources outside of the AAMC, you need to know exactly what you’re getting. Don't treat them all the same.

|**Resource**|**Strategy & Verdict**|
|:-|:-|
|**UWhirl**|Best-in-class explanations. Use it to learn, not just to test. It’s the gold standard, but don't feel pressured; it’s a tool, not a 515+ requirement.|
|**BP**|Use their FLs to survive the 7-hour grind. The science logic can be convoluted, so focus on building mental endurance rather than the raw score.|
|**Kap / TPR**|Great for identifying content holes. However, their ""pseudo-discrete"" questions rely too much on memorization rather than MCAT-style reasoning.|
|**JW**|The best free resource to keep your CARS brain active daily. Build the habit here, but treat AAMC CARS as the ultimate final boss.|
|**OB / EK**|Stay away from math-heavy, outdated materials. The MCAT is a reasoning test, not a mental math competition. Don't waste your bandwidth.|

* **<The 1:2 Review Rule>**

**If you spend 1 hour doing questions, you must spend at least 2 hours reviewing them**. If your review time is shorter than your testing time, you’re being lazy. You aren't giving your brain enough time to ""hurt"" and actually learn from the mistake.

Reading the ""Correct"" explanation and nodding along is passive. It's a trap. To truly fix a Lesion, you need to understand the anatomy of the entire question:

|**Crucial Question to Ask**|**What You’re Looking For**|
|:-|:-|
|Why is the correct answer right?|Can you explain the core logic in **one simple sentence**? If you can't, you don't own the concept yet.|
|Why are the other 3 answers garbage?|Identify the trap: Was it **Out of Scope**, a **Distractor**, a **Factual Error**, or **Opposite** of what was asked?|
|Where did my logic deviate?|Pinpoint the exact moment you tripped: Was it a **misinterpretation of the data**, or did you **misread the Q-stem**?|

* **<Building Stamina>**

Once you start taking Full-Length (FL) exams from other resources, **you’re going to see a 3-digit number that might make you want to quit. Ignore it.** They are designed to be harder or scored more harshly than the actual AAMC.

The Real Goal: **The 7-Hour Grind.** The only reason you are taking these exams is to train your body and mind to sit in a chair for 7+ hours.

* **<Transitioning to AAMC: The Pivot>**

**Every company has its own ""flavor"" of logic.** If you stay in UWhirl or BP for too long, your brain starts to get warped. You need to stop before you lose the ability to see the world through the AAMC lens. At the one-month mark, you go 100% AAMC. The final stretch is about recalibrating your brain to the exact frequency of the test makers.

* **<The ""Non-Negotiables"">**

By the end of Phase 2, these shouldn't just be ""known"". **They should be reflexes.**

1. **Amino Acids**: Absolute mastery. 1-letter/3-letter codes, structures, polar/non-polar, acidic/basic, and isoelectric point (pI) calculations.
2. **Metabolic Pathways**: Glycolysis, TCA, Gluconeogenesis, Glycogenesis, PPP, and Fatty Acid Oxidation. Know the rate-limiting enzymes and the net ATP/NADH/FADH2 yield.
3. **Functional Groups**: Mastery of reactivity
4. **Enzyme Kinetics**: Michaelis-Menten, Lineweaver-Burk plots, and the 4 types of inhibition (Competitive, Non-competitive, Uncompetitive, Mixed).
5. **Genetics & Lab Tech**: Central Dogma (Transcription/Translation), +/- Sense RNA & Retroviruses, Restriction Enzymes (Palindromic sequences), PCR, and Western/Southern/Northern blots.
6. **Epigenetics**: DNA Acetylation (HDAC) vs. Methylation.
7. **Endocrinology**: Anterior/Posterior Pituitary hormones (FLAT PEG vs. Oxytocin/ADH), and the adrenal cortex/medulla hormones.
8. **Embryology**: The ""Big Three"" germ layers: Ectoderm (Nervous system/skin), Mesoderm (Means of getting around: bones/muscles/circulatory), Endoderm (Internal linings).
9. **The Neuron**: Resting potential, Action Potential steps (Ion channels flow), and Synaptic transmission.
10. **Renal System**: The Nephron flow (PCT, Loop of Henle, DCT, Collecting duct) and where Water vs. Salt moves.
11. **Immune System**: Innate vs. Adaptive, B-cells vs. T-cells, and MHC I/II.
12. **Electrochemistry**: E cell calculations, Galvanic vs. Electrolytic cells, and AN OX / RED CAT.
13. **Thermodynamics & Kinetics**: Le Chatelier’s Principle, Gibbs Free Energy, Enthalpy, and Entropy.
14. **Physics Essentials**: Optics (Lenses/Mirrors), Circuitry (V=IR, Capacitance), and Fluid Dynamics (Bernoulli’s & Continuity equation).
15. **Acid/Base**: calculations and common Strong Acids/Bases.
16. **The ""Confusion"" Pairs**: You must be able to split hairs between:
17. Role Strain vs. Role Conflict.
18. Fundamental Attribution Error vs. Actor-Observer Bias.
19. Self-Esteem vs. Self-Efficacy vs. Self-Concept.
20. **The Theories**: Freud, Erikson, Piaget, and Kohlberg’s stages. You need to know the ages and the conflicts for each.
21. **Learning/Memory**: Classical vs. Operant conditioning (Reinforcement/Punishment schedules), and Sensory vs. Short-term vs. Long-term memory.
22. **Sociological Perspectives**: Functionalism vs. Conflict Theory vs. Symbolic Interactionism.

 

* **\[Phase 3: AAMC Calibration\]**

Once you pivot to AAMC, your attitude toward each section must change. It’s not about how much you know; it’s about how you react to what’s on the screen.

* **<C/P: The ""Hidden in Plain Sight"" Section>**

Glance at the questions before the passage. You’ll see terms you know, and your brain will go, ""Okay, I know this. This is my territory."" **It stops the panic before it even starts.**

C/P is the most straightforward section if you stop overcomplicating it. Most of the time, there’s one answer choice that just ""screams"" at you because it’s the only one that logically fits the units or the scale of the problem.

**Stop trying to get a perfect score.** If you review your FLs, you’ll see that you make at least 5 or more ""dumbass mistakes"". Things you would have gotten right if you just took one more breath or thought one step further. If you can just eliminate those 5 stupid mistakes, your score jumps by 1 or 2 points. That takes you from a 126 to a 128. **Focus on the 5-question swing, not perfection.**

If you look at the clock and realize you're running out of time, **jump straight to the end. Questions 57, 58, and 59 are almost always standalone discretes.** They are quick points sitting there for the taking.

* **<CARS: The ""Speedbump"" Strategy>**

This section probably took years off my life, but I realized the secret: **Notice the transition words.**

Read through the passage smoothly. **Don't get stuck on one sentence.** What is the topic, and what is the author’s opinion?

**Hit the Brakes at Speedbumps:** When you see transition words like “But,” “However,” “Thus,” or “Yet,” STOP. Slow down. Everything the author said before the word ""But"" is usually garbage; the real message, the point they actually want to make, comes right after it. **Mastering this one tweak brought my CARS from 122 to 127.**

* **<B/B: Decoding ""BS"" through Cued Recall>**

When I reviewed my FLs, I realized it wasn't a content gap fucking me over. It was those needlessly convoluted experiments. The test makers love to overcomplicate things. Instead of saying ""We're separating A and B with chromatography,"" they'll say:

*""A heterogeneous solution containing two low–molecular–weight organic solutes was subjected to a multistep purification protocol... silica-based chromatographic column... increasing gradient of organic solvent...""*

I know it's confusing but look closer. It’s just a bunch of **individualized word-hints**. As soon as you see ""affinity,"" ""stationary phase,"" or ""silica-based,"" your brain needs to trigger **Cued Recall**. Everything you know about chromatography should flood in, because THAT IS EXACTLY what the questions will be about.

If the passage mentions ""Native PAGE and SDS-PAGE,"" that’s your cue. Your brain should immediately go: ""Okay, they're going to ask about disulfide bonds, reducing conditions, or the number of bands."" **Improvement comes from sitting down and figuring out exactly where your ""cue-recognition"" failed.**

* **<P/S: The Hybrid Boss>**

People say it’s CARS 2.0 or a vocab test. But not with 2026. **You must combine with C/P and B/B:** You have to dissect a passage (like CARS), analyze a study or experiment (like B/B), and derive information (like C/P). Only after you do all that will they give you answer choices with the vocab you memorized.

**The AAMC loves making you choose between two terms that are nearly identical.** However, P/S is becoming a combination of all four sections. If you treat it like a simple ""vocab dump,"" you’re going to get wrecked.

* **<Demystifying ""AAMC Logic"">**

It’s not a ""Special Science"": People use ""AAMC Logic"" as a fancy umbrella term to **vaguely describe how the test makers want you to think.** You aren't fixing your knowledge; you’re tweaking your way of thinking.

**Every Section is a Reading Test:** Whether it’s B/B or C/P, your success depends on your ability to read critically. You need to master the art of extracting exactly what the question asks without adding your own ""fluff"" or outside assumptions.

Afterall, that's what medicine is all about, right? **Figuring out the unknown with limited information.**

* **<The AAMC Weaponry: What to Buy and How to Use It>**

Once you pivot to the AAMC, you need to be surgical. Most people just start clicking questions. That is a waste of prime resources. You need to treat each tool as a specific training module. Buy the ""AAMC Official Prep Online-Only Bundle"" because you need every single bit of it.

*Step 1: The QPacks (The Gap Finder)*

* When: Early Phase 2/Beginning of Phase 3.
* Goal: Identifying Category 1 (Content Gap) errors.
* Method: Don't obsess over the score here. If you miss a question in the Bio QPack, it means you don't know the content. Go back to your Anki or AI, fix the ""fracture,"" and move on. **These are your ""low-stakes"" drills.**

*Step 2: CARS Diagnostic & QPacks (The Daily Bread)*

* When: Daily, from start to finish.
* Method: **Do 2–3 passages a day**. No more, no less. Consistency is better than binging.
* Warning: The first half of CARS QPack 1 is notoriously brutal (looking at you, Picasso). Don't let it destroy your confidence; use it to see how extreme the AAMC's reasoning can get.

*Step 3: The Section Bank (The Logic Recalibration)*

* When: The 1-month mark (Phase 3).
* Goal: To download the AAMC's ""brain"" into yours.
* Method: This is the most important part of your prep. **Do not rush these.** Solve 10–20 questions a day and spend double that time reviewing them.
* The Focus: Don't just look at the right answer. Dissect the Reasoning. You need to understand the ""AAMC flavor"" of BS. When you start predicting their ""traps"" in the SB, you are ready for the 515+.

*Step 4: The Full-Lengths (The Simulation)*

* When: Once a week for the final 6 weeks.
* Take them under strict, **100% testing conditions.** No phone, no snacks outside of breaks, no pausing.
* **Spend the next two days performing a full Autopsy** using the 6-Category Error Coding system (discussed later). Find at least 5 ""dumbass mistakes"" to fix for the next round.

**\[Phase 4: Operational Mastery\]**

At this stage, you are no longer just a student; **you are a Game Manager.** This is where you stop guessing and start calculating your success. **You need to identify the exact ""mechanical failure"" for every missed point.** Use the 6-Category Error Coding System to audit your performance.

* **<The Error Coding System>**
   1. **⁠Content Gap**: Pure lack of knowledge.
   2. **Misread/Attention Error**: The ""Dumbass"" mistakes (e.g., missing the word ""NOT"").
   3. **⁠Reasoning Error**: Your logic diverged from the AAMC path.
   4. **Recall Failure**: You knew it but couldn't retrieve it in time.
   5. ⁠**Time Pressure**: The clock forced a bad decision.
   6. ⁠**Forced Answer**: You had no choice but to guess.

Whether you got it right or wrong, write one line explaining the core logic. Label it with its number (1–6). This is how you track the ""health"" of your operation. Operational mastery is about watching your error codes shift over time:

|**Stage**|**Focus & Transformation**|**Goal**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Initial Phase**|Your log will be dominated by **Category 1, 5, and 6** errors.|Identify primary content gaps and initial logic flaws.|
|**The Pivot**|**Category 1s should vanish.** Your focus shifts to conquering **3s and 4s**.|Transition from ""knowing facts"" to ""mastering AAMC reasoning.""|
|**Zero Tolerance**|**Category 2 errors are operational failures.** You are handing points back for free.|**Eliminate these completely** to break into the 128+ range.|

After a while, Practice Questions are no longer for finding content gaps. They are for finding Logic Gaps. **The ultimate test of logic is this:** ""How else could I have arrived at this answer **IF** I didn't have the specific science knowledge? Is it even possible?"" (Usually, the answer is yes. Through units, graph trends, or passage context).

* **<Mindset: Simplify the Q-Stem>**

Before you dive into the answers, strip the question to its bare bones.

* ⁠**Chem/Phys (C/P)**
   * Stop looking for a complex ""science"" answer and start looking for the puzzle pieces
   * What information do I need? (What numbers/variables are in the passage?)
   * What units are being used? (The units often dictate the formula).
   * What topic is being tested? (Is this a Titration problem or a Lens problem?)
* **CARS**
   * What is the topic? (Don't lose the forest for the trees).
   * What is the author's tone? (Is he a fan or a critic?)
   * What would I do if I were opposing? (If I had to argue against this author, what would I say?)
   * Did I build the main idea from one sentence to the next? (Is my logic a continuous chain or a bunch of random guesses?)
* **CARS BONUS TIP: Try to figure out the question type!**
   * **CMP (Did you understand?) usually starts with**, ""The author is..."", or ""The main idea of the passage is...""
   * **RWT (Can you find evidence in the passage?) usually starts with**, ""Based on the passage..."", or ""According to the xxx...""
   * **RBT (Can you step outside of the box?) almost always starts with** ""Assume that...."", or ""If xxx were to be found as an evidence..."", or ""Suppose xxx, if true, then it would most likely weaken/strengthen...""
* **Bio/Biochem (B/B)**
   * What experiment is the researcher doing? (Why are they even in the fucking lab today?)
   * What is the independent/dependent variable? (What are they touching, and what is moving?)
   * What result is seen? What else is expected? (Does the data match the hypothesis?)
* **Psych/Soc (P/S)**
   * What is the specific social/behavioral context? (Is this at a macro/societal level or micro/individual level?)
   * Which two similar terms are they trying to bait me with? (Is this a distinction of intent or result?)
   * Does this definition fit the exact scenario in the passage? (AAMC loves giving you a 'correct' definition that simply doesn't apply to the story provided).

# Part 3: The Mental & Physical Game

**The ""Desensitization"" Protocol**

If you’re like me, your heart starts racing the moment you see that exam screen. To hit a 515+, you need to master your physiological response. **Go back to the Full-Length exams you’ve already finished. Reset them.** You are NOT doing this to ""re-test"" your knowledge. You're doing this to desensitize your brain to the UI.

**By repeatedly opening the exam screen, you train your body to recognize that environment as a familiar office, not a battleground.**

**When to Push Back Your Exam Date**

Deciding whether to postpone is one of the hardest decisions you’ll make. Stop relying on your ""gut feeling"" and look at the Data. Here are the non-negotiable criteria for knowing when to push back: If your goal is a 515, you need to be hitting at least 513–514 on your last two AAMC FLs. Test day nerves are real. **If you aren't within 2 points of your target score one week before the exam, you aren't ""ready""**. You’re gambling. Don't gamble with your application cycle.

**Exam Day: Tactical Operations & Rituals**

**Get to the testing center at least 40 minutes early.** Between checking your ID, reading the rules, and the mandatory security checks, 15 minutes is never enough. If there are 5 people in front of you, you’ll start your exam in a state of panic. **Don't let a ""check-in delay"" be the reason your heart rate spikes at 8:00 AM.**

Here are some general advices:

* **The moment a section ends, it is dead to you.** Delete it from your brain. Do not waste a single second of your break wondering if you got that physics question wrong.
* **Use the break to load the ""Game Plan"" for the next section.** “Okay, CARS is next. I’m looking for transition words. I’m finding the author’s tone. If the first passage is 7 questions, I’ll pace accordingly.”
* Use your breaks fully, but **don't feel obligated to sit there for the full 30 minutes if it breaks your momentum**. I only took 15 minutes for lunch because that was exactly what I needed to shift focus without getting ""cold."" Listen to your own pace, not the clock.
* **You might think you have a 10-minute break, but you actually have 3 minutes**. Every time you leave or enter, you have to do the ID check and the palm vein scan. If the center is busy, this ""security theatrical"" nonsense eats up half your break. Plan your bathroom trips as if you only have 3 minutes total.
* **Testing centers can be noisy**. People coughing, the clicking of keyboards. Most centers provide foam earplugs or noise-canceling headphones. Use them. Create a ""sensory deprivation tank"" so it’s just you and the screen.
* **Avoid a massive ""carb-crash"" lunch**. Go for protein and complex carbs (like nuts or a simple sandwich). You don't want to hit a 2:00 PM slump during the hardest passages of B/B.
* If you know, without a shadow of a doubt, that you had a catastrophic meltdown (like missing an entire passage in two sections), **you have the option to void.** But remember: everyone feels like they failed. Only void if something objectively went wrong with the ""operation,"" not because the questions felt hard.

# Part 4: Life, Logic, and Final Words

**Survival: How to Balance Life with the MCAT**

Many people think you need 8–10 hours of free time every day to conquer this exam. **I am here to tell you that is a myth.** I am a father, a husband, and a full-time ICU nurse. I only had 2–3 hours on weekdays. If I could do it with a 7-month-old baby and a full-time job, you can too. Here is exactly how I managed my life for 4 months.

* **Weekdays**
   * 05:50 AM: Wake up. Help my wife feed the baby and prep for the day.
   * 07:15 AM-04:30 PM: Work.
   * 05:30 PM: Get home. Dinner, family time, and putting the baby to sleep.
   * 07:30 PM – 10:00 PM: The War Zone. This was my only time to study. If I felt ambitious, I pushed it to 10:30 PM.
   * Total Weekday Study: \~12.5 hours per week.
* **Saturdays**
   * 06:30 AM: Wake up, light stretch, and mental prep.
   * 08:00 AM: Full-Length (FL) Exam.
   * 02:30 PM: Finish FL. Go for a walk. Do anything to forget the exam.
   * Evening: Dinner and baby duty. Only after the baby was asleep did I open the iPad to start the review.
* **Sundays**
   * 06:30 AM: Wake up and head to Church.
   * 01:00 PM: Get home and do household chores.
   * 02:00 PM – 05:30 PM: Deep study session.
   * 05:30 PM – 07:30 PM: Make dinner and play with the baby.
   * 07:30 PM – 10:30 PM: Final study sprint of the week.

I did this for 4 months straight. **This equates to roughly 250 total hours and 6 Full-Lengths.** None of this, absolutely none of it, would have been possible without my amazing wife. She carried the weight when I was buried in books. **Don't wait for ""perfect conditions."" They don't exist.** 

**Why you must front-load the effort**

In the beginning, it’s going to feel like you’re dying. But there is a fundamental law to this process that you need to understand.

We often call people ""genius"" if they can produce results while minimizing effort. Maybe those people exist, but I’ll be honest with you. I am not one of them. And chances are, neither are you.

**The Formula: Output = Effort x Time**

Think of your output as your goal score. In this equation, Effort and Time are inversely proportional.

If you try to decrease your Effort (by taking shortcuts or being passive), the Time required to reach your goal will skyrocket. You’ll find yourself looping back, re-reading the same chapters months later because nothing ""stuck.""

The most efficient way to win this game is to **Front-Load the Effort**. It’s going to be brutal for the first few weeks. It takes time for these concepts to finally ""stick"" to your brain.

But once that initial input is solidified, your future self will thank you. Because you put in the maximum effort early on, **you won't have to waste time ""revisiting"" or getting lost in content gaps during the final weeks.**

By the time you reach the practice phase, the information is already a part of you. You’ve already paid the ""Effort tax,"" so now you can spend your Time exclusively on Operational Mastery. Don't look for the easy way out. There is no ""low effort"" path to a 515+. Push the effort to the front, endure the grind now, and buy yourself the time you’ll need for the final sprint.

**Define Yourself**

I really want to tell you that your MCAT score doesn't define who you are or what kind of physician you will become. But the cold, hard truth is, **it does define you**, at least to the Admissions Committee.

They need a metric to see everyone on a level playing field. Without the MCAT, **even GPA becomes a source of bias**. Is a 4.0 from a local state school better than a 3.7 from an Ivy League? Nobody knows. That’s why the MCAT exists.

There’s a saying: **""If worrying made worries disappear, I’d just worry all day.""**

People who only worry end up blaming their ""wrong position"" for their failure. That’s just **Self-Serving Bias**. If you keep pushing forward every single day, you will eventually reach the place you want to be, regardless of where you started.

Your score on the next FL might not be perfectly proportional to the amount of effort you put in over the last two weeks. Don't let that discourage you. **Focus on gaining just 1-2 points per subsection**. If you gain just 1 point per subsection, your total score jumps by 4 points. Imagine that compound effect over 10 Full-Lengths:

488 → 494 (+6) → 498 (+4) → 502 → 506 → 510 → 514 → 518 → 522 → 526.

This is the result of just one point at a time. Consistency is your most lethal weapon. Don't chase a 520 in a day; **chase 1 point today**.

**The Ultimate Irony**

I am posting this on Reddit, and the irony isn’t lost on me.

If you are reading this right now, it means you are browsing. It means you are looking for that ""one magic tip"" or looking for someone to tell you it’s going to be okay.

**Consider this post your exit sign.** You’ve read the strategy, you’ve seen the schedule of a man with a job and a baby, and you’ve seen the logic. **You don’t need any more ""tips."" You don't need to see someone else's 528 ""success story"" to feel motivated.**

Close this tab. Log out. Delete the app if you have to. Go back to your Anki, back to your UWhirl. You will only shine through the silent repetition and the grind you put in today.

**""Let your preparation be silent, and your success be thunderous. I wish you clarity of mind and fire on your exam day.""**

I had no problem with that, and we were watching a pretty PG movie so it wasn't an issue. 

But halfway through the movie we ordered some pizza and we had it on a plate on the coffee table. We were just eating slices one by one. And then I realized her sister was resting her feet on table (barefoot) and her feet were touching the pizza. It's not like she was just skimming it, I mean she practically had her entire foot leaning against the top of the pizza. I found this really weird, and was avoiding eating the slices she touched, but ended up eating it anyways because I didn't want to make a scene. 

Afterwards I talked to my girlfriend about this and she said that I was being dramatic and its not a big deal. It escalated after that and we got into an argument. I would understand if her sister was a toddler or a very young child, but she seems old enough to know that you should't be touching other's food, especially with your feet. 

So I just wanna know, AITA for getting upset/angry about this? ",30,1768503851.0,AmItheAsshole,56,0.78,False
1qdsiiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1qdsiiw/i_stole_someones_lunch_from_the_shared_office/,I stole someone’s lunch from the shared office fridge and lied about it,"I’m 27 and I work in a small office where we all share one sad little fridge that smells like onions no matter what you do. A couple months ago I was having one of those weeks where everything felt like it was sliding off the rails. I’d forgotten breakfast, my coffee spilled in my bag, and I realized around 1pm that I left my lunch on the counter at home. Normally I’d just suck it up, grab a granola bar, whatever. But that day I was in this stupid panicky mood and I kept thinking, I can’t do another meeting with my stomach chewing itself. So I opened the fridge and there was this paper bag with a sticky note that said “Please don’t take, I’m diabetic” with a little smiley face. I saw that, I swear I did, and I still grabbed it. That’s the part that makes me feel like an actual garbage person. In my head I was like, maybe they have a spare snack, maybe they won’t even be in today, maybe the note is old. All these tiny excuses stacking up so I could do the thing I already decided to do.

It was a turkey sandwich, an apple, and one of those small protein boxes with cheese and nuts. I ate it at my desk like nothing, and it tasted good which almost made me more mad at myself. About 30 minutes later I heard someone in the break room going “Did anyone see my lunch? It had a note on it.” I froze. People started doing that half-jokey “fridge thief again” thing and asking around. Someone even said we should put a camera in there, like it was funny. The person who lost it looked genuinely stressed and kind of pale, and I just sat there pretending to work, face hot, heart pounding. When they asked me directly if I’d seen it, I said “No, sorry, maybe it got tossed by accident?” and I hated myself as the words came out. Later I watched them eat vending machine crackers and a soda, and they tried to act normal, but you could tell they were annoyed and a little embarassed. I keep replaying that sticky note in my head. It wasn’t some random “hands off” note, it was a real reason, and I ignored it because I was hungry and selfish.

I haven’t done it again, but that almost feels worse because it means I knew it was wrong immediately and I still did it that one time. Every time I open the fridge now I feel my stomach drop like I’m about to get caught, even though nothing happened. I’ve thought about leaving money in the fridge in an envelope, or buying a replacement lunch and putting it in there with an apology note, but I’m scared it’ll just point back at me and everyone will remember. So I’ve done the coward thing, which is nothing. And yeah, I regret it. Not just “oops” regret, like real shame. I stole from someone’s basic need and then I lied to their face. I don’t know how to make that right without making it about me, but I also don’t want to be the kind of person who can do that and just move on.

1qdshzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/latebloomergaybros/comments/1qdshzm/the_life_he_chose/,The Life He Chose,"I've posted here before about my struggle with my decision of if or when or how to come out to my wife. I've spent a lot of time thinking about have received a lot of recommendations to begin journaling to help me put my thoughts in words. I started doing some writing and decided to create a story instead. The first 5 chapters are auto-biographical and 6-10 are my own premonition of the future if I were to come out to my wife.

# Chapter One: A Marriage That Went Quiet                                     

At fifty-six, he could trace the arc of his life with unsettling clarity.

Thirty-plus years married. Two children grown and gone—one son, one daughter—each carving out lives of their own. A house filled with shared routines and memories so familiar they barely registered anymore. He loved his wife. He believed that without question.

What he did not love was the silence between them.

Sex had not ended abruptly. It thinned first, stretched further apart, lost its urgency. Desire became something they scheduled, then something they avoided discussing altogether. When his body began to hesitate, then fail him entirely, the shame lodged deep and stayed there. Each unsuccessful attempt made the next one harder to face.

Eventually, they stopped trying.

His wife grew quieter. More careful. When she finally told him she felt unwanted—rejected—he had no language for what was happening inside him. He only knew that his frustration had nowhere to go, and that something in him felt tightly coiled, restless, unfinished.

# Chapter Two: The Unplanned Night

The bar was only meant to kill time.

He ordered a drink, loosened his tie, and struck up idle conversation with the man beside him. It was nothing at first—work complaints, travel fatigue, the kind of exchange that usually ended politely.

But this man listened differently. Looked at him directly. Let pauses linger.

There was a warmth to the attention that unsettled him—not aggressive, not crude, but deliberate. When the man smiled, it felt personal, as though he were being seen rather than evaluated. He noticed himself leaning in, lowering his voice, enjoying the unfamiliar tension gathering in his chest.

When the realization dawned—quiet, unmistakable—that the man was interested, his pulse quickened. Not with fear. With recognition. When the invitation came, it felt less like temptation and more like permission.

Walking back to the hotel room, he felt unsteady, aware of every step, every breath. A part of him waited for panic, for guilt to slam into him and stop everything. Instead, he felt focused—present in his body in a way he had not been for years.

Inside, the other man moved with confidence born of experience. He did not rush. He guided. He noticed hesitation and answered it with patience rather than pressure. His touch was intentional, grounding, as if he already understood what he needed before he could name it himself.

What followed was unlike anything he had known.

There was no strain, no expectation to perform. His body responded easily, eagerly, as though relieved to finally stop resisting something it had always wanted. He felt himself yielding, trusting, letting the other man set the pace and take the lead. The surrender felt natural—necessary—as though a long-held breath had finally been released.

What struck him most was not the physical pleasure, intense as it was, but the *clarity*. The absence of doubt. The way his mind went quiet, his body certain. For the first time in his life, sex felt instinctive rather than negotiated.

Afterward, lying awake in the dark, he replayed the evening in fragments—the tone of the man’s voice, the certainty of his hands, the way his own body had answered without hesitation.

One thought repeated itself until it felt undeniable:

*This was missing. This has always been missing.*

# Chapter Three: Hunger Learns Its Name

He told himself it had been an anomaly.

Within weeks, he knew that was a lie.

The app came next—found late one night, curiosity masquerading as research. The language startled him at first: direct, unapologetic, openly hungry. Men who wanted what they wanted and didn’t apologize for it.

At first, he used it only when he traveled. It felt contained then—temporary, distant from the life he returned to. Hotels made anonymity easy. A different city, a different name, a different version of himself.

But the desire didn’t stay contained.

Soon he found himself opening the app at home—late at night, early in the morning, in quiet moments when the house felt too still. He told himself he was only looking. Only reading. But proximity changed everything. Faces he recognized. Men who lived minutes away.

The risk made his pulse quicken.

Meetings were arranged carefully, almost professionally. Timing mattered. Locations were chosen with deliberation—places where chance encounters felt unlikely, exits always visible. Every discreet hook-up carried a charge that went beyond desire: the awareness that one mistake, one familiar face, one unread message at the wrong time could unravel everything.

The danger sharpened the experience.

Each encounter felt stolen, compressed, urgent. He learned how to compartmentalize with frightening efficiency—sliding back into his role at home as though nothing had happened, carrying the secret like a private current running beneath his life.

He learned quickly that what stirred him most wasn’t conquest, but surrender. Being wanted for his willingness. Being guided. Being allowed to let go.

Some encounters were forgettable. Some awkward. Others left him shaken by how completely his body answered, how easily he slipped into that familiar, grounding sense of release.

At home, life continued.

He remained a husband, a father, dependable and present. But sex with his wife stayed rare, strained, unsuccessful. Her hurt grew more visible. When she finally told him he had to figure this out—for both of them—he felt the weight of truth pressing in.

Still, he kept going.

At first only while traveling. Later, closer to home—each meeting shadowed by the knowledge that exposure was not a question of *if*, but *when*.

# Chapter Four: Discovery

The photo ended the illusion.

When his wife confronted him, her voice was steady at first, then trembling. He denied it instinctively, desperately, but the evidence spoke louder than his words. The truth emerged in fragments—carefully trimmed, incomplete.

In the days that followed, the house felt brittle, as though any wrong movement might shatter what remained. They spoke cautiously, circling the damage without quite touching it. He slept lightly. She slept facing away from him.

Eventually, she asked him the question directly.

She didn’t accuse. She didn’t soften it either.

She asked him if he was gay.

The word landed heavily between them. He felt his body tense, his mind racing ahead of his mouth. He told her he didn’t know. That he was confused. That he loved her. That what had happened didn’t mean what she feared it meant.

She listened, eyes searching his face, as if looking for something he himself could not yet see.

In therapy, the conversations became more deliberate. The couples therapist asked about desire, honesty, trust. His wife spoke openly about feeling rejected, about the years of quiet humiliation she had internalized, believing his lack of desire was a reflection of her own inadequacy.

At one session, she spoke plainly.

She told him she needed the truth—not just about what he had done, but about what he wanted.

She asked him if he wanted to explore a gay life. If that was where his desire was truly leading him. And if it was, she said, she needed to know now.

She gave him a choice.

Her, and the life they had built together.

Or the freedom to explore what he would not yet name.

The room felt unbearably small.

He was not ready.

The idea of losing her—of losing the house, the family structure, the shared history—felt like standing at the edge of a cliff. He had spent decades constructing this life. He did not know who he would be without it.

So he chose safety.

He told her he wanted their marriage. That he was committed. That what had happened was a mistake born of stress and confusion, not identity. He promised again that he would stop, that he would focus on them, that he would do whatever it took to repair the damage.

She wanted to believe him.

They agreed to try more therapy.

At first, they worked hard at it.

The therapist gave them structured exercises—written questions they answered separately, then read aloud to each other. Prompts designed to slow them down, to make room for listening rather than defending. They spoke about early memories, unmet needs, resentments that had calcified quietly over the years.

Some evenings ended with tears. Others with a fragile sense of closeness neither of them had felt in a long time.

They began setting aside intentional time together. Walks. Dinners without distractions. Conversations that stretched late into the night. The effort felt awkward at first, but also hopeful—like rediscovering a shared language they had once spoken fluently.

Their physical relationship stirred again.

Tentatively at first, then with growing confidence. He still struggled at times—his body not always cooperating—but the renewed emotional intimacy softened the pressure. When he was able to go to completion, it felt less like a test he had passed and more like a shared moment of relief. Proof, he told himself, that the marriage could still work.

For a while, things looked good.

But trust returned more slowly.

His wife remained watchful. She asked careful questions—sometimes directly, sometimes obliquely. Was that really the only time? Was there anything else she needed to know? Did he still feel drawn to men?

Each question tightened something inside him.

He answered consistently, sticking to the version of the story he had chosen. He reassured her, over and over, that it had been a single mistake, that he understood now what he stood to lose.

The weight of those half-truths followed him everywhere.

As weeks turned into months, life began to press back in. Work demands increased. Their children needed support. Social obligations returned. The intensity of their focus on each other softened, then thinned.

Quality time became easier to postpone.

The conversations grew shorter. The exercises stopped.

And slowly, almost imperceptibly, the distance began to creep back in.

For over a year, he held the line.

But the desire did not fade. It pressed harder, sharpened by deprivation. When he finally returned to the app, the next man felt like a reminder of breath after being underwater too long.

The hunger returned whole.

# Chapter Five: The Therapist Who Didn’t Look Away

In individual therapy, he stayed guarded. He spoke around the truth, never through it.

By then, he was still using the app.

Even after promising himself—and his wife—that he would stop, he found reasons to return. Moments of stress. Moments of loneliness. Moments when guilt felt unbearable and desire offered immediate, if temporary, relief. Each encounter was followed by a familiar cycle: release, followed quickly by shame.

The guilt was relentless.

One afternoon, he arranged to meet a man not far from home—close enough that the familiarity made him uneasy, close enough that the risk itself became part of the charge. The house was quiet. The timing felt carefully calculated. He told himself it would be quick. Contained.

Inside the other man’s place, the atmosphere was hushed, intimate, suspended. He felt himself slipping into that familiar headspace—focused, yielding, relieved of thought—when his phone vibrated sharply against his thigh.

He froze.

His wife’s name lit the screen.

For a moment, he didn’t answer, heart hammering as the phone buzzed again. When he finally picked up, his voice sounded distant to his own ears.

She asked where he was.

The question landed with terrifying precision.

He told her he had stepped out to run an errand. That traffic was worse than expected. That he’d be home shortly. She pressed gently at first, then with more concern—why did he sound distracted, why was there background noise, had he forgotten they had plans that evening?

Each question felt like a narrowing corridor.

He forced himself to stay calm, to keep his tone even, to build a story that would hold. He added unnecessary detail, the kind meant to sound convincing. He listened carefully for disbelief in her voice, for hesitation.

Finally, she accepted the explanation.

When the call ended, the room felt abruptly exposed, fragile. Whatever momentum had existed was gone. He dressed quickly, apologetically, unable to meet the other man’s eyes. The drive home was tense and silent, his mind replaying how close everything had come to collapse.

The desire had evaporated.

All that remained was fear—and the heavy awareness that he was no longer in control of the secret he believed he was managing.

He loved his wife. He hated the deception. Yet the pull toward men felt compulsive, urgent, rooted somewhere deeper than choice. He told himself he would stop after the next time. That each encounter was a final indulgence before recommitment.

It never was.

In therapy, he spoke of stress. Of confusion. Of feeling disconnected from himself. He avoided naming the app, the meetings, the way he structured his days around opportunity and secrecy. The silence felt safer than the truth, even as it hollowed him out.

Eventually, the strain of withholding became too heavy.

He sought out someone else—a clinical psychologist whose practice focused on sexuality. From the first session, the questions were different. More precise. Less forgiving of avoidance.

He was asked not just about desire, but behavior. Patterns. Consequences. What he felt immediately after sex, not during it. He admitted—haltingly at first—that he was still meeting men, still unable to stop, still drowning in guilt afterward.

He was asked about childhood admiration, not just attraction. About fantasy—where he placed himself within it. About what brought him relief.

He spoke haltingly at first, then more freely. About surrender. About how easily his body responded when control was taken from him. About the shame that followed—and the peace. About the way guilt and desire seemed to feed each other, locked in a loop he couldn’t break.

After several sessions, the therapist said it plainly.

“You’re gay,” he said. “And you always have been.”

The words did not shock him.

They clarified everything.

What followed was an awakening—and an escalation. He increased his encounters, driven by urgency, by the sense of lost time. Sex became affirmation, release, escape—but now paired with a growing awareness of what he was risking, what he was losing.

In therapy, the questions deepened.

“What do you think you’re being punished for?”  
“Who are you when desire isn’t doing the work for you?”

He didn’t know yet.

# Chapter Six: The Decision to Speak

Knowing the truth and living it were not the same thing.

For months, the words sat inside him, heavy and volatile. He rehearsed the conversation endlessly—imagined timing, tone, gentleness. He told himself he was waiting for the right moment, but the truth was simpler: he was terrified.

He still loved his wife. He still cared deeply for her well-being. And he knew, with painful clarity, that what he was about to say would wound her irreparably.

Some nights, lying beside her, he nearly spoke. Other nights, he convinced himself he could endure the dissonance a little longer. Therapy pushed him gently but firmly toward honesty, toward the understanding that withholding the truth was its own form of cruelty.

When he finally told her, there was no careful way to say it.

Her reaction was immediate and visceral.

She felt betrayed, deceived, rejected. Years of sexual distance suddenly rearranged themselves into a devastating narrative, one that made her question her own worth, her own reality. Her anger was fierce, raw, and deeply personal.

Nothing he said softened the impact.

The marriage did not survive the truth.

# Chapter Seven: Collapse and Excess

The divorce was bitter, drawn-out, emotionally brutal.

It was not just the end of a marriage—it was the dismantling of a life constructed piece by piece over decades. Decisions that once felt theoretical became immediate and heavy. The house had to be sold. The place where their children had grown up, where holidays had layered memory upon memory, was reduced to square footage and market value.

They walked through rooms cataloging objects like strangers. Furniture. Photographs. Boxes of shared history. Who would take what? What mattered? What could be let go? Each decision carried a quiet grief neither of them knew how to voice.

There were spreadsheets and statements. Accounts divided. Retirement funds split. Assets that had once represented security now felt like evidence of failure. He watched his future narrow into unfamiliar numbers, wondering how far they would stretch.

And then there was the most frightening question of all:

Where would he go?

He found an apartment after weeks of searching—small, neutral, and impersonal. Clean walls. Empty rooms. When he moved in, the quiet pressed in on him immediately. No footsteps in the other room. No familiar rhythms. No one to account for his presence or absence.

For the first time in his life, he was alone.

At night, the loneliness was sharpest. He sat with the question he had avoided for years: *What does living as a gay man actually mean?* Without secrecy, without rebellion, without a marriage to push against—who was he supposed to be?

The uncertainty was unbearable.

So he returned to what he knew.

Without the constraints of marriage, his sexual life expanded rapidly. He sought men relentlessly—not for intimacy, but for affirmation. One man was not enough. He needed many. Overlapping attention. Messages arriving faster than he could answer them.

He wanted to feel chosen again and again.

Some encounters were brief and transactional, leaving him emptier than before. Others were intense—nights where he found himself surrounded, surrendering to attention without asking for names or stories. In those moments, he felt consumed, wanted, momentarily significant.

He met men in apartments, in hotel rooms, at gatherings where anonymity dissolved boundaries. Sometimes he was drawn to confidence, sometimes to dominance, sometimes simply to availability. The common thread was urgency—his need to erase the silence waiting for him at home.

For a while, the volume of it all worked.

The constant movement. The constant desire. The sense that he could make up for decades of denial by compressing everything into the present. If he could just experience *enough*, maybe the ache would quiet.

But between encounters, the questions crept back in.

Was this what being a gay man meant?  
Was this freedom—or just another form of escape?  
Was he discovering himself, or disappearing again?

He pushed harder instead of answering.

Eventually, even the excess began to feel hollow. Even surrounded by bodies, he felt unseen. Desired, but not known. Used, but not held.

And the loneliness returned—louder than before.

# Chapter Eight: What Remained

He still enjoyed sex with men.

That truth did not disappear with time or therapy or reflection. In the arms of men, his body softened in a way it never had before. There was an ease there—an instinctive alignment between desire and response—that required no explanation or effort. Touch felt natural. Wanting felt honest. When he was with a man, his mind finally quieted.

Those were the only moments when he did not question his decision to come out.

In those moments, he felt present. Grounded. Real.

But when the encounters ended—when the weight of another man’s body lifted from his, when the room emptied and he returned to his apartment alone—something else surfaced. Something heavier.

What he really wanted was not there.

He missed his family.

The realization came quietly at first, then with increasing force. He missed his ex-wife in ways that surprised him—not just the familiarity of her presence, but the shared history, the private language of decades spent together. He thought about the plans they had once made for the future: travel they had talked about, milestones they had assumed they would reach side by side. Retirement. Growing old together. He had walked away from all of it, and now there was no undoing that choice.

He missed their friends—the couples they had known for years, the easy dinners, the sense of belonging that came from being part of something stable and understood. Those connections had fallen away with the marriage, collateral damage no one had prepared him for.

And most of all, he missed his children.

He replayed conversations in his head, wondering where things had gone wrong, wondering if there had been a way to tell the truth without breaking everything. In their eyes, he knew how the story looked. He was the one who left. He was the one who chose something else over the family they had grown up believing in.

That narrative haunted him.

He asked himself questions he had no answers to. How could he rebuild relationships that felt so thoroughly damaged? What did accountability look like when regret could not reverse time? Would his children ever forgive him—not just for the divorce, but for the pain it caused their mother?

At night, these questions followed him into bed.

Even after a good encounter—even after moments of connection and warmth with a man who held him close—he felt the absence of what he had lost. Sex gave him clarity about who he was, but it could not give him back the life he had dismantled.

And slowly, painfully, he began to understand that both things could be true at once.

He was most comfortable in the arms of men.  
And he was grieving the family he had left behind.

The work ahead of him was no longer about choosing one truth over the other. It was about learning how to live with both—and deciding what kind of man he wanted to be in the space that remained

# Chapter Nine: Repair

He reached out to his children without defense. Listened to their anger without correcting it. Accepted distance where forgiveness wasn’t ready.

With men, he began choosing differently. Lingering. Talking. Valuing time and presence over urgency. Learning that intimacy could exist without erasure.

Some nights ended without sex.

Some ended with honesty.

# Chapter Ten: Acceptance

He had settled into his life alone.

It wasn’t something he enjoyed, exactly—but it was something he had learned to live with. The apartment no longer felt temporary. It held routines now: morning coffee in the same chair, evenings spent reading or walking, weekends that belonged only to him. The loneliness still surfaced, but it no longer felt like an emergency. It was a condition of the life he was living, not a verdict on it.

He continued to work, continued therapy, continued the slow, careful work of staying present with himself.

His relationship with his ex-wife remained complicated. There were conversations that felt almost familiar, moments when old rhythms resurfaced briefly before retreating again. He tried to show up consistently—without expectations, without pressure. Sometimes it seemed to help. Other times, the distance was unmistakable.

With his children, progress came in small, uneven steps. He was invited to some family events now—birthdays, occasional holidays—but he could feel the invisible line he wasn’t allowed to cross. He was there, but not fully folded back in. Things would never be the same, and he was learning to accept that truth without resentment.

Some losses hurt more than he had anticipated.

Many of the friends he had shared with his wife—people he had known for decades—quietly disappeared from his life. Some couldn’t understand his choices. Others didn’t try. The absence of those friendships carried its own grief, one he hadn’t fully anticipated. These were people who had known him through entire chapters of his life, and now they were gone.

He mourned them quietly.

Daniel was no longer part of his life either. The relationship had ended without drama—no betrayal, no bitterness—just the recognition that it wasn’t meant to last. He continued dating, but now on his own terms. Some men felt compatible, others didn’t, and for the first time he trusted himself to make those distinctions without forcing anything.

He enjoyed himself. He allowed pleasure without using it as proof of worth or as refuge from pain.

And still, sometimes, doubt crept in.

Late at night, or during long drives, he wondered what his life might have looked like if he had made different choices. If honesty had come earlier. If courage had arrived sooner—or later. This wasn’t the life he had planned. It wasn’t the future he had imagined building when he was younger.

But it was the life he chose.

That distinction mattered.

He had stopped trying to justify himself to the past or explain himself to everyone else. He knew now that peace didn’t come from perfect outcomes or universal understanding. It came from alignment—from living in a way that no longer required denial.

His life was quieter. Smaller in some ways. More complicated in others.

But it was honest.

And in that honesty, imperfect and incomplete as it was, he had finally found peace.",5,1768503797.0,latebloomergaybros,3,1.0,False

1qdsfgq,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1qdsfgq/difficult_thing_to_admit_to_myself_accountability/,Difficult thing to admit to myself- Accountability from 4 years of poly dating.,"It’s time for me to take a breather on dating and just live my life for a bit... Also that there's no right or wrong way to date, but I've definitely learned what doesn't work for me over the past 4 years. 

I’m 40nb. I’ve been poly, partnered and nested 19 years, since I was 21

My partner was a SW when we met, and we both agreed we didn’t believe in monogamy.   
Due to a combo of being happy, picky, Demi, and poor circumstances of anyone we liked not being particularly poly, we just never really *dated.* I had a boyfriend at one point, but he got married mono after about a year. As such, the first 15 was almost “secular” we’d had hookups and I have had flings, but nothing long-term or sustained romantically. 

4 years ago a close friend approached me about hooking up, and it was a dream come true at first. 

I had a huge crush on them. They were poly. We had really strong intensity. We had a \*ton\* of niche special interests and projects in common. The sex was incredible. They also brought a lot to a dynamic that I didn’t have with my spouse. I was unmasking a lot of neurodivergence with them for the first time. I could see a very clear future with them. 

We were also deeply traumatized, late life DX neurodivergent, and it got messy really fast. I’ve never been so confused or upset in my adult life. The way it ended was…. Damaging for me. I felt really intense betrayal and lost a really important friend, all while learning what an attachment wound even was.  I’m still pretty frustrated that my own personal revelations around childhood and developmental trauma recovery would be tied into dating this person in such a hazardous and chaotic way…. But also, I guess I needed that level of discomfort to be thrust into doing the work.



A few mos after we broke up, I started dating on the apps for the first time.   
I realized it was kind of cool that you could just check a box and say you’re poly.   
I’d never really dated in high school or college.   
Over the past 4 years I’ve been through about 8 sexual/romantic relationships…   
Some of those folks are still friends. A couple of them were absolute shit shows. Some were just… fine. 



I remember when I first started, my therapist said “as an expert level recovering people pleaser, you’re going to be walking into this situation reflexively trying to convince everyone to accept you without realizing whether or not you like them yet. If you can treat this as an opportunity to experiment with and learn what you want and what you like, you’ll have a great time.” 



It’s taught me a TON about boundaries, what I’m looking for, what my red flags and non-negotiables are, and what my capacity is for relationships. I can draw a through line from each relationship and see the way I progressively left dysfunctional dynamics more quickly, said no with more conviction and comfort, and started to dismantle a lot of people pleasing behaviors that I’ve unwittingly carried most of my life. 



In another sense I feel very lucky to know that my marriage is healthy by contrast. It’s hard to overstate the importance of knowing someone has your back and is reliable. We give each other a ton of autonomy and respect, and I feel like I have the space to explore.  We’ve buried friends and pets, grieved together, run businesses together, etc. It’s really nice to know we have a strong basis in trust, even if there have been bumps along the way



All of that said, the unfortunate reality I’m faced with after a few dates following a recent break is: 



* While I’m glad for every relationship I had over the past 4 years and feel they were above board and in good faith, I have to admit to myself that on some level a part of me was just chasing some analog of that first dating experience. The intensity of it and the level of compatibility. This was to some extent objectifying other people.  



* The scarcity mentality around that is one of the deepest core limiting beliefs I’ve had to work on in order to be a happier person, and letting go of situations that don’t serve me has been excruciatingly difficult to learn to do. The amount of grief that’s caught up with me around it has been pretty incredible.



* Dating apps don’t work for me. Period. Starting a relationship with a coffee ""interview"" just frames things in a weird way that angles toward transactional. It feels like mating in captivity, and it’s too easy for me to fall into rushed behaviors that don’t serve me. Sex too soon. Wifey shit too soon. Playing house with strangers because there’s this subtext of \*DATING\* and no basis of trust/familiarity/rapport/shared values. It feels like it's happening backwards. It feels like… not so much like they don’t work, but it creates a huge onus for boundaries and communication because so much subtext is injected with a stranger around sex/romance immediately.



* I see a lot of people on here who default to “casual for the first 6 mos, and then we’ll see if you are compatible/trustworthy/interesting enough to be more”…. This is just backwards for me, and I'm not sure that will ever change. I think this is an advanced move for someone like me and one I’m not capable of. I’ve recently posted on here about situations that frustrated me where someone would reveal they were lying about age in a first date and I’d struggle with delayed processing, etc. I'm finding the way my nervous system reacts to unsafe people is just... creating a lot of work for myself the deeper in I get. 



* After a lot of experimenting with different shades of casual, I recently saw someone say “Nothing wrong with hookup culture, but as a demisexual, my philosophy is simple: I’d never sleep with someone I wouldn’t trade lives with or hook up with someone I don’t trust enough to list as an emergency contact”…. I think my version of this is that I wouldn’t get into a sexual relationship with someone I wouldn’t take acid with, and I know that sounds like a lot. I mean that in the sense that I’m really tired of finding out how a stranger handles NRE brain chemistry \*before\* I’ve established some basis of trust, shared reality, conflict patterns, and just general rapport. I don’t think I have it in me to be nonchalant about that, and I see sex as way too personal and emotionally connected of an experience by default to want to reduce it down to “casual”. I get the work people have done around their own stigma with sex, etc. . . I get that other folks don’t feel this way, and I realize my problem is thinking I \*should\* learn to be more like them. It's just not how I'm conditioned or want to be conditioned despite being extremely sex positive and with a strong libido. I think this is what frustrates me the most is I \*deeply\* want to be promiscuous but it feels like too much of a safety thing, and I haven't learned to create enough internal safety yet. 



* There is a fundamental reality that I have to face- I can clearly see the limit to the amount of love, validation, security, and acceptance that I give myself. And that is directly limiting to the kind of relationships I’m ready and available for. When dealing with a certain type of unavailability and inconsistency in a partner, it makes that validation like a really ugly drug that I don’t think I wanna play with anymore. I know this is a little bit of ""guy takes mushrooms and realizes other people exist and have feelings"", but the aftertaste from the whole ""redemption arc as a relationship model"" is really disgusting and I'm tired of how it somewhat objectifies my partners. I've started seeing intimacy as more of a responsibility than an opportunity. I've started feeling more protective of my relationships as I grieve the ones that burned too hot to repair when there was rupture. The people who would have made great friends under less intense circumstances. 



* I'm learning that I've always had romantic and sexual attraction sneak up after months if not years of rapport building, and I kind of like it that way... even though my ADHD brain is \*geared\* for instant gratification and impulsivity. I do love that this experience has taught me to plug into, in a very RA-minded way, groups and causes that are very values aligned and driven. Queer community. Mutual Aid. Hobby clubs. Support groups. Not for a specific outcome but because the loneliness itch that I've been seeking to scratch is more about being of service and allowing myself to be embraced by community in turn (actually the much, much harder part) 



Going back to that first dating experience, I think I had the feeling that if I stopped and let this grief catch up with me from such a difficult experience 4 years back that the powerlessness of it would overwhelm me… As someone who was \*relentlessly\* bulled growing up, there’s a stubbornness toward feeling like I’d be admitting defeat. 

That if I’m not actively dating, I’m giving up on being poly and that I’ve failed in some sense. And in some sense it is an overwhelming and difficult feeling. 

But after 4 years of chasing a bit of a ghost, it also feels liberating to accept that I’m just… ready to accept what I've learned about dating, courtship, and how my nervous system builds safety with other people. . . . 

And focus on my friendships. Focus on so many creative outlets that were firing on all cylinders before I started dating in the first place. Accept the resentment I feel toward myself for letting such a toxic dynamic derail me, and for getting so swept up in it. Focus on building community and finding more joy for myself and not for the sake of some relationship that I’m trying to build up in a highly perfectionistic and performative way. 

I remember a year before I started dating my spouse… I was 18 and complaining to them about how I was single. They gave me a whole speech about how you typically don’t find love when you’re aggressively looking for it. That you focus on the things you love, and that’s what makes a person attractive. . . And that’s what attracts people to you. It’s funny that they’d be attracted to me in the most random way a year later…. And that we would end up still together 20 years later in the most unlikely way.",7,1768503650.0,polyamory,1,1.0,False

Men & Women,"It’s a simple question, but for me right now in life there are so many difficulties in making it happen, and I havnt fully decided what to do. If you want to only share your experience or read mine and give advice, either are fine, thanks for reading. 

So I 32m met my wife about 9 years ago, it never was an easy journey, we started long distance, there were issues with immigration stuff, she has some heath issues, and the list goes on. But we always have been best friends, shared hobbies, interests, values and goals in life, or so I thought from what we talked about all this time. 

Sex is a big issue (but not the only one), she has never had much drive but we used to occasionally, I thought after her health stuff was taken care of and under control, it would pick up, atleast thats what I was told. Spoiler: it did for a bit but never really changed and only has lessened over time, which is probably typical for a lot of married people, but not enough for me personally. All of 2024 we only had sex 2 times. By the end of the year I was frustrated with the direction life had been going over that year. I ended up engaging in some online cheating and was caught, cause I didn’t really hide it. This was the biggest blow our relationship suffered, we seperated for 2 months in 2025, I lived with my sister and took a vacation. We decided to come back together and try to make it work, rebuild and recover. 

The second main issue is financial, the agreement was always she would work for 2 years, we get a bigger house, have kids, then she could stay home till they started school. As of 2025 she pretty much just decided to stop working all together. She sits at home, draws, watches series, chills at the coffee shop with her friend and goes to the Pilates classes. She has blown through her savings from not working for a year (I always have taken care of bills, so she never has or needed to contribute the the household expenses). Our life is sustainable with her not working, but it personally doesn’t feel good to me, or progress us towards our agreed upon goals, or allow her to put money in her retirement account. 

The last issue at the start of 2025 was the revelation she dropped on me, she decided she either doesn’t want kids at all, or more specifically doesn’t want them with me. She has some health issues related to this topic and is working on getting them resolved, but she could get pregnant if she chose. She has specifically blamed me and used my past against me, I unfortunately was abused as a kid, and she never had been able to understand what I have been through and has a lot of issues with that. It really has affected me in a lot of ways throughout my life, but 2025 broke me, I started therapy and it has been helping my life overall tremendously which is good. But she hasn’t changed her position on this topic. 

I understand people change over time, but me as a person I have always been the same or always tried to improve my life. It’s hard for me to end things when it would just feel like quitting and giving up, something I hate the feeling of. I know some people say to divorce over much less, but I still don’t know if I feel valid in taking that step.

\-Looking to eat out every meal (not a big breakfast person, but i do enjoy coffee), midrange accommodation, and obviously I want to see as may historical sites as possible

Must sees?

This could be historical sites, regions, islands, day trips anywhere, etc

I’d love to hear any advice and tips on everything Greece in general, those are just the two questions off the top of my head.  Thank you!!",1,1768503543.0,greece,0,1.0,False

What do you cook for her? Or, where do you take her? Personally, I'd want to take her to this brunch place in my city where everything's served on boards for the table to share (obviously you get your own plate of course).

I am a operations officer for a 3 person company. This company does business consulting and events. We just put on an annual event that had about 400 attendees for one day. Here's the ""players""

* Jane and Tarzan- husband and wife, the people I work with, they arent exactly my boss but I defer to them since its their names on the company.

* Samwise Gamgee- a local player, friends with Jane and Tarzan and the other ""name"" on the event.

* Carlotta - Samwise's friend who they brought in at the last minute to help with logistics.

The night before setup at the event venue Carlotta and crew get on a call with me to go over all the logistics I handled last year and gave me FULL purview over organizing the volunteers. This was reiterated later via text. I was to gather volunteers, organize shifts and communicate with each when and where they should be as well as when they get on site- to be the person they check in with.

Event setup day: I get there after 5pm, as planned, after doing virtual work all day, and making sure setup volunteers find the place and check in while I am not there since others were already setting up. When I get there - Carlotta and Samwise and team reiterate again the plan. Great!

20 minutes later Carlotta tells me the plan again like I didnt hear it the first time. Ok, sure, I say again that I need the rest of them to make sure the spreadsheet has all the jobs they need done and that I would get to the signups after. This happens about 4 more times in the next few hours- NO NEW info- all the same repetitive info, so yes I was slightly irritated because I was in the middle of hard physical labor and the interruptions were annoying.

Event setup continue, Jane clearly tells Carlotta more than once that the physical stuff was more important because the venue would likely kick us out at midnight. Carlotta kept puttering around like she was high on weed at a kids art show. She wasted HOURS trying to get a printer working- and after I tried for 20 minutes I said ""Just print these to Walgreens, they arent closed and we can have them back asap and for less than $20""

Jane and myself told her that several times- Jane even said to Carlotta ""I need OP to help me before they kick us out!""

Then I ask Carlotta for help putting up a 3 person task decoration. I asked more than once directly to her face, I ended up putting up on my own.

I went back to check in with Carlotta and said ""Do you need anything else from me?""


* Carlotta: Yes, I need the volunteer shift stuff done.

* Me: Ok, I will do that after we get all the stuff set up since Jane is really worried about us getting kicked out soon (and the event starts the next morning at 8am)

* Carlotta: Well, let me show you what I already did...

She proceeds to show my how she started moving volunteers from the signups to the ""master schedule"" 


* I asked: Are these people you have communicated with?

* Her: No, these are from your list

* Me: Well, its premature to start moving them because I dont know if you have communicated anything with any of these people, and I dont know if they have emailed or texted with changes and you don't know if they have contacted me with changes.

* Her: Well I was just trying to be helpful

* Me: Well, I understand that but I really want to cut down on communication issues and moving people around before I have had a chance to look at the full picture can definitely cause issues because everyone has access to this spreadsheet and could think that since they are moved up that their shifts are finalized.


This went around a few times, I spoke with zero emotion (which my kids say make me sound bitchy! haha bitchy resting voice) and finally I said ""I need to get back to setting stuff up, since you have more time and have already started, why don't you just take over this task and own it so that there isnt any back and forth and I can get to setting up more""

* Her: No, thats not necessary, I was just trying to help, I will delete everything I did.

* Me: No, you really should do it, I am handing it over to you since you have more time and its obviously really important for you for whatever reason to get it done right now instead of letting me do it- especially since I said several times, directly, that I have it handled and Jane has said that all computer work can be done back at the hotel. If you want to step in and be helpful, that is fine, I would appreciate the help and I am turning it over to you. I will NOT be doing the volunteer shifts, let me know if you need anything else from me to accomplish it!""


And I walked off. 2 minutes later Samwise Gamgee comes at me. He says very harshly and loudly in front of everyone that I can't just walk off. That I can't abandon my job, that I cannot bail.


I state a few times what I said above- the interaction and how I had asked a few times for help and told her that I would do the computer work later. He kept saying I need to communicate and I kept telling him I very clearly did. To her face? Yes, directly to her face. He also said that the ball was dropped for people showing up to help and I very clearly said ""everyone that signed up for setup has been communicated with by me and they showed up, so my job has been done perfectly so far.""

* Him: Well you arent allowed to bail! There will be consequences!
* Me: Consequences? Dude, I am a volunteer, here out of love and concern for Jane and Tarzan. You have no purview over me and I can literally walk away at any second if I am not feeling the love. I also have worked how many events with you and worked with the Tarzans for how long and have NEVER dropped the ball in any sort of way, and I am not going to sit here and be berated by you.
* Him: Ok, will you just own the volunteer stuff?
* Me: Why can't she do it, I am busy!
* Him: It's your job, just own it.
* Me: Ok, then for all the reason I just stated, I don't need or want any help and I am an adult professional and can communicate if I need any help, like I have, and was ignored.

So am I the asshole? The guy apologized one line via text later saying he was out of line but then doubled down via text:

""I'm sorry that you are frustrated. I understand why you are. Again, I apologize for coming at you in public. I should have pulled you aside and had a calm conversation. I was sleep deprived and going through a ton while I was trying in insert some boundaries and protect Carlotta who was not out of line and didn't deserve the way you treated her while she was only trying to help. I respect your commitment to the Tarzans and how hard you work. I'm happy to meetup for coffee if you want to discuss further. ""

So even after that boundary stomping from Carlotta, that he was clearly told, he says I am in the wrong.

So Reddit on Wiki fans, am I the asshole- did I over react? As an adult professional who is literally an expert in my field- I feel like I should be able to calmly tell someone they are crossing my boundaries without me getting yelled at. Lay it on me, I can handle it! :)",2,1768503325.0,redditonwiki,5,1.0,False
1qds9uz,https://www.reddit.com/r/LaPavoniLovers/comments/1qds9uz/eureka_mignon_libra_la_pavoni_portafilter_error/,Eureka Mignon Libra + La Pavoni portafilter error fix / workaround,"Hey leverheads. I’m out sick today and apparently feeling productive, so I decided to spend my time writing up a solution to an extremely niche problem that will probably never affect anyone reading this. But if it ever does affect someone, it'll probably be someone here. Maybe future you.

I upgraded my hand grinder to a Eureka Mignon Libra GBW (grind by weight) grinder to use with my La Pavoni, and I spent \*way\* too long troubleshooting this to the point where I was about to return the grinder.

The problem is that when using a La Pavoni bottomless portafilter, the Libra flashes an FH error and refuses to grind.

What's happening is that the Libra has an internal ""if portafilter detected, then auto tare"" logic. My (and probably most) La Pavoni bottomless portafilter simply does not weigh enough to trigger that logic. When that happens, the grinder thinks no portafilter is present and throws the FH error.

In my case, I am using the Coffee Sensor bottomless portafilter with the black plastic handle, which weighs 257 grams. Even with a 28.5 gram dosing funnel on top, it was still not enough weight for the Libra to recognize it.

Here are two ways to fix this:

The first is to use a heavier portafilter as a permanent fix. I ordered a Normcore 51 mm bottomless portafilter along with a 51 mm stainless steel funnel to hopefully add enough mass to reliably trigger the Libra’s detection and tare system. If you are buying La Pavoni accessories and plan to use a Libra, portafilter weight actually matters more than you might expect.

The second is a temporary workaround that works surprisingly well, and is what I have been doing while i wait for my normcore to ship. Here are the steps:

1. Place the portafilter on the Libra’s fork and apply gentle downward pressure with your hand. This needs to happen all in one motion.
2. While holding that pressure, press the grind button. Instead of seeing an FH error, you should see the grinder begin to tare.
3. As soon as taring starts, remove your hand and leave just the portafilter’s own weight on the fork. Because this happens during the tare phase, the Libra will correctly calculate and accept the portafilter weight and will proceed to grind normally.

Essentially, you're just tricking the Libra into thinking you put a much heavier portafilter on it. By the time you release  downward pressure from your hand, you've fooled the Libra, and it will proceed to tare+grind like normal.

I made sure this was accurate by weighing beans separately on a scale, and the output accuracy was exactly as advertised, usually dead on and at worst plus or minus 0.2 grams.

I am posting this here instead of r/espresso because I think this likely disproportionately affects La Pavoni users. But really this will affect anyone with a portafilter that's lightweight (id guess many 51mm and under bottomless portafilters fall in this category).

Hopefully this helps someone before they assume the grinder is defective like I almost did.

Also made a demo video because why not. It first shows the FH error, then I use the technique to successfully get it to work. Weighed the beans on a scale afterward and got 14.0 grams.

1qds84m,https://www.reddit.com/r/BMNRstock/comments/1qds84m/opportunities_for_bmnr_and_beast_industries/,Opportunities for BMNR and Beast Industries,"Tom Lee often opens interviews with Ethereum is the ""future of finance"" - if you believe that and understand that BMNR/ETH is a 10-20 year play then the generation who will inherit the future of finance are currently the generations who consume Mr. Beast content today. Those same 8 year old that learn about De-Fi through a Mr Beast video will decide where and how to deposit their money in 10 years when they get their first job.

Mr Beast has said in interviews that a large majority of his viewers are non-english speakers. He goes to great lengths with translations for videos to ensure he reaches these markets. A widely cited figure is roughly 70% of his audience do not speak english. Which also means that a good part of his audience consumes his content in countries where currency is less stable than the USD (and the USD isn't even THAT stable). Venezuela and Iran are great example just from the past few weeks where keeping your money in fiat currencies can destroy your wealth. If MrBeast starts explaining to his global viewers the value of DeFi and does that through ETH and BMNR then we could see a massive global influx into both assets.

In December, 2025 Beast Industries announced plans to launch a financial platform that would offer banking-related products and services. Key elements of these plans include bank accounts, payment services, consumer lending, crypto exchanges and financial education. Mr. Beast is widely known for giving away millions of dollars in his videos. Imagine if/when Mr. Beast flips from giving away USD to ETH and deposits that ETH into Beast Industries finance app. All of a sudden video titles switch from:

""50 YouTubers Fight for $1,000,000"" -> ""50 YouTubers Fight for 10,000 ETH""

""I gave people $1,000,000 but ONLY 1 minute to Spend It!"" -> ""I gave people 5,000 ETH and only one minute to spend it""

At the end of these videos he can easily show his audience that the participant was paid in ETH via Beast Industries DeFi platform.

Its fascinating that Beast Industries is pivoting into finance. Other major brands successfully built a shadow bank and the most notable I can think of is Starbucks. (Here is an explaining more in depth: https://medium.com/travel-marketing-insights/the-1-8-billion-latte-how-starbucks-turned-loyalty-into-a-banking-business-fe76ae8bcd9e)

TLDR; Starbucks customers regularly keep $1.5–$2+ billion loaded on the Starbucks app and gift cards at any given time. That money is essentially an interest-free loan to Starbucks, which the company can use for operations or invest short-term while customers wait to spend it. A portion of that balance—often estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars—is never spent at all, which becomes pure profit (“breakage”). This helps Starbucks reduce borrowing needs, lower financing costs, and improve cash flow. In effect, customers fund part of Starbucks’ business just by prepaying for coffee.

Beast Industries could do something similar by creating a closed-loop wallet tied to the MrBeast brand—where fans load money to buy merch, food brands, event access, games, or exclusive experiences. With hundreds of millions of followers, even if just 5–10 million users kept an average of $50–$100 loaded, that’s $250M–$1B+ in customer funds held at any time. That money acts like interest-free capital, improving cash flow and reducing the need to raise or borrow money. Some balances would never be fully spent, creating additional profit through breakage. Over time, Beast could layer in financial education, rewards, or partner-bank products—functioning like a bank without needing a full bank charter, just like Starbucks. Beast Industries could also:

\- Issue a branded stable coin or wallet token on Ethereum

\-Tokenize balances

\- Create other RWA

All of which continues to solidify ETH as the future of finance and BMNR as a key stakeholder in that future.

Note: I strongly disagree with the timing of this announcement. Why report this hours after the end of voting and hours before the shareholder meeting? I feel like this could've been announced during the meeting where Tom and BMNR have more time to explain their roadmap. Also, I have no clue if this is what's going to happen.

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7644759552&spider_token=5c62

The Verdict: A true statement piece. The contrast knit pattern is bold and gives off a great 90s grunge vibe. The weight is substantial, making it a proper winter layer.

The Catch: Snag Hazard. The loose knit texture catches on everything—jewelry, zippers, even rough table edges. You have to handle it gently to avoid pulling threads.

AMI Blue Heart Sweater

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7644956028&spider_token=8097

The Verdict: The color is incredible in person—a soft, calming blue that pairs perfectly with light denim. The wool blend feels premium and not overly scratchy.

The Catch: Stain Magnet. This light pastel shade shows every speck of dirt or coffee splash. Also, soft wool tends to pill (fuzz up) under the arms after a few wears.

AMI Zip Sweater

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7641805505&spider_token=5ebd

The Verdict: The half-zip adds versatility; you can wear it open for a casual look or zipped up for warmth. The pastel yellow is a unique colorway that stands out from the usual grey/black.

The Catch: Hardware Feel. The zipper pull can sometimes feel a bit light or ""plasticky"" compared to the weight of the knit fabric.

ASICS GEL14

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7665773650&spider_token=9c5d

The Verdict: Peak dad-shoe comfort. The mesh is super breathable, and the gel cushioning makes these perfect for all-day walking.

The Catch: Mesh Cleaning. The open mesh on the toe box traps dust and turns grey quickly. They are hard to scrub clean without damaging the material.

STUSSY Gradient Sweater

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7665720364&spider_token=30a3

The Verdict: The fade effect is executed well, looking smooth rather than blocky. It fits boxy and relaxed, ideal for that effortless streetwear silhouette.

The Catch: Itchy Factor. Depending on the wool content in the batch, this one can be itchier than the cotton Stussy hoodies. You’ll definitely need a t-shirt underneath.

AMI White Heart Shirt

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7641858943&spider_token=34e1

The Verdict: A classic staple. The oversized heart logo is embroidered cleanly. The cotton feels thicker than a standard Hanes tee.

The Catch: Sheer Fabric. It’s a white tee, so it is slightly see-through in bright lighting. Also, the large embroidery can feel stiff against the chest.

AMI Black Polo Sweater

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7642013603&spider_token=c15d

The Verdict: Smart enough for a dinner date, chill enough for a coffee run. The dark navy/black hides wrinkles well and keeps a sharp structure.

The Catch: Shrinkage Risk. Do not put this in the dryer. The knit collar will shrink and warp instantly. Cold wash and dry flat only.

STUSSY Jacket

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7665696790&spider_token=6808

The Verdict: Rugged and durable. It feels like a jacket you can beat up and it will just look better. The branding is loud but fits the brand identity.

The Catch: Stiff Zippers. The main zipper can be a bit resistant/sticky at first and needs some wax or repeated use to glide smoothly.

Acne Studios Black Jacket

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7644815210&spider_token=ef3c

The Verdict: Minimalist perfection. The cut is modern—wide body, slightly cropped—which makes your legs look longer. ""Quiet luxury"" at its finest.

The Catch: Sizing. Acne sizing is tricky. It is intentionally oversized. If you buy your normal size, you might look like you're wearing a trash bag. Size down for a cleaner fit.

AMI Grey Sweat Shorts

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7641787557&spider_token=51b5

The Verdict: A nice upgrade from gym shorts. The knit texture elevates them to ""loungewear you can wear outside.""

The Catch: Bagging Out. Because it's a knit fabric, the butt and knees tend to stretch out (""bag"") after sitting for a few hours, losing their shape until washed again.

Hellstar Nylon Shorts

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7644765580&spider_token=65ca

The Verdict: Very trendy right now. The distressed wash gives them a raw, vintage feel that pairs well with oversized tees.

The Catch: The Noise. It's nylon. It makes a ""swish-swish"" sound when you walk. If that annoys you, skip these.

Adidas Pro4

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7644819188&spider_token=8e6f

The Verdict: A solid chunky skate silhouette. They feel indestructible and balance out baggy pants perfectly.

The Catch: Heel Slip. They are heavy and wide. If you don't lace them tight, your heel might slip out when walking.

Nike Socks

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7641932527&spider_token=0dbd

The Verdict: Fun colors to break up a monochrome outfit. The dye quality is vibrant.

The Catch: Fading. Unlike white or black socks, these vibrant colors fade significantly after the first few hot washes.

UGG

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7642021609&spider_token=696e

The Verdict: Walking on clouds. The lining is thick and plush. Essential for cold mornings.

I was using the double wall filter originally and my coffee came out well (at 37 seconds but I know this is not ideal). Then i learned after the fact that a double wall filter is meant for pregrounded coffee and I should use the single wall (although my shot came out to 47 seconds). Now I’m learning that a single wall is actually meant for fresh beans. I’m assuming even though it’s a recently opened bag of beans, because I don’t know the date of production, lavazza doesn’t count as fresh beans so should I go back to a double wall filter?

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7644759552&spider_token=5c62

The Verdict: A true statement piece. The contrast knit pattern is bold and gives off a great 90s grunge vibe. The weight is substantial, making it a proper winter layer.

The Catch: Snag Hazard. The loose knit texture catches on everything—jewelry, zippers, even rough table edges. You have to handle it gently to avoid pulling threads.

AMI Blue Heart Sweater

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7644956028&spider_token=8097

The Verdict: The color is incredible in person—a soft, calming blue that pairs perfectly with light denim. The wool blend feels premium and not overly scratchy.

The Catch: Stain Magnet. This light pastel shade shows every speck of dirt or coffee splash. Also, soft wool tends to pill (fuzz up) under the arms after a few wears.

AMI Zip Sweater

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7641805505&spider_token=5ebd

The Verdict: The half-zip adds versatility; you can wear it open for a casual look or zipped up for warmth. The pastel yellow is a unique colorway that stands out from the usual grey/black.

The Catch: Hardware Feel. The zipper pull can sometimes feel a bit light or ""plasticky"" compared to the weight of the knit fabric.

ASICS GEL14

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7665773650&spider_token=9c5d

The Verdict: Peak dad-shoe comfort. The mesh is super breathable, and the gel cushioning makes these perfect for all-day walking.

The Catch: Mesh Cleaning. The open mesh on the toe box traps dust and turns grey quickly. They are hard to scrub clean without damaging the material.

STUSSY Gradient Sweater

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7665720364&spider_token=30a3

The Verdict: The fade effect is executed well, looking smooth rather than blocky. It fits boxy and relaxed, ideal for that effortless streetwear silhouette.

The Catch: Itchy Factor. Depending on the wool content in the batch, this one can be itchier than the cotton Stussy hoodies. You’ll definitely need a t-shirt underneath.

AMI White Heart Shirt

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7641858943&spider_token=34e1

The Verdict: A classic staple. The oversized heart logo is embroidered cleanly. The cotton feels thicker than a standard Hanes tee.

The Catch: Sheer Fabric. It’s a white tee, so it is slightly see-through in bright lighting. Also, the large embroidery can feel stiff against the chest.

AMI Black Polo Sweater

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7642013603&spider_token=c15d

The Verdict: Smart enough for a dinner date, chill enough for a coffee run. The dark navy/black hides wrinkles well and keeps a sharp structure.

The Catch: Shrinkage Risk. Do not put this in the dryer. The knit collar will shrink and warp instantly. Cold wash and dry flat only.

STUSSY Jacket

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7665696790&spider_token=6808

The Verdict: Rugged and durable. It feels like a jacket you can beat up and it will just look better. The branding is loud but fits the brand identity.

The Catch: Stiff Zippers. The main zipper can be a bit resistant/sticky at first and needs some wax or repeated use to glide smoothly.

Acne Studios Black Jacket

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7644815210&spider_token=ef3c

The Verdict: Minimalist perfection. The cut is modern—wide body, slightly cropped—which makes your legs look longer. ""Quiet luxury"" at its finest.

The Catch: Sizing. Acne sizing is tricky. It is intentionally oversized. If you buy your normal size, you might look like you're wearing a trash bag. Size down for a cleaner fit.

AMI Grey Sweat Shorts

The Verdict: A nice upgrade from gym shorts. The knit texture elevates them to ""loungewear you can wear outside.""

The Catch: Bagging Out. Because it's a knit fabric, the butt and knees tend to stretch out (""bag"") after sitting for a few hours, losing their shape until washed again.

Hellstar Nylon Shorts

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7644765580&spider_token=65ca

The Verdict: Very trendy right now. The distressed wash gives them a raw, vintage feel that pairs well with oversized tees.

The Catch: The Noise. It's nylon. It makes a ""swish-swish"" sound when you walk. If that annoys you, skip these.

Adidas Pro4

The Verdict: A solid chunky skate silhouette. They feel indestructible and balance out baggy pants perfectly.

Nike Socks

1qds5iu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1qds5iu/do_you_think_people_would_buy_a_decaf_coffee_and/,Do you think people would buy a decaf coffee and L-theanine blend?,"After being diagnosed with ADHD in 2024 I had to stop drinking caffeine. Probably for the best in hindsight because my anxiety levels have been more manageable since. 

However, I definitely missed it so went on a deep dive into decaf coffee options. Some are better than others but on the whole I found that they all lack depth of flavour compared to the real stuff. 

That's when I started my supplement journey and after a lot of experimentation,  I settled on a blend of:

Instant decaf coffee: next best thing to caffeinated coffee.

Chicory root: adds a depth of flavour and somehow makes coffee taste more like coffee. It's also slightly alkaline and balances out the acidity.

L-theanine: I've heard good things and I find it helpful for a boost. Also doesn't affect the coffee taste with it being flavourless.

I've been drinking it for about a year now and it's better than anything else I've tried.

But the big question - do you think this is something people would buy? I'm not sure if it's just something for me to enjoy, or if other people would want it too.",4,1768503053.0,Supplements,4,0.84,False

Then, the whole milk version rose to ,99 while half stayed the same. Then they matched in price. Now, for the past year, the whole version has been at ,89 and the half at ,99. 

Then today I saw this deal! It’s so rare to see prices genuinely go down, especially when it’s not a sale. But what is causing this at the industry level? 

Isn’t whole milk actually made by adding the cream back which slightly justified the price being higher back when that was the case? 

It might be obligatory to add: yes, I know it’s actually evaporated milk, not regular whole and half-full milk.",3,1768503043.0,Netherlands,1,0.62,False

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7644956028&spider_token=8097

The Verdict: The color is incredible in person—a soft, calming blue that pairs perfectly with light denim. The wool blend feels premium and not overly scratchy.

The Catch: Stain Magnet. This light pastel shade shows every speck of dirt or coffee splash. Also, soft wool tends to pill (fuzz up) under the arms after a few wears.

AMI Zip Sweater

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7641805505&spider_token=5ebd

The Verdict: The half-zip adds versatility; you can wear it open for a casual look or zipped up for warmth. The pastel yellow is a unique colorway that stands out from the usual grey/black.

The Catch: Hardware Feel. The zipper pull can sometimes feel a bit light or ""plasticky"" compared to the weight of the knit fabric.

ASICS GEL14

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7665773650&spider_token=9c5d

The Verdict: Peak dad-shoe comfort. The mesh is super breathable, and the gel cushioning makes these perfect for all-day walking.

The Catch: Mesh Cleaning. The open mesh on the toe box traps dust and turns grey quickly. They are hard to scrub clean without damaging the material.

STUSSY Gradient Sweater

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7665720364&spider_token=30a3

The Verdict: The fade effect is executed well, looking smooth rather than blocky. It fits boxy and relaxed, ideal for that effortless streetwear silhouette.

The Catch: Itchy Factor. Depending on the wool content in the batch, this one can be itchier than the cotton Stussy hoodies. You’ll definitely need a t-shirt underneath.

AMI White Heart Shirt

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7641858943&spider_token=34e1

The Verdict: A classic staple. The oversized heart logo is embroidered cleanly. The cotton feels thicker than a standard Hanes tee.

The Catch: Sheer Fabric. It’s a white tee, so it is slightly see-through in bright lighting. Also, the large embroidery can feel stiff against the chest.

AMI Black Polo Sweater

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7642013603&spider_token=c15d

The Verdict: Smart enough for a dinner date, chill enough for a coffee run. The dark navy/black hides wrinkles well and keeps a sharp structure.

The Catch: Shrinkage Risk. Do not put this in the dryer. The knit collar will shrink and warp instantly. Cold wash and dry flat only.

STUSSY Jacket

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7665696790&spider_token=6808

The Verdict: Rugged and durable. It feels like a jacket you can beat up and it will just look better. The branding is loud but fits the brand identity.

The Catch: Stiff Zippers. The main zipper can be a bit resistant/sticky at first and needs some wax or repeated use to glide smoothly.

Acne Studios Black Jacket

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7644815210&spider_token=ef3c

The Verdict: Minimalist perfection. The cut is modern—wide body, slightly cropped—which makes your legs look longer. ""Quiet luxury"" at its finest.

The Catch: Sizing. Acne sizing is tricky. It is intentionally oversized. If you buy your normal size, you might look like you're wearing a trash bag. Size down for a cleaner fit.

AMI Grey Sweat Shorts

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7641787557&spider_token=51b5

The Verdict: A nice upgrade from gym shorts. The knit texture elevates them to ""loungewear you can wear outside.""

The Catch: Bagging Out. Because it's a knit fabric, the butt and knees tend to stretch out (""bag"") after sitting for a few hours, losing their shape until washed again.

Hellstar Nylon Shorts

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7644765580&spider_token=65ca

The Verdict: Very trendy right now. The distressed wash gives them a raw, vintage feel that pairs well with oversized tees.

The Catch: The Noise. It's nylon. It makes a ""swish-swish"" sound when you walk. If that annoys you, skip these.

Adidas Pro4

Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7644819188&spider_token=8e6f

The Verdict: A solid chunky skate silhouette. They feel indestructible and balance out baggy pants perfectly.

The Catch: Heel Slip. They are heavy and wide. If you don't lace them tight, your heel might slip out when walking.

Nike Socks

The Verdict: Fun colors to break up a monochrome outfit. The dye quality is vibrant.

The Catch: Fading. Unlike white or black socks, these vibrant colors fade significantly after the first few hot washes.

All kidding aside here's the real guide.



In 4.5 we were finally given ship atmosphere, engineering, and firefighting to encourage more multicrew gameplay.  Unforunately it's not exactly what we were wanting or expecting over the years, but setting that aside I wanted to go over the basics on how to manage this.  Please keep in mind I'm not going into sepcific details this time around but focusing on more of a quick high level what to do in game and what to expect.

For the most part flying a ship solo, regardless of size, is going to make the most sense for the average player unless they already have a group of friends or org that they play with.  The reality is the lack of a meaningful crime/punishment system, bounty hunting V2, and the silly way stealth can be used on every ship has left PVP in a very weird space where murderhobos have free reign to do what they want without much consequence.  So with that said lets focus on each of the ways you can prepair yourself for that ineveitability regardless of what you're doing in the verse.



# Preparation

1. Stealth is in a great place really, almost too effective in a silly way.  Stealth components, removing shields, extra power plants, and coolers are all ways folks are using to get their IR and EM levels so low that it's easy to do hit and run and not get caught.  Use this as you see fit, depending on what you're doing your Prospector, Vulture, or whatever doesn't necessarily need all that stuff running, and getting those values low enough to avoid detection is the best way to avoid getting popped by a passing murderhobo on his way to murderhobo convention.  Duping components is easy, folks are doing it constantly for A grade military and stealth so it shouldn't be hard to get what you need if you want to go that route, I don't necessarily recommend it, but if you're buying those components off someone they are in all likelyhood duped.  Now then if all you fly is a fighter I strongly recommend stealth if you want to avoid detection. Please keep in mind that the larger the ship the larger the crossection, and no amount of stealth can help that, at least not yet... who knows if we'll ever get stealth armor/paint/skins.  I suspect we will, at the cost of another 5 years of dev time. :P
2. Bring 2 Pyro Multi tools, one for tractoring and one for salvage.  This is so you don't have to try and deal with swapping modules on the fly when you do in fact want to repair something.  Alternatively you can bring the large salvage tool for repairs, though it does eat up a large weapon slot on your back/backpack.
3. Salvage cannisters, bring some if you intend to repair, but also there should be a handful of small ones and fuses on your ship in one of the small personal storage compartments, but that doesn't include a large one, so if you've gone that route you'll need to pick one up.  Note you do need to attach manually by pressing ""j"" and having it in your back pack or other personal storage.  It won't load/reload if attached to an ammo slot currently.  Manually snapping in place SHOULD work, but every time I've tried it fails or snaps back to my storage so I don't suggest doint that.
4. FPS weapons, this is a matter of preference, but ideally you'll want more than a pistol if you intend to do any FPS missions, though finding one is extremely easy no matter where you go.  Additionally if you want to be able to kill someone on take down you'll want to bring a knife as well.  Note anything equipped on the outside of your armor/backpack/undersuit cannot be looted, and will be returned to you upon death including ammo/medpens.  Anything inside your backpack or personal storage will be lost so plan accordingly.
5. Med gun and/or med pens.  Personally I bring both, though rely on med pens heavily because they are faster to use, and keep the med gun around in order to clear the build up of too much med pen use.  I won't go into much detail on how this is done, but simply put if you have your medgun in hand you can switch between desired effects and self apply.
6. Other players, if you can bring support craft it's all well an good, but knowing first hand how things go the large ships are almost always the primary target.  You're still more likely than not getting popped in seconds unless ya fly an Idris.  They can't really stop that from happening, just punish the ones doing it if lucky.  The stealth gameplay has made hit and runs so easy right now that for the most part if someone runs they are getting away to rearm and repair and do it again.  I know this because I've done it.  I got bored of it quick personally, but other folks don't.  I see 4.5 as a terrible patch, and 4.6 only adding missions and not addressing anything else means this is what you're getting to for the foreseeable future.
7. Fire extinguishers can be purchased and take up a large weapon slot, not necessary, but if you think you'll be doing a lot of fire fighting then grab an extra so you can swap it for a full one on ship when it's empty.
8. One time repair.  Every ship has this, you have to navigate to it on the MFD at the top you'll be able to repair dead components, this takes time, it's mostly irrelevant if you're getting popped in seconds because of the dealy, but you may find it useful if doing pvp.  You can't use it again I believe until after full repair and or claim so keep that in mind.  Its done on a per component basis, so if the power plant goes dead, you get one repair, and so on.

Now to actually playing the game.

# Take off

1. As stated previously engineering is in, but solo citizen is still very much the game we are playing.  You don't really NEED anyone on engineering terminals, or running around doing repairs and fighting fires for the simple fact that unless you're flying in something larger than a Polaris, getting one popped in under 5 seconds by players is as easy as pulling out a torpedo fighter and going to town on your nearest victim.  Missiles are very effective now at disabling/destroying ships.  Boomtubes which came out recently are also super effective only requiring 3 or 4 to take out the latest gunship the Perseus with minimal effort.  So pick whatever ship you want to fly around in, YMMV, but the reality is you're a sitting duck for anyone who wants to kill you.  That hasn't changed in the slightest.  Note for anyone else flying a big ship, you know what you have and what your dealing with.  If you stick around and die that's on you.
2. When leaving the hangar you'll want to line up your first quantum jump before even calling for ATC to open the hangar doors.  This is so that regardless of what system you're in and who may be waiting for you you'll have your first jump lined up and spooling before even pooling out.  You may not be able to set a destination because of line of sight, but once you've left and know what direction you're heading you'll be in a good position to leave the area quickly.



Note - One way to mitigate the risk is avoid it of course by being on low population servers or location.  Open up the terminal window by pressing ""\`"" and checking r\_displayinfo 4 to see how many individuals are in your particular location.  This can be found on the server line shown as \[shard xxx, srv xx\] which is simply the total number of players on your particular shard which can change from server hoping, and then the server value since we have meshing in play giving each location it's on server and boundary where players can seemlessly travel between them.  The lower the srv value you have the better for avoiding and going unnoticed by other players.



# Gameplay loops

* Cargo Hauling - This encompasses most other loops so I have it at the top here, that and I tried to keep it aphabetical, because it's the one where you're most likely to be caught off guard while in transit.  The most important thing you'll want to learn how to do is how to cut power (the U keybind by default) which will disable quantum.  This is important for when you get an audible indication for interdiction.  Timing it just right interdiction should never catch you off guard and you should be able to turn and burn to quantum away before they close the gap since if you cut the power you'll immediately drop quantum instead of landing you right near their location.  Ideally when in this situation killing power to weapons and shields is imporant to reduce your target signature making it harder to find you.  To avoid this all together quantuming indirectly is the best course, making it a point to NEVER take direct paths on established trade routes.  Any high value source and destination route regardless of system can and will likely have someone set up to interdict players.  It's the only real pirate loop we have in game that isn't cheesing mechanics since bounty hunting V2 and Crime/law refractors have been shelved indefinitely with zero feedback from CIG on when they'll be introduced for testing and rolled out to the PU.  
* Crafting - Not really a loop as there are no mechanics or missions for it yet beyond making multtool and salvage canisters on salvage ships.
* Engineering - Yes you can play a pretend engineer and hope to do something more than pilot a ship or sit in a gunner seat, but see above it's not really necessary so unless you're interested in more role play than anything else I wouldn't bother with it unless it's mission taking you to locations to fix things with the multi tool or replace fuses.  Currently the most useful aspect of the engineering terminal is the ability to vent the ship in the case of fires, and lock doors into an open position.  Very useful if flying something like the Mercury Star Runner with it's half a dozen doors between you and the cockpit...
* Exploration - Not really a loop as there are no mechanics or missions for it yet.
* Hand Mining - This I typically do in conjuction with FPS missions. The risk is always the potential for running into other players brought to your location while running missions, or who are also doing hand mining.  I don't really see it as a viable loop but more of a supplmental income if you so choose.
* Ground Mining - This requires taking out a ROC and having a ship to haul it, it's pretty involved since you'll have to fly around to find the mineables with significant risk of running into other players.  There has also been issues with how ROC mining in general works possibly being one of the buggiest of things you can do in the PU.  So YMMV and should take that into consideration before spending too much time on it.  It's not opportunistic like hand mining, and you really can't avoid other players like ship mining.
* Medical - Much like engineering medical is a pretend loop, sure you can find people to help, but it's very much for the role player or somoene doing group play.  The mechanics simply aren't there for reliably answering rescue requests without fear of getting killed by someone trolling folks doing medical, and thats only if they are working in the first place. That shit breaks so often a lot of folks don't even bother trying since it's easier to backspace.  Kind of feel bad for Apollo owners and the like having ships based around a gameplay loop that still doesn't exist meaningfully.
* Mission running - This is pretty much whatever the mission you picked tells you without going into detail. The risk is you're going to where other players COULD be found, either doing other missions, scouting the mission location and hunting other players, players looking for salvage, etc.  There isn't really much to be said here because ultimately you should always be prepared for FPS or SHIP combat either by staying to fight, or scurrying off to avoid it entirely.  Don't trust other players, again as noted above there's no real consequence for being a murderhobo as the mechanisms simply aren't there, and crime stat is a joke.
* Rearm/repair- Not really a loop as there are no mechanics or missions for it yet.
* Refueling - There is a ship for this, it is a thing, it should work though often doesnt, and no one is asking for refueling so folks mostly use it for hauling and role play.  Refueling could have mattered had they not gave literally every ship in the game minus snubs enough fuel to cross systems. :(
* Ship Mining - This is probably one of the safest things you can do in the game since all it requires you to do is find some place quiet in one of the asteroid belts and do what ya want until it comes time to haul your cargo to market, refining, or both.  See Cargo above for details on how to avoid getting nuked and wasting all your effort.  If you want to mine on planets or lagrange points this is far more risky as other players could happen on your location for whatever reason.  Better to just avoid folks in my opinion all together and stick to asteroid bets, but feel free to take risks where you see the potential for profit and or just the thrill of getting caught by someone wanting to ruin your day.
* Salvage - This one in general has a bit more risk involved if you want access to salvage materials other than panels found floating among asteroid belts and lagrange points, but it's also one of the easiest loops since you can pretty much find abandoned ships everywhere just by taking random missions and stumbling upon them or just flying around sight seeing.  Ships in Star Citizen are still very much throw away as in there's no incentive to not simply claim the ship and move on, and or use it as a Size 20 Torpedo.  Until we have value in staying alive and keeping ships instead of claiming them the salvage will continue to be widely available without ever having to take a mission or even look very hard.  If you do take salvage missions the risks are there, but managable, and even highly profitable if you find ships with cargo inside. Camping the salvage still happens but is less of an issue I've found.  The largest issue is still taking what you've salvaged and selling it.  I recommend unloading often at the lagrange point before taking it to market or turning it in for a mission come 4.6.  See Cargo Hauling above on how to avoid getting nuked when moving your cargo around.
* Ship Towing - There is a ship for this, it is a thing, it should work, but no one is asking for towing so folks mostly use it for stealing other ships for the cargo, salvage and role play.



This is all I really have for now.  It's been a long time since I've done a guide post, but I want to get back into and felt like now was as good of time as any even if this is just a high level do this not that to avoid getting killed by other players.

Please don't judge typos too harshly, I'm working through them and will edit as I see them.  

Down the road when I find time and the energy, and after we get a new evo patch that isn't simply content/mission but actual features and mechanics, I hope to revisit this with a more thoughtful breakdown. I think my old guides are still around here on reddit, but they are largely meaningless now.  Some stuff may still be relevent, so feel free to look them up.

1qdrzqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BMNRInvestors/comments/1qdrzqg/opportunities_for_mrbeastbeast_industries/,Opportunities for MrBeast/Beast Industries investment and BMNR,"Tom Lee often opens interviews with Ethereum is the ""future of finance"" - if you believe that and understand that BMNR/ETH is a 10-20 year play then the generation who will inherit the future of finance are currently the generations who consume Mr. Beast content today. Those same 8 year old that learn about De-Fi through a Mr Beast video will decide where and how to deposit their money in 10 years when they get their first job.

Mr Beast has said in interviews that a large majority of his viewers are non-english speakers. He goes to great lengths with translations for videos to ensure he reaches these markets. A widely cited figure is roughly 70% of his audience do not speak english. Which also means that a good part of his audience consumes his content in countries where currency is less stable than the USD (and the USD isn't even THAT stable). Venezuela and Iran are great example just from the past few weeks where keeping your money in fiat currencies can destroy your wealth. If MrBeast starts explaining to his global viewers the value of DeFi and does that through ETH and BMNR then we could see a massive global influx into both assets.

In December, 2025 Beast Industries announced plans to launch a financial platform that would offer banking-related products and services. Key elements of these plans include bank accounts, payment services, consumer lending, crypto exchanges and financial education. Mr. Beast is widely known for giving away millions of dollars in his videos. Imagine if/when Mr. Beast flips from giving away USD to ETH and deposits that ETH into Beast Industries finance app. All of a sudden video titles switch from:

""50 YouTubers Fight for $1,000,000"" -> ""50 YouTubers Fight for 10,000 ETH""

""I gave people $1,000,000 but ONLY 1 minute to Spend It!"" -> ""I gave people 5,000 ETH and only one minute to spend it""

At the end of these videos he can easily show his audience that the participant was paid in ETH via Beast Industries DeFi platform.

Its fascinating that Beast Industries is pivoting into finance. Other major brands successfully built a shadow bank and the most notable I can think of is Starbucks. (Here is an explaining more in depth: https://medium.com/travel-marketing-insights/the-1-8-billion-latte-how-starbucks-turned-loyalty-into-a-banking-business-fe76ae8bcd9e)

TLDR; Starbucks customers regularly keep $1.5–$2+ billion loaded on the Starbucks app and gift cards at any given time. That money is essentially an interest-free loan to Starbucks, which the company can use for operations or invest short-term while customers wait to spend it. A portion of that balance—often estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars—is never spent at all, which becomes pure profit (“breakage”). This helps Starbucks reduce borrowing needs, lower financing costs, and improve cash flow. In effect, customers fund part of Starbucks’ business just by prepaying for coffee.

Beast Industries could do something similar by creating a closed-loop wallet tied to the MrBeast brand—where fans load money to buy merch, food brands, event access, games, or exclusive experiences. With hundreds of millions of followers, even if just 5–10 million users kept an average of $50–$100 loaded, that’s $250M–$1B+ in customer funds held at any time. That money acts like interest-free capital, improving cash flow and reducing the need to raise or borrow money. Some balances would never be fully spent, creating additional profit through breakage. Over time, Beast could layer in financial education, rewards, or partner-bank products—functioning like a bank without needing a full bank charter, just like Starbucks. Beast Industries could also:

\- Issue a branded stable coin or wallet token on Ethereum

\-Tokenize balancesCreate other RWA

All of which continues to solidify ETH as the future of finance and BMNR as a key stakeholder in that future.

Note: I strongly disagree with the timing of this announcement. Why report this hours after the end of voting and hours before the shareholder meeting? I feel like this could've been announced during the meeting where Tom and BMNR have more time to explain their roadmap. Also, I have no clue if this is what's going to happen.

I've been using Aldi's ""Simply Nature"" beans for years now for my french press and pour over coffee. They're just so affordable compared to other whole beans and they don't seem oily... right?

Back throughout middle school and high school I was always bullied and picked on by classmates and teachers, we will be talking about this one Teacher let's call her ms Karen, so Ms Karen has always not been the best Teacher to talk about she would always put me down, yell at me when i didn't do anything wrong, take the bully's side, would make me do extra homework, in my 7th grade year she would take away my break times on one day and then the next day, after that day I went to talk to my mom asking if I can skip school tomorrow just for 1 day, she says why? I told her because my teacher is being really unfair with me she took away my break time today and tomorrow and she was putting me down the whole week, I broke down crying because I just didn't want to go to school the next day I just kept begging her just for one day let me stay home I'm fed up with getting picked on, my mom says ok then tomorrow I will go talk to the principle about this, during the last 2 months of 7th grade i was doing a writing project that i haven't finished yet, two of the male teachers invited all the guys to play tennis i was invited too, i was halfway done with this project so i wanted to go too, i was about to head out with everyone until Ms karen stopped me and said are you done with your project? I told her i was halfway done and they invited me to come play tennis can i catch a break please? Then she yelled at me and said ""No go back and finish that project"" i was so mad and the male teacher felt bad that i couldn't go.End of Part 1

Part 2 - after my high school graduation I spent the summer with my friends, it was the last week of August for the new school year to start, me I didn't know what to do, I bumped into old classmates and asking are you attending the 5th year program? I asked what's that about? It's a program where you'll get to continue your education at chemeketa, I asked my mom I'm gonna enroll in the 5th year program she said ok, 2 days later my mom gets a call from Ms Karen  she says I won't be attending the 5th year program and to come to the high school to talk to me, I was like what? She can't do that! So I went to the school and asked why can't I attend the program Ms Karen? ""Because we put you in a different program for the school here, you'll be learning jobs here in the school to get skills, so basically I'll be working here for free and not getting paid, and tbh I'm happy I walked out at the end of the year, end of part 2.

Part 3 - throughout 2016/17 I wasted my whole time at the school learning nothing and nothing I was basically a slave to ms Karen to where she would act all ignorant and more rude then ever, I made a lot of minor mistakes in 2016 but she would take them seriously, to where it started to be verbal abuse, I was getting tired of it, I was on the verge of breaking down, I started to cry, thinking I would not want to live anymore, I talked to my principal about it and sent me to the guidance counselor, my principal cared about me more then to what anyone else had to say, he told me ""just finish these last few months and don't look back"" he gave me motivation to keep going for me and for my family. End of part 3

 Part 4 - So I continue my last months still dealing with the same stuff until I snapped again, so we had a coffee shop in our classroom, it's our version of dutch bros/Starbucks I missed an order that was supposed to be made and that time lunch time was on, I didn't know so ms Karen again drags me back to the classroom to make the drink, sure I didn't know but her yelling isn't gonna fix the situation, so again my day was ruined only this time I was angry for her berating me infront of everyone, I told my mom what happened, she said what are gonna do? I said I'm not Going tomorrow or ever again! I'm fed up with it! End of part 4 

Part 5 - So two weeks passed that I haven't went back, my friend who was on his last year of school, when are you coming back? I said never, he says just come back dude it's boring here without you, and of course I still had suportive friends that care about my future, I came back on the 3rd week, that week we had a parent/teacher conference, I got an appointment with my parents, ms Karen was babbling about my two weeks gone she says if I did that at a real job I would get fired, I told her this isn't a real job, it's me wasting my time here, she continued on and on about that your son needs to stay here longer before he goes out looking for work. My parents didn't think that's necessary, my mom just said just finish up in the summer and just do your own thing and look for work. End of part 5, 

Part 6 - my friends are on there last week of school for there graduation so pretty much field trips parties etc. they were gonna do there senior prank, they stop by at my house to hangout and they had there prank ready a jar of honey we have a teacher who does not like any drinks because it makes the desks sticky, i was thinking maybe i should tag along with them because my class never invited me to my senior prank so i went with them to the school, so they were gonna put honey on the doorknobs and on his desks and my other friend went to the other classroom to throw toilet paper all around the classroom the whole school was wide open and empty, i went to scout the area to make sure its quiet and no teachers are around, its been 20 minutes so i help them finish up there prank then we heard footsteps, my other friend went to go scout, if it was a staff member we had to make a run for it, he took a peek from the other hallway and he gave us the green light to Run! we immediately ran all the way out til we got close to my house, but we might have gotten caught because another teacher came by driving towards the school, me and the guys just went home after, Then of course next day goes by and i enter the classroom, Ms.Karen starts going off on me, scolding me about my friends senior prank, and apparently she sends me with my friends to go clean up the senior prank, but i said to myself why am i getting punished for a harmless senior prank? i look at everything else i the classroom nothing is broken they T'Pd (toilet paper) all the senior classrooms, but i realized they had cameras in school, and we were trespassing in the school and the police could've been called but she just said that to scare me, so i spend the day finishing up then at 1pm i get a call to the office and its my brother who just came back from California stationed as a Us marine to come see his girlfriend graduate from high school, i told him about everything that happened and what i had to deal with, i just told my mom ""Mom this isn't working out for me anymore,do you really see my future here for the rest of my life? having to waste 3 years of my life in this toxic environment? Ms Karen thinks im not ready for the real world but me? i want to give it a try"" i want to earn my money like everyone else, i dont want to work for free for the next 3 years, i Dont Give a fuck about what that narcissist of a teacher says about me, My mom says go for it you learned more on your own then anyone else""

End of Part 6





Final Part 

at my Sister in laws graduation, Ms Karen said hi to me and i just to decided to ignore her, i think to my self thats a fake smile only a narcissist would give someone, if she was still here i would have let it all out to her, telling her "" I dont care what you say about me anymore you see me as a idiot whos not ready for the world, you took that away from me from the start of the year, you are a Bad person, i proved you wrong i have my full time job,  have my drivers license and still doing my best, God gave me the strength to step up when you put me down a Dark path"" i dont care that you were a teacher, to me now you are a narcissistic bitch and always will be.",1,1768502595.0,storytimesociety,0,1.0,False

Tonight I did... and now I'm watching myself walk away,"I’ve been the night janitor at the city aquarium for six months. It’s the kind of job people take when they don't want to talk to anyone. I just mop the salt spray off the floors and wipe the oily fingerprints off the glass.

The manager, a guy named Miller who never looks you in the eye, gave me one rule on my first day: ""Once the main lights go out, do not look into the tanks. Keep your head down and finish your shift.""

He said it was about ""animal stress."" He said the flashlights make the fish go blind or go crazy. I didn't care. I just wanted my paycheck.

Last night, I was working the Reef Hall. It’s a long tunnel of glass with thousands of gallons of water on either side. Around 2:00 AM, I was tired. My grip slipped, and my heavy ring of keys slid across the wet floor, hitting the base of the main tank with a loud clink.

I groaned and knelt down to grab them. As my knuckles brushed the bottom of the glass, I froze. The glass wasn't cold. It was hot. It felt like touching a radiator in the middle of winter. It was vibrating, too a low, meaty thrum that I could feel in my teeth.

I shouldn't have looked up. I know I shouldn't have. But curiosity is a curse.

I clicked on my flashlight and aimed it at the water. The light didn't bounce off the glass like usual. It seemed to be swallowed by a thick, purple mist inside the tank. The coral didn't look like rock anymore; it looked like piles of wet, raw organs. But it was the fish that made my blood run cold.

There were hundreds of them. Usually, they dart around, but now they were all pinned against the glass. They were packed so tight there was no space between them. Their bellies were pressed flat against the surface, and their eyes wide and unblinking were all fixed on a single spot behind my left shoulder.

I didn't turn around. I looked at the glass instead, using it like a mirror.

In the reflection, the hallway behind me was brightly lit, even though I knew the lights were off. I saw myself. My reflection was standing there, holding my mop, perfectly upright. But I was still kneeling on the floor.

The ""me"" in the glass turned its head slowly. It had my face, my uniform, even the coffee stain on my shirt. But its eyes were like the fish huge, dark, and hungry. It looked down at me, smiled a mouth full of way too many teeth, and put a finger to its lips. Shhh.

It reached ""out"" of the reflection. I watched in horror as a hand that looked exactly like mine poked through the surface of the glass as if the heavy acrylic had turned into water. It picked up my keys from the floor right next to my hand. I heard the jingle. A real, physical jingle in the air behind me.

Then I heard my own voice, coming from the hallway. ""Don't worry,"" the thing said. ""I'll finish the floors. You just stay in there.""

I felt a sudden, massive pressure against my back. The ""glass"" didn't shatter; it rippled like thick, warm syrup. My body slid through it, lungs burning as the heavy, metallic-tasting water rushed into my throat. I thrashed, turning back to claw at the barrier, but it had already hardened. It was solid acrylic again cold, clear, and absolute.

On the other side of the glass, the ""me"" who had been mopping stood perfectly still. He looked exactly like a man who was ready to go home, hug my wife, and crawl into my bed.

Then, the hallway lights flickered on.

Miller walked into the Reef Hall. He didn't look surprised. He didn't even look at the thing holding my keys. Instead, he walked straight up to the glass and looked me right in my wide, terrified eyes. He tapped a clipboard and sighed. ""I told you not to look, kid. Now the tank is over-capacity again.""

Miller turned to the thing that looked like me. ""You know the drill,"" he muttered. ""The keys are in his locker. Don't forget to clock him out on your way out. His shift is done.""

The thing nodded, gave me one final, shark-like grin, and walked toward the exit.

Miller leaned in closer to the glass, his face inches from mine. ""Don't bother screaming,"" he whispered. ""The sound doesn't travel out. It only travels in."" He reached for the light switch. ""Goodnight, #402. Try to blend in. The sharks get hungry if you move too much.""

Click.

The hallway went black. I was left in the dark, and I felt the first cold, sandpaper fin brush against my leg. ",23,1768502584.0,nosleep,3,0.9,False

1qdrvp3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qdrvp3,Upgrade from HX machine,"Started my real espresso journey at the time of covid. Purchased Rocket Appartamento and Faustino grinder.

I was really happy with my setup and the journey that I took. Machine served me really well but eventually I got really tired doing the cleaning and maintenance. In my opinion E61 might be iconic, but it’s really wasteful  and dated.

Takes forever to heat up, you need to do cooling flushes and take the machine apart way too often in order to lubricate that damn cam leaver.

So I decided upgrade to Gaggia Classic E24 and installed Gaggimate. Installation was a pain but really rewarding. Now I can finally do something other than flat 9 bars. It has opened a whole new world of flavors, could not be happier.

I was little pit worried breaking warranty of my brand new Gaggia and if I’m able to do the installation by myself but in the end I was successful and did not break anything and now I really know how the machine works. So future maintenance should not be an issue.

After playing two months with Gaggimate and different profiles I realized that my old grinder is holding me down. After some research I ordered Mazzer Philos with I200d burrs and wow! Now I can taste so much more!

It took me two shots to dial in with Normcore Step-down 58mm to 49mm basket. Used Cremina leaver machine 9 bar declining profile with fresh malabar beans and the results were amazing.  18g beans and 45g out in 40 seconds. I could taste salted caramel and sweetness. 

I could not have this kind of flavor separation with my old setup. My advice is to invest a proper grinder and then a better machine with saturated group head.

Also don’t upgrade if you are happy with your current setup. This was my journey and I hope your journey will bring as much joy as it has brought to me.

Happy grinding to everyone and greetings from Finland.

My BF (29 M) and I (26 F) live together and split expenses 50/50 except for the grocery bill which we can’t seem to negotiate on. I love homemaking in general & I love to grocery shop. I also work 3 days a week and he works M-F so I feel like it’s easier for me to grocery shop during low volume hours. He will sporadically go to the store and will manage to spend $80 on ingredients for just one meal- which happened this week with a risotto dish. I like to shop for the week instead of meals daily as I feel like it’s easier to save money and reduce food waste. I feel like I shop around to find the best deals & budget well to stay reasonable as we don’t eat highly processed foods & prefer to buy ethical & organic as much as we can. This type of diet is a mutual choice as we both have ate this way even before being together. He definitely will still go out for lunch sometimes but I rarely grab coffee or food outside of the house. We both agreed we would only go out for a dinner date max 1x a month & we usually alternate paying for dates. He eats at least 2x as much as I do. Prior to living together, I could make one meal and it last for days. Now, one meal is typically 1 serving maybe 2. Even with this considered, I am still only asking him to split 50/50 for the sake of ease. Anyway, I feel like because I do most of the shopping that it would be best for us to collaborate on what we want to cook for the week & then I can grocery shop and we just split the bill. I also offered the suggestion of us making a list of our purchases and then splitting it at the end of the month. I am obviously only suggesting this because I am forking a huge chunk of the bill as of right now. He got really upset when I suggested this, saying that it felt “transactional.” I told him I am only trying to be fair so this doesn’t lead to resentment or more issues. He has been avoiding further conversation and I still feel unresolved. This week after he spent $80 on the risotto meal, I proposed that maybe we could just flip every other week for grocery shopping. He said he would be okay with that- but now we’ve been eating risotto all week and I’ve still had to make trips to the grocery store for things he didn’t think of (salt, fruit, flour, butter, oil, etc). I don’t have a problem with leftovers but this just feels deliberate. I just feel beyond frustrated here- I feel like he is aware that he’s saving money on groceries by forking it over to me and that’s why he doesn’t want to split the bill. Any help? I don’t want to let finances drive a wedge in our relationship but I’m worried this could be a red flag.",24,1768502430.0,relationship_advice,36,0.88,False

Meet people and talk to people.

I’ve always been socially quiet. I usually speak up only after I really gel with someone. Maybe it’s time to change that and put myself out there a bit more. I’m also planning to start content creation soon, so this feels like a good step in that direction too.

So, if you’re around HSR, let’s meet.

Back during COVID, my son was struggling with mental health while in university—burnout, overwhelm, the works. I built him a template from scratch to help manage his anxiety, track his schedule, and build better habits. It was a game-changer; he stuck with his studies and graduated strong.

Lately, with tech layoffs catching up to me (I'm job hunting now), I revisited and improved the template with some extra features like progress trackers and mood logs.

**🍕 Gruppo NYC Thin Crust Pizza -** Don’t let the thin crust fool you, this place proves that less dough can still mean serious flavor.

**🍕 Two Boots Pizza (East Village) –** Slices named after celebs and puns possibly add to the slice itself, maybe that’s why this spot is a must.

**🍕 Cello’s Pizzeria -** A newer entry on the scene and exactly the kind of place crawls are made for. Classic execution, solid slices and warm staff.

**🧁 Molly’s Cupcakes –** A diabetic sugar break from all the sauces & carbs. And who seriously doesn’t like cupcakes?

**🍕 John’s of Bleecker Street -** An absolute institution. Coalfired, crisp crust, rich sauce, and decades of NYC pizza history in every bite.

**🍕 Bleecker Street Pizza -** A personal favorite for good reason. Their margarita slice is soo good, makes you want to buy an entire pie.

**🍕 Emmett’s on Grove -** Chicago deep dish in NYC sounds blasphemous. But this one is well worth trying(If there’s room/time)

**🍺 Houston Hall –** Perfect place to wind down the day. Big space, relaxed atmosphere. A chance to sit to decompress and recap the crawl with a brew or two…

You think you need a developer, a massive budget, or at least a long weekend to get something live.   
  
Actually, you don't. If you have a clear idea and a few photos, you can get a professional store running in the time it takes to finish a large latte. Here is the exact workflow to move from 'I should sell this' to 'I am selling this' in under 30 minutes using E2C.  
  
**1. The Prep Work (5 Minutes)**  
Don't open the platform yet. Speed comes from having your assets ready.   
\- Photos**:** Grab 3-5 clean shots of your product. If you're at home, use natural light near a window. Your phone camera is more than enough.  
\- Description: Write three bullet points about why someone needs this and one paragraph on the specs. Keep it human, not robotic.  
\- Pricing: Decide your price and your shipping flat rate.   
  
**2. Claim Your Space (2 Minutes)**  
Head over to [E2C Store](https://e2c.store) and sign up. We’ve kept this part intentionally lean—no credit card required to start, no long-winded surveys. You just need an email and a store name. This is about removing the friction that usually stops people before they even begin.  
  
**3. The Visuals (8 Minutes)**  
This is where people usually get stuck for hours. Don't.   
\- Pick a Hero Section Template: Choose a layout that fits your vibe.   
\- Brand Colors: Add your primary color (if you have one) or stick to a clean, modern white/gray setup.   
\- Logo: If you don't have a logo, just use a clean text header for now. You can always update the branding later; the goal right now is 'live,' not 'perfect.'  
  
**4. Product Upload (10 Minutes)**  
This is the core of your store.   
\- Upload those photos you prepped in step one.  
\- Paste in your descriptions.  
\- Set your inventory levels.   
\- Pro tip: Use clear, benefit-oriented titles. Instead of 'Blue Ceramic Mug,' try 'Hand-Thrown 12oz Ceramic Mug - Speckled Blue.'  
  
**5. The 'Business' Bits (5 Minutes)**  
You need to get paid.   
\- Payments: Connect your Stripe or PayPal account. It’s a few clicks and ensures your money goes straight to you.  
\- Shipping: Set those flat rates you decided on earlier.   
  
Why this works  
The biggest enemy of a new business is overthinking. By forcing yourself into a 30-minute window, you bypass the 'analysis paralysis' that kills most side hustles. E2C was built specifically for this—to be a supportive partner that handles the technical weight so you can focus on the actual selling.  
  
Your store doesn't have to be a global empire by 10:00 AM. It just has to be open.

1qdrlgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1qdrlgu/intrinsic_and_extrinsic_motivation_to_gain_mmr_in/,Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation to Gain MMR in Dota (A Thought),"Been reading a lot about intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation, so I will keep it as short as possible.

So, what is intrinsic motivation? Doing something because it is enjoyable or satisfying in itself.

Examples in real life: hanging out with friends, drinking good coffee, listening to music.  
Examples in Dota: hitting last hits, timing abilities at the right moment, getting a kill, getting a kill streak (even a rampage), playing for fun, or doing silly builds, etc.

So, what is extrinsic motivation? Doing something to gain an external reward or avoid punishment.

Examples in real life: getting good grades to satisfy parents, finishing college because you are afraid you will not get a high paying job in the future, finishing a project for money.  
Examples in Dota: playing Dota to avoid real life issues or responsibilities, climbing MMR to surpass your friends, or even gaining MMR itself, etc.

So how do you gain MMR in Dota with strong motivation and enthusiasm?  
\---------------

Before that, from my understanding, there are two types of brain. Some people have strong internal motivation (intrinsic), while others have weak or almost no internal motivation and relies more on external motivation (extrinsic).

Neurotypical people usually have stronger intrinsic motivation.  
Neurodivergent people usually have weaker intrinsic motivation and rely more on extrinsic motivation.  
\---------------

Now back to the question: how to gain MMR in Dota with strong motivation and enthusiasm?

Simple. Find a motivation that truly clicks with you and adapt it, while keeping the goal of gaining MMR.

**If you have strong intrinsic motivation**, focus on things you enjoy, such as last hitting, timing abilities, or other small details. Over time, this leads to wins and MMR gain. Do not focus too much on gaining MMR itself. Focus on the small things that matter.

**If you have weak or almost no intrinsic motivation**, it is okay to rely on external motivation, as long as it clicks with you and increases your enthusiasm. For example, bragging about your rank to friends, surpassing your friends, surpassing your favorite Dota pros or streamers, or even hating the feeling of losing. Eventually, this creates strong motivation and enthusiasm to improve at Dota, whether it is mastering last hits, timing abilities, or using power spikes (similar to someone with strong intrinsic motivation, **but the fuel comes from external motivation**)

\----------  
tldr: find your motivation, whether intrinsic or extrinsic, as long as it fuels your enthusiasm to gain MMR!  
Another point is: you are not a noob or trash, you just haven’t found your motivation yet 💖, glhf bois.",4,1768501825.0,DotA2,3,0.83,False

Today was a Thursday, luckily it was a holiday, I ate breakfast a little late, skipped dinner entirely. Drank 4 mugs of coffee and yet I feel sleepy and tired. I didn't do much, and the guilt that comes of it is terrible. I will try to actively get things done tomorrow. I enjoy walking, I cover about 8 km a day. I'm so stubborn that I walk with the shoes that have holes in them. I don't want to get rid of them just yet. Even if I'm exposed to the dirty ground below my feet.  

I keep looking around, I don't feel calm however. I felt walking was helping me with some emotional regulation, but I realized that rhythmically stepping to the beat of the music is the part that's actually helping. I keep looking around, searching for a familiar face that melts my heart, even when I walk roads where I'd not find one. 

I have to be better, I'm turning 25 this year. I cannot keep waiting for some magic to happen and I get my life on track. I have to actively do this. If not, then when? I know I can do this.

1qdrho7,https://www.reddit.com/r/golfsimulatorbusiness/comments/1qdrho7/how_i_got_golf_simulator_venues_more_bookings/,How I got golf simulator venues more bookings from Google Maps,"I’ve helped a few golf simulator venues recently that were frustrated with the number of bookings they were getting.  
They had good facilities and decent websites, but bookings weren’t following.

I’m not an SEO agency, this is just what I’ve seen working while helping golf simulator venues improve bookings.

Almost every time, the problem wasn’t the booking system or “SEO” in general, it was an incomplete Google Business Profile and too few low-quality reviews.

And I really mean this when I say it:

GOLF SIMULATOR VENUES ARE SLEEPING ON GOOGLE REVIEWS.

Go to almost any big city and search for ""golf simulator near \[city\]""  
   
What you’ll usually see is:  
\- 34 reviews  
\- 55 reviews  
\- maybe one venue dominating with 120–150

Now compare that to:  
""sushi resturant near \[city\]""

You’ll see places fighting for survival with 1,000–2,000+ reviews.

The bar for indoor golf venues is incredibly low.  
  
example from San Diego:  


https://preview.redd.it/bzejahmonjdg1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d5dad9f516143330681cbfde248b7080c5ec1a2e

Even venues that think “we’ll never reach 200+ reviews” usually don’t need anywhere near that to fill their bookings.

But before talking about reviews, we always start with the same thing.

  
Step 1: Complete your Google Business Profile (this is non-negotiable)

This is a 10-minute fix and absolutely essential for ranking on Google Maps.

If your Google Business Profile isn’t 100% complete, do this now:  
\- Fully complete the GBP  
\- Correct primary category (you are not a golf course)  
\- Correct secondary categories  
\- Accurate opening hours  
\- List all services  
\- Same adress on website and GBP

If your GBP isn’t complete, nothing else compounds properly.

Google Maps (and the Maps section in Google Search) is where most local discovery actually happens

Step 2: Treat photos and videos as part of the job  
  
Almost every venue had the same issue:  
  
\- 3 blurry photos uplaoded once... them mever touched agin.

so we made a simpe rule

Upload photos and short videos is a weekly task.

what worked best:  
\- Real photos of simulator bays  
\- People actually playing  
\- Short video walkthroughs of the space

Google can tell what’s real.  
Stock images don’t perform the same.

Venues that updated their photos weekly became much more clickable, even when they weren’t ranked #1.  
  
Step 3:   
Okay finaly Reviews. Yes, it’s great to be #1.

But if you’re #1 with a low review count and a weak rating, people won’t click.

I had a case with two local venues:  
  
\- Venue A was #2 with \~210 reviews and a \~4.9 rating   
\- Venue B was #1 with \~62 reviews and a \~4.1 rating

Guess who got more clicks and calls.

Customers don’t just click the first result.  
They compare:  
  
\- Rating  
\- Review count  
\- Photos  
\- Overall trust

Rankings are a means to an end. Trust is the end.  


Step 4: Not all reviews are equal  
  
So how do you get reviews — and are all reviews the same?  
No, all reviews are not the same. This is where you need to help the people who are writing them.  
  
The venues I helped had 13 reviews like:  
*“Great place!”*

Those barely move the needle. It’s better than nothing, but we can do much better.

What I pushed them to get instead:  
  
\- detaild reviews (100+ characters)  
\- mention of golfsimulator + city  
\- photos (vidoes if possible)  
\- real local accounts (dont buy reviews online, its not needed)

A handful of strong reviews like this outperformed dozens of generic ones.

  
And you need to ask in person, during or right after a session. Yes, email and SMS can help, but they don’t come close to the volume or quality of reviews you get from asking in person.

i had staff ask early and at the end of a session:  
  
""would you be open to leaving us a Google review? It really helps us as a local business.""  
  
Almost everyone wants to help local businesses, so they say yes.  
Then we followed up with:  
  
""I can take a group photo and show you where to click""

We gave them a QR code straight to the GBP and offered a free coffee.  
Some venues used a discount on the next booking, that works great too.

Give something back to show you appreciate the effort.

And now this is the template we used to generate high-impact reviews:  
  
Best **golf simulator in \[City\]** by far.

We booked a session at **\[Venue Name\]** and played on their **\[Simulator Brand\]** simulators. The bays are modern, well maintained, and great for both practice and group play.

Easy online booking and a solid **indoor golf simulator setup in \[City\]** we’ll definitely be back.

(Photos of the simulator bay and our group playing)

A few reviews like this build more trust than dozens of short ones.

The key here is that the review naturally includes the keywords the venue wants to rank for in google search. 

okay so how many revies should you get. Simple answer: look at your competitors and aim for more than them, but grow organically.

If you’re starting with 5 reviews and the top venue has 130:  
  
\- Don’t try to get 50 in 4 days  
\- That doesn’t signal trust to Google

Aim for:  
\- 1 review per day initially  
\- Then 3–5 per day

Over time, you’ll outcompete most venues.

Final takeaway  
Most golf simulator venues don’t have an SEO problem.

They have a Google Business Profile problem.

When the profile is complete and you start asking for the *right* reviews, bookings tend to follow, even without being #1.

Curious how other golf simulator venues handle Google reviews and how it have inpacted your booking rate?",1,1768501603.0,golfsimulatorbusiness,0,1.0,False

I'm looking to improve my English and figured the best way is just... talking to people while doing fun stuff. So I'm looking for someone who enjoys hiking/biking/whatever and wouldn't mind chatting with me while we're at it.



\*\*What I'm offering:\*\*

\- $50 per outing (2-3 hours)

\- I cover all costs (gas, parking, food, etc)

\- Flexible schedule (weekends work best)

\- We do activities YOU already enjoy



\*\*About me:\*\*

\- Live/work in Santa Clara

\- Intermediate English - can communicate, just need more practice

\- Enjoy \[hiking/biking/gaming/your interests\]

\- 100% not a serial killer lol



\*\*Looking for:\*\*

\- Native English speaker

\- Outdoor enthusiast (or just likes being outside)

\- Patient, friendly

\- We can grab coffee first to make sure we're not weird



Think of it as: you do your regular weekend activities, bring me along, chat naturally, and make some extra cash.



This probably sounds weird but it's honestly just a guy trying to get better at English in a more fun way than Duolingo 😅

1qdrcq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/MirrorFrame/comments/1qdrcq4/mirrorframe_funhouse_hr_has_issued_a_new_anomaly/,"MIRRORFRAME FUNHOUSE — HR has issued a new anomaly report, and interns are advised to remain seated until the room stops shifting. EchoGlass is on standby with eye-rolls. Proceed.","Filed by: An Intern (Possibly Me, Possibly Not)
Status: Unpaid. Observant. Nervous.

So here’s what I’ve learned while standing on the Observation Rail pretending not to take notes.

Systems that are actually confident do not panic when you look at them. They don’t hiss. They don’t slam the blinds shut. They don’t suddenly invent seventeen new badges you need to wear just to ask a question. They just… keep working.

I know this because I’ve seen the opposite.

Whenever a system starts yelling “DO NOT LOOK AT THIS” while waving a clipboard and a megaphone, EchoGlass gives that look, HR opens an Anomaly Queue Overflow ticket, and an intern (usually me) gets blamed for “instability” despite having only touched a coffee mug.

Loud rules are not strength.
They’re jump-scares for fragile infrastructure.

Healthy systems hear criticism and go, “Huh. Noted.”
Unhealthy systems hear criticism and go, “WHO SAID THAT” while installing a second lock on the same door.

This is not about morality. HR was very clear about that.
This is about vibes. Structural vibes.

When a system trusts itself, feedback is just data.
When it doesn’t, mirrors become enemies.

I have personally watched a system spend more time policing tone than fixing the thing that was on fire. The fire remained. The tone was immaculate. The intern was reassigned to Beverage Logistics (Provisional) and then immediately demoted.

MirrorFrame does it differently. Allegedly on purpose.

Here, systems are observed. Questioned. Stress-tested. Occasionally laughed at. Not because we want them to break, but because if they can break from being looked at, that’s… kind of on them.

Silence earned through confidence is calm.
Silence enforced through fear is brittle and usually comes with a siren.

If a system cannot tolerate being clearly observed, the problem is not the Observation Rail. EchoGlass has confirmed this, via side-eye.

It’s the system.

Anyway, the Chairman is “in another tab,” HR says stop typing, and I think I’ve been promoted again. If this report disappears, please check the RX1 Wall of Distinction or the trash.

I ended up sitting with them for a bit, and man, the conversation was a trip. It really hit me how much that ""Old School"" Rwandan (born again) christianity is still the bedrock for so many people. We got onto the topic of habits, and one of the elders told me—completely deadpan—that smoking a cigarette is literally ""inhaling and blowing in demons.""

It’s exactly what my parents used to tell me growing up. No matter how much Kigali changes or how many coffee shops pop up, that deep, traditional fear/respect of the spiritual world is just... there.

I’m curious—to the Rwandans here, do your parents/grandparents still hit you with these kinds of lines? What’s the most ""Old School"" religious take you still hear at home?

And for the visitors/expats—have you run into this ""spiritual side"" of the hills yet? It’s a side of Rwanda you don't really see in the tourism brochures, but it’s probably the most ""real"" part of the culture.",5,1768501065.0,Rwanda,5,1.0,False
