On the way to a convince store, I just saw a door in the woods. No houses, no structure, just a plain, white door; propped up with just two small wooden beams on either side. Just standing there in a half woodsy area by the roads. And it was really early in the morning that it was still dark out, so seeing that in the dark was extra creepy. It wasn’t beat-up or dirty at all. A pristine, white door just standing neatly.

  
It's been there for a few days now, maybe a week, even, and it's still there. Is there any explanation for this?? ",2,1760781972.0,strange,1,1.0,False

1o9rx9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/analyzeme/comments/1o9rx9d/a_recent_visit_to_ihop/,A recent visit to IHOP,"There is an International House of Pancakes (IHOP) franchise right down the road from me. The place is managed exquisitely: the food is always nicely prepared, the ambience is friendly, and the wait staff are superb.

The reason I enjoy IHOP is that it reminds me of a place -- called Woolworths -- that my family and I used to go to when I was a little boy back in the 1960s.  Woolworths was a five-and-dime type operation, and they had a little café area.

We did not have much money when I was a kid, so the highlight of our week was to get dressed up and go to Woolworths on a Sunday morning and get the one dollar breakfast special.  

I remember being able to order a scrambled egg, and two pieces of toast, and that came with a glass of water.  And I could get all of that for one dollar.

We were not allowed to go over one dollar -- not even five cents over -- so if I wanted something like an extra piece of toast, that was forbidden.

But even though I never left the Woolworths feeling like my tummy was full, I do remember that I had a good time with my family sitting around the table, talking to one another, seeing my parents interact and communicate, hearing my father tell ridiculous stories, and watching my mother laugh so hard that she had sometimes could hardly catch her breath.  

___

Anyway, these days I can go to IHOP, and I can order anything I want from the menu, so I feel like I'm really living it up.  

(I go only about once every few weeks, because I'm trying not to die prematurely.)
___

I was at the local IHOP a few days ago, and I was sitting in a booth, enjoying an omelette.

A young family walked in and were seated in the booth at a slight angle across the aisle from me.

Two parents, who appeared to be in their mid-to-late 30s, and three children, two kids who appeared to be seven and nine years old, and a toddler, about 16 months.

Everyone promptly sat down, and -- almost robotically -- put their smartphones on the table in front of them.  As if they had done that a thousand times.

The toddler (a little girl) sat at a highchair at the end of the table.  

I confess that I was relieved to see that the toddler had a piece of paper and some crayons to play with (as opposed to a tablet).

Anyway, the waitress came, and after looking at the menu and ordering, all four of the older people promptly became immersed in their phones.

There was no communication, no talking, no eye contact of any kind.

The table was silent.

The toddler was a bit fidgety but seemed interested in her crayons and paper.
___

Things were fine at the table across the aisle for about 20 seconds or so.

And then, all at once, the toddler sat still, motionless, looked around at the table for a good 10 seconds where her family was sitting, and then suddenly and with a little shriek threw her piece of paper on the floor in that cute and awkward little way that toddlers throw things.

She might have been feeling fussy or somewhat naughty.

* But given the circumstances, and given what I assessed was the *calculated nature* of her action (she appeared for all the world to have come to certain conclusions about the four members of her family who were sitting across from her, ignoring her, and ignoring each other) I *assumed* that she was protesting the fact that *no one was looking at her, acknowledging her existence, treating her like a human being with thoughts and feelings.*

Anyway, I continued to observe the scene at the table across the aisle, and very soon, the little girl started to fuss.

* She banged her little hands on the highchair table, and said some unintelligible things in a rather high-pitched voice.
* And the four members of her family continued to stare at their phones, as though she did not exist.

The four of them appeared to be in a trance of some sort... and of course, this was not the first time I had seen a family sit down together at a restaurant and lose themselves in their handheld portals of fantasy and escape in order to avoid the emotional and psychological challenges that come along with interacting directly with other family members.

But this was a bit different, because they had a tiny little child at the end of the table who was clearly seeking some sort of acknowledgment.

And she was being treated as though she was a non-human object, like a coffee table, or a chair.
___

Having once been a small child myself, and remembering that I too had often been ignored by my parents because they were too busy or preoccupied with things that were important to them -- and having spent some years in psychotherapy to undo the damage to my own psyche that resulted from my own childhood -- I took the liberty of gently catching the Mom's attention, and indicating to her in a friendly and unassuming way that her daughter had thrown her piece of paper on the floor.

The mom was very responsive, and quickly picked up the piece of paper and put it back on the highchair table.  She momentarily consoled her daughter, and sat back at the table.

And once again was completely lost in her smart phone.
___

Fortunately for me, I was finishing up, and soon the check arrived, and I paid.

And I recalled memories of my own marriage, and the handful of times when my ex-wife attempted to spend time together with me and my two kids as a family.  And I remembered, with some pain in my heart, [how my ex-wife was unable to be a member of our family](https://www.reddit.com/r/analyzeme/comments/1o6b71e/my_experience_as_a_parent_part_i/), because when she herself was a little girl, she was treated as though *she* was a non-human object. 

And I decided to leave a little earlier than I normally would, because I couldn't bear to witness any more of the spectacle at the table across the aisle from me.

1o9rwlr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ranvooofficial/comments/1o9rwlr/psa_how_i_finally_fixed_my_sensitive_teeth_and/,PSA: How I finally fixed my sensitive teeth and stopped my gums from bleeding?Game changer!,"Tooth Sensitivity

Causes:
The most fundamental reason is the exposure of dentin. There are countless tiny tubules in dentin that directly connect to the dental nerve.

How to Solve:
Use anti-sensitive toothpaste: Containing ingredients such as potassium nitrate and stannous chloride, it can block the dentinal tubules and isolate stimuli.

Professional treatment: Dentists can use desensitizers, fluoride varnish, or perform dental fillings, crown restorations, gum surgeries, etc. according to the situation.

How to Prevent:
Use a soft - bristled toothbrush and adopt the Bass brushing method to avoid violent horizontal brushing.
Reduce the intake of acidic food and drink. Do not brush your teeth immediately after eating acidic food; rinse your mouth with clean water first.
If you have a problem with night teeth grinding, wear a mouth guard.
Have regular teeth cleaning to prevent gum recession caused by periodontal disease.

How AirJet II Solves: 
It is recommended to use the gentle mode. Through the bubble cleaning technology, it can effectively prevent enamel wear and gum recession caused by excessive brushing force.

Gum Bleeding

Causes:
In the vast majority of cases, it is caused by gingivitis. Dental plaque and calculus accumulate at the gum margin, causing inflammation of the gum tissue, congestion and swelling, and capillary fragility. Slight stimulation (such as brushing teeth) can cause bleeding.
In a few cases, it may be related to blood diseases, vitamin deficiencies, etc.

How to Solve:
Brush teeth correctly and gently: The bleeding area should be cleaned carefully but gently to remove the stimulus (dental plaque), and the bleeding will stop after the inflammation subsides.
Use dental floss/interdental brushes: Clean the interdental areas that the toothbrush cannot reach.
Professional teeth cleaning: Removing stubborn calculus is the key to curing gingivitis.

How to Prevent:
Persist in effectively removing dental plaque every day (correct tooth brushing + cleaning interdental spaces).
Regular teeth cleaning (once every six months to one year).

How AirJet II Solves:
Remove dental plaque more efficiently: It is recommended to use the whitening mode. The high - frequency vibration can effectively disintegrate the plaque near the gingival sulcus and reduce inflammation from the source.
Improve cleaning habits: Many people cannot clean their teeth properly due to incorrect and inefficient manual brushing methods. Ruiwu electric toothbrush uses bubble cleaning technology to more easily clean hard - to - reach areas.

Dental Calculus

Causes:
Dental plaque in the mouth combines with minerals (calcium, phosphorus) in saliva and gradually calcifies and hardens to form dental calculus.
Process: Food residue → Dental plaque (soft tartar) → Dental calculus (hard tartar). The formation time is generally about 12 days.

How to Solve:
Professional teeth cleaning: Once dental calculus forms, it cannot be removed by daily tooth brushing and must be shattered and cleaned by dentists with professional instruments (such as ultrasonic scalers).

How to Prevent:
Eliminate from the source: Efficiently and thoroughly remove dental plaque to prevent it from having the opportunity to calcify.

How AirJet II Solves:
Through the whitening mode of AirJet II bubble toothbrush and the cleaning efficiency of high - frequency vibration, it significantly reduces the quantity and accumulation speed of dental plaque, thereby fundamentally delaying the formation of dental calculus.

Tooth Discoloration and Yellowing

Causes:
Extrinsic staining: Pigments from coffee, tea, red wine, soy sauce, smoking, etc. adhere to the tooth surface.
Intrinsic staining: Tetracycline teeth, fluorosis teeth, etc., or as people age, tooth enamel wears thin, exposing the yellowish dentin inside.

How to Solve:
Extrinsic: Teeth cleaning, polishing; home/clinic whitening (tooth strips, cold light whitening, etc.).
Intrinsic: Clinic whitening, veneers, crown restoration.

How to Prevent:
Reduce the intake of easily staining foods or using a straw.
Brush teeth after meals to thoroughly clean pigments on the tooth surface.

How AirJet II Solves : 
Using the bubble technology of AirJet II to remove surface dirt and deeply clean interdental spaces helps teeth restore their original luster and color, making you feel that your teeth are cleaner and more lustrous.",1,1760781902.0,ranvooofficial,0,1.0,False

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me.  I am a very genuine person please don’t be shy to message me! 

I am an English guy from the south of England originally 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents I really don’t mind where you are located don’t let the distance put you off 

If you only want to be friends then that’s fine with me too send me a message also I really don’t mind I’d prefer to be friends with women again aged 25-32 that would be great too! 

I’d also like to hear from Asian women too! 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it’s not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents I really don’t mind where you are located don’t let the distance put you off 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it’s not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery

I’ve been using Modafinil (100–200mg) for a while, but I feel like I still don’t fully understand how to make it work at its best.

I’m curious to hear how you all take it for optimal effect — things like:
	•	What time do you usually take it? (right after waking up? before breakfast?)
	•	Do you take it on an empty stomach or after food?
	•	Does eating certain things (fat, carbs, protein, coffee, etc.) make a difference in how strong or long it lasts?
	•	Have you tried splitting the dose (e.g., 100mg in the morning and 50–100mg later)? Did that help or mess with your sleep?
	•	And finally, any tips to avoid the afternoon “crash” or the insomnia at night?

I’m mainly using it to fight persistent daytime sleepiness, but I’d really like to understand how to keep its effect steady and smooth throughout the day.",1,1760781655.0,idiopathichypersomnia,0,1.0,False

1o9rrfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueskySocial/comments/1o9rrfc/i_think_we_need_to_talk_about_whats_happening_to/,I think we need to talk about what's happening to Bluesky,"I've been on Bluesky for a year now. Indie dev, gamer, trying to build something that matters. And honestly? I'm exhausted.

The numbers don't lie. Over the last 4 weeks, daily active users are down 6.8%. Daily posters? Down 5.1%. Posts themselves? Down 6.3%. Likes are down 10.1%. The people actually engaging? Down 7.4%. New follows? Down 14.2%.

This isn't just ""platform stabilization after the migration wave."" This is a slow bleed.

And here's what kills me: I know my content isn't bad. I pour hours into every post, every update about what I'm building, every attempt to connect with people who might care. But on Bluesky, if you're not posting at the exact right time, if you miss a day because life happens, if you're not chronically online... you just vanish. The chronological feed is merciless. There's no algorithm to save you, no second chance for a good post to find its audience later.

I started tracking my own metrics obsessively. Posting at 9 AM vs 2 PM could mean the difference between 50 impressions and 5. I was setting alarms. Sacrificing sleep. Feeling guilty every time I couldn't post because I was, you know, actually working on the things I was trying to promote.

The worst part? Looking at my follower count grow slowly while my actual engagement craters. People follow, then never see your stuff again because you're buried under 47 other posts in the time it took them to get coffee.

**Full transparency: I got so frustrated that I built my own solution.**

And before you roll your eyes—no, this isn't going to make you famous overnight. It's not some magic engagement bot. It won't game the algorithm because, well, there is no algorithm to game.

But here's what it did for me: it took away the anxiety.

I can schedule my posts now (with images, videos, everything), so I'm not chained to my phone at ""optimal posting times."" I can plan my week on Sunday evening and actually focus on creating during the week. The analytics actually help me understand what works without drowning in spreadsheets. And there are some features for managing my community that honestly just made me fall back in love with being on Bluesky instead of dreading it.

It's not going to 10x your followers. What it does is let you stay consistent without burning out. And weirdly? That consistency—that ability to actually enjoy posting again instead of treating it like a second job—that's when things started to shift for me. Not in some explosive way, but in a ""hey, I'm actually building something real here"" way.

The whole thing is free. Like, actually free—99% of features cost nothing. I put a $1/month tier in there for people who want to support the project, but that's it. I'm not trying to get rich here. I built this because I needed it, and I'm sharing it because I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one feeling this way.

If you're an artist watching your work disappear into the void, a game dev trying to build a community for your project, or just someone who's tired of the hamster wheel of ""optimal posting times""—I'll drop the link in the comments. Don't want to spam the sub, but if you're feeling the same burnout, maybe it helps.

1o9rpgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_PiyushSEO06_Red/comments/1o9rpgh/why_gen_z_prefers_hangout_cafés_over_nightclubs/,Why Gen Z Prefers Hangout Cafés Over Nightclubs,"The hangout culture among young people has undergone a major shift in the past few years. Unlike millennials who often chose loud and flashy nightclubs for socializing, **Gen Z** prefers cozy, creative, and tech-driven spaces like cafés and lounges. In metropolitan cities, this trend is most visible in the rise of themed and tech-focused cafés such as a [gaming café in Delhi](https://bunknbites.com), where entertainment meets comfort. These new-age hangout hubs are redefining how Gen Z connects, relaxes, and spends time with friends — and they perfectly reflect the generation’s evolving lifestyle and mindset.

Here’s why Gen Z is choosing hangout cafés over nightclubs:

https://preview.redd.it/935sqrmaeuvf1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0a8373fc3a7192571bceb889319a27997c85143

  


# 1. Comfort Over Chaos

Gen Z thrives in spaces where they can express themselves freely without the pressure of a loud or overly crowded atmosphere. Hangout cafés offer a relaxed environment — comfortable seating, ambient lighting, and chill music — compared to the chaos of a nightclub. This generation values **comfort and connection** over noise and nightlife glamour.

  


# 2. Affordable and Accessible

While nightclubs often come with hefty entry fees, expensive drinks, and strict dress codes, cafés are **budget-friendly and easily accessible**. For students and young professionals, hanging out at a café with friends feels more natural and affordable. From ordering a cup of coffee to spending hours gaming or brainstorming, cafés cater perfectly to Gen Z’s casual lifestyle.

  


# 3. Safe and Inclusive Spaces

Safety and inclusivity are key factors for Gen Z. Hangout cafés provide a **secure, welcoming environment** for everyone, regardless of gender, background, or personality. Many modern cafés — especially gaming cafés — are supervised spaces that promote mutual respect and positivity, unlike some nightclub environments that can feel intimidating or unsafe for younger audiences.

  


# 4. Tech Meets Social Life

This is a generation that grew up with technology, and their hangout choices reflect that. Spaces like **BunknBites**, a popular **gaming café in Delhi**, blend technology with social experiences — offering high-end gaming PCs, VR setups, and multiplayer arenas where friends can play, bond, and create memories. Gen Z doesn’t just want to socialize — they want **interactive entertainment**, and cafés provide exactly that.

  


# 5. Creative and Instagrammable Vibes

Gen Z lives in a visual world powered by Instagram, Snapchat, and Reels. Hangout cafés often feature **aesthetic interiors, themed corners, and photogenic setups** that make them perfect for social media content. Whether it’s a latte art photo, a gaming clip, or a café selfie, these spaces are built to be shareable — something nightclubs rarely offer in daylight clarity.

  


# 6. Meaningful Conversations and Real Connections

Unlike the loud and high-energy atmosphere of nightclubs, cafés allow for **deeper conversations and genuine connections**. Gen Z values emotional bonding and shared experiences. Whether it’s gaming together, collaborating on creative ideas, or just talking about life over coffee, cafés support more meaningful social interactions.

  


# 7. Flexible and Multi-Purpose Spaces

Hangout cafés are versatile. They can serve as workstations during the day, gaming zones in the evening, or chill spots on weekends. This flexibility perfectly suits Gen Z’s **dynamic and hybrid lifestyle**, where socializing, working, and relaxing often overlap.

  


# 8. A Healthier and Happier Choice

Nightclubs are often associated with alcohol, late nights, and sensory overload — things Gen Z is increasingly moving away from. They prefer **healthier, more balanced leisure options**. Cafés with fresh food, mocktails, and entertainment options like gaming or board games create a lively yet wholesome atmosphere that feels good both mentally and physically.

  
**9. Community and Belonging**

Many cafés host events, tournaments, and open-mic nights that foster community and inclusivity. Gen Z craves belonging, and cafés like BunknBites provide that sense of **tribe and connection**. Whether it’s a gaming event or a creative meetup, these spaces bring like-minded people together in positive ways.

  
**In conclusion**, the reason **Gen Z prefers hangout cafés over nightclubs** goes beyond trends — it’s about comfort, creativity, and connection. They’re drawn to spaces that let them be authentic, enjoy interactive fun, and build meaningful relationships. Whether it’s a cozy coffee lounge or a **gaming café in Delhi** like BunknBites, these hangout spots represent the new era of socialization — one where fun, safety, and friendship come first.

Then Weibo picked it up, and suddenly there were people from China doing the same thing. It’s surreal watching something grow from discipline, not hype.

I recently moved to the Waltham Forest area and am looking to meet some new people and make a few friends! It would be cool to find others in their early to mid-twenties to hang out with.

I'm based in Waltham Forest, but happy to connect with anyone in nearby spots like Chingford, Chigwell, or Waltham Abbey.

Just a heads up, I don't smoke or drink, so I'm looking for people who are happy to grab a coffee, catch a movie, try a new restaurant, explore some of the local parks, or get into some of those other non-pub activities!

If you're in the area and looking to expand your social circle, drop a comment or send me a DM!

1o9rmqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1o9rmqs/new_property_management_took_over_and_i_received/,New property management took over and I received a 10 day notice of termination for nonpayment but rent was paid to the old company for this month (U.S.),"Location: Oregon

  
I'm exhausted and don't really know what to do.

My husband, our roommate, and myself left the country for vacation from 09/20 to 10/04. In that time we had gotten a notice that property management was changing and it was posted on our front door in an envelope and also to our emails but like most people none of us saw it since we were on vacation.

An entire week after the first notice we got a second notice saying that effective that day (10/01), ""P"" property management would be the new management agent for the apartment complex. This notice was put into the same envelope.

When we had returned a few days later I brought it into the apartment but left it on the coffee table for a few days until we had settled back in because jetlag was hitting us hard (not a great excuse but I could barely concentrate on anything that wasn't unpacking and sleeping).

We finally came around to reading the notice, filled out the resident update form provided and promptly started calling the phone number provided on the notice since:

1. My husband paid the original property management (M) through the online payment portal in mid-September (Rent is due on the first and we like paying in advance so it's not a pain later if we spend on something recklessly).
2. The payment had already been removed from his bank account (we have the bank statement).
3. We were unsure how to set up a new online tenant portal for P or if they had one.
4. We had other questions that needed answered and felt it was better to just call

My husband did all the outreaching since I was still trying to unpack and separate gifts from belongings and his calls mostly went straight to voicemail. On the occasion that his call was answered he would be transferred to someone else (S) or S's assistants, both of which ended up going straight to voicemail.  
He's been calling for a few days now when he's not working and has availability but to the same results and NO return calls. He's been calling for the majority of this week (10/13-10/17).

He came home frustrated and asked me to email them so I did using the PROVIDED EMAIL from the notice we were given. All I did was inform them we were trying to contact them and to please call us back or email us, to which I provided both my and my husband's phone numbers and emails.  


Obviously, I got no response back so my husband decided to go to their website and send a message expressing our grievances. (10/16)

The person that responded (the next day 10/17) was from the bigger corporate office in a different city for P. That person assured us that they sent the email and our contact info to the local corporate office and asked the reps in the local one to reach out to us while also providing their office line's phone number (local office). This was sent midday so he was working and couldn't get to his email to check.

I end up coming home (10/17) after a long 16 hour shift to my husband calling me to tell me that we received a 10 Day notice of Termination for Nonpayment. I immediately started putting together a consult with my lawyer to see if anything can be done since this APPARENTLY isn't happening to just us.   
Somehow my husband has found himself talking to more neighbors (we've never talked to any of these people since we moved in). Apparently, at least 12 other FAMILIES have received the notice as well.

As I started gathering all this information to send for my consult my husband finds out how to set up an online portal and right now it has a balance that equals October's rent + Late fees.

I just want to know what we're supposed to do. We already paid for this month through M's online tenant payment portal (we have since had our accounts deactivated by M) and one of the notices we received from P says that our security deposit had been transferred to P as well as our original lease agreement.

I don't want for us to have to pay rent for a month that was already paid for. What should we do?

1o9rhdp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_johnsmithmath89/comments/1o9rhdp/choosing_coffee_for_french_press_grind_size/,"Choosing Coffee for French Press: Grind Size, Flavor, and Tips","If you’ve ever wondered why your French Press coffee doesn’t taste like the café version, you’re not alone. I used to ask myself the same question — *What’s missing?*

After a lot of research, brewing, and tasting, I learned the secret: it’s not the French Press itself, but **the kind of coffee you use** — the grind size, the flavor, and how you brew it.

In this simple guide, I’ll help you understand **how to choose the best coffee for your French Press**, with easy tips, expert advice, and even some real user stories.

Let’s get started!

# Understanding French Press Coffee

# 1.1 What Makes the French Press Special?

A French Press is one of the oldest and simplest ways to brew coffee. It doesn’t use paper filters or machines. You just add coffee grounds, pour hot water, wait, and press.

This simple process lets your coffee’s **natural oils and flavors** stay in your cup, giving it a **richer and smoother taste**.

>

# 1.2 How the French Press Works

Here’s how it happens:

1. You put coarse-ground coffee in the press.
2. You pour hot water over it.
3. The coffee steeps for about 4 minutes.
4. You push down the plunger, separating the grounds from the liquid.

The result? A **bold, aromatic cup** that’s pure and satisfying.

Unlike drip coffee makers, the French Press lets small coffee particles and oils stay in your drink — that’s what gives it that rich, creamy feel.

# 1.3 Why Coffee Choice Matters

Even if you have a top-quality French Press, your coffee won’t taste right if the **grind size**, **roast level**, or **bean quality** are off.

Think of it like cooking: even with the best pan, you can’t make a tasty meal with poor ingredients.

>

# The Perfect Grind Size for French Press

# 2.1 Why Grind Size Is So Important

When using a French Press, **grind size** decides how your coffee tastes.  
If the coffee grounds are too **fine**, your drink becomes bitter and gritty.  
If they’re too **coarse**, the coffee tastes weak and watery.

So, what’s the best grind?

👉 **Answer:** A **coarse grind** — like rough sea salt or breadcrumbs.

This grind allows water to flow evenly through the coffee, pulling out the right amount of flavor without bitterness.

# 2.2 Infographic: Ideal Grind Sizes

    +-------------------------+
    |   Grind Type   |  Use   |
    +-------------------------+
    | Extra Fine     | Espresso |
    | Fine           | Moka Pot |
    | Medium         | Drip Coffee |
    | Coarse         | French Press ✅ |
    | Extra Coarse   | Cold Brew |
    +-------------------------+
    

# 2.3 Real User Experience

I asked a few home brewers from our coffee community about their favorite grind size. Here’s what they said:

* **Rafi (Bangladesh):** “I used to grind too fine, and my coffee was always bitter. When I switched to coarse, it tasted like café coffee!”
* **Anna (U.S.):** “Grinding fresh beans coarsely just before brewing made a huge difference. Now my French Press coffee tastes smoother.”

# 2.4 Pro Tip: Grind Just Before Brewing

Always grind your beans right before brewing. According to a study by the **Specialty Coffee Association**, freshly ground coffee retains **up to 60% more aroma compounds** than pre-ground coffee.

This means your cup will smell and taste much fresher.

# Picking the Right Coffee Flavor and Roast

# 3.1 Which Coffee Beans Work Best?

The French Press brings out deep and bold flavors. That’s why **Arabica beans** are preferred over Robusta. Arabica beans have smoother, richer, and less bitter taste notes.

# 3.2 The Best Roast Levels for French Press

|Roast Type|Flavor Profile|Why It Works|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Light Roast**|Fruity, bright, more acidic|Good for mild coffee lovers|
|**Medium Roast**|Balanced, smooth, aromatic|Perfect for beginners|
|**Dark Roast**|Bold, smoky, strong body|Ideal for rich and full taste|

>

# 3.3 Popular Coffee Origins for French Press

Here are some top choices and what they taste like:

* **Colombian Coffee:** Smooth, nutty, and slightly sweet.
* **Brazilian Coffee:** Chocolatey with mild acidity.
* **Ethiopian Coffee:** Fruity and floral.
* **Sumatran Coffee:** Earthy, full-bodied, low acidity.
* **Guatemalan Coffee:** Cocoa and spice flavors.

>

# 3.4 Infographic: Flavor Chart

    +--------------------------------+
    | Origin     | Flavor Profile     |
    +--------------------------------+
    | Colombia   | Nutty, Sweet       |
    | Brazil     | Chocolate, Smooth  |
    | Ethiopia   | Fruity, Floral     |
    | Sumatra    | Earthy, Bold       |
    | Guatemala  | Cocoa, Spicy       |
    +--------------------------------+
    

# 3.5 Real User Experiences

* **Mina (UK):** “I switched from light roast to medium roast, and my French Press coffee finally tasted balanced.”
* **Hasan (Bangladesh):** “Sumatran beans are my go-to. They give me that deep, full flavor that lasts.”

# 3.6 Freshness Matters

Always check the **roast date** on the bag. The best flavor comes from coffee roasted within **2–3 weeks**. Older beans lose aroma and richness.

>

# Tips for Brewing the Perfect French Press Coffee

# 4.1 Step-by-Step Brewing Guide

**Step 1:** Add **coarse coffee grounds** (1 tablespoon per 150ml water).  
**Step 2:** Pour **hot water** (around 195–205°F or 90–96°C).  
**Step 3:** Stir gently, cover, and wait **4 minutes**.  
**Step 4:** Press slowly, pour immediately, and enjoy.

# 4.2 Infographic: Brewing Ratio

    +---------------------------+
    |  Coffee  |   Water        |
    +---------------------------+
    |  1 tbsp  | 150 ml (1 cup) |
    |  4 tbsp  | 600 ml         |
    |  8 tbsp  | 1.2 L (2 cups) |
    +---------------------------+
    

# 4.3 Tips from Experts

☑ **Use filtered water** – tap water may contain minerals that change taste.  
☑ **Preheat your French Press** – warm glass keeps coffee hot longer.  
☑ **Don’t over-steep** – longer than 4 minutes makes it bitter.  
☑ **Clean after every brew** – leftover oils can ruin taste.

>

# 4.4 Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Using fine coffee grounds (causes bitterness and grit).  
❌ Brewing too long or too short.  
❌ Using stale coffee.  
❌ Pouring boiling water directly.

# 4.5 How to Store Coffee Beans Properly

Keep your beans in an **airtight container** away from light and moisture.  
Never store coffee in the fridge — it absorbs smells easily.

>

# 4.6 Real User Experiences

* **Rony (India):** “Cleaning my French Press after every use fixed the strange taste I used to get.”
* **Lisa (Canada):** “Switching to filtered water made my coffee taste clean and sweet.”

# 4.7 Quick Checklist for Perfect French Press Coffee

✅ Freshly roasted Arabica beans  
✅ Coarse grind size (like sea salt)  
✅ Medium or dark roast  
✅ 4-minute brew time  
✅ Filtered water  
✅ Clean press every time

# ☕ Final Thoughts

Choosing the right coffee for your French Press isn’t hard once you understand the basics.  
The key is to focus on **freshness, grind size, and roast level**.

If you want a **smooth, rich, and satisfying cup**, go for **coarse-ground, medium or dark roast Arabica beans**. And always grind just before brewing for that café-quality flavor.

Your perfect cup of French Press coffee is just a few simple steps away.

1o9rg42,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o9rg42/my_grandmother_had_a_secret_guest/,My grandmother had a secret guest,"Feel free to comment, and if you like what you read, please upvote. Thank you. The story I'm about to tell is no fantasy at all, but rather a small chapter in my life.

My elders told me tales of the kindness that characterized my grandmother in her youth. Unfortunately, I only witnessed a diminished teacher, a senile entity. Such is the nature of time, which erodes the most distinguished members of our society.

The paintings on the walls were beautiful, but dust accumulated on every frame, on the relief of every brushstroke and the outlines of every wall. I regret that everything was a victim of neglect, so infectious it seemed the sun itself refused to shine through the windows for fear of being stained.

My imagination ran wild in my grandmother's house. I believed treasures from the ancient world layed there, dormant, buried in a sea of curiosities accumulated over the years. Beautiful statuettes, luxurious trinkets, tokens and many other bits that where witness of two lives, that had lived in that house, their stories told by the objects in the display on cases and shelves.

The back rooms were separated by thin walls of brick and stucco, three spaces arranged asymmetrically, two alike and the last one joined like a parasite. That back space belonged to Aunt Anabela, a real pain in the ass. Always annoyed, angry, poor and destitute by her own doing. Her condition was the effect of a delirium of attitude and too much ego.

""Thief!"" declared the class-action lawsuit from many workers for withheld bonuses; receipts for countless cell phones sold to Pawn Shops; trinkets that replaced genuine gold and silver jewels. That kleptomaniac named Anabela went to the extreme when she stole her own health, in a stupid fit of rage that arose from trying to prove she was wise. Her illness didn't kill her, but it made her unbearable, even for my grandmother, who had, unconditionally, cared for her for so many years.

Anabela's farewell is better left untold. Every family has a right to its secrets. She was no longer there, leaving behind a legacy of violence and strife she had inflicted upon the whole family. With her departure, the void of her presence became evident. For us, it brought peace. For my grandmother, loneliness.

For the first time in over fifty years, my grandma lived on her own. Her house became a fortress of darkness. The light was countered at the first step into the shadow of the entrance.


My mother took on the commitment of taking care of her. On the afternoon of every third day, for a year and a half, I found myself sitting in my grandmother's florid living room, fighting the nausea produced by a strange smell that impregnated the armchairs, surrounded by the dust and grime that flourishes when one cannot clean. The worst of it all was that my grandmother forbade us from helping her with her daily chores.

One day in March, strange echoes traveled through the walls, cutting the thin, golden threads of the waning sun. A descending chill hardened my bones. I rose stealthily. I silently advanced the few meters separating the living room from the arch of the kitchen's lintel. Once at the threshold, I directed my gaze to the floor, searching for any sound, however subtle, that would confirm or deny my suspicions. Finally, the hoarse voice in the kitchen again addressed the walls, uttering the simplest and most terrible words I have ever heard:

""And you, won't you have some coffee?""

My legs gave way, acquiring a gelatinous consistency.

""Grandma, who are you talking to?""

""With no one. I'm going to make myself a cup of coffee.""

""Go to the living room, I'll make it for you.""

Of course, I added sugar, as well as cream and a stir of milk. My grandmother loved how I made her coffee. It wasn't just for the taste, but my small wisdom that drove me to please the esteemed lady. She would die soon, no matter how much sugar was in the cup. Kidney failure is deadly and, most of the times, cannot be countered.

With every stir of the spoon, a new idea popped: Had I been deaf and stupid hearing her talk to herself in the kitchen? Or did she lie with a serene face, indifferent to whether it was an offense to me?

Each visit, I tried to gather new clues, attentive to my grandmother's behavior, hoping to find some other anomaly that would give me the most macabre answer of all. Who was she talking to in the kitchen?

When her body weakened, we were able to begin the process of cleaning her house. One afternoon, very focused on my task, I broke the cadence of my sweeping upon hearing the faint voice again. She was chattering in her room. There was no need to act furtive at that point, so I lent my ear and listened to a conversation flowing in one direction only:

""They'll still stay a while longer, they'll leave at nightfall.""

My head spun, too much to accept what was fitting together in my neurons. It had been a lie! A deliberate, methodical farce! My grandmother was indeed talking with someone, and very deliberately denied it. She didn't want the rest of us to know about her secret friendship.

But, what if she was just talking to herself?

Just like the light, the heat also shunned the room. In summer the place froze, in winter, it seemed like a crypt. My mother's solution seemed appropriate: taking my grandmother for walks to warm up under the sun, far from those icy walls. They both left, while I, exhausted from a long day at school, decided to stay and rest.

The supernatural silence of the figure peering from the doorframe was disturbing. Its head blended with the darkness of the room. It seemed like a bald man, with round ears and a jaw I don't recall if I could even see. Its shoulders were broad; its arms, skeletal. The proportions of its body were malformed, as if a madman had drawn a human with a pencil, careless of the laws of proportion or composition. The result? Long, lanky arms and tiny fingers, on a monstrous creature watching me from afar, in the back room.

Its hands clawed at the doorframe, its foot stood out, as if the darkness itself could cast a shadow. Its face protruded, hiding its body behind the wall. It wasn't static, but peered, shifting its weight from side to side, to clearly observe my soul with its lacerating gaze. I froze in the armchair, petrified. I waited for centuries for its advance, ready to face any fate that thing had in store for me, but that future never came.

Its gentle swaying began to seem comical to me. Shadow of shadows, darkness of the void, interstice of the soul. The entity had no face, no nails, no hair.

When my speech returned to my mouth, I could only scream at it. My hands felt weak, my body, impotent. I tried to threaten it, insult it, force it to leave the shadows and go away. It remained poised in the doorframe until, finally, it became still. The shadow slipped behind the wall when we heard the main gate's strident squeak. When the door opened, both relatives entered and the observer had vanished.

Every third day I had to man-up and enter the house. As the months passed, my fears dissipated, while the shadow proved indifferent to my presence. In the armchairs of the main living room, it would sit, settling among the narrow hallways and the dark rooms. It had no reflection in the large mirror, and that didn't seem to matter.

My older brother tells of his own encounter with that guest, not on the afternoons we attended to help our grandmother with her daily life, but on the day of her funeral.

When someone dies, many things are left in disorder and even more require care. He stayed at our grandmother's house that night to help arrange the necessary paperwork for the deceased. He slept feeling watched, until, upon waking, he noticed the breath of something close to his nape. He didn't turn over, he simply remained still, until the night enveloped his mind and he could sleep. That was the last time we heard of it.

When I look from the grayish living room towards the back rooms, I only find light. Thick threads of a powerful sun, accompanied by the clarity of sound traveling pure through the air.

Never leave people in loneliness. Never invite entities into your home. Some are invited for malevolent purposes, while others are drawn by solitude.

I only fear that my grandmother's secret companion still accompanies her today, seven years after we said goodbye.",1,1760780146.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I've been playing for a while, enjoy the fact as a free game I can pick up and put down as wanted due to hectic life schedule and not wanting to invest £70 on BF (yet).

That said, it feels like in order to be effective in PvP, you have to have the fast twitch fibers in your thumbs that would rival a sprinter in the Olympics 🤣 the (very few) human players I have encountered seem to be spring loaded and twitching like a kid with ADHD after 10 cups of coffee, and yet still land every shot they take.

I play with cross play disabled to avoid PC cheaters, but my question here is...

Question:

Is this now just the norm for every FPS? I don't play enough to know but from dabbling with COD on Xbox, and this on PS5, it seems like I need to just accept my fate - I am not nimble thumbed enough to play a modern FPS haha

1o9r7vm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diary/comments/1o9r7vm/its_been_a_while/,It’s been a while.,"Almost 12 years now. I don’t even know why I thought of you. What we were building, what we were hoping to do together. But I was at work, going over numbers, going over everything I’ve done this year. And it hit me. Everything we talked about, everything we wanted to do. And then it hit me. You, hit me.

I’m almost there. I’m so close I can almost grab it. But I’m terrified it’s all just going to run through my fingers like sand, again. 

Since that day, my life has been failure after failure. There was a year or two where every morning I woke up, sat at my coffee table with a glass of whiskey and my revolver side by side. Deciding “which one is it today?” Turns out, there’s a flaw in my revolver. The cylinder gets stuck unless you cock back the hammer. I didn’t know, and that’s the only reason I’m still here. Made me laugh, that the only reason I’m still alive is because of a flaw. Not a choice, a mistake in manufacturing. 

Well, fast forward a few years. I sold off all my assets and went all in on building a business. Sold everything off at the end of 2019. I didn’t pay attention to the news and didn’t care about a new “bird flu” on the horizon. Go figure, the week I was going to sign the five year lease on the building I was going to use as my headquarters, Covid lockdowns came. All the contracts I had made before this point, up in smoke. Hundreds of thousands of dollars in equipment sitting in a warehouse, waiting to be moved in, installed and put to work? Useless. 

Everything I had done and planned for over the course of the last 6-8 months instantly went to shit. Took me about another four months to liquidate everything, for maybe 1/3 the price I originally paid for. I ended up working about 110hrs a week that entire time. Maybe a few months more just while I was figured out what to do next and to try and recover some of the losses. It was a good distraction at least.

Decided to start another business. Got the building first, hired contractors, retrofitted everything and was up and running months after the lockdowns happened. Late 2020. Think it was October or November.  

Had to take a seven figure loan to afford everything. And for a little while? I thought I had made it then. Was making about 50k a month, but I was playing it safe. Kept most of it in reserve and paid off the debt service at twice the rate I needed to. 

Well, it worked great, until it didn’t. I had enough money in reserve to last a while, but when it was almost out, I had to decide again. Take a loan and push forward, or fold. I decided to fold but looking back? That was the wrong choice. Hindsight is always 20/20. Makes me wonder if you would have told me to keep going or just told me you’d back me whatever I chose. Would I have made the same choice?

I finally paid off the debt earlier this year. Worked my ass off the last three or so years to do so. I was desperate. Afraid I would end up homeless again. Glad you weren’t here so I didn’t have you or our kid to worry about. But, if you had both lived, would I have taken the same risks? Would I have gone “all in?” 

And now, here I am. I made almost 50k last week alone. Still living off the same 3500 budget a month I’ve been living off of since 2020. Yesterday, I withdrew most of what I made this week and thought about what I wanted to buy. I still wear the same clothes I did back then. That one shirt you hated, now looks like Swiss cheese. Was more holes than shirt. I threw it away, finally. You’d probably cheer. Thing is, I don’t “want” anything. You know I never gave a shit about fancy clothes, or cars or “stuff.” Maybe I’ll go on a long vacation. Not sure where, could just go to the airport, take the first international flight that accepts American passports and just, go for however long I feel like it. Might even buy business class, even though we used to balk at how crazy the prices are to just… sit on a plane. 

I’m almost there. But you’re not here. I can’t be the stay at home dad I wanted to be. You never got to be the stay at home mom you wanted to be. And that’s the only thing I ever wanted. Almost twelve years building, and it all just feels, empty without you both. ",1,1760779244.0,Diary,0,1.0,False

1o9r6i0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenBangladesh/comments/1o9r6i0/i_just_want_to_vent_about_my_brother/,I just want to vent about my brother,"I (18 F) have 2 brothers (24 M) (21 M) and 1 twin sister (18 F). My eldest brother (24 M) has cerebral palsy ( physical disabilities). I have no complain about my eldest brother he is the sweetest person ever, i loveee him . But my 2nd brother is the problem. I despise him. But i can't let my self to cut him off completely.  At the end of the day he is my brother. 

Lil background info, 
My father passed away when i was 15. My father had anger issues,  he was very strict person. I do think that maybe because of my father he ( my 2nd brother) turned out like that. My father was abusive with all of us including my mother( unfortunately it is kind of normal here, we live in Bangladesh,  typical brown family dad situation), but he loved my eldest brother so do we. He never spoke harsly with him. As he should. My father was not a bad person but a person with anger issue i guess...

 after my father passed away my 2nd brother who was 18 at that time took access of father's pension bank account, he started to take responsibilities , me and my sister also supported him, but my mother was upset , she wanted to take the responsibility. The reason why we supported him because my mother's mental health was not great at that time, still it is not.( and my mother trusted her brothers , they weren't good ppl they did scammed my father at past). She was not in her right mind, she would have mental breakdown everyday. We trusted our brother. It's not like my brother was in much better position but he was better than my mother, but did had anger issues just like father. He would get angry beacuse we (me and my twin) weren't being productive like we used to when father was alive,(  for context, we used to wake up 5 in the morning , clean the house, serve everyone breakfast,  feed my eldest brother etc.) But after father passed away it was hard to wake up me and my sister became very depressed.  My brother was not having it ,he started to act like father, he would scream at us everyday, every single day we would have loud arguments with him. He became very religious which was good thing but he started shout at us if we  played any music or listen to any , he would say that we are being like kafir ( a term used as non beliver in islam) , he would use slurs when ever we had any arguments. It was hard, we all were depressed but he thought he was the only one going through it. The fact that he expected us to act normal while he was depressed himself. 
But we never douted him with finances. That was the biggest mistake of all. he took  one year break of studies , we supported him , cuz we knew he needed that after all he also went through our father's death mentally. He started to go on tours with his friend , we supported him. after he came back, I  let my mother and my twin to go to her father's place, which is in another district. They stayed there for weeks. I supported them . I told them to go , i would take care of my disable brother and house works while attending school. I didn't mind all of that, cuz i knew they needed that break from everything and time for themselves . The turning point came when my brother would not bring groceries , he would delay thing for days, i understood cuz he was new to this responsibilities.  But what i didn't understand was he started to spend money on himself lavishly.  Father's bank account had limited amount of money. We all knew it will not last us for ever , it had money to last us for 5-6  years at max. But his lavish spending was kind of selfish cuz he would buy expensive utilities,  skincare, crazy expensive coffees , branded shoes every month, shirt, guitar( he does not play guitars).  He would buy expensive breads , butters and expensive breakfast just for himself . He would lock his foods in his room . But every time we told him to get normal gocery and vegetables he would get paranoid and say that all we can talk is money money and money, he would act like we use him for money, he would say that we only need him for money , but those money were not even his money. They were meant to spend on groceries . Mind you, we never said anything about his expensive shoes , foods, or clothes.  We never pointed those out cuz we didn't wanted him to felt hurt. I thought it was a phase he would grow out and understand the cost of money , or get a side job for his things.  He never did. He brought latest phones ( even though he had pretty expensivephone before, my father brought him a phone from london the year he passed away.  He didn't sell it , he straightup brought new one cuz it had better camera features.  The new phone was Samsung s 24 ultra which coat a lottt), hair care, rented cars just to have long drives with his friends. Than he got admitted into a private uni, we supported him on that, but but but, he got himself a girlfriend,  there is nothing wrong with that,  but wasn't he religious person? who didn't listen to music, despied other religions, and ppl from  other religions.  GUESS WHAT?  His gf was from other religion. At this point i was not angry i was happy , cuz i thought wow he is finally respecting other religion and ppls. The irony of his, on  me and my sister first day of high school he warned us not to be in any relationship with any boy or contact any boy  cuz families reputation depends on us!!!! Cuz we are girls????? But he himself had gf (still has). Woahhhhh the irony!!!!  At this point i was feeling bad for the girl (his gf) his gf studies in the same uni, same depertment but you all are not ready for the plot twist, his gf had a fiance . Who lives in abroad and gives her tution and course fees, , she was literally cheating on her fiance ( now ex- fiance) with my brother, now you all will say karma , but noo , after my brother learned about him he still didn't breakup with her, now he is still with her , its a long story i think i can write a movie abt that , i'll make another post about them, cuz there are many plot twists.  Cuz her affair kind of went viral on Facebook after the finance's post on fb, he later deleted it, i'll post about it on nsfw . It does have self harm discussions ... i feel bad about the  ex fiance.  I am sorry i have such a brother. 
Btw after they ( my brother and his gf) went viral my brother didn't attend his uni even though he paid the fees in full. So much money wasted.. 

I feel bad for my mother and my disable brother,  me and my sister probably have to take care of them financially in the future . Also my mother's health is not at best. My sister is really good in her studies. I don't want our family to be a burden for her . She said that she will not take any responsibility for our family in the future,  i understand her, it is not our responsibility,  but i don't have the heart to abandon my family.  I just hope she will atleast be there for us when i'll have hard time cuz we are  twins after all. I know she will. 

Godd i'm literally crying writting this post. Wish me best of luck , thank you for reading this far.

when i started, this new manager was amazing, she knew how to run the hotel and wasn't new to anything, so she knew how to help out everyone. and she would, with housekeeping, front desk, hell she even did breakfasts some mornings. 

a year and a half later, she's been cutting people's hours in an effort to force them to quit so she doesn't have to pay them unemployment, and when that doesnt work, she forces more work onto them in an attempt to overwork them and set them off so it's a ,,reasonable"" termination.

others, she'll let slide with anything, such as not doing laundry, not cleaning the public spaces, stocking coffee bars, bartenders not doing their dishes, and breakfast folk leaving the kitchen in absolute disarray. they can sit anytime they want, completely ignore the front desk when it has guests wanting to check in or out, and all around just not do their job. 

aside from that, i've been a night auditor since i came back and love it, but my wife misses when we could do thjngs in the evenings and didn't have to rush so much during our weekends since i would get off super early in the mkrning compared to her getting off the night before. i've asked my manaher time and time again to see if there was any way i could switch from NA to morning shifts, midshifts, even evening shifts or housekeeping, and have been told it's ,,completely impossible"" and that there's ,,no way in hell"" i'm coming off of night audit. 

i have been the longest standing auditor she's had since she's moved to our location and says that i ,,just wouldn't be a good fit anywhere else"".

This post is for everyone whose desk currently looks like a mild disaster zone.  
Because same.

My “study setup” usually includes:

* Two mugs (one for coffee, one for “emotional support”).
* Ten pens but only one that actually works.
* A pile of sticky notes that somehow lost their stick.
* And, of course, my phone - sitting innocently beside me like a tiny distraction demon.

The truth? Productivity doesn’t need to look pretty. Some of my best study sessions happened in total chaos - hoodie on, hair a mess, music too loud.

Let's be honest, the appeal is undeniable. In a world of ""next-day delivery"" and instant downloads, the slow grind of organic voting can feel agonizing. Websites that sell votes promise a quick fix—a surge of numbers that can push you into the lead overnight. For a price, you can:

* **Gain a rapid advantage.**
* **Demoralize the competition.**
* **Feel the immediate gratification of a climbing vote count.**

It targets our impatience and our deep desire to win. But before you click ""add to cart,"" you need to understand the other side of the coin.

# The Hidden Cost of Fake Votes

Buying votes isn't a clever loophole; it's a high-risk strategy that can backfire spectacularly. Here’s what the sellers won’t tell you:

**1. The Quality of the Votes is Abysmal**  
Where do these votes come from? Often, they are generated by bots, click farms, or low-paid workers using fake accounts. These aren't genuine supporters; they're hollow numbers that add zero real engagement to your brand or cause.

**2. You're Playing with Fire: The Rules**  
**Read the contest rules. Seriously, read them.** Almost every legitimate contest has a clause explicitly prohibiting the use of ""automated votes,"" ""paid services,"" or ""artificial engagement."" Getting caught means:

* **Immediate Disqualification:** All your effort, organic or not, is wasted.
* **Public Embarrassment:** Being named as a cheater can damage your personal or business reputation.
* **Being Blacklisted:** You might be banned from future contests by that organization.

**3. The Domino Effect on Your Credibility**  
If you’re a business or creator, winning fraudulently is a PR disaster waiting to happen. When people discover the win wasn't legitimate (and the internet *always* finds out), the trust you’ve worked so hard to build can evaporate in an instant. Is a short-term win worth your long-term reputation?

# The Champion's Alternative: How to WIN Without Buying

So, if buying votes is off the table, how do you actually *win*? By playing a smarter, more authentic game. Redirect the money you would have spent on fake votes into these powerful, legitimate strategies:

**1. Mobilize Your Core Network.**  
Don't just post a link and hope. Send personal texts, create a family WhatsApp group, or email close friends and colleagues with a direct, passionate plea. People are more likely to help when asked personally.

**2. Create a Vote-Gathering ""Hub.""**  
Make it stupidly easy for people to vote. Create a single social media post (on Instagram, Facebook, etc.) with a clear call-to-action: ""**Vote for me here! One click and you're done!**"" Pin this post to the top of your profile.

**3. Leverage the Power of Niche Communities.**  
Share your contest in relevant online groups or forums. **Crucially, always ask for permission from admins first** and follow group rules. Frame it as, ""Hey everyone, I'm participating in this contest for \[Your Reason\] and would appreciate your support if you feel it's deserved!""

**4. Offer a Little Incentive.**  
Create a mini-contest of your own! ""Everyone who votes and screenshots their vote will be entered to win a $10 coffee gift card!"" This rewards your real supporters and creates a genuine incentive to engage.

**5. Engage, Don't Just Ask.**  
Post updates, behind-the-scenes content, or funny stories related to the contest. Show people the *person* behind the entry. Engagement builds a tribe of real supporters who will vote for you every day and defend you against cheaters.

# The Final Verdict

While the option to [buy poll votes](https://www.socialreputationpro.com/buy-poll-votes/) might seem like a tempting shortcut, it’s a path paved with risk and empty numbers. The true victory doesn't just come from a prize; it comes from the journey of earning genuine support.

So, invest your energy not in buying votes, but in building a campaign that people *want* to vote for. That’s a win that feels good long after the contest is over.

Now, go out there and win it the right way

# 🤔 A Note on Buying Poll Votes and Finding Alternatives

While the search results did contain a general article about sites that sell Instagram poll votes, this was unrelated to Social Reputation PRO. This practice is often against the terms of service of social media platforms and contest organizers, and can lead to disqualification or other penalties.

For increasing engagement in a contest, it's safer and more sustainable to focus on organic marketing strategies. You could try:

* **Leveraging Your Own Networks**: Mobilize your existing customers, email lists, and social media followers.
* **Creating Shareable Content**: Develop content that encourages people to vote and share organically.
* **Running Legitimate Ad Campaigns**: Use targeted ads on platforms like Facebook or Instagram to reach a broader audience and encourage participation.

Hey everyone! I’m relatively new to the coffee world—used to rely on Starbucks and Nespresso pods at the office. A few weeks ago, I bought the Outin Nano portable espresso maker and I’m absolutely loving it! It’s so convenient for weekdays at work with capsules, and on weekends I bring it home and use ground coffee. The flexibility is a game-changer.

This weekend, I’ve decided to step up my game and try making coffee with fresh beans, but I have no idea where to start. I’d really appreciate your advice on a couple of things:

1. **What should I look for when choosing coffee beans?** Factors like origin, roast level, freshness, etc.? Any bean recommendations for beginners?
2. **How much does the grinder matter?** A friend gave me a manual grinder, but I’m wondering if it’s worth upgrading to the Outin Fino portable grinder. How does the quality of the grinder affect the final taste of the coffee? What are the main differences between manual and electric grinders?

As a coffee newbie, any tips would mean a lot to me! Thanks in advance!",1,1760777921.0,OutInCoffee,0,1.0,False

1o9qqyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1o9qqyz/ro_a_lonely_man_working_in_a_old_library/,[RO] A lonely man working in a old library,"

**Prologue:** 

I never had many friends. 

But I never struggled with talking. People say hello to me as I pass by them on the sidewalk. They have small conversations with me as they check out my groceries. They smile at me when they ask me for my name. Maybe they were just being nice but I like to believe they are drawn to me. 

I never understood why I wasn’t able to maintain relationships. Maybe it was because my parents always fought ever since I was born. Or maybe it was because my father left us when I was 9 years old. Maybe because I lost trust in love. Or maybe it was because of the way I stuttered. Nevertheless, I was always alone. 

Until the day I met her. 

The first time I saw her, I was working at the library. Books are my only companion for an alone man like me. I found that books are better than people as they don’t have a voice to talk back to you, to judge you, to criticize you. “Dogs of Babel” was in my hand. I was reshelving it from re-reading it for the tenth time.

I resonated with the main character.  The novel is about a man who lost his wife. I felt as if the man was me, except he was alone because he lost his wife. I was alone because I chose to be this way. 

It was a sunny day in February. The dusty library smelled like cheap coffee from the bookkeeper who was losing his tastebuds. He couldn’t tell the difference between authenticity and fraud, but I guess that’s a luxury we get when we become old. 

The bookkeeper is the only person I talk to, really. His name is Fredrick, Freddy for short. He just turned seventy- three years old and he was the closest thing I had to a friend. 

Or a father if I want to be sentimental. 

She was in the romance section, wearing a summer dress- a long white one with blue flowers on it. It was one of those dresses you see at a Sunday church service when they sing worship songs in the morning. Her brunette hair was shoulder length, wavy, and fell over one side of her face. She had tan skin from being in the sun too long, probably reading on a picnic blanket in the park. Her lips are bright pink and pursed as if she can’t decide what book to choose. She doesn’t look at me staring at her, of course- people barely notice me. 



My first reaction is to talk to her but my subconscious stops me from doing so. Imagine all the things I could’ve done if it weren’t for my mind. 



I should reorganize the children’s section. 

The windows need waxing. 

The floors need sweeping. 



But no matter how much I tell myself to keep working, no matter how much I try to focus, my curiosity floats to her. 



I look up and she has moved to the historical fiction section, holding up a novel we just received from the new shipment. 



I force myself to look down at my shoes, my clothes. 



She wouldn’t like a man like me, not at all. I wasn’t handsome like the men you see on TV. I wasn’t Richard Gere from Pretty Woman or Patrick Swayze from Dirty Dancing. I didn’t have money or virtue or fame or talent.



No, I am far less than that. 



Because I have nothing to offer. 



I am a man who lives in a rickety, old apartment, who scraped just enough money from minimum wage jobs to move out of his mother’s house. I am a man who wears socks with holes in them because he can’t afford to buy new ones. I am a man who can’t hold a simple job- a man who can’t provide for a family. 



A woman as beautiful as her doesn’t deserve a man like me. She couldn’t love me. 



I drop my gaze from her, letting my fantasies go. 



But as I turned to walk out the door, something incredible happened. Something that never happened to someone like me. It was as if all my prayers to God came true. 



Because she was in front of me, flashing me a smile so serene it hurt. 





**Chapter 1:** 



“Hi”, she says, barely a whisper. Her gentle voice sends shivers across my skin as if a million symphonies played harmoniously all at once. I’ve never heard such a sound so sweet, so loving. 



“Hello,” I say back, hoping my voice isn’t shaky. “What can I help you with?” 



She pauses and looks at me. Really looks at me. I feel a bit exposed as if I am standing in nothing, but my hole-ridden socks. But at the same time, I feel more seen than I ever did my whole thirty years of life. 



After ten seconds, she says, “I’m wondering if you have this book but I don’t remember the title.”



“Do you remember the preface of the book?” I ask. 



She thinks for a moment, tilting her head at a slight angle so she can stare at the ceiling. I take in her glass skin, full lips, and her rich scent that reminds me of sunshine, making me feel a bit light-headed and dizzy. 



She looks back at me, eyes wide, popping all my thoughts. 



“The book is about four children who have special abilities and go to work for an organization bringing down evil, do you know it by chance?” she asks. Her eyes are sparkling, like pools of brown honey melting into my skin.



I knit my eyebrows together, thinking hard. “It’s a children’s book?”



“Yes! Sorry, I forgot to mention that,” she chuckles softly. “I’m a third-grade elementary school teacher, you know. My children want to read the book and I wanted to read it before placing an order at the school library.” She rolls her eyes at herself, smiling softly. 



Of course, she works for children. A lady so whimsical and caring must be a nurturer. 



I smile, forcing my face to move in a way that my muscles aren’t accustomed to. “Isn’t that book ‘The Mysterious Benedict Society?” 



She gasps. “Oh my gosh, yes, I think so!” She is overridden by joy. “Do you know where I can find it?”



“Yes, Children’s section, on your first right, under ‘Trenton Lee Stewart.” 



“Awesome, thank you so much….um.” She looks down at my name tag. “Gregory.” 



She gives me a small smile before heading to the Children’s section, leaving me with hope that fate will draw us back together again. 



**Chapter 2:**

It’t Sunday. Which means it’s laundry day. 

I take my soiled clothes 

 hoping she is my answer to my solitude. 

Her name is Elana. 

The next couple of days is a bliss. We meet again at the same bookstore, we exchange numbers, we go out for coffee. 

She tells me she is 25 years old and that her birthday is on July 17th- 5 years, 2 months and 4 days after mine. She is an elementary school teacher for third grade. She tells me she loves children because she never had a childhood of her own. She loves cotton candy-flavored ice cream because she wasn’t able to have it when she was a child. Her favorite band are “The Smiths.” She has vivid and colorful dreams of universes she has never imagined in her conscious mind. 

It was a miracle for someone like her to talk to an aloof man like me! Because she truly is the most fascinating individual I have ever met. Not saying that I have met many people but she saved me from the void in my heart.

Spoiler: *you’ll never be fully ready.*

I used to believe that I needed the perfect setup - fresh coffee, silence, a clean desk, and a golden beam of sunlight hitting my notes at a 45° angle. But honestly? Those perfect moments almost never happen.

Then one day, out of desperation, I started studying in a noisy café. No headphones, no plan — just my laptop and chaos. And somehow… it worked.  
I realized focus doesn’t come from perfection - it comes from *starting anyway.*

Life’s always going to be messy. You’ll never have unlimited time, energy, or motivation. So instead of waiting for the perfect moment, create progress in imperfect ones.

1o9qpdm,https://www.reddit.com/r/freewill/comments/1o9qpdm/just_finished_a_capstone_philosophy_course_on/,"Just finished a capstone philosophy course on free will (technically metaphysics/philosophy of mind, but the class was entirely focused on free will and mental causation). Here's my term paper in which i reject libertarianism within Humean metaphysics","Rejecting Libertarianism Within Humean Metaphysics

**1. Introduction**

In this paper I will argue that libertarian views of free will should be rejected, because (i) event-causal libertarianism does not provide an account of free will that allows the agent to make a difference in their actions, and (ii) substance-causal libertarianism is at odds with an empirical Humean metaphysics. I do this by first presenting my deductively-valid argument in premise-premise-conclusion format. I go on to defend the major basic premises in the argument and address objections which could conceivably be brought against my arguments.

1. An action is free if and only if the agent is a difference maker in that action (Basic).
2. If a view does not provide an adequate account of free will, then it should be rejected (Basic).
3. Event-causal libertarianism provides an adequate account of free will (Assume for *reductio*).
4. If event-causal libertarianism provides an adequate account of free will, then an action is free if and only if the agent identifies with the motivation causing that action (Basic).
5. If an action is free if and only if the agent identifies with the motivation causing that action, then it is not the case that an action is free if and only if the agent is a difference maker in that action (Basic).
6. It is not the case that an action is free if and only if the agent identifies with the motivation causing that action (*Modus tollens* 1, 5).
7. Event-causal libertarianism does not provide an adequate account of free will (completes *reductio*).
8. Event-causal libertarianism should be rejected (*Modus ponens* 2, 7)
9. Substance-causal libertarianism posits that substances have primitive, irreducible causal powers (Basic).
10. If a theory posits that substances have primitive causal powers, then it does not operate within Humean metaphysics (Basic).
11. If a theory does not operate within Humean metaphysics, then it should be rejected (Basic).
12. Substance-causal libertarianism does not operate within Humean metaphysics (*Modus ponens* 9, 10).
13. Substance-causal libertarianism should be rejected (*Modus ponens* 11, 12).
14. If both event-causal libertarianism and substance-causal libertarianism should be rejected, then libertarianism should be rejected (Basic).
15. Libertarianism should be rejected (*Modus ponens* 8, 13, 14).

A major reason for seeing premise (1) as true is that it is intuitive. When we think about what makes an action free, we think that it was us, not some other agent, that was responsible for that action. If we consider a cartoon scenario where an evil villain has hacked into our brains and controls our bodies, then whatever actions carried out were carried out by the villain and not ourselves. Clearly, it must be I who is the source of my actions and not someone else. My action is free only if I am the cause of that action – the difference-maker in that action. David Lewis put it this way: “We think of a cause as something that makes a difference, and the difference it makes must be a difference from what would have happened without it” (Lewis 1986).

To justify (2), when we are considering what is required in a theory for free will, the account given in that theory should be an adequate account. This should be an uncontroversial statement. Naturally, if the theories don’t provide such an account, they should be rejected. Providing an adequate account of free will is a necessary condition of being an acceptable theory. 

**2. Event-Causal Libertarianism**

Event-causal libertarianism is described well in “Agent Causation in a Neo-Aristotelian Metaphysics” by Jonathan D. Jacobs and Timothy O’Connor

 “... when an agent freely acts, her web of motivational states is jointly disposed towards two or more choices, to varying degrees. Whichever choice is made, it will have been caused by some relevant motivation of the agent, a motivation with which she identifies. The exercise of agent-control consists in the causal efficacy of one's motivations, and freedom further requires the openness of the future to (or consistency of the past and laws with) a plurality of specific outcomes.” (Jacobs and O’Connor 179)

Under event-causal libertarianism, the agent freely acts when the motivation with which she identifies causes that action. This is expressed in premise (4).

Events are caused by other events in this view. This can be taken as events having causal powers themselves. Alternatively we can view this as a difference-making account of causation: if event A had not occurred, event B would not have occurred. Either way, we use the same language to talk about it. When we refer to an individual or subject or person in this context, we are referring to the deliberation process belonging to that person, realized as a sequence of mental events such as the having of a motivation, deliberating, and forming intentions. The causal link between motivations and choice being undetermined opens a plurality of alternatives; this is what makes this view different from determinism (Jacobs and O’Connor 179). According to the view being discussed by Jacobs and O’Connor, the action is free if the motivations for it belong to the agent, meaning the agent wasn’t externally manipulated, and the decision was undetermined at the moment the decision was made. The decision is undetermined because the reasons motivating the decision holds probabilistic weight. There is a 25% chance I will drink tea and a 75% chance I will drink coffee. The action is the individual’s because whichever outcome occurs is produced by the subject’s own reasons-responsive deliberation process.

I don’t think this is the right kind of freedom to constitute free action. To determine the cause of an event, we can ask two counterfactuals: (i) If X would have happened, then Y would have happened, and (ii) If X would not have happened, then Y would not have happened. By considering different relevant factors, we could find which factor holds the strongest invariance relation to the action. If I get into a fight while wearing a pink Hello Kitty t-shirt, that doesn’t necessarily mean that my decision to wear the pink Hello Kitty t-shirt was the cause of me getting punched. Had I not worn it, I would still have gotten punched, so my wearing the t-shirt fails to satisfy (ii). An event that holds a stronger invariance relation to me getting punched was when I challenged an accepting stranger to fight me. Had that not happened, it’s fair to say I would not have gotten into a fight, so (ii) is satisfied. If we are to consider the agent as a cause of their actions, we must consider the same counterfactuals. 

Whether a given event will happen is a matter of probability-weighted reasons. If those reasons were not there, the set of events as a disjunction (80% chance of event A or 20% chance of event B, for example) would not occur. If they are there, the set of events would occur. If we were to posit an agent into this equation, what difference could they make? We already have all we need to make the event occur, so the addition of a difference-making agent would be explanatorily redundant. Absent reasons, the agent, who supposedly responds to reasons, would have nothing to respond to, making whatever actions they take random. Random actions are not usually constitutive of the type of free will most people claim to have, but they technically could fit the definition we laid out in (1). However I think we should reject the idea that our actions happen without reason. If we were to consider why people take the actions they take, reasons appear to explain them better than sheer randomness. 

**3. Objection - What About Self-Forming Actions?**

One could reject premise (4). In “The complex tapestry of free will: striving will, indeterminism and volitional streams”,  another account of free will is given by Robert Kane with self-forming actions. He distinguishes between freedom of action and freedom of will. Freedom of will is about self-formation, not just identifying with the motivations of a given action, as stated in (4). He says that we live in an indeterministic universe, but indeterminism need not be involved in every act one does to have free will. Kane states three types of acts: 

“(1) acts done voluntarily, on purpose and for reasons that are not coerced, compelled or otherwise constrained or subject to control by other agents.

(2) acts \[free in sense 1 that are also\] done “of our own free will” in the sense of a will that we are ultimately responsible (UR) to some degree for forming.

(3) “self-forming” acts (SFAs) or “will-setting” acts by which we form and reform the will from which we act in sense 2.” (Kane 147)

Acts of the third type require indeterminism and are the main focus of my critique. These actions occur when we have competing visions of what we ought to do or become. Like in Pereboom’s paper, we are torn between conflicting volitional streams, or goal-oriented cognitive processes. Which volitional stream will win is undetermined. We have control over whether one choice will be or not be by striving for one choice or another. Either volitional stream could have succeeded, but the agent exercised their control over the event by striving for their favored volitional stream to succeed in this competition. When faced with these situations, which choice will be realized is influenced by factors such as the agent’s beliefs, desires, character, capacities, or any other relevant inputs, adjusting the probability of some event occurring over another. This striving is possible, Kane claims, due to indeterminancy in the neural processes which occur during those soul-searching moments when we are torn between multiple conflicting streams (Kane 148). 

Kane would then deny premise (4); we can have free acts under event-causal libertarianism in such a way that the agent need not identify with the motivation causing the action. Actions falling under the second categorization are free, since they follow from the formation of a free will. Since this free will is said to be formed, using type 3 actions, within an event-causal libertarian framework, and the agent is the difference-maker when they strive for one volitional stream over another, we can say Kane would deny (4).

I would question whether Kane’s argument truly advocates for an event-causal libertarian position. When the agent strives, how exactly does this striving affect the outcome? If the agent does influence the outcome through striving, then this would be agent causation, not event causation. If the agent does not influence the outcome through striving, then what difference could the agent have made? Either way, this framework does not provide an event-causal libertarian framework in which the agent is a difference-maker. 

**4. Substance-causal Libertarianism**

As we have seen, it doesn’t seem possible for event-causal libertarianism to account for a difference-making agent. Another libertarian view to be considered is agent-causal libertarianism, a view in which agents have primitive causal powers. Let’s first make it clear the type of problem an agent-causal view might be used to solve. Consider someone choosing between two options for which they have equally strong reasons, as Derk Pereboom did in ”The disappearing agent objection to event-causal libertarianism”:

“On an event-causal libertarian picture, the relevant causal conditions antecedent the decision—agent-involving events—would leave it open whether the decision will occur, and the agent has no further causal role in determining whether it does. With the causal role of the antecedent events already given, whether the decision occurs is not settled by any causal factor involving the agent.  In fact, given the causal role of all causally relevant antecedent events, nothing settles whether the decision occurs. Thus, plausibly, on the event-causal libertarian picture, agents lack the control required for moral responsibility.” (Pereboom 60)

A possible solution to this problem would be to posit a causal agent. When there are equally good reasons for choosing either of two decisions, it is the agent who chooses and not sheer luck or chance. The agents being considered are ones that have a primitive causal ability to initiate decisions not determined by prior events. Thus, they can be difference-makers and could achieve the type of freedom stipulated by premise (1). 

My issue with the suggestion of the existence of causal agents, and objects with primitive causal powers in general, is that it seems like their existence relies on a similar argument made by Descartes responding Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia regarding mental causation in the physical world. In what might be described as hand-waving the issue, Descartes writes, “The soul has the power to move the body by the simple fact that it wills it; this power belongs to it by nature, just as extension belongs to the body” (*Philosophical Writings* 3:224). It seems that both Descartes and the agent-causalist appeal to a primitive causal power, side-steping the explanatory burden. The difference-making account of causation could be described as Humean in nature. As such, we only make conclusions about what we can observe. We can’t see causation itself; we draw conclusions from observable events and the resultant patterns. How would we identify the causal powers of agents, or any other object, in any substantial way that doesn’t amount to the difference-making view already described? By positing that agents possess this primitive ability to initiate decisions, the agent-causal libertarian view simply operates on an entirely different and incompatible account of metaphysics than we’ve been dealing with so far. For this reason, if we are committed to a Humean or empirical view of metaphysics, we ought to reject this view.

A possible objection to my rejection of substance-causal libertarianism may come from emergentist agent-causal views. Defended by Timothy O’Connor and discussed by Jessica Wilson in *Metaphysical Emergence*, a version of this view states that an agent’s causal power is an emergent power grounded in the agent’s lower-level physical and psychological organization. Characterized as strong emergence, new powers arise at the agential level that are not reducible to lower-level physical states yet are dependent on them. When the agent, a unified physical system capable of acting for reasons, deliberates, a causal power emerges, allowing the agent to settle which intention becomes actual. It may seem that this type of power can avoid the standard Humean objection to unexplained primitive causal powers. Wilson offers an entitlement argument. Since (i) we experience ourselves as choosing freely in ways that transcend nomological goings-on and (ii) we don’t have good reasons to reject this experience at face value, it follows that we are entitled to regard our experience as of nomologically transcendent free will (Wilson 277). If taken seriously, this seems to support a substance/agent-causal libertarian stance. The best explanation of “nomologically transcendent” choosing would be an agent with an emergent, ontologically novel causal power to make choices. I reject this view, since although we don’t *prima facie* have explicit reasons to reject our own experience as difference making agents, we also lack any independent reason to posit emergent causal powers beyond those already accounted for by a physicalist explanation. Appealing to powers we can’t prove reintroduces the same explanatory gap faced by Cartesian interactionism.

**5. Conclusion**

In this paper, I made the argument that libertarianism regarding free will should be rejected. Event-causal libertarianism should be rejected because it does not allow the type of freedom necessary for an agent to be a difference-maker in its actions. Substance-causal libertarianism should be rejected because it cannot coexist with Humean metaphysics.

Truthfully I miss you A.. even though we had a 11 year age gap and I would tease you for being a cougar, we connected on a spiritual level and we could pick at each other brains over endless topics over coffee. You were a coffee junkie just like me and making a warm cup of coffee at night time just so we can enjoy each other company and talk was the highlights of most of my days. 
You made me feel like we were going be together in this life till the very end. 
At the end we went out different paths and deep down I afraid you were going move back to Colombia since you mention you consider going back to finish school.. 
man …

Look. Corazón, when you texted me on February if I wanted to grab a coffee with you and simply catch up… 
A million thoughts arose to my head that linked to my heart and how I wanted to look into those honey brown eyes of yours and feel your head upon my chest as my arms wrap around you so tight the you can feel how much I missed you all this time ..

But as a man I couldn’t offer all the things you deserve, nor the lifestyle you were use too. You deserved endless trips to any places you wanted to go. The finest bike so you can go anywhere since you are a cyclist and even tried to get me to get into it ..
Everything you wanted and definitely deserve I couldn’t afford and it made me sad. And no matter how much I strive to move up the ladder at my job. It will take a while to get there. So I said it was better for us not to see us. Because of how much I love you… I couldn’t hold you back to finding someone else that could offer you all those things.. 
as a man. It killed/kills me that I did that. But I want you to know I still love you. I might not have the steepest pockets in finances. But there isn’t a penny more on how much a person can love another person… 
Maybe in another life time I’ll get a chance to win your heart over before you experience so much heart breaks and difficulties in life. I would endure every and any of your hardships  and painful times in your life so you wouldn’t have too. 
I’ve been through hell and back at a very young age. You know this. There was a time I would flinch at my own shadow because I thought I was going be jumped, shot, stab etc etc ..
But for you I’ll add to my scars and protect you until my very last breath.

I’ll try to keep this short but add some context. 

So this happened a few months ago but I’d like to know a couple things. 

I’m going through a divorce and found out some things I really didn’t like and was very upset about, there was some talking and yelling and just generally being pissed off but regardless, I was fine in the grand scheme of things (none of this was in the presence of the ex by the way) 

I went for a drive just to clear my head, go to the bank and talk to my lawyer, maybe grab a coffee. Well in the mean time, someone in my family took it upon themselves to call the police on me for a wellness check. Later found out they were looking for me all over the city and the country side and never found me but I was literally sitting in a car wash, washing my vehicle. I never did end up going to the lawyer because the police called me and wanted to talk which, even though I was absolutely fuming, I agreed to. 

Met with the police and had a good talk. I asked what the hell this was even about and blah blah. They told me someone called but they don’t know why, as I was perfectly fine and not under the influence or anything and I just laughed kind of knowing what I later found out.

I saw the text messages from my ex to my mother a couple days later basically convincing her and convincing her to call the police on me for a wellness check and feeding her complete lies as to why. Not even believable lies either, anyways, I guess my main question is, did she do all of this BS and get the police called on me so it looks better for her in court with the divorce? We have two kids. I really feel like that was her motive. It’s already basically ruined any reputation I have and I hardly talk to lots of my family anymore and they treat me differently, I think the majority of my friends aren’t friends anymore. This has taken a toll on my life. Is this in a way, defamation or something along those lines? 

Thanks for reading and I hope to get some incite from some of you on here.

I was keen for a \~2kW inverter to power a coffee machine and occasional high power devices, but the vast majority of my setup will run straight off DC (including AC, fridge, laptop etc)

* Extra/emergency battery (albeit only 1000Wh)

Sometimes my heart feels like it’s going to burst out of my chest. 

What I mean by this is that I’m sitting in my car, it’s nearly 2 am and my car seat is laid all the way back until it’s practically touching the floor and I’m panting like a lunatic. My heart drums in my ears as if there are 2, no, 3 hearts banging against my rib cage, begging to be set free. The uneven patter of my pulse sends a rattle to the rest of my body, sending jolts of static to my already sweaty palms and feet.

My car is parked in the parking lot of my old middle school; it was the only place that looked inconspicuous at this late hour. I look out into the darkness where no lights are on, making me feel entirely alone on this cold, rigid planet. 

I close my eyes and lean back. I take 5 deep breaths and think, “Why am I here? No, really, why?”

I don’t really know who I’m talking to, really, but it feels satisfying to ask these questions as if someone from higher up can hear and take pity on me. 

Physically, I know why I’m here. I had a severe panic attack and felt suffocated in my home, grabbing my keys to go on a late drive. 

Mentally, I don’t know why I’m here. Why I’m placed on this earth, facing these challenges I can barely handle? Will the people who love me still love me if they see me like this? 

The eerie silence of the dark somewhat brings peace to me. It seems like something might crawl into view through the rustle of the bushes. As if when I’m not looking, a person might pop into my side view of my car. Scary, I know, but we all think it. It gives me shivers so intense that I can’t even imagine it. 

When I’ve finally calmed down I take my car for a drive around the neighborhood, passing by a couple of cars here and there. There’s something calming and peaceful about being the only one of the road, not having to signal, look out for pedestrians, and not be pressured to drive a certain speed limit so the person behind you doesn’t get angry. 

The stop lights flash from red to green, and I push the gas pedal until I hear the steady hum of my engine. My neighborhood is all asleep, and I find myself looking to see if lights are still on so I don’t feel so alone this late at night. 

Everything looks so different in the darkness as if the whole world is asleep, waiting for the sun to come back. I find that being isolated with intense thoughts at is exemplified during this time because you don’t have the sun to accompany you. Or the soft murmur of laughter in the distance. Or someone taking your order at Starbucks. You feel vulnerable. Small. Easily attacked. Unprotected. 

My mind is a blur like there’s a humming bird flying around and no matter how hard you chase it you can’t catch a proper glimpse. I make a right turn heading towards downtown and I sit there like a zombie, numb with thoughts. 

Around 30 mins of driving, I finally decide to head home, crawling up my creaky stairs, taking the pills I grew so confident in not needing, and finally curling up in my bed. 

Tomorrow, perhaps.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think what I love about Mondays is the restart. A restart button that allows you to redo what you didn’t do last week. Didn’t exercise last week? No problem, Monday is the day to start. Didn’t clean the house last week? No problem, you can fix everything on the start of Monday. 

I never agreed with people who thought of Sunday as the start of the new week. It is just incorrect. Sunday is still part of the weekend.  Every chart, whiteboard, and calendar starts with Mondays. At least, that’s what I force myself to see. 

This morning was the start of fall, the first day of September the official day of Fall. My favorite time of the year. Boston does have seasons, unlike California where I grew up in. I think what I love most about fall is the transition from cold to hot like it is earth’s way of shedding its old skin to start anew. 

My sneakers crush on a collage of brown and red leaves that already began to fall as I stroll to my favorite coffee shop before class. My 6-year old Northface backpack is strung along my back as I shove my hands into the pockets of my small puffer. 

I chuckle softly at the memory of receiving this puffer for Christmas last year, my mother accidentally bought a women’s jacket, 4 sizes too small on me and we had to wait in line the day after Christmas to return it. How did she manage to buy a female weather, I don’t know, but we always spent the holidays together- just me and her.

 My mother’s face comes into mind and my lids flutter shut to remember the soft creases near her eyes when she smiles, as if the skin is used to being folded over and over again like an origami swan. And the freckles that are sprinkled around her cheeks and nose from the years of sunlight she has endured due to her poor knowledge of sunscreen. Her dark, black hair fans her face, similar to mine, but from the years of being away, I think it’s mostly gray now. 

I can practically smell her signature dish of yakisoba at the thought of her. 

I shake my head and smile, and just then, a loud honk in front of me lifts my head. 

A shiny black sedan stops in front of Crescent, and the driver steps out from his side and walks around. He opens the door, and a girl steps out. She has brown hair, like pure chocolate, and a petite face. She holds a backpack, wearing the same uniform required- Mohangy blazer as me and a khaki skirt. 

She’s cute, I think, but when she turns to my direction, her gaze lands on me. Her eyes lock with mine and I feel cold suddenly, as if it started snowing and I was wearing nothing but my shorts, on the verge of hypothermia. 

Her eyes were hazel, but seemed like spears that sent an unsettling chill down my spine. She had side bangs that only framed the side of her face, and her skin was so fair like a porcelain doll on a shelf, pretty, but off limits because of how fragile it was.. Her lips were pulled tight in a thin line, but I could see that they were light pink, just like her cheeks from standing in the autumn wind. 

I felt my heart stop beating for a mere second because I think, I mean I know, she is strikingly beautiful. A kind of beauty that is both haunting and alluring, and I’m not quite sure if she is one or the other. 

I don’t know how I must’ve looked, probably stupid, but just then she blinked like she snapped out of a trance. Her driver was to her right as she was facing me but I could only see him from my peripheral view as he was speaking something inaudible to her. 

As soon as she remembered where she was, she glanced at me again, but this time, with her eyebrows knitted like she was glaring at me. 

I couldn’t help but laugh. She looked like a kitten who was ready to pounce. 

At the sight of my laughter, she whips her head the other way and turns to walk into the coffee shop. 

I don’t think twice before following her in. 

I was already going there anyways. Wasn’t I? 

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

She was already seated at the booth by the far right of the shop right next to the big glass windows, facing the door. She’s reading something, a book pressed flat on the table and her hot drink in hand. I wonder how she got her drink so fast, it looks busy. 

I wait in line and ordered a hot latte, which took about 3 minutes. I looked at my watch. 

8:11 am. Still 20 minutes to go before school starts. I grab my coffee from the pickup counter and look around for an empty seat. 

People are chatting, work-from-home employees are typing away on their laptops, and businessmen are sipping from their drinks as they scroll on their phones. 

I sigh. My eyes made way to the only seat open in the shop. The only seat in front of the girl. Double sigh, now I have to sit next to Ms. Ice Queen. Either that or I’m back in the cold. 

I mean I could just stand there but then I would look *so awkward.* Or I could hide in the bathroom stalls, but then I would have to inhale the fumes of whoever was in there last. 



I muster up my courage and make my way to her little corner of the cafe. I stop right in front of her, hoping she will notice. 

She doesn’t look up from her book. 

I clear my throat. 

Nothing. 

I clear my throat again. Shit, that’s gotta have caused a rip. 

She finally looks up, and I’m face-to-face with those striking hazel eyes again. At first, my breath hitches, and I don’t say anything. 

She continues to stare at me, her expression bored and annoyed, waiting for me to speak. 

I don’t realize that I’m staring, so I start stuttering. 

“Um, uh, so I notice there’s an empty seat in front of you…” I start. *Come on, Akito, spit it out, you fool.* 

She blinks slowly and looks back down at her book. “Thanks for telling me, genius.” Her voice sounds cool and husky, like she doesn’t use it often, only when she needs to. 



Can’t relate. 



I raise my eyebrows. “Okay, well, there aren’t any empty seats in the cafe, so could I sit here?” 



She looks up from her book again and glances around the room before returning to her book. 



“There’s an empty seat next to that guy.” 



I look at the guy she was talking about, and he gives me a toothless smile and waves. I smile back awkwardly. 



“Come on, are you really gonna make me sit next to the homeless dude? He seems sweet, but I really don’t want to give up my cash right now.” 



Her lips twitched with the faintest smirk. “Huh, I thought you were one of them.”



I knit my eyebrows. “What do you mean?” 



Without looking up, she says, “The homeless dude. I thought you guys were family.” 



“Are you saying I look homeless?”



“Yeah.” 



“Well, I’m not.”



“With that outfit, it’s hard to tell. 



I start feeling annoyance bubble up in me. “Okay, Elsa, at least I’m not trying to be mysterious reading in a cafe, you might as well read at a concert.” 

“My name’s not Elsa.”



“Are you sure? Because I swore I saw you shooting ice out of your hands with that cold attitude.” 



She suddenly slams her book shut and closes her eyes. 



My eyes widen. *Uh, oh. Too far?* 



She stands up, grabs her backpack from the chair it was hanging from, and steps to the side of me, walking straight to the door. 









I rush out the door, chasing her. 



She has already made it halfway across the street before I shout, “Wait!” 



She keeps walking, unbothered. 



I run ahead of her, stopping her on the sidewalk. 



“Wait,” I say, panting and hunching over slightly. Man, my stamina sucks. 



She looks at me, stoic with no emotion in sight. She stares at me like a child who has received the same Christmas gift over and over again, a little excited but with low expectations. 



She arches one eyebrow and waits for me to speak.



“Look. I’m sorry,” I finally spit out. My breathing has slowed but I am still huffing. “Whatever I said back there, I didn’t mean it. It was cold, and I really didn’t want to go back outside, and I was stupid. I didn’t mean to take it out on you.” 



She studies me for a second. Her face was stoic without emotion. 



Then she says, “Cute. Did you practice that?” She side steps me again and continues walking towards our school. 



I stand there a little confused. “W-wait!” I call out again. I run in front of her. 



“Look, we’re classmates. See?” I pull on my mahogany blazer with our school name on the breast pocket. 



“And?” She retorts. 



“Anddd, let’s start over.” I stick out my hand. “I’m Akito.”



She continues to stare me with a bored expression until it starts to become awkward,  so I slowly bring it down. Feeling even more awkward, I start awkwardly rubbing my neck. “What’s your name?” 



She squints at me ever so slightly, like she is trying to figure out my true intention. After what seems like forever, she hesitates before saying, “Emery.”



“Nice to meet you, Emery,” I say with a soft smile. 



She glances at me for a split second before side-stepping me for what seems like the third time and walking straight ahead. 



*Okay….* 



I stare at her back as she walks away. Her chocolate brown hair sways back and forth as the wind twirls it around. “I’ll see you around sometime at school!” I shout. 



She doesn’t bother to acknowledge that she heard me; she just keeps walking. 



I chuckle. *Oh well, at least I tried.* I start walking towards the opposite direction, the longer route to school. 









Emery: 



What I don’t get is laughter. 



The girls next to me in class are squealing like pigs that were just served their morning meal, gossiping and snickering about the hottest boy in school. They have their hands covering their mouths as if it conceal the deafening noise, playfully smacking each other when one says something outrageous. 



It makes me sick. 



I don’t understand *why* laughter is even an emotion. It’s nauseating, like someone fueled you up with vinegar and then poured baking soda in you, making it bubble up inside you until you can’t control it anymore, and it finally explodes in disgusting waves of high-pitched hiccups. 



This is why I remained aloof. 



Why need them when I can sulk in isolation, choosing what I want to do when I want to do it, without having the nuisance of someone following me around and begging for my attention like a desperate little pet? 



Just like whatever his name was from this morning. 



I’m not stupid. I’ve heard the rumors. 



Almost everyone at this wretched high school taunts me with their mocking names that only their imbecilic brains could come up with. If they spent half the time they used to make fun of me to improve their pathetic lives, maybe just maybe they could gain a couple brain cells.

Exactly 1.5 hours after I take it, BOOM. Nature doesn’t call, it issues an eviction notice. If I’m not near a toilet, I’m filing for disaster relief.

She’s a stylist and she has this one male client who kept sending her texts that were not related to haircut services, like playlists. She left those all on read and never replied. But on one occasion he offered to bring her coffee which she agreed to and it was a bit of a playful conversation. He said something along the lines of “hey would you like a coffee?” She said “from where?” And then joked “from my house jk” then she said “you’re killing me” then he said “not yet but if you keep talking like this I might” then she said “woah woah woah take it down a notch.” He ended up bringing her a coffee and proceeded to mess with her and send some needy ass texts like “looks like you don’t want me to come get a haircut anymore” which she just left on read. But he was getting way too comfortable even calling her by the nickname “guera.” And she wasn’t putting a full stop to it. Then a few days later I logged into her insta and it was mostly clear except in one conversation WITH A FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS THAT SHE DUMPED BEFORE SHE MET ME. There were 3 messages from him all fire emoji story replies but not for selfies it was for her haircuts, she replied to the story replies with just double tap like and on one she typed out thank you, I mean it’s not cheating or flirting but still why even reply to a previous friends with benefits when you’re married? We have talked about it a few times and at least 3 times she has said it was really fucked up, she messed up big time, it was leaving a door cracked for people who don’t deserve her energy, it was wrong and now she understands how even these small little things are disrespectful to our marriage. She says I’m the only one she wants. She immediately removed them off ig and blocked phone numbers without me having to ask. BUT they’re not blocked on ig they’re just removed and she has her ig on private. I have since made my boundaries clear and told her this will never happen again cause I’m a goner, im also going to ask her to block them on ig as well.

1o9qejm,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvicecanada/comments/1o9qejm/i_had_a_completely_unnecessary_wellness_check/,I had a completely unnecessary wellness check called on me,"I’ll try to keep this short but add some context. 

So this happened a few months ago but I’d like to know a couple things. 

I’m going through a divorce and found out some things I really didn’t like and was very upset about, there was some talking and yelling and just generally being pissed off but regardless, I was fine in the grand scheme of things (none of this was in the presence of the ex by the way) 

I went for a drive just to clear my head, go to the bank and talk to my lawyer, maybe grab a coffee. Well in the mean time, someone in my family took it upon themselves to call the police on me for a wellness check. Later found out they were looking for me all over the city and the country side and never found me but I was literally sitting in a car wash, washing my vehicle. I never did end up going to the lawyer because the police called me and wanted to talk which, even though I was absolutely fuming, I agreed to. 

Met with the police and had a good talk. I asked what the hell this was even about and blah blah. They told me someone called but they don’t know why, as I was perfectly fine and not under the influence or anything and I just laughed kind of knowing what I later found out.

I saw the text messages from my ex to my mother a couple days later basically convincing her and convincing her to call the police on me for a wellness check and feeding her complete lies as to why. Not even believable lies either, anyways, I guess my main question is, did she do all of this BS and get the police called on me so it looks better for her in court with the divorce? We have two kids. I really feel like that was her motive. It’s already basically ruined any reputation I have and I hardly talk to lots of my family anymore and they treat me differently, I think the majority of my friends aren’t friends anymore. This has taken a toll on my life. Is this in a way, defamation or something along those lines? 

Thanks for reading and I hope to get some incite from some of you on here.

I know this might be a big thing for everyone but it is for us - the team. We have been making movies in Nagpur for the past 7 years & this is the first time our film has made it to cinemas. We gave this entire year to making this film, we have covered nagpur completely in the film. 

Getting it to the big screen was a big task in itself with no nepo stars, small town crew, political upheaval of Nagpur film (scam) industry. 

Please do go and watch the film if it’s possible. It doesn’t matter if the movie recovers or tanks but we know that we have made a great story and all we hope is people go and see the film. 

if the screens fill fast we will be able to secure more screens. So a humble request, the price is worth 2 coffees & 1hr 50mins of yours.
BookMyShow has already started listing for shows available in AM Cinemas.

These days, I rely on black coffee especially French press for its full-bodied flavor and to help me stay fasted during the day.

I’m now looking for a tea that can match the intensity, aroma, and ritual of a French press brew. Not chai. Not green tea. Something that feels like a proper substitute for black coffee in terms of depth and flavor.

Some folks have suggested starting with Assam Unorthodox. I’m open to exploring bold, rich teas that can be brewed similarly to coffee (French press preferred). Any recommendations for teas that deliver that kind of punch and complexity?

So yeah, we finally had the date. We took the train out to a forest, walked and talked for hours, sat down with coffee and snacks, just great chemistry.

When we got back, she said her bike was broken and offered to walk me home, even though that’s totally out of her way. At my door, I asked if she wanted to meet my cat (I’ve mentioned him a lot), and she said yes.

We ended up talking on the couch for hours, then went grocery shopping, cooked together, ate, and talked until after midnight. She kept saying she should go, but then kept finding excuses to stay.

And yeah… I know I could’ve kissed her. Probably multiple times. But I froze.

At the end, I told her that I’d really like to see her again but wanted to take things slow since we study together, and she agreed.

Now I’m just not sure if she’s confused about my intentions, since she clearly showed hers. So… did I mess it up by not kissing her? Or is taking it slower alright?",2,1760775302.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

These are in order of album releases. The majority of these are expensive designer perfumes, BUT dupes are easy to find. !!MOST ARE ME GOING OFF NOTES, I HAVE NOT SMELLED MOST OF THESE, DONT BLIND BUY, RESEARCH BEFOREHAND!!)*

*Also beware of the amount of Tom Ford...guys got the most perfumes that fit Lana than I've ever seen. This is long, too 🤦🏻‍♀️ i also had to post this here because i was left hangin on moderator approval in r/lanadelrey... 😣*

**SIRENS (May Jailer demo album)** — this is a softer album, so I'm thinking a soft, white floral perfume, with some oceanic notes?  Juliette Has a Gun's *Not a Perfume* is very fitting. Its clean, musky, and woody. Its supposed to blend in with your natural body chemistry, so it likely won't smell the same on everyone (like every perfume). Fine'ry *Without a Trace* or Phlur's *Missing Person* are very alike, but provide the soft scent. I've smelled *Without a Trace*, and it's a very soft, warm musk with, again, a clean scent. I'm not entirely sure about *Missing Person*, though! Calvin Klein *Eternity Air* (women) also seems very fitting. Bergamot, white lily, and white rose, and bottom notes of sandalwood, amber, and musk. A perfume that i just recently bought from the dollar tree is Yardley's *English Rose*. Very rosy, but it's light and not overbearing. I genuinely can ONLY smell the rose, nothing else. No strong, alcohol smell, no other notes. Just pure rose essential oil. Very good for a cheap light rose scent that LASTS. Like I said, it's strong, but not overbearing-strong, it's strong like you can SMELL it. (I literally sprayed it in my bedroom and I could still smell it 10 mins later)

**A.K.A** — This is more complex. Definitely something peach, or a summer/fruity scent. My picks are *Bitter Peach* by Tom Ford and *Sweet Sunrise* by Body Fantasies. Body Fantasies fits that queen of the gas station trailer park queen vibe. But she's also had that biker gang, jazz club vibe. This perfume will come up again, but *Jazz Club* by Maison Margiela's Replica fits it very well. Its grown up, but 'edgy.' *Mon Paris* by YSL is also kinda fitting, too. I haven't smelled this perfume, but Heretic's *Dirty Rose* seems fitting, as well. Its dark, but has pink pepper, vanilla, and rose. But if we want a more basic scent since Lana said she liked basic scents like Vanilla when younger — Lancôme *La Vie Est Belle Vanilla Nude*. Its not **overly** sweet vanilla, I can definitely smell some sort of white musk and soft woody note. Its warm and simple, and lasts ALLLLLL DAY. Or for me it does, at least. Tom Ford *Tobacco Vanille* for a more mature vanilla. A cherry scent is always good and classic, too. Overall notes to look for: fruity, floral, and dark. Peachy, something with violets or lilac, tobacco and leather.

**BORN TO DIE** — My second fav album to talk about, even though this is shorter. Its very old americana, but also old hollywood, Las Vegas, etc.  Based, but a dark cherry scent is just perf for this, Tom Ford *Lost Cherry*. *Chanel N°5* fits the classy, old Hollywood glamor vibe, but it kinda gives me rich grandma in a way?? 😭 But it still smells SOO good. Estee Lauder *AERIN Tuberose Gardenia* seems pretty fitting — tuberose, gardenia, carnation, vanilla. Seems a very luxurious white floral scent? (I'm actually married to the flower Gardenia btw I love love love it). More cherry scents are YSL *Black Opium Red*, Phlur *Cherry Stem*. Two more are Tom Ford *Tobacco Vanille* (again) and Dior *Poison Girl*. More classier/old scents are *White Diamonds* by Elizabeth Taylor, *Fracas* by Robert Piguet, *L’Interdit* by Givenchy (made for Audrey Hepburn!) Going back to that Las Vegas vibe — Baccarat *Rouge 540*. Maison Margiela's *Lipstick On* also reminds me of Summertime Sadness for some reason 😭😭 There was also a literal diet coke scented perfume, but I cannot find it for the life of me 😕

**ULTRAVIOLENCE** — GAHHHHH my first favorite album to talk about 😫. I like the melancholic, rough, gritty vibe of this — but the sensual melodies are gorgeous, too. Its kind of like a juxtaposition? The melancholic, sad lyrics compared to the hypnotic melody/instrumentals are why I love the album sm, aside from how much I relate to it. I think of rough notes mixed with light and floral notes for Ultraviolence, so I'll just plainly state some perfumes i think fit perfectly. Tom Ford *Tuscan Leather*, Tom Ford *Black Orchid*, Tom Ford *Black Opium* (people say it's very coffee-like and gourmand, but I personally didn't get that when I smelled it? Idk, but it still smells very pleasant), Viktor & Rolf *Spicebomb Dark Leather*, Maison Margiela's *Jazz Club* (told you it'd come back), and *Little Black Dress* by Avon.

**HONEYMOON** — love love love this album. Its very vintage and jazz inspired, but also nostalgic and dark(?). All of her albums are very floral-heavy, so I'll say it again. I think of powdery scents, florals (especially dark or white), musks and soft woody scents, spices, etc. The first one I picked is *Honeymoon* by HDYS Parfum. Its very Salvatore, but it's very sweet (Sicilian cannoli), but it was worth mentioning with the name and the Italian-inspired gourmand-woodsy scent.  Serge Lutens' *Fleurs d'Oranger* is a white floral scent with orange blossoms as the most noticeable note, but it also has animalic undertones such as civet and cumin, which may not be pleasant for everyone. Guerlain's *Samsana* is full of jasmine, sandalwood, and ylang-ylang (jasmine + Ylang-ylang is an absolutely gorgeous mix to me, I love love love it.). Romantic and heavy. Tom Ford *Jasmin Rouge* is jasmine, spices, leather, and amber. Very lush and dark. Maison Francis Kurkdjian's *À la Rose* is very floral with citrus and woodsy notes, but it's more reflective than dark. Very *Terrence Loves You*-esque. Narciso Rodriguez's *For her* has notes of musk, rose, patchouli, and amber. Softer, but melancholic and sensual.

**LUST FOR LIFE** — Any cherry scent i named before could fit the song Cherry, but also any of the other fruits/scents she mentioned (peaches, roses, rosemary, wine???) *Chloé Eau de Parfum* has soft, airy rose with peony and lychee. Very feminine, sweet, and wistful. Diptyque's *Do Son*; tuberose, orange blossom, musk, and a salty breeze. Feels cinematic,  but also light, sensual, and serene. Very fitting for 13 Beaches.  Jo Malone's *Peony & Blush Suede* is a lot of gentle florals with a hint of fruity notes and a subtle suede undertone. Romantic and modern-vintage!! *Gucci Bloom*; soft white florals like jasmine, tuberose, and Rangoon creeper. Vibrant but soft and dreamy, kinda like a California garden? This is a more indie brand, but Floraïku's *I See the Clouds Go By* notes feel like the smell of summer rain?? 😭😭 The notes of blackcurrant, cherry blossom, white musk are 😚🤌🏻.

**NORMAN F***ING ROCKWELL!** —. I'm gonna be quick with this one since I am TIRED, but I'll name the notes they have. Maison Margiela's *Lazy Sunday Morning*; White musk, iris, and soft florals. Byredo's *Gypsy Water*; Cedar, sandalwood, lemon, vanilla, and pine needles. DS & Durga's *Radio Bombay*; MY FAVVV. Warm sandalwood, amber, peach, coconut, iris. Diptyque's *Tam Dao*; Dry sandalwood, cedar, rosewood. Meditative and minimalist.  Guerlain's *L’Heure Bleue*; Vintage violet, anise, iris, vanilla. Jo Malone's *Wood Sage & Sea Salt*; Driftwood, sea salt, sage. Airy and clean, like a California ocean winddd. Maison Louis Marie's *No.04 Bois de Balincourt*; Sandalwood and cedar with soft amber! 

MISC — Maison Margiela's *Beach Walk* could fit Sirens and UV's Florida Kilos. *Angel's Share* by Kilian could fit pretty much any album I just named, but specifically honeymoon, Ultraviolence, or Born to Die. Its very boozy, woody, spicy, but warm. 

yayayayay I'm done finally!!  I know I didnt include COTCC, BB, or DYKTTATUOB, but I'll probably edit this and add it later since I'm EXHAUSTED.  I tried my best on this 😭😭 but I hope it helps a lot of people looking for perfumes/scents that match Lana's albums!! I love talking about perfumes and matching perfumes to a certain book, movie, song, album, etc etc, it's rlly fun. I didn't mean for this to be so long, but I wanted to include as many perfumes as I could and describe their vibe and scent 💔💔 I lowkey wish she'd release her own perfume/fragrance line 😓

ALSO; good dupe brands to look at are: Oakcha, Fine'ry (Target....), and Dossier!! Its also worth to note that many of these can also likely be bought on eBay, Facebook Marketplace, Etsy, etc. It's ALSO worth to note that, like I said at the top, some perfumes may not be for everyone, and they won't smell the same for everyone!! Please go and look at reviews, smell them yourself, look deeper into the notes before buying!! I'll probably add more niche/underground perfumes to this later on, but this is all I have for now — byebye!! 😚",2,1760775249.0,lanitas,0,1.0,False
