1g0rwlq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g0rwlq,Mock Turtle Soup - S4E16,"This is such a minor and insignificant detail, but I was just watching ""The Reigning Lorelai"" yesterday (the one where Gran dies and all Richard wants is the ""turtleneck soup"" Trix used to have made for him when he was a boy). Emily says she can't find anyone who knows what it is, and Sookie says, ""maybe he means mock turtle soup - I think I have a recipe for that somewhere."" Lorelai tells Emily she's on the soup, and Emily is so grateful. Sookie then comes out holding the book in the picture. Instantly, I recognized it. I just bought that same book at a used book store a couple of weeks ago! It's Larousse Gastronomique - a culinary encyclopedia. The book was actually right in front of me on my coffee table while I was watching Sookie hold it. I pulled it out and flipped to the index and, sure enough, there is a recipe for mock turtle soup. I flipped to the right page in the book, which is pretty close to the end of the book, and it even seems like Sookie was holding the book open at roughly the right page given how you can see that she's near the end. I just thought that was such a cool detail that they actually had this real book with a real recipe for mock turtle soup, and they even had her open the book to that page! Also, I posted a picture of the recipe from the book I have, and I have to say there is an added layer of possibly accurate detail. If you read the page I posted, it explains that turtle meat was an expensive luxury, so poorer households would make mock turtle soup instead (which you can see uses a calf's head instead of turtle meat...vom) to mimick the great taste for cheaper. In the episode, no one has heard of turtle neck soup. So they assume Richard means mock turtle soup. But he grew up wealthy. So he probably did have actual turtleneck soup and was not just confused on what the name was. Since Sookie didn't grow up wealthy or cook for the ultra wealthy, she was only familiar with mock turtle soup.",1,1728590925.0,GilmoreGirls,0,1.0,False

My phone did not record the last half of team vine, where Casey talks further about what texts were considered as a departure of doctrine with the Network. Teaching: 1 Peter 5:1-5. Spent a lot of time talking about domineering without naming any names in the network. Spent a lot of time about how the sheep shepherd other sheep until Jesus returns and how the \[global\] church makes mistakes in the process. I did not receive ""permission"" to share or have his notes, so I'm trying my best to listen to the incredibly low-quality audio that was recorded by my phone. No, you may not have the recording.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Questions received by Casey about the church leaving the Network of Churches\]

‚ÄúIs there a formal relationship with The Network?‚Äù

And the answer is, we don't have a formal relationship with the network at all. Okay, we previously gave five percent of our tithes to support the work of the network. At this point, we don't give any money, we don't go to any retreats or conferences. We don't have any leaders \[at any other churches\], we don't have any formal relationship with the network at all. Until our new bylaws are approved, we have officially removed all Network authority over our local church, from our current bylaws. And so, like so many of you, many of our pastors and staff have friends that are part of other local churches in the network. And of course, we maintain those relationships. But we don‚Äôt have any formal relationship at all

‚ÄúWhat is our relationship to other churches who have left the Network?‚Äù

Same thing -¬† we don't have any formal relationship with them at all. We don't give them any money, we don't have any retreats or conferences scheduled and we don't have any leaders there as well. We are all learning how to be independent churches. And so, we chat a little bit from time to time and try to figure that out. Um, again, no formal relationship with any of them.¬†

‚ÄúWill we ever join another group of churches in the future?‚Äù

We don't have any plans to do that at this point. We are still focused on what it needs to be an independent local church, and we've got our work cut out for us for some time. We are trying to learn from other churches, but we don't have any plans to be affiliated with other churches at this point. If we did do that in the future, it would not be at the expense of local church autonomy, that is authority would still rest in our local church, and there's ways of being a part of organizations, associations, and the like where we can retain local church autonomy. So, no plans to do any of that at this point.

‚ÄúHow is Vine‚Äôs position on church governance and church leadership, different from what it's been in the past.‚Äù¬†

In the past, there was Authority over the local church in the network. Uh, there were area coaches, as a network leadership team, there's a network leader. They could be involved in the removal and the appointment of board members and pastors. I can read to you from our old bylaws here - a couple of things. It says, ‚ÄúThe Network exists to offer coaching training relationship, support and accountability to the local churches‚Äù and ‚Äúchurches in this Network agree to function under the coaching and Leadership of the network leadership team.‚Äù This whole idea is predicated upon the belief that apostolic teams can oversee multiple local churches - which is why last month at our team meeting, I tried to show you that trans-local governing authority, we believe, ceased with the ‚Äúcapital A‚Äù Apostles. In The Network, it's agreed that everybody has a leader that you can trust and should follow and relational leadership is implemented but without clear parameters.

And so the thing that is different now, is that we believe authority rests with the local church plurality of elders. And the authority of the local church plurality of elders rests within the parameters of the Bible. Okay? So, the authority rests with the local church plurality of elders and the authority of the local church plurality of elders rests within the parameters of the Bible. Okay. So it's not that the authority is in the lead Pastor or in the board of overseers, but all of the elders who come together for every major decision, and I'll talk more about that in just a moment. And that the authority of the local church plurality of Elders is not in the men, but in the word of God. I think I said something to the effect last month of ‚Äúall authority in heaven, and on Earth belongs to Jesus, right?‚Äù And that would include the authority over his church. And so, all authority in the church belongs to Jesus.

We'll see tonight in 1 Peter, he's the chief Shepherd. Paul says he \[Jesus\] is the head of the body, all authority belongs to Jesus and he mediates his authority in his church, through his word and he has entrusted his word to a plurality of elders who are qualified according to the Bible. And so that's how we understand authority to work itself out in the local church. And so we believe the elders are to teach the word of God as instruction to the church and to live the word of God, as an example to the church.¬†

Anything beyond the scope of the Bible is in the realm of Christian Liberty, where individuals have to make their own decisions based on their biblically informed consciences. And so in short, we don't believe that authority is external, but local, in the plurality of Elders within the parameters of the Bible and we've been operating that way for some time now. And so that may not seem like it's any difference in what you're used to because we've been going with that for some time.

‚ÄúHow will our Elders be held accountable?‚Äù¬†

This is a really good question. ‚ÄòCause in the past there was a provision for that at the network level. So how will our elders be held accountable? If you recall last month, we talked about how the Ephesian Elders were commended by the Apostle Paul to God and the word of his grace. Under the authority of God and his will is revealed to us in the word of his grace. And I believe those things are to be enforced by a statement of faith and character qualifications contained in the Bible and those are all what we're working out and will be forthcoming in our new bylaws. A Statement of Faith, our Doctrine, has to be sound. And character qualifications, we have to be men who are above approach, okay?

That's the idea and we're held accountable by those things. That would also say that the elders are accountable to the other Elders. That's why it's a plurality and not a singularity. If there's just one Pastor or one Elder, then he's sort of free to do whatever he wants. A plurality requires us to be accountable to one another and it's an equality not a hierarchy within the plurality of Elders, right? Mutually submitted to God and to his word and to one another. Brothers mutually submitted to one another with a strong emphasis on sound doctrine, that statement of faith. A sincere commitment to obedience to Jesus, those character qualifications. And then also a strong emphasis on love for one another.¬†

I love the timing God in his Providence, has brought us to John chapters 13 & 14 \[in Sunday service\] during this time. And you think about Jesus in the upper room with the 11 who were left over. Those guys have no idea at that point of what's going to happen, do they? I mean they're just beginning to get an idea of what Jesus is going to do with them. And he keeps telling them over and over and over - Love one another. Because he knows they're going to be the leaders of the church. And in order for their Unity to be maintained, they have to have love for one another. Uh, our pastors are currently reading a book called *Agape Leadership* about the life of a pastor who so exemplified love for one another. And I've just been so encouraged by our elders and Love for one another. And we maintain our unity on the basis of sound Doctrine and our love for one other. We hope to make decisions by consensus, but we will have to settle for a majority if that is the case, right? If there's no majority, if we're 4-4, 5-5, 6-6, 7-7, or something like that, we're going to devote ourselves to prayer and study until we can get a majority. That's our hope, that's our goal. I trust that the Lord will lead us in that and that'll be okay.¬†

But I'm also curious to talk with other Elders of local churches to learn more. There's men in Southern Illinois that I really respect. And I'm eager to learn from them on this question as well, and see what wisdom they have to help us with as we move forward. So, Elders are accountable to the other elders and I would even suggest to you that, the elders are accountable substance to the members.

That's why I was telling you guys last time, ‚ÄúYou got to kick us in the shins if we need it,‚Äù right? The elders are accountable to the members. Members can bring a charge against an elder. This is 1 Timothy 5:19-20 where Paul writing to Timothy says do not admit a charge against an elder except on the evidence of two or three Witnesses. As for those who persist in sin, rebuke them in the presence of all so that the rest may stand in fear. Look, if the elders get out of line, one of the elders is off track in doctrine or in character who believe we're in lifestyle\[?\], then a couple of you should come and say something about it and deal with it. There is an accountability to the members there and I would even say that the members can be involved in the process of appointing new Elders. We want to be a church that's elder-led, elder governed, and member involved. More on this topic next month at Team Vine. And the process will be laid out in my new bylaws.

If we're asking you to submit to and obey \[re:Sept. Team Vine\], or as Peter will say, be subject to the elders, if you can bring a charge against an existing Elder, it makes sense that you can weigh in on prospective Elders to ensure that they are biblically qualified. It's one of the ways of testing Elders in the church.

""What is the role of the board of overseers?""

A board of overseers is a requirement to be a 501c3 organization in the state of Illinois. And in the past, the board made decisions pertaining to what you might call a human resources or financial resources; hiring/firing, how to allocate resources for ministry purposes in the development of a budget, those types of things. But as we'll see in 1 Peter tonight, in the Bible, you just have Elders. And, you know, there's some Shepherds and Shepherds are Elders. You don't necessarily have this distinction between those who rule and those who shepherd or Pastor, they're all kind of doing all of the above. That's the job as it's committed to us or the responsibility or task as it's presented to us in the Bible.

And so, we envision elders designating other elders to develop an operating budget and allocate resources. In a large church like ours, all of the elders can't do everything. Even if they're weighing in on every major decision, all of the elders can't do everything, and some things are going to correspond to certain elders‚Äô gifts and abilities more so than others. And so, the Plurality of Elders can designate specific Elders to do specific tasks and then to bring that back to the rest of the elders for their consideration. Does that make sense? And so we envision that taking place in the future when it comes to what historically has been something that's just reserved for the Board when it comes to human and financial resources in the church.

And one of the things that's so wonderful about this is that a diversity of spiritual gifts and a diversity of perspectives always leads to better decisions. \[unintelligible - The stations I told you guys last night been slow\]. But as we've done this, we always end up with better decisions than we would have otherwise, and I'm grateful for that. And I think sometimes God has designed it this way, to slow us down. It can be in the best interest of the church, if that's the case. The major decisions that we want to involve all the elders on would be things pertaining to our Doctrine, the appointment of new Elders or new deacons, the hiring of new staff members, instances of church discipline, or perhaps even large expenses not contained within the operating budget. And we would have board members that are non-staff Elders, who can help to set compensation for our employees. And all of this will satisfy the requirements for the state of Illinois. Hopefully that clears up some of the questions about the role of the board of overseers.

‚ÄúWhat does this mean moving forward? What is going to change?‚Äù

You know that the network of churches has agreed that everyone should follow the same model for doing church and the model was created so that church Planters would not have to reinvent the wheel. There could be a simple way of doing church, that would work in all kinds of different cultures, so that churches can plant and do well without having to reinvent the wheel. And the model is always checked with the Bible to ensure that the model was not unbiblical. For us, the elders are going to look into the Bible for how to do church. So it's not so much checking our model with the Bible, but looking to the Bible *for* our model. Okay? We believe the Bible is sufficient for all things, including how to do church. And so we're looking to the scriptures for our model.¬†

What is going to change? Well, we will be governed locally and not externally. And there are some deviations from the way we do Church from the model of doing church in The Network we previously belonged to. Some of those you are already aware of: expository preaching has replaced topical preaching for the most part. We're not following the topical curriculum for small groups, necessarily. We had 24 topics that rotated every two years and your leaders would sort of follow through that. And uh, we're not necessarily doing that. Some groups are going along with Sunday sermons, some groups are dealing with topics that seem to be relevant for their particular small group, some groups are going through other books of the Bible. We are not following the topical curriculum for small group discussions. And we're doing something we've never done in the past, which is holding more men's and women's gatherings for discipleship and relationship, which has been fun by the way. I couldn‚Äôt believe all of you fellas showing up. We had almost 150 guys here early in the morning this week. We were spread out in the coffee house and people just kept coming in and it was standing room only Thursday morning at 6 a.m. when it was pitch black dark outside. I'm like all right boys, come on out and study the bible. We're really enjoying that and so far we've seen that to be very profitable when it comes to discipleship and relationship in our church.

In addition to that, our pastors are taking some classes to be better equipped to lead with the Bible. Um, some of you know that I have a Master of Arts in Biblical and Theological Studies which is a mouthful - it‚Äôs a MABTS. Master of Arts in Biblical and Theological Studies. The program I was in, there's two tracks. One was called the exegetical track. - I know if you weren't asleep yet you would be - the other was uh, the theology track. Okay, so the exegetical track you had to take all the Hebrew and Greek. So three classes of Hebrew and three classes of Greek. I took the exegetical track, okay? And those were some long semesters, but I didn't have a full-on Master of Divinity, an MDiv, which is the typical degree that most Pastors have. But I am looking forward to filling some gaps in my own education that I didn't get when I was in seminary years ago and learning some of those things that I didn't get a chance to learn.

So far, all of our pastors have taken a class on hermeneutics from Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary. If you are not familiar with hermeneutics, it is the art and science of biblical interpretation. So they've all completed that some have completed others; we've got plans to continue our education because we believe that the authority is in the word of God. And our primary duty is to teach you and to live out the word of God. And so we want to become as trained and equipped as we possibly can to serve you well. Okay, so that's something that we're undertaking right now.

And then one other thing that I've already alluded to which I'll talk more in the future about, we only have so much time tonight, but our membership process will be updated to more closely reflect the teaching of the New Testament on membership. And I'm tempted to go into that, but it will take us a long time. And so, you can ask me at 6:00 a.m. on Thursday or between services on Sunday or whatever. \[unintelligible\] I can talk with you about that.¬†

And then, lastly, numbers of people have asked, ‚ÄúWill we continue to plant churches, Lord willing?‚Äù

Absolutely. Yes, absolutely. Yes. I quite frankly have never been more zealous to start new healthy, local churches if they're needed so badly. Churches where Godly men will be honest and straightforward and teach the Bible. Verse by verse, live out exemplary lives for other people and preach the gospel of Jesus. We are all about that. And we're willing to continue to do that. We do believe that the purpose of the local church is to make disciples and Jesus defined disciples as those who observe all that he is commanded. Okay? So our primary goal Is to teach people to observe all that he's commanded.

\[unintelligible\] Godly people, holy people, mature Christians. That's what we're aiming to do here at Vine church. But we trust that even if multiplication isn't our goal, then maturity is. Maturity will eventually lead to multiplication. So that's our plan. Moving forward, there may be other questions. As I mentioned before, we are happy to answer any and all questions you may have. But those are the main main \[questions\] we're getting and I hope that I hope that helps to clear some things up for you guys.

How do I get him to listen to me? ,"My husband only listens to his mom for stuff he isn‚Äôt inclined to do. I mean, he listens to me about all sorts of low stakes things, but when he sets his mind of doing something his way, nothing I say seems to matter. 

Lately, he has been leaving our kids (4&2) in the car while he gets coffee at Dunkin‚Äô Donuts or drops one at school. And I told him he can‚Äôt do that, it‚Äôs illegal, you can get a criminal record if someone sees you doing that etc. He doesn‚Äôt listen. A few weeks ago, he left my 4 year old in an urgent care center when he went a couple stores down in the strip mall to get some fast food. He told me the receptionist scolded him when he returned. 

I told him that‚Äôs what happens in the US. I figured he didn‚Äôt understand the rules since he is from a homogenous European country where I hear people do these kinds of things. I explain we don‚Äôt do this in America, but he doesn‚Äôt listen. 

Anyway, I guess he mentioned this to his mom on the phone, because I heard them shouting at the top of their lungs at length in their call. 

After the call, he tells me that his mom gave him a huge earful about leaving his kids in the car. So now he‚Äôs not going to do that anymore probably. 

But this is how it is with him. He will only do exactly what she scolded about and not listen to me about even closely related matters. 

I worry about who is going to rein him in when she dies, which is probably just a few years away. How do I get my husband to listen to me like he listens to his mom? ",1,1728590277.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

So for the past 5 years we've been friends and especially in the last 2 years it's been mainly just us hanging out and doing everything together. Sure we both have our own friends as well and we hang out with them too or we see each others friends no issues at all. But we've both been each others bestfriend and we'll talk about everything together, road trips, to just getting coffee most days. 

Recently she's got a boyfriend and I'm happy for her or course. I'm glad they get on well and everything. But right off the bat this guy hates me. Just straight up said he hates me. Said he doesn't trust me and he feels uncomfortable whenever me and her hang out. He said he wants to be her top priority instead of me and now suddenly we can't see eachother more than a couple times a weeks without him being annoyed by that. 

Now I get how he feels that a guy bestfriend can be a bit of a concern and I understand they want to have their own time together and I don't wanna make her be with me 24 7 cos I get when u have a bf or gf you want to spend a lot of time with eachother and I want them to have their own time. But I want him to trust me and we can get on. I don't want any issues. I just don't like the feeling of things not being the same anymore. I feel like I gotta make way for this new guy now and now they're doing all the things we used to do together and I don't hear from her nearly as much as I did. It just hurts a bit. In my previous relationships nothing changed with my friendships I always spoke to them and saw them just as often as I did before. I know what I'm saying may sound unreasonable. I get things change when you get into a relationship it can't always be me and her now. But I just wanted to express how I feel to people who may understand where I'm coming from.

Gender: Female
Height: 170 cm
Weight: 60 kg
Smoking status: light smoker
Alcohol: no alcohol consumption 
Medical History: Periradicular cysts at C7 (bilateral) and C8 (right), diagnosed before pregnancy. No diabetes, HIV, vitamin deficiencies (including B12). 
Medication: 30 mg of Cymbalta, 1200 mg of Gabapetin
Current Symptoms: Paresthesia (tingling, pins and needles), burning sensations (hands, feet, lips, hips), sharp pains (around shoulder blades), trembling sensation in legs. Symptoms worsen 1-2 hours after waking. 
 


I‚Äôm a 34-year-old mom, and I gave birth via C-section two months ago. Everything seemed fine after the birth, but a few weeks later, I began experiencing some really strange symptoms that I just can‚Äôt seem to get to the bottom of.

It started with tingling and pins and needles in my hands, feet, and fingers, as well as a burning sensation, almost like hot pins, mainly in my hands and feet, but sometimes even on my lips, hips and face. I also have sharp, stabbing pains around my shoulder blades, and my legs sometimes feel like they‚Äôre trembling.

These symptoms usually kick in about 1-2 hours after I wake up, often after simple activities like making coffee or hanging up laundry. Oddly enough, I feel fine when I first get out of bed. But as the day progresses, these sensations come and go, and it‚Äôs really starting to affect my day-to-day life.

Before my pregnancy, I was diagnosed with periradicular cysts on my spine (C7 bilaterally and C8 on the right), but they never caused any issues before. I‚Äôve seen two neurologists since these symptoms started. They ruled out carpal tunnel syndrome after doing an electromyography, and I‚Äôve had blood tests that came back normal for things like diabetes, HIV, and vitamin deficiencies (including B12). 

Additionally, I had MRIs of my brain, cervical spine, and thoracic spine, which revealed two demyelinating lesions on my brain. However, the doctors clearly stated that these lesions are not associated with multiple sclerosis

Despite all these tests, I‚Äôm still dealing with these sensations, and I haven‚Äôt found any relief. I was hoping the neurologists could give me answers, but I‚Äôve left feeling a bit disappointed because nothing concrete has come up.

From what I‚Äôve read, my symptoms seem to indicate neuropathy, and I‚Äôm wondering if the pregnancy or childbirth could have triggered it. Is it reversible, or should I expect these symptoms to be permanent?


So, I‚Äôm turning to this community to see if anyone has experienced anything similar, especially after a C-section or pregnancy. Could this be nerve-related or linked to the cysts on my spine? Or is it something else entirely? I‚Äôm open to any suggestions, insights, or experiences.

1g0rgs8,https://www.reddit.com/r/olivegarden/comments/1g0rgs8/worst_table_i_ever_served/,Worst Table I Ever Served,"I just wanted to share this story as I still get upset about it every now and then and refuse to take parties above 15+ anymore on my own because of it.

I get put on a 20 top with another server.

No big deal, I've served 20 tops before by myself. It will be taxing, maybe no tip, but it's really whatever. Well, the other server has an emergency and has to leave before the table is sat. Again, no big deal, I've done this before and service is usually pretty good on my part. Not perfect with that many people on my own, but pretty decent.

They sit. I immediately ask if this is where they will be sitting for the rest of the time as I need to start splitting checks (8 separate). They say yes. I come back, and they have started yelling at my manager about seating arrangements (I agree they were a little cramped but the way they went about it is not ok) and after she told them the extra tables were reserved for another party that was about to sit, they waited for her to walk away and sat themselves all over the party room.

They have 1, been disrespectful, and 2, messed up my check system at this point.

Before I can even ask nicely if they could move back to some unreserved tables they all start ordering margaritas (about 7) all at once, hot coffee, hot tea, and seven appetizers. All ordering at the same time and constantly talking over eachother.

I did my best to rearrange the checks again. Put everything in, come back for entree orders.

They've moved again.

At this point, I start having a panic attack. Like I am crying at the POS screen. I go out and take entree orders and they start asking about their margaritas and salads. They did tell me they all wanted salad at the beginning of the meal but I can't bring those out until entrees are ordered of course. Not to mention I am baking my own bread, brewing their coffee, and making hot tea. Bar doesn't have the drinks up but I'm majorly behind at this point anyway so I dont even care. I take orders to the best of my ability, everyone changes their mind at least once, and they all talk over eschother. The tab is 700 dollars and I have no idea how to begin splitting it. I can't even find a manager to help me with the situation I am so busy.

I have really bad anxiety so again this whole time I am very teary eyed and breathing really deeply to try and regulate myself. Again, I've served larger parties by myself and have been completely fine as it was all one check or everyone who was paying together were sitting together. In those instances everyone ordered clearly, concisely, and one at a time too so it was never an issue. With these people I'm having a nervous breakdown and I don't even have salad out yet and am just passed apps.

Well, thier food comes up as I am making, of course, their unique, customized, individualized salads. I think I brought out about 8 different ones in total. My manager told me not to hold anything because it was a 20 top which is fair. I was just so behind bc they wouldn't even let me go back to the kitchen to *make* salads. Anytime I would walk away to go get something it was ""another margarita,"" or ""more bread"" (that I had to bake on my own), ""I need a refill on my coffee,"" ""my soup is too brothy"" etc., etc. As soon as I would come back with refills everyone would need yet another refill. It was crazy.

Finally, I get some help and some runners. Salads go down and my manager is traying up their entrees. Bartender is running drinks (about 10 at this point) and of course none of them are strong enough but at this point I don't really care. I'm just focused on getting them out.

Shortly after, entrees go down. Half of them are sent back for not enough sauce or other food quality issues. I am running the fastest I ever have at work with these insane amount of refills (which I'm usually good at so I was shocked). Apparently I ""forgot"" to put in two shrimp frito mistos earlier for apps, which if that were true why didn't you speak up when I brought out apps?

Anyway, a man and woman at the end of the table flag me down and ask to have a conversation with me. Very weird, but I listen to what they have to say

Man: How long have you been working here?
Me: About a year and a half
Man: And they usually trust you with large groups like this?
Me: Yes, I've been doing this for a good amount of time so that's usually the case.
Man: Are you sure you're qualified to work here?

I am absolutely stunned. I just blink and try to comprehend if what he said to me is real. I try to play it off as a joke and say ""well, they haven't gotten rid of me yet!"" and nervously laugh.

The woman shakes her head and says something under her breath. The man says ""ok, wow"" and shakes his head as well. I walk away before they can say anything else and again start crying at the POS and ask my manager to intervene. I genuinely cannot take it anymore. 

She helps me bring out to go boxes and of course each person wants their meal individually boxed up. We finish up, and I do my best to fix up checks. Of course, none of it is right as they've continued to move throughout the meal. My manager does her best to talk to them and help me split them.

Then, the dash starts crashing. I genuinely think it is NOT equipped to handle that big of a tab and so many split checks. Anytime we hit split by guest it logged me out or completely went black. I had never seen it do that. She had to reassign the checks to multiple tables to get it to go through. It was ridiculous.

Finally, we bring checks out and there are a few entrees that are on the wrong checks and no one will claim them. I (increasingly) freak out at the POS. After FOUR seperate attempts to split the checks with my manager, she gives up and voids any items that no one is claiming. At this point, multiple servers come up to us and say that the table is yelling and screaming for a manager and is threatening to walk out on their checks. We (thankfully) get credit cards and start cashing out.

It is now 7:30 pm. I got this table at 3:45 pm. I was an LCL server.

I get left a grand total of five dollars. My tip out was so high I got put in the NEGATIVES for the day and ended up owing the restaurant, ironically, five dollars. I was hysterical.

Clean up took about thirty minutes and I got off around 8 and sobbed the whole time. My manager felt so bad for me she gave me 50 dollars out of her own pocket. She said that as a manager, she has to put me on a temporary probation for large parties (just because of the large amount of voids) and honestly, I was ok with it. I think I didn't have more than a 8 top for about a month lol.

But yeah, I don't think I will ever serve a 20 top solo ever again unless I know it's all one check from the start. I screamed so loud in my boyfriend at the time's car just to get the emotions out after he picked me up. Maybe he genuinely thought I was having a psychotic episode and I don't blame him.

I had a hip replacement at a rural hospital and it went wrong and then I had a revision surgery 5 weeks later.   I have a spinal headache from the revision which was 6 weeks ago.  I was diagnosed by two doctors. 

The pain, eustacian tube dysfunction and nausea are well-managed with fluids and caffeine. Untreated, at first, the headache was a 5 to 6/10 pain.  Now,  if I don't drink caffeine,  it's about a 2 to 3. When I chug coffee, it's like a 1. But I'm very restricted in what I can do around the house.

Very slowly,  the leak has been healing each week.  

I have a lot of fear of a blood patch due to I remember when they gave me the spinal and it was very painful. I was told I couldn't get the blood patch while taking aspirin and I didn't dare stop that because of high DVT risk. 

Any opinions about,  should I keep waiting,  since it's definitely getting a bit better each week? Or get the blood patch? 

I've been getting a lot of wrong info from my rural hospital and clinic and have been left to my own devices on this.

But a few weeks ago, I overheard something I wish I hadn't, and now everything's blown up, and I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm the asshole for what I did.



My brother has been married to ""Anna"" (30F) for five years, and they have a 3-year-old son, Ben. My brother absolutely adores that kid, he's the type of dad who‚Äôs always there‚Äîchanging diapers, taking him to the park, all that stuff. But I've always had this weird feeling about Sarah. Like, she was always just a little too...distant? I don‚Äôt know how to explain it, but I always got this vibe from her that something wasn‚Äôt right.



Anyway, about a month ago, I was at their house to drop off some things for Ben. My brother wasn‚Äôt home, but Anna was there. I was just hanging out in the living room when I overheard Anna on he phone in the kitchen. At first, I wasn't even really listening until I heard her say, ""I can‚Äôt let him find out that Ben isn‚Äôt his, he‚Äôd never forgive me.‚Äù



I literally froze. I thought maybe I heard it wrong at first, but she kept talking, saying something like, ""I know it's hard but you knew this would be the risk when we got involved."" Turns out, she was talking to a guy from her work, Mark, who she‚Äôs been sleeping with for like, 4 year. And the kicker? Ben isn‚Äôt even my brother's kid, he's Mark's.



I was shaking. I felt sick. I left before she could see I heard anything and drove home in a total panic. I had no idea what to do. I spent days debating whether or not to tell my brother. I mean, how the hell do you tell someone that their kid isn't really theirs? But I also couldn‚Äôt just sit back and let him live this lie.



After a few sleepless nights and talking to some friends, I decided I had to tell him. He deserved to know the truth. So, I asked him to meet up for coffee, and I told him everything. He didn‚Äôt believe me at first, but when I told him exactly what I heard, he went white. He went home and confronted Anna that same night, and it turned into a huge blow-up.



Long story short, they‚Äôre getting a divorce. He‚Äôs heartbroken, and on top of everything, he did a DNA test, and it confirmed that Ben isn‚Äôt his. Now his whole world is upside down. He still loves Ben, but everything‚Äôs different, and I can see the pain every time he looks at him.



The thing is, now some of my family‚Äôs mad at me. They think I should have stayed out of it, that it wasn‚Äôt my place to get involved, especially with Ben being so young. They say I broke up a family and that my brother would‚Äôve been better off not knowing. But I just couldn‚Äôt live with myself letting him raise a child that wasn‚Äôt his, especially when Anna was keeping it a secret.



Now I‚Äôm questioning if I did the right thing. My brother‚Äôs devastated, Ben's life is gonna be affected, and my relationship with Anna is obviously ruined.



So, AITA for telling my brother the truth and basically blowing up his whole life? Or should I have kept quiet and let things play out on their own?",32,1728589383.0,AITAH,37,0.94,False
1g0rbk9,https://i.redd.it/037z4xtpfztd1.jpeg,Looking for Feng Shui Advice to Make My Long Living Room Cozier,"Hi everyone!
I could use some help making my living room feel cozier and more balanced following Feng Shui principles.

I will rent this thai house for 3 months.

The room is quite long and narrow, and I'm not sure how to arrange it to promote good Chi flow. It has large windows on one side to the left and where the picture was taken. It lets in a lot of natural light, but overall it feels a bit empty and uninviting. 

The room has light tile flooring and white walls, with basic furniture: a simple couch, a coffee table, and a small dining table. Most of the furniture is placed against the walls, which seems to emphasize the length of the room.

I‚Äôd love some advice on how to visually divide the space or make it feel cozier without disrupting the energy flow. 

Any tips on furniture arrangement, colors, materials, plants, or decor elements that would work well in this space? 

I‚Äôd really appreciate any suggestions to create a more inviting, Feng Shui-friendly living room!
Thanks in advance for your help! üòä

1g0r9sw,https://www.reddit.com/r/JimblesPublic/comments/1g0r9sw/to_tinfoil_and_beyond_everything_is/,To Tinfoil and BEYOND! Everything is connected...XRT/GME/OSTK. The Kansas City Shuffle Redux?,"\*\*\*This post turned into more of an epoch as I was writing because I kept noticing incredible new things. But that's okay, right? I think most here are like me and love an overly-long DD/tinfoil post. Seems like it's been a little while since we've had one.

Some info about me and disclaimers:

I‚Äôm an OG, been here since 2021 and been through every up and down along the way. Check my profile. I mostly lurk, but I pop my head up every now and again. I‚Äôm here almost every day. I‚Äôm DRS‚Äôd, booked, and those shares aren‚Äôt going anywhere. All of the companies and stocks mentioned in this post are heavily correlated with GME and play a role in this saga. I feel it would be disingenuous to not disclose that I am currently invested in the company we‚Äôre going to be focusing on here in regards to its relationship to GME, XRT, and even going all the way back to [Overstock.com](http://Overstock.com) in the 2000s.¬†But I don't think I ever would have connected all of these dots if I hadn't been closely watching this company. It still took an entire month for it to finally click...

HOWEVER, I AM NOT HERE TO SHILL SOME OTHER STOCK. I‚Äôm sharing this because I love some good tinfoil, especially with some legitimate DD mixed in. The entertainment tinfoil has provided me has been what‚Äôs gotten me through these past 84 years, and this one is too good not to share. In addition, just like RK, a significant portion of my gains from any other stock in my portfolio will be plowed right back into GME...you could say GME is my main squeeze. :)

\*\*\*This is absolutely, in no way, shape, or form, financial advice. And I DO NOT recommend investing in any stock, including GME, without doing your own DD. That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs been since day one, and that‚Äôs how it should be. You should not invest in any company based on the manic tinfoil delusions of some highly regarded internet person, AND you should not invest in any stock based on what you think someone else, even RK, might do.\*\*\*¬†

I think there‚Äôs some completely original DD here along with the tinfoil, which excites me greatly. There‚Äôs also going to be a lot of background here that most of you will know, but some newer apes might need some gaps filled in. Make sure your tinfoil hat is nice and snug and grab a coffee. This is gonna be a long one. Buckle up.

Okay, let's actually get started‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm sure this tweet, which is RK‚Äôs most recent as of now, has been on your mind since the day it was posted:

https://preview.redd.it/7v08ieihfztd1.png?width=567&format=png&auto=webp&s=e93b2bb2f22b5b800f90c62099d1236caf6dee4c

It‚Äôs definitely been gnawing at me, living rent free in my head.

The basic meaning is pretty obvious. RK is done playing with CHWY, at least for now, and might be looking for another toy to play with...but the question is, where is he looking? üëÄ

There has been an inordinate amount of speculation about his tweets, emojis, memes, etc.. In an attempt  to decipher what he might be doing now, or what he might do next. While we have all been journeying down rabbit holes, tying RK and RC tweets together, looping in swap data with a sprinkling of FTDs. I think the answer has been staring us right in the face.

When it clicked for me it was so painfully obvious I couldn‚Äôt believe not a single person has come up with this theory yet (including myself‚Ä¶*especially myself*). To be clear, all of this is just wild speculation, we have no idea what he‚Äôs doing or planning without him explicitly telling us. This could be the actual telegraph though.

So what happens next in the movie after Andy kicks Woody to the curb?¬†

He goes to play with his new favorite toy, Buzz Lightyear.¬†

And what, pray tell, is this space cadet‚Äôs favorite catchphrase?¬†

‚ÄúTo infinity and‚Ä¶BEYOND!‚Äù

Is it painfully obvious to you yet? Here‚Äôs a clue:

https://preview.redd.it/o4hmthwr4ctd1.png?width=937&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f91a4f2e85ead9d484541d228de2b419c623e5e

Yes, Bed Bath & Beyond‚Ä¶kind of. As a refresher, BBBY was one of the original meme stocks that went off the rails in Jan 2021 along with all the others. It was part of the XRT ETF, likely in the meme basket swaps, and often (not always) moved with GME with a high amount of correlation.

In March 2022, RCEO purchased a 9.8% stake in the company and started doing his activist investor thing. Well, management and the board of directors decided they didn‚Äôt want to listen to his free advice. They preferred their overpriced consultants (BCG), feeling that the best thing to do would be to run the company into the ground. So RCEO sold off his shares, and by 2023 BB&B went bankrupt.

Alright. Enter Overstock.com. The OG of being naked shorted/cellar boxed. The one we all know and love. For this one we need to go waaay back in time‚Ä¶ pre-sneeze, pre-GFC, to the early 2000‚Äôs, before Reg-SHO was even a thing.¬†

Overstock was founded in 1999 and became a relatively successful online retailer specializing in auctioning off overstocked goods. I still remember their slightly annoying and catchy commercials. There are various reasons and theories why they were targeted, one of those is that Bezos et al aren‚Äôt big fans of competition. But I digress, there are plenty of DDs you can find on that. At the time the cellar boxing started, the founder and CEO of the company, Patrick Byrne, went to war with the shorts. He is mentioned quite often on the sub and his videos explaining the mechanics of how naked shorting works are also posted frequently. Here is the most important clip if you haven‚Äôt seen it yet:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0WXg5T3cBE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0WXg5T3cBE)

In 2020, after a legal battle delayed it by about a year, Overstock was finally able to issue a crypto dividend to shareholders using their privately owned blockchain, T+0. (And sidenote, it was our favorite purple transfer agent who facilitated this dividend.) Even though the SEC hamstrung their dividend by letting shorts settle for it in cash, it still absolutely crushed them, sending the stock soaring from the 2020 pandemic low of $2.53 to a high of $128.50.¬†

Annnnnd that‚Äôs usually about the point where we all forget about this company called Overstock. As far as I know it was never considered a meme stock, it didn‚Äôt move with the meme basket, and it‚Äôs not even in XRT. And that‚Äôs right, it‚Äôs not part of XRT‚Ä¶but it *was*.

See, I sat down and had a nice little chat with GPT. Yes, I know‚Ä¶but it is an incredibly efficient research assistant if you verify your sources. Which I, of course, did. Trust but verify, as they say.

Here are the most important bits + sources:

* XRT is a ‚Äúpassively managed‚Äù ETF which just means that the value of the ETF is supposed to track the proportional collective value of the underlying stocks. But despite being ‚Äúpassive,‚Äù the holdings/allocations in these ETFs can be adjusted daily. State Street is the ETF fund manager, and every day they publish a list of XRT‚Äôs current holdings. [https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/spdr-sp-retail-etf-xrt](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/spdr-sp-retail-etf-xrt) ¬†

\*To find the link click on ‚ÄúHoldings‚Äù at the top and then the ‚ÄúDaily‚Äù hyperlink

* OSTK (Overstock) was included in the XTR ETF beginning somewhere around August 2020, again in November 2021, and then left sometime in 2023 when it was rebranded to Beyond. But that's basically all of the data points I could find on this. No super precise.

Okay, this is exactly when I went and spent an hour manipulating GME/XRT/OSKT charts to try and make them fit together. I made the cool chart down below before I really started playing with them, toggling log scale off and on, crushing graphs, dragging them through each other, etc.. The problem is, that by adjusting settings and time scales you can pretty much make any two tickers match up at certain points. The issue is beta. Remember the other day when the dock worker strike started? EVERYTHING tanked. It wasn‚Äôt just GME. Sometimes everything just moves together.  ¬†¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

So the moral of the story is that we need more data to really see if there is direct correlation between the movement of stocks as they move into and out of XRT. There might be historical daily data somewhere, but I haven‚Äôt found it. And I guess you might also need to somehow adjust for beta while tracking those things. I am not smart enough to do that, sorry.

Here is my cool graph. You can see *some* interesting things, like in Jan/Feb of 2021 where they inverted and then later started tracking one another again. As a bonus, this also includes the crypto dividend for OSTK.

https://preview.redd.it/p1ejn6infztd1.png?width=2835&format=png&auto=webp&s=2859310a4bc7032b69eff7b8f4055213f2042bac

The important things we can say are that OSTK WAS part of XRT at various points in time, and it seems that it and GME also moved together in lock-step at certain times. That period beginning right before Nov. 2021 where we know OSTK was added back into XRT does look like they are tightly locked together. It's also interesting to see that during the post-sneeze dip, OSTK did the inverse of GME. It did the same around Feb. 2022. It would be *very* interesting to see when and if OSTK was included in XRT during those time periods.

Okay, so now that we‚Äôve connected those dots why would RK potentially look at the new Beyond Inc. company?

Well let‚Äôs see... Here's just a brief overview to paint the picture of the company itself as it stands.

* In 2023 [Overstock.com](http://Overstock.com) bought the BB&B‚Äôs IP, rebranded to Beyond Inc., changed their ticker to BYON, and started using the name Bed Bath & Beyond for their online store. BBBY was a meme stock, and part of the basket. Apparently OSTK was too at certain times, or at least part of XRT.
* Beyond was/is a struggling company BUT in 2023. Another activist investor (Marcus Lemonis) bought a stake, joined the board, axed old management, then became chairman and laid out a new plan to reinvent the company.
* The stock is currently in the gutter, at a 4 year low, even as the company is really starting to pivot. Sounds like a potential deep value to me.
* Legacy as well as current short interest. Do you think the shorts got out for good after Overstock issued the crypto dividend? No‚Ä¶you know better than that by now. They probably shorted the top, both sides of the peak, and alllll the way back down.¬†But even without that assumption, current (reported) short interest is still high at¬†12.7%.
* Also, institutional ownership is very high at 68.9%
* As a bonus, Beyond Inc. still owns and operates the private crypto exchange (T+0) that they used for their dividends. They could issue another dividend at some point (though to be honest I don't think this one is very likely due to the legal nightmare it caused them in the past.)

Here's another extremely interesting tidbit. Let's do a pop quiz:

* Who is the designated primary market maker (DPM) for GME options?

A. Nope! If you guessed Citadel that's incorrect. It is Wolverine Trading.

* Who is the DPM for CHWY?

A. It's Citadel Securities this time.

* Who is the DPM for BYON options?

A. Citadel securities again.

So if someone, like RK, with a really big dongle and a bit of cash to spend came in and bought up the whole options chain...that could end up a slightly bad scenario for shorts and anyone who might have written unhedged options contracts when the company started to turn around.

And next we have...Charts! I know, TA doesn't work on GME...but RK himself published his own charts and often referred to them on his stream. Look at all the pretty lines and circles he added to them and then tell me he doesn't like a little TA foreplay.

Here they are: [https://stockcharts.com/public/1778236](https://stockcharts.com/public/1778236)

This is RK's chart showing the build up period before the sneeze in 2021. The second chart below the ticker shows the Relative Strength Index (RSI). What he has underlined shows the RSI steadily marching up, even while the stock was (for part of the timeframe at least) hitting new relative lows.

https://preview.redd.it/c1lkjda7sgtd1.png?width=1435&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2550eb6b0b29d98e494ef87914da6070df79345

The green box highlights the low right before RK doubled down, after the Congressional Farce, but...the box seems to go off the screen? Could that be intentional?

WHAT'S IN THE BOX???

https://preview.redd.it/ic4l6fraqmtd1.png?width=1235&format=png&auto=webp&s=20732cbf8448d469d9e1194e6bc6bffe3104475f

Looks like if you extend the box it goes all the way back to previous all time highs of the stock, and also noteworthy, the 2013-2015 period when many people have postulated is the timeframe when the cellar-boxing campaign began.

Oh, and if you extend the box forward in time? It also highlights the point we were at in April/May this year before the sneeze 2.0. The RSI? Well the line isn't there on his chart (I swear it was there before. Maybe it fell off because this chart updates daily). Well I added the line, and the formation is the same.

https://preview.redd.it/vpyip6i2smtd1.png?width=1438&format=png&auto=webp&s=13477fa5e2a3011e9e36439e9ab639458e4604d0

Now here's the daily chart for Chewy. RK filed his 13G on July 1st, disclosing his stake in CHWY, and before that time... you see the same formation.

https://preview.redd.it/5ayt120usgtd1.png?width=1531&format=png&auto=webp&s=43abf5f95e74c1c081fe0383fdd8adef157ad571

Here is the current weekly chart for BYON:

https://preview.redd.it/wzbonbajxgtd1.png?width=1540&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f8f33ec253eab476a7e8a73abf29f9ae20655b7

Look familiar? Now we have the same initial setup with the RSI marching higher while the stock goes lower. I wouldn't be surprised at all if he had his eyes on it, waiting to pounce.

Sometimes charts are neat, huh?

I will say on TA, that it is useful, but it's not the end all be all for pickin' stocks. BUT when you combine TA with real world events like an upcoming earnings announcement, reinvention of a company, or even the mysterious swap expiries, FTDs, Opex tailwinds, etc.. In situations like those, I think TA can be fairly informative.

And now...the crowd favorite. The cr√®me de la cr√®me. The moment you've all been waiting for!

EMOJIIIIIIIIIIISSSSS!

Let's look at where we are in the timeline. Personally I assume, especially now, that they are in chronological order:

üëÄ:¬†RK looking at a toy he may play with

üê∂: RK buys CHWY

üá∫üá∏üé§: The election? Something about BoA? November 11, Veteran's Day? Something that already happened?

üëÄ: RK looks for another toy to play with?

üî•: Overstock/BYON???

üí•: Shorts explode?

üçª: DFV buys the GME float and every share after that RC offers him? Cheers everybody!

Why might the fire emoji refer to [Overstock.com](http://Overstock.com) / BYON?

Well, Beyond Inc. now runs three online retail websites:

[overstock.com](http://overstock.com) : The original website known for selling excess inventory at steep discounts

[bedbathandbeyond.com](http://bedbathandbeyond.com) : Famous for its 20% off coupons

[zulily.com](http://zulily.com) : Carries your mom's favorite fashion brands, and is also famous for its deep discounts and flash sales

Sounds pretty fire to me.

And like I mentioned above, at the time RK posted these memes, BYON had recently hit near a 1 year low. Right now it's near a 4 year low, levels that haven't been seen since the pandemic. That also sounds kinda like a fire sale.

BONUS: If you didn't notice in RK's Toy Story tweet, the dog's eyes have a red oval iris, which many think is something to do with a stock going down in price or RK selling. But. Overstock's original color scheme is a red similar to these eyes...and their logo? It's just a circle for the ""O"" in Overstock.

So I guess we end sort of how we started. I don't know what RK is doing now or planning to do, and neither do you. But the tweet connection seems too obvious to ignore now that I've seen it. Everything else fits too. Personally, I'd love to be right and see this happen. Only time will tell.

Honestly though...if he's not looking at this stock then he probably should be. How could one turn down the chance to potentially lock the float of a heavily-shorted, small float, small cap, deep value company? Especially when there's a chance you could be using SHFs and Citadel as an ATM to make your next GME YOLO even bigger.

Maybe if I'm right he'll give me a gold star. I would be honored!

TA;DR: Buzz Lightyear says RK's next play is the new Beyond Inc., the old towel stock, and meme basket stock reborn. Could this be the next shuffle in the Kansas City Shuffle? He could be aiming to use the little side hustle to grab some cash from the shorts/Citadel, and potentially send us to INFINITY AND BEYOND. Everything is connected. Everything fits. Finding out will be fun either way. There's a üî• connection to his emoji timeline too.

1g0r9k3,https://www.reddit.com/r/newborns/comments/1g0r9k3/failed_attempt_at_baby_wearing/,Failed attempt at baby wearing,"My 4 week ago recently started fighting daytime sleep. The first 2 weeks he napped no problem in his bassinet 2-3 hours sometimes. And It‚Äôs funny cuz he still sleeps well in his bassinet at night, we get 4 hour stretches almost every night. 

But when I try to transfer him to his bassinet during the day, he wakes up within 20 minutes. The only naps he seems to stay down for a longer period is his first nap of the day and that‚Äôs usually an hour, just enough for me to shower, have a coffee and pump. 

These contact naps all day aren‚Äôt sustainable. I need to be able to do basic things like eat and go to the bathroom. And I‚Äôd love to have a bit of time to myself! 

As per the suggestion I‚Äôve read online I should try baby wearing and having him nap in the carrier or wrap. I got a boba wrap and today I tried to put him in there and he screamed bloody murder. I put him in after a big feed to ensure he was calm but he still wailed.

He never really likes being held upright. When he naps on me, he‚Äôs horizontal in a cradle position, most of his weight is being supported by the boopy pillow which is around my waist while I‚Äôm reclined on the couch. 

Did anyone else‚Äôs baby have this initial reaction to baby wearing. Maybe it‚Äôs too soon to try this? Would a structured carrier be better?

As for daytime naps, should I keep them in the living room where it‚Äôs bright? Maybe this means it‚Äôs time for him to try napping in a dark room?

Any advice or input is welcome!

If you seen my last two posts, you know I've got fired from my old scharriot property & I just joined a new one. If you know you're scharriot property's, it's a Fallmountain. ;)

Anywho, here's everything that has happened in my FOUR days of working here. Let's begin. Grab some cookies & coffee, if you please.

DAY ONE:
* 40 minutes before the end of my shift, I asked if we could finish my payroll stuff. the gm became upset and said I still have time left before my shift ends so we'll do it later. end of my shift came & still didn't happen. my replacement was 10 minutes and almost caused me to miss an appointment I had. (Wasn't too important but still)

DAY TWO:
* Had to fix several GNS reservations who were actually in house cause the other fd staff doesn't know the system to well. 
* refunding several people bc they booked third party and cards are getting swiped over.
* told my FOM that I need 1 day next week off for dr appointments, was told in a very rude voice ""mmmkay"". A full on valley girl accent too. 
* hk supervisor came down at 30 minutes past departure time and asked who was all gone. I said...shouldn't you know? She said no. I was confused & went to someone who's been here longer, and she said we just check ALL departures out at noon. Then hk doesn't let me know if they're actually gone or not.
* GM made a comment abt my nose piercing saying she knows how she feels about the front desk & looking 'tidy'. Said nose piercing wasn't a problem during two interviews.
* FOM was 30 minutes late. So I had to stay and help train my replacement. 

DAY THREE: 
* 20 minutes before my shift ends, we finally get to do payroll stuff. I was there until 40 minutes AFTER my shift was supposed to end because she kept getting distracted. 
* Whilst doing payroll stuff, she was going over how I'm filing as. I said head of household since I cover 100% of bills since my s/o is a sahd to our baby. She clicked on the drop down box and then clicked of to the side and said it wouldn't allow to change it from single to head of household. She did it again. Faked clicking it and saying it wouldn't allow her to change it. Finally, she did change it.

DAY FOUR:
* The housekeeping manager, named T from here out, had me do housekeeping boards since she was off. She ended up coming in today. This isn't an issue at all.
* While tidying up the front desk, I overheard T talking to both the FOM & GM over the phone how front desk needs to be trained better. Yes, I agree. She then went on to complain how *my* body language needs to be better and I need to be nicer to guests. Yall know why? Cause when it's slow, I crochet at the desk to pass time. A guest came up to me & I set my project onto the ground to help the guests faster. The crochet needle made a little noise but I was up fast and smiling. Anyways, I'm no longer allowed to crochet at the front desk I have to sit in the hallway to the back office and crochet. Out of view of guests, apparently. As my gm has told me.

So, yay. Now I work at a property where the housekeeping manager likes to stick her nose where it don't belong. I'm sorry if that sounds rude, but she has her own department to worry about. Ill listen to *my* department heads. Thiugh,I am frustrated my gm listened to her and immediately had a problem with me. :/ I'm just crocheting man. 

Not to mention, since I'm the only one om the desk staff who has experience with the system, I am now suddenly being forced to do refunds and fix any mistakes the other stuff makes. not the fom. me. My gm wanted *me* to call hellpedia to fix a mistake the fom made. ",2,1728589156.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,2,0.75,False

Tuesday I had my 28week appointment and was instructed to show up 15 minutes early to go to the lab to drink the glucose so I can have my blood drawn after. I got to pick between orange and lemon and chose the orange which honestly just tasted like a vitamin water. Went down super easy no issues. Immediately after I felt a little hot but that could have been from going from the lab to my appointment. After my appointment I still had about 20 minutes left so I waited back down at the lab and had my blood drawn easy peasy.

Next day  (Wednesday) I got my results informing me I failed the test by only 4 points. I was super upset about having to go back for the 3 hour lab and honestly made myself more anxious by reading posts by people who had bad experiences/reactions. I scheduled my appointment for today to get it over with and it was more boring than anything else. Hardest part was not being able to eat or drink more than sips of water here and there. I had no reaction to the drink besides some wanting to burp it up after the hour mark. My 3rd draw a student did the draw and missed the vein and had to poke again before calling someone else over. After that draw in particular I felt a little light headed but I think it had more to do with anxiety about having to be poked multiple times and subsided after 15 minutes.

1g0qzxw,https://i.redd.it/selesuq4dztd1.png,Aeropress + metal mesh + drip assist,"TL;DR: Metal mesh under paper filter speeds up drawdown.

Long version (but I'll try to keep it short):

Just now I ran a little experiment, comparing two modes of pourover via Aeropress.

I cut an Aeropress-sized disc out of a metal kitchen sieve. I ground 25 g of months-old decaf. I boiled a kettle of water to 95¬∞C and kept it at that temperature. I tumbled the grinds in a jar to homogenize them. I used an 18 g espresso basket as a drip assist.

I did not use the ""stamp"" (?) to force the liquid through. Apart from asking the brews what they were going to do after college, no pressure was applied.

For both versions I spooned 12,5 g of coffee into the AP and distributed them evenly. I used 3x the coffee weight for blooming and after 0:30 minutes I topped it off to 170 g.

Differences:
For Brew 1 I used only the normal paper filter. For Brew 2 I used a metal mesh below the paper filter.

Why?
In the regular setup the only way for coffee to exit the Aeropress is through the holes in the AP cap. If these holes clog from fines, the whole brew might take longer or stall completely. A metal sieve between the paper filter and AP cap should significantly enlarge the available filter area, thus reducing brew time and/or the risk of clogging.

Results:
Fortunately, my observations confirm the hypothesis of this experiment. Brew 2 brewed visibly faster than Brew 1. 
Unfortunately, I do not have definitive measurements. For the first brew I used an endpoint of 1 drop/second. This was achieved after 2:50 min. After around 3:20 the brew was pretty much done with only occasional drops.

With Brew 2 I could not reliably identify single drops, since the setup had altered the flow of water somehow. Also, I did not use a glass cup, so I could not see the drops. 

But just looking at the drawdown, looking at the water level in the AP I saw a significantly faster drawdown in Brew 2. Which makes me hopeful!

Discussion:
The current experiment seemed to confirm the hypothesis that the AP cap restricts water flow and that filter clogging is an issue affecting brew time. Due to the childish setup, further experiments need to be done in order to validate the results. Which I shall undoubtedly do.

Thanks to Lance Hendrick and Jonathan Gagne for the inspiration for this experiment and their work for the coffee community!",3,1728588512.0,pourover,4,0.8,False

*Date:(Standardized Human Time)February 9th, 2161.*

After Vulthiss and I decided to finish our little coddling session, we finally decided to head back downstairs. Glis was sitting on the couch, staring at the static of the TV screen. This isn't the first time we found him doing that, so we left him alone.

""I wonder why he does that..."" I muttered as I stared at Glis who was still staring intently at the TV static.

Vulthiss shimmied her obese form into a chair beside me at the kitchen table. ""He says he sees things in the static."" She answered. ""He says figures dance in the TV, although who the figures are is never specified.""

Before I could reply, the familiar footsteps of a Kolshian rang through my ears as Bahumth walked into the kitchen. She yawned as she grabbed a fruit out of the fruit bowl at the table before pulling up a chair. She began to eat as she sat down, still looking quite tired.

""Did you sleep well?"" I asked the cerulean cetacean.

""Eh..."" She replied. ""I was a little cold.""

""Well, if you need another blanket, you could just ask."" I said.

The Kolshian didn't seem to hear my words as she took another bite of her fruit. It wasn't long before we heard the sound of claws clacking against the floor as Tanca stumbled in, looking as disheveled as Bahumth. She tried blinking herself awake as she too took a seat, except she didn't grab anything to eat. But it was normal for her to eat when she decided was the best time for it, so I didn't question it.

""Let me guess, you didn't sleep well either?"" Vulthiss said to the Drezjin.

Tanca signaled in affirmative with her ears.

Vulthiss let out a sigh. ""Well, that doesn't sound too good."" She muttered just loud for us to hear her...

*(One Hour Later.)*

Everyone was fully awake now that the kids got something to eat. Bahumth was sipping on her daily cup of black coffee, which many would say is unhealthy for a child, but I would argue that getting lit on fire was even more unhealthy, yet it still hasn't stopped me. We all sat on the couch, watching the news. We attempted to contact the Jaslips a few days ago with questionable success. To be honest, I hated having to do these things in the dark. The Arxur have changed as a species, and have tried to move on from our barbaric past, but we can never truly show that we've changed until humanity grows a fucking spine and stops giving us the short end of the stick! Now we have to get the alliance of literal terrorists just to make a difference!

The TV was suddenly turned off. We all looked over at Tanca who was holding the remote. ""I'm done with cowards making excuses..."" She said in a tone as venomous as her vocals could allow. In fact, it almost scared me!

""Um, what do you mean sweetie?"" I asked.

""The humans."" She answered. ""They need to figure out whose side they're on!"" She said.

Although I knew humans aren't as bad as some still believed, I knew that they were incredibly ungrateful. Not only did we save them from extinction, but we also helped rebuild what was destroyed. And yet they still choose to demonize us any chance they get! Sure, I was practically worshipped by the small Scottish town I was in after killing that bear, but the humans still ostracize us, even though we still attempt to change!

""I get where you're coming from."" I told the Drezjin.

Vulthiss, Glis, and Bahumth didn't seem to care about what was going on anymore, only about whether or not we would survive. I didn't blame them for that.

I was recently tasked with sourcing equipment for a coffee shop and when it comes to espresso grinders , the mahlkonigs standout (from the little research that i did).  
I m not saying we are gonna go for it but could someone help me understand the differences between e80t and e80w.

I was also curious if the e80 is worth the extra money over the e65. We are probably not gonna overcome the 50kg per week on espresso.

Another thing I looking to find out is whether or not the GBW are worth the investment.

We have no limit on the budget but we dont want to overspend. We are gonna be in philly and the espresso standards are finally starting to rise , so we will put a lot of detail on our espresso , but we know , probably most of the production is gonna be drip coffee/ cold brew and flavored lattes where the espresso is gonna be lost. There's gonna be great traffic tho, so we aim for speed , consistency and automation.

We are gonna use the Sanremo Racer and i was looking for the best espresso grinder , feel free to shoot suggestions for other grinders.

P.S. I ve been trying to do research for other coffee equipment and the only advice i ve found is in reddit , do you have an suggestions for other forums/websites who are genuinely helpful and not trying to sell certain devices?",1,1728588420.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

It just takes a lot for me to open up to folks. I enjoy technology, movies, music, games, science, food, art, nature, coffee and cats. So very Portland of me! I'd ideally like to find someone who likes at least some of the same things so we have something in common. I'm a bit of a recluse. I enjoy being at home when I can. That doesn't mean I'm a shut in by any means. I live with chronic pain, anxiety, ocd and ptsd. These make it hard for me to live, but as I get older I'm able to cope with them better.

I like to kinda nerd out on those sometimes too. You'll typically find me on reddit, shopping online, researching stuff, tinkering with electronics or playing games of course.

I have a small history with Tirz - essentially never going past 5mg, stopping after having to have my gallbladder out within 3 mos of starting, and restarting about 2 months ago. Throughout my entire journey, I‚Äôve always had GI side effects. 

One thing I noticed is once I developed reflux on Tirz, it never went away even when I stopped and subsequently restarted. So I‚Äôve effectively had it since I started Tirz and it just has never gone away even with meds. Had an endoscopy after I stopped the first time which found an irritated esophagus and gastritis. Doc recommended omeprazole which never really did anything. 

Anyways, lately I‚Äôve had some GI issues. Bloating, nausea, constant reflux, feeling like there is food stuck in my throat and on the left side of my stomach. Like, a knot or something on the left side of my abdomen in between my hip and rib. I feel something there. It also feels spasm-y sometimes. I do suffer from constipation but manage to go when I drink coffee. Last night I developed a pain on my left side that wouldn‚Äôt go away until I fell asleep. It was concerning. Not sharp, but nagging and definitely noticeable. I‚Äôm also burping more. Food has not been appetizing to me either. 

I honestly feel like garbage in my stomach and wondering if these are all signs I should stop and/or if something else is going on here. Pancreatitis? Gastroparesis? Damage to my stomach? Anyone have a similar experience? Any tips? I‚Äôve reached out my prescriber to get an appt. 

Btw, SW: 228, CW: 165. I‚Äôm a female with PCOS and suffered from constipation prior to Tirz. You can see my journey in my posts on my profile. ",1,1728588221.0,tirzepatidecompound,10,1.0,False

I‚Äôm currently studying at a university where I‚Äôm about three years older than most of my classmates. Ive reached 4th year and I‚Äôve built up a bit of a reputation in my department for frequently retaking classes and taking semesters (sometimes even a year) off. To be honest, I‚Äôm far from the ideal college student. A big part of the reason for this is that I‚Äôm financially self-supporting and depend on my salary from work to survive. Whatever is left after covering my living expenses goes towards enrolling in classes, but, admittedly, I often neglect some of them to prioritize work or even just to catch up on sleep.

Last year, most of the older instructors left and were replaced by newer, younger engineers as our professors. We have a small class size so the professors exactly know who‚Äôs who. Over the past few semesters, I‚Äôve noticed that they‚Äôve picked up on how often I don‚Äôt fully participate in class or fail and retake subjects. As a result, their attitudes towards me seem to have changed‚Äîthey often ignore me or leave me out of class discussions, unlike my previous instructors. I can‚Äôt help but feel like they don‚Äôt want to waste their time on me and instead focus on other students they see as having more potential for success.

I‚Äôve been feeling increasingly left out, and I understand why they might not want to encourage my habits. I don‚Äôt want any bashing toward my professors‚Äîthey‚Äôre just doing their job, and I can see their point of view. Honestly, I don‚Äôt even have the energy to prove them wrong.

Given that my health has also been taking a hit due to this lifestyle (little sleep, lack of activity, cigarettes, coffee, and constant overworking), I‚Äôve been seriously considering quitting school altogether. It feels like the way my professors treat me is making this difficult decision easier.

I‚Äôm a 34-year-old mom who gave birth via C-section two months ago. Since giving birth, I‚Äôve been experiencing a range of strange symptoms, and I‚Äôm hoping some of you might have similar experiences or advice.

Before pregnancy, I had periradicular cysts on my spine (C7 bilaterally and C8 on the right), but they never caused any issues. However, a few weeks after giving birth, I started feeling paresthesia (tingling, pins, and needles sensations) in my hands, fingers, feet, and even around my lips. Most of these sensations are felt in my hands and feet, especially the fingers and the soles.

I also feel sharp pains around my shoulder blades, and my legs sometimes have a trembling sensation. These symptoms usually appear after I‚Äôm awake for 1-2 hours and after simple activities like making coffee or hanging laundry.

I‚Äôve already undergone tests like electromyography, which ruled out carpal tunnel syndrome. I've checked for other possible causes like vitamin deficiencies, diabetes, and HIV, but all my tests came back normal. I don't have conditions like lupus or Sj√∂gren‚Äôs syndrome either. I even had a moment where I felt a burning sensation on my lips and recently around my hip.

These symptoms are quite uncomfortable, and I‚Äôm wondering if any other moms have experienced anything similar after a C-section. Could this be nerve-related due to the pregnancy or something else?

Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated!

Don't read if it bothers you, of course.(My therapist asked me to tell the story I used the same text) I have several doubts about my ex-boyfriend's manners. By demanding responsibilities from him, could I have triggered narcissistic behaviour? ","My boyfriend (he is on autistic spectrum, maybe this information can be relevant here) seemed an introvert when I met him so I took the initiative of contacting also kissing on our first date, after a few weeks talking, which he later told me he took as a red flag; he told me that for him, things worked by going out for *""a coffee, then another coffee, and another coffee, and then...""*  He didn't finish the sentence, but it made me thoughtful because he had told me that in our previous conversation he had only been with only one person before me, (in terms of kissing or having sex) according to him. But that day we repeated many times and after we left each other to go home, we kept talking and he told me it was nice and enjoyable;
On our second date, he said he already felt like he was in a relationship. Caveat: We were both equally open to it. The enthusiasm in the conversations was mutual, as it was for the schedules initially. But soon after, some arguments arose when I started to question him after observing some behaviours such as omissions, inconsistencies and a few lies. I think the justification for that may go beyond insecurity. Eg.: telling me he needed to go out to buy something when he was actually going out for a coffee with a friend.  At first, that was somewhat understandable, but as time goes on, it's natural we get more confident and leave the excuses. But it wasn't what happened in so many cases.
So I observed behaviours like that and would point them out to him with the intention of helping him understand that he could be transparent with me about what he wanted/needed, and that I would understand him.
And I kept realising that, and trying to do the same, so I was getting frustrated but I was trying to show him the best way would be to communicate better, and I asked for that several times. We just started having arguments. 
Then he would stop responding to my messages or would reply with gaps of several hours, which was not usual, however I assumed it was a little because of his autism (I mean the fact he chose to be quiet and refusing any type of communication, I got it as a difficulty to face the conflicts in order to solve them as I read). On the other hand, it seemed like an attempt at emotional manipulation. I started feeling like he was trying to manipulate me over time with silent treatments, in order to condition me to accept that kind of behavior. He said he distanced himself because I was being accusatory, but he refused to have any clarifying things properly, giving  short and evasive answers only, followed by silence and later saying he didn‚Äôt want to talk about that matter. Eventually, he refused to discuss anything related to us, claiming that I only talked about that, but that's not true, because we connected in the first place with common interests. I was insisting on clarification because it was bothering me, obviously.

I wrote to him several times in an attempt to resolve that because he refused to call or talk personally claiming to feel uncomfortable. 
He started saying I was just  interested in emotional drama and that I was being abusive, which sounds like gaslighting to me.
In order to break that loop, I invited him to reflect and ask himself why things were happening that way. And after some other unpleasant events, I suggested we go to therapy with the same professional. At one point, he briefly said he would think about it, but later replied that he didn‚Äôt want to.

Let's go back in time for a while: Knowing he had previously used dating apps, one day I asked if he still used them. Not only did he tell me he wasn't using that, but he also made a gesture of handing me his phone as proof that there was nothing there. That alerted me because it doesn't take much intelligence to know that doesn‚Äôt serve as proof. A few days later, I asked again, and then he told me that after one of our early arguments, he stopped believing our relationship would work and simply went back to using dating apps. So yes! He had underestimated my intelligence by handing me the phone then. 

Similar things happened regarding conversations with ""other people,"" and what seemed to me like simple things that could be resolved through dialogue became triggers for avoidance. He told me that when ""I started being like that,"" his mind started to go in other directions. I also heard something like ""I did things that must have discouraged you, and you didn‚Äôt leave."" Would that be an implicit hint? Why didn't he tell me what he wanted then? What do my readers understand as ""other directions""? HOWEVER...  I asked a few times if he wanted to continue meeting/getting involved with other  people because he conveyed this in previous conversations about people 
he was talking to when we met and his answer was: ""Sigh"", ""I'm not doing this conversation anymore, let's talk about music"", or simply nothing. So he never gave me the confidence that he had stopped talking to ppl who he used to flirt with. He even said he was still having some conversations with one of them  at some point (by the way, the one he had shown attraction for, and according to him, it wouldn‚Äôt work out because he had a ‚Äúsexual hobby‚Äù that didn‚Äôt work for him, but he continued talking to her because he wanted to understand what she wanted from him. That was also during our relationship) I naturally asked questions about his feelings/ intentions towards that person (She lives at the same country he was going to live for a couple of months for some specific reason, well.... It's natural since he told me he started talking to them during the days we were in bad vibes. So he said I was jealous and he simply adopted an: ""I'm not talking to anyone,"" as a standard response for anything that referred to a similar subject.

*Just one more topic about ""I'm not talking to anyone"" Once, during one of our conversations when he was in a good mood, he mentioned that he basically only talked to family members and three friends, and months before he had said he had two or three female friends who lived in the UK / Corea and it was very rare for him to talk to them. I felt that his tone was defensive, which conveyed more insecurities. I don‚Äôt want to sound like a judgmental fool, but I will point out a few things and leave it to the reader to draw their own conclusions. The person had 'theoretically' stopped using dating apps after having used them for several years. He considers himself a nerd, and much of his life is online, with several social media accounts. It‚Äôs a bit strange to say he limits himself so much in chats. I asked a few questions trying not to sound invasive, but that‚Äôs the response I got. And then: I saw a few conversations, when he opened his Instagram one of them with a girl (from USA) btw and reactions with ""‚ô•Ô∏è"" although the subjects at least at that moment, the topics were generic. Discouraged, I just said in a sarcastic tune: *""Anyone is too little!""* He called me jealous, claiming they were just friends.. Actually the conversations were about general stuff. I don't believe that girl would even be interested in him in a romantic way (for reasons that I won't elaborate on further) but the conversation seemed very ""enthusiastic"". Before ppl ask me how I could see that and call me invasive.... I asked him for that and he showed me. 
And he told me: she‚Äôs my friend. (Wtf?) Further down, there were 3 or 4 more chats with girls, and I asked about the one closest to the bottom (he had done the same thing with me before when he saw my chat open, and I responded without any issues. The difference is that I never said I didn‚Äôt talk to anyone; on the contrary, I even mentioned a male friendship I made through a dating app in the past).

At the bottom was a conversation with one of his former students. Hey, it‚Äôs fine to have friendships with the opposite sex, but when you start hiding it... Bro? Why the insecurity at this level? Could they have been the targets of some previous flirting? (Maybe not just 'previous' ü§î)""
But my point wasn‚Äôt about the people or the conversations with them because of jealousy simply. Actually it was more related to the fact that he was always on the defensive, giving evasive answers and inconsistent justifications in various aspects of our conversations about topics like that. He used to say he basically was talking to five other people. 

I just asked him things like that because of the other manners, I already started to think that he was maintaining the relationship with me because it was 'real' at the moment, but he wanted to keep the possibility of something better or simply 'something' in case things didn‚Äôt work out between us. The traditional game of those who embrace the idea of fluid relationships. 
Could this behavior be partly related to the difficulty of resolving conflicts? That's it: instead of having a conversation with me about what was bothering him and what was bothering me, he simply tried to sweep it under the rug and avoid me. I struggled to believe that someone I admired precisely for showing me that they were above various types of behavioral neglect was choosing that path.
 I was kind of waiting for the person to face the reality because some behaviours seemed childish and therefore incompatible with the part of his personality that made me get interested. He used to present good arguments and articulated consistently on the general topics we discussed, which made our connection enjoyable initially.
 We enjoyed a good moment together of course.
Things heated up between us, like with any couple. The difference was that, by his choice, we didn‚Äôt have privacy, and he only agreed to go out in public places. That was okay for me, but after a few months, I suggested doing something different, like going camping or going somewhere that would allow us more privacy. This wasn‚Äôt necessarily for having sex, but we always went to pubs, for a walk in town, or to parks, which, although still public places, allowed us a few minutes of 'peace.'

We  had sex only once, for literally 3 seconds, and it caused him extreme concern about the condition of the condom (which was intact and fine) and a huge paranoia about all the negative possibilities.
We did that in a place without total privacy, and he was so worried while I was trying to calm down he disclaimed about the spot - a park -  but that was the only option we could think about. (üìå On that day, we had gone to that place somewhat prepared for it, and he even made some funny comments about it. I felt a bit embarrassed, but I was okay about it.)

After that, he told me he wouldn't be prepared to do that again anytime soon, I said ok but I didn't understand such a big block around it since he told me I used to make him uncontrollably horny and sex would be something dangerous. 
Days later he said something like ""I want you"", ""let's do whatever you want"", "" let's have sex"". He had a few beers that day and the next day he sounded like his changed his mind a little and in some time later he sent me a 15-min You-Tube video containing some basic principles of Geomancy. He told me he had asked some questions during that practice about whether he should have sex with me or not. He was looking for answers regarding a decision about a trip he was going to take related to professional matters.

I was willing to have patience with almost everything that would be different for me, but no cheating. I basically found myself wrestling with someone else's partially fictional universe.

He said emphatically: ""You ruined everything"" was his sentence when he saw me struggling against an end in that condition, bc letting a lack of communication create a society of monsters to destroy expectations and good feelings becomes sad, poor, even ridiculous. That's my ""doubt"" (if I really can call it doubt) because that represents a weak manipulation tactic usually used by neurotypicals lacking emotional intelligence or / and respect, but technically that doesn‚Äôt match him because he usually analyzes facts and situations more intelligently, in a high level common sense, I would say. At the same time I‚Äôm talking about a person who *literally* ran away a few times when I sought him out to have a conversation. 

Later, he started engaging in apparent narcissistic games, like singing while I was talking to him (I understand he was anxious about making a difficult decision for him in those days, but‚Ä¶) He complained that I only wanted to talk about relationship issues while he preferred to talk about movies or music, which sounded a bit bizarre to me; I wasn‚Äôt talking about problems because I enjoyed it but because I found it necessary to  clarify what was bothering me. And he seemed to start hating me and for a while I felt the same.

There were times when I went to see him (without us schedule it and I know that's not the best thing to do but he just stopped talking once again, I was sad, because I know there's a lot of better ways to solve that. I just wanted to have a decent conversation. Although I understood he got nervous and anxious with our issues.
One day I approached him saying, ""Hi, I'd like to talk.

 I know you're uncomfortable, but can we at least have a brief conversation?"" He seemed to hate me at that moment, but I insisted, telling him how disproportionate it was imo. He certainly interpreted many things from my side in a way that I didn't intend. He even said a few times he was paranoid; 
Naturally, people ask why I stayed. I wish I could have done something to change that *because/however/although* I can't see a logical reason for that set of strange manners. I got irritated in the process, and I made mistakes in how I treated him too, but nothing unforgivable to the point where I didn‚Äôt get any response, even if neutral.
So he told me that if I didn't leave, he would notify the police. I laughed ironically, but in a state of perplexity. Really? Something we could clear up over coffee, talking like the 30+ year-old adults we are. He started laughing in a strange way‚Äînervous, sarcastic‚Äîand turned the corner. I asked where he was going, and he answered, ""To the police station."" I said, ""Really? I‚Äôll go with you, and we can clarify the exact reasons driving you to do this, right?""
I couldn‚Äôt understand what led him to this extreme but wouldn‚Äôt allow him to have a conversation with me as the situation required. There were no screams, no violence, no offense or anything that would make the involvement of a police officer necessary imo. 

He claimed that I was ""following"" him. It was: I went to meet him on the same path we used to take when he was coming back from work. It was our way to the train station. We had an arrangement, and apparently, he wasn‚Äôt keeping it. I believe I had the right to understand what was going on. Simply blaming me, saying I was ruining the relationship, was neither fair nor sensible. I had some indications that he was seeing other women.
I never made any comment that would make him think it was a criterion for me that a man should only have had one woman /s or that he couldn't go out with a friend, or that someone couldn't have had a past or other loves. 

He also told me he felt threatened by the tone I used when I let him know I found out where he lives. üìåThere we go: : we don‚Äôt live far from each other, there‚Äôs just one neighborhood separating ours, and a friend recognized him because he had seen us together and asked if I knew, and I responded that I only knew the general area. My friend was even a bit surprised because most people in relationships usually visit each other‚Äôs homes. But in our case, he would feel awkward about his parents and there are other implicit factors, like him having thought I might have some material interest, a different nationality, given that he also made it clear he held some prejudice toward people of my nationality (yeah... I know). This would be another barrier for certain things. I know that the way he processes some thoughts is very different from mine, and I let a lot of things slide because I believed time would help him feel more at ease with me. But his behavior went from 100 to 0 in some aspects towards me. The conversations got a strange tune, he started frequently giving up on our schedule; apparently, the inconsistencies about trivial day-to-day things were increasing in proportion.
There was a moment when we reconciled, and we exchanged an ""I love you,"" which once again came from me, but he reciprocated. Also, one day, when I suggested I might leave the country, he said he felt wrecked, empty... 
My understanding of that guy's motives fluctuates as much as his emotions and feelings, I think. In part, he was afraid of being left, so he preferred to do it first, as he did but in the process, he decided to inflate his ego by showing narcissistic traits. Did he use the fact that I chose to stay and try to fix things as a means to inflate his ego, seeing the opportunity to cheat?
He justifies the feelings I had for him by saying that this was the result of magic spells he did before we met. 
I've already put myself in his shoes several times, but I don‚Äôt know if he has the same ability. 
I was disappointed and perplexed by his reaction to my attempt to talk + he had said that his friends advised him to stay away from me. Did his account contain valid justifications for my dissatisfaction? I don't think so
So I wrote a text similar to this one for his friend, slightly shorter than this, telling what would be 'my version' of the events. And probably now he hates me because of that. 
Any comments on the subject are welcome, except about the length of the text, as I'm aware that it‚Äôs worthy of a magazine article, lol

‚¨áÔ∏èPhrases he told me more than once that, in my opinion, convey superficiality/immaturity and don't align with his manners:
1. ""You are attractive, who would leave you?""
2. ""You are attractive, no one would cheat on you.""
3. ""I never cheated.""",0,1728587619.0,personalitydisorders,0,0.5,False

A few years ago I had a big crash and started having bad neurological symptoms. I still haven‚Äôt recovered but I‚Äôve made some progress. I don‚Äôt know what triggered it. I know I had black mold exposure at that time, it was also when Covid first started and also I started consuming coffee daily at that time when I used to only have it once a week. Anyway my question is about marijuana. I was a very heavy marijuana user, it helped with my anxiety and ptsd, but I definitely overdid it and have an addictive personality. When I had the big crash I had to give it up completely, along with alcohol, coffee and several foods that I suddenly became allergic too. I‚Äôve been sober almost 5 years now. My symptoms are much better than they were but I still struggle with anxiety, depression, fatigue, lack of motivation and some brain fog. I miss what weed used to do for me. It made me able to calm my brain down enough to function and know what I want to do in life. I‚Äôve been researching on whether it helps with stress/anxiety/adrenal burn out or makes it worse. I have this underlying inability to fully relax, even when I meditate for a long time there‚Äôs just a tension in my body that I can‚Äôt fully release, and weed used to relieve that for me. There are of course some negative side effects with marijuana too. CBD alone never did anything for me at all, it had to be thc combined with it. I‚Äôm debating trying weed again but I don‚Äôt know.

There‚Äôs a creepy older woman who keeps on initiating small talk with me even though I don‚Äôt work with her and we were never formally introduced.

I‚Äôm still new so I try to be nice with everyone but this woman keeps on asking me how are my aging parents doing overseas and she seems overly interested in my personal life but at the same time stares intrusively at my body.

Anyway, a couple of days ago she stopped by my desk and started asking about my parents and my home country then she asked me if I wanted a coffee or tea so I said no. She kept on insisting so I said that it‚Äôs almost time for lunch so I‚Äôm not going to drink coffee.

Right before lunch she came to my desk again with two sandwiches that she bought from outside and offered me one so I told her that I just had lunch. Then she asked me to keep it for later so I told her that I already got a home-made sandwich for the afternoon.

She then told me that she‚Äôs going after work to a musical in a church to relax and asked me if I wanted to go so I said that I had plans. Towards the end of the day she sent me a link to that musical in the chat on Teams.

I was focusing on myself I was in San Francisco and had been going to many dates but nothing either I've been rejected or just ghosted because I was too nice or I was in the medieval times as a gentleman

I understand and nowadays we have to be tough and bold and boundaries I met this girl on Facebook when I moved to New Orleans on September I wasn't feeling it  at first but she was really interested so we talked made a few phone calls September 15th we went out for a cup of coffee 6:00 p.m. all the way to 2:00am 8 hours of talking I feel that that was enough but I never had a deep conversation with someone like that and I started to increase my feelings towards her since September 15th till now like we been talking like texting for a month now idk if this is to fast never felt this before.

little by little I started noticing she hasn't been there to try not even asking questions about me  I always send her a good nights she always replys with a good morning I add  a sweet touch friendly and loving showing that I care, she talks to me about her situation and I'm always there for her to comfort her in my mind.

I don't ask nothing to return I just want some clarity some guidance and clarity about what she feels I asked her out recently she had a convention she had to do in Chicago which I understand I've been rooting for her when she was nervous and she was busy during the weekend I received a text message or screenshot because our phones were not working properly and she put hey I've been thinking about you. Since that day my feelings started to increase but her text and her conversations are very bland now I don't know why what have I done

I asked her out for October 19th and she said she has to go to see her family like I feel that she's not interested anymore know that I had to move on we agreed to talk today so I could express it confess what I think because I don't want to be doing exact same mistakes I know it's hard I'm not a type of person that leave people hanging I might be overthinking it but I don't like my people waste my time and energy such as caring loving and I don't play games I'm hard to get if somebody's interested they take actions and set schedules aside to talk to that one person that they truly are interested in that's what confuses me just need some guidance some advice from all men or a woman

Im just want to let go of this feeling twords her well confess to her I just don't want to waste my time on someone who wants only attention I seek a serious relationship not games I just don't know what to do or say.

1g0qdv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/sheffield/comments/1g0qdv8/cambridge_street_collective_review/,Cambridge Street Collective Review ,"I ate at all the food vendors at Cambridge Street Collective, here is my review. 

I tried a new place each time I visited since the opening.   I tried to order specials, something that seemed like their speciality or something which the staff recommended, all eaten as they are served. 

Greek - Halloumi wrap, ¬£10. The wrap has lots of salad, 4 decent chunks of haloumi and a few chips. It's pretty small for ¬£10 but it maybe is just enough to justify the cost. The halloumi is nicely cooked and pleasent to eat. Chips in a wrap are always a winner too and the salad balances it all out nicely. Overall its good but nothing spectacular to warrent a top score, it's solid though. One of the better choices here. 7/10

Send Nudes - crispy salt and pepper pumpkin, soft fried noodles, prawn dumplin and pork char sui dumplin- can't remember the price I was drunk. The dumplin were good but didn't blow my mind. The noodles were pretty basic tbh, there is loads of good noodle options in sheffield, they need to raise the bar to competencies those. The pumpkin was nice, crisp and flavourful. Overall a 6/10, again I was drunk though so not the most trust worthy review but I defo remember it being on the better ok but equally, I was pissed and wasn't raving about how good it was.

Palestinian Baity - Hummus and sumac cauliflower and aubergine, ¬£14. The Hummus is OK, it's very smooth and mellow but I honestly think it's bought in, until i see proof otherwise. You also get 2 flat breads, 100% bought in, I spotted the packets in the back. The Aubergine and cauliflower have a nice spice to them and the sauce on top does lift the dish. The hummus is average, the breads from a shop, the veg is just roasted veg with a spice mix on, it all left me thinking I could do just as good at home after a trip to Ozmen I think I would go back to try the chicken, which did look good. 4/10

El chapo- el chapo taco meal deal ¬£14.50. The chips are generic takeaway chips, the sauce on the chips is okay and adds some nice spice to something pretty boring. The taco is tiny, I might have misread the menu but I thought it would be bigger. Inside is some very tender beef but it's so bland, it literally no flavour to the beef, there isnt even seasoning. The taco is also covered in sauce. Which is nice on its own but there's so much its become the only flavour I can taste.  Overall, this was disappointing, I probably would try something else here, i love mexican food but this was so disappinting i cant actually believe this is the best they can do.  3/10

Michies - Pepperoni slice ¬£8
Looks good but its very small, its ¬£8 and its about as big as my phone. It has a thick base, originally thought it was thick with cheese, it isn't its just dough, plus its average too. You get a small pot of cold marinara sauce on the side, I presumed it was extra to dip, its actually the sauce that should be on the pizza, maybe its a gimmick, if it is, its crap. I don't want to dip my hot pizza in to a cold pot of marinara sauce. Struggling to say anything positive, the staff were super nice aandat the end ofbthe day, its cheese and bread which is hard to hate, but if you are coming to CSC i would avoid. Calling it now this place will be the first to close. 3/10 
* on a return trip I noticed the price of the slice has now been reduced to ¬£4, much more reasonable but still annoying it was so high to begin with. 

Egg co. - Bacon egg and cheese, ¬£8.50. The bacon is really good, nice and smoked maybe just the wrong side of how a like it, i like it more crisp. The egg is really good, soft, creamy and nicely seasoned. The bun is a brioche bun its a bit soft for the overall sandwich, it has soft egg, soft bread, not crispy bacon, it needs something else to make it pop, maybe it would be better if it was more toasted. I wouldn't even be able to tell if there was cheese in here if some hadn't stuck to my teeth. Overall its nice but needs more cheese and  eess some other texture to make it pop.  It would make a good lunch but as with most things at CSC its on the pricey side for a bacon and egg sandwich.  7/10. 

Pakistani - chicken wrap with garlic naan and tamarind sauce ¬£13ish. The naan is stodgey, its not even warmed through, its warm in bits and cold in others, it's  definitely bought in. The chicken comes in two forms chicken tikka bits and a couple of kebabs, the tikka bits are perfectly fine, they arent dry but arent exactly moist, at best they are middle of the road. The Kebabs are defo out of a packet and are poor, only managed to eat one and left the other. The whole thing is also drenched in tamarind sauce, its so sweet and there is so much it ruins the whole thing. I would avoid this place, 2/10

Malaysian, beef rendang and white coffee ¬£14ish. Ordered the coffee iced, its still warm. They have added a few bits of ice but they haven't melted properly so the the coffee has a cold watery top and a hot coffee bottom, its a mix of two temperatures when you drink and its a bit unpleasent. The meal comes with two massive portions of rice, really only needs one, it's just plain rice, nothing to shout about. The rendang is pretty small compared to the rice, I think they are making up for a small portion of curry with big portions of rice to fill it out. The sauce is fragrant with a tiny hint of spice its nice woth the rice. Inside the curry there is a couple of bits of potato and 10 tiny chunks of beef, that are a little chewy Overall its poor and very expensive, I won't be returning. 3/10

Tang bbq belly pork with rice ¬£13.99. So I had to ask how it works, apparently there are two options, Noodle bowl which you pick your own toppings or bbq with rice, I went with the bbq. The belly pork is very meaty and had a nice crisp skin with an amazing bbq sauce coating, its sweet and spicey a little like hoisin. On the plate there is also a fried egg, some cucumber, some pak choi, a portion of rice and a some cornflakes on top that also add a nice crunchy texture when eating the rice, something I'll be stealing for home cooking. Only issue I have is that the dish as a whole is dry, it would benefit from a sauce to balance the dry rice, dry bbq, and  fried egg (which isnt runny!) etc. This is the best place I tried at CSC for price to food ratio. I would say though i pronably should have tried the noodles here because i think thats what most people will go for but the frozen meat pick and mix puts me off. 7.5/10 

Locale coffee, latte ¬£4. Very very very good coffee, the staff were super nice, shout out to the girl that says hun alot. The coffee is a good temp, nice smooth drink and it has a chocolatey note to it. Gives marmadukes a run for its money for sure 8/10 

Ghanaian, waakye ¬£13. The rice and beans is sooo dry, its hard to actually get through the portion and I end up leaving a fair bit. The curry has a really nice sauce with a tangy sweet taste but the meat, I think its goat, is tough as boots, its also got big bones in so the meat to curry ratio is pretty poor. The sauce is the saving grace, which is genuinely nice its just unfortunate the rest is so bad. 3/10. 

Unit, cheese burger and standard fries, ¬£10. The burger some cheese, mayo, a slice of tomato and some sad looking lettuce on. The burger isn't great, its lacking in any real flavour and severely lacking in seasoning. When I take a bite all I really get is the taste of Mayo. The fries are, as with everywhere in CSC, frozen, boring, and unimpressive, they too are not seasoned and there is no obvious sauces available to spice them up (I would normally ask for some but I'm trying to review as it comes, or if its offered). Overall, it's pretty forgettable.  3/10

House of hebesha, spicey lamb curry with rice and pancake. The lady recommended the spicy lamb, I had no idea about the cost until she priced it up at the till, ¬£18! ¬£18! Absolutely outrageous. The rice is perfectly good, probably the best I've had in CSC but it is just plain rice. The pancake is awful, has a consistency of very soft tripe, with a hint of lemon, i just find it unpleasent to eat. The curry is a tomato base, it's got a good spice to it with an okay amount of lamb, but some of it is a bit tough for my liking. Overall, it's just underwhelming, and the pancake really isnt to my taste and the price is absolute madness, save your money and go to a nice resteraunt instead. 4/10


Pho for the people, Pho Qa ¬£15.99. I went with pho, its the namesake of the vendor and its probably one of the first things you think of when you think about Vietnamese food. When it's cooked I'm presented with a knife and fork, very hard to eat Noodle soup with a knife and fork. The presentation is also lacking, its either overfilled with broth so i cant see anything or they havent put much in it. The noodles are OK, nothing incredible, the chicken is just boiled and cut up to thin strips, its ok. There's a few bits of spring onion and mint leaves in there too. The broth is probably the best bit. It's like most things in CSC, very average. I wouldn't recommend this place based on the pho, annoyingly the chicken and rice looks better, if I was going back I'd try that. Overall, it's dull and so expensive for what it is, sheffield has loads of good noodle places atm, that are better priced.  3/10

Hungry Budha, masala dosa ¬£9. Pleasantly surprised with this one. It's a really light crispy pancake with a really nice spiced potato filling, it also comes with three dips, a green chutney that adds a nice little kick, a coconut one that has a nice mellow taste and a yellow curry sauce which to be honest feels a little pointless.  Its definitely one of the better places I've eaten, the price as with everywhere here is an issue, but at least the food feels fresh and its good to eat.  7/10 

Frerot - Steak and with truffle and parmesan fries - ¬£18 for the steak and ¬£7.50 for the fries. The steak is banging! Really nicely cooked and packed with meaty, salty, buttery, garlicy flavours. The fries are really good too, salty, cheesy and a nice truffle taste thats not over powering. My only issue is I'm not 100% convinced these fries are made in house, they feel generic and don't have any element of luxury considering the price. All together its an really strong meal but, like most stuff here, its on the expensive side at least this one is tasty.  8/10

There‚Äôs a creepy older woman who keeps on initiating small talk with me even though I don‚Äôt work with her and we were never formally introduced.

I‚Äôm still new so I try to be nice with everyone but this woman keeps on asking me how are my aging parents doing overseas and she seems overly interested in my personal life but at the same time stares intrusively at my body.

Anyway, a couple of days ago she stopped by my desk and started asking about my parents and my home country then she asked me if I wanted a coffee or tea so I said no. She kept on insisting so I said that it‚Äôs almost time for lunch so I‚Äôm not going to drink coffee.

Right before lunch she came to my desk again with two sandwiches that she bought from outside and offered me one so I told her that I just had lunch. Then she asked me to keep it for later so I told her that I already got a home-made sandwich for the afternoon.

She then told me that she‚Äôs going after work to a musical in a church to relax and asked me if I wanted to go so I said that I had plans. Towards the end of the day she sent me a link to that musical in the chat on Teams.

How should I handle this situation before it escalates? Should I nip it in the bud and be direct and tell her that her behavior is making me uncomfortable and I want it to stop? ¬†Or should I just ignore her going forward since I don‚Äôt work with her and hope that she gets the message?",5,1728586808.0,MensRights,2,1.0,False

I went on a dating site almost a month ago, and started talking with a guy, we agreed to meet up at a restaurant and had a really nice time, talked for four hours.  We exchanged numbers and he asked if he could kiss me. I said yes, and it was just a nice peck on the lips. He text me the next day and asked for a second date. We met up 4 days later at a restaurant and chatted, and again had a nice time. He again asked if he could kiss me at the end, and it was a nice simple lip contact only kiss. We both have kids and had our kids that weekend. But, he text me and then called and we talked for 40 min a few days later. We arranged a third date, at his place where we would cook dinner and watch a movie. I was nervous, but we again had a great time, we talked and I asked if we were to sleep together, would that be it? He told me he is not interested in just a one night stand. I ended up sleeping over. The sex was incredible. The next morning he made us coffee, and we watched a movie and I left. We've text every other day. We have a date scheduled tonight, drinks at my place then going to a movie. My question is, I'm used to being in constant contact, so I can't tell if this is typical of dating now? I would like to discuss where he is, and I would like to get to know each other on a deeper level. But, I worry it's too soon. He isn't on the dating site anymore. But, I know that doesn't necessarily mean anything. I also know that I've spent so much time in an unhealthy toxic relationship that I'm having to relearn how to be in one. Am I being too clingy? Am I making something out of nothing? ",2,1728586802.0,datingoverforty,9,0.75,False

This script also contains a trailer narrator who is completely optional and only exists to set the tone of a 1950s Monster Movie.

I take any criticism at all. If you have thoughts or notice a grammar mistake, PLEASE let me know.¬†

Context (Listener): You are an intern/assistant at a lab. You clean up non-radioactive messes and get people coffees. You also get first-hand experience with secret research into new elements, machines, and many other wonders of science. One night, with storm clouds brewing and roads blocked off, two scientists get into an argument, only for their separate fields of research to combine into something evil.¬†

Context (Female Speaker): You are Lydia Spearson, a woman born in 1925. Life hasn‚Äôt been good. Still, you fought to become a chemist, physicist, and scientist in many other categories. Now you have the basis for your next project in the form of a radioactive meteorite shard, and a storm to keep you inside and studying it. As a plus, that cute intern you like gets to keep you company. As a minus, your boss is incredibly irritable today. But getting yelled at by him will only be the second worst thing to deal with.¬†

Context (Male Speaker): You are Doctor Thomas Hallmore, an important director at a lab for various projects. Despite your status as a man of science, you fully believe everyone is out to get you. Everyone interrupts or interferes with your projects with their loud noises, insolent questions and bragging about their own. And what‚Äôs worse? The board recently entrusted a fascinating meteorite to someone you believe to be an unfit and incompetent woman. You‚Äôre at the peak of your anger tonight, and if anyone sets you off, they‚Äôll regret it.

Context (Trailer Narrator): This movie studio wants you to advertise their stupid movie about wasps or whatever but you're going to give it your all because you're a professional.

**‚ÄúTrailer Narrator Looks Like This.‚Äù**¬†

**Lydia:** Female speaker‚Äôs dialogue looks like this.¬†

**Hallmore:** Male speaker‚Äôs dialogue looks like this.¬†

**SCRIPT START:**

*\[Trailer music plays. If you want an idea of what, try Night On Bald Mountain or any kind of orchestral score you can find that sounds worrying and panic-inducing.\]*

**‚ÄúTo all watching this screen, find shelter and keep quiet! Run and don‚Äôt slow down! California is under attack! Not by The Soviets, and not by invaders from another world, but WASPS!‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúWith a human‚Äôs shape, but an insect's ferocity. With wings, fangs, and the strength of ten men! Their forces replenish faster than they can be killed, and they answer to no general or president. They only answer to their Queen, the beautiful and deadly WASPIA!‚Äù**

**‚ÄúWho is this radioactive tyrant? What does she want? And what could be worth this much destruction on American soil? Conquest? Glory? Hunger? Or perhaps a twisted form of Love.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúStay tuned, because in a short amount of time, you will experience horror like you‚Äôve never seen! Suspense like you‚Äôve never heard! And romance like you‚Äôve never felt!‚Äù**¬†

*\[The music fades and a lightning strike erupts. There‚Äôs a storm brewing outside. Inside, where it‚Äôs dry and warm, you walk through the laboratory hallways before opening the door to Lydia Spearson‚Äôs room. It‚Äôs filled with radioactive equipment and chemicals, with her looking fascinated with something on the table.\]*

**Lydia:** *(To herself)* And the water barely even boils. Interesting, very very‚Ä¶*(Realization)* Oh, you‚Äôve arrived! *(Concerned)* Please, assistant, you‚Äôre in the presence of intense radioactive materials. You should be wearing safety glasses.

*\[You put on your safety glasses and hand Lydia her coffee.\]*

**Lydia:** Perfect. And thank you so kindly for the coffee. I just love the way you brew it, and with us staying this late, it‚Äôs a welcome ray of sunshine.¬†

*\[You comment on how bad the storm is outside.\]*

**Lydia:** Yes, it‚Äôs a disaster out there. But on the brighter side, it gives me more time to work. And I‚Äôll need all the time I can get to figure out this meteorite.¬†

*\[As Lydia takes a sip of her coffee, you approach the meteorite in its case. You turn to her.\]*

**Lydia:** Get as close as you‚Äôd like, but no physical contact. Testing for that has yet to be conducted. 

*\[The meteorite glows in the night, fascinating you.\]*

**Lydia:** *(Proud)* Beautiful indeed. And that beauty is mine to study. How humanity can use it is unknown right now, but the chemical compounds this rock carried from the far reaches of outer space have to contain some sort of secret! And I‚Äôll find it.¬†

**Lydia:** Would you like to see something fascinating?¬†

*\[You say yes and follow Lydia to the table.\]*

**Lydia:** Do you see this liquid in the flask, next to the water? This was extracted from the shard itself. Watch what happens when I introduce electricity.¬†

*\[Lydia turns on an electricity-emitting device. The liquid glows and bubbles.\]*

**Lydia:** *(Fascinated)* It‚Äôs wondrous, the way it glows. I know it would be dangerous, but I‚Äôd love to just stick my fingers inside and see how it feels. I can‚Äôt, but I‚Äôm sure it would be nice and warm if I could.¬†

*\[You ask a question.\]*

**Lydia:** That‚Äôs a good question. With the water, I-

*\[She knocks over the glass and it falls to the floor, shattering.\]*¬†

**Lydia:** *(Panic)* The water! Oh, dear. Wet glass is always a pain to clean.

*\[It‚Äôs your job, so you try to clean it. While this pause happens, some angry footsteps emerge utside of the room in the distant hallway. They get closer and closer.\]*

**Lydia:** *(Sigh)* Don‚Äôt clean it. It was my mistake, I should be the one to sort it out. You‚Äôre our intern, not our slave. You shouldn‚Äôt need to clean-*(Hears Something)* Hm?¬†

*\[Someone angrily enters the room.\]*

**Hallmore:** *(Angry)* Lydia Spearson, I heard that!

**Lydia:** D-Doctor Hallmore! I didn‚Äôt mean to, I just lost track of where my hand was and-

**Hallmore:** *(Still angry, but calmer)* I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs ruining our research more, the storm or your incompetence. This is expensive equipment, and we‚Äôve already taken enough liberties for you.¬†

**Lydia:** *(Looking down)* S-sorry, Doctor Hallmore. I‚Äôll clean it up and ensure it won‚Äôt happen again.¬†

**Hallmore:** You can ensure by stepping down! If it weren‚Äôt for the board and their idiotic choice to let you keep that confounded rock, progress would be accelerated tenfold!

**Lydia:** There‚Äôs only one other person here with the knowledge required for something like this, but Raymond wants nothing to do with this meteorite. You know how irrationally scared he is of radiation.¬†

**Hallmore:** *(Bitter)* We‚Äôve let too many fools in this house of science. Doctor Volkov and his communist professors are close to a breakthrough and we have nothing to counter. I‚Äôd bet he gets to fire people without a laundry list of reasons. I bet he doesn‚Äôt have to work through weather like this! And I‚Äôd bet his spies are around here someone, waiting for someone to make a mistake they can capitalize on.¬†Someone like you!

**Lydia:** *(Under her breath)* It was just one flask.¬†

**Hallmore:** One flask? Woman, I am researching one of the rarest wasp species on earth! That requires caution and precision of the highest degree! Had I heard that shatter when I was doing something critical, three months of research could‚Äôve ended up down the drain.¬†

*\[You stand up for Lydia and say it was a mistake anyone could've made.\]*

**Hallmore:** I never asked you to speak for her. Your job is to provide us with our beverages and hold things we need you to hold. Stop trying to get into things you have no involvement with!¬†

*(Lydia, seeing the doctor turn on someone she considers a friend, gets angrier and more confident.)*

**Lydia:** Don‚Äôt drag them into this over my mistake! They‚Äôre allowed to have a problem with your treatment of me!

**Hallmore:** Is that true? Do you have a problem with how I‚Äôve been treating her?

*\[...\]*

**Hallmore:** *(Smug)* Go on, speak.¬†

*\[...\]*

**Hallmore:** That‚Äôs what I thought. Kindly take your business elsewhere, preferably the scientists who actually do their jobs instead of this clumsy little girl.

*\[The doctor walks to the door but stops on its edge.\]*

**Hallmore:** *(Intimidating)* Lydia, do you see this pistol? If I had to come up here one more time, I‚Äôll aim for the bachelor‚Äôs degree you didn‚Äôt deserve and pull the trigger.¬†

*\[Hallmore leaves the room to return to his duties. You apologize for not standing up.\]*

**Lydia:** *(Sympathetic*) No, don‚Äôt apologize for staying silent. I understand. He‚Äôs frightening, especially with that gun he carries for spies. I know he‚Äôd never threaten our lives with it but‚Ä¶still‚Ä¶

*\[Lydia takes a long sip of coffee.\]*

**Lydia:** *(Sigh)* I wish I could step up to him further, but some things are more important. And I don‚Äôt want you dragged into our drama. I don‚Äôt want you dragged into any of this. I just want you here.¬†

*\[You question this and say you can‚Äôt just stay here.\]*

**Lydia:** Oh, I know, but everything gets so frustrating when you leave to go help the others. Maybe it‚Äôs because I want more coffee‚Ä¶*(Lovingly)* Maybe it‚Äôs‚Ä¶*(Shaking her head)* Oh, no, that would be foolish of me.¬†

**Lydia:** Please, go out. Do your job. We don‚Äôt need to give the doctor more to complain about. The rain should clear up soon so we‚Äôll talk again tomorrow.

*\[Slowly, you leave the room and enter the hallway, but you hear Lydia ranting in the distance.\]*

**Lydia:** *(Angry, quiet)* Stupid bug-loving cod. Separating us, yelling about me. I wish he‚Äôd just go away! But every second I feel like he‚Äôs just buzzing over my shoulder to‚Ä¶*(Realizing)* Is something really buzz-*(Shocked)* AH!

*\[Upon hearing the scream, you rush back to the door.\]*

**Lydia:** *(Terrified)* I-It‚Äôs a wasp! It must have snuck on Dr. Hallmore!¬†

*\[Lydia runs for the door.\]*

**Lydia:** *(Whispering)* What do we do?

*\[You suggest getting the doctor.\]*

**Lydia:** We can‚Äôt get him! The wasp might escape and sting one of our other researchers. We‚Äôre dealing with dangerous equipment here, we can‚Äôt just have one of these in the lab.

*\[Thinking for a second, Lydia gets an idea.\]*

**Lydia:** What if we use that window and try to shoo it into the storm?¬†

*\[You offer to do it.\]*

**Lydia:** No, it‚Äôs my lab. I‚Äôll do it. I want you to close the door behind me, alright? Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll be fine.¬†

*\[Lydia approaches the wasp. You hesitantly close the door. Lydia rushes to the window and opens it. The storm seems to pick up when she does. Thunder erupts in the distance.\]*

**Lydia:** *(Stern, but a little scared)* Come on, you little troublemaker. Just be a nice bug and leave! I don‚Äôt want to kill something, so don‚Äôt make me do something drastic.

*\[The wasp still buzzes around. Another clap of thunder is heard. This one is much closer.\]*

**Lydia:** Oh, what am I doing? Negotiating with a wasp? I should get the newspap‚Ä¶*(Confused)* Huh?¬†

*\[A last thunderclap gets dangerously close.\]*

**Lydia:** What in the world is going on out there-

*\[A lightning bolt rushes into the room, striking the meteorite and causing a large blast that eats both the wasp and Lydia. The woman‚Äôs body morphs and changes at a fast rate, causing her to let out screams of sheer pain and horror. Finally, the smoke clears. You open the door.\]*

*\[Lying on the ground is not Lydia. It‚Äôs some sort of beast that has her face. It coughs itself awake and looks up\]*

**Lydia:** *(Exhausted)* W-What happened?...Why are you looking at me like that?¬†

*\[This beast slowly rises from the ground.\]*

**Lydia:** *(Worried)* Where‚Äôs the wasp? Where‚Äôs the shard? Where‚Äôs‚Ä¶

*\[Lydia finally looks at her own hands. All four of them.\]*

**Lydia:** A‚Ä¶AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!¬†

*\[Finally standing straight, this wasp-like creature looks down at you.\]*

**Lydia:** *(Stressed and in pain)* I feel them! I feel all four of them! This isn‚Äôt right! No one should have this many arms! Why do they look like this!? What happened to me!?¬†

*\[You walk over to her.\]*

**Lydia:** Stay back! Don‚Äôt come any closer! What if I hurt you? I don‚Äôt want to hurt you!¬†

*\[Ignoring her advice, you come over and feel one of her new arms.\]*

**Lydia:** *(Fascinated)* Oh my god, you look so small. *(Nervous)* W-whatever did this to me could still be on my hand! Don‚Äôt feel it, it might get you too!

*\[You look up at her and suggest that we need to get her help immediately.\]*

**Lydia:** *(Upset)* What would a hospital do about this? My problem isn‚Äôt a broken arm, it‚Äôs four arms! What do I do now? I‚Äôm hideous‚Ä¶I‚Äôm a complete freak of nature‚Ä¶

*\[Tears start to roll down her eyes as she slumps onto the floor, crying. You crouch down next to her and try to provide comfort.\]*

**Lydia:** You‚Äôll‚Ä¶what? *(Surprised)* Help me? B-But I don‚Äôt even know what I am! This could put your life at risk! And for what?¬†¬†

*\[For her.\]*

**Lydia**:...For‚Ä¶me‚Ä¶.*(Romantic silence)* I‚Ä¶I understand. I think I finally understand‚Ä¶

*\[As she says that, a pair of footsteps are heard stomping in the hallway. They stop at the door.\]*

**Hallmore:** *(Furious)* I heard that! What do you think you‚Äôre-*(Terrified)* WHAT THE-

**Lydia:** D-Doctor Hallmore! I can‚Äôt explain!¬†

*\[Doctor Hallmore pulls out a gun and points it at Lydia.\]*

**Hallmore:** You! Get away from it! Now!¬†

*\[You don‚Äôt want to.\]*

**Hallmore:** Whatever it is, it isn‚Äôt Lydia! Now get up!¬†

*\[You do as the armed man says.\]*

**Hallmore:** Make yourself useful! Find a rope and tie this monster up.¬†

**Lydia:** *(Stressed)* I‚Äôm not a monster!

*\[Lydia slowly gets up.\]*

**Lydia:** I‚Äôm still Lydia. I‚Äôm still a scientist. I‚Äôm still‚Ä¶

**Hallmore:** *(Fantazing)*...Beautiful‚Ä¶

**Lydia:**...Huh?

**Hallmore:** Those wings‚Ä¶those arms‚Ä¶your colours‚Ä¶everything. You‚Äôre a human-sized insect. That means‚Ä¶*(Laugh of realizion)*...The board would love to hear about you‚Ä¶

**Lydia:** The board? No, don‚Äôt tell the board, we need to-

**Hallmore**: They‚Äôll give me more budget! Maybe ten more men! And we could keep you behind a cage and run all sorts of tests. Use the project that was stolen from me and find things we‚Äôve never-

*\[You step forward and try to dissuade him. Hallmore just flashes his gun at you.\]*

**Hallmore:** *(Angry)* Shut up and do as you‚Äôre told, intern! Get that rope before we lose this chance!¬†

**Lydia:**...Lose this chance?

**Hallmore:** Not another word from you either! *(Convincing)* This is how we finally get rid of this unfit, incompetent woman! This is how this team could become a highlight of the world scientific community, and I earn the respect I deserve!

**Lydia:** *(At her breaking point, breathing heavily)*...I won‚Äôt let you take everything from me!¬†

*\[Lydia rushes to you and grabs you with all four of her arms.\]*

**Hallmore:** Let go of them!¬†

**Lydia:** *(Sincere)* I‚Äôm sorry for this, my dear.

*\[Acting quickly, she throws you into a closet and closes the door.\]*

*(From the other side, both characters shift. Lydia starts to sound confident, and powerful. Meanwhile, Hallmore can hardly hide his fear.)*

**Hallmore:** L-Locking a person in a closet! That‚Äôll be your meal soon, won‚Äôt it? All you deserve is a maximum security cell and-

**Lydia:** I am finished with you. Breathing down my neck, wanting me gone. It all ends here.

**Hallmore:** Back away or I‚Äôll shoot!

**Lydia:** For the longest time, I‚Äôve wished you‚Äôd just go away. I wished someone would just get you off the project so I could have peace. But if you want something done, you should do it yourself.¬†¬†

**Hallmore:** I am this project! I am American Science! Don‚Äôt you under-

*\[In one quick flash, Lydia dashes forward. She grabs Hallmore by the neck, replacing his speech with the sound of his choking as Lydia grabs his throat and lifts him up.\]*

**Lydia:** *(Confident)* I am so much more now. And this is all you‚Äôll ever be!

*\[Lydia kills Doctor Hallmore. It‚Äôs up to the ASMRist on how brutal the death is. Most movies of this time and era weren‚Äôt brutal relative to what we have today, so I imagine him being 1. Strangled. 2. Hit really hard a few times. 3. Thrown against a table. Either way, he‚Äôs left dead on the floor.\]*¬†

***(With Doctor Hallmore dead, all dialogue from this point on belongs to Lydia.)***

*\[There are a few moments where Lydia looks over her work and realizes two things. 1. She just killed a man, 2. She feels nothing. She walks over to the door and opens it.\]*

Are you alright?

*\[You ask what happened.\]*

*(Nervous)*‚Ä¶Don‚Äôt‚Ä¶Don‚Äôt panic, please. Promise not to panic.¬†

*\[You promise.\]*

‚Ä¶Hallmore is dead.

*\[Lydia‚Äôs arm quickly goes onto your face.\]*

You promised not to panic! Please, just calm down. It was him or me, and it had to be done.

*\[Each of her arms grabs something as she lifts you out of the closet. Two lift you up, one covers your mouth and one covers your eyes.\]*

*(Comforting)* Here, do you feel my arms around you? It‚Äôs like a big hug. Just breathe. Breathe into my hand. You‚Äôre okay. I won‚Äôt hurt you. I‚Äôm covering your eyes so you don‚Äôt have to see it. Now let‚Äôs get you out of there.¬†

*\[Walking a little bit, she puts you down and lowers herself to your height.\]*

When I take my hand off your eyes, I want you to only look at me‚Ä¶

*\[Lydia uncovers your eyes.\]*

See, it‚Äôs just Lydia. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶*(Heartbroken)* You still look so scared‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶Perhaps this will calm you down‚Ä¶

*\[Taking a risk and acting on impulse, Lydia gives you a kiss. (To the ASMRist, this can be as brief/long and tame/passionate as you want.)\]*¬†

Are you calm now?

*\[The kiss, with how abrupt it is, briefly distracts you from the murder. You ask why.\]*

Because I‚Ä¶I‚Äôve had feelings for you. You were always so much nicer to me than the others. You went out of your way to help me, you listened to my interests‚Ä¶*(Frustrated)* It‚Äôs why I had to kill him.¬†

You wanted to support me through this. He wanted me in a cage. I knew which one of you I had to side with instantly. And now we can work together and find a cure‚Ä¶

*(Thinking)*...Actually‚Ä¶Why do I need a cure?

*\[???\]*

I‚Äôm stronger like this. Unique like this. I‚Äôm something‚Ä¶completely new. Powerful! Maybe this is what all my research was leading up to! A beneficial mutation.

*\[You tell Lydia that she should seek help with her transformation.\]*

What if I don‚Äôt need help? What if everyone else is the problem?

I‚Äôve been pushed around my whole life. I was told I needed someone strong to protect me. But maybe I should be the strong one, protecting my loved ones. And my loved one is you.¬†

*\[You step back a little as she looks at you.\]*

*(Intimidating)* I‚Äôm sorry, darling. But I‚Äôm not letting you leave me.¬†

*\[The monster catches you quickly, wrapping you in all four of her arms. She carries you to the closet.\]*

If I kiss you again, will you calmly go back into the closet?¬†

*\[You shake your head no.\]*

Well, I‚Äôm still going to do it.

*\[She gives you a little peck on the cheek before throwing you in the closet and locking the door with a chair.\]*

This is for your own good. We just need a few changes. 

*\[To what?\]*

To everything. I tire of this country. Of these people. Why should I continue to do research on such fascinating things for it alone? Why can‚Äôt I use my intellect for myself?¬†

We‚Äôll have a new country. A natural civilization, but advanced as well! One like the animal kingdom, but so far beyond it! One ruled by a queen who can protect her subjects better than anyone! That will be what I turn California into. Our Kingdom of‚Ä¶Waspia.¬†

So just stay there, my love. The others are likely hiding out as Hallmore told them to if any chaos struck. I‚Äôll use him and any others who resist as examples. And soon, this place will be all mine.¬†¬†

So rest easy, darling. It‚Äôll be an eventful day tomorrow.¬†

*\[Dramatic music sounds off as The Wasp Queen leaves you in the closet. The music fades out and is replaced with something calmer, and the narrator comes back.\]*¬†

There‚Äôs a creepy older woman who keeps on initiating small talk with me even though I don‚Äôt work with her and we were never formally introduced.

I‚Äôm still new so I try to be nice with everyone but this woman keeps on asking me how are my aging parents doing overseas and she seems overly interested in my personal life but at the same time stares intrusively at my body.

Anyway, a couple of days ago she stopped by my desk and started asking about my parents and my home country then she asked me if I wanted a coffee or tea so I said no. She kept on insisting so I said that it‚Äôs almost time for lunch so I‚Äôm not going to drink coffee.

Right before lunch she came to my desk again with two sandwiches that she bought from outside and offered me one so I told her that I just had lunch. Then she asked me to keep it for later so I told her that I already got a home-made sandwich for the afternoon.

She then told me that she‚Äôs going after work to a musical in a church to relax and asked me if I wanted to go so I said that I had plans. Towards the end of the day she sent me a link to that musical in the chat on Teams.

How should I handle this situation before it escalates? Should I nip it in the bud and be direct and tell her that her behaviour is making me uncomfortable and I want it to stop? ¬†Or should I just ignore her going forward since I don‚Äôt work with her and hope that she gets the message?",3,1728586684.0,AskHR,9,0.8,False

We have a pretty lively scene and I play every weekend as well as playing digitally thanks to tabletop simulator.

My nearest big city is 4 hours away in Halifax Nova Scotia.  The group chat I've joined since starting the hobby in June pretty much only travels to the city to play in GTs which are two day 5 game afairs with around 50 players.  I just went to my first one and it was a blast.

GTs are regional affairs where as RTTs are local tournaments, happen once a month, and are just 1 day 3 game affairs.  However the mearest RTT to me is in Halifax which is four hours away or an 8 hour round trip.

The schedule for those days are rough.  They start at 9am which means I have to hit the road at 430am.  They last until 6pm and I usually don't get on the road until 7ish so I usually get home around midnight.

I have friends and family who are 'concerned' with my trips.  They contend its a waste of money(its ~$80 in gas plus a $20 entry fee plus another $20 for McDonalds breakfast and random coffees thru out the day) and also they're concerned about me driving alone(which I truly don't understand).

I personally love the trips as I get to partake in my hobby and meet new people.  Its also the only time I get to blast my music and podcasts without my mom or neighbors complaing about the volume or content.

I guess the reason I'm asking if its unreasonable is I'm considering adding a second monthly trip for another tabletop game I play called Kill Team.

I guess my question is how many 8 hour road trips to play nerdy ass table top games per month is too many?  Is 1 the limit but 2 a bridge too far?",2,1728586315.0,NoStupidQuestions,20,0.75,False

I was overwhlemed with toxic workplace, my physical health declining, and basically feeling like I can't push myself anymore. After multiple sessions (2 therapists, 1 psychiatrist), I was diagnosed with inattentive adhd and was prescribed atomoxetine (strattera). The doc said that it would help my anxiety as well. Just after I got the meds, I was prescribed gabapentin for my physical health issues - so I had to postpone starting adhd meds.   

After taking 10 mg atomoxetine for a week, 25 mg for the 2nd week, I was supposed to follow-up with my psychiatrist. But he was unavailable and I later found out that he quit the organization. So I consulted another psychiatrist from the same org, and she prescribed me Escitalopram from my anxiety and told me that we would wait on the ADHD meds until few more sessions. After a few more sessions, discussing about my earlier diagnosis, sharing my DIVA report, I was asked to fill in SASI. After this, I was prescribed strattera again (10 mg for the 1st week, 18 mg for the 2nd week). And now, in my follow-up, my doc said she might not be allowed to give a prescription for ADHD medicines through online sessions according to her org, so we will have to search for someone who I can consult in my city. She said she will find someone and inform me, and I am now waiting for her with no medicines in the meanwhile.   

The reason I had to go for online sessions with them was because I couldn't find anyone who would help with adult ADHD in my city, and there is a lack of awareness here so even getting the prescribed meds has been a hassle. So I don't think it will be easy to find one who can prescribe meds to me without me travelling for 2-3 hours for each session (and the fact that i will have to travel for the session and wait in the hospital is making me anxious because I am already tired with all the discrimimation i went through for the medicines so far). I just don't even know what to do. I am mess in every way. My room looks horrible, I don't know how i have been living in it, i have been stepping on things all the time. Now, I think i am having imposter syndrome regarding my diagnosis - do i even truly have ADHD? I think coming out of an abusive relationship doesn't help at the moment, but I am questioning myself more than the usual.

I didn't put I was trans in my profile and he didn't seem to have noticed based on pictures.

He's a sound engineer and a film student and we hit it off immediately talking about weird obscure films and he spent a while basically info dumping about this art film group from.the 60s he recently got into. Despite all this he seemed really open minded and kind of fun. We went on our first date today. We had coffee and then went to see one of the films made by that group that was showing in a small arthouss cinema ad a part of an anthology.

I thought things were going pretty well. Until after we had left the cinema and he said in cryptic but understandable way that he didn't want to have any romantic or sexual relationship with me. This is why I put stealth in quotes because he somehow managed to clock me. In general I pass pretty well, to the point I have had several doctors assume I'm either a cis woman or a pre transition trans man, but I know I'm not uncklockable and that anyone who has spent enough time around trans people could sniff me out.

I wasn't expecting this would be some deep or long lasting relationship but we had a really good vibe together and I was hoping for at least a few dates and maybe a hookup if all went well.

1g0q4ol,https://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/1g0q4ol/ironman_703_waco_race_report_long_post/,IRONMAN 70.3 Waco - Race Report (Long Post),"**Background/Training:** Waco is my 3rd 70.3. I've done North Carolina twice, and while that is an awesome race, I wanted to try a new event. So I worked hard this summer to significantly improve my times. Cycling is my favorite, so that training came naturally and was so fun. I rode well over 3,000 miles this year before race-day, and I'd say 75% of that was just me going out to ride because I enjoy it so much. Running has always been my weakness (I have really short legs, like 25 inch inseam short...) So I worked hard this summer to shave time there. I did swim team as a kid and was a collegiate water-skier a few years ago, so I've always  been comfortable in the water and managed the swim well. I didn't really train that much for the swim, just swam 1-2x every other week to make sure I didn't forget how to swim. I figured I'd be fine... (foreshadowing). My goal was to finish under 6 hours, something I had yet to do.

**Pre-Race:** I live in Chicago, and Waco is a Sunday race. Driving is about 16 hours, so I split it up into 2 days. On the Thursday morning before the race, I loaded up the car with my bike and all my gear and started the drive down south. Day 1 of driving was about 11 hours to Muskogee, OK where I got a cheap hotel room. Checked in that night and hit a short 4 mile run to get some blood back in the legs after a long day of driving. Cleaned and lubed up my bike drivetrain before going to bed. The next morning, I found a small bike trail nearby and rode 20 miles to get a loose spin and do a systems-check on my bike. I found an empty airstrip just off the trail and had a lot of fun doing sprints up and down it. Everything felt great!

Hit the road again for Day 2 and got into Waco that Friday afternoon around 3pm and unloaded all my gear into our Airbnb. It was a cool, old-industrial warehouse building that was converted to a mixed use building. It was a 5 min walk from transition/finish line. Ideal location.

I quickly ran to the store to pick up some last minute supplies and was joined shortly thereafter by my dad at the Airbnb (we were doing this race together). Athlete check-in was open until 7pm on Friday, so we unloaded my dad's gear and then made the short walk over to race central to get our packets and checked-in. I was really glad we did this on Friday evening because it was way less-crowded, and just one less thing we needed to worry about on Saturday. From there we went to a local BBQ joint for some good ole fashioned Texas BBQ.

[Terry Black's BBQ - Brisket and a Beef Rib](https://preview.redd.it/s2lzn6ju3ztd1.jpg?width=1134&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00c42d44dfba327b694e91e46bdc3ffc0f6d9936)

On Saturday morning, we stickered up our bikes and rode them over to transition to check them in and get our timing chips. This race has one singular transition area with Swim-In/Bike-In and Bike-Out/Run-Out being the same. This made it very spectator-friendly and really easy from an athlete's perspective compared to North Carolina, which is a split-transition. Some people were deflating their bike tires before racking them because the temperature midday was up to 90F+ but I figured mine would be fine and they were.

From there, we met up with my mom, brother, his wife, and their baby daughter for lunch. After lunch, we walked over to the Magnolia Market at the Silos and checked it out. Not my particular cup of tea, but my mom and sister-in-law enjoyed it, so it might be worth checking out if you're in town. We hung out for a few hours before my dad and I retreated to our Airbnb to get out of the sun, hydrate, and gather our gear. Then we all met back together at a local Italian restaurant for a good carb-loaded pasta dinner, and all hung-out at the Airbnb watching some college football and playing with the baby before retiring to bed.

**Race-Day Morning:** Normally, I sleep awful before an event like this, but I surprised myself and slept very nicely. We woke up at 4:45am and got some food, water, and coffee in ourselves. A bagel with strawberry jam, a bowl of oatmeal with banana and honey, black coffee, and drip drop electrolytes. While eating, we got a notification via the IM App that water temp was 81.1, wetsuit optional. Dang. Oh well. We then gathered up all our gear and headed to transition. It was a pretty warm morning, I initially wore a sweatshirt but took it off pretty quickly. We got to transition at about 6am and set up our area. We borrowed a bike pump off a neighbor to double check our tire pressures. Everything looked good and we started the walk to swim start. I wanted to use a bathroom but the lines for the port-a-johns is always absurd. I decided to wait.

The walk to swim start is very easy, 15-20 mins. We were both feeling good, and everyone else around us seemed to be in good spirits. Once we got there, the lines for the bathrooms were even longer than transition, so we both found some dark trees and quietly hid behind them. It wasn't long after that they started lining up athletes, so we handed off our morning clothes bag and fell in line. I was expecting to swim about 40 mins, but I also knew that the later I started the race, the hotter it was going to be. So my strategy was to seed myself in the 30 min swim group and start the race as early as possible to limit my exposure in peak heat. This turned out to be both a good and bad idea... my dad wanted to wear his wetsuit so he started in the back. They played the national anthem, the gun went off, and they rolled us into the water 3 at a time.

**Swim:** So I mentioned that I started with a faster group than I actually swim myself. Well, the swim course you start by swimming straight out into the middle of the river before making a right turn and then following a straight line for 1.2 miles. Because I knew I was slower than those around me, I didn't want to cause a pile-up at the first turn and get completely swam over, so I booked it to that first turn buoy. Big mistake. I made it to the turn just fine, but as soon as I made the turn, I realized I was already gassed! I tried to settle down and recover, but the damage was done and I couldn't get my breathing back to rhythm. I had forgotten how to swim (foreshadowing come full circle). My mind started racing and I was worrying that I'd ruined my race. I thought I was done. I was fully panicked. I basically doggy paddled to a kayak after about 300 yards and tried to catch my breath. The volunteer was so kind and encouraging, but damn I was so mad at myself. I chilled for about 2-3 mins before setting off again. I felt a little better, but I was still not back to my rhythm. So at about yard 700, I grabbed another kayak, and tried to figure it out. I rested for about another 2-3 mins before setting off again. I felt much better this time. I soon saw the buoys change from yellow to orange, meaning I was about half-way done, and I settled in nicely. I cruised onward from there at my expected 2:00/100yd pace, but I had lost several minutes. I had to make it up elsewhere. I saw the last orange buoy and set my sights on the final red buoy, marking the turn to swim exit, which always seems to take forever to swim to. Swim exit is a set of stairs with handrails and the volunteers were basically chest deep in the water fishing all of us out lol. I appreciated that. My mom, brother and sister-in-law were there waiting at the swim exit yelling at me. I gave them a wave and a fist-pump and soldiered on. The run to transition is a steady incline up from the river to the street before crossing the street and into a grassy field where transition is. Despite, my early swim struggles, I felt decent coming out of the water. The heart rate is always zooming, but I took some deep breaths while putting on my bike gear and got it \~mostly\~ under control. I sucked down a gel, grabbed several more along with my favorite gummy candies (shoutout Jewel-Osco Fruit Slices), grabbed my bike and left transition.

**Swim Time: 47:22** - Oof. Slowwww but honestly surprised I only lost 7 mins off my expectations.

**T1 Time: 6:31** - Pretty standard. Room to grow here but I'm not mad at it.

**Bike:** Ooooo baby. It's time to cook. I had mentioned earlier that cycling is my favorite. I absolutely love it. If I was going to make up any time, this was my chance. I nailed a perfect flying mount and within 4-5 pedal strokes, I knew that this was going to be a monster ride. The legs felt pristine! I have a rough estimate of what I think my FTP is, maybe 240, so I figured 210 would be a good figure to sit at. But the legs felt so good, 230-250 started feeling really comfortable. I was hauling! I was passing people pretty consistently and only got passed myself maybe 4 times? And one of those guys was a bigger dude than I was, so I caught him on the uphills, and then he'd catch me on the descents. I pulled alongside him and joked with him about this, he was a good dude. I eventually pulled away from him towards the end. Eduardo, if you're reading this, follow me back on Strava!! There were A TON of flats and several crashes. I'm not sure how the crashes happened but I passed probably 5 people on the ground. The flats I'm going to attribute to really hot temperatures and pot holes. Not that there were a lot of holes, but there were some and if you weren't paying attention, you could easily hit one. Road conditions were overall fair at best. From miles 22ish-36ish (very much a guess) you're riding on chip-sealed pavement, which isn't terrible, but it was definitely not that fun to ride on. I passed a guy right after we got off of it and we both commented how happy we were to be off of it. I will say, to the organizers credit, the bike route is coned off for the vast majority of it. At no point did I feel unsafe next to cars.

[Eduardo, my new best friend, and I climbing one of the few hills.](https://preview.redd.it/gxpg51o14ztd1.jpg?width=2134&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfee4aa7a3c5be2842b07d0ced1e9e0000d70ab5)

Anyway, the course is described on the IM website as flat, and for the most part it is, but there are about 5 punchy climbs on the route. Probably no more than a hard 2 minute effort. I'm a smaller guy and climb pretty well, so I just hammered these hills and tolerated the quick HR spike. If you can recover well, I'd recommend this. I made up a lot of ground doing this. My nutrition plan was simple: One gel every 10 miles, starting at mile 0, and then a handful of gummy fruit slices at miles 15, 30, and 45. I brought 2 bottles with me on the bike. One with plain water, the other with drip drop electrolytes. At the first aid station I took water, quickly took some gulps, sprayed it down my back and tossed it aside. At the 2nd aid station, I took water again and refilled my plain water bottle. Then at the 3rd I took both water and mortal and refilled both my plain water bottle and electrolyte bottle. I knew the run was going to be brutally hot so I made sure to drink a lot on the bike. As I got to the end of the bike, I knew I was making excellent time. I had estimated a 2:45 bike ride if I was lucky... but as I got closer, I realized I was on pace for 2:30! WTF?! I thought to myself how cool would it be to go under 2:30 on the bike so I tried to really book it the last few miles but I fell 1 minute short. Damn, next time, I suppose. 

[Did someone say new Strava profile picture??](https://preview.redd.it/dnx4ee2i4ztd1.jpg?width=2134&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=338325128368247d35adb47d0e539d1251f66e4b)

Back to my initial decision to start the swim early, it paid off on the bike, not only did I start in cooler temperatures, but the wind was much more calm to start the day. My Wahoo said 2.2 mph winds. My dad, who started an hour after me faced 11 mph winds and got a headwind for a significant portion of the ride.

**Bike Time: 2:30:58 -** Average speed 22.3 mph, Average power 241 watts, Strava said it was my best power output for 1 hour. So quite literally the best I've ever ridden a bike.

Coming into transition, I saw my family again and they knew how awesome that bike ride was. They were arguably more excited than I was. My mom made the comment how few bikes there were on the racks, so she knew I had made good time. My brother lifted his 80lb dog over the barrier to give me some paw. Part of me was a little concerned that I had overdone the bike and didn't leave anything for the run. But I already don't run that fast, and if I was going to go under 6 hours, I had to play to my strengths. So again, I took some really deep breaths to settle down. I took off my bike gear, put on my run gear, and headed back out. My family was waiting for me on the other side of transition so I made sure to swing by them and exchange a few words. I yelled ""I think I cooked myself a little too hard for this run"" and my mom yelled back ""No! Don't say that!!""

[Leaving T2 to say hello to the family](https://preview.redd.it/7gi4ui0h5ztd1.jpg?width=2392&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6715d9aa150bded56cb85de45ac482a868eebfdb)

**T2 Time: 3:26 -** Again, pretty standard. Could probably pick up a minute but I'm not mad at this.

**Run:** This now being my 3rd 70.3, I knew not to trust whatever my legs were telling me as I started the run. They always feel so heavy and unwilling to move for the first 20 minutes. I just  kept telling myself to keep a high cadence, turn the legs over and over, and they'll come around. In my training, I had been running 9:30 min miles, I knew I'd be slower than that come race day, but I just didn't know how much slower, especially given the 93F heat. Sure enough, the legs came around fine enough, and I was averaging 10:30 min miles. The aid stations were positioned at pretty much each mile, so I'd try to run the mile, and then walk the aid station. I got water and mortal at each aid station, and then for calories, I'd switch off between coke and orange slices. 

As for the run course itself, some people liked it, some people hated it. I'm in the camp that liked it. The course is kind of a loopy, windy mess that doubles back on itself several times. The markers make it easy to follow, and I liked it because, say, as you're on mile 3, you see mile marker 6 on the other side of the path and the aid station. Then as you get to mile 5, you say to yourself ""oh I remember where mile 6 is! I can make it to that!"" Similarly, at mile 10ish, you start to cross a bridge that takes you to Baylor's campus. For the people running on the other side, there's an aid station and the volunteers are yelling ""One more mile to go!"" So in my head, I'm thinking omg I just got to make it there and then it's one to go! There are sections of the course where you loop around a parking lot, and a Baylor tailgate lot that's gravel, but I didn't mind too much. Other people, were pretty vocal about their dislike for all the loops and doubling back. To each their own I suppose.

[Crossing the bridge into Baylor's campus](https://preview.redd.it/lilewwa15ztd1.jpg?width=2134&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e807f63751ebc88c7d8fb4c1ae1b85e8f3653612)

There were sections of the course that were pretty exposed to direct sunlight, and those were pretty hard. There's a bridge you cross over 3 times in particular that was noticeably hotter than the rest of the course. But anyway, as I got to mile 10, I was doing the mental math in my head. I had 3 miles to go, 45 mins left to reach my goal. So I thought to myself, ""okay you can run 15 min miles and you're still gonna make it. Don't over do it, don't hurt yourself, dial it back, settle in, and bring it home."" So I did! I started walking in between aid stations when I got tired and for those last 3 miles, I was averaging 11:30. I could've gone faster but I didn't need to. I was gonna meet my goal and I was good with that.

The last half-mile is pretty cool because you're headed back down the riverwalk and you can see the suspension bridge finish line in front of you. It's right there, you can see it! It came up way faster than I expected and I made the last climb up to the bridge and saw the finish ahead of me. The finish line is super cool. The bridge is lined by spectators on both sides and it's just a straight shot. I saw my brother holding his baby over his head in the distance and started waving and fist-pumping to them. I gave them high fives and quick hugs and then ran to the finish. I pumped up the crowd as I finished and heard my name called. I was gassed but I accomplished what I wanted to. I made big mistakes on the swim, and I know I'm capable of running faster, but I stuck to my cycling strengths and it saved the day.

**Run time: 2:20:30**

**Overall Time: 5:48:44**

**Post-Race/Conclusion:** Post race food was actually pretty good. BBQ pork sliders, black bean wraps, chips, and drinks. Everything was centrally located so it was really easy to get your morning clothes bag and stuff from transition without walking too far. Overall, I am very happy with my showing. I screwed up my swim, but I'm honestly more proud of my bounce back to have an incredible bike leg. Yes, with a better swim and better run, I could easily get under 5:30, but hey... I need a goal for next time, no? Overall, I do recommend this race but only if you're okay with the heat. Like I said, it was 93F on the run and the swim was not wetsuit legal. But this race was extremely easy logistically, and the course itself was not technically difficult. If I lived closer, I would probably be back next year, but it's a long trip from Chicago and there's some other 70.3s I hope to try next!

i shat myself, then went to shit out the rest on the toilet, set the trousers on the toilet while i had a shower, took the trousers off the toilet and went down to put in the washing machine (though i may have put the trousers in the wash before the shower i cant remember the order), then went to start wiping down the toilet with the diarrhea in it, washed my hands a few times during then after

after all that i went to clean up some coffee granulate that had spilled on the bench earlier that day, part of it must have been partially moist before because some of it was sticky, like it had gotten wet then dried. but anyways i wipe most of it with one hand into the other, some going onto the ground, then washed off the granulate stuck to my hands (mainly the one the stain later mentioned was on), i went to get some wipes to get the coffee off the floor, after which i washed my hands, went and cleared the rest the remaining coffee off the bench and washed my hands, it likely there other instances where i also did but i cant be certain, but confirmed 4 times, not all guaranteed to be thorough though,

later though im reading my book and a while in i find a brown stain on the back of my finger, on the edge of the nail, i immediately go to the bathroom to wash it off, not really getting a good opportunity to inspect it, all i know is that it was a little tough to wash off and required a bit of a rub

i havent read the book since, as much as id love too, but im to worried its got poo on it.

today, and this is pretty gross so click off if your sensitive to that; but i had taken a shit but had to answer the door before i could flush, i come back half an hour later to piss, not having yet flushed, once i pissed i got a bit of the pissed on shit, similar to the kind of the day i shit myself, rubbed it on my finger to how easily it would wash off and compare the results with how the stain on my finger reacted to the water. the amount of shit on my finger was bigger than the stain on my finger the previous time, some of it immediately came off but some of the remaining debris required a rub off

does it only matter, if theres visible brown stains on the book, im more the kind of person who is worried about invisible contaminants.

so thats where i am, at this point do i just buy a new copy? could a shit stain really have survived 4 handwashes?""

AITA?,"Hi everyone, I've been listening to the podcast for years and I wanted to get an opinion becauseI am generally curious to know if I am the asshole for being upset about this.

I will accept the judgement whatever it is. also fake names just because.¬†

  
so I, (21f) moved to a different country at the beginning of this year to finish my BA. I now study at an international university where most people are not from here. The reason why I say this, is because moving countries is really hard especially if it's a country that speaks a different language than yours, so it is really hard to make friends and real connections.

despite that, I met 2 people in my first month here and we quickly became friends. It was also their first semestre living in a different country and they felt the same as me. So, me, Carrie (20sF) and Jack (20M) became really close. Later on, Ali (20F) also join in our group, although me, carrie and jack were closer to each other than to Ali, we are still close.



By the end of the semester we were so inseparable that people say that they only saw us together. We go out just for talking and spend hours discussing life, school, family etc.



They were the first people that made me believe I could stay here because the cultural shock those first few months were hard. Anyhow, that was 10 months ago and last week I was talking to a different friend, who last year was one of Jack‚Äôs roommates. He asked me during a conversation what had happened to Jack‚Äôs girlfriend. I was super confused at first and told him he didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend, because as far as I knew he didn‚Äôt.



It was a super casual interaction that I actually forgot about it, until a few days later Jack and I were going to get coffee with an acquaintance and we were talking about a date she had had, she then asked us what our types are and that reminded me of the conversation I had with Jack‚Äôs former roommate and said¬†



The following conversation happened:¬†



Me- Hey,¬† why does (name) thinks you have a girlfriend?



Jack- what do you mean?



Me- oh last week he asked me about her and I told him you don‚Äôt have a girlfriend but he really thought you did¬†



Jack- uh that‚Äôs weird¬†



Other friend- why would he think that?¬†



Jack- well, I kinda have a girlfriend¬†



\*me stopping dead on my tracks in the middle of the streets\*



Me- WHAT???¬†



Jack- What?



Me- why have you never said anything?  


Jack- Yes, I have¬†



That was followed up by him INSISTING he told me, Carrie and Ali¬†



Now listen, I have an amazing memory and that boy has never once mentioned he had a girlfriend.¬†

As soon as we got back to campus we ran into Ali and I asked her¬†



‚ÄúHey did you know that Jack has a girlfriend?‚Äù



To which she proceeded to be very confused and shocked. She also had no idea and she swore he never told her.



Jack‚Äôs roommate was sitting in a table nearby and screamed ‚ÄúI told you he had a girlfriend‚Äù



Jack proceeded to tell us that he has been dating the same girl since before he moved away and now they are doing long distance. I asked him again, why has he never said anything to which he first said that he did, but later said ‚Äúhave you never seen the pictures I am tagged I?‚Äù¬†



Ummmm, no??? I am not about to stalk him especially because I did think we told each other everything¬†



We were still talking about this when Carrie left her class and met with us



She also didn‚Äôt know he had a girlfriend and she was even more shocked than me and Ali¬†



That issued a whole discussion where Ali said that she would do the same thing if she started dating and wouldn‚Äôt tell us, some people overheard and said he had the right to privacy, but me and carrie were really hurt.



We don‚Äôt care that he has a girlfriend, we cared that he didn‚Äôt tell us because he has been saying that we are his best friends for months, telling us he trusts us more than anyone but he lied about this, and he is not even telling us why. He just shut off¬†



Carrie and I started to feel like assholes after because yeah people do have their right to privacy, but if its your best friend or a close friend, you would tell them you are in a relationship‚Ä¶right?



Are we wrong? Or is this weird?¬†

Try to go places and talk to girls (not choosy), not one thats into the whole FWB or one night stand thing. Not a playboy, I am polite and nice, help people, but cant seem to find anyone, been looking for over 8+ years. Just not sure what I am doing wrong. I dont ghost people, not hidious or anything. 



Like when I go out and try to meet people, not even sure what types of places to even go for stuff like that. I'd be happy just hanging out, going on dates, car rides, movies, normal stuff. 



Just seems everyone is like OMG under 120K-250k+, you dont have a fancy car like a Bentley, Dont live an a magical castle, FOR SHAME, FOR SHAME!!! YOUR WORTHLESSSSSSSS!!! SHOO SHOO!!!!! Like when I said I wasnt choosy, i understand not everyone is a super model, just want to know where can meet a nice, decent girl? Like is there some sort of maze have to conquer, magic spell have to use to summon one, or are we to the point in society where you have to sell your soul in order to meet or find someone. Its sad now a days.

Just havent a clue where the ""RIGHT"" places to look or really what to do. Like you see all these cuter type movies on hallmark or whatever like where guys and girls meet at coffee shops or something as stupid as bumping into one another at a super market. Heaven forbid that happens in real life, If you bumped into girl at a supermarket (even on accident) your more than likely gonna end up as America's most wanted as a serial molseter...



I realize that technology and way society is now a days has really ruined relationships. noone can trust or take a leap, just want to fill there needs and call it quits, I am to the point of defeat because its just so hard to find anyone to click with that would enjoy something as simple as snuggling on the couch watching a movie, talking about something as stupid as what does that cloud look like to you, or making dinner together, or just for the heck of it drive around for no reason other than drive around. I am not a person thats into one night stands, FWB, or anything like that. 



Realize im not perfect by any sense of the word, quirky, a bit shy, but just getting to the point feel like I am always just gonna be alone or unlucky or am the unworthy one. The other is there are more guys that girls so makes it even harder.



Not a ""bad boy"" type. I read light novels, play games on my PC, build computers, (IT guy by trade).



I find it utterly truly hilarious when people say its a men's society and MEN hold the power. HAHA That is totally wrong. A lot think that but look behind the scene's women truly run this world and make the boys think they rule. Boys are truly idiots lol xD sorry off topic‚Ä¶



Anyway to main point ""idk what I am doing wrong, where the correct places to meet anyone, and what it is that girls really want'. If you read everything I am sorry for rambling or if I was all over the place.

[>#Update 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fz056l/update_5_aita_for_telling_my_bfs_best_friend_the/)

So...Sam & Max are getting married.

Just kidding - But I am updating because Max finally responded to my messages and agreed to meet with me. After the party about a week ago, Max crashed on Harry's couch and then left before anyone else had woken up, turning off his phone and going M.I.A. He's back on the grid now, though, staying with his parents until his place is ready, so when I messaged him and invited him to coffee, he decided to come.

I know there were comments advising me against meeting him at all, given his treatment of me, but I think we both needed some closure. I think it's one thing to need closure after loving someone for years, but hating someone for years and then finding out that you were both wrong is another level of fucked up. So yeah, we went to cafe and we finally hashed it out. It was super awkward, and somehow there's even more to this story than I thought, but I think before I share any of that we should start at the beginning. The VERY beginning.

I met Sam during Fresher's week in my university, he was a year above (19) and I was a fresher (18). Max didn't go to uni at all, actually, but had gone straight into an apprenticeship after sixth form, and only visited our uni on the weekends. I didn't meet him in person until second year, when I became a lot closer with Sam and his friends (I was 20, Sam was 21, and Max was 23). Their mothers were childhood friends and so put a lot of pressure on Sam and Max to not only get along, but to also be extremely close. That pressure to be close and get along also affected Sam's uni life, as Max would often visit him on the weekends. I wasn't particularly close to Sam during my first year, we were just in the same friendship group since we did similar courses, but I do remember frequently hearing about Sam having a friend from home over. However, Max was never introduced to the group. When speaking with him, Max said that Sam would brush off the idea, saying that he didn't want to split his attention with anyone else and so Max shouldn't worry about 'doing the rounds of his uni friends'.

Sam wasn't able to keep Max separated forever, though. Max was able to make himself a part of the group when Harry (another mutual friend) had an internship that summer in the town Sam & Max were from. As he spent his time bouncing between their homes, they all became much closer (hearing that I joked that Max definitely should have stayed with Harry at the beginning of this ordeal since he clearly owed him - but I think Max still felt too guilty to laugh...lol). All that background to say that Max strongly suspects that Sam's lying could have begun when he felt as though his uni friend group was threatened by him, and that he wanted to regain some control (that's not exactly what he said but I've reworded it with the help of my therapist - oh yeah, I'm in therapy now!).

Anyway, by our second year at uni Harry was very pro-Max and invited him up independently of Sam to hang out. Their hometown is incredibly close (like... a twenty minute drive away) so whenever Max was off work he begun to hang out more and more with us, eventually becoming a permanent fixture in the group. It was around this time when I first met Max at a Christmas party one of the people on mine and Sam's course was throwing. I don't really remember it myself, I think I was quite drunk, but I didn't think much of it. On the other hand, Max tells me that he remembers it quite well. This part of the conversation was by far the most awkward part, but Max told me that practically the minute they arrived he had asked Sam to introduce us. I asked him why, and he hesitated at first until he admitted that he was interested in me. Yeah... bit of a plot twist there? In case anyone was wondering, no me and Sam were not yet a thing - in fact, Sam wasn't even on my radar until about a month later - so I can't tell you if he felt threatened or anything like that. For his part, Max admitted that his interest was short lived and that it was unlikely that Sam genuinely felt threatened (especially since I didn't even remember our first meeting), but he thinks this fact may have contributed to Sam's lies centering on me cheating - a subconscious worry because of Max's former interest.

In my opinion, Max's theories on why Sam did what he did didn't make a lot of sense to me, but that may be either because I don't know Sam like he does, or the opposite - that Max is too close to the painting to see the whole picture. Regardless, I thought I would share it with you guys to put your minds to rest - since so many were still begging for me to dig around and find a root cause. I can also sense many comments pushing me into trying to figure out whether Max still likes me or not, and I'm just telling you now that you're jumping the gun. I need a serious break from relationships right now, and Max is actively looking for a therapist. Also, a vengeance-fueled hook-up isn't going to end well for anyone and I seriously doubt that his feelings are sustained/renewed. The meeting was so awkward that the only emotions I could read off of him was guilt, shame and discomfort. So sorry, but my life is not a movie, just a series of unfortunate events üòâ

Me and Max have gone our separate ways, ending on a good - if not awkward - note. We each got to apologise to each other for everything - Max for the abuse, me for the bitching (yeah I used to bitch about that guy to other people like it was a national sport) - and we both agreed to let the other know if Sam ever contacted them again. I finally asked him about the real reason he got kicked out of his apartment! It turns out that the story Sam gave me was a lie (who would have guessed) and that it turns out Max's girlfriend was actually cheating on him - hence his dramatically sudden and insulting exit from their apartment. He said it wasn't an excuse, but an explanation for why he had such a volatile reaction to my refusal to let him stay - as combined with the things Sam told him about my cheating and isolating tactics - he felt as though Sam was going through a similar thing to him. I assured him that I'd long forgiven him, that Sam was a big enough scapegoat for all of us to move forward regardless of everything else, and that I'd see him at the next dinner party our friends hosted. Yeah, I know many people wanted me to ditch them, but after Sam's lies were revealed and they realised they had also all been affected, they banded together pretty effectively and kicked him out of their lives. It hasn't been easy navigating the tensions in the wake of Sam, especially given that there is now no mediator to diffuse tensions, but the silver-lining is that there is also no narcissist who will use those tensions to his own advantage and pit people against each other. I'm just taking it slow and not expecting too much.

In personal news, though, I took a lot of the advice in the comments about joining local groups to make new friends. Daisy is also slightly friendless since she's been abroad for so long, and I didn't think it was a good idea to bring her into Sam's (my?) group of uni friends during such a ... tumultuous time. I don't know how to refer to them, since they only became my main group of friends after I graduated and started dating Sam - but regardless, Daisy doesn't know them very well and I don't think their personalities would match. So! Instead! We've been going to a couple paint and sip sessions, gigs, bars, and other fun places here and there. It's been amazing watching our friendship blossom despite everything and I just need to reiterate again that she is the loveliest human ever and I am so lucky!!!

Okay. That's the end of the update, and probably the final one since I don't see anything crazier than this is happening any time soon. I hope everyone who has supported me thus far is experiencing success, good health, and even better friendships. I will continue to reply to comments as much as I can and check DMs, thank you so much everyone for all the engagement, good and bad, and for supporting my growth ‚ù§Ô∏è

#Comments by OOP:

*(after somebody told her she shouldn't fish for updates and have other priorities)*

I never said it was. I just thought since there is now a large audience following this that it's only fair that Max (and in a way Sam) got fair representation. Max isn't an AH, and Sam's reasons for lying might be more complex and emotional than we gave him credit for. I want the opinions I do receive and the criticism in these comments, to be fully informed so that I can believe it.

- 

when I was younger I used to wish my life was more exciting and more like a soap opera - now I'm mature enough to realise it's a waking nightmare to actually be in this much drama. Hopefully there will be no update - as I don't intend to ever hear anything from or about Sam ever again - sorry!

(audio narration available)","I was lucky to have u/Siker7 do an awesome narration of my response on his channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztvToBIBSI4).

----------

My husband was poring over the newspapers on the kitchen counter as I crept up behind him in my pyjamas.

""'Businessman knifed to death in reclusive Townsend bungalow,'"" I read out the headlines over his shoulder. At the first word, he jumped up quicker than a cat would've, empty coffee cup in hand, ready to smash into my skull. Then he relaxed. I raised my eyebrows at him. ""Hey, that's just over in the next town. Weren't you there last night?""

""Crazy coincidence, right?"" he said, swiftly placing the ceramic mug noiselessly on the marble top, a feat which I'd found impossible to replicate. ""You're up early. First day jitters?""

""A little,"" I admitted. The untimely death of my uncle from a heart attack a week earlier had left me at the helm of the family business, a few years earlier than expected. Today would be the first day I officially assumed my new duties. ""I've got an important recruitment today."" The beep of the washing machine sounded, distracting me. ""You did the laundry?""

""I had some exercise clothes to wash,"" he said, pouring me a cup of coffee. ""And I thought you'd be occupied this morning.""

""Awww, you sweet man,"" I said, dropping a kiss on his head. ""I've some time, so I'll hang them to dry now.""

""No, I'll do it,"" he said quickly, stirring in the milk with almost inhuman rapidness, but I was already pulling my white blouse out of the washing machine. There was a red stain across the chest. Blood. I looked at him, and his face was pale.

""Ah, silly me,"" I said, smacking my forehead. ""I forgot to soak my period-stained underwear in hydrogen peroxide beforehand. And you must've selected the hot wash.""

A transfer of blood of this kind would require an amount closer to me bleeding out my entire body. An amount, in fact, consistent with that from a knifing. But my oblivious husband wore a look of relief.

""It's all right,"" he chuckled, taking the blouse from my hands and chucking it back into the machine. ""Let's run the wash a second time. And if the blood's still there, I'll get you a new blouse. My money just came in today.""

""Money?"" I wandered back into the kitchen, wondering why my husband, a crack shot, would have chosen to kill at close range. Then my eye landed on the newspaper article, where the subheading read: *Rival with personal grudge suspected.*

Ah, to fake a crime of passion. I nodded approvingly. Smart.

My husband twirled me around for a lingering kiss, and as he pulled away, I saw that he had smoothly closed the newspapers. ""It's too fine a morning for such fixation on grim news, my love,"" he said. ""Yes, my money. From the stock market. I do day trading, remember?""

Yes, I did remember. He'd been doing day trading ever since I'd overheard him discussing security standards and asset neutralisation on the phone years earlier, a conversation he'd promptly ended when he'd spotted me. He'd come up to me hours later (after extensive research, I was sure), twittering on about how he'd been trying to pursue market-neutral strategies when building his asset portfolio.

""Ah, yes, you're always making killings in the stock market,"" I said, keeping my face straight. He flinched a little at my choice of idiom, but was otherwise unaffected.

""Yes,"" he said, ""lucky me, so I get to enjoy my hobby of birdwatching.""

A hobby he'd developed when, weeks after that earlier phone call, I'd walked in on him on another call saying, ""The eagle has landed."" Now he did all of his communications over text.

""Are you looking out for any birds today?"" I asked idly, picking up my cup for a sip. ""I see that you've packed that."" I jerked my chin towards his backpack, where a rifle scope poked out.

""Ah, yes,"" he said, nearly jumping over the low-lying coffee table in his haste to tuck the offending item out of view. ""A new scope, for my camera. You won't believe the beauties I'd taken with this."" He hurtled nimbly back to my side, taking his phone out of his pocket as he showed me some close-up shots of kingfishers and hummingbirds.

The pictures were gorgeous. And would also explain the bill for the various photo-sharing websites charged to his supplementary credit card.

Then his phone chimed, and a text message scrolled across the top: *Target located at...*

He whipped his phone away, desperately swiping the message upwards to dismiss it. I turned away so he wouldn't see me smile.

""Anyway,"" he said in a valiant attempt at nonchalance, ""what was it you said? You've got an important recruitment today?""

""Yes, as a matter of fact, I do."" I put my mug down and looked at him, wondering how to begin.

""Well, go on, then,"" he said, stowing his phone into his pocket. ""Who're you supposed to recruit? And how'll it help your family business?""

""Oh, they'd be an invaluable addition, with their skill and foresight, *on the job* at least,"" I said. ""I've heard, though, that they're not quite so meticulous in their personal lives.""

""You can't gauge potential employees by their personal lives,"" he said reasonably. ""They have enough stressors on the job, home is a safe space they can relax in.""

""You're right,"" I said. His phone chimed again, and he checked his watch. ""You need to leave?""

""No, it's okay,"" he said, though I noted the nervous energy with which his fingers were drumming the counter. Possibly he was already late for whatever mission it was. ""Your new job's more important. So, what about the recruitment?""

I surveyed him, this six-foot, well-muscled assassin who was as deadly as he was dear. ""No, it really is nothing much,"" I said.

""You sure? I know you‚Äôre under a lot of pressure, now that you‚Äôre the boss.""

""It‚Äôs nothing I can‚Äôt handle,‚Äù I said, smiling. ‚ÄúGo on. The early bird catches the worm, you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks, honey,‚Äù he said, leaning in and kissing my cheek. ‚ÄúWell, in this case, I'm trying to catch the bird, so...""

""The early slug catches the bird,"" I suggested, thinking of shotgun projectiles.

""Slugs are too slow,"" he said with a laugh, shouldering his backpack.

*Just like you, sometimes,* I thought affectionately as the door closed behind him. At that moment, my phone buzzed. It was a call from my chief advisor.

""Good morning, Ma'am,"" greeted the consigliere. ""My apologies for calling so early, but you‚Äôll need to hear what the *capo bastone* of the other society has done. Possibly the time has come for him to be eliminated. A job, I think, suitable for the new recruit?""

""Ah,"" I said. ""No, one of our usual will do.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut what about that recruitment you were handling?‚Äù

I watched my husband through the window as he walked out the front gate. He turned around and waved at me with a toothy grin.

Home was a safe space he could relax in, only if I was his wife and not his boss.

And if that meant I would still continue to be privy to his antics, well - it was a pretty sweet deal.

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I said into the phone, as I waved back at him, my own smile just as wide. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre nixing that recruitment. Permanently.‚Äù

I have recently been experimenting with masterbatching my oils. It has been working well and really speeding up my soap making. I am currently using a wax melting pot to do so. The problem is it is only a 5L pot and does not hold enough to do my large molds in one go. In looking for a larger vessel to melt my oils I stumbled across these coffee urns/water boilers from webstraunt store. They are 5 gallons which would be plently and they have adjustable temperature control. (Says min is 120, although the dial appears to go to 80). Has anyone tried something like this? Is there any reason why this wouldnt work? I would love to buy a dedicated soap making melting pot but I am not in a position to spend that much money right now and this seems like a workable alternative. I was also toying with the idea of using an empty 5 gallon oil bucket with some type of heater (immersion or band) but it seems that it would take a long time to heat up, plus I wouldnt be able to turn it on as I put my oils in to melt them. Any advice or ideas are appreciated. Thanks!",1,1728585660.0,soapmaking,1,1.0,False

So i will give an example on how my bestfriend is lets call her Sara (22 f)...i know sara from highschool...sara is the ideal child she gets good grades she has a lot of friends and everybody likes her...honestly i was surprised that we stayed friends after highschool because i was a selectively social person...okay so Sara and I remain friends after school and Sara is geniunely a nice person we went to different colleges but we were still close amd met each other often....

Well college changed things for me and her...her course demanded her to be in front of the books all the time whereas my college life was amazing i became a proper extrovert and made friends with everyone ....here is when the problem begins Sara starts becoming possesive about me when i introduce someone else as my bestfriend to he She goes ahead and makes it a point to say ""Well only i am your bestfriend right"" yeah it bugged me a bit because i am allowed to have more than 1 bestfriend but i let it slide as she had been through a lot with her family issues and studies which made her kind of an introvert...

She still was a wonderful friend to me but then came moments when she would constantly critize me and my parents and how they dont allow me to stay out at night or let me out on a sleepover...i am sure every girl with conservative parents know the struggle about all this...but it became a constant thing that she would whine about....Well now sara gets a job and she is doing good for herself so we dont meet often now because her schedule is busy while i am pursuing law..

This is the beginning of when it gets weird between me and her... I get into a LDR with an amazing guy my boyfriend (25 M) and i am excited to introduce him to Sara ...In the first conversation Sara asks my bf how is his mother if she is a nice person and when i asked her why are you asking this she said "" Well you know i gotta know how your in laws are so that you dont get stuck in future"" mind you this conversation is only happening 15 days of me dating this guy .....odd i know...and well my bf now looking back at the conversation believes that she was jealous of me finding a guy when she was just getting over an intense 2 year relationship...

Well i get an internship for few months which demands me to work for the entire day beyond working hours...Sara one day calls and starts whining about the fact that i dont give her enough time and how i am always giving her an excuse of working all the time...well i didnt know where that came from because we barely talked or met when she was working ...but the people pleaser that i am i apologized to her and said we will meet soon ....

Here is the catch whenever i made plans for meeting sara was always busy with work...i understood her situation and let it slide until...we planned on meeting at a cafe and sara hasnt reached or picking up my calls for past hour...she picks up the call and says she cant come something came up last minute to which i lashed out and she felt guilty and came 2 hours later after the decided time...we had food which was very expensive and i thought that we will split as usual but Sara Says that she forgot her wallet and there is some issue with the bank so she cant pay ....i ended up paying a 1000 bucks for 2 coffees and 1 sandwich out of the 2000 bucks that i earn from this internship...well i didnt say anything and let it slide because being a pushover and people pleaser is my lifestyle....

2 months after this incident my father passed away from a sudden heart attack it was hard on the family and i was the one who informed all the relatives and friends about this tragedy i numbed myself that day because as the eldest daughter the responsibilities fell on my shoulder ....i informed my friends who were staying nearby and asked them to inform all my other friends whom they know...and i asked my booyfriend to inform Sara because i know that she will make a fuss if she got to know that i talked to any friend of mine that is not her about this incident...well my boyfriend informs her and all my friends arrive including Sara...and i heard this from my friends few days later that instead of mourning about this Sara went ahead and asked each and every friend of mine how they got to know about this incident...i went no contact with everyone except my boyfriend and family during this period and after sometime i got to know from my boyfriend (god bless his soul for putting up with all this)that Sara has been bombarding him with texts every hour of the day to know whether or not i am talking to him or if i am talking to anyone else...

I had asked my boyfriend to not tell her that i am talking to him because she will make a fuss...well it feels nice thats she cares about me but the catch is she never once contacted my sister whom she has known since she has been friends with me instead she is texting my boyfriend about me who is 1000 kms away..i lost it and i decided i wont talk to her for a while ....

I called her a month later after my father passed away and she started crying saying that she thought she lost me as a friend 5 seconds after this she asked me whether i had been talking to anyone for the past month including my boyfriend...me being the person hating confrontations said no ...to which she said of course i am your bestfriend you will obviously come to me first if you need anything right...yeah that didnt sit well with me but i ignored it and made it seem she is the first person i talked to ....

Almost a year later everthing is fine between us and my birthday arrives ...its a little hard hitting on me because it would be the first birthday without my father around...Well Sara calls me up and tells that she is gonna take a day off from her work to celebrate my birthday with me...i was over the moon and genuinely excited ...cut to the day of my birthday and she cancels on me saying that some work came up...so naturally i felt bad but i said it was okay and we decided on meeting 2 days later on a weekend which was also the date on which my father passed away (fyi not the exact date and month he passed just the date like 16th of every month) now since he passed me and my family had decided that 16th of every month we would make sure to spend time with each other because he would want us to remember him and his stories atleast 1 day of every month....since on my birthday month the 16th came on a weekend i thought i will spend few hours with Sara and then go back to my family...my mother didnt like that i was ruining the tradition but i fought with her and went to meet her...well Sara and I had planned to meet up at a particular spot which we would enjoy...well Sara reached on the decided time but i was running late because of traffic and i inform sara she says that its fime she can wait....well 10 mins later i get a call from Sara saying that she is going back home because it has been 20 mins she has been waiting and i am disrespecting her and i always do this to her and she is tired of my parents being so conservative and she always has to understand ...she is always being taken advantage of ...i was shocked at these statements but i didnt wanna increase the issue  so i apologize and ask her to just wait for 5 more mins because i was almost there ...she didnt agree to that and went back home...i kept on apologizing to her on text on which she replied its okay ...and when i asked her if she could tell me why she felt this way ...she left me on read.....i was devastated that she treated me like this especially on my birthday...so i finally got annoyed by this and decided to not text her anymore because she was leaving me on read anyways...i waited for 1 month for her to atleast start a conversation but it never happened...i was finally over it and ended up blocking and deleting her contact...

I returned so often to reread the responses. Now he's 1 year old I wanted to share our little journey for others who are in my shoes.

I still remember the first night with LO in the hospital - he screamed so long he ran out of breath and turned purple. Again and again. He curled up into a ball and arched his back and just screamed... that set the tone for the months ahead.

Back home, he would only calm down when we bounced him. So we would do that for hours on end and alternate shifts. We had Youtube videos of hairdryer noise running almost 24/7. I read that things get better at around 10 weeks of age, definitely by 12 weeks of age. So I waited, hoping.

They didn't get better.

Age 4-5 months was a NIGHTMARE. We had a super grumpy and *angry* baby. He was constantly complaining, constantly kicking his legs and crying. He hated the stroller. He HATED being in the car. He hated being in the carrier. (Still loved being bounced, RIP my arms.) Hated going to sleep. Loved nursing, thank god (despite a 3-week on/off nursing strike). Hated going out because he would get overstimulated so quickly. Hated anyone touching him.

Anyway, cue 6 months... we finally nailed down his (multiple) food intolerances. I had been convinced he had food intolerances from the early months but our ped hadn't been very supportive. It took a lot of trial and error on our side but his digestion finally stabilised. And a happier baby started to emerge.

It was only at 8 months we considered a holiday somewhere, and at 10 months we went out to a restaurant. He's 12 months old now and last weekend he happily sat on my lap and played with a spoon in a cafe while we drank coffee in peace! He loves going out for walks in the stroller and every time we leave the house his face lights up and he wants to look at *everything*. Now we're planning our first flight abroad for when he's 14 months.

He's still not an easy toddler, but guys... he's *fun* now. I really enjoy spending time with him. Him starting to crawl at 9 months made a huge difference. Now he's standing he's happy pretty much anywhere as long as he can stand. He LOVES food and loves eating. We taught him to sign and you can see his joy when he can communicate what he wants (with his three signs lol). He giggles all the time. His favourite thing right now is to lift our shirts and faceplant into our bellies and blow raspberries.

When I was in the trenches seven months ago I needed to hear stories like this. If you're in the Grumpy Baby Club... it really really sucks, but hang in there. Hopefully there's a giggly baby at the end of that long and noisy tunnel.",1,1728585533.0,NewParents,0,1.0,False

i know these kinds of posts are sadly all too common, but i rarely see update posts from the people who make them, and i know that at the time i posted, i desperately needed someone to tell me things were going to be okay. or that they COULD be okay, even. i wanted to come back and say that in my case, it did get better. it got so much better. 

i left the practice i was working at after i couldn't put up with the practice manager's apathy any longer. the therapists at his practice were barely above the poverty line, but he was sitting comfortably, and he just...didn't care. he kept blithely saying that things would improve but didn't do anything to fix them. 

i struck out on my own and eventually merged with a couple other therapists in similar positions. i'll be honest, learning how to run a business was hard, and we're still learning. it wasn't something that any of us really thought we'd be doing in our careers. but we went to webinars, called up old mentors and professors for coffee to ask questions and pick their brains, and read all that we could. we got a crash course in management and marketing all while continuing to build our clinical skills. those first few months were draining, but we threw ourselves into getting our name out there, building relationships, and cultivating a reputation in our community, and it paid off.

i had a messy breakup from my former practice. without getting into detail, it was bad. once one of his cash cows that was subsidizing his lifestyle was out the door, he reacted really poorly, and i was honestly a bit frightened for a while. but i stayed calm and took the high road as much as i could, and i got out. 

almost a year later, things are better, and they're still getting better. we've got a cute little office. i've got a full book and a waitlist. i'm able to comfortably and sustainably offer sliding scale spots. i'm still recovering from the hit my finances took after that time in hell, but i'm on track--as a group, we have healthcare benefits, retirement plans, and time off, things that we never had before. i'm starting to build my savings up again. 

i just submitted my application for full clinical licensure and i'm waiting on that. we're looking into taking insurance soon. as a practice we're doing our best to remember the hell that we were put through in pre-licensure and are working to be better, because the next generation of therapists doesn't deserve this. 

i know this is a bit of a novel. but if you're searching this subreddit wondering if it can get better, i just wanted to say that for me, it did. and i think it can for you, too. ",2,1728585335.0,therapists,0,0.75,False

I got home and bought the Vertuo next. Breville is nice, it‚Äôs newer, right? No, I am an idiot and didn‚Äôt do my research. I don‚Äôt care about making full sized coffee. The insanely excessive foam is absurd. It feels like a bad joke  seeing how much foam it creates. The machine spinning up and pumping sounds like an electric pressure washer if you‚Äôve ever used one. I ran a double pod with a cup that could handle all of the expected cream. It shook it out of place, I had to sit there and monitor the situation. 

I am not interested in being stuck buying their new patented half bubble pods, I prefer the old little ones and all of the variety.

Has anyone had any luck sending back a used machine? I‚Äôve had it for roughly 24 hours now. 

First picture is of a normal 40ml espresso pod and it did eventually even out to just under that, with waiting and stirring but there remained like 40ml more of foam??
(Second picture was one of the full sized coffee pods, I understand they are meant to produce 230ml so I knew I‚Äôd have to swap cups but I wanted to measure the foam, but a lot of this foam does not disintegrate even after sitting and then stirring. What the hell is this?

I‚Äôve now made coffee several times with it, and my conclusion is that it really has no purpose whatsoever.

The first thing that‚Äôs important to know is how huge this is. Here is a picture comparing the size of the XL to the regular Aeropress. Even though you have probably seen these pictures before, when you actually have the XL in front of you, you will still be amazed at how large it is. Especially when extended, it is definitely a grower! 

[Extended](https://preview.redd.it/74tr78o61ztd1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=afc55f6ee8704301e47d4a579bff8f4bd7d93f09)

The question is: Does size matter?

I made coffee using the XL in two different ways. The first time I made coffee using the traditional Aeropress method. I put the filter onto the cap and screwed it onto the XL, put the XL into the carafe, dumped two heaping scoops of coffee in, and poured the water in. Quite a bit of water leaks through before you start pressing. I stirred the coffee grinds with the extended stirrer that comes with the unit. Then I pressed. Pressing is quite the commotion as the top of the plunger is quite high. I‚Äôm a normal height man so it wasn‚Äôt a hassle, but a short woman might have a problem.

[Almost two feet tall!](https://preview.redd.it/1cvc6rgb2ztd1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=166b20d3458177b722709a45f8d691ddcebba0ea)

The coffee goes through nicely to the carafe, which is a very nice carafe.

I found the amount of coffee to be slightly less than 2 cups. At least the 2 cups of the mug that I use. The coffee tasted good like Aeropress coffee always does.

The second time I used the inverted method, which I prefer. Although I typically feel quite secure using the inverted method with the regular-size Aeropress, with the XL it felt somewhat precarious. It all went well though and I was able to invert the Aeropress without calamity. Once again it made roughly 1 and ¬æ cups of coffee.

Now let‚Äôs compare making 2 cups with the regular-size Aeropress. I do this frequently.

I use the inverted method. First, I put two heaping scoops of coffee into the Aeropress. Then I fill it up with water. I stir well and let it sit for a minute or two. I screw the filter on, and then I invert it and press it into a mug. This liquid is double strength compared to the regular Aeropress coffee, so it‚Äôs actually quadruple strength since I find Aeropress coffee to be double strength if you don‚Äôt dilute it.

I divide this quad-strength coffee into two mugs and then dilute it with hot water. The result is 2 full-size cups of coffee. The process is easier and safer and the regular Aeropress is smaller and easier to store.

I know others might disagree, but I think the Aeropress XL is simply a marketing gimmick to get us to spend even more money with Aeropress. I currently own a regular Aeropress, an Aeropress Clear, and an Aeropress Go. All of these variations make some sense.

The Aeropress Go is a little bit more portable for travel. The Aeropress Clear makes coffee-making much more delightful with a full view of the process. The regular Aeropress is a bombproof and inexpensive way to make good coffee. (I may end up buying an Aeropress Premium, as I do like the idea of avoiding plastic in my coffee making.) But the Aeropress XL really has no purpose in my opinion.

In conclusion, size does matter, but smaller is better!",15,1728584988.0,AeroPress,12,0.94,False

I just had to share my incredible journey with you all. Three months ago, I was in the darkest place of my life - broke, depressed, and completely alone. But thanks to the Law of Attraction, my life has done a complete 180. I'm still in awe of how quickly everything turned around!

Here's what happened:

1. Wealth & Dream Job: I started visualizing myself in my dream job every single day. I created a vision board with the salary I wanted and the type of work I'd be doing. Within weeks, I got a call from a recruiter about a position that seemed tailor-made for me. Long story short, I nailed the interviews and landed a 6-figure job that I absolutely love!
2. Depression: I committed to daily gratitude practices and positive affirmations. It was tough at first, but I kept at it. Gradually, the fog lifted. Now, I wake up excited for each day. My energy is through the roof!
3. Friends: I started putting myself out there, joining clubs and attending events related to my interests. I visualized myself surrounded by supportive, like-minded people. Before I knew it, I had a whole new crew of amazing friends who truly get me.
4. Love: I wrote a list of all the qualities I wanted in a partner and read it every night before bed. I even left space on my couch when watching TV, imagining my future partner sitting there. Two months in, I met the most incredible woman at a coffee shop. We've been inseparable ever since!

The key for me was unwavering belief and consistent action. I acted as if my dreams were already my reality. I stayed grateful for every little thing and kept my vibration high.

To anyone struggling right now - don't give up! Your dreams are closer than you think. Trust the process, do the inner work, and watch the magic unfold.

I'm living proof that the Law of Attraction can change your life in ways you never thought possible. Sending good vibes to all of you on your manifestation journeys! üôè‚ú®

To summarize, I‚Äôve been on and off coffee (and caffeine) since 2016. In 2022 and 2023 I had the biggest success with my hard and long effort to kick this substance out of my life.¬†



**In 2022,** I had only 10% of my normal caffeine intake. Considering that the year has 52 weeks, I have as much caffeine as I have in less than six weeks.¬†



**In 2023**, I made the big step and quit caffeine for good. In 2023, I had **ABSOLUTELY NO CAFFEINE.** I did not consume coffee, Coca-Cola, cappuccinos, or chocolate. I even checked meds before taking them.¬†



Unfortunately, **in 2024**, on New Year‚Äôs Eve, I decided to celebrate my one-year anniversary with a coffee mug. Bad idea was it, indeed, since it caused me a relapse.¬†



Although I did not consume caffeine or coffee as I used to, my intake has been clearly larger than the one I had in 2022.¬†



**Now, for the last three weeks or so, I‚Äôve had coffee daily. And, since July or August, I‚Äôve been having hot chocolate regularly.**¬†



Still, optimism is in me. Given my recent experience with caffeine and my conversations with ChatGPT on the subject, I guess that I am only psychologically addicted to it.¬†



Just to give an example, yesterday, I woke up at 5 am. I did not have problems getting out of bed. I did not have problems ‚Äúsurviving the morning‚Äù without a coffee mug. I was normal. I had energy after a good night‚Äôs rest; however, something inside me said that drinking a hot cup of coffee would be pleasant. So I had one. I had another two or three cups during the day. Again, I could have gone without them. Still, something lets me have them.¬†



**But that has to change!**¬†



I‚Äôve committed to quit caffeine, and this is the very reason why I am writing here. This is the very reason why I am putting in the effort of writing this very long post. I want to show commitment to the cause, and I want to make it: I want to quit caffeine.¬†



Probably, I‚Äôll be updating you on my progress in the coming weeks (we still have eleven weeks of this year) and will let you know how I am doing. I want to be accountable in someone‚Äôs eyes, and you, my dear community, will be part of this journey.¬†



One new thing that I will be doing this time is to use Google Gemini as a personal assistant. I will use Gemini to remind me why I am doing it. I will use it to make me accountable. I will use it whenever I need someone/something to encourage me, to make me move forward.¬†



AGAIN, from what I can tell, I am addicted to caffeine only on a psychological level. I firmly believe that in three weeks I can be off the substance once and for all. (I guess the big problem is to keep it out of your life for good.)¬†



As a way to motivate myself and you, ladies & gentlemen, here is a list of why I want to quit - again - caffeine. This time, the list comes from experience. You can add pros if you have any interesting ones.



I want to quit caffeine for:¬†



* better sleep¬†
* better mental healthy
* better oral health better energy levels
* better stomach health
* better stool
* better digestion
* better mental sharpness
* better focus¬†



These are the reasons why, now, I want to kick the vice out of my life. If you, too, want to kick coffee and caffeine out of your life, then join me. Follow my posts. Follow me on Reddit. Heck, even chat with me. This community, I assume, exists to help people who want to better themselves by quitting one of the most tolerated drugs on this planet ‚Äì caffeine.¬†



Best,

Dan!¬†

For Tom, a 50-year-old truck driver, that pace had started to feel a little too steady. After years of long hauls and rough hours on the road, Tom found himself in a rut. The long hours weren‚Äôt just taking a toll on his body, but also on his spirit. Ever since his divorce two years ago, his energy levels had dipped, and the confidence that once made him the life of every truck stop had disappeared into the rearview mirror.

Tom wasn't sure where to start picking up the pieces, especially in his personal life. Nights in motels felt lonely, and even on his days off, he found himself avoiding social situations. But things changed one night during a conversation with his buddy, Jack, over burgers and beers at their favorite roadside diner. Jack, a fellow trucker and an old friend from way back, had noticed Tom‚Äôs low energy.

‚ÄúMan, you gotta do something about this,‚Äù Jack said, shaking his head after Tom admitted that his get-up-and-go had gotten up and left. Tom sighed, leaning back in his chair, ‚ÄúYeah, I know. But what, man? I‚Äôm not exactly 25 anymore. And it‚Äôs not just the energy‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs everything.‚Äù

Jack smirked, pulling something out of his jacket pocket and sliding it across the table‚Äîa small bag of brightly colored gummies.

**‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù Tom asked, raising an eyebrow.**

‚ÄúAlphabites Male Enhancement Gummies,‚Äù Jack said matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúTrust me, these little things are gonna change your life. I‚Äôve been using them for a while now, and I feel like I‚Äôm back in my prime. More energy, better mood, and yeah, it‚Äôs helped in other areas too, if you know what I mean.‚Äù

Tom eyed the gummies skeptically. Gummies? Really? But Jack had a point‚Äîhe did seem more lively, more upbeat than usual. They finished their beers, and after Jack‚Äôs persistent urging, Tom agreed to give Alphabites a shot.

A week later, Tom was surprised. The change was subtle at first, but undeniable. His energy wasn‚Äôt crashing mid-shift like it used to, and even after hours on the road, he felt a spring in his step that had been absent for years. By the end of that second week, something else had happened‚ÄîTom had found his confidence again.

Rediscovering Himself Through Alphabites Tom wasn‚Äôt just feeling better at work; he was feeling better all around. His mood had lifted, and his old sense of humor was creeping back into conversations. But more than that, something had shifted in his personal life. It wasn‚Äôt just about feeling good on the job anymore‚Äîit was about feeling good in his own skin. He started going out more on his days off, meeting old friends, and even flirting a little. He didn‚Äôt feel the pressure to jump into a new relationship, but he realized something‚Äîhe was open to the idea again.

[Alphabites Male Enhancement Gummies](https://preview.redd.it/uj3250uebwtd1.png?width=470&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c2b9e1b77ebddc1be4b58cc6ed7d9bb6c4f794f)

It wasn‚Äôt just some magic trick; Tom did his homework. He found out that Alphabites were packed with natural ingredients that had been trusted for centuries to help men like him feel their best. Tongkat Ali, Horny Goat Weed, and Maca Root‚Äîthese were all names he‚Äôd never heard of before but soon came to appreciate. These weren‚Äôt your run-of-the-mill supplements; these gummies were designed to restore the balance in his body and improve overall vitality. And it wasn‚Äôt just about testosterone or physical performance‚Äîit was about mental clarity, energy, and focus too.

Finding Balance in Life and Work The changes didn‚Äôt go unnoticed by his coworkers, either. On a grueling long-distance trip, his driving partner, Pete, commented, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been different lately. Not as tired, not as grumpy‚Ä¶ what gives?‚Äù

Tom laughed it off, but inside, he knew that Alphabites had been his secret weapon. He was sharper, more focused, and no longer dreading those long shifts. In fact, he‚Äôd started taking on more hours voluntarily. The extra cash was nice, but what really drove him was the simple fact that he felt good again. There was a time when he thought his best days were behind him, but now he realized he had plenty of road left ahead.

When he hit his local gym after a shift, something he hadn‚Äôt done in years, the familiar hum of the treadmill beneath his feet felt invigorating. His endurance was up, and he wasn‚Äôt just going through the motions anymore. He had a goal‚Äîhe wanted to feel strong again, inside and out. Alphabites had given him that jumpstart.

Back on the Dating Scene Then came the moment that really threw Tom for a loop. On a warm Saturday afternoon, while browsing the local farmers market, he bumped into Lisa, a woman he‚Äôd known from around town. They got to talking, and before Tom knew it, he was asking her out for coffee. She agreed with a smile that made Tom‚Äôs heart skip a beat.

Sitting across from Lisa a week later, Tom couldn‚Äôt believe how comfortable he felt. He wasn‚Äôt fumbling for words or feeling like he was out of his league. The conversation flowed easily, and the laughter came naturally. That old charm he thought he‚Äôd lost? It was back, and it felt damn good. As they wrapped up their coffee date, Lisa leaned in with a playful smile, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre different these days, Tom. I like it.‚Äù

Tom grinned, knowing that his secret wasn‚Äôt some grand mystery‚Äîjust a little gummy that had made a big difference.

Alphabites: More Than Just a Supplement As the weeks went by, Tom found himself sharing his experience with others, just like Jack had done for him. He joined an online forum, mostly on Reddit, where guys like him were looking for real solutions. There, he discovered he wasn‚Äôt alone. Men from all walks of life‚Äîtruckers, office workers, retired veterans‚Äîwere sharing their stories about how Alphabites had given them their vitality back.

One story that stuck with Tom was from a man named Robert, a 48-year-old single dad in Texas, who had struggled with similar issues. ‚ÄúI was ready to throw in the towel,‚Äù Robert wrote, ‚Äúbut Alphabites helped me feel alive again. I‚Äôve got energy for my kids, my job, and I‚Äôve even started dating again. Who knew a gummy could do all that?‚Äù

Reading those posts reassured Tom that he wasn‚Äôt alone in his journey. Like Jack, he found himself wanting to pay it forward, to let other guys know they didn‚Äôt have to settle for feeling tired, old, or burned out.

A New Chapter As Tom looked at the horizon on his next long-haul trip, he felt more optimistic than he had in years. The road ahead didn‚Äôt seem daunting anymore. He wasn‚Äôt just going through the motions; he was living his life, rediscovering himself with each mile. And as for the future? Well, it didn‚Äôt seem so uncertain anymore.

For any man who feels like life is slowing down, Tom‚Äôs advice was simple: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to settle. You don‚Äôt have to accept that your best days are behind you. Sometimes, it‚Äôs the smallest thing‚Äîa gummy, a conversation‚Äîthat can change everything.‚Äù

**In the end, Alphabites wasn‚Äôt just a product‚Äîit was the key to a second chance at life:** [**https://alphabites.com/**](https://freezegluco.com/AlphaBites.html)",1,1728584291.0,PopularSupplements,0,1.0,False

A talking stage lasted about two days for me, and then it was over. Turns out I‚Äôm really, really bad at conversation when it comes to texting! Or the other person might just go ghost, which can be really frustrating.

  I don‚Äôt really go out too often; I‚Äôm a homebody, which I already know is one reason I‚Äôve never been able to get into anything with anyone. As of recent 20 though, I‚Äôve been wanting to go out more often, but unfortunately I don‚Äôt have my own vehicle right now, so it‚Äôs not like I can go out as often as I might want. I mean, my parents and siblings have no issue taking me places, but they‚Äôve obviously got their own lives and such. I do have a job, but I only just got this job recently.

  I‚Äôve tried dating apps before, and they just don‚Äôt seem to work out for me. I‚Äôve tried Bumble, Coffee meets bagel, and Hinge. I‚Äôve been looking into trying Tinder, but I‚Äôm super reluctant to, lol?? From what I‚Äôve heard, Tinder is more for hooking up anyway, and I‚Äôm not looking for hook-ups. I‚Äôm looking for a real deep connection with someone, which I feel like is another thing that stunts my love life, because people don‚Äôt really care for those ‚Äòdeep love, deep soul connections‚Äô types of connections anymore. Also, in my dating-app experience anyway, there seems to be a lot of people that look for other people that are into smoking/vaping. I don‚Äôt smoke/vape, I‚Äôm too much of a scaredy-cat towards stuff like that, so I guess that makes a lot of people label me as boring and avoid matching. 

  I‚Äôve only ever gotten really close to having something serious with people online, over video games. Im too reluctant to get into anything online though when the other person lives in a whole different state. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm willing to get into anything long-distance‚Äî But then, it‚Äôs so fucking hard for me to get into anything with someone that lives here??",2,1728584277.0,dating,1,1.0,False

Read a lot, here in reddit and everywhere else. Tried all possible ways from fresh beans to different roasts and grind sizes.

My problems:
I cannot understand what difference it makes to switch between Time based and Volume based in brewing? The AI software is not anymore giving me suggestions as it is used to do before? Did they change it? 

I see now time based is pre-set to 20sec. 30 sec. And so on....so regardless of the grind size it still brew for this time. I don‚Äôt see my shots consistent. 

When I select Volume based. I don‚Äôt know what does the machine do different? Can someone enlighten me how volume based work? I don‚Äôt weigh the portafilter. 

Another thing. What do you guys do when you change coffee type? When I try different coffee I have to go through all this dialing again. Why things can't be more user friendly breville. I like the machine otherwise and not yet at the point of returning as I still see a hope I might get to the sweet spot.

1g0pbwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1g0pbwv/quitting_caffeine_accountability/,Quitting Caffeine & Accountability¬†,"I am writing this post because I want to quit ‚Äì AGAIN ‚Äì caffeine, in general, and coffee, in particular.¬†



To summarize, I‚Äôve been on and off coffee (and caffeine) since 2016. In 2022 and 2023 I had the biggest success with my hard and long effort to kick this substance out of my life.¬†



**In 2022**, I had only 10% of my normal caffeine intake. Considering that the year has 52 weeks, I have as much caffeine as I have in less than six weeks.¬†



**In 2023,** I made the big step and quit caffeine for good. In 2023, I had ABSOLUTELY NO CAFFEINE. I did not consume coffee, Coca-Cola, cappuccinos, or chocolate. I even checked meds before taking them.¬†



Unfortunately, **in 2024**, on New Year‚Äôs Eve, I decided to celebrate my one-year anniversary with a coffee mug. Bad idea was it, indeed, since it caused me a relapse.¬†



Although I did not consume caffeine or coffee as I used to, my intake has been clearly larger than the one I had in 2022.¬†



*Now, for the last three weeks or so, I‚Äôve had coffee daily. And, since July or August, I‚Äôve been having hot chocolate regularly.*¬†



Still, optimism is in me. Given my recent experience with caffeine and my conversations with ChatGPT on the subject, I guess that I am only **psychologically addicted** to it.¬†



Just to give an example, yesterday, I woke up at 5 am. I did not have problems getting out of bed. I did not have problems ‚Äúsurviving the morning‚Äù without a coffee mug. I was normal. I had energy after a good night‚Äôs rest; however, something inside me said that drinking a hot cup of coffee would be pleasant. So I had one. I had another two or three cups during the day. Again, I could have gone without them. Still, something lets me have them.¬†



**But that has to change!**¬†



I‚Äôve committed to quit caffeine, and this is the very reason why I am writing here. This is the very reason why I am putting in the effort of writing this very long post. I want to show commitment to the cause, and I want to make it: I want to quit caffeine.¬†



Probably, I‚Äôll be updating you on my progress in the coming weeks (we still have eleven weeks of this year) and will let you know how I am doing. I want to be accountable in someone‚Äôs eyes, and you, my dear community, will be part of this journey.¬†



One new thing that I will be doing this time is to use Google Gemini as a personal assistant. I will use Gemini to remind me why I am doing it. I will use it to make me accountable. I will use it whenever I need someone/something to encourage me, to make me move forward.¬†



AGAIN, from what I can tell, I am addicted to caffeine only on a psychological level. I firmly believe that in three weeks I can be off the substance once and for all. (I guess the big problem is to keep it out of your life for good.)¬†



As a way to motivate myself and you, ladies & gentlemen, here is a list of why I want to quit - again - caffeine. This time, the list comes from experience. You can add pros if you have any interesting ones.



I want to quit caffeine for:¬†



* better sleep¬†
* better mental healthy
* better oral health better energy levels
* better stomach health
* better stool
* better digestion
* better mental sharpness
* better focus¬†



These are the reasons why, now, I want to kick the vice out of my life. If you, too, want to kick coffee and caffeine out of your life, then join me. Follow my posts. Follow me on Reddit. Heck, even chat with me. This community, I assume, exists to help people who want to better themselves by quitting one of the most tolerated drugs on this planet ‚Äì caffeine.¬†



Best,

Dan!¬†

I‚Äôm using quotations because I know obviously my life won‚Äôt go back exactly how it was before now that I have a dog.

My puppy is just about 7 months old, and he‚Äôs progressed a lot since I got him at just 9 weeks, but I‚Äôm curious when the guilt will go away. I keep him on a relatively consistent schedule since I‚Äôm a college student and I‚Äôm gone 4 days a week for about 4-5 hours in class and he‚Äôs crated while I‚Äôm gone, and I keep him crated around similar time blocks on the weekends to keep it consistent. But I feel like I‚Äôm the annoying friend who needs to do social activities during specific time blocks so my puppy can stay on schedule, or I‚Äôm constantly checking the time to make sure I arrive home on time to let him out. I know eventually he won‚Äôt need to be crated when I leave, I‚Äôve actually let him roam for 15-20 ish minutes a few times while I got coffee and he did great. But anything longer he‚Äôs crated.

I just wanna hear other people‚Äôs experiences and when they got to a point where some of that guilt went away. 

(I‚Äôm aware before covid times people left their dogs home alone all the time, and still do. I also have friends with adult dogs that have completely normal social lives without worrying about their dog at home, but I just feel bad every time I leave even though on his nanny cam I see that he‚Äôs just sleeping the whole time)",5,1728584188.0,puppy101,11,1.0,False
