1kxu4rd,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingOverSixty/comments/1kxu4rd/dating_insecurity_after_spouse_dies/,Dating Insecurity after spouse dies,"I am M71 and was married to a wonderful woman for 36 years. She died. 

After a year or so I started dating. Had 3 “relationships “ that in hindsight had no emotion connected to them. Sorta fun, but no chemistry. 

Then I met my current partner. Totally and completely different in every aspect. Chemistry and much, much more. Real feelings. 

She was in a previous relationship with a guy who made ceramic items and she helped him.  She left the relationship after living with him for 6 years. By her own admission very much in love with him but incompatible due to political reasons (amazing) and some other factors. 

We meet and start dating. Intimacy is fantasy. Better than fantastic. One morning I get up before she does and I get some coffee and sit at a chair in the living room not wanting to wake her. By the chair is a vase and I think- maybe she made this. I turned the vase over and it’s from her previous relationship with a nice short love note on the bottom of the vase. I noticed a few other vases on some shelves and they were all from him so her. Short love notes on the bottom of the vases. I know she still texts him on his birthday and he does the same to her. She still has pictures of him on Facebook. 

It all added up to bother me. Has she let go of this relationship? We discussed and she said she has no feelings for him anymore. Simply likes the vases since they are cute. Just texts on bday to say hi to someone she once loved. No comment on pictures on Facebook. 

Difficult for me to get over. I don’t want to date someone who still has feelings for someone else - but she says she doesn’t. She has taken the vases down even though I said please don’t. Makes me feel insecure.

I would welcome any feedback on my query letter. I have 1 full request out, and I'm targeting my top agents in this next round of querying. I appreciate your help!

Dear \[Agent\],

I am seeking representation for LOONY OVER YOU*,* a sweet and spicy contemporary romance. The manuscript, complete at 83,000 words, combines the small-town charm and humor of *Gilmore Girls* with the lakeside New England setting of Emily Henry's *Happy Place.* Based on \[personalization\], I think we’d be a perfect match.

Ava is processing her dad's death the same way she’s packing up his cabin-not well. When she left Cedar Falls, Maine, ten years ago following a breakup, she swore she'd never return. Now, she's back in her childhood summer home with bad Wi-Fi, a yodeling doorbell, and a desperate desire to avoid her ex-boyfriend, who runs the only coffee shop in town. Her plan is simple: pack up, sell the cabin, and get back to her awaiting promotion at the luxury hotel where she works in New York ASAP. 

*Leave and don’t bother coming back*. 

Those six words, and Owen’s biggest regret, still haunt him a decade later. A sentiment at odds with his dimpled smile, glorious man bun, and reputation as the town's golden boy. As a devoted single dad, community fixture, and owner of the Early Bird Café, Owen is under enough pressure. The last thing he expects is for the first girl he ever loved to reappear in his life the same day he buys the building they dreamed of renovating into a bed-and-breakfast together.

However, Owen's priority is his son, who already has a flighty mom in and out of his life. While he struggles to decide if he can put his desires first and risk bringing someone into their busy lives who might leave, Ava's grief forces her to confront past regrets and question the future she truly wants.

I hold a BA in English from the University of Florida and an MA in Professional Communication from Clemson University. I'm interested in building a career writing romance novels with humor, spice, and sometimes witches. This is my debut novel and a standalone with series potential.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

First 300 words:

Anyone who said they loved to pack was a dirty liar.

Ava taped shut the box she’d crammed with her father’s academic books. She pushed it aside and shifted to sit cross-legged on the floor. Her shoulders slumped in resignation as she assessed the mess scattered around the living room. She’d been sorting and packing for a week, and her dad’s stuff only seemed to multiply. But that was fine with her.

Staying busy kept her mind occupied.

Being occupied kept her thoughts at bay.

And by keeping her thoughts at bay, she could ignore them altogether.

She pulled another stack of books toward her. The *Birds of Maine Field Guide* toppled over to reveal a long-forgotten photo strip tucked inside. The sequences of pictures captured a much younger Ava in the arms of a teenage boy, his shaggy brown hair curling at the ends.

*Owen Fowler*.

She quickly tossed the pictures back inside the book and slammed it shut. She threw it aside like it burned, not wanting to acknowledge the flood of emotions that came with the brief glimpse of her past.

The heavy weight that had rested on her shoulders since her dad died pressed tighter, threatening to suffocate her. Memories of Owen, just like the reality that her dad was gone, were thoughts she intended to pack and away in the back of her mind.

Compartmentalization was her friend.

The buzz of her phone vibrating had her scrambling on hands and knees to locate the device. It could be her boss finally calling with the news she’d been waiting for.

She spotted the glowing screen and answered the incoming video call before the voicemail kicked on. It was *not* her boss, but her best friend back in the city.

and people say “god works in mysterious ways” or “his timing is perfect” or “you have to have faith” but to me that feels like a giant deflection. how is it that god will give your aunt peace about her divorce or “put it on someone’s heart” to buy you coffee but won’t step in when literal children are being raped by priests?? were they not pure enough? did they not pray hard enough? and it’s not just the church thing, it’s so many religions. so many of them have these massive scandals and abuses of power and then tell you that you need to be more humble. i just don’t get it. and i always hear people say “well there’s free will” okay. but if god intervenes in some people’s lives giving them signs or “blessing them” , then how is it still free will? isn’t that literally just choosing who gets help and who doesn’t? if he gave someone u love the strength to beat cancer, but left a baby in a third world country to starve, how is that divine love or justice or goodness? i don’t understand.

and as for having an afterlife like we say humans go to heaven or hell or whatever, but what about animals or plants? they’re also alive. why is it only people that supposedly have souls? and why is “having a soul” even tied to morality if we’re born in totally different situations, cultures, mental states, etc….? why do some people get raised in love and others get sold into trafficking and then we’re all judged the same? it just feels made up to me. i’m not saying there isn’t something out there. maybe. but spirituality has never clicked for me. and when i try to force it, i just feel more alone.

so yeah if you believe, how did you get there? was it something you saw, felt, lived through? bc if god is real, i just don’t understand why he would make this world so brutal and then demand worship on top of it.

I tend to buy a lot of little things—coffee, snacks, quick grocery runs, and I was curious if it would actually make a difference.

So far I’ve used it at 7-Eleven, a local deli, and for a couple of small App Store charges. Even a $1.89 drink rounded up to 10 points, which honestly adds up faster than I expected. I haven’t used it for big purchases since my other card gives better cashback on those, but for the small stuff, this one’s been pretty solid.

The 10% points back on redemptions up to 100k points per year was another thing that pushed me to try it. I don’t travel much so I’m mostly looking at gift cards or statement credit, and it’s nice to feel like those points stretch a bit more

Emergency Broadcast – Kyle Domelicker
Deep Space Explorer | Truth Seeker | Scared As Hell
Location: UNKNOWN SYSTEM // Through the Nebula // Past the Line

⸻

KYLE DOMELICKER:
Hoping this gets picked up by anyone in the Settled Systems.
UC, Freestar, some half-awake Varuun archivist with antenna issues — I don’t care.

If you’re hearing this…
I made it through the Nebula. Barely.

Here’s the breakdown:

Crossed the threshold. Every system on Star Truth went haywire. Lights, gravity, nav — all gone. Like someone pulled the plug… and laughed.

Reboot took forever. And when I say dead in the black, I mean:
Me. Floating in silence. Sipping stale coffee. Whispering to the control panel. (My only real friend.)

Power finally snaps back on. Gravity slams me to the deck. External lights flicker up… and what do I see?

A ship graveyard.
Not just wreckage. Carnage.
	•	UC dreadnoughts sliced like CHUNKS meat.
	•	Crimson Fleet carriers crumpled like dirty napkins.
	•	Freestar patrol ships — carved like a mad scientist playing with his subjects.
	•	And a few ships I don’t even recognize — black hulls, no markings, one shaped like a knife being swallowed.

All drifting. Burned. Torn. Split.

Whatever did this didn’t fight a war. It made a statement.

I’ve got shields locked at 100%, and every single watt pushed to EM turrets and deep-space scanners.
Even rerouted power from the food processor — no more hot noodles, just survival.

Scanners are pinging a chain of planets ahead. That’s where I’m heading.
Slow. Quiet.
Like tiptoeing past a sleeping god.

Now here’s the kicker:

I keep getting something on the edge of long-range sensors. A faint blip. A shadow. Just out of range. Doesn’t follow. Doesn’t respond. Just… waits.
Hangs there.
But I never get closer. And I’m starting to think it’s not a glitch — it’s bait.

Once — just once — I saw it.
Not on scanners. With my own eyes. Through the port glass.

Looked like a ship, but wrong.
Too smooth. Too organic.
Like it wasn’t built… like it was born.

I’ve been trying to get a picture, but every scan comes back scrambled.
Blurry static. Glitched pixels. Like the system doesn’t want to process it — or can’t.

Still, I’m attaching what I’ve got.
Do with it what you will.

And yes — I’ve activated the universal broadcast:

“I WANT TO INTERVIEW YOU.”

I’m repeating it every 30 seconds.
Hopefully that still translates to “friendly news reporter that may be a little crazy.”

Or… maybe it’s a declaration of war in their language and I just don’t care anymore.
I need the truth.
Even if it kills me.

If this cuts out — archive this. Spread it.
Send it to anyone who still believes there’s something out there.

Because there is.
And it’s hungry.

Domelicker out — for now.
Stay strong. Stay skeptical.
And as always…
Stay Domelicked.

Subtly, almost imperceptibly... but constantly.

It was Arthur, my best friend and a history student at college, who translated the phrase engraved on the back of the contract. We thought it was Russian at first, but he called me in the middle of the night — his voice hesitant, tense, like he was afraid to say it out loud.

“Man... I managed to translate it. The phrase... it’s Greek, not Russian.”

He paused. A long pause. He seemed to weigh every word, as if they held some kind of power.

“Δέχομαι να γίνω η θυσία σου...” he said slowly — the pronunciation, he guessed, was something like: “DÉ-ho-me na YÍ-no i thi-SÍ-a su.”

He swallowed hard.

“It means... ‘I accept to become your sacrifice.’”

I was silent. It sounded more like a sealed promise than just a phrase in a contract.

“There’s something else,” he continued. “Below the phrase, there’s a symbol. It’s Greek, yes, but not common. I’ve never seen it before.”

Another silence. Arthur rarely lost words.

“Maybe it’s something older. Pre-classical, perhaps. A cult symbol... or something worse. I...,” he hesitated, “David, just be careful what you say out loud. Some things we accept without meaning to. And don’t even realize.”

Even without fully understanding what it meant, a chill ran down my spine.

I had already signed. And she... she had already changed.

Since then, I started paying more attention to her.

By day, she seems... gentler. She looks at me like she sees something sacred in me. Her touch is light, almost reverent. She smiles often, but it’s a different kind of smile. There’s a sweetness that wasn’t there before — but it’s not really hers. It’s like she’s playing a role.

She talks about flowers. About seeds. Talks about spring like it’s a personal season. And every time she touches something alive, she seems... more alive too.

But at night, everything changes.

There’s no tenderness. Only a restless intensity. She wakes silently, walks through the house as if guided by something. She talks to herself — or to someone only she can see.

Yesterday, I saw her standing in front of the mirror, wearing a strange outfit — a dress with layers of light fabric, like those on ancient Greek statues. She didn’t move. Didn’t blink. She just whispered:

“It’s almost ready.”

She went back to her parents’ house this morning. My father-in-law looked at me strangely, as if searching for something in me. As she got into the car, he placed a firm hand on my shoulder and said without taking his eyes off my face:

“This is very important to us. Especially to my sweet... Per—”

He stopped. Took a deep breath. Forced a smile.

“...Dianna. We’ve confirmed the wedding date. It’s in three days. Be at my house the day before to get your suit ready. Sleep well. You’ll be photographed for the press.”

Even with her gone, I still feel watched. Like a shadow follows me. Like the very air knows something’s coming. And the fear of being alone... it started to take over me.

Earlier, I decided to go out. To a café in town. Before that, I took a shower. When I looked in the mirror, I noticed my skin was paler. And behind me — a shadow. Clear. Present.

But I didn’t scream.

The shadow spoke.

The voice... was more than deep. It was heavy, ancient, as if it came from the walls, the floor, my own chest. It echoed through the bathroom, filling every corner. Impossible to ignore.

“Your body will be mine, young man. There’s no reason to fear. Any attempt to resist is useless. I hope you get used to me.”

I stood there, frozen. The mirror seemed foggy, but there was no steam.

Later, I went to the café. I tried to act like nothing was wrong. While waiting for my coffee, I saw an elderly couple crossing the street. And then... dates came to me. Fragments. A sequence without context — days, months, years. They came like a dry whisper, deep in my mind. Along with a feeling hard to describe. Like the time around them... was wearing away.

so i’ve been seeing my partner since last june. we started off monogamous and the relationship has been pretty great for the most part with definitely some big struggles along the way. i did something terribly stupid in december, i had gotten a sushi gift card (from a family member) a couple months prior as a bday gift. my partner and i talked about using it together at some point. i was having dinner with a friend (whom I’ve had sex with in the past, but we’ve remained just friends since & never formally dated) My partner knew we got dinner together beforehand but I didn’t mention I used the gift card. I did feel a bit weird about it even though the dinner was platonic. Fast forward to a couple weeks ago and we went out for sushi to celebrate and the remaining balance on my card didn’t cover it. my partner was understandably really surprised and at first was ok with it, but after more processing felt hurt and betrayed. 

they said they wanted a bit of space to process and i used the time to really reflect on what was going on with me and the impact that kind of dishonesty/avoidance can have. we had already planned to start couple counseling and our first intake session was a few days afterwards. during the session i did kind of feel like the “problem partner” but also felt that was kind of valid. they talked about how honesty is a big boundary for them but they still wanted to engage in counseling in good faith. 

the next weekend we had dinner together and i asked what they were doing for memorial day (i had to work for part of the day & they had it off). they said they were getting “coffee with a friend” and felt weird about it because it seemed like maybe the other person was “giving date vibes.” I asked why they didn’t just ask outright and they said they didn’t want to be presumptuous. i also asked how they knew this person and they kind of brushed off the question saying if it was relevant they’d tell me or something. i felt a bit weird about it and just asked if they’d let me know how it went. 

they called that evening and said it did end up feeling like a date and they felt a lot of complicated feelings about “being looked at sweetly by someone” or something along those lines. i felt really distressed and hurt, but wasn’t sure what else to say. 

the next day we planned to see each other and they disclosed that they had downloaded the “feeld” app awhile back when we were in a rough spot but didn’t match or message anyone and it just affirmed for them they wanted to be with me. then they said they hadn’t actually deleted it but their account hadn’t been active until they turned it back on the day after the gift card event. they messaged with someone who had similar interests but both agreed it was “just as friends.” My partner said they both ended up engaging in “date dynamics” but nothing physical happened. they said they still feel confused and won’t talk to this person while we’re trying to work through stuff but at the time it felt like “a way out” 

i felt awful cried a lot and have been feeling pretty terrible since. i feel confused as to whether this is “cheating.” and i still feel horrible for what i did but it hurts so much they did this when we were consciously starting counseling and discussing what it means to be a partner. they’ve also been kind of self righteous when i make mistakes and in my mind it seemed kind of justified because i thought they really were very honest and non-retaliatory. 

i’m at a loss and also feel like i can’t see with clarity how both betrayals seem from a third perspective. i feel like i don’t know what to trust because of the timeline and level of disclosure throughout this. ",0,1748469464.0,latebloomerlesbians,0,0.5,False

Notably, I have quite a few dream characters that appear in my dreams constantly. One of them is a lady with brown hair and glasses. She's super nice and kind of timid, but so smart. She always shows up in my mall world dreams with her pop up shop full of perfumes, candles and lotions that she makes herself. She has an apple pie scent and a coffee cake one that is so amazing and I wish so badly was real😭 As well as a pumpkin one that I haven't tried but I've seen multiple times on her table. Not gonna lie, I wish she was real sometimes since she's so sweet and her scents are amazing.

For more recent dreams though, I had one last night where I was in a Ross-like store. I was browsing the aisles until I found a small box with a painting of a cake on it and the text on it looked Italian. Inside, it was a beautiful baby blue bottle and when I smelled it, omggg.... it smelled like a hyper realistic Tiramisu, with frosting and all, but it was subtle and wearable. It wasn't too sweet or too strong, it was just perfect. Then I woke up and realized it wasnt real!!!😭 I was kind of heartbroken. But I'm sure there's definitely some good Tiramisu scents out there, there's gotta be !!!!😋

Anyway, I'm curious what dreams you have (if any) with perfumes? It can be anything!!! I know there has to be someone out there with dreams like mine where your brain makes up the best scent only for it to not exist😓",2,1748469462.0,FemFragLab,0,1.0,False

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(30+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I’d be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I’m not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won’t jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/zghhOJ8)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages. 

Ice breaker question! What is the best movie or tv show that you’ve watched recently?

Game! 

☕️Beans & Berries

I’m so sad na nagsara na sila, sobrang okay ng kape at pastries dito guys. Okay din tumambay kasi may wifi and hindi restricting ang owner and barista nila. 8/10 sa drinks. 

Pros: Wifi ready and nasa gitna ng bayan

Cons: Walang parking & restroom

☕️Hanan 

I think we all know naman na that Hanan is always on top of their game when it comes to their drinks. The owner once told me na they drew inspiration from the OG Coffee Shops in Elyu like El Union and the likes. 10/10 sa drinks. 

Pros: Artisan & personally crafted drinks at its finest

Cons: Maagang nagsasara

☕️Matthew’s 

Hit or miss yung drinks nila dito, depende kung sino yung naka duty na barista. Most of the time, okay naman yung drinks nila. The place used to be great nung hindi pa pinapasok sa area ng Matthew’s yung samgy ng Chef Ram lol. 7/10 sa drinks. 

Pros: Wifi ready, chill vibes inside the shop

Cons: Dadaan ka muna sa samgyupsalan lol

☕️ Kafei at Kwento

One of the newest player in the coffee shop arena in Balanga. Sobrang okay din yung drinks dito, occasionally may pastries but not always, depende ata sa mood nung owner, top tier yung pastries though. 8/10 sa drinks. 

Pros: Pinaka late nagsasara, open until 12mn

Cons: Medyo inconsistent yung flavors ng drinks since bago pa lang sila but continuously improving

☕️Nightbird

Used to be a favorite, sobrang okay sila nung nagsisimula. Unique concept for the drinks and all kaso parang di nila ma maintain yung consistency ng hype and drinks nila. 7/10 sa drinks. 

Pros: Wifi ready, maganda yung location

Cons: Sobrang sikip ng shop

☕️blanc cafe

I loooove love the pastries and dessert nila. That’s it. Unfortunately, yung drinks and coffee options nila are mid for me. Been there a couple times and medyo hindi masyadong welcoming yung vibe ng owners tbh huhu sorry. 7/10 sa drinks. 

Pros: Pastries and sweets are top tiers. 

Cons: Sobrang liit din ng shop


☕️CHN Cafe

I’m so so sorry pero hindi ko talaga ma appreciate yung coffee shop na to, kahit nung nasa orani pa sila. I tried naman a couple times pero hindi ko talaga ma appreciate. I think mid yung drinks, nothing special about it. Cute vibes though. 5/10 sa drinks. 

Pros: Okay yung milk based drinks nila

Cons: Nothing special, it’s a shop that sells coffee, hence coffee shop lol

☕️Bean Addicted

I love the upgrade they made sa mismong store/shop nila. Drinks are also great! I personally think they have what it takes to go big. Kulang lang sila sa marketing and promotions. Drinks are 9/10

Pros: Place is quiet at night, chill vibes

Cons: No parking, no wifi

☕️Coffee & Friends

I’m not sure kung franchise ito or family owned kasi meron din sa Orani. They’re okay. I love their pastries selection, may croffles sila which I love. Drinks are okay, nothing special but it’s not bad either. 8/10 sa drinks. 

Pros: So many pastries!

Cons: No parking, and maaga nagsasara

☕️S Coffee Break

Overpriced coffee lol. Okay naman sana yung drinks, okay yung lasa and masarap yung matcha nila. But man, it’s way too overpriced for its size and quality. To think na para lang silang pop up store, no seats, and all. Ang mahal, it’s just sad. 7/10 sa drinks. 

Pros: Accessible location

Cons: Mahal, maaga nagsasara

☕️Roastia

Drinks are okay, I guess? Medyo too focused on aesthetics, medyo nakulangan ako sa food and drink quality. It’s not bad, it’s just okay. Not my go to place but not bad. 7/10 sa drinks. 

Pros: Cutesy, aesthetic

Cons: Ayaw gumana ng wifi tapos mahina signal sa area

☕️Cafe Raya

Di ko alam kung bukas pa sila kasi it’s been a while since I’ve been there. Masarap yung coffee nila, medyo nakokontian lang ako sa selection kaya I don’t really opt to go there. 8/10 sa drinks. 

Pros: Quiet and chill vibes, wifi ready

Cons: Mahirap hanapin if you’re new lol


Eto pa lang yung mga alam at napuntahan ko so far. I excluded yung mga coffee shops na may kainan na kasama like 21Hundred, Shaira’s, Natalia, Plaza Brew, The Yard, and the likes. 

Also disclaimer, hindi po ako coffee expert or coffee connoisseur in any way. I’m just a guy who’s obsessed with his caramel macchiato. Sana po wag nyo po ako awayin if iba po ang experience nyo or ratings nyo sa mga coffee shops na to. 

Let me know if you want an “outside Balanga” version. Maraming coffee shops to explore sa ibang lugar like Orani, Samal, Dinalupihan, and more. 

Anyway, ingat and kape well mga coffee lovers! 🫶🏽☕️

* Full time electronics product tester (it's a rad job) 🧑‍💻
* PC / Steam Deck / Switch gamer🎮
* Travelled to a few countries (USA, Japan, Czech Republic) ✈️
* Has 2 tattoos 😎
* Met 3 people from Reddit IRL 😁
* Laid back and easy to talk to - uses emojis a lot (can you tell?)

I was told that I need to clean the room to a high standard and recommended to hire a professional cleaner as many tenants with him that don't incur cleaning fees. I told him I would clean it without any professional cleaning.

I had cleaned over two days but there was some issues with a bit of limescale in the bathrooms and I had got rid of most of them. I was expecting that I may incur a cleaning fee for the limescale on the taps and the toilet, however the landlord's rate of £45 an hour I have told I think is too much, as online in the same area I see cleaners for £15-25 an hour. He mentioned that it took 3.5 hours.

After mentioning the price of £45 an hour is too much, He has put the price down to £35 an hour (\~£130) and says if I don't accept it he will dispute the deposit and attempt to claim the original fee of £150 for 3.5 hours of cleaning. Unfortunately I didn't take much pictures of the place when I arrived, but I took photos of the bathroom. I told the landlord that the fee even at £35 is too heavy but was told that I did have the choice to hire a professional cleaner but chose not to. I have mentioned to him that I am willing to pay £85 for any cleaning fees by comparing with the average rate of 3.5 hours of cleaning.

My room is an ensuite at £850 a month and stayed for a year. The room was in a mess when I got it (there was tobacco that I found in the drawers and behind the desk), however I signed an agreement that the room was in a good state as I cleaned up the desks myself and found the tobacco behind the desk later. So I cannot dispute that I had left the room in the state I found it as I had signed an agreement saying the room was clean.

There was other things mentioned that the landlord has photos of. He complained about the shower drain containing some hair, the shower wall had some limescale, the bedroom walls were dirty, and the kitchen wasn't cleared (there is two coffee sachets and a unused sponge left in the kitchen drawer). Because of finding tobacco in the drawers and behind the desks, I wasn't expecting that he would find no fault with these as the room was in a better condition that I found it, but have no photos when I arrived, and signed an agreement that the room was in a good condition.

I am willing to pay a cleaning fee, but I don't believe the cleaning took 3.5 hours and the £45 hour rate seems very excessive. i was wondering if anyone has gone into a similar situation and if I should proceed with TDS, or is the landlord being reasonable?",3,1748469341.0,LegalAdviceUK,3,1.0,False

About Me (aka: Who’s This Guy?)

29 | Based in Europe | Functioning Adult™

I work with people (sometimes the tiny kind, sometimes the chaotic kind) and it’s a job that’s taught me empathy, patience, and how to survive on zero sleep and too much coffee.

I’m an introvert by nature but warm up fast. Once I feel comfortable, I go from quiet thinker to “here’s a playlist I made that accidentally tells you too much about me.”



Here’s what keeps me going:

* Music – My playlists go from soft indie ballads to aggressive boss battle themes and then back to lo-fi in under 3 tracks.
* Movies – I’ll happily dissect a masterpiece or watch the worst rom-com on Netflix just for fun. Bonus points if you can quote bad dialogue with a straight face.
* Gaming – I lean toward story-rich single-player adventures, but if you want to team up for something chaotic and hilarious, I’m in.
* Books & Writing – I love getting lost in good fiction or oddly specific Wikipedia holes. I write when I can, even if it’s mostly half-finished Google Docs for now.
* Creative things – Drawing, brainstorming, daydreaming. I'm in my “figure-it-out” era and loving the process.
* Curiosity – I will absolutely watch a 40-minute video essay on a topic I’ll forget by next week—but I’ll be very passionate about it in the moment.



Who I’m Hoping to Meet:

I don’t have a long list or a rigid “type.” Honestly, I just want to talk to someone kind, curious, and open-minded—someone who wants to connect beyond “wyd.”

Bonus points if:

* You enjoy silly, deep, or totally random conversations (or all three in one sitting).
* You’re a fan of movie nights, music swaps, or virtual hangouts.
* You can handle sarcasm, witty banter, and occasional existential spirals at ungodly hours.
* You’re open to a relationship if the vibe’s right, and maybe even the idea of a family someday (no rush, no pressure—just openness).
* You’re cool with exchanging pics when it feels natural, not weird.
* You’re down to move to another chat platform if Reddit starts feeling like a weird third wheel.



Why Message Me?

* Because you’re tired of talking to bots, dry texters, or people who vanish mid-convo.
* Because you want someone who actually reads your replies.
* Because you want to connect with someone who listens, laughs, and is willing to see where things go.
* Because you're secretly a cat in human form. Or you just like cats. That works too.



At the very least, we might have a fun, thoughtful chat. At best? Well... let’s not spoil the ending just yet.

Shoot your shot—I'm friendly, I reply, and I promise to bring good vibes (and probably a meme or two).",1,1748469139.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

If you’re also tired of pretending and just want to connect as two humans trying to navigate this mess called life, drop me a message.

Let’s skip the small talk and get to the good stuff.

I welcome sincerity and depth but only from those who stand with Palestine. That’s a non-negotiable stance for me.

Just wanted to say a BIG THANKS to this community - I finally passed my PMP exam on May 26, 2025 with Above Target result 🔥🔥🔥

This sub was a HUGE part of my journey, so I wanted to give back by sharing what worked for me, what didn’t, and how much it all cost. Hopefully this helps someone who’s just starting or in the middle of their prep.

# 🧠 My Background

I work in education project management and wanted to get a stronger grip on Agile, Predictive, and Hybrid approaches to align better with international standards. PMP felt like the natural next step besides being a rare and valuable certification in my country.

# ⏳ Timeline

* Started studying: Late September 2024
* Exam date: May 26, 2025
* Definitely could have taken it sooner, but procrastination is real.

# 📚 Resources I Used

* **Live PMP Prep Course by Vugar Rustamli (PMWILL PMI ATP)** Small-group Zoom sessions, lots of mock questions (1000+), personalized 1:1 feedback, super helpful. ✅ Helped me develop the “PMP mindset”. Cost: $670
* **Andrew Ramdayal’s Udemy Course** Self-paced, great for reinforcing topics and getting general understanding. Watched at 1.5x–2x speed. Cost: $16
* **PMI Study Hall™ (Paid twice – don’t ask 😅)** Full-length mock exams, domain quizzes, great for stamina + mindset. Avg score: 70–75%. Cost: $44 + $55
* **Third3rockpmp Study Notes** Reviewed these the night before. The mindset and formulas refresh were super useful. These study notes simply AMAZING!  Cost: $17
* **David McLachlan’s YouTube Channel** Free, expert-level questions walkthroughs. Highly recommend. Cost: Free
* **This subreddit (**r/pmp**)** Absolute GOLD. I lurked here a lot - reading other people’s lessons learned, clearing up concepts, staying sane and motivated by others results.

# ☕ Study Habit That Helped Me Most

Every weekend, I’d head to a **coffee shop or coworking space** to study for at least 4-5 hours. I probably did this 30–40 times (\~$280 total). This kept me focused and made studying feel more intentional.

# 🧠 The PMP Mindset Is Real

I can’t stress this enough: you have to **""wear the PMI hat""** during the exam. Forget how things work in your job - think how PMI *wants* you to handle the situation. This clicked for me after lots of mock exams and mindset discussions.

# ✍️ Application & Exam Logistics

* Submitted my app on April 30 → approved by May 5
* Took the exam in person at Pearson VUE Center
* Used both 10-min breaks — highly recommend
* Flagged any question I spent >1 minute on, came back later
* Finished with 20 mins left and used it to review flagged Qs
* Got provisional pass immediately after finishing

# 💸 What I Spent (Total ~$1,366)

* Vugar Rustamli PMWILL Course: $670
* Udemy Course: $16
* Study Notes: $17
* PMI Study Hall (x2): $99
* Coffee shop sessions: $280
* Exam Fee (PMI member rate): $284

Could've saved some money by self-study, avoiding repeat purchases and fewer ice-americanos, but no regrets 😄

# 🎯 Final Thoughts

* If you're hitting 70%+ consistently on full-length mock exams, you're probably ready
* Don’t underestimate the importance of **PMP mindset**
* Take breaks during the exam — they help
* This community made the journey so much more doable! A huge thank you!

I'm in an EMT program that aims to feed straight into employment at a specific company. Today we learned that a member of the department passed away, not given any real details but my classmates and I have heard enough to get the full picture. They were previously in our program less than 2 years ago.

To add in, we in the program have duties we need to do each day. One of them is bringing coffee/snacks for ourselves since we are there all day.

What I wanted to end up asking was would it be out of line/awkward/overall not cool to bring a nicer breakfast just for our staff for them? It wouldn't be anything more than maybe just a hand off and saying its just for them or a note labeling it. Possibly like pastries and some coffee? Everyone learned about the incident today and I don't want to bring it up unnecessarily or give them unneeded reminders. Not quiet sure if we should just keep our heads down and let them ride this out.

I went with the custom build with the hopes I would avoid the breakage issues I’ve heard so often with the Elite 2’s and to also design my own unique controller. Right after I received the Elite 2, I compared its game play to an unused regular wireless controller that I had, and noticed a slightly improved playing experience nothing fantastic but better in some ways. The Elite 2 is appreciably heavier than the regular controller so that factors into game playing fatigue that I've experienced.  I’ve consistently used this Elite 2 for 17-months just about every day, it was never dropped, and it always sits on the coffee table when not in my hands.  After 13-months and right after the regular warranty expired, I noticed a creaking sound and inspected the controller and found a crack on the underside, nothing big but the controller was already breaking apart. I’m not an aggressive gamer, I might have some strong emotions with harsh language when playing, but I do not break equipment. In fact, I’ve never broken any of my controllers, ever. I have all of them and they all still work. My original go too controller that I had purchased new with my Xbox Series X back in 2020 which functions just fine, now has sticky/tacky joystick controller knobs. I do not play with dirty hands so it’s clean.  The plastic stickiness/tackiness is common from older plastic painted toys and items that start off well but as they age the plastic paint breaks down and become sticky or tacky. Now today I noticed my Elite 2 controller has completely stopped working correctly, it appears the left joystick now has permanent downward stick drift and locks my Xbox main menu into a perpetual downward motion, so it’s truly broken and unusable. I had just used the Elite 2 the night before and it worked just fine. I share this story with you in the hopes that (long shot) Microsoft will design and build more durable longer lasting Elite controllers, and for you as maybe a potential buyer of an Elite 2 controller, can decide if purchasing one is the best choice. From what I’ve read, I suppose I should be happy that I got 17-months of use out of my $250 Elite 2 controller, but I’m disappointed that it’s broken. Now I just need to go back to my original wireless controller with its tacky joysticks or until maybe I go and buy another regular wireless controller, just not elite this time.",0,1748468710.0,xbox,2,0.4,False

It has been about 15 years since I have become inactive in the church. I am a barista at Starbucks, and my family is still active in the church. My parents live in UT while I live in NY.

However, I just want to make super sure.

Hot drinks such as hot chocolate and herbal tea are okay if I remember correctly, whereas other teas are not. And caffeine is okay. My mom drinks so much Diet Coke that it worries me. Decaf beans have been roasted so long that most of the caffeine has been roasted out. As a nonmember I am so confused and just want clarification.

1kxtfnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kxtfnn/the_smileco/,The SmileCo.,"I’m posting this here because I don’t know where else to go with it. I’ve been sitting on this for days now, going back and forth between thinking I’m overreacting or going crazy and wanting to know more. 
I don’t really have anyone left to tell. Not in the way that matters. I keep thinking about calling someone from the old job, but what would I even say? “Hey, remember that quiet guy from soil sampling? I think I found a town that isn’t supposed to exist.”
No one would believe me. Heck, I’m not even sure I believe me.

So I’m putting it here. Not for karma. Not for fun. Just… to get it out. Somewhere. Anywhere. Maybe one of you has seen something like this. Maybe someone out there remembers Okshita, or SmileCo. Or maybe you know that weird feeling, like the world’s missing a page you were supposed to read.
If you do — let me know.

Allow me to provide some context: I used to work in environmental science.  
It wasn’t glamorous, but it paid decent — just soil and groundwater testing for industrial sites, mostly. I'd spend hours alone in lab rooms running the same instruments over and over again, but I liked it. There was something satisfying about gathering data, about understanding the story hidden in the dirt.
However, they let me go four years ago.
I’m not going to get into the details. Let’s just say I got a personal diagnosis that made management uncomfortable. Not contagious, not terminal. Just... something about being a liability… No matter, I was close to retiring from that company anyways.

I wasn’t quite sure how to fill my empty time, so I began hiking. On a few of my hikes I had come across some old abandoned houses/buildings. This began my fascination with urban exploration. Over these past few years I’ve explored dozens of different abandoned buildings, towns, mines, etc.

Earlier this year I found myself moving into a town not far from a small town in northeastern Oklahoma called Picher — yeah, that Picher. The ghost town that basically collapsed into itself after lead poisoning and sinkholes made it unlivable. It’s a decaying husk now, but for me it’s become a kind of base camp for deeper explorations. I’ve been mapping and recording the weird and quiet places left behind by history, and this was one of my most dangerous mappings as the air and grounds are still somewhat unsafe to traverse through.

But a few weeks ago, I stumbled on something that wasn’t supposed to be there.
I was camping on a logging road not far from the Kansas border, maybe ten miles northwest of Picher. My plan was to hit an old rail station I’d been tipped off about, but sometime around midnight I spotted a rusted metal sign poking out of the brush. No name, just a faded arrow and a number: 13.
Curious, I followed the trail. About an hour later, I found myself at the edge of a town swallowed by trees — buildings choked in vines, power lines dangling like nooses. Roofs partially caved in and a broken welcome sign on the edge of town with no name. 

The first thing I noticed was the silence. Not the kind of quiet you get in rural areas or empty fields, but the heavy, unnatural kind—like the town itself was holding its breath.
The buildings looked like they had been abandoned in a hurry. Doors hung open on rusted hinges, windows were either shattered or covered in layers of grime so thick they looked painted. I passed what had once been a diner—still had the cracked “OPEN” sign fallen in the doorway. Inside, I found plates of mold, a child's shoe was lying under a booth, and broken coffee cups sat on the floor beneath the counter. 

As I explored a couple other buildings I felt watched. I don’t know how to explain it exactly, but the air changed the second I stepped past the townhouse. There was no sound, not even birds. Just that thick, pressing quiet that makes your ears ring. And then — that feeling. Like I wasn’t alone. Like something was standing just behind me, close enough to breathe but refusing to make a sound.
I turned around more times than I care to admit.
Nothing. Always nothing.
But it didn’t go away.
That kind of silence doesn’t feel empty. It feels like something’s holding its breath, just to see what you’ll do next.

Thats when I came across the most interesting part. Hidden in the deepest part of the town, behind what I assumed to be an old library, was an RV.
It was buried halfway in the dirt, like the woods had been trying to eat it for the past decade. Brown and white, late ’80s model. One of the windows was cracked. The door was ajar, hanging open like someone left in a hurry.
I thought maybe it belonged to a squatter or a hunter who never came back. I hesitated, then went to step inside.
Even though the door was ajar, I still had to pull pretty hard to open it fully, it seemed the hinges were stuck on some vines that had grown into the RV. 

Inside the air was stale, thick, like someone had tried to clean something chemical out of it years ago. The floor creaked under my boots. Most of the front had been gutted — cushions torn, wires dangling, a lantern rusted to one side. But in the back, where the bed would’ve been, someone had built a workspace.
A makeshift lab.
Glass jars lined the wall, most empty. A microscope sat crooked on a bolted-down desk. There were scribbled notes taped over the cabinets, diagrams I couldn’t make sense of. And in the corner — a cardboard box. Plain, water-damaged, taped shut. I whipped out my pocket knife and cut the box open, inside was a collection of 4 things. 

* Two hardbound notebooks, cracked and water-stained.
* Five cassette tapes, each labeled with dates and what looked like experiment numbers.
* A few strange rocks — one black and glossy like obsidian, another pale green and flaky, almost like it had veins. Some of the green had been broken up and placed in vials 
* And an old, but intact cassette recorder.

I was curious. I took one of the journals and something wrapped in cloth on the desk back with me to my campsite, and then a couple days later I brought it back home with me. I cracked open one of the notebooks. It was difficult to read at first, but it looked like an experiment log. The first journal was labeled:
""Dr.  — Log #001"" (the name was smudged) 
Here’s a portion of what it said. I’m typing it exactly as written:

Journal EntryDate: March 18, 1997Location: Okshita, OK
I wasn’t planning on writing tonight, but something about the way the samples behaved in the dish has kept my hands restless. Might as well make a record of it while it's fresh.
Earlier this afternoon, one of the foremen — Raul — stopped by the trailer with a small padded case. Said the crew had pulled something new out of Shaft 3, about 200 feet down past the main iron seam. Not uncommon to find odd minerals here and there, but he said this batch ""felt weird.""
Not dangerous. Just... strange.

Inside the case were two specimens. One a deep black, almost blue under the right light. Smooth and heavy, like polished obsidian but somehow matte. The other, a pale green crystal that shimmered slightly along the edges, delicate like mica or glass slivers.
Both were cold.
Not cool — cold. Not in a dry ice, chemical reaction kind of way either. Just... unnaturally chilled. Even after sitting on my desk for hours, they haven't warmed up.

I ran basic tests — no radiation, no unusual off-gassing, no acid reactivity. They appear inert, at least chemically. The green one flakes easily and breaks down under semi-light pressure. The black one is much denser, heavier than its volume suggests. There’s something about it that reminds me of magnetic basalt — but my meters are only picking up a weak magnetic field.

Raul said the guys are calling them “Glassrock” and “Nightstone.” Not scientific names, obviously, but I won’t lie — they fit. I’ll log them as Type A (black) and Type B (green) until we know more.
No urgency yet. No hazards. If anything, they seem almost… clean. Unnaturally so.
I’ll prep a small test batch tonight, dissolve traces into distilled water and run conductivity and bio tests in the morning. 

Not expecting much — probably just another shiny distraction that’ll go nowhere.
But I’ll admit — I haven’t stopped touching the Type B sample. Just running it between my fingers absentmindedly while I write.
It’s strangely calming. Like holding a smooth river stone that’s never been in a river.
Might be nothing. Probably is.
Still — I want to see what it does when mixed.
— Dr. A. M.

I haven’t read any of the other entries yet. I will, I have to. I decided to unwrap the thing in cloth I had taken too. When I opened it up it was a soda bottle, like one of those old Coke ones you’d see the polar bears drinking in those commercials. It was untouched by dust and across the middle was a washed-out light blue label with a cartoonish bottle cap mascot smiling. The label read in yellow letters: SmileCo™ - Original Blend.

As I was turning the bottle in my hands, I swear — just for a second — I felt warmth.
It was subtle, but unmistakable. The glass had been cold as ice, but then… it wasn’t. It was body temperature. Almost like someone else had just been holding it.
I froze, then held it up to the light. No residue, no finger prints. But as I tilted it, something inside moved. I hadn’t noticed it earlier — it was thick, dark. Not syrupy like soda. More like ink.
I gave it a gentle shake, and the liquid barely sloshed, almost congealed. That’s when I saw it, bubbles.
Tiny ones, rising slowly to the top, where they popped inward. Not outward — like pressure escaping — but like the liquid was pulling in on itself.
I set it down.
And this part... maybe I was just jumpy. Maybe I imagined it. But the second I walked away, I swear I heard a faint hiss from the bottle — like carbonation escaping, or… something breathing.
When I turned around, it had stopped. But I swear, I swear that little cartoon bottle cap was smiling wider. 

Later that night I looked up the town mentioned in the journal — “Okshita, Oklahoma.” Nothing. Not a map pin. Not a population stat. Not even an old census record.
Then I searched the name on the bottle — SmileCo™. Still nothing. No trademark filings, no defunct business listings, no half-finished web pages archived from the early internet.
Just… blank space.
That’s what gets under my skin the most. These days, everything leaves a footprint — even ghost towns, even companies that went belly-up decades ago. But this?
It’s like someone scraped it clean. Like it was never meant to be remembered.

I thought I could walk away from this.
Weird minerals, an erased town, a bottle full of congealed soda. It was all strange, sure — unnerving — but I figured I’d catalog it, maybe dig a little deeper, and move on like I always do. Just another curiosity for the shelf.
But then last week, something changed.
I was driving through the outskirts of town — the newer part, where they’ve been trying to redevelop the old industrial lots — and I saw construction crews working late. No signs, no logo, just chain-link fencing and temporary floodlights.

The next morning, there was a sign.
Not big. Not flashy. Just a white board with black stenciled letters.
“SmileCo Processing Center.”
 Just the name was enough to send shivers down my spine.
It wasn’t the kind of name I could forget. And when I went back that night, the sign was gone.
I asked around my town — no one had heard of SmileCo. But the lot’s still fenced off. Still guarded. Still growing.
So I’m writing this now because I think something’s happening again. Not just in that dead town in the woods — but here In my town.
I’m starting to think SmileCo was ever really gone.I think it was waiting.

I’m packing my camping bag with essentials, (flashlight, batteries, food, water, etc.) I’m going back to that town tomorrow. I’ll keep you posted.

1kxtfn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kxtfn8/aitah_for_resenting_my_sister/,AITAH for resenting my sister,"TL;DR: My sister had a panik attack hours after drinking a cup of instant coffee, blamed me for being emotionally cold and inconsiderate and then called an ambulance to go to the ER. Now I resent her for it.

Here's some background information:

I would describe my sister as kind, conscientious, delicate, virtuous and genuinely well-intentioned. She's also quite stubborn and very convinced of herself and the way she sees the world. She's also easily frightened, gets worried over small things and can be overly careful at times. We've both been fortunate enough have had a fairly sheltered upbringing. Professionally she and I have medical backgrounds. She's had a rough couple of years with a lot of stress due to her work, but also intense disagreements with virtually all other family members, which has led to her isolating herself. She's had a number of panik attacks in the past, caused by seemingly simple/benign things. I was there to comfort her multiple times when they occurred. When I tried to talk to her about these episodes afterwards, she would always be absolutely conviced that the underlying cause wasn't psychological or due to all the stress she's been going through recently (e.g. she blames her symptoms on food or medication or other things). She's also not had any professional help with these issues. Until recently she and I have had a very good relationship.

Here's what happened:

She lives with her husband, but every now and then when they get into a big fight she comes to stay with me, which is always fine by me and she's then able to calm down. Well, recently they had another massive row and she ended up staying with me again. Everything was fine, until one evening at my house she suddenly started having another panik attack. She said that she'd had a cup of instant coffee (2x table spoons of coffee powder - this was 4 hours before the symptoms began) and that she's experiencing heart palpitations, dryness of mouth and light headedness. She was obviously very worried and was hyperventilating. Due to my medical experience I was quite certain that she was having another panik attack and not experiencing some freak cardiac event 4 hours after having one cup of coffee. I tried to calm her down by explaining that the cause was most likely due to all the stress she's being experiencing. I tried to help her slow her breathing using some breathing techniques, asked her to put her phone away and to try and distract herself by doing something other than googling the possible causes of her symptoms (google unhelpfully often says the cause is something extreme like a heart attack, deadly arrhythmias, pulmonary embolism, ect. ect.). She was totally and utterly convinced that she overdosed on coffee. She was massively freaking out, crying and frantically trying to estimate her heart rate (we found it to be at 110bpms). She then got upset with me, started shouting and swearing, and accused me of not taking her seriously and being emotionally cold. I'll be honest, I definitely was fed up with the situation and could have absolutely tried harder to be more empathetic. Would it have helped calm her down and eventually stop the panik attack? In my opinion - no. She wouldn't listen to my advice and was hostile when I tried to help. She then called an ambulance for herself. I was massively fed up with the whole situation at that point and as my attempts to intervene hadn't worked/just made her more upset, so I just sat in the corner observing her until the ambulance arrived (for context I've been quite stressed myself with work and other obligations and really didn't have the energy for this). The paramedics assessed her, and eventually came to the same conclusion as me: All her vitals are normal, she most likely experienced a panik attack due to all the stress she's been experiencing. She ended up going to the ER, where unsurprisingly the lab results, ECG, ect. were all found to be normal. Even after all the evidence against her claims, she still is utterly convinced that she didn't have a panik attack and that the coffee caused all her symptoms. I resent her for this. Could I have handled the situation better? Absolutely. Should she as a medical professional be able to put 2 and 2 together and see that she's acting like a hypochondriac and needs therapy? Absolutely. I know I'm probably TA, but I also don't think the way she's handling her health by disregarding any advice is fair on me and the rest of the family either...",0,1748468468.0,AITAH,2,0.5,False
1kxtejj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kxtejj/aitah_for_throwing_out_my_girlfriends_string/,AITAH for throwing out my girlfriend's string. Should I apologise?,"My girlfriend ('Jane') has this long line of crochet thing, when I say long I mean at least 7m long. It always sat on a shelf under the coffee table and It seemed to get larger of a pile, she'd sit by it while crocheting so I just assumed it was practice string or something.

 I love Jane, her hobbies and specifically crocheting I've always found adorable. She does it at least every other day for an hour or two, it relaxes her and I thought I would do something nice for her because she always manages to do that for me unprovoked, and she just deserves it. The week before she'd mentioned she wished to just relax with a glass of red wine, a plate of lasagne and scented candles. PERFECT

Anyway, I thought I'd get her a whole load of new things for her crochet stuff. Admittedly though I didn't know much about it, me and Jane shared other hobbies that we both engage in and crochet was something separate. 
I told my friend who is an avid crocheter? too, explained everything, and she told me, in order to go as big and grand of a gesture as I wanted, I should completely scratch everything she had and 'overload' her with finished projects for inspiration and a pile of yarn. This sounded very solid to me honestly, 'inspiration, and 'yarn' all sounded very specialist and technical to me. So I threw out her old tools that had already needed replacing and replaced them with new ones.

 Then I threw out a few of her finished projects, the older and messier ones like my friend told me too, but I did think better than to throw them all out, i mean I'm not stupid, I left quite a few alone. Then I found the line, that darn line. I almost forgot about it, but then I remembered and I threw the whole lot out, not just the scrap bits at the top, the whole 7m. And then, in its place I stuffed the whole shelf with balls of yarn and a huge plump owl.

 Around the house, I placed about 7 random pieces of crochet. I replaced small curtains in the kitchen, left out a nice cardigan on our bed etc. I even had a crochet rose to hold between my teeth when she got home. I dressed up, made lasagne and bought a bunch of scented candles and red wine. Basically went all out.

 When she got home (she's a nurse and she works really hard), she was tired as usual, it was a crochet day so I'd picked it so she could use her new stuff straight away. She looked so bewildered when she saw me dressed up bless her, and laughed at the rose. Then we ate, drank, everything was going swimmingly. She didn't mind too much that I threw out some of her projects though she did sort of wish I asked her, she was ecstatic about the new tools, she loved her cardigan and the curtains and everything else.

 We sat down to watch our show pretty little liars, she got her new tools out to do her usual stuff and then that STUPID owl plopped out of the shelf underneath the coffee table. She laughed at first, I'd forgotten about it and asked how she liked it. Then she got quite, her smile dropped, she stood up and asked me where the row was. I didn't really realise what she was talking about, a bit pissed she pulled the blanket off me as she stood up. She got more upset at my tone and she got on her knees ruffling through the drawers which was just brimming with yarn balls and scrambling around the shelf flooding our living room floor with more yarn balls. It was quite funny so I started laughing, until she turned to me in obvious distress and then It finally dawned on me 

I asked her about 'that pile of practice knitting?', she says yes and I told her I threw it out. She goes stony-faced and literally freaks out, running to the bin to look through it. I told her my friend had all the crochet things I threw out. We drove to that friends house, I am completely confused and she won't speak to me much to explain either. She doesn't like this friend so I do the talking, and she tells me she binned it, when Jane asks her to get it, she tells her it's in the big bin now and she's welcome to look through it. She goes without objecting. 

We rummage through the bin a bit and it's a whole heap of unravelled string covered in bolognese sauce. Jane at this point, is completely mad and crying and calls my friend a 'manipulator b*tch' and runs off to the car. My friend gets upset, I deal with it. Jane cries all the drive home and she's really mad at me as well.
 I sleep on the sofa, it was like 4am by then.

 Next day she tells me that was the first row she had ever crocheted and her mum taught her how to do it (her history with her mum is complicated), she says she's sorry for shouting but I had no right to throw out any of her projects without asking her. I told her I was sorry, but I was trying to do a nice thing and I wasn't going to apologise to her especially after she treated my friend so poorly after she helped me organise all this for her. She wouldn't explain herself, saying it was 'obvious what SHE was trying to do but that's not what I'm talking about right now'.  

 She's at her brother's house, my friends are on my side but they're biased, I don't know if I should apologise. They've got me convinced, I'd be compromising my boundaries especially after she treated my friend like that.

Caught in the Middle of a Family Situation Looking for Perspective,"Hey this is my first post and I just really need to talk. A couple of days ago was Mothers Day, but I spent it with my boyfriend since it was his birthday. My mom said it was fine and we could go to the mall together another day. Fast forward to today that was supposed to be our “make-up” day. But it ended up being a mess. 

Her friend and her baby tagged along. I was already in a bad mood bad hair, day no one at school, pouring rain. I got soaked because I had to strap the baby in the car and when we picked a mall, neither I nor the friend had a preference so my mom chose. 

We got coffee and we went into a shoe store immediately I was left with the baby without being asked. Later in a clothing store I found a cool Star Wars shirt I thought about getting for my boyfriend and me. I wasnt sure about the style but my mom and her friend pressured me to buy it. I hesitated and my mom took it as attitude. 

Then we went to a toy store. While they were shopping I called my boyfriend and he said he liked the shirt so I went back to buy it. I also saw a cute top for myself but my mom kept saying “Thats ugly” and rolling her eyes so I gave up. 

Things were okay until the baby started fussing. I ended up with the baby again while they went to get her bottle. People were giving me looks like I was the mom or even a kidnapper (Im 17 almost 18 in September) Baby wouldnt calm down and my energy was gone. We looked for a store that wasnt there anymore and I suggested heading back but they insisted on going to Primark. 

I tried to lighten the mood by joking “Mommy buy this for me pleaseee,” and when she said no in a joking tone, I replied “Alright then,” also jokingly. But suddenly she got angry. I got confused and called my boyfriend just drained. Back at the shoe store my mom offered to stay with the baby while her friend and I went in. I didnt want to go but I did anyway then the friend said she was done so we left. My mom got mad. The car ride home was silent. 

As we got out she screamed that I ruined the whole day, threw the keys at me and told me to go home. I apologized but she said I meant to ruin it. I cried as I walked home with her friend who was trying to comfort me. I changed clothes, and then my mom came back and started yelling again saying shes tired of my “complaining” and kept on slamming doors. I had a breakdown crying for 30 minutes straight feeling like I ruin everything. 

Then my stepdad texted “What happened today back there?” which made me break down again. (He never treats me like a daughter and always hears my moms side) so I knew shed already painted me as the villain. 

Later her friend told me my mom is “really hurt” and I should talk to her and apologize. 

But I dont know why shes hurt. I dont even know if I should be apologizing. I didnt want to cause drama. I just feel so lost and sad. I dont know what to do? do I talk to her? Take the blame? Please help",1,1748468245.0,AmItheAsshole,8,1.0,False

I mention the part above, because I'm grateful for the leverage that I have since he doesnt contribute he cant use any excuse that he owns any space in particular, since space is the currency of hoarders and their greatest asset, which means he usually keeps things on our lawn or in the garage but recently ive become fed up with it.

so moving on, in the past I've had alot of confrotation with him, arguments, and I have a simulation of how that generally goes down...

**ME:** ""Dad, you have to stop bringing home stuff and I need to get rid of things that are in the garage.""

**DAD:** ""Why does it bother you so much?""

**ME:** ""Because the garage is filled with stuff, and we can't do anything in it.""

**DAD:** ""What do you want to do in the garage anyway?""

**ME:** ""I want to put my gym equipment in here, not that it matters, I just don’t want your junk taking up the garage in the first place.""

**DAD:** ""Well what do you expect me to do?""

**ME:** ""Throw stuff away.""

**DAD:** ""Why? You always want to throw stuff away.""

**ME:** ""No, I only want to throw away the stuff you keep bringing home, you don’t need huge amounts of coffee tins filled with rusty nails, or old spray bottles of cleaner that are barely filled from the 90s. You haven’t built anything or washed a window in my entire life.""

**DAD:** ""I’m gonna use it someday.""

**ME:** ""When?""

**DAD:** ""I don’t know, I’m always busy.""

**ME:** ""Busy doing what?! You’re retired.""

**DAD:** ""Helping take care of things around the house.""

**ME:** ""I’d rather you throw your things away or sort them than mow the lawn.""

from here you get it, if I dont back down then the whole thing blows up and his final retort is always that he raised me, and if I throw his things away he'll never do me any favors, not that I need his stupid favors that he looms over me and guilts me with for decades, thats not a favor, thats a debt, a curse!  
  
So anyway I just needed to vent, but i dont care anymore I've began to throw things away while he's gone, right now my sister is sick, unfortunately she has cancer, and I understand how bad that is for him, but its only going to make him worse, and im tired of coddling him, so im going to move on with doing whats good for us, wether he cares or knows it, we cant risk getting kicked out either, this house is the only house with affordable rent in the area, its a nice house, and we're soon going to need to take care of my sick sister for a few months, and we have a good relationship with the landlord, but hes willing to risk it all just because of his stupid junk... what a jerk.",5,1748467932.0,ChildofHoarder,1,1.0,False

I realized that even though my target *age* and *income* brackets were accurate, their daily routines and hangout spots varied wildly. So instead of broad city-wide targeting, I started micro-segmenting by neighborhood and even specific points of interest (think coffee shops frequented by creatives, specific gyms for fitness enthusiasts, etc.).

The difference was night and day. My click-through rates jumped, and the cost per acquisition plummeted. It turns out drilling down into the specifics of *where* my target demo spends their time was the key.

After **countless failed attempts** over the past 6-7 years, I’m finally 1 week vape-free! My biggest strength? I never stopped *trying* after each relapse. If you’re struggling to quit, maybe my messy journey and current tactics will help.  

**My History:**  
- Read Allen Carr’s *Easy Way* multiple times (great book, got me hyped… but I still failed 3-4 times after finishing it).  
- Took ""one last hurrah"" trip to Turkey, bought **THREE** vapes, and chain-vaped the whole week (seeing others smoke is my kryptonite!).  
- Threw all 3 vapes in the airport bin on the way home – *freedom felt real*.  

**The Relapse That Didn’t Wreck Me:**  
Got picked up by a vaping friend. Took 8-10 puffs. **BUT** – I woke up the next day and *kept going*. This was huge for me!  

**What’s Working THIS Time (The Weird & The Practical):**  
1. **The Daily Note:** Every morning, I read this:  
   > *""I got you free now. You owe me one. NEVER a single puff – it won’t hit right, and the second one will take the freedom away""*  
   (I have more but you get the gist).  

2. **The ""Improvements"" List:** I keep a running note of *every positive change*, updated daily. A week in, it’s **LONG** (better sleep, no flavoured mouth,going out more). Reading it kills cravings.  

3. **Facing Triggers HEAD-ON (Yes, Really!):**  
   - I watch videos of people vaping.  
   - I hang with my vaping friends.  
   *Why?* It reminds me **why I quit** – that enslaved feeling. I look at them and think: *""Nope, not giving up my freedom.""*  

4. **Keeping Routine (Mostly):**  
   - Still drink coffee on the balcony. Cravings hit… but they PASS. I don’t hide from my triggers; I just don’t vape through them.  
   - Carry gum (haven’t needed it yet!).  

**The BEST Win So Far? ENERGY!**  
Seriously – I hit the gym at lunch AND did cardio after work today. That NEVER happened while vaping. This freedom feels incredible",1,1748467792.0,QuitVaping,0,1.0,False

My new result last week puts me at LDL 87, HDL 92, Triglycerides 49.
So that’s a relief and now I know it is at least possible to make changes. I did undertake some dietary sacrifices and made some significant alterations in the way that I eat.
What I did eat: liberal vegetables, tofu, tempeh, legumes, probiotic veggies and pre biotics and soluble fiber supplements (psyllium 15g a day, oat beta glucan 3g a day, apple pectin powder, dried citrus peel, inulin, glucomannan most days)
Meat - limited to max of 6oz per day. Beef no more than 1/week and max 4oz serving. Salmon, tuna and other white fish 2-3 times a week, chicken 2 times a week. 
Eggs - only egg whites once a week at most
Cow milk products - 4oz whole milk a day in coffee and 5oz low fat Greek yogurt, Parmesan cheese 1-2 servings once a week at most, no other cheese, no ice cream or butter
Saturated fat 13-18g a day consisting of mainly avocado, evoo, avocado oil, tree nuts, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, chia, flax, soy, oats.
Little to no processed foods. Grains and fruit in very small portions not more than 2 per day.
Supplements: Cholestoff (plant sterols) Citrus Bergamot, red yeast rice Monacolin, omega 3, 
Preload all meals with fiber supplements and small dose 30g or less of chickpeas or beans to bind cholesterol in the intestine. IF 16/8 most days with fiber fasting drinks during fasting window (psyllium usually)
Limited intake of any kind of fat to 5g at a time as much as possible, no big meals with fat bombs (even if unsaturated) because fat leads to excess bile release, then more cholesterol absorption.
I have one copy of apoe4 and am a cholesterol hyper absorber so the fiber regimen works pretty well in those circumstances. It has been a bit of a sacrifice but I may test loosening up a bit on the restrictions so I can maybe tell which of all these interventions are helping the most.

I was told that I need to clean the room to a high standard and recommended to hire a professional cleaner as many tenants with him that don't incur cleaning fees. I told him I would clean it without any professional cleaning.

I had cleaned over two days but there was some issues with a bit of limescale in the bathrooms and I had got rid of most of them. I was expecting that I may incur a cleaning fee for the limescale on the taps and the toilet, however the landlord's rate of £45 an hour I have told I think is too much, as online in the same area I see cleaners for £15-25 an hour. He mentioned that it took 3.5 hours.

After mentioning the price of £45 an hour is too much, He has put the price down to £35 an hour (\~£130) and says if I don't accept it he will dispute the deposit and attempt to claim the original fee of £150 for 3.5 hours of cleaning. Unfortunately I didn't take much pictures of the place when I arrived, but I took photos of the bathroom. I told the landlord that the fee even at £35 is too heavy but was told that I did have the choice to hire a professional cleaner but chose not to. I have mentioned to him that I am willing to pay £85 for any cleaning fees by comparing with the average rate of 3.5 hours of cleaning.

My room is an ensuite at £850 a month and stayed for a year. The room was in a mess when I got it (there was tobacco that I found in the drawers and behind the desk), however I signed an agreement that the room was in a good state as I cleaned up the desks myself and found the tobacco behind the desk later. So I cannot dispute that I had left the room in the state I found it as I had signed an agreement saying the room was clean.

There was other things mentioned that the landlord has photos of.

So here’s some background. I haven’t had a period since December of 2023. I was put on birth control at age 16 because my periods were irregular and I had acne (I honestly just wanted my acne to clear up). I’m now 22 years old and I actually got off my birth control in January of 2024. I had always dealt with body image issues, anxiety, and disordered eating. Around the time I got off my birth control my eating habits and anxiety really hit a peak and I rapidly lost weight. This was from restrictive clean eating and excessive exercise.

I was got off my birth control hoping to give my body a break from synthetic hormones and let it do its thing, hoping to get my period back on a normal timeline like the average person. However, it never came- still hasn’t. I’m sure the eating disorder didn’t help while my body was trying to adjust off the pill, however I’ve now been weight restored since January of 2025- and still nothing.

I got blood work done earlier this year, December/January, since being weight restored (gained about 20-25 pounds and weigh more than I started before the ED). My panel didn’t show anything of concern to my primary doctor except low TCH levels which my doctor said was just my hormones still recovering from being underweight for so long. Still nothing he was concerned with.

I’ve been all in since February, completely cutting out all exercise and walking except for the occasional 20 min walk just for some fresh air. I’ve completely given the situation up to the universe and have done a great job at relieving all stress (seriously this is the happiest and care free I’ve ever been). I don’t beat myself up or say any negative comments regardless of how new and uncomfortable this body feels currently. I get the best sleep I’ve gotten in years finally. I don’t count calories and make sure to eat 3 meals a day with snacks and dessert. I also really try to focus on protein, fats, and carbs. I eat within first 30 min of waking up and never have coffee on an empty stomach. I get discharge pretty regularly, some days are heavier out of the month but that’s it.

Am I doing something wrong??? Should I keep trying to do this naturally or is it time for medical intervention? I don’t want osteopenia or to lose my fertility. I’m so scared and I don’t know what my next move should be.",1,1748467178.0,Amenorrhearecovery,1,1.0,False

Two years ago I've been diagnosed with OCD and it was a real eye openner for me. Unfortunately though, I was (and still am) in a though economic situation and couldn't afford more therapy. The thing is - I imagined that I could go and try to put myself in situations that could work like exposure therapy - like doing something that makes me nervous and trying my best not to fall into the compulsion etc. 

I had some success with my strategy, now there's many situations in which I feel way less tense, but I ended up exaggerating it last year, took way too many challenges, and it was hellish, went out of it really burnt out. Now I feel like challenging myself, even for easier things, has gotten harder, and I'm struggling to advance further.

And some things just stress me out so much that I can never bring myself to do it for more than short periods (for example, in my case, sitting in an auditorium in a place that's not close to the exit) and some compulsions are indeed really hard to let go (another personal example being drinking coffee everytime I feel minimally sleepy). 

Another strategy I've recently taken is the awareness one - try to calm my mind with mantras/meditation and be as much aware as possible of my obsessions so that they loose their hold on me, but I'm really struggling to keep myself in that state and I frequently end up just going back to compulsions everytime I've got a stressor (and in our day and age, there's almost always a stressor at play). 

So I was wondering if anyone here has OCD/knows about the topic and would have some tips for me to get out of this stagnation point? Thank you!",2,1748467114.0,Healthygamergg,2,1.0,False

This K-66 electric hand saw is extremely rare, having been offered for only a few years. Built to an extremely high standard, it was intended to be a light saw for many operations that are commonly done via router, such as weather stripping slots, grooves, gains and dadoes. It's deep upper guard is peculiar to this model ( all other first and second generation saws have a removable outer plate ) due to the frequency with which a dado stack was to be fitted. The dado set, made for Porter-Cable by Huther Bros., is still with the saw after ninety years. Today's job was kerfing for a ""dutchman"" style repair on a support beam.
Due to the high cost ( about 80.00 in the mid-'30s ), the K-66 was not popular. Even a first class saw needs to be able to cut a 2""X4"" in half at full depth, a task the K-66 can't always do.

New for 1939, the T-33 Take-About worm drive belt sander was the result of earlier customer experience with the T-3 it was based on. As feedback showed the T-3 to be under powered and probe to overheating due to insufficient ventilation, Porter-Cable redesigned the platform with a new Ge motor making 3/4hp, and a distinctive art deco slotted front windshield that allowed the T-33 to gulp massive amounts of air via it's cast aluminum fan, making a sturdy, powerful sander well equipped to handle long sanding operations with ease. The T-33 was hugely popular, with at least two versions made for military use ( one being a three phase version, made for the Army Air Corps, that appears to be the earliest example of brushless power tool design ). Made until 1944, it would influence the design of the A-3/504, which would go on to be the longest produced power tool of all time at a whopping 67 years of production.
This muscle car of a belt sander made short shrift of sanding 92 sqft of PT lumber to a stain ready finish, and barely got as hot as a fresh cup of coffee.

So I found a used piece of furniture on Blocket and messaged the seller. The seller agreed and asked me to come pick it up. I went to their place, and everything was fine, the seller was an older person, probably in their 60s.

As I was getting ready to leave with the furniture, the seller suddenly handed me a plastic bag and asked me to ""put it in the bin outside the apartment."" The seller didn’t say it was trash, but the bag was semi-transparent and it was very clearly filled with household garbage.

I was a bit surprised and told them politely that ”I am Sorry and I came here just to pick up/buy the furniture. I think this is your trash, so you should probably handle it.” The seller insisted it wasn’t trash but it obviously was.

The whole interaction left me… unsettled. It’s not that I can’t help someone, I would have gladly done so if they'd simply said “Hey can you help me with this?” But the way it was worded and expected - clearly not requested and made it feel off.

And maybe this is me overthinking, but as a South Asian(visibly brown, closer to coffee than milk) living here in Stockholm, I couldn't help but wonder, would the seller have asked the same thing if I looked more like milk than coffee? Was it the subtle assumption that I wouldn't mind being asked to dispose of their garbage? Was it a case of casual entitlement, or even subconscious bias?

I’ve known that subtle racism doesn’t always show up in big, dramatic ways. Sometimes it’s in small, dismissive gestures, a boundary someone feels entitled to cross without hesitation.

I didn’t get angry. I just declined and left quietly, but deep down it really hurt. The whole situation has been playing on my mind ever since.  I couldn’t shake the feeling, did they see me as someone who came here to buy their trash, or just to take it out? We may have crossed oceans to build a life here, but moments like this make you question how some people still choose to see us.

I’m not sharing this to accuse or argue, just to say that even small moments like these can carry weight. Not because of the task itself, but because of what it reveals about how some people see us. And that stays with you !

1kxssym,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tboypodcast/comments/1kxssym/nespresso_drops_clooney_for_the_weeknd_to_sell/,Nespresso Drops Clooney for The Weeknd to Sell Iced Coffee 🧊☕,"For 15 years, Nespresso’s marketing playbook was simple: George Clooney, a steamy espresso, and a Lake Como vibe. But now? That espresso’s iced, and the soundtrack is The Weeknd. Nespresso — Nestlé’s $7B espresso empire — just pulled off its biggest brand pivot ever. Because Gen Z isn’t sipping hot coffee in a ceramic mug… they’re chugging iced coffee in a plastic cup. Half of Gen Z’s first coffee memory wasn’t hot at all — it was cold, frothy, and likely involved whipped topping. So Nespresso isn’t fighting the trend. It’s embracing it. In fact, their latest machines now let you double-tap to brew a shot strong enough to survive a tall glass of ice. And who’s helping spread the word? Not George Clooney — The Weeknd, via a brand-new concert sponsorship.



It’s a clever, quiet pivot. While older customers still associate Nespresso with Euro-style espresso shots, the company is subtly rebranding for a colder future. Clooney’s still around — but in the latest ads, he’s casually holding an iced drink (blink and you’ll miss it). Because Nespresso doesn’t want to scare off its OG fans. Instead, it’s pulling a “frog in a pot of water” move… only instead of boiling the water, it’s *freezing* it. The strategy is working: Nespresso’s US sales doubled last year, fueling its $7B in revenue — more than American Airlines. And Nestlé, the world’s largest food company, is proving it can still evolve. Slowly, but effectively.



**The Takeaway:** Nespresso isn’t ditching hot — it’s adding cold. And they’re doing it with stealth. That’s the magic of a great brand pivot: you don’t alienate your old customers, you attract new ones without the old ones even noticing. George Clooney lovers stay comfy. The Weeknd fans feel seen. The espresso’s the same — but the temperature (and the target audience) just dropped.

I'm a master's student living in Sweden, and I’ve been texting with a girl  for about two months. We first met casually on campus while I was having lunch I felt a nice energy from her, so I initiated a conversation. We exchanged Instagram, kept texting, and ran into each other a few times at events.

she is an introvert (she's mentioned this herself), and I’m more social and outgoing. Our texting rhythm has varied — sometimes she responds quickly, other times it takes a day or more. We've shared light banter, talked about food, culture, personal stories, and even sent memes. It feels emotionally open but not flirty.

Eventually, I asked her for fika (coffee meetup). She agreed and even suggested a date. The fika went well  we talked about studies, our backgrounds, and life in Sweden. After that, we went for a spontaneous walk  which lasted nearly 30 minutes. We had some laughs and good conversation, but I didn’t make any physical move  no hand touch or hug goodbye  mostly because I didn’t want to risk making her uncomfortable.

Since then, we’ve still been texting, but again at her usual slow pace. I sent a light-hearted message about cooking together (her teaching me how to make pierogi), and haven’t received a reply in 20+ hours. Now I’m overthinking everything.

I feel like I might be heading into the friend zone, but I also don’t want to push. I genuinely enjoy talking to her, but I also want to know if there’s any potential for attraction or a relationship not just friendly vibes.

I’m not originally from Sweden, so I’m trying to navigate all this across cultural and communication differences. I’d really appreciate any thoughts or advice from those who've dated introverts, navigated slow-burn connections, or just have a clearer radar than I do.

Short question: Is there a trick I'm missing, or am I right in thinking this is a permanent, non-removable set of retaining pin shafts? At first I thought they were hex sockets, but after a cleanup the crevices are just cylindrical. The flat tops don't seem to unscrew, but it's not an easy object to work with.

Background:  
This is a secondhand KitchenAid Household & Commercial Coffee Mill. KPCG100OB1. Worked great, heavy, lots of quality parts. But of course there are some plastic gears deep inside of the thing that finally lost a bunch of teeth, so the whole thing is out of operation. I'd hate to throw away something that's 90% functional and should last forever, but I'm also not able to shell out $100-$200 for an entire motor assembly: [https://www.appliancerepair.homedepot.com/PartDetail/Motor/W10845881/4459135](https://www.appliancerepair.homedepot.com/PartDetail/Motor/W10845881/4459135)

My plan was to disassemble the gearbox, measure and recreate some of the gears, 3D print them, and put it all back together as a science experiment. Worst case scenario, I'd practice some CAD/3D stuff, learn why PLA is very unsuitable for the task. Best case, post a useful file for the handful of other people out there who might try to do the same thing. I could probably still print something functional, but that metal plate is what interfaces with the steel bur screw, and I wouldn't bet money on that lasting long if it were made out of  any basic printer filament.",1,1748466256.0,fixit,3,1.0,False
1kxsitz,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/1kxsitz/survivor_wanting_some_input/,Survivor wanting some input,"I am a 15 year oral cancer survivor. I was 44 when I was diagnosed, had an extensive 10 hour surgery, then 32 radiation treatments. Other than minor side effects, physically, everything turned out fine. Mentally, I was not fine and my way of dealing with that was to be a miserable bastard to all my loved ones, my wife getting it the worst. Instead of healing and getting my shit together, I decided I would start a nonprofit and fill the void I felt that charities like the American Cancer Society were not filling. That turned out to be more of a drain on me mentally, because instead of healing myself, I was reading non stop horror stories of all these people dealing with their own cancers. I would highly recommend not doing that. Worry about healing yourself. 

Anyways, a year ago, it finally dawned on me that mentally I was finally capable of doing the nonprofit. We are a 501c3 nonprofit, fully legit. It is still a pain in the ass and I would recommend not starting one. My issue with the ACS was that being worth over a billion dollars and their payroll being in the hundreds of millions, it seems like they should do more for victims. We run with no employees and no payroll and get minimal donations. That is not deterring me though. My reason for this post is to get fellow cancer survivors or patients input on a couple things. 

We do mental health support through meeting up with patients and basically being a beacon of support. If I didn’t have cancer previously, I don’t think I would be qualified to speak to anyone. Even now, if it was someone terminal, I may not have the words. Our main fundraising efforts are to provide scholarships to students impacted by cancer. Whether this is their own cancer or their parent / caretaker. Cancer should not determine whether someone advances their education or not. Another thing we are doing is purchasing a military vehicle, an m35a2 deuce and a half. We do not have a facility and don’t plan on getting one. We use our local VFW for meetings and local coffee shops and such for meet ups with fellow cancer sufferers. We will use the vehicle to go to local high school sporting events, parades, etc. I am also thinking about using it to give patients a ride from their final radiation / chemo appointment, because fuck that stupid bell. Your fight is still ongoing. We can leave like the warriors they are. 

Do these things seem worthwhile to you? I’m not going to share the name of my nonprofit in the forum. I’m not begging for donations. I strictly want some input on our plans. Some might be a stretch for us to achieve, obviously. All we are wasting is time if it fails or if our goals take forever to reach. I’m just trying to give back a little as I look back at 15 years to the good. Leave a comment or message me. I would be happy to hear from you.

## Key Features Analysis

Choosing the right gift requires careful consideration of various factors, from functionality to personalization. Here is a breakdown of key features to look for when selecting a gift for your MIL.

**Personalization options**

Personalized gifts showcase thoughtfulness and effort, demonstrating that you've put in the time to create something unique. Look for items that can be engraved with her initials, a special date, or a meaningful quote. Alternatively, consider custom-made items that reflect her interests or hobbies, such as a painting depicting a cherished memory or a piece of jewelry incorporating her favorite colors and stones. Personalization takes a gift from ordinary to extraordinary, making it a cherished keepsake.

**Practicality and Usefulness**

A gift that is both practical and useful demonstrates that you understand your MIL's needs and lifestyle. Consider items that she can incorporate into her daily routine, such as a high-quality kitchen appliance, a comfortable robe, or a subscription box tailored to her interests. The key is to choose something that she will actually use and appreciate,rather than something that will simply collect dust on a shelf. Think about her daily habits and challenges and find gifts that address those needs in a thoughtful and practical way.

**Quality and Durability**

Investing in a gift that is built to last is a reflection of your respect and care. Opt for items made from high-quality materials that can withstand regular use and wear. Consider factors such as craftsmanship, construction, and warranty when making your decision. Durable gifts not only provide lasting enjoyment but also serve as a reminder of your thoughtfulness for years to come. Carefully research brands and read reviews to ensure you're choosing a gift that will stand the test of time.

**unique and Uncommon**

In a world saturated with generic gifts, something unique and uncommon can truly stand out. Seek out items that are not readily available in mainstream stores, such as artisan-crafted goods, limited-edition collectibles, or experiences that are tailored to her specific interests. A unique gift shows that you’ve put in extra effort to find something special and memorable. Consider supporting small businesses or self-reliant artists to discover truly one-of-a-kind treasures.

**Relevance to Interests/Hobbies**

The most triumphant gifts are those that align with the recipient's passions and hobbies. If your MIL enjoys gardening, consider a rare plant, a set of high-quality gardening tools, or a subscription to a gardening magazine. If she's a bookworm, a signed edition of her favorite author's latest novel or a subscription to a curated book box would be a thoughtful choice. Paying attention to her interests shows that you value her individuality and are invested in her happiness.

Well, folks. Today I gave the ol’ microwave a workout and dined with royalty, Chef Ramsay himself. Or at least his frozen alter ego. Picked up this fancy looking Lasagna with Bolognese Meat Sauce for $5.94, because sometimes I’ve  got champagne taste on a motel coffee budget.

First Impression:
Looks like something you’d get served at 30,000 feet in first class, if your pilot had a Michelin star. Real pretty. Sauce is bright, bold tomato. You can taste the carrots and onions doing jazz hands in the background. It’s a proper ragu situation.

Now the ricotta? Oh baby. SMOOTH, salty, herby, and garlicky like a warm hug from your Italian aunt who smells like oregano and menthols.

BUT…and this is a big but (like mine after two of these). Where’s the beef, Gordon? You call it bolognese but I’ve seen more meat in a packet of Top Ramen. Same thing happened last time I tangoed with one of your frozen masterpieces. Big flavor, tiny cow.

Final Score: 9/10
Flavor? Dynamite. Price? Chef’s kiss. Just give me a little more meat next time, Chef Fancy Pants. I’m a growing boy. Still.

Other Notes
This entree came in over weight frozen (329g) cooked (314g) package says 307g. So good job factory lasagna robots! ",42,1748466066.0,frozendinners,7,1.0,False
1kxsf8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1kxsf8f/first_fast_in_years_i_feel_amazing_today/,First Fast in Years & I Feel Amazing Today,"I’m nervous to share out loud with anyone in my immediate life that I’m attempting intermittent fasting (specifically the 2:5 method) starting this week because I tend to lose steam around any new methods of eating after a while + I think it would be cool to be private about it for at least a month and see if I can do it with myself as my only support system. I’m 5”2 and weigh 236lb, and while I struggle with my weight a lot and feel fatigued often, I’m hoping fasting will deliver mental benefits as well as I live with frequent depressive episodes. I’m feeling excited though and wanted to share my initial feelings with y’all.

I did my first 20-ish hour fast yesterday, the last thing I ate was popcorn at 10pm on Monday night, slept, & I broke my fast with some rice and an egg at around 7pm. I did drink coffee with cream in the morning and had some miso broth throughout the day to keep me going, it helped me so much. I know these can technically break a fast but it was my first fast since childhood (we used to fast for religious reasons on occasion) and it helped get me through while I’m easing into things. Ultimately I want to do 2 36hour fasts a week for a true 5:2. 

My first reflection is that breaking a fast feels so amazing (I know, duh!). But it feels amazing in a very specific way. I felt like I could be fully present with the food I was eating and even sat on my kitchen floor in the sun in silence while I was eating and didn’t think about anything but how appreciative my body was for the fuel in front of me. I savored it so much. Most of my eating habits are mindless/not even that enjoyable, it’s just habit. But this felt like eating the way humans are meant to eat - with so much gratitude, peace, intentionality, & joy. 

My second reflection is about the day after (today) and how much energy I have. It’s a huge difference from how I usually feel half way through the work week. I feel lighter on my feet, more excited for the day ahead, and am more calm. I don’t feel as many hopeless thoughts intruding on my brain, I just feel normal. It’s nice! I’m eating as I typically would today but am trying out a loose 10hour feeding window with another attempted fast tomorrow.

My third reflection is about how my body feels after the fast. I feel empty in the best way? It’s a void but a good void like how a good poop feels lol. A void that makes you feel more full somehow. I just feel more balanced and like my body is healing itself, and that’s only after a mini fast. I can’t wait to see what trying this out more often does for me in the long run. 

I’d love to hear your stories about fasting and how it’s affected you over time emotionally, physically, mentally, even spiritually if you care to share. 
And what’s your favorite tip for a beginner who wants to stick with it for the long haul? ",2,1748466029.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False

But ever since the day I met her she has haunted me every single night since. I don’t know her last name or anything about her really. I was too shy to take her number and when I got home that night I realised I messed up.

I’ve walked through every café near where I had seen her, pretending to sip coffee I didn’t even want—just scanning the room in case she was there. I’ve stood outside buildings, lounges, anywhere close to the place we had met hoping I meet her again. 

I’ve lost sleep. I’ve lost track of time. I’ve made up stories just to have an excuse to go out and look for her.

Sometimes I wonder if she’s real. Or if I imagined her because no real person should have this kind of power. But then I found her again.

Not where I expected or how I imagined. But she was there

If this sounds like fiction, that’s because it is. This is a similar scene from a book called ""For Eva"" on Wattpad. It’s messy, dangerous, intimate. A slow-burn thriller you can’t shake off. This one might mess you up in the best way.

I’ve been twitching since September 2023 but since I’m studying for my exams, I’ve got more alone time lying down and noticing them more and it got me annoyed in the need of venting. I twitch EVERYWHERE, maybe except tongue. Eyelids, buttcheek, back, palm, calf, everywhere I can think of. Several times a minute and I feel all of them. Also my legs jerk when lying down. They are very felt. And I’m so annoyed. It’s a very sensory experience. Worst when lying down but still feel some when sitting up. Sometimes I feel a slight burning sensation in my legs combined with it.

Last year was rough. I got so afraid of ALS I went to psych because I was losing my shit with anxiety. Got prescribed sertralin for anxiety and used that for a year until March. That (and time) made me stop thinking I had ALS since nothing else happened. In April I even started running and I progressed very quickly to running 10 k in just over an hour albeit I haven’t done much regular exercise in my 20’s. So I’m rationally quite convinced at this point. Still gets afraid though, as that is how anxiety works.

I smoke (almost every day), I drink (not everyday but often) and use caffeine either from regular coke and/or coffee. All the things listing in causing twitches. Have any of you had any success in decreasing the twitches by cutting that out? I’d like to but if it doesn’t change anything why bother.

Might be benign but damn it’s annoying.

We have been each others first everything, we’ve gone through major life events together, went to the same university, and had envisioned a life together. About two months ago she had brought up the idea of the two of us having a threesome with another woman, but both agreed we didn’t think it was the right time and that would something we could possibly entertain later. Ever since that conversation she had been distant and our sex life had been rocky. Historically our sex life had always been good (something she agreed with when we broke up), so the disturbance of our sex life had been a little troublesome for me. 

Flash forward to yesterday, and she suggests we get coffee to hang out (we lived together for part of undergraduate studies but I moved away for graduate studies). We were planning a small get away for next week and as I was talking about our plans she burst into tears, saying how she didn’t want me to look at her differently. After many tears (understandably) she told me that she believed she was gay. When we first started dating she had believed she was pansexual, and I fully supported in that, cause at the end of the day she loved me. 

After many more tears, from both of us now, she had told me that everything we had was genuine. She still both saw a future with me and loved me, but that sexually she’s been having difficulties recently. Ultimately she said we could try to figure things out together, but worries that in 10 years time after we have a life and kids together that she would resent me for not understanding her sexuality more and then blowing up our lives. She believed that was unfair to me and that she needs to understand this outside of our relationship, which I agreed. Having broken up, but on pretty amicable terms, we agreed that we want to stay friends and be a part of each others lives, but there will obviously be a bit of a transition/mourning period before we have any form of friendship. We aren’t going no contact, cause we both agree that being able to talk to each other, within reason obviously, would be healthy (not to pay ourselves on the back too much but I like to think we’re both very mature compared to our peers).

The reason I’m posting this ultimately is wanting advice on how to cope with this. I am internally angry at her. I’m so deeply hurt I want to scream at the top of my lungs, I want to tell her off and have a reason to hate her but I can’t, because ultimately she hasn’t done anything wrong and I still love her.

The last few months have been especially tough for me because I made the tough decision to leave my graduate degree. I think I viewed my girlfriend as a rock during this tough time of figuring out what I want in terms of a career for myself because she had finished her degree the previous spring. I now feel that rug has been pulled out from underneath me. I guess when life hits hard it really doubles down :’).

Ultimately, how do you cope with both the loss of a loved one and this feeling that I can’t be angry? 

TLDR: My girlfriend of 8 years has come out to me, we have decided to break up and I don’t know how to cope. Additionally I have recently made a huge life decision to leave my graduate degree and feel I have lost a rock that I had during this already hard time.

Many clients aboard will speak Chinese and you can find out more about the operator. [https://www.polarclub66.com](https://www.polarclub66.com)

**Day 1:  Arrival Ilulissat**

Upon your arrival in the coastal town of Ilulissat, located in West Greenland, our staff will warmly welcome you and assist with your transfer to our expedition ship. As you first set eyes on this vibrant town, you'll be struck by the breathtaking natural beauty that envelops it, with a bay adorned by icebergs of diverse shapes and sizes. 

In the evening, we will gather for a welcoming dinner, providing you with the opportunity to acquaint yourself with your fellow travelers. Your guide will host an informative session, outlining the itinerary for the upcoming days and detailing safety protocols while onboard. Following dinner, we will embark on our journey towards the Ilulissat Icefjord. As we sail into the enchanting midnight hours, we will immerse ourselves in the captivating spectacle of icebergs, each boasting unique and mesmerizing shapes.

   
We will capture photographs of icebergs adrift in the open waters of the icefjord. Keep a keen eye out for their extraordinary shapes – some icebergs may resemble castles, mountains, towers, or even form spectacular arches. They gleam under the midnight sun, their forms reflecting off the glassy water.

 

 

**Day 2: Oqaatsut & EQI Glacier**

 

Today, we sail towards Oqaatsut, a welcoming settlement. Formerly known as Rodebay, the settlement is home to just 45 inhabitants! We’ll get to know the friendly locals who still lives in traditional life and still highly relies fishing as their major income. 

 

In the afternoon, we will be sailing North.

 

Only few places in Greenland are as beautiful as the Eqi Glacier. By boat it is possible to get very close to the glacier and hopefully experience pieces of ice breaking off. The sounds are enormous and breath-taking. The 4km wide and 200m wall of ice rises between the mountains on the beautiful Greenlandic coast. You can hear and see the massive calvings from far away, as huge chunks of ice break off and hits the water. 

 

The Eqi glacier, also known as Eqip Sermia in Greenlandic, is located 80 km north of Ilulissat and is one of the largest calving glaciers in all of Greenland. From here, there is easy access to the ice sheet, which is why it was used by some of the first polar explorers in Greenland to study the ice sheet.

 

The distance from where we can admire the glacier also varies depending on the amount of ice that have calved from the glacier front. Usually we will be within 2-3 kilometres from the glacier. No matter the exact distance to the glacier, it is an incredible experience to witness the enormous glacier, and hopefully a calving - big or small. 

 

During our sailing, our expedition leader will explain about the nature we pass, the glacier itself and the cultural history of the area. If we are lucky, we might spot a whale or two on the way to the glacier.

**Day 3 : EQI Glacier**

The day begins with breakfast, followed by a 5km hiking towards the edge of the glacier. We embark on a hike to the Moraine at the Edge of the Ice Sheet. Starting from the port, we trek around the small lagoon situated at the glacier's southern end. During the breeding season, this area often hosts large flocks of geese. The hike then progresses up to the moraine, offering us the opportunity to peer down into the immense crevasses of the glacier just a few hundred meters away. From this vantage point, we also gain a panoramic view of the glacier's front, where we may witness the awe-inspiring calving glacier. After enjoying the beautiful views, we will hike back to the expedition ship for dinner.

 

 

**Day 4: South Glacier - North Glacier - Saqqaq**

 

Today, our voyage takes us across the expansive South Glacier and North Glacier, where the glacier front extends over 10km. Navigating through narrow fjords adorned with icebergs of varying sizes, we'll be immersed in a stunning icy landscape. By late afternoon, we'll reach Saqqaq, the northernmost settlement in the Ilulissat region.

 

Our itinerary includes a visit to an Inuit family, where we'll be warmly welcomed with Greenlandic cakes and coffee. As we indulge in these local delicacies, our hosts will share captivating stories and insights into life in North Greenland.

 

 

**Day 5: Disko Island**

 

Today, we sail to Disko Island. Disko Island is known for its stunning scenery.  As you get closer to the island, you will see the majestic mountains, which rise a thousand meters from the surface of the ocean. At the top of the mountain, the giant glacier, Sermersuaq, is located, and it covers all the west sides of Disko Island.

 

After arriving in the small town of Qeqertarsuaq, you will be given an introduction to this rugged, yet stunning island. Qeqertarsuaq is the main town of Disko Island. With its various colored houses, it has a very idyllic setting with the harbuor and the mountains on one side and the coast and sea on the other. It is not uncommon to spot whales when strolling along the coast.

 

There is time for a town walk, where you get an insight into the town’s old as well as more recent history. Along the way, you will encounter a lot of beautiful sights for your travel photography.

 

 

**Day 6 - Disko Island - Ilulissat**

 

In the morning, you can enjoy a walk to Kuannit. We will explore the vast, natural wilderness on foot. We hike from the town and pass the Red River at the bridge and continue along the coast. At Kuannit, we can see how the lava has sprung up millions of years ago and then, during rapid cooling, has contracted and cracked into spectacular lava sculptures in the shape of 6-sided basalt columns. The fauna at Kuannit is very lush with a variety of flowers and tasty Angelica plants. On the coastline, you will find a basalt stone shaped like an elephant drinking directly from the sea. The Arctic summer vegetation, volcanic formations as well as the icebergs drifting along the coast. After, we will be sailing back to Ilulissat, just in time to enjoy the midnight sun among icebergs.

**Day 7: Ilulissat**

Today, we will hike along the magnificent icefjord. Beautiful icebergs provide the setting for the former settlement of Sermermiut 1.5 kilometers south of Ilulissat. For 4,000 years, different Inuit cultures lived in the settlement and, today, you can still see the sparse ruins which indicate their presence. Hear about the life of the Inuit people and their traditions before the Europeans came to Greenland. See the ruins and touch the permafrost with your own hands. On this hike, we will pass “Kællingekløften” where you can enjoy the magnificent view of the Ice Fjord, before heading back again. During the hike, there will be time to talk about flora, fauna, geology, and not least, amazing facts about the omnipresent ice.

In the late afternoon, we will go out to sailing again to look for whales. It surprises most people how great an experience it is getting close to such large animals like whales. In the summer it is usually the humpback whale, minke whale and the fin whale we see. The humpback whale is despite its up to 18 meters and 30 tons the acrobat among the great whales. It can throw itself out of the water and turn the tail and flippers. It is easily recognized on the humped fin and white back on the tail when it dives. Around the Disko Bay there are good opportunities to watch humpback whale in its hunt for fish, squid and krill.

**Day 8: Departure**

It’s the end of our Arctic adventure. In the morning, we'll meet together for breakfast and farewell to each other, say goodbye to Greenland. You’ll be transferred to the airport and depart to Copenhagen or Reykjavik.

Don't plan on gaming a massive amount but I do tend to wake early and if I'm enjoying a coffee on the patio and want to play something I'm wondering what games everyone likes to just chill and relax with.

Duration - June 13 to July 7th
Price - $2200

Description:
This listing is for an amazing spacious top floor apartment in a two family home located in Ridgewood, Queens.
This apartment isn't your standard New York apartment, but rather a home. I am the first tenant since a complete renovation was finished in January 2022, and over the last few years I have poured every bit of myself into making this the apartment of my dreams. 
The mudroom is filled with warm light, featuring a large closet for hanging coats and taking off shoes without having to track anything into the rest of the living space. 

The living room area is expansive, filled with natural light from three gorgeous windows, framed in floor to ceiling white linen curtains paired with internal blackout blinds if you wanted a little more privacy, or to watch something on the 150"" retractable projector screen complete with 5.1.2 surround sound. Sit back and enjoy on the all white tuxedo shaped CB2 couch with a bowl of popcorn, it's truly your own movie theater.

Located next to the living room is the bedroom. This giant room measures around 20 feet long, filled with wall to wall Turkish silk rugs that I brought back from the Grand Bazaar myself, paired with custom warm lights controlled via an Alexa. There are retractable blackout blinds located in both windows, and also feature an Alexa voice activation. Retired to bed for the evening? Just ask Alexa to lower the blinds and turn out the lights. 

If you continue rearward, you will run into an 18 foot long office/dining area, painted in forest green. The built in bookshelves and desk offer a perfect work area for those working remote, or want to set up a laptop/internet station. Paired with Verizon FIOS, I have the 1GB internet package set up on a Unifi Wireless Network. You'll never miss a beat, but your heart may skip one when you notice the 72"" tall art deco mirror located next to the three tall windows that always makes sunrise worth waking up for. 

Brew yourself a cup of coffee in the kitchen, located right next to the dining room with my Terrakafe TK02 coffee machine. Bright and spacious with stainless steel appliances, a wonderful full stove, side by side refrigerator, and large microwave. I have everything you need to cook dinner, or host a small gathering. 

The bathroom is clean and generously sized. Featuring a bath tub and a small radiator which warms the room nicely during the winter.

1kxs3a9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1kxs3a9/greg_n_vic/,Greg n Vic,"Greg shifted as he stood, looking around, wringing his hands, nervous. To his left, across the street, he saw a woman in business attire and a fancy purse glance at him for a second. That's all it took for his fight or flight response to spike again; his agoraphobia was in full swing after having only taken the bus and arrived downtown. Even after the woman had turned the corner and was long gone, his paranoia lingered, and his brain kept questioning if she recognized him.

It was too much, he said to himself, and Greg started to panic, but he did what his therapists had told him over n over; to breathe and ground himself in the moment. The woman was just a stranger, and while he had his reasons to be tense, he had to hold out. Tucking his tail n running was a nonoption; he was there to meet someone. 

They had met and talked online, Reddit specifically. Greg had been waging an ongoing war with his mental health, and more, which had stripped him of the few friends he had, and for good reason, but the man who had been posting incessantly in his home town's subreddit was looking to cure his loneliness and possibly find a plug for the psychedelics he so fervently sought after, believing them to be a cure for his maladaptation. 

There was more that Greg was up to online and off, which was the source of his paranoia, but in the wayward foolishness of his youth, he hadn't fully put together that he was causing all his problems. As such, when Vic finally strolled up behind him and heavily plopped his hand on Greg's shoulder from behind, the paranoid schizophrenic nearly jumped out of his skin.

“Woah man, it's just me! Vic. Didn't mean to scare you like that.”

Greg tried to slow his exploding heart, taking heavy breaths and nodding before stammering, “how are you?”

Vic smirked. “Ah, y'know, it's just another Tuesday for me, being the robust criminal I am. Speaking of which, I need to ask, are you a cop?”

Shocked, Greg stuttered out a no, which just made Vic chortle. “Ah, y'know, I didn't really need to ask.” When Greg made a confused look, Vic continued. “They train undercover cops to be very bold in their actions to convince rookie criminals that they're not a cop. You? Ah geez, you look like if you found yourself in half the situations I've been in, you'd make a mud pie in your pants.”

Greg was taken back by this, but in it, he found some relief. He had worried he was being set up, and of course such paranoia doesn't just let something go, so the rube wasn't fully assuaged of his fears, but he looked over Vic, with his mushroom shirt n dirty pants n green converse with the broken shoelace, and felt a slight relief. This was someone that might get him.

And so, in the awkwardness that comes with meeting a stranger, they talked. And walked. And soon they found themselves walking past a line of parked cars, where Vic would glance in each window in between his exposition of the drugs he had done n does, with Greg lying to make himself seem cooler. That was, until the pair came across a green Kia.

“Look at this,” Vic said with a wide smile, before looking around. “Some bozo left a brand new iPhone in their front seat!” And so Greg looked at the unopened box of tech, but he didn't get to look long, as Vic, certain no one was watching, gave the window a sharp jab, shattering it. Naturally, Greg found himself jolted into a near panic, but in seeing how casually Vic reached into the passenger seat and lifted the phone without anyone noticing, he swallowed between deep breaths, and accepted that this was alright. This guy knew what was up.

Of course, as Vic handed the phone to Greg, telling him it was his gift to him, for new friendships, Greg found himself trusting this new soul in his life far more than he thought he could. It was always standing on your toes with people, because surely they couldn't accept the full Greg, but maybe…maybe this person would understand. 

And so they continued their walk n talk, with Greg being quite a bit bolder this time. He started telling Vic things he never told anyone, though he was wise to frame the things he said in the best light. But, it wasn't Vic's place to judge him; he was there to be his new friend, as Vic could empathize with him, having been lost once himself.

Thus, when they found themselves outside a Starbucks, Vic offered to get him a coffee. Joyous of his new friend's generosity, Greg swelled up his courage and got really bold. After ordering, he told Vic to watch this, as he really wanted someone on the same wavelength as him to understand, amd maybe more. And so, Greg began a steady walk, making a b-line towards the bathroom, where a young woman in yoga pants was standing with her back turned, waiting for her caffeine fix, and in the blink of an eye, Vic saw as Greg's hand clearly brushed up against the woman's behind.

Vic quickly checked the clock while rolling his eyes at this wild cat, who played it off as an accident before continuing to the bathroom. Then he came back, and they drank their bean juice whilst openly discussing a variety of illegal activity they both had done.

Then time passed, as it does, and Vic found himself needing to leave, for he had other obligations. Greg, beyond cheerful for having met someone cool, was then exuberant as Vic handed him a small baggie with some a couple small squares of paper in it. When he went to thank him, Vic held his hand up and shook his head. “No, you deserve it,” he said.

They then split, departing their separate ways, with Greg heading to catch the next bus, while Vic slowly retraced his steps back the way he came. He stopped in front of the green Kia with the window he smashed, taking out his keys and pressing the unlock button. The Kia's lights flashed, and the door unlocked, allowing Vic to grab the brush and clean the glass off the passenger seat and floor.

Finally, he strolled over the driver's side and got into his car, before taking his phone out and making a call.

“Yea. Just got done. He’s up to a lot, I’ll fill you in when I get back to the station, but while you’re waiting, request the video footage from the Starbucks on Elm, timestamp around 12:17. Also, I guarantee he is going straight home and taking all that acid at once, so tune Pegasus with…” and he reaches over to his glove box and pulls out the phone number for the iPhone he bought earlier that morning, before reading it off whilst thinking of things they could do that evening to really scare Greg with America's spyware, as the Patriot Act allows. And after saying some tidings to end the call, Vic then lights a cigarette before muttering to himself, “God, I hate this job…”

1kxs35w,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitVaping/comments/1kxs35w/has_anybody_dealt_with_similar_very_bizarre/,"Has anybody dealt with similar, very bizarre symptoms from vaping?","I have spent the last 6 months searching every corner of Reddit to find anybody else that may possibly have dealt with similar mouth symptoms. Specifically related to speech and talking. 

First, let me preface this by saying over the course of the last two years, I have had virtually every test under the sun. I have seen two neurologists, had two MRIs, multiple EEGs, and seen everyone rlse from allergists, to primary care, cardiology, down to even mental health. Everybody says I’m perfectly fine. Vaping is just that one thing I have yet to successfully stop, to see if this is the cause of my symptom. 

Now that that is over, the main bizarre symptom I have i would sum up as “the inability to talk as well as I used to”. 

The best way I can even attempt to put this into words, is that I just have a hard time getting the words out that’s I wants to say. I feel as if my throat, mouth, and or vocal cords just don’t do what I ask of them, as well as they used to. Pair this with a type of brain fog, like my brain and mouth just don’t work together. I know what I want to say, just can’t say it. I used to be one of the most articulate, well spoken individuals I know. I said what I wanted to with such clarity and confidence that the last thing my focus on when talking was myself.  Even while vaping (I have vaped for 10 years). However in the past few years, this has fallen off a literal cliff. 

I want to mention that I have asked everyone around me if they can notice any deficits , and every single person says I sound the exact same. However to myself, it’s so bad I question if I had a stroke or something (confirmed no with MRI). So with that information and all the doctors tests coming back negative, I’m down to this is more of a perception based thing that I certainly notice, but nobody around me does. 

A good way to explain it would be like if you drank a super hot coffee, and it burned your tongue and throat and you just had some slight tension in your face, and like your tongue didnt work maybe 10% less. Almost like an inflammation type thing that makes me sound muffled and nasally to myself, and then when I think I am sounding muffled, I focus on it more than I should which causes me to internalize too much during conversation, which causes brain fog and the cycle continues. 

One final note, I did successfully quit vaping for 8 months, and made a full transition to zyn. This however did not solve my problems. I’ve tried freebase sub ohm vaping, salt disposables, and salt pouches (zyn). The only thing I haven’t successfully tried is quitting. 

This is ruining my life and virtually every conversation I have. Has anybody else dealt with something similar and did quitting vaping improve it?

TL;DR
Has anybody else had vaping/zyn cause a perceived reduced ability to talk or a reduced ability of articulation. ",2,1748465228.0,QuitVaping,1,1.0,False

The lounge is spacious with 2 bars and plenty of seating. Most seats had electric plugs that worked. There is an upstairs and downstairs as well as double stall bathrooms, showers and a mother’s room. 

At check in you’re given one drink ticket per person redeemable at the bar. You’re allowed one free alcoholic drink as well as unlimited soft drinks (sprite, Coke, ginger ale). They have lots of liquor options but the name brand stuff (Teremana, Patron, Tito’s, Kahlua, Member’s Mark etc.) wasn’t included for priority pass and came at a cost. On this day they were out of the free tequila, chardonnay and some beers. The self serve coffee machine had lattes, hot chocolate, cappuccino and so on. 

Food Buffet: Chicken and mushrooms, diced oxtail, white rice, pasta, a salad bar, mini sandwiches, carrot cake and mini zebra cakes.

The consumer landscape on May 28, 2025, presented a dynamic mix of financial market activity, emerging trends in personal finance and technology, and ongoing legal battles impacting consumer rights. From fluctuating share prices to evolving consumer habits and significant product launches, here's a comprehensive overview of the day's developments.

**Financial Markets and Consumer Spending:**

The Indian stock market saw activity across various sectors, with several large-cap companies experiencing intraday fluctuations. Hindustan Unilever (Personal Care sector), a bellwether for consumer spending, traded around ₹2368.25, fluctuating throughout the day with a negative one-day return of -0.63%. Over the past month, the stock has shown a return of 2%, and over the last three months, 7.95%. ITC (Cigarettes & Tobacco Products) closed at ₹421.4, with a one-day return of -2.93%. Tata Consumer Products (Tea & Coffee) traded at ₹1124.3, with a one-day return of -1.21%. Bharti Airtel (Telecom Services) closed at ₹1862, reflecting a positive one-day return of 0.95%, and Trent (Retail - Apparel/Accessories) at ₹5575.3, reflecting a nearly flat one-day return of 0.03%. These figures highlight the inherent volatility of the market, with different sectors experiencing varying degrees of gain and loss, influenced by consumer behavior, and macroeconomic factors.

**Changing Consumer Habits and Insurance:**

A significant trend emerging among young Indian professionals is the increasing adoption of insurance products. ""What used to be a parental afterthought and met with glazed eyes is now an adulting milestone,"" the reports state. This shift is attributed to rising awareness about the costs of medical treatments and financial planning. Cashless claims and term plans are now more common discussion topics amongst young professionals, replacing the usual weekend plan conversations. This evolution suggests a growing focus on long-term financial security and a recognition of the need to mitigate potential risks.

**Legal Battles and Consumer Rights:**

The legal sphere continues to address long-standing issues of consumer rights and corporate accountability. A Delhi court directed the registration of an FIR against Parsvnath Developers for an alleged 17-year delay in constructing a shop in a mall.

Hi friends, neighbors, and kind souls—

My name is Travis Ramsey, and if we’ve crossed paths in Greenhaven or at the Dollar Tree, you might remember me. After a long and difficult journey through homelessness, I finally have a place to call home at Martin Luther King Village in Sacramento—thanks to the incredible support of Turning Point, a local nonprofit.

But while I now have a roof over my head, I’m starting almost completely from scratch. I’m currently appealing my SSDI claim due to schizophrenia, and I have no steady income right now. I’m doing everything I can to build a safe, healing environment—for myself and my loyal German shepherd, Loki.

That’s why I’m reaching out. I’ve created a GoFundMe to raise money for the basic essentials I still need to turn this apartment into a true home. If you’re able to donate, even a little, it will make a world of difference. 🙏

👉 https://gofund.me/7549eb45 👈

Other ways you can help:
If you have any gently used furniture or household goods—think: tables, chairs, cookware, lamps, shelves, a small TV stand—I’d be deeply grateful. Every little bit helps.

Some amazing neighbors have already stepped up with things like an air fryer, a couch, a lamp, fresh bedding, and even a red coffee maker that brightens my mornings. 🛋️🍳☕ Their kindness has helped me feel human again—and I can’t wait to share photos soon to show how it’s all coming together.

I’d go on the apps, have a few conversations, maybe a date or two, but nothing meaningful ever came from it. I kept wondering what I was doing wrong or if I just was never going to get lucky enough to find my person. At one point, I started thinking maybe dating just wasn’t for me.

Here’s what finally shifted things and eventually led me to my partner, and yeah, even a career I never saw coming.

I took a step back from the apps and started rethinking how I was approaching dating, who I was choosing, how I was showing up, and how I was moving things forward or not. The biggest change was focusing on clarity around what I actually wanted from dating, and showing up in a way that was honest and intentional, not just expecting fate to step in or relying on dating apps to bring me my life partner. (Not to say dating apps can't be useful, they have their role...)

My background is in behavioral science, so I figured, why not apply some of those principles—like understanding my own patterns, setting clear goals, and being more mindful about where I spent my time and energy? The shift didn’t magically fix everything, but it changed the entire experience. I ended up pushing myself to be intentional about where I was going and what I was doing, rather than leaving love to chance. I frequented a coffee shop, which is where I ended up meeting someone and we clicked in a way that never seemed to happen online. We probably wouldn’t have ever matched on an app, since we found out later our settings were totally different (we never would have even come up for each other). That connection grew into the most meaningful relationship I’ve had, and we’re still together today.

After that, I started helping a few friends who were stuck like I’d been. Then their friends started asking, and eventually I became a dating coach. It wasn’t planned, but it’s been really rewarding to help people figure this stuff out, now that I finally have.

I wrote a guide pulling together what helped me the most. But mostly I just wanted to post this in case anyone here is feeling discouraged or stuck. I know what that feels like, and I want you to know things absolutely can change. I was a shy guy who didn't know what he was doing at all. But with a little intentionality, that changed for me, and it can definitely change for you. I hope this helps or inspires someone who needs it today.",3,1748464600.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

Mornings Are a Trap
Woke up at 4:30 a.m. and had one of those thoughts:
""It's only an hour and a half till work... I could just stay up and be early.""
Wrong. Terrible idea. If you're ever wondering—always go for the extra sleep. Future me will back me up on that.

Desk Life and a Tiny Burger Victory
Started work at 6 like usual. Knocked out a few tickets, helped a couple folks, and somehow made it to lunch on just a coffee and a burger. Not the healthiest, but it felt like a win.

Small Town Grocery Run
After work, I stopped by the local IGA here in Carlyle, IL. It’s the kind of grocery store that feels like it got trapped in time and decided it liked it there. We grabbed steaks and artichokes for dinner—tonight’s gonna be a real pinky out situation.

Movie Night & Mental Gymnastics
My whiteboard finally showed up, which means it's time to sit down and watch one of those brain-bending time travel movies Dennis and I planned for our little review club. Wish me luck—I might need a timeline flowchart just to follow the plot.

Family Stuff
Some tough family drama from my brother’s side—huge sad face there. But it sounds like he’s starting to heal a bit after the whirlwind, and honestly, that’s all I could hope for right now.

1kxrmwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismTranslated/comments/1kxrmwz/my_therapist_made_me_feel_bullied_when_i_talked/,My therapist made me feel bullied when I talked about my stress level,"I'm SO SORRY about the length of this, but idk what's important and what's not.

I have been seeing the same therapist for almost 3 years and have loved her for most of this time. Of course I've sometimes felt like we're in a ""coffee klatch"" (""what's happened since last week?"") or I'm in an echo chamber (basically reaffirming whatever I'm saying), but mostly she's been helpful in dealing with a terrible work situation and some relationship issues. I initially found her because she had DBT as one of her specialities and I had just done an IOP that used it, so I thought I'd try to continue the methodology. We basically have never gone through those steps. But I've felt supported and validated and like I have someone I can tell 98% of things to, so I've continued to see her. 

I'm undiagnosed - haven't been able to figure out how to do the assessments as an adult, insurance, all that, while being a mother, having a full-time job, etc. - but all signs point to ASD, which is why I'm even in this group. My husband is an only child, which has caused issues throughout this time with what I think of as selfish or self-absorbed behavior and thoughts; about 2 months ago, I went on and on about how being an only child makes it so you don't get the daily little compromises and whatnot that make you a good partner (what prompted this was hearing my kids having some little quibble about taking too long in the shower or not putting their toothbrush away or something like that, which forced them to have to deal with it when an only child wouldn't even have that come up). She has only one child. Afterwards, I realized that was probably pretty rude, but forgot about it at the next session and things were fine. 

Then on April 25 (just checked my texts, didn't know this offhand), she told me I HAD to exercise that day to deal with my stress level. For context, the last day of one job was May 2, the first for the next was May 5, I was getting married May 24, and my ex-husband was going to be away for the entire month of May (with less than a week's notice), leaving me to have the kids 24/7 (obv I would love to have them 24/7, but when you get into the routine of the parenting time schedule and then that's changed...well, I think you of all people would get it) all while planning a 5-day-long wedding. Rather than me try to explain what happened, here's the text convo:

Me: I'm sorry but I'm having a really hard time making decisions re prioritization. I JUST got done with the IT call for the new job and need to pick the kids up at 4:30 for [son]'s therapy. I was opening up the iFit app and got a notification of fraudulent activity on a dormant card. I also haven't eaten yet today. Should I still work out? I'm sorry I'm having a really difficult time thinking right now. I don't know what to do. I'm freaking out. I assume it has something to do with not having eaten, in which case I should eat. But then idk if I'll have time to deal with the fraud and work out, but then I'm just going to be considered lazy. And I can't stop crying, which makes it harder for me to think.

Her: Im sorry to hear about the card, call the card right away and confirm/report. Watch out because sometimes they scam people scaring them about fraud. Don't do anything unless you personally call your credit card. With regards to eating , skipping meals is never a good idea especially when you need the energy to deal with everything you have going on. Take care of your eating, the kids and their therapy and if you have extra time try to see if you can walk even with the kids or [new hubs].  Sex is also a  workout and we know it helps you and more than one way so maybe try to make a little bit of time for that at the end of the day to wind down.

Me: On the phone with them now (it was Experian that notified me) and trying to multi-task by eating but all I could find that doesn't need to be made is chips, which kind of defeats the whole purpose of working out... Whatever, I guess it doesn't matter. I have a terrible headache and sex is the furthest thing from my mind. Thanks for trying to think for me. I'll force myself to have sex if I can't somehow work out after therapy, dinner, Scouts, and bedtime. I hate my life so much.

At our next session, she asked about working out. I told her I did it and she asked how I felt after. I was honest and said that I wish I hadn't because I felt disgusting the rest of the day (from sweating and not having time to shower) and got to my son's therapy 10 min late. She said I was being too negative and should've felt accomplished, and gotten the good ole endorphins going or something. I ended up crying, but she then gave me homework and so I felt like maybe it was going to be a ""breakthrough"" of sorts. The next session, I told her how that made me feel, she thanked me for that and we talked about the homework. The session after that was fine, just talked about the stress of the wedding. 

Then yesterday, it happened again. We were talking about how my to-do list never goes down and the stress is piling up - what prompted that is that I have essentially no memory of my 5-day wedding and I was concerned it had to do with severe stress. She showed me her lengthy to-do list and said how it's normal for a mom/adult and I said that I think there's something wrong with me that I can't handle this like everyone else seems to be able to. (She also told me to get a second opinion from a neurologist to make sure everything was fine medically, but they've already done a CT, MRI, and EEG, so I don't see the point in getting on a months-long waiting list for a new doctor only to have them see the exact same thing.) Everything she was suggesting was stuff I've OBVIOUSLY thought of and tried to implement before, like breaking down tasks into smaller parts and making a schedule for what to clean when. It's akin to when you're concerned with your doctor about your weight and they say, ""have you tried diet and exercise?"" Like, no shit, Sherlock - I'm 44 years old and you think I've never thought of or tried that?! Well she thought that I was putting down her suggestions and when I explained that I had already thought about/tried to implement everything she'd suggested, she again got pissed off and made me cry. 

What do I do? I saw another post on here about how CBT isn't good for autists because we already (over) dissect everything and I think that may be part of the problem. But I'm not diagnosed so I can't really ""blame"" it on ASD, and I'm apparently being rude by trying to not waste either of our time by thinking about things that already haven't worked. I keep thinking that maybe she's just having a tough time in her life right now that's making her like this when she hasn't for almost 3 years. She's making me feel like crap and even more of a failure than I already feel. 

Do I just go along with it and trust that ""8th time's the charm!"" for these things? I don't want to waste my time, especially when an hour a week could be spent on my to-do list, but also, if whatever she says ultimately works, then maybe dealing with my to-do list and stress would be more manageable. I don't want to just end the therapeutic relationship because I've really liked her up until April. But maybe it's run its course? Maybe she's seen enough of my complaining and is giving me some tough love? Idk I really don't know how to read this situation. If this had happened a lot earlier, I'd be donezos, but there are so many good parts too. In short, I think the issue is: how much does it matter that I feel like shit in therapy?

But there’s a side to this that really bothers me.

When one of these women first joined the team, this same older colleague privately showed me a revealing photo of an OnlyFans model on his phone and said, “Doesn’t she look like her?” It was creepy and wildly inappropriate. The man is in his late 50s... phone full of half-naked models. I was so stunned I didn’t say anything at the time, but it stuck with me.

I’d go on the apps, have a few conversations, maybe a date or two, but nothing meaningful ever came from it. I kept wondering what I was doing wrong or if I just was never going to get lucky enough to find my person. At one point, I started thinking maybe dating just wasn’t for me.

Here’s what finally shifted things and eventually led me to my partner, and yeah, even a career I never saw coming.

I took a step back from the apps and started rethinking how I was approaching dating, who I was choosing, how I was showing up, and how I was moving things forward or not. The biggest change was focusing on clarity around what I actually wanted from dating, and showing up in a way that was honest and intentional, not just expecting fate to step in or relying on dating apps to bring me my life partner. (Not to say dating apps can't be useful, they have their role...)

My background is in behavioral science, so I figured, why not apply some of those principles—like understanding my own patterns, setting clear goals, and being more mindful about where I spent my time and energy? The shift didn’t magically fix everything, but it changed the entire experience. I ended up pushing myself to be intentional about where I was going and what I was doing, rather than leaving love to chance. I frequented a coffee shop, which is where I ended up meeting someone and we clicked in a way that never seemed to happen online. We probably wouldn’t have ever matched on an app, since we found out later our settings were totally different (we never would have even come up for each other). That connection grew into the most meaningful relationship I’ve had, and we’re still together today.

After that, I started helping a few friends who were stuck like I’d been. Then their friends started asking, and eventually I became a dating coach. It wasn’t planned, but it’s been really rewarding to help people figure this stuff out, now that I finally have.

I wrote a guide pulling together what helped me the most. But mostly I just wanted to post this in case anyone here is feeling discouraged or stuck. I know what that feels like, and I want you to know things absolutely can change. I was a shy guy who didn't know what he was doing at all. But with a little intentionality, that changed for me, and it can definitely change for you. I hope this helps or inspires someone who needs it today.",1,1748463844.0,DatingTips,0,1.0,False
1kxrhrv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestOfPrimeDay/comments/1kxrhrv/best_home_gadgets_to_watch_for_prime_day_2025/,Best Home Gadgets to Watch for Prime Day 2025,"Hey r/BestOfPrimeDay! With Prime Day 2025 around the corner, I’ve been diving into Google Trends to see what **home-related products** are heating up. Here’s a roundup of 8–10 trending home gadgets that are expected to get juicy discounts (and have shown year-over-year momentum). Let’s get into it! 

* **Robot Vacuum Cleaners**  – Automated vacuums (Roomba, Roborock, etc.) continue to be big hits. They see sales spikes every major sale event (Prime Day included) and the market is still growing 10% annually. New models with AI navigation (even poop-detection, looking at you Roomba j7+ ) are keeping these trending as must-haves. **Why trending?** Busy lifestyles + viral cleaning hacks = people want robots to do the chores. These were hot items in Prime Days past and are likely to be front-and-center again. *Tip:* Watch for bundle deals (vacuum + auto-empty dock combos) and check reviews on newer brands (Eufy, Shark) which often undercut Roomba’s price.

* **Air Fryers**  – The air fryer craze is still going strong, dominating kitchen trend charts. These “kitchen superstars” have **soared in popularity** over the past few years for healthier, oil-free cooking. Many models now multitask (roast, bake, even dehydrate). Air fryers were Prime Day champs in previous years, and with *new* dual-basket and smart models out, expect hefty discounts. **Why trending?** Endless TikTok recipes and the quest for convenient healthy meals keep search interest high. *Deal tip:* Compare models—sometimes last year’s top-rated fryer gets a bigger discount than this year’s new release.

* **At-Home Ice Cream Makers (Ninja CREAMi)**  – TikTok made us do it! The Ninja CREAMi ice cream maker went **viral** for turning protein shakes and random ingredients into ice cream, and it *sold like crazy* on Prime Day 2024. It’s still trending as people love DIY frozen treats. **Why trending?** It’s the perfect combo of a new tech-y kitchen gadget and social media hype (who doesn’t want to recreate those funky TikTok ice cream recipes at home?). If you missed it last year, Prime Day 2025 might be your chance. *Tip:* If the Ninja CREAMi is on sale again, jump fast – it **sold out** quickly last time!

* **Air Purifiers**  – Home air quality is a big concern these days, so purifiers remain hot. Google Trends shows steady interest with *spikes* in winter (flu season) and summer (allergy season). With COVID sticking around and pollution on folks’ minds, people are paying more attention to the air in their homes. **Why trending?** Health and wellness trends + news about wildfires and allergies = everyone wants a HEPA filter working overtime. These have been popular during past Prime Days (remember how Coway and Levoit deals kept selling out?). *Deal tip:* Look for trusted brands (Levoit, Coway, Dyson) and check coverage area – Prime Day deals often bundle extra filter replacements too.

* **Smart Thermostats**  – Devices like the Nest Learning Thermostat and ecobee are *heating up* in search interest. Google Trends shows a surge in queries for “smart thermostats” and “home automation” continuing to rise. **Why trending?** Saving on energy bills *and* controlling your AC from your phone = a win-win, especially as smart home tech goes mainstream. Many of these were hits last Prime Day (smart thermostats have been gaining year-over-year momentum as more people ditch the old dial thermostats). *Tip:* Utility companies sometimes offer rebates on top of Prime Day prices – double-dip on those savings if you can!

* **Video Doorbells & Security Cams**  – Keeping an eye on the front porch has never been cooler. Searches for “doorbell cameras” have **steadily grown since 2015** and by now they’re a staple of Prime Day. Ring, Blink (both Amazon brands), Arlo and others usually get massive discounts. **Why trending?** Home delivery culture (gotta catch those porch pirates) and easy DIY security via smartphone. Plus, viral doorbell cam clips on social media show all the wild stuff happening on our porches – who wouldn’t want one? Year-over-year these remain best-sellers. *Deal tip:* If you’re in the Alexa ecosystem, look for bundle deals on Ring cameras or Echo Show + Ring combos. Google Nest cams also occasionally see price drops if you prefer Google Assistant.

* **Smart Lighting & LED Decor**  – From color-changing smart bulbs to the TikTok-famous LED strip lights, smart lighting is lighting up trends. (Remember the 2020 craze for “TikTok LED lights” that peaked as creators showed off glowy bedrooms? Those are now mainstream.) **Why trending?** Everyone wants to jazz up their space with mood lighting – whether it’s syncing lights to music or just vibey neon signs. Year over year, brands like Philips Hue, Govee, and Nanoleaf have remained popular, and new cheaper alternatives keep popping up. Prime Day often brings huge lighting deals (smart bulb 4-packs, LED strip kits, etc.). *Tip:* Smart light kits and multi-packs usually hit their lowest prices on Prime Day – perfect time to smartify your whole home in one go.

* **Kitchen Composters & Food Recyclers**  – Sustainability at home is trending in a big way. Countertop *food recycler* devices (basically kitchen composters like Lomi) have seen a **128% spike in popularity** recently! **Why trending?** People are looking to reduce waste and these gadgets turn food scraps into garden compost with the push of a button. This eco-trend wasn’t huge on Prime Days a few years back, but with growing interest in zero-waste lifestyles, 2025 could be the year these go on deep discount to reach more folks. *Deal tip:* These devices are pricey, so Prime Day is a prime time (heh 😜) to snag one. Also keep an eye on compostable bag refills or accessories being on sale too.

* **At-Home Coffee Gear**  – Miss your coffeehouse? A lot of us amped up our home coffee game. One example: milk frothers and steamers have **54% more interest this year** as people try to recreate café lattes at home. Espresso machines, cold brew makers, electric kettles – all are seeing steady buzz. **Why trending?** Ongoing work-from-home culture and endless Instagram/TikTok latte art videos mean everyone wants to be a home barista. These items have shown year-over-year growth (Nespresso on Prime Day, anyone?). *Deal tip:* Check for Prime Day bundles (espresso machine + milk frother combos, etc.) and consider slightly older models of fancy machines – they often drop to their lowest prices of the year.

# Prime Day Deal-Hunting Tips:

*  **Make a Wishlist & Watch** – Add these trending items to your Amazon Wishlist now. On Prime Day, Amazon sometimes **alerts you** if a Wishlist item goes on Lightning Deal. You can also “Watch” upcoming deals in the Amazon app so you don’t miss them.
*  **Set Deal Alerts** – Set up notifications on the Amazon app for keywords (like “robot vacuum” or “air purifier”). Also, tools like Keepa or CamelCamelCamel let you track price drops ahead of time, so you know if the Prime Day price is truly a good deal.
*  **Timing is Everything** – Some of the **best deals drop early** (even overnight). Lightning Deals can be 5-minute sell-outs for hot products. Pro tip: If it’s a Lightning Deal, set an alarm a few minutes before it starts and be ready to click *fast*. For longer-running deals, check back on Day 2 of Prime Day – sometimes they restock popular items or even add new deals.
*  **Leverage the Community** – Don’t hunt alone! Join our Prime Day discussion threads here on r/BestOfPrimeDay to share live updates. If you spot an amazing deal on one of these trending products, post about it – you’ll earn some good karma (and eternally grateful internet friends ).",4,1748463843.0,BestOfPrimeDay,1,1.0,False

1kxrbku,https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonSleep/comments/1kxrbku/an_indepth_look_at_darkrai_subskills/,An In-Depth Look at Darkrai Subskills,"So you're rolling Darkrai subskills, and you are wondering what should be considered ""good""?

WARNING: LONG POST. Lots of it is images though. You can scroll through looking at the titles and graphs and get most of the info

Let's look at individual subskills affect Darkrai's personal strength over the course of 24 hours with one 8 1/2 hour sleeping period. That means that in the analysis below, the benefit of gold subskills besides BFS/HB won't be considered, and HB will be undervalued. We'll try to give every specialty their full potential to shine.

**Assumptions**

We're going to assume that you are trying to make use of all parts of Darkrai's kit regardless of build. That means we don't want to sneaky snack, we will target recipes that use Darkrai's ingredients (and give the recipe boost accordingly), and we will not avoid Darkrai's skill despite it's energy drain effects.

For berries, level 65 will maximize strength. Notably I won't be assuming favored berry since the goal is to make Darkrai the best at everything and not just Snowdrop. I will have a separate analysis with favored berry though.   
  
For ingredients, I'll assume mono corn and and 3x max level Greengrass Salad. Mono corn would take a ton of Eureka seeds by itself, and I think I'll make another analysis just about Darkrai's ingredient slots. After some fiddling around, my hunch is that as long as you can use whatever ingredients in your recipes, the overall strength won't change too much based on spread. I'm going to assume mono here just so it's easier to find a recipe that uses it. I figure Greengrass Salad is consistently achievable in late game while providing the boost ingredients rely on to be competitive at that stage. I also wanted to minimize relying on other mons' build or how GCT would change things. In particular, Tasty Chance buffs are outside the scope of this analysis. Darkrai's ingredient counts are much lower than a full ingredient specialist, but Darkrai has other benefits and one ingredient specialist can never make a whole high-level recipe by themselves anyways. If you're swapping out other ingredient specialists as you meet the threshold for the recipe, then this analysis appropriately values Darkrai's ingredient strength.  
  
For skills, every Darkrai will be considered with max level skills unless noted otherwise. If you're spending all these biscuits, candies, and dream shards to max out Darkrai, you can probably scrape together 5 main seeds for it.  
  
I'll also run max healing which will boost the relative value of inventory by making it more likely to fill up overnight. This was done mostly so I don't have to estimate what a reasonable healer would be, and also because we're shooting for a theoretical maximum. As far as I know, Raenox assumes constant checking during the day and only uses inventory to determine when, if ever, sneaky snacking happens at night. In that sense inventory is usually under-estimated if you check rarely during the day. If I'm wrong please someone correct me.  
  
I'll do some limited analysis away from these assumptions, but that's our baseline. We're trying to make Darkrai the absolute best pokemon currently out there, even though this will be unachievable for months/years for even the most hardcore sleepers out there

**Level 65** **One-Subskill Boosts**

With the assumptions above, below is the strength breakdown for each subskill individually. I might try analyzing the effects of subskills in tandem later, but that sounds like a massive project that experienced players already have intuition about. It should behave like you're used to. For example, HSM + STM would multiply their respective boosts, while HSM + HSS just straight up add. Limited inventory complicates that a bit more, but this post is too long already without getting into that.

[Looking at the benefits of each subskill in isolation](https://preview.redd.it/8y7lhzcvmj3f1.png?width=1567&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c71d93d26ca1d697b12cd27c4fc7ea9071fb1cf)

[We can see that HSM unsurprisingly leads in personal strength. IFM is relying on that max-level recipe to score so highly.](https://preview.redd.it/8la7rmampj3f1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=23b95d7a36c2e54ecf7393a80fb22c3966a2ab71)

**In Favor of Berries (Favored Berry)**

Berry mons aren't recommended to run when their berry is not favored, so let's see how that changes things. To Snowdrop!

[Look at those green bars grow](https://preview.redd.it/0f9vizovrj3f1.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=32cfd7ff2c096a7c65b442cb8316716124177980)

[Berry substats are unsurprisingly awesome when favored. BFS and HSM smoke everything else](https://preview.redd.it/ggqotivbxj3f1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=86bfa417651059e1f179268d77ec8a3549a8dfd3)

**In Favor of Ingredients (Better Recipe)**

Greengrass Salads aren't the max dish out there, and there will be even better ones released in the future. What if we did mono coffee (Darkrai's highest ingredient strength choice) with 3x Defiant Salads (largest ingredient boost currently available)? Let's see the ingredient specialty of Darkrai shine!  
  
This assumes consistent pot expansion. A GCT would cover it, but GCT might change other relative weights that I don't want to think about right now. Let's just assume you're running it alongside a good pot mon. You also obviously need to be running it alongside mons capable of producing the rest of the recipe. That would include another coffee producer, since Darkrai's ingredient specialty isn't strong enough to pull that off alone even with IFM + HSM + IUL. You could swap out the other producers when not needed though. How strong that team would need to be is outside the scope of this analysis.   
  
Notably we're still not running alongside a Tasty Chance mon, which would make ingredients even better.

[If you add the recipe boosts endgame ingredient metas rely on, ingredients make up the majority of strength. Who would have guessed?](https://preview.redd.it/h9qy992rjj3f1.png?width=1565&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf4cf1ca9d3e086edd5a0894eb44065bdbe47ebd)

[HSM is still the clear winner, but IFM actually beats out BFS](https://preview.redd.it/akhvoksahj3f1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd58d0e08afe50a201e9475ebd4195a6bc5ff520)

**In Favor of Skills (lvl 25 analysis)**

Skill mons rely on their skill level much more than they do their actual level. Since we've been running max skill level this whole time, in order to favor them over berries/ingredients it seems fair to look at the comparison at level 25. This is useful anyways because it will be forever til people's Darkrai's even reach level 50. This actually doesn't hurt Darkrai's ingredients as much as I thought it would. He goes from getting 3 corn on average proc to only 2. Most players with a level 25 Darkrai aren't likely to be maxing Greengrass Salads though. I'll address that next

[Bye bye berry strength. You rely on higher levels to be significant in the face of a max level charge strength skills](https://preview.redd.it/8cubmbaavj3f1.png?width=1568&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1ecb3d65fb2345ad3f66bd4032393eef1355e9b)

[STM still not boosted as much as I thought. Inventory really boosted by that max energy overnight production](https://preview.redd.it/xkgbsw9lwj3f1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2d7ad34da6a1f2e484ae708a94b5ee671322c35)

**Level 25 Analysis (but cooking is hard)**

Let's say you're like me, and you're just past having ingredient mons at level 30. High level recipes might happen once every few Sundays, but mostly they're out of reach and definitely not max level. And, like most everyone else, you've ignored changing up Darkrai's starting sausage because 8 ingredients? Who the heck wants to touch *that* RNG? 

Let's do level 50 Ninja Curries this time instead. That's more reasonable at this level, right? We can't be *too* weak if we want our Darkrai to properly be an all-specialist. The sad thing is that Darkrai can't actually meet the 27 sausage requirement by itself at low levels with just one subskill unless it's IFS/IFM.

[Look at all that blue! Blue lovers win hard](https://preview.redd.it/fcuwmbqfzj3f1.png?width=1568&format=png&auto=webp&s=e437065342ed89acc591bb68c69922ea7e7054fc)

[Inventory is probably still being overweighted. We'll reexamine the infinite healing assumption eventually](https://preview.redd.it/cng1eedg0k3f1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a5dd9d2a03c242ca5cbe87fbbb7f52f58e6163a)

**Level 25 Analysis (no really I'm bad at cooking)**

Hahahahaha did I imply earlier that I had Ninja Curries at level 50 or that I could consistently cook them? I wish! Let's try again with level 30 Bulk Up Bean Curry. At least Darkrai can handle the sausage for that, so we really just need a decent bean ingredient finder to make it reliably. Lower recipes take more times cooked to grow in level though, so level 30 sounds like a good amateur cooking point. It would rise fairly steadily

[If you really dislike seeing the yellow, cook recipes that don't use Darkrai's ingredients. Suboptimal](https://preview.redd.it/c37pn46nak3f1.png?width=1571&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0a4d21f74d70ca68d72103e12e722f307750e76)

[I'm sorry ingredient finding subskills. You deserve a better owner than I.](https://preview.redd.it/m3fzh0qibk3f1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e21476b6c024b01003bb9252d6d4ca8cde7d62c)

**Level 25 Analysis (this time without skill levels)**

Same assumptions as the last, but this time we'll also assume you're not swimming in main skill seeds. Whether that's because you're f2p or because you're hesitant to invest in Darkrai when it's new and dauntingly costly, that doesn't matter.   
  
Let's go ahead and add in Skill Up S and Skill Up M as well. I think they get a bad rap from min-maxers because they don't just save you main skill seeds, they also skip month(s) of waiting if you don't already have a stock of seeds saved up. Not to mention the time savings when you have other mons you want to seed. On Darkrai in particular they can be used for an early boost and then rerolled later when you have more seeds accumulated.

[What's that I see? It's an ALL specialist!!!](https://preview.redd.it/fopr3vks5k3f1.png?width=1568&format=png&auto=webp&s=95c7ba416710855f1b01ea9c91f58006938b05a8)

[Darkrai's skill hugely benefits from levels. We also see that berries matter a lot more when the skill is weak](https://preview.redd.it/uws3ed1eik3f1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ae093b13201af38490d615812654fcf8650de26)

  
**Reassess Healing Assumption**

This whole time inventory has been fully taken advantage of because of max healing. Everything else has benefited too to a lesser degree. However, you probably don't have a triple trigger + HSM Gardevoir who can do that while fighting through Darkrai's energy drain.

Let's look at these comparisons again with no healing whatsoever besides the three meals a day. We'll start at level 25 no skill seeds Bulk Up Bean Curry and then jump back to the first level 65 one with max skill seeds and Greengrass Salads.

**Level 25 No-Healing, No-Seeds, 3x Bulk Up Bean Curry**

[You'll notice that IUS is enough to run the whole night, so IUM and IUL are excessive](https://preview.redd.it/ynvbrzknhk3f1.png?width=1568&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b9c0fa5d8957dad7cc5339f2db91a4a8433eab6)

[Inventory has basically no benefit all by itself with no healing](https://preview.redd.it/6nvqxgo4ik3f1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=d94131bfdb5a6beac7c93354fbe3833ed13ff10c)

**Level 65 No-Healing, Max-Seeds, 3x Max Level Greengrass Salads**

[This is a LOT less green than that first comparison. It was because inventory would always cap overnight and sneaky snack](https://preview.redd.it/juncpdbmjk3f1.png?width=1571&format=png&auto=webp&s=d680b2c570f02370455d0e5f61af423e6abac710)

[Inventory boosts help a little bit with the increased ingredients but not more than sleep ribbons would ](https://preview.redd.it/xfpd8iujkk3f1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8d32034da2940979a8e1178fc542a086a49fafd)

I was surprised to see BFS so low. After thinking about it more, Ingredients/skills usually cap overnight, and their day collection isn't too affected by no healing. No healing really hurts the overnight production which is when sneaky snacking happens here. 

Anyways, it's not optimal to run without a healer, so inventory isn't as useless as these last comparisons make it seem. Even though we don't have a dark type healer yet, you should force your healer to suffer through Darkrai procs.

**Level 65 Subskill Combination Analysis**

Back to initial assumptions, I'm going to play around with subskill combinations and show you ones I find work well for personal strength. I went ahead and did max sleep ribbons for inventory as well this time cause it'll take over a year to get that high anyways.

[These are all so much stronger than other Pokemon](https://preview.redd.it/r5x8jucvqk3f1.png?width=1573&format=png&auto=webp&s=35a544a30da92d2e7292e3049cfb6764d8a6c424)

* Like we've already seen above, HSM is the single biggest contributor to overall strength. It helps then that you can use a subskill to upgrade HSS to it. Playing around I could replace it with HB but the personal strength dropped by several thousand (team strength would overall probably rise though). 
* Any time you see HB, you can replace it with HSS for a little increase in personal strength like from the second to the third box. 
* BFS wasn't actually that overwhelming without favored berry, although BFS+HSM+??? were still the highest scorers
* IFM did surprisingly well with the max recipe boost. Like all ingredient mon though, they underperform if your recipe levels aren't good
* With current max of good sleep ribbons, the time it took to cap the inventory ranged from 2:59:43 (BFS+HSM+HSS) to 6:47:37 (HSM+IUL+STM). Those times would decrease if a larger quantity ingredient  like apples were rolled instead

**Level 65 Favored Berry + 3x Defiant Salads** cause why not?

[Snowdrop M20 is a walk in the park](https://preview.redd.it/pxx0s9qsxk3f1.png?width=1569&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d7f6ed6cc2459220719ac21bf1ae02fa47ca756)

**Subskills Honorable Mention**

1. HB is better than shown here. This analysis was purely on personal strength for Darkrai, but you actually have 4 other mon in play. They could also have HB to boost your Darkrai even further!
2. As mentioned earlier, SUM and SUS are great starting subskills unless you have a surfeit of main skill seeds. Darkrai's skill gives a lot of strength. You can reroll them later if you want

For years I avoided smiling in photos. Not super noticeably, but always with closed lips or turning slightly away. I drink coffee, I’m not a smoker, but my teeth just always looked a little dull — not awful, but not great either.

I’d always thought teeth whitening was for influencers or people with hyper-curated lives, not regular people like me who just want to feel a little fresher.

Anyway, I finally booked an appointment. It was surprisingly chill — no pain, no weird sensitivity afterwards, and it only took about 1,5 hours. I went to **Tribeca Dental Studio** (NYC folks, if you're curious), and honestly what I appreciated most was how *non-salesy* and low-pressure the whole thing felt. They just walked me through it like a normal part of care — which it kind of is, I guess.

Since then, I’ve found myself smiling more in mirrors, selfies, and just generally feeling a little lighter. It reminded me of what it felt like the first time I found a skincare routine that actually worked — not a huge transformation, just something that made me feel more like me.

If you’ve ever been curious about whitening but assumed it was only for certain types of people — consider this your sign. It doesn’t have to be dramatic or “Hollywood.” Just clean and refreshed. Like a skincare glow, but for your smile.",8,1748463427.0,beauty,2,0.79,False

I was tired for two days but following those two days I never felt the tranquility and the focus I had while I had 0 caffeine in me .I was more aware of my surroundings ,I could see better . I could hear better and sense things around me more than I usually would . 

My thoughts weren’t all over the the place . Racing thoughts were almost gone . I could focus on one thing a time  …My anxiety and heart palpitations were vanished almost . Mood swings pretty much were gone .

I gave in and I had coffee for the past  3 days . Suddenly I’m more anxious and have racing thoughts all over again . I can’t relax . I have a headache now that I’m drinking coffee again . My sleep has been crappy since I started having caffeine again ..


It’s time to come off this vicious drug for good . I’ve quit alcohol ,nicotine ,opiates and smoking but I cannot give this crap up . It always lures back into my life . It’s going to take quite sometime to heal from caffeine addiction . Most of us just give in and get tempted with it since it’s everywhere .

1kxr8xe,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1kxr8xe/does_icepure_cto10_water_filter_truly_enhance/,Does ICEPURE CTO10 Water Filter Truly Enhance Water Quality? Detailed Review,"**Durability and Build Quality**  
The ICEPURE CTO10 Whole House Water Filter caught my attention with its impressive NSF/ANSI 42 certification. This certification means it’s been tested to significantly reduce chlorine odor and taste, which is crucial for anyone who just can't stand tap water tasting like a poorly maintained pool. In my experience, the filter is crafted with durable carbon material that feels high-quality. It’s designed with precision, fitting perfectly into any standard 10” x 2.5” filtration system without any awkward maneuvering or forcing parts into place. I’ve installed it on my kitchen’s filtration system, and the solid construction gives me confidence in its longevity.

**Ease of Installation and Compatibility**  
What really surprised me was how straightforward it was to install. I’m no handyman, considering my toolkit is mostly screwdrivers and duct tape, but I managed to get the filter set up in less than 15 minutes. The product is compatible with a wide range of models: DuPont, Whirlpool, GE, Culligan, and several others, so if you’re someone swapping out your older filters, chances are it’ll fit. I appreciated that it worked seamlessly with my DuPont WFPFC9001 system.

**[Check ICEPURE CTO10 Water Filter price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b084dpjw37/)**

**Effective Filtration Performance**  
I ran multiple water tests over a few weeks to see if the ICEPURE CTO10 did as it claimed. Let me just say, the chlorine odor reduction was noticeable almost immediately, and the water had a clean taste that’s hard to describe unless you’ve suffered through metallic-tasting tap water most of your life. The Sintering Technology used in the cartridge honestly impressed me, as it’s capable of filtering fine particles and sediment. My neighbor, who uses municipal water with a good amount of silt, mentioned she saw a dramatic improvement in her water clarity when using this filter.

**Highlights**  
- Reduces up to 99% of chlorine taste and odor.  
- Compatible with multiple filtration system brands.  
- Durable carbon material certified BPA-free.  

**Potential Downsides**  
That’s not to say everything is flawless. From my experience, the filter may clog more quickly if you’re using it for well water with lots of heavy sediments like mud or sand. A few people in my local DIY group echoed this sentiment, mentioning they had to replace their filter earlier than expected. While the claimed lifespan is 13,000 gallons or about six months, this heavily depends on the quality of your water. For those with high sediment content, pre-filters might be a good idea.  

- Lower efficiency with well-water sources full of larger particles.  
- Lifespan heavily dependent on local water quality.  

**Target Users**  
This filter thrives in households that rely on municipal water systems or water with manageable levels of impurities. The 1-micron filtration capability ensures you’re getting cleaner water for drinking, cooking, and even showering. It’s not ideal for severe well-water conditions, so keep that in mind. Families prioritizing cleaner, better-tasting water without powerful chemical flavors would definitely benefit from this. My family noticed an immediate improvement in how coffee tastes—we’re all caffeine addicts here, so that mattered!

**Alternative Offerings**  
Comparing the ICEPURE CTO10 filter to offerings from other brands like Pentek or Aquaboon, it holds its ground firmly. These competitors provide similar filtration capacities; however, ICEPURE’s compatibility range is something I value highly. I previously used a Pentek CBC-10, which worked fine, but it wasn’t nearly as easy to set up, plus the chlorine reduction wasn’t as pronounced. Aquaboon filters, though affordable, often feel less sturdy in build quality. Between the three, in terms of balance between performance and robustness, the ICEPURE CTO10 feels distinctively reliable.  

**Affordable Quality**  
While precise pricing fluctuates, I’d classify this filter as firmly within the affordable yet high-quality range. There’s significant value here compared to pricier competitors like Whirlpool filters. Despite its cost-efficient price tag, there’s no shortcut in quality—a rare balance to find. Swapping your filter every six months strikes as practical, and the pack of four makes it a manageable investment for most homes.

1kxr8k5,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouCanNeverEscape/comments/1kxr8k5/we_lost_another_one/,We Lost Another One,"Angelo had been trying to get clean a couple years but he kept relapsing around the holidays.  One year after a particularly drunken Thanksgiving incident his family had enough.  While nobody died, it had been too much for them all after he pointed a shotgun into the turkey and blew it up.

After the doctors picked shrapnel out  of them all, Angelo was sent to the part of the hospital where nobody leaves.  From there he was directly taken to rehab, the asylum kind where nobodies allowed to leave ever.

Upon intake, the check-in nurse told Angelo the story of the Bride in White, explaining it was a ghost people are rumored to see at the asylum.  One that was likely best explained as a detox apparition. 

Angelo noticed the intake nurse was herself dressed in all white. He stared at her thin, stringy hair and noticed she seemed quite sickly and ghastly like a ghost.  Her flesh as pale as her frock, Angelo shoved the thoughts of her out of his mind. 

He was a true skeptic on such matters as ghost.  It was the sedative he thought to himself as he moved into main lobby.

He payed no mind to anyone in the main lobby. Instead he did like everyone else. He got his coffee and slumped into one of the customary lobby chair. It was the kind of chair given to paint the illusion you are home and not in an institution.  Suddenly a hand slide down chair.  

“They call me The Preacher,” said a tall, many with dirty hair like he had tossed in bed for hours.  “Listen,” he said as he leaned down to whisper in Angelo’s ear, “she told you about the Bride in White? That you’re your gonna see the bride”.

Angelo could smell his breath, it had the stench of cigarette and sulphur.  His teeth were rotten from meth. The Preacher followed Angelo down the hallway his clubbed foot dragging. 

Angelo sighed in relief as he ditched The Preacher.  He threw his coat on the customary chair in his bedroom and flopped onto the bed.   The withdraws were hitting him. 

He woke up several hours into the night, the blood of his shrapnel wounds crusted to the bed. He picked himself apart from the be.  He needed  to pee all the coffee he’d had during check-in.  While at the urinal Angelo  heard someone rummaging on the handle into his bedroom suite.  

‘Oh no, not a roommate,” he said as he opened the door but it was the admission’s nurse. She now lumbered over him looking terribly long and lanky, thinly lurching over him.  

“I brought you some fresh towels from linens;” she said with her hands out, “for the matrimony.”

His eyes were cast downward. His heart raced at her perfectly black nails which were a sharp, pointed contrast to the white pallor uniform.  

Angelo stumbled back as if he’d seen a ghost. 

“Oh crap you already saw the Bride in White,” she laughed tauntingly.   The door on its hinges snapped back on his face.  


She craned around laughing as she faded down the hallway like a wait.  A light above her head was flashing like a pale lighthouse beacon. Angelo shook it off as being half-asleep.

When Angelo woke up the next morning, he was turned on his side and there was a woman behind him. He could feel her soft rags and chiffons. The light touch of her hands was healing and made Angelo feel as if he was floating in a womb. 

""I’ll take care of you,"" she said in hushed whispers in his ear, patting his back, “I'll rip away your pain. All you have to do is come away with me."" 

Angelo turned to his side to see what kind of mental patient had entered his room unannounced, maybe some chick in mania, he thought.

""Who are you,"" Angelo asked grasping her hands but they slipped away. 

At that moment, Angelo saw his floor covered in black ink, black puddles leaking.  A strong suction was over him and he turned to look at the ceilling and a giant snake was inhaling into a tomb  of ink.  Angelo swam in it, trying to find the edge to stick his fist through the flesh to the other side.  

""Angelo, it's time for breakfast,"" said the room system intercom in his bedroom.  ""Paging room 29a, you are late for check in.""

The water inside the womb rippled, drowning him. Angelo screamed.

""Somebody saw the Bride in White,"" said  a psych warden rolling Angelo over, staring down at Angelo thrashing in his own sweat on the floor.

Angelo was lifted and wheeled down the hall in a wheelchair to morning cafe.  

""You sure had a rough night,"" said a young female slamming her food tray on the table.  She rolled him over by her up, pushing him into the empty spot of the table. 

She grabbed his hand, ""this is our honeymoon, baby.  This is the end. This is love, “ she declared smacking a kiss on his cheek. 

Angelo looked at her realizing she was wearing all-white, her hand wrapped tightly around his. ""Why,"" Angelo said weakly.  

She ran her hand further down his thigh pinching it. “M-a-t-r-i-m-o-n-y;” she spelled out.  Her other hand moved over his neck, clamping it like a vice. “You will ride my snake with me,"" she said, ""we will fly hand-in-hand."" 

Angelo could feel the snake's repetillian structure suddenly wrap around his neck, crushing him over his middle. His heart racing like a machine gun firing.

""Why,""  he asked the specter, gasping for air as the snake coiled tighter, crushing him. But he was suddenly riding waves of air, grasping the huge snakes neck as they rode into the unknown abyss. Angelo grasp the snake between his thigh and his Bride behind him. 

""Because you are the Wizard,"" she answered back as they flew over the air. 
Angelo held his hand out collecting tiny gold flecks from the the air to hand her one. 

The snake whipped through the air in slithering jerks.  Their hair flew behind them.  The long snake was seven miles long with cool skin and heading them into space.  Angelo ran his hands down the snake's flesh, feeling the bumps and ridges and relaxed into the snake's cold flow.

""Cardiac,"" said an emergency tech into his handheld as he leaned into listening to the stethoscope.  ""Patient 29a needs a defibrillator - appears we lost another one. ""
