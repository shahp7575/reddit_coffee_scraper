I've been trying dating again after some time away and I've been really struggling with getting this aspect of me across, especially on a dating profile. 

I'm like stereotypical INFP when it comes to emotional sensitivity but also quite slow to judge, feel a deep empathy with others and spend a lot of reflecting on my emotions to process them more deeply. That being said writing stuff like that makes it feel really insincere and feels like I'm just trying to make myself seem so deep and emotional because I think that's what people are looking for. Like writing that even in a reddit post about myself felt horrible because it felt like I was trying to self congratulate myself for feeling empathy which just feels like total ""nice guy"" behaviour. Idk man.

I know this kind of sucks as a question but how do you think would be a good way to get this across? Basically all I do at the moment is just say I enjoy nature walks and coffee shops but honestly that's so indirect to the point where it's got nothing to do with what I was originally trying to say.

Last year my 5 year old kid was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer (DMG). Since then countless people have approached me with something along the lines of “If you need anything just tell me, I am here for you”.

I have told them what we need: to have other people by our side, spending time with us. Helping us create small joyful memories and providing emotional support. And I have asked for it clearly, repeatedly. It doesn’t have to be a lot of time, 30-60 minutes already means the world to us. Whether it’s for a short coffee, to play a bit with my son or just offer a listening ear. I don’t expect people to sacrifice themselves for us, I am aware that everyone is going through their own shit… and I am aware how deeply sad and difficult it is to be around a 5 year old who is deteriorating and nearing death day by day. But still, I wonder, am I asking for too much? 

If all the people who told me “If you need anything just ask” would show up just one hour every two weeks, it would make such a huge difference, both for me and my son. But they don’t. 

The truth is, me and my son are in this huge pile of suffering that people are trying to avoid. And this hurts so much. Fuck cancer. 

Also “you are not alone in this” is a complete lie. I am very much alone, trying to do every thing, every day, at the same time: being there for my son, struggling to keep my shit together, hugging myself and finding strength to move forward, going from hospital to hospital, doing my best not to lose my job,  trying to enjoy what’s left of my son… and the people who say “you are not alone in this” cannot even begin to imagine what that is like.

Last week, I handed over the reins of my life to a computer. Let’s just say it was a week of existential crises, unexpected efficiency, and my mom being 110% done with me. Let me walk you through my emotional rollercoaster—and I want to know: would YOU let a computer manage your life?

**Day 1:**

Woke up angry because I forgot to buy my favorite cereal (classic Monday). But then... **ding-dong**. A delivery guy stands there holding my holy grail of crunchy happiness. My computer had ordered it. Along with coffee, milk, and *fruits?* Like, what’s next? Finding me a soulmate?

**Day 2:**

Had a dinner plan with my mom. Morning argument happened (don’t ask, but she brought up my life choices again). I wasn’t feeling the whole “let’s pretend everything is fine over lasagna” vibe. My computer took the liberty of notifying her with a message that was too polite to be mine.  
Fast forward to dinner time—she shows up anyway, fuming. Computer calmly announces from the doorbell camera: **""You shall not pass.""**  
I thought I was about to be disowned, but turns out my mom has a dark sense of humor. We ended up laughing about it (after she made me promise to never do it again).

**Day 3:**

Had a meeting that screamed, “This could’ve been an email.” The computer agreed. It sent out a summary of the key points *before the meeting even started*. Then it RSVP’d on my behalf: *""Not attending. Please read the email instead.""*  
I have never felt so liberated.

**Day 4:**

Texted my friend about gaming that evening. He didn’t reply fast enough, so my computer handled it.

* Confirmed the plan.

* Agreed on a game we both love.

* Prepared the game.

* Reminded me to grab snacks. It practically sat me down in front of my desk at 8 PM sharp like a coach hyping me up for a championship match.

**Day 5:**

Family dinner. You know, *that* type of family dinner where you start mentally drafting your autobiography titled *""Please Stop Asking When I’ll Settle Down.""*  
My computer saved me by faking an urgent notification. *""You need to walk 500 steps now!""* I escaped, did an awkward circle around the block, and came back to dessert like nothing happened.

**Day 6:**

Friend’s birthday party was coming up. I had no idea what to get him, but my computer casually DM’d his AI (yes, apparently his AI exists). They had a whole AI-to-AI convo, ranked the best gift options, and even handled the order. I’m now the proud owner of “Best Gift Giver” status.

**Day 7:**

I told the computer at the start: “Make me successful. Analyze my strengths and just... do your thing.”  
It went full Tony Robbins meets *Just Do It*. By the end of the week, I was:

* Hitting my goals at work.

* Actually being productive without feeling like garbage.

* Meeting new people without awkwardly standing in a corner like a plant.

I swear, it’s like the computer *knew* me better than I knew myself.

Bonus: Remember that episode of *The Big Bang Theory* where Sheldon lets the dice make his decisions? My computer was like, “Hold my algorithms.” I handed it all my life goals, and it’s like, “Got it, chief.” Instead of yelling at me to hustle, it quietly nudged me toward the stuff I actually care about.

**Would you let a computer manage your life?**

I’m torn. On one hand, it was life-changing. On the other, my mom is never forgiving the Gandalf doorbell moment.

Would you let a computer handle your life? What’s the *worst* that could happen? Share your wildest scenarios below—let’s brainstorm how chaotic this could get. 👀",0,1736718909.0,learnmachinelearning,0,0.25,False
1hzy2xb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Greyhounds/comments/1hzy2xb/two_sets_of_crazy_people_in_one_day/,Two sets of crazy people in one day!,"Today, taking advantage of the sunshine and mild weather i decided to take Lucy to a different park we havent been before.  Its a rugby field complex and dogs are fully allowed on-lead around the edges.  It has a little stream and lots of hedges for good sniffiy bimbling.

Lucy was trotting away happily next to me, on lead, not being a bother at all and super well behaved and calm as usual, when a younger woman with 2 kids having a picnic about 50 metres away gets up, screams at the top of her voice ""GET YOUR \*\*\*\*ING DOBERMAN AWAY FROM ME AND MY KIDS""

I was in shock a bit and looked around to see if there was someone else around, but nope, she was screaming at us!

as we walked past her around the perimeter (she was in the middle of the field) she kept screaming the same sort of things at me - Lucy, bless her, was completely unbothered and more interested in smelling every blade of grass.

After that, i fancied a Starbucks (and PupCup for Lucy) on the way back.  We went in, big queue - one coffee machine out of order.  Lucy knows starbucks and knows somehting tasty arrives for her at the end.  She always waits perfectly well in the queue - not bothering anyone, just stands quiet next to me.  We go about once a week for our treats so most of the staff know us a bit now.

As we got nearer the end waiting for our goodies, this older woman squeezes past us, bumps into Lucy - who just looked at this woman who dared bump into her bum - and she proceeds to ask me to take my large agressive dog out of the shop!

Lucily both the barista at the till, and the nice young couple next to me in the queue said she is perfectly behaved and isnt being a bother to anyone - angry woman shuffles off and shoots daggers at us the whole time we were waiting!",5,1736718843.0,Greyhounds,1,1.0,False
1hzy2vm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/comments/1hzy2vm/m4f30_seeking_an_advancedliterate_writing_partner/,[M4F][30+] Seeking an Advanced/Literate Writing Partner for Long-Term Stories and Collaboration,"**Wow. So much has changed...**

Long story short, I got my start in roleplaying back during the golden age of AOL and Yahoo (anyone else remember the Red Dragon Inn back in the late 90s and early 2000s?). Ah, those were the days, right? When the biggest worry was your dial-up connection, haha.

As I'm sure you'd all agree—finding long-term, advanced/literate writers is much more challenging these days. I have fond memories of when the process of coming up with a plot was an organic process; where you'd genuinely take the time to get to know the other person, build rapport, and allow a plot to form naturally.

That's what I'm hoping to find. With that said, I put a lot of effort into this post, so hopefully there's someone else out there who values the same things in a writing partner!

**First of all, here's a bit about me as a person:**

* I'm 30+, male, and I've written several novels and a bunch of articles, mostly in historical fiction and contemporary stories. Writing isn't just my job; it's pretty much a part of who I am.
* I'm always trying to learn something new, whether it's from books, documentaries, or just good old chatting. History and cultures fascinate me the most.
* When I'm not buried in books or work, I love to hike and take photos. There’s something about being out in nature that just clears my head.
* I love to read (especially non-fiction and historical fiction). I'm always down for swapping book recommendations, if you're also a reader!
* I love peanut butter (crunchy over smooth any day – fight me).
* On that note, if I'm being honest, coffee isn't just a drink for me; it's a ritual!
* I'm a big fan of the simple things in life. Give me a sunset, a good laugh, or a perfect slice of pizza, and I’m set.
* I love diving into those deep, meandering conversations that start with ""what if"" and end somewhere between ""the meaning of life"" and ""why can’t we tickle ourselves?""
* Fun fact: I used to be able to recite all 50 states in alphabetical order — a party trick born out of a grade school challenge, haha.

**Here's what I'm looking for in a writer:**

* ***Writing Style -*** I'm looking for a partner who has a strong command of the English language. I'm talking about descriptive passages that paint clear pictures, dialogue that is crisp, concise, and not overly flowery. I prefer to write in the 3rd person, past tense. I prefer modern fiction and historical fiction stories.
* ***Communication -***  Life's unpredictable! What’s important is keeping each other in the loop about our schedules and any changes in the story or our approach. A quick heads-up can make a huge difference. It's all about being honest and direct with our feedback and thoughts.
* ***Long-Term Plots -*** I'm really looking for a writing partner who's in it for the long haul and is passionate about crafting intricate, plot-driven stories. For me, the joy of roleplaying lies in developing a story that evolves over time, with twists and turns that keep us both engaged and inspired.
* ***Sense of Humor -*** Writing together should be fun and relaxed, not just a serious crafting of narratives. It’s important to me that we can both throw in a bit of humor now and then, not only in our stories but in our interactions too.

And there you have it! If you're a detail-oriented, communicative, mature, and long-term story lover, you might just be the writing partner I'm looking for.

So, after months of lurking (and a handful of half-written posts), I'm finally taking the plunge and giving this another shot. I know they say the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, but in my case, it begins with a second post. So, here goes nothing, right? Haha.

**What am I looking for?**

In a nutshell—authentic, meaningful conversation. A while ago, a few other faculty members and I met up for an evening out to celebrate the holidays. A few of us stayed pretty late, pontificating about life, talking about the most random topics, and basically just enjoying each other's company. I don't know about you, but in today's world (where so many of us are glued to Zoom screens and remote work), we need more of that sort of dynamic—just genuine, authentic, long-form discourse. I like to believe with the right sort of person (and the right sort of conversational skills), you can cultivate that sort of vibe in online conversation.

For example, when I think back to the past, one of my favorite memories was a lengthy conversation I had with a random stranger at a cozy little coffee shop in a small town in Upstate New York. We talked about everything from philosophy to the best type of coffee beans. That's the sort of conversation I crave!

**A bit about me:**

* I'm 34, male, and teach in higher education.
* I finished my doctorate a few years ago (Finally! I can now add ""doctor"" to my name without having to prescribe anything or perform surgery, haha — although that dissertation was brutal, just sayin').
* I love the outdoors and often take local day trips to explore new trails and scenic spots.
* I have a passion for photography, always trying to capture that perfect shot.
* Journaling and poetry are my ways of reflecting and expressing my thoughts, even if my poems often end up sounding like Dr. Seuss after too much coffee.
* Long hikes are my therapy. Nature has a way of putting things into perspective.
* I have a knack for making terrible puns. Consider yourself warned.
* I like to pretend I'm a trivia night enthusiast, though my knowledge of obscure 90s cartoons is more impressive than practical.
* I'm convinced that breakfast foods are acceptable at any time of the day. Pancakes for dinner, anyone?
* I’ve been known to binge-watch documentaries about anything from space exploration to ancient civilizations.
* I’m a coffee enthusiast and love experimenting with different brewing methods and beans.
* I’m secretly training for the “Olympics of Procrastination,” and I’m a gold medal contender.
* I pride myself on my ability to parallel park in one go – a skill I wish I could add to my résumé.
* My superpower is finding the perfect GIF for any situation.

**So basically...**

I'm hoping to find thoughtful interactions with folks who genuinely want to discuss all that life has to offer. I'm drawn to people with a natural zest and curiosity for life, who embrace a growth mindset, and who value emotional intelligence and strong communication skills. If this sounds like you, send me a chat message! I'm looking forward to hearing from you!",2,1736718758.0,penpalsover30,0,1.0,False
1hzy1p5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1hzy1p5/crushed_by_my_crush/,Crushed by my crush ,"I’ve been pinning over my friend and coworker for almost a year. It started as a crush, grew into a strong friendship, and I let the crush fizzle out over the summer because I was satisfied with the friendship. He dates around a lot and I know I didn’t want to be involved with him hay way if I had to share him. 
I took the time to work on myself, lost a bunch of weight, started to dress better, etc. we still have had the same friendship the whole time. 
We’ve spent a whole lot of time together since October, and he has had a lot of commentary saying I look good. We have always had an affectionate friendship, we cuddle when we watch movies together, and have had sleepovers (one of us on the couch, one of us in our own beds) and we go on weekend trips together sometimes with our dogs. (Sometimes with friends, sometimes just us two)  we joke that we are like an old married couple. 
As awful of a cliche as this is, we made out after the staff Christmas party at his apartment. It was fun because it was a bit naughty and we both knew it was a bad idea, but it didn’t go further. He was teasing me, but I kissed him. 
Then for two weeks he went away. I know he wasn’t going on dates because he doesn’t do it when he is out of town. He comes back to spend new years with me and my friends and one of my coworkers. I didn’t anticipate a midnight kiss because I didn’t want to start anything in front of our coworker. We had a great time at the party, we all go out to the bar, and he winds up making out with a random girl at the bar. I’m heart broken, but I don’t want to show it. On our way home he apologizes and says he shouldn’t have done that, and we bicker, but I tell him that I want us to have better boundaries so I don’t get hurt. I tell him I don’t want to hear about dates he goes on, and we should not be flirty with one another. He agrees. New Year’s Day we drive up with our mutual friend to a vacation house for the week like we had planned. I almost backed out of the trip after NYE, but I didn’t want to screw over the other friend. 
We have a really great time out at the vacation house. Have really good conversations while we’re there, and I feel like my heart is healing a bit. We are cuddly on the couch, but it feels back to our normal selves, he falls asleep on me with the dogs, and I’m reading my book. Other friend goes up to bed around 11 pm. 

For a while I lay down next to him because I’m cold, and snooze a bit. He gets up at around midnight, turns off the lights, and tells me to stay, and wraps his arms around me. It feels so nice, but I know it’s a bad idea.  He falls back asleep, but then at around 1:30 my brain is swirling and I get up to go to my own bed. I also realized I got my period at that moment. 

At 6 am he comes into my room and climbs into bed with me. (Not in a creepy way, I kept the door open and he usually brings me coffee in the morning and we play with the dogs in my room. ) he cuddles up close to me and asks my why I left. I told him I needed sleep, that I got my period, and that we probably shouldn’t cuddle. I also admit that I like it too much when we do because he is so warm and he has nice strong hands. He proceeds to run his hands all over my body. Again, I really like this, but I’m afraid of getting hurt.  He jokes about us crossing too many lines. I tell him that we have to be careful because I don’t want to do casual with him. We snuggle there lazily for a bit, but then he starts kissing my neck. I say fuck it and turn to make out with him. It is really fun,(he also brushed his teeth before coming into my room???) and is handsy. I tell him that I like what he’s doing but I don’t want to have sex. He said that people can still have sex on their period and he doesn’t mind, but I told him I won’t have sex with him until he gets a clear STI panel because I know he’s been sleeping around. We still have fun,he’s  kissing my boobs, my hip bones, everywhere. It’s getting to be too intense so he goes and jumps in the shower. All morning as we’re packing up the house he keeps sneaking in to kiss me or tease me whenever we’re not with the other friend. 
We travel back home, drop the friend off, and have a brief conversation when he’s dropping me off at my house. I told him that I really enjoyed our morning, but that 1. I’m not interested in casual hooking up and 2. I want him to get a sti exam, if not for me for his own good. 
We see each other the next day because we already had plans. Another friend came to stay out my at my apartment, but they were out and about so they weren’t home. At one point we’re back in my apartment just talking in general, and I straddle him on the couch and ask what he thinking about. I can feel he has a boner and I tease him a bit. He says this is a bad idea, but he is running his hands on my torso. I ask him if we can talk about what happened, but he’s starting to be awkward. I ask him if he thinks we would be good together, but he says no, tells me that I don’t want to be with him because he probably won’t settle down and that he goes out and breaks girls hearts on hinge dates and that I don’t want to be a part of that. I start to get annoyed as he has no right to tell me what I want or not. Also this man constantly tells me that he wants to be married one day. We only have this conversation for about 5 minutes because my friend ends up coming back to the apartment. They didn’t walk in on us, but when my crush hears them at the door he launched me off of him so fast. 

It’s been a week since this happened, and I’m still so hurt. I know he doesn’t want me or see a relationship with me, but I’m so sad that he’d be willing to climb into bed with me and cross the line because he was bored and horny. At least that’s how I’m interpreting it. Part of me wants to say fuck it and just try casual because I liked the way it feels to be held and touched and kissed, and I figure since I’m already hurt anyhow, how much worse can I feel? I know that’s messed up too, but my heart is so confused. I don’t know how to go backwards in the relationship, and our lives are so interwoven at this point.

1hzxzco,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1hzxzco/roaster_for_beginner/,Roaster for beginner,"With a number of the widely available roasted beans we had been buying in stores being discontinued or not always available and local coffee shops/roasters not carrying what we like, I'm looking to start roasting at home. Having been a longtime homebrewer, I can appreciate starting small with a popcorn popper or HGBM setup, but I honestly think I'd rather get a more automated roaster to work with just a few beans/roasts that suit our needs. I couldn't tell you the bean amount, but we'll fill to the 8-cup mark on the Moccamaster every morning (about 28 oz).  The other thing is, we're **dark roast** drinkers, so whatever I get, I'd rather it be suited to darker roasting.  A few of the machines that I've looked at: 

* Freshroast SR800
* Behmor2000
* Gene Cafe
* Sandbox R1
* Kaffelogic Nano 7
* Skywalker (V1?)

Are ones better suited to dark roasts? I thought I read somewhere on Reddit that the Behmor is better for light/med.  I'm willing to spend a little money if I need to, as coffee really is a daily pleasure.  Just looking at getting fairly consistent results with not a whole lot of effort or mess.  Pros and cons for any that have used the above? Any other roasters I should consider?",1,1736718584.0,roasting,0,1.0,False

My soon to be husband and I will be moving out of North Carolina in the next six months to either Washington or Colorado, with a minimum journey of about 1700 miles.

That being said I’m starting to make a list since decluttering will be quite a task. As I make my list I can’t help but wonder- donate or keep utensils? Sell or keep rugs? Sell or keep books?

I am a bipedal neurodivergent mammal with a penchant for putting pen to paper. I wouldn't call it writing *per se;* it's more like chicken-scratching onto the side of a brick wall, but other times the words bubble up like the fat from a slab of popping bacon over a cast iron skillet.  
   If you want more specifics, I'm currently twenty-three years old and male on this bluish-green marble that is currently hurtling through the wilds of spacetime, and boy, isn't that just delightful?   
   I have plethora of interests. My reading choices can range anywhere from Winnie the Pooh to the works of Steven King. I relish productive thinking and am a creature of habit and learning, though sometimes my mind scatters to the four winds. I believe there's always an occasion for a bowtie, I have a large book on flags, and I often watch classic *Doctor Who* with herbal tea (drinking coffee is like throwing a lit match on a mattress, soaked in paint thinner, in Arizona under a dry spell). I find foxes and octopuses neat, my favorite tree is the American Beech (*fagus grandifolia*), and I think that we should be all the kinder to ourselves and to each other.   
   I don't get out much, often with little outside stimulation, mostly due to my introverted nature, so any letter that can transport me somewhere is always refreshing. I can chat, gab, argue, speak highfalutin, speak lowfalutin, or talk about the weather. Just about anything interests me so long as it's in earnest and is worth scribbling onto paper. While I'm at it, I should mention that I'm interested in making long-term friends and more (so long as they can tolerate my insanity). Anyhoo, this intro has stretched on quite a bit, hasn't it? I look forward to our adventure together. All the best, cheers.

After seeing all of these stories from reddit on tiktok. I know it’s unbelievable but I don’t care. It’s a truth, read it as a story if you’d like. 

When I was 18 I met my GF Kathrine. She was my age, met her at Uni loved her from the second I saw her. Fuck I fell hard for her. I got 18 fucking amazing months with her from 2012 - 2014. She died in a car crash, dead at the scene. I felt like I died with her, I wanted to die with her but I knew she’d be furious with me. First 2 years were the worst years of my life, I sat by her grave pretty much every day. Lost myself to alcohol. Firm believer grief doesn’t lessen with time you just grow used to it. 

Didn’t get to visit her grave for about 2 years since I moved to NY to get my shit sorted out. When I moved back I’d visit her 2x a week. And I noticed I always saw the same woman there at a grave about ten or so away from Kat’s. Sometimes she’d be crying, sometimes she’d sit there, sometimes she’d go on her phone, sometimes she had a bottle of wine. But she was there a lot. After abt 6 months we left around the same time and I figured I’d offer my condolences, she said she noticed me as well. She was grieving her boyfriend who’d drowned while sailing. I told her about Kathrine. That was that. But for another 4 months I’d still see her around, we always left the same time so we’d make small talk. Eventually I asked her for a coffee (genuinely not romantically) and then, for the next year and a half we were friends. She was the only person who knew my grief, who struggled as I did. It was never more than friendship between us. No one was ready for more. And 2 years into our friendship, something changed and I fell in love with her. It didn’t mean I didn’t love Kat, I do I always will. But somehow my grief cleared just enough to let me love Leila as well. I told her straight up, no bullshit and yeah she felt the same. Started dating her in early 2020. Ended up quarantining with her. We’re getting married in a week. I visit Kat about every 2 weeks now. I miss her, always will. But I think she’d want me to love again, she was that type of woman. Some people might hate this story, it’s anything but romantic but it’s what happened.

He doesn’t yell unless kid is about to hurt himself or break something (he was about to leap off the couch into the coffee table earlier today), but I feel like every correction or instruction comes from a place of anger. What really pissed me off just now was that my husband stunned his toe. We were trying to let kiddo practice on the toilet (he’s 19 months, just curious so far, but he likes to sit in the toilet without a diaper sometimes). Kiddo wanted Dad to take his pants off, Dad said no, ask Mom cause his toe hurting apparently prevented him from bending down and taking pants off. Kiddo starts crying cause Dad sounded angry and he doesn’t want me to take his pants off, he wants Dad. Fine, let’s just go start nap time cause this isn’t going anywhere. We get into kiddos floor bed with him to play for 10 minutes before Dad leaves and I lay with kiddo (this is our usual routine). Except Dad has an attitude the entire time. Kiddo went to “oink” Dad’s nose cause he and I were just doing that to each other. He aims bad and almost gets Dad in the eye, so Dad very angrily and loudly says “don’t pinch my eye!”. So I told him he could step out if he needed to. He says “fine, I’ll just go” angry with me now. Kiddo is asleep now, and I can hear my husband gaming with some friends, so he seems fine now. I don’t mind him gaming during kiddos nap, as I was going to take a nap as well. It’s just so frustrating that it takes so little to overwhelm my partner when he gets so much more free time, social time, and hobby time than I do. Why is he always angry. Why can’t he use a firm “No” without getting upset. It’s so exhausting to have a fussy toddler and an angry partner all. The. Time.

I was even afraid to fall asleep because when I binge I sometimes wake up in the night feeling a weight on my chest or that my head is going to burst. I walked for around 2 hours after the binge and had a cup of tea. 

Then today I have eaten lots of vegetables and roasted potatoes with gravy and then another apple and then a bowl of porridge AND then 4 slices of bread and then 2 large squares of dark chocolate. Now I’m drinking tea and it feels like I’m not in this reality. Like nothing is real and it’s making me want to binge even more. I also hate my grandparents for making me this way. They buy these foods because they know I’ll binge. They hate me but the feeling is mutual. They even make sure the house is silent when I binge so that they can hear me doing it since their room is right next to mine. 

Tonight I’m throwing away all the junk that’s left in the house and I’m going to walk around the kitchen for 2 or 3 hours. I haven’t had a bowel movement since before I binged last night so the idea of all this junk sitting inside of me is making me want to scream. I tried to throw up but I just ended up hurting my throat so badly. I always get really constipated after I binge and it lasts for several days but it doesn’t stop me from adding to the pain by binging more and more. 

I only want dopamine. That’s all I want. I binge because food is the only thing that gives me dopamine. I genuinely cannot get dopamine from anything other than eating or touching myself.

This year, it was his turn. He visited family and he met with some friends including:

1. A friend of his who he had feelings for way before he met me. For context: 3 years ago he also met with her and admitted back then that he felt attracted to her; he says nothing else happened though. Fast forward to today, I told him I did not feel comfortable with him meeting her but he did anyways, so of course I got mad. When I told him how I felt, he ensured me he just sees her as a friend and nothing else, and that he will continue talking to her no matter what.

2. A friend of mine who he befriended last year (she’s an emotional wreck and both my husband and I have been trying to help her survive her unsuccessful romantic relationships). I did not have any issues with them meeting for coffee or lunch (which they did). My problem was thet last night, he told me they were planning to go out of town together to spend the day somewhere with a nicer weather. 

My friend and my husband meeting for coffee? I do not have a problem with that, but them going out of town to spend the day? That feels to me like crossing some sort of boundary. I talked to him and expressed my discomfort but he only got mad and said I was just insecure. That he didn’t see anything wrong in spending the day with her.

Am I the only one who feels that him spending the day out of town with MY friend is weird? Is it weird that I don’t want him to see a woman he previously admitted felt attracted to while we were already married? Am I overreacting to all this?

TL;DR: my husband is in our hometown visiting friends and family. Him meeting with two particular women have made me feel uncomfortable and now he’s mad because I told him how I felt.

Terrified of talking to her so I came up with a fool proof plan to tell her she's pretty. I got my phone out took a picture and wrote the words I think you're really pretty in bold letters, when she gave me the coffee I said oh wait I don't suppose you can read this for me, she read it smiled and laughed I laughed too then kinda just left with my coffee and that was that but I keep thinking about her, I was wondering what to do, do I go back next Sunday around the same time to try and speak to her and maybe ask her out on a date or something?

I'm an introvert by nature, so although I attempted to introduce myself to my neighbours when I saw them, they either glared at me or straight up ignored me, so I gave up on that endeavor fairly quickly.

Every day from the very day I moved in, from around 5:30 pm until 7 am I heard crying coming from one of the apartments around me. I heard it mostly through the vent, so it became distorted and sounded like a child throwing a tantrum. I didn't think much of it at first, children tend to make a fuss over small stuff like eating vegetables. But it persisted for weeks, and it wasn't merely silent weeping, it was straight up screaming and wailing. 

I was afraid that perhaps it was a child being mistreated, and while trying to find out which apartment it came from, the closer I got, the more it sounded like a grown woman. I still suspected some sort of violence taking place, because the screaming persisted for such a long time. I am not exaggerating when I say it happened every single day for hours, and most loudly at night. 

Now I'm not a very strong, intimidating or trained person, so if someone was getting abused, there was little I could do. And I considered asking the neighbours, but most didn't even acknowledge my existence and I was worried I'd stir up trouble with the people I'd have to live next to for the next several years.

So instead I tried calling the police, but I didn't choose an emergency number, so nobody picked up. I then decided to just write to them, explain the situation and asked for advice on what I should do. Instead of responding to me, they showed up at this person's door at 10 pm, confronting her about the crying. After two hours they came ringing at my door to tell me it was not, in fact, an abused child or woman, but an old widow who lost her husband two years ago and hasn't gotten over it. They told me I'd just have to live with it, but maybe I could invite her to coffee sometime and let her vent to me.

The next day, shortly after I got back from work, this old lady rang my doorbell, and told me she had expected me to come introduce myself to her, but since I had failed to do so, she was doing so now. She mentioned that she knew I was the one who alerted the police, showed me a photo of her late husband and then told me I will continue to hear her crying. I apologised and tried to explain that I didn't actually send the cops, but she said she doesn't want anyone around her and excused herself without really reacting to any of it. 

Am I the asshole?

  
TL;DR: Heard daily wailing/screaming coming from a neighbour, asked the cops for advice, they showed up in the middle of the night knocking an old widow out of bed in my name and found out she cried over her husband whom she lost two years ago.",2,1736717581.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

We are remodelling our kitchen and would love some feedback on the designs attached. 

Some further information that may help in terms of practicality: 

1. The stovetop is currently where it is in the 2nd and 3rd picture (aka not on island). There is also a hood vent attached that vents outside currently. The stovetop now is gas, however we plan on switching to induction. 

2. The sink is currently where the window is. 

3. We have some larger kitchen appliances that will need some dedicated space (Breville air fryer oven, nespresso, thermomix).

My thought right now is going with the design with stovetop on island. This seems to create the best use of the space. It gives a coffee/counter area in the pink zone where you can have other cabinets on that wall. The sink will stay where it currently is (I also find this gives the best use of the space because of the window, if we go with option B of just a counter there and sink on island, we wouldnt have cabinets or anything above since there is a window,). Downside would be with the stovetop over the island, we would need some sort of vent option (Either one that goes outside which would be more difficult to install or a hovering hood vent/air filter). 

  
The last option I am not the biggest fan of, as it reduces counter/shelf space within the kitchen and just leaves the full island to have the counter. While nice, with the size and layout of the kitchen I think I'd prefer option 1 or 2. 

  
Would love some feedback!

I have never been married and dont have any kids (other than a female furbaby cat). My hobbies are board games, video games, exercising, watching stand up comedy, horror, action films, discovering new music, love hiking or taking walks by the beach. I'm looking for someone who wants to connect as friends first and see if we want to take it any further.

What I'm looking for in a relationship:

I'm looking to build, from the ground up, a loving, caring, trusting monogamous relationship. A bond that acts as a sort of guiding light in our lives. I want to really get to know you. I like texting, talking on the phone and meeting in person for boba, activities, coffee or dinner. I want to feel like I can tell you anything and that I know you will have my back because you know my character. I love when a woman geniunely wants to get to know me better and is willing to put in the time and effort to make that happen.

Who I'm looking for:

A sweet, loving, caring, professional lady who takes good care of herself and has a propensity to take care of others. A lady who values trust, communication and monogamy. Intelligent women are a huge turn on for me. I love to connect over conversation, board games, coffee, food, wine, music and movies so if you like that sort of stuff, chances are we will probably get along.

Let's exchange pics to see if we're attracted to each other then we can take it from there.

They are often rich women who want to get involved in a cause,  but not really.     So they show up and make a big show of something  but then gossip spreads about them throughout the event and they  ""leave because they don't want to cause a distraction."" 

Example:  At a ""Painting Party""    someone shows up to help paint the dining room in a house.    They come with a pretty gift basket filled with tape rolls and paint brushes.   And then they bring coffee and danishes,   except they are all peanut pastries.    One of the guests in the house has a nut allergy so of course there's an issue.   And the ""lady""  plays dumb;  someone feels like it was a passive aggressive move and it gets a little tension going.    So ""lady""  decides ""it's better if I go,   apparently I've upset Jane and I don't want to create any drama,  I was just trying to help.""

Meanwhile,  ""lady""  never wanted to help in the first place.   But she knows that she rarely does anything among her social circle that's sincere.   She's actually a snob and thinks the other woman should have hired a professional.   She's not really interested in helping.     So she creates a situation where it ""looks like"" she tried to help but was rebuffed.  Now she has her excuse,   ""But,  I tried and they didn't want my help.""

Seems to me that MM and Harry especially have a way manipulating their image in the press  good and bad.  They know, full well that there are many actual causes they could get involved in in CA  and they really don't want to do any charitable work;  they consider it beneath them.   So they show up for the photo op but then they themselves put negative press and criticism of themselves out there.   This way they don't really have to do anything.

I actually cleaned my entire home, started throwing a lot of unnecessary things away, sold some things I could part with(not really for the money per say but it does help) and meal prepped. I neglected so much responsibility when I was gambling. My house was a wreck, I didn't get anything done because when I loss at gambling I'd be depressed and lay in bed all day. But now, I felt sooooo good getting things done and living like an actual adult should. The rewiring of my brain is slowly but surely happening, I feel it!! My pregambling brain is there I'm starting to remember what life was like before this addiction and I'm working to build an even better version of that now. 

My dinner meal prep consists of:
Chicken 
Rice
Zucchini 
Onions 
Peppers

Instead of impulse buying anything from the grocery store without a plan in mind and spending over $100 a week, meal prepping has been keeping me on track with a healthy, cheap, and thoughtful dinner. 7 dinners for under 20 bucks! That's way cheaper and healthier than a big mac at McDonald's :) 

Being more financially mindful gives me hope for the future.

Alternatively there seems to be a coach service between the two airports running every hour or so and the trip is about an hour direct with no stops. 

Given I have six hours until I need to even be at Gatwick to check in, would it be worth it to go into London itself and grab a coffee or lunch or even walk a bit before making my way to Gatwick?

1hzxdnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1hzxdnx/fixing_my_symptoms_naturally/,Fixing my symptoms naturally ,"Hey Everyone! I’ve have been on a journey for my PCOS for years! I was in the navy as an air traffic controller and my sleep schedule switched every week for 6 years straight. I was doing straight cardio to try to pass my fitness exams and i was only gaining stomach fat, having irregular periods, not sleeping good, getting cystic acne ect ect. My dad passed away before the navy when I was 17. And my mom passed away my last year in the navy when I was 24. 

Anyways, I’ve been out of the navy for almost a year now. I’m in a relationship and I know I will want babies. I’m also sick of feeling like crap and getting the run around and always stressed from whatever is going on in my life. For example, military, grief, and constantly moving. 

I’ve been on an entire healing journey since my mom passed away. When she passed I was on the birth control pill but due to me constantly traveling across the country from TX to Chicago to take care of her estate and my emotional well being, i kept forgetting to take my birth control. Now like I said my dad passed away before so I know that when he passed I was very numb at first and in shock. So I did feel the same when my mom passed but also I was staying with my little brother and his dad when I went to Chicago and my brothers dad can not cook and had no healthy food in the house so instead of eating junk I was barely eating but making sure when I did it was healthier foods and I was busy trying to plan a funeral and clean out my moms house for 3 weeks straight. But also I noticed that despite just knowing that I’m in shock I strangely felt way healthier hormonally and I felt like I wasn’t as anxious and depressed. So I decided to just quit my birth control all together and see if my birth control was making me feel depressed and anxious or if it was just because I wasn’t in shock. 

Anyways when I got back to TX my boyfriend told me that I looked great. And looking back on photos my face was not puffy, i had like no acne, and I was more slim. Besides grieving I did continue to feel less anxious and depressed which was crazy to me considering my mom just passed away. So I really did believe if I stayed on the pill I would have felt 10 times worse in my opinion. 

I buckled down on drinking a bunch of spearmint tea, inostol, eating high protein, going to the gym, tanning (in moderation) for vitamin D, and went to 2 therapist at once for my entire last year in the navy. Therapy helped my stress so much. Eventually after I got out of the navy and stopped seeing a therapist I felt so many stressors coming back with preparing to move across the country (we didn’t know where we were moving yet due to my boyfriends job) and fixing up his house to get put on the market ect. Anyways I ended up going down a bad rabbit hole of wondering how can i conquer normal life changes and stressors/transitions while not going gown a PCOS flare up and feel like i need to start all over every single time? Because to me a lot of stuff that was happening was out of my control and having PCOS just makes it so much worse because then I felt like my body would also turn on me. I gained a bunch of weight and all my symptoms came back. 

So I decided to take my journey MORE serious but from a perspective of what are changes I can implement that do not feel temporary for a health change, but feel like an overall maintainable lifestyle change that I actually enjoy? For example eating for PCOS for me can get very boring over time, and whenever I wanted something sweet after eating healthy the whole week I felt like crap and went down a sugar craving episode. 

So I started focusing on finding foods and recipes that weren’t boring that I looked forward to. I stopped only focusing on clean, high protein and focused on whole natural foods. For example instead of vegan gluten free dairy free protein powder for protein I would just eat a piece of chicken or a hard boiled egg. Now this fixed my gut. When I craved sweets instead of dairy free ice cream I would eat dark chocolate covered almonds or fruit. I started to put tumeric, honey, lemon, and apple cider vinegar in a jar and every morning I would drink some with water before breakfast and my coffee. For breakfast I started eating baby potatoes with cheddar cheese, avocados, and over easy eggs or steak, over easy eggs with chili sauce, and Greek yogurt with mint, parsley and garlic in it. I did really interesting fun recipes that I found from a doctor called Mindy Pelz. I learned from her that fasting and cycle syncing is very good for us. Some say fasting is bad but it’s because when you fast at the same time every day your body expects it so it will store fat during that time and slow down your metabolism. But if you fast at random times occasionally your body uses the fat as energy and resets your gut and starts healing all of your bad cells. I started getting more sleep. And practicing journaling, walking, breathing exercises, cleaning out my home to manage stress and clutter ect. 

With all of these changes I healed my gut, my skin got so much better, started having more energy, started being more excited to eat instead of stressed, and felt happier with more energy. 

I just want to say that there is hope. With all of have been through I have somehow gotten somewhere where I feel at peace. My period went from non existent for about a year to now I’m getting a regular cycle but about 40 day length cycles. I’m actually thinking that it’s getting shorter now to 35 day cycles which means it’s getting more regular. I also noticed my boobs grew a little and stomach shrank which is how my mom was. She was very skinny with huge boobs but mine must have not developed properly due to PCOS.

1hzxbxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalCannabis_NI/comments/1hzxbxg/weird_ways_the_internet_says_to_calm_down/,Weird Ways the Internet Says to Calm Down THC-Induced Panic Attacks,"High doses of THC can cause anxiety. Here are some suggestions for the comedown.

Getting way too high is just a badge of honor that all of us diehard cannabis enthusiasts must earn. There is something to be said about pushing one’s limits, regardless of whether it is intentional or not, by ingesting more THC-infused *Capow!* than a fragile mind is prepared to handle at the moment. It is almost certainly a horrific experience, though, dealing with the souped-up anxiety and paranoia that an overzealous evening with the leaf can bring. If that rhymed a little, you’re probably too high right now. My advice is to get through as much of this article as possible while you still can.

No matter how much the many articles published on the subject of cannabis-induced paranoia and panic keep preaching, “Hey, man, never fear, you’re not going to die from this, you’re just freaking out,” nothing and I mean nothing is going to talk a person down from this madness once it takes hold. Still, that hasn’t stopped the internet from spreading all sorts of hippy-dippy come down tactics for calming down a wicked [canna-panic](https://cannabisnow.com/how-to-deal-with-cannabis-induced-panic-attacks/). Presumably, they hope that people suffering from too much highness will click on their reports and find some comfort inside their lunatic brain. But I’m going to let you in on a little secret: They probably won’t find much. Especially not with these five wacky remedies for taming that THC-infused animal running wild inside your skull.

# Just Relax

The first thing people like to tell someone who is far too high for their own good is to just “try to relax.” The operative word here is *try*. Sure, the person hiding underneath the coffee table begging someone to call 911 may have embarked on their stoned journey fully aware that there was absolutely no possible way that they could die from biting off more than they could chew. They may have seen all the statistics, saw how [even the DEA admits there have been no reported cases of fatal marijuana overdose](https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/sites/getsmartaboutdrugs.com/files/publications/DoA_2017Ed_Updated_6.16.17.pdf#page=76). By all accounts, they were ready. Yet, in spite of their preparedness, the weed has them flipping their script, summoning all sorts of stink demons up from the bottom of the Earth to suck out their soul one shallow breath at a time. And all everyone around them keeps saying is, “Yo, you need to relax.” Listen, that’s easier said than done, we don’t care who you are. Edibles in high doses just have a way of climbing on top of a person and makes it hard to calm down. I’m not saying that trying to keep calm isn’t a solid move, but most people in this condition are far too busy trying to keep their heads from spinning off their shoulders to do it alone.

# Break Out The Pepper & Maybe A Squirt of Lemon

When the situation involving an extremely high individual takes a turn for the worse — because none of that relaxation talk worked out — there is some science out there that suggests black pepper, and maybe even some lemon juice will help take the edge off. It sounds ridiculous, I know, but the [pepper trick apparently works for Neil Young](https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/this-everyday-household-item-could-counteract-your-cannabis-induc)! Still, it’s not like sprinting off to the kitchen and snorting up lines of spices will keep your skeleton from clawing its way out of your skin. It’s a bit less Scarface meets Hellraiser than all of that. But there are some studies that show crushing up a pile of peppercorns and inhaling the aroma is effective at easing a relentless buzz. This is because the pepper binds to the same receptors as cannabis and works to produce a calming effect. Now, repeat after me: Om….. Om….. Achoo! The same goes for lemon juice. Science shows that knocking back some fresh lemon juice with some of the zest from the peel can help fight off the THC demons playing paddywhack in the brain. There is a distinct possibility, however, that the person leaning on the pepper and lemon methods to kick their canna-panic might just end up sneezy, all puckered up and still desperately wishing their high would go away.

# Jump In A Cold Shower

Okay, I’ve have seen this method used countless times in the movies whenever someone gets insanely drunk and has like 30 minutes to sober up and get to work. But if you’ve ever tried this at home — and some of us have — the trick here is a bit of a disappointment considering that it really just leaves you drunk, cold and sopping wet. Nevertheless, some publications believe that tossing a person into a cold shower is a sure-fire way to get then to calm down from a buzz that just won’t let go. The idea is that by shocking the central nervous system with a cold shower, the THC will learn who’s boss and back off its mission to drive the person straight over the edge. But go ahead and give it your best shot. As far as we can tell, a legion of [THC](https://cannabisnow.com/what-is-thc/) has no fear of whatever elements you throw at it. This cannabinoid is the postal worker of all cannabinoids. “Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night” will ever keep an overabundance of THC from knocking your face in the dirt.

# Get Some Fresh Air

Chances are the first place a THC spawned werewolf is going once a high gets too hard to handle is outside. It’s the next best thing to an oxygen tank, which they will most certainly be kicking themselves for not having around the house once the involuntary act of breathing all of a sudden exclusively falls on them. But in the dozens of times I have witnessed someone running for the door, trying to escape the high horrors that keep nibbling at their backside like a school of piranha with the munchies, I’ve never known a couple of whiffs of fresh air to help anyone get straight. But at least it gets these fools out of the house. As long as they don’t start howling at the moon and getting the cops snooping around, outdoors is probably the best place for them.

# Get Some Rest

Oh boy, this one is a doozy. After all else fails, some of the best advice the internet has to offer is to just get the person to crawl into bed and get some rest. Only much like some of the other methods on this list, that’s not exactly the easiest thing to do. Trying to get someone who is freaking out on weed to lie still in a dark room with only their racing thoughts to keep them company is a recipe for taking a gnarly situation and making it worse. I’m sorry to say, but just putting the super high to bed and hoping they will no longer annoy everyone else in the house is never going to work. These people need special care — someone to talk to and coax them down off the proverbial ledge — otherwise, they could ultimately lose their composure and fall to pieces. Honestly, we’ve only seen this method work if a bottle of benzodiazepines is close by.

I'm a guy in my mid-20s with a good job, my own place, savings, etc.  However, due to the cost of living and my desire to own my own home soon, I'm try to be frugal and cut back on going out to expensive places. Instead I like to do more activity based dates, like going to a museum or nature hike and getting coffee. I'm finding that a lot of women are taking offense to this.  

To be clear I'm not seeking out women who are obviously materialistic or overtly socially conservative.  Since I'm fiscally conservative, but socially more liberal I've been trying to go out with women who are more socially liberal too.  But even that isn't necessarily a good indicator.  I recently went out on a date with a woman where I picked her up and dropped her off, as well as paid for our dinner at a nice restaurant.  During the course of dinner she repeatedly expressed her opinions on how society should be more progressive.  She revealed that she's a former sex worker for example.  She's also involved in a lot of other very progressive causes.

After I dropped her off, she texted me saying that I didn't do a good enough job of making her feel special.  She said one of her former clients, turned boyfriend (decades older than us) used to regularly spoil her and she expected that from me.  I responded by saying that she can either ask for equal treatment or special treatment, but not both.  She then started cursing me out and insulting me.  Saying that guys are just inherently less valuable than women and because women have it harder in life they deserve to be pampered by perspective dates. 

 Obviously this is an extreme example, but I come across this mindset a lot.  Now to be clear, I've also met plenty of great women who just want to go on a date to get to know me and reciprocate effort too.  However, I can't find any good way to screen for this.  Is there anyway to do this respectfully? ",0,1736716659.0,dating_advice,7,0.5,False

1hzx4jg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parappa/comments/1hzx4jg/parappa_theory_what_did_master_chop_chop_onion/,Parappa Theory: what did Master Chop Chop Onion have that morning?,"In Parappa 1, one of the final stages of the game, ""Full Tank"", Parappa raps against everyone hes ever met at a gas station to see who gets to shit first. One of his quotes in said stage, he states, ""What I had this morning, I dont even want to say to you."" and now I would like to discover what he ate that morning

Part 1: What foods are canon to the Parappa universe?
From Parappa 2, since the plot revolves around Noodles, and burgers are mentioned, we can start listing foods
-burgers
-noodles
-baguettes (from picnic scene)
-weird brown shit parappa ate in picnic scene (if i had to guess, it looks like chocolate cake)
so essentially they have every food we do. But we have to consider one important detail: Master Chop Chop Onion is an onion. I highly doubt he would eat onions, considering thats cannibalism.

We need to keep in mind, the ""chocolate cake"" parappa ate caused him to have diarrhea or whatever. so that could very well be a consideration of what master chop chop onion could've had that morning.

But wait, we forgot about the second part of the quote!
""I dont even want to say to you""

this quote alone implies a lot of things. It may have implied that he is eating something foul that he would not want to show to a younger audience, or even his unhealthy eating habits that he does not want to express because of the deep internal pain.

But before we get into that, we have to research what foods may give you diarrhea specifically if you're an onion. so based on my research of what foods make onions have diarrhea, I have concluded a list of items here.

-Taco Bell, specifically the Beefy 5-Layer Burrito OR Cheesy Bean and Rice Burrito
-Nachos Cheese Deluxe from Burger King

But we also need to take into consideration that he states that he ate this mysterious food at morning, so it is more likely to be a morning food, although not guaranteed. Some breakfast foods that could possibly cause diarrhea include but are not limited to:

-Cheesy Hash Browns
-Too much coffee
-Sugary Pancakes or Cereal

But I would like to propose a new theory. There may be a Cholera outbreak in PaRappa town, and this is a much more serious issue than we realize. It makes sense because everyone has ever met has to shit at the same time. so that may lead us to another theory that the town may have all ate the same thing that exact morning. Cholera is caused by dirty water so they may have a poor water. but perhaps I wasn't drinking any water during his meal, which could also lead to contributing factors or maybe it was the brown shit cake he was eating. 


The lack of water was drinking is causing him to have major diarrhea and health issues. The less water you drink the harder your shit is gonna be. So in conclusion, everyone ate some breakfast chocolate cake, and that may have been what master chop chop onion had that morning but wait there's more maybe he had an even more excessive amount of it and he doesn't want to admit his unhealthy eating habits to Parappa. which yet again maybe be another coping mechanism for the sad poor master chop, chop onion. he is probably dealing with some internal doubts and issues and struggles, and we don't know how long this has been going on for. In conclusion: CHOLERA OUTBREAK AND MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS... because they have all gone insane

Millie was my mother’s dog, after my mother passed away 6 years ago, my brothers and I decided we would take care of Millie. She has mainly been living with me for the last 6 years, along with me moving around because of job changes and new living situations. We’re now settled with with my parter and her 2 yr old Greyhound, plus we’re now expecting a baby in June!

Millie has always been an anxious and sensitive dog, being protective over her space, food and even me. I know that resource guarding can be a trait in smaller dogs, especially bichons but it was never a huge issue but something I could manage and be proactive with. 

My partner and I noticed Millie’s behaviour getting hard to deal with before we moved around 6 weeks ago. Sitting under our coffee table and barking/snapping at us if we moved, not wanting to be moved off the sofa, more resource guarding, not wanting to be picked up and very aggressive around breakfast and dinner time if we were near her food which she would barely eat. 

My partner suggested I order a blood test for Millie which after a few trips and other tests has pointed towards her having Cushings Disease (we have one more test booked in 4 weeks to confirm). 

We have tried to identify and limit Millie’s aggression triggers over the last 6 weeks, but she has almost daily aggressive outbursts and it takes such an emotional toll on both of us. We have agreed that Millie can’t live with us when the baby gets here and my brothers aren’t in a position to be able to take her in due to her behaviour. 

We feel totally stuck in terms of what we can do. My partner is scared of her and when I’m out at work, she’s too scared to even show affection to her dog (Millie will guard him) or even be downstairs around Millie. 

I was always in a position where I could manage her behaviour before it got worse, but as life has changed, Millie has struggled so much to adapt to these changes. She’s had a stressful life in terms of moving around etc and losing my mother but now I feel like we’re at a complete loss. 

I’m going to speak to the vet this week to see what options we have but I would like to see if anyone has had similar experiences. 

As a note - this aggression is shown to everyone and not just us, she seems to tolerate me more than most people but I still take the brunt of the aggression.

Last week, I handed over the reins of my life to a computer. Let’s just say it was a week of existential crises, unexpected efficiency, and my mom being 110% done with me. Let me walk you through my emotional rollercoaster—and I want to know: would YOU let a computer manage your life?

**Day 1:**

Woke up angry because I forgot to buy my favorite cereal (classic Monday). But then... **ding-dong**. A delivery guy stands there holding my holy grail of crunchy happiness. My computer had ordered it. Along with coffee, milk, and *fruits?* Like, what’s next? Finding me a soulmate?

**Day 2:**

Had a dinner plan with my mom. Morning argument happened (don’t ask, but she brought up my life choices again). I wasn’t feeling the whole “let’s pretend everything is fine over lasagna” vibe. My computer took the liberty of notifying her with a message that was too polite to be mine.  
Fast forward to dinner time—she shows up anyway, fuming. Computer calmly announces from the doorbell camera: **""You shall not pass.""**  
I thought I was about to be disowned, but turns out my mom has a dark sense of humor. We ended up laughing about it (after she made me promise to never do it again).

**Day 3:**

Had a meeting that screamed, “This could’ve been an email.” The computer agreed. It sent out a summary of the key points *before the meeting even started*. Then it RSVP’d on my behalf: *""Not attending. Please read the email instead.""*  
I have never felt so liberated.

**Day 4:**

Texted my friend about gaming that evening. He didn’t reply fast enough, so my computer handled it.

* Confirmed the plan.
* Agreed on a game we both love.
* Prepared the game.
* Reminded me to grab snacks. It practically sat me down in front of my desk at 8 PM sharp like a coach hyping me up for a championship match.

**Day 5:**

Family dinner. You know, *that* type of family dinner where you start mentally drafting your autobiography titled *""Please Stop Asking When I’ll Settle Down.""*  
My computer saved me by faking an urgent notification. *""You need to walk 500 steps now!""* I escaped, did an awkward circle around the block, and came back to dessert like nothing happened.

**Day 6:**

Friend’s birthday party was coming up. I had no idea what to get him, but my computer casually DM’d his AI (yes, apparently his AI exists). They had a whole AI-to-AI convo, ranked the best gift options, and even handled the order. I’m now the proud owner of “Best Gift Giver” status.

**Day 7:**

I told the computer at the start: “Make me successful. Analyze my strengths and just... do your thing.”  
It went full Tony Robbins meets *Just Do It*. By the end of the week, I was:

* Hitting my goals at work.
* Actually being productive without feeling like garbage.
* Meeting new people without awkwardly standing in a corner like a plant.

I swear, it’s like the computer *knew* me better than I knew myself.

Bonus: Remember that episode of *The Big Bang Theory* where Sheldon lets the dice make his decisions? My computer was like, “Hold my algorithms.” I handed it all my life goals, and it’s like, “Got it, chief.” Instead of yelling at me to hustle, it quietly nudged me toward the stuff I actually care about.

**Would you let a computer manage your life?**

I’m torn. On one hand, it was life-changing. On the other, my mom is never forgiving the Gandalf doorbell moment.

Would you let a computer handle your life? What’s the *worst* that could happen? Share your wildest scenarios below—let’s brainstorm how chaotic this could get. 👀",0,1736715796.0,deeplearning,2,0.11,False
1hzwuzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hzwuzs/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_our_friend_group/,AITA for telling my friend that our friend group forgot about his birthday and i had to plan it?,"We have a friend group of five people, including a couple known for their chronic lateness—let’s call them Lategirl and Lateboy. I met them through my friend BdayBoy, who introduced me to the group. Baby is the newest member and has recently started getting frustrated with Lategirl and Lateboy’s habit of being 30 minutes to 2 hours late. To cope, we give them fake earlier start times, but for special occasions, their behavior creates serious problems.

Last year, they ruined both BdayBoy’s and my birthday celebrations. For his birthday, they somehow delayed the event to the next day at the last minute (don’t ask me how one delays someone else’s birthday). I had makeup on, ready to celebrate, but ended up going out with just BdayBoy. The next day, we had to cancel our reservation because they didn’t show up again. They eventually arrived with cake, and we sat in a local coffee shop for an hour. For my birthday, they made plans with me a week in advance but forgot entirely. I ended up at BdayBoy’s house eating cake because I hadn’t planned anything else. A month later, they gave me a cake and a necklace.

This year, I’ve been living in another city, and today is BdayBoy’s birthday. Yesterday, I learned they all had plans to go to Baby’s house, so I assumed it was for his birthday. When I called Baby, she had no idea it was his birthday or that there were party plans. I quickly reached out to Lategirl, reminded her about his birthday, and helped organize a plan for tonight. All they had to do was not be late.

Fast forward to today: Baby called me, saying Lategirl asked her to delay BdayBoy by sending him to the store to buy random items because they were running late again. So, BdayBoy spent part of his birthday shopping for pointless things. I was furious. I called him, and though he already suspected he was being delayed for a surprise, I told him he needed to confront Latecouple about their lateness. He hesitated, saying it would be the third time, and Lateboy always dominates the conversation with excuses.

I reminded BdayBoy that we’ve always been there for Latecouple’s special occasions with thoughtful gifts and support, while they ghosted us on ours. Baby had also been waiting for hours alone because they were supposed to help set up. When BdayBoy worried that confronting them would hurt the friendship, I finally told him the truth: they had forgotten his birthday, I was the one who reminded them, and he only ran errands because they needed more time.

BdayBoy is a genuinely good friend. While we’ve always supported Latecouple, they expect a lot but give almost nothing in return. He gets visibly frustrated when they make us wait for hours but avoids conflict. Baby also wants to talk to them because it’s affecting her daily life. I was so frustrated they pulled this again on his birthday.

My mom says I shouldn’t have told BdayBoy they forgot, and after calming down, I feel guilty for saying it on his birthday. They’re together now, and I know he isn’t happy because they forgot.",7,1736715693.0,AmItheAsshole,7,1.0,False
1hzwu3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Webnode_Official/comments/1hzwu3w/6_fast_ways_to_grow_your_small_business/,6 Fast Ways to Grow Your Small Business,"Hey fellow entrepreneurs! 👋

Are you struggling to grow your small business or wondering how to take it to the next level? Don’t worry—you’re not alone! Expanding a business can feel overwhelming, but with the right strategies, it’s completely achievable. I recently came across some awesome tips that I’ve started applying to my own business, and I wanted to share them here.

Here are **6 actionable strategies** to help you grow your small business and increase revenue:

# 1. Conduct Market Research

Before jumping into expansion, you need to know your market inside out.

* Analyze customer needs and competitor trends.
* Identify your business's strengths, weaknesses, and untapped potential.
* Scan for new opportunities and potential threats to refine your strategies.

By understanding the market, you’ll be better equipped to target the right audience and plan for growth.

# 2. Offer Related Products or Services

Diversifying your offerings is a great way to attract more customers. For example:

* If you run a coffee shop, consider adding items like teas, milkshakes, or even branded merchandise.
* Experiment with new ideas in smaller markets first to test their success.

Think about what complements your current products and aligns with your customers’ preferences.

# 3. Leverage Digital Marketing

A strong online presence is critical for any business today.

* Use social media to showcase new products, discounts, and promotions. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok are great for reaching younger audiences, while Facebook and email campaigns work well for older demographics.
* Optimize your website for SEO to make it easier for customers to find you online.

👉 Pro Tip: If you’re looking to create a professional website, try [Webnode](https://www.webnode.com/r/5fbff3f9a5d55). It’s an intuitive platform that makes building and managing your website simple.

# 4. Participate in Networking Events

Don’t underestimate the power of face-to-face networking!

* Look for trade shows, local flea markets, or pop-up events where you can showcase your business.
* Meetup groups and conferences are great for connecting with potential clients, suppliers, or even new business partners.

Every interaction could lead to a new opportunity, so always be prepared to pitch your business.

# 5. Establish Strong Partnerships

Strategic partnerships can boost your visibility and sales.

* Cross-promote your products with complementary businesses.
* Partner with influencers or loyal customers to spread the word about your brand.

Building strong connections and rewarding loyal customers can go a long way in expanding your reach.

# 6. Encourage Positive Reviews

Your customers are your best brand ambassadors!

* Make it easy for them to leave reviews by adding QR codes on menus, receipts, or your website.
* Incentivize reviews by offering small discounts or perks for customers who recommend your business.

Positive reviews on platforms like Google or Yelp improve your credibility and increase your visibility online.

# 🚀 Tools to Help Your Business Grow

To scale your business efficiently, equip yourself with the right tools:

* **Project Management**: Use tools like Toggl or Trello to stay organized and manage tasks.
* **CRM Software**: Tools like HubSpot help you track and manage customer relationships.
* **Marketing Automation**: Platforms like Buffer and SendPulse make it easy to automate your social media and email campaigns.
* **Financial Management**: Use apps like QuickBooks or Billdu to simplify invoicing and accounting.
* **AI Automation**: AI-powered website builders like Webnode help you create a website in minutes by recommending templates, text, and images for your business.

# 💡 Conclusion

Growing a small business isn’t just about working harder—it’s about working smarter. By conducting market research, leveraging digital tools, and building strong partnerships, you can position your business for long-term success.

If you’re ready to take the next step, start by creating a professional website that reflects your brand and attracts more customers.

For our first time hanging out we took my roommate’s dog for a walk, got a coffee and then hanged out for a bit at my place. 

Second time I saw him, he came over again and we got some food and played wii. That day he asked me what was I looking for, and I said that I was not sure, that I was not necessarily looking for something serious, but wasting opposed to it, and that i was basically down to see where things went. He said that it was the same for him, that he is a very busy guy and probably doesn’t have the time for a relationship, but that if he had to put the time and effort in he would. This day was the first time we kissed, we made out of a bit and then he left.

Third time we saw each other, i went over to his place, he made dinner, we watched some movies, we had sex, and I stayed the night.

After that, we have hanged out multiple times, he’s met most of my friends and I went to one of his soccer games. Most of the time we hang out tho is with my friends (we do a lot of board game nights), we almost never hang out by ourselves. After board game nights he usually spends the night. For xmas break, I went on vacation and he even offered to drive me to the airport.

Whenever we have hanged out with my friends he has made comments on how cute I am, and how he loves that I am kind and caring to others, he hugs me, and is really sweet around me.

We talk on snapchat every day but nothing too meaningful, mainly we just send each other little updates throughout our day. He almost never asks about my day or shows much interest on what I am doing. The thing is, he is not like that when we talk on the phone or hang out in person, just over text. Is he a really bad texter? does he genuinely not care? 🤷‍♀️

Before Christmas he mentioned that he hadn’t opened an actual gift in at least 3 years, and I have honestly started to care about him so I wanted to make him feel special and got him a xmas present right before my trip. I was gone for 2.5 weeks, and when I came back, he gave me a gift too. 

During my trip, our texts were pretty much the same as always and we didn’t talk over the phone at all, we did have a couple spicy conversations and i sent him a bunch of bikini pics.

I’ve been back from vacation for a 1.5 weeks now and I’ve seen him twice. but I feel like he hasn’t shown too much interest in hanging out, I keep insinuating that i should come to his place and spend the night, and he always says he is not feeling good, or that he is super tired. 

I understand this, because the guy does work all the time, and has a very busy life. I want to give him his space and not be needy. 

He is a lot of fun to hang out with, he is super sweet with me whenever we are together, he get along with my friends, and I honestly would like to know where this can go. 

We haven’t formalized anything at all, so for all I know he could be hanging out with other girls. I wanna talk with him about us and where he sees everything going because I don’t know if I want to invest too much in a relationship thats not going anywhere, but I also don’t want to pressure him or make it seem like im rushing things. So i don’t know how to bring the conversation up.",2,1736715288.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

Contextualizing before anything else, i am 30+ male, handsome and financially stable. I am gonna try make this short.

So, i met this 27 year old woman randomly, 2 months ago. She is actually from my hometown although i never seen her before. Our convos we're flowing naturally and enthusiastically. We never had clingy or needy texting. We start dating, slowly and smoothly. First date was just a cup of coffee and it was great. Second even better. Third one was a dinner and... great again. I never forced anything, we had light forms of touching, kissing and so on but i can feel our chemistry is uncommon, very strong. Meanwhile all this, she starts to put me in Heaven, telling me i am an amazing man, handsome, smart, etc. Next date ends in my house with absolutely amazing sex (not only she told me, i could feel her orgasm twice). I start to think i may have find someone perfect to me, finally, but i never tell her directly, although i keep showing her appreciation, care and affection. Meanwhile all this, our texting or calling convos keep going naturally and interesting.

Then it came a fkin mindblow. We have our next date scheduled. She seems excited about it all day but just two hours before sends a wall of text, telling me that she may not be ready for this dating/relationship thing. Like a mature man and knowing this is out of my control, this things just happen, i've accepted and shown her that i understood and respect her feelings, i would give her space and time, and keep up with her, etc. Obviously, i cancel the date but she asks me to meet her the same, to explain herself to me in person. I meet her and she shreds in tears with me, explains to me she has severe trauma from her ex's physical/emotional abuse on her and its going on therapy because of it (soon enough i found out this is actually true and not any kind of excuse and i know for a fact that her ex is not around), can't deal with this thing of dating me and is literally affraid to death of fall in love with me and get hurt again. Again, i show her understanding, affection, i tell there is no problem or need for her to feel fear or guilt, try to hear her out and keep my mood light and help her out through that. We end up kissing again and we decide to proceed slowly from then on, keeping in touch with each other. 

Next few days she seems back to normal but then (2 weeks ago) i feel her going colder and colder with me. She refuses to meet me saying she can't be with me because she feels overwhelmed by the romance feeling with me (wtf is this even possible?). Even in texting, i feel she only answers to be polite or friendly with me to the point that if i don't text her, she doesnt text me first anymore. Sometimes it takes her hours to reply. I am now stopping chasing her, we've stopped talking 3 days ago because i want to give her space so maybe she misses me but she's not reaching out to me!

My question is: is it possible trauma has this effect on a woman? Literally run away from a man she likes? Or am i being played/ghosted here? Should i call her and open myself to her or that would scare her more? Is it possible to convince her i am not gonna hurt her? Regain her interest?

 Is it possible to almost be in love with someone and the next day you just pushing him out of your life?

Is she giving me signs to just give up?

My gut tells me to let her go but have in mind i really like this woman, she is really amazing and compatible to me!

 I am not sure if i did something wrong! Was i too nice? Should i had shown her i was sad or angry, instead of trying to light our moods by being positive, understanding and affectionate? 

I need some advice, i am so confused, i can't decode this and decide if i should kind of insist on her and see what can happen in the future or i should just let her go.",1,1736715234.0,dating_advice,12,0.67,False

I asked for a almond milk cappuccino from the barista where I work the other day. (He knows I have Celiac.)

There are 4 milk jugs. 2 for cow's milk and 2 for alternative milk. The Coffee shop uses oat milk (a gluten containing one) and almond milk.

When he began making it I noticed he grabbed a jug that'd had milk inside it and he didn't get rid of all the traces of the milk when steaming the jug to ""clean"" it. I asked him which milk was in there before and he said it was the oat milk but that he ""cleaned"" the jug.
Obviously I couldn't drink the coffee as it was cross contaminated.

Just be aware if a coffee shop uses gluten containing oat milk. It isn't difficult to be affected by cross contamination - even when you're not eating.

1hzwijd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hzwijd/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_our_friend_group/,AITA for telling my friend that our friend group forgot about his birthday and i had to plan it?,"

We have a friend group of five people, including a couple who are always late. Let’s call them Lategirl and Lateboy. I met them through my friend Bday Boy, who introduced me to the group. Baby is the newest member of our group and only recently started getting frustrated with Lategirl and Lateboy's constant lateness, which ranges from 30 minutes to 2 hours. Over time, we learned to deal with it by giving them a fake, earlier start time. But for special occasions, this habit creates serious problems.

Last year, they ruined both Bdayboy's and my birthday celebrations. For Bdayboy's birthday, they somehow postponed it to the next day on the last minute (don’t ask me how one delays someone else’s birthday). I had literally my makeup on and we had to go celebrate just the two of us. And they couldn't make it the next day for our reservation too, we had to cancel it and they showed up with cake and we sat at a local coffee shop near Bdayboy's home for an hour. For my birthday, they made a plan with me a week in advance to celebrate but forgot about it entirely. BdayBoy took me to his house and feed me cake because we hadn't make plans because of Latecouple. They got me cake and a necklace one month later. 

This year, I’ve been living in another city, and today is Bdayboy's birthday. Yesterday, I found out they all had plans to go to Baby’s house, so I assumed it was for Bdayboy's birthday. When I called Baby by chance, she had no idea it was BdayBoy's birthday and hadn’t been told of any party plans. I quickly reached out to Lategirl to remind them about Bdayboy's birthday and helped them organize a plan for tonight. All they had to do was not be late.

Fast forward to today: Baby called me and said Lategirl had asked her to delay Bdayboy by sending him to the grocery store on his way to Baby's house to buy pointless items because they were running late again. Bdayboy ended up shopping for random things on his own birthday. By this point, I was furious. This wasn’t even the first time today’s celebration had been delayed. I called Bdayboy, who already suspected he was being delayed for a surprise. I told him he needed to talk to Latecouple about their lateness, but he was hesitant, fearing it would hurt the friendship. It would be the third time he’s brought it up, and when confronted together, Lateboy always dominates the conversation, makes excuses, and justifies their behavior.

I reminded Bdayboy that we’ve always been there for them on their special occasions with thoughtful gifts, and support, but they ghosted us on our birthdays last year. I also told him Baby had been waiting at her house for hours because they were supposed to arrive early to set up, and now she was stuck there alone.

When Bdayboy said he was worried this would damage the friendship, I finally told him the truth: they had forgotten his birthday, I was the one who reminded them, and despite my warning not to be late, they still were. The only reason he was running errands on his birthday was because they needed to stall him. I told him that friendships are a two-way street, and if they can’t even show up on time for a birthday, there wasn’t much of a friendship to lose.

Now I feel bad. Bdayboy is genuinely a good friend, and while we supported Latecouple through a lot of special events, (and they expect a lot and they are very vocal about that) but give almost nothing in return. He gets very angry and agitated when they make us wait for hours but he doesn't want to start a fight. When Baby called me, she said she wants to talk to them because it was hurting her daily life and it was happening everytime and on every event. And i was so fucking frustrated that they did it again on his birthday. My mom says I shouldn't have told BdayBoy they forgot, and after calming down, I feel guilty for saying it on his birthday. They are now together and i know he is not very happy because they forgot.

1hzwi1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1hzwi1l/bluebay_esmeralda_cancunriviera_maya_honest_review/,BlueBay Esmeralda Cancun/Riviera Maya Honest Review,"My family of 4 (kids are 3 and 7) just came back from an All-inclusive vacation from Cancun Mexico and we stayed at Bluebay Esmeralda

Our first room was really bad. My family got stuffy after staying there for only 1.5 hour. We arrived at 11pm and we were tired so we thought to rest for a night then request to change a room the next day but it was sooo bad that I walked to the lobby and requested to change a room in the middle of the night. Please note that there was only 1 cart/bell boy in the evening so it was a pain to walk from building 1 where our room was to the lobby (maybe about 1km). I had to convinced the staff that my kid has respiratory problems. (I heard other people couldn't changed their rooms when they had the same problem) Before I left the room, I took a video of the room that had molds/water damage in the bathroom ceilings, in the room, around the AC. 

The staff then asked me to check a room in building 8 (opposite end of the resort) and I'm telling you, the difference is night and day. The room smells really good, no signs of water damage or mold. 

The issue we had was not the room but the customer service we received. The fridge inside the room was not cold, we requested multiple times but they only fixed it 2 days before we left (we were there for 7 days). Another problem was they forgot to leave bath towels one day and I didn't realized it until I was in the shower. We didn't have a phone in our room soo my husband had to walk to the lobby to request but it was at night and no cart so it took forever for him to arrive there. I didn't get the towel until maybe 1.5 hours later. I just used the hand towels to wipe myself LOL. 

Anyway, building 1, 2 and 3 are very close to the beach and pool and building 6, 7 and 8 are probably 1.5kms away. There is a smaller pool in 6,7 and 8 but the fun stuff and the beach are close to buildings 1, 2 and 3.

We don't have any problem with food, everything was good but just make sure that you always book for your dinner reservation (they only allow the reservation a day ahead). 

They are trying their best to entertain their guests, there was a fireshow, disney show, dance, pool party everyday, amazing kids club activities. My kids enjoyed sand castle, pinata making, cookie making, jetski rides. They also invited vendors one night so those who wanted to buy souvenirs can buy from them.

They had a few restaurants, a la carte, there was even a BBQ/hamburger/dogs one afternoon. There was also coffees/ice cream shop where you can get free coffee/ice cream everyday.  

TIPS:

bring a bunch of 1 USD - this is what we give for tips. A dollar or 2$ go a long way to those servers/bell boys/kid's club staff etc

Don't book trips/tours from the resort. I remember we were being charged 160US$ per person (adult and kids) for Chichen Itza but when I looked online, I found $50/person + $39 entrance fee at Chichen Itza for adults for the exact same tour. Kids are free in Chichen Itza entrance so we really got a huge discount. 

When buying from the vendors, always haggle. Example, we were at 5th Ave in Playa del Carmen (we went out of the resort for a day to explore), instead of 400 Mexican pesos ($20), I said 200 pesos ($10). I ended up paying $15. Another one was $20 for bracelets with our name, I got them for 2 for 15$ lol. I know some are still expensive but I also wanted them to earn.

bring sunscreen/mosquito repellants from your home country (make sure it's under 100ml if you put them on hand carry). The resort sells them for $27 (sunscreen) and $18 (mosquito repellants).

Overall, it was a so-so experience for us. We booked last minute and this was the most affordable compared to other resorts so we stayed here. ",1,1736714775.0,AllInclusiveResorts,0,1.0,False

I had got hooked on a product called Noonbrew which was a powdered instant tea product that was able to give me a little caffeine and some mental clarity/focus boost. I liked it because it was powder that I could drop in a glass of water and quickly down before heading out for a workout or a run.  Steeping and waiting for cooling isn't always something I can fit into a busy morning.

They sadly discontinued it so I'm on a hunt for an alternative. What I'm finding is that most things are coffee alternatives that taste closer to coffee instead of tea (which I prefer). Does anyone know of a good replacement out there?

We have been together for 3 years now and live together. I honestly think that this is my first relationship where I’ve truly understood what love means. When we’re not arguing, it feels like he is my best friend we makes me laugh, he is good in bed, and overall I think he is a good person but when we’re arguing we turn into something else. We like to go out to bars and clubs every few months and there has been multiple times where he has left me in a uber alone drunk and at like 3 am because he thought I was flirting with the driver. I’ve caught him lying about him looking up his ex on fb or when we first started talking he was talking to one girl and he said she was like a sister but the girl was friends with his ex which made me uncomfortable. I asked him to block her and he didn’t and kept saying she was like a sister but later found out he had a threesome with her and the ex. Yesterday I went through his phone and saw him looking up other girls and he lied and said they were cousins and family but when I went through the messages he was flirting with them in 2011, and they weren’t cousins or family. When we got in an argument he screamed at me so loud and I didn’t feel any empathy or love at the moment. I was yelling and cussing too. In the first 2 years I always had to initiate sex and always felt like I wasn’t sexually attractive or maybe I was just terrible in bed. He won’t even go down on me and will say that’s because his ex used to smell terrible but expects me to give him head which I do all the time because I love pleasing him. Career wise, I feel like he is not ambitious enough. But I think about the good times we have. He’ll show affection and do small things like making me coffee every morning and heating up my car before work and it makes me feel like he cares. But then there’s days like yesterday where I feel like he’s a liar and really good at manipulating me. I don’t know what to do. 
Oh and the multiple girls he was looking up on fb he said that was because I told him to remove them from his account and that was the only reason he had looked them up is to remove them. ",0,1736714416.0,Marriage,0,0.5,False

As I write, I mostly use my imagination. I also write about events that happened to me. But writing things that I’ve never experienced (moving to a far away city, confronting authority figures, being on the run, etc) (to name a few) makes me feel like my writing is kind of weird? 

Not to mention, my characters should be these people who’ve had intense/interesting lives. I haven’t gone through something novel worthy (only regular trauma). 

I still feel very strongly about my story and will continue writing it, but I feel it kind of reads as a fanfic/make believe fairytale (and not the good kind)

How can I write when I’ve barely lived? I know the automatic response is “well, live”. But I don’t have the time to lol, all I do is study, work, write, read sometimes, and meet with friends occasionally. 

I was thinking of writing in coffee shops and listen to conversations to look for inspiration. I also do research on interesting people in history and get inspired by them and add a bit of their life onto my characters.

My biggest concern is that my writing reads as amateur (I mean, I am technically an amateur writer since I’m working on my first draft) and shallow. I hope I’m making sense as well (English is my second language) ",2,1736714330.0,writing,4,1.0,False

It's been a long time since I posted in this community, but I came across a post from someone today who said they were close to ending their life because they couldn't deal with the symptoms. It was heartbreaking, and I immediately opened my laptop to write this message for anybody who needs it as I sometimes forget that SIBO was part of my everyday life.

**Before you go any further**

There is no TLDR, I'm not a ""medical expert"", and I'm only speaking from my personal experience. What worked for me might not work for you, and my philosophies are just that... my philosophies! Take whatever you want from this, implement it all or implement zero, but trust your own judgement.

**Where I was before**

Starting in 2019, I began to experience (overly) normal ""digestive issues"" such as extreme bloating, uncontrollable movements, the eventual inability to digest food, and never knowing when terror was going to strike (like the time I was about to board a flight from Texas to Vancouver and almost didn't get on the plane). They would be ""there"", then they would be ""gone"", I didn't know what was causing it, and I didn't know the cure, and so began spending 2+ years of my life and $10,000+ dollars searching for answers.

My attempts included, but weren't limited to:

\- So many rounds of ""eradication"" I lost count. This included biofilm busters, Rifaximin, Neomycin, S. Boulardii, berberine, berberine compounds, ADP Oregano (actually a pretty good one), Allimax, Atrantil, the list goes on FOREVER.

\- Having a doctor at a walk-in tell me it was just ""H. Pylori"" and prescribing me antibiotics + PPI (this was a bad idea)

\- Working with 4 different practitioners, most of which suggested a ""low FODMAP"" diet followed by herbs or pharmaceuticals.

\- Doing a GI 360 map, to find out I'd basically killed a majority of my beneficial bacteria and caused severe damage to my microbiome

\- Experiencing EXTREME mental symptoms like depression, anxiety, random episodes of panic, which I learned were a result of disrupting the microbiome to such a degree

\- Having days when just getting out of bed was a struggle

\- Feeling like I'd never find an answer

**Where I am now**

SIBO is not a part of my life. I do not have any digestive issues whatsoever. I usually have one movement per day, I drink two coffees on an empty stomach each morning (I recently got into making espresso and have been loving it!). I still eat a clean, plant-based diet with the occasional chocolate croissant, cinnamon bun or coconut ice cream mixed in for good measure 🫣). I don't wonder if something is a FODMAP food. Nothing causes bloating, and I don't obsess about what my levels would be on a breath test or whether I was going to have to pay for something at a later date such as the apple crisp I had last night. I don't bring TUMS or Pepto when I'm travelling (2 things that do more harm than good). There is life after Small Intestinal Bacteria Overgrowth.

For the record, I don't remember my last breath test or what it read, and I don't plan to take any in the future. If I have zero symptoms and live a healthy, happy life, that's more than good enough for me!

**My routines / philosophy in no particular order**

\- If I had to start over, I would strictly go the route of probiotics. Specifically, I would use ""Seed"" which I still take twice per day. I don't have ""relapse"" if I go off of it, but I notice my energy is higher than it's ever been (32M for reference) when I'm on it. I have zero affiliation with Seed, I'm just a regular paying customer. For someone that's going to comment ""it's too expensive"", consider the intangible costs of not being healthy. It's 2024, anybody can make an extra $49 USD.

\- Cut out all substances (if you consider coffee a 'substance' then I guess I am a substance abuser). I'm talking about alcohol, weed, nicotine (3 things I used to use often to avoid facing my feelings, but haven't for years). In the book ""Reality Transurfing"", the author talks about how substances are ""borrowing happiness on credit, but the loan is never interest-free"".

\- NEVER DO ANYTHING WHILE EATING EXCEPT FOR EAT. Focus on your food. Chew it slowly, enjoy the amazing cascade of things your body does to digest food!

\- Exercise is a non-negotiable part of your life, poor motility and sitting on a chair for 8 hours per day go hand in hand.

\- The only supplements I take are B Complex, D3, spirulina and chlorella mix, 2000mg Vitamin C and magnesium.

\- I usually eat one meal per day, sometimes two (12pm and around 5 or 6pm). Once or twice per month I'll do a 24-48hr+ water fast with black espresso or drip coffee in the mornings.

\- Food can be poison or medicine. A diet rich in diverse plants and fibre sources ensures a diverse microbiome. I eat a lot of berries, apples, leafy greens, bright vegetables, plant proteins and fermented foods. I haven't had meat in around 5 years, not for ethical reasons just for the sake that I feel better without it. I don't consume dairy, but if I'm out for dinner or packing my children's lunches I will sometimes have a few pieces of cheese (burrata is a personal fav).

\- SIBO isn't a cause, it's a symptom of a deeper root cause. In my opinion / from my experience, the microbiome gets out of balance because the nervous system is out of balance. I doubt it's simply coincidence that when my symptoms were at their peak, my body was always in a ""fight or flight"" state. I was going through divorce, trying to balance single parenting and generating cash, my life was a disaster and my body showed it. I would read ""Becoming Supernatural"" by Dr. Joe Dispenza, and would highly recommend doing the Progressive Online Course. This work has taught me so much about bringing the body back into balance, and how physical symptoms are a symptom of a deeper emotional / spiritual root cause.

\- I use cold therapy every day and it has changed my life in so many ways. This is also something I would attribute to having great digestion. I typically spend 2-4 minutes in water anywhere between 35F and 50F, depending where I am and whether I'm close to my cold plunge or not. If not, I'll find a body of water to swim or submerge in during the winter, or as a last resort have a cold shower.

\- Meditation is a healing powerhouse, and a modality that allows you to access the subconscious mind / body, along with suppressed memories.

\- I incorporated cyclical hyperventilation ie Wim Hof breathwork into my routine a few years ago, and do my best to practice it every day. This not only opens our ability to influence the autonomic nervous system, but (in my experience) allows us to go deep into the parasympathetic nervous system.

\- Other healing modalities, either self-directed or administered through a practitioner such as EMDR, Havening Therapy Emotional Freedom Techniques have the ability to release suppressed emotions that are good at hiding themselves into the unconscious parts of the mind and body.

\- I don't know if this has anything to do with digestion, but I lay on an accupressure mat each night for 30m before bed and it is amazing for sleep and relaxation.

\- Sleep is the most underrated magic pill in the world. I measure my sleep and aim for 7 to 9 hours of uninterrupted sleep per night (assuming my kids are on board with this)

**In conclusion**

I hope this helps someone who needs it. The body is an energy system, it's always responding to our thoughts, feelings and emotions. When it gets blocked, we experience disruptions in our physical body that manifest themselves as uncomfortable symptoms. There is no ""one thing"" to heal, there are a cascade of things that people can do for themselves every day that down-regulate the symptoms that promote dis-ease, and upregulate the genes that promote health.

Took my trash tote to the curb and saw my ex drive right past me (we live in the same apartment complex, yay me)... ok whatever right? 

I hop in the car and head to the coffee place and oh joy, guess who I'm beside on the road to the coffee place at every red light from here to there... ok no big deal yeah? Well she turns off into a random, weird parking lot for a place that is closed on Sundays. I know she did this to get away from me, or at least that is my impression but whatver, I go about my business and head to the coffee place get my small drink and drink it as I'm heading to lunch. 

I get to the lunch place and its packed, the parking lot is full (after church crowd I guess) but I've had my heart set on this for lunch as I've been fast the last couple days and I was drooling over this particular spot. It happens to be a spot she and I used to go to a lot but whatever...

Well, guess who was in the parking lot with their mom, getting out of their car right as I pulled in and there was no way for her or I not to see cross paths at this point... In a moment of panic and this being just a few minutes (20 minutes maybe) after the coffee turn off incident, in a moment of panic I stopped just a little ahead of her, rolled my window down and said ""hey I had no idea you two would be here I just went for coffee and wanted to come here for lunch i'm not trying to follow you."", she said ""uh.. ok"" they got back in their car and left.

Now I get to cringe and feel like an idiot for the rest of the day. I know they would shit talk and call me a stalker either way if they saw me and I said nothing, or said what I said...

It makes it stand out from the other hoyo games and has a level of realism to its situations. You can genuinely see the characters in real life well not a talking bear or wolf… yet but we all probably know a ben and lycaon

For example -

Seth- i think we all know someone or are like seth who has this older sibling that you want to compete with and step out of the shadow and become their own person without needing help.Seth journey is one we can look to for inspiration and to drive forward in life.

Corin-  A person we all have probably come across in life where they are kind but scared of their own shadow. Like seth corin is someone you can relate with especially if you’re a shy person and i feel like the story can eventually have her grow to break away from that.

Lucy- Now i don’t know how many people can relate but her story is very unique.  A character that wants to break away from the ties that bind her is feel good story . You can have people who will relate to that and take it her message to heart.

Section 6 as a whole - Let’s be real you either know someone or are someone like a member of section 6.

Yanagi- I will be honest i have a bit of yanagi personality of always trying to get things done and being serious when needed. But i think for people who relate to her they probably like to have things in order, be ahead of things or really don’t want things to pile up especially when it comes to team work.

Harumasa-The interesting one here it fits two types of people the friend who while lazy is extremely intelligent or the person who is sick but still pulling through living their live to the fullest. We all know a harumasa and i think we learn to appreciate them more as time goes on depending on both sides.

Miyabi-  I don’t know how to describe Miyabi is full but i would say she’s the type of friend or person who is quiet,very honest / very sarcastic and someone  like harumasa who is lazy when they want to be. I know way too many people like this and trust me they do get annoying sometimes.

finally Soukaku-… the innocent one who eats a lot and naive… I can’t say much about this one because A. i don’t usually don’t get a chance to chill with them and B. they are very hard to interact with because you don’t know want will set them off.

To conclude this is the beauty of zzz i only mentioned a few but you can go through  all  the agents, npc or whoever else and be able to relate to them on some level, i feel that this world has something the stands out and more can be revealed.

1hzw80a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Disneyland/comments/1hzw80a/all_my_disneyland_meals_ranked/,"All my Disneyland meals, ranked! :) ","Hi all! I just spent three days in Disney. I had a long trip back (three flights, two layovers, no real in flight entertainment) so I found myself mentally ranking all the meals we'd had, and now that I'm decompressing I thought I'd post my thoughts here. We had two days in Disneyland itself and one day in California Adventure, and I did a LOT of refreshing on the website in advance to get some good rez-es. So let's go! Oh, and throughout it's awkward to keep saying ""my partner"" so I'll say ""MP"". We're both in our mid 40s and not obsessive foodies, though we do like a nice meal! Oh, and neither of us really like alcohol, not because we're against it or anything, but just because it doesn't do much for either of us. Ok, here I go... Worst to best.

**9th: Dinner at Cafe New Orleans.** I had the **Battered & Fried Monte Cristo Sandwich** and MP had the **Blackened Shrimp Alfredo Pasta**. Full disclosure, I am sensitive to garlic and so they put EVERYTHING on the side of my sandwich, including the preserves, so I didn't have the full experience. I know the sandwich is over the top but it just didn't work for me.  The shrimp alfredo was 100% up my partner's alley in theory, but the portion was surprisingly small and the flavor was fine, not special. The ambiance was nice -- we were there as the sun was setting -- but the food was really meh. Also, the servers were fine, but not special compared to the servers at other places we went. Also, they seated us almost 20 minutes late and it took them almost 45 minutes to bring us our food. It wasn't awful or anything; I'm not here screaming and yelling about it! But it was just not worth the trouble of getting a rez in my opinion, unless you're someone who really really loves that special sandwich. All in all, it was just such a disappointment compared to what I'd heard that I have to put it last.

**8th: Lunch at Bengal Barbecue.** We just got some **skewers** and they were fine, but the meat ones tasted a lot like those microwave Chinese food tv dinners -- the Healthy Choice Cafe Steamers, maybe you know the ones. They did their job, they were quick and easy and convenient and the **veggie skewers** in particular were good. It was nice to have some cooked vegetables.  We ate over by Tropical Treats, near the little talking bird who tells bad jokes, and it was a beautiful day, so it was still a nice time. :)

**7th: Lunch at Rancho del Zocalo**. I just wanted a **kid's meal** and MP got the **Rancho del Zocalo Chicken Caesar Salad,** so it's entirely possible we would have had a more special meal if we'd gotten a house specialty. It's just that we were both still a bit full from breakfast and we'd had amazing Mexican food at this place near our hotel, so we didn't get anything too heavy. MP loves Caesar salad so he enjoyed his meal, but felt that it didn't come together totally -- it was like they just put Mexican flavored chicken on top of a normal Caesar salad. My kid's meal -- a bean and cheese burrito -- was just what I wanted -- my stomach is a bit jumpy sometimes and I just wanted something kind of plain and pleasant. The setting was nice, it was fast, there wasn't anything wrong. I'd go back there happily. I just liked the next six meals more.

**6th: Pym's Test Kitchen breakfast**. We both got the **Calculated Breakfast = E x 2 + (B+P)/T** and it was a bit of a mixed bag. The bread was delicious -- it was supposed to be focaccia but I think it was the sourdough...? Either way I'd eat a loaf right now. The tater tots were tasty, if a bit too garlicky for my personal taste (I'm weird! I know!!), though MP happily nommed my leftovers. The scrambled eggs were rubbery and tasteless, I think from a mix...? and they cold when we got the plate, even though I think we were the only ones in the restaurant. They might have been from a mix due to the egg shortage, but they at least could have been hot. The teeny fried egg was tasty and perfect -- I think a quail egg? I loved it. It would have been a lot more fun if there was theming outdoors where you eat, but we did enjoy the theming of the food itself and the pretzel gag inside where you order is really fun.

**5th: Dinner at Docking Bay 7.** We both got the **Endorian Fried Chicken Tip-Yip**; MP got it with the ""vegetable mash"" and I got it with macaroni and cheese. I loved the theming and found the meal itself really good. The chicken was tasty and it was so nice to have a big hunk of broccolini. We also got a **Moof Juice** and a **Phattro** and had trouble figuring out which was which, if that tells you anything. They were both good, but the Moof Juice was supposed to have chipotle in it, and we couldn't find it.

Side note: we also had a mid-afternoon stop here for a **Cold Brew Caf**, which I had been looking forward to but found kind of meh? I couldn't get over how the little balls were just obviously cocoa puffs. It was 80% ice and 15% cocoa puffs and just 5% coffee, so I don't know -- I know people like them but they just weren't for me. But we also got the **Vintian Mineral Mousse** and loved it. It looked spacey and weird and tasted great.  Kind of hard not to like a dessert like that, to be fair.

I ended up preferring the **Taverne Cold Brew** I got at **Red Rose**. Maybe 10% too sweet?  But overall very good. I'd get it again.

**4th and 3rd: Breakfast at Ronto Roasters**. Bright suns! Naturally, we got the **Ronto Breakfast wraps**. On the first day we ate them at the little tables there, and on the second day at DLR we went back, but this time we took the food into **Oga's Cantina** (I had an early morning rez).  They let you do that -- I asked in advance. Obviously, it was more fun to eat it at Oga's!  Oh, and if you get the **Black Spire Brew**, here's a tip: just don't mix it! The coffee stays on the top and the juice is on the bottom, so you can drink the coffee and then drink the juice at the end. Kind of the perfect breakfast. (Of course, I didn't do that -- I got a hot coffee from Ronto's and a **Jabba Juice** from Oga's.) Also, I really dig those weird wraps. I know I'm grading way up for atmosphere but I never said I wouldn't. Go ahead and get an early rez at Oga's -- you can do a quick Millennium Falcon first and by the time you're done eating, the line at SW: ROR will actually be a bit shorter.

**2nd: Lamplight Lounge Dinner.** I was lucky enough to get a rez here at the regular LL, not the boardwalk dining,  and it was so nice to sit outside and look out over the pier at the coaster and the big Ferris wheel. I had the **Tuna Tataki Salad** and MP had the **Impossible Burger** \-- he eats meat but likes to have fake meat sometimes.  I had the **Mint To Be** and MP had the **2319**. Both super tasty! Also, our server was helpful and friendly and personable. I asked for the tuna to be ""as rare as they are legally allowed to make it"" and the server said he'd do his best, and it did in fact come out almost raw, which was perfect.

**Best: Lunch at Carthay Circle Lounge.** Again, super lucky to get a rez. We were seated at a high top, which isn't my favorite, but other than that, everything was perfect. We got the **Bao Buns of Soy-Ginger Braised Pork Belly**, and they were so good we ordered another pair.  The **Autumn Salad** had a lot of lovely bitter endive -- it really hit the spot. And the **Vietnamese Twice-cooked Beef Lettuce Wraps** were also delish. I just loved every bite of everything we had here. It was pricey AF but worth it, especially when you're on vacation and want something a bit special. I had the **Rose Petal Soda** and it was a tiny bit too sweet, but otherwise great, and MP loved his **Wildberry lemonade.** The jazz band (Nickle and Dime) started playing, and tons of characters went by and waved at us. Our server was great and chatted with us a bit about some of the attractions he likes and explained why the characters were dressed in different clothes than they usually wear. It was just a great meal, start to finish.

Honorable mention: On the day we arrived, we went to the Anaheim packing district and I had this goat cheese pesto sandwich at the Black Sheep that was straight up delicious. If you feel like something a little different, there's a lot of good food there and it isn't far from Disney at all (by car).

All of this is just my opinion, of course! But I thought I'd put it out there. It was fun to relive my vacation in food form with all of you. :)",2,1736714065.0,Disneyland,5,0.58,False

+++++

When the watch malfunctioned, everything in Felix’s life shattered—except for him.

He’d been 36 then, a tinkerer working in a workshop filled with gears, schematics, and endless cups of cold coffee. The pocket watch had been his prized possession, a relic he'd inherited from his father. It wasn’t just a timepiece; it was a prototype. A crude, dangerous attempt at personal time manipulation, made long before the $TIME devices became standard issue for Time Keepers.

Felix had always been curious, pushing the boundaries of what the watch could do. One night, alone in the workshop, he decided to test its limits. He had calculated everything—or so he thought.

The moment he activated the mechanism, a low hum filled the room, followed by a deafening crack. The air seemed to fold in on itself. His body jerked violently, as if caught in an invisible current, and then—nothing.

When he woke up, the world was the same, but he wasn’t.

Felix stumbled to his feet, feeling strange. His clothes hung loose, the sleeves of his shirt falling over hands that were smaller, pudgier. He looked down and saw tiny, unfamiliar fingers clutching the watch’s chain. Panic surged as he scrambled to a nearby mirror.

The reflection staring back was a 12-year-old boy.

At first, he thought it was another trick of the watch, some temporary side effect of the malfunction. Days passed, then weeks. His body remained frozen, stuck in pre-adolescence, even as his mind remained sharp, burdened with the memories and knowledge of an adult.

He couldn’t go back to his old life. His colleagues, his friends—none of them would recognize him. He tried to blend in, to start over, but the endless stares and questions about why he seemed to have no family made it impossible.

Eventually, he withdrew. He wandered from place to place, keeping to the shadows, relying on the skills he’d honed over his adult years. The pocket watch, damaged but functional, hung from a chain around his neck like a curse. He didn’t dare tamper with it again, afraid of what it might do next.

Over time, Felix learned to adapt. His youthful appearance became his disguise, his secret weapon. No one suspected the boy in the oversized hoodie of knowing how to dismantle a time device or hack into secure systems.

But inside, the burden of his eternal youth weighed heavily. He watched the world age around him, people he cared about grow older, and still, he remained a child. His laughter became hollow, his smiles forced.

The only solace he found was in the ticking of the watch. It was a cruel reminder of the moment everything had gone wrong, but it was also the last link to his past.

My Georgetown interviewer was the polar opposite and kept gushing about how wonderful campus life was.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 3 and a half years.
Anytime I hangout with my girl friend he has no issue and welcomes it as I don't see her often.
Whenever I've hung out with my gay guy best friend he'll welcome it but then tell me things like l'm prioritizing him. On Friday I told him I was going to go get coffee with him and then he's like what're you guys going to do after and I said hangout at his cottage. He immediately took that as me hiding information from him and him having to pry information out of me.
He said he wasn't comfortable with me going to his cottage simply because he's a guy. I told him I didn't agree with him and he made me so upset about the situation I said now I don't know if I want to hangout with anyone tomorrow. I talked with multiple people and they said that he's not to tell me who I can and can't hangout with and where. My boyfriend and I kind of ended the phone call on not the greatest terms. The next day I went over to my gay friends like planned. My boyfriend came over later that day and when he found out I went to his cottage he pretty much lost it. And when he gets like this his whole personality changes and I actually feel scared in the moment. He was saying things like wow you clearly don't care about my opinion and I honestly started blacking out mentally because he was attacking my character at this point and making me feel like I was cheating on him with my gay friend. He took the pillowcase of his pillow, took his things out of my dresser gave me my key and slammed the door as he left. I had to tell him to go because he was attacking me in this moment with his words. It's hard for me because I think of all the good times we shared together and all the good qualities he possessed. He was almost always kind, loving and was truly my rock and person. I'm already grieving the memories we shared that were so happy and filled with love. But I also can't ignore the things that I feel were so different on. I hate how his whole personality changes when he gets mad in those few instances and it scares me. I didn't like that I felt he didn't accept and care about minorities the way I did as he told me in August he'd vote for Trump but then took it back. I didn't like that he made me feel like l was hiding things from him with my gay friend. On top of all this I feel like I truly lost my sex drive in our relationship. It was a constant stressor for me feeling like I wasn't meeting his needs in the relationship. I'm not asexual I'm very much into guys and have no idea the exact reason I lost my sex drive. It also hasn't helped that we live over an hour a part from eachother and really on got to see each other on the weekends.

Here’s the situation (from my POV): 

At the start of the year, my husband signed us both up for a 5k in March. We decide to go for a jog together once a week and train on our own time. 

Then, earlier this week, we say we’re going to do our first jog together this morning. From what I can tell, this is when my perception of what will happen and my husband’s begin to diverge. He says something about wanting to take it easy for this first one. I say “yeah, like maybe only a mile.” He says no, he doesn’t want to put a number on it. He says “I just want to get out there and talk about how we’re going to do this.” 

At this point, I think he means we go out, walk and talk a bit, maybe jog a few blocks or something. So this morning, I put on my running clothes and shoes, and we leave the house. He hadn’t slept well, but when he brought me coffee this morning I asked if he was up for the jog, and he says yes. (He says he doesn’t remember that.) 

We leave the house, get to the corner where I always start my runs, and I start talking about how I like to jog (three blocks running, one walking), and he starts teasing me to slow down and enjoy the fresh air and the morning. It’s cute, I laugh, but I’m also a little confused—we are supposed to be training. At this point I think I am locked into a rigid understanding of what’s “supposed” to be happening. So I say, well are we going to run or not? And he says no, he doesn’t want to run at all, just walk. 

And I get SO upset. I don’t know why I felt so off balance so quickly, but it happens sometimes. The change of plans felt so destabilizing, and I felt like something we were doing together was just pulled out from under me. For my part—I got really upset quickly and my husband didn’t feel heard and felt I accused him of tricking me when he thought he had me clear from the beginning. I felt very strongly that he had NOT been clear. 

In his mind, saying “I just want to get out there,” meant that he may or may not feel like jogging. In my mind, because we had started with the premise of jogging, not jogging at all never entered my mind. This led to a pretty frustrating fight where I felt he had been super unclear and he felt I was reacting really harshly and blaming him unfairly. 

I think we both are somewhat right, but we both have some complex feelings crowding our perception: him about his relationship to exercise, me about my neurodivergence. I am REALLY stuck on the vagueness of “I just want to get out there.” I just feel like it’s so confusing, but now that I’ve calmed down, I see how he meant it. He’s asking me to give him some grace and ask for clarification when I need it. I have given him feedback before that I feel like he speaks in cryptic phrases where HE knows what he means, but I am taking it very literally. 

My questions are: 
Does anyone else struggle with imprecise language and/or have trouble reading between the lines of things once you get an idea in your head of what’s meant to happen? 

Does anyone else have trouble with plans changing unexpectedly? Realistically, I shouldn’t have been so upset by walking, and I had my phone and headphones with me: I could have just run a bit on my own. Why did I blow it up into a whole thing!? I felt a bit like he was “abandoning” me when we said he didn’t want to run 🤦‍♀️

Is this ADHD shit, or should I actually look into possible autism spectrum? I’m diagnosed ADHD and definitely have it, but I’ve wondered about autism. 

And of course I’m feeling wounded and vulnerable: is there something wrong with me? Am I just being a huge diva? Is it unreasonable to get frustrated by imprecise language and changing plans? 

All thoughts are welcome! I am aware I did not act my best here. And my husband and I usually communicate really well and have a wonderful relationship—he’s my absolute favorite person, and I’m devastated that I spoiled our morning with this dumb fight. But since we have had these kinds of miscommunications before, I thought maybe someone could give me some insight 💚

Before I married my husband he knew about it and would only drink once in a while and stopped vaping all-together. I was happy, he’s a great man with a lot of patience. When we just got married he cooked, cleaned, worked hard and did everything amazingly. Then he started slowly drifting into drinking every night, vaping, doing laughing gas and admitted he sometimes does harder drugs when he’s with his friends. We went to counseling because I was worried for him but now he has 2 jobs (one day job and at night he opened a small business) and still does his addictive substances and the counseling isn’t really doing anything. 

I never see him, he’s lied to be multiple times about his use which doesn’t change him in any way really, he’s still sweet even when under the influence but tonight he went to hangout with friends and didn’t come back home. It’s already 12pm next day and no notice of him. I know it’s because he spent all night drinking with buddies and is probably sleeping on someone’s couch. 

Honestly, I constantly have thoughts of leaving him but I’m Christian and he’s a kind man so I don’t really know what to do. I definitely don’t want to have children with him because I don’t want them to grow up in a household that partakes in these addictive substances. I don’t complain much about his busy schedule, I ended up filling my evenings with gym, chores, hangouts with parents or friend but it’s so sad that I never see him and he doesn’t really care.

My anxiety is at an all time high when tall buildings and skyscrapers come into  view. I never had this fear as a kid or teen. I only started having anxiety after the death of my great grandmother and seeing an open Casket for the first time in my life. 

At work when travelling, chewing gum or eating sunflower seeds with a coffee cup as my spit cup helps take my mind off things and eases the anxiety. But I recently took a trip to London ontario from Sudbury and the gum and seeds didn’t really help at all and the trip was brutal. 

My work recently added a trip to Vaughn Ontario and I don’t know how I’m going to manage to make the trip at ease for myself. When I went through Vaughn over the summer to get to London I noticed that Vaughn has tall buildings. 

Listening to music, gum and sunflower seeds, breathing exercises nothing seems to be helping. My doctor had gave some medication which helps when I don’t have anything planned for the rest of the day since the meds make me drowsy, but I have to work as soon as we arrive so the meds aren’t a good idea either. 

Durring these intense moments I often feel light headed, I have a really hard time breathing. I cough as a way to cope. Trying to sleep doesn’t help. I lose control super easy and I experience excessive sweating. 

I’d like to hear similar stories and most importantly how you guys cope with this sort of thing. Thank you ",1,1736713203.0,Anxietyhelp,1,1.0,False

See images: https://imgur.com/a/vesubio-espresso-maker-ydl1lCl?

From afar it looked like a Bellman steamer which I've been looking for. But then I realized it had an area to place coffee as well, kinda like a mokapot. I thought I could use it on the stovetop but looking at the bottom now I'm not so sure. It's not flat on the bottom like my Mokapot but has a round indented area in the middle which has some solder on it. 

There appears to be another model called CXE25 that is like a bellman that sits on an electric hot plate.

Does this Vesubio require an electric hot plate as well (which I guess it has been separated from when it ended up at the thrift store) or can I put it right on a gas stovetop?

I'm worried the solder may melt on a stovetop. ",2,1736713136.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I am also using a Breville Smart Pro Grinder.  Wow, what a learning curve.  I bought whole beans at our local roaster yesterday that they use for their espresso.  

  
Started at grind size 12, which was the default setting and what I’ve seen online as a good starting point.  That seemed to choke things off as I got barely any coffee.  After a few more tries, i ended up with grind size 17 with about 18-19 gram dose.  That produced 44 grams of coffee that tasted pretty decent.  Is that about what I should be looking for, or is that too much?  This was using single wall basket.

Q: Do round diamonds ever go out of style?A: Round cuts are considered timeless and have remained popular for centuries.

Q: How important is fluorescence in round diamonds?A: It's mostly a personal preference. Some prefer no fluorescence, while others don't mind or even prefer it. It can affect price and appearance slightly.

Q: Is it safe to buy a round diamond online?A: Yes, if you buy from reputable retailers with detailed certifications, high-quality images, and good return policies. Always verify the diamond upon receipt.

1hzvra9,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1hzvra9/does_athome_teeth_whitening_actually_work_my/,Does At-Home Teeth Whitening Actually Work? My Experience with Laughland,"Teeth whitening is something I’ve always wanted to try, but the cost and potential sensitivity of professional treatments held me back. Over the years, I’ve tried whitening strips and toothpaste, but the results were barely noticeable. Recently, I decided to try an at-home whitening kit, specifically **Laughland teeth whitening**, to see if it could deliver real results. Here’s everything I discovered, from start to finish.

# Why Choose At-Home Whitening Over Professional Treatments?

Professional teeth whitening is undoubtedly effective, but it comes with a steep price tag—often $500 or more for a single treatment. For many people (including me), that’s not a realistic option. At-home whitening kits like Laughland offer a more affordable and convenient alternative.

What stood out about Laughland was its **dentist-formulated whitening gel** and LED mouthpiece, which seemed more advanced than the usual strips or gels. Plus, it promised results in just six days with minimal effort.

# What’s in the Laughland Teeth Whitening Kit?

The kit arrived neatly packaged and included:

1. **Whitening Gel**: A professional-grade formula designed to remove both surface and deep stains.
2. **LED Mouthpiece**: This device activates the gel to enhance its effectiveness and speed up results.
3. **Applicator Pens**: For precise and easy gel application.
4. **Step-by-Step Instructions**: A simple guide that made the process foolproof.

The packaging felt premium, and the instructions were clear and easy to follow, which immediately boosted my confidence in trying it.

# How to Use Laughland Teeth Whitening

The process is straightforward and takes about 10 minutes a day:

1. **Brush Your Teeth**: Start with clean, dry teeth for the best results.
2. **Apply the Gel**: Use the applicator pen to coat your teeth evenly.
3. **Use the LED Mouthpiece**: Insert the mouthpiece, turn it on, and let it work its magic for 10 minutes.
4. **Rinse and Clean**: Rinse your mouth and clean the mouthpiece for the next session.

It’s easy to fit into a busy schedule and doesn’t feel like a chore. I often used it while watching TV or scrolling through my phone.

# My Results: What I Noticed Day by Day

Here’s how my experience played out over six days:

* **Day 1**: No major changes yet, but my teeth felt cleaner, and the gel was easy to use with no strong taste.
* **Day 3**: By the third session, I noticed subtle improvements. My teeth looked a bit brighter, and the stains from coffee and tea were starting to fade.
* **Day 6**: By the end of the cycle, my teeth were about 6–7 shades whiter. The results looked natural and even—no blotchy or overly bright areas.

What really impressed me was the **lack of sensitivity**. In the past, whitening products often left me wincing with every sip of cold water. With Laughland, I didn’t experience any discomfort at all.

# What Sets Laughland Apart from Other Whitening Products?

There are countless teeth whitening options out there, but Laughland stands out for several reasons:

1. **Dentist-Formulated Gel**: The gel is designed to be effective yet gentle, making it safe for sensitive teeth.
2. **LED Technology**: The LED mouthpiece activates the gel, speeding up the whitening process and ensuring even results.
3. **Temperature-Controlled Ingredients**: The gel is stored in a controlled environment to maintain its potency, unlike many over-the-counter products that degrade over time.

# How Laughland Compares to Other Whitening Methods

I’ve tried several whitening methods in the past, and here’s how Laughland stacks up:

* **Whitening Strips**: Convenient but often cause uneven results and sensitivity.
* **Whitening Toothpaste**: Good for maintaining a white smile but not strong enough to tackle deep stains.
* **Professional Treatments**: Highly effective but costly and often lead to sensitivity.

Laughland offers a great balance—it’s affordable, effective, and gentle enough for daily use.

# Common Questions About Laughland Teeth Whitening

Here are some questions I had before trying the kit, along with my findings:

1. **Will it damage enamel?** No. The gel is formulated to protect enamel while effectively removing stains.
2. **Does it work on deep stains?** Yes! Laughland addressed both surface stains and discoloration caused by years of coffee and tea.
3. **How long do results last?** This depends on your habits. Avoiding staining foods and maintaining good oral hygiene will help keep your teeth white for months.

# Tips for the Best Results

To get the most out of Laughland, here are a few tips:

1. **Stay Consistent**: Use the kit every day for the recommended six-day cycle.
2. **Avoid Staining Foods**: Cut back on coffee, tea, and red wine during the whitening process to maximize results.
3. **Practice Good Oral Hygiene**: Regular brushing and flossing will help maintain your brighter smile.

# Final Thoughts

After completing the six-day cycle, I can confidently say that Laughland teeth whitening works. It’s easy to use, gentle on sensitive teeth, and delivers noticeable results without the hefty price tag of professional treatments.

While it may not replace professional whitening for extreme cases, it’s a fantastic option for those looking for an affordable, convenient way to brighten their smile at home.

1hzvp8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1hzvp8r/sandos_finisterra_cabo_san_lucas_review/,Sandos Finisterra Cabo San Lucas - Review,"This was our first time traveling to Cabo San Lucas and to Sandos as well.

We arrived at the Cabo Airport early so we breezed through customers and immigration. There is a large area so during busier times it seems like they would be equipped to handle the crowds.

We chose to use Cabo Airport Shuttles getting a private SUV round trip- cheaper option than what was offered through the resort. The shuttle service was fantastic, no wait times for either pickup or drop off.

Room Review: We stayed in the Junior Suite Ocean View being upgraded during our check in process. Room was large with King Size bed, double bed and a pull out sofa. Balcony was large with nice sitting area and great views of the pool area and Pacific Ocean. We did have an issue with out shower not draining properly which was never resolved unfortunately. Not deal-breaking at all but unfortunate. 

Pool Review: There are a total of four pools - VIP, Activity, Adults and Kids. We only spent time at the Adults Only Pool which was the only pool with a swim up bar along with being near to many of the daily activities such as Tequila tasting, Aqua Gym and Trivia which were at the Adults Pool. We had no trouble finding sun loungers but during busier months I could see this being a possible issue as the pools are not large. Waiters were constantly making the rounds checking in on if you need food or drink both of which can be ordered poolside. While there are beach loungers be aware that it is prohibited to swim in Pacific Ocean as the currents can be quite dangerous - we are pool people so that wasn’t a large issue for us	
Food/Drink Review: 
I’ll start with the most important thing - the drinks :) There was nothing special about the drinks but I also did not find them to be watered down or anything like that. Large selection of liquors along with more premium brands for those who are members/part of the Sandos club.
Onto the Restaurants, the first thing I’ll say is for those that love a buffet at their all inclusive this might not be the spot for you. There is breakfast buffet every morning, no buffet for lunch and dinner buffet Thursdays and Fridays. 
Breakfast was either the breakfast buffet and the coffee/cupcake shop. The coffee/cupcake shop was special serving great treats and specialty coffee all day. Lunch options include the poolside restaurant with Mexican and American options. Our favorite was the sushi spot next to the activity pool, we had lunch here every day.For dinner there is  a steak house, international cuisine, Mexican and Italian which we enjoyed throughly. The service was prompt, food was tasty and the wait times were low.

Location Review: On one side of the resort you have the Pacific Ocean and on the other the Marina. The marina is the heartbeat of Cabo, with shops, restaurants and activities all within walking distance of the resort. Great for morning walks/runs or to try a local restaurant or bar for lunch/dinner one of the nights you are there.

Overall Review: 4/5 - The resort shows it age (oldest resort in Cabo) in the size of some of its spaces. The pools and restaurants are smaller which when it’s not busy is great! The location is hard to beat with amazing views all around you.
