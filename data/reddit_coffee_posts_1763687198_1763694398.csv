1p2nh71,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1p2nh71/f_29_lets_talk_and_start_a_friendship/,[ F 29 ] Let’s talk and start a friendship.,"Making new, genuine connections shouldn’t be like pulling teeth. Hopefully this post won’t be one of them. 

Hey. For those who care about the specifics, I’m 29 years old, AFAB, and pansexual. 

Lately, it’s felt nearly impossible to make new friends my age. Most of my older friends have long gone and burrowed into their new comfy lives with kids, families, and newfound marriages. Which, don’t get me wrong, I’m incredibly happy for them. But it’s left me feeling pretty beside myself. 

All of that and more has made it harder to find anyone nearby who shares my interests. So I figured I might as well see who is out there on Reddit.

As a general disclaimer, I am not looking to make a bunch of friends. I’d honestly even be happy just finding one person I connect with. 

Now with the generalities aside, let’s get a little bit more specific… 

A little about me. I lean pretty alternative, have a handful of piercings, no tattoos yet, and I fall somewhere in the genderqueer, androgynous area of things.

As for music, I usually drift toward shoegaze, dream pop, indie, folk, jazz, and other alternative stuff. A few favorites are Ethel Cain, Nothing, Whirr, Slow Crush, Cigarettes After S*x, Sufjan Stevens, and Chelsea Days for a few.

I really love reading literary fiction. Genre fiction has never clicked for me. (Sorry sci-fi lovers, I just can’t get into it). I am more drawn to writing that dives deep into the human experience in strange or interesting ways. Think Joy Williams, Raymond Carver, or Clarice Lispector. I especially love short story collections and often read those when I’m out on a hammock or up early drinking coffee.

Outside of reading and writing, I have been trying to get back into knitting, making music, and painting. It’s been a while, but I miss having creative outlets.

I was also very into philosophy club in college, so I am always down to wander into long conversations about whatever strange or thoughtful idea comes up.

I would love to meet someone with similar interests who enjoys deep talks and would maybe be open to hanging out one day. Late night coffee, a smoke, hiking at state parks, and conversations about life sound pretty ideal to me. I am not looking for quick or temporary friendships. I want something genuine.

If this sounds like your vibe, feel free to send me a message. Hopefully we’ll connect!",1,1763694179.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False
1p2ngrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diary/comments/1p2ngrk/betrayed_by_a_friend_i_helped/,Betrayed by a friend I helped.,"Bear with me it's a long story.

I'll avoid names and details for obvious reasons,  but I have (or had not sure yet) a friend of 6 years, who just got a horrible divorce about a year ago, her ex-husband husband did something horrible that still boils me to this day, my friend after the divorce lost temporarily custody of her 5 kids but they managed to stay with family so in all not that horrible there at least, she became extremely depressed, almost all her friends turned their back on her by telling her that why didn't she noticed first and such (horrible assholes). Seeing this and me knowing all that transpired I just couldn't just stand back, so I offered my help in everything I could, talks till 2 - 4 am, cooking, offering advice and support, etc. 

Fast forward 8 months after and we're talking more often and going out for coffee as she's finally starting to come out of the shell but still sensitive on a few days a week, so one day she decided to tell me that she's had a crush on me but never did anything out of fear of loosing my friendship, I won't lie I was expecting that at some point as I was starting to consider it also, but it wasn't the right thing to do, not while she was still recovering from the trauma of the divorce and all that entailed, so I told her: 

""You're an amazing woman, I won't lie I've thought about it more than once also, but I don't want to take advantage of you while you're still healing, I want you to focus on your kids for now and yourself, if in a month or two or whenever you feel ready, and you feel the same then ask me again and we'll go out and see where it leads""


 I do love her, and I realize that this was probably a stupid thing to do but I do have my reservations for being with people specially when kids are involved. 

When I was younger before I met her my girlfriend/partner of the time got pregnant, I was happy and ready to start a family, but she was scared or it looked like that to me, and she told me she wasn't ready, she was almost 3 months pregnant when we realized, so I told her that I understood that I wasn't going to force her even if I was ready and wanted it because she was the one carrying our daughter, so she aborted...
Our relationship never recovered, after a while one of her friends suggested to her that she should erase me from her life and she agreed, when she told me I was just numb and I just let her do as she wanted.

A year and a half later I see her in a city festival and she's with the ""friend"" that suggested she erased me from her life, and they're pushing a baby stroller... 

So now with my friend who I helped through her divorce and trauma, 3 weeks ago she calls me and  starts texting me how she got introduced to someone, that a friend insisted, well according to her, the guy is exactly like me. 
""He's like you, he has the same sense of humor and manners, he says the same jokes and behaves the same, it's like you but Asian"" and such she tells me after she met him and they start texting. 

They go out for a date and she asks me to babysit her kids, I accept and I don't think too much about it as she told me it's just as friends, and during her date she says the same thing to me how he's just like me... They end up sleeping together the same night, and she tells me about it the same night when she picks up her kids as we talk in private so they don't hear, I play along and say that I'm happy for her that she had fun even if I'm dying on the inside, the worse part is that she tells me again at the end ""he's really just like you, but for some reason I feel bad"" .... 

We're supposed to talk soon, she knows my past and how my ex aborted my daughter, but she doesn't know the full context of it, well that's my story, I do blame myself for not being more assertive but I can't help it, and I thought she understood that after knowing me for 6 years... 

Well that's my story, fucked up and pathetic I know. ",1,1763694146.0,Diary,0,1.0,False

it was only until a few months ago, that i realised that the western food store just... doesn't exist at blk 171 anymore. if the owners are still in this business, i would like to visit them again. they serve the meal in large, pale pink plates and the cutleries have a red design on them (see 2nd picture). may i get the help of those living around that area or those who knowledgeable about this business, do you know or remember which western food store i am talking about? do you know where they went to subsequently? i would love to know the condition of the western food store now, so even if the owners are no longer doing this business, i would get the closure (no pun intended) i need.

We knew of each others existence for a year but we started talking on a dating app late August. It started very casual. We flirted with each other a lot and at that point I just thought it’s going to be a casual thing. We met up in person, talked a lot, vibed well, and made out. We continued talking and met a second time and that’s when we had sex.

Now here’s the thing, we continued talking to a point where I started getting confused if it’s even casual anymore. As of right now, we’ve been talking for a total of 90 days. We often see each other, at least once a week since we’re both busy. Sometimes, it’s just to talk to each other and watch a movie together, and sometimes it’s just for sex. And I really really like him. We have great conversations and we get along so well. I definitely want him for more than just fooling around. I did ask him what he was looking for about 2 months ago and he said “I don’t know! I got dumped last December and I’m still figuring stuff out! Plus my future is very uncertain since idk where I’ll be getting a job and in what state since I graduated last summer. If I date someone, I wanna give them full of myself and not just half of myself.” I am still in college (we both went to the same one) and I just saw whatever he said as “let’s keep things casual.” And I was fine with it until he started being more lovey dobey and we started meeting on campus at random times to get coffee together.

He had to go to California recently for 5 days, and I told him how I wanna see him before he leaves. He couldn’t see me a day before he left because he was busy but he texted me back that night saying “I’m sorry, I give you permission to double text me or call me if I’m not answering back cuz my phone is always on silent and I’m usually busy doing lab work all day! But I’ll make time for you tomorrow before I leave so we can get coffee together! And please let me pay for your coffee.” We met for coffee, had a good conversation, and he gave me a peck in front of lab mates before I dropped him off, telling me how he’s gonna see me once he’s back.

1p2mxxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/1p2mxxh/would_you_want_a_cannabis_lounge/,Would you want a Cannabis Lounge?,"Hello Denver reddit, I have a dream of opening a cannabis lounge and mainly looking at your city to set up shop. Think bohemian vibe with comfortable seating, rugs, hippie decor, performance stage, coffee and a full cannabis bar with smoke sesh service. Similar to Cirrus that opened recently, I want to have on-site sales but a little more casual. Jazz nights, vinyl record dj, pool tables, I want the place to be a homey space for friends to relax after work or enjoy a night out alcohol free. Without giving away too many details , I have lots of great ideas I want to implement.

Now that you have an understanding of what the business is, I’m looking for any information that the people would like to give me. 

Does Denver want something like this?

I haven’t been able to find a lounge around the country that provides the vibe I want to create alongside on-site sales (most are bring your own cannabis). Something like this could be years in the making but I think as legalization opens up more , these businesses will start popping up quick.

It was built in 1938 and had the handyman special. We went ahead and rewired our kitchen with plans to continue on with the rest of the house. One outlet in our kitchen was problematic and attached to the dishwasher and it would trip the breaker all the time so that’s why we started in the kitchen. The company we hired came out and rewired the kitchen and set the dishwasher up on its own circuit. So the troublesome outlet is on its own, not attached to any other outlet, nothing. All was well for like a year then all the sudden the breaker started tripping again. Guys came back out because warranty and said everything looks good, checked everything over, and changed our breaker, thinking it was faulty. It’s a GFCI breaker. They left and said to call them back if it trips 3 more times and to write down date, time, and what was plugged in when it happened. So after the new year its does it again. It did it with the coffee maker by itself once and twice with coffee maker and air fryer plugged in. They came back out and ran some tests, decided to be cautious and rewired again, new GFCI breaker, new outlet. They said if it trips again it’s my appliances. Surprise, surprise it’s still tripping. New coffee maker and no air fryer anymore. I don’t know what to do. They won’t come again and I understand that. Is the GFCI  breaker super sensitive? What could it be? Should I get a different company out? The previous company rewired our garage and put a breaker box out there and we’ve had absolutely no issues out there. Does anyone here have any ideas… thank you.

After a tree fell on our house in 2023, my partner and I ended up having our tiled shower rebuilt from scratch. The tile installation was completed at least two weeks before we moved back into the house and started using the shower, and it looked fantastic. A week into using the shower, I noticed that the grout around the drain was stained and then basically washed away when I tried to clean it (turns out it was getting stained by drain pipe rust, but I could not find an explanation for its impermanence). That let me to inspect the rest of the grout, and we discovered 20+ holes/gaps in the wall grout that had eroded away in the short time we had been using it. The contractor claimed this was normal (and maybe it is?) and that he would return as often as needed to repair the holes, and we eventually did three rounds of these repairs over the following year.

After the first round of repairs, I noticed that I could run my fingernail or even a wet paper towel down the grout, and a significant amount would come off. The contractor insisted that this was normal because the grout was new and would eventually stop once the ""leftover dust"" all washed down the drain, but it did not, and when I pointed that out, I was told that I should have sealed the grout (we later brought in a grout rep and verified that the grout that was used did NOT need to be sealed), among a dozen other excuses that included the summer heat on the exterior wall ""bringing bubbles to the surface"", the glass penny tiles on the shower floor heating up is affecting the grout, or my favorite: we had been drinking coffee in the shower and that's what caused the rust-colored drain stains. I had to fight for a year to get our contractor to agree to replace it.

I've gotten no official explanation for what went wrong, but I suspect there was too much water added to the grout, so it didn't harden as much as it should have.

Today was finally the day to start that replacement. We were told that an employee would come and remove the grout today, and the owner would replace it the next day. It's important to note that during the assessment, the owner had decided to switch brands and style of grout for the replacement: from Laticrete sanded grout to Custom Building Products Polyblend non-sanded grout. His employee just finished his part of ""removing"" the old grout, but when I inspected it, it is genuinely difficult from a layperson standpoint to tell if the grout is actually removed and ready for a new and different grout. So my questions are:

\- Do these photos look like the grout has been properly removed (we were NOT told that ""removing"" grout actually leaves some behind, so we don't know if this is normal)?

\- Will overlaying non-sanded grout over what's the left of the sanded grout cause any integrity issues?

All I want is for our grout to be a strong as it should be so that I'm not paying to replace it again a few years down the road. Thank you so much for your input.",2,1763692386.0,Tile,3,1.0,False

Hello! I'm searching or a skilled (mediocre+, 2 years minimum) animator for an anime-inspired Soccer game created in Unreal Engine 5.4.2. We're searching for a candidate who's preferably very familiar with soccer/football and who's also familiar with soccer anime, especially Blue Lock.

**Payment Information**

We want to offer a paid opportunity through milestones, formatted in a way to build trust. For example, we have 5 milestones each ranging from $500 to $600. Each milestone has roughly 5 to 6 animations requested. For each new milestone, we'll pay half the amount up-front, then the other half after the work is completed. We'll provide our own IK Character Rig you can make adjustments to as you wish, but please keep the skeleton structure intact. The RevShare portion from the title comes from after we're finished with the 5 milestones. I'm willing to offer no more than 5% RevShare as you'll likely become a foundational animator for the game development team if you wish to continue on this project. You'll be paid through PayPal. The first payment for the first milestone will come as soon as you and I both sign a Statement of Work, an Independent Contractor Agreement, and of course an NDA.

**Current Progress**

For the game, we currently have:

* Basic WASD movement, walking and sprinting
* Stamina System, with rechargable items players can pick up
* Curve-shots, with a custom mechanic not seen in other Soccer/Football games
* Passing, with a custom solution for short lobs and long lobs
* Receiving, with basic Traps and Flicks implemented
* IK Character Rig
* Custom shaders, achieving a Ghibili-like grass system and anime-like character outlines
* A discord server with about 20 people so far wanting to participate in alpha and beta play tests
* And of course, a lot of design documents for the core pillars of our game design strategy, multiplayer networking, and other systems.

**My Previous Work**

I've completed two games in the past on a much, much smaller scale. You're welcome to ask me about them. They're basic platformer games and a small coffee shop game published on Steam.

**Contact Information**

Please message me on discord: itstomtom321. When you first message me, please answer these basic screening questions. I will most likely not respond if you don't.

* What timezone are you in?
* Do you watch and/or enjoy watching soccer?
* Are there any soccer anime you watch?
* Do you have an animation portfolio I can review? If so, please send it. Videos (instead of websites) work fine as well.",2,1763692281.0,INAT,0,1.0,False

1. Specialty (B&W, George Howell, two local roasters and a Fellow Drop once a month) that I grind with an Ode 2 brew with third wave through a V60 and enjoy on slower mornings and weekends  

2. Coffee from Costco (whatever isn’t Kirkland or Starbucks brand) brewed with tap water through the Moccamaster on days I go into the office or get up early. 


After a long stretch of delicious pour overs with specialty coffees my Moccamaster brews have been tasting like burnt ashtrays.  I ran some George Howell Dota through the Moccamaster and it was… good.  I miss the clarity and acidity of the V60 but it was much more enjoyable than the dark roasts that I used to love.  

All that being said, how can I optimize the Moccamaster for lighter washed and natural coffees?  I think water is the first step.  I’ll try a gallon of third wave light roast moving forward.  I’m using a 16:1 ratio and grind around 7 on the Ode 2 (where I’d be at 3 for pourover) with no stirring, blooming, etc.

Sorry Dohee, 

You have nothing going on so there isn’t even anything to diss 

This show is Unpretty, so why didn’t you want to join? 

This was for you but you can’t even take what’s given 

Your words, lyrics, English, can’t do anything alone without ChatGPT

You should also ask GPT to write your diss rap lyrics as well, come on

GPT will reply, 

What? 

\[Its Kwon Dohee’s loss\]

Everyone avoids you during team select, your entire existence is boring

In terms of skills I’m the professor, you’re a trainee 

Beating you is easy, this is a sample taste of the acerbity for you 

Because of me Kwon Dohee will fall into danger, want to escape but I’m above

You should really cut it with the rapper esteem 

If you were that good, you’d have risen to fame already 

Dohee can’t drink coffee anymore, she can’t sleep after losing to me

Welcome actor Choi!

Actor Choi, for today I request yet another charismatic glaring act

Starring diss in shoooot 

Originally a film and theater major Gayoon, I think she’s talented in acting

*(Missed the beat)*

Acting like she’s charismatic, acting like she’s good at rap, our know-it-all Gayoonie

Should’ve been a musical ensemble member instead, there’s no place for you here 

Want me to make you a role? 

Here! A script\~

Told to rap but put on a anger act, wak wak wak wak

Can’t hear what you’re saying, fix that habit of just yelling I’m 

Oh Eun Young

Sit down, good job, calm down, you’re so mad I can’t hear your diction 

Unnie will evaluate your skill for you this is audition 

You still don’t know? Your skills are embarrassing 

Hmm, no matter how hard you try second place among the red heads 

Hmm, after bleaching your hair you’re just Sujin’s shadow in the end

*(Sujin's image is held up)*

*(Gayoon lost to Sujin in 1v1)*

That’s your place, face red ashamed is only Gayoonie 

Our Gayoonie who can’t write lyrics alone, don’t cry, 

There’s a rumor, Choi Gayoon can’t escape YSY’s rap lessons

Even with a ghost writer she can’t deliver, to be faced with me is a bad choice

You need it, an objective view

I’ll confirm it, the difference between me and you

Heard this is your second attempt at ‘princess’

But you still don’t know? Who the Princess is? 

Hey Koko the little girl with black hair

Oh, sorry, you’re not a little girl anymore 

Isn’t it too late for you? I’m still a high schooler 

It’s alright for you to give up 

*(Referring to how Koko’s having a hard time debuting due to her age, 21, which is considered old in the idol industry)* 

Is ‘Princess’ still your dream? You really think you could be her? 

Let’s ask everyone, ‘Who is Princess’? 

(Koko failed to debut in a survival show called Who is Princess before) 

She’s an anime otaku that she thinks she’s the protagonist

But in real life no presence no name like the black criminal 

*(raises up a upside down image of the criminal from Detective Conan)*

*(Detective Conan reference)* 

Go home and sleep shh Good Night 

*(Pun on her name, infantilizing connotations)* 

Instead of listening to unnie’s boring rap I’d rather look in the mirror and play muk-jji-ppa

Rock paper scissors

Rock paper scissors

More fun than Koko’s rap 

Rock paper scissors 

Oh no\~

Are you ok? 

*(Koko comments that there were a lot of moments where she couldn’t understand Youmin’s Japanese)* 

*(YSY says it might have been better for a Japanese contestant to be there instead)* 

*(Youmin can’t speak Japanese and she only chose to be in the Japan 1v1 because she can’t dance due to her leg injury and the other Japanese girls wanted to do dance)* 

**Koko -** 

Youmin, I can’t even think of an idea to diss you with

Because you lack impact 

*(Koko was criticized before for lacking impact)*

Do you wanna be me?

Then show me, uh, you can’t copy me 

Flow that no one has seen before, can you keep up with this maze?

I’ll show you my skill, my unwavering style

The best, the finest, most ideal, the greatest

*(cool alliteration moment)*

Even if it looks similar, it’s a different class, show me what you can do for once

Let’s ask who can do better, even your fans will side with me

But you shiver and mumble when you rap 

Doesn’t makes sense to lose to the worst 

I’ll show you, domain expansion 

*(Jujitsu Kaisen reference)* 

Unified, everyone claps

Even with no primetime youth, right now I’m the ACE

Can’t find sense in your rap 

Go play around there with your rap

Is there anything Youmin knows how to do? 

Hip-hop k-pop she’s bad at both 

You should’ve been good at least one, it’s game over, go home already 

**Niko Seoyoung VS Heeyeon Chaerin**

**Niko & Seoyoung -**

Hello MC Racoon

*(Heeyeon’s representative animal is a racoon)* 

I heard it’s your dream to rap well? 

MC Racoon should I give you these glasses? 

Even with those, you can’t be like me 

Whatever you do, you’re just like a nerd

Late puberty, wake up from your dream I’ll evaluate you 

Your skills are school club level 

Heeyeonie wants the spot next to us, but there’s nothing she can do because she can’t rap 

Who are you to face with us? 

A little puppy who doesn’t know to fear a tiger

*(reference to Seoyoung’s lyrics against Niko in 1v1)* 

We eat Neoguri up in one bite 

*(Neoguri is racoon/Korean ramen brand)*

Slurp slurp 

Hot tears down Heeyeonie’s eyes 

Drip drip 

*(video clip of Heeyeon saying that she'll have to teach something to other contestants)*

She thinks she’s Unnie?! 

Heeyeon, should this Unnie teach you something? 

Only thing Heeyeon can brag about is getting accepted to S-University 

*(Heeyeon goes to Seoul University)* 

Add one to the list, being against me today is your second

The mic looks off in your hands, just stick to pencils like you’ve always done 

What? You wanna be a rapstar? Then sure, copy as I do

MC Raccoon?

No, this kid’s a frog in a well 

*(reference to an old proverb about a frog living in a small well who believe the small wells the entire world, used to describe a person with a limited perspective of the world)* 

MC Raccoon?

No, this kid’s a frog in a well

*(Chaerin says she’s chilling because she received no attacks)*

**Heeyeon & Chaerin -**

Heeyeon Unnie! I want to do rap!

Really? I’m so proud of you!

But wait, if you are going to be like them, you’re going to fail!

6 years as a trainee, Niko and Seoyoung 

*(they both were trainees for a long time)*

What's the use in enduring? Even their company abandons them 

Chaerin, remember, even giving up early is bravery, look at those two, standing there wasting their years 

I got into Seoul University at 18, for you two with a dark future ahead this Unnie will tutor you

Seoyoung Unnie\~

Must have been frustrating to endure the time in the basement 

Got out to see light at this Survival Show, but even then you’re just pretending to be a queen 

Unnie must have wanted to be taller, even your heels aren’t enough that you had to use a chair

Get a reality check 

*(referring to when Seoyoung’s danced on a chair)*

*(Seoyoung is 5’0 and the smallest in this show)*

Niko your frugality is clear to see, because you want to save money on shampoo it's been a whole month of you wearing those braids   

You’re good at dance, rap, and everything 

So how did you still not debut yet?

Niko, do you want to go home after 6 years of training? Huh? Back to Japan? 

To get carried away on stage like a chihuahua that met your eyes, is it ok or not ok? NOT! O! K!

*(Seoyoung referred to herself as a chihuahua in her about me paper)* 

To have a one-man show stage in a team and be the only one that stands out, is that ok or not ok? NOT! O! K!

To only have one single out while being called an artist, is that ok or not ok? NOT! O! K!

To get on the show and just be sitting while playing as a character, is that ok or not ok? NOT! O! K!

Is that ok or not ok? NOT! O! K!

Is that ok or not ok? NOT! O! K!

It's never ok, Chaerin, you got that right? 

Yes! I understand Unnie!

**Yuju VS Yunon**

Everyone, everyone,

Doesn’t have much presence, but she’s ok to watch 

Please take good care of her\~

You know, Yunon? No one knows who you are 

You know Yunon? No one notices your presence without me

Producers! I have a question! Why did you pick her? She lowers the standards (of the show)

A prey left out for Yuju is You, 

Just enjoy it this is the only change you’re going to get

Who remembers? What was your name again? 

Ah that’s right, 

The one who lost to Yuju!

Your diss rap lyrics are so predictable, “ForTh sUrVivaL sHoW”

*(this is Yuju’s fourth survival show)* 

Three times of failure? No. 

Three times the growth. The fourth time will testify 

As your senior I will let you know,

You’re not good. 

Hey, who’s cuter? 

Of course, Yuju’s cuter 

Go back to your home in To. k. yo

Eliminated must leave, go this road

*(reference to Yunon’s cypher)* 

This is my autograph, you should take it and go brag about it 

*(Seohyun rips paper)*

Yunon - 

Hello! 

This is Nam Yuju featuring at yet *another* survival show!

Audition, audition, audition, audition, 

*(Yunon team holds up contestant images of Juju's 3 Mnet survival shows and a drawing of one non-Mnet survival show)*

The burning gaze of everyone looking at Yuju 

Think of your past, Izna

Yuju’s debut confirmed, is not 

*(Yuju was in a survival show that debuted Izna)*

On this ring is David and Goliath, even if the difference is huge everyone knows

People watching say Yunon is the underdog, just as they say I’ll bite your throat 

Like this, even after 50 years, you’d be on your 54th survival show 

Who’s side would you look the best next to? You’ll never be main, your life forever a side character 

Fourth time!

Fourth time!

Nam Yuju’s re-re-re-try 

Fourth time!

Fourth time!

I just got home the other day and I walked into the apartment being a mess. The kitchen had dried food caked onto the counters, dog hair stuck to the baseboards around the apartment. The bathroom was horrendous. The toilet had not been cleaned once since I was gone. I wiped the coffee table down and the Clorox wipe was black afterwards. I asked my husband genuinely when the last time he cleaned and he said a week before I came home. I know for a fact that’s a bold face lie because it doesn’t get that bad in a week. And I cried, I had just spent the last 8 months of my life training nonstop. Working long hours and having to deal with military shit. I didn’t want to have to deep clean then minute I got home and my husband doesn’t understand why I’m so upset. I genuinely don’t understand what to do with him. I was hoping the place would’ve been good to go by the time I got home, but it became his trash dump while I was gone. ",9,1763692168.0,LifeAdvice,9,0.85,False

The good: thumb keys are a revelation, Home Row Mods ftw, and QMK is awesome. The bad: the learning curve is brutal, the mental overhead for coding is exhausting, and the build quality is aggressively just okay.

# Why would you do this to yourself? What's the point?

I got these questions a lot in various forms. And they are fair, to be honest. I frequently looked down at the Planck and asked myself the very same questions.

Some of you are already deep into this hobby and already use keyboards that most people would consider unusable abominations. You already get it. Those who aren't/don't... this review is for you.

There *are* reasons, but to understand them, we first need to start thinking about keyboards a bit differently. Let's begin by stepping down to 60% and slaying a sacred cow: the arrow keys.

# Fuck Arrow Keys

That's right, I said it. Go ahead: gasp, boo, hiss, clutch your fucking pearls.

To be clear, this isn't about *not having or using navigation features*: we all need to move the cursor around somehow. What you don't need are *dedicated* arrow keys.

Many of you are sitting in front of a standard full-size or TKL keyboard right now. These are very straightforward: if you want F5, you reach up and press the F5 key; if you want Print Screen, you reach over and press the Print Screen key. If you want the cursor to move up a line, you reach over and press the ↑ key. Easy peasy.

Here's a new way of thinking about this, though: all that reaching around the keyboard for different keys isn't just inefficient, it's poor ergonomics. What if the most critical functions were always right under your fingers on the home row?

Stop reaching and start chording.

This isn't groundbreaking: cut, copy, and paste are indispensable features that have never had dedicated keys on any standardized modern layout. You don't reach across the keyboard for a key, you *chord* Ctrl (or Cmd) + X, C, or V. Your fingers never leave the 40% portion of the keyboard. We're just applying that same logic to the arrow keys.

This principle isn't even new. Gamers discovered this decades ago with the rise of first-person shooters and keyboard-mouse controls: you need your right hand on the mouse for aiming, but the arrow keys are *also* on the right. The solution was `WASD` as arrows. By moving navigation to the left hand's home position, they freed up the right hand for the mouse. While our goal isn't landing headshots, the core lesson is the same: putting essential navigation in a comfortable position under your fingers instead of chasing dedicated keys across the board is a massive win for efficiency. We're just applying that battle-tested wisdom to everyday typing.

Next, take a look at your Caps Lock key: it's a useless little bitch taking up prime home row real estate. With the magic of programmable mechanical keyboards, we can transform it into a key that opens up a layer with things like Enter, Backspace, Delete, and yes, even arrow keys, all right on the home row. You don't even need to buy a new keyboard to experiment with this: all you need is access to VIA or Vial.

This advice isn't for everyone, of course. Some people don't want any challenge at all from their keyboard, just something nice to type on. That's fine. For those of us willing to experiment, yes, it takes a little elbow grease to get there. Yes, it takes some retraining of your muscle memory... but for serious typists, the payoff can be significant. And fun to configure!

# The Keyboard Dark Arts

I'm a 60% user at heart. That's my sweet spot. The thought of using anything smaller as a daily driver is extremely unappealing, to put it nicely: I write a fair amount of code, and I need easy access to numbers and symbols. At the same time, I don't need anything larger. I appreciate the more compact form factor and the extra desk space, and (as you can probably tell) I vastly prefer home row navigation to dedicated arrow keys. A 60% keyboard has all the keys I need and none that I don't.

So why did I buy a 40% keyboard? An ortholinear one, no less? No, seriously, why the fuck would someone who writes code buy a keyboard that doesn't have dedicated keys for numbers or critical symbols like `\`, -, =, \[, \], \`?

To the wider world, where to find the ""missing"" keys on a 60% layout is a solved problem with several freely available solutions. Take the HHKB-style arrow keys `[;'/`, accessed via a Function key made from splitting right Shift. This ""solution"" always felt hacky to me (see what I did there?). It forces an awkward reach for the pinky to anchor on the Fn key, then requires you to pivot your hand to hit the arrows. Need Page Up? That's an even deeper, more strained reach, all while your pinky is held hostage.

If your goal is saving desk space or achieving a certain aesthetic, that may be a workable solution; but if the goal is maximizing speed and ergonomics, this ain't it.

I (and many others) figured that a better solution was hiding in plain sight on the *other side of the board*: the prime, underutilized real estate of the dumbfuck Caps Lock key. By turning it into a layer key instead, I could get true home-row navigation with `IJKL` with no pinky strain. That simple idea quickly snowballed. I pulled in other essentials like Backspace, Delete, Enter, and modifiers to where I could reach with my left hand, building an entire layer that was not just a workaround for missing keys, but a genuine ergonomic upgrade over the standard positions of many keys I *did* have. I almost never, for example, use my Backspace key anymore: Caps Lock + `d` for Backspace is faster and more ergonomic.

My setup was good, but I was stuck in a rut. I knew it could be better. I wanted my home row to do more, but I had also reached the limits of my knowledge and capacity with the Vial software.

To get to the next level, I needed to go back to school. I saw the Planck as a ticket out of my comfort zone: a masterclass in constraint-driven design. By stripping away so many keys and adding thumb keys to (somewhat) compensate, the Planck forces you to fundamentally reconsider core aspects of the layout. Where does Enter go? Backspace? Where's the fucking right Shift? How do you remember where all the symbols are‽‽

There are no easy answers, no one-size-fits-all solution. Not even close. The only way is a descent into the keyboard dark arts: the world of QMK, aka Quantum Mechanical Keyboard. This isn't just remapping keys and adding layers, it's an entire programming language for your keyboard. We're talking tap-hold and double/triple-tap timing intricacies, leader sequences that turn your keyboard into a command line, dynamic on-the-fly custom macros, and layering schemes so complex they'd make an Inception architect's head spin. The result is a layout that is custom-fitted like leather to each typist.

I call these skills the ""keyboard dark arts"" because they are the kinds of things no sane person using a standard layout would ever want or need... but it's that knowledge and those skills that I was after. The Planck wasn't just another keyboard to add to my collection: it was an internship, a trial by fire in these dark arts. A vision quest.

And this, my friends, is the crux of my reasoning for buying the Planck: sometimes you have to break something down to understand how to build it back up better and stronger. I knew going in that this would be painful. I knew I'd hate it. But to truly maximize the potential of the 60%, I needed to step completely outside my comfort zone—I needed a keyboard that would force me to question assumptions and teach me the art of QMK.

And that's exactly what the Planck did.

# The Review Part of the Review

Look, I'm not going to reinvent the wheel here talking about the Planck's build quality—plenty of people have already beaten that horse to death. But since you're here, you get my takes anyway.

The build quality is aggressively meh... but so is the price, so I wasn't expecting much to begin with. The sound profile out of the box is, to put it politely, quite bad: hollow, metallic, and clangy. The foams helped considerably, but we're still a far cry from ""good"" as some hollowness and clanginess lingers.

One gripe I will bring up is that the board has ""eaten"" a fair number of switches, meaning they never came off the plate in one piece. They were in so tight that the switch housings came apart rather than just come loose. At one point, attempting to remove a single switch resulted in the plate and PCB separating entirely, with every other switch being yanked out of their hotswap sockets and pulled up with the plate in the process. What the honest to god fuck?? Two thumbs down there. Get your shit together, Drop.

I tried both the POM and steel plates before settling on BSUN Maple Sugar switches on the steel plate. I used Drop's Jasmin MT3 Ortho keycaps with a green case. The result is decently attractive and a reasonably good typing experience—and that's coming from someone who's already quite picky. It's not going to blow anyone's mind, but even if you're a bit of a snob like me, it (barely) passes muster.

Now, let's dive into the meat of this review: what I loved and hated about living with the Planck.

# The Good Stuff

Let's cover what I really liked about the Planck. It wasn't all frustrations and typos.

**Thumb Keys Are the Light and the Way**

Seriously, having so many keys for my thumbs instead of one giant spacebar is fucking *brilliant*. I love it. Hands down my single favorite feature of the Planck.

I put a 2U spacebar on the right, since I almost exclusively hit Space with my right thumb. It was the perfect size—no more, no less than I needed. (My brief, disastrous experiment with a single-wide spacebar proved that.)

Think about it: your thumbs are incredibly agile and dexterous, yet on a standard keyboard one of them hits a single giant spacebar, usually in the same general spot, while the other floats around doing absolutely nothing. What a waste of real estate and talent!

Anticipating (correctly) a steep learning curve with a ton of errors, I put Backspace and Delete as left-handed thumb keys. And it was fucking *glorious!*

With a traditional Backspace, when you make a mistake, you have to lift your right hand off the home row, reach over to the Backspace key, fix the error, then return to home. It's a constant, if minor, interruption to your flow if you have fat fingers. But with Backspace under my left thumb? I could correct errors instantly without ever breaking stride. My right hand stayed planted on the home row while my left thumb handled all the cleanup. I could even hold Raise with my right thumb, right next to the Spacebar, to turn those keys into ""delete next/previous word.""

The ergonomics are night and day better. No stretching, no reaching, no breaking your wrist position. It's one of those features that sounds minor on paper but transforms the entire typing experience once you've lived with it.

Fuck a giant spacebar, why isn't this standard?

Manufacturers, take note: give us more split spacebars, you cowards!

**It's Fun to Configure**

While using the Planck does feel sometimes like solving a damn Rubik's cube, the actual process of iterating over the layers and configuration is surprisingly fun. Type 2 fun, maybe, but fun nonetheless.

Here's the thing: I'm the type of person who gets genuinely excited about optimizing systems. I'll spend hours refactoring code just to make it more elegant. The Planck tapped into that same part of my brain in a way my 60% boards never could.

With standard layouts, customization feels like rearranging furniture in a house someone else designed. You're mostly just remapping a few existing keys—maybe swapping Caps Lock for Control, swapping modifier positions to accommodate macOS vs Windows, or putting media controls under a function layer. It's useful, but it's not *creative*. There's no real *need* to rethink where Backspace goes because its default location, while arguably suboptimal, is okay.

The Planck, on the other hand, is a blank canvas with insane constraints.

Every key placement becomes a deliberate choice. Where do you put Enter when there's no dedicated place for it? Do you give up easy access to `'""` to put it on the home row, or do you move it down to share a key with Shift? What are the timing settings that allow Shift and Enter to share a key seamlessly for how I personally type so I'm not constantly sending incomplete messages? Or maybe we should leave Shift alone and Enter could be a thumb key? Each decision cascades into others, creating this intricate web of interdependent choices.

Every iteration felt like solving a design problem. I'd identify a pain point—say, I couldn't find underscore reliably, or I was having trouble accessing `Cmd+[` to un-indent code—then experiment with different solutions. Each solution would work for a while, then reveal new problems that needed solving.

It's the same dopamine hit I get from debugging a particularly gnarly piece of code or finally cracking a math problem that's been stumping me. The difference is that this puzzle was *mine*—every solution was tailored to my specific typing and workflow quirks.

That iterative process of problem-solving and refinement? That's where the real magic happened.

Which leads me into my next point...

**QMK Is the Shiiiiiiiiit**

Vial is good, but getting my hands dirty with QMK was a revelation in what's possible with a simple keyboard. This is the heart of the ""dark keyboard arts"" I was chasing.

If Vial is a moped that gets you around town, then QMK is a stripped-down Formula 1 car: insanely powerful, infinitely customizable, but demanding serious skill to master. If Vial is a Swiss Army knife, QMK is a fully-equipped machine shop where you can forge any tool you need... assuming you know how to operate a lathe.

I was resistant at first, sticking to the online QMK Configurator and avoiding the C code... but that was a mistake. Once I dove in, I was hooked. The result is my [QMK userspace repository](https://github.com/ohshitgorillas/qmk_userspace), containing all my code, keymaps, and even a few community module contributions. For a detailed breakdown of the layout that resulted from this experiment, see the [layout README](https://github.com/ohshitgorillas/qmk_userspace/blob/main/layouts/planck_1x2uR/ohshitgorillas/README.md).

This experience cemented a new rule for me: no more non-QMK keyboards. I was seriously considering a Neo60 Cu until I realized I couldn't load it with QMK. That's a dealbreaker now. Having tasted the raw power of what a keyboard *can* be, I can't go back.

**Comically Small**

Finally, this thing is hilariously small. I have a fairly large desk with ample space for a full-sized board, so this thing just looks completely absurd in my setup. It makes my 60% boards feel like battleships. It's only twice the size of my damn mouse. My watch's strap is longer than this thing is wide. It's ridiculous!

This translates to awesome portability. Tossing it in a bag would be an afterthought, and while I never took it anywhere, it would be the perfect coffee shop or travel board. You can have a decent typing experience on the go without lugging around a 15-pound block of aluminum and copper.

But for a die-hard ortho user, that portability is more than just convenience. While your brain can store multiple keyboard layouts, it can only have one proficiently loaded into your RAM at a time. You cannot simply switch back-and-forth from ortho to staggered—it takes time and a storm of frustrating typos to readjust your muscle memory. For anyone fully committed to the ortho lifestyle, being able to bring your board with you on-the-go is a necessity.

# The Bad Stuff

Alright, let's get into the bullshit. It wasn't all fun and games, and some parts of this experiment were genuinely infuriating.

**The Humbling Experience of Typing Like an Idiot**

There's no way to sugarcoat this: learning an ortholinear layout from scratch is a deeply humbling experience. You have to commit to being a shitty typist for a while, and it fucking sucks.

Your muscle memory is actively working against you, turning every word into a battle. The bottom row is by far the worst offender because all of the keys are a half-unit off from where your fingers expect them. Every time I went to type a `c`, I'd hit `v` or `x` at the same time. The result was a constant stream of typos like `I really fuxcking sucvk at this`.

Even after three weeks, I was pretty good, but never fully got comfortable. On Monkeytype, with just lowercase words, I clawed my way back to a respectable 110 WPM. But the moment I had to introduce punctuation—and note the lack of dedicated dash or parenthesis keys—you can take another 30 WPM off. Numbers? Cut the speed in half and double the errors. Outside of that, there were endlessly frustrating series of cascading mistakes: *Oops, that's a typo, where's th... oh, fuck, did I just hit tab? Undo that too. Oh my god, did I just escape out? Ok, restore foc... argh... there, focus restored. And now ba.. NO, NOT FORWARD DELETE, BACKSPACE. FUCKING FUCK.*

Could I have given it more time and gotten back to full proficiency? Probably. But after three weeks, I felt I'd learned what I needed to and was ready to go back home to my 60s.

Those of you who main these kinds of keyboards? Kudos, seriously. You have more patience, grit, and skill than I do. My 'internship' was difficult enough; I simply cannot imagine using something like this as a daily driver.

**The Constant Mental Overhead is Exhausting**

Beyond the physical clumsiness, the mental load of using the Planck for any real work was significant. A standard keyboard is transparent; you don't *think* about where the keys are, you just type. The Planck was the opposite: a constant puzzle I had to solve just to get my thoughts onto the screen.

It may sound minor, but the constant cognitive friction of going, ""*Okay, there's the dash, tap tap tap, and now there's the open parenthesis, and... no, backspace, now here's the... fuck, that's not it either, THERE's the open parenthesis... tap, tap, tap... now we need an underscore... ope, wrong layer, here's the underscore*"" takes its toll. All those little micro-interruptions are murder on your flow state. When you're deep in a coding problem or trying to articulate a complex idea, the last thing you want is to be derailed by figuring out where the fuck you put F7.

While by the end I was quite fast with a few symbols—mostly `-, _, !, =`—the rest presented a constant mental load with frequent misfires. It wasn't until I switched back to my 60%s that I realized just how draining that was: the feeling of simply hitting number and symbol keys without a second thought was remarkably freeing.

**It's Cheap (and That's Okay)**

Let's be clear: the Planck is an entry-level board, and at $99 for the base kit, the price is fair. It wouldn't have made any sense for me to drop $500 on a keyboard intended as an educational detour. I needed a tool for a temporary job, and for that, the Planck was a great choice. It delivered a decent typing experience for my ""internship"" without breaking the bank.

That being said, coming from a premium board like the Luminkey LX60 Copper Edition—whose kit cost three times the Planck's—or even the KBDfans Tofu60 2.0, the difference is stark. These are admittedly unfair comparisons, but it's what I have, and it highlights what you give up at this price point.

The main thing is the feel. I'm used to keyboards that could double as bludgeoning tools. My Tofu60 2.0 is also a budget board, but it's a dense block of aluminum and brass that feels like a serious instrument. The Planck, by contrast, feels like a toy.

While its weight, or lack thereof, is a huge plus for portability, it feels flimsy and insubstantial at a proper workstation. It slides around and sounds like complete ass without foams (and still not great with). For someone who appreciates the tactile and aesthetic presence of a well-built keyboard, it was a constant, if mild, disappointment.

# So, What Did I Learn?

This whole experiment was about pushing my boundaries and seeing what was on the other side. The Planck was a difficult, frustrating, and ultimately successful teacher. Here's what I'm taking with me:

**The Power of QMK**

QMK is not just about remapping keys and layers. It's not just having your keyboard arrange the modifiers properly based on what operating system it's connected to. It's a fundamental reimagining of what a keyboard can do. It's about transforming a static input device into a dynamic partner that you can teach to handle your most common and tedious tasks. It's about outsourcing the boring parts of typing to your keyboard's firmware so your brain can focus on what matters.

Take the Leader key. I've taught my keyboard my personal and work email addresses. Now, instead of typing them out, I just hit `Leader` `(P/W)` `E` `M`, and the keyboard does it for me. I've even taught it how to tOgGle aUToMated spONGEBOB mOckiNg TExt mOdE (`Leader` `S` `M`), because why the fuck not?

This extends to automating common formatting. With my [implementation of xcase](https://github.com/ohshitgorillas/qmk-xcase), I can tell my keyboard to turn spaces into underscores, hyphens, or any other character on the fly. Need to type an obnoxiously long file path? `Leader` `X` `C` `/`, and suddenly all/of/my/spaces/turn/into/slashes.

And finally, there's user-defined automatic typo correction. With autocorrect running at the firmware level, my keyboard knows I'm a dumbass who types 'teh' a dozen times a day and just fixes it for me, everywhere. You know what's even better than a thumb Backspace? *Not needing to hit Backspace at all.*

*That's* the real power of QMK. It’s a toolkit for building a keyboard that becomes a true extension of your own mind—one that anticipates your needs and handles the grunt work for you.

**Mastering Dual-Key Timing is a Superpower**

This was the holy grail for me. I'd struggled in Vial to get a dual-function Caps Lock key that worked reliably—one that could serve as a lightning-fast layer key on hold but still function as a normal Caps Lock on tap. It just wasn't possible; there was too much overlap between tapping and holding. I eventually settled for turning Caps Lock into a dedicated layer key, with the literal Caps Lock feature accessed via holding Caps Lock and hitting the spacebar. It was functional, but not great.

As it turns out, solving this problem required the full arsenal of QMK's advanced timing features. Nailing the precise combination of `TAPPING_TERM`, `HOLD_ON_OTHER_KEY_PRESS`, and `RETRO_TAPPING` felt like cracking a code. The result is flawless: I can trigger the layer in tens of milliseconds for rapid-fire Backspace from the home row *and* reliably activate Caps Lock on a tap. No misfires, ever.

This single victory made the entire painful experiment worth it.

**Home Row Mods FTW**

This is a genuine revelation and one of those 'out of the box' ideas that I may never have been exposed to had I not picked up the Planck. Having modifiers on the home row keys is a massive ergonomic and efficiency boost, and I'm never going back.

For those who are unfamiliar, here's the gist. Each of your eight home keys (`ASDF` and `JKL;`) has two jobs: when you tap it, it prints the character; when you hold it, it acts as a modifier. For my keyboards, `A` and `;` are Ctrl, `S` and `L` are Opt, `D` and `K` are Cmd, and `F` and `J` are Shift.

If this sounds like a horrific idea that would interrupt your typing flow constantly... you're not wrong. Getting the timing right requires some finesse—your keyboard needs to reliably distinguish between a tap and a hold. For Ctrl, Opt, and Cmd (or Alt and Win, if you will), this is relatively straightforward. Shift, however, is a different beast and entirely dependent on how you type. Since Shift is used so frequently mid-typing flow, the timing requirements become incredibly precise. Unless you're willing to invest significant time fine-tuning the settings to match your exact typing rhythm and speed, I'd recommend avoiding Shift as a Home Row Mod except for consistency with chording.

Even ignoring Shift, think about how often you use modifiers. Every copy, paste, and shortcut requires you to contort your fingers into an unnatural position to reach Ctrl or Cmd. Home Row Mods eliminate that entirely. The modifiers are already right under your fingers at all times. Instead of reaching down for Command with one hand and tapping `C` with the other, I just hold `K` and tap `C`. It's faster, more comfortable, and dramatically reduces hand strain. It's one of those changes that feels so right, you'll wonder how you ever tolerated the old way.

**The Nuance of ABS in MT3**

I do not like shined keycaps—the 'stickiness' bothers me, I prefer my fingers to glide over the keycaps—so I've always stayed away from ABS. Give me a fresh, rough-ish batch of PBT any day.

For this board, I broke that rule and went with Drop's Jasmin MT3 keycaps in ABS. I was mostly curious about the MT3 profile, and I figured I wouldn't use the board enough to fully shine the caps by the time my ""internship"" was over.

The keycaps are starting to smooth out, but are still in good shape.

And I'm a big fan of MT3. The scooping is super comfy. And honestly? The profile makes the shine less of an issue for me. I think it's the fact that the scooping gives the key some texture regardless of shining. I could see myself running a set of MT3 ABS until I could see my own reflection in them. I'd still prefer to see Drop offer more MT3 in PBT, but I'm no longer an absolutist.

**60% is My Home**

This experiment solidified it for me. The Planck was a fun, educational, and occasionally infuriating detour, but 60% is where I belong. I need my number keys, and I need a layout that doesn't make me feel like I'm solving a fucking puzzle to type a backslash.

The Planck, again, was a vision quest. It forced me to learn, adapt, and master new skills. It taught me the true power of QMK and revealed the ergonomic benefits of Home Row Mods, as well as how to master tap-hold timing for the Caps Lock key. I'm returning to my 60% boards not because the Planck was bad, but because it succeeded in giving me the knowledge I needed to break out of my rut and make my preferred layout even better (the current state of which can be found [here](https://github.com/ohshitgorillas/qmk_userspace/blob/main/layouts/60_ansi_tsangan_split_bs_rshift/ohshitgorillas/README.md)). I'm glad to be back, but I'm also grateful for the journey.

This post is a breakdown of what actually works. No generic “just be confident” nonsense. No TikTok hacks from influencers who’ve never felt social anxiety in their life. Just evidence-based tips, real tools, and some advice from researchers, authors, and social dynamics nerds who’ve studied this stuff for decades.

If you’re introverted, awkward, or just tired of feeling like the weird quiet one, this is for you.

Here’s what’s helped the most:

1. **Stop trying to be interesting. Be interested instead.**  
Harvard psychologist Dr. Robert Waldinger (from the famous 80-year Harvard Study of Adult Development) emphasized that deep connection starts with genuine curiosity. People naturally bond with those who seem fascinated by them. Ask about their experiences, not just surface facts. Replace “What do you do?” with “What made you get into that line of work?” or “What’s been the highlight of your week?” Small shift. Big energy boost.

2. **Use the “FORD” framework to never run out of things to say.**  
This comes from communication trainer Vanessa Van Edwards. “FORD” = Family, Occupation, Recreation, Dreams. These four categories unlock dozens of conversation paths. Get the other person talking about any of these areas, and you’ll build rapport fast without needing to overshare or perform. It’s my go-to cheat code now.

3. **Remember: Awkward silences feel 10x worse in your head.**  
Social psychologist Dr. Gillian Sandstrom found that most people overestimate how awkward they come off. People actually enjoy conversations with strangers *more* than they expect. Your “weird pauses” aren’t as visible as you think. Chill. Give the convo room to breathe.

4. **Don’t aim for chemistry. Aim for rhythm.**  
Chemistry is rare. Rhythm is learnable. In her TED Talk, Celeste Headlee (author of “We Need to Talk”) says the best conversations are like a dance. It’s back and forth. You speak, then let space for reaction. Get out of monologue mode. No one wants to be lectured. They want to feel seen.

5. **Leverage “mirroring” – but don’t make it creepy.**  
This is a powerful principle from Chris Voss, former FBI hostage negotiator. In his book *Never Split The Difference*, he teaches mirroring as repeating the last 1–3 words the other person said in a curious tone. It subconsciously builds trust. Example:  
Them: “I started learning pottery lately.”  
You: “Pottery lately?”  
Them: “Yeah, I’ve always wanted to do something tactile after spending all day on screens…”  
Boom. A real convo just opened up.

6. **Introverts actually have a superpower: deep presence. Use it.**  
Susan Cain’s *Quiet* (a TIME Top 10 Book of the Year) transformed how people view introversion. Cain argues that introverts actually make better listeners, which leads to more meaningful conversations. You don’t need to dominate the room. You just need to show up with full attention. That’s rare these days.

7. **Try to make learning social skills as addictive as TikTok.**  
Train your social muscles like you’d train at the gym. I started using the app **Charisma on Command**. It gamifies conversation skills, with mini challenges like starting convos with strangers or practicing eye contact in low-stakes situations. Doing 10 minutes a day totally shifted my baseline confidence. It’s like Duolingo for people-ing.

8. **I recommend checking out the app BeFreed.**  
It’s an AI-powered audio learning app built by a team from Columbia University. You pick your learning goals (like communication skills, confidence, or leadership), and it creates a personalized audio plan using summaries from books, expert interviews, and real-world examples. The coolest part? You can choose your preferred podcast length (10, 20 or 40 minutes), and even the host’s voice and personality. Mine sounds like a chill therapist-meets-standup comic.

What makes it addictive is that it actually learns from my listening history and updates my learning roadmap weekly. It’s like having a personal AI coach who knows you better than your friends. BeFreed has deep libraries on everything we talked about here — from Susan Cain’s *Quiet*, to Dale Carnegie’s *How to Win Friends*, to modern relationship science podcasts. 

And swapping 10 minutes of doomscrolling for this has had a crazy compounding effect. One year later, I don’t panic at networking events. I actually *like* talking to people now.

9. **If you only read one social skills book, make it this one.**  
*The Like Switch* by ex-FBI agent Jack Schafer is hands-down the best book I’ve ever read on human connection. Schafer was trained to get people to talk even in life-or-death interrogations. This book breaks down human behavior in a way that instantly made me go “Ohh…so *that’s* why that convo felt off.” It’s filled with practical tools like the “friendship formula,” the “lip corner pull” cue, and how to nonverbally make someone feel safe around you. This book will make you question everything you think you know about charisma. Insanely good read.

10. **If you love podcasts, this one blew my mind.**  
*The Art of Charm* podcast used to feel like your standard bro-y self-help thing, but it’s now hosted by smart behavioral experts breaking down things like nervous system regulation, small talk anxiety, and how to build professional relationships from scratch. Ep #567 on “Social Cold Starts” is a must-listen if you freeze up at parties or meetings.

11. **Best YouTube channel for social anxiety recovery?**  
**Improvement Pill** is packed with helpful, science-backed visuals on habit change, confidence, and leveling up social skills one tiny step at a time. It’s not cringey or preachy. Just really solid content that makes you go “Why wasn’t I taught this in school?”

12. **Start with just 1% of courage. Don’t aim to be extroverted.**  
Dr. Andrew Huberman calls this the “activation energy” principle. You don’t need to rewrite your personality. Just do one brave thing per day — talk to a stranger, raise your hand, say that joke you’d normally swallow. It’s like social pushups. You build tolerance by doing hard things in small doses.

If you’ve ever walked away from a convo and re-played every weird thing you said, you’re not alone. But the best-kept secret? Most people are too busy worrying about *their own* weirdness to notice yours. And the most magnetic people aren’t the loudest — they’re the ones who make others feel heard. Which is something anyone can learn.",1,1763691737.0,OdysseyBookClub,0,1.0,False

1p2mlci,https://i.redd.it/ch9vyorxsi2g1.jpeg,Is this quote accurate or should I look for 2nd opinions?,"I recently went to the dentist for the first time in about 10 years. I know, bad. I had some anxiety around the dentist in general, but mainly I was just too poor and didn’t have insurance. 

I have insurance now, but of course it only covers routine cleanings.  (And yes, I drink coffee, drink alcohol, and vape. I know. That’s never gonna help my case). 

I was really pleased with this office I went to and how they treated me. After my initial exam they said I do need 4 crowns on my 4 front teeth. I’m no doctor, but yes, obviously I do. I was quoted about $3000. They did not pressure me at all, but my question: is this the standard price for 4 crowns? I imagine it is. But would appreciate any input. 

I unfortunately just can’t afford to do this. Follow up question if you’d be so kind to answer, has care credit worked for you? Any input on that? I can afford a monthly payment, if it’s not outrageous. However, I currently have not the greatest credit score. So there’s that. 

Just looking for any advice. I’d really love to feel comfortable with my smile again because I’m embarrassed now.

1p2mg9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1p2mg9q/hr_voidberg/,[HR] Voidberg,"Moises Maloney sat mid-afternoon in a cafe with several other cops, one of whom was a rookie. They were eating donuts and drinking coffee. One of the other cops said to Moises, “Hey, Maloney, why don't you tell the kid about Voidberg,” then asked the rookie, “Kid, you heard about Voidberg?” The rookie said, “No, I never heard about Voidberg. What's Voidberg?” and he looked at Moises Maloney, who finished chewing a chunk of his Baston Cream donut and said:

Once upon a time when I was just a little past being a rookie myself, I got a call to go out to Central Dark to deal with a pervert, *a flasher,* you know, one of those weirdos who runs around in a trenchcoat with nothing underneath exposing himself to strangers. In this case it was multiple calls that had come in. The guy was apparently exposing himself to children, upset one of them, who ran to his parents, who put a call in to the cops.

“The flasher was Voidberg?”

“Yeah.”

“Why was he—”

“I'll get to that,” said Moises, taking a drink of coffee.

“Let him tell the story, kid,” said one of the other cops, a thick-necked red-headed Irishman, who was barely chewing his donuts before swallowing them.

Moises Maloney continued:

So we get these calls and it's pretty clear someone has to go down there, but nobody wants to do it, so we draw straws and I get the short straw, so me and my partner at the time, Gustaffson (“Man, Gustaffson… rest his soul.”) get in our car and drive down there, but it's in the Dark itself, and it's a flasher, not a shooter, so we don't drive into the Dark but park outside and walk in.

Both of us are expecting the flasher's going to be long gone by now, because usually they get their jollies off and beat it, before one or other of the unassuming strangers they've exposed themselves to decides fuck that and beats their face in, and in this case there's parents involved, so forget about it, right? Well, wrong. Because even before we get there—and we're not walking very fast, mind you—we hear these short, wailing screams, just awful sounds. We think, what the fuck is going on? And it's not the same person screaming, so we know it's not the flasher getting beat. One scream, one voice, the next scream, another voice. And they're all so unfinished, like someone's taking an axe to these screams, hacking them in half before they've been fully expressed, and the unfinished half is shoving itself back down the screamer's throat, shutting them up. Never heard anything like it before.

The first person we see is this woman walking in the opposite direction from us, with two crying kids following her. They keep saying mom, mom, mom, but she's not even reacting, just walking like a fucking zombie. When she passes us I see her eyes: they're just *dead.* I say something to her—don't remember what—but I already know she's not gonna respond. She walks by us, the kids walk by us, and I look over at Gustaffson, who shrugs, but we draw our weapons because we don't know what the hell is going on.

That's how we come to the hill.

Central Dark's a big place and we're in this part where people like to hang out on the grass. There's the hill, which is usually pretty busy, and on the other side's a small playground, which is where the calls reported the flasher being. Today, the hill is empty. And we don't have to walk across it to get to the flasher—who, remember, we think is long gone—because he's right fucking there: on the top of the hill.

All around the hill's a group of people looking up at him, and he's pacing and turning round and round, dressed in a grey trench, like your stereotypical pervert. Some of the crowd's turned away, so they have their backs to him. Others are covering their kids eyes. The kids are crying. There are maybe six or seven adults walking like zombies, like the woman who passed us. And every once in a while somebody runs up the hill to get to the flasher, and he flashes them and they just stop, drop and curl up. Fetal position, like whatever they've seen's pushed them back through time and they're as helpless as infants.

Gustaffson shouts, ‘Police!’

Most of the people surrounding the hill look over at us, and we're not sure what to do. The flasher doesn't acknowledge us, but he's not armed, so I don't want to run up the hill pointing my gun at him, because that's gonna be a world of paperwork, so I say, ‘Hey, buddy—you up on the hill there. My name's Moises Maloney and me and my partner here are with the NZPD. You wanna come down off that hill and talk to us?’ He doesn't answer but starts laughing, and not in a happy way but like he's being forced to laugh, you know? Like he's a hyena and it's his nature to make a sound that sounds like laughter but really isn't laughter. If anything, he looks and sounds lost, confused, cornered He's not attacking anyone or even aggressively flashing them or anything. It's more defensive. Somebody runs up the hill, he flashes them to keep them away. Keep in mind he's surrounded too. He can't get off the hill. Anyway, I'm thinking he's a mental case, which jibes with him flashing random strangers in the Dark.

‘We're not here to hurt you,’ Gustaffson yells to him, and he means it. Gustaffson was a stand-up guy. For a second it seems the flasher's thinking of coming down to us. The crowd's gone silent. He's at least stopped spinning round, so now he's just standing there with his hands on his trench, making sure it stays closed.

Then we hear a gunshot—and all hell breaks loose—people start screaming, scattering, no idea whee the shot came from, until four cops come running in from the other side of the Dark. Gustaffson looks at me. I look at the cops. NZPD unfiorms, but I’ve never seen any of them before. We try to get their attention, but they don't care about anything except the flasher, who's gone bug-eyed and is spinning again on the top of the hill, and I think, well, fuck, there goes our chance of talking him down. Not that I think it for long, because these other cops, they run through the crowd and start firing at the flasher. No warning, no hesitation, just ***bang bang bang.***

That puts the flasher into a real frenzy, and rightly so because he's getting fucking shot at.

Gustaffson strats yelling, ‘He's unarmed! He's unarmed!’ as I get over to the closest of the four cops, who tells me, ‘He doesn't have a gun but he's dangerous!’ and ‘Come on, help us nail this freak!’

But I'm not about to shoot an unarmed mental case, and I'm already imagining what I'll say in my defense, but also, as far as I know, these other cops don't have any authority over us, and Gustaffson's not shooting.

The cop who was talking to me shakes his head and runs after the other three cops, who are now chasing the flasher, taking shots, missing. It's a goddamn farce. It looks ridiculous, except they have real guns and they're trying to kill somebody. That's when one of them says it: ‘It's over, Voidberg. You're done. You're fucking done!’ For his part, Voidberg's not so much running away from them as running around them, keeping his distance but trying to face them at the same time. His hands are still on his trench, when one of the cops trips and falls and Voidberg—whose back is to us—stops, pulls open his trench like it's a pair of wings and he's a bird about to take off, off a cliff or something, and the cop, who's on his knees, trying to get up, falls over on his side and curls up into the fetal positon. ‘What in God's name?’ says Gustaffson.

I don't have time to answer, even if I could, because while Voidberg's standing there with his trench open, a gunshot rips into his shoulder. He screams, grabbing the place he's been hit, which is bleeding, the blood soaking into his trench. Gustaffson takes off up the hil. One of the other three cops gets to the one who's curled up while the other two run at Voidberg to finish him off. Maybe they would have done it too, if not for Gustaffson yelling *at them* to lay down their weapons. That little hesitation's all it takes. Voidberg gets moving again, but because he wants to run away from the pair of cops, he runs toward Gustaffson, and Gustaffson's holding his gun, pointing it—not at Voidberg but at the cops behind him—but Voidberg doesn't know that, and before I can follow Gustaffson up the hill, Voidberg opens his trench—

“Oh shit,” said the rookie.

“‘Oh shit's’ right,” said one of the other cops.

Another looked at his watch. “Time to go, boys. Break time's over.”

“What—no! What happened next?” asked the rookie, and Moises Maloney drank the rest of his coffee. “I need to know. Seriously.”

“Don't we all,” said the cop, the Irish one who'd just said, “‘Oh shit's’ right.”

“You mean none of you know?” asked the rookie.

“That's right. Long story, short break. Good old Maloney's never gotten past this part.”

Moises Maloney got up from the table they'd been sitting at. He started getting money out of his wallet.

“Damn,” said the rookie, getting up too.

“That's it?”

“What?”

“You wanna hear the end of the story but you're just gonna give up on it, just like that?”

“I thought you said break's over.”

“You thought it or I said it?” said the cop. The other cops, including Moises Maloney, were trying their hardest not to crack up.

“You… said it.”

“Well, I sure as shit didn't mean it. We're cops, kid. Wanna know who tells us when our breaks are over? We do. Nobody fucking else.”

Moises Maloney sat back down smiling. A waitress refilled his cup with coffee.

The rookie sat down too.

“We're just busting your balls, kid. Don't let yourself get pushed around, all right?”

“Sure,” said the rookie.

“So what happened next?” he asked.

Moises said:

Voidberg opened his trench right at Gustaffson. They were maybe twenty feet from each other. I was still down the hill, but I could see them. This time Voidberg wasn't facing away from me. I was at an angle but looking right at him, gun in my hand, and—

“What did you see?”

“Nothing,” said Moises Maloney.

“What do you mean, ‘Nothing?’” said the rookie.

“I don't mean I didn't see anything. I mean I saw nothing: a literal nothing. There was this emptiness in Voidberg's body, from his chest down to his crotch, but it wasn't a hole, you couldn't see through it to the other side. No, it was this deep, dark vacuum, and not in the Hoover sense, but in the sense of nothingness.”

“Fuck,” said the rookie. “*Void*berg.”

“I only saw it for a second—from a distance, an awkward angle, before I looked away, but even that was enough to shake me. I'll never forget it. I hope I never, ever see anything like it again. It hurt, you know? It hurt me *existentially* to see that fucking void.”

There was silence.

“What happened to Gustaffson?” asked the rookie.

“He went down. He went down and he never got up again, not really. It didn't kill him. It didn't kill anyone directly, but nobody was the same after. After it was all over, we got Gustaffson to the hopsital and he was alive, there wasn't anything physically wrong with him, but he wasn't the same. Same dead eyes as that woman we saw. Same as anybody who got flashed by Voidberg.

“When he got out of the hospital, they put on him meds, then used the meds to explain why he was different. He never got back on active duty. His girlfriend left him. Like, Christ, they'd been together ten years and she couldn't be with him after that, said she couldn't stand it. I asked her once if it was anything he did, like putting hands on her, and she said no, that it wasn’t about what he did, just the way he was. Nine months later he was dead. Clean, prescription drug overdose. No note. When I saw his body all I could think was, Fuck, the man doesn't look any different than when he was alive.”

“Sorry,” said the rookie.

“Yeah, well, me too. But the risk comes with the job—or the other way around.”

“I'll say what I've always said,” said the Irish cop: “I'll take a bullet to the head any day over something like that. That kind of erosion.”

“What happened to Voidberg?” asked the rookie.

“The two cops shot him in the back while he was flashing Gustaffson.”

“Died on the hill?”

“I don't know,” said Moises Maloney.

“You mean they didn't do an autopsy—or was it, like, inconclusive, or maybe you just didn't want to know?” asked the rookie.

“I mean that he was sure as fuck dying after they'd got him in the back. Fell over, moaning like an animal. But he was moving, breathing: wheezing. The two cops didn't want to get too close, and they'd stopped shooting. And then he kind of curled up himself, and pulled his head and shoulders *into the void in his body*, and when the upper part of him had disappeared into himself, he pulled the rest of himself into himself too and—*poof*—he was gone,” said Moises Maloney, snapping his fingers.

The rookie was staring at the black coffee in the white porcelain cup in front of him. Someone opened the cafe doors, they slammed shut and the surface of the coffee rippled because of the kinetic energy.

The rookie said, “You're busting my balls, right?”

“Yeah, kid. I'm busting your balls,” said Moises Maloney without a touch of sincerity.

He didn't see the rookie much after that, but one thing he noticed when he did is that the rookie never drank his coffee black. He always put milk in it—way too much milk, until the coffee was almost white.",1,1763691305.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False

1p2mfx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1p2mfx9/voidberg/,Voidberg,"Moises Maloney sat mid-afternoon in a cafe with several other cops, one of whom was a rookie. They were eating donuts and drinking coffee. One of the other cops said to Moises, “Hey, Maloney, why don't you tell the kid about Voidberg,” then asked the rookie, “Kid, you heard about Voidberg?” The rookie said, “No, I never heard about Voidberg. What's Voidberg?” and he looked at Moises Maloney, who finished chewing a chunk of his Baston Cream donut and said:

Once upon a time when I was just a little past being a rookie myself, I got a call to go out to Central Dark to deal with a pervert, *a flasher,* you know, one of those weirdos who runs around in a trenchcoat with nothing underneath exposing himself to strangers. In this case it was multiple calls that had come in. The guy was apparently exposing himself to children, upset one of them, who ran to his parents, who put a call in to the cops.

“The flasher was Voidberg?”

“Yeah.”

“Why was he—”

“I'll get to that,” said Moises, taking a drink of coffee.

“Let him tell the story, kid,” said one of the other cops, a thick-necked red-headed Irishman, who was barely chewing his donuts before swallowing them.

Moises Maloney continued:

So we get these calls and it's pretty clear someone has to go down there, but nobody wants to do it, so we draw straws and I get the short straw, so me and my partner at the time, Gustaffson (“Man, Gustaffson… rest his soul.”) get in our car and drive down there, but it's in the Dark itself, and it's a flasher, not a shooter, so we don't drive into the Dark but park outside and walk in.

Both of us are expecting the flasher's going to be long gone by now, because usually they get their jollies off and beat it, before one or other of the unassuming strangers they've exposed themselves to decides fuck that and beats their face in, and in this case there's parents involved, so forget about it, right? Well, wrong. Because even before we get there—and we're not walking very fast, mind you—we hear these short, wailing screams, just awful sounds. We think, what the fuck is going on? And it's not the same person screaming, so we know it's not the flasher getting beat. One scream, one voice, the next scream, another voice. And they're all so unfinished, like someone's taking an axe to these screams, hacking them in half before they've been fully expressed, and the unfinished half is shoving itself back down the screamer's throat, shutting them up. Never heard anything like it before.

The first person we see is this woman walking in the opposite direction from us, with two crying kids following her. They keep saying mom, mom, mom, but she's not even reacting, just walking like a fucking zombie. When she passes us I see her eyes: they're just *dead.* I say something to her—don't remember what—but I already know she's not gonna respond. She walks by us, the kids walk by us, and I look over at Gustaffson, who shrugs, but we draw our weapons because we don't know what the hell is going on.

That's how we come to the hill.

Central Dark's a big place and we're in this part where people like to hang out on the grass. There's the hill, which is usually pretty busy, and on the other side's a small playground, which is where the calls reported the flasher being. Today, the hill is empty. And we don't have to walk across it to get to the flasher—who, remember, we think is long gone—because he's right fucking there: on the top of the hill.

All around the hill's a group of people looking up at him, and he's pacing and turning round and round, dressed in a grey trench, like your stereotypical pervert. Some of the crowd's turned away, so they have their backs to him. Others are covering their kids eyes. The kids are crying. There are maybe six or seven adults walking like zombies, like the woman who passed us. And every once in a while somebody runs up the hill to get to the flasher, and he flashes them and they just stop, drop and curl up. Fetal position, like whatever they've seen's pushed them back through time and they're as helpless as infants.

Gustaffson shouts, ‘Police!’

Most of the people surrounding the hill look over at us, and we're not sure what to do. The flasher doesn't acknowledge us, but he's not armed, so I don't want to run up the hill pointing my gun at him, because that's gonna be a world of paperwork, so I say, ‘Hey, buddy—you up on the hill there. My name's Moises Maloney and me and my partner here are with the NZPD. You wanna come down off that hill and talk to us?’ He doesn't answer but starts laughing, and not in a happy way but like he's being forced to laugh, you know? Like he's a hyena and it's his nature to make a sound that sounds like laughter but really isn't laughter. If anything, he looks and sounds lost, confused, cornered He's not attacking anyone or even aggressively flashing them or anything. It's more defensive. Somebody runs up the hill, he flashes them to keep them away. Keep in mind he's surrounded too. He can't get off the hill. Anyway, I'm thinking he's a mental case, which jibes with him flashing random strangers in the Dark.

‘We're not here to hurt you,’ Gustaffson yells to him, and he means it. Gustaffson was a stand-up guy. For a second it seems the flasher's thinking of coming down to us. The crowd's gone silent. He's at least stopped spinning round, so now he's just standing there with his hands on his trench, making sure it stays closed.

Then we hear a gunshot—and all hell breaks loose—people start screaming, scattering, no idea whee the shot came from, until four cops come running in from the other side of the Dark. Gustaffson looks at me. I look at the cops. NZPD unfiorms, but I’ve never seen any of them before. We try to get their attention, but they don't care about anything except the flasher, who's gone bug-eyed and is spinning again on the top of the hill, and I think, well, fuck, there goes our chance of talking him down. Not that I think it for long, because these other cops, they run through the crowd and start firing at the flasher. No warning, no hesitation, just ***bang bang bang.***

That puts the flasher into a real frenzy, and rightly so because he's getting fucking shot at.

Gustaffson strats yelling, ‘He's unarmed! He's unarmed!’ as I get over to the closest of the four cops, who tells me, ‘He doesn't have a gun but he's dangerous!’ and ‘Come on, help us nail this freak!’

But I'm not about to shoot an unarmed mental case, and I'm already imagining what I'll say in my defense, but also, as far as I know, these other cops don't have any authority over us, and Gustaffson's not shooting.

The cop who was talking to me shakes his head and runs after the other three cops, who are now chasing the flasher, taking shots, missing. It's a goddamn farce. It looks ridiculous, except they have real guns and they're trying to kill somebody. That's when one of them says it: ‘It's over, Voidberg. You're done. You're fucking done!’ For his part, Voidberg's not so much running away from them as running around them, keeping his distance but trying to face them at the same time. His hands are still on his trench, when one of the cops trips and falls and Voidberg—whose back is to us—stops, pulls open his trench like it's a pair of wings and he's a bird about to take off, off a cliff or something, and the cop, who's on his knees, trying to get up, falls over on his side and curls up into the fetal positon. ‘What in God's name?’ says Gustaffson.

I don't have time to answer, even if I could, because while Voidberg's standing there with his trench open, a gunshot rips into his shoulder. He screams, grabbing the place he's been hit, which is bleeding, the blood soaking into his trench. Gustaffson takes off up the hil. One of the other three cops gets to the one who's curled up while the other two run at Voidberg to finish him off. Maybe they would have done it too, if not for Gustaffson yelling *at them* to lay down their weapons. That little hesitation's all it takes. Voidberg gets moving again, but because he wants to run away from the pair of cops, he runs toward Gustaffson, and Gustaffson's holding his gun, pointing it—not at Voidberg but at the cops behind him—but Voidberg doesn't know that, and before I can follow Gustaffson up the hill, Voidberg opens his trench—

“Oh shit,” said the rookie.

“‘Oh shit's’ right,” said one of the other cops.

Another looked at his watch. “Time to go, boys. Break time's over.”

“What—no! What happened next?” asked the rookie, and Moises Maloney drank the rest of his coffee. “I need to know. Seriously.”

“Don't we all,” said the cop, the Irish one who'd just said, “‘Oh shit's’ right.”

“You mean none of you know?” asked the rookie.

“That's right. Long story, short break. Good old Maloney's never gotten past this part.”

Moises Maloney got up from the table they'd been sitting at. He started getting money out of his wallet.

“Damn,” said the rookie, getting up too.

“That's it?”

“What?”

“You wanna hear the end of the story but you're just gonna give up on it, just like that?”

“I thought you said break's over.”

“You thought it or I said it?” said the cop. The other cops, including Moises Maloney, were trying their hardest not to crack up.

“You… said it.”

“Well, I sure as shit didn't mean it. We're cops, kid. Wanna know who tells us when our breaks are over? We do. Nobody fucking else.”

Moises Maloney sat back down smiling. A waitress refilled his cup with coffee.

The rookie sat down too.

“We're just busting your balls, kid. Don't let yourself get pushed around, all right?”

“Sure,” said the rookie.

“So what happened next?” he asked.

Moises said:

Voidberg opened his trench right at Gustaffson. They were maybe twenty feet from each other. I was still down the hill, but I could see them. This time Voidberg wasn't facing away from me. I was at an angle but looking right at him, gun in my hand, and—

“What did you see?”

“Nothing,” said Moises Maloney.

“What do you mean, ‘Nothing?’” said the rookie.

“I don't mean I didn't see anything. I mean I saw nothing: a literal nothing. There was this emptiness in Voidberg's body, from his chest down to his crotch, but it wasn't a hole, you couldn't see through it to the other side. No, it was this deep, dark vacuum, and not in the Hoover sense, but in the sense of nothingness.”

“Fuck,” said the rookie. “*Void*berg.”

“I only saw it for a second—from a distance, an awkward angle, before I looked away, but even that was enough to shake me. I'll never forget it. I hope I never, ever see anything like it again. It hurt, you know? It hurt me *existentially* to see that fucking void.”

There was silence.

“What happened to Gustaffson?” asked the rookie.

“He went down. He went down and he never got up again, not really. It didn't kill him. It didn't kill anyone directly, but nobody was the same after. After it was all over, we got Gustaffson to the hopsital and he was alive, there wasn't anything physically wrong with him, but he wasn't the same. Same dead eyes as that woman we saw. Same as anybody who got flashed by Voidberg.

“When he got out of the hospital, they put on him meds, then used the meds to explain why he was different. He never got back on active duty. His girlfriend left him. Like, Christ, they'd been together ten years and she couldn't be with him after that, said she couldn't stand it. I asked her once if it was anything he did, like putting hands on her, and she said no, that it wasn’t about what he did, just the way he was. Nine months later he was dead. Clean, prescription drug overdose. No note. When I saw his body all I could think was, Fuck, the man doesn't look any different than when he was alive.”

“Sorry,” said the rookie.

“Yeah, well, me too. But the risk comes with the job—or the other way around.”

“I'll say what I've always said,” said the Irish cop: “I'll take a bullet to the head any day over something like that. That kind of erosion.”

“What happened to Voidberg?” asked the rookie.

“The two cops shot him in the back while he was flashing Gustaffson.”

“Died on the hill?”

“I don't know,” said Moises Maloney.

“You mean they didn't do an autopsy—or was it, like, inconclusive, or maybe you just didn't want to know?” asked the rookie.

“I mean that he was sure as fuck dying after they'd got him in the back. Fell over, moaning like an animal. But he was moving, breathing: wheezing. The two cops didn't want to get too close, and they'd stopped shooting. And then he kind of curled up himself, and pulled his head and shoulders *into the void in his body*, and when the upper part of him had disappeared into himself, he pulled the rest of himself into himself too and—*poof*—he was gone,” said Moises Maloney, snapping his fingers.

The rookie was staring at the black coffee in the white porcelain cup in front of him. Someone opened the cafe doors, they slammed shut and the surface of the coffee rippled because of the kinetic energy.

The rookie said, “You're busting my balls, right?”

“Yeah, kid. I'm busting your balls,” said Moises Maloney without a touch of sincerity.

He didn't see the rookie much after that, but one thing he noticed when he did is that the rookie never drank his coffee black. He always put milk in it—way too much milk, until the coffee was almost white.",1,1763691279.0,Odd_directions,2,1.0,False
1p2mfwq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p2mfwq,Thoughts on recent upgrades + some coffee set up brag,"Upgraded machine + grinder since last post. 

Machine upgrade: 
Mechanika Max to Syncronika 

Thoughts on this: negligible difference in overall performance - the Sync does look way better on the benchtop. If you’re considering a similar upgrade hoping for day and night changes, then save your money. This surprised me a little tbh.. 

I was lucky here, my very generous sister wanted more countertop space and suggested a swap for my Mechanika Max - of course I was never saying no to this offer 😅

Grinder upgrade: 
ECM Auto 64 + 1zpresso to Lagom P64 

Thoughts on this: significant difference and highly recommend this upgrade if you’re considering. The consistency factor is second to none, super easy to use, well built and whisper quiet. In my view, a beautiful machine too! 

Here some updated brag shots of the set up  + latte art progress (these are my best/flukes and there is absolutely no consistency on this front) 

TLDR 
update grinder, yes 
update machine, no",15,1763691278.0,espresso,2,1.0,False
1p2mfl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1p2mfl9/33f_35m_affair_partner_44f_cheated_on_for_3/,"33F 35M affair partner 44F Cheated on for 3 months straight, 2 yrs together, Horrible treatment towards me. Need advice, plz read?","been with my fiance for 2 years. I found out in August this year that he had been cheating on me since June. I didnt know the extent of it until September. He found her on a dating app, shes 44 years old, hes 35 and I’m 33. They had been talking every single day since June and started seeing each other consistently in July. I even found out that the new paintball team member he was playing with every weekend who was 17 years old, whom he would send me pictures of them together all the time, was actually her son. 

In August we got into a huge argument because I found a box of condoms in his truck, we didnt use condoms. He lied saying they were for us because he wanted to practice safer sex. I immediately knew he was lying. He got physical with me that night, I rushed towards him because I was so upset yelling at him, and he shoved me so hard 3 separate times that I went flying across his apartment and smacked my entire body on his hardwood floor face down, he shoved me again and I flew over his couch I literally saw stars. Then we got into a pushing match and he held me in a choke hold on the floor, laying on his back and I was on my back on top of him.

He said I couldnt come to his apartment anymore because the neighbors complained about the loud yelling. About a week later, I came over to talk about things and he was getting ready to go on a date. He told me he was about to go to the laundry mat and that the laundry mat was “super busy” at like 6 pm, something in my gut told me he was lying so I showed up unnanounced. He freaked out and said he was going out with the boys to the bar. I said no you’re not. He said fine, I’m going on a date. I begged him not to go, he walked out to his car and I got into his passenger seat. He came around and scooped me out of the car and we both fell onto the pavement. I walked back to my car crying and he came to my window and said “If you’re still here when I get back I’ll call the cops. If we’re meant to be together then we will be.” 

He said he only saw her once after that night, but turns out she said that was like their 20th date. He told me he left her in the movie theater that night because he felt so guilty and immediately tried to call me. That was also a lie, because she said she went home with him that night, they slept together and stayed in bed drinking coffee all morning (found this out days later). 

I woke up to an email from him the next day saying he was so sorry, that he needs me, loves me and made a huge mistake. I took him back. He told me the name of the woman he was seeing and I found her social media. I asked her how long he’d been sleeping with her and she told me “multiple times a week since July” she didnt know about me, he told her I was a crazy ex and that we broke up a year ago. Not true. The entire month of September she said he told her they were exclusive but that was a lie because we were obviously still seeing each other too, although he said he was “busy” more and barely put any effort into our relationship, it became more just about sex for him and no emotion. After he found out me and her had been talking, he “chose” me and said he’d stop talking to her. This was in October. That weekend I went over to his place for a few days and he made comments like “Dont start arguing with me, dont make me regret my decision.” I was so mad. 

He made so many backhanded comments blaming me for his cheating, saying he was unhappy and thats why he cheated, telling me details about their sex life - how she gave him better sex, how she felt better and tasted better, how she gave him massages, was more sensual, and how she touched him lovingly and tenderly unlike me. We got into 3 arguments about the affair that weekend, he would flip from crying in my lap saying how sorry he was, how it should have never happened, to being angry that I kept bringing it up. At 2 am when he was sleeping right next to me, he texted her saying “we got into a fight again, I think I made the wrong choice. can I see you again?” She said she’d tell me he said that, so when I woke up he confessed to sending her that text. I called her on his phone and begged her to block him and she refused saying she feels like he has more to say to her and that she feels like the victim in all of this. 

He promised me he wouldnt talk to her anymore, I told him if he does we’re over. A couple days later, I asked her if he was still talking to her, she said yes. He denied it. When I confronted him that she said they were, he says “I asked her to meet up with me tomorrow, I need to know if I’m making the right choice. I dont want to regret this for years. I’m sorry it sucks but its true.” I told him we’re over and he said “Ok I wish you the best.” A week later, he sends me 24 text messages proclaiming his love for me, that he “made a mistake and that we’re soulmates, saying she isnt my person, you are a part of my soul. I’m coming over right now to pick you up (at 6 am) to get my heart and soul. I love you too much to keep effing this up.”

I got into his car and he was super sexual with me immediately. Making out with me, etc. I was like what is going on? He told me she was just using him, seeing other guys and just wanted to “win”. She called him while we were in the car talking about this. I knew something wasnt right. We got to his place and he started acting really shady, pacing around and acting agitated. He told me he needed to take the call, he goes outside in the hallway, I open the door and see him texting her. He comes back inside and says “This was a mistake. We need to go now. It was a misunderstanding, she says she wants me and only me.” I said what is a misunderstanding?? He said “she saw me on bumble the other day but his profile was on snooze.” Bull. I know he was on the dating apps still cuz he said he saw me on there too while we were talking in the car.

He said “Get your stuff now. I need to take you back home.” I asked him if she was telling him to do that and he said yes. Unbeknownst to me, he started recording our conversation for her on his phone. We get into his truck and he said (while recording for her) “I want to be with you but I want to be with her more.” I said “Are you so smitten by her that you’re willing to throw away our love after 2 years?” he said “Yes.” I said “You dont have a future with her. She already has 3 grown kids. What are you gonna do? Have a baby with her and when the kid is 5 she’ll be 50?” he said “Maybe!” I was crying and heartbroken. He was furiously texting her the entire time, and took a picture of the freeway for her to prove he was driving me home. I said “can you please stop texting her the entire drive home out of respect for me?” He said “Yeah one sec.” and continued to do it the entire 40 min drive.

I said “What about the 24 text messages saying we were soulmates and that she wasnt your person??” He said “I thought I meant it but I dont know now.” I said “I loved you with my entire soul. I cant believe you’re doing this to me.” He said “Do you really mean that?” I said “Yes!” I got out of his car, he grabbed his gnomes that he kept in my front yard and left. I didnt hear from him for a week again, I contacted him to come get his stuff he left in my garage. He said he thinks about me every night, that he’s still in love with me. I asked him if he’s really happier with her and he said hes not happy. I told her all of this and she didnt believe me, she said next time record the call or I wont consider it. She started getting really rude with me so I just said whatever, you can have him, hes a habitual liar. 

He even lied to her in a group chat between the 3 of us saying he never kissed me or did anything sexual with me in the truck that day he picked me up. Literally lied to my face for her when he knew what really happened (more than kissing). Then, he told me he got a new promotion at work and is making a lot more money now and she was going to take him out this past monday to celebrate. Well, that was a lie too because she told me no, monday was her birthday and he was taking her out. She said they’re going to see each other every thursday and friday for the forseeable future. He said in the group chat, “I’m sorry I hurt you, I feel guilty, I do care about you but I care about her too and need to see if its real. I’ll let you know one way or another.”

I saw so many pictures, naked pics of her etc on his secret phone that I didnt even know he had. He would send me the same naked pictures of himself to both of us. I saw the loving texts her sent her saying he wanted to be in bed with her rubbing her back again, how amazing and perfect she is, etc. He told me he “loves us both and wants to be with both of us.” He would have sex with both of us on the same day sometimes. For months he would see her on saturday and me on sunday. I am disgusted.

He didnt do anything for our 2 year anniversary in August. I asked him if he got me flowers, he laughed and said yeah they’re at the store. Yet when she left him for a few days after finding out about me, he sent her a huge bouqet of flowers to her door.

A couple months ago he lied and told me he went to the mountains with his guy friend, said there wouldnt be service there so he couldnt use his phone. Called me that morning and said his guy friend was about to be there and that he loved me. Turns out he actually took her to the mountains that entire weekend. I have blocked both of them. It seems like he just assumed I would always be there waiting for him whenever he gets done with her. The way he treated me was so horrible and heartbreaking. I dont understand it. He went from someone that loved me to such a cruel person. I need some advice please?

TLDR; Cheated on for 3 months straight after 2 years together. He fell in love with both of us. So many lies. He was extremely cruel to me and still kept saying he was in love with me. She is 44, he is 35. I am 33.",1,1763691256.0,relationship_advice,14,0.57,False

Less need for puck prep, faster and more consistent grinds led to more consistent shots. We spend more time drinking and talking rather than me weighing out doses, slow feeding and puck prepping. It’s led to more bonding time and more coffee. It’s funny to think of how much difference an upgrade in grinder can make.

I’m 31M, she’s 26F. We were dating for 9 months. She’s from Turkey, we’re in the U.S.

From the start, we were supposedly serious. She said she wanted to wait until marriage for sex. We messed around (hand stuff, dry humping, etc.) but no actual sex, no seeing her fully naked. That’s not how I normally date, but I was like, “Okay, I’m going to take this seriously, date for marriage.” In my head I was trying to build something long-term, not just hookup.

She also has a very hard work schedule, so we didn’t see each other as much as she wanted. I tried to give attention, but it was hard – often she was working when I was free, and I was working when she was free. Not an ideal schedule, but I was trying.

Around like 7 months in, she starts pressuring me to get married, very clearly tied to her visa situation. I’d like to get married eventually, but 7 months and “we need to do it for the visa” is just too much for me. I tell her I’m not comfortable getting married for visa reasons that fast.

Fast forward to about 9 months in: I go on a trip to Mexico to see a friend and go to a salsa festival. Salsa dancing is one of my hobbies. She already showed some jealousy about it, but this time it’s worse. Before I go, she says, “I don’t want you to go,” even though I’ve had this planned for weeks. When I get there, she’s basically checking up on me, calling a lot. Sometimes my phone is on airplane mode to save battery. She sees IG stories of me dancing (which is literally what I went there to do) and freaks out.

Breakup #1:
While I’m in Mexico, she tries to break up with me. I spend like an hour on the phone trying to talk her out of it. I come back to the U.S. thinking maybe we can fix it, but she still wants to break up. I offer therapy, I offer compromises. She doesn’t really take any of that. Eventually I’m like, “Okay, if that’s what you want, I accept it.”

The very next day I see she’s using Instagram “Close Friends” stories for the first time ever. I don’t even look at what it is. I just see the green ring, know she’s never used that before, and I block her because it feels like she’s trying to play games with me / post subtweets basically.

Then the next week she calls me as if nothing has happened: “Hey, how was your day?” I’m polite but confused. It’s like a 3-minute call. I’m not going to pretend I’m her boyfriend when she just dumped me. She texts “I miss you.” I ignore it.

Then she calls again and says she wants to talk about “us.” So I take the call. I kind of expect an apology. Instead, it’s more like:

“I just can’t deal with you dancing. If we get back together, we have to do X, Y, Z.”

So it’s more like demands: “we can get back together IF you change this and that.” I tell her: breaking up is a serious thing to me. If we’re going to set new boundaries, it needs to be done thoughtfully. I say I don’t want a relationship where you just break up and reconcile over and over again like it’s nothing.

Honestly, I didn’t feel great after that call. I thought that if she reached out, I’d be super ready to jump back in. Instead I felt very on the fence.

She says something like, “You can take a week to decide and call me.”

The next day, I call her and say: “Hey, I already have a trip planned to another city to look at apartments and see a friend. I planned this before all this. It doesn’t mean I’m out, I just want you to know I’ll be kind of out of pocket so you don’t freak out.” She seems fine with it. This is important: she knew I was traveling and she herself suggested I take a week.

On this trip I realize that moving away would basically mean moving away from her. Some of my anger from the breakup fades. I start thinking, “Actually, I do want to try again.” In my head, I’m kind of leaning toward, “Yeah, I’d like us to get back together,” and I’m even thinking about us living together.

About 9 days after that original call (so yeah, a little more than the week she mentioned), I call her. I hadn’t seen her in almost a month in person at this point. I ask if she wants to grab coffee and talk about us.

Her response is basically:

“No, I don’t think so. You took a week, so I’m going to look elsewhere now.”

Cold. Flat. No empathy. No acknowledgment that:

	•	she was the one who broke up with me first,
	•	she was the one who said “take a week,”
	•	she knew I was traveling,
	•	I was trying not to make a huge decision while still angry.

Now I’m stuck in my head wondering:

	•	Did she just find another guy in that time?
	•	Did I really do something terrible by taking that week(ish) to decide?
	•	Was she ever actually serious about getting back together, or was she just messing with my head?
	•	Was the marriage talk really about love, or mostly about her visa?

The first breakup, weirdly, I was starting to get over. But this second one – the way she flipped from “I want us back” to “you waited so I’m looking elsewhere” – has just messed me up. It feels so cold and transactional.

I’m 31. The idea of going back to dating apps, hookups, all that, feels exhausting and depressing. With her, I was trying to go all in: no games, no casual stuff, actually build a life. Now I feel like I got punished for not immediately begging hard enough, and I can’t stop replaying everything.

I don’t really have a point beyond venting. I guess I just don’t understand how someone can:

	•	talk marriage and kids,
	•	know I’m taking the relationship seriously,
	•	be the one to break up with me,
	•	tell me to “take a week,”
	•	and then act like I’m the bad guy for actually taking that time and not groveling instantly.

If anyone’s been through something like this – where someone weaponizes breakups and timelines, then blames you for not dancing fast enough to their tune – how did you stop feeling like it was all your fault? Right now I just feel blindsided and discarded.",1,1763690655.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Every. Single. One.

Apparently when you buy something with a crypto debit card, it converts your crypto to fiat at the point of sale. That conversion counts as disposing of your crypto, which means capital gains tax. So if you bought ETH at $2k and it's worth $3k when you spend it on groceries, you owe taxes on those profits. 

So technically I owe tax every time I use the card. Which seems fucking absurd but whatever, that's how the IRS sees it.

What really pisses me off is I made probably 50+ small purchases this year and now I need to calculate the gain/loss on each one. My cost basis was all over the place depending on when I bought.

Luckily, reporting taxes isn’t too hard. You can pull it from Coinbase (or use CoinLedger/another tax software if you ever transferred your crypto from another wallet/exchange). 

I'm probably being paranoid and I doubt the IRS would even care about minimal gains, but doesn't seem worth it to take the risk. Not trying to go through that headache just cuz I used my Coinbase Card for coffee. 

I've seen that Congress has discussed eliminated taxes on crypto transactions under $300 (which would be awesome, really hope this gets signed into law sometime soon). 

Anyway, just a heads up if you've been swiping your crypto card without thinking about it. Each transaction needs to be reported. It's annoying as hell.

- Meds: oral contraceptive, thyroid meds, anti-depressant 
- Hashimoto’s, psoriasis

6 months ago I started having trouble holding things like the steering wheel and a cup of coffee because both of my hands would feel like they were asleep. In late August, I had a week where I felt like my body was turning on itself - sick to my stomach, headache, muscle weakness. I was in the hospital for a few days, and they ruled out a stroke and did a bunch of MRIs and CT scans to also rule out MS. The neurologist believes there is arthritis on my cervical spine.

While the rheumatologist says that a hand x-ray showed no current signs of rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis, and I can’t get in for a nerve test until end of January, my symptoms persist. Sometimes it feels like the skin on my hands and feet is on fire, my thigh and arm muscles feel weak much of the time, and I have numbness/tingling on my back/right side and into my neck. I have intermittent joint pain on my hands and sometimes my fingers swell, but not too badly.

This has impacted my daily life and caused me to be fatigued in ways that I could not imagine. I’ve never even gotten headaches or heartburn let alone something this life-changing. I don’t want to just put a Band-Aid on this with medication and I am intrigued as to how arthritis can just suddenly develop in someone who is relatively healthy and has never had a car accident, major surgeries, etc. Maybe it’s something else, possible autoimmune?

I did take an injectable biologic about 15 years ago for a short time and had to stop because my feet felt like I was dragging bricks around, I couldn’t hold my head up, and couldn’t hold a pencil. I don’t know if that medication maybe caused what I’m dealing with now or maybe triggered what was already lying underneath. I do have a family history of autoimmune issues.

For context, my eczema started on my elbows and back of knees when I was a child. Then around 13 years old, it settled onto my hands as what I now assume to be dyshidrotic eczema, based on the pus-filled blisters popping up in clumps around my fingers. What I found to be the trigger was primarily processed sugars. Natural sugars, dairy, and some seafood did elicit reactions but nothing like with processed sugars. 

  
Fast forward to this year (I'm 21), my eczema cleared up and came back again after increasing my sugar intake. Four days ago an outbreak left my arms with sensitive, tiny little bumps that tore open with light scratching. Since then, I've been applying Dermasone 0.05% on the bumps and cut out coffee and tea, deep fried foods, spicy foods, and sugars. However, the ecezma on my hand has only been getting worse. The skin on my fingers is bumpy and pus-filled, similar to when I was still sugar regularly, except I haven't. I'm extremely frustrated as I've tried everything - switching back to my old toner and moisturiser after using a new one before the outbreak, sleeping early, drinking loads of water etc. I'm certain my hand eczema is supposed to go down if I follow these steps. 

  
Please, I'd love to hear if anyone has any advice on what I should or can do. It might help that I was recently on magnesium glycinate pills to help me sleep better, but I stopped them around 3 to 5 days before the outbreak happened. ",1,1763689799.0,eczema,0,1.0,False

I (26F) started to have feelings for my guy friend (21M)  who I serve with at my church. We’ll call him Johnny. I was originally waiting for my feelings to die out and chalked it up to just a crush.

However, Johnny and I hung out with a bunch of church friends and I felt like he was flirting with me. Johnny would always look at me when the whole group would erupt in laughter. I would catch him staring at me and he'd quickly look away. When Johnny shared stories in the group, he looked at me only, almost as if he was talking only to me. Even if I looked away when I looked back, Johnny was staring at me.

Johnny would also look at me and smile whenever romantic songs came on while everyone was doing their own thing. I, again, felt like oh maybe this is just in my head.

But at a different time, I was giving my feelings to the Lord and surrendering it to Him. I was praying and said ""God, if Johnny’s a distraction take him away, but if he's not..."" and I opened my eyes and 100 feet away, Johnny was walking right towards me but he was staring at the ground.

I (maybe prematurely) took this as a sign. The whole situation got me back into the word because I didn't want to make an idol out of my friend.

I told several friends about my experience and they also thought it was confirmation or at the very least really crazy.

I, of course, started over analyzing our interactions and I hated it. I was being weird towards Johnny because I was nervous but he was also being weird. We went on a church trip and I felt like he was ignoring me. At times though, he would walk over and stand right next to me and not say anything.

When we came back from the trip, Johnny was still ignoring me and every time he saw me, he looked like a deer in the headlights. I was so sick of thinking about him all the time (again not wanting to make him an idol) and things being weird between us because he IS my friend and I've always loved and cared for him in a platonic way.I told God if Johnny was going to keep me from Him, I didn’t want anything with him.

I decided to text him (we don't do that lol) and said I was sorry I was being weird lately and asked if he wanted to get coffee and just talk. He said yes.

I was planning on just telling Johnny how I felt in order to be transparent with him and wanting to end the weirdness I was feeling. I wanted our dynamic to go back to normal. I wanted my friend back. Day of, it felt very date–like, but I knew it could all be in my head. Johnny bought me coffee and we talked forever about the church trip, our testimonies, how we got to this point in our lives, our childhoods, our hopes and dreams etc. etc.

About 45 minutes in, Johnny asked me why I asked him to talk. He gave me this smirk when he asked me and I immediately panicked. The whole point of meeting up with him was to tell him how I felt and control how I said it (to make me more comfortable), but his question caught me off guard and I stumbled on my words and said “I don’t know” He said “okay” and we said it back to each other both times. 

The awkwardness pissed me off and he finally said “well in your text you said you were feeling weird” and I ended up telling how I was being weird and he was being weird. He said “ I was benign weird!?” and I said yeah I felt like he wouldn’t talk to me or was ignoring me. He said he wasn’t trying to and everytime he saw me I was hanging out with girls so he just didn’t come up to me. He said he was sorry and originally thought I asked to talk to him because he thought he had offended me. 

I told him we were cool and we ended on a good note. We had a church event later and I reminded him he was serving that evening and he should probably leave now to be there early (he’s required to be early). He looked at his watch and said he had five minutes. He looked at me as if he wanted to keep talking. I told him he should get going and I got up to leave. He asked me what I was doing before the event started and I said I would hang around the church until it started. 

I left in a rush, pissed off that I didn’t get my task done. The secret of my crush was eating me alive and I knew I wouldn’t get over it until I got it out in the open. 

At the event, I later felt like the Lord was telling me to tell Johnny how I felt. I know you are not supposed to test God and I had a problem with it a year ago. However, I was still going back and forth. Johnny would smile at me from across the room and I finally asked God for multiple blatant confirmations (7). 

I finally decided to write him a note and give it to him at the end of the night since I couldn’t say it. I put the note in my bible and immediately felt like the Lord was telling me to put it in my pocket so I was more likely to give it to him. By the end of the night, I couldn’t find him and I told God, “I’m not about to chase down this boy. If I don’t see him before I go, I’m not giving it to him” I walked toward the parking lot and I saw him. He asked me if I was leaving and he went to give me a big bear hug (we’ve never done that) and of course I panicked because I was planning on dabbing him up and leaving the note in his hand. I finally put the note in his hand. He asked what it was and I told him to read it later and I ran away.

I drove home with my heart in my stomach, pissed off that I was so vulnerable. However, I felt a supernatural level of peace. I had never felt so content and I knew it was from God. However, I did feel a bit confused about the outcome of what this was all for. I told God if I walk through this store and see merchandise for a movie me and Johnny watched together then these feelings I had for Johnny were leading to a relationship. (the movie was really old, I wasn’t asking for something like Wicked while there’s all this promo lol). I walked around the store looking for the crafts I intended on buying. I saw a random merch item from the movie. I brushed it off as a coincidence though.

I was about to leave the store and I saw another type of movie merch but it was a picnic blanket this time. I had written a poem about me and Johnny on a picnic blanket as soon as I had feelings for him, so naturally I took this as confirmation. I felt like it was too spot on to be nothing. 

I later had dinner with a friend of mine and I told her about what I was experiencing. She said it was crazy and asked for the first confirmation I ever asked for about Johnny.

I had to think about it and I remember MONTHS ago before I ever had feelings for Johnny. I had asked for confirmation. 

It was one of the first times I had ever hung out with this guy, before we were even friends. We had this weirdly romantic moment while serving and we gave each other this weird, loving smile of contentment. I remember praying “God, if this is supposed to be my husband, let me have feelings for him” I had asked God this because it felt like a romantic moment but at the time I wasn’t attracted to this guy AT ALL. (he’s the exact opposite of my type lol) 

Now, having dinner with my friend, I remembered this and told her. She was shocked and we didn’t know what to say of any of it. We just both decided it was all crazy. Later that night, I asked the Lord why Johnny hadn’t responded. Not out of desperation, just curiosity ( not like me at all lol), I felt like the Holy Spirit was telling me “you know he hates texting, and he’s afraid of his feelings.” I accepted this and went to bed. 

4 days after I had given Johnny the note, it was Sunday and he wasn’t at church, which was odd cause he serves in multiple ways on Sunday and is always doing something. I hung out for a couple services because I felt like the Lord was telling me to stay and serve for the children's ministry since we had new programming starting that week and the director needed help. 

I ended up seeing Johnny before I left and again he looked like a deer in the headlights. I realized “yeah, he definitely read my note” and I wasn’t ready to deal with any of it. He was in a group of friends so I just left and ended up getting lunch with some other church friends. We saw each other a couple times before I left and made awkward eye contact but we didn't say hi or anything. 

That night, we had another church event. I figured Johnny wasn’t serving since he was mostly absent at morning service. I was already on the calendar to serve and I saw him when I showed up. I was so annoyed and didn’t want to have any feelings for him anymore. I hated the whole situation. We spoke in groups but didn’t really talk one on one. 

At the end of the night, I was talking to a gal friend of mine. Johnny came over and asked to speak with me outside. I felt like throwing up. I was hopeful but also disappointed. I realized my own feelings about the situation were complicated. I wanted my feelings to be reciprocated and I also wanted him to turn me down. It was really odd. 

He ended up rejecting me and was really kind about it. He said the whole situation was new to him and he’s never had to do this before. Johnny said he wasn’t interested. I took this mostly well. I wasn’t completely upset (no one likes to get rejected tho lol) and I was mostly just confused. With God and Johnny. Also what was this all for?

I went home and told my besties and my mom. I realized that I was experiencing limerence and infatuation and wasn’t seeing Johnny completely how he was. I was over romanticizing him in my head. I was laughing at myself for ever having feelings for him. 

A few days later, I was hanging out with church friends and Johnny came last minute. When I saw him, I realized I still had a mini crush on him or maybe I was nervous because he thought I still had a crush on him. For once, I had no idea what I was feeling or what was happening to me internally. 

Things weren’t weird though. We had conversations amongst the whole group and privately. I also felt like Johnny was giving flirty vibes to a really close gal friend of mine (we’ll call her Sally) and the possibility of them becoming a relationship didn’t bother me. I considered myself over this whole thing.

I felt better and the next day I was fine and really started to see Johnny as my brother in christ again. All of his little quirks were still cute but in an admirable way, not romantic. The same way I find my gal friends cute with their little quirks. 

THEN, I saw Johnny a day later. I felt nervous and my heart played hopscotch in my chest. I panicked. WHAT THE HECK? I thought I was over this. He was being coy around me when I was talking to other people. When I was hanging out with guy friends, he would interrupt or try to talk to me. I was annoyed so I tried to ignore him. 

By the end of the night, I was secretly hoping he’d come around me and we could just talk and joke. I hated it and wanted to resent him, but I just couldn't. I still cared so much about him. I was talking with some gal friends and he came over and looked me dead in the eyes while someone was talking. I darted my eyes away and was annoyed by the attention. He started joking with one of my friends and we all started laughing. He kept looking at me and I’d catch him looking at me. I was so pissed. I felt so vulnerable and like he just enjoyed that I liked him as opposed to him liking me back. I felt vulnerable and still couldn’t hate him, which pissed me off even more. I wanted to hate him and see him as a jerk but I just couldn’t.

Johnny left the room and I prayed, “God, if this whole thing isn’t over. If there is something here and if the door isn’t closed, have him come back into the room” He did. I was confused again.

I told myself the author of confusion is the enemy, but it could also be my flawed flesh. I was annoyed again. A bunch of friends stayed longer to play basketball. Sally was going to play and I thought oh maybe he likes her. But Johnny said I should join. Mind you, I’m completely anti-sports and am painfully uncoordinated. I was gonna leave but I liked hanging out with my friends. I also felt like the Lord was telling me to stay as much as I like to run away from things like this. So I did. 

I hung out with another gal friend in the bleachers while everyone else played basketball. We had microphones and were reciting the score and giving a play by play, joking around. Johnny ended up calling a time out and looked at us to announce it. When he got my attention, he darted his eyes away immediately looking flustered. But I knew I could be overthinking it and trying to see what I wanted at that moment. The friend I was cheering with left and I decided to go to even though i wanted to hang out around Johnny. I knew this time, it was my own emotions and not the Lord. I left and prayed in the car home asking God to take away my emotions.

I woke up this morning and he still is taking over my mind. I’m so done and want to be done with it. Amongst all of this, I still love and care for Johnny and admire him deeply. It pisses me off. I’m past hate, I want to feel indifferent towards him but I can’t.

I’ve given up trying to predict the future and I want to be with someone who knows they want to be with me. BUT as I delusional for thinking Johnny liked me in the first place? I am usually able to read people and it really bothers me that I got this really wrong.

1p2lu4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1p2lu4c/how_going_back_to_christianity_has_made_me_loathe/,How going back to Christianity has made me loathe Mormon doctrine,"Recently, I've been going back to church, and back to Christianity. It started with an invitation to attend an Orthodox Divine Liturgy, and I've been delving deep into Christian Theology ever since, as well as Christian history. However, every time I've discovered more about Mormon history and doctrine, and how it conflicts with everything Christianity is supposed to represent, the more pissed I get. From the top: 

**The Book of Mormon: Inventing doctrine from thin air**

I have doubted all claims of the Bible being historically accurate, especially when it comes to the Old Testament. But as it turns out, it's Hebrew Scripture, the (mostly) same one used by most Jews. Which leaves the New Testament. And as I continued to do my research, the more I found evidence to support its accounts as accurate, especially with all the secular evidence to support it. The only book that is still debated by most Christians is the Book of Revelations. 

The Book of Mormon is NOT that book. The Book of Mormon, along with the Pearl of Great Price have been debunked by both secular AND Christian scholars. Not a shred of historical evidence exists to support it, and there's countless stories of its creation that directly discredit it. Even the church's own leadership back these stories up! Which then means that the Book of Mormon has just as much credibility as a politician's campaign promises, that is to say, none at all. It doesn't even have different writing styles in each book to indicate that different people wrote it. It's all written the same way. 

**Doctrine and Covenants: Declaring yourself God**

Doctrine and Covenants have been under fire recently specifically because of D&C 132. But the book as a whole is basically Joseph Smith writing church doctrine out of his ass. D&C 132 is obviously the most atrocious example of it, with Joseph Smith declaring himself infallible with the power to damn people as he pleases, and that is saved no matter what, and that he has absolute authority of the church. As an aspiring Orthodox, having a guy like the Pope being an absolute monarch already irks me. But Joseph Smith makes him look like a humble bishop in comparison! 

**Mormon Doctrine: Whatever the Prophet says**

Catholics may have shifted their doctrine many times, but whenever they DID shift it, it was through an Ecumenical Council, without hundreds if not thousands of bishops in attendance, and it usually took years to complete. The Orthodox for the most part try to keep the doctrines and traditions of the church as close to ancient practices as possible. They are VERY resistant to changing their doctrine. 

The Mormons are NOT one of those churches. Instead they shift doctrine on a whim depending entirely on who's in charge. President Nelson was announcing temples left and right, but the moment Oaks became the prophet, they switched gears before his body had even gone cold. Sodas aren't allowed because it's as unclean as coffee? Yeah, let's change that. 

Protestants have this problem too, and it's something that drives me nuts. Doctrine and Dogma shouldn't change on a whim. It needs to be consistent, and in line with the past. If religious dogma can be rewritten overnight, is it really a church of God, or a church of men? What's the point in being part of a church that scratches out their practices the moment they become popular to society at large? It reeks of a church that's trying to attract members, rather than adhere to Christian doctrine. 

**The Restoration Movement: Apostasy as an excuse to create a cult**

And what irritates me more than anything else, is that they spread the lie that other churches are invalid because the true church was lost when the apostles died. The argument immediately falls apart when you realize that the Apostles actually appointed people to replace them as church leaders. This is where the Orthodox AND Catholic churches get their legitimacy. The Restoration Movement, the same movement that spawned Jehovah's Witness and Seventh Day Adventists, also spawned the Mormon church, and it shows. The movement was an attempt by corrupt men to create cults under the guise of rebuilding Christianity from scratch. 

The apostasy myth is merely an excuse to completely disregard any other Christian church as illegitimate, as to prevent their members from critically engaging and critiquing Mormon teachings, for fear of their members realizing the lies that the church has spread.

We are a relatively small shop, I have 3 employees and a couple of part time ones, but in the end a lot of responsibility relies squarely on me (as the ED, I understand). I thought that I was prepared for this job, I have 20+ years of nonprofit management experience, have been on boards myself, and my background is really working in large nonprofits in national offices. 

Everyday I work this job, is a day I get closer to quitting. I have an overreaching (and highly critical) board with zero direction — I’ve asked to do strategic planning and it was met with a “no” or “we don’t have time for that.” So, I’m just going my own. We have increased our fundraising efforts by 4-5 times year-over-year, created new programming and events, and I’ve met with so so so many volunteers/donors. 

But today, I just about lost it. I met with a volunteer who trauma dumped on me at a 7am coffee meeting and it trainwrecked my day, I’ll be honest. I didn’t take it into the office (I’m very protective of the mental health of my staff). I’ve been dealing with a serious health issue for the last year, that I told the board about, and there has been zero understanding on their part (I know they don’t have to care, but goddamn). We have a huge event in the spring and my plan is to see them through it and leave. Am I out of my mind? I just am so stressed and dealing with a lot. I am at the point that I’m seeing a therapist twice a week (I used to go once a month) to deal with things. I spend most of my weekends avoiding people, but I’m also still pretty sick and need critical downtime to myself so I can make it through the next week.

CA, USA","Hello, looking for some advice on an issue with a security deposit and whether it is worth it to take it to small claims court or even if I'm the one that is in the wrong. 

Background: When we moved into this apartment there were a few things left over from the previous tenants. Notably, a large(ish) wooden coffee table/tv stand thing in the garage. The previous tenant had also mounted a TV in the living room (and left the mount in the wall). There was also some small bug sprays and a round-up can in one closet. All this was noted in the move in form. When we moved in we replaced the tv mount with one that would fit our TV and removed it when we left. The original mount of the previous tenant was left in the garage with the old furniture piece. 

Fast forward to me and my bf moving out: Walkthrough was done and our only ""damage"" was from paint chips coming off where we used some command hook adhesive on the same wall that had the TV mount on it. Above the paint chips there were two lines of nail holes from the tv mount. Landlord acknowledged that those were from previous tenant mounting the TV not our fault. We all agreed. 

In California the landlord has 21 days to return the security deposit with invoices and receipts showing what repairs were done. The landlord did not contact us at all for the 21 days, once it got to 30 days we made contact ourselves asking for the deposit back. He mailed us a check with $1,100 in deductions. No invoices just a handwritten piece of paper that said: 

Cleaning -$400

Paint/wall repairs -$600

Trash Removal -$100 

  
Cleaning we were okay with, but trash removal was a surprise because to our knowledge we removed everything. We asked for clarification and he listed an item in the garage and small items in the condo itself. We asked for pictures of the items removed to ensure that he wasn't thinking about the belongings from the previous tenant. He ignored us. Nothing was noted in the move out form either, as far as leftover belongings. For the paint/repairs he provided an invoice for $900 from his handyman that covered painting multiple areas and drywall repair. He decided himself to allocated $600 of that to us. We reminded him that in California paint has a useful life of 3 years (we rented for 3 years) and he should be responsible for repainting the entire apartment. We understand that if the paint chips required more than a simple paint job that would be our responsibility but we asked for clarification on how he came up with the amount of $600 out of the $900 and he also ignored us. It's been 30 days since we last asked for clarification of these deductions and no response. At this point I want to ask for the trash removal fee and the paint fee back (so $700), is it worth it to take to small claims or do the deductions seem reasonable??",1,1763689323.0,Tenant,2,1.0,False

I’ve become pretty set on doing 4 years active duty in the military for the experience, lessons, and college benefits, but I am not sure what branch to join. I want the USMC (or maybe army) type of military experience but I’m not sure if the lifestyles in those branches would be too much for me coming from such an easy life.

So, my three favorites in order are Marines, Army, and Air Force. Planning on only doing 4 years, I’m curious if it wouldn’t be so bad to tough it out in the corps.

I would appreciate any input y’all may have about my situation and decision",6,1763688931.0,Militaryfaq,1,1.0,False

So sorry for incorrect formatting or stuff. Just saw the title, i mean NOT\* appropriate to bring him to certain events sorry. 

I F(16) have an older sister F(26), she has a boyfriend M(33) and to put it short, he's a prick and a waste of time. He hangs off her physically (like literally always has a hand on her), makes her do everything for him like getting him dinner, making coffee, cleaning up when he spills, etc. He calls a minimum of 3 times a day and for the stupidest shit that could've easily been a text, like telling her he's getting off work now, or that he has (this) many trucks left to load, or that he's eating dinner now, etc. And he keeps on calling until she picks up. He also comes over every single weekend of everu week of every month, the weekend apparently being Thursday-Friday and it can't be changed no matter what and she has to sleep over on certain days and he has to sleep over here on certain days and blah blah blah. My sister's too much of a pussy to not answer, text him that she's busy or in public and can't call, he doesn't even listen when she tells him to stop anyway, and idk about the routine situation.

He's interrupted our lives too, as i have several activities and school stuff I need to attend throughout the week and with her being gone and my family working, i have to make dinner and it usually ends up being cold by the time they get home and I'm not there to eat with them anymore. My sister also doesn't want to cook dinner or do any of her chores when she's home anymore, but she jumps up when he bf asks her to do something and it's irritating. When the prick bf does anything but watch tv, he bbq's sometimes and it leads to us eating at 9 or 10 instead of 7pm like usual because it apparently takes 2 fucking hours to start a coal fire for a bbq, and then the food ends up burnt, over seasoned (there's literally a layer of random spices), chewy or absolutely blood still dripping meat pink or red type of raw. He's made my mother late for meetings due to taking the car without saying so, and gotten my eldest sister in trouble at work as she literally picks up his calls despite having to teach class. In recent he's also come to a family reunion and just sat in a corner not responding to anyone even when talked to( i had to sit in the trunk as there wasn't enough space in the car). My sister had to sit on his lap on the drive home because my mom took me and a friend to the mall, and they wanted a ride back home at the last second, whicb made my friend and me uncomfortable as he was literally squeezing her thigh and she was kinda grinding against him. There's other stuff but the post is getting long.

The incident that is caused me to make this post happend a few days ago, I was going with a friend to say goodbye to my her terminally ill grandmother that i've know since I was 6, she treated me like her own grandchild and asked for me to also be there, as she was expected to pass in 3 days max (by the time of writing this post, she's already passed btw) and my friend really needed me there. My friends grandmother wasn't acquainted with my other family members as my family are all adults with jobs and are too busy to usually do much outside of work but do make time for me luckily. Anyway day of, my sister starts dropping hints about coming with and I shut it down pretty quick, telling her that she has no relation to the woman and that she should be ashamed of herself for wanting to show up for no reason. Her justification was that she lady probably wanted to meet her and her boyfriend before she passed and when asked why she had no other answer. My mother scolded her too and I think might've kicked her out aswell since she hasn't come back from her bf's house in three days so now I feel kinda bad cause she can't support herself and my parents seem unbothered about it.

Sorry for it being long and stuff

TLDR: My eldest sister's boyfriend is a prick and keeps wanting to come to places he's not needed nor wanted and then doesn't do anything while there. She complains about it but doesn't do anything to change anything. Ended in her getting kicked out, AITA?",9,1763688788.0,AITAH,12,0.81,False

Artist, writer, cosplayer.  
Looking for the one who loves slow-burn stories.

I'm searching for a real relationship with a girl who loves nerdy things or would be interested in couples cosplay and is ready for something serious. We would start online and go from there. A partner who I can call a best friend.

Big Final Fantasy fan, so if you give off JRPG love interest energy, we'll definitely get along. I'm working on a Cloud cosplay myself!

I like to draw, cosplay, read, and write fantasy. In the next five years I plan to have a Creative Writing MFA and two published novels. With my partner we'd go on coffee shop or book store dates, or long video calls full of laughter and anime. Co-op gaming or just watching each other game always welcome.

As for me, I'm physically fit, ambitious, and creative. I don't choose easily, but when I do I'm all in. I'm pretty playful typically and high energy, but also steady when I need to be.

I’m most drawn to women with a cute face, feminine, slim or athletic, and takes care of her health. Someone kind with similar values and has something she is passionate about. I have a thing for natural beauty (especially face-wise), so my type goes from Yuna from FFX for a softer, kind look to Tifa from FF7 for the more refined and feminine.

My non-negotiables are loyalty and communication. Someone who stays when it gets hard.

1p2lh9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1p2lh9v/the_best_things_about_houston/,The Best Things About Houston,"Houston was the first city I moved to after finishing school and after leaving it for a few months after layoffs, I can say I've never been more homesick in my life. I had so much fun and enjoyed my life there and desperately hope I can move back someday.

So if you're new or planning to move to Houston, or maybe you're a native and have been there a while, I hope you enjoy my little list of favorites from the city!

**Attractions**

* **Natural History Museum:** stunning, so many unique exhibits. The lowest floor if I remember right is interactive and the upper floor is much calmer. I could get lost staring at the gem stones and dinosaur bones all day. Plus, the butterfly exhibit is amazing!
* **The Museum of Fine Arts:** serene and a great way to spend the day if you're into art. Loved visiting multiple times just to stroll the building and stare at things!
* **Hermann Park:** big open fields for lounging and picnics. The swan boats in the water are fun and the park is a lot bigger than you would expect. Great for getting steps in!
* **Levy Park:** a more petite park and very dog and child friendly. Beautifully landscaped with whole dedicated dog park for big and small dogs. They host markets sometimes!
* **POST Skylawn:** really beautiful during Christmas, great views of the Houston skies with plenty of photo opportunities. Plus, lots of markets and events hosted here.
* **Seismique:** really beautiful and interactive, was actually surprised I enjoyed it so much. Definitely worth a visit and very photo worthy!
* **Color Factory:** a lot more relaxed compared to Seismique but bright and colorful and fun. Makes for some of the best photos adn memories with friends, would recommend!

**Day to Day**

* **Central Market:** my beloved, I had it so good and I took it for granted. It's approaching Christmas season so please, if you're a matcha person, get the Grinch Matcha Latte (or in off-season, ask for cinnamon steamed with your matcha latte). Changed my life. Oh, also the pizza dough is THE BEST for home made pizza and the sandwiches are legendary. I'm gonna cry just thinking about it.
* **HEB:** the classic, the best. Miss the really fun ice cream flavors and the tortillas, it's always the tortillas. Also very bitter that they started releasing the craziest HEB branded merch after I moved out of Texas, very rude.
* **Bellaire / Asian District:** you've got essentially every Asian ingredient and restaurant at your fingertips. I terribly miss the variety and quality of all the foods here.
* **Rice Village:** really quaint and highly recommend visiting the farmers market whenever it pops up too. Lots of shops and while some restaurants are a bit high-end, there's a lot of approachable cafes and fast-casual options too. Great to stroll and shop!

**Restaurants + Cafes**

*I previously made a pretty* [exhaustive list of cafes](https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1k6gb51/25_year_houston_cafe_bakery_review/) *and plan on making a restaurant list soon (sorry for the delay). The food and variety in the city is just that good, amazing and unmatched. The ones here are just some of my favorites and highlights!*

* **Kata Robata:** favorite sushi spot. Pricey but absolutely worth it; chirashi box is the best deal (in my opinion) and good to split between two for a light bite or one for a very satisfying meal. The green tea souffle cake is amazing and so is the seasonal shaved ice!
* **Anonymous Cafe:** probably the place I frequented the most in the city. If you're a big fan of vanilla, get the ekmek (trust) and try any of their numerous pound cake flavors. They have savoury meals too and the barista has the best and cutest latte art!
* **La Calle:** something about the consomme just hits different. Love a set of street tacos, ridiculous amount or horchata and their amazing and spicy sauces. Pro tip: they're open really late, so go see a concert or show in downtown then visit here afterwards!
* **Sunday Press:** pleasantly surprised that this place served both looks AND quality foods and pastries. Originally came for the swirly croissants but stayed for the more filling foods. Best salad of my life here and comfortable place to get work done!
* **Zoa Moroccan Kitchen:** delicious and I think great value for money. I do the build your own bowl with lamb and all their sides are so good, never boring. Favorites include the tumeric cauliflower and the cinnamon carrots. Staff are are always lovely too!
* **Tiger Noodle House:** I dream about their noodle soups during the winter. Warming and delightfully peppery and savoury. The lamb is my preference and the fried sticky rice dish with the brown sugar syrup is a lot better than you would expect!
* **Day 6 Coffee:** amazing amazing amazing pastry case. I had a brisket kolache that was massive and so filling, numerous muffins and the legendary Texas latte. Plus, staff is kind and amazing, great place to work and bathroom provides femenine products.
* **Bubble Tea:** just an honorable mention that every single bubble tea brand or chain is dotted throughout the city and there's no shortage of options. Oh how I miss it.

**General**

* **People:** everyone was just so kind and really laid back. The city is so diverse that you get to meet all sorts of people in pretty much any spot, and it makes for great conversation or people watching if you're shy like me.
* **Highways:** I know people get scared of Texas highways (especially Houston), but honestly after your first traumatizing rush hour, it's really nice. Big open lanes and I enjoyed the fact everyone just knew that going fast was the proper speed limit. Just... avoid peak rush hour if you can, it's still a little stressful haha.
* **Pricing:** it's a big city and definitely you can feel that in some of the rent prices of apartments, but in general it was comfortable and affordable between groceries and regular bills. I really hope it stays that way.
* **Neighborhoods:** I'm not sure what to call this... neighborhoods? Districts? Think things like Rice Village / Montrose / Bellaire etc. There's so many areas ans sub-sections of Houston with their own distinct vibes, shops and people. If you ever get bored of one place, there's plenty of other places to explore!

Thanks for listening to my ramble! Hope that if you're exploring Houston or moving and living there that this helps some. Feel free to share any of your favorite things too; hopefully I can experience them if I move back someday!",68,1763688585.0,houston,5,0.92,False

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

Vignette Substitution anagram!?!!

Can you imagine my surprise listeners at home?  It was short lived.  It felt glorious and I had thought I had cracked K4's encoding mechanisms.

I was wrong because K4 is a dual autokey, but can act like Vigenère-style inserts when auto-keys align.  This is because it was built off of the same color clock substitution schedule, as you spin the dual auto key, you can break into the substitution anagram layer of the autokey with the right seed and substitutions.  It's also why K4 is so binary.  It wants the dual autokey lanes to align which temporarily collapses it to a stable offset.  HAHA I learned to call it that just the other day, how wonderful.

The seam is roughly between 36-45 (the seam and tail auto-keys) of K4.  I found it by considering it an overlap at first and K4 started ""talking"" with the words UNITEUS. By sliding the seam alignment you ""tune into these decoding windows - like  Radio.

To solve K4 you need to identify the stable seam, extract both lanes, tuning through offsets until the substitution schedule collapses into readable windows.

Other than that Kryptos Alphabet.

To start others on the path to cracking it.  The seam I started with is roughly between 36-45 (the seam and tail auto-keys) of K4.  I found it by considering it an overlap.  That made UNITEUS appear.  By sliding the seam alignment you ""tune into these decoding windows"" it's like  Radio.  It also says a lot more than 97 characters worth.  It is a framework of short of many short readable bursts!

How to solve k4 for those following at home?

Find a stable Seam.  Extract the two autokey lanes.  Slide the alignment through offsets.  Watch for the collapse of the substitution layer and read the Fragments that appear.

1p2le0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/1p2le0v/bachelor_party_recommendations/,Bachelor Party Recommendations,"TLDR: recommendations for a bachelor party this weekend with food, clubs, bars, strip clubs and other activities.

Hey! Our group of 6 guys (age range early 30s) is coming up to MTL this weekend for a bachelor party and we are super excited! Of course weather will dictate what we do, and with the cold we’ll probably be aiming for indoor activities. We do like to party and have fun, so we’d like to include a lot of that (I.e. bars, clubs, strip clubs, etc) plus we’d definitely like to eat some great food and maybe drink some quality coffees (mostly espresso)! Another item of note, one of the group members is vegetarian and another vegan, so would be helpful to find food options that accommodate all of us. Last item to note, a few of the group are super into hard cider; so looking for any local spots whether makers or bars that serve it, in town.

What we’ve already looked at so far is a mix of bars and clubs (we are staying right in Old Montreal near Notre Dame if that helps). Some of the clubs I’ve looked at or heard recommendations for include Flyjin, Bord’Elle, Yoko Luna. We likely won’t be doing any bottle service, but getting in somewhere at least on a guest list would be great. We are mostly into clubs that would play EDM, but not a deal breaker. For very late night, I’ve read about Stereo, and although it’s Booz free, still sounds super fun.

As for bars, a nice mix of cocktail bars in the area for pregame, along with great local dive bars (which we love would be great). We are also all pretty into rock/metal music, so rock oriented bars would be perfect. Some I’m looking at include Les Foufounes Électriques, Turbo Haüs, Piranha Bar, ColdRoom, and for some variety Upstairs Jazz Bar. We are also looking for spots where ladies will be hanging out too!

Most of what I’ve found on strip clubs has been fairly conflicting on best spots but considering Chez Parée.

For food, I’m pretty lost, most places I’ve seen are either “meat-oriented” or straight vegan. We definitely want a nice dinner one night mostly for steaks, and made a reservation for Gibbys as I’ve heard it’s the best? But would love some additional recommendations.


As for additional activities, I’ve seen a few interesting things that could be fun, such as the Christmas Village that opens tomorrow, The Forges of Montreal for a beginner blacksmithing class, read about a historically accurate medieval village that is set up and fully interactive, a whiskey tasting at Cirka distillery, or even a craft beer tour. Any other thoughts or thoughts on these items would be great too!

Anyway, thanks in advance for reading, most of the group hadn’t done much, or really any planning for the groom, so I’m trying to make it an awesome time for him and doing my best to pull this together. Would really appreciate recommendations and thoughts on all this from the locals! Thanks in advance, and really looking forward to coming to your beautiful city!

I usually see my wife off to work, large cup of coffee and a large banana, walk the dog, then I’m at the gym by 730/745. Been doing this consistently since the summer. Have seen some progress and I enjoy the routine. 

I’m doing what I call “PPL+C”. Day1 Push, Day2 Pull, Day3 Legs, Day4 rest, repeat. Cardio every other day.

But I’m not getting out of the gym until 1015/1030 sometimes. I’ve got nowhere to be and no rush, but really by the time I get home and shower, it’s like half the day is gone. 

Below is the routine I’ve been doing, sometimes I don’t do it all if I notice it’s getting late or one of my injuries like my shoulder or wrists start acting up. I usually rest 2 minutes between each set, 3 minutes between each exercise.

Can you imagine my surprise listeners at home?  It was short lived.  It felt glorious and I had thought I had cracked K4's encoding mechanisms.

I was wrong because K4 is a dual autokey, but can act like Vigenère-style inserts when auto-keys align.  This is because it was built off of the same color clock substitution schedule, as you spin the dual auto key, you can break into the substitution anagram layer of the autokey with the right seed and substitutions.  It's also why K4 is so binary.  It wants the dual autokey lanes to align which temporarily collapses it to a stable offset.  HAHA I learned to call it that just the other day, how wonderful.

The seam is roughly between 36-45 (the seam and tail auto-keys) of K4.  I found it by considering it an overlap at first and K4 started ""talking"" with the words UNITEUS. By sliding the seam alignment you ""tune into these decoding windows - like  Radio.

To solve K4 you need to identify the stable seam, extract both lanes, tuning through offsets until the substitution schedule collapses into readable windows.

Other than that Kryptos Alphabet.

To start others on the path to cracking it.  The seam I started with is roughly between 36-45 (the seam and tail auto-keys) of K4.  I found it by considering it an overlap.  That made UNITEUS appear.  By sliding the seam alignment you ""tune into these decoding windows"" it's like  Radio.  It also says a lot more than 97 characters worth.  It is a framework of short of many short readable bursts!

How to solve k4 for those following at home?

Find a stable Seam.  Extract the two autokey lanes.  Slide the alignment through offsets.  Watch for the collapse of the substitution layer and read the Fragments that appear.

I’m a 36-year-old guy from New England, and like a lot of people here, I’ve never been in a relationship. It wasn’t for lack of trying — shyness, bad timing, and life just kept getting in the way.

A bit about me:
Firstly I have some sort of fame, if thats what you call it. I made a dating site promoting my singleness DatingKen, which caught news in Boston and Matt Sheer a reporter social media. I’m a huge nerd who loves conventions, gaming, and cosplay. It’s been an amazing community for me, and I’ve met some great friends through it. I cosplay characters like Eddie Munson from Stranger Things and Leon from Resident Evil. I stay active, take care of myself, and oddly enough, I’m freakishly lucky with raffles and giveaways (no clue why, but I’ll take it).

I’m looking for someone kind, patient, and down-to-earth. You don’t need to cosplay — just be someone who enjoys nerdy stuff or at least doesn’t mind it. I’m not expecting perfection; I just want a genuine connection with someone who understands what it’s like to navigate dating later than most.

I (26F) started to have feelings for my guy friend (21M)  who I serve with at my church. We’ll call him Johnny. I was originally waiting for my feelings to die out and chalked it up to just a crush.

However, Johnny and I hung out with a bunch of church friends and I felt like he was flirting with me. Johnny would always look at me when the whole group would erupt in laughter. I would catch him staring at me and he'd quickly look away. When Johnny shared stories in the group, he looked at me only, almost as if he was talking only to me. Even if I looked away when I looked back, Johnny was staring at me.

Johnny would also look at me and smile whenever romantic songs came on while everyone was doing their own thing. I, again, felt like oh maybe this is just in my head.

But at a different time, I was giving my feelings to the Lord and surrendering it to Him. I was praying and said ""God, if Johnny’s a distraction take him away, but if he's not..."" and I opened my eyes and 100 feet away, Johnny was walking right towards me but he was staring at the ground.

I (maybe prematurely) took this as a sign. The whole situation got me back into the word because I didn't want to make an idol out of my friend.

I told several friends about my experience and they also thought it was confirmation or at the very least really crazy.

I, of course, started over analyzing our interactions and I hated it. I was being weird towards Johnny because I was nervous but he was also being weird. We went on a church trip and I felt like he was ignoring me. At times though, he would walk over and stand right next to me and not say anything.

When we came back from the trip, Johnny was still ignoring me and every time he saw me, he looked like a deer in the headlights. I was so sick of thinking about him all the time (again not wanting to make him an idol) and things being weird between us because he IS my friend and I've always loved and cared for him in a platonic way.I told God if Johnny was going to keep me from Him, I didn’t want anything with him.

I decided to text him (we don't do that lol) and said I was sorry I was being weird lately and asked if he wanted to get coffee and just talk. He said yes.

I was planning on just telling Johnny how I felt in order to be transparent with him and wanting to end the weirdness I was feeling. I wanted our dynamic to go back to normal. I wanted my friend back. Day of, it felt very date–like, but I knew it could all be in my head. Johnny bought me coffee and we talked forever about the church trip, our testimonies, how we got to this point in our lives, our childhoods, our hopes and dreams etc. etc.

About 45 minutes in, Johnny asked me why I asked him to talk. He gave me this smirk when he asked me and I immediately panicked. The whole point of meeting up with him was to tell him how I felt and control how I said it (to make me more comfortable), but his question caught me off guard and I stumbled on my words and said “I don’t know” He said “okay” and we said it back to each other both times. 

The awkwardness pissed me off and he finally said “well in your text you said you were feeling weird” and I ended up telling how I was being weird and he was being weird. He said “ I was benign weird!?” and I said yeah I felt like he wouldn’t talk to me or was ignoring me. He said he wasn’t trying to and everytime he saw me I was hanging out with girls so he just didn’t come up to me. He said he was sorry and originally thought I asked to talk to him because he thought he had offended me. 

I told him we were cool and we ended on a good note. We had a church event later and I reminded him he was serving that evening and he should probably leave now to be there early (he’s required to be early). He looked at his watch and said he had five minutes. He looked at me as if he wanted to keep talking. I told him he should get going and I got up to leave. He asked me what I was doing before the event started and I said I would hang around the church until it started. 

I left in a rush, pissed off that I didn’t get my task done. The secret of my crush was eating me alive and I knew I wouldn’t get over it until I got it out in the open. 

At the event, I later felt like the Lord was telling me to tell Johnny how I felt. I know you are not supposed to test God and I had a problem with it a year ago. However, I was still going back and forth. Johnny would smile at me from across the room and I finally asked God for multiple blatant confirmations (7). 

I finally decided to write him a note and give it to him at the end of the night since I couldn’t say it. I put the note in my bible and immediately felt like the Lord was telling me to put it in my pocket so I was more likely to give it to him. By the end of the night, I couldn’t find him and I told God, “I’m not about to chase down this boy. If I don’t see him before I go, I’m not giving it to him” I walked toward the parking lot and I saw him. He asked me if I was leaving and he went to give me a big bear hug (we’ve never done that) and of course I panicked because I was planning on dabbing him up and leaving the note in his hand. I finally put the note in his hand. He asked what it was and I told him to read it later and I ran away.

I drove home with my heart in my stomach, pissed off that I was so vulnerable. However, I felt a supernatural level of peace. I had never felt so content and I knew it was from God. However, I did feel a bit confused about the outcome of what this was all for. I told God if I walk through this store and see merchandise for a movie me and Johnny watched together then these feelings I had for Johnny were leading to a relationship. (the movie was really old, I wasn’t asking for something like Wicked while there’s all this promo lol). I walked around the store looking for the crafts I intended on buying. I saw a random merch item from the movie. I brushed it off as a coincidence though.

I was about to leave the store and I saw another type of movie merch but it was a picnic blanket this time. I had written a poem about me and Johnny on a picnic blanket as soon as I had feelings for him, so naturally I took this as confirmation. I felt like it was too spot on to be nothing. 

I later had dinner with a friend of mine and I told her about what I was experiencing. She said it was crazy and asked for the first confirmation I ever asked for about Johnny.

I had to think about it and I remember MONTHS ago before I ever had feelings for Johnny. I had asked for confirmation. 

It was one of the first times I had ever hung out with this guy, before we were even friends. We had this weirdly romantic moment while serving and we gave each other this weird, loving smile of contentment. I remember praying “God, if this is supposed to be my husband, let me have feelings for him” I had asked God this because it felt like a romantic moment but at the time I wasn’t attracted to this guy AT ALL. (he’s the exact opposite of my type lol) 

Now, having dinner with my friend, I remembered this and told her. She was shocked and we didn’t know what to say of any of it. We just both decided it was all crazy. Later that night, I asked the Lord why Johnny hadn’t responded. Not out of desperation, just curiosity ( not like me at all lol), I felt like the Holy Spirit was telling me “you know he hates texting, and he’s afraid of his feelings.” I accepted this and went to bed. 

4 days after I had given Johnny the note, it was Sunday and he wasn’t at church, which was odd cause he serves in multiple ways on Sunday and is always doing something. I hung out for a couple services because I felt like the Lord was telling me to stay and serve for the children's ministry since we had new programming starting that week and the director needed help. 

I ended up seeing Johnny before I left and again he looked like a deer in the headlights. I realized “yeah, he definitely read my note” and I wasn’t ready to deal with any of it. He was in a group of friends so I just left and ended up getting lunch with some other church friends. We saw each other a couple times before I left and made awkward eye contact but we didn't say hi or anything. 

That night, we had another church event. I figured Johnny wasn’t serving since he was mostly absent at morning service. I was already on the calendar to serve and I saw him when I showed up. I was so annoyed and didn’t want to have any feelings for him anymore. I hated the whole situation. We spoke in groups but didn’t really talk one on one. 

At the end of the night, I was talking to a gal friend of mine. Johnny came over and asked to speak with me outside. I felt like throwing up. I was hopeful but also disappointed. I realized my own feelings about the situation were complicated. I wanted my feelings to be reciprocated and I also wanted him to turn me down. It was really odd. 

He ended up rejecting me and was really kind about it. He said the whole situation was new to him and he’s never had to do this before. Johnny said he wasn’t interested. I took this mostly well. I wasn’t completely upset (no one likes to get rejected tho lol) and I was mostly just confused. With God and Johnny. Also what was this all for?

I went home and told my besties and my mom. I realized that I was experiencing limerence and infatuation and wasn’t seeing Johnny completely how he was. I was over romanticizing him in my head. I was laughing at myself for ever having feelings for him. 

A few days later, I was hanging out with church friends and Johnny came last minute. When I saw him, I realized I still had a mini crush on him or maybe I was nervous because he thought I still had a crush on him. For once, I had no idea what I was feeling or what was happening to me internally. 

Things weren’t weird though. We had conversations amongst the whole group and privately. I also felt like Johnny was giving flirty vibes to a really close gal friend of mine (we’ll call her Sally) and the possibility of them becoming a relationship didn’t bother me. I considered myself over this whole thing.

I felt better and the next day I was fine and really started to see Johnny as my brother in christ again. All of his little quirks were still cute but in an admirable way, not romantic. The same way I find my gal friends cute with their little quirks. 

THEN, I saw Johnny a day later. I felt nervous and my heart played hopscotch in my chest. I panicked. WHAT THE HECK? I thought I was over this. He was being coy around me when I was talking to other people. When I was hanging out with guy friends, he would interrupt or try to talk to me. I was annoyed so I tried to ignore him. 

By the end of the night, I was secretly hoping he’d come around me and we could just talk and joke. I hated it and wanted to resent him, but I just couldn't. I still cared so much about him. I was talking with some gal friends and he came over and looked me dead in the eyes while someone was talking. I darted my eyes away and was annoyed by the attention. He started joking with one of my friends and we all started laughing. He kept looking at me and I’d catch him looking at me. I was so pissed. I felt so vulnerable and like he just enjoyed that I liked him as opposed to him liking me back. I felt vulnerable and still couldn’t hate him, which pissed me off even more. I wanted to hate him and see him as a jerk but I just couldn’t.

Johnny left the room and I prayed, “God, if this whole thing isn’t over. If there is something here and if the door isn’t closed, have him come back into the room” He did. I was confused again.

I told myself the author of confusion is the enemy, but it could also be my flawed flesh. I was annoyed again. A bunch of friends stayed longer to play basketball. Sally was going to play and I thought oh maybe he likes her. But Johnny said I should join. Mind you, I’m completely anti-sports and am painfully uncoordinated. I was gonna leave but I liked hanging out with my friends. I also felt like the Lord was telling me to stay as much as I like to run away from things like this. So I did. 

I hung out with another gal friend in the bleachers while everyone else played basketball. We had microphones and were reciting the score and giving a play by play, joking around. Johnny ended up calling a time out and looked at us to announce it. When he got my attention, he darted his eyes away immediately looking flustered. But I knew I could be overthinking it and trying to see what I wanted at that moment. The friend I was cheering with left and I decided to go to even though i wanted to hang out around Johnny. I knew this time, it was my own emotions and not the Lord. I left and prayed in the car home asking God to take away my emotions.

I woke up this morning and he still is taking over my mind. I’m so done and want to be done with it. Amongst all of this, I still love and care for Johnny and admire him deeply. It pisses me off. I’m past hate, I want to feel indifferent towards him but I can’t.

I’ve given up trying to predict the future and I want to be with someone who knows they want to be with me. BUT as I delusional for thinking Johnny liked me in the first place? I am usually able to read people and it really bothers me that I got this really wrong.

Let me know what you think. Any advice or comments are welcome. Please just be kind.

Instead, I managed to spill coffee on my shirt, miss my bus, and accidentally wave at someone who was definitely waving at the person behind me.

But somehow, everything still felt funny instead of stressful. Maybe life is just a bunch of small scenes stitched together, and I’m learning to laugh at the awkward ones too.

Anyway, hope your day is less chaotic than mine. If not, at least we’re in this together. ",1,1763687444.0,u_Inevitable_Leek_2560,0,1.0,False

Guys… one thing… uuh I can’t focus.
Like actually. My 2 hours of “studying” = 20 minutes for a normal human being and honestly? I finally know why: my sleep schedule is TRASH. Certified garbage. Needs to be thrown into the Atlantic Ocean.

Yesterday I was bragging about “studying 4 hours” but now it’s hitting me that I was basically staring at the page like a Victorian child staring out a rainy window. No thoughts. Just vibes.

And right now while typing this, it is 2:01 AM.
Why am I awake?
Why am I drinking coffee at 11 PM like a clown?
Why am I surprised I can’t focus???

So tomorrow I’m making a pact with myself:
I WILL sleep at 11:30.
I WILL wake up early.
I WILL reduce coffee (this one hurts, pls send prayers).

If tomorrow’s post says “guys I slept at 4:30 again,” just know I tried.

1p2l0e5,https://i.redd.it/elsy8u4wfi2g1.jpeg,I made a spreadsheet for items that are safe to sell or scrap (as of November 2025,"Pretty much what is says on the tin. Started with the list made by Square-Pear-1274 but wanted more information so I scoured the wikis to double check and add a few items. I also wanted to quickly know the value of items when out in the field (keep it up on my second monitor), and whether or not it’s important to recycle them at home vs. get less materials by salvaging it in the field to save inventory and weight. 

(For example, I’d rather scrap a cooling fan in the field because I get the same amount of wire I would by recycling it at home, I just miss out on 14 plastic parts which isn’t a big deal)
